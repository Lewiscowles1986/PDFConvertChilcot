<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the statements issued by the Government before the conflict on the human </p>
<p>rights abuses committed by Saddam Hussein’s regime and the human cost of </p>
<p>not intervening in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the assessments made by the Government before and during initial combat </p>
<p>operations of the number of Iraqi civilian casualties;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reports of the number of Iraqi civilian casualties during initial combat </p>
<p>operations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how the Government responded to demands that it should count the number </p>
<p>of Iraqi casualties attributable to the conflict, and to estimates of the number </p>
<p>of casualties.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> As this Section shows, there have been a number of studies to determine the civilian </p>
<p>death toll in Iraq after the Coalition invasion. The numbers vary considerably. What is </p>
<p>not in doubt is that, in both the military operation to overthrow the Iraqi regime and the </p>
<p>subsequent violence, many tens of thousands of Iraqi citizens, most of them civilians, </p>
<p>lost their lives. Many more were displaced or injured, or lost members of their families.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> It is beyond the scope and abilities of this Inquiry to establish independently the </p>
<p>number of fatalities caused by conflict in Iraq, or the broader human cost of the conflict </p>
<p>to the Iraqi people. The Inquiry is, however, very conscious of the extent of the suffering </p>
<p>in Iraq resulting from the conflict and this has informed its approach to its analysis of the </p>
<p>course of the conflict and to drawing lessons for the future.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that a Government has a responsibility to make every </p>
<p>reasonable effort to understand the likely and actual effects of its military actions on </p>
<p>civilians.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the months before the invasion, Mr Blair emphasised the need to minimise the </p>
<p>number of civilian casualties arising from an invasion of Iraq. The MOD’s responses </p>
<p>offered reassurance based on the tight targeting procedures governing the air </p>
<p>campaign.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD made only a broad estimate of direct civilian casualties arising from an </p>
<p>attack on Iraq, based on previous operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With hindsight, greater efforts should have been made in the post&#8209;conflict period </p>
<p>to determine the number of civilian casualties and the broader effects of military </p>
<p>operations on civilians. More time was devoted to the question of which department </p>
<p>should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than it was to efforts to </p>
<p>determine the actual number.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government’s consideration of the issue of Iraqi civilian casualties was driven by </p>
<p>its concern to rebut accusations that coalition forces were responsible for the deaths </p>
<p>of large numbers of civilians, and to sustain domestic support for operations in Iraq.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>17  |  Civilian casualties</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The Inquiry received a number of substantive submissions relating to the human cost </p>
<p>of the conflict in Iraq, including from:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hamit Dardagan and Professor John Sloboda for the Iraq Body Count (IBC) </p>
<p>project.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> The IBC project aims to record the violent civilian deaths that have </p>
<p>resulted from the 2003 military intervention in Iraq. In its submission to the </p>
<p>Inquiry, IBC argued that the Inquiry should take full and proper account of Iraqi </p>
<p>casualties resulting from the conflict and the subsequent breakdown in security. </p>
<p>It continued: “One of the most important questions in situations of armed conflict </p>
<p>and in the laws of war is whether the use of force has been a proportionate </p>
<p>response to the threat that prompted it … It is impossible to establish the </p>
<p>wisdom of actions taken … if the full consequences in human welfare are not </p>
<p>taken into account. Casualty data are perhaps the most glaring indication of the </p>
<p>full costs of war.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Action on Armed Violence (AOAV).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> AOAV is a non&#8209;governmental organisation </p>
<p>(NGO) which aims to reduce the incidence and impact of global armed violence. </p>
<p>In its submission to the Inquiry, AOAV argued that the UK Government actively </p>
<p>sought to maintain a position of ignorance regarding measurements of death, </p>
<p>injury and deprivation resulting from violence in Iraq. It proposed that the UK </p>
<p>Government should establish a structured process to undertake transparent </p>
<p>measurement and monitoring of the impact of armed violence where its Armed </p>
<p>Forces are active.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The Inquiry is grateful for these, and other, submissions, and has taken account of </p>
<p>them in preparing its Report.</p>
<p><b>Consideration of Iraqi civilian casualties before the conflict</b></p>
<p><b>Statements on the human cost of not intervening in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> The UK Government dossier<i> Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Assessment </i></p>
<p><i>of the British Government </i>was published on 24 September 2002.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> The dossier is </p>
<p>considered in detail in Section 4.2.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> Eight of the dossier’s 50 pages considered life in Iraq under Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>describing his security apparatus, internal repression, external wars and abuse of </p>
<p>human rights.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The dossier’s Executive Summary indicated the purpose of that material:</p>
<p>“But the threat from Iraq does not depend solely on the [Weapons of Mass </p>
<p>Destruction – WMD] capabilities we have described. It arises also because of the </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>violent and aggressive nature of Saddam Hussein’s regime. His record of internal </p>
<p>repression and external aggression gives rise to unique concerns about the threat </p>
<p>he poses.”</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The dossier stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein used patronage and violence to motivate his supporters and </p>
<p>to control or eliminate opposition. He had pursued a long&#8209;term programme of </p>
<p>persecuting the Iraqi Kurds, including through the use of chemical weapons. </p>
<p>Amnesty International had estimated that more than 100,000 Kurds had been </p>
<p>killed or had disappeared during the 1987 to 1988 “Anfal” campaign of attacks </p>
<p>on Kurdish villages. Thousands of Iraqi Shia had also been killed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had led Iraq into two wars of aggression, against Iran and </p>
<p>Kuwait. The Iran&#8209;Iraq War was estimated to have caused one million casualties.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Human rights abuses continued within Iraq: “People continue to be arrested and </p>
<p>detained on suspicion of political or religious activities or often because they </p>
<p>are related to members of the opposition. Executions are carried out without </p>
<p>due process of law. Relatives are often prevented from burying the victims in </p>
<p>accordance with Islamic practice. Thousands of prisoners have been executed.”</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Mr Blair addressed those issues in his opening statement in the 24 September 2002 </p>
<p>Parliamentary debate:</p>
<p>“People say, ‘But why Saddam?’ … two things about Saddam stand out. He has </p>
<p>used these weapons in Iraq itself – thousands dying in those chemical weapons </p>
<p>attacks – and in the Iran&#8209;Iraq war, started by him, in which one million people died; </p>
<p>and his is a regime with no moderate elements to appeal to.</p>
<p>“Read the chapter on Saddam and human rights in this dossier. Read not just about </p>
<p>the 1 million dead in the war with Iran, not just about the 100,000 Kurds brutally </p>
<p>murdered in northern Iraq, not just about the 200,000 Shia Muslims driven from </p>
<p>the marshlands in southern Iraq, and not just about the attempt to subjugate and </p>
<p>brutalise the Kuwaitis in 1990 that led to the Gulf war. I say, ‘Read also about the </p>
<p>routine butchering of political opponents, the prison ‘cleansing’ regimes in which </p>
<p>thousands die, the torture chambers and the hideous penalties supervised by </p>
<p>him and his family and detailed by Amnesty International.’ Read it all and, again, </p>
<p>I defy anyone to say that this cruel and sadistic dictator should be allowed any </p>
<p>possibility of getting his hands on chemical, biological and nuclear weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction.”</p>

<p><b>11. </b> Amnesty International issued a press release two days later, urging the UN Security </p>
<p>Council to consider:</p>
<p>“… not only the security and political consequences of its action, but also the </p>
<p>inevitable human rights and humanitarian toll of war … concern for the life, safety </p>
<p>and security of the Iraqi people is sorely missing from the debate, as is any </p>
<p>discussion on what would be their fate in the aftermath of conflict …”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>12. </b> On 2 December, the FCO published a report on Saddam Hussein’s crimes and </p>
<p>human rights abuses.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> The report is addressed in more detail in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The FCO report was “based on the testimony of Iraqi exiles, evidence gathered </p>
<p>by UN rapporteurs and human rights organisations, and intelligence material”. It </p>
<p>examined “Iraq’s record on torture, the treatment of women, prison conditions, arbitrary </p>
<p>and summary killings, the persecution of the Kurds and the Shia, the harassment of </p>
<p>opposition figures outside Iraq and the occupation of Kuwait”.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, told the BBC that the report was being </p>
<p>published “because it is important that people understand the comprehensive evil that </p>
<p>is Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The report was criticised by some as an attempt to influence public opinion in favour </p>
<p>of war.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Amnesty International responded to that report, stating that the human rights </p>
<p>situation in Iraq should not be used selectively; the US and other Western Governments </p>
<p>had ignored previous Amnesty International reports of widespread human rights </p>
<p>violations in Iraq.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Amnesty International continued:</p>
<p>“As the debate on whether to use military force against Iraq escalates, the human </p>
<p>rights of the Iraqi people, as a direct consequence of any potential military action, </p>
<p>is sorely missing from the equation.”</p>
<p><b>17. </b> In his speech to the Labour Party Spring Conference in Glasgow on 15 February </p>
<p>2003, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“Yes, there are consequences of war. If we remove Saddam by force, people will die </p>
<p>and some will be innocent. We must live with the consequences of our actions, even </p>
<p>the unintended ones.</p>
<p>“But there are also consequences of ‘stop the war’ …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Blair said that those consequences would include Saddam Hussein remaining </p>
<p>in power in Iraq:</p>
<p>“A country that in 1978, the year before he seized power, was richer than Malaysia </p>
<p>or Portugal. A country where today, 135 out of every 1,000 Iraqi children die before </p>
<p>the age of five – 70 percent of these deaths are from diarrhoea and respiratory </p>
<p>infections that are easily preventable. Where almost a third of children born in the </p>
<p>centre and south of Iraq have chronic malnutrition.</p>
<p>“Where 60 percent of the people depend on Food Aid.</p>
<p>“Where half the population of rural areas have no safe water.</p>
<p>“Where every year and now, as we speak, tens of thousands of political prisoners </p>
<p>languish in appalling conditions in Saddam’s jails and are routinely executed.</p>
<p>“Where in the past 15 years over 150,000 Shia Moslems in Southern Iraq and </p>
<p>Moslem Kurds in Northern Iraq have been butchered, with up to four million Iraqis </p>
<p>in exile round the world, including 350,000 now in Britain …</p>
<p>“If there are 500,000 on that [Stop the War] march, that is still less than the number </p>
<p>of people whose deaths Saddam has been responsible for.</p>
<p>“If there are one million, that is still less than the number of people who died in the </p>
<p>wars he started.”</p>
<p><b>Child mortality in Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s regime</b></p>
<p>The figure for child mortality in Iraq under Saddam Hussein’s regime used by Mr Blair in </p>
<p>his speech to the Labour Party Spring Conference in February 2003, and in subsequent </p>
<p>public statements, has been questioned. The Inquiry therefore considered the origin of </p>
<p>that figure.</p>
<p>On 14 February, the day before Mr Blair’s speech, Ms Clare Short, the International </p>
<p>Development Secretary, wrote to Mr Blair setting out key humanitarian issues in Iraq </p>
<p>(see Section 6.5).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Ms Short advised that the humanitarian situation in the centre and </p>
<p>the south of Iraq, which was under Saddam Hussein’s control, was worse than the </p>
<p>situation in the north. To demonstrate that point, she attached statistics, attributed to the </p>
<p>UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF), on child and maternal mortality in Iraq. Child mortality in </p>
<p>central and southern Iraq was 135 per 1,000 (“worse than the Democratic Republic of </p>
<p>Congo or Mozambique”) compared with 72 per 1,000 in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>On the same day, No.10 asked the FCO for material on a number of issues in preparation </p>
<p>for Mr Blair’s speech to the Conference, including how many Iraqi children under the age </p>
<p>of five died each month.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>17  |  Civilian casualties</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>The FCO’s reply, which had been agreed with DFID, stated that there were no truly </p>
<p>reliable figures for child mortality in Iraq.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The only figures available were from a 1999 </p>
<p>UNICEF report which claimed that child mortality had risen from 56 per 1,000 in 1989 to </p>
<p>131 per 1,000 in 1999 in “Baghdad&#8209;controlled Iraq” and fallen from 80 per 1,000 to 72 per </p>
<p>1,000 over the same period in “UN&#8209;controlled” northern Iraq. However, those figures had </p>
<p>been questioned. The household surveys on which the figures were based had been </p>
<p>“conducted with the Iraqi regime’s ‘help’ and relied on some Iraqi figures”.</p>
<p>A No.10 official passed the figures for Baghdad&#8209;controlled Iraq (but not northern Iraq) to </p>
<p>Mr Blair.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> The official did not make any reference to the reliability of those figures.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concludes that the figures provided to Mr Blair in February 2003 by Ms Short </p>
<p>and FCO officials were drawn from UNICEF’s Iraq Child and Maternal Mortality Survey </p>
<p>(ICMMS), published in August 1999.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> That survey received extensive coverage in the </p>
<p>media, in particular on whether there was a connection between the apparent rise in child </p>
<p>mortality and the sanctions regime that was then in force.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>The level of child mortality in Iraq estimated by the ICMMS was significantly higher than </p>
<p>that estimated by later surveys. The Child Mortality Estimates website, which presents the </p>
<p>work of the UN Inter&#8209;Agency Group on Child Mortality Estimation, charts the estimates of </p>
<p>major surveys of under&#8209;five mortality in Iraq.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>The UN Inter&#8209;Agency Group on Child Mortality Estimation estimates that the under&#8209;five </p>
<p>mortality rate in Iraq was 55 per 1,000 in 1989, 46 per 1,000 in 1999, 42 per 1,000 in </p>
<p>2003, and 37 per 1,000 in 2010 (when Mr Blair gave his evidence to the Inquiry).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>In September 2010, Professor Michael Spagat reported that the child mortality estimates </p>
<p>reported by the ICMMS were between two and three times higher than those reported </p>
<p>by three other major UN&#8209;sponsored surveys (the Iraq Living Conditions Survey 2005, the </p>
<p>Multiple Indictor Cluster Survey in Iraq 2007 and the Iraq Family Health Survey 2008).</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He suggested that the high and rising child mortality rates reported by the ICMMS could </p>
<p>be explained by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the manipulation of the sanctions regime by Saddam Hussein, in order to </p>
<p>exacerbate the suffering caused by that regime for political purposes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the manipulation of data by Saddam Hussein’s regime, to exaggerate the </p>
<p>suffering caused by sanctions.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>19. </b> On 19 March, in response to a question from Mr Martin Caton in the House of </p>
<p>Commons, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“Of course, I understand that, if there is conflict, there will be civilian casualties … </p>
<p>However … civilian casualties in Iraq are occurring every day as a result of the rule </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein. He will be responsible for many, many more deaths even in one </p>
<p>year than we will be in any conflict.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>20. </b> The Coalition began military action against Iraq later that day.</p>
<p><b>Assessments of Iraqi civilian casualties during initial </b></p>
<p><b>combat operations</b></p>
<p><b>21. </b> In the second half of 2002, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) produced four </p>
<p>Assessments which identified the possibility of significant civilian casualties in the event </p>
<p>of a Coalition attack on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> In August 2002, the JIC assessed Saddam Hussein’s diplomatic and military options </p>
<p>to deter, avert or limit the scope and effectiveness of a US attack.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> The JIC’s Key </p>
<p>Judgements included:</p>
<p>“Saddam would order the use of CBW [chemical and biological weapons] against </p>
<p>Coalition forces at some point, probably after a Coalition attack had begun. Once </p>
<p>Saddam was convinced that his fate was sealed, he would order the unrestrained </p>
<p>use of CBW against Coalition forces, supporting regional states and Israel.”</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The Assessment also identified a number of “unorthodox options” that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein might pursue, including:</p>
<p>“… a ‘scorched earth’ policy … with the aim of creating a humanitarian or </p>
<p>environmental catastrophe …”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> In September, the JIC assessed how Iraq might use chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“If not previously employed, Saddam will order the indiscriminate use of whatever </p>
<p>CBW weapons remain available late in a ground campaign or as a final act of </p>
<p>vengeance.”</p>

<p>177</p>
<p><b>25. </b> In October, the JIC assessed the likely reaction of the Kurdish and Shia population </p>
<p>of Iraq to any US&#8209;led attack.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> It stated that:</p>
<p>“… <b>spontaneous uprisings, </b>without any clear central leadership, are likely in both </p>
<p>southern and northern Iraq … should the regime’s control collapse quickly … In both </p>
<p>areas there could be violent score settling.”</p>
<p><b>26. </b> In December, the JIC assessed Iraq’s military options during Coalition air strikes and </p>
<p>a ground attack.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“Saddam [Hussein] would use chemical and biological weapons (CBW) if he faced </p>
<p>defeat. He might also use them earlier in a conflict, including against coalition forces, </p>
<p>neighbouring states and his own people. Israel could be his first target.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Other Iraqi responses might include seizing hostages as ‘human shields’; using </p>
<p>non&#8209;lethal BW agents in a deniable manner; suicide attacks; or a ‘scorched earth’ </p>

<p><b>31. </b> No assessment had been produced of civilian casualties arising from “urban </p>
<p>operations in Basra”. Experience from World War II suggested that between 200 </p>
<p>and 2,000 civilians could be killed in urban operations in Basra, depending on </p>
<p>“circumstances, duration and the degree to which civilian casualties are minimised”.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Blair was briefed on the targeting aspects of an air campaign by Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)) and Air Commodore </p>
<p>Mike Heath (MOD Head of the Directorate of Targeting and Information Operations) </p>
<p>on 6 February.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>33. </b> At the meeting, Mr Blair underlined the importance of “minimising the number of </p>
<p>civilian casualties and ensuring that all targets were appropriate and proportionate” and </p>
<p>that consideration should be given to “how best to explain publicly the scale and nature </p>
<p>of the campaign”.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 19 February, at the request of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat in the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, the JIC provided an Assessment of the situation in southern Iraq and </p>
<p>what might happen before, during and after any Coalition military action.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> The JIC </p>
<p>assessed that the “relative weakness of Iraq’s conventional forces in the south, and </p>
<p>the fact that those forces will face the brunt of a Coalition ground attack” meant that </p>
<p>southern Iraq was <b>“the most likely area for the first use of CBW against both </b></p>
<p><b>Coalition forces and the local population”</b>.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The JIC identified a number of factors that could undermine popular support for any </p>

<p><b>39. </b> General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief US Central Command (CENTCOM), </p>
<p>met Mr Blair on 25 February.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> The record of the meeting written by a No.10 official </p>
<p>reported that Mr Blair asked if Gen Franks had “any idea” of the scale of likely </p>
<p>civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Adm Boyce stated that civilian casualties were likely to be in the “low hundreds”. </p>
<p>Gen Franks stated that ways to minimise civilian casualties were being explored.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Mr Blair concluded that “we must set out our strategy: to destroy the regime but </p>
<p>minimise civilian casualties”.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, sent the MOD’s response </p>
<p>to Mr Blair’s questions to No.10 on 24 February.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> Mr Watkins advised that the MOD </p>
<p>estimated that the UK “land battle” casualties would be in the order of 30–60 killed, </p>
<p>and that Iraqi land battle casualties would be in the order of 500–1,200 killed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Detailed </p>
<p>assessments of likely casualties from the air campaign, including civilian casualties, </p>
<p>could only be done on a “target&#8209;by&#8209;target” basis and this work was “in hand”. </p>
<p>Mr Watkins stated:</p>
<p>“Iraqi civilian casualties from anything other than the air campaign are likely to be </p>
<p>relatively few, unless Coalition forces become engaged in fighting in urban areas.”</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Watkins’ letter did not refer to the broad estimates of civilian casualties that had </p>
<p>been submitted to the Chiefs of Staff on 3 February.</p>

<p><b>44. </b> Section 16.2 addresses the provision of medical care to UK Service Personnel.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The MOD recognised before the invasion that, under the Geneva Convention, it was </p>
<p>obliged to provide Iraqi citizens (both military personnel and civilians) with the medical </p>
<p>care that they required within the UK’s means and capabilities.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>46. </b> That obligation was reflected in military planning for Operation TELIC. The MOD’s </p>
<p>policy was that initial treatment would take place in theatre, with transfer to other </p>
<p>countries in the region if transfer was required and if those countries agreed to accept </p>
<p>Iraqi citizens for treatment. If those countries did not agree to accept them, the UK would </p>
<p>evacuate the very seriously injured to the UK for specialist care.</p>

<p>“Hundreds.”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> As major combat operations continued, the Government came under sustained </p>
<p>pressure in the House of Commons to provide estimates of Iraqi and civilian casualties </p>
<p>and to minimise civilian casualties and damage to infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> On 2 April, in response to a question from Mr John MacDougall, Mr Adam Ingram, </p>
<p>Minister of State for the Armed Forces, stated:</p>
<p>“We have no means of ascertaining the numbers of military or civilian lives lost </p>
<p>during the conflict in Iraq to date, although we make every effort to keep any impact </p>
<p>upon the Iraqi civilian population to an absolute minimum. All our military planning is </p>
<p>conducted in full accordance with our obligations under international law to employ </p>
<p>the minimum necessary use of force to achieve military effect, and to avoid injury </p>
<p>to non&#8209;combatants or civilian infrastructure. Practically, this is achieved through a </p>

<p><b>Battle Damage Assessment</b></p>
<p>Section 6.2 describes the main principles of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), </p>
<p>also known as the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) or the Law of War, how they were </p>
<p>disseminated to those engaged in military action, and how they were reflected in the UK’s </p>
<p>Targeting Directive and Rules of Engagement (ROEs).</p>
<p>The key elements of IHL which apply to targeting of military objectives during a conflict are </p>
<p>set out in the 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Protocol I). </p>
<p>The main principles can be summarised as:</p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Distinction.</b> The parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between the </p>
<p>civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military </p>
<p>objectives, and shall direct their operations only against military objectives </p>
<p>(Article 48).</p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Proportionality.</b> Military objectives must not be attacked if the attack is likely to </p>
<p>cause civilian casualties or damage which would be excessive in relation to the </p>
<p>concrete and direct military advantage anticipated (Article 57:2:b).</p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Military Necessity.</b> Offensive operations must be limited to those which are </p>
<p>necessary (Article 57:3).</p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Feasible Precautions.</b> In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall </p>
<p>be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects.</p>
<p>Those who plan or decide upon an attack must take a number of specified precautions, </p>
<p>focusing on the principles outlined above (Article 57).</p>
<p>The Battle Damage Assessment (BDA) process in place at the beginning of Op TELIC was </p>
<p>set out in the UK’s 2001 ‘Joint Targeting and Battle Damage Assessment for UK Forces’.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>The paper stated that the purpose of BDA was:</p>
<p>“… to evaluate the overall effectiveness of an attack. It is also required to determine </p>
<p>collateral and additional damage in order to provide an authoritative statement about </p>
<p>the proportionality and legality of the attack, and on the absence or presence of </p>
<p>collateral or additional damage when required for rebuttal purposes.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>The paper defined “collateral damage” as unintentional or incidental damage affecting </p>
<p>facilities, equipment or personnel that were not justifiable military objectives. It defined </p>
<p>“additional damage” as unintentional or incidental damage affecting facilities, equipment or </p>
<p>personnel that were justifiable military objectives.</p>
<p>The paper did not describe how, after an attack, the number of civilian casualties should </p>
<p>be determined.</p>
<p>The MOD told the Inquiry that, during Op TELIC 1, civilian casualty incidents were classed </p>
<p>as “serious incidents” for which investigation was mandated by the Commanding Officer and </p>
<p>a “higher authority”.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> The process was formalised in June 2003, so that any incident judged </p>
<p>to have potentially fallen outside the UK’s ROEs was fully investigated by the Service Police.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>Case study of a bombing in a Basra suburb, 5 April 2003</b></p>
<p><b>54. </b> The deaths of 10 members of the Hamoudi family in a Coalition air strike on houses </p>
<p>in a residential area of Basra in early April 2003 attracted significant media attention.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The Inquiry has considered, as a case study, the Government’s role in and </p>
<p>response to the air strike.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> The UK military undertook a Rapid Collateral Damage Assessment on 4 April 2003 </p>
<p>for a possible attack on a small group of residential houses in Basra that were expected </p>
<p>to be visited by General Ali Hasan Al&#8209;Majid (also known as Chemical Ali).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> Gen </p>
<p>Al&#8209;Majid was described as responsible for co&#8209;ordinating resistance to the Coalition within </p>
<p>southern Iraq and therefore as a combatant.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>57. </b> The Assessment concluded that seven houses (not including those targeted) might </p>
<p>suffer collateral damage, and that there would be additional casualties in the open, </p>
<p>resulting in 39 civilian casualties in a day attack and 51 in a night attack (again, not </p>
<p>including casualties in the targeted houses).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> No separate estimate had been made of </p>
<p>damage to or casualties in the targeted buildings.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Given the number of expected civilian casualties (more than 30), approval </p>
<p>for the attack was referred from HQ 1st (UK) Armoured Division to Air Marshal </p>
<p>(AM) Brian Burridge, the UK’s National Contingent Commander, and hence to </p>
<p>Mr Hoon.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>59. </b> AM Burridge advised Mr Hoon that:</p>
<p>“… the expected civilian casualties … would not be excessive in relation to the </p>
<p>direct and concrete military advantage anticipated should Al&#8209;Majid be successfully </p>
<p>targeted. The attack is therefore capable of being assessed as proportional by the </p>
<p>Commander.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>60. </b> On 4 April, Mr Hoon agreed that the attack should proceed.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> However, Gen Al&#8209;Majid </p>
<p>was reported to have left the location before the attack could be carried out.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> In the expectation of Gen Al&#8209;Majid’s return, AM Burridge also sought approval for the </p>
<p>attack from CENTCOM.</p>

<p><b>69. </b> The consolidated BDA considered the contribution that pre&#8209;planned strikes had </p>
<p>made to the campaign, and concluded that:</p>
<p>“… PGMs [precision guided munitions] shortened the battle … and as a result, </p>
<p>reduced loss of life on both sides.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> An MOD official advised Mr Ingram on 23 April that an investigation into Coalition </p>

<p>indicated that Mr Hamoudi’s claim was true.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Two of the bombs had missed their </p>
<p>target “and we suspect therefore that these bombs caused the collateral damage to </p>
<p>Mr Hamoudi’s house”.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The official also advised that although the MOD had not yet developed a policy on </p>
<p>compensation, it was unlikely that Mr Hamoudi would have a claim. There was no legal </p>
<p>obligation on the Coalition to compensate civilians affected by hostilities. In line with </p>

<p>“… the Coalition does take every care to ensure that our military action avoids injury </p>

<p>Was the intelligence that had placed Gen Al&#8209;Majid at the location (in a residential </p>

<p><b>74. </b> Mr Sudad Hamoudi concluded that there had to be “some kind of accountability” for </p>
<p>the loss of civilian lives.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> An MOD official provided Mr Ingram with a draft reply to Mr Sudad Hamoudi’s letter </p>
<p>on 20 June.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> The official advised that further analysis of the attack suggested that the </p>
<p>damage to Mr Abed Hamoudi’s house had not been caused by one of the two bombs </p>
<p>that had missed their target, as had been suggested in the 23 April minute to Mr Ingram, </p>
<p>but had instead been “an unavoidable consequence of an accurate strike on the target </p>
<p>house”. The official continued:</p>
<p>“The targeting planning process identified that collateral damage was likely in </p>
<p>neighbouring properties to the target area. If the Hamoudi house was one of these, </p>
<p>it therefore seems possible it was damaged as an expected and unavoidable </p>
<p>consequence of the strike on the building believed to contain General ‘Chemical’ </p>
<p>Ali Hassan Al&#8209;Majid, although at the moment we cannot say this with certainty.</p>
<p>“Although we can say with complete certainty that the Hamoudi house was not </p>
<p>deliberately targeted by the Coalition … it becomes difficult in this particular instance </p>
<p>to sustain with any confidence the line that this was an accident.”</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The MOD official stated that there was nevertheless no doubt as to the legitimacy </p>
<p>of the attack.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> The official also stated: “In line with previous operations we would not expect to offer </p>
<p>compensation for damages resulting from legitimate targeting during hostilities.”</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Ingram replied to Mr Sudad Hamoudi on 23 June.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> He reiterated his sorrow at </p>
<p>the deaths caused by the attack and set out the UK Government’s position on its legality:</p>
<p>“As the Commander of the Southern Region [of Iraq] … Al&#8209;Majid was a key Iraqi </p>
<p>military figure whose removal from command was expected to deliver considerable </p>
<p>military advantage … thus ultimately minimising casualties on both sides. The attack </p>
<p>on the place where he was believed to be located was therefore entirely lawful.”</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Ingram was advised on 10 July – over three months after the attack – that the </p>
<p>UK’s “research” into the incident remained “incomplete, and the information available </p>
<p>ambiguous”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> PJHQ was trying to confirm the address of Mr Hamoudi’s house, and </p>
<p>that the strike on Gen Al&#8209;Majid was “actually accurate and directed against the correct </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinates”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>Responding to demands to count civilian casualties</b></p>
<p><b>81. </b> From early June 2003, and throughout the summer, there were signs that security </p>
<p>in both Baghdad and the South was deteriorating.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The Government continued to face pressure in Parliament to provide estimates </p>
<p>of the numbers of Iraqi citizens who had died during the conflict. The Government’s </p>
<p>line remained that the UK had no means of ascertaining the number of Iraqi Service </p>
<p>Personnel or civilians who had been killed during the conflict.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> On 14 October 2003, in response to a question from Mr Adam Price regarding the </p>
<p>number of Iraqi civilians who had been killed by UK or US forces in Iraq since the end of </p>
<p>the conflict, Mr Hoon said:</p>
<p>“We make every effort to minimise the impact of military operations on the Iraqi </p>
<p>civilian population.</p>
<p>“We have no reliable means of ascertaining the numbers of civilians killed by United </p>
<p>Kingdom Forces since the conflict ended.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>84. </b> FCO and MOD officials discussed that response.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> On 12 November, an FCO official reported to Mr John Buck, FCO Director Iraq, that </p>
<p>according to MOD officials:</p>
<p>“… notwithstanding this answer, records are kept of all significant incidents involving </p>
<p>UK forces. A significant incident would include … a soldier wounding or killing a </p>
<p>civilian. At present, this information is not collated, although PJHQ accept that it </p>
<p>could be.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>86. </b> That collated information would not necessarily be “fully reliable”, as UK forces could </p>
<p>not always be sure if someone had been killed or wounded in an incident, and whether </p>
<p>that person was a civilian.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> On the same day, PJHQ sent Mr Hoon a report on the death of two Iraqi adults and </p>
<p>the injury of an Iraqi child in an incident involving UK forces.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>88. </b> The report prompted Mr Hoon to ask PJHQ for “further advice on the total numbers </p>
<p>of civilians killed by UK forces since the end of major combat operations”.</p>

<p>Military Police (RMP) had begun investigations into 17 civilian fatalities allegedly caused </p>
<p>by UK forces.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Hoon on 18 November to ask that the MOD examine whether </p>
<p>it would be viable to collate information on post&#8209;conflict civilian casualties inflicted </p>
<p>lawfully and in accordance with the UK’s Rules of Engagement by UK forces (and </p>
<p>other troop contributors) in the UK’s Area of Responsibility.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> Mr Straw recalled recent </p>
<p>media and NGO reporting on the “allegedly high levels of civilian casualties inflicted by </p>
<p>Coalition forces” and the level of Parliamentary and public interest, and continued:</p>
<p>“I recognise fully the difficulties involved in compiling accurate statistics about civilian </p>
<p>casualties, particularly during combat operations. But I am concerned that the </p>
<p>current UK/US position – that ‘there is no reliable means of ascertaining the number </p>
<p>of civilian casualties, even in post&#8209;conflict Iraq’ – leaves the field entirely open to our </p>
<p>critics and lets them set the agenda …</p>
<p>“We need to find ways of countering the damaging perception that civilians are being </p>
<p>killed needlessly, and in large numbers, by Coalition forces.”</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Mr Straw referred to the work of IBC, which he described as having “some credibility </p>
<p>(within the sourcing limitations)”.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office passed Mr Straw’s letter to PJHQ, asking for a draft reply.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s Private Office commented that they had already asked PJHQ to identify the </p>
<p>total number of civilians killed by UK forces since the end of major combat operations.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> PJHQ replied to Mr Hoon’s Private Office on 25 November.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> It confirmed that </p>
<p>assessment reports (ASSESSREPs) recorded the detail of contacts and incidents in </p>
<p>the UK’s Area of Operations, including details of civilian “casualties or deaths”. It would </p>
<p>take two weeks to review all ASSESSREPs produced since 1 May 2003, to determine </p>
<p>the number of Iraqi civilian casualties. The number produced would not be “definitive </p>
<p>or entirely comprehensive”; ASSESSREPs would only cover incidents which were </p>
<p>witnessed by or involved UK forces.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> PJHQ also advised:</p>
<p>“The current line, that there is no reliable way of knowing how many casualties there </p>
<p>have been … was perfectly reasonable during the decisive combat phase of Op </p>
<p>TELIC … as long&#8209;range attacks meant that there was no source on the ground to </p>
<p>verify … casualty numbers.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>“Since … the end of decisive combat operations, this line has become more difficult </p>
<p>to defend as confirmed cases of civilian casualties where UK forces are involved are </p>
<p>recorded locally.”</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Mr Hoon replied to Mr Straw the following day, advising that neither Iraqi ministries </p>
<p>nor Coalition Forces currently had the capacity to collate definitive statistics on the </p>
<p>causes of death or injury to civilians.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> He nevertheless shared Mr Straw’s desire to be </p>
<p>able to produce accurate casualty statistics “to be able to refute some of the more wild </p>
<p>speculation”. The SIB was investigating 17 civilian fatalities allegedly caused by UK </p>
<p>forces. The MOD was “seeking to analyse” incident reports produced since 1 May 2003 </p>
<p>in order to determine the likely number of “additional Iraqi civilian deaths”. That process </p>
<p>would take some time; Mr Hoon undertook to write to Mr Straw with the results.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Mr Price secured an Adjournment Debate on “military operations and civilian deaths </p>
<p>in post&#8209;war Iraq”, which was held in Westminster Hall on 7 January 2004.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Mr Price had </p>
<p>previously tabled 17 Parliamentary Questions on civilian casualties in post&#8209;war Iraq and </p>
<p>had sent his paper <i>Can Kill, Won’t Count</i> to Mr Hoon and the Attorney General.</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Mr Ingram’s briefing for the debate advised that the review of ASSESSREPs which </p>
<p>had been initiated the previous month had been completed. In addition to the 17 civilian </p>
<p>deaths which were subject to investigation by SIB/RMP, the review had identified a </p>
<p>further 17 civilians who had been killed by UK forces; one in an (unspecified) accident </p>
<p>and 16 in circumstances where force was deemed to have been used in accordance </p>
<p>with the UK’s Rules of Engagement.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Opening the debate, Mr Price asked Mr Ingram how many civilian casualties had </p>
<p>been reported by UK forces.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> In his response, Mr Ingram referred to the 17 deaths that </p>
<p>were being investigated by SIB/RMP, but not to the 17 further deaths that the MOD </p>
<p>review had identified.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Ingram rejected the charge that the UK was refusing to keep records of civilian </p>
<p>casualties:</p>
<p>“That is not true … Although we record all such incidents, it would be wrong to claim </p>
<p>that we have an exhaustive record, because we cannot always be certain of the </p>
<p>number of fatalities that result. In some incidents … those who have been attacking </p>
<p>UK forces and who have been injured or killed are removed from the scene …</p>
<p>“There have also been incidents in which UK forces have been forced to withdraw </p>
<p>from an engagement with no reliable means of ascertaining the number of fatalities </p>
<p>… Finally, gun battles have taken place in which our forces were not involved, but </p>
<p>there have been claims that they were responsible for casualties none the less.”</p>

<p><b>100. </b> Mr Ingram also clarified the MOD’s definition of a civilian:</p>
<p>“For our purposes, the term ‘civilian’ applies to all Iraqis. Besides peaceful </p>
<p>law&#8209;abiding men, women and children, it includes those former regime loyalists who </p>
<p>have since April continued to bomb, kill and maim their fellow Iraqi countrymen and </p>
<p>women and Coalition troops.”</p>
<p><b>101. </b> On 6 February, in response to a written Parliamentary Question from Mr Price, </p>
<p>Mr Ingram stated:</p>
<p>“As at 2 February, since the end of major combat operations 37 alleged fatalities had </p>
<p>been reported by British units of which 18 have been the subject of investigations. </p>
<p>All those not subject to investigation involved assailants attacking British forces and </p>
<p>in defending themselves the soldiers involved were acting clearly within their Rules </p>
<p>of Engagement.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>102. </b> That was the first public statement, of which the Inquiry is aware, of the number </p>
<p>of civilians killed by UK forces in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> IBC reported on 7 February 2004 that the number of “non&#8209;combatant civilian” </p>
<p>deaths in Iraq during 2003 “as a result of the US/UK&#8209;led invasion and Occupation of </p>
<p>Iraq” might have passed 10,000.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>104. </b> IBC commented:</p>
<p>“Pushing the total past the 10,000 mark were recent reports of Iraqi policemen killed </p>
<p>since Saddam’s fall in April. It is unsurprising that, as the CPA [Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority] and Occupying forces bunker themselves behind concrete fortresses, their </p>
<p>most exposed and least well&#8209;protected front&#8209;line defence, members of the ‘new’ Iraqi </p>
<p>civil defence and police forces, have suffered disproportionately.”</p>
<p><b>105. </b> On 23 April, at his request, Mr Blair received 19 “unvarnished accounts” of </p>
<p>progress on security, the political process and reconstruction in Iraq (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p><b>106. </b> In his response to those accounts, Mr Blair asked for answers to four specific </p>
<p>questions, including:</p>
<p>“How many civilians have been killed in Iraq, and how? The figure of 15,000 is out </p>
<p>there as a fact – is it accurate?”</p>
<p>76</p>

<p>operations; figures ranged from 5,000 to 20,000. The MOD’s public line had been that it </p>
<p>was not possible to determine the number of civilian casualties, and that UK forces took </p>
<p>every effort to minimise the impact of military operations on the civilian population.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> An “initial assessment” undertaken by the MOD in February 2004 had indicated </p>
<p>that 36 civilians had died as a result of UK actions since 1 May 2003.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> The MOD was </p>
<p>now undertaking a “comprehensive assessment” of unit records to produce a more </p>
<p>accurate estimate; the outcome of that assessment would be shared with Ministers </p>
<p>in May.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> On 21 May, No.10 asked the FCO to “look again” at the question of civilian </p>
<p>casualty figures, and for a weekly “digest” of casualty figures.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The FCO replied on 26 May. It stated that CPA advisers to the Iraqi Ministry of </p>
<p>Health (MOH) had told the FCO that the MOH did not have reliable figures for civilian </p>
<p>deaths or their causes. The MOH was gradually re&#8209;establishing standard practices and </p>
<p>procedures, but those were still “very basic”.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> The FCO concluded that the UK did not have reliable figures for overall civilian </p>
<p>casualties. As the MOH improved its systems, it might be possible for the Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government (IIG) to determine numbers and causes of civilian deaths and injuries: </p>
<p>“But, for now, we are primarily reliant on NGO websites whose reliability we cannot </p>
<p>easily assess.”</p>
<p><b>112. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that the FCO provided a weekly digest on </p>
<p>civilian casualties to No.10.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> In response to a written question from Lord Lester of Herne Hill on whether the </p>
<p>CPA had access to hospital records detailing Iraqi civilian deaths and injuries and their </p>
<p>causes, Baroness Symons, FCO Minister of State, stated on 7 June:</p>
<p>“Coalition Provisional Authority advisers to the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MOH) do </p>
<p>have access to some figures on civilian deaths. However these statistics are not </p>
<p>reliable, as Iraqis often bury their deceased relatives without official notification/</p>
<p>registration. This has been particularly true during periods of heightened conflict. </p>
<p>The MOH does not therefore have accurate figures for civilian deaths or their </p>
<p>causes for the past year. The MOH is gradually re&#8209;establishing standard practices </p>
<p>and procedures, although these are basic. In the longer term the Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government may be able to evaluate the causes of civilian deaths and injuries.”</p>

<p><b>114. </b> Lord Lester followed up that reply by asking the UK Government to publish </p>
<p>the MOH statistics on Iraqi civilian deaths and injuries. Baroness Symons replied </p>
<p>on 24 June:</p>
<p>“There are no reliable figures for Iraqi civilian deaths since March 2003. The </p>
<p>Iraqi Ministry of Health has informed us that the number of civilians killed in </p>
<p>security incidents is 1,203 and 3,992 wounded dating from when statistics began </p>
<p>on 5 April 2004. However they reflect only hospital admissions and may not be </p>
<p>comprehensive. It is not possible to break these down into how they were killed or </p>
<p>who may have been responsible. It includes casualties caused by terrorist action.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>115. </b> The Occupation of Iraq formally came to an end on 28 June. Power was </p>
<p>transferred from the CPA and Iraqi Governing Council to the IIG.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>116. </b> On 6 October, the US media reported that the Iraqi MOH had recorded </p>
<p>3,487 insurgency&#8209;related deaths between 5 April, when the MOH began compiling data, </p>

<p>83</p>
<p> According to (unnamed) Iraqi officials, between 10 June (when </p>
<p>the MOH began compiling data on cause of death) and 10 September, 1,295 Iraqis had </p>
<p>been killed by “multinational forces and police” and 516 by “terrorist operations”. The </p>
<p>MOH defined terrorist operations as explosive devices in residential areas, car bombs </p>
<p>and assassinations.</p>
<p><b>117. </b> The US media reported that the MOH was “convinced” that nearly all of those </p>
<p>reported dead were civilians or police and Iraqi national guardsmen, rather than </p>
<p>insurgents; family members would often not report the death of a relative who had died </p>

<p><b>118. </b> No.10 wrote to the FCO on 11 October:</p>

<p>casualties because it believed that there was no reliable method for doing so, adding:</p>
<p>“This is not merely our public line but our genuine judgement.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> The official dismissed the suggestion, made by the FCO, that the civilian casualty </p>
<p>figures that were reported to the weekly Chiefs of Staff meeting could serve as a reliable </p>
<p>estimate of total civilian casualties. Those figures were compiled by the US based on </p>
<p>incomplete “reporting of incidents” to US Corps HQ. The figures were reported to Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff as trends in them indicated whether the security situation was improving or </p>
<p>deteriorating.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> The official concluded by re&#8209;stating:</p>
<p>“… the MOD does not produce an estimate of civilian casualties, either within </p>
<p>our own area of operation or across Iraq. We have no methodology which would </p>
<p>enable us to do this; nor do we believe it possible to define a methodology that </p>
<p>would produce figures meaningful enough to alleviate No.10’s concern about public </p>
<p>presentation.”</p>
<p><b>124. </b> The FCO replied to No.10 on 14 October, having consulted UK advisers in the </p>
<p>Iraqi MOH.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> The FCO recommended that the UK should not take any ownership of </p>
<p>figures of civilian casualties; none of the estimates available were reliable, and the UK </p>
<p>Government would have difficulty in defending the methodology behind them to the </p>
<p>media and Parliament.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> The UK would also have difficulty in compiling its own statistics:</p>
<p>“We rarely have our own people on the ground following terrorist attacks, often </p>
<p>relying on press statistics. But their figures result in widely varying estimates …”</p>
<p><b>126. </b> The FCO advised that it regarded hospital and mortuary admissions collated by </p>
<p>the Iraqi MOH as the “most reliable” figures available, although there were a number </p>
<p>of deficiencies:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Monthly and six&#8209;monthly MOH reports were not consistent.</p>

<p>Civilians who were taken to hospital injured and subsequently died were counted </p>
<p>as injured.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hospital staff had come under (unspecified) pressure to inflate casualty figures.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> The FCO also advised that the Iraqi MOH had publicly estimated that 3,617 Iraqi </p>
<p>civilians had been killed and 14,554 injured in the period from 5 April 2004 to </p>
<p>25 September 2004. An unpublished MOH estimate indicated that of those casualties, </p>
<p>516 had been killed and 2,016 injured in “terrorist attacks”.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> The FCO reported that the UK’s Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC) gave </p>
<p>“a very different estimate” of 1,125 fatalities caused by “foreign fighters” since the </p>
<p>beginning of 2004. Of those casualties, nearly 1,000 were civilians.</p>
<p><b>129. </b> The FCO concluded that the UK should be “wary” about being drawn into a debate </p>
<p>on which of those figures was accurate. Another unpublished MOH estimate indicated </p>
<p>that 1,295 Iraqi citizens had been killed and 5,479 injured in the period from 16 June </p>
<p>2004 to 10 September 2004 “in military action”:</p>
<p>“This is more than double the number they [the Iraqi MOH] estimate were killed </p>
<p>by terrorists. Although the figures include insurgents as well as civilians, the Iraqi </p>
<p>figures as they stand now will not help us make the case that more civilians have </p>
<p>been killed by terrorists than by military action.”</p>
<p><b>130. </b> The FCO continued:</p>
<p>“In sum, if we produce a figure that differs from the Iraqi Government figures, we will </p>
<p>have to defend it – and the way it was arrived at – before Parliament and the media </p>
<p>… We recommend that for the moment we continue to put our public emphasis on </p>
<p>specific atrocities against civilians …”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Mr David Quarrey, a Private Secretary to Mr Blair, passed the FCO’s advice to </p>
<p>Mr Blair the following day.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> Mr Quarrey commented:</p>
<p>“You asked for an assessment of civilian casualties in Iraq, noting that we cannot let </p>
<p>figures of 10–15,000 go unchallenged as if we are responsible for all of them …</p>
<p>“The FCO recommend that we stick to publicising terrorist responsibility for civilian </p>
<p>casualties in individual incidents. Underlying this is concern that any overall </p>
<p>assessment of civilian casualties will show that MNF [Multi&#8209;National Force – Iraq] </p>
<p>are responsible for significantly more than insurgents/terrorists.</p>
<p>“But we should be able to handle this better …”</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Mr Quarrey advised Mr Blair that he intended to ask the Cabinet Office to </p>
<p>convene a meeting of departments to initiate a trial period of monitoring daily statistics </p>

<p>then assess how “credible (and helpful) the information would be publicly”. Mr Quarrey </p>
<p>concluded:</p>
<p>“If the trial is successful, we could look at outsourcing to a credible external </p>
<p>organisation (e.g. a think&#8209;tank or academics).”</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Blair agreed that approach.</p>

<p>92</p>
<p> During the meeting, officials stated that there was </p>
<p>a risk that the UK might come under pressure to disclose publicly any conclusions that </p>
<p>were reached. Mr Quarrey told the meeting that No.10 believed that the UK needed to </p>
<p>make a “serious attempt to quantify what is happening”.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Officials agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “headline task” was to quantify, as precisely as possible, the number of </p>
<p>civilian deaths caused by a) insurgents and b) coalition military action (both </p>
<p>MNF – I and the Iraqi Security Forces).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The best way to do that was to break the task down. The FCO would report from </p>
<p>open sources, the MOD would report from Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) </p>
<p>(MND(SE))</p>
<p>93</p>

<p>94</p>
<p> The MOD’s position remained that it did not believe </p>
<p>it was possible to establish an accurate methodology for estimating the total number of </p>
<p>civilian casualties. Although incident reports could be analysed, there was a danger that:</p>
<p>“… once we have adopted a methodology, Parliament and the public would in future </p>
<p>expect us to apply this no matter what the intensity of the operation.”</p>

<p><b>138. </b> The official recalled the limitations of the incident&#8209;reporting process, and </p>
<p>concluded:</p>
<p>“… if HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] really does wish to get into the business of </p>
<p>challenging media and NGO statistics, we would need to open up discussions with </p>
<p>the US and other coalition partners on how to change the incident reporting process </p>

<p><b>139. </b> An FCO official wrote to the Cabinet Office on the same day, setting out how the </p>
<p>FCO intended to contribute to the trial.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> It would report figures compiled by NGOs and </p>
<p>the media but not amend them in any way. To do so would suggest that those NGO and </p>
<p>media figures had some reliability, when the UK’s public line was that they did not. Any </p>
<p>amendments would also make the figures releasable under the Freedom of Information </p>
<p>Act (which would come into effect the following year). The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“The focus of our work will instead be on the figures produced by the Iraqi Ministry </p>
<p>of Health (MOH) … these too have their limitations. However, we will work with the </p>
<p>MOH during the next few weeks to see if these statistics can be improved.”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> On 29 October, as the Government’s trial monitoring period got under way, </p>
<p><i>The Lancet</i> published a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health </p>
<p>entitled <i>Mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq: cluster sample survey</i> (the </p>
<p><i>Lancet</i> study).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>141. </b> The study was based on a survey of 988 households in 33 clusters. It found </p>
<p>that there had been 98,000 more deaths from all causes in Iraq than expected in the </p>
<p>18 months since the invasion (95 percent confidence interval 8,000–94,000) outside </p>
<p>of Fallujah. There would be “far more” deaths if data from the Fallujah cluster were </p>
<p>included.</p>
<p><b>142. </b> The<i> </i>study stated that violence accounted for most of the excess deaths, that </p>
<p>violent deaths were “mainly attributed” to coalition forces, and that most individuals </p>
<p>reportedly killed by coalition forces were women and children. On the causes of death, </p>
<p>the study stated:</p>
<p>“The major causes of death before the invasion were myocardial infarction, </p>
<p>cerebrovascular accidents, and other chronic disorders whereas after the invasion </p>
<p>violence was the primary cause of death.”</p>
<p><b>143. </b> There had been an increase in the infant mortality rate, from 29 deaths </p>

<p>196</p>
<p><b>144. </b> The study stated that there had been 53 deaths in the Fallujah cluster when only </p>
<p>1.4 had been expected. That indicated that there had been about 200,000 excess </p>
<p>deaths in Fallujah. However, the uncertainty in that estimate was “substantial”.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> On the same day, following a discussion with the MOD’s Director of News, </p>
<p>Professor Sir Roy Anderson, the MOD’s Chief Scientific Adviser (CSA), “quickly </p>
<p>reviewed” the study.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> His Private Secretary sent his conclusions to Mr Hoon’s Private </p>
<p>Office and senior MOD officials:</p>
<p>“CSA has concluded that the design of the study is robust … He therefore believes </p>
<p>that the paper is a sensible one … and that the results are probably as robust as one </p>
<p>could have achieved in the very difficult circumstances. He therefore recommends </p>
<p>that we should proceed with caution in publicly criticising the paper.</p>
<p>“He would, however, add three caveats. First, extrapolation from a very small sample </p>
<p>size to the whole of Iraq is a weakness … Second, there are weaknesses in the </p>
<p>way that deaths have been recorded … in many cases the only evidence of a death </p>
<p>having occurred, and of the cause of death, was the verbal information provided </p>
<p>from (not necessarily disinterested) family members. And finally … there were </p>
<p>excess of deaths amongst males, possibly indicating that some of those who died </p>
<p>were combatants rather than civilians.”</p>

<p><b>147. </b> The Iraqi Minister of Health issued a statement on 29 October, offering his </p>

<p>“Every hospital reports daily the number of civilians (which may include insurgents) </p>
<p>who have been killed or injured in terrorist incidents or as a result of military </p>
<p>action. All casualties are likely to be taken to hospital in these circumstances </p>
<p>except for some insurgents (who may fear arrest) and those with minor injuries. </p>
<p>The figures show that between 5 April 2004 and 5 October 2004, 3,853 civilians </p>
<p>were killed and 15,517 were injured. I am satisfied that this information is the most </p>
<p>reliable available.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>148. </b> The <i>Lancet </i>study, and the interest shown in it by the media and MPs, prompted a </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>for MND(SE). PJHQ collated the daily MNF&#8209;I reports for the weekly Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> The Cabinet Office was currently overseeing a trial to determine civilian casualties </p>
<p>in MND(SE). The MOD was, however, arguing that it could not provide either the MNF&#8209;I </p>
<p>or its own MND(SE) casualty figures to the exercise, as the US military did not allow </p>
<p>publication of country&#8209;wide information on civilian casualties on security grounds. The </p>
<p>MNF&#8209;I figures would in any case be unlikely to be comprehensive and did not show who </p>
<p>was responsible for civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> The UK’s current line was to rely on Iraqi MOH figures, though that might not </p>
<p>be sustainable in the face of increasing Parliamentary, NGO and media demands </p>
<p>that the UK release its own statistics. The current military operation in Fallujah was </p>
<p>increasing pressure on MNF&#8209;I to prove that it was making every effort to minimise civilian </p>
<p>casualties, and:</p>
<p>“There will be seen to be a certain plausibility in the argument that we can only do so </p>
<p>if we can provide credible (i.e. our own) figures for casualties.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Mr Asquith concluded that any estimate of casualties, other than from MOH and </p>
<p>NGO sources, would have to come from MNF&#8209;I, which was deployed throughout Iraq. </p>
<p>But the MOD had ruled out the use of the MNF&#8209;I figures. If the MOD felt there were good </p>
<p>reasons for holding back its own figures for MND(SE), it (rather than the FCO) should </p>
<p>explain those reasons to Parliament and to the public.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Asquith continued that if the FCO did accept the lead on handling civilian </p>
<p>casualty issues, it should be on three conditions:</p>
<p>“(a) </p>
<p>MOD to explore with DoD [the US Department of Defense] reverting to the </p>
<p>practice at the time of the first Gulf War when civilian casualties were released </p>
<p>into the public domain.</p>
<p>(b) </p>
<p>If DoD refuses, MOD to explain publicly (to Parliament) why it is not possible to </p>
<p>produce estimates from MNF&#8209;I sources.</p>
<p>(c) </p>
<p>FCO to lead on the handling of civilian casualties … But Ministers should </p>
<p>be clear that, in the absence of releasable data from military sources, we </p>
<p>will be heavily dependent on figures from the Iraqi MOH which will not be </p>
<p>comprehensive …”</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Mr Asquith advised Mr Straw in a separate minute on the same day:</p>
<p>“Legal Advisers say there are no obligations to report civilian casualties in the Fourth </p>
<p>Geneva Convention … or under any other provision of international humanitarian </p>
<p>law.</p>
<p>“While it is essential in advance of any particular attack to assess the likely civilian </p>
<p>casualties, there is no obligation after the event to make any assessment of either </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>the civilian casualties resulting from the attacks or of the overall civilian casualties </p>
<p>of a conflict.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Also on 8 November, Mr Straw chaired a meeting with FCO officials including </p>
<p>Mr Creon Butler, the FCO’s Chief Economist, to discuss the scope of a Written </p>
<p>Ministerial Statement that he would make on 17 November, responding to the <i>Lancet</i> </p>
<p>study.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>164. </b> After the meeting, Mr Butler sent Mr Straw’s Private Secretary his “initial thoughts” </p>
<p>on the <i>Lancet </i>study.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> Mr Butler stated that “the statistical methodology appears sound” </p>
<p>and concluded:</p>
<p>“In commenting on the study we should certainly continue to emphasise the </p>
<p>considerable uncertainty around the central estimate [of 98,000 excess deaths] </p>
<p>(reflecting the small sample size), as well as the lack of corroborating evidence – </p>
<p>particularly evidence of injured in the numbers one might expect. We could also </p>
<p>highlight some of the factors which might bias the study towards an over&#8209;estimate of </p>
<p>deaths. However, there are as many reasons why the study might be biased in the </p>
<p>other direction (so probably safer not to go down this road).”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Mr Butler stated that the “lack of corroborating evidence” related in particular to </p>
<p>the apparent mismatch between the central estimate of 98,000 excess deaths and the </p>
<p>much lower estimates based on press reporting and the lack of anecdotal evidence for </p>
<p>large numbers of injured Iraqi citizens attending Iraqi hospitals. The latter mismatch was </p>
<p>“much harder to explain”.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Mr Butler considered how the estimates presented in the <i>Lancet </i>study might be </p>
<p>validated and refined using data from other sources. He concluded:</p>
<p>“In the absence of a detailed census (impossible in the current security </p>
<p>environment), the best way of narrowing down the uncertainty … is likely to be to </p>
<p>conduct a similar survey with a significantly larger sample.”</p>
<p><b>167. </b> On 9 November, the MOD sent the Cabinet Office a summary of incident reports </p>
<p>for MND(SE) for the seven days up to 7 November, as part of the trial monitoring </p>
<p>period.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> There had been no incidents involving civilian fatalities; two civilians had been </p>
<p>injured in an (unspecified) accident.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> On 11 November, Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon discussed which department </p>
<p>should be responsible for work on casualty figures.</p>
<p>112</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>with Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, to secure the MOD’s agreement </p>
<p>to take on that responsibility.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> At Cabinet on 11 November, Mr Straw told colleagues that he would be making </p>
<p>a Written Ministerial Statement on the estimate of civilian casualties published by </p>
<p><i>The Lancet</i>, and that he proposed to make more use of the Iraqi MOH figures, which </p>
<p>were “more reliable”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>170. </b> On 12 November, the Iraq Senior Officials Group agreed that there was “potential </p>
<p>advantage” in making more use of the Iraqi MOH’s figures, but the UK needed to </p>
<p>recognise the presentational difficulties of using those figures while “using US figures for </p>
<p>internal planning purposes without publicly acknowledging their existence”.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> It would be </p>
<p>useful to compare the MOH figures with those produced for the Chiefs of Staff by PJHQ.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Straw issued a Written Ministerial Statement on 17 November, responding to </p>
<p>the <i>Lancet </i>study.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> Mr Straw stated that during the period of major combat operations, </p>
<p>the Coalition had made every effort to minimise civilian casualties. He continued:</p>
<p>“Casualties – civilian and military – which have occurred since major combat </p>
<p>operations ended on 1 May 2003 have done so directly as a result of those </p>
<p>determined to undermine the political process.”</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Straw rejected the suggestion in the <i>Lancet</i> study that there was a legal </p>
<p>obligation (deriving from Article 27 of the fourth Geneva Convention) for the MNF&#8209;I to </p>
<p>assess civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Mr Straw stated that the UK Government shared the Iraqi Minister of Health’s view, </p>
<p>expressed in his 29 October statement, that the MOH’s information was the most reliable </p>
<p>available. The “running estimate” provided by IBC “suggested” that between 14,284 and </p>
<p>16,419 Iraqi civilians had died since March 2003. While that was “an estimate relying on </p>
<p>media reports, and which we do not regard as reliable”, IBC’s figures did show that the </p>
<p>Iraqi MOH’s figures were not the only ones to differ widely from those presented in the </p>
<p><i>Lancet</i> study.</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Mr Straw stated that the methodology used in the <i>Lancet</i> study had passed </p>
<p><i>The Lancet’s</i> peer review process and was similar to that used in other cases, but </p>
<p>questioned the data that the survey had produced and hence the findings of the study.</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Dr John Reid, the Health Secretary, sent an assessment of the <i>Lancet</i> study to </p>
<p>Mr Straw on 29 November.</p>

<p>201</p>
<p>commissioned, had been produced by Dr Bill Kirkup, one of the Department of Health’s </p>
<p>Regional Directors of Public Health and its lead on health in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Dr Kirkup’s assessment was more detailed and more critical of the <i>Lancet </i></p>
<p>study than the assessments undertaken earlier by Professor Anderson and Mr Butler. </p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<p>“Less than a thousand [households] … is a small number on which to base death </p>
<p>rates … The confidence intervals are correspondingly very wide … A confidence </p>
<p>interval this large makes the meaning of the estimate very difficult to interpret …</p>
<p>“Cluster sampling may not be appropriate when there is a large element of </p>
<p>discontinuity in the population experience. Clearly, some parts of Iraq have seen </p>
<p>much more violence than others …”</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Dr Kirkup stated that, according to his calculations, the study’s conclusion that </p>
<p>“violence accounted for most of the excess deaths” was only true if the “bizarre” Fallujah </p>
<p>cluster was included (the study stated that that cluster was not included in its central </p>
<p>estimate of 98,000 excess deaths). Dr Kirkup calculated that if the Fallujah cluster </p>
<p>was not included, just over 23,000 of the 98,000 estimated excess deaths were due </p>
<p>to violence.</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Dr Kirkup stated that it was not possible, from the data provided in the study, to </p>
<p>confirm the study’s conclusion that “air strikes from coalition forces accounted for most </p>
<p>violent deaths”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Dr Kirkup explained his characterisation of the Fallujah projection as “bizarre”. The </p>
<p>study estimated that there had been 200,000 excess deaths in Fallujah (using the same </p>
<p>techniques as for other areas). That would represent a loss of nearly 28 percent of the </p>
<p>population of Fallujah in just 14 months. Dr Kirkup commented: “Something has plainly </p>
<p>gone so badly wrong with the estimates in Fallujah that it must cast doubt on the validity </p>
<p>of the rest of the findings.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Dr Kirkup concluded:</p>
<p>“… the paper suffers from wide confidence intervals, dubious methodology, the </p>
<p>likelihood of significant respondent bias and results that are disastrously skewed by </p>
<p>the Fallujah outlier. The authors have been tempted into extrapolations based on </p>
<p>shaky data that lack face validity, and in two cases are not even borne out by their </p>
<p>own results.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>Indirect effects of conflict on public health</b></p>
<p>The health charity Medact considered the direct and indirect effects of the conflict in Iraq </p>
<p>in its November 2003 report <i>Continuing collateral damage: the health and environmental </i></p>
<p><i>costs of war on Iraq 2003</i>.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> That report outlined the indirect effects on health arising from:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to the environment, including through the use of depleted uranium </p>
<p>ammunition;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to Iraq’s water and sanitation and power infrastructure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the continuing risk of malnutrition and food insecurity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to housing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to health services.</p>
<p>The report stated that 7 percent of hospitals had been damaged during the major combat </p>
<p>phase of operations, and 12 percent had been looted. UNICEF had reported that the </p>
<p>conflict had led to the breakdown of the cold chain system for storing vaccines, which </p>
<p>meant that some 210,000 newborns had had no immunisations and were at risk from </p>
<p>preventable diseases such as measles.</p>
<p>The report also outlined the physiological and social impacts of the war, and suggested </p>
<p>that Iraq would experience a rise in behavioural and emotional disorders.</p>
<p>Although the report did not attempt to quantify those indirect effects, many of which would </p>
<p>only become apparent over the long term, it concluded that they could prove to be more </p>
<p>significant than the direct effects.</p>
<p>The report made a number of recommendations, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establish health information systems to monitor disease incidence and examine </p>
<p>disease patterns in order to plan effective public health interventions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Carry out an assessment of the country’s chemical risks and levels of </p>
<p>contamination in addition to surveillance of health effects of environmental risk </p>
<p>factors including depleted uranium.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Fund and rapidly implement the clear&#8209;up of all unexploded ordnance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Study long&#8209;term effects of the war on mental health and trends in domestic </p>
<p>and criminal violence, and develop effective health care and social policy </p>
<p>interventions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Fund independent academic institutions or UN agencies to continue monitoring </p>
<p>the health effects of war.”</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Discussions continued between senior officials in the FCO and MOD over who </p>
<p>should have responsibility for answering questions on civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>182. </b> The “Count the Casualties” campaign was launched by Medact and IBC on </p>
<p>8 December, through an open letter to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> The letter stated that without counting </p>

<p>the dead and injured, it was not possible to know whether the UK was meeting its </p>
<p>obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in </p>
<p>Iraq. It urged the Government to commission a comprehensive, independent inquiry to </p>
<p>determine how many Iraqi citizens had died or been injured since March 2003, and the </p>
<p>cause of those casualties.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> The campaign also argued that information on casualties was needed to plan </p>
<p>healthcare in Iraq.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>184. </b> At Prime Minister’s Questions on the same day, Mr Blair said that he did not agree </p>
<p>that the UK needed to hold a full, independent inquiry into civilian casualties to comply </p>
<p>with its international legal obligations, and stated that the figures from the Iraqi MOH </p>
<p>were the most accurate available.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> He continued:</p>
<p>“… those who are killing innocent people in Iraq today … are the terrorists and </p>
<p>insurgents … Any action that the multinational force or the Iraqi Army is taking in Iraq </p>
<p>is intended to defeat those people …”</p>
<p><b>185. </b> The IPU provided the Cabinet Office with a contribution to the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>trial on 13 December.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> The IPU analysis captured casualty figures for the five weeks </p>
<p>from 1 November, sourced from the Iraqi MOH, the BBC, IBC, the Iraq Coalition </p>
<p>Casualty Count project and Sky News. The casualty figures were broken down into two </p>
<p>categories: killed by insurgents; and killed by coalition forces.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> The total casualty figures produced by the Iraqi MOH were the highest among the </p>
<p>five sources in four of the five weeks.</p>
<p><b>187. </b> The figures produced by the Iraqi MOH showed that casualties caused by the </p>
<p>coalition were higher than casualties caused by insurgents in four of the five weeks. </p>
<p>Figures from all other sources showed that casualties caused by insurgents were higher </p>
<p>than casualties caused by the coalition in all five weeks.</p>
<p><b>188. </b> The IPU commented that, apart from the Iraqi MOH, the sources were “of no real </p>
<p>value”. The comparison of the figures did suggest, however, that the Iraqi MOH figures </p>
<p>were incomplete. This could be due to delayed reporting of deaths at hospitals or bodies </p>
<p>not being taken to hospitals. The Iraqi MOH had reported that its figures did not include </p>
<p>the Kurdish provinces.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> The IPU also commented that the analysis would not answer the demands from </p>
<p>MPs and others that the UK should produce its own estimate of Iraqi civilian casualties. </p>
<p>The only way a proper comparative analysis of the Iraqi MOH figures could be made </p>
<p>was to set them alongside figures produced by the US and UK military.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>190. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that the Cabinet Office trial was taken further.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> A detailed brief on civilian casualties produced for Mr Blair on 18 December in </p>
<p>advance of his visit to Iraq made no mention of the trial or its conclusions.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>192. </b> An IPU official informed Mr Straw’s Private Office on 15 December that the MOD </p>
<p>was now ready to “step forward and explain why it is impossible for us to use our military </p>
<p>assets in Iraq to get an estimate [of civilian casualties]”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> The official commented that </p>
<p>this was welcome. It would force the MOD to take some responsibility for managing one </p>
<p>of the “bear&#8209;traps” in the UK’s existing policy:</p>
<p>“… although we say there are no reliable estimates of civilian casualties in Iraq, </p>
<p>there are estimates of a kind that are made by MND(SE) and others made by </p>
<p>the Pentagon. They’re unreliable but are used for military planning purposes as </p>
<p>evidence of trends …”</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Ingram made that statement on 27 January 2005, in response to a question </p>
<p>from Mr Peter Kilfoyle.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> Mr Ingram stated that an analysis of incident reports between </p>
<p>1 May 2003 and 26 November 2004 indicated that 200 Iraqi citizens believed to have </p>
<p>been enemy combatants had died, and 80 had been injured, in incidents where military </p>
<p>force had been deliberately applied by UK forces. Five Iraqi citizens believed not to </p>
<p>have been enemy combatants had died, and a further 13 had been injured, in incidents </p>
<p>during the course of which military force had been deliberately applied by UK forces. </p>
<p>These figures did not necessarily indicate that UK forces caused the casualties, only that </p>
<p>they recorded them during the course of incidents in which deliberate military force was </p>
<p>applied.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr Ingram also stated that 17 Iraqi citizens believed to have been enemy </p>
<p>combatants had died, and 22 had been injured, during the course of other incidents, </p>
<p>and 144 Iraqi citizens believed not to have been enemy combatants had died, and </p>
<p>192 had been injured, during the course of other incidents. This included the full range </p>
<p>of incidents in which UK forces had been involved but where no deliberate military force </p>
<p>had been applied, for example Improvised Explosive Device attacks by insurgent forces </p>
<p>on civilian targets, road traffic accidents and in one case the discovery in May 2003 of a </p>
<p>mass grave, thought to date back to 1991, containing 32 bodies.</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Ingram stated that those figures should not be taken as an accurate estimate </p>
<p>of Iraqi casualties; they captured only those casualties which were witnessed or </p>
<p>discovered by UK forces. The figures did not include the major combat operations phase </p>
<p>of Op TELIC, prior to 1 May 2003, for which incident reports were not routinely submitted </p>
<p>when casualties were “discovered”.</p>

<p>2003) wrote to Mr Straw on 13 January 2005 to express her support for the Count the </p>
<p>Casualties campaign.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Straw replied on 3 March:</p>
<p>“We have never made our own assessment of Iraqi casualties … This is because, </p>
<p>after careful consideration of the different means of calculating casualties, we </p>
<p>decided that the current circumstances would prevent a valid assessment by the </p>
<p>UK …”</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Straw advised that the MOD had now published overall casualty figures drawn </p>
<p>from military incident reports. The UK military aimed to minimise civilian casualties by </p>
<p>using careful targeting procedures. Target clearance procedures considered targets on </p>
<p>an individual basis; the MOD did not believe that an estimate of casualties in Iraq as a </p>
<p>whole would help them to evaluate those targeting procedures.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Mr Asquith discussed civilian casualties with Dr Kirkup on 21 March.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> Dr Kirkup </p>
<p>“rebutted” the suggestion that an accurate assessment of casualties would be “an </p>
<p>essential element of assessing and improving the current health situation in Iraq”. </p>
<p>He confirmed that the Iraqi MOH’s figures provided “the most reliable assessment [of </p>
<p>casualties] currently available”.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> Dr Kirkup identified four sources of information on casualties:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi MOH’s systems for recording deaths, which had been reasonably </p>
<p>sound before the conflict but had “taken a serious hit” and were only now </p>
<p>recovering;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>civil registration (death certificates): there was no reliable civil registration </p>
<p>system;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>surveys: the security situation was not conducive to effective research, in </p>
<p>particular by limiting the scope to obtain the necessary range of data and by </p>
<p>introducing interviewee bias; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>figures from the military: “[those] would help to provide a more complete picture </p>
<p>of the causes of death and whether deaths had actually occurred. When dealing </p>
<p>with incomplete data it is important to have as many sources as possible.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Asquith and Dr Kirkup also considered possible areas of assistance to the Iraqi </p>
<p>health service, including data collection and analysis.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The record of the meeting concluded: “Our position on assessing Iraqi casualty </p>

<p>“Assurances that military forces ‘make every effort to avoid civilian casualties’ are no </p>
<p>substitute for real data&#8209;gathering and analysis, and can have no basis without it. On </p>
<p>the eve of the invasion Tony Blair stated that ‘[Saddam Hussein] will be responsible </p>
<p>for many, many more deaths even in one year than we will be in any conflict’. Only </p>

<p><b>210. </b> The US Government was required under the Emergency Supplemental </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>217. </b> The UK became one of 15 members of the “Core Group” charged with steering the </p>
<p>Geneva Declaration process and guiding its implementation.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>218. <i></b> The Lancet</i> published the second Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public </p>
<p>Health cluster sample survey of excess mortality in Iraq (direct and indirect, violent and </p>
<p>non&#8209;violent deaths) on 12 October 2006.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> The first Johns Hopkins study had been </p>
<p>published by <i>The Lancet</i> in October 2004.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> The second study used the same (cluster sample survey) methodology as the </p>
<p>first study, but was based on a larger sample (1,849 households as against 988 in the </p>
<p>first study).</p>
<p><b>220. </b> The study estimated that between March 2003 and June 2006, there had been </p>
<p>654,965 excess Iraqi deaths and 601,027 excess violent Iraqi deaths as a consequence </p>
<p>of the war. The study attributed 31 percent of violent excess deaths to the coalition, </p>
<p>24 percent to “other” and 45 percent to “unknown”. The study also concluded that levels </p>
<p>of violence were increasing.</p>
<p><b>Criticisms of the <i>Lancet</i> studies</b></p>
<p>The 2004 and 2006 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health studies published </p>
<p>by <i>The Lancet</i> have been subject to several criticisms. The most significant are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the baseline pre&#8209;invasion mortality rate used by the studies was lower than the </p>
<p>actual pre&#8209;invasion mortality rate, leading to an over&#8209;estimation of excess mortality </p>
<p>in the post&#8209;invasion period. The second study used a pre&#8209;invasion mortality rate of </p>
<p>5.5 deaths per thousand people.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> The 2008 Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS) used </p>
<p>a figure of nine deaths per thousand.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the sample sizes were too small. The 2004 <i>Lancet</i> study (central estimate </p>
<p>98,000 excess deaths) surveyed 988 households and the 2006 <i>Lancet</i> study (central </p>
<p>estimate 655,000 excess deaths) surveyed 1,849 households. The 2008 IFHS </p>
<p>(central estimate 151,000 excess violent deaths) surveyed 9,345 households. The </p>
<p>IFHS team highlighted the implications of that difference in scale: “The estimated </p>
<p>number of deaths in the IFHS is about three times as high as that reported by the </p>
<p>Iraq Body Count. Both sources indicate that the 2006 study by Burnham et al [the </p>
<p>second <i>Lancet</i> study] considerably overestimated the number of violent deaths. For </p>
<p>instance, to reach the 925 violent deaths per day reported by Burnham et al for June </p>
<p>2005 through June 2006, as many as 87 percent of violent deaths would have been </p>
<p>missed in the IFHS and more than 90 percent in the Iraq Body Count. This level of </p>
<p>underreporting is highly improbable, given the internal and external consistency of </p>
<p>the data and the much larger same size and quality&#8209;control measures taken in the </p>
<p>implementation of the IFHS.”</p>

<p><b>221. </b> An Iraqi Government spokesperson commented on 12 October that “these figures </p>
<p>[in the study] are unrealistic and give a very exaggerated picture”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>222. </b> A DFID Statistics Adviser provided advice on the study to IPU on 12 October, at </p>
<p>their request.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> He concluded that “in essence, the method is tried and tested”.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> Professor Anderson provided his views on the study the following day.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> He stated </p>
<p>that he had received comments on the study from an independent expert on statistical </p>
<p>epidemiology and demography. Professor Anderson advised:</p>
<p>“… the study design is robust and employs methods that are regarded as close to </p>
<p>‘best practice’ in this area, given the difficulties of data collection and verification in </p>
<p>the present circumstances in Iraq … The methods are an improvement on those </p>
<p>used in the 2004 <i>Lancet</i> article by the same author …”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Professor Anderson advised that deaths were much more prevalent among </p>
<p>adolescent to middle&#8209;aged men and suggested that bias might remain with respect to </p>
<p>the level of non&#8209;combatant mortality.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Professor Anderson concluded that, given the reasonably robust study design </p>
<p>and appropriate analysis methods, the UK Government should be cautious in publicly </p>
<p>criticising the <i>Lancet</i> study.</p>
<p><b>226. </b> An IPU official produced a brief on the study for Mr Blair later on 13 October.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The brief summarised the advice from the DFID Statistics Adviser and </p>
<p>Professor Anderson, and identified several “key points”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… People are dying at the hands of those who choose violence to pursue their </p>
<p>aims …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There are conflicting estimates [of the number of civilian casualties] from a </p>
<p>number of sources, and no comprehensive or accurate figures;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The numbers that the <i>Lancet </i>has extrapolated are a substantial leap from other </p>
<p>figures. There is no reason to assume the <i>Lancet</i> figure is any more accurate </p>
<p>than any other is.”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> The same IPU official wrote to colleagues on 16 October:</p>
<p>“… we do not (not) accept that the figures quoted in the <i>Lancet</i> survey are </p>

<p><b>228. </b> On 18 October, in response to a Parliamentary Question from Sir Menzies </p>

<p><b>229. </b> Researchers at Oxford University (Mr Sean Gourley and Professor Neil Johnson) </p>
<p>and Royal Holloway, University of London (Professor Spagat) issued a press release </p>
<p>on 19 October, claiming that there were “serious flaws” in the methodology used by the </p>
<p><i>Lancet</i> study which acted to inflate its casualty estimate.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>230. </b> In response to a question from Mr Jeremy Corbyn on 6 November, Mr Ingram set </p>
<p>out the Government’s position on the <i>Lancet</i> study:</p>
<p>“Maintaining records of civilian deaths in Iraq is ultimately a matter for the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq and we believe they are best placed to monitor the situation. </p>
<p>The<i> Lancet</i> report is one of a number of recent studies … none of which can be </p>
<p>regarded as definitive. The figures in the <i>Lancet </i>report are significantly higher than </p>
<p>other casualty estimates.”</p>

<p>request for further advice on the study in the light of the public exchanges since its </p>

<p>146</p>
<p> Professor Anderson wrote to Mr Straw on 19 March, stating that while </p>
<p>there was “clearly a possibility of [sampling] bias”:</p>
<p>“I reiterate my earlier advice, which acknowledged that bias and moderate </p>

<p><b>235. </b> A 2008 RAND report, sponsored by the Office of the US Secretary of Defense, </p>

<p>“Because protecting the population is one of the central tenets of US COIN </p>

<p>studies, the 2008 Iraq Family Health Survey (IFHS) Study Group and IBC. RAND went </p>
<p>on to present its own dataset, which combined the RAND Terrorism Knowledge Base </p>
<p>with the IBC dataset. RAND drew a number of observations and conclusions from the </p>
<p>consolidated dataset, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US military had devoted considerable effort to defeating Improvised </p>
<p>Explosive Device (IEDs), yet IEDs accounted for only 5 percent of civilian </p>
<p>fatalities in 2006. Firearms accounted for 58 percent of civilian deaths in 2006. </p>
<p>RAND concluded that while measures to defeat IEDs might save coalition lives, </p>
<p>they might not be useful for reducing civilian fatalities; the coalition and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government needed to implement measures to counter the types of attacks that </p>
<p>were claiming civilian lives.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The insurgency was specifically targeting the Iraqi Government and the Iraqi </p>
<p>economy. Over 30 percent of insurgent attacks were aimed at these two aspects </p>

<p>Most violence was directed at “for lack of a better word, the common Iraqi </p>
<p>civilian”. For over 50 percent of the individuals killed in 2006 there was “… no </p>
<p>identifying data, no apparent or recorded reason, and no discernible affiliation </p>
<p>or target. All we know of these people is that they were killed; this fact alone </p>
<p>suggests that our capacity to understand, analyze, and effectively respond to the </p>

<p><b>237. </b> In April 2009, researchers from King’s College London, Royal Holloway, University </p>

<p>the nature and effects of various weapons.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> The researchers concluded that in events with at least one Iraqi non&#8209;combatant </p>
<p>civilian casualty, the methods that killed the most non&#8209;combatant civilians per event </p>
<p>were aerial bombing (17 per event), combined use of aerial and ground weapons </p>
<p>(17 per event) and suicide bombers on foot (16 per event). Aerial bombs killed on </p>
<p>average nine more non&#8209;combatant civilians per event (17) than aerial missiles (8). </p>
<p>The team commented:</p>
<p>“It seems clear from these findings that to protect civilians from indiscriminate </p>
<p>harm, as required by international humanitarian law … military and civilian policies </p>
<p>should prohibit aerial bombing in civilian areas unless it can be demonstrated – by </p>
<p>monitoring of civilian casualties for example – that civilians are being protected.”</p>

<p><b>Witness comment</b></p>
<p><b>239. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Ingram, Minister for the Armed Forces from June 2001 to </p>
<p>June 2007, why the UK Government had been unable to produce an estimate of civilian </p>
<p>casualties when other organisations including NGOs and academic organisations had </p>
<p>done so, in particular given the public interest on the issue.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Ingram told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The idea that somehow or other an NGO is the fount of all wisdom and knowledge </p>
<p>and accuracy I don’t think stands up.</p>
<p>“So if we were going to take the figures from external sources, then we would have </p>
<p>had to put effort and verification into that. Should we have done so? Perhaps, yes, </p>
<p>and I’m not so sure it wasn’t being done …”</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Ingram added that establishing the number of civilian casualties would not have </p>
<p>changed the reality on the ground:</p>
<p>“… the concept of ground truth is absolutely vital in this and, by establishing that </p>
<p>fact, wouldn’t have altered where we were. Because we couldn’t, in one sense, </p>
<p>easily have stopped the civilian casualties because it wasn’t being carried out by us </p>
<p>on the civilians, it was being carried out by the tribal wars, the family feuds, by the </p>
<p>Sunni/Shia factionalism that was taking place, by the Shia on Shia factionalism that </p>
<p>was taking place, but we … were being vilified, attacked and criticised that we had </p>
<p>precipitated all of this.</p>
<p>“I have to say I believe that to be a false logic, because that may have happened </p>
<p>at any time under Saddam Hussein and, therefore, the establishment of the facts </p>
<p>perhaps should have been carried out by – elsewhere in Government. I don’t really </p>
<p>think it was an MOD function in that sense.”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Ingram whether the Government would not have been better </p>
<p>placed than external organisations to develop credible estimates of civilian casualties, </p>
<p>and asked which department within government should have been responsible for </p>
<p>producing such estimates. Mr Ingram told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“You [the responsible department] have then to go to the hospitals. You then have </p>
<p>to put civilians or a military person at that hospital counting the bodies in and the </p>
<p>bodies out. So you need force protection to do that. You put people at risk to do that. </p>
<p>Is that what people wanted, soldiers or civilians being killed at hospitals? Because </p>
<p>they would have been at risk.</p>

<p>“So there were points at which, yes, it would have been desirable, but how do you </p>
<p>achieve that objective? Do you put other lives at risk to do that? I would say no.”</p>
<p><b>243. </b> The Inquiry asked if it was the MOD’s function to develop estimates of civilian </p>
<p>casualties, or that of another department. Mr Ingram told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Unquestionably. Is it something that DFID could have funded? Is it something the </p>
<p>FCO should have taken ownership care of? The UN had become engaged – it was </p>
<p>still engaged, but not in terms of presence on the ground – is it a role that they </p>
<p>should have played? Yes. Of course the answer to that is yes.</p>
<p>“But what – the very establishment of the facts would not have changed what was </p>
<p>happening. It would have confirmed what everyone knew, but it wouldn’t have led to </p>
<p>a solution …”</p>
<p><b>Records and estimates of the number of Iraqi fatalities</b></p>
<p><b>Approaches to determining fatalities due to conflict</b></p>
<p>There are two broad approaches to determining the number of fatalities attributable to a </p>
<p>conflict:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Incident, or passive, reporting. This approach, which aims to capture direct </p>
<p>conflict deaths, typically involves the collation of reports from the media, other </p>
<p>non&#8209;government and government sources. Its accuracy depends in part on the </p>
<p>accuracy and completeness of those reports. Access to conflict&#8209;affected areas </p>
<p>(or to particular communities) may be difficult, and there may be pressure to </p>
<p>distort information. Incident reporting frequently undercounts the number of </p>
<p>direct conflict deaths.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Estimates derived from a survey of part of a population. This approach </p>
<p>typically aims to estimate the number of excess deaths caused by conflict, </p>
<p>by extrapolating from the data produced by a survey. Those excess deaths </p>
<p>would include both direct deaths (caused by war&#8209;related injuries) and indirect </p>
<p>deaths (caused by the worsening of social, economic and health conditions in </p>
<p>a conflict&#8209;affected area). The accuracy of such estimates can be undermined </p>
<p>by a lack of detailed, baseline mortality data (and conflicts often occur in areas </p>
<p>without such information, or lead to the disintegration of the systems which </p>
<p>provide it), the selection of an unrepresentative sample, the methodology used, </p>
<p>and the conduct of the survey.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The IBC project, founded in 2003 by UK and US volunteers, aims to record the </p>

<p>154</p>

<p>available on its website.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> IBC has publicly stated that while its database cannot provide a complete </p>
<p>record of violent civilian deaths, it does provide an “irrefutable baseline of certain and </p>
<p>undeniable deaths based on the solidity of our sources and the conservativeness of </p>
<p>our methodology”.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>246. </b> IBC continually updates its figures as new information becomes available. As at </p>

<p><b>247. </b> As apparent from the material addressed earlier in this Section, estimates of the </p>
<p>number of fatalities caused by conflict in Iraq after 2003 vary substantially.</p>
<p><b>248. </b> In October 2004, <i>The Lancet</i> published a study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg </p>
<p>School of Public Health entitled <i>Mortality before and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq: </i></p>
<p><i>cluster sample survey</i>.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> The study was based on a survey of 988 households in </p>
<p>33 clusters. It estimated that there had been 98,000 more deaths from all causes in </p>
<p>Iraq than expected in the 18 months since the invasion (95 percent confidence interval </p>
<p>8,000–94,000). That estimate did not include data from one cluster in Fallujah.</p>
<p><b>249. </b> In October 2006, <i>The Lancet</i> published a second study by the Johns Hopkins </p>
<p>Bloomberg School of Public Health.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> The study used the same (cluster sample survey) </p>
<p>methodology as the first study but was based on a larger sample.</p>
<p><b>250. </b> The study estimated that between March 2003 and June 2006, there had been </p>
<p>654,965 excess Iraqi deaths and 601,027 excess violent Iraqi deaths as a consequence </p>
<p>of the conflict.</p>
<p><b>251. </b> The IFHS was undertaken in 2006 and 2007 by the Iraqi Government in </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>estimate of violent (direct) deaths in Iraq.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> It estimated that, between 2003 and 2007, </p>
<p>at least 87,000 direct conflict deaths had occurred.</p>
<p><b>254. </b> The report also considered indirect deaths, and commented on the difference </p>
<p>between the figures reported by the two <i>Lancet</i> studies and the IFHS:</p>
<p>“At first glance, such a wide range seems to imply that the exact number of deaths </p>
<p>due to violence remains unknown. But the quality and reliability of these surveys is </p>
<p>not equal. The most recent study (2008) [the IFHS] surveyed 9,345 households, and </p>
<p>was conducted under the auspices of the World Health Organization. The previous </p>
<p>two studies [the <i>Lancet </i>studies], both conducted under difficult circumstances and </p>
<p>with limited resources, surveyed 990 (2004) and 1,849 (2006) households. The </p>
<p>gain in precision with greater numbers of households surveyed in the 2008 study </p>
<p>is obvious …”</p>
<p><b>255. </b> The report estimated that there had been more than 150,000 indirect deaths </p>
<p>in Iraq between March 2003 and March 2008 (with a wide possible range between </p>
<p>80,000 and 234,000).</p>
<p><b>256. </b> A further analysis was undertaken in 2013 by a team of American, Canadian and </p>
<p>Iraqi researchers, based on a sample of 2,000 households.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> Unlike earlier studies, </p>
<p>this was undertaken when the situation on the ground was relatively calm. The study </p>
<p>concluded that there had been 461,000 excess deaths from 2003 to 2011. Most excess </p>
<p>deaths were due to direct violence but about a third resulted from indirect causes, such </p>
<p>as the failures of health, sanitation, transportation, communication and other systems.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> About a third of the deaths due to direct violence were attributed to coalition forces </p>
<p>(some 90,000), and a third to militias. The study reported that at the peak of the conflict </p>
<p>men faced a 2.9 percent higher risk of death than they did before the war and women a </p>
<p>0.7 percent higher risk of death.</p>
<p><b>258. </b> The majority (63 percent) of violent deaths were the result of gunshot with </p>
<p>12 percent attributed to car bombs.</p>
<p><b>Non&#8209;Iraqi civilian fatalities</b></p>
<p><b>259. </b> The Inquiry is not aware of any comprehensive list of non&#8209;Iraqi civilian casualties, </p>
<p>or of UK civilian casualties in Iraq. The UK Government did not maintain a record of </p>

<p>165</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>264. </b> In a series of Assessments in the second half of 2002, the Joint Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee identified the possibility of significant civilian casualties in the event of a </p>
<p>Coalition attack on Iraq, in particular as a result of Iraqi use of chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons, the implementation of a scorched earth policy, and disorder after the end of </p>
<p>major combat operations.</p>
<p><b>265. </b> The MOD made only a broad estimate of direct civilian casualties arising from an </p>
<p>attack on Iraq, based on previous operations.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> In the months before the invasion, Mr Blair emphasised the need to minimise the </p>
<p>number of civilian casualties arising from an invasion of Iraq. He repeatedly asked the </p>
<p>MOD for details on the accuracy of the weapons that the UK would use, the targeting </p>
<p>policy and guidelines, and the estimated number of civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Sections 6.1 and 6.2 consider the MOD’s responses, which offered </p>
<p>reassurance based on the tight targeting procedures governing the air campaign. </p>
<p>Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff, advised Mr Blair on 25 February </p>
<p>2003 that civilian casualties were likely to be in the “low hundreds”.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>268. </b> In his public statements before the invasion, Mr Blair suggested that the number </p>
<p>of civilians who would be killed in any conflict should be set in the context of the number </p>
<p>of civilians who had been killed by Saddam Hussein’s regime or were dying as a result </p>
<p>of its policies. On the eve of the invasion, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein “will </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>be responsible for many, many more deaths even in one year than we will be in any </p>
<p>conflict”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>269. </b> In November 2003, in response to media and NGO reporting on the high levels </p>
<p>of civilian casualties, the Government began to consider whether and how it should </p>
<p>respond to demands for information on the number of civilians killed in Iraq, including the </p>
<p>number killed by UK forces.</p>
<p><b>270. </b> That consideration was driven by the Government’s concern to sustain domestic </p>
<p>support for operations in Iraq. Mr Straw and Mr Hoon agreed in November 2003 that the </p>
<p>Government needed to produce accurate casualty figures to rebut claims that Coalition </p>
<p>Forces were killing large numbers of civilians; in October 2004, Mr Blair stated that </p>
<p>the Government needed an estimate of civilian casualties which showed the extent of </p>
<p>insurgent responsibility.</p>
<p><b>271. </b> With hindsight, greater efforts should have been made in the post&#8209;conflict period to </p>
<p>determine the number of civilian casualties and the broader effects of military operations </p>
<p>on civilians. A trial monitoring exercise initiated by No.10 in November 2004 was not </p>
<p>completed. Much more Ministerial and senior official time was devoted to the question </p>
<p>of which department should have responsibility for the issue of civilian casualties than to </p>
<p>efforts to determine the actual number.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> The Government was aware of several reports and studies (the Iraqi Ministry of </p>
<p>Health in October 2004, the <i>Lancet</i> studies in October 2004 and October 2006, and </p>
<p>the Iraq Body Count dossier in July 2005) which suggested that coalition forces were </p>
<p>responsible for more civilian deaths than were the insurgents.</p>
<p><b>273. </b> Those reports did not trigger any work within the Government either to determine </p>
<p>the number of civilian casualties or to reassess its military or civilian effort. An FCO </p>
<p>official commented that the Iraqi Ministry of Health’s figures “will not help make the case </p>
<p>that more civilians have been killed by terrorists than by military action”.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>274. </b> The Inquiry has considered the question of whether a Government should, in the </p>
<p>future, do more to maintain a fuller understanding of the human cost of any conflict in </p>
<p>which it is engaged.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> All military operations carry a risk of civilian casualties. The parties to a conflict </p>
<p>have an obligation under International Humanitarian Law to limit its effects on civilians.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> In Iraq, the UK Government recognised that obligation in its Rules of Engagement, </p>
<p>Targeting Directive and guidance on Battle Damage Assessment. The Government did </p>
<p>not consider that it had a legal obligation to count civilian casualties.</p>

<p>17  |  Civilian casualties</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>277. </b> The Inquiry considers that a Government has a responsibility to make every </p>
<p>reasonable effort to identify and understand the likely and actual effects of its military </p>
<p>actions on civilians.</p>
<p><b>278. </b> That will include not only direct civilian casualties, but also the indirect costs on </p>
<p>civilians arising from worsening social, economic and health conditions. (Section 10.4 </p>
<p>considers the scale of the reconstruction challenge in Iraq after the fall of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime and the Government’s contribution to meeting that challenge).</p>
<p><b>279. </b> It may not be possible, before committing to a course of action, to produce even </p>
<p>broad estimates of the number of civilians that would be directly and indirectly affected </p>
<p>by it, or to identify all the effects on civilians.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> The Government should be ready to work with others, in particular NGOs and </p>
<p>academic institutions, to develop such assessments and estimates over time.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> The Government should take account of those assessments and estimates in </p>
<p>developing its strategy and plans as well as in its military tactics and use of ordnance, in </p>
<p>order to minimise, to the extent possible, the effects on civilians. The Inquiry considers </p>
<p>that RAND’s conclusion in relation to US military operations should apply equally to </p>
<p>the UK:</p>
<p>“Because protecting the population is one of the central tenets of US COIN </p>
<p>[counter&#8209;insurgency] doctrine … Iraqi civilian fatalities should be a chief concern for </p>
<p>the US military.”</p>
<p>169</p>
<p><b>282. </b> As well as serving to minimise the effect of military action on civilians, such </p>
<p>assessments and estimates will also enable the Government to address criticisms of the </p>
<p>human cost of military operations.</p>
