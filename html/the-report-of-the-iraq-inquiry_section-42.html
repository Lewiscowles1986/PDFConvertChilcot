<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the assessment between late July and late September 2002 of Iraq’s capabilities </p>
<p>and intentions to develop, produce and use chemical, biological and nuclear </p>
<p>weapons and ballistic missiles; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the production of the Government dossier <i>Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction. </i></p>
<p><i>The Assessment of the British Government</i>, which was published on </p>
<p>24 September; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons that day.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> A significant number of the documents relevant to the events considered in this </p>
<p>Section are already in the public domain, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>documents published by the Hutton Inquiry, including the four drafts of the </p>
<p>dossier produced in September 2002; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>documents released in response to FOI requests.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry has examined most of the original, unredacted, versions of these </p>
<p>documents and, in some cases, is adding further information to that already in the public </p>
<p>domain. In a small number of cases, however, primarily emails given to the Hutton </p>
<p>Inquiry, the Government has been unable to provide copies of the original documents.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The roles and responsibilities of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and the </p>
<p>Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) are addressed in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The development of UK strategy during the period addressed in this Section </p>
<p>is addressed in Sections 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The military planning for a campaign in which chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>could be used, and in particular the arrangements to provide protection for UK forces, </p>
<p>are addressed in Section 6.1 to 6.3. </p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The urgency and certainty with which the Government stated that Iraq was a threat </p>
<p>which had to be dealt with fuelled the demand for publication of the dossier and led </p>
<p>to Mr Blair’s decision to publish it in September, separate from any decision on the </p>
<p>way ahead.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary and public </p>
<p>support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required to secure </p>
<p>Iraq’s disarmament.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is no </p>
<p>evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 </p>
<p>improperly influenced the text. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt either that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons or that efforts </p>
<p>to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC should have made that clear </p>
<p>to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In his statement to Parliament on 24 September Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past, </p>
<p>current and potential future capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential </p>
<p>threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction; and that at some point in the future </p>
<p>that threat would become a reality.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier’s description of Iraq’s capabilities and intent became part of the baseline </p>
<p>against which the UK Government measured Iraq’s future statements and actions </p>
<p>and the success of weapons inspections.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated the firmness </p>
<p>of the evidence has produced a damaging legacy which may make it more difficult to </p>
<p>secure support for Government policy, including military action, where the evidence </p>
<p>depends on inferential judgements drawn from intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There are lessons which should be implemented in using information from JIC </p>
<p>Assessments to underpin policy decisions.</p>
<p><b>Late July and August 2002</b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting, 23 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>7.  Mr Blair’s meeting on Iraq on 23 July did not take firm decisions and </b></p>
<p><b>he commissioned further advice and background material on the issues.</b></p>
<p><b>8. </b> On 23 July, Mr Blair discussed Iraq with Mr Jack Straw (the Foreign Secretary), </p>
<p>Mr Geoff Hoon (the Defence Secretary), Lord Goldsmith (Attorney General), Sir Richard </p>
<p>Wilson (Cabinet Secretary), Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(CDS)), Sir Richard Dearlove (Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)), Sir </p>
<p>Francis Richards (Head of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ)), </p>
<p>Mr John Scarlett (Chairman of the JIC), Mr Jonathan Powell (Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff), </p>
<p>Baroness Morgan (Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations), Mr Alastair </p>
<p>Campbell (Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy) and Sir David Manning </p>
<p>(Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat (OD Sec)).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The meeting and the advice prepared for Mr Blair and other participants are </p>
<p>addressed in detail in Section 3.3.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The Cabinet Office paper, ‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’, which was prepared </p>
<p>to inform the discussion, was based on the assumption that Iraq was in possession of </p>
<p>prohibited weapons and material and was not complying with its UN obligations; but </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>it did not address the issue of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities </p>
<p>and intentions or the actual threat posed by Iraq’s WMD at that stage.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove discussed policy towards Iraq in a meeting with </p>
<p>Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, in Washington </p>
<p>on 19 July.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The report of that discussion stated that the US view was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “growing evidence of the construction of CBW production and links </p>
<p>to terrorists [in Iraq] stoking fears of a repeat 9/11 with WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a strong strategic case for removing Saddam Hussein. Continued </p>
<p>development of WMD was not in doubt.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A casus belli already existed.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Sir Richard reported that he was told a US “decision [on action] had already been </p>
<p>taken – the question was only how and when”.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Sir Richard also reported that, in a separate discussion with a senior US official, </p>
<p>he had been told that the US Administration’s intention was to set the threshold on UN </p>
<p>weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be able to hold up US policy.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Sir David Manning drew Mr Blair’s attention to the report, commenting:</p>
<p>“Not much doubt here that the Administration is bent on action soon, and convincing </p>
<p>itself that it has strong strategic, as well as a historical duty to act.</p>
<p>“Our views on links between Iraq, terrorism and development of WMD are different </p>
<p>from Condi’s: not proven at best …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“C [Sir Richard Dearlove] will be able to give the full picture tomorrow.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Powell commented: “Strengthens the need for and urgency of your note </p>
<p>to Bush.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Sir David Manning gave Mr Blair an Annotated Agenda for the meeting on 23 July, </p>
<p>including inviting:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett to set the scene with a “very brief summary” of the intelligence </p>
<p>on the position inside Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove to provide a brief account of his recent talks in Washington. </p>
<p>He had returned “convinced that the Administration have moved up a gear”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Sir David also identified questions Mr Blair might ask, including what sort of </p>
<p>battlefield environment was anticipated, and the response to any use of biological </p>
<p>weapons (BW) or chemical weapons (CW).</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The record of the 23 July meeting written by Mr Matthew Rycroft, one of Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>two Private Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, noted:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett summarised the intelligence and latest [4 July] JIC Assessment: </p>
<p>“Saddam’s regime was tough and based on extreme fear. The only way to </p>
<p>overthrow it was likely to be by massive military action.” Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“worried and expected an attack”, but he was “not convinced” that an attack </p>
<p>would be “immediate or overwhelming”. Real support for Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“probably narrowly based”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove reported that there was “a perceptible shift in attitude” </p>
<p>in Washington: “Military action was now seen as inevitable.” President Bush </p>
<p>“wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction </p>
<p>of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around </p>
<p>the policy. The NSC [National Security Council] had no patience with the UN </p>
<p>route and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime’s record.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that the meeting concluded that the UK “should work on the </p>
<p>assumption that the UK would take part in any military action”. Mr Blair also asked for </p>
<p>further advice on a number of issues, including that Mr Scarlett would send Mr Blair </p>
<p>a full intelligence update.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> In a separate record circulated more widely in Whitehall, Mr Rycroft wrote that </p>
<p>it had been suggested that Mr Scarlett provide a weekly update, on Friday mornings </p>
<p>for Mr Blair’s weekend box.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> In his account of the meeting in his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote, in relation to the </p>
<p>points made on WMD, that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had “said of the four powers posing a potential threat with WMD … </p>
<p>Iraq would be fourth. He [Saddam Hussein] does not have nukes, he has some </p>
<p>offensive WMD capability. The tough question is whether this is just regime </p>
<p>change or is the issue WMD.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair “said he needed to be convinced first of the workability of the military </p>
<p>plan, and second of an equally workable political strategy. Jack [Straw] said </p>
<p>we could probably get the votes for a UN ultimatum, but the Americans may </p>
<p>not want to go down that route. TB saw regime change as the route to dealing </p>
<p>with WMD.”</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>23. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that he:</p>
<p>“… ran through the four countries that posed a potential threat to world peace </p>
<p>because of their unauthorised and highly dangerous weapons systems – North </p>
<p>Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq. I thought it important to raise the issue as to whether </p>
<p>we should contemplate not joining the US in any American military effort against </p>
<p>Iraq. I was concerned that the case against Iraq (why did it merit the most severe </p>
<p>action? what differentiated it from the other three?) had not at that stage been made: </p>
<p>and also about the potential consequences for Tony’s leadership, and the survival </p>
<p>of his government.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>24. </b> Sir Richard told the Inquiry that he had had “quite contentious and difficult </p>
<p>conversations”. He had returned from Washington “deeply concerned that there was </p>
<p>momentum in parts of [US] Administration”, and he had warned Mr Blair about that </p>
<p>momentum.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> In relation to his “alleged comment” about the intelligence being fixed </p>
<p>around the policy, Sir Richard told the Inquiry that was really a reference to the attempts </p>
<p>“to join up terrorism and Iraq” with which he “radically disagreed”.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove’s report of his meetings in Washington and the comment that </p>
<p>“the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy” are addressed in more </p>
<p>detail in Section 3.3.</p>
<p><b>26.  Sir David Manning asked Mr Scarlett for advice on a number of issues, </b></p>
<p><b>including a review of Saddam Hussein’s military capabilities and intentions.</b></p>
<p><b>27. </b> It is not clear what was said about Iraq’s WMD in Mr Blair’s meeting on 23 July, </p>
<p>but the following day Sir David Manning explained to Mr Blair his concern that:</p>
<p>“… we (and I suspect the Americans) have only a hazy idea of Saddam’s retaliatory </p>
<p>capabilities if and when we attack Iraq. CDS [Adm Boyce] was unable to say </p>
<p>whether we would expect to fight in a CBW [chemical and biological warfare] </p>
<p>environment. The answer has a crucial bearing on the plausibility and viability of US </p>
<p>military plans.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>28. </b> Sir David wrote that he had “therefore, asked John Scarlett to review all the </p>
<p>intelligence on Saddam’s military capabilities and intentions, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What military equipment do we think Saddam possesses, and in what state </p>
<p>of readiness?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In particular, does he [Saddam Hussein] have chemical and biological agents; </p>
<p>and if so, can he weaponise them? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If he can weaponise them, do we believe he can deliver them by missile </p>
<p>or aircraft?” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Sir David pointed out that Iraq had not used chemical or biological agents during </p>
<p>the 1991 Gulf Conflict, but he was unsure whether that was because Iraq did not have </p>
<p>the capability or for other reasons. He was:</p>
<p>“… anyway left very uneasy by Mike Boyce’s suggestion that the Americans </p>
<p>believe that Saddam would only use CBW as a last resort. If this is the American </p>
<p>assessment, it strikes me as alarmingly complacent. Saddam will know that once </p>
<p>the US launches an attack, the game is up. From his point of view, it will be last </p>
<p>resort time from the moment the first Marines hit the beach. And with all the wisdom </p>
<p>of the armchair strategist, it seems to me that the temptation to let fly at the Kuwait </p>
<p>bottleneck, with everything in his armoury, could be very strong indeed.” </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Mr Scarlett was also asked to “do more work on regime cohesion” in the light </p>
<p>of what Sir David described as “a risk of American wishful thinking”. </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Scarlett subsequently provided a list of points on Iraq, to which he believed </p>
<p>answers were needed, for Sir David Manning to use during his visit to Washington </p>
<p>(see Section 3.3).</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The points on Iraq’s WMD were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s CBW and ballistic missile capability …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s ‘red lines’ which would provoke him to use CBW against Coalition </p>
<p>Forces or his neighbours.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What would be the Israeli response to an Iraqi CBW attack?” </p>
<p><b>32. </b> A JIC Assessment addressing Sir David Manning’s questions about Iraq’s military </p>
<p>capabilities was produced on 9 September. That is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>33.  On 29 July, Sir David Manning delivered to Dr Rice a Note from Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>to President Bush. </b></p>
<p><b>34. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush a “Note on Iraq” dated 28 July which was intended to </p>
<p>influence President Bush’s thinking on Iraq.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> The Note and the subsequent discussions </p>
<p>between Sir David Manning and senior members of the US Administration, including </p>
<p>President Bush, and Mr Blair’s own discussion with President Bush, are addressed </p>
<p>in Section 3.3. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Blair’s Note included six elements for “A Strategy for Achieving a Coalition”. </p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>36. </b> One of the elements was the need to explain why action to disarm Iraq was </p>
<p>necessary. In a paragraph on “<b>The Evidence</b>”, Mr Blair wrote that he had been told that </p>
<p>the US thought evidence was unnecessary but his view was “we still need to make the </p>
<p>case”. He suggested:</p>
<p>“If we recapitulate all the WMD evidence; add his [Saddam Hussein’s] attempts to </p>
<p>secure nuclear capability; and, as seems possible, add on the Al Qaida link, it will </p>
<p>be hugely persuasive over here. Plus … the abhorrent nature of the regime. It could </p>
<p>be done simultaneously with the deadline.”</p>
<p><b>37. </b> In a final section addressing “<b>The Military Plan</b>”, Mr Blair wrote that he had been </p>
<p>advised that there was a “risk of CW being used” if a military attack was launched which </p>
<p>did not result in the rapid collapse of the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Sir David Manning had a “pre-meeting” with Mr Richard Armitage, the US Deputy </p>
<p>Secretary of State.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Sir David told the Inquiry that he had raised a number of detailed points with </p>
<p>Mr Armitage:</p>
<p>“… Why now? What if Saddam Hussein were to use weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>during a military campaign? What would follow military action? What role … would </p>
<p>the United States see the United Nations playing, and what was the United States </p>
<p>planning to do about the Middle East Peace Process [MEPP]?”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> Sir David said that he had told Mr Armitage that he “didn’t think we had answers to </p>
<p>those questions”. Mr Armitage had replied that he thought they needed a lot more work </p>
<p>and that: “It was better to be right than to hurry.”</p>
<p><b>“Summer reading”</b></p>
<p><b>41. </b> In response to a request from Mr Powell, Mr Scarlett sent Mr Blair “classified reading </p>
<p>material on Iraq” including two documents produced by the Defence Intelligence Staff </p>
<p>(DIS) on proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and Iraq:</p>
<p>17</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>42. </b> The first was a document of almost 500 pages, “designed to provide a </p>
<p>comprehensive reference and briefing document” for use by government departments, </p>
<p>providing details of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s nuclear, chemical and biological programmes and their potential means </p>
<p>of delivery, particularly ballistic missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>procurement mechanisms in recent times;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the critical goods which Iraq would require for WMD-related programmes; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>goods and technologies which Iraq was actively seeking; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>developments in indigenous military production; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s conventional arms purchases.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>43. </b> The document replaced a version produced in 1996.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> A one-page summary of key judgements was provided, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The location and condition of the concealed Al Hussein missiles was “unknown”, </p>
<p>but there was “sufficient engineering expertise to make them operational”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “begun development” of ballistic missiles with a range of more than </p>
<p>1,000km, but it would “not be able to produce such a missile before 2007 </p>
<p>provided sanctions remain effective”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “continuing to carry out research into nuclear weapons development </p>
<p>at a theoretical level” and intelligence indicated that it might have recalled its </p>
<p>nuclear scientists from civilian work in 1998. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq might “be trying to develop centrifuge enrichment of uranium”, but that was </p>
<p>“likely to produce significant, if not insurmountable problems”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Some clandestine procurement has been attempted abroad using foreign </p>
<p>front companies. Many ‘dual-use’ items such as machine tools and electrical </p>
<p>equipment have been acquired which would be available for the nuclear </p>
<p>programme.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was assessed that Iraq had “no intention of restoring its CW agent production </p>
<p>to pre-Gulf Conflict levels” but it “could begin the production of mustard gas on </p>
<p>a significant scale at any time and the nerve agents sarin and VX within weeks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was assessed that Iraq was “continuing to conceal the full extent of its BW </p>
<p>programme in order to preserve a limited offensive capability and that it could </p>
<p>revive its BW programme within a matter of weeks without much difficulty or </p>
<p>outside assistance”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s CBW production capability had “been dispersed to survive a military attack </p>
<p>and UN inspections”.</p>

<p><b>45. </b> The second document addressed several countries of concern.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> A two-page Annex </p>
<p>provided comments on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> On Iraq’s nuclear weapons, the DIS stated that the intelligence on Iraq’s nuclear </p>
<p>weapons programme was “limited”. Saddam Hussein had held regular meetings with </p>
<p>Iraqi Atomic Energy personnel and expressed continuing support of atomic energy. </p>
<p>There was:</p>
<p>“No confirmed weapon-related facilities have been identified but some civil research </p>
<p>continues at Tuwaitha and rebuilding of Military Industrial Complex facilities </p>
<p>continues. Many scientists from the former nuclear weapons programme are known </p>
<p>to work at … al-Tahidi and may conduct nuclear-associated research. Any links </p>
<p>to a weapons programme have yet to be established.”</p>
<p><b>47. </b> On Iraq’s ballistic missiles systems, the DIS set out Iraq’s activities to develop short </p>
<p>range systems. On long-range missiles, it stated that Intelligence indicated Iraq had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a longer-range SCUD-derived missile “under development”. That was “probably </p>
<p>linked to the construction of a new large liquid propellant rocket engine static </p>
<p>test stand”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued work on longer-range systems but it was “unlikely to produce such </p>
<p>new systems within five years if sanctions remained effective”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“reported ambitions for missiles with ranges of 2,000 to 3,00km”.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> In addition, the DIS had “recently noted a world-wide drive to acquire production-</p>
<p>level quantities of materials for making solid rocket motors and a continued emphasis </p>
<p>on guidance and control technology”.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes the DIS stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “some refurbishment” of the former CW precursor production </p>
<p>facility near Habbaniyah, but “this could not support large-scale CW agent </p>
<p>production”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The possibility existed that Iraq had “a series of transportable production </p>
<p>facilities, although none have yet been identified, possibly as a result of denial </p>
<p>and deception”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “the necessary command and control structure necessary to deliver </p>
<p>CBW weapons”. There were “no specifics on preferred delivery options” but they </p>
<p>could, in the future, include the L-29 Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV).</p>

<p><b>52. </b> As set out in Section 4.1, Mr Tom McKane, Deputy Head of OD Sec, was asked in </p>
<p>March 2002 to chair an inter-departmental group to take forward work on the substance </p>

<p>21</p>
<p> Mr Campbell was to retain the lead role on the form </p>

<p><b>53. </b> Mr McKane sent the latest versions of the “three Iraq public documents: on WMD, </p>
<p>Weapons Inspections and Abuse of Human Rights” to Sir David Manning on 21 June, </p>
<p>asking whether the three documents should be treated as a package or the WMD paper </p>
<p>should be published separately.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett’s preference was for the latter, but most </p>
<p>officials in the inter-departmental group thought the papers should be published together.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Mr McKane also produced a draft Foreword “which could be issued in the name </p>
<p>of Mr Straw or jointly by him, Mr Hoon and Ms Short [the International Development </p>

<p><b>55. </b> On 16 July, Sir David Manning, Mr Powell and Mr Campbell agreed that publication </p>
<p>of the three papers on Iraq should be put on hold.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>56. </b> The Cabinet Office paper of 19 July recommended that Ministers should: </p>
<p>“Agree to the establishment of an ad hoc group of officials under Cabinet Office </p>

<p>with the US.”</p>

<p>had seen it as related to, but separate from, the production of the dossier.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> The dossier </p>
<p>seemed to him to be:</p>
<p>“… about putting the fact[s] before the British public in a way that would explain why </p>
<p>this [Iraq] was a problem and a problem that had to be dealt with.</p>
<p>“So … it might have formed an element of a broader information campaign.”</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>59. </b> On 5 August, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, wrote to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning suggesting that there was “a need to bolster our public lines on Iraq </p>
<p>for the summer while not changing our fundamental posture that no decision has been </p>
<p>taken on military action”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that the Government was “likely to face a long hot summer of </p>
<p>media speculation about the possibility of military action”. He suggested strengthening </p>
<p>the presentation of existing lines and reinforcing them with recent quotes from Mr Blair </p>
<p>and others “about the WMD threat posed by Saddam Hussein”. MOD and FCO officials </p>
<p>were working on that but careful drafting would be required “to avoid foreshadowing the </p>
<p>document now under consideration in the Cabinet Office”. He added:</p>
<p>“The aim would be to reinforce the message that the threat is real, without </p>
<p>suggesting that we have determined any particular policy to counter it.”</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Mr Watkins suggested there was a need for “some closely held inter-departmental </p>
<p>thinking on a contingent information strategy in support of any decision to take military </p>
<p>action against Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Sir David Manning was not persuaded that action was needed immediately and </p>
<p>asked Ms Anna Wechsberg, one of Mr Blair’s two Private Secretaries for Foreign Affairs, </p>
<p>to follow up.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Sir David also sent a copy of the minute and his comments to Mr Scarlett.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Ms Wechsberg spoke to Mr Hoon’s Private Office to say that No.10 was “not </p>
<p>enthusiastic” about the proposals. It was agreed that, unless the MOD identified “other </p>
<p>arguments for proceeding, the idea will be dropped for now”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>65. </b> In a minute on 8 August, reporting developments while Mr McKane had been on </p>
<p>leave, Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head OD Sec (Foreign Policy), wrote that, in the </p>
<p>context of the public debate on Iraq “raging on in the press”, Sir David Manning had </p>
<p>“been very clear that he wants no action taken on the release of the dossier or any </p>
<p>private briefing of those engaging in the debate”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Drummond also reported that Mr John Williams, FCO Press Secretary (formerly </p>
<p>Head of FCO News Department), had told Mr Straw that “releasing the dossier would be </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>67. </b> Mr McKane had an interdepartmental meeting planned for 19 August. Mr Drummond </p>
<p>suggested that if it went ahead, it might be “small and informal to consider the options </p>
<p>for a press campaign if/when Ministers take political decisions about Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> Mr Williams had written a minute on 2 August which prompted Mr Edward Chaplin, </p>
<p>FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, to write to Mr Andrew Patrick, FCO Head </p>
<p>of Newsroom, that: “Although the dossier includes some good material, it presents little </p>
<p>new evidence of Iraq’s WMD to justify a move away from our policy of containment/</p>
<p>deterrence.”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> He had discussed the issue with SIS who took “the same view”. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> Mr Chaplin suggested that special briefings for key foreign leaders would be </p>
<p>needed “in addition to any dossier”, to “convince them that the Iraqi WMD threat was </p>
<p>real, drawing on intelligence material more freely than would be possible in a public </p>
<p>document”. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> That might be extended to:</p>
<p>“… a selection of opinion-formers in the UK … In private briefings one could </p>
<p>be much more explicit about the threat, using recent JIC Assessments (SIS have </p>
<p>suggested that this could be done without undue threat to sources), plus a political </p>
<p>briefing and, perhaps, a description of the damage which a relatively small quantity </p>
<p>of WMD could inflict in urban areas of Britain.” </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Mr Chaplin also reported that another senior FCO official had pointed out the risk </p>
<p>of “binning the dossier, given that it has already been so heavily trailed”, and suggested </p>
<p>a briefing note could still be published “nearer the time of military action” along the lines </p>
<p>of a document on the “sins of Saddam” produced in 1998. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Chaplin suggested the message would be that:</p>
<p>“… there is still a serious potential threat to UK national security; action has to be </p>
<p>taken; the problem could still be resolved peacefully; but if Iraq pursues this route, </p>
<p>military action as a last resort is right.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Chaplin concluded that, if Mr Patrick and Mr Williams thought his proposals </p>
<p>were “a runner”, the idea could be developed with the Cabinet Office and others and </p>
<p>submitted to Ministers “after the holiday season”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Chaplin’s minute was sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Mike O’Brien, </p>
<p>Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, and to Sir Michael Jay, FCO </p>
<p>Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), and other senior officials.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>75. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Williams wrote that he had been “instinctively </p>
<p>against the idea of a dossier” which seemed to him:</p>
<p>“… to rest on uncertainties, as by definition we did not know what Iraq had done </p>
<p>with weapons and materials which it had been told by the UN to account for, but </p>
<p>hadn’t. That is not to say I questioned the general concern about Iraq, only that I had </p>
<p>a feeling we would be in difficulty if we were asked for evidence of things that were </p>
<p>inherently unknown to the international community.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Mr Williams added that he:</p>
<p>“… had no inkling that Iraq may no longer possess such weapons, only an anxiety </p>
<p>that we could not know the extent of weaponry which the UN was unable to inspect </p>
<p>or verify.”</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Mr Williams also wrote that his recollection was that “there was never a voice raised” </p>
<p>in Mr Straw’s presence, “or in the flow of paper … that ever raised doubts that Iraq still </p>
<p>possessed weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Williams stated that he had done nothing about his concerns until August 2002, </p>
<p>when he “vividly” recalled that he felt “he had to do something”, and he wrote a note </p>
<p>asking Mr Straw, when he returned from holiday, to try to persuade Mr Blair “to forget </p>
<p>about a dossier”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> He had argued that the Government should not take it upon itself </p>
<p>to prove what the inspectors had not been able to prove. The note was overtaken by </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s announcement at Sedgefield, which is addressed later in the Section, and </p>
<p>Mr Williams did not receive a response. </p>
<p><b>79. </b> The Government has been unable to find either Mr Williams’ minute of 2 August or </p>
<p>any subsequent minute to Mr Straw in August 2002. Mr Williams’ minute of 4 September </p>
<p>is addressed late in this Section. </p>
<p><b>80.  During an unpublicised visit to the US on 20 August, Mr Straw informed </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>81. </b> When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell met on 20 August, they discussed Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Note to President Bush of 28 July and its impact on thinking in the US.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>82. </b> In relation to Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, Secretary Powell told Mr Straw </p>
<p>that dossiers on the “case for action” were being prepared:</p>
<p>“True believers would see a smoking gun no matter what. But most of the stuff Iraq </p>
<p>was importing was dual-use. It was not clear that the situation was any more serious </p>
<p>this year than last.”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Straw handed over a copy of the UK’s draft dossier:</p>
<p>“Although it made clear that Saddam was a very bad man, the contents did not </p>
<p>lead inexorably to the conclusion that the only way to deal with him was by military </p>
<p>action.”</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he had discussed the position with Mr Blair the </p>
<p>previous day. Mr Blair was concerned and had:</p>
<p>“… asked him to stress that the problem was that we had been ‘outed’ long before </p>
<p>we had been able to make the case with the public for action …” </p>
<p><b>85. </b> Addressing the “public case”, Mr Straw said that the UK dossier:</p>
<p>“… needed a compelling last chapter. We could make a better case than the one </p>
<p>we had made so far. Traditional Cold War-style containment did not work for WMD. </p>
<p>Rogue states did not have as much at stake as the Soviet bloc.”</p>
<p><b>86. </b> On 19 August, Mr McKane chaired a “restricted” inter-departmental meeting </p>
<p>on an information strategy on Iraq.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>87. </b> The MOD had provided an outline of the shape an information strategy might </p>
<p>take, with the objectives of attaining “domestic acquiescence” and regional and </p>
<p>international support. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> The meeting also discussed the forthcoming International Institute of Strategic </p>
<p>Studies (IISS) report (on Iraq’s WMD). It was perceived as “useful”, but the UK should </p>
<p>“resist any calls” to publish the dossier, “which would be seen by the media as a positive </p>
<p>indication of UK preparations for a military operation against Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> In conclusion, Mr McKane:</p>
<p>“… re-iterated the sensitive nature of the meeting. It was important that no work was </p>
<p>taken forward in the absence of a policy decision, and that no action was taken that </p>
<p>might be misconstrued by the media as an indication of the UK’s policy decision.” </p>

<p><b>93.  Mr Scarlett had been working on the WMD paper in the dossier during August. </b></p>
<p><b>94. </b> On 8 and 9 August, there was an email exchange between the Assessments Staff </p>
<p>and the MOD about whether there was evidence available on Iraq’s ballistic missile work </p>
<p>outside the activities permitted by the UN:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD was asked if it could provide two to three “examples of ballistic missile </p>

<p>of 150km range permitted by the UN.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett was “keen” to include them </p>
<p>in the dossier. The MOD was also asked for “an explanation of the shed going </p>
<p>up at al-Rafah”, which Mr Scarlett also wanted to mention. </p>

<p>we can do”.</p>

<p>41</p>
<p> It was “no surprise” </p>
<p>that Iraq was putting “a lid on the new stand to prevent imagery observation of </p>

<p>there will be something to test on it”.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>The MOD suggested “Further to your request to make the public paper more </p>

<p>of the prohibited long-range missile that Iraq is known to be developing”, and a </p>

<p>Mr Scarlett had recently reviewed the document, and made changes. The presentation </p>
<p>of the CBW sections had been revised “to bring out more clearly our judgements” </p>

<p> Mr Scarlett was also:</p>
<p>“… particularly keen to include examples of suspicious facilities, so can I ask that </p>
<p>we look closely at the relevant areas to see if anything more can be said.”</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Ms Hamilton-Eddy added that the aim was to have the revised document ready </p>

<p>44</p>
<p> Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In relation to the material for which the inspectors had been unable to account, </p>
<p>Iraq’s “declarations to UNSCOM [UN Special Commission] deliberately obscure </p>
<p>the picture”.</p>

<p>“Iraq’s military forces maintain the capability to use these weapons, with </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 21 August 2002: ‘Iraq: Saddam’s Diplomatic and </b></p>
<p><b>Military Options’</b></p>
<p><b>99.  A JIC Assessment of 21 August concluded that in a conflict Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>would order missile strikes and the use of CBW against Coalition Forces, </b></p>
<p><b>supporting regional states and Israel. </b></p>
<p><b>100.  The JIC had little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW and little insight into how </b></p>
<p><b>it would fight. Its conclusions reflected the Committee’s own judgements.</b></p>
<p><b>101.  In relation to Saddam Hussein’s intentions to use CBW and missile strikes, </b></p>
<p><b>the sense of certainty that Iraq had chemical and biological weapons and that it </b></p>
<p><b>would use them in the Key Judgements reflected a wider judgement than could </b></p>
<p><b>have been derived from the information in the Assessment itself.</b></p>
<p><b>102. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment on 21 August </p>
<p>considering “what diplomatic options Saddam has to deter, avert or limit the scope </p>
<p>of a US-led attack”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> The judgements on these issues are set out in Section 3.4.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> In addition, the Assessment considered Saddam Hussein’s “military options for </p>
<p>facing a US-led attack” and how his analysis about each course of action might “change </p>
<p>as an attack becomes increasingly imminent”. It examined Iraq’s options for the short </p>
<p>term, whether Saddam Hussein might seize the initiative, how Iraq might respond to </p>
<p>a US military build-up, Saddam’s options in “war” – including the use of missiles and </p>
<p>WMD, and “alternative scenarios and at the death”. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Iraq’s options for the use of weapons of mass destruction were considered “only </p>
<p>briefly” as the JIC would assess those in early September, but the JIC offered two </p>
<p>Key Judgements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Early on in any conflict, Saddam would order missile attacks on Israel, Coalition </p>
<p>Forces and regional states providing the US with bases.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam would order the use of CBW against Coalition Forces at some point, </p>
<p>probably after a Coalition attack had begun. Once Saddam was convinced </p>
<p>that his fate was sealed, he would order the unrestrained use of CBW against </p>
<p>Coalition Forces, supporting regional states and Israel.”</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The Assessment stated that “Saddam would probably order missile attacks” and </p>
<p>the JIC judged that attacks on Israel would be “an attempt to attract Israeli retaliation and </p>
<p>thus widen the war, split the Coalition and arouse popular opinion in the Arab States”. </p>
<p>Missiles “could be armed with chemical or biological warfare (CBW) agents”, although </p>
<p>“Saddam might be deterred at least initially by the threat of Israeli nuclear retaliation.” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>106. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had a “limited number of long-range missiles … available”; the JIC </p>
<p>assessed “12-20 650km range Al Hussein missiles”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had produced more than 50 Al Samoud missiles with a range of 150km.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Attacks on Coalition Forces in Kuwait would require Iraq to deploy short-range </p>
<p>missiles into the “No Drive Zone [south of the 32nd parallel – imposed in </p>
<p>resolution 949 (1994)]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A pre-emptive missile attack on Israel was “less likely because it would show </p>
<p>Iraq had been lying about its retention of long-range missiles”.</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Although it had “little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW doctrine” and knew “little about </p>
<p>Iraq’s CBW work since late 1998”, the JIC judged it “likely that Saddam would order the </p>
<p>use of CBW against Coalition Forces at some point, probably after Coalition attacks had </p>
<p>begun”. Iraqi CBW use “would become increasingly likely the closer Coalition Forces </p>
<p>came to Baghdad. Military targets might include troop concentrations or important fixed </p>
<p>targets in rear areas such as ports and airfields.” </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Addressing the possibility of “Alternative scenarios and at the death” the </p>
<p>Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “might pursue an extreme course of action at an earlier stage” </p>
<p>if he judged it to be “worth the risk of providing the US with overt justification </p>
<p>to attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Unorthodox options might include “the early or pre-emptive use of <b>CBW</b>”; </p>
<p>“<b>CBW terrorism</b>: although Saddam probably lacks the capability to deploy </p>
<p>a sophisticated device, he could cause widespread panic”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Should he feel his fate is sealed, Saddam’s judgement might change to ‘bring </p>
<p>the temple down’ on his enemies no matter what the cost”. At that stage, </p>
<p>“Saddam would order the unrestrained use of CBW against Coalition Forces, </p>
<p>supporting regional states and Israel, although he would face practical problems </p>
<p>of command and control, the loyalty of his commanders, logistics problems and </p>
<p>the availability of chemical and biological agents in sufficient quantities to be </p>
<p>effective and the means to deliver them.”</p>
<p><b>109. </b> The <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction, </i>the Butler </p>
<p>Report, stated:</p>
<p>“The Key Judgements … would rightly have been prepared on a precautionary </p>
<p>basis. Perhaps for that reason, we have observed that when set against the </p>
<p>intelligence on Iraqi programmes contained in advice to Ministers in March [2002], </p>
<p>the JIC assessment reflected more firmly the premise that Iraq had chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons and would use them in war. Underpinning this must have been </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>a presumption that, if Iraq did not have stocks of these weapons, it would quickly </p>
<p>produce agent, weaponise it and deploy weapons to units …”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The Butler Report also stated:</p>
<p>“We were told that the JIC’s conclusions were based in part on one human </p>
<p>intelligence report from one source, but mainly on the JIC’s own judgements. They </p>
<p>thus represent an insight into the views of JIC members of Iraq’s chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons capabilities at that time.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff from September 2001 to November </p>
<p>2003, told the Inquiry that the Assessment had:</p>
<p>“… picked up a report from an established source which referred to the intention to </p>
<p>use weapons. I think it didn’t distinguish between chemical and biological. It implied </p>
<p>both were intended to be used. […]”</p>

<p>responded that there were “many open questions” but the inspectors did not have </p>

<p>Dr Blix also pointed out that “an absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence”.</p>

<p> The “Iraqi regime has in fact been very busy enhancing its capabilities </p>
<p>in the field of chemical and biological weapons” and that “we now know that Saddam </p>
<p>has resumed his efforts to acquire nuclear weapons … Many of us are convinced that </p>
<p>Saddam will acquire nuclear weapons fairly soon.” </p>
<p><b>115. </b> Vice President Cheney added that there was “no doubt” that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had weapons of mass destruction and was “amassing them to use against our friends, </p>
<p>against our allies, and against us”. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> In a telephone call on 29 August, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed Iraq, </p>
<p>including the need to make clear that Iraq was the UN’s problem and that the issue was </p>
<p>total disarmament of Iraq’s WMD and associated systems not just the reintroduction of </p>
<p>inspectors.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“… wanted the UN to meet that challenge, but if it could not we would have to act. </p>
<p>So we should remake the case, put together the evidence against Saddam, and </p>
<p>work up a UNSCR [UN Security Council resolution] …” </p>
<p><b>117.  When Mr Blair returned to No.10 after his holiday, he set out his concerns </b></p>
<p><b>about the public debate, and that he and President Bush had been “outed” as </b></p>
<p><b>having decided on military action when no decisions had been taken. </b></p>
<p><b>118. </b> As part of a wider note to No.10 officials on 30 August about the strategy on Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Blair set out his position: </p>
<p>“I don’t need any convincing as to where we are on this. The state of opinion, the </p>
<p>difficulties. The problems are compounded by the fact that [President] Bush and </p>
<p>myself have been ‘outed’ as having decided for war, come what may, when actually </p>
<p>no decisions have been taken. So the arguments are all being made against any </p>
<p>action, when we are not yet in a position to make the arguments for it. But all this </p>
<p>can be turned round in time, with the right strategy.</p>
<p>“My basic view on Iraq is clear and hard. The policy of containment … has worked </p>
<p>up to a point, but can’t continue indefinitely; there is no doubt that, uncontained, </p>
<p>Iraq is a threat; they are trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability; they are </p>
<p>developing ballistic missile capability for biological and chemical weapons of a </p>
<p>longer-range; they retain substantial WMD stocks …</p>
<p>“Opinion against action divides into two: those always opposed and the usual  </p>
<p>anti-American lobby; and those, a large number, who ask entirely sensible </p>
<p>questions, but who might support action if the questions were answered.”</p>

<p>136</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Blair stated: “The basic strategy should be to answer these questions and, </p>
<p>in doing so, set … Iraq in a bigger context.” The steps to do that included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>raising the whole issue of WMD up the agenda with a separate strategy for each </p>
<p>country developing WMD, “in particular [those] acquiring nuclear technology </p>
<p>in secret”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>setting out the “unique danger posed by Iraq … an inherently violent and </p>
<p>unstable regime, with a track record of external aggression, unmitigated </p>
<p>by any moderate elements unlike other WMD countries”.</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s decision to publish the dossier</b></p>
<p><b>120. </b> On 2 September, Mr Campbell wrote to Sir David Manning, Mr Powell and </p>

<p>and planning on Iraq are seeping into the media in an uncoordinated and undisciplined </p>
<p>way”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> “Above all”, Mr Blair was “concerned what the US Administration must think”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair intended to use his press conference the following day (in his Sedgefield </p>
<p>constituency) to make the general position clear and “give people a public script”. </p>
<p><b>121.  The FCO advice to Mr Blair before the press conference in Sedgefield </b></p>
<p><b>on 3 September 2002 stated unequivocally that Iraq had and was hiding WMD; </b></p>
<p><b>and that it had continued its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </b></p>
<p><b>programmes after the departure of UN weapons inspectors in December 1998. </b></p>
<p><b>122.  The FCO advice conflated past, present and potential future capabilities </b></p>

<p><b>123.  The FCO asserted the belief that Iraq had recently accelerated its weapons </b></p>

<p><b>124. </b> In preparation for his press conference in Sedgefield, Mr Blair asked for information </p>
<p>on a number of issues, including a summary of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“what we knew of the existing Iraqi WMD programme, in particular ballistic </p>

<p><b>125. </b> The FCO response was sent to No.10 on 2 September by Mr Mark Sedwill, one </p>
<p>of Mr Straw’s Private Secretaries who had been attached to UNSCOM between 1996 </p>
<p>and 1998.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Addressing the question “<b>Does Iraq possess WMD?</b>”, the FCO stated:</p>
<p>“Yes. Iraq is still hiding weapons of mass destruction in a range of locations. The </p>
<p>regime has admitted hiding chemical, biological weapons and missile parts …</p>
<p>“The Iraqi regime has admitted producing large quantities of chemical warfare </p>
<p>agents … It has also admitted … producing biological warfare agents …</p>
<p>“In the course of their work between 1991 and 1998, UN weapons inspectors </p>
<p>were unable to account for thousands of tonnes of so-called precursor chemicals </p>
<p>used in the production of weapons; hundreds of tonnes of chemicals used in the </p>
<p>production of VX nerve agent; up to a dozen ballistic missiles with a range of over </p>
<p>600 kilometres; and tens of thousands of special munitions which can be used in </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons.” </p>
<p><b>127. </b> Addressing “<b>Developments in Iraq’s WMD programmes Since the Last </b></p>
<p><b>Inspections?</b>”, the FCO stated:</p>
<p>“… the Baghdad regime continues to pursue ballistic missile, nuclear, chemical </p>
<p>and biological programmes in breach of its UN obligations. </p>
<p>“We believe that Iraq has recently accelerated its weapons programmes. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>“Saddam’s ballistic missile programme has made continued progress and facilities </p>
<p>damaged by Operation Desert Fox in 1998 have been repaired. We believe that </p>
<p>he is planning to extend the range of his current missiles beyond the 150km limit </p>
<p>imposed by the UN … </p>
<p>“We have reports of increased nuclear procurement. We think R&amp;D on a nuclear </p>
<p>weapons programme has restarted. If sanctions are lifted, we believe that Saddam </p>
<p>could develop a nuclear weapon within 5 years. If he were able to procure fissile </p>
<p>material from outside Iraq, then he might possess a nuclear capability in a much </p>
<p>shorter timeframe.</p>
<p>“We believe that the Iraqi regime continues its biological and chemical weapons </p>
<p>programmes.” </p>
<p><b>128. </b> The FCO advised Mr Blair that Iraq did not have an active civil nuclear programme </p>
<p>and that almost all its facilities had been dismantled after 1991. The International Atomic </p>
<p>Energy Agency (IAEA) inspected “the small quantity of radioactive material which </p>
<p>Iraq was permitted to keep for research”. The FCO added: “In these circumstances, </p>

<p>Saddam’s ambitions to develop WMD” and described the new sanctions regime adopted </p>
<p>by the UN on 14 May 2002 as demonstrating “that the international community remains </p>
<p>united in its determination to control the export of military-related items to Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> In response to a potential suggestion that the absence of the promised dossier </p>
<p>demonstrated the weakness of the Government’s case, the FCO stated:</p>
<p>“Not at all. The scale of the Iraqi WMD programme uncovered by UN inspectors </p>
<p>in the 1990s demonstrates the extent of Saddam’s ambitions. And his previous </p>
<p>use of chemical agents against his own people demonstrates that he will show </p>
<p>no compunction in using such weapons.</p>
<p>“… All of our intelligence reporting, revelations from Iraqi defectors and past </p>
<p>experience tells us that Iraq is taking advantage of absence of inspections to revive </p>
<p>its chemical, biological and nuclear programmes.”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> The FCO also referred to the examples of past Iraqi concealment and deceit </p>
<p>identified in UNSCOM’s final report in 1999.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> The FCO stated that further details on Iraq’s WMD programmes were set out </p>
<p>in the draft dossier on Iraq, which had been produced earlier in the year for possible </p>
<p>publication.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> A separate FCO brief on the policy of containment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The purpose of the policy (of containment) had been to ensure that Iraq was </p>
<p>disarmed through two main elements: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>disarmament through inspections regimes; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>reducing Iraq’s ability to finance its WMD programmes by controlling its </p>
<p>revenues from oil.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The policy had “some success in dismantling Saddam’s arsenal when the </p>
<p>inspectors were able to operate”, and it had “slowed his efforts to rebuild WMD”. </p>
<p>The arms embargo had “been effective in preventing Saddam acquiring new </p>
<p>complete weapons systems”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But, “in the absence of inspectors”, Iraq could “work on its WMD programmes </p>
<p>unimpeded” and Iraq was “in violation of a string of Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>intended to curb” those programmes. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Controls on revenues were “eroding”, giving Saddam “access to large sums </p>
<p>over which the international community had no control” and “much” of that was </p>
<p>“certainly going into his high-priority WMD programmes”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Although the sanctions regime had been “targeted on goods of most concern”, </p>
<p>no sanctions regime would “be completely effective in stopping a ruthless and </p>
<p>well-funded regime getting its hands on some of the goods and technology </p>
<p>needed for a WMD programme”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>134.  In his press conference, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein was, “without </b></p>
<p><b>any question, still trying to develop” a “chemical, biological, potentially nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>capability”; and that to allow him to do so would be “irresponsible”.</b></p>
<p><b>135.  Mr Blair announced that the “dossier” setting out the evidence of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>attempts to develop its “chemical, biological and potentially nuclear capability” </b></p>
<p><b>would be published in the “next few weeks”.</b></p>
<p><b>136.  Mr Campbell wrote that the hardest question to answer was “Why now?”</b></p>
<p><b>137. </b> On 3 September, in his Sedgefield press conference, which lasted 90 minutes, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… I think I would be right in saying that many of your questions will be on Iraq … </p>
<p>I sense that some of you believe we have taken all the key decisions but just haven’t </p>
<p>got round to telling you. That isn’t the case … We, at every level of government, </p>
<p>have been and remain in close dialogue with the United States of America about this </p>
<p>issue and where we are in absolute agreement is that Iraq poses a real and unique </p>
<p>threat to the security of the region and the rest of the world. But Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>is continuing in his efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction … We have to </p>
<p>face up to it, we have to deal with it and will. The issue is then what is the best way </p>
<p>of proceeding.”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>138. </b> A number of questioners pointed out that public opinion had moved against the </p>
<p>idea of a strike against Iraq “partly because people feel that there hasn’t been much </p>
<p>evidence … We have heard again and again that there is a dossier of evidence about </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Why haven’t we got it up to now and </p>
<p>when are we going to see it?” Would there be any evidence in the dossier which had </p>
<p>been “gleaned in the last four years” that Saddam Hussein had “moved any further down </p>
<p>the route to nuclear weapons? There were suggestions that there was “not going to be </p>
<p>much new”; and that, in terms of public opinion, there was “a mountain to climb”. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> In response to the first question, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Originally I had the intention that we wouldn’t get round to publishing the dossier </p>
<p>until we’d actually taken the key decisions. I think it is probably a better idea to bring </p>
<p>that forward.” </p>

<p>140</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Blair added: “A lot of the work has already been done, there needs to be some </p>
<p>more work and some more checking” but “the best thing to do is to publish … within the </p>
<p>next few weeks”. When that happened:</p>
<p>“… people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that </p>
<p>Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose. He [Saddam Hussein] is without any </p>
<p>question, still trying to develop that chemical, biological, potentially nuclear capability </p>
<p>and to allow him to do so without any let or hindrance, just to say, we [sic] can carry </p>
<p>on and do it, I think would be irresponsible.” </p>
<p><b>141. </b> In terms of the specifics of Iraq’s WMD, Mr Blair made a number of </p>
<p>comments including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… there is no doubt that at some point the Iraqi regime were trying to develop </p>
<p>nuclear weapons … I believe that there is evidence that they will acquire nuclear </p>
<p>weapons capability if they possibly can.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Now we will provide what support we can for that, although of course the </p>
<p>absence of inspectors … means there is necessarily a limit. But I don’t think </p>
<p>we should be in any doubt about the nature of this regime, they will acquire </p>
<p>whatever weapons they possibly can.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Certainly they were trying to obtain a nuclear weapons capability. I think there </p>
<p>is some evidence that they continued to do so.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [W]e don’t really know what is happening now, there are huge amounts </p>
<p>of stocks of chemical, biological weapons unaccounted for.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [W]e can’t be quite sure what is happening on the nuclear side … but on the </p>
<p>biological and chemical weapons side there is no doubt about it, there are vast </p>
<p>stocks of these weapons unaccounted for by the previous weapons inspectors.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“And in addition there is real concern that there is ballistic missile technology.”</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the reason Iraq might not be letting inspections take place </p>
<p>was because “the last time the inspectors were in there, they uncovered so much that </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime was deeply embarrassed”. He also argued that people would “think </p>
<p>about it differently once they see the evidence”.</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diary on 3 September:</p>
<p>“The hardest [question] was: ‘Why now? What was it that we knew now that we </p>
<p>didn’t before that made us believe we had to do it now?’ It was not going to be </p>
<p>at all easy to sell the policy in the next few months …”</p>

<p><b>144. </b> Mr Campbell added that announcing the publication of the dossier would “raise </p>
<p>expectations massively. Today was about beginning to turn the tide of public opinion and </p>
<p>it was going to be very tough indeed.”</p>
<p><b>145. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair for a statement addressing whether, before his press </p>
<p>conference in Sedgefield, he had refreshed his memory in relation to the 15 March 2002 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, ‘The Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>146. </b> In his statement, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The basis for the statements I made on the issue of Saddam and WMD were </p>
<p>based, of course, on the JIC Assessments and on the whole history of Saddam </p>
<p>and WMD going back over many years, including his use of chemical weapons, the </p>
<p>findings of previous UN inspectors, his well documented attempts at concealment.</p>
<p>“… [F]or my press conference at Sedgefield … I requested and received a special </p>
<p>briefing from the FCO. I would probably also have re-read the JIC report of </p>
<p>15 March 2002 and the list of unaccounted for items from the UNSCOM reports. </p>
<p>I draw attention to the first part of the [FCO] briefing of 2 September 2002, in </p>
<p>particular to the reference that ‘we believe that Iraq has recently accelerated its </p>
<p>weapons programme’; ‘increased nuclear procurement’; and to the fact that UN </p>
<p>inspectors in 1998 ‘were unable to account for thousands of tonnes of so-called </p>
<p>precursor chemicals’.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>147. </b> As Section 4.1 sets out, the decision to produce a document for publication setting </p>
<p>out the facts on WMD in relation to countries of concern, including Iraq, was taken in </p>
<p>mid-February 2002 and was briefed to the press shortly thereafter.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>148. </b> Speculation about the publication of a document on Iraq’s WMD and its </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Asked what had led to his change of mind in early September and the decision </p>
<p>to publish the dossier, Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry: </p>
<p>“What changed was really two things which came together. First … there was </p>
<p>a tremendous amount of information and evidence coming across my desk as </p>
<p>to the weapons of mass destruction and the programmes … that Saddam had. </p>
<p>“There was also a renewed sense of urgency, again, in the way that this was being </p>
<p>publicly debated …</p>
<p>“President Bush and I had a telephone call towards the end of that [August] break </p>
<p>and we decided … we really had to confront this issue, devise our strategy and get </p>
<p>on with it and I took the view … that we really had to disclose what we knew or as </p>
<p>much as we could of what we knew.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Blair added: “The aim of the dossier was to disclose the reason for our concern </p>
<p>and the reason why we believed this issue had to be confronted.” </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… wanted to publish information as he saw it was because he thought it was </p>
<p>important that the public were as aware as possible of the pressures that he had </p>
<p>seen coming across his desk.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that the decision to bring forward the publication of </p>
<p>the dossier was a way of trying to calm the situation.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> Mr Blair had wanted “to set out </p>
<p>for the public, in as accessible a way as possible, the reasons why he had become more </p>
<p>concerned” about Iraq.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> In his memoir, published in 2010, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“One other rather fateful decision was taken at that time. Reasonably enough, </p>
<p>people wanted to see the evidence on Saddam and WMD. This evidence was </p>
<p>contained in intelligence. It was not practice, for obvious reasons, to disclose </p>
<p>intelligence. We decided we had to do it. Many times afterwards, I regretted the </p>
<p>decision. The ‘dossier’, as it was called, later became the subject of the most vicious </p>
<p>recrimination and condemnation. In reality, it was done because we could see no </p>
<p>way of refusing it, given the clamour for it. The very unprecedented nature of it was, </p>
<p>however, part of the problem. Both opponents and supporters of the war were urging </p>
<p>us to share with the public the evidence we had.”</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>156. </b> In his memoir, published in 2012, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“Earlier in the summer there had been a mounting and understandable clamour </p>
<p>for more and more explanation about why we and the US were now taking the </p>
<p>threat from Iraq so much more seriously than we had before 9/11. People assumed </p>
<p>we must know much more than we were letting on. Through the CIA [Central </p>
<p>Intelligence Agency], SIS and the other agencies, we did … have access to what we </p>
<p>believed to be reliable intelligence about Saddam’s continuing intentions in respect </p>
<p>of his banned weapons. The mistake we made – on both sides of the Atlantic – was </p>
<p>to believe that the best way to respond was to include a declassified summary of </p>
<p>some of the intelligence in the dossier.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>157.  Mr Blair’s announcement galvanised thinking on the draft Iraq dossier.</b></p>
<p><b>158. </b> On 2 September, in response to a discussion with Mr Rycroft about “the need for </p>
<p>a capping piece for the Iraq dossier currently sitting on the shelf”, Mr McKane provided </p>
<p>a draft, which set out “the argument for effective action against Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr McKane concluded:</p>
<p>“If you or David think the draft is worth developing and refining, the next step would </p>
<p>be for me to circulate it … We should also, as you and I agreed, be considering </p>
<p>whether there is more up to date material which could be incorporated in the </p>
<p>dossier itself.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> The draft referred to the general threat from the spread of chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons and stated that Saddam Hussein’s regime was a “particularly dangerous </p>
<p>example” of that general threat because of “his track record and his continuing flouting </p>
<p>of international norms of behaviour. That is why it is so important to deal now with the </p>
<p>threat he represents.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> The draft also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since 1998, the UN had “tried repeatedly to persuade Saddam to comply” with </p>
<p>his obligations, but he had sought “At every turn … to divert attention from his </p>
<p>failure to comply.” The “only reasonable explanation” for that “prevarication” was </p>
<p>that “he has something to hide, something he is unwilling to give up”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [W]e cannot wait for ever for the right answer from Saddam, when all the </p>
<p>time he is engaged in work on weapons which could threaten our [sic] own </p>
<p>population and certainly the population of his neighbours. If we were to do so, </p>
<p>particularly after 11 September, and our patience were to be rewarded with </p>
<p>another devastating attack, we would rightly be castigated for our inaction.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The facts in the dossier “as a whole” presented a picture of a regime which </p>
<p>was “so opposed to international norms of behaviour that it must be confronted </p>
<p>effectively now”.</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Mr Rycroft suggested that Mr McKane should develop the draft.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Sir David Manning wrote: “Yes. Let’s see what the response is.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>164. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr McKane wrote that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… had decided the dossier should be ready for publication within weeks, in </p>
<p>order to explain publicly why effective action had to be taken to counter the threat </p>
<p>posed by Iraq. This is brought out in the draft ‘capping piece’ which I sent to </p>
<p>Matthew Rycroft …”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>165. </b> Asked about the origins of the capping note, Mr McKane told the Inquiry that it </p>
<p>“followed an exchange with either Sir David Manning or Matthew Rycroft in which we </p>
<p>agreed that the draft needed something … which would encapsulate the main points”.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>166. </b> Mr McKane subsequently stated:</p>
<p>“I suppose what I was doing was trying to answer the question: why should we take </p>
<p>action now? So it is related to the shift in approach that was marked by the meeting </p>
<p>on 23 July and the greater sense of pace and urgency that was injected thereafter.”</p>

<p> Dr Williams thought that it would </p>

<p><b>168. </b> Commenting on the draft UK dossier, Dr Williams wrote that he shared many </p>
<p>of Mr John Williams’ views: </p>
<p>“The text I’ve seen is not significantly different from one I saw in late Spring.</p>
<p>“It is certainly not a ‘killer’ dossier. The material is often poorly presented </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a “script on why the problem of Iraqi WMD was being treated differently from </p>
<p>other WMD programmes”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “note setting out the broader problem of WMD proliferation and the action </p>
<p>we are taking to tackle it”.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>177. </b> The script on Iraq’s WMD stated that there were:</p>
<p>“… particular concerns about Iraq’s WMD programmes. Since Iraq’s persistent </p>
<p>obstruction forced the UN Inspectors to leave in 1998, Iraq has maintained its </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons programmes, and is developing ballistic missiles </p>
<p>capable of delivering them to targets beyond the 150km limit imposed by the UN </p>
<p>for defensive systems.” </p>
<p><b>178. </b> The “key differences between Iraq and other countries such as Iran and </p>
<p>North Korea” were that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had used WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had uncovered the scale of his programmes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “been shown to have broken every commitment it has ever made </p>
<p>under the NPT [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons] and BTWC </p>
<p>[Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention] (it is not a member of the CWC </p>
<p>[Chemical Weapons Convention])”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “in flagrant violation” of 14 UN Security Council resolutions relating to </p>
<p>its WMD and missile programmes, and was in violation of nine of the remaining </p>
<p>13 obligations on other issues.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> The script added that the UK approaches “to Iraq and to other governments with </p>
<p>WMD programmes of concern” were “fundamentally identical”: political and diplomatic </p>
<p>engagement. But:</p>
<p>“… in the case of Iraq, the diplomatic route has been constantly obstructed by </p>
<p>Saddam’s intransigence and duplicity, and has been blocked altogether since </p>
<p>Inspectors left in 1998 – leaving us no alternative but to consider other options.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> The note, ‘Proliferation of WMD: The Wider Context’, described the “wider problem </p>
<p>of the proliferation of WMD and long-range missiles” and “An additional increased </p>
<p>concern since 11 September 2001” that international terrorists would obtain WMD. </p>
<p>Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Libya and Syria were identified as “priorities for counter-action </p>
<p>… (as the most likely to pose a threat to the UK, our allies, or deployed UK forces)”. </p>

<p>147</p>
<p><b>181. </b> The note stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was “keen to raise awareness of the WMD and missile threat beyond </p>
<p>the US/UK partnership, to draw others into closer co-operation in countering </p>
<p>the threat”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[M]ain efforts over the past year” had been directed “at key EU partners – </p>
<p>particularly the <b>French</b> and <b>Germans</b>”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was the US “partner of choice in countering WMD and missile </p>
<p>proliferation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US Administration was “clearly more interested in deploying tools at the </p>
<p>robust end of the spectrum”, including “direct action”, rather than “diplomatic </p>
<p>processes to strengthen the treaty regimes or build wider multilateral consensus </p>
<p>against proliferation”. </p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Tim Dowse, Head of FCO Counter-Proliferation Department in 2002, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that, in a paper on counter-proliferation strategy produced in July/August 2002, </p>
<p>Iraq was viewed as a priority because it might be “the exception to the broader rule that </p>
<p>WMD programmes are generally acquired for defensive purposes”.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Dowse added that it had been the political context which made Iraq a priority.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> In a subsequent private hearing, Sir William Ehrman, FCO Director International </p>
<p>Security in 2002, told the Inquiry that the paper, approved by Mr Blair in August </p>
<p>2002, stated:</p>
<p>“In country programme terms, our top CP [counter-proliferation] priorities are:</p>
<p>“Iraq – because its WMD may be the exception to the rule that such programmes </p>
<p>are usually driven by defensive needs and, more importantly, are the most likely </p>
<p>to be deployed against UK forces and those of our allies.”</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Asked if the “threat from WMD from Iraq” would have continued to be contained </p>
<p>if sanctions had been maintained, Mr Dowse told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the nuclear threat would have been contained and there would have been </p>
<p>constraints on his other activities, although we believed he was making progress </p>
<p>with missiles, with chemical and biological weapons, despite the constraints.</p>
<p>“The problem was … we did not have high confidence that the sanctions regime </p>
<p>would be maintained …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>187. </b> In response to a request from Sir Michael Jay, Mr John Williams provided advice </p>
<p>on a media strategy for Iraq on 4 September.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Williams advised that there was a lot to be done, but it could be done “with </p>
<p>simple arguments and plain language”. Mr Blair’s press conference had shown that </p>
<p>the media landscape could be changed “in a way that separates the hard core critics </p>
<p>from the doubters who are open to persuasion”. The key would be to “put the burden </p>
<p>of the argument on to Iraq and on the critics”:</p>
<p>“Detailed facts will be necessary but not enough.</p>
<p>“We should make the case with conviction … The tone … should reflect difficult </p>
<p>choices, which on balance leave us no alternative but to protect the peace and </p>
<p>stability we have come to take for granted … The public … needs to feel it shares </p>
<p>a sense of reaching a point where minds have to be made up … In the end, it will </p>
<p>come down to an appeal for the public’s trust that the Prime Minister has got a big </p>
<p>judgement right in circumstances where there is no easy answer.”</p>
<p><b>189. </b> The means of dealing with Iraq were “not yet decided”.</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Mr Williams set out the elements of a possible argument:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime was a “uniquely dangerous example” of a threat to peace.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s record was “a challenge to the whole international </p>
<p>community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “harsh facts have to be faced, and addressed, whether or not we are able </p>
<p>to deal with the threat by asserting the authority of the United Nations, whether </p>
<p>or not military force becomes necessary”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat would not go away, it would “become more dangerous”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The events of 11 September 2001 had shown that distant threats could not </p>
<p>safely be ignored.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had in the past provided a safe haven for terrorists.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> There was a “need to stress the general threat Iraq poses to international peace </p>
<p>and stability, as well as the direct and specific threat of its WMD being used against </p>
<p>us”. Mr Williams also cited Saddam Hussein’s human rights abuses.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Mr Williams stated that the “evidence dossier” was:</p>
<p>“… unlikely to be enough by itself to win the argument: it will convince persuadable </p>
<p>opinion only if launched in the right environment, framed by a broad case that </p>
<p>establishes Iraq as a threat to international peace and security. There is no ‘killer </p>
<p>fact’ in the dossier which ‘proves’ that Saddam must be taken on now, or this or that </p>
<p>weapon will be used against us.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>“But it does make a convincing case that Iraq has been trying to recruit people for a </p>
<p>nuclear weapons programme and to acquire materials usable in such a programme; </p>
<p>and that it has been trying to extend the range of some missiles in breach of Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions. These are too deeply buried … there is too long a prologue </p>
<p>on what was happening before the inspectors were withdrawn. The dossier should </p>
<p>either be re-structured, and perhaps pared down, or have an executive summary.”</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Williams warned that the exercise would be “counter-productive” if the media </p>
<p>was allowed to “trap” the Government “into having to provide ‘proof’ to Appeal Court </p>
<p>standards”. The focus should be on an audience that knew we could not have “certain </p>
<p>knowledge of what is going on inside a closed tyranny”, but would:</p>
<p>“… take seriously a careful assessment which avoids over-statement and appeals </p>
<p>to people to trust the judgement of those taking the decisions … understand that </p>
<p>intelligence is partial, dangerous to acquire and limited in what it is safe to put out </p>
<p>in public. If the dossier is judged by these … standards it will be worth doing.”</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr Williams also addressed the possible timing of publication depending on </p>
<p>whether “the UN route” was agreed, and the need for a longer-term strategy for Iraq. </p>
<p>He concluded that Mr Blair’s press conference had already had an impact, with a <i>Sky</i> </p>
<p>poll showing “48 percent favour military action, with 52 percent against”. This suggested </p>
<p>that public opinion was more fluid than the critics believed. </p>
<p><b>Mr Campbell’s meeting, 5 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>195.  Sir David Manning commissioned Sir Richard Dearlove to examine whether </b></p>

<p><b>196. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Hutton Inquiry that Sir David Manning had </p>
<p>telephoned him on the morning of 4 September and they had:</p>
<p>“… discussed … to what extent it would be possible to put intelligence from my </p>
<p>service into the public domain; and I said that I thought it would be possible … but </p>
<p>I would insist on grounds of source protection on having the last word in withholding </p>

<p>publication of the dossier on 25 September.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Sir Richard also told Mr Straw that the draft dossier “was weakened by the JIC </p>

<p>91</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Asked what his comment about the draft being weakened by the JIC’s doctrinaire </p>

<p>“Good question. I mean, the answer is I have seen this reference and I’m not sure. </p>

<p>material from one of our sources and how it was presented. I’m sorry. I mean, I’m </p>

<p>“… if he would like to give me the material he intended to use, so that I could show </p>
<p>him how to produce it in publishable form. I did this over the weekend. It was a </p>
<p>routine job of taking the strongest points and putting them in an executive summary, </p>
<p>while taking care to reflect their content accurately, and introducing them with the </p>
<p>sort of language that was familiar from speeches and interviews given by … [Mr Blair </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>224. </b> The document which Mr Williams produced was released by the FCO in February </p>
<p>2008 in response to a Freedom of Information request.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Williams told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Some journalists have detected similarity between the shape of my effort and the </p>
<p>finished product, but it would have been surprising if an organisation which had never </p>
<p>produced a public document [had] not taken some pointers from a professional.”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Following Mr Campbell’s meeting on 5 September, four drafts of the dossier </p>
<p>were prepared and circulated for comment to JIC members and other officials in the </p>
<p>FCO, the MOD, the Cabinet Office and the Intelligence Agencies, on 10, 16, 19 and </p>
<p>20 September. Each is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, Camp David, </b></p>
<p><b>7 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>227.  In a press conference before the discussions at Camp David Mr Blair stated </b></p>
<p><b>that Iraq had to be dealt with. The purpose of the meeting with President Bush </b></p>
<p><b>was to work out the strategy. </b></p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Camp David on 7 September, and </p>
<p>the press conference which preceded the meeting, are addressed in Section 3.4.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> In the press conference, Mr Blair stated: </p>
<p>“The point I would emphasise … is the threat from Saddam Hussein and weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction, chemical, biological, potentially nuclear weapons capability, </p>
<p>that threat is real. We only need to look at the report from the International </p>
<p>Atomic [Energy] Agency this morning</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> showing what has been going on at the </p>
<p>former nuclear site to realise that. And the policy of inaction is not a policy we can </p>
<p>responsibly subscribe to. So the purpose of our discussion today is to work out the </p>
<p>right strategy for dealing with this, because deal with it we must.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>230. </b> In response to a question, Mr Blair emphasised concern about Iraq’s attempts </p>
<p>to develop nuclear weapons and the importance of the IAEA report he had mentioned </p>
<p>which showed there was “a real issue that has to be tackled here”. He stated that, on the </p>
<p>way to Camp David, he had been reading “the catalogue of attempts by Iraq to conceal </p>
<p>its weapons of mass destruction, not to tell the truth … over a period of years”.</p>

<p>107 </p>
<p>The IAEA issued a press release (IAEA Press Release 2002/11) on 6 September 2002 stating: “With </p>
<p>reference to an article published today in the New York Times, the International Atomic Energy Agency </p>
<p>would like to state that it has no new information on Iraq’s nuclear weapons programme since 1998 when </p>
<p>its inspectors left Iraq. Only through a resumption of inspection … can the Agency draw any conclusion </p>
<p>with regard to Iraq’s compliance with its obligations … relating to its nuclear activities.”</p>

<p>155</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Asked about international support, Mr Blair replied that:</p>
<p>“… people were asking perfectly reasonable questions … but the one thing no one </p>
<p>can deny is that Saddam Hussein is in breach of the United Nations resolutions </p>
<p>on weapons of mass destruction … that that poses a threat not just to the region, </p>
<p>because there is no way, if those weapons are used, that the threat would simply </p>
<p>stay in the region.</p>
<p>“People understand that. Now we have got to make sure that we work out a way </p>
<p>forward that, of course, mobilises the maximum support, but does so on the basis </p>
<p>of removing a threat that the United Nations itself has determined is a threat to the </p>
<p>whole world.”</p>
<p><b>232. </b> The British journalists covering the Camp David meeting focused on the </p>
<p>WMD dossier. </p>
<p><b>233. </b> The<i> Sunday Express</i> anticipated a “Dossier of Doom”.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>234. </b> An editorial in the<i> News of the World </i>claimed that the dossier would be “as </p>
<p>devastating as it is vital”. It would show that “evil Saddam has enough chemical and </p>
<p>biological stocks to attack the entire planet, and the missile technology to deliver them”. </p>
<p>It would confirm that he is on the brink of nuclear capability. The editorial concluded: </p>
<p>“We believe Mr Blair CAN convince us a military attack on Iraq is right. We have faith </p>
<p>in our Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>235.  In their meeting, Mr Blair told President Bush that he was in no doubt about </b></p>
<p><b>the need to deal with Saddam Hussein. </b></p>
<p><b>236.  Mr Blair also set out the need to build a case to persuade the international </b></p>
<p><b>community of the threat posed by Iraq, including the potential for fusion of WMD </b></p>
<p><b>and terrorism. </b></p>
<p><b>237. </b> During the discussion with President Bush, Mr Blair set out the need to make a </p>
<p>good public case against Saddam Hussein, publishing all the evidence. The UK would </p>
<p>publish a dossier. He stated that the US and UK: </p>
<p>“… must build our case, persuading the international community of the nature of the </p>
<p>threat. In particular we must get over to our publics the reality that any crisis in the </p>
<p>Gulf generated by Saddam would inevitably involve us.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>238. </b> Later Mr Blair stated that there was a need to explain the case for action fully to </p>
<p>public opinion: “While insisting that no-one wanted war, we must spell out why we had </p>
<p>to act.” That included reminding people of the horrors of Saddam Hussein’s regime. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Blair said there was a:</p>
<p>“… natural reluctance to do difficult things, made worse by ignorance … of Saddam’s </p>
<p>capabilities and intentions. We had to correct this, at the same time answering the </p>
<p>legitimate question of why we were taking action now. 11 September [2001] was a </p>
<p>powerful argument for dealing with threats before they materialised … At some point, </p>
<p>WMD and terrorism would come together, with appalling consequences, unless we </p>
<p>took action.”</p>
<p><b>240. </b> A plenary meeting between President Bush and Mr Blair and their teams followed </p>
<p>the restricted discussion.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>241. </b> Presentational issues were discussed between officials and in the plenary, </p>
<p>including the “Why now?” question.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Blair stated that since 1998, there was evidence, including in the 6 September </p>
<p>International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) report (see previous comment), of continued </p>
<p>development of WMD. He also thought that the nature of the Iraqi regime “should </p>
<p>become part of our case on WMD”; and that: “We needed an active strategy to take the </p>
<p>debate to the rest of the world.” He set out the UK’s plans to publish the dossier within </p>
<p>a few weeks. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Campbell emphasised the need for people “to understand what BW actually </p>
<p>did”; and that the “media threshold would be high, so the dossier would need to include </p>
<p>new facts from the last four years”.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>244.  On 9 September, the JIC issued an Assessment of Iraq’s possession </b></p>
<p><b>of chemical and biological weapons and possible scenarios for their use. </b></p>
<p><b>245.  The Assessment contained a number of significant changes which </b></p>
<p><b>strengthened previous JIC judgements on Iraq’s possession of chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological weapons and the likelihood of their use. </b></p>
<p><b>246. </b> In response to the request from Sir David Manning for advice on the possible </p>
<p>scenarios for Iraqi use of chemical and biological weapons, the JIC commissioned </p>
<p>an Assessment.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>247. </b> The Assessment was discussed in “an informal CIG [Current Intelligence Group] </p>
<p>of experts” and then considered by the JIC on 4 September. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>248. </b> A number of key points were made in the JIC discussion:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once finalised it [the Assessment] would be of immense interest to Ministers </p>
<p>and officials, and would help to underline the importance and seriousness of the </p>
<p>threat Iraq posed with these weapons. The fact that Saddam Hussein possessed </p>
<p>these capabilities, and that he showed every sign of being prepared to use them, </p>
<p>was significant.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Another important message, which needed to be brought out more clearly </p>
<p>in the draft, was that if the chips were down, and Saddam believed his regime </p>
<p>to be under real threat of extinction, nothing was going to deter him from using </p>
<p>such weapons. Readers of the paper needed to be reminded of Saddam’s </p>
<p>unpredictability, and of the fact that his thought processes did not work </p>
<p>in a recognisably Western rational and logical way.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The draft should also distinguish more clearly between the three different </p>
<p>ways in which Iraq might use its offensive chemical or biological capabilities: in </p>
<p>weaponised form against military targets; in an unconventional attack on military </p>
<p>targets; or as part of a sponsored terrorist attack aimed at spreading fear and </p>
<p>influencing public attitudes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[S]ince the draft had been written and circulated, an important and valuable </p>
<p>supply of new intelligence had been received, from a variety of sources, judged </p>
<p>by the producers to be reliable and authoritative. The draft needed to … include </p>
<p>this intelligence with an expert assessment of its significance.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It [the Assessment] also needed to be clearer which of its judgements were </p>
<p>based on firm intelligence, which were based more on informed assessment </p>
<p>or interpretation, and where the major gaps in the UK’s knowledge and </p>
<p>understanding of Iraq’s capabilities remained.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It was possible that further insights from intelligence would be forthcoming </p>
<p>in the relatively near future. These might not only inform any future Assessments </p>
<p>but might also need to be reflected somehow in the dossier on Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction programmes that was being prepared for publication.” </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Mr Scarlett proposed that the paper should be revised to reflect the discussion and </p>
<p>then reviewed “at working level by the relevant experts”. Once that was done, the paper </p>
<p>would be issued in its final form.</p>
<p><b>250. </b> The Key Judgements of the JIC Assessment of 9 September stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared </p>
<p>to use it.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Faced with the likelihood of military defeat and being removed from power, </p>
<p>Saddam is unlikely to be deterred from using chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>by any diplomatic or military means.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of chemical and biological weapons prior to any military attack would </p>
<p>boost support for US-led action and is unlikely.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam is prepared to order missile strikes against Israel, with chemical </p>
<p>or biological warheads, in order to widen the war once hostilities begin.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam could order the use of CBW weapons in order to deny space and </p>
<p>territory to Coalition Forces, or to cause casualties, slow any advance, and sap </p>
<p>US morale.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If not previously employed, Saddam will order the indiscriminate use of whatever </p>
<p>CBW weapons remain available late in a ground campaign or as a final act </p>
<p>of vengeance. But such an order would depend on the availability of delivery </p>
<p>means and the willingness of commanders to obey.”</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>251. </b> The Assessment stated that it had taken “account of new intelligence that has </p>
<p>recently become available on Iraq’s intentions”. Unusually, it stated explicitly that it had </p>
<p>“an intelligence cut off point of 4 September”. </p>
<p><b>252. </b> To provide context, the Introduction to the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Recent intelligence casts light on Iraq’s holdings of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>and on its doctrine for using them. Intelligence remains limited and Saddam’s own </p>
<p>unpredictability complicates judgements about Iraqi use of these weapons. Much </p>
<p>of this paper is necessarily based on judgement and assessment.” </p>
<p><b>253. </b> The JIC added:</p>
<p>“Iraq used chemical weapons on a large scale during the Iran/Iraq War. Use on the </p>
<p>same scale now would require large quantities of chemical weapons and survivable </p>
<p>delivery means in the face of overwhelming US air superiority. Iraq did not use </p>
<p>chemical weapons during the [1991] Gulf War. Intelligence suggests that Iraq may </p>
<p>have used the biological agent, aflatoxin, against the Shia population in 1991. We </p>
<p>do not believe that Iraq possesses nuclear weapons and there is no intelligence that </p>
<p>Iraq is currently interested in radiological dispersal devices.”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Other key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002: ‘Iraqi Use of Chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and Biological Weapons – Possible Scenarios’ </b></p>
<p><b>Chemical and biological capabilities </b></p>
<p>“Based on intelligence on the nature of Iraqi CBW weapons, known delivery means, </p>
<p>continuing procurement activity, and experience from previous conflicts”, the JIC judged: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq currently had available “either from pre Gulf War stocks or more recent </p>
<p>production, a number of biological warfare (BW) and chemical warfare (CW) </p>
<p>agents and weapons”.</p>

<p>159</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“following a decision to do so, Iraq could produce significant quantities of </p>
<p>mustard agent within weeks … [and] the nerve agents sarin and VX within </p>
<p>months (and in the case of VX … may have already done so)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Production of VX and sarin would be “heavily dependent on hidden stocks of </p>
<p>precursors, the size of which are unknown”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could produce “more biological agents within days”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the commencement of large-scale production of chemical and biological agents </p>
<p>would probably go undetected, and a decision to do so may already have been </p>
<p>taken. The location of production facilities is unknown.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Even if stocks of weapons were “limited”, that would “allow for focused strikes </p>
<p>against key military targets or for strategic purposes (such as a strike against </p>
<p>Israel or Kuwait)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “could deliver CW and BW agents by a variety of means including free fall </p>
<p>bombs, airborne sprays, artillery shells, mortar bombs and battlefield rockets”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had told UNSCOM that it had “filled 25 warheads with anthrax, botulinum </p>
<p>toxin and aflatoxin” for the Al Hussein missile and “developed 50 chemical </p>
<p>warheads” for the missile.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq retained “up to 20 Al Hussein and a limited number of launchers”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“One intelligence report suggests that Iraq has ‘lost’ the capability to develop </p>
<p>warheads capable of disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it </p>
<p>would take six months to overcome the ‘technical difficulties’”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“an emergency operational capability with conventional warheads” was “probably </p>
<p>available” for the Al Samoud and Ababil-100 short-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq may have other toxins, chemical and biological agents we do not </p>
<p>know about”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the effectiveness of any CBW attack would depend on the method of delivery, </p>
<p>concentration of the target, dissemination efficiency, meteorological conditions </p>
<p>and the availability of suitable defensive counter measures”. </p>
<p>“Other recent intelligence” indicated that:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>production of chemical and biological weapons is taking place; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam attaches great importance to having CBW, is committed to using </p>
<p>CBW if he can and is aware of the implications of doing so. Saddam wants </p>
<p>it to dominate his neighbours and deter his enemies who he considers are </p>
<p>unimpressed by his weakened conventional military capability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has learned from the Gulf War the importance of mobile systems that are </p>
<p>much harder to hit than static sites. Consequently Iraq has developed for the </p>
<p>military, fermentation systems which are capable of being mounted on road-</p>
<p>trailers or rail cars. These could produce BW agent;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has probably dispersed its special weapons, including its CBW weapons. </p>
<p>Intelligence also indicates that chemical and biological munitions could be with </p>
<p>military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes.”</p>
<p><b>Intentions for use</b></p>
<p>“Intelligence indicates that Saddam has already taken the decision that all resources, </p>
<p>including CBW, be used to defend the regime from attack. One report states that Saddam </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>would not use CBW during the initial air phase of any military campaign, but would use </p>
<p>CBW once a ground invasion of Iraq has begun. Faced with the likelihood of military </p>
<p>defeat and being removed from power, we judge that it is unlikely there would be a way </p>
<p>to deter Saddam from using CBW.”</p>
<p>The JIC judged that “several factors could influence the timing of a decision … </p>
<p>to authorise the use of CBW weapons”: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the availability of stocks of CW and BW agents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the survivability of … delivery means … Once a military campaign is under way </p>
<p>the pressure will increase to use certain assets before they are destroyed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the survivability of command and control mechanisms … Intelligence indicates </p>
<p>that Saddam’s son Qusay may already have been given authority to order the </p>
<p>use of CBW … Saddam may … specify in advance … the specific conditions in </p>
<p>which unit commanders should use these weapons e.g. once Coalition Forces </p>
<p>have crossed a particular geographical line;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reliability of the units … Late in any campaign commanders may not be </p>
<p>prepared to use CBW if they judge that Saddam is about to fall.”</p>
<p>The JIC also examined <b>possible scenarios</b> for the use of CBW weapons.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Before a conflict</b> – The JIC stated that the aim “would be to incapacitate </p>
<p>or kill Coalition troops in their concentration areas. Intelligence indicates that </p>
<p>… Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Israel and Kuwait” had been identified as targets. </p>
<p>“Turkey could also be at risk. Both chemical and biological weapons could be </p>
<p>used … But the use of CBW weapons carries serious risks and Saddam will </p>
<p>weigh up their military utility against the political costs. Use … would expose the </p>
<p>lies and deception … The early, widespread use of CBW or non-lethal agents </p>
<p>would affect Coalition military planning … On balance however we judge that the </p>
<p>political costs of using CBW weapons would outweigh the military advantages </p>
<p>and that Saddam would probably not use CBW … pre-emptively.”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>During the ground phase</b> – “There is no intelligence on specific Iraqi plans </p>
<p>for how CBW would be used in a conflict. Large numbers of chemical munitions </p>
<p>would need to be used to make a battlefield impact. BW could also be used </p>
<p>although it is less effective as a tactical weapon … But the use of even small </p>
<p>quantities of chemical weapons would cause significant degradation in Coalition </p>
<p>progress and might contribute to redressing Coalition conventional superiority </p>
<p>… Iraq could make effective use of persistent chemical agents to shape the </p>
<p>battlefield … by denying space and territory to Coalition Forces. Booby-traps </p>
<p>and improvised explosive devices could be used … to inflict local losses in urban </p>
<p>areas. It is also possible that Saddam would seek to use chemical and biological </p>
<p>munitions against any internal uprising; intelligence indicates that he is prepared </p>
<p>to deliberately target the Shia population. One report indicates that he would be </p>
<p>more likely to use CBW against Western forces than on Arab countries.”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Drawing Israel into the conflict</b> – “… One intelligence report suggests that if </p>
<p>Saddam were to use CBW, his first target would be Israel. Another … suggests </p>
<p>that Iraq believes Israel will respond with nuclear weapons if attacked with CBW </p>
<p>or conventional warheads. It is not clear if Saddam is deterred by this threat or </p>
<p>judges it to be unlikely in the face of US pressure on Israel not to take such a </p>
<p>course of action.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Unconventional use of CBW</b> – “Although there is no intelligence to indicate </p>
<p>Iraq has considered using chemical and biological agents in terrorist attacks, </p>
<p>we cannot rule out the possibility. […] Saddam could also remove his existing </p>
<p>constraints on dealing with Al Qaida … Intelligence indicates that Saddam </p>
<p>has specifically commissioned a team of scientists to devise novel means of </p>
<p>deploying CBW.”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“At the death” </b>– “In the last resort Saddam is likely to order the indiscriminate </p>
<p>use of whatever chemical and biological weapons remain available to him, in a </p>
<p>last attempt to cling on to power or to cause as much damage as possible in a </p>
<p>final act of vengeance. If he has not already done so by this stage Saddam will </p>
<p>launch CBW attacks on Israel. Implementation of such orders would depend on </p>
<p>the delivery means still available, the survivability of the command chain and the </p>
<p>willingness of commanders to obey.”</p>
<p><b>255.  The JIC acknowledged that much of the Assessment was “necessarily based </b></p>
<p><b>on judgement and assessment”.</b></p>
<p><b>256.  The Butler Report highlighted that the new judgements relied heavily </b></p>
<p><b>on inferences made by the JIC in its assessment of recently received </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence reports.</b></p>
<p><b>257. </b> Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that the Key Judgements in a JIC Assessment:</p>
<p>“… represent the formal view of the JIC on the central questions which are being </p>
<p>considered in the Assessment itself. They are not a summary of the main points </p>
<p>in the text. They are a bringing together and drawing on existing JIC Assessments, </p>
<p>a wide body of information which may be outside, much of it open source, secret </p>
<p>intelligence, in addition, and other relevant factors, such as past behaviour, past </p>
<p>actions and so on.”</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>258. </b> In response to the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) report in February </p>
<p>2004, the Government stated that the purpose of the Key Judgements section of </p>
<p>JIC Assessments was “to highlight the judgements to be drawn from the intelligence </p>
<p>assessed”; it was “not intended to be a summary of the main facts in the paper”.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>259. </b> The Butler Report stated that the JIC Assessment of 9 September “was prepared </p>
<p>in parallel with the Assessment of 21 August”, and that:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>260. </b> The first Key Judgement stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared </p>
<p>to use it.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> The Butler Report commented: </p>
<p>“The JIC made clear that much of the [9 September] Assessment was based on its </p>
<p>own judgement, drawing on the work done for its Assessment of 21 August. But we </p>
<p>were struck by the relative thinness of the intelligence base supporting the greater </p>
<p>firmness of the JIC’s judgements on Iraqi production and possession of chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons, especially the inferential nature of much of it.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Sir John Scarlett explained to the Inquiry that the “relationship between collection, </p>
<p>dissemination, comment, analysis, assessment and then policy-making was a subtle </p>
<p>one”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> Intelligence reports were issued by the collection agency and there was the </p>
<p>possibility for that agency “to make a comment on the report and very often put it into </p>
<p>context compared with what other reports have said on a given subject”. Reports were </p>
<p>then issued to customers across government “particularly … in the Defence Intelligence </p>
<p>Staff who are … an important body of analysts”. Those customers played a role in the </p>
<p>Current Intelligence Groups, but it was the job of the Assessments Staff to bring it all </p>
<p>together into a “big picture assessment”. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Sir John Scarlett stated that the 9 September Assessment had a “separate </p>
<p>judgement on the capabilities which existed”; and that it was not intended to be a worst </p>
<p>case scenario. The change was the firm judgement on Iraq’s current possession of </p>
<p>agents and weapons which:</p>
<p>“… referred to recent intelligence on the production of weapons now taking </p>
<p>place, the development of mobile systems and then, importantly, on the regime </p>
<p>and Saddam’s intent. The great importance that he attached to the possession </p>
<p>of chemical and biological weapons and his readiness to use them if necessary, </p>
<p>including to defend the regime from attack. </p>
<p>“He saw possession as a central feature of his regional power position and </p>
<p>continued ability to project influence.</p>
<p>“That intelligence on intent was significant – taken to be significant.</p>
<p>“It was also noted that we did not know specific plans for CBW use in the event </p>
<p>of conflict, the location of production facilities, the size of stocks.”</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Addressing the judgements that had been reached, Sir John Scarlett stated that </p>
<p>it was “not at all unusual for an intelligence base behind judgments to be limited or </p>
<p>described as sporadic and patchy”. The intelligence received in September was:</p>
<p>“… judged against a set of standing judgments from the past which I’d been at pains </p>
<p>to point out were already quite strong …”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Sir John subsequently stated: “We thought there was a sound intelligence base, </p>
<p>and we had a firm judgment. That’s the point I want to make.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Miller added:</p>
<p>“The discussion on 4 September at the JIC really was one that gelled with the very </p>
<p>firm view amongst the community about both the possession and the readiness to </p>
<p>use, on Saddam’s part, these weapons. </p>
<p>“We went away, in the light of that discussion, and wrote the paper which is the final </p>
<p>Assessment and expressed those views really quite specifically and as very firm </p>
<p>judgments which did, I think, pin down the view of the JIC community at that point. </p>
<p>It was the moment which sticks with me as being quite an important one in terms of </p>
<p>the arrival of new intelligence, and the precipitation of a discussion in the JIC which </p>
<p>led to a very firm expression of the judgments it had reached on both possession </p>
<p>and intent.”</p>
<p><b>267. </b> In response to a question about the categorical nature of the Key Judgements </p>
<p>in comparison with the detailed text in the 9 September Assessment, Sir John Scarlett </p>
<p>emphasised the importance of the distinction to be drawn between the strength of the </p>
<p>intelligence base on which an Assessment drew and the firmness of the JIC’s Key </p>
<p>Judgements; and that the JIC had, in September 2002, made “quite firm judgements” </p>
<p>despite the limitations in the intelligence.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>268. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that the document discussed by the JIC on 4 September:</p>
<p>“… wasn’t a full JIC Assessment, and it was full of … caveated language …</p>
<p>“In the discussion, the point was made by one of the JIC members that at this stage </p>
<p>we should, as a Committee, be very clear on what we were telling Ministers, and </p>
<p>there was a view expressed in terms that, despite the caveats in the document </p>
<p>prepared by the Assessment Staff, the view was that Saddam did possess the </p>
<p>weapons and would be ready to use them, and that was the view that was shared </p>
<p>around the JIC table, and which the JIC specifically wanted set out in those terms </p>
<p>as the advice that Ministers should read from their intelligence committee. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>“So you are absolutely right to distinguish between the body of the paper and </p>
<p>the judgements, but it is a distinction which was made consciously and with </p>
<p>deliberation.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the 9 September Assessment “stayed in </p>
<p>place as the confirmed view of the JIC in the months that followed and it didn’t change </p>
<p>significantly”.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>270.  The Assessments Staff and most members of the JIC were not aware at the </b></p>
<p><b>time of the details of the sourcing chains and that little of the information provided </b></p>
<p><b>by “reliable sources” was based on first-hand knowledge.</b></p>
<p><b>271. </b> In the context of comments on the intelligence underpinning the judgements </p>
<p>in the Assessment of 9 September, the Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>“… the JIC did not reflect in its Assessment, even if only to dismiss it, material in </p>
<p>one of those reports suggesting that most members of the Iraqi leadership were not </p>
<p>convinced that it would be possible to use chemical and biological weapons.”</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Commenting on the Assessment, the Butler Review concluded that:</p>
<p>“By mid-September 2002, therefore, readers of JIC assessments will have had </p>
<p>an impression of continuity with, but also some change from, the JIC assessment </p>
<p>of 15 March:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>The continuing clear strategic intent on the part of the Iraqi regime to pursue </p>
<p>its nuclear, biological, chemical and ballistic missile programmes.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Continuing efforts by the Iraqi regime to sustain and where possible develop </p>
<p>its indigenous capabilities.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>The apparent considerable development, drawing on these capabilities, of </p>
<p>Iraq’s ‘break-out’ potential. Although Iraq’s nuclear programme continued to be </p>
<p>constrained, there was strong evidence of continuing work on ballistic missiles, </p>
<p>including the development and production of systems with ranges in excess </p>
<p>of limits set by the United Nations. There was also evidence from one source, </p>
<p>supported by one complementary report, of Iraq having the ability to produce </p>
<p>biological agent in mobile facilities, and additional evidence of activity at one </p>
<p>site formerly associated with Iraq’s biological warfare programme. Finally, there </p>
<p>were recent intelligence reports, albeit mainly inferential, that Iraq was producing </p>
<p>chemical agent. For analysts, intelligence on Iraqi production of biological </p>
<p>and chemical agent would have been put alongside Iraq’s proven ability to </p>
<p>weaponise agent onto at least some delivery systems, and separate intelligence </p>

<p>reports on Saddam Hussein’s intention to use chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>if attacked.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>273. </b> The Butler Report stated that the “more definite judgements inside the </p>
<p>Assessment” were based on:</p>
<p>“… significant new intelligence in August and September 2002 … Four reports were </p>
<p>received in total, from three sources, which were influential … The first provided </p>
<p>material from a range of original informants reporting via an intermediary to the </p>
<p>source.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> We have noted, however, that the individual items from the informants did </p>
<p>not confirm directly that Iraq had chemical weapons. They came from senior Iraqi </p>
<p>officials who were believed at the time to have direct knowledge of Iraq’s intentions, </p>
<p>use, deployment or concealment of chemical weapons, but were based for most </p>
<p>of the informants on an assumption (not direct knowledge) that Iraq had such </p>
<p>weapons.”</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>274. </b> The Butler Report added:</p>
<p>“The second and third [reports] were from a source who had previously reported </p>
<p>reliably and who continued to do so in the following months. This source, too, could </p>
<p>not confirm from direct experience that Iraq had chemical weapons, resting on </p>
<p>reporting ‘<i>common knowledge’</i> within his circle that chemical agent production was </p>
<p>taking place. The second report from this source seems to us to duplicate much </p>
<p>of the first.”</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>275. </b> The fourth intelligence report described in the Butler Report: </p>
<p>“… was a single report, from a reliable and established source reporting a </p>
<p>new subsource who did not subsequently provide any further reporting, which </p>
<p>was described as ‘<i>confirming’</i> the intelligence on Iraqi mobile biological agent </p>
<p>production facilities received from the liaison service. Contrary to the JIC view at </p>
<p>the time, we believe that this report would have been more accurately described </p>
<p>as ‘<i>complementary’</i> to, rather than ‘<i>confirming’</i>, it.”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>276. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that the intelligence reports were from:</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“another one of the very well established sources […] about the determination </p>
<p>of the Iraqi regime to have CBW capable missiles, and the reliance on those </p>
<p>weapons as being a contributor or an important part of the ability to project </p>
<p>power in the region, to establish Iraq as a regional power”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a reliable source”, “about the use of CBW against the Shia population </p>
<p>internally”.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Mr Miller added:</p>
<p>“So there was a body of reporting by September that was talking not about technical </p>
<p>details of production, but about an understanding that these weapons were </p>
<p>available, and that there was a clear place for them in Iraq’s thinking about how </p>
<p>to conduct itself and how to maintain regional influence.”</p>
<p><b>278. </b> Mr Miller concluded:</p>
<p>“As the Assessment said, the intelligence was patchy. It was sporadic. It didn’t flow </p>
<p>through in great volumes routinely, particularly prior to the summer of 2002. But I think </p>
<p>the sense of the community was that yes, we are not getting a full picture, but we </p>
<p>are getting here a pretty consistent picture, even if it is a rather patchy one, sufficient </p>
<p>to inform these judgements, but certainly as additional intelligence came through </p>
<p>in the course of 2002, the sense was that that did then begin to provide a weightier </p>
<p>basis for reaching the conclusions that were set out in September.”</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Asked about the sources, their background and reliability and whether they were </p>
<p>providing hearsay evidence, Mr Miller explained:</p>
<p>“There were different sources. In the Assessment Staff we didn’t seek to have </p>
<p>expertise in the sourcing of the intelligence. So we relied on rather summary </p>
<p>accounts of the sourcing given in the reports, which tended to characterise it as new </p>
<p>or established, reliable or not yet proven, and we give some indication of whether </p>
<p>the reporting was direct or indirect.”</p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Miller told the Inquiry that reporting which influenced the Assessment came </p>
<p>from six new reports, “from apparently solid sources”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Sir John Scarlett stated that “at the time, the separation of the different streams </p>
<p>of reporting wasn’t always clear to the Assessment Staff”, and that:</p>

<p>prepared and discussed.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Sir John stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the source who had produced “the 45-minute report as well”, was “an </p>
<p>established and reliable reporting [source], but reporting from a line of … </p>
<p>named sub-sources”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that source “was quoting his knowledge” and had been “speaking in very definite </p>
<p>terms about their continued possession [of chemical and biological weapons]”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>283. </b> The “45 Minute” report “quoting the sub-sources on the intention to use [CBW]” </p>
<p>was withdrawn on 28 September 2004 (see Section 4.3).</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> Sir John said he had known </p>
<p>“in about May 2004” that there was “a big question mark about that report”.</p>
<p><b>284. </b> In relation to the production of biological agent, Sir John Scarlett stated that a </p>
<p>report in early September:</p>
<p>“… from an established and reliable source … referred to a … fermentation system, </p>
<p>which … was judged to be very likely to be a reference to the same general </p>
<p>capability and the same focus on mobile production capabilities, and that was </p>
<p>referred to in assessments after that as corroboration for the mobile reporting.</p>
<p>“So a lot of weight was placed upon the reporting […] from that source.”</p>

<p><b>287. </b> Asked how much the JIC had known about the sources, Mr Miller added:</p>
<p>“Generally not a great deal. From time to time, when there was a particular source </p>
<p>which the agencies attached great weight to, there was some briefing given on why </p>
<p>they were attaching particular weight to a source. But it was all at a fairly high level </p>

<p>The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) published a dossier, <i>Iraq’s Weapons </i></p>
<p><i>of Mass Destruction: A Net Assessment</i>, on 9 September.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his press statement, the Director of the IISS, Dr John Chipman, said that the IISS </p>
<p>objective had been “<b>to assess, as accurately and dispassionately as possible, </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s current WMD capabilities</b>”.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> The task was challenging: “<b>Iraq made every </b></p>
<p><b>effort to obscure its past, obstruct dismantlement of its present assets, and retain </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities for the future</b>.”</p>
<p>Other comments made by Dr Chipman included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s experience showed that no on-site inspections could succeed </p>
<p>“unless inspectors develop an imaginative and carefully co-ordinated </p>
<p>counter-concealment strategy”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC would need “time to develop and refine the unique inspection </p>
<p>techniques required” and to develop “considerable field experience to develop </p>
<p>the necessary tradecraft to deal with Iraqi obfuscation efforts”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “strength of Baghdad’s commitment to possess WMD” was “measurable in </p>
<p>part by its efforts to resist unfettered UN inspections”.</p>
<p>The IISS dossier identified the differences in view amongst experts as to whether Iraq was </p>
<p>focused on reconstituting its biological and chemical warfare capabilities or was “prepared </p>
<p>to risk detection and re-invest massive resources in pursuit of nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>was, however, “general agreement” that it was “very unlikely to have achieved the ability </p>
<p>to produce sufficient fissile material for nuclear weapons”. But if Iraq:</p>
<p>“… were able to acquire sufficient fissile material from foreign sources, it could </p>
<p>probably produce nuclear weapons on short order, perhaps in a matter of months. </p>
<p>This is based on the plausible assumption that Iraqi designers, working from </p>
<p>the 1991 baseline, have been able to complete the preparations for building </p>
<p>a nuclear weapon …”</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>The IISS stated that Iraqi acquisition of fissile material was “not a high probability”, </p>
<p>but “it has to be seen as a real risk that could dramatically and quickly shift the balance </p>
<p>of power”.</p>
<p>The IISS regarded Iraq’s biological weapons programme as “the least understood and </p>
<p>accounted for by 1998”. Iraq could “plausibly” have retained substantial quantities of </p>
<p>growth media and BW agent. It was “not known for certain” whether Iraq had resumed </p>
<p>production of agent, but it seemed “a safe bet that it has, or will, in the face of an </p>
<p>impending attack”. </p>
<p>The IISS judged that, from Baghdad’s perspective, biological weapons presented “Iraq’s </p>
<p>closest approximation to nuclear weapons as an instrument of deterrence or terror”. </p>
<p>But, in practice, “the magnitude of Iraq’s BW threat depends on its delivery capability, </p>
<p>which appears limited”.</p>
<p>The IISS stated, however, that even if Iraq had not advanced the designs for missile </p>
<p>warheads since 1991, and depending on the agent used and a number of ambient factors, </p>
<p>“casualties in an unprotected population could run in the hundreds or even thousands”. </p>
<p>If Iraqi aircraft could survive opposing air forces and air defences, delivery by airborne </p>
<p>spray devices would be “even more deadly”.</p>
<p>The IISS described Iraq’s chemical weapons arsenal as “better known and less </p>
<p>threatening”. It had “probably retained a few hundred tonnes of mustard and enough </p>
<p>stable precursors to produce a few hundred tonnes of sarin/cyclosarin and perhaps a </p>
<p>similar amount of VX”. It could have mobilised production facilities to produce fresh CW </p>
<p>agent, but its current capability probably comprised “hundreds of tonnes of agent … and </p>
<p>perhaps a few thousand munitions”. Before 1991 it had had “thousands of tonnes of agent </p>
<p>and tens of thousands of effective munitions”. Iraq had an ability to “deliver chemical </p>
<p>warheads on its rocket and artillery pieces, as well as aerial bombs”, but its capability </p>
<p>effectively to deliver chemical munitions with missiles or aircraft over longer distances </p>
<p>was “questionable”. Unless Iraq had advanced its pre-1991 designs, its ability efficiently </p>
<p>to disseminate chemical agent with missile warheads was “extremely limited”. </p>
<p>The IISS concluded that Iraq most likely had a small force of ballistic missiles, “perhaps </p>
<p>a dozen or so”, with a range of 650km and capable of delivering CBW warheads.</p>
<p>Finally, the IISS stated:</p>
<p>“As in the past, the threat or use of force may compel Iraq to extend greater  </p>
<p>co-operation, but signs of weakness and division in the Security Council are likely </p>
<p>to invite Iraqi backsliding …</p>

<p><b>Confirmation of Mr Scarlett’s responsibility for producing the dossier</b></p>
<p><b>290.  On 9 September, it was confirmed that Mr Scarlett and the Assessments Staff </b></p>
<p><b>would be responsible for the production of the Iraq dossier. </b></p>
<p><b>291. </b> After a discussion with Mr Scarlett, Mr Campbell wrote setting out the process </p>
<p>by which the dossier would be produced:</p>
<p>“The first point is that this must be, and be seen to be, the work of you and your </p>
<p>team, and that its credibility depends fundamentally on that.</p>
<p>“The second is that you are working on a new dossier, according to the structure </p>
<p>we agreed at the meeting last week, to meet the new circumstances which have </p>
<p>developed over recent weeks and months. Therefore, the rush of comments on the </p>
<p>old dossier are not necessary or totally relevant. People should wait for the new one </p>
<p>which will be more detailed and substantial.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>292. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the structure agreed the previous week was “roughly”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>why the issue arose in the first place</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>why the inspection process was necessary</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the history of concealment and deception</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the story of inspectors, leading to their departure</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the story of weapons unaccounted for, and what they could do</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a section on ballistic missile technology</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CW/BW</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>nuclear </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the sanctions regime, and how the policy of containment has worked only  </p>
<p>up to a point</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>illicit money</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the repressive nature of the regime</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>why the history … makes us worried he cannot be allowed further to develop </p>
<p>these weapons.”</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Much of the content of the dossier would be “obviously historical”, and that was </p>
<p>“a vital part of the overall story”. Mr Campbell added:</p>
<p>“The media/political judgement will inevitably focus on ‘what’s new?’ and I was </p>
<p>pleased to hear from you and your SIS colleagues that, contrary to media reports </p>
<p>today, the intelligence community are taking such a helpful approach to this in </p>
<p>going through all the material they have. It goes without saying that there should </p>
<p>be nothing published that you and they are not 100 percent happy with.”</p>

<p><b>294. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote:</p>
<p>“Our public line is that the dossier will set out the facts which make HMG judge  </p>
<p>Iraq/WMD to represent a real threat. It will be detailed and comprehensive.”</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Campbell set out the need to avoid leaks and comments to the media which </p>
<p>might “talk up the dossier”, adding: </p>
<p>“We should be making clear that even with the intelligence material, the picture can </p>
<p>never be a complete one because the inspectors have been out for so long.”</p>
<p><b>296. </b> “[M]ost of the draft material” would be available later that day, “with the Agencies </p>
<p>providing the sections relevant to the middle part of our structure [Iraq’s chemical, </p>
<p>biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes], and the FCO providing the more </p>
<p>historical material”. Mr Scarlett would “want to go through the material before submitting </p>
<p>a consolidated draft to No.10 and others”. </p>
<p><b>297. </b> Mr Campbell would “chair a team”, including officials from the FCO and No.10, </p>
<p>who would “go through the document from a presentational point of view and make </p>
<p>recommendations” to Mr Scarlett, who would decide whether they would be incorporated </p>
<p>in the dossier. </p>
<p><b>298. </b> Once Mr Scarlett had reached a view on what would be “incorporated”, a </p>
<p>“judgement” would be needed on “whether a single person should be appointed </p>
<p>to write the final version”. </p>
<p><b>299. </b> Mr Blair had “expressed an interest in seeing an advanced draft”. The timing </p>
<p>and arrangements for the launch of the document, including the involvement of Mr Blair </p>
<p>and other Ministers, were to be addressed once an advanced draft of the document </p>
<p>was available. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Campbell concluded by referring to US intent to produce “a series of dossiers” </p>
<p>and wrote that he was “confident” that the UK dossier could complement rather than </p>
<p>conflict with them.</p>

<p>intelligence Agencies, Sir David Omand, Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, </p>

<p><b>302. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that he had had a meeting with Mr Scarlett on the dossier </p>
<p>before being “joined by three SIS people”, and they had “agreed a process for writing </p>
<p>the report”. He and Mr Scarlett had agreed that “the FCO was trying to take it over”, </p>

<p>between Sir David Manning, Mr Campbell and himself and their respective teams.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the dossier was “to present a more detailed account of Iraqi capabilities </p>
<p>to be placed in the wider context”.</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Mr Scarlett added:</p>
<p>“Unlike the previous drafts, it would refer specifically to intelligence material. It </p>
<p>was agreed that since this would now be an intelligence-based document I, as JIC </p>
<p>Chairman, rather than OD Secretariat would be in charge of the process. These </p>
<p>agreements were set out in detail in Alastair’s note to me of 9 September …”</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Mr Scarlett added that the drafting of the revised document was co-ordinated by </p>
<p>Mr Miller, “working with representatives of Departments, including DIS, SIS, GCHQ, </p>
<p>and FCO”. The draft had been discussed at “two meetings of two to three hours each” </p>
<p>and there had been “numerous exchanges of drafts and constant consultation between </p>
<p>the experts concerned”. The intelligence Agencies had agreed to the involvement of </p>
<p>Mr Daniel Pruce, a Press Officer in No.10, and Mr Williams and others from the FCO </p>
<p>Press Office. JIC members were asked to consult Ministers during the drafting process </p>
<p>“as appropriate”.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Mr Scarlett also wrote: </p>
<p>“The aim was to ensure that the public assessment deployed the intelligence </p>
<p>effectively, taking account of the reliability of the information and the demands </p>
<p>of source protection.”</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that he had had a discussion with Mr Campbell </p>
<p>before the meeting on 9 September to say that:</p>
<p>“… it was very important that only one person and one unit had ownership and </p>
<p>command and control of this exercise, that that should be me, that I wanted it stated </p>
<p>clearly in writing; and I wanted that to be the outcome of the meeting …”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the whole purpose of having the JIC own this document was in order to </p>
<p>provide the absolute clarity and certainty … that in the end they were perfectly </p>
<p>happy with this. And I think it was … it was essential that anything we said … </p>
<p>in the dossier we could hand on heart say: this is the assessment of the Joint </p>

<p><b>310. </b> A DIS record of a meeting held by Mr Miller on 9 September recorded that the DIS </p>
<p>had been asked to address a number of points including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the provision of more detail on Iraq’s military capability to use WMD”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the provision of more information on the retention of experts and expertise </p>
<p>relating to WMD”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“to provide information if possible on the diversion and attempted illicit </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“the provision of a timeline for the development of a nuclear weapon by Iraq </p>
<p>if it were to acquire fissile material.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>311.  Mr Scarlett produced a first draft of the new dossier on 10 September which </b></p>
<p><b>drew on the 9 September JIC Assessment and the recent intelligence reports </b></p>
<p><b>about Saddam Hussein’s willingness to use chemical and biological weapons. </b></p>
<p><b>The draft stated that Iraq could deploy such weapons within 45 minutes of the </b></p>
<p><b>order being given for their use. </b></p>
<p><b>312. </b> A first draft of the revised dossier was produced on 10 September and sent to </p>
<p>Mr Campbell, Mr Powell, Sir David Manning, Sir David Omand, the Private Secretaries </p>
<p>to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, Mr Desmond Bowen, who succeeded Mr McKane as Deputy </p>
<p>Head of OD Sec in the week beginning 9 September, and to Mr John Williams.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that he had had “considerable help from John Williams and </p>
<p>others in the Foreign Office”. The draft required further work and he could not confirm </p>
<p>that he was “content with the overall tone … and the balance between the main text </p>
<p>and the Annexes”, but it had “now reached the stage where it would be useful” to have </p>
<p>advice on presentation from Mr Campbell. Mr Williams might also offer further views.</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Mr Scarlett added that the draft drew “on all the available intelligence identified </p>
<p>so far”. He was “most grateful for the co-operation of the SIS, GCHQ and the DIS in </p>
<p>constructing the key section on Iraq’s capabilities”; and the drafters continued to “check </p>
<p>for any further intelligence for inclusion in the text”. </p>
<p><b>315. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded by asking recipients to “hold the text very tight” and </p>
<p>to “continue to refrain from public reference to its contents”.</p>
<p><b>316. </b> The draft Foreword drew heavily on Mr Williams’ 5 September revisions </p>
<p>to Mr McKane’s draft “capping piece”. </p>

<p>current capabilities and showed how the picture was “continuing to develop as new </p>
<p>information becomes available”. </p>
<p><b>318. </b> Specifically, the Executive Summary stated that recent intelligence had added </p>
<p>to the picture of Iraq’s capabilities and indicted that Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>attached “great importance to the possession of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>and that Saddam Hussein is committed to using them if necessary”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>envisaged “the use of weapons of mass destruction in its current military </p>
<p>planning and could deploy such weapons within 45 minutes of the order being </p>
<p>given for their use”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “begun dispersing its most sensitive weapons, equipment and material </p>
<p>because Saddam is determined not to lose the capabilities developed in the last </p>
<p>four years”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was “preparing plans to conceal evidence of its weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>from any renewed inspections, including by dispersing incriminating documents”;</p>

<p>had “acquired mobile laboratories for military use, corroborating earlier </p>
<p>report[ing] about the mobile production of biological warfare agents”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “purchased large quantities of uranium ore, despite having no civil nuclear </p>
<p>programme that could require it”.</p>
<p><b>319. </b> The draft comprised six sections:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime and his rise to power;</p>

<p>Iraq could “deliver chemical and biological agents using an extensive range </p>
<p>of artillery shells, free-fall bombs, sprayers and ballistic missiles”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence from reliable and well-informed sources has become available in </p>

<p>related to them.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[T]he order to produce … chemical and biological agents has been given”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence had confirmed that the Iraqi military had acquired mobile facilities </p>
<p>to produce biological agent.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If Iraq acquired sufficient fissile material from abroad we judge it would take at </p>
<p>least two years to make a working nuclear device. However, Iraq could produce </p>
<p>an improvised nuclear device within a few months but this would be unreliable.”</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Addressing the specific issue of the use of intelligence “about the deployability </p>
<p>of CBW within 45 minutes”, Mr Scarlett wrote in his minute to Mr Blair in June 2003:</p>
<p>“This intelligence came from a line of reporting judged to be reliable and was </p>
<p>consistent with standing JIC judgements it was included by the drafters and </p>
<p>approved by the JIC. It’s [sic] inclusion was not suggested by No.10. The report </p>
<p>was highlighted in the same terms in a JIC Assessment of 9 September.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Mr Scarlett added that the 9 September Assessment reflected other recently </p>
<p>received intelligence and that was “recorded in the dossier under the heading, </p>

<p><b>324.  The JIC discussed the dossier on Iraq in its meeting on 11 September, </b></p>

<p><b>the Committee’s authority would lend important weight to the dossier’s </b></p>

<p><b>had shed light on progress since 1998.</b></p>
<p><b>325. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote to JIC members on 10 September asking for comments on </p>

<p>“As I feared, the whole issue of Iraq considering the development of an IND has </p>
<p>gained momentum. I would like to delete all mention of INDs in the dossier, but </p>
<p>the CO [Cabinet Office] consider it vital to the picture for no sensible reason. </p>
<p>Unfortunately an Iraqi JIC paper referred to it (against DI52 advice) and that </p>
<p>is being used as a justification. This will probably grow as the dossier is released </p>
<p>to the press, with the result that the spotlight will be diverted from the real, important </p>

<p><b>332. </b> A separate email from the same DIS official stated that a member of his team </p>
<p>would “not give the idea of an IND time of day” and assessed there were only two </p>
<p>scenarios to consider:</p>
<p>“(a) If Saddam still thinks he has time on his side, he will try to develop a nuclear </p>
<p>weapon … Iraq won’t succeed while sanctions are in place, and will take at least </p>
<p>five years once sanctions are removed …</p>
<p>“(b) In the last resort – when his regime and he are about to fall with the US infantry </p>
<p>on the doorstep, he will use what ever he can do rapidly – eg indiscriminate </p>
<p>spreading of CB agents and toxic chemical … One point which I believe everyone </p>
<p>has missed in the ridiculous debate on INDs is that there will be one obvious last </p>
<p>ditch action that Saddam will take in the spirit of torching the oilfields as he retreated </p>
<p>in 1991 … demolish the store of natural and low-enriched yellowcake … in the </p>
<p>southern outskirts of Baghdad .. There is no risk of a nuclear blast … However … </p>
<p>Saddam would want to play on the irrational fears in Western opinion as he heads </p>
<p>for a safe haven. He would, of course, blame … the US …”</p>

<p><b>333. </b> The DIS official also provided draft language explaining how difficult nuclear </p>
<p>weapons were to make.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> At the JIC on 11 September, Mr Scarlett explained that his “purpose in circulating </p>
<p>the draft, and in tabling it for discussion, was to invite comments on its content. </p>

<p>“a. </p>
<p>the part of the draft that looked at what was known or assessed from </p>
<p>intelligence was at the heart of the dossier with the potential to have a significant </p>
<p>impact. It needed to be as factual as possible, and to convey accurately but </p>
<p>dramatically the rising concern about Iraq’s weapons programmes. It needed </p>
<p>in particular to emphasise the importance of recent intelligence in shedding light </p>
<p>on the progress Iraq had made since 1998, and on Saddam Hussein’s readiness </p>
<p>to deploy and use these weapons;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>it made good sense both to describe the way that the JIC and the central </p>
<p>intelligence machinery had kept Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programme </p>
<p>under regular review, and to outline in the main body of the text what the </p>
<p>Committee’s key judgements or messages to Ministers and policy makers since </p>

<p>OTHER COMMENTS ON 10 SEPTEMBER DRAFT DOSSIER</p>
<p><b>348.  Mr Bowen pointed out that it was unclear what Saddam Hussein intended </b></p>
<p><b>to do with any weapons of mass destruction and long-range ballistic missiles.</b></p>
<p><b>349. </b> Commenting on the draft dossier of 10 September, Mr Bowen wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The bit of the jigsaw that doesn’t quite hang together is what Saddam intends </p>
<p>to do with the WMD he has been so intent on acquiring. It is one thing to ask </p>
<p>the rhetorical question: what could they be used for except making mischief </p>
<p>regionally; it is another to be able to point to stated objectives either from the </p>
<p>intelligence or public documents. It is, of course, the case that you point to the </p>
<p>facts of Saddam’s aggression and repression and use of WMD; perhaps we can </p>
<p>make more of this and his unpredictability.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In looking at the WMD sections, you clearly want to be as firm and authoritative </p>
<p>as you can be. You will need to judge the extent to which you need to hedge </p>
<p>your judgements with … caveats. I appreciate that this can increase the </p>
<p>authenticity of the document in terms of it being a proper assessment, but that </p>

<p>I think we have moved away from promoting the idea that we are in imminent danger </p>

<p>is rather that Saddam has failed to abide by the UNSCRs and his flouting of </p>
<p>international law and continuing acquisition of WMD cannot be tolerated any longer. </p>
<p>This difference is important because the focus shifts to Saddam’s continuing efforts </p>
<p>to equip himself with WMD, which is what the evidence shows.” </p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>It is clear from the email that the timing of publication was uncertain, and that Mr Sedwill </p>
<p>and Mr Campbell had discussed the possibility of publication in the week beginning </p>
<p>17 September.</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Mr Sedwill commented that the draft was “much better than earlier drafts” and </p>
<p>“could move further in the direction of factual analysis”. The document needed to “set </p>
<p>out the problem, rather than the solution”; people “should conclude that for themselves”. </p>
<p>He made a number of detailed suggestions for additions and amendments to the draft. </p>
<p>His suggestions included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Executive Summary could be “tweaked a bit” to “explain the centrality </p>
<p>of WMD” to Saddam Hussein’s rule, for example his projection of power. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Crucially”, Section 2 needed to “explain the role of WMD in the political </p>
<p>mythology which has sustained the regime, implicitly why giving it up would </p>
<p>amount to a change of regime and how responsibility for WMD rests with those </p>
<p>parts of the apparatus on which Saddam depends for his own security. People </p>
<p>need to understand that for Saddam giving up WMD is not like a British Govt </p>
<p>deciding we don’t need Trident any more …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 3 should be depersonalised “a bit”, with references to “the regime” rather </p>
<p>than Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The effects of chemical and biological agents could be explained “more vividly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sections 3 and 4 should be combined to “demonstrate more explicitly the link </p>
<p>between UNSC [UN Security Council] action and persistent Iraqi obstruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The history of weapons inspections was “an interesting story and would give the </p>
<p>media a better feel for the difficulties they faced and the persistence of the Iraqi </p>
<p>obstruction”. It should be expanded.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 6, setting out the detail of Iraq’s programmes, was the “crux” of the </p>
<p>dossier and should be as factual as possible. </p>
<p><b>357. </b> Mr Sedwill subsequently reported that Mr Straw had endorsed his comments and </p>
<p>offered a number of additional points.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Straw’s suggestion that the Foreword should be signed by Mr Blair is addressed </p>
<p>later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> A junior official in the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York (UKMIS </p>
<p>New York) replied that it would “probably be a bit much to deposit the whole report with </p>
<p>the Security Council, though we could deposit something like Section 6 if this were </p>
<p>felt useful”.</p>

<p>suggested adding a number of points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Something showing the elaborate Iraqi apparatus of concealment would </p>
<p>demonstrate to just what lengths this government is going to keep its hands </p>
<p>on WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It “would be desirable to give more detail of dodgy procurements … We need </p>
<p>to show the lengths Iraq has been willing to go to get its hands on WMD </p>
<p>components”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Explaining why Iraq’s unilateral destruction of WMD was of such concern, </p>
<p>“ie it allowed Iraq to obscure its WMD stocks and capabilities, eg by claiming </p>
<p>to have destroyed more items than was actually the case”.</p>
<p>INSTRUCTIONS FROM NO.10</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s speech to the TUC, 10 September 2002</b></p>
<p>In the first section of his speech to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on 10 September, </p>
<p>Mr Blair set out the rationale for tackling the problem of Iraq – “why I say Saddam is a </p>
<p>threat that has to be dealt with”.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated that “when the weapons inspectors were evicted from Iraq in 1998 there </p>
<p>were still enough chemical and biological weapons remaining to devastate the entire </p>
<p>Gulf region”. He also stated that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear programme, which </p>
<p>he had denied and which had been “disrupted” by inspections. He was in breach of </p>
<p>“23 outstanding UN obligations requiring him to admit inspectors and disarm”.</p>
<p><b>361.  The Assessments Staff reported that No.10 was understood to want the </b></p>
<p><b>dossier to be as strong as possible within the available intelligence, subject </b></p>
<p><b>to it being owned by the Joint Intelligence Committee. </b></p>
<p><b>362. </b> On 11 September,<b> </b>Mr Blair wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and </p>
<p>to the Lord Chancellor, asking for Parliament to be recalled in the week beginning </p>
<p>23 September (see Section 3.4).</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“By then, important discussions at the UN will have taken place. And the </p>
<p>Government will be in a position to publish the dossier on what we know of the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime and its WMD programme.”</p>

<p><b>363. </b> An email from an official in the Assessments Staff at 1pm on 11 September stated: </p>
<p>“We have now received comments back from No.10 … Unsurprisingly they have </p>
<p>further questions and areas they would like expanded.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>364. </b> The official wrote that the “main comments” from No.10 were:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“1. They liked the use of a specific personality … in the paras on CW. Can we add </p>
<p>any more personalities, related to BW, nuclear, BM [ballistic missiles], who are doing </p>
<p>jobs now that are suspiciuos [sic] because of their previous role …</p>
<p>“2. Is there any intelligence that Iraq has actively sought to employ foreign experts, </p>
<p>in particular in the nuclear field?</p>
<p>“3. They want more details on the items procured for their nuclear programme – how </p>
<p>many did they buy, what does this equate to in terms of significance to a nuclear </p>
<p>programme?</p>
<p>“4. Can we say how many chemical and biological weapons Iraq currently has </p>
<p>by type! If we cant give weapons numbers can we give any idea on the quantity </p>
<p>of agent available!</p>
<p>“I appreciate everyone, us included, has been around at least some of these buoys </p>
<p>before, particularly item 4.” </p>
<p><b>365. </b> The official concluded:</p>
<p>“But No.10 through the Chairman want the document to be as strong as possible </p>
<p>within the bounds of avaialable [sic] intelligence. This is therefore a last (!) call for </p>
<p>any items of intelligence that agencies think can and should be included.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> In a postscript, the official added:</p>
<p>“[…] we have already discussed the continuing need to say something about Iraq’s </p>
<p>capability to make INDs [Improvised Nuclear Devices] (as per March JIC paper).”</p>
<p><b>367. </b> The email was not specific about who in No.10 was being quoted or how the </p>
<p>message was conveyed.</p>
<p><b>368.  A series of internal emails within No.10 on 10 and 11 September, some </b></p>

<p>184</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Pruce commented on 10 September that he thought the dossier should focus </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein as much as possible and use personal witness statements about </p>
<p>Saddam’s abuses and quotations from Saddam’s speeches. He added:</p>
<p>“In the public’s mind the key difference between this text and the IISS text will be the </p>
<p>access to intelligence material I like the idea of a history of JIC Assessments Might </p>
<p>we also include a general statement on the nature of the intelligence services and </p>
<p>their role …”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>370. </b> On 11 September, Mr Pruce wrote:</p>
<p>“Who will issue the text? Us? The Cabinet Office? Why don’t we issue it in the name </p>
<p>of the JIC? Makes it more interesting to the media.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Mr Pruce suggested that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The draft should be personalised onto Saddam “as much as possible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The aim should be to “convey the impression that … over the past decade he </p>
<p>[Saddam Hussein] has been aggressively and relentlessly pursuing WMD while </p>
<p>brutally repressing his own people”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Wherever there was a reference to weapons, there should be a description </p>
<p>of their destructive capacity.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr Pruce commented that the section on intelligence would be:</p>
<p>“… the one that readers will go to first. This draft already plays up the nature of </p>
<p>intelligence sourcing. I think we could play this up more The more we advertise that </p>
<p>unsupported assertions (eg Saddam attaches great importance to the possession </p>
<p>of WMD) come from intelligence the better The history of JIC Assessments will </p>
<p>help too …”</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Pruce’s comments on the Foreword are set out later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Mr Philip Bassett, a Special Adviser in No.10, commented:</p>
<p>“Very long way to go I think … we’re in a lot of trouble with this as it stands now”.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Mr Tom Kelly, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman, wrote that the draft had </p>
<p>“one central weakness”, it did “not differentiate enough between capacity and intent”:</p>
<p>“We know he is trying to get WMD – and this shows those attempts are intensifying </p>
<p>But can we show why we think he intends to use them aggressively, rather than in </p>

<p>We also … need more direct argument on why containment is breaking down </p>
<p>In other words, putting the emphasis as much (maybe more) on the present and </p>

<p>“The key must be to show that Saddam has the capacity, and is intent on using it </p>

<p>threatened.”</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Mr Rycroft responded:</p>
<p>“yes, part of the answer to ‘why now?’ is that the threat will only get worse if we </p>
<p>don’t act now – the threat that Saddam will use WMD, but also the threat that Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD will somehow get into the hands of the terrorists […] This all links into the illicit </p>
<p>money, since the more funds he has – and his cash pile is growing all the time – the </p>
<p>more likely he is to buy fissile material etc”.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Godric Smith, the Prime Minister’s Official Spokesman, wrote:</p>
<p>“I think there is material here we can work with but it is a bit of a muddle and needs </p>
<p>a lot more clarity in the guts of it in terms of what is new/old In each area we need </p>

<p>Mr Scarlett: “The drier the better, cut the rhetoric”; and that “the more intelligence </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>THE US PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The discussions with the US about President Bush’s speech to the UN General </p>
<p>Assembly on 12 September are addressed in Section 3.4. Key points from the speech </p>
<p>are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>President Bush’s speech, 12 September 2002</b></p>
<p>In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 12 September, President Bush set out his </p>
<p>view of the “grave and gathering danger” posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged the </p>
<p>UN to act to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security Council </p>
<p>since 1990.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p>President Bush made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN the world must hold Iraq to account </p>
<p>and the US would “work with the UN Security Council for the necessary resolutions”.</p>
<p>But the US would not stand by and do nothing in the face of the threat.</p>
<p>President Bush set out Iraq’s failure to meet those obligations imposed by the UN, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the </p>
<p>production of biological weapons.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN inspections had revealed that Iraq “likely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard </p>
<p>and other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding </p>
<p>facilities capable of producing chemical weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continued “to withhold important information about its nuclear program”; </p>
<p>employed “capable nuclear scientists and technicians”; and retained “the physical </p>
<p>infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon”. It had “made several attempts to </p>
<p>buy high-strength aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon”. </p>
<p>If Iraq acquired fissile material, “it would be able to build a nuclear weapon within </p>
<p>a year”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “state controlled media” had “reported numerous meetings between </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his </p>
<p>continued appetite for these weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq also possessed “a force” of SCUD-type missiles with greater than permitted </p>
<p>range and was “building more … that can inflict mass death throughout the </p>
<p>region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “subverted” the Oil-for-Food programme “to buy missile technology and </p>
<p>military materials”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite the UN’s demands for the return of inspectors, Iraq had had “four years … </p>
<p>to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy”. </p>
<p>Challenging the UN to act, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when </p>
<p>inspectors were in his country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left? </p>
<p>The history, the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein’s regime </p>
<p>194 </p>
<p>The White House, 12 September 2002, <i>President’s Remarks to the United Nations General Assembly.</i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>is a grave and gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against the </p>
<p>evidence. To assume … good faith is … a reckless gamble … [T]his is a risk we must </p>
<p>not take. </p>
<p>“We have been more than patient … Saddam Hussein has defied all these efforts </p>
<p>and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be </p>
<p>completely certain he has … nuclear weapons is when … he uses one. We owe it to </p>
<p>all our citizens to prevent that day from coming.”</p>
<p><b>397.  Mr Scarlett discussed the draft dossier with US Administration officials </b></p>
<p><b>on 12 September.</b></p>
<p><b>398. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, reported that, in meetings </p>
<p>on 12 September, US Administration officials had welcomed Mr Scarlett’s briefing on the </p>
<p>UK plan to publish a dossier on Iraqi WMD on 24 September.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Scarlett had “stressed the importance of co-ordinating UK and US public </p>
<p>presentation strategies”. The issues discussed included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recent Iraqi attempts to procure aluminium tubes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the differences between US and UK assessments of the timelines for Iraq to </p>
<p>acquire a nuclear weapons capability. President Bush had said publicly, notably </p>
<p>in his speech to the UN General Assembly, that, if it obtained fissile material, </p>
<p>Iraq could build a nuclear weapon within a year.</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer also wrote:</p>
<p>“US interlocutors all pointed more generally to the need not to get trapped into </p>
<p>juridical standards of proof. The bulk of the case should rest on history and </p>
<p>common-sense argument, rather than specific new intelligence. When it came to </p>
<p>Saddam’s WMD, absence of evidence was not the same as evidence of absence. </p>
<p>We should not be afraid to argue that, just as in 1991, Iraq’s programmes were </p>
<p>probably much further advanced than we knew.”</p>
<p><b>401. </b> One official in the National Security Council suggested:</p>
<p>“… setting out convincing arguments as to why Saddam continued his costly pursuit </p>
<p>of WMD. Deterring attacks on the regime was not a full explanation. For Saddam, </p>
<p>WMD were weapons of choice, not of last resort. In particular … [he] believed, </p>
<p>Saddam wanted nuclear weapons so that he could threaten or use CW or BW in the </p>
<p>region, and use his nuclear capability to deter nuclear retaliation … we should not be </p>
<p>afraid to make this argument publicly.”</p>

<p>Intelligence Agency (CIA) and they made comments.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>SIS report, 11 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>403.  On 11 September, SIS issued a report stating:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq had accelerated the production of chemical and biological agent; </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>it had built further facilities throughout Iraq; and </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein was determined to maintain his CBW capability.</b></p>
<p><b>404.  SIS expected to receive additional material through the same source. </b></p>
<p><b>405.  Reflecting concerns about source protection, the report was given a very </b></p>
<p><b>limited distribution to named senior officials.</b></p>
<p><b>406.  The report did not make clear that SIS was not itself in contact with the </b></p>
<p><b>source whom it considered had direct access to Iraq’s programmes. </b></p>
<p><b>407. </b> The Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>“One further intelligence report which has been described to us as being significant </p>
<p>was received between the production of the JIC’s Assessment of 9 September and </p>
<p>the publication of the Government’s dossier. This … reported that production of </p>
<p>biological and chemical agent had been accelerated by the Iraqi regime, including </p>
<p>through the building of further facilities throughout Iraq.”</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Notes of a telephone discussion between Sir Richard Dearlove and Mr Scarlett </p>
<p>on 11 September recorded that Sir Richard told Mr Scarlett:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS was “on the edge of [a] significant intel breakthrough”. The intelligence </p>
<p>was from a “first contact with BCW phenomenal access”. It could be the “key </p>
<p>to unlock” Iraq’s BCW programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asked whether the source definitely had “the access”, Sir Richard replied “yes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Richard expected “additional material in 3-4 weeks time”. He mentioned </p>
<p>a “CD with everything in it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Richard believed that it would be too risky to include the material from the </p>
<p>new source [in the dossier]: “The moment we publish Saddam will lock up his </p>
<p>BCW scientists.”</p>

<p>Mr Scarlett agreed that the report would not be fed into “today’s discussion [of </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>412. </b> The report stated that, in early September, a senior official who had a background </p>
<p>of involvement in Iraq’s CW programme described a particular military establishment’s </p>
<p>participation in BW and CW programmes, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The regime had demanded accelerated production of BCW substances. Senior </p>
<p>workers were working a seven day week and safety measures, which were </p>
<p>common in the 1980s, were now being ignored …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Although BW and CW production is centred on Baghdad, the regime has built </p>
<p>further facilities throughout Iraq. There was now excess capacity, with more </p>
<p>production facilities than there were suitably qualified and trusted staff to operate </p>
<p>them.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chlorine gas produced at the facility was “shipped to ‘Iraq Atomic Energy’”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [A]nthrax was being produced at a separate facility …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Approximately two weeks ago, an order was received to stop producing </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>413. </b> The report stated that the SIS source had commented that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam Hussein was determined to maintain his CBW capability. If the major </p>
<p>production centres near Baghdad were attacked and damaged, the regime </p>
<p>would order staff to relocate to an alternative undamaged site.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “was concentrating its efforts on the production of anthrax and that Iraq had </p>
<p>received a lot of help from neighbouring and friendly countries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The action was “in preparation for the admission of weapons inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“New accommodation for senior scientists and their colleagues was being built </p>
<p>near to the major BW and CW production sites. The families of those scientists </p>
<p>would, in effect, be held hostage. They would be discouraged from deserting or </p>
<p>from leaking information about activities at their facilities that might lead to the </p>
<p>sites being targeted for bombing by allied forces.”</p>
<p><b>414. </b> An SIS comment informed readers that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chlorine was “one of the base chemicals for the production of CW agents such </p>
<p>as mustard and the nerve agent sarin”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chlorine was also used in the production of uranium trichloride “which in turn </p>
<p>may be used as a feed material for the electromagnetic isotope separation </p>
<p>process (EMIS) to enrich uranium for weapons production”. Iraq had previously </p>
<p>admitted, in its declarations to UNSCOM, “attempting to pursue this route to </p>
<p>produce weapon grade highly enriched uranium” before 1991; and, “Although </p>
<p>Iraq encountered problems in scaling up the production capability, it had </p>
<p>succeeded in producing a small quantity of lower enrichments and was </p>
<p>continuing to resolve the problems before the EMIS programme was halted </p>
<p>by Coalition air strikes.”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> The report was described as “high impact” and the source was described as: </p>
<p>“A new source on trial with direct access.” SIS advised that readers would “receive </p>

<p>“Meeting with TB, Jonathan, DM, AC, C and a SIS colleague re chemical and </p>

<p>It showed what was going on was really bad and getting worse, that he [Saddam </p>

<p><b>429. </b> Asked whether, as some witnesses had suggested, he had been precipitate </p>
<p>in going to Ministers with the report so quickly, Sir Richard replied:</p>
<p>“I think in the circumstances, I don’t agree … because if you issue a report like that </p>
<p>in the middle of a crisis, you’re going to get a phone call from a Ministerial office </p>
<p>within a short period of time.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Sir Richard also stated that in the circumstances it would have been “impossible” </p>
<p>not to issue the report; SIS could not “sit on something as potentially important” </p>
<p>as that.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>431.  The SIS report of 11 September was used by Mr Scarlett and Mr Miller </b></p>
<p><b>in reaching key judgements about Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities included in the Government dossier published on 24 September.</b></p>
<p><b>432.  Specifically it provided the assurance for the judgements that Iraq had:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”; </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>“military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons …”</b></p>
<p><b>433.  The judgements on Iraq’s production of chemical and biological weapons </b></p>
<p><b>and the circumstances in which they could be used became the baseline for </b></p>
<p><b>subsequent advice to Ministers and public statements on the threat posed by Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>434. </b> The Butler Report concluded that the intelligence report (of 11 September) had “a </p>
<p>major effect on the certainty of the statements in the Government’s dossier of September </p>
<p>2002 that Iraq possessed and was producing chemical and biological weapons”.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>435. </b> The Butler Report added that the SIS report had provided “significant assurance </p>

<p><b>436. </b> In the context of Sir Richard Dearlove’s evidence, that he had told Mr Blair on </p>
<p>12 September 2002 that the SIS report issued on 11 September was developmental and </p>
<p>the source unproven, the Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, it may be that, in the context of the intense interest at that moment </p>
<p>in the status of Iraq’s prohibited weapons programmes, and in particular continuing </p>
<p>work on the dossier, the concurrence of events caused more weight to be given to </p>
<p>this unvalidated new source than would normally have been the case.”</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>437. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Richard Dearlove maintained that material from </p>
<p>the report of 11 September had not been used in the dossier:</p>
<p>“… maybe I should add now, because I’m sure you are going to question me … </p>
<p>I think this is an important point, so we don’t waste too much time on it. I can say </p>
<p>very authoritatively there was no material in the dossier [from the new source on trial </p>
<p>in September 2002]. </p>
<p>“I can also say, if you actually look at the introduction to the dossier, it refers to </p>
<p>assessed intelligence, specifically assessed intelligence. [The new source on trial] </p>
<p>was not assessed intelligence, and therefore are actually authoritatively excluded </p>
<p>because they don’t fall into that category, and I had put my foot down and said this </p>
<p>material could not be used.”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Sir Richard subsequently told the Inquiry that he had insisted that the September </p>
<p>reporting was not included in the dossier because he wanted to retain the source for use </p>
<p>during inspections.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the “further intelligence” reporting on the </p>
<p>“acceleration” of the “production of chemical and biological agent” was “regarded as </p>
<p>significant”.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Sir John subsequently stated that the report issued on 11 September was </p>
<p>“influential” and “did famously influence what was said in the dossier”.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> He also referred </p>
<p>to a further report from the same source in late September and that “a composite </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>SIS report, 23 September 2002 </b></p>
<p>On 23 September, SIS issued a second report from the same sourcing chain as the </p>
<p>11 September report. That stated VX, sarin and soman had been produced at Al-Yarmuk, </p>
<p>and were loaded into a variety of “containers”, including “linked hollow glass spheres”. </p>
<p>The source commented that there had been “accelerated production of CW substances </p>
<p>at Al-Yarmuk for several years”. It was described by SIS as expanding and clarifying the </p>
<p>intelligence in the first report, and that it was “valuable intelligence”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>The report was circulated to the same restricted group as the report on 11 September, </p>
<p>with the addition of Mr Mark Bowman, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary.</p>
<p>It arrived too late to have influenced the conclusions in the dossier.</p>
<p><b>442. </b> When the reporting was reissued in April 2003 Mr Scarlett was not informed </p>
<p>that SIS had doubts about the reliability of the reporting chain. That is addressed </p>
<p>in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>443. </b> The potential impact of the reporting on Mr Blair’s statement to the House </p>
<p>of Commons on 24 September is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>Mr Straw’s speech, 14 September 2002 </b></p>
<p>Mr Straw’s speech to the UN General Assembly on 14 September focused on the critical </p>
<p>role the UN had to play in world affairs, and the “three rising challenges” of failing states, </p>
<p>terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Addressing the threat from proliferation, Mr Straw stated: “Nowhere is the case for </p>
<p>universal support for the enforcement of the UN’s law stronger than in the field of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction.” He added:</p>
<p>“… with one infamous exception – no States have resorted to these, the world’s worst </p>
<p>weapons. </p>
<p>“That exception is Iraq. For two decades, Saddam has defied and frustrated </p>
<p>every attempt to enforce the international rule of law. Iraq is the only country to </p>
<p>be condemned by the United Nations for breaching the Convention on Chemical </p>
<p>Weapons. Iraq has fought two wars of aggression … No country has deceived every </p>
<p>other country in the world as systematically and cynically as Iraq. And no country </p>
<p>presents as fundamental a challenge to the United Nations …”</p>

<p><b>Draft dossier, 16 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>444. </b> In a note to No.10 officials covering a range of issues on 15 September, Mr Blair </p>
<p>wrote on Iraq:</p>
<p>“The dossier is crucial. The expectations must be right. Remember the case </p>
<p>we need to make is for the return of a tough inspection regime, not that he </p>
<p>[Saddam Hussein] is about to launch a strike. In my view, advice to me from </p>
<p>the JIC is sufficiently persuasive.”</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The purpose of the dossier was to respond to the call to disclose the intelligence </p>
<p>we knew but at that stage the strategy was not to use the dossier as the immediate </p>
<p>reason to go to conflict, but as the reason why we had to return to the issue of </p>
<p>Saddam and weapons of mass destruction …”</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>446.  There were a number of significant changes in the revised draft of </b></p>
<p><b>the dossier of 16 September, including giving prominence in the Executive </b></p>
<p><b>Summary to:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the IISS judgement that Iraq could obtain a nuclear weapon within months </b></p>
<p><b>if it obtained fissile material, rather than the JIC’s more conservative view </b></p>
<p><b>of one to two years which was not mentioned in the Summary;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein’s readiness to use weapons of mass destruction and his </b></p>
<p><b>determination to retain them; and </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>a statement that the JIC judged that Iraq continued to produce chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological agents. </b></p>
<p><b>447. </b> Mr Scarlett sent a revised version of the dossier to JIC members on 16 September, </p>
<p>which put the description of Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes first.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>448. </b> The draft did not contain a draft Foreword; the development of the text signed </p>
<p>by Mr Blair is discussed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>449. </b> The key additions to the Executive Summary from the previous draft were </p>
<p>references to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “valuable assessment” in the IISS paper of 9 September, including that it </p>
<p>judged “Iraq could assemble nuclear weapons within months of obtaining fissile </p>
<p>material from foreign sources”;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence providing a “fuller picture of Iraq’s plans and capabilities” and </p>
<p>showing that Saddam Hussein did “not regard them only as weapons of last </p>
<p>resort”; he was “ready to use them … and determined to retain them”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence allowing the JIC to judge that Iraq had “continued to produce </p>
<p>chemical and biological agents”; and that Saddam Hussein and his son Qusay </p>
<p>had “the political authority to use” WMD. </p>
<p><b>450. </b> The draft included a new Chapter 1 on the role of intelligence, which stated:</p>
<p>“Intelligence rarely offers a complete account of activities which are designed to </p>
<p>remain concealed. And the nature of Saddam’s regime makes Iraq a difficult target </p>
<p>… Nonetheless, we have been able to develop a range of well positioned sources. </p>
<p>The need to protect and preserve these sources inevitably limits the detail that </p>
<p>can be made available. But intelligence has provided important insights into Iraqi </p>
<p>programmes, and into Iraqi military thinking. Taken together with what is already </p>
<p>known from other sources, this builds our understanding of Iraq’s capabilities and </p>
<p>adds significantly to the analysis already in the public domain.</p>
<p>“Iraq’s capabilities have been regularly reviewed by the … JIC, which has provided </p>
<p>advice to the Prime Minister on the developing assessment on the basis of all </p>
<p>available sources … [T]his paper includes some of the most significant views </p>
<p>reached by the JIC between 1999 and 2002.”</p>
<p><b>451. </b> The text on Iraq’s programmes was significantly expanded. As well as more detail </p>
<p>on Iraq’s attempts to procure material that could be used for prohibited programmes, </p>
<p>and judgements from JIC Assessments, changes to the previous text included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a box describing the effect of detonating a 20-kiloton nuclear warhead over </p>
<p>a city;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the addition of statements that: there had been “recent production of chemical </p>
<p>and biological agents”; intelligence confirmed that Iraq continued to produce </p>
<p>chemical agents; and “we know from intelligence that Iraq has continued to </p>
<p>produce biological warfare agents”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a statement that intelligence had provided “<b>Confirmation</b>” that chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons played an important role in Iraqi military thinking; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>two separate statements that the Iraqi military “may be able to deploy” chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons within 45 minutes of a decision to do so; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the replacing of the judgement that, if Iraq obtained fissile material, it would take </p>
<p>at least two years to make a working nuclear device, by a statement that it would </p>
<p>be “much shorter” than the five years Iraq would require to produce a nuclear </p>
<p>weapon once sanctions were lifted or became ineffective, and, “depending </p>
<p>on the effectiveness of Iraqi weapons design”, that could be “between one and </p>
<p>two years”; and</p>

<p>the replacing of the reference to an ability to produce an unreliable IND within </p>
<p>a few months, by a reference to Iraqi experimentation with radiological dispersal </p>
<p>devices (RDDs) during 1987, but the programme “never progressed beyond </p>
<p>the research stage and was dropped”. A box described such devices as an </p>
<p>“ineffective weapon”.</p>
<p><b>452. </b> The draft also contained a new “Conclusion” summarising the current position. </p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr Scarlett asked that the “representatives” of JIC members attending a meeting </p>
<p>to be chaired by Mr Miller at 0900 the following morning, should “come armed with </p>
<p>suggested additions/ deletions/amendments to be decided at the meeting”.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> He also </p>
<p>asked for “final comments” by 1300 on 17 September.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Scarlett cautioned:</p>
<p>“In public presentation terms, this draft remains a highly sensitive document. I would </p>
<p>therefore be grateful if you each retain very tight control over its distribution …” </p>

<p>“like me, was worried about the way you have expressed the nuclear issue </p>

<p><b>466. </b> Mr Campbell’s own comments included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we should make more of the point about current concealment plans.”</p>

<p>or presented</p>
<p>“First the document does nothing to demonstrate a threat, let alone an imminent </p>
<p>threat from Saddam In other words it shows he has the means but it does not </p>
<p>demonstrate he has the motive to attack his neighbours let alone the west We will </p>
<p>need to make clear in launching the document that we do not claim to have evidence </p>
<p>that he is an imminent threat The case we are making is that he has continued to </p>
<p>develop WMD since 1998, and is in breach of UN resolutions The international </p>
<p>community has to enforce those resolutions if the UN is to be taken seriously</p>
<p>“Second we will be asked about connections with Al Qaida […]</p>
<p>“Third, if I was Saddam I would take a party of western journalists to the Ibn Sina </p>
<p>factory or one of the others pictured in the document to demonstrate there is nothing </p>
<p>there How do we close off that avenue to him in advance?”</p>
<p>231</p>
<p><b>470. </b> In his response Mr Scarlett stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A note was being prepared on Iraq and Al Qaida.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier stressed the problems [in identifying prohibited activities], posed </p>
<p>by dual-use facilities and the ease of concealment. That “applied to trained </p>
<p>inspectors let alone journalists”.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Mr Campbell commented:</p>
<p>“I think we risk complicating the issue if we get into links with Al Qaida The dossier, </p>
<p>and the debate in Parliament, are explicitly about Iraq/WMD On the question of </p>
<p>sites, we should in our briefing make clear that we assume he will sanitise one </p>
<p>of them for the media, and pull some stunt, but remain robust re our judgements </p>
<p>Re the ‘imminent threat’, point, that is why TB’s foreword sets out ‘the case I am </p>
<p>making’. John, I will show him your revisions and hopefully get the Foreword signed </p>
<p>off today”.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>472. </b> In a further email on 18 September, Mr Powell emphasised that he was “not </p>

<p>to need to mould expectations in advance of publication and on publication”.</p>

<p>235</p>
<p> Mr Campbell wrote that </p>
<p>“Overall, she found it convincing”, “CW/BW in particular”. She had, however, found </p>
<p>the nuclear section confused and unconvincing, and it had left her thinking that there </p>
<p>was “nothing much to worry about”. The section “lacked the clarity of the rest of the </p>
<p>document”.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr Campbell added:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that at the JIC on 18 September:</p>
<p>“The Committee also noted that some new intelligence had come in on nuclear </p>
<p>matters which would need to be incorporated in the draft.</p>
<p>“The Committee raised no particular point – no points of further debate or </p>
<p>contention.”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>483. </b> On 18 September, Mr Scarlett sent Mr Campbell detailed responses to his and </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s comments.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>484. </b> The response to Mr Blair’s comments included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The revised restructuring suggested by Mr Blair would have “less impact than </p>
<p>the original”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett had explained “the decision to drop earlier references to an </p>
<p>improvised nuclear device, on which there is no intelligence”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No change had been made to the timelines for Iraq to acquire a nuclear weapon </p>
<p>which summarised the JIC position, but one paragraph had been revised to </p>
<p>bring out the judgements more clearly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dual-use products had been listed separately; and the impact was “much </p>
<p>improved”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Material on human rights abuses had been added and the issue was given </p>
<p>“a little more prominence” in the Executive Summary. </p>
<p><b>485. </b> Mr Scarlett also addressed Mr Campbell’s more detailed comments, including that </p>
<p>the language on current concerns and plans had been strengthened and the Summary </p>
<p>brought out the point suggested by Mr Campbell – that Iraq was making progress </p>
<p>despite sanctions and containment.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Addressing comments in Mr Campbell’s minute of 17 September, Mr Scarlett told </p>
<p>the Hutton Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we looked again at what we were saying in the draft about Iraq’s concealment </p>
<p>plans and activities – what the intelligence was saying, and also how we were </p>
<p>expressing the success or otherwise of sanctions and the policy of containment.</p>
<p>“This, of course, was a point that we had been expressly asked to highlight by the </p>
<p>JIC at its meeting of 11 September.</p>
<p>“… [I]ntelligence … was very clear about Iraq’s confidence that it could learn </p>
<p>lessons from its past experience with the inspectors, and pursue effective </p>
<p>concealment plans.”</p>

<p><b>487. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell recorded that, on 18 September, he also:</p>
<p>“… went through nuclear section with Julian Miller, which was OK. JS [Jack Straw] </p>
<p>was keen to keep in the very downbeat assessment.”</p>
<p>242</p>
<p><b>488. </b> In an email on 19 September, Mr Campbell recorded that he told Mr Miller:</p>
<p>“… it would be simpler to have just one clearer section on nuclear timelines, perhaps </p>
<p>along the following lines …</p>
<p>“It is impossible to be precise about nuclear timelines We can be clear however, </p>
<p>that provided sanctions and export controls remain in place and effective, it is </p>
<p>not possible for Iraq to develop nuclear weapons. This is because although they </p>
<p>have the expertise, the design data, the planning and the intent they do not have </p>
<p>the material necessary for the production of fissile material. This contrasts with  </p>
<p>CW/BW, which they can produce indigenously. Even if sanctions were removed, </p>
<p>we assess that it would take up to five years for them to develop nuclear </p>
<p>weapons. The timelines are considerably shortened however if Iraq manages </p>
<p>to obtain fissile material illegally from overseas In these circumstances, the JIC </p>
<p>assessed in early 2002 that they could produce nuclear weapons in between </p>
<p>one and two years”.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Mr Scarlett sent the draft dossier to Mr Campbell on 19 September.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>490. </b> The minute was also sent to JIC members “on a personal basis, reflecting the </p>
<p>continuing sensitivity of the document and the imperative need to avoid leaks”. </p>
<p>They were asked to let Mr Scarlett have “any essential further comments on this draft </p>
<p>by 15:00 today”.</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“I should draw your attention to some changes to the Executive Summary reflecting </p>
<p>comments from the Foreign Office; to a simplified account of Saddam’s nuclear </p>
<p>programme; and to a restructuring of the final section on Saddam’s Iraq to bring out </p>
<p>the human rights issues more clearly. In particular you should note that we have </p>
<p>toned down the reference to aluminium tubes … and removed it from the Executive </p>
<p>Summary. This reflects some very recent exchanges on intelligence channels. </p>
<p>Finally, I have recast the conclusion to remove the chart, which a number of readers </p>
<p>considered to lack impact.” </p>

<p>The Assessment of the British Government’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>492. </b> A concluding paragraph in the Executive Summary, stating that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would “use his weapons of mass destruction to protect and eventually project his power”, </p>
<p>reflected a revised Conclusions section at the end of the paper which stated:</p>
<p>“Four themes dominate even the most sober account of Saddam Hussein’s rule </p>
<p>in Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Brutality … against his own people,</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Aggression against neighbour states,</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cynicism in dealing with the Iraqi people, regional states and the </p>
<p>International Community; and, </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Single minded pursuit of military power and above all weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction as the most effective means of exercising that power.</p>
<p>“This paper has set out our assessment of Saddam’s current holdings … as well as </p>
<p>his programmes for their development. Although our knowledge is partial, the paper </p>
<p>concludes that he possesses mass destruction weapons and the means to produce </p>
<p>them and to deliver them. His development programmes continue. An analysis of </p>
<p>what he will do with these weapons now and in the future, must rest upon his record </p>
<p>and our current information, including intelligence. It is reasonable to conclude that </p>
<p>he will use whatever weaponry he has to hand to protect his power and eventually </p>
<p>to project it when he feels strong enough to do so.”</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Other changes included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the firming up of the judgement on the timeline for deploying chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons, from “may be able” to deploy within 45 minutes to “are able”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the addition of a statement that Iraq had learned lessons from its previous </p>
<p>experience with inspections to identify and exploit weak points and that sensitive </p>
<p>equipment and papers were easily concealed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the addition of a statement that the “possession of mobile biological agent </p>
<p>production facilities” would “also aid concealment efforts”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the omission of the box explaining the difficulties of producing a nuclear weapon </p>
<p>and the inclusion of one which described the elements of a nuclear programme </p>
<p>and the process to convert those elements into a reliable weapon. The only </p>
<p>comment on the difficulty was that the complexity was “much greater for a </p>
<p>weapon that can fit into a missile warhead than for a larger Nagasaki-type </p>
<p>[free fall] bomb”.</p>
<p><b>494. </b> In an email to Mr Scarlett, Mr Campbell commented that he did not think the </p>
<p>revised Conclusion worked and that he would “either revert to, and strengthen” the </p>
<p>previous format (a box summarising key points), or drop the section.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> Mr Campbell </p>
<p>also wrote that the Foreword covered most of the points made in the Conclusion.</p>

<p>207</p>
<p><b>495. </b> In an email to Mr Campbell and Mr Scarlett on the afternoon of 19 September, </p>
<p>Mr Powell wrote that he agreed with Mr Campbell that the Conclusion should </p>
<p>be dropped.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>496. </b> Mr Powell also:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asked what headline “we want” in the <i>Standard</i> on the day of publication; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pointed out that the statement that Saddam Hussein was “prepared to use </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons if he believes his regime is under threat is a </p>
<p>bit of a problem”, because it backed up the argument that there was “no CBW </p>
<p>threat and we will only create one if we attack him”. </p>
<p><b>497. </b> Mr Powell added:</p>
<p>“My memory of the intelligence is that he has set up plans to use CBW on western </p>
<p>forces and that these weapons are integrated into his military planning.”</p>
<p><b>498. </b> In further comments later on 19 September, Mr Campbell raised three further </p>
<p>points in relation to nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>499. </b> In relation to the time required to produce a nuclear weapon, the draft text </p>
<p>on nuclear timelines (paragraph 23) stated:</p>
<p>“In early 2002, the JIC assessed that UN sanctions on Iraq were hindering the import </p>
<p>of crucial goods for the production of fissile material. The JIC judged that while </p>
<p>sanctions remain effective, Iraq would not be able indigenously to produce a nuclear </p>
<p>weapon. If they were removed or proved ineffective, it would take Iraq at least five </p>
<p>years to produce a weapon. But we know that Iraq retains expertise and design data </p>
<p>relating to nuclear weapons. We therefore judge that if Iraq obtained fissile material </p>
<p>and other essential components from foreign sources, the timeline for production </p>
<p>of a nuclear weapon would be shortened and Iraq could produce a nuclear weapon </p>
<p>in between one and two years.”</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>500. </b> Apologising for not having spotted the point earlier, Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“If we are saying that it would take between one and 2 years for them to build a </p>
<p>nuclear weapon by illegal means, why would it take 5 years with no sanctions? A lay </p>
<p>reader may assume that no sanctions would mean he could do what he wanted and </p>
<p>therefore, presumably, what he needed between 1 and 2 years</p>
<p>“If the answer is that it would take 5 years to go from planning to reality, whereas he </p>
<p>could purchase ready-made material from overseas, and so cut the timelines, I think </p>
<p>that should be made explicitly clear”.</p>

<p>208</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Secondly, Mr Campbell commented that the draft text on radiological dispersal </p>
<p>devices added little. </p>
<p><b>502. </b> Finally, Mr Campbell suggested that the text of the draft relating to attempts </p>
<p>to purchase two different machines which “could be used” in a gas centrifuge uranium </p>
<p>enrichment process (paragraph 21, fourth and fifth bullets), might be amended to read </p>
<p>“is required to”.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p><b>503. </b> In his diaries on 19 September, Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“Most of my work at the moment was on the dossier. Nuclear timelines just about </p>
<p>sorted … I agreed to drop the conclusion. Some people reasonably convinced, </p>
<p>others not. We’d end up convincing those who wanted to be and not those </p>
<p>who didn’t.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>252</p>
<p><b>508. </b> Mr Sedwill wrote that the Foreword needed to make Saddam Hussein’s defiance </p>

<p>“… to refer to the UN in the first sentences. This is after all, about the authority </p>
<p>of the UN and international law. This is the only way we can win the argument </p>
<p>in Parliament and elsewhere …”</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Mr Straw suggested that the Foreword for the dossier “should be in a narrative </p>
<p>form” by Mr Blair, and that it needed “a killer” paragraph on “Saddam’s defiance of the </p>
<p>UN, only annexation of another member state and unprecedented use of WMD”.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Writing before the decision had been taken that Mr Blair would sign the Foreword </p>
<p>or the text had been drafted, Mr Bowen wrote:</p>
<p>“I take it as read that the Foreword is a political piece, signed by the Prime Minister </p>
<p>or another Minister. In that text it would be useful to make the point that what follows </p>
<p>is the work of officials drawing on sensitive intelligence material. The Foreword </p>
<p>can be as loaded as we like in terms of the political message (provided it is </p>

<p>“I and other Ministers have been briefed in detail on the sources, and are satisfied </p>

<p>“What I believe they established beyond doubt is that Saddam has continued to </p>
<p>produce chemical and biological weapons that he continues in his efforts to develop </p>
<p>nuclear weapons, and to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme.</p>
<p>“This picture … has become more not less worrying. Faced with the picture put </p>

<p><b>517. </b> Mr Powell offered three comments on the Foreword:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“I think it is worth explicitly stating, as TB keeps saying, this is the advice to </p>
<p>him from the JIC. On the basis of this advice what other action could he as </p>
<p>PM take. Something like ‘I am today taking the exceptional step of publishing </p>
<p>the JIC’s advice to me because I want MPs and the British public to see the </p>
<p>advice on which I am acting. When you have read this I ask you to consider </p>
<p>what else a responsible PM could do than follow the course we have in the </p>
<p>face of the advice?’”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We need to do more to back up the assertions. We cannot of course publish </p>
<p>the detailed raw intelligence on which this report is based without endangering </p>
<p>the lives of agents. But all the statements in this report are backed up by detailed </p>
<p>intelligence reports, the veracity and sources of which have been verified by </p>
<p>the intelligence agencies. Is there any independent verification we can cite?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the penultimate para you need to make it clear Saddam could not attack </p>
<p>us at the moment. The thesis is he would be a threat to the UK in the future </p>
<p>if we do not check him.”</p>

<p><b>520. </b> The draft Foreword was sent to Mr Scarlett by Mr Campbell’s office.</p>

<p><b>521. </b> The original version of the final paragraph had been amended to read:</p>
<p>“I believe that faced with the information given to me by the JIC in recent months, </p>
<p>the UK Government has been right to support the demands that this issue be </p>
<p>confronted and dealt with. We must ensure that he does not get to use the weapons </p>
<p>he has, or get hold of the weapons he wants.”</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Mr Scarlett sent suggested changes to the draft Foreword to Mr Campbell </p>

<p>The first sentence was revised to state: “The document published today is </p>
<p>based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), which </p>
<p>is chaired by the Cabinet Office …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The second sentence of the second paragraph was revised to make clear that </p>
<p>it was the Government, not the JIC, which was publishing the document.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fifth sentence of the fourth paragraph was amended to remove the reference </p>
<p>to Mr Blair and Ministers having been briefed on the sources of intelligence </p>
<p>and having been satisfied as to the authority of their information. It was </p>
<p>amended to state: “I and other Ministers have been briefed in detail on the </p>
<p>intelligence and are satisfied as to its authority.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A new final sentence was added to the fifth paragraph stating: “I also believe </p>
<p>that, as stated in the document, Saddam will now do his utmost to try to conceal </p>
<p>his weapons from the UN inspectors.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A new final sentence was added to the eighth paragraph stating: “I am quite </p>
<p>clear that he will go to extreme lengths, indeed has already done so, to avoid </p>
<p>giving them up.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reference to information from the JIC “in recent months”, in the first </p>
<p>sentence of the final paragraph, was replaced by the words “over the past </p>
<p>three years”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>538. </b> In a letter to Mr Tam Dalyell on 16 July 2003, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“I have always made it clear that the Foreword was signed by me and was separate </p>
<p>to the Executive Summary and the body of the text of the … dossier …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The Foreword was put to the Chairman of the JIC who confirmed at the time that </p>
<p>there was nothing which conflicted with the contents of the dossier.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>539. </b> Asked whether he had drafted the Foreword, Mr Campbell told the ISC that </p>
<p>normally he, “Jonathan Powell and others would have ideas and we’d probably have a </p>
<p>discussion with the Prime Minister”.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> In relation to the Foreword in the dossier, Mr Blair </p>
<p>had been “very ‘hands on’ in terms of what was produced and what was sent … to </p>
<p>John Scarlett”. </p>
<p><b>540. </b> Mr Scarlett told the ISC that he had checked and amended the draft Foreword “for </p>
<p>factual accuracy and consistency with the text”, but he regarded it “as a policy statement </p>
<p>by the Prime Minister”.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>541. </b> Mr Campbell told the Hutton Inquiry that he had “prepared a draft [of the Foreword] </p>
<p>based upon a discussion with the Prime Minister, and with others, about what should go </p>
<p>into that draft”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>542. </b> Asked about how the Foreword had been produced, Mr Blair told the Hutton </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… as I say in my statement … I would have told Alastair Campbell what are the </p>
<p>items I think that are important, specific points that should be in it, on the basis of </p>
<p>the drafts produced … I should say at this point that probably my statement [to </p>
<p>Parliament on 24 September] was the thing I was concentrating most upon.”</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>543. </b> In his subsequent evidence to the Hutton Inquiry, Mr Campbell confirmed </p>
<p>that the Foreword had been drafted on the basis of a discussion with Mr Blair and </p>
<p>Mr Campbell’s colleagues.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… said in terms intelligence can’t give you the whole picture, intelligence </p>
<p>is not necessarily always going to be right, but the intelligence he saw … </p>
<p>and as it was explained to him and as he had repeated discussions and </p>

<p>that he did believe it was established beyond doubt that Saddam had continued </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>removal of the reference to RDDs; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>omission of the phrase “if he believes his regime is under threat”, in relation </p>

<p>biological weapons.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> The text in the published version relating to machines which could be used </p>
<p>in a gas centrifuge process was not changed. </p>
<p><b>550. </b> In response to questioning about his decision to omit the qualifying phrase </p>

<p> </p>
<p>They had been “prompted to look again” at that passage by Mr Powell’s email, of </p>
<p>19 September, in the context of the “instructions from the JIC to keep what we were </p>
<p>writing in line with standing JIC assessments and also with recent intelligence”:</p>
<p>“When we looked at it again, we realised … that there was no standing JIC </p>
<p>assessment which made it clear whether we were defining Saddam’s threat … </p>
<p>or CW posture … as defensive or offensive. More to the point, there was recent </p>
<p>reporting, in addition, which was not reflected here, but which was quite clear </p>
<p>reporting, which placed his attachment to CBW and the importance that he placed </p>
<p>on it very much in the context of his perception of his regional position, his plan to </p>
<p>acquire and maintain regional influence and, as one report, and maybe more, put </p>
<p>it: to dominate his neighbours. In other words, the recent intelligence was more </p>
<p>complex … Bearing those points in mind, we concluded that this was not right and </p>
<p>therefore we took that out.”</p>
<p><b>551. </b> Mr Webb sent Mr Hoon a copy of the draft dossier on 20 September, advising that </p>
<p>it had been “given an extremely restricted circulation (essentially JIC members only)” </p>
<p>and that he had “no discretion to copy this document further”.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> Arrangements were </p>
<p>being made to brief Opposition leaders, Select Committee chairs and junior ministers </p>
<p>on 23 September before the debate on 24 September, and key allies.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Mr Webb told Mr Hoon that AM French’s staff had been “closely associated with </p>
<p>the preparation of the detail of the dossier” and he understood they were “content from </p>
<p>a professional DIS point of view with the judgements” it contained. The paragraphs on </p>
<p>the acquisition of aluminium tubes and nuclear timelines were “more cautious” than </p>
<p>US Department of Defence views and no consultation with the US was planned </p>
<p>“outside intelligence and White House channels”. </p>
<p><b>553. </b> Mr Webb concluded that he had:</p>
<p>“… some reservations as a JIC member about citing the Committee’s views explicitly </p>
<p>(lest we become less usefully direct in our future judgements) but the way this has </p>
<p>been achieved has reassured me.</p>

<p>In the letter, Saddam Hussein declared that Iraq was “totally clear of all nuclear, chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons”; and challenged President Bush’s “insinuation” that Iraq was </p>
<p>linked to the attacks on 9/11 and international terrorism.</p>
<p>Iraq’s position in its letters and statements to the UN, and the UK responses, are </p>
<p>addressed in more detail in Section 3.5.</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s Foreword</b></p>
<p><b>560. </b> In the Foreword to the dossier, Mr Blair emphasised Iraq’s WMD capabilities </p>
<p>and the potential threat they posed.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> The full text of the Foreword is set out in the </p>
<p>Box below. The Inquiry has highlighted in bold text the points it regards as particularly </p>
<p>important in relation to the assessment of Iraq WMD capabilities and intent. </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s Foreword to the 24 September dossier</b></p>
<p>The document published today is based, in large part, on the work of the Joint Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee (JIC). The JIC is at the heart of the British intelligence machinery. It is </p>
<p>chaired by the Cabinet Office and made up of the heads of the UK’s three Intelligence </p>
<p>and Security Agencies, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, and senior officials from key </p>
<p>government departments. For over 60 years the JIC has provided regular assessments </p>
<p>to successive Prime Ministers and senior colleagues on a wide range of foreign policy </p>
<p>and international security issues.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its work, like the material it analyses, is largely secret. It is unprecedented for the </p>
<p>Government to publish this kind of document but <b>in the light of the debate about Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), I wanted to share with the British public </b></p>
<p><b>the reasons why I believe this issue to be a current and serious threat to the UK </b></p>
<p><b>national interest.</b></p>
<p><b>In recent months, I have been increasingly alarmed by the evidence </b>from inside Iraq </p>
<p>that despite sanctions, despite the damage done to his capability in the past, despite </p>
<p>the UN Security Council resolutions expressly outlawing it, and <b>despite his denials, </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein is continuing to develop WMD, and with them the ability to inflict </b></p>
<p><b>real damage on the region, and the stability of the world.</b></p>
<p>Gathering intelligence from inside Iraq is not easy. Saddam’s is one of the most secretive </p>
<p>and dictatorial regimes in the world. So <b>I believe people will understand why the </b></p>
<p><b>Agencies cannot be specific about the sources, which have formed the judgements </b></p>
<p><b>in this document, and why we cannot publish everything we know. </b>We cannot, of </p>
<p>course, publish the detailed raw intelligence. <b>I and other Ministers have been briefed in </b></p>
<p><b>detail on the intelligence and are satisfied as to its authority. </b>I also want to pay tribute </p>
<p>to our Intelligence and Security Services for the often extraordinary work that they do.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he </b></p>
<p><b>continues in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and that he has been able </b></p>
<p><b>to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme. I also believe that, as stated </b></p>
<p><b>in the document, Saddam will now do his utmost to try to conceal his weapons from </b></p>
<p><b>UN inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>The picture presented to me by the JIC in recent months has become more not </b></p>
<p><b>less worrying. It is clear that, despite sanctions, the policy of containment has not </b></p>
<p><b>worked sufficiently well to prevent Saddam from developing these weapons.</b></p>
<p><b>I am in no doubt that the threat is serious and current, that he has made progress </b></p>
<p><b>on WMD, and that he has to be stopped.</b></p>
<p>Saddam has used chemical weapons, not only against an enemy state, but against his </p>
<p>own people. <b>Intelligence reports make clear that he sees the building up of his WMD </b></p>
<p><b>capability, and the belief overseas that he would use these weapons, as vital to </b></p>
<p><b>his strategic interests, and in particular his goal of regional domination. And the </b></p>
<p><b>document discloses that his military planning allows for some of the WMD to be </b></p>
<p><b>ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.</b></p>
<p><b>I am quite clear that Saddam will go to extreme lengths, indeed has already done </b></p>
<p><b>so, to hide these weapons and avoid giving them up.</b></p>
<p>In today’s interdependent world, a major regional conflict does not stay confined to the </p>
<p>region in question. Faced with someone who has shown himself capable of using WMD, </p>
<p>I believe the international community has to stand up for itself and ensure its authority </p>
<p>is upheld.</p>
<p><b>The threat posed to international peace and security, when WMD are in the hands </b></p>
<p><b>of a brutal and aggressive regime like Saddam’s, is real. Unless we face up to the </b></p>
<p><b>threat, not only do we risk undermining the authority of the UN, whose resolutions </b></p>
<p><b>he defies, but more importantly and in the longer term, we place at risk the lives and </b></p>
<p><b>prosperity of our own people.</b></p>
<p><b>The case I make is that </b>the UN resolutions demanding he stops his WMD programme </p>
<p>are being flouted; that <b>since the inspectors left four years ago, he has continued with </b></p>
<p><b>this programme; </b>that the inspectors must be allowed back in to do their job properly; and </p>
<p>that if he refuses, or if he makes it impossible for them to do their job, as he has done in </p>
<p>the past, the international community will have to act.</p>
<p>I believe that faced with the information available to me, the UK Government has been </p>
<p>right to support the demands that this issue be confronted and dealt with. We must ensure </p>
<p>that he does not get to use the weapons he has, or get hold of the weapons he wants. </p>
<p><b>Key points in the dossier</b></p>
<p><b>561.  As discussed by the JIC on 11 September, the dossier highlighted the </b></p>
<p><b>contribution which recent intelligence had made to the assessment of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>activity since 1998 and on Saddam Hussein’s readiness to deploy and use </b></p>
<p><b>chemical and biological weapons.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>562. </b> The Executive Summary of the Iraq dossier stated that, in addition to the public </p>
<p>evidence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles, the Government </p>
<p>had “significant additional information … from secret intelligence sources” which, </p>
<p>although it could not “tell us about everything”, provided “a fuller picture of Iraqi plans </p>
<p>and capabilities”.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>563. </b> In the chapter on the role of intelligence, the dossier stated that intelligence had </p>
<p>“provided important insights into Iraqi programmes and Iraqi military thinking”, and that:</p>
<p>“Taken together with what is already known from other sources, this intelligence </p>
<p>builds our understanding of Iraq’s capabilities and adds significantly to the analysis </p>
<p>in the public domain.”</p>
<p><b>564. </b> The dossier stated that the chapter on the current position set out “what we know </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, </p>
<p>drawing on all the available evidence”.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> It drew “heavily on the latest intelligence about </p>
<p>Iraqi efforts to develop their programmes and capabilities since 1998” to support a list </p>
<p>of “<b>main conclusions</b>”, including that Saddam Hussein continued:</p>
<p>“… to attach great importance to the possession of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>and ballistic missiles which he regards as being the basis for Iraq’s regional power. </p>
<p>He is determined to retain these capabilities …”</p>
<p>CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS</p>
<p><b>565. </b> The dossier stated that, by 1991, Iraq had produced more than 16,000 free-fall </p>
<p>bombs and more than 110,000 artillery rockets and shells for the delivery of chemical </p>
<p>and biological agents.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> It had also admitted to having 50 chemical and 25 biological </p>
<p>warheads available for ballistic missiles.</p>
<p><b>566. </b> UNSCOM had destroyed 30 of the warheads filled with chemical agents.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> It had </p>
<p>also destroyed chemical munitions, agent and precursors and biological seed stocks and </p>
<p>growth media, and dismantled or destroyed chemical and biological production facilities.</p>
<p><b>567. </b> The dossier challenged Iraq’s claims that chemical agents produced before 1991 </p>
<p>would have deteriorated sufficiently to render them harmless and that it had destroyed </p>
<p>all its biological weapons and agent.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>568. </b> Addressing the chemical and biological weapons and material Iraq might have </p>
<p>produced or obtained, which UNSCOM had been unable to account for when it left, the </p>
<p>dossier quoted the figures given to Parliament by Mr Straw on 2 May 2002, including </p>
<p>“over 30,000 special munitions for delivery of chemical and biological agents.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> It added: </p>
<p>“The departure of UNSCOM meant that the international community was unable to </p>
<p>establish the truth behind these large discrepancies and greatly diminished its ability </p>
<p>to monitor and assess Iraq’s continuing attempts to reconstitute its programmes.”</p>
<p><b>569. </b> In respect of chemical and biological weapons, the Executive Summary stated:</p>
<p>“As a result of that intelligence, we judge that Iraq has:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued to produce chemical and biological agents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including </p>
<p>against its own Shia population. Some of these weapons are deployable </p>
<p>within 45 minutes of an order to use them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>command and control arrangements in place to use chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons. Authority ultimately resides with Saddam Hussein. (There is </p>
<p>intelligence that he may have delegated this authority to his son Qusay);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>developed mobile laboratories for military use, corroborating earlier reports </p>
<p>about the mobile production of biological warfare agents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pursued illegal programmes to procure controlled material of potential use </p>
<p>in the production of chemical and biological weapons programmes …”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>570. </b> In its “<b>main conclusions</b>”, the dossier stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has a usable chemical and biological weapons capability … which has </p>
<p>included recent production of chemical and biological agents.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq can deliver chemical and biological agents using an extensive range </p>
<p>of artillery shells, free-fall bombs, sprayers and ballistic missiles.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq’s military forces are able to use chemical and biological weapons, with </p>
<p>command, control and logistical arrangements in place. The Iraqi military are </p>
<p>able to deploy these weapons within 45 minutes of a decision to do so.”</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>571. </b> In the main text, the dossier stated that the JIC had, in the last six months, </p>
<p>“confirmed its earlier judgements on Iraqi chemical and biological warfare capabilities </p>
<p>and assessed that Iraq has the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>572. </b> In a section on “<b>Recent Intelligence</b>”, the dossier stated:</p>
<p>“Subsequently intelligence has become available from reliable sources which </p>
<p>complements and adds to previous intelligence and confirms the JIC assessment </p>
<p>that Iraq has chemical and biological weapons. The intelligence also shows that the </p>
<p>Iraqi leadership has been discussing a number of issues related to these weapons. </p>
<p>This intelligence covers:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Confirmation that chemical and biological weapons play an important </b></p>
<p><b>role in Iraqi military thinking:</b> intelligence shows that Saddam attaches </p>
<p>great importance to the possession of chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>which he regards as being the basis for Iraqi regional power. He believes </p>
<p>that respect for Iraq rests on its possession of these weapons and the </p>
<p>missiles capable of delivering them. Intelligence indicates that Saddam is </p>
<p>determined to retain this capability and recognises that Iraqi political weight </p>
<p>would be diminished if Iraq’s military power rested solely on its conventional </p>
<p>military forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s attempts to retain its existing banned weapon systems:</b> </p>
<p>Iraq is already taking steps to prevent the UN weapons inspectors finding </p>
<p>evidence of its chemical and biological weapons programme. Intelligence </p>
<p>indicates that Saddam has learnt lessons from previous weapons </p>
<p>inspections, has identified possible weak points in the inspections process </p>
<p>and knows how to exploit them. Sensitive equipment and papers can easily </p>
<p>be concealed and in some cases this is already happening. The possession </p>
<p>of mobile biological agent production facilities will also aid concealment </p>
<p>efforts. Saddam is determined not to lose the capabilities that he has been </p>
<p>able to develop further in the four years since inspectors left.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Saddam’s willingness to use chemical and biological weapons:</b> </p>
<p>intelligence indicates that as part of Iraq’s military planning Saddam is willing </p>
<p>to use chemical and biological weapons, including against his own Shia </p>
<p>population. Intelligence indicates that the Iraqi military are able to deploy </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons within 45 minutes of an order to do so.”</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>573. </b> In a section on “<b>Chemical agent: production facilities</b>”, the dossier stated: </p>
<p>“Intelligence shows that Iraq has continued to produce chemical agent.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>574. </b> In a similar section on “<b>Biological agent: production facilities</b>”, the dossier </p>
<p>stated: “We know from intelligence that Iraq has continued to produce biological </p>

<p>“UNSCOM established that Iraq considered the use of mobile biological agent </p>
<p>production facilities. In the past two years evidence from defectors has indicated the </p>
<p>existence of such facilities. Recent intelligence confirms that the Iraqi military have </p>
<p>developed mobile facilities.”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Summarising the section on chemical and biological weapons, the dossier stated:</p>
<p>“Intelligence shows that Iraq has covert chemical and biological weapons </p>

<p>Iraq has: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons available, both from pre-Gulf War stocks </p>
<p>and more recent production;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the capability to produce the chemical agents …</p>

<p>…”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</p>
<p><b>577. </b> The dossier stated that Iraq’s aim pre-1991 “was to produce a missile warhead </p>
<p>with a 20-kiloton yield and weapons designs were produced for the simplest implosion </p>
<p>weapons”.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> Iraq had pursued a number of programmes to produce highly enriched </p>
<p>uranium, for the warhead. The enrichment programmes had made little progress </p>
<p>before the Gulf Conflict, but the nuclear programme was supported by a large body of </p>
<p>expertise, programme documentation and databases and manufacturing infrastructure. </p>
<p><b>578. </b> In respect of nuclear weapons, the Executive Summary stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tried covertly to acquire technology and materials which could be used in the </p>
<p>production of nuclear weapons;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>from Africa that has no civil nuclear application …”</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>580. </b> The dossier stated that the JIC assessed that Iraq had continued its nuclear </p>
<p>research after 1998 and “drew attention to intelligence that Iraq had recalled its nuclear </p>
<p>scientists to the programme in 1998”. “Since 1998 Iraq had been trying to procure items </p>
<p>that could be for use in the construction of centrifuges …”</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>581. </b> In a section on “<b>Iraq’s nuclear weapons expertise</b>”, the dossier stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had dismantled the physical infrastructure of Iraq’s nuclear weapons </p>
<p>and removed the remaining highly enriched uranium, “But Iraq retained, and </p>
<p>retains many of its experienced nuclear scientists and technicians who are </p>
<p>specialised in the production of fissile material and weapon design. Intelligence </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence shows that the present Iraqi programme is almost certainly seeking </p>
<p>an indigenous capability to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Following the departure of the inspectors in 1998 there has been an </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq’s known holdings of processed uranium are under IAEA supervision. </p>
<p>But there is intelligence that Iraq has sought the supply of significant quantities </p>
<p>of uranium from Africa. Iraq has no … legitimate reason to acquire uranium.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>concluded in early 2002 that “Iraq had begun to develop missiles with a range </p>
<p>of over 1,000kms”, but it assessed that “if sanctions remained effective”, Iraq </p>
<p>“would not be able to produce such a missile before 2007”. </p>
<p><b>586. </b> In a section on Iraq’s ballistic missile programme since 1998, the dossier stated:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The engine test facility being constructed at al-Rafah would “be capable of </p>
<p>testing engines” with ranges over 1,000km and “would not be needed” for </p>
<p>systems within the 150km permitted range.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “managed to rebuild much of the missile production infrastructure” </p>
<p>destroyed in 1991 and 1998 and new missile-related infrastructure was “under </p>
<p>construction”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Despite a UN embargo, Iraq has also made concerted efforts to acquire </p>
<p>additional production technology …”</p>

<p>FUNDING FOR THE WMD PROGRAMME</p>
<p><b>587. </b> The Executive Summary of the dossier stated that Iraq had an illegal income </p>
<p>of some US$3bn from “illicit earnings generated outside UN control”.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>588. </b> The dossier acknowledged that the proportion of those funds that was used </p>
<p>to develop or acquire military equipment was unknown, but stated:</p>
<p>“… we have seen no evidence that Iraqi attempts to develop its weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and its ballistic missile programme … has been inhibited in any way by </p>
<p>lack of funds. The steady increase [in illicit funds] over the last three years in the </p>
<p>availability of funds will enable Saddam to progress the programmes faster.”</p>
<p><b>Questions about the judgements in the dossier</b></p>
<p><b>589.  The judgements expressed in the dossier and how they were reached have </b></p>
<p><b>already been examined by the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Intelligence and </b></p>

<p> The ISC stated that it had “looked at the supporting intelligence in </p>
<p>critical areas to ensure that the [JIC] Assessments reflected the intelligence correctly”.</p>
<p><b>592. </b> The <i>Report of the Inquiry into the Circumstances Surrounding the Death of </i></p>
<p><i>Dr David L Kelly CMG</i> by Lord Hutton (“The Hutton Inquiry”, HC 247), was published on </p>
<p>28 January 2004.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>593. </b> In relation to the question of whether the judgements were improperly influenced </p>
<p>by Mr Campbell or No.10, Lord Hutton concluded:</p>
<p>“Mr Campbell made it clear to Mr Scarlett on behalf of the Prime Minister that  </p>
<p>10 Downing Street wanted the dossier to be worded to make as strong a case  </p>
<p>as possible in relation to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s WMD, and  </p>
<p>10 Downing Street made written suggestions to Mr Scarlett as to changes in  </p>
<p>the wording of the draft dossier which would strengthen it. But Mr Campbell  </p>
<p>recognised, and told Mr Scarlett that 10 Downing Street recognised, that nothing </p>
<p>should be stated in the dossier with which the intelligence community were not </p>
<p>entirely happy.</p>
<p>“Mr Scarlett accepted some of the drafting amendments suggested to him by </p>
<p>10 Downing Street but he only accepted those suggestions which were consistent </p>
<p>with the intelligence known to the JIC and he rejected those suggestions which were </p>
<p>not consistent with such intelligence and the dossier … was approved by the JIC.</p>
<p>“As the dossier was one to be presented to, and read by, Parliament and the </p>
<p>public … I do not consider that it was improper for Mr Scarlett and the JIC to take </p>
<p>into account suggestions as to drafting made by 10 Downing Street and to adopt </p>
<p>those suggestions if they were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC. </p>
<p>However I consider that the possibility cannot be completely ruled out that the desire </p>
<p>of the Prime Minister to have a dossier which, whilst consistent with the available </p>
<p>intelligence, was as strong as possible in relation to the threat posed by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s WMD, may have subconsciously influenced Mr Scarlett and other </p>
<p>members of the JIC to make the wording of the dossier somewhat stronger than </p>
<p>it would have been if it had been contained in a normal JIC Assessment. Although </p>
<p>this possibility cannot be completely ruled out, I am satisfied that Mr Scarlett, the </p>
<p>other members of the JIC, and the members of the Assessment Staff engaged in </p>
<p>the drafting of the dossier were concerned to ensure that the contents of the dossier </p>
<p>were consistent with the intelligence available to the JIC.</p>
<p>“The term ‘sexed-up’ is a slang expression, the meaning of which lacks clarity in </p>
<p>the context of the discussion of the dossier. It is capable of two different meanings. </p>

<p>It could mean that the dossier was embellished with items of intelligence known </p>

<p>drafted in such a way as to make the case against Saddam Hussein as strong </p>
<p>as the intelligence contained in it permitted. If the term is used in this latter sense, </p>
<p>then because of the drafting suggestions made by 10 Downing Street for the </p>
<p>purpose of making a strong case against Saddam Hussein, it could be said that the </p>
<p>Government ‘sexed up’ the dossier. However … I consider that the allegation … that </p>

<p>322</p>
<p><b>595. </b> Describing the purpose of the dossier, the Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>“… the dossier was not intended to make the case for a particular course of action </p>
<p>in relation to Iraq. It was intended by the Government to promote domestic and </p>
<p>international understanding of, and gain support for, the general direction in which </p>
<p>Government policy had been moving since the early months of 2002, away from </p>
<p>containment to a more proactive approach to enforcing Iraqi disarmament.”</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>596. </b> The Butler Report also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Government wanted a document on which it could draw in its advocacy </p>
<p>of its policy. The JIC sought to offer a dispassionate assessment of intelligence </p>
<p>and other material on Iraqi nuclear, biological, chemical and ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes.”</p>
<p>324</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… <b>the language of the dossier may have left with readers the impression </b></p>
<p><b>that there was fuller and firmer intelligence behind the judgements </b></p>
<p><b>than was the case: our view, having reviewed all of the material, is that </b></p>
<p><b>judgements in the dossier went to (although not beyond) the outer limits </b></p>
<p><b>of the intelligence available.</b> The Prime Minister’s description in his statement </p>
<p>to the House of Commons … [on 24 September] of the picture painted by the </p>

<p><b>597. </b> The Iraq Inquiry has drawn on the evidence offered to those Inquiries, and their </p>
<p>analysis and conclusions, in reaching a view on the aspects of the dossier addressed </p>
<p>in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p><b>Defence Intelligence Staff concerns</b></p>
<p><b>598.  During the drafting of the dossier, questions were raised by staff in the DIS </b></p>
<p><b>about the basis for the judgements on Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities and its intent to use chemical and biological weapons. </b></p>
<p><b>599. </b> The DIS comments on the draft dossier on 17 September, expressing concerns </p>
<p>that some of the statements on chemical and biological weapons in the draft could not </p>
<p>be substantiated by the intelligence seen by the DIS, which were discussed in Mr Miller’s </p>
<p>meeting that morning, are set out earlier in this Section.</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Mr Miller confirmed that no minute was taken of the meeting.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that the DIS comments had been discussed </p>
<p>by the formal drafting group on 17 September and that:</p>
<p>“They were dealt with within that process and they were not brought forward by the </p>
<p>DIS senior management to the level of the JIC.”</p>
<p>327</p>
<p><b>602. </b> Mr Cragg told the Hutton Inquiry that, at the meeting on 17 September, “it was </p>
<p>agreed that the SIS representative would make further representations” to the DIS </p>
<p>about the “very tightly held intelligence [the report of 11 September]” and that the SIS </p>
<p>representative had spoken to Dr Paul Roper, DIS Director of Science and Technology, </p>
<p>and told him that “SIS believed it was good intelligence”.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Cragg told Lord Hutton that it was reported to him that the concern about </p>
<p>the discontinuity between the main text of the dossier and the Executive Summary </p>
<p>had been:</p>
<p>“… put … down to the fact that the Executive Summary pulled together or reflected </p>
<p>not merely recent intelligence which was … contained in the main text, but also </p>
<p>the general context of the new intelligence which had been received, such as the </p>
<p>knowledge, which we had had for many years, of the capabilities of the Iraqis in their </p>
<p>use of chemical weapons and also our knowledge that they had commander control </p>
<p>arrangements for the use of these weapons in place.”</p>
<p>329</p>
<p><b>604. </b> Mr Scarlett subsequently told the Hutton Inquiry that, after the meeting </p>
<p>on 17 September, Mr Miller had reported the DIS concerns about the statements </p>
<p>on the production of “CW agent”, because it related to “the existence of additional </p>

<p>compartmented intelligence [the SIS report of 11 September]”, which had not been </p>
<p>seen by the DIS, “which was underpinning the judgement”.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> He had been told that </p>
<p>arrangements had been made to brief “DIS management” on the intelligence. Mr Scarlett </p>
<p>added that, in the absence of comment on that point in the DIS comments on the draft </p>
<p>dossier on 19 September, silence had been taken as assent. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Iraq Inquiry that he “was aware that there had been </p>
<p>questioning from within the DIS about the fact that they hadn’t seen the compartmented </p>
<p>[11 September] report”. He and Mr Miller had “agreed that it would be necessary” for the </p>
<p>DIS to be shown the report and, as far as he was concerned, “that happened” and there </p>
<p>was “no further awareness” on his part.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>606. </b> In a minute on 19 September to Dr Roper, Dr Brian Jones, the branch head of the </p>
<p>nuclear, biological and chemical section in the Scientific and Technical Directorate of the </p>
<p>Defence Intelligence Staff, wrote:</p>
<p>“1. … the generation of the Iraqi dossier which, in the last two weeks has </p>
<p>involved a number of iterations which have incorporated new intelligence. It is my </p>
<p>understanding that some of the intelligence has not been made available to my </p>
<p>branch. Because of this they have had to express their reservations on several </p>
<p>aspects of the dossier. Most of these have been resolved. However a number </p>
<p>remain … and it is important that I note for you at this stage the remaining areas </p>
<p>where we are unable to confirm the statements made on the basis of the information </p>
<p>available to my branch.</p>
<p>“2. Although we have no problem with a judgement based on intelligence that </p>
<p>Saddam attaches great importance to possessing WMD we have not seen the </p>
<p>intelligence that ‘shows’ this to be the case. Nor have we seen intelligence that </p>
<p>‘shows’ he does not regard them only as a weapon of last resort, although our </p>
<p>judgement is that it would be sensible to assume that he might use them in a </p>
<p>number of other scenarios. The intelligence we have seen indicates rather than </p>
<p>‘shows’ that Iraq has been planning to conceal its WMD capabilities, and it would </p>
<p>be … reasonable to assume that he would do this.</p>
<p>“3. We have a number of questions in our minds relating to the intelligence on </p>
<p>military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, particularly about the </p>
<p>times mentioned and the failure to differentiate between the two types of weapon.</p>
<p>“4. We have not seen intelligence which we believe ‘shows’ that Iraq has continued </p>
<p>to produce CW agent in 1998-2002, although our judgement is that it has probably </p>
<p>done so. Whilst we are even more convinced that Iraq has continued to produce </p>
<p>BW agent (on the basis of mobile production intelligence) we would not go so far </p>
<p>as to say that we ‘know’ this to be the case.</p>

<p>“5. Finally … we are pleased that the claim that Iraq used aflatoxin against the Shia </p>
<p>uprising has been excluded from the dossier but we are concerned that the claim </p>
<p>in relation to mustard remains as we consider the evidence to be weak.”</p>

<p><b>607. </b> Dr Jones sent a copy of his minute to the office of Mr Cragg and others in the </p>
<p>Defence Intelligence Staff.</p>
<p><b>608. </b> The following day, the chemical warfare expert in Dr Jones’ team wrote to Dr Roper </p>
<p>setting out in detail his concerns about aspects of the dossier.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p><b>609. </b> In relation to the statement in the draft Foreword, that Mr Blair believed that the </p>
<p>“assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt” that “Saddam has continued to </p>
<p>produce chemical and biological weapons”, the minute stated:</p>
<p>“I acknowledge that in this statement the Prime Minister will be expressing his own </p>
<p>‘belief’ about what the assessed intelligence has established. What I wish to record </p>
<p>is that based on the intelligence available to me it has NOT established beyond </p>
<p>doubt that Saddam has continued to produce chemical [and biological] weapons.” </p>
<p><b>610. </b> Addressing the statement in the Foreword that “military planning allows for some </p>
<p>of the WMD to be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them”, and a “similar </p>
<p>statement” in the dossier, the minute stated:</p>
<p>“This is reported as a fact whereas the intelligence comes from a single source. </p>
<p>In my view the intelligence warrants no stronger a statement than ‘… intelligence </p>
<p>suggest that military planning allows …’” </p>
<p><b>611. </b> Addressing the judgement in paragraph 6 of the Executive Summary, that Iraq had </p>
<p>“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”, the minute stated:</p>
<p>“I have seen intelligence that suggests that production of chemical agents has </p>
<p>continued but in my judgement this warrants no stronger statement than ‘Iraq has … </p>
<p><i>probably</i> continued to produce chemical [and biological] agents.’”</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Addressing the judgement in paragraph 6 of the Executive Summary, that “Some </p>
<p>of these weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use them”, the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>613. </b> In relation to statements in Chapter 3 of the dossier, the minute stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Paragraph 1, first bullet: the “statement about ‘recent production of chemical </p>
<p>[and biological] agents’” could not “be supported” by the intelligence available </p>
<p>to the author.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Paragraph 5, first bullet: the author believed that the statement that “Intelligence </p>
<p>shows that Saddam attaches great importance to the possession of chemical </p>
<p>[and biological] weapons” was “far too strong” and “in contrast to other </p>
<p>statements in this paragraph which use the term ‘intelligence indicates that’ </p>
<p>which is more balanced”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Paragraph 8, first bullet: the intelligence available to the author warranted a </p>
<p>statement “no stronger” than “Iraq has probably continued to produce chemical </p>
<p>agent”, not the statement that “Intelligence shows that Iraq has continued to </p>
<p>produce chemical agent.”</p>
<p><b>614. </b> The minute was copied to Mr Cragg’s office and to Dr Jones.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Dr Jones told Lord Hutton that the “problems” with the 45 minutes report of </p>
<p>30 August “fell into three categories”. The information was “second-hand”; it “did not </p>
<p>differentiate between … chemical … or … biological weapons”; and there was “a lack </p>
<p>of collateral intelligence”.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>616. </b> Dr Jones explained that the circumstances in which it would be important to deliver </p>
<p>biological weapons within 45 minutes “would be fairly special circumstances” and that </p>
<p>“had pushed us into thinking perhaps we were talking about chemical weapons”. It was </p>
<p>“easy” to put chemical and biological weapons:</p>
<p>“… together in a collective term … But there was an element of doubt coming into </p>
<p>our analysis … We would have looked, normally, for further definitions to feel really </p>
<p>comfortable …”</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Dr Jones also stated that they had been “worried” by the absence of evidence </p>
<p>relating to the production of chemical agents and that:</p>
<p>“We had not seen the weapons being produced. We had no evidence of any recent </p>
<p>testing or field trials … So that all cast some doubts in our mind on that particular </p>
<p>piece of intelligence.”</p>
<p><b>618. </b> Dr Jones told Lord Hutton that he thought the intelligence was “important” but the </p>
<p>references in the draft dossier were “too strong”. It was:</p>
<p>“… reasonable to say that the intelligence indicated that this was the case … but … </p>
<p>we did not think the intelligence showed it absolutely beyond any shadow of doubt.” </p>

<p>233</p>
<p><b>619. </b> Dr Jones told Lord Hutton that he had been informed of the concerns of his staff </p>
<p>about the statements on the “continued production of chemical and biological agents”; </p>
<p>and that there “was said to be additional intelligence that actually had it been available </p>
<p>to us would have removed those concerns”.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> He had discussed the issue with his </p>
<p>Director, Dr Roper. Dr Roper had not seen the intelligence but “a senior official from </p>
<p>one of the … agencies” had “suggested to him that the intelligence judgements that </p>
<p>were being made in the dossier were in fact okay because … they were supported </p>
<p>by the additional intelligence”. Dr Jones added that he had said the DIS should express </p>
<p>a reservation about the language. </p>
<p><b>620. </b> Dr Jones subsequently stated that his staff had “no evidence that significant </p>
<p>production had taken place either of chemical warfare agent or chemical weapons”.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>621. </b> Dr Jones also stated that the DIS had “not seen the weapons being produced. </p>
<p>We had no evidence of any recent testing or field trials …”</p>
<p>337</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>622. </b> Asked what he had done following receipt of Dr Jones’ minute, Mr Cragg told </p>
<p>the Hutton Inquiry that he had: </p>
<p>“… taken the view that on the question of the 45 minutes and of the chemical </p>
<p>weapon production, this had already been considered at length with the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office in their meeting of 17 September and that I was satisfied with the decisions </p>
<p>reached and consequently with the wording of the dossier at that point. On the … </p>
<p>importance attached to the possession of chemical weapons, the absence of </p>
<p>proof … they are not seen … as weapons of last resort. And the absence of … </p>
<p>definitive proof, that efforts are being made to conceal them. I took the view on </p>
<p>each of those there had been much intelligence over the years, not merely in the </p>
<p>last few weeks … which sustained the view taken in the dossier.”</p>
<p>338</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Asked whether Dr Jones’ minute of 19 September 2002 was “strong language </p>
<p>for intelligence personnel”, Mr Cragg replied:</p>
<p>“Yes. I was quite surprised to receive the minute because … we had tried to explain </p>
<p>what the situation was, certainly on the production issue and, as far as I can tell also </p>
<p>perhaps, although I am not certain, on the 45 minutes.”</p>
<p>339</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Mr Cragg stated that he had “taken the view that since all the issues had either </p>
<p>been discussed with the Cabinet Office or were well within the general thrust of known </p>
<p>intelligence that it was not necessary to raise the issue with Mr Scarlett”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Mr Cragg stated:</p>
<p>“… the dossier reflected the JIC Assessments on the recent intelligence; and the JIC </p>
<p>Assessments were an accurate reflection, put into context, of the intelligence itself. </p>
<p>So it was a flow of perfectly reputable intelligence conveyed by the Assessment Staff </p>
<p>and ourselves into the JIC Assessment and thence into the dossier.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… I am quite sure … the dossier … does not go beyond … available intelligence.”</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>626. </b> Mr Cragg stated that he had subsequently held a meeting with the Director </p>
<p>of Global Issues, the Director of Science and Technology and the DIS staff who had </p>
<p>attended the Assessment Staff meeting. He had been told, in relation to the 45 minute </p>
<p>intelligence:</p>
<p>“… firstly, on the actual detailed intelligence, recent intelligence underpinning the </p>
<p>main text and partly the Executive Summary, that the Secret Intelligence Service, </p>
<p>SIS, were satisfied that the source was established and reliable and … they </p>
<p>supported the reporting, which had already been included in a JIC Assessment </p>
<p>on 9 September.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… My staff also reported … there had been a discussion … of the general context </p>
<p>in which the new intelligence had appeared which convinced them that it was quite </p>
<p>reasonable to take the line they did in Executive Summary concerning the likelihood </p>
<p>or the capability of the Iraqis to deploy weapons of mass destruction within </p>
<p>45 minutes of a decision to do so.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… I understand from my staff that there was a discussion of the validity of the </p>
<p>source, which would almost certainly have included whether it was single source.”</p>
<p><b>627. </b> Mr Cragg added that a:</p>
<p>“… single source has to be looked at with some care; but this was a known </p>
<p>source, established and reliable with a good reporting record. And the statements </p>
<p>he was making, the intelligence he was providing was well in context of known </p>
<p>Iraqi approaches.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“So in that sense – I think Mr Scarlett said it fairly clearly – there were no qualms </p>
<p>about including this reporting.”</p>

<p><b>628. </b> AM French confirmed to the Hutton Inquiry that, having seen Dr Jones’ minute </p>
<p>of 19 September, he had been content with the dossier.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p><b>629. </b> In response to a question about whether Mr Scarlett had “tightened” the language </p>
<p>in the dossier in the draft of 18 September, to take account of the points raised by </p>
<p>Mr Campbell in his minute of 17 September rather than the points raised by the DIS </p>
<p>the same day, Mr Cragg replied: “Yes.”</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>630. </b> Asked about the way in which he had dealt with the comments provided by the DIS </p>
<p>and Mr Campbell on 17 September, Mr Scarlett told the Hutton Inquiry that the issues </p>
<p>raised by the DIS had been discussed in Mr Miller’s meeting before Mr Campbell’s </p>
<p>minute was received.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>631. </b> Mr Scarlett told Lord Hutton that the intelligence on weapons being available for use </p>
<p>within 45 minutes “came from an established and reliable source quoting a senior Iraqi </p>
<p>military officer in a position to know this information”.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> It had been “judged straight away </p>
<p>that the intelligence was consistent with established JIC judgements on the command </p>
<p>control and logistical arrangements and capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces … [F]or the </p>
<p>first time in our reporting it gave a particular time, gave some precision.”</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Mr Scarlett stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had been agreed that the Assessments Staff would look again at the </p>
<p>Assessment and the intelligence report to “bring the text … into line with what </p>
<p>the Assessment and the intelligence said”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In relation to the DIS suggestion that the wording in the Executive Summary </p>
<p>should be qualified by adding “intelligence suggests that”, the Assessments Staff </p>
<p>had taken the view that “it was not possible to qualify” its judgement in that way: </p>
<p>“It was not a summary of the main points in the text, it was a judgement.” </p>
<p><b>633. </b> Mr Scarlett stated that the main text in the dossier was redrafted to reflect </p>
<p>the “original intelligence which contained no caveat of uncertainty” and the </p>
<p>JIC Assessment.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>634. </b> The JIC Assessment of 9 September stated: </p>
<p>“Iraq has probably dispersed its special weapons, including its CBW weapons. </p>
<p>Intelligence also indicates that chemical and biological munitions could be with </p>
<p>military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes.”</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>635. </b> In response to a series of questions intended to elicit whether the “assessors” </p>
<p>should have had regard to the fact that they did not know to which munitions the report </p>
<p>referred, where they were, and that the information was second-hand, albeit relayed </p>
<p>through a reliable intermediary, Mr Scarlett replied:</p>
<p>“You are talking as if the assessors … operate in a vacuum. They do not. They are </p>
<p>assessing individual reports against the background of their knowledge. This was </p>
<p>a point of precision, to an assessment which already existed about the capability </p>
<p>of the Iraqi armed forces in this area.”</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Scarlett subsequently stated: “The sentence in the [JIC] Assessment was </p>
<p>referring to the intelligence report … It was not looking at it in the wider context.” </p>
<p>That was “taken into account in the main body of the text” but the judgement in </p>
<p>the Executive Summary “was a different point”; it did “not just confine itself to one </p>
<p>intelligence report”.</p>
<p><b>637. </b> The Iraq Inquiry wrote to Air Chief Marshal Sir Joe French, Mr Cragg, and </p>
<p>Dr Roper asking a number of specific questions about whether they had seen or been </p>
<p>briefed on the report of 11 September, and with whom they had discussed the issues </p>
<p>that arose.</p>
<p><b>638. </b> In his statement, ACM French confirmed that he had seen the 11 September </p>
<p>report but he “did not receive any further briefing on it”.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> He had not discussed the </p>
<p>distribution of the report with either Mr Cragg or Dr Roper and could not “remember </p>
<p>receiving any advice or briefing” on it from them. Nor could he “remember detail of </p>
<p>the discussion” at any JIC meeting.</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Asked whether he had asked for the report to be made available to the relevant </p>
<p>experts in the DIS for their assessment, ACM French wrote:</p>
<p>“Given the way the compilation of the dossier was being handled with the </p>
<p>involvement of the specialists/experts from across the intelligence community, </p>
<p>including the DIS, I would have expected them to [be] given the background to </p>
<p>this intelligence if not access to the report itself. This was a regular occurrence </p>
<p>where intelligence initially on limited distribution would be shared at the experts </p>

<p>level to allow common understanding of issues for the drafting of cross intelligence </p>
<p>community reports and studies commissioned by the JIC.”</p>
<p><b>640. </b> ACM French also wrote that he had not discussed the concerns raised by DIS </p>
<p>staff with Mr Scarlett, Mr Miller, or any member of the Assessments Staff. He could </p>
<p>not “remember the specific discussion” with Mr Cragg or Dr Roper but added:</p>
<p>“… in the regular staffing of JIC papers, the dossier included, it was not unusual </p>
<p>for subject matter experts to have differences of opinion over the emphasis given </p>
<p>to specific strands of intelligence and those concerns would be raised with me for </p>
<p>consideration before final clearance.”</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Asked on what basis he had given formal DIS endorsement to the judgements </p>
<p>in the dossier given the advice of some members of the DIS that the final draft was, </p>
<p>in some respects, stronger than the intelligence indicated, ACM French wrote:</p>
<p>“The fact that individuals expressed concern was part of the usual process of </p>
<p>debate and assessment which went on regularly within the DIS and within the wider </p>
<p>intelligence community as a prelude to a consensus being reached by the JIC. </p>
<p>My judgement was that the well tried due process had been followed and I was </p>
<p>content with the final draft of the dossier.”</p>
<p><b>642. </b> In his statement to the Iraq Inquiry, Mr Cragg wrote that he had not seen the report </p>
<p>and that he had had “no discussions at the time” with “anybody” about its contents and </p>
<p>implications because he “had not received it or had any knowledge of its contents or </p>
<p>source”.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> He had “asked Dr Roper to inform Dr Jones … of the strict compartmenting </p>
<p>of the report at the earliest opportunity”.</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Asked about his response to the concerns raised by DIS staff, Mr Cragg wrote </p>
<p>that he had had “a brief discussion with Dr Roper on 17 September about the [DIS] </p>
<p>comments on the draft of 16 September”. He had “interrupted a meeting” he was holding </p>
<p>with Dr Roper and the DIS Director of Global Issues on 17 September to allow them to </p>
<p>hear an account of the meeting held by Mr Miller. The DIS officials who had attended the </p>
<p>meeting reported that “the SIS participant had informed them that particularly sensitive </p>
<p>intelligence on the production of chemical and biological agent had very recently been </p>
<p>received which supported the formulation in the draft”; and that Mr Miller “had concurred” </p>
<p>with that. The SIS representative had also informed them that the distribution would be </p>
<p>extremely limited.</p>
<p><b>644. </b> Mr Cragg did not attend the JIC meeting on 11 September. He wrote that the </p>
<p>11 September SIS report was not discussed at the JIC meeting on 18 September.</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Mr Cragg saw a copy of Dr Jones’ minute to Dr Roper of 19 September in which </p>
<p>he stated that he and his staff “considered that in their judgement Iraq was probably </p>

<p>producing chemical and biological agents but they had not seen the intelligence to </p>
<p>‘show’ this”. Dr Jones also reported that they “were even more convinced that Iraq had </p>
<p>continued to produce biological agents but that they would not go so far as to say that </p>
<p>they ‘know’ this”. </p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Cragg wrote that he had not discussed the minute with Dr Jones or Dr Roper </p>
<p>“because I read it after the working day and saw it as reiterating that neither he </p>
<p>[Dr Jones] nor his staff had seen the compartmented intelligence to support the </p>
<p>formulation in the draft, while at the same time confirming that the judgement of the </p>
<p>dossier on this issue was probably right”. He did not raise the matter with Mr Scarlett, </p>
<p>Mr Miller or the Assessments Staff, “because it was well known to the drafters of the </p>
<p>dossier that the DIS’ scientific staff had not seen the recent compartmented intelligence </p>
<p>on the current production of chemical and biological agent”. </p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Cragg was absent from the office from 20 to 24 September. He wrote that </p>
<p>he was:</p>
<p>“… satisfied with the draft of 19 September, which was substantially the same </p>
<p>as that of 20 September. I took the view that the judgement in the dossier on the </p>
<p>current production of chemical and biological agent in the Executive Summary </p>
<p>and the formulation in the main text was justified by the available intelligence on </p>
<p>production, including in the JIC Assessment of 9 September and my awareness that </p>
<p>the compartmented intelligence was seen as reliable. It was also consistent with our </p>
<p>overall assessment of Iraqi WMD capabilities.”</p>
<p><b>648. </b> In his statement to the Iraq Inquiry, Dr Roper confirmed that he had discussed </p>
<p>Dr Jones’ minute of 19 September with him on 23 September and that he could not:</p>
<p>“… recall all that was discussed; I sensed he was annoyed that so much had been </p>
<p>happening whilst he had been away. I do remember asking him a specific question </p>
<p>along the lines of ‘Are you telling me you do not believe there is WMD in Iraq?’ His </p>
<p>reply was along the line: ‘No I am not saying that, on balance I believe there is WMD </p>
<p>in Iraq but not with the degree of conviction implied in the draft dossier’.”</p>
<p>351</p>
<p><b>649. </b> Dr Roper wrote that Mr Cragg had raised Dr Jones’ letter with him “possibly later </p>
<p>that day [23 September]”. Dr Roper described Mr Cragg as “annoyed” that the letter had </p>
<p>been sent; and that Mr Cragg “seemed content” when Dr Roper relayed the gist of his </p>
<p>conversation with Dr Jones.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>650. </b> Dr Roper wrote that he was “more concerned” by a letter sent by the chemical </p>
<p>warfare expert in Dr Jones’ team on 20 September, which they had discussed with </p>
<p>the CW expert the following week. The CW expert had:</p>
<p>“… explained his understanding of the CW position in Iraq noting that there had </p>
<p>been thousands of tonnes of chemical agent, much of it destroyed by UNSCOM, </p>
<p>but he noted that he couldn’t rule out the existence of a few hundred tonnes of </p>
<p>unaccounted stock some of which could retain potency. However his key point was </p>
<p>that he had seen no evidence that Iraq had resumed any production of chemical </p>
<p>agent since the Gulf War.”</p>
<p><b>651. </b> Dr Roper wrote that he “was alerted to the existence of new sensitive material </p>
<p>on CW production” by an SIS officer by telephone. The conversation was short but </p>
<p>Dr Roper recalled that he was told “it referred to evidence of resumption in CW </p>
<p>production”. Dr Roper also wrote that he had been “assured” that Air Marshal French </p>
<p>and Mr Cragg had seen the document. Dr Roper could not recall the precise date of </p>
<p>that conversation, but he thought it had “probably” taken place before 23 September.</p>
<p><b>652. </b> Dr Roper wrote that he had not discussed the existence of the new intelligence </p>
<p>with either AM French or Mr Cragg, or with anyone else. His conversation with the CW </p>
<p>expert on 23 September:</p>
<p>“… was very late in the dossier production process and only minor editorial </p>
<p>comments on the wording were being called for at this stage. I concluded the </p>
<p>conversation with [name of expert] suggesting that those responsible for forming the </p>
<p>final judgement no doubt had access to this new intelligence and would take it into </p>
<p>consideration. I took no further action.”</p>
<p><b>653.  The Inquiry shares the view of the Butler Review that the dossier contained </b></p>
<p><b>a stronger assessment in relation to Iraqi chemical weapons production than was </b></p>
<p><b>justified by the available intelligence.</b></p>
<p><b>654.  The SIS report of 11 September was a factor in that.</b></p>
<p><b>655.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s concerns about ensuring the protection of </b></p>
<p><b>such an important potential source of evidence were, in the circumstances, </b></p>
<p><b>understandable. </b></p>
<p><b>656.  But the Inquiry shares the conclusion of the Butler Review that it should </b></p>
<p><b>have been shown to the experts in the Defence Intelligence Staff who could have </b></p>
<p><b>commented on the credibility and validity of that report and the subsequent </b></p>
<p><b>report issued on 23 September and advised their senior managers and the </b></p>
<p><b>Assessments Staff.</b></p>
<p><b>657.  Sir Richard Dearlove’s personal intervention, and its urgency, gave added </b></p>

<p><b>the judgements in the dossier on Iraq’s chemical and biological warfare </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities and intentions, including the reports of 11 and 23 September and the </b></p>
<p><b>“45 minutes” report, is addressed in Section 4.3. </b></p>
<p><b>659.  The Inquiry has identified a number of lessons which arise from the way </b></p>
<p><b>in which the dossier was produced at the end of this Section.</b></p>
<p><b>660. </b> The details of the JIC Assessments on Iraq’s WMD between December 2000 and </p>
<p>September 2002 demonstrate that<b> </b>the JIC consistently stated in those Assessments </p>
<p>that the intelligence on most aspects of Iraq’s activity in relation to chemical, biological </p>
<p>and nuclear weapons programmes was limited, and that many of its judgements were </p>
<p>inferential. </p>
<p><b>661. </b> The intelligence on Iraq’s ballistic missile programmes was more extensive, </p>
<p>but there were still significant uncertainties about Iraq’s capabilities.</p>
<p><b>662. </b> In relation to the concerns expressed by the DIS, Lord Hutton concluded:</p>
<p>“… the concerns expressed by Dr Jones were considered by higher echelons in the </p>
<p>Intelligence Services and were not acted upon, and the JIC … approved the wording </p>
<p>in the dossier. Moreover, the nuclear, chemical and biological weapons section of </p>
<p>the Defence Intelligence Staff, headed by Dr Brian Jones, did not argue that the </p>
<p>intelligence relating to the 45 minutes claim should not have been included in the </p>
<p>dossier but they did suggest that the wording in which the claim was stated was </p>
<p>too strong and that instead of the dossier stating ‘we judge’ that ‘Iraq has: – military </p>
<p>plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons, including against its own Shia </p>
<p>population. Some of those weapons are deployable within 45 minutes of an order </p>
<p>to use them’, the wording should state ‘intelligence suggests’.”</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>663. </b> The Butler Report stated that the 9 September JIC Assessment had been “written </p>
<p>to inform military and other contingency planning” but its “precautionary judgements”, </p>
<p>which were appropriate for that purpose:</p>
<p>“… were subsequently taken up into the dossier, and were taken up in an </p>
<p>abbreviated form in which points were run together and caveats on the intelligence </p>
<p>were dropped …</p>
<p>“…The same was true of the 21 August and 15 March Assessments … </p>

<p>“Experienced readers would have seen these warnings in the original JIC </p>
<p>Assessments and taken them into account … But the public … would not have </p>
<p>known … The dossier did include a first chapter on the role of intelligence, as </p>
<p>an introduction for the lay reader. But rather than illuminating the limitations of </p>
<p>intelligence … the language of this Chapter may have had the opposite effect … </p>
<p>Readers may, for example have read language in the dossier as implying that there </p>
<p>was fuller and firmer intelligence behind the judgements than was the case: our </p>
<p>view, having reviewed all the material, is that judgements in the dossier went to </p>
<p>(although not beyond) the outer limits of the intelligence available.”</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>664. </b> The Butler Report also stated that the dossier:</p>
<p>“… did not refer explicitly to the JIC’s uncertainty about the size of stocks of sarin </p>
<p>and VX precursors, and hence Iraq’s ability to produce these agents. Nor did it, like </p>
<p>the JIC Assessments, refer explicitly to the lack of intelligence on the location of </p>
<p>facilities for producing biological and chemical agent, although it did draw attention </p>
<p>to the difficulty of assessing the use made of ‘dual-use’ facilities.”</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>665. </b> The Butler Report concluded that: “<b>Partly because of inherent difficulties</b>”, </p>
<p>including the complications created by dual-use programmes, the JIC assessments of </p>
<p>Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes were “<b>less assured</b>” than the assessments </p>
<p>of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities, and that they:</p>
<p>“… tended to be over cautious and in some areas worst case. Where there was </p>
<p>a balance of inference to be drawn, it tended to go in the direction of inferring the </p>
<p>existence of banned weapons programmes. Assessments were as a consequence </p>
<p>less complete, especially in their considerations of alternative hypotheses, and used </p>
<p>a different burden of proof.”</p>
<p>355</p>
<p><b>666. </b> The Butler Report stated: </p>
<p>“<b>The intelligence community will have had in mind that Iraq had not only </b></p>
<p><b>owned but used its chemical weapons in the past. It will inevitably have been </b></p>
<p><b>influenced by the way in which the Iraqi regime was engaged in a sustained </b></p>
<p><b>programme to try to deceive United Nations inspectors</b> and to conceal from </p>
<p>them evidence of its prohibited programmes. Furthermore, because SIS did not have </p>
<p>agents with first-hand knowledge of Iraq’s nuclear, chemical, biological or ballistic </p>
<p>missile programmes, <b>most of the intelligence reports on which assessments </b></p>
<p><b>were being made were inferential. The Assessments Staff and JIC were </b></p>

<p>356</p>
<p><b>667. </b> The Butler Report also addressed the fact that the SIS report of 11 September </p>
<p>had been given a very restricted circulation and drew attention to the:</p>
<p>“… <b>evidence of difficulties that arose from the unduly strict </b></p>
<p><b>‘compartmentalisation’ of intelligence</b> which meant that experts in DIS did not </p>
<p>have access to an intelligence report which became available in September 2002 </p>
<p>and played a major role for the JIC in confirming previous intelligence reports that </p>
<p>Iraq was producing chemical and biological weapons.”</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Butler Review that:</p>
<p>“… SIS were concerned to minimise knowledge of the existence of the source during </p>
<p>what they expected to be an initial, very sensitive, period of development. The </p>
<p>source’s intelligence about chemical weapons production was therefore distributed </p>
<p>to an extremely limited circle of senior readers.”</p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>669. </b> The Butler Report stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It understood “SIS’s concern to give maximum protection to their source in those </p>
<p>particular, and transitional, circumstances”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had been “told that in-house SIS technical experts took a preliminary and </p>
<p>provisional view that the report should be issued, as being from ‘<i>A new source </i></p>
<p><i>on trial</i>’”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But the exclusion of Dr Jones and his staff from readership of the original </p>
<p>report meant that this intelligence was not seen by the few people in the UK </p>
<p>intelligence community able to form all-round, professional technical judgements </p>
<p>on its reliability and significance.”</p>

<p>The judgement reached by the JIC in this case should have been able to depend </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>In the event, the JIC had no reason to know that that had not happened.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was understandable that SIS should have wanted to give greater than normal </p>
<p>protection to the human intelligence source on this occasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But a problem arose because it was kept from the relevant DIS analysts who </p>
<p>had a wider perspective.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would have been more appropriate for senior managers in the DIS and SIS to </p>
<p>have made arrangements for the intelligence to be shown to DIS experts rather </p>
<p>than their making their own judgements on its significance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fact that it was not shown to them resulted in a stronger assessment in the </p>
<p>dossier in relation to Iraqi chemical weapons production than was justified by the </p>
<p>available intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It also deprived SIS of key expertise that would have helped them to assess the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>673. </b> Asked by the Iraq Inquiry whether, in the light of the view expressed at the JIC </p>
<p>meeting on 4 September that the 9 September Assessment needed to make clearer </p>
<p>where there were remaining major gaps in the UK’s knowledge and understanding of </p>
<p>Iraq’s capabilities, he had felt that this should have been an integral part of the dossier, </p>
<p>Sir John Scarlett replied:</p>
<p>“… there was no sort of discussion or conscious decision made to leave out </p>
<p>references to limited intelligence. There was no deliberate intention to do that.</p>
<p>“The reason it happened may be because of the way the dossier was structured, </p>
<p>and the fact that it began with an Executive Summary, which was explicitly a </p>
<p>collection of judgements, as opposed to a sort of listing of intelligence.</p>
<p>“The place where it could have happened would have been in the introduction </p>
<p>[Chapter 1: The Role of Intelligence], where we were talking about the nature </p>
<p>of intelligence …”</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>674. </b> Sir John added:</p>
<p>“But … the judgements and confidence in the judgements [in the 9 September </p>
<p>Assessment] was high, in spite of the areas where we didn’t have knowledge. </p>
<p>So it was the gaps in detailed knowledge, rather than [gaps] in confidence about </p>
<p>basic judgements.”</p>
<p><b>675. </b> Mr Miller added:</p>
<p>“The intelligence was not all encompassing … What we tried to do in the </p>
<p>Assessment and in the dossier was to describe the intelligence as directly as </p>
<p>we could, and then set out clearly and distinctly the judgements which had been </p>
<p>reached.</p>
<p>“… We felt it was right that the firmness of the judgements that had been expressed </p>
<p>in the classified Assessment [of 9 September] should be echoed in the published … </p>
<p>[dossier].”</p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>676. </b> Subsequently, in response to a question about the absence of caveats in the </p>
<p>Key Judgements of Assessments, which were what Ministers were “meant to read”, </p>
<p>Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… this is… the issue that effectively arose around the drafting of the dossier … it </p>
<p>wasn’t because they had deliberately been left out. It was because of the use of the </p>

<p><b>677. </b> Sir John added that, after the publication of the Butler Report in July 2004, “all </p>
<p>front pages of the Assessments [ie the page with the Key Judgements] have contained </p>
<p>a box on the intelligence base” which “spells out the strengths and weaknesses of </p>
<p>the intelligence”. That allowed the Key Judgements to be made while flagging up </p>
<p>the caveats.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Asked if he had expressed any concerns during the drafting of the dossier, for </p>
<p>instance about caveats being dropped or because the text becoming more definite than </p>
<p>a normal JIC report might have been, Sir Richard Dearlove replied:</p>
<p>“… with the benefit of hindsight, I was happy with what the dossier said in terms </p>
<p>of what we believed at the time that it was written.”</p>
<p>367</p>
<p><b>679. </b> In the context of a reference to comment in the Butler Report that the language </p>
<p>of the dossier may have left readers with the impression that there was fuller and firmer </p>
<p>intelligence behind the judgements in the dossier than was the case, Sir Richard added: </p>
<p>“Yes, I know it said that, but I think it is easy to write these things afterwards. I mean, </p>
<p>you know, at the time when that dossier was published, it’s what we believed on the </p>
<p>evidence available, partly historical – significantly historical – partly based on the </p>
<p>sources, […] </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… I had been worried about the dossier for a very long time because I didn’t feel </p>
<p>that we had a very substantive picture from intelligence. We had a substantive </p>
<p>picture from historical material. </p>
<p>“By the time, you know, the draft was complete, I was, I think, surprised how much </p>
<p>material had been assembled. I think you have to recall, when this document was </p>
<p>published -- and I would actually refer you also to the Institute of Strategic Studies </p>
<p>document. Both were felt to be rather conservative, rather reserved pictures of what </p>
<p>Iraq’s capability was at that time. You know, it’s only now – and I’m also firmly of the </p>

<p>THREAT TO THE UK NATIONAL INTEREST</p>
<p><b>682. </b> In relation to the statement in Mr Blair’s Foreword that he believed Iraq, and its </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, was “a current and serious threat to the UK national </p>
<p>interest”, the ISC stated:</p>
<p>“On the question of what direct threat Saddam, his regime and his WMD posed </p>
<p>to UK interests, the evidence is that UK forces deployed in the region to enforce </p>
<p>the … No-Fly Zones were threatened by conventional weapons, and could have </p>
<p>been threatened by any biological and chemical weapons that Saddam possessed. </p>
<p>Additionally, if Al Hussein missiles had been retained and they were operational </p>
<p>with conventional or chemical and biological warheads, they could have attacked </p>
<p>UK forces in Cyprus or those conducting operations in the region. Saddam’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes and his continued support of them increased this threat.”</p>
<p>370</p>
<p><b>683. </b> The ISC stated that the first draft of Mr Blair’s Foreword had made clear that </p>
<p>the Government recognised that Saddam Hussein did not pose a direct threat to the </p>
<p>UK: “The case I make is not that Saddam could launch a nuclear attack on London </p>
<p>or another part of the UK (He could not).”</p>
<p>371</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>684. </b> In the ISC’s view, it was “<b>unfortunate</b>” that the point was removed in the </p>
<p>published version, “<b>and not highlighted elsewhere</b>”. </p>
<p><b>685. </b> The ISC concluded: </p>
<p>“Saddam was not considered a current or imminent threat to mainland UK, nor did </p>
<p>the dossier say so.”</p>
<p>372</p>
<p><b>686. </b> In its response to the ISC, the Government welcomed that conclusion, adding:</p>
<p>“The dossier was not intended to make the case for military action against Iraq; </p>
<p>it was intended to share with the public the intelligence being presented to the </p>
<p>Government which (along with much open source information) showed that Iraq </p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>

<p><b>687. </b> The Government’s response to the ISC addressed a different point to the issue </p>
<p>of whether Iraq, and its weapons of mass destruction, was a “current and serious threat </p>
<p>to the UK national interest” at the time the dossier was issued. </p>
<p><b>688.  The statement that Mr Blair believed Iraq and its weapons of mass </b></p>
<p><b>destruction was “a current and serious threat to the UK national interest” </b></p>
<p><b>reflected his view. </b></p>
<p><b>689.  But it did not reflect the view of the JIC, which had addressed the threat </b></p>
<p><b>posed by Iraq and assessed that Iraq’s capabilities and intentions were limited </b></p>
<p><b>and related to the balance of power in the region and internal challenges.</b></p>
<p><b>690. </b> JIC Assessments between January 2001 and September 2002 did not formally </p>
<p>consider the threat posed by Iraq to UK interests. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> In its Assessment of 1 December 2000, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Although Iraqi forces are still large and well organised by regional standards, </p>
<p>a <b>military offensive outside Iraq’s borders would be limited</b> by shortfalls </p>
<p>in equipment and logistics.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UN sanctions have successfully prevented the procurement of new </p>
<p>weapon systems.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“While <b>US/UK forces remain</b> deployed in the region and prepared to intervene </p>
<p>militarily, <b>an attack on Kuwait is very unlikely</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has probably [disassembled and] concealed a <b>handful of 650km range </b></p>
<p><b>ballistic missiles</b> that could reach Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and even Israel … </p>
<p>But even if Saddam has such weapons he is <b>unlikely to use them</b> except in </p>
<p>extremis, in order to preserve his regime or as a final gesture of defiance.”</p>
<p>374</p>
<p><b>692. </b> The JIC Assessment of 28 November 2001 stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we judge Iraq had no responsibility for, or foreknowledge of, attacks in the </p>
<p>US on 11 September.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Saddam has refused to permit any Al Qaida presence in Iraq</b>. He is </p>
<p>ideologically poles apart from the Sunni extremist networks linked to UBL </p>
<p>[Usama Bin Laden] and fears their impact on the population.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has long seen terrorism as a potential weapon in its conflict with the US </p>
<p>and regional enemies. […] Since September 11, however, <b>Saddam is likely </b></p>
<p><b>to have ruled out such attacks for the time being</b>, for fear of a heavy </p>
<p>US response.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But in the medium term the threat against Western interests and regional states </p>
<p>remains credible. <b>Saddam has not given up terrorism as a policy tool.</b>”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>693. </b> The JIC Assessment of 19 April 2002 stated:</p>
<p>“… Iraq is rarely perceived as the greatest security threat within the region. Except </p>
<p>for Kuwait, the Gulf States see Iran as the greater long-term security threat and want </p>
<p>an Iran-Iraq balance …”</p>
<p>376</p>
<p><b>694. </b> The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 judged that the use of chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons before a military attack on Iraq was “unlikely”.</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>695. </b> The Executive Summary of the dossier stated that intelligence showed:</p>
<p>“… Saddam Hussein attaches great importance to possessing weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction which he regards as the basis for Iraq’s regional power. It shows that </p>
<p>he does not regard them only as weapons of last resort. He is ready to use them, </p>
<p>including against his own population, and is determined to retain them …”</p>
<p>378</p>
<p><b>696. </b> The Executive Summary also stated:</p>
<p>“But the threat from Iraq does not depend solely on the capabilities we have </p>
<p>described. It arises also because of the violent and aggressive nature of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime. His record of internal repression and external aggression gives </p>
<p>rise to unique concerns about the threat he poses. The paper briefly outlines </p>
<p>… Saddam’s rise to power, the nature of his regime and his history of regional </p>
<p>aggression. Saddam’s human rights abuses are also catalogued …”</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>697. </b> Mr Powell explicitly cautioned that, while Iraq had the means, the dossier did </p>
<p>not demonstrate that it posed an imminent threat. In his email to Mr Scarlett on </p>
<p>17 September, Mr Powell wrote that the dossier:</p>
<p>“… does nothing to demonstrate a threat, let alone an imminent threat from Saddam </p>
<p>In other words it shows he has the means but it does not demonstrate he has </p>
<p>the motive to attack his neighbours let alone the west We will need to make clear </p>
<p>in launching the document that we do not claim to have evidence that he is an </p>
<p>imminent threat The case we are making is that he has continued to develop WMD </p>
<p>since 1998, and is in breach of UN resolutions The international community has to </p>
<p>enforce those resolutions if the UN is to be taken seriously”.</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>698. </b> Addressing Mr Powell’s comments about the “imminent threat”, Mr Campbell </p>
<p>replied that was “why TB’s Foreword sets out ‘the case I am making’”.</p>

<p><b>699. </b> In a further email on 18 September, Mr Powell concluded:</p>
<p>“The threat argument will be a major problem in the press/parliamentary assault after </p>
<p>the dossier comes out and we need to flag up the point in the preface at publication </p>
<p>and during the debate. We need to set the test for ourselves at a level we can meet”.</p>

<p>CONTINUED PRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL “WEAPONS”</p>
<p><b>701. </b> Commenting on the statement that Iraq “continued to produce chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons”, the ISC stated:</p>
<p><b>“The use of the phrase … and the absence of detail on amounts of agents </b></p>
<p><b>produced in the executive summary and main text could give the impression </b></p>
<p><b>that Saddam was actively producing both chemical and biological weapons </b></p>
<p><b>and significant amount of agents.”</b></p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>702. </b> The ISC added: </p>
<p><b>“However the JIC did not know what had been produced and in what </b></p>
<p><b>quantities – it had assessed, based on intelligence, that production had taken </b></p>
<p><b>place. We believe this uncertainty should have been highlighted to give a </b></p>
<p><b>balanced view of Saddam’s chemical and biological capacity.” </b></p>
<p><b>703. </b> Asked if the information available in early 2002 showed that Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>WMD programmes had changed very little since 1998, and that there were strong </p>
<p>caveats about the reliability of the intelligence, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Yes, the principal intelligence … in March 2002, was that our knowledge was </p>
<p>‘sporadic’ and ‘patchy’…”</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>704. </b> Mr Blair added that he thought the Assessment went on to say, “but it is clear that </p>
<p>Saddam continues his programme”. </p>
<p><b>705. </b> Asked if it was “wise to say that intelligence is ever beyond doubt”, and if that was </p>
<p>“setting a higher standard of proof than it might be possible to sustain”, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“I think what I said … </p>
<p>‘What I believe the assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt is that </p>
<p>Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons.’</p>
<p>“I did believe it … and I did believe it, frankly, beyond doubt.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>706. </b> Asked whether it was “beyond anybody’s doubt”, Mr Blair stated that the </p>
<p>“March 2002 JIC Assessment”, said: “It was clear that …”</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>707. </b> Mr Blair added: </p>
<p>“… if I said, ‘It was clear that’ in the Foreword, rather than ‘I believe, beyond doubt’, </p>
<p>it would have had the same impact.”</p>
<p><b>708. </b> Mr Blair added that, based on the Executive Summary and the information that </p>
<p>followed in the Iraq dossier, it was “hard to come to any other conclusion than that this </p>
<p>person [Saddam Hussein] has a continuing WMD programme”. Mr Blair could not “see </p>
<p>how anyone could come to a different conclusion”.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>709.  The JIC Assessment of 9 September stated that intelligence indicated </b></p>
<p><b>that the production of chemical and biological weapons was taking place and </b></p>
<p><b>the Executive Summary of the dossier stated that the JIC judged that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>continued to produce chemical and biological agents. Neither supported the </b></p>
<p><b>statement that the “assessed intelligence has established beyond doubt” that </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein had “continued to produce chemical and biological weapons”. </b></p>
<p><b>710.  The questions raised by the DIS about the validity of these judgements </b></p>
<p><b>by the JIC are addressed earlier in this Section.</b></p>
<p><b>711. </b> The JIC Assessment of 1 December 2000 stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence suggested “some <b>biological </b>and <b>chemical</b> warfare activity”. Iraq </p>
<p>was “rebuilding its civil chemical industry, including facilities formerly associated </p>
<p>with chemical weapons”. The JIC judged that “<b>Iraq may already be producing </b></p>
<p><b>biological agent and could produce a small number of chemical weapons </b></p>
<p><b>within weeks</b> of a decision to do so”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could “build a <b>large scale production capability within a few years</b>” </p>
<p>“were economic sanction lifted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The same was “probably true for <b>biological weapons</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “could produce small but significant amounts of mustard agent within weeks </p>
<p>of a decision to do so. It could produce nerve agent within months … It could </p>
<p>also produce small numbers of CW munitions and missile warheads.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq still had “sufficient expertise and material to produce BW without </p>
<p>procurement from abroad. It could use legitimate civil or dedicated BW facilities, </p>
<p>including mobile laboratories, for this work.”</p>

<p><b>712. </b> The JIC Assessment of 10 May 2001 stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence reports reflected “<b>a continuing chemical warfare programme</b>, </p>
<p>including research and development, together with the possible production and </p>
<p>weaponisation of agent”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “good intelligence of Iraq’s former chemical and biological warfare </p>
<p>(CBW) facilities, their limited reconstruction and civil production”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “good intelligence of Iraq’s former CW associated facilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence of “other related CW activity, including possible weaponisation” was </p>
<p>“less clear”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Whilst the picture as regards biological weapons was unclear,” there were </p>
<p>indications of “continuing biological warfare research and the possible </p>
<p>production of agent”.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>713. </b> The introduction to the CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated:</p>
<p>“<b>Intelligence</b> on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes is <b>sporadic and patchy</b>. Iraq is also well practised in the art of </p>
<p>concealment and exaggeration. A complete picture of various programmes is </p>
<p>therefore difficult. But it is clear that Iraq continues to pursue a policy of acquiring </p>
<p>WMD and their delivery means. Intelligence indicates that planning to reconstitute </p>
<p>some of its programmes began in 1995. WMD programmes were then given a </p>
<p>further boost in 1998 with the withdrawal of UNSCOM inspectors.”</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>714. </b> On detailed points, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We continue to judge that Iraq has an offensive <b>chemical warfare (CW) </b></p>
<p><b>programme</b>, although there is very little intelligence relating to it.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“From the evidence available … we believe Iraq retains some production </p>
<p>equipment, and some small stocks of CW agent precursors, and may </p>
<p>have hidden small quantities of agents and weapons. <b>Anomalies in Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>declarations to UNSCOM</b> suggest stocks could be much larger.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on production facilities was “scarce” and “the reconstructed former </p>
<p>precursor facility near Habbaniyah” was “insufficient to support large-scale CW </p>
<p>agent production”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Other industrial chemical facilities could be used … but we have no intelligence </p>
<p>to suggest they are currently being used in that role.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence has indicated an Iraqi interest in transportable production facilities </p>
<p>for chemical weapons, but these could produce only small amounts of agent and </p>
<p>we judge it more likely that the mobile units are filling munitions”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “one uncorroborated report” that Iraq had “filled some artillery </p>
<p>rocket munitions with VX in the period 1996-1998, and another that a team of </p>
<p>chemists was formed in 1998 to produce 5 tons of VX. The source was told this </p>
<p>had been completed by the end of 1998”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work on biological warfare programmes had “continued throughout the period </p>
<p>of UNSCOM inspections” and intelligence indicated “that this programme </p>
<p>continues. Key figures from the pre-Gulf War programme are reported to be </p>
<p>involved.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Research and development was “assessed to continue under cover of a number </p>
<p>of legitimate institutes and possibly in a number of covert facilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no intelligence on any BW agent production facilities, but one </p>
<p>source indicates that Iraq may have developed <b>mobile production facilities</b>”. </p>
<p>The Assessment stated: “Though not corroborated, we judge the reporting is </p>
<p>technically credible. Imagery has yet to provide firm collateral but has identified </p>
<p>a number of sites that could be associated with this programme. The mobile </p>
<p>production facilities have yet to be identified.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CIG did not know “which types of agent are produced by these facilities”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A decision to begin CBW production would probably go undetected.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “judged to be self-sufficient in the production of biological weapons”.</p>
<p><b>715. </b> In the Key Judgements, the CIG stated that, while research and development </p>
<p>programmes continued, Iraq’s actual capabilities were finite. There was no intelligence </p>
<p>on the production of chemical and biological agents or weapons. </p>
<p><b>716. </b> The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 judged that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared </p>
<p>to use it.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq currently has available, either from pre Gulf War stocks or more recent </p>
<p>production, a number of biological warfare (BW) and chemical warfare (CW) </p>
<p>agents and weapons …”</p>
<p>391</p>
<p><b>717. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“One intelligence report suggests that Iraq has ‘lost’ the capability to develop </p>
<p>warheads capable of disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it </p>
<p>would take six months to overcome the ‘technical difficulties’”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>…”</p>
<p><b>719. </b> The Executive Summary of the dossier stated:</p>

<p><b>720. </b> The main text of the dossier stated:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Asked whether Mr Blair’s knowledge of the SIS reporting, of 11 September, could </p>
<p>have influenced Mr Blair, Sir Richard Dearlove replied:</p>
<p>“… if you look at what he … actually says ‘beyond doubt on the assessed </p>
<p>intelligence’, this isn’t part of the assessed intelligence.”</p>
<p>398</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IRAQ’S EFFORTS TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONS</p>
<p><b>722. </b> The ISC also considered the statement that Mr Blair believed “the assessed </p>
<p>intelligence has established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein “continues in his </p>
<p>efforts to develop nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p>399</p>
<p><b>723. </b> The ISC pointed out that the Executive Summary and main body of the dossier </p>
<p>were less certain:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Executive Summary stated: “As a result of the intelligence, we judge Iraq </p>
<p>has … sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier itself stated that there was “intelligence that Iraq has sought the </p>
<p>supply of significant quantities of uranium from Africa”.</p>
<p><b>724.  Although there were some references to Iraq having a “nuclear programme”, </b></p>
<p><b>the JIC Assessments and the dossier made clear that Iraq’s efforts to develop a </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear weapon were effectively constrained by the dismantling of its physical </b></p>
<p><b>infrastructure by the IAEA and continuing sanctions. </b></p>
<p><b>725.  There was intelligence which indicated: attempts to procure dual-use </b></p>
<p><b>equipment which could be used in a nuclear programme; possible attempts to </b></p>
<p><b>obtain uranium; and that Iraq had retained the knowledge and personnel from </b></p>
<p><b>its previous programme. </b></p>
<p><b>726.  But neither the JIC Assessments at the time nor the judgements in the </b></p>
<p><b>Executive Summary of the dossier supported the statement that the “assessed </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence has established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein “continues </b></p>
<p><b>in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons”. </b></p>
<p><b>727. </b> The JIC Assessment of 1 December 2000 stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “retained the scientific cadre associated with nuclear weapons work </p>
<p>[…] Unconfirmed intelligence indicates <b>Iraqi interest in acquiring uranium and </b></p>
<p><b>continuing nuclear weapons related research after the Gulf War</b>. None of </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>If it were “able to acquire sufficient fissile [material] for a weapon or centrifuges </p>
<p>and feed material from outside Iraq”, the time periods to manufacture a crude </p>
<p>nuclear weapon and a nuclear warhead could, “with foreign assistance”, be </p>
<p>“significantly shortened”.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p><b>728. </b> The JIC Assessment of 10 May 2001 stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “<b>no clear intelligence on Iraq’s nuclear programme”</b>. There was </p>
<p>“evidence of increased activity at Iraq’s only remaining nuclear facility and a </p>
<p>growing number of reports on <b>possible nuclear related procurement”</b>. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged but could not confirm that Iraq was “conducting <b>nuclear related </b></p>
<p><b>research and development</b> into the <b>enrichment of uranium</b> and could have </p>
<p>longer term plans to produce enriched uranium for a weapon”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “recalled its nuclear scientists in 1998”. It had made “efforts … since </p>
<p>1998 to procure items that could be used in a uranium enrichment programme </p>
<p>using centrifuges”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those included: “<b>aluminium</b> [tubes]” and “<b>other dual-use items”</b>.</p>
<p>401</p>
<p><b>729. </b> The introductory paragraph in the CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated that </p>
<p>sanctions were constraining programmes to develop medium and long-range ballistic </p>
<p>missiles and nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq is pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. But it will not be able to </p>
<p>indigenously produce a nuclear weapon while sanctions remain in place, unless </p>
<p>suitable fissile material is purchased from abroad.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq does not possess a nuclear weapons capability. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Its programme was effectively dismantled by the IAEA. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although there was “very little intelligence”, the CIG continued to judge that </p>
<p>Iraq was “pursuing a nuclear weapons programme” which was assessed to be </p>
<p>“based on gas centrifuge <b>uranium enrichment</b> … the route Iraq was following </p>
<p>for producing fissile material prior to the Gulf War”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Recent intelligence” indicated that “nuclear scientists were recalled to work on </p>
<p>a nuclear programme in the autumn of 1998, but we do not know if large-scale </p>
<p>development work has yet recommenced”. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The CIG continued to judge that:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“[I]f sanctions were removed or became ineffective, it would take at least </p>
<p>five years to produce a nuclear weapon. This timescale would shorten if </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Iraq “was capable of producing an <b>improvised nuclear device</b>, but </p>
<p>it lacks suitable fissile material. Iraq has in the past explored the use </p>
<p>of <b>radiological dispersal devices</b>, but the design we have seen was </p>
<p>not a credible weapon. There is no intelligence that Iraq is interested </p>
<p>in such devices.”</p>
<p><b>730. </b> The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 did not address Iraq’s nuclear </p>

<p>“Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons in breach of its </p>

<p>While the IAEA had called into question documentary evidence it had received in </p>

<p>that it had been told that this “did not affect” SIS’ judgement of its second source and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>739. </b> The Butler Report also stated that there was separate intelligence that the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime had made enquiries about the purchase of uranium ore from the </p>
<p>Democratic Republic of Congo and that there was some evidence that by 2002 </p>
<p>a sale had been agreed.</p>

<p>LONGER-RANGE MISSILE SYSTEMS</p>
<p><b>740.  In the Foreword to the dossier, Mr Blair also stated that he believed the </b></p>
<p><b>assessed intelligence had “established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>had “been able to extend the range of his ballistic missile programme”.</b></p>
<p><b>413</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>741. </b> One of the Key Judgements of the JIC Assessment of 10 May 2001 stated that </p>
<p>there had been “<b>a step change in progress</b>” in Iraq’s ballistic missile programme over </p>
<p>the preceding two years.</p>
<p>414</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>742. </b> The Assessment itself made clear that the change related to work on </p>
<p>development and infrastructure, including work on a “<b>test stand with the capacity for </b></p>
<p><b>much larger engines than the Al Samoud</b>”, rather than production of missiles with </p>
<p>ranges beyond the 150km permitted by the UN. It also stated that if Iraq developed short </p>
<p>range missiles with a range “well beyond” 150km, that would “represent <b>a step change </b></p>
<p><b>in Saddam Hussein’s military capabilities</b>”. </p>
<p><b>743. </b> A Key Judgement in the CIG Assessment of 15 March 2002 stated that Iraq </p>
<p>had retained “<b>up to 20 Al Hussein ballistic missiles</b>” with a range of 650km.</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The “location and condition” of those missiles was “unknown”, although Iraq had </p>
<p>“sufficient engineering expertise to make them operational”. </p>
<p><b>744. </b> A further Key Judgement in the 15 March CIG Assessment stated that Iraq had </p>
<p>“begun development of <b>medium range ballistic missiles </b>[with a range of]<b> over </b></p>
<p><b>1000km</b> that could target countries throughout the Middle East and Gulf region”, but </p>
<p>Iraq would “<b>not be able to produce such a missile before 2007</b> provided sanctions </p>
<p>remain effective”. The Assessment itself stated that “<b>UN sanctions and the work of </b></p>
<p><b>the inspectors</b>” had “caused significant problems for Iraq’s missile industry”. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> The 15 March CIG Assessment also stated that there were reports that Iraq had </p>
<p>“succeeded in developing a number of 200km range variants” of the liquid propelled </p>
<p>Al Samoud missile, but it was “unclear” whether those were for operational use or for </p>
<p>the research and development of a longer-range missile. </p>

<p>259</p>
<p><b>746. </b> The CIG judged that the Ababil-100, a 150km range solid propellant missile, was </p>
<p>likely to become operational within two years, and intelligence indicated that Iraq had </p>
<p>plans to extend its range.</p>
<p><b>747. </b> The JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002 stated that Iraq was developing </p>
<p>Al Samoud and Ababil-100 missiles with a range of “150km plus”, which were being </p>
<p>deployed to military units and could have “an emergency operational capability with </p>
<p>conventional warheads”, not a capability to deliver chemical or biological warheads.</p>

<p><b>749.  The JIC should have advised Mr Blair that he could not make that </b></p>
<p><b>statement.</b></p>
<p><b>750. </b> Asked about Mr Blair’s statement that he believed “the assessed intelligence has </p>
<p>established beyond doubt” that Iraq has continued to produce chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons, continues in its efforts to develop nuclear weapons, and had been able to </p>
<p>extend the range of its ballistic missile programme, Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that he:</p>
<p>“… saw the … Foreword as something quite separate from the text of the dossier </p>
<p>itself. The text of the dossier itself I was clearly responsible for drafting. </p>
<p>“The Foreword was overtly a political statement signed by the Prime Minister. So it </p>
<p>was his wording and his comments that were there throughout, although I did make </p>
<p>one or two, three maybe, small changes on the text of the Foreword, basically to </p>
<p>correct one or two small points, which I thought were – or actually add at one point </p>
<p>in particular about who received intelligence assessments in the first paragraph, and </p>
<p>also to bring it into line with the text of the dossier itself. </p>
<p>“There was a particular point on concealment. I didn’t see it as something that I </p>
<p>would change. That’s all I can recall now … it is quite difficult now to reconstruct the </p>
<p>actual sort of process of how this happened several years later … [B]ut my memory </p>
<p>at the time quite clearly was this was something which was the Prime Minister’s and </p>
<p>it was going out under his signature. So it was different from the attention that I paid </p>
<p>to the wording of the dossier.”</p>

<p><b>751. </b> Asked whether, given that Mr Blair’s Foreword provided an interpretation of the </p>
<p>evidence in the dossier and other interpretations could have been made of the same </p>
<p>evidence, the interpretation and assessment should have been issued in separate </p>
<p>documents, Sir John Scarlett replied:</p>
<p>“Maybe, yes. But I can’t honestly say that that point was in my mind and I was </p>
<p>focused on that issue or that risk at the time. If I had been, then I would have </p>
<p>expressed a thought.”</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>752. </b> Sir David Omand, who had taken up his post as the Security and Intelligence </p>
<p>Co-ordinator on 3 September 2002, told the Inquiry that his memory was that he “didn’t </p>

<p>419</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>753. </b> Asked whether the phrase “beyond doubt” had rung any “alarm bells”, Sir David </p>
<p>replied that he had:</p>
<p>“… totally failed to spot the potential problem that would arise through the disjunction </p>
<p>between the statement of case being directly associated with the text of the dossier. </p>
<p>We [the JIC] were commenting on this as a document the Prime Minister was going </p>

<p>261</p>
<p><b>756.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 23 September that the dossier “would show that the </b></p>
<p><b>policy of containment had worked up to a point” but Saddam Hussein “continued </b></p>
<p><b>to rebuild” his weapons of mass destruction.</b></p>
<p><b>757. </b> Cabinet met at 5pm on 23 September. The discussion is addressed in Section 3.5. </p>
<p><b>758. </b> Cabinet members were given a copy of the dossier to be published the </p>
<p>following day.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> In relation to the dossier, Mr Blair told his colleagues:</p>
<p>“… the dossier on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction would show that the policy </p>
<p>of containment had worked up to a point, but that Saddam Hussein … continued </p>
<p>to rebuild his programme to acquire such weapons. The evidence showed his efforts </p>
<p>to procure equipment and materials, and to restore production facilities. This was </p>
<p>an issue for the United Nations, with whose Security Council resolutions Iraq had </p>
<p>not complied. A new resolution was being negotiated.”</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>760. </b> No specific discussion of the contents of the dossier was recorded although in the </p>
<p>discussion the point was made that the “development of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>by Saddam Hussein presented a quite different order of threat”.</p>
<p><b>761. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that a “crunch point” had been reached:</p>
<p>“The sanctions regime … was being eroded and Saddam Hussein was on the way </p>
<p>to acquiring new capability in weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had to comply with </p>
<p>the obligations placed on it by the United Nations …”</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had explained that the dossier “brought together </p>
<p>accumulated evidence about Iraq’s attempts to build WMD, part historical, part </p>
<p>intelligence-based”; “not saying that he [Saddam Hussein] was about to launch an attack </p>
<p>on London, but we were saying there was an attempt to build a WMD programme in a </p>
<p>significant way”.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p><b>763. </b> Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from September 2002 to September 2005, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think the dossier was ostensibly an attempt to inform the public. But one of the </p>
<p>effects it had was that the Cabinet all read it and basically decided – they absorbed </p>
<p>it and accepted it.”</p>

<p><b>764. </b> Asked whether there had been a debate about different scenarios and different </p>
<p>possible courses, Lord Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“… there was certainly a discussion around different scenarios that came up in the </p>
<p>way in which we addressed these issues in Cabinet …</p>
<p>“… in the September meeting, where, as you know, we were about to publish the </p>
<p>dossier, there was about to be a report to Parliament and there was a discussion </p>
<p>around that and it was a full discussion and, in the course of that, colleagues made </p>
<p>various contributions and various scenarios surfaced … </p>
<p>“What we did have was a full discussion around the issues as they were reported </p>
<p>to us …”</p>
<p>425</p>
<p><b>765. </b> Addressing the September 2002 dossier on Iraq in his memoir, written after </p>
<p>his resignation from the Government, Mr Robin Cook, the Leader of the House </p>
<p>Commons, wrote:</p>
<p>“At Cabinet [on 24 September 2002] I described the dossier as ‘derivative’. What I </p>
<p>was expressing was the extraordinary degree to which the bulk of the document was </p>
<p>derived from what we know about Saddam’s arsenal … as it had been in 1991 … </p>
<p>What was doubtful was whether the arsenal that Saddam possessed in 1991 was </p>
<p>any guide whatsoever to the state of his capacity in 2002.</p>
<p>“For a start most chemical and biological agents that Saddam had retained for </p>
<p>a decade would long ago have degenerated to the point that they were of no </p>
<p>operational use. This is a principle of science well known to those who wrote the </p>
<p>dossier … Government Ministers alarmed the public by claims that Saddam had ten </p>
<p>thousand litres of anthrax solution unaccounted for since 1991. They never added </p>
<p>that the standard life of liquid anthrax is three years …</p>
<p>“… Last year the US Department of Defense … revealed, ‘When the Iraqis produced </p>
<p>chemical munitions they appeared to adhere to a ‘make and use’ regimen … Their </p>
<p>conclusion was that the shelf life of Iraqi chemical agents was numbered in weeks, </p>
<p>not decades.</p>
<p>“Half of the text relating to Iraq’s weapons capacity is drawn from the period before </p>
<p>1998. Much of the remainder depends for its claims of present capacity on historic </p>
<p>capabilities … Stripped of the historical resume … the dossier is very thin on new </p>
<p>evidence on the current position.”</p>

<p><b>766. </b> Mr Cook subsequently wrote:</p>
<p>“The dossier … painted a one-sided picture … [I]t defiantly proclaimed a certitude for </p>
<p>its claims that was at odds with the nuanced tone of every JIC Assessment I read.”</p>
<p><b>767. </b> Mr Cook added:</p>
<p>“Personally I never doubted that No.10 believed in the threads of intelligence </p>
<p>which were woven into the dossier. But that does not alter the awkward fact that </p>
<p>the intelligence was wrong and Ministers who had applied a sceptical mind could </p>
<p>have seen that it was too thin to be a reliable base for war. No.10 believed in the </p>
<p>intelligence because they desperately wanted it to be true. Their sin was not one </p>
<p>of bad faith but of evangelical certainty. They selected for inclusion only the scraps </p>
<p>of intelligence that fitted the Government’s case. And gave them a harder edge </p>
<p>than was justifiable. The net result was a gross distortion. Although every individual </p>
<p>claim could be sourced … the overall effect was to present a false picture of an Iraq </p>
<p>bristling with real weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist.”</p>
<p><b>768. </b> In a section reflecting on the issues written after the conflict, Mr Cook wrote:</p>
<p>“Only in the last five days was the word Programme dropped from the title. </p>
<p>The clear implication is that No.10 wanted Parliament and public to believe that Iraq </p>
<p>had actual weapons …”</p>
<p><b>769. </b> In Mr Cook’s view:</p>
<p>“… the most egregious claim of all was that Saddam had attempted to reconstitute </p>
<p>his nuclear programme … The conclusion of the section on nuclear weapons is a </p>
<p>masterpiece of false suggestion.”</p>
<p><b>770. </b> Mr Cook described the section in the dossier addressing what Iraq might be able </p>
<p>to do if it obtained fissile material and other essential components as “a fanciful leap </p>
<p>into the realm of fantasy”: “This language is frightening. But as evidence that Iraq was a </p>
<p>threat it is pathetic and the authors must have known it.”</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s statement to Parliament, 24 September 2002</b></p>

<p>subsequent debates on Iraq in both Houses of Parliament, are addressed in Section 3.5.</p>
<p><b>776. </b> In relation to Iraq’s WMD capabilities and intent, Mr Blair’s statement drew on the </p>
<p>dossier, including Mr Blair’s Foreword, the material sent to No.10 by the FCO on 2 and </p>
<p>4 September, and subsequent briefing material produced for the debate. </p>
<p><b>777. </b> Mr Rycroft sent a framework for the statement to Mr Blair, together with </p>
<p>background material, on 20 September.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>778. </b> The framework comprised six sections:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The response</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Conclusion.</p>
<p><b>779. </b> In relation to the threat, Mr Rycroft suggested:</p>
<p>“Summarise the dossier: main focus WMD, but also material on the nature </p>
<p>of Saddam’s regime. History of the inspectors and UNSCRs …”</p>
<p><b>780. </b> In the section on the response to the threat, Mr Rycroft set out the framework </p>
<p>of the UN route and that Iraq should comply with all the UN’s demands; and that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had:</p>
<p>“… a long history of claiming to offer unconditional access, but then attaching </p>
<p>conditions … </p>
<p>“For instance, the Iraqi Foreign Minister told the UN last week that Iraq is ‘clear of all </p>
<p>nuclear, chemical and biological weapons’. That is a lie. The dossier explains why.”</p>
<p><b>781. </b> Addressing the question “Why now?”, Mr Rycroft wrote:</p>
<p>“Dossier sets out the threat. It is increasing every year, especially with Saddam’s </p>
<p>illicit money. Would be unconscionable to be aware of the threat and do nothing.”</p>

<p><b>782. </b> Addressing the question “Why Saddam?”, Mr Rycroft wrote:</p>
<p>“Need to tackle WMD around the world. Have different strategies for N Korea, Libya </p>
<p>etc. With these countries there are at least … some ways of dealing diplomatically </p>
<p>with them. Not possible with Saddam’s Iraq. Only Saddam has (a) record of WMD </p>
<p>use, (b) violated so many UN obligations.”</p>
<p><b>783. </b> Mr Rycroft also wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The country [Iraq], region and world would be better off without Saddam, but the </p>
<p>issue is his WMD. He must disarm …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was: “No known link between Saddam and Al Qaida. Terrorism is not the </p>
<p>issue – WMD is.” </p>
<p><b>784. </b> The background documents included a FCO letter providing material to answer </p>
<p>points made in the debate.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> In relation to Iraq’s possession of WMD and the risk of </p>
<p>proliferation, the brief on military action stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… as dossier clearly sets out, Iraqi regime has accelerated its weapons </p>
<p>programmes since departure of inspectors. Saddam should be in no doubt about </p>
<p>our determination to remove the threat of his WMD.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What singles out Iraq as a proliferator is Saddam’s demonstrated willingness to </p>
<p>use WMD and wage war against his neighbours. Naive to suppose that we could </p>
<p>persuade Saddam through dialogue to give up his weapons …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In cases of other proliferators [Iran, North Korea and Libya], we have tried </p>
<p>to address our concerns through dialogue … even though some people have </p>
<p>criticised us for this.” </p>
<p><b>785. </b> The detailed briefing on WMD stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and was “still hiding” them “in </p>
<p>a range of locations”. The regime had admitted “hiding chemical, biological </p>
<p>weapons and missile parts”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK believed Iraq had “the capability to deliver these weapons to a range </p>
<p>of locations”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “admitted producing large quantities of chemical warfare agents” and </p>
<p>“producing biological warfare agents”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN weapons inspectors had been “unable to account for thousands of tonnes </p>
<p>of so-called precursor chemicals used in the production of weapons; hundreds </p>
<p>of tonnes of precursor chemicals used in the production of VX nerve agent; </p>
<p>and tens of thousands of special munitions which can be used in chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons”.</p>

<p>biological programmes”.</p>
<p><b>787. </b> The detailed text was more nuanced, stating:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We believe that Iraq has recently accelerated its weapons programme.”</p>

<p>There had been “continued progress” on the ballistic missile programme, and </p>

<p>“… played a vital role in frustrating Saddam’s ambitions to develop WMD. UNSCOM </p>
<p>and IAEA inspectors … And UN controls on Iraq imports have made it more difficult </p>
<p>for Iraq to acquire easily the WMD technology it is seeking.”</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Sanctions had “helped make Iraqi acquisition of WMD and the means to deliver </p>
<p>them more difficult” and had “undoubtedly slowed the pace of their reconstitution”. But </p>
<p>there were “always those who are willing to breach sanctions” and “Some equipment” </p>
<p>had “reached Iraq’s WMD programmes”.</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Mr Blair was also sent a copy of the Question and Answer briefing to accompany </p>
<p>the dossier.</p>

<p> Key points of interest included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The dossier shows that Saddam has aggressively pursued his WMD </p>
<p>programme. In the four years since the departure of the inspectors things have </p>
<p>got worse, not better. It would be irresponsible to ignore those facts.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq possessed WMD: it was “still hiding weapons of mass destruction in a range </p>
<p>of locations” and it had “admitted producing large quantities of chemical warfare </p>
<p>agents”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “reliable intelligence” on mobile production facilities for biological </p>
<p>warfare agents which supported “older reporting from defectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “intelligence relating to continued production” of CBW agents.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>If it could “buy highly enriched uranium and essential components”, Iraq might </p>
<p>“be able to make a crude nuclear weapon in between one and two years”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To deliver a nuclear warhead by ballistic missile, “Iraq would need a more </p>
<p>sophisticated design for a missile warhead than any it had before 1991. It could </p>
<p>well have done significant research on this while the inspectors have been away, </p>
<p>and may have even produced some parts in anticipation. With the acquired </p>
<p>fissile material and specialised parts, a warhead could be made for a missile in </p>
<p>about two years, but may well fail. Further time would allow the weapon to be </p>
<p>developed and tested to improve its reliability.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has admitted in the past making chemical and biological warheads for its </p>
<p>Al Hussein missiles. We believe they could do so again.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “the capability to have developed” chemical and biological warheads </p>
<p>for other types of missiles.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier focused “on the threat posed by Iraq’s WMD programmes”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence that Iraq has supplied WMD materials or advice to any </p>
<p>terrorist organisation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida was “probably still trying” to develop a WMD capability: “It would benefit </p>
<p>greatly from support from a state programme. Allowing WMD to remain in the </p>
<p>hands of a regime such as Saddam’s must involve the risk that these weapons </p>
<p>will find there [sic] way into the hands of terrorists.”</p>
<p><b>791. </b> Addressing whether there were differences between the US and UK assessments, </p>
<p>the briefing stated:</p>
<p>“It is clear that the British and American Governments are in full agreement that </p>
<p>Saddam’s WMD programmes remains significant and growing. We are also in </p>
<p>full agreement that the international community must take action. Should not </p>
<p>be surprised if different analysts using information obtained in different ways at </p>
<p>different times come to slightly different technical conclusions – but the fundamental </p>
<p>judgements are identical.” </p>
<p><b>792. </b> Addressing whether the UK’s Iraq policy had created a climate for terrorism, the </p>

<p>432</p>
<p> was described as “extraordinary”.</p>
<p>433</p>
<p> The briefing also stated:</p>
<p>“Saddam has accelerated his efforts to develop a biological, chemical and nuclear </p>
<p>weapons capability since the expulsion of weapons inspectors in 1998, and the </p>
<p>means to deliver them. He is a uniquely dangerous dictator: the only one to have </p>

<p><b>795. </b> Commenting on the preparation of a core script for use when the dossier was </p>
<p>published, Mr Tom Kelly wrote that the “weakness, obviously, is our inability to say </p>
<p>that he could pull the nuclear trigger anytime soon”.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> He thought the basic message, </p>
<p>that “by then it would be too late”, dealt with that point.</p>
<p><b>796. </b> Mr Kelly subsequently wrote:</p>
<p>“We should use the full authority of the House to underline the basic message this </p>

<p><b>799. </b> Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the most important thing was I was very careful in my statement [to Parliament] </p>

<p>438</p>
<p><b>800. </b> Asked if there was anything in his statement to Parliament he wanted to </p>
<p>emphasise, Mr Blair told the Hutton Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think the only thing … is just to emphasise the fact that I make it clear what </p>
<p>I perceived the threat to be.”</p>
<p>439</p>
<p><b>801. </b> Mr Blair also said:</p>
<p>“… it was essential that anything we said in the course of my statement … we could </p>
<p>hand on heart say: this is the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee.”</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>802. </b> The Iraq Inquiry asked Mr Blair for a statement on who had been involved in the </p>
<p>preparation of his statement, and who had cleared the intelligence it contained.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p><b>803. </b> Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“In respect of my statement of 24 September 2002 to the House of Commons </p>
<p>I would have relied principally on the dossier and JIC Assessments and written </p>

<p>particular the [9] September JIC Assessment which referred to mobile facilities.”</p>
<p>442</p>
<p><b>804. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“I have gone back, in the course of compiling this statement, to the vast number of </p>
<p>different documents that refer to Saddam and WMD. I simply make the point that </p>
<p>the assumptions in all of them was that Saddam was committed in both the intent </p>
<p>and the action in developing WMD. Of course, the Iraq Survey Group shows that </p>
<p>the intent indeed remained and there were multiple breaches of UN resolutions.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>806. </b> Addressing the problems encountered by the inspectors, Mr Blair placed the issues </p>
<p>being addressed firmly in the context of: </p>
<p>“… an 11-year history … of UN will flouted, of lies told by Saddam about the </p>
<p>existence of his chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and of obstruction, </p>
<p>defiance and denial.</p>
<p>“There is one common, consistent theme … the total determination of Saddam </p>
<p>to maintain that programme; to risk war, international ostracism, sanctions and </p>
<p>the isolation of the Iraqi economy …” </p>
<p><b>807. </b> Addressing the question of why Saddam Hussein had decided in mid-September, </p>
<p>but not before, to admit the weapons inspectors, Mr Blair stated the answer was in the </p>
<p>dossier, and it was because:</p>
<p>“… his chemical, biological and nuclear programme is not an historic left-over from </p>
<p>1998. The inspectors are not needed to clean up the old remains. His weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction programme is active detailed and growing. The policy of </p>
<p>containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not </p>
<p>shut down; it is up and running now.”</p>
<p><b>808. </b> Mr Blair stated that the dossier disclosing the intelligence assessments provided </p>
<p>by the JIC had been produced because it was “important to explain our concerns about </p>
<p>Saddam to the British people”. He added that people were going to:</p>
<p>“… have to take elements of this on the good faith of our intelligence services, but </p>
<p>this is what they are telling me … and my senior colleagues. The intelligence picture </p>
<p>that they paint is one accumulated over the last four years. It is extensive, detailed </p>
<p>and authoritative. </p>
<p>“It concludes Iraq has chemical and biological weapons, that Saddam has continued </p>
<p>to produce them, that he has existing and active plans for the use of chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons, which could be activated within 45 minutes, including against </p>
<p>his own Shia population, and that he is actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons </p>
<p>capability.”</p>
<p><b>809. </b> Addressing the content of the dossier, Mr Blair told Parliament that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As well as the chemical agents and precursor chemicals, growth media for </p>
<p>anthrax and special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents </p>
<p>that were “missing and unaccounted for” in 1998, Iraq continued “to produce </p>
<p>chemical weapons; has rebuilt previously destroyed production plants across </p>
<p>Iraq; has brought dual-use chemical facilities; has retained key personnel … </p>
<p>and has a serious ongoing research programme into weapons production, all </p>
<p>of it well funded”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… production of biological agents has continued; facilities formerly used for </p>
<p>biological agents have been rebuilt; equipment has been purchased for such a </p>
<p>programme; and again Saddam has retained the personnel who worked on it </p>
<p>prior to 1991. In particular, the UN inspection regime discovered that Iraq was </p>
<p>trying to acquire mobile biological weapons facilities … Present intelligence </p>
<p>confirms that it has now got such facilities.” The UK believed Iraq could produce </p>
<p>anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin, which “all eventually result in </p>
<p>excruciatingly painful death”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s previous nuclear programme had been “shut down by </p>
<p>the inspectors” and “known remaining stocks of uranium” were “held under </p>
<p>supervision” by the IAEA. Key personnel who used to work on the nuclear </p>
<p>weapons programme were “back in harness”. “But we now know” that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein has also:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“bought or attempted to buy” items that could have a use in a nuclear </p>
<p>programme; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“been trying to buy significant quantities of uranium from Africa, although </p>
<p>we do not know whether he has been successful”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s ballistic missile programme was required for the delivery of its chemical, </p>
<p>biological and nuclear weapons. It was “clear that a significant number of </p>
<p>longer-range missiles were effectively concealed from the previous inspectors </p>
<p>and remain, including up to 20 extended-range SCUD missiles … and, by this </p>
<p>year, Iraq’s development of weapons with a range of more than 1,000km was </p>
<p>well under way; and that hundreds of people are employed in that programme, </p>
<p>facilities are being built and equipment procured – usually clandestinely. </p>
<p>Sanctions and import controls have hindered the programme, but only slowed </p>
<p>its progress. The capability being developed, incidentally, is for multi-purpose </p>
<p>use, including with WMD warheads.” </p>
<p><b>810. </b> Mr Blair stated: </p>
<p>“That is the assessment, given to me, of the Joint Intelligence Committee. In </p>
<p>addition, we have well founded intelligence to tell us that Saddam sees his WMD </p>
<p>programme as vital to his survival and as a demonstration of his power and influence </p>
<p>in the region.”</p>
<p><b>811. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“There will be some who dismiss all this. Intelligence is not always right. For some </p>
<p>of the material, there might be innocent explanations. There will be others who say </p>
<p>rightly that … it could be several years before Saddam acquires a usable nuclear </p>
<p>weapon – though if he were able to purchase fissile material … it would be only </p>
<p>a year or two.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>812. </b> In the light of the information he had set out, Mr Blair asked whether the world </p>
<p>would be wise to trust to the “good faith of the current Iraqi regime”. Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Our case is simply this: not that we take military action come what may, but </p>
<p>that the case for ensuring Iraqi disarmament, as the UN itself has stipulated, </p>
<p>is overwhelming. I defy anyone, on the basis of this evidence, to say that that </p>
<p>is an unreasonable demand for the international community to make when, after </p>
<p>all, it is only the same demand that we have made for 11 years and that Saddam </p>
<p>has rejected.”</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Mr Blair posed, and addressed, three questions: ‘Why Saddam?’; ‘Why now?’; </p>
<p>and ‘Why should Britain care?’.</p>
<p><b>814. </b> On the question ‘Why Saddam?’, Mr Blair said two things about Saddam stood </p>
<p>out: “He had used these weapons in Iraq” and thousands had died, and he had used </p>
<p>them during the war with Iran “in which one million people died”; and the regime had </p>
<p>“no moderate elements to appeal to”.</p>
<p><b>815. </b> On the question ‘Why now?’, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I agree that I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam </p>
<p>will use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made </p>
<p>the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs </p>
<p>its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a </p>
<p>weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act, </p>
<p>will use diplomacy but not force. We know, again from our history, that diplomacy </p>
<p>not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will.</p>
<p>“If we take this course and if we refuse to implement the will of the international </p>
<p>community, Saddam will carry on, his efforts will intensify, his confidence will grow </p>
<p>and, at some point in the future not too distant, the threat will turn into reality. </p>
<p>The threat therefore is not imagined. The history of Saddam and weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction is not American or British propaganda. The history and the present threat </p>
<p>are real.”</p>
<p><b>816. </b> Mr Blair said that Britain should care:</p>
<p>“‘Because there is no way this man, in this region … could begin a conflict using </p>
<p>such weapons and the consequences not engulf the whole world, including this </p>
<p>country.’ That … is the reason the UN passed its resolutions. That is why it is right </p>
<p>that the UN Security Council again makes its will and its unity clear and lays down a </p>
<p>strong new UN resolution and mandate. Then Saddam will have the choice: comply </p>
<p>willingly or be forced to comply. That is why alongside the diplomacy, there must be </p>
<p>genuine preparedness and planning to take action if diplomacy fails.</p>
<p>“Let me be plain about our purpose. Of course there is no doubt that Iraq, the region </p>
<p>and the whole world would be better off without Saddam. Iraq deserves to be led by </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>someone who can abide by international law, not a murderous dictator; by someone </p>
<p>who can bring Iraq back into the international community where it belongs, not … </p>
<p>languishing as a pariah; by someone who can make the country rich and successful, </p>
<p>not impoverished by Saddam’s personal greed; and by someone who can lead </p>
<p>a government more representative of the country as a whole while maintaining </p>
<p>absolutely Iraq’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>“We have no quarrel; with the Iraqi people. Indeed, liberated from Saddam they </p>
<p>could make Iraq prosperous and a force for good in the Middle East. So the </p>
<p>ending of this regime would be the cause of regret for no one other than Saddam. </p>
<p>But our purpose is disarmament. No one wants military conflict. The whole purpose </p>
<p>of putting this before the UN is to demonstrate the united determination of the </p>
<p>international community to resolve this in the way it should have been resolved </p>
<p>years ago: through a proper process of disarmament under the UN. Disarmament </p>
<p>of all weapons of mass destruction is the demand. One way or another it must be </p>
<p>acceded to.” </p>
<p><b>817. </b> Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, said that the “key question” was </p>
<p>whether Saddam Hussein had “the means, the mentality and the motive to pose a </p>
<p>threat to pose a threat to Britain’s national security and the wider international order”. </p>
<p>Mr Duncan Smith concluded that Saddam had the means and mentality. He stated:</p>
<p>“The evidence produced in the Government’s report shows clearly that Iraq is still </p>
<p>pursuing its weapons of mass destruction programme …</p>
<p>“The … dossier confirms that Iraq is self sufficient in biological weapons and </p>
<p>that the Iraqi military is ready to deploy those, and chemical weapons, at some </p>
<p>45 minutes’ notice.”</p>
<p><b>818. </b> Addressing whether Saddam Hussein had the motive to strike against Britain, </p>
<p>Mr Duncan Smith stated:</p>
<p>“… I believe that it is fair to assume that he has …</p>
<p>“The report shows that Saddam has illegally retained up to 20 Al Hussein missiles, </p>
<p>with a range of 650km, capable of carrying the various warheads that he needs, </p>
<p>and that he is also developing new ones.” </p>
<p><b>819. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked: </p>
<p>“Does the Prime Minister truly believe that, on the evidence published today, </p>
<p>a sufficient case has now been made that both clarifies Iraq’s present capacity, </p>
<p>as well as its intent?” </p>
<p><b>820. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“ … yes I do believe the information we published today shows that there is a </p>
<p>continuing chemical and biological weapons programme, and an attempt by </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. That is what I believe, </p>
<p>and that is the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee – and frankly I </p>
<p>prefer its assessment to the assessment of the Iraqi regime, which, let us say, </p>
<p>on the basis of experience, is not one that should carry a lot of credibility.”</p>
<p><b>821. </b> Mr William Hague (Conservative) asked:</p>
<p>“Does the Prime Minister recollect that, in the half-century history of various states </p>
<p>acquiring nuclear capabilities, in almost every case – from the Soviet Union in 1949 </p>
<p>to Pakistan in 1998 – their ability to do so had been greatly underestimated and </p>
<p>understated by intelligence sources at the time? Estimates today of Iraq taking </p>
<p>several years to acquire a nuclear device should be seen in that context … [I]s there </p>
<p>not at least a significant risk of the utter catastrophe of Iraq possessing a nuclear </p>
<p>device without warning, some time in the next couple of years? In that case, does </p>
<p>not the risk of leaving the regime on its course today far outweigh the risk of taking </p>
<p>action quite soon?”</p>
<p><b>822. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“I entirely agree … For the preparation of the dossier we had a real concern not to </p>
<p>exaggerate the intelligence that we had received. For obvious reasons, it is difficult </p>
<p>to reflect the credibility of the information, and we rate the credibility of what we have </p>
<p>very highly. I say no more than that.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… I entirely agree that the danger of inaction … far outweighs the danger of action.”</p>
<p><b>823. </b> Other points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [I]n my judgement, if we do not deal with the proliferation of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and their retention by highly unstable states, often with </p>
<p>dictatorial regimes, then perhaps not this year or next, but in the not too distant </p>
<p>future, that problem will explode on to the consciousness of the world. I believe </p>
<p>that passionately, which is why, whatever the issues in relation to Iraq … it is </p>
<p>important to take a stand now and say that, when we have made determinations </p>

<p>ACCURACY OF THE STATEMENT</p>
<p><b>825.  Mr Blair’s statement about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions included some </b></p>
<p><b>judgements that were additional to those in the dossier.</b></p>
<p><b>826.  Mr Blair’s categorical statement that the intelligence picture painted by the </b></p>
<p><b>JIC over the last four years was “extensive, detailed and authoritative”, was not </b></p>
<p><b>an accurate description of the intelligence underpinning the JIC’s assessments.</b></p>
<p><b>827. </b> There are a number of differences between the draft speech and Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>statement to the House of Commons where points of detail were added or changed, </p>
<p>but its structure and key arguments remained.</p>
<p><b>828. </b> In the statement, Mr Blair emphasised that the information in the dossier </p>
<p>represented the view of the JIC.</p>
<p><b>829. </b> During a debate on Iraq on 22 February 2007, Lord Butler said that Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>statement to Parliament “that the picture painted by our intelligence services was </p>
<p>‘extensive, detailed and authoritative’ … could simply not have been justified by the </p>
<p>material that the intelligence community provided to him.”</p>
<p><b>830. </b> The draft of Mr Blair’s statement on 23 September said that the intelligence </p>
<p>picture was “extensive and detailed”. The words “and authoritative” were added </p>
<p>in the final version; it is not clear who made that change or why.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>831. </b> The JIC Assessments issued since December 1998 could be described as </p>
<p>authoritative. But the gaps and uncertainties in the intelligence which underpinned </p>
<p>them were clearly identified.</p>
<p><b>832. </b> The evidence set out earlier in this Section and in Section 4.1 demonstrates that, </p>
<p>since the departure of the weapons inspectors four years earlier, detailed intelligence </p>
<p>had been received on many aspects of Iraq’s activities, and it was more extensive in </p>
<p>some areas than others. The judgement that the intelligence picture was extensive may </p>
<p>also have been influenced by the reporting which had been issued since the end of </p>
<p>August 2002. </p>
<p><b>833. </b> Mr Blair characterised Iraq’s activities to acquire chemical, biological and nuclear </p>
<p>weapons, and a ballistic missile capability to deliver them, as a “programme” which was </p>
<p>“active, detailed and growing”.</p>
<p><b>834. </b> That statement was in the draft of 23 September, and there is no evidence that </p>
<p>Mr Blair was advised to remove it.</p>
<p><b>835. </b> The claim that Iraq’s WMD programme was “growing” and that it had recently </p>
<p>accelerated appeared in the briefing material produced by the FCO and No.10 at </p>
<p>that time. </p>
<p><b>836. </b> Asked whether the JIC Assessments had said that the WMD threat from Iraq was </p>
<p>growing, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Yes, it was telling me that in two respects … </p>
<p>“First … there were the September JIC assessments that talked of continuing </p>
<p>production of chemical weapons. In other words, this was a continuing process. </p>
<p>But secondly -- and this did have an impact on me at the time, although this </p>
<p>particular piece of intelligence turned out later to be wrong, but at the time, </p>
<p>obviously, we didn’t know that -- on 12 September … I was told and specifically </p>
<p>briefed about these mobile production facilities for biological weapons. So this was </p>
<p>an additional and new factor and this was very much linked to whether and how </p>
<p>Saddam might conceal his activities.”</p>
<p>444</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>837. </b> In the context of questioning about the intelligence reports received in late August </p>
<p>and early September and what might have been in Mr Blair’s mind when he said that </p>
<p>Iraq’s programmes were growing, Sir John Scarlett stated:</p>
<p>“… I think it is important to state that that was the reporting that he was seeing, and </p>
<p>he was receiving a judgement from the JIC which said that production of agent is </p>
<p>continuing and it’s happening now.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>“So it is possible … to conclude that if you are being told that the production is </p>
<p>continuing, it’s possible to conclude that therefore the issue is growing …”</p>
<p>445</p>
<p><b>838. </b> Sir John confirmed that meant the material was accumulating.</p>
<p><b>839. </b> Asked about the sourcing for the reports of 11 and 23 September, Sir John replied: </p>
<p>“… that source was not substantiated and it was the first of the reporting to be </p>
<p>withdrawn … in late July 2003.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>840. </b> Asked whether the SIS reporting, of 11 and 23 September, might have justified </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s use of the word “growing”, Sir Richard Dearlove replied:</p>
<p>“… maybe they account for the Prime Minister saying ‘growing’. I don’t know. </p>
<p>I am not sure whether that is true or not.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>841.  Mr Blair’s statements in his Foreword to the dossier about the nature of </b></p>
<p><b>the threat posed by Iraq to UK interests and that he believed “the assessed </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence” had “established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein had </b></p>
<p><b>“continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues </b></p>
<p><b>in his efforts to develop nuclear weapons” are addressed earlier in this Section. </b></p>
<p><b>842. </b> The references to Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes in the statement </p>
<p>reflected the material in the Foreword and the dossier.</p>
<p><b>843. </b> A reference to material being “missing” as well as “unaccounted for” was new </p>
<p>and implied the material had existed. The word was added to the draft version of </p>
<p>23 September. </p>
<p><b>844.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September, about Iraq’s efforts </b></p>
<p><b>to develop nuclear weapons, Mr Blair said that “we know” Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>“has bought or attempted to buy” material which could be used in a nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>weapons programme.</b></p>
<p><b>845.  Mr Blair’s description in his evidence to the Inquiry, that the information on </b></p>
<p><b>Iraqi procurement activities in the dossier “could indicate a continuing interest in </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear weapons” would have been a more accurate description of the position.</b></p>
<p><b>846. </b> In listing Iraq’s attempts to procure prohibited technology and materials which </p>
<p>could be used in a nuclear weapons programme, which had been set out in the dossier </p>
<p>(page 26), Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“But we now know the following … Saddam has bought or attempted to buy …” </p>
<p><b>847. </b> The dossier said only that intelligence showed “attempts to purchase”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>848. </b> Mr Blair stated that it would only take Saddam Hussein “a year or two” to acquire </p>
<p>a usable nuclear weapon “if he were able to purchase fissile material illegally”, rather </p>
<p>than the fuller and more cautious assessment in the dossier (page 27) that Iraq would </p>
<p>need “essential components from foreign sources” to produce a warhead as well as </p>
<p>fissile material. </p>
<p><b>849. </b> Neither the dossier nor Mr Blair addressed the likelihood of Iraq being able to </p>
<p>procure both fissile material and other essential components.</p>
<p><b>850. </b> Mr Blair did not refer to the judgement in the dossier, which reflected the JIC </p>
<p>Assessments on the issue, that “while sanctions remain effective Iraq would not be able </p>
<p>to produce a nuclear weapon”.</p>
<p>447</p>
<p> “If”, and only if, sanctions were removed or proved </p>
<p>ineffective, Iraq would then need “at least five years to produce sufficient fissile material </p>
<p>for a weapon”.</p>
<p><b>851. </b> Mr Blair also stated that Iraq’s ballistic missile programme was “required for </p>
<p>the delivery of chemical, biological and nuclear programmes” and that it was “clear </p>
<p>that a significant number of longer-range missiles were effectively concealed from the </p>
<p>previous inspectors and remain, including up to 20 extended-range SCUD missiles”. </p>
<p>Subsequently, he added that the ballistic missile capability was “being developed for </p>
<p>multi-purpose use, including with WMD warheads”.</p>
<p><b>852. </b> This material was in the draft of 23 September.</p>
<p><b>853. </b> The dossier (pages 22-23) stated that Iraq had a “variety of delivery means </p>
<p>available for both chemical and biological agents”. It made no statement about the </p>
<p>delivery of nuclear weapons. </p>
<p><b>854. </b> The dossier did not include the reference in the JIC Assessment of 9 September </p>
<p>2002 to an intelligence report that:</p>
<p>“… suggests Iraq has ‘lost’ the capability to develop warheads capable of effectively </p>
<p>disseminating chemical and biological agent and that it would take six months to </p>
<p>overcome the ‘technical difficulties’.”</p>
<p>448</p>
<p><b>855. </b> There was no mention in the dossier of concealment of longer-range missiles, </p>
<p>other than Iraq’s retention of “up to 20 Al Hussein missiles”.</p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>856. </b> Asked whether his statement that the WMD programme was growing applied </p>
<p>to Iraq’s nuclear programme, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… what was set out in the dossier, and set out in very detailed form, incidentally, </p>
<p>were all the different items that he had been trying to procure, which could indicate </p>
<p>a continuing interest in nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>857. </b> Asked whether it would have taken quite a long time to get from that point to </p>
<p>having a usable nuclear weapon, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… if you ask people about the nuclear weapons capability, for example, in respect </p>
<p>of Iraq, some people would say, ‘Yes, if they are doing it on their own, it is going </p>
<p>to take significant amount of time, but you can foreshorten that time if you buy in </p>
<p>the material’. </p>
<p>“So one of the reasons – and I emphasise again this whole proliferation issue and </p>
<p>AQ Khan in particular – was that it always worried me that any of these countries, </p>
<p>if they were so minded, could step up very quickly and get …”</p>

<p><b>The Butler Review conclusions on the JIC authorship of the dossier</b></p>
<p><b>858. </b> In its report, the Butler Review stated:</p>
<p><b>“We conclude that it was a serious weakness that the JIC’s warnings on </b></p>
<p><b>the limitation of the intelligence underlying its judgements were not made </b></p>
<p><b>sufficiently clear in the dossier.</b></p>
<p><b>“We understand why the Government felt it had to meet the mounting </b></p>
<p><b>public and Parliamentary demand for information. We also recognise that </b></p>
<p><b>there is a real dilemma between giving the public an authoritative account </b></p>
<p><b>of the intelligence picture and protecting the objectivity of the JIC from the </b></p>
<p><b>pressures imposed by providing information for public debate. It is difficult </b></p>
<p><b>to resolve these requirements. We conclude with the benefit of hindsight, </b></p>
<p><b>that making public that the JIC had authorship of the dossier was a mistaken </b></p>
<p><b>judgement, though we do not criticise the JIC for taking responsibility for </b></p>
<p><b>clearance of the intelligence content of the document. However, in the </b></p>
<p><b>particular circumstances, the publication of such a document in the name and </b></p>
<p><b>with the authority of the JIC had the result that more weight was placed on the </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>859. </b> The Butler Report recommended that governments in the future should make </p>
<p>arrangements to avoid putting the JIC and its Chair into an area of public controversy </p>
<p>and offered suggestions as to how that might be achieved.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>860. </b> The Report stated:</p>
<p><b>“… we conclude that if intelligence is to be used more widely … in public </b></p>
<p><b>debate in future, those doing so must be careful to avoid its uses and </b></p>
<p><b>limitations. It will be essential too, that clearer and more effective dividing </b></p>
<p><b>lines between assessment and advocacy are established when doing so.”</b></p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>861. </b> The Government accepted the Committee’s conclusions on the public use of </p>
<p>intelligence in its immediate response to the report and subsequently stated that: </p>
<p>“Any future presentation of intelligence will separate the Government case from the </p>
<p>JIC Assessment.”</p>
<p>455</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>862.  From late February 2002, the UK Government position was that Iraq was a </b></p>
<p><b>threat that had to be dealt with; that Iraq needed to disarm in accordance with the </b></p>
<p><b>obligations imposed by the UN; and that it was important to agree to the return of </b></p>
<p><b>UN inspectors to Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>863.  The urgency and certainty with which the position was stated reflected </b></p>
<p><b>both the ingrained belief – that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible </b></p>
<p><b>enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, </b></p>
<p><b>and was pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment – and the wider </b></p>
<p><b>context in which the policy was being discussed with the US.</b></p>
<p><b>864.  But it also served to fuel the demand that the Government should publish the </b></p>
<p><b>document it was known to have prepared, setting out the reasons why it was so </b></p>
<p><b>concerned about Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>865.  In the spring and summer of 2002, senior officials and Ministers took the </b></p>
<p><b>view that the Iraq dossier should not be published until the way ahead on the </b></p>
<p><b>policy was clearer. </b></p>
<p><b>866.  By late August 2002, the Government was troubled by intense speculation </b></p>
<p><b>about whether a decision had already been taken to use military force. In </b></p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s words, the US and UK had been “outed” as having taken a decision </b></p>
<p><b>when no such decision had been taken. </b></p>
<p><b>867.  Mr Blair’s decision on 3 September to announce that the dossier would be </b></p>
<p><b>published was a response to that pressure. </b></p>
<p><b>868.  The dossier was designed to “make the case” and secure Parliamentary (and </b></p>
<p><b>public) support for the Government’s position that action was urgently required to </b></p>
<p><b>secure Iraq’s disarmament.</b></p>
<p><b>869.  The UK Government intended the information and judgements in the Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>dossier to be seen to be the product of the JIC in order to carry authority with </b></p>
<p><b>Parliament and the public. </b></p>
<p><b>870.  SIS was commissioned by No.10 on 4 September to examine whether it had </b></p>
<p><b>any additional material which could be included. </b></p>
<p><b>871.  Mr Scarlett, as Chairman of the JIC, was given the responsibility for </b></p>
<p><b>producing the dossier.</b></p>
<p><b>872.  The dossier drew on the 9 September JIC Assessment, ‘Iraqi Use of Chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and Biological Weapons – Possible Scenarios’, which had been commissioned to </b></p>
<p><b>address scenarios for Iraq’s possible use of chemical and biological weapons in </b></p>
<p><b>the event of military action, previous JIC Assessments and the report issued by </b></p>
<p><b>SIS on 11 September. </b></p>
<p><b>873.  The SIS report should have been shown to the relevant experts in the DIS </b></p>
<p><b>who could have advised their senior managers and the Assessments Staff. </b></p>
<p><b>874.  Expert officials in DIS questioned the certainty with which some of the </b></p>
<p><b>judgements in the dossier were expressed. Some of their questions were </b></p>
<p><b>discussed during the preparation of the dossier. The text was agreed by </b></p>
<p><b>Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence, at the JIC meeting </b></p>
<p><b>on 19 September.</b></p>
<p><b>875.  There is no evidence that other members of the JIC were aware at the time </b></p>
<p><b>of the reservations recorded in the minute by Dr Jones of 19 September and that </b></p>
<p><b>written by the chemical weapons expert in his team the following day. </b></p>
<p><b>876.  The JIC accepted ownership of the dossier and agreed its content. There is </b></p>
<p><b>no evidence that intelligence was improperly included in the dossier or that No.10 </b></p>
<p><b>improperly influenced the text. </b></p>
<p><b>877.  At issue are the judgements made by the JIC and how they and the </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence were presented, including in Mr Blair’s Foreword and in his statement </b></p>
<p><b>to Parliament on 24 September 2002.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>878.  It is unlikely that Parliament and the public would have distinguished </b></p>
<p><b>between the ownership and therefore the authority of the judgements in the </b></p>
<p><b>Foreword and those in the Executive Summary and the main body of the dossier.</b></p>
<p><b>879.  In the Foreword, Mr Blair stated that he believed the “assessed intelligence” </b></p>
<p><b>had “established beyond doubt” that Saddam Hussein had “continued to produce </b></p>
<p><b>chemical and biological weapons, that he continues in his efforts to develop </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear weapons, and that he had been able to extend the range of his ballistic </b></p>
<p><b>missile programme”. That raises two key questions.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Did Mr Blair’s statements in whole or in part go further than the assessed </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence? </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Did that matter?</b></p>
<p><b>880.  The Inquiry is not questioning Mr Blair’s belief, which he consistently </b></p>
<p><b>reiterated in his evidence to the Inquiry, or his legitimate role in advocating </b></p>
<p><b>Government policy. </b></p>
<p><b>881.  But the deliberate selection of a formulation which grounded the statement </b></p>
<p><b>in what Mr Blair believed, rather than in the judgements which the JIC had actually </b></p>
<p><b>reached in its assessment of the intelligence, indicates a distinction between his </b></p>
<p><b>beliefs and the JIC’s actual judgements.</b></p>
<p><b>882.  That is supported by the position taken by the JIC and No.10 officials at the </b></p>
<p><b>time, and in the evidence offered to the Inquiry by some of those involved.</b></p>
<p><b>883.  The assessed intelligence had not established beyond doubt that Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein had continued to produce chemical and biological weapons. The </b></p>
<p><b>Executive Summary of the dossier stated that the JIC judged that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”. The main text of the </b></p>
<p><b>dossier said that there had been “recent” production. It also stated that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>the means to deliver chemical and biological weapons. It did not say that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>continued to produce weapons. </b></p>
<p><b>884.  Nor had the assessed intelligence established beyond doubt that efforts </b></p>
<p><b>to develop nuclear weapons continued. The JIC stated in the Executive Summary </b></p>
<p><b>of the dossier that Iraq had:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>made covert attempts “to acquire technology and materials which could </b></p>
<p><b>be used in the production of nuclear weapons”; </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>“sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa, despite having </b></p>
<p><b>no active nuclear programme that would require it”; and </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>“recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme”.</b></p>

<p>4.2  |  Iraq WMD assessments, July to September 2002</p>
<p>283</p>
<p><b>885.  But the dossier made clear that, as long as sanctions remained effective, </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq could not produce a nuclear weapon.</b></p>
<p><b>886.  These conclusions draw on the evidence from the JIC Assessments at the </b></p>
<p><b>time and the Executive Summary of the dossier, which are set out in this Section. </b></p>
<p><b>They do not rely on hindsight. </b></p>
<p><b>887.  The JIC itself should have made that position clear because its ownership </b></p>
<p><b>of the dossier, which was intended to inform a highly controversial policy debate, </b></p>
<p><b>carried with it the responsibility to ensure that the JIC’s integrity was protected. </b></p>
<p><b>888.  The process of seeking the JIC’s views, through Mr Scarlett, on the text of </b></p>
<p><b>the Foreword shows that No.10 expected the JIC to raise any concerns it had.</b></p>
<p><b>889.  The firmness of Mr Blair’s beliefs, despite the underlying uncertainties, is </b></p>
<p><b>important in considering how the judgements in the Foreword would have been </b></p>
<p><b>interpreted by Cabinet in its discussions on 23 September and by Parliament.</b></p>
<p><b>890.  In his statement to Parliament on 24 September and in his answers to </b></p>
<p><b>subsequent questions, Mr Blair presented Iraq’s past, current and potential future </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities as evidence of the severity of the potential threat from Iraq’s weapons </b></p>
<p><b>of mass destruction; and that, at some point in the future, that threat would </b></p>
<p><b>become a reality. </b></p>
<p><b>891.  By the time the dossier was published, President Bush had announced that </b></p>
<p><b>the US was seeking action on Iraq through the UN, and Iraq had agreed to the </b></p>
<p><b>return of inspectors. </b></p>
<p><b>892.  Rather than the debate being framed in terms of the answers needed to the </b></p>
<p><b>outstanding questions identified by UNSCOM and the IAEA, including the material </b></p>
<p><b>for which UNSCOM had been unable to account, the dossier’s description of </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s capabilities and intent became part of the baseline against which the UK </b></p>
<p><b>Government measured Iraq’s future statements and actions and the success of </b></p>
<p><b>weapons inspections.</b></p>
<p><b>893.  As the next Section of the Report demonstrates, the judgements remained </b></p>
<p><b>in place without challenge until the invasion of Iraq in March 2003. Iraq’s denials </b></p>
<p><b>of the capabilities and intent attributed to it were not taken seriously.</b></p>
<p><b>894.  As the flaws in the construct and the intelligence were exposed after the </b></p>
<p><b>conflict, the dossier and subsequent statements to Parliament also became the </b></p>
<p><b>baseline against which the Government’s good faith and credibility were judged.</b></p>
<p><b>895.  There will continue to be demands for factual evidence to explain the </b></p>
<p><b>background to controversial policy decisions including, where appropriate, </b></p>
<p><b>the explicit and public use of assessed intelligence.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>896.  The Inquiry shares the Butler Review’s conclusions that it was a mistake </b></p>
<p><b>not to see the risk of combining in the September dossier the JIC’s assessment </b></p>
<p><b>of intelligence and other evidence with the interpretation and presentation of the </b></p>
<p><b>evidence in order to make the case for policy action.</b></p>
<p><b>897.  The nature of the two functions is fundamentally different. As can be seen </b></p>
<p><b>from the JIC Assessments quoted in, and published with, this report, they contain </b></p>
<p><b>careful language intended to ensure that no more weight is put on the evidence </b></p>
<p><b>than it can bear. Organising the evidence in order to present an argument in the </b></p>
<p><b>language of Ministerial statements produces a quite different type of document. </b></p>
<p><b>898.  The widespread perception that the September 2002 dossier overstated </b></p>
<p><b>the firmness of the evidence about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions in order to </b></p>
<p><b>influence opinion and “make the case” for action to disarm Iraq has produced </b></p>
<p><b>a damaging legacy, including undermining trust and confidence in Government </b></p>
<p><b>statements, particularly those which rely on intelligence which cannot be </b></p>
<p><b>independently verified.</b></p>
<p><b>899.  As a result, in situations where the policy response may involve military </b></p>
<p><b>action and the evidence, at least in part, depends on inferential judgements </b></p>
<p><b>drawn from necessarily incomplete intelligence, it may be more difficult to secure </b></p>
<p><b>support for the Government’s position and agreement to action.</b></p>
<p><b>900.  The explicit and public use of material from JIC Assessments to underpin </b></p>
<p><b>policy decisions will be infrequent. But, from the evidence on the compilation of </b></p>
<p><b>the September dossier, the lessons for any similar exercise in future would be:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The need for clear separation of the responsibility for analysis and </b></p>
<p><b>assessment of intelligence from the responsibility for making the </b></p>
<p><b>argument for a policy.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The importance of precision in describing the position. In the case of </b></p>
<p><b>the September dossier, for instance, the term “programme” was used to </b></p>
<p><b>describe disparate activities at very different stages of maturity. There was </b></p>
<p><b>a “programme” to extend the range of the Al Samoud missile. There was </b></p>
<p><b>no “programme” in any meaningful sense to develop and produce nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>weapons. Use of the shorthand CW or BW in relation to Iraq’s capability </b></p>
<p><b>obscured whether the reference was to weapons or warfare. Constant use </b></p>
<p><b>of the term “weapons of mass destruction” without further clarification </b></p>
<p><b>obscured the differences between the potential impact of nuclear, </b></p>
<p><b>biological and chemical weapons and the ability to deliver them effectively. </b></p>
<p><b>For example, there would be a considerable difference between the effects </b></p>
<p><b>of an artillery shell filled with mustard gas, which is a battlefield weapon, </b></p>
<p><b>and a long-range ballistic missile with a chemical or biological warhead, </b></p>
<p><b>which is a weapon of terror. </b></p>

<p>• </p>
<p><b>The need to identify and accurately describe the confidence and </b></p>
<p><b>robustness of the evidence base. There may be evidence which is </b></p>
<p><b>“authoritative” or which puts an issue “beyond doubt”; but there are </b></p>
<p><b>unlikely to be many circumstances when those descriptions could </b></p>
<p><b>properly be applied to inferential judgements relying on intelligence. </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The need to be explicit about the likelihood of events. The possibility </b></p>
<p><b>of Iraq producing and using an improvised nuclear device was, rightly, </b></p>
<p><b>omitted from the dossier. But the claim that Iraq could build a nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>weapon within one to two years if it obtained fissile material and other </b></p>
<p><b>essential components from foreign sources was included without </b></p>
<p><b>addressing how feasible and likely that would be. In addition, the </b></p>
<p><b>Executive Summary gave prominence to the IISS suggestion that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>would be able to assemble nuclear weapons within months if it could </b></p>
<p><b>obtain fissile material, without reference to the material in the main text </b></p>
<p><b>of the dossier which made clear that the UK took a very different view. </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The need to be scrupulous in discriminating between facts and knowledge </b></p>
<p><b>on the one hand and opinion, judgement or belief on the other. </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The need for vigilance to avoid unwittingly crossing the line from </b></p>
<p><b>supposition to certainty, including by constant repetition of </b></p>
<p><b>received wisdom.</b></p>
<p><b>901.  When assessed intelligence is explicitly and publicly used to support a </b></p>
<p><b>policy decision, there would be benefit in subjecting that assessment and the </b></p>
<p><b>underpinning intelligence to subsequent scrutiny, by a suitable, independent </b></p>
<p><b>body, such as the Intelligence and Security Committee, with a view to identifying </b></p>
<p><b>lessons for the future. </b></p>
