<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the arrangements for providing medical care to Service Personnel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of medical care and welfare support for seriously injured Service </p>
<p>Personnel and their families; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the support provided for veterans.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The welfare support provided to Service Personnel and their families is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 16.1.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The preparations made for repatriating the bodies of those who lost their lives </p>
<p>serving on Op TELIC, how their deaths were investigated, and the support provided for </p>
<p>bereaved families are addressed in Section 16.3. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> The decision to deploy to Helmand province in Afghanistan, and the implications of </p>
<p>that decision, are addressed in Section 9. </p>
<p><b>System for providing medical care for Service Personnel</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> The healthcare system in the UK comprises three tiers:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Primary care is provided at the first point of consultation, including by General </p>
<p>Practitioners (GPs).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secondary care is provided by medical specialists who do not usually have first </p>
<p>contact with patients, including in a hospital. It includes acute care. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tertiary care is specialised consultative healthcare, for example for cancer </p>
<p>management.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Primary care for Service Personnel in the UK and Service base areas overseas is </p>
<p>provided by the MOD’s Defence Medical Services (DMS).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Secondary care for Service Personnel is generally provided within the National </p>
<p>Health Service (NHS). </p>
<p><b>8. </b> Following the closure of military hospitals in the 1990s, the Government established </p>
<p>five MOD Hospital Units (MDHUs) within NHS Trusts. MDHUs are not discrete military </p>
<p>wards or units, but comprise medical Service Personnel (including substantial numbers </p>
<p>of Reservists) integrated into a host NHS Trust. MDHUs:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide accelerated access for elective referrals of Service Personnel, to meet </p>
<p>operational requirements; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allow medical Service Personnel to develop and maintain their skills.</p>

<p>16.2  |  Support for injured Service Personnel and veterans </p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>9. </b> In April 2001, the MOD established the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) </p>
<p>within the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust (UHBFT), as “a centre of </p>
<p>military medical excellence, with academic, teaching and clinical roles”. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> During the period covered by the Inquiry, the main receiving centre for casualties </p>
<p>evacuated from operational theatres was RCDM Selly Oak (one of the hospitals within </p>
<p>the UHBFT).</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> If Selly Oak was unable to cope with the flow of casualties, the Government could </p>
<p>activate the Reception Arrangements of Military Personnel (RAMP) plan, engaging the </p>
<p>wider NHS in the treatment of military casualties. </p>
<p><b>12. </b> Military patients requiring further rehabilitation once released from hospital might </p>
<p>be referred to the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court </p>
<p>in Surrey, the principal medical rehabilitation centre run by the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> DMRC </p>
<p>Headley Court also accepted direct admission from hospitals, and most combat </p>
<p>casualties were referred directly to DMRC Headley Court from RCDM Selly Oak. </p>
<p><b>13. </b> DMRC Headley Court provided both physiotherapy and group rehabilitation for </p>
<p>complex musculo-skeletal injuries, and neuro-rehabilitation for brain-injured patients.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Operation TELIC was the first major military operation after the closure of the </p>
<p>military hospitals in the 1990s. Many medical Service Personnel were therefore </p>
<p>withdrawn from NHS Trusts, and military casualties were treated in NHS Trusts. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Tertiary care for Service Personnel is provided by the NHS.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> From 2002, the MOD reconfigured its mental health services to focus on community </p>
<p>rather than in-patient services, including by establishing 15 military Departments of </p>
<p>Community Mental Health (DCMH) throughout the UK to provide out-patient mental </p>
<p>healthcare for Service Personnel.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. </b> From 2004, in-patient mental healthcare was provided by The Priory Group of </p>
<p>hospitals, through a contract with the MOD. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Those changes were in line with NHS best practice, which held that individuals </p>
<p>should be treated in as normal as environment as possible, close to their units, families </p>
<p>and friends. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The Ex-Services Mental Welfare Society (generally known as Combat Stress) runs </p>
<p>three short-stay residential treatment centres for men and women who have served in </p>

<p>the Armed Forces or the Merchant Navy. The MOD meets the cost of fees charged by </p>
<p>Combat Stress for “remedial treatment” at the three centres.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> Veterans’ healthcare is generally provided by the NHS. Charities and welfare </p>
<p>organisations also play an important role. </p>
<p><b>Medical care during the combat phase of operations</b></p>
<p><b>Planning and preparing to provide medical care</b></p>
<p><b>21. </b> In July 2002, the MOD defined three options for a UK contribution to US-led military </p>
<p>operations in Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 1 – an “in-place support package” using forces already in the region; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 2 – an “enhanced support package” comprising Package 1 with </p>
<p>additional air and maritime forces; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 3 – a “discrete UK package” based on deployment of an armoured </p>
<p>division, in addition to the forces in Package 2.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Those three options provided the broad framework for discussions within the </p>
<p>UK Government until the end of 2002.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> A Strategic Medical Estimate was prepared for the MOD’s Strategic Planning Group </p>
<p>on 1 September 2002.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> The Estimate – which assumed an entry into Iraq from Turkey – </p>
<p>set out the expected number of Role 3 hospital admissions from an operation in Iraq, as </p>
<p>a basis for medical planning:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>157 (best case) to 241 (worst case) battle casualties;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>152 (best case) to 212 (worst case) casualties from chemical warfare; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>15 percent of those exposed to biological warfare; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>34 Disease and Non-Battle Injuries (DNBI) a day.</p>
<p><b>24. </b>  The Estimate stated that 55 individuals a week would require medical evacuation </p>
<p>back to the UK. </p>

<p>16.2  |  Support for injured Service Personnel and veterans </p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>Structure of medical support to operations </b></p>
<p>Military medical support was organised in four tiers, on the basis of the medical </p>
<p>capabilities and resources available:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Role 1 (broadly equivalent to Echelon 1 for maritime forces) medical support was </p>
<p>integral or allocated to a small unit, and included the capabilities for providing </p>
<p>first aid, immediate lifesaving measures, and triage. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Role 2 support was normally provided at larger unit level, and included </p>
<p>pre-hospital care. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Role 3 support was normally provided at Division level and above. It included </p>
<p>specialist diagnostic resources, and specialist surgical and medical capabilities. </p>
<p>Support would usually be provided in field hospitals and (as Echelon 3) in </p>
<p>hospital ships.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Role 4 support was the definitive hospital and rehabilitative care of patients. </p>
<p>That would usually be provided in the UK.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>25. </b> General Sir Kevin O’Donoghue, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Health) (DCDS(H)) </p>
<p>from September 2002 to 2004, told the Inquiry that medical planning was “quite </p>
<p>advanced” by the time he took up post.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Staffing plans were in place and gaps in medical </p>
<p>equipment and supplies had been identified, although approval had not yet been </p>
<p>received to begin procurement to fill those gaps. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> On 31 October, Mr Blair agreed that the UK should offer Package 3 to the US on the </p>
<p>same basis as Package 2, for planning purposes.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>27. </b> In early December, an MOD official invited Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, </p>
<p>to agree that the MOD should hold detailed talks with the Department of Health (DoH) </p>
<p>on the withdrawal of Regular and Reserve medical personnel from the NHS, and on </p>
<p>the reception of casualties under the RAMP.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Package 3 would require around 2,000 </p>
<p>medical personnel, of whom approximately 60 percent would be Reservists. The majority </p>
<p>of those Reservists would be working within the NHS; their withdrawal would have a </p>
<p>“local impact”. DoH was pressing the MOD for details on the withdrawal of medical </p>
<p>Reservists. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> The official also advised that the procurement of medical equipment through the </p>
<p>Urgent Operational Requirement (UOR) mechanism to support Packages 0 (Special </p>
<p>Forces only) and Package 1 was under way. The Treasury was expected to authorise </p>
<p>procurement of medical equipment to support Package 2 shortly. The MOD’s Directorate </p>
<p>of Capability, Resources and Scrutiny (DCRS) had not yet approved the business case </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>for the medical equipment to support Package 3; that approval, and the subsequent </p>
<p>Treasury authority to commence procurement, was needed as soon as possible. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> The official advised that in “about three months time” the DMS would have </p>
<p>“minimised medical risk by being properly equipped in mission critical areas”. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> On 11 December, Gen O’Donoghue told the Chiefs of Staff that the DoH had been </p>
<p>engaged on Iraq planning, and had responded “positively and pragmatically”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> The DCRS agreed the business cases for the medical modules (packages of </p>
<p>equipment and supplies) to support Package 3 on 16 December.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The modules were </p>
<p>expected to achieve “full capability in theatre” on 15 March 2003. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> At the beginning of 2003, in the light of continued uncertainty on whether Turkey </p>
<p>would agree to the use of its territory by Coalition ground forces, the focus of UK military </p>
<p>planning shifted from the North to the South of Iraq (see Sections 6.1 and 6.2). </p>
<p><b>33. </b> The Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) assessed that the shift made the </p>
<p>UK medical mission “less demanding in terms of supporting manoeuvre”.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> A revised </p>
<p>Estimate specified that the Role 3 medical support required: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) Argus, as the Primary Casualty Receiving Facility </p>
<p>(PCRF), with 100 beds;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>two 200-bed field hospitals deployed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a third 200-bed field hospital in reserve; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>casualty staging flights through Cyprus; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the augmentation of the Princess Mary Military Hospital in Cyprus.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> RFA Argus deployed on 15 January and was operational in the North Arabian Gulf </p>
<p>by mid-February. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, wrote to Mr Hoon on 10 March to inform him </p>
<p>that the DoH was ready to activate the RAMP, when required.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>36. </b> Mr Hoon was advised by PJHQ on 14 March that an “effective medical capability”, </p>
<p>scaled to the expected number of casualties, was now operational in theatre.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Arrangements were also in place for the aeromedical evacuation of casualties to the UK. </p>

<p>16.2  |  Support for injured Service Personnel and veterans </p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Gen O’Donoghue told the Inquiry that by 19 March, when military operations against </p>
<p>Iraq began, there remained some “shortfalls” in medical modules: </p>
<p>“We had worked out what equipment we needed. We were allowed to discuss that </p>
<p>informally with industry in, I think, mid-November. We weren’t allowed to place the </p>
<p>orders until early to mid-December, which we did with £34m/£35m worth of UORS, </p>
<p>and those came in between then and March. </p>
<p>“Some items may not have arrived by March, but they came fairly shortly afterwards </p>
<p>and we topped up the modules.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Sections 6.3 and 13 describe the development and approval of UOR business cases </p>
<p>within the MOD and discussions with the Treasury on funding UORs. A mechanism </p>
<p>for funding UORs was agreed between Mr Hoon and Mr Brown on 23 September; the </p>
<p>mechanism did not require individual UORs to be agreed by the Treasury. Mr Hoon </p>
<p>agreed that the MOD could begin discussions with industry on the provision of UORs </p>
<p>on 2 December. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Brigadier Alan Hawley, Commander Medical of the Joint Force Logistic Command </p>
<p>during Op TELIC 1 (which covered the initial combat phase of military operations in </p>
<p>Iraq), told the House of Commons Defence Committee in October 2003:</p>
<p>“From where I was, no one informed me of any clinical care that was compromised </p>
<p>by a lack of equipment. I have to say that it was very tight.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Brig Hawley assessed that a number of factors had combined to produce that </p>
<p>“rather tight, fraught situation”, including the late release of money for UORs, a new </p>
<p>process for building medical equipment modules, and a change in responsibility for </p>
<p>medical supply from the medical to the logistical Command. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> Vice Admiral Ian Jenkins, Surgeon-General from 2002 to 2006, agreed with </p>
<p>Brig Hawley’s assessment: </p>
<p>“… I can categorically assure you that clinical outcomes [during Op TELIC 1] were </p>
<p>uncompromised. Yes there were problems with supply, equipment and everything </p>
<p>else, mobilisation of Reserves, support … but the clinical outcomes were first </p>
<p>class. I can put my hand on my heart and say that nobody suffered inappropriately </p>
<p>because of a lack of medical requirement.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Lieutenant General Louis Lillywhite, the Director General of Army Medical Services </p>
<p>from 2003 to 2005 and Surgeon General from 2006 to 2009, told the Inquiry that cost </p>
<p>had not been an issue in providing medical care: </p>
<p>“As far as care on operations are concerned, it is effectiveness that counts, not </p>
<p>cost-effectiveness. As far as providing care for Servicemen was concerned, I was – </p>
<p>I personally, and I have to say Ministers supported me – did not allow cost to be an </p>
<p>issue. If it was required, it was provided.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>43. </b> A July 2003 MOD report on Op TELIC 1 stated that the medical component of </p>
<p>the deployment was fully staffed, with 2,800 medical staff including 760 Reservists.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Trained psychiatric staff were also deployed.</p>
<p><b>Arrangements for supporting mental health</b></p>
<p><b>44. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite described for the Inquiry, the Armed Forces’ general approach to </p>
<p>identifying and tackling mental health issues at the beginning of Op TELIC: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using initial and subsequent training to identify individuals with less ability to </p>
<p>withstand stress, and to help prepare people to withstand stress;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training commanders to identify issues as early as possible; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deploying field psychiatric teams to help identify those “who had true </p>
<p>psychological disability, that … needed care and evacuation or simply support </p>
<p>and return to duty”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Prior to deployment on Op TELIC, Royal Navy and Army units received a </p>
<p>pre-deployment presentation by a psychiatrist or community psychiatric nurse (or </p>
<p>non-medical personnel if medical personnel were unavailable).</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> As the RAF deployed </p>
<p>as individuals rather than formed units, it produced an equivalent booklet for all </p>
<p>deploying personnel. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> The Services also prepared post-deployment stress prevention packages, </p>
<p>comprising two handouts and a post-operational psychological briefing. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> MOD demobilisation policy at the beginning of Op TELIC required that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the end of an operational tour but while still in theatre, all individuals should </p>
<p>attend a presentation and be given an information leaflet covering post-traumatic </p>
<p>stress reactions and the problems that might be encountered on returning home </p>
<p>to families. Families should be offered a presentation and information leaflets on </p>
<p>the possible after-effects of an operational deployment.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>All personnel should undertake a period of “normalisation”, lasting two to three </p>
<p>days, before taking post-operational tour leave. It would usually be spent on </p>
<p>routine duties. This requirement stemmed from the MOD’s assessment that:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The immediate release of personnel after an operational tour could be a </p>
<p>contributory factor to the likelihood of developing post-conflict syndromes.</p>

<p>Personnel should be given time to deal with issues raised by combat in the </p>

<p><b>53. </b> In July, PJHQ assessed that medical support during Op TELIC had been “a success </p>
<p>by any measure”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> The aeromedical evacuation of casualties (by VC 10 to Cyprus then </p>
<p>by civilian aircraft to the UK) had been particularly effective. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> PJHQ reported that some evacuated Service Personnel were nursed in NHS </p>
<p>hospitals without other military patients and had therefore lacked “peer support”. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> The issue of treating injured Service Personnel in NHS hospitals, and on civilian </p>
<p>wards, would come to prominence in 2006. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that in the early part of Op TELIC, the MOD did </p>
<p>not have the data to make an objective assessment of the effectiveness of emergency </p>
<p>care.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> Analysis of data relating to later phases of Op TELIC indicated that UK medical </p>
<p>support was achieving a significantly greater than expected survival rate. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> Gen O’Donoghue told the Inquiry that the DMS drew two major lessons from its </p>
<p>experience during the invasion:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It needed more Regular medical Personnel, to take account of the limited time </p>
<p>that any individual could spend in theatre given their NHS commitments and the </p>
<p>need to retain “medical dexterity”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UORs allowed DMS to respond to particular threats and secure the latest </p>
<p>equipment, but it needed more equipment and supplies “on the shelves” ready </p>
<p>to deploy.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite described a number of changes in the provision of medical care </p>
<p>after Op TELIC 1.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> During Op TELIC 1, the MOD generally used armoured ambulances </p>
<p>to move casualties from aid posts to medical regiments and a mixture of ambulances </p>
<p>and helicopters to get from (Role 2) medical regiments to hospital. From Op TELIC 2, </p>
<p>the military generally used helicopters to move from the point of wounding or the aid </p>
<p>post to hospital. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It was iniquitous that soldiers being treated at the RCDM Selly Oak lost their </p>
<p>entitlement to the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) and some other </p>
<p>allowances. The OWP would provide much of the support (including TVs, DVDs </p>
<p>and telephone calls) that were currently being provided from “assorted non-</p>
<p>public funds” or paid for by the soldiers themselves. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> Lt Gen Viggers identified a number of immediate actions, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>informing wounded personnel what the MOD was planning to do to create a </p>
<p>military environment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>starting to create that military environment, by putting soldiers together in one </p>
<p>area of a ward; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extending the OWP to patients. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> On 23 August, General Sir Timothy Granville-Chapman, Vice Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Staff (VCDS), reported that Mr Browne had given him a “very thorough de-brief” on his </p>
<p>15 August visit to RCDM Selly Oak.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> Key points included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Browne was “very seized” with the need for injured personnel to recover in a </p>
<p>military environment, and was clear that a “military ward solution” was needed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Browne was “very much behind” Lt Gen Viggers’ recommendation that the </p>
<p>OWP should be extended to injured personnel. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The following week, the MOD’s Service Personnel Board (SPB) considered a </p>
<p>package of financial and non-financial measures which aimed to replicate the effects of </p>
<p>the OWP for in-patients, whether at the RCDM or elsewhere.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> The SPB was advised </p>
<p>that, although the package was “work in progress”, Gen Granville-Chapman was clear </p>
<p>that the proposal “cannot bear the delay inherent in the usual staff circulations”. </p>
<p><b>68. </b>  The package, which included the payment of Incidental Expenses to in-patients </p>

<p><b>70. </b> In early October, there was considerable press coverage of alleged verbal abuse of </p>
<p>military patients at Selly Oak hospital by members of the public.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>71. </b> On 24 October, the SPB assessed that action to establish a Military Managed Ward </p>
<p>(MMW) at RCDM Selly Oak was “well in hand”, and that:</p>
<p>“Security had been the biggest issue, and a weekly meeting was now in place </p>
<p>between the local police (who have security primacy), MOD Police, RCDM and </p>
<p>NHS Staffs.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>72. </b> General Sir Richard Dannatt made his first visit to RCDM Selly Oak as Chief of </p>
<p>the General Staff (CGS) in December.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> He reported to Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, </p>
<p>Chief of the Defence Staff, that while progress was being made, the “whole ‘system’ </p>
<p>for dealing with those wounded on operations, once back in the UK, has been allowed </p>
<p>to sink to such a woefully inadequate level that the task to rebuild it … is huge”. </p>
<p>He identified two underlying problems:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RCDM was principally focused on delivering trained medical staff, rather than </p>
<p>treating the wounded.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD had implicitly accepted that the NHS level of care was “good enough” </p>
<p>for Service Personnel. That was reasonable for clinical care, but not for other </p>
<p>issues such as the nurse to patient ratio, access to specialist units, and food. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> Gen Dannatt concluded that efforts to establish an MMW needed to be </p>
<p>re-invigorated and, more fundamentally, that the MOD should “operationalise” Selly Oak </p>
<p>as a Role 4 military medical facility. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> The MMW reached Initial Operating Capability in December 2006 and Full </p>
<p>Operating Capability in July 2007, when it comprised 39 medical Service Personnel </p>
<p>(compared with 12 in summer 2006):</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>11 orthopaedic nurses;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>urgency, although “we should not take any satisfaction in reaching what is only the basic </p>
<p>level of care that our wounded servicemen deserve”. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> The challenge now was to ensure that clinical, welfare and administrative support </p>
<p>was delivered to injured personnel in a holistic manner wherever they were in the </p>
<p>healthcare system. </p>
<p><b>77. </b> In February 2008, the House of Commons Defence Committee described the clinical </p>
<p>care for Service Personnel injured on operations as “second to none”.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> The Committee </p>
<p>commented, however, that “many of the improvements … are relatively recent, and </p>
<p>there has been a great deal of change over the past 18 months. The MOD should not be </p>
<p>complacent: they have had to learn important lessons and it is now clear that the picture </p>
<p>at Selly Oak was not always so positive.”</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Specific issues cited in the report included the provision of toiletries and basic </p>
<p>clothing for Service Personnel, travel assistance for the families of injured Service </p>
<p>Personnel, and accommodation for the relatives of parents. The report stated that </p>
<p>improvements were taking place, but “some of the slack had been taken up by </p>
<p>welfare organisations”.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Adam Ingram, Minister for the Armed Forces from 2001 to 2007, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It became very clear early on that there was a problem at Selly Oak. It wasn’t the </p>
<p>question of the quality of the medical care. It was the fact that they were in mixed </p>
<p>[military/civilian] wards. You had soldiers who had been attended to by civilian </p>
<p>nurses, civilian doctors and in the next bed there may well be a civilian injured </p>
<p>person or old person. </p>
<p>“That became a big issue. My instinct initially was … that if I was injured, I just </p>
<p>wanted the best medical care … </p>
<p>“But, as a result of a number of visits, Ministerial visits, it became abundantly clear </p>
<p>we needed to do other things. So progressively, the number of military personnel, </p>
<p>in terms of the medical care, changed …”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It quickly became apparent that returning casualties actually wanted to be looked </p>
<p>after by the military … </p>
<p>“Although at no stage … was the clinical care of casualties coming back from Iraq </p>
<p>compromised, there was an unhappiness amongst the patients themselves and their </p>

<p>“So there was a period when the plan, which was working, was not in accord with </p>
<p>what people had expected or wanted. So that led to a significant period of adverse </p>
<p>press and internal adverse press as well, whilst both the medical services, but </p>
<p>even more so the chain of command, organised themselves to actually provide that </p>
<p>military bubble around the care in the hospital.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that, while establishing a “military bubble” – such </p>
<p>as the MMW – around a military patient did not improve the quality of clinical care, “one </p>
<p>should not underestimate the beneficial impact upon recovery, upon family dynamics, </p>
<p>and upon psychological wellbeing of actually being content”.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> He added that the </p>

<p><b>Improvements at Headley Court</b></p>
<p><b>82. </b> The facilities at DMRC Headley Court had been significantly enhanced by the end of </p>
<p>Op TELIC, including through: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the opening of a Complex Rehabilitation and Amputee Unit in June 2006: a </p>
<p>contract was let to a private company that manufactured individually tailored </p>
<p>prosthetics on site;</p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>construction of a 58-bed staff and patient accommodation block (Wood House) </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the opening of the Centre for Mental and Cognitive Health, to provide mental </p>
<p>health and clinical psychology services, in spring 2009.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> In May 2008, Ministers announced £24m in capital funding over four years for a </p>
<p>Headley Court development programme. Over the first two years, this funding was </p>
<p>mainly applied to the MOD contribution to the “Help for Heroes” rehabilitation complex </p>
<p>(which was officially opened in June 2010) and a utilities upgrade for the whole site.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that, while Headley Court was a “centre of </p>
<p>excellence”, it was also “the greatest area of risk in actually managing casualties”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first risk area was its capacity: </p>
<p>“We were seeing far more cases that needed in-patient care in beds than we had </p>
<p>ever seen probably since Korea … and the capacity of Headley Court was not </p>
<p>sufficient to have met it. Luckily, the building programme, the temporary ward, the </p>

<p>surge. A close run thing, I think, but we kept ahead of the surge.”</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The second risk area was the building itself:</p>
<p>“Headley Court is a fine listed building, which had in essence for many years treated </p>
<p>sports injuries, complex sports injuries, but not open wounds. What we have started </p>
<p>doing in this conflict is starting rehabilitation ever earlier, with significant success. </p>
<p>But it posed risk in the type of surroundings that they were being managed in, in that </p>
<p>Headley Court was not set up to look after cases that were open wounds or complex </p>
<p>medication that required ongoing non-rehabilitation specialist care.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The Inquiry visited Headley Court in October 2010, and spoke to a number of </p>
<p>members of staff and Iraq veterans. Members of staff told the Inquiry that it would be </p>

<p>imperatives, high commitment levels and evolving welfare demands, as well as a </p>
<p>steadily declining knowledge and consciousness amongst the public and in the media </p>
<p>of military needs and expectations during and after service”.</p>

<p>top of the organisation [the MOD] knew what the problems were, understood them, and </p>
<p>had a determined commitment to tackle them”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>The role of charitable organisations</b></p>
<p>In the UK, charitable organisations have traditionally played an important role in providing </p>
<p>care to Service Personnel and veterans, often working closely with the MOD, the NHS and </p>
<p>the private sector. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that the MOD welcomed the involvement of charitable </p>
<p>organisations (although it might not always agree with their approach):</p>
<p>“They all have a desire to actually progress the care of Servicemen … and they </p>
<p>actually contribute significantly to; one, promoting the cause of particularly the ex-</p>
<p>Servicemen; secondly, they are quite good at challenging us on what we are doing </p>
<p>or not doing; and thirdly, they often bring a degree of expertise or approach that we </p>
<p>might not otherwise have recognised.</p>
<p>“… it is a complex relationship but they are an essential part, in my view, of our </p>
<p>society in terms of actually ensuring that veterans in particular, but to a lesser extent, </p>
<p>serving soldiers, get the appropriate care that they require.”</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>In his autobiography, Gen Dannatt described how, in 2007, charitable organisations </p>
<p>became increasingly involved in military medical and welfare issues, as the number of </p>
<p>casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan grew and the “fragility of the … arrangements for our </p>
<p>seriously injured become painfully apparent”.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> That fragility related not to clinical care, </p>
<p>which was excellent, but to the broader support that was available to injured personnel </p>
<p>and their families. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>Gen Dannatt wrote that the increasing involvement of charitable organisations was, in his </p>
<p>view, not a response to “a challenge thrown down by the Government, merely evidence </p>
<p>that the nation was beginning to get behind its soldiers and their families”. </p>
<p><b>Handling complex cases</b></p>
<p><b>93. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that survival rates improved significantly over the </p>
<p>course of Op TELIC.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> He also highlighted the increasing number of Service Personnel </p>
<p>with “complex injuries” that would be seen in civilian life extremely rarely, and for which </p>
<p>civilian medical and social services have not been set up to manage. </p>
<p><b>94. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite also told the Inquiry that since the start of the Iraq conflict, the </p>
<p>MOD had taken a more flexible approach to determining the appropriate date for </p>
<p>discharge, which now depended on the individual’s circumstances.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> He described </p>
<p>that to be “a compassionate response to … very, very serious injuries and sometimes </p>
<p>family situations”. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> A particular challenge was managing the transfer of care from the military system to </p>
<p>the NHS, when an individual with complex injuries was discharged.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> The military system </p>
<p>was holding onto casualties for longer, and in some cases to a point where it did not </p>
<p>have all the capability required to care for the individual. However, at that same point, </p>
<p>the NHS was not set up to provide the comprehensive care that was required. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lillywhite commented:</p>
<p>“So arranging that care package requires individual persuasion, discussion, debate, </p>
<p>with the local authorities in the place where that individual is at home. Of course, the </p>
<p>issue of funding can then come into it … </p>
<p>“So the ongoing care of the complex casualty is throwing up issues that we have not </p>
<p>seen before.”</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite suggested that individuals with complex injuries should be treated </p>
<p>by the Government as a group with specific clinical needs, in recognition of their service </p>
<p>and on clinical grounds to enable specialist care to be arranged and provided more </p>
<p>consistently.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> He subsequently stated:</p>
<p>“I had general agreement when I was in office that that was what was required, but </p>
<p>it needs giving effect to, and there are ongoing issues that can be only addressed </p>

<p>in my view by treating them as a group … for example, giving them the advanced </p>
<p>prostheses in the future, giving them access to new techniques that are becoming </p>
<p>available as a result of research.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Clinical developments during Op TELIC</b></p>
<p>The MOD told the Inquiry that it had identified five major “lessons” from the provision </p>
<p>of medical care during Op TELIC, and had incorporated those lessons into its medical </p>
<p>procedures.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> The lessons were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Novel haemostatics. Experience during Op TELIC showed that control of </p>
<p>catastrophic bleeding in the first 10 minutes after wounding led to a significant </p>
<p>improvements in mortality and morbidity rates. New blood clotting agents, </p>
<p>the Combat Applied Tourniquet, and an improved First Field dressing were </p>
<p>introduced to arrest the flow of blood more effectively.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Medical Emergency Response Teams (MERTs). Experience during Op TELIC </p>
<p>led to the creation of Immediate Response Teams (IRTs), to deliver medical care </p>
<p>at the point of wounding. The concept was developed into MERTs, which deliver </p>
<p>consultant-led, pre-hospital emergency care. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The introduction of a more capable “ground evacuation platform” (based on the </p>
<p>Mastiff) which improved soldiers’ confidence in the casualty evacuation chain </p>
<p>and significantly improved the delivery of medical care during evacuation. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The introduction of digital imaging which allowed casualties to be diagnosed </p>
<p>more quickly and more accurately. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The development of an enhanced system for capturing medical data from </p>
<p>all parts of the operational medical chain which improved casualty care and </p>
<p>treatment regimes. </p>
<p>The Inquiry asked Lt Gen Lillywhite what the MOD had learned from Op TELIC about </p>
<p>trauma care.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> Lt Gen Lillywhite highlighted three areas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to save life at the point of injury, including through the use of haemostatic </p>
<p>dressings and massive transfusion protocols; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to sustain the quality of life of seriously injured individuals into the long </p>
<p>term; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pain management. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lillywhite added that those advances, and others, were being transferred to civilian </p>
<p>medicine.</p>

<p><b>Research into the physical and psychological health of  </b></p>
<p><b>Operation TELIC personnel</b></p>
<p><b>97. </b> Following a meeting of the Veterans Task Force on 10 April 2003, and as major </p>
<p>combat operations in Iraq continued, Dr Lewis Moonie, the Parliamentary Under </p>
<p>Secretary of State for Defence, discussed with MOD officials the value of initiating a </p>
<p>long-term study of the health of Op TELIC veterans.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>98. </b> In early May, an MOD official asked Dr Moonie to agree that the UK Government </p>
<p>should support a large-scale programme of research on the physical and psychological </p>
<p>health of personnel deployed on Op TELIC.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The cost could not yet be precisely </p>
<p>estimated, but could be around £3m. </p>
<p><b>99. </b> The official commented that the UK Government had moved “far too late” to initiate </p>
<p>research programmes after the 1990/1991 Gulf Conflict, leading to a loss of trust from </p>
<p>veterans and the public:</p>
<p>“By the time we [the Government] responded concern was widespread and the </p>
<p>idea of a ‘Gulf War Syndrome’, for which there is still no scientific evidence, had </p>
<p>taken root. </p>
<p>“We therefore need to act early this time and put in place as soon as possible a </p>
<p>robust programme of research … and respond as necessary.”</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Dr Moonie agreed that recommendation.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>101. </b> The MOD subsequently commissioned the King’s Centre for Military Health </p>
<p>Research (the King’s Centre) at King’s College London to undertake a large-scale </p>
<p>epidemiological study into the physical and psychological health of personnel deployed </p>
<p>on Op TELIC.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> The “primary objectives” of the study were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to assess the physical and psychological health of personnel deployed on </p>
<p>Op TELIC in comparison with personnel not deployed on Op TELIC; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to ascertain whether an “Iraqi War Syndrome” had emerged following </p>

<p>to assess risk-taking behaviours (alcohol consumption and risky driving) in </p>
<p>personnel deployed on Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> In December 2003, the MOD published a report on lessons it had drawn from </p>
<p>operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> The report provided a brief update on the King’s College work, </p>
<p>and concluded that “to date, we are not aware of any unusual pattern of ill-health in </p>
<p>returning personnel”.</p>
<p><b>104. </b> The initial findings of the King’s College research were published in May 2006. </p>
<p><b>Over-Arching Review of Operational Stress Management</b></p>
<p>The MOD completed its Over-Arching Review of Operational Stress Management </p>
<p>(OROSM) in September 2004, and a second phase covering Training and </p>
<p>Communications Strategies in April 2005. </p>
<p>The OROSM defined six steps in operational stress management: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pre-service entry beliefs and attitudes; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in-service training and promotion courses for career development; </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>operational deployment; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>post-operational recovery; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>on discharge from the Armed Forces. </p>
<p>Implementation and delivery of operational stress management within that framework </p>
<p>remained the responsibility of the individual Services. </p>
<p>The OROSM clearly identified operational stress management as a management, rather </p>
<p>than a medical, responsibility. </p>
<p><b>Decompression</b></p>
<p><b>105. </b> Over the course of Op TELIC, in addition to the requirement for a period of </p>
<p>“normalisation” at the end of an operational tour, commanders increasingly opted for </p>
<p>their units to undertake a formal period of decompression at the end of an operational </p>
<p>tour, as part of post-operational stress management.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Decompression involved “placing groups into a structured and – critically – </p>
<p>monitored environment in which to begin winding down and rehabilitating to a normal, </p>
<p>routine, peacetime environment”. Any individual considered to be vulnerable to any form </p>

<p>of post-operational stress should be identified, so that the appropriate support could be </p>
<p>provided as the individuals passed through the demobilisation process.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>107. </b> The MOD assessed that decompression was best suited to formed teams </p>
<p>and units.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> Where possible, units should include individual augmentees (including </p>
<p>Reservists) in their decompression arrangements. In the cases of individuals who were </p>
<p>not available for the decompression period, the “clinically relevant” elements of the </p>
<p>decompression process could be covered by pre-departure briefings and the subsequent </p>
<p>normalisation period. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> For Army units on Op TELIC, decompression usually took place in Cyprus over a </p>
<p>period of 36 hours.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> The first formal period of decompression took place in 2004, at the end of </p>
<p>Op TELIC 3.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>110. </b> By July 2007, the MOD’s policy was that formed units should have a period of </p>
<p>decompression unless a formal application to opt out had been agreed by the chain </p>
<p>of command.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> Air Marshal (AM) David Pocock, the Deputy Chief of Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Personnel), advised Gen Granville-Chapman that, in the absence of evidence of </p>
<p>“clinical efficacy”, the policy was based on the “military judgement” that decompression </p>
<p>promoted adjustment and re-integration into a normal environment. </p>
<p><b>111. </b> In August 2010, the MOD produced an analysis of Op TELIC from a Land </p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> The analysis stated that many units reported that individual augmentees </p>
<p>and members of the TA could “fall between the cracks” and not carry out decompression. </p>
<p>Some units reported that members of the TA could not remain with the unit during </p>
<p>normalisation when it took place in the unit’s barracks, and therefore went home. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> The MOD concluded:</p>
<p>“… a debate remains to be had about whether the main effort for Reservists should </p>
<p>be to return them to civilian life as quickly as possible or extend their period in </p>
<p>mobilised service to effect full normalisation … What is vital is to ensure that all </p>
<p>TA Personnel are given adequate transition back to civilian life, and this includes </p>
<p>important information on where to get assistance if he/she needs it. POSM [Post-</p>

<p><b>Variations in the level of support after an operational deployment</b></p>
<p><b>113. </b> The Inquiry heard from a number of veterans and witnesses that the level of </p>
<p>support received by personnel returning from Op TELIC varied significantly.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> The Inquiry asked Lieutenant General Sir Alistair Irwin, Adjutant General from 2003 </p>
<p>to 2005, whether he was aware of that variation and, if so, what was done to address it.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we were aware that there were varying standards … That was obviously a worry </p>
<p>because, where the standard was good, that was fine. Where the standard was not </p>
<p>good, then something clearly needed to be done about it.</p>
<p>“So there was a constant interchange between my people, who were producing the </p>
<p>advice, the guidance, the policy, and the people who were actually delivering these </p>
<p>things, which were … the welfare staffs … the field Army and the chain of command. </p>
<p>“… there was, amongst us all collectively, a desire to deliver as good a product </p>
<p>as we could for those who needed it but, when it boils down to it, when you have </p>
<p>a complex machine that consists of over 100,000 individual people, you can be </p>
<p>absolutely certain, no matter what it is that you do, that there will be people who one </p>
<p>way or another don’t live up to the standard required. </p>
<p>“So much to the regret of all of us involved, there were unquestionably people who </p>
<p>weren’t looked after as well as they should have been. There is no doubt about that </p>
<p>and each one of them represents, in some degree or another, a failure.</p>
<p>“I hope, though … without in any way wanting to sound complacent about it, that that </p>
<p>number was probably relatively small.”</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Lt Gen Irwin agreed that those individuals were more likely to have returned to </p>
<p>environments without significant military support around them, including Reservists </p>
<p>returning to civilian life and Regular Personnel living away from barracks. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Vice Admiral Peter Wilkinson, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel) </p>
<p>from 2007, told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Certainly, when we started the campaign, we were much more adept at looking </p>
<p>after the large, formed units than we were on those individuals who had either gone </p>
<p>out as single staff or on an augmentee basis.</p>
<p>“I think, as we have gained greater experience of the operation and of the likely </p>
<p>pressures on the troops, then we have become more adept and more proactive at </p>
<p>looking after their likely needs.”</p>

<p><b>First reports from the King’s Centre study</b></p>
<p><b>117. </b> Professor Simon Wessely and Professor Christopher Dandeker presented the early </p>
<p>findings of the King’s Centre study to the 25 May 2005 meeting of the Service Personnel </p>
<p>Board (SPB).</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> The record of the meeting reported:</p>
<p>“The initial observations suggest that for Regulars, there was no Iraqi War </p>
<p>syndrome, no increases in general mental health problems and PTSD [Post-</p>
<p>Traumatic Stress Disorder], or increases in alcohol intake. These observations were </p>
<p>different to Op GRANBY [the 1990/1991 Gulf Conflict]. For Reservists, there have </p>
<p>been increases in general mental health problems and a doubling of PTSD, but no </p>
<p>increase in alcohol intake.” </p>
<p><b>118. </b> Two papers from the King’s Centre study into the physical and psychological health </p>
<p>of personnel deployed on Op TELIC were published in May 2006. </p>
<p><b>119. </b> The first paper concluded that for Regular Personnel, deployment to Iraq had not, </p>
<p>so far, been associated with significantly worse health outcomes, apart from a modest </p>
<p>effect on multiple physical symptoms.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> There was, however, evidence of a clinically and </p>
<p>statistically significant effect on the health of Reservists, in relation to PTSD symptoms, </p>
<p>multiple physical symptoms, and general perceptions of health. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> The second paper concluded that there had been no substantial increase in </p>
<p>symptomatic ill-health amongst members of the Regular Armed Forces who had taken </p>
<p>part in the invasion of Iraq, and there was no pattern suggestive of a new syndrome.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That finding was in contrast to the situation after the 1990/1991 Gulf Conflict, when a </p>
<p>substantial increase in symptomatic ill-health had been observed.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> On 16 May, Mr Tom Watson, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for </p>
<p>Defence, set the conclusions of the papers and the Government’s response in a written </p>
<p>statement to Parliament: </p>
<p>“… a small but measurable number of Reservists (when compared either with </p>
<p>Regulars who did deploy or Reservists who did not deploy) are showing some </p>
<p>increased health effects as a result of deployment – particularly for common mental </p>
<p>disorders (such as anxiety, depression and stress), post traumatic stress disorder </p>
<p>and fatigue. It remains the case, though, that the reported rates of indicators of </p>
<p>common mental ill-health for both Reservists and Regulars are broadly of the same </p>
<p>order as found in the general UK population.”</p>

<p><b>122. </b> Mr Watson described the issue of Reservists’ mental health as the “key finding” </p>
<p>of the study, advised that the Government was already monitoring the issue closely </p>
<p>and looking at possible solutions, and announced that the Government would introduce </p>
<p>an enhanced post-operational mental health programme for recently demobilised </p>
<p>Reservists later in the year.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that there might be several reasons why </p>
<p>Reservists might suffer more from mental health issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>less preparatory training throughout their careers than Regular Personnel; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a less supportive environment for the families of Reservists than for Regular </p>
<p>Personnel; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a less robust selection process; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an absence of “ongoing support from their peers” when Reservists left the </p>
<p>military environment and returned to civilian life.</p>

<p><b>Reserves Mental Health Programme</b></p>
<p><b>125. </b> In November 2006, in response to the findings of the King’s Centre study, the MOD </p>
<p>launched the Reserves Mental Health Programme (RMHP), to provide enhanced mental </p>
<p>healthcare to current and former Reservists who had been demobilised since 1 January </p>
<p>2003 following deployment on an overseas operation.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>126. </b> The RMHP provided a mental health assessment and, if appropriate, out-patient </p>
<p>treatment at one of the MOD’s Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMHs). </p>
<p>In-patient treatment was provided through the NHS. </p>
<p><b>127. </b> The MOD assessed that there could be, in the worse case, a “backlog” of 680 </p>
<p>individuals (who had been demobilised since 1 January 2003 and who had concerns </p>
<p>over their mental health), who would be referred to the RMHP when it launched.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thereafter the RMHP was expected to receive 75 referrals a year. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> A 2011 study concluded that the RMHP was an effective method of treatment for </p>
<p>those who accessed it.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>Concerns over mental health issues, late 2006</b></p>
<p><b>129. </b> Section 16.1 describes the concerns of General Sir Richard Dannatt, Chief of the </p>
<p>General Staff (CGS) from August 2006, that the Army was “running hot” and the military </p>
<p>covenant was out of balance.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Gen Dannatt visited Iraq in late September 2006.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> His report to Air Chief Marshal </p>
<p>Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), highlighted the psychological welfare of </p>
<p>Service Personnel as one area where action was required: </p>
<p>“I was concerned to hear that there had been 99 referrals to the Field Mental </p>
<p>Health Team from 20 Bde alone during their tour. This number seems high, though </p>
<p>I suspect as people start returning to Iraq (or Afghanistan) for the third or fourth time </p>
<p>it will not be atypical. I am aware … that we do not equip our soldiers as well as </p>
<p>we might during their pre-deployment training for the combat stress of operations. </p>
<p>I am discussing this with AG [the Adjutant General, Lt Gen Viggers], and we will </p>
<p>shortly be taking steps to improve our commanders’ understanding of, and ability </p>
<p>to deal with, psychiatric casualties in theatre. I will ensure that this work informs </p>
<p>DCDS(Personnel)’s Overarching Review of Operational Stress Management.</p>
<p>“I am less sanguine, however, about what happens to psychological casualties </p>
<p>evacuated back to UK – in the case of 20 Bde about 20 individuals. As I understand </p>
<p>it, once in the UK these casualties are managed by The Priory, a civilian contractor, </p>
<p>for psychiatric treatment. Not only do we tend to lose track of these casualties </p>
<p>thereafter, but I feel intuitively that rustication from a military environment is </p>
<p>hardly the best way to treat all but the very worst of our stress casualties. Indeed, </p>
<p>experience from recent major conflicts tells us that soldiers suffering from combat </p>
<p>stress are best treated in as military an environment as possible. Once the </p>
<p>psychological props of discipline, esprit de corps, ethos and humour are removed, </p>
<p>the road to recovery for stress casualties grows that much longer. Now that we have </p>
<p>decided, quite rightly, to run RCDM Birmingham on more military lines,</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> we should </p>
<p>at least ask ourselves similar questions over our care of psychiatric casualties.”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Gen Dannatt subsequently tasked Major General Mark Mans, the Deputy Adjutant </p>
<p>General (DAG), to address those concerns.</p>

<p><b>132. </b> Mr Ingram visited Iraq from 30 September to 1 October.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> His Private Secretary </p>
<p>reported that three concerns had been raised with Mr Ingram with regard to “psychiatric </p>
<p>treatment”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was an “apparent upward trend (if not surge)” in the number of people </p>
<p>requiring support in the second half of six-month tours.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US provided “significantly more in-theatre welfare/counselling support” than </p>
<p>the UK (although the US deployed personnel for longer than the UK). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Personnel evacuated back to the UK to receive treatment at The Priory had, </p>
<p>from their unit’s perspective, been “‘lost’ for weeks at a time”.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Maj Gen Mans replied to Gen Dannatt on 30 November, advising that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The high level of psychiatric casualties being referred to the Field Mental </p>
<p>Health Team (FMHT) was a positive feature rather than a cause for concern, </p>
<p>as it reflected a willingness by personnel to consult the FMHT. The number of </p>
<p>personnel evacuated from theatre was lower than might be expected from the </p>
<p>number of referrals to the FMHT.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The current system for providing care for personnel evacuated from theatre with </p>
<p>mental health problems (treatment at The Priory and/or the MOD’s Departments </p>
<p>of Community Mental Health) conformed to psychiatric best practice. The </p>
<p>recently activated RMHP would also help.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regarding commanders’ understanding of and ability to deal with psychiatric </p>
<p>issues, the OROSM had recommended that personnel receive stress </p>
<p>management training at points throughout their career. This recommendation </p>
<p>had been partially implemented; full implementation required resources and </p>
<p>training time.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>134. </b> In November, Mr Derek Twigg, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for </p>
<p>Defence, expressed his concern that the MOD was not providing a “comprehensive </p>
<p>rehabilitation package” for personnel returning from operations.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>135. </b> AM Pocock responded in December.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> He advised that a forecast that the current </p>
<p>downward trend in Road Traffic Accidents would stall, and a recent King’s Centre paper </p>
<p>indicating an increased tendency towards risk-taking behaviour after deployment, </p>
<p>both supported Mr Twigg’s “nagging concern” that the MOD might not be providing the </p>
<p>support that personnel (including Regulars, Reservists, formed units, individuals, and </p>
<p>individuals who had been medically evacuated) required.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>136. </b> AM Pocock set out the six-step process defined by the MOD’s Operational Stress </p>
<p>Management Policy and highlighted the role of decompression as one element of </p>
<p>step 5 (post-operational recovery). Work to evaluate the effectiveness of decompression </p>
<p>was under way. </p>
<p><b>137. </b> In July 2007, AM Pocock advised Gen Granville-Chapman that, following the </p>
<p>2005 OROSM review, the MOD’s policy on operational stress management was “both </p>
<p>comprehensive and robust”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> The MOD had now undertaken an analysis within the </p>
<p>three Services and the Civil Service of how much training for operational stress was </p>
<p>available and how effective it was. This “gap analysis” indicated that the three Services </p>
<p>“already do much to address [operational stress management] training needs”. A bid for </p>
<p>resources to plug the gaps, including the wider implementation of the Royal Marines’ </p>
<p>Trauma Risk Management programme proposed by the Army, would be submitted. </p>
<p><b>Trauma Risk Management</b></p>
<p><b>138. </b> In 2008, the Armed Forces rolled out Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) in all </p>
<p>three Services.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>139. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite described TRiM as a form of debriefing after a traumatic event,</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p>but undertaken in peer groups rather than by an external counsellor. The person who </p>
<p>was leading the debriefing was taught to identify whether their colleagues were under </p>

<p>or Afghanistan. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The rate of symptoms of PTSD remained “relatively low” among Regular </p>
<p>Personnel deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan; estimates ranged between 1.3 and </p>
<p>4.8 percent following deployment. The rate of symptoms of PTSD in the general </p>
<p>UK population was approximately 3 percent. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between 16 and 20 percent of Regular Personnel reported common mental </p>
<p>disorders, such as depression and anxiety. This was similar to the rate in the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Alcohol misuse was a common problem among Regular Personnel deployed </p>
<p>to Iraq and Afghanistan. In the first phase of the King’s Centre study (2003 </p>
<p>to 2006), only “combat troops” were found to have a higher prevalence of </p>
<p>alcohol misuse following deployment to Iraq. Later analyses showed a higher </p>
<p>prevalence of alcohol misuse among all Regular Personnel who were deployed </p>
<p>to Iraq or Afghanistan, regardless of their role on deployment. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Combat troops” deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan showed a small but significant </p>
<p>increase in the risk of symptoms of PTSD compared with non-combat troops. </p>
<p>Approximately 7 percent of combat troops had symptoms of PTSD following </p>
<p>deployment. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reservists deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan were at a higher risk of reporting </p>
<p>symptoms of PTSD, when compared with Reservists not deployed to Iraq or </p>
<p>Afghanistan. The King’s Centre commented that many factors could contribute to </p>
<p>the excess of mental ill-health observed in deployed Reservists, including their </p>
<p>relative inexperience of combat operations, lower unit cohesion, and problems in </p>
<p>the home and work environment during or after deployment. The King’s Centre </p>
<p>also commented that despite the introduction of measures focused on helping </p>
<p>Reservists (including the RMHP and better support for Reservists’ families), </p>
<p>the excess of mental health problems (specifically PTSD) observed among </p>
<p>Reservists deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan was “disappointingly persistent”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Multiple deployments were not consistently associated with an increased risk of </p>
<p>mental health problems. However, the cumulative duration of deployments did </p>
<p>affect mental health; if troops deployed for more than 13 months over a three-</p>
<p>year period they were at increased risk of mental health problems, particularly </p>
<p>an increased risk of PTSD symptoms. The King’s Centre commented that the </p>
<p>finding supported the MOD’s Harmony Guidelines for Army Personnel. Ensuring </p>
<p>that the Guidelines were not exceeded could help to reduce the risk of mental </p>
<p>health problems in the UK’s Regular forces. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regular Personnel were at increased risk of alcohol misuse and PTSD </p>
<p>symptoms where the tour length was extended during the deployment itself.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>141. </b> The King’s Centre concluded:</p>
<p>“Despite extended campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, the prevalence of mental </p>
<p>disorders in the UK’s Armed Forces remains low. PTSD is in fact an issue for a </p>
<p>relatively small proportion of military personnel. Of particular concern, however, are </p>
<p>the high levels of alcohol misuse in Regulars, the mental health of combat troops </p>
<p>and also the mental health of Reservists. These three issues require attention over </p>
<p>the coming years.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>The Harmony Guidelines and mental health</b></p>
<p>Professor Christopher Dandeker, Professor of Military Sociology at King’s College London </p>
<p>and Co-Director of the King’s Centre for Military Health Research, told the House of </p>
<p>Commons Defence Committee in March 2008 that:</p>
<p>“… so far as our own research is concerned … I think that the Harmony Guidelines </p>
<p>have been well constructed because the evidence suggests that if you stay within </p>
<p>them they [Service Personnel] do not suffer; if you go beyond them there is a 20 to </p>
<p>50 percent likelihood that they will suffer in terms of PTSD [Post Traumatic Stress </p>
<p>Disorder]”.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his evidence to the Inquiry, Air Marshal David Pocock, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Personnel) from 2005 to 2007, questioned whether Professor Dandeker was right </p>
<p>to suggest that the Harmony Guidelines were an appropriate basis for assessing the </p>
<p>effect of operational deployment on individuals.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> The Guidelines had been derived in </p>
<p>a straightforward way from the planning assumptions used in SDR 98 (‘what operations </p>
<p>have we got? How many people have we got? … that means that they can spend this long </p>
<p>away’). AM Pocock said that his focus had been on the broader relationship between time </p>
<p>deployed on operations and the risk of mental health issues. </p>
<p><b>142. </b> The Inquiry asked Lt Gen Lillywhite how the MOD’s approach to mental health had </p>
<p>changed over the course of Op TELIC.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>143. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that the “perennial challenge” was to overcome </p>
<p>the stigma associated with mental health issues:</p>
<p>“A lot of effort has gone into educating both commanders and individuals that </p>
<p>psychological adverse effects is not something that needs to be hidden. We have </p>
<p>not fully succeeded, nor has any other nation, and neither has the civilian population. </p>
<p>Mental health continues to have a stigma amongst many that actually inhibits its </p>
<p>presenting for care early.”</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite highlighted the introduction of a decompression period after </p>
<p>an operational deployment and TRiM, as two significant developments in the MOD’s </p>
<p>approach to supporting mental health. </p>

<p><b>146. </b> For illnesses and injuries caused before 6 April 2005, compensation was provided </p>
<p>under two separate compensation arrangements, the War Pensions Scheme (WPS) and </p>
<p>the Armed Forces Pension Scheme 1975 (AFPS 75). </p>
<p><b>147. </b> In September 2003, after a consultative process which began in 2001, the </p>
<p>Government announced that it would introduce a new Armed Forces Pension </p>
<p>Scheme (AFPS 05) (see Section 16.1) and a new compensation scheme.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> The new </p>
<p>compensation scheme would be introduced in April 2005 and would replace provisions </p>
<p>under the War Pensions Scheme and attributable benefits under AFPS 75. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> Mr Ivor Caplin, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence, told </p>
<p>Parliament that the new compensation scheme would have “more focus on the more </p>
<p>severely disabled” and would provide a lump-sum payment for “pain and suffering” – </p>
<p>a benefit that was not available under the current arrangements. </p>
<p><b>149. </b> The new compensation scheme – the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme </p>
<p>(AFCS) – was introduced on 6 April 2005.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> The AFCS: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Provided compensation for any injury, illness or death which was caused by </p>
<p>service on or after 6 April 2005. That included injury or illness which occurred </p>
<p>while participating in a “service related activity”, such as organised sport.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Covered all current and former members of the Armed Forces, including </p>
<p>Reservists. For the first time, serving members of the Armed Forces could </p>
<p>make claims. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of service-related death, paid benefits to eligible partners and </p>
<p>children. An eligible partner was described as “someone with whom you are </p>
<p>cohabiting in an exclusive and substantial relationship, with financial and </p>
<p>wider dependence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Provided lump sum payments and, for the most severe injuries and illnesses, </p>
<p>Guaranteed Income Payments (GIPs) to provide a regular income stream. </p>
<p>Those payments were made according to a comprehensive tariff reflecting, for </p>
<p>lump-sum payments, the severity of the injury or illness and, for GIPs, estimated </p>
<p>loss of future earnings. The most severe injuries and illnesses qualified for a </p>
<p>lump-sum payment of £285,000.</p>

<p>Afghanistan, losing both his legs and suffering a brain injury and multiple other serious </p>

<p>108</p>
<p> The <i>BBC</i> reported that he had been awarded £152,150 in compensation. </p>
<p><b>151. </b> In February 2008, the MOD amended the AFCS to take account of individuals </p>
<p>who had suffered more than one injury in a single incident and to increase the lump-</p>
<p>sum payments to those with the most serious multiple injuries (within the £285,000 </p>
<p>maximum).</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> The MOD stated that, when the AFCS was developed, the MOD had </p>
<p>not envisaged the “severe, multiple injury cases of the type that are now unfortunately </p>
<p>occurring”. The changes enabled the AFCS to respond to that challenge. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> In July 2008, within the Service Personnel Command Paper, the Government </p>
<p>doubled the lump-sum payment for the most serious injuries, from £285,000 to </p>
<p>£570,000.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> All payments were increased by at least 10 percent. The Government </p>
<p>committed to apply those increases retrospectively to all those who had already made </p>
<p>claims under the AFCS. GIPs remained unchanged.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Ainsworth told the Inquiry that when he pressed for that increase, he had </p>
<p>experienced “some resistance” from some officials in the MOD:</p>

<p>cannot, Minister, double the upfront compensation payment’ … I think he had worked </p>
<p>on the scheme for quite some time and was pretty dedicated to it, and he knew </p>
<p>some of the other consequences of doubling the upfront payment, [that] potentially </p>
<p>it would cause disparities with other people, but my attitude was ‘So what? I can’t </p>
<p>defend the level of upfront payment as it exists today and you do not have to, and </p>
<p>you are not injured and we are going to double it’, and we did.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Further increases in lump-sum payments (though not to the maximum amount) </p>
<p>and to GIPs, and changes to the operation of the AFCS, were made in 2010 following a </p>

<p><b>Support for veterans</b></p>
<p><b>155. </b> In March 2001, the Government launched the Veterans Initiative to identify and </p>
<p>address the needs of veterans, in close partnership with ex-Service organisations.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also announced the appointment of Dr Moonie as the first Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>promoting partnership between the Government and ex-Service organisations. </p>
<p><b>156. </b> In June 2001, the War Pensions Agency was transferred to the MOD and in April </p>
<p>2002 it was re-launched as the Veterans Agency, with a remit to provide financial and </p>
<p>welfare support to all former members of the Armed Forces, their widows/widowers </p>
<p>and dependants. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> The Veterans Agency published the <i>Strategy for Veterans</i> in March 2003, to “help </p>
<p>ensure” a coherent Government policy and a structured plan of action.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> The Strategy </p>
<p>stated that services for veterans were increasingly delivered on a cross-Government </p>
<p>basis, or through a partnership between Government and the private or voluntary </p>
<p>sectors. Partnerships between Government and the voluntary sector should not detract </p>
<p>from the Government’s responsibilities or impinge on charities’ independence. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> The Veterans Agency published the <i>Communications Strategy for Veterans </i>in </p>
<p>September 2003, in response to research commissioned by the MOD that indicated that </p>
<p>many veterans, members of the general public, and “statutory and charitable service </p>
<p>providers” were unaware of the services, advice and support available to veterans.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Mental healthcare for veterans</b></p>
<p><b>159. </b> The Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) was established in 1993 to examine </p>
<p>veterans of the 1990/1991 Gulf Conflict who were concerned that their health had </p>
<p>been adversely affected by their service.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> The majority of cases seen by the MAP </p>
<p>were mental health related and the service evolved into a mental health assessment </p>
<p>programme. The MAP was extended in 2003 to include Op TELIC veterans. </p>
<p><b>160. </b> The MAP provided a thorough assessment by a physician with knowledge of </p>
<p>veterans’ physical and mental health issues. The physician would provide a report for </p>
<p>the referring doctor including any diagnosis made and recommendations for treatment. </p>
<p><b>161. </b> In July 2003, King’s College London published its final report on the delivery </p>
<p>of cross-departmental support and service to veterans.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> The study (which ran from </p>
<p>July 2002 to March 2003) had been commissioned by the MOD to examine key </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Key findings from the study included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was very little published information on the experience of UK veterans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For “many (indeed most)” personnel, military life was a positive experience.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Most veterans did not develop mental health problems as a result of serving in </p>
<p>the Armed Forces. The minority of veterans who did, fared badly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been a decline in “civilian-military understanding”, which adversely </p>
<p>affected veterans’ dealings with Local Authorities and Social Services. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Only half of veterans with mental health problems were currently seeking help. </p>
<p>Of those who had sought help, many were receiving anti-depressant therapies </p>
<p>but few were receiving specialist advice or treatment.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Community mental health pilots</b></p>
<p><b>163. </b> In 2005, following recommendations on mental health services for veterans </p>
<p>presented by the independent Health and Social Care Advisory Service (HASCAS), </p>
<p>the MOD, in collaboration with the DoH and the Devolved Administrations, launched </p>
<p>six community NHS mental health pilots.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> The purpose of the pilots was to provide </p>
<p>expert, evidence-based assessment and treatment, led by a mental health therapist </p>
<p>with an understanding of the issues faced by veterans, and to improve local health </p>
<p>professionals’ awareness and understanding of veterans and military life.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> The first pilot, in Stafford, started in November 2007; the sixth pilot, in Edinburgh, </p>
<p>started in April 2009.</p>
<p><b>Priority treatment within the NHS</b></p>
<p><b>165. </b> From 1953, it was Government policy that war pensioners (not all ex-Service </p>
<p>Personnel) should receive priority examination and treatment within the NHS for the </p>
<p>condition for which they received a pension or gratuity.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>166. </b> In spring 2007, in response to a series of Parliamentary questions on the efficacy </p>
<p>of the arrangements underpinning that policy, the MOD tasked the Service Personnel </p>
<p>and Veterans Agency (SPVA) to record all complaints relating to priority access. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> In June 2007, a junior MOD official advised Gen Dannatt that the arrangements for </p>
<p>ensuring priority access had several “inherent weaknesses”: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD owned the policy but was reliant on the DoH for delivery. The DoH did </p>
<p>not regularly remind NHS clinicians and GPs of the policy. Even when clinicians </p>

<p>73</p>
<p>and GPs were aware of the policy, the allocation of priority treatment was </p>
<p>determined by a number of factors. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The arrangement between the MOD and the DoH had never been formalised, </p>
<p>but was rather a “gentleman’s agreement”. “Priority access” had never been </p>
<p>defined.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD did not regularly remind war pensioners of their right to priority access. </p>
<p><b>168. </b> The official stated that the only alternative to the current arrangement, the </p>
<p>provision of treatment in the private sector, was unlikely to be affordable. To mitigate </p>
<p>the weaknesses of the current arrangement, the MOD’s current level of engagement </p>
<p>with the DoH, including at Ministerial level, should be sustained. The information that </p>
<p>was now being collected by the SPVA would, in the future, allow better analysis and </p>
<p>“evidence-based” action. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> On 23 November, Mr Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary, and Mr Derek Twigg, </p>
<p>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence and the Minister for Veterans, </p>
<p>announced that the NHS would provide priority treatment for all veterans (not just </p>
<p>those in receipt of war pensions), whose ill-health or injuries were attributed to their </p>
<p>military service.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>170. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that the arrangement on priority access was of </p>
<p>limited – but some – utility to veterans.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>171. </b> In July 2008, the Government published a command paper entitled <i>The Nation’s </i></p>
<p><i>Commitment: Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and </i></p>
<p><i>Veterans </i>(known as the <i>Service Personnel Command Paper</i>).</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><i> </i>The paper contained a </p>
<p>number of measures to address the disadvantages experienced by veterans, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment that the standard of prosthetic limbs provided to veterans by the </p>
<p>NHS, would match or exceed the standard of limbs provided to injured personnel </p>
<p>by the DMS;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment to raise awareness amongst healthcare professionals of the </p>
<p>healthcare needs of veterans; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>funding for supported housing for Service leavers; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment to fund tuition fees in further and higher education for Service </p>
<p>leavers; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>measures to improve veterans’ access to transport and employment </p>
<p>opportunities.</p>
