<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses analysis and findings in relation to the evidence set out in </p>
<p>Sections 16.1 to 16.3, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the pressures on Service Personnel, and the welfare support provided to them </p>
<p>and their families;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the arrangements for providing medical care to Service Personnel; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the arrangements for investigating the deaths of Service Personnel who lost </p>
<p>their lives on Operation TELIC and the support provided for bereaved families.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The provision of military equipment is addressed in Sections 6.3 and 14.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In 2002, the UK military was already operating at, and in some cases beyond, the </p>
<p>limits of the guidelines agreed in the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review.</i> As a result, the </p>
<p>Harmony Guidelines were being breached for some units and specialist trades.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government’s decision to contribute a military force to a US-led invasion of Iraq </p>
<p>inevitably increased the risk that more Service Personnel would be put in breach of </p>
<p>the Harmony Guidelines. The issue of the potential pressure on Service Personnel </p>
<p>was not a consideration in the decision.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD planned and prepared effectively to provide medical care in support of </p>
<p>Operation TELIC.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were major improvements in the provision of medical care, mental healthcare </p>
<p>and rehabilitative care available to Service Personnel over the course of Op TELIC.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Most of the contacts between the MOD and bereaved families were conducted with </p>
<p>sensitivity. In a few cases, they were not. The MOD progressively improved how it </p>
<p>engaged with and supported bereaved families, in part driven by consistent public </p>
<p>and Ministerial pressure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government’s decision in 2006 to deploy a second medium scale force </p>
<p>to Helmand province in Afghanistan further increased the pressure on Service </p>
<p>Personnel, on elements of the MOD’s welfare, medical and investigative systems, </p>
<p>and on the coronial system.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Much of the MOD’s and the Government’s effort from 2006 was focused on </p>
<p>addressing those pressures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD should have planned and prepared to address those pressures, rather than </p>
<p>react to them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government should have acted sooner to address the backlog of inquests  </p>
<p>into the deaths of Service Personnel. The support it did provide, in June 2006, </p>
<p>cleared the backlog.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD made a number of improvements to the Board of Inquiry process, but </p>
<p>some proposals for more substantive reform (including the introduction of an </p>
<p>independent member) were not fully explored. The MOD significantly improved the </p>
<p>way it communicated with and supported bereaved families in relation to military </p>
<p>investigations and inquests.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD was less effective at providing support to Service Personnel who were </p>
<p>mobilised individually (a category which included almost all Reservists) and their </p>
<p>families, than to formed units.</p>
<p><b>The pressure on Service Personnel</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> In 2002, the UK military was already operating at, and in some cases beyond, the </p>
<p>limits of the guidelines agreed in the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review</i>. As a result, the </p>
<p>Services’ Harmony Guidelines (which defined how much time a member of a particular </p>
<p>Service should spend away from home and the period between tours) were being </p>
<p>breached for some units and specialist trades.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The Government’s decision to contribute a military force to a US-led invasion of Iraq </p>
<p>inevitably increased the risk that the Harmony Guidelines would be breached.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> There are no indications that the potential pressure on Service Personnel was </p>
<p>a consideration in the Government’s decision to contribute a military force, and in </p>
<p>particular a large scale land force (a division), to a US-led invasion of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Inquiry concludes in Section 9.8 that, throughout 2004 and 2005, it appears that </p>
<p>senior members of the Armed Forces reached the view that there was little more that </p>
<p>would be achieved in southern Iraq and that it would make more sense to concentrate </p>
<p>UK military effort on Afghanistan where it might have greater effect.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> In July 2005, Ministers agreed in principle proposals presented by Dr John Reid, the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary, both for the transfer to Iraqi control of the four provinces in southern </p>
<p>Iraq for which the UK had security responsibility, and for the redeployment of the UK </p>
<p>effort in Afghanistan from the north to Helmand province in the south (see Section 9.4). </p>
<p>The proposals were based on high-risk assumptions about the capability of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces to take the lead for security.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> In January 2006, Cabinet approved the deployment of a UK military force to </p>
<p>Helmand.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The MOD’s formal advice to Dr Reid was that this deployment was “achievable </p>
<p>without serious damage to Harmony”, although certain units and specialists would be </p>
<p>“placed under increased, but manageable, stress”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>10. </b> There were different views within the MOD over the effect of the deployment </p>
<p>on personnel. Lieutenant General Anthony Palmer, Deputy Chief of the Defence </p>
<p>Staff (Personnel) from 2002 to August 2005, told the Inquiry that, as he left post, </p>
<p>he expressed his concern that deploying two brigades simultaneously (to Iraq and </p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Minute Hutton to APS/SofS [MOD], 17 January 2006, ‘Afghanistan Deployments’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Afghanistan) would breach the Harmony Guidelines and the Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions, and was “too big a risk”.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary from 2001 to 2005, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was apprehensive [about the deployment of UK forces to Helmand] and I made my </p>
<p>concerns known to my planning staff and to the Chiefs of Staff. I think their view was </p>
<p>that they could do it and it was manageable ... since it was [the Chiefs of Staff] who </p>
<p>would actually have to ensure they could do this, I did not press my objections fully.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The impact of the decision on the availability of key equipment capabilities for Iraq is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 14.1.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The force began to deploy to Helmand in May 2006.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> At the end of August, General Sir Richard Dannatt, Chief of the General Staff, </p>
<p>advised Mr Des Browne, the newly appointed Defence Secretary, that “as an Army, we </p>
<p>are running hot”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> With operational deployments well above the levels set out in the </p>
<p>1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review</i> and the MOD’s own Harmony Guidelines, the Army’s </p>
<p>demands on soldiers were greater than its ability to look after them.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry that the military covenant had “fallen out of balance ... </p>
<p>as a consequence of decisions taken to stay in Iraq until we had successfully completed </p>
<p>our operations there, but also take on Afghanistan as well”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The MOD’s assessment that the Helmand deployment was achievable without </p>
<p>causing a substantial number of personnel to breach the Harmony Guidelines reflected </p>
<p>overly optimistic assumptions about the intensity and duration of operations in Iraq  </p>
<p>and Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The twin deployments challenged the planning assumption agreed in the 1998 </p>
<p><i>Strategic Defence Review</i> that the UK should be able to undertake two medium scale </p>
<p>deployments simultaneously but would not expect both to involve war-fighting or to be </p>
<p>maintained simultaneously for longer than six months.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> It would only have been possible to manage the established Iraq commitment and </p>
<p>the new Helmand commitment, without significantly increasing the pressure on Service </p>
<p>Personnel, if the former was wound down on schedule and the latter was contained. In </p>
<p>the event, it proved difficult to withdraw from Iraq as quickly as hoped while Helmand </p>
<p>developed into a more substantial combat operation than originally envisaged, pushing </p>
<p>up force levels.</p>

<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>19. </b> In addition to increasing the pressure on Service Personnel, the decision to deploy a </p>
<p>second medium scale force increased the pressure on the MOD’s medical, welfare and </p>
<p>investigative systems, and in particular on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the air bridge between Iraq and the UK;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Selly Oak hospital;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Headley Court and other rehabilitation facilities; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Army’s capacity to investigate fatalities and support bereaved families.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> It also increased the pressure on the coronial system.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> From 2006, the efforts of the MOD and the Government would increasingly be </p>
<p>focused on addressing those pressures.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The MOD should have been aware of the potential impacts on its medical, welfare </p>
<p>and investigative systems, and made the necessary contingency plans to increase  </p>
<p>their capacity.</p>
<p><b>Medical care</b></p>
<p><b>23. </b> Op TELIC was the first major military operation after the closure of the military </p>
<p>hospitals in the 1990s and therefore the first test of the new medical arrangements. </p>
<p>Under the new arrangements, many medical Service Personnel (including a large </p>
<p>number of Reservists) were deployed from NHS Trusts for operations in Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan, and military casualties were treated in NHS Trusts.</p>
<p><b>Planning and preparation</b></p>
<p><b>24. </b> In early September 2002, the MOD estimated that between 31 and 48 Service </p>
<p>Personnel would be killed in action during the initial combat phase of operations of an </p>
<p>attack on Iraq, and that between 157 and 241 Service Personnel would be admitted </p>
<p>to Role 3 hospitals</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> (figures exclude possible casualties from chemical and biological </p>
<p>warfare). The MOD regularly updated its casualty estimates as the military plan </p>
<p>developed. The estimates did not consider casualties beyond the initial combat  </p>
<p>phase of operations.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The Chiefs of Staff concluded on 5 February 2003 that a Casualty Estimate paper </p>
<p>including estimated casualty figures, which had been produced by the MOD, would need </p>
<p>to be shown to Ministers before any decision to commit UK troops was made.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> In response to a question from Mr Blair on the possible number of casualties arising </p>
<p>from an attack on Iraq, the MOD advised No.10 on 24 February that there would be </p>
<p>between 30 and 60 British and between 500 and 1,200 Iraqi “land battle” fatalities.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Role 3 (Echelon 3) medical support is generally provided at field hospitals and on hospital ships.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>158</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Lord Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff from 2001 to April 2003, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>Ministers would have been informed of the MOD’s casualty estimates, as part of the </p>
<p>routine briefing process.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Although the Inquiry has seen no evidence that the Casualty Estimate paper was </p>
<p>shown to Ministers, it accepts that Ministers were informed of the MOD’s casualty </p>
<p>estimates.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The MOD established an effective medical capability in theatre to support Op TELIC </p>
<p>by 14 March 2003.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> By 1 May, when President Bush declared that major combat operations in Iraq had </p>
<p>ended, 33 British Service Personnel had died serving on Op TELIC and 81 had been </p>
<p>admitted to Role 3 hospitals.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Casualties would have been much higher if chemical and biological weapons had </p>
<p>been used.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> The MOD planned and prepared effectively to provide medical care in support of </p>
<p>Op TELIC. Although some of the medical equipment and supplies procured by the MOD </p>
<p>arrived in theatre shortly after military operations began, there are no indications that the </p>
<p>quality of clinical care was compromised.</p>
<p><b>Improvements in the provision of care</b></p>
<p><b>33. </b> There were a number of significant improvements to the care provided to Service </p>
<p>Personnel over the course of Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> From June 2006, the MOD, working closely with a number of charities, progressively </p>
<p>enhanced the rehabilitation facilities at Headley Court.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> In August 2006, following visits by MOD Ministers and senior military officers to </p>
<p>injured Service Personnel recovering on civilian wards, the MOD began planning to </p>
<p>establish a Military Managed Ward (MMW) at Selly Oak hospital. The MOD assessed </p>
<p>that, while the quality of clinical care at Selly Oak was excellent, injured Service </p>
<p>Personnel would recover better in what Lieutenant General Louis Lillywhite, the Surgeon </p>
<p>General from 2006 to 2009, described as a “military bubble”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The MMW was established in December 2006 and was fully staffed by July 2007.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Lillywhite highlighted the advances during </p>
<p>Op TELIC in the military’s understanding of how to save life at the point of injury, how </p>
<p>to sustain the quality of life of seriously injured individuals into the long term, and pain </p>
<p>management.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Public hearing, 20 July 2010, pages 33-34.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The advances in the provision of medical care during Op TELIC meant that more </p>
<p>individuals with very serious and complex injuries survived.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> A number of injured veterans shared with the Inquiry their concern that they might </p>
<p>not continue to receive the same quality of care over the long term, and in particular </p>
<p>when they left the military.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Lt Gen Lillywhite told the Inquiry that, in recognition of their service and on clinical </p>
<p>grounds, individuals with very serious injuries should be treated by the Government as a </p>
<p>group with specific clinical needs, to enable specialist care to be arranged and provided </p>
<p>more consistently.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The Government will need to consider how to address the issue of providing </p>
<p>whole-life care to individuals with very serious injuries.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> There were also significant advances in the provision of mental healthcare.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> In April 2003, the MOD commissioned a large-scale, long-term programme of </p>
<p>research on the physical and psychological health of personnel deployed on Op TELIC. </p>
<p>The findings of that programme identified a number of important mental health issues </p>
<p>and informed the MOD’s response to them.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> The Inquiry recommends that the MOD commissions similar studies for future major </p>
<p>operational deployments. In addition to the direct benefits for Service Personnel and  </p>
<p>the MOD, mental health is an area of significant public concern. It is important that the  </p>
<p>MOD is able to demonstrate that the effects of deployments are properly monitored  </p>
<p>and managed.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The major developments in the provision of mental healthcare over the period </p>
<p>covered by the Inquiry were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was increased use of a period of decompression at the end of an </p>
<p>operational tour, as part of post-operational stress management.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In November 2006, in response to the findings of the King’s Centre study that </p>
<p>a number of Reservists were experiencing increased mental health effects </p>
<p>as a result of deployment, the MOD launched the Reserves Mental Health </p>
<p>Programme (RMHP). The RMHP provided enhanced mental healthcare to </p>
<p>current and former Reservists who had been demobilised since 1 January 2003 </p>
<p>following deployment on an overseas operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In November 2007, the MOD launched six community NHS mental health pilot </p>
<p>programmes to provide mental health assessment and treatment for veterans. </p>
<p>The programmes were led by a mental health therapist with an understanding of </p>
<p>the issues faced by veterans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In 2008, the MOD rolled out Trauma Risk Management (TRiM) in all three </p>
<p>Services. TRiM is a form of debriefing after a traumatic event, undertaken in </p>
<p>peer groups rather than with an external counsellor.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>Investigations into the deaths of Service Personnel</b></p>
<p><b>46. </b> Investigations by the MOD and coroners into the deaths of Service Personnel </p>
<p>serving on Op TELIC could be very slow, and in one case lasted for more than </p>
<p>four years.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> The Inquiry considered how the three major elements of the investigative process – </p>
<p>Service Police investigations, Boards of Inquiry (BOIs), and inquests – changed </p>
<p>after 2003.</p>
<p><b>Service Police investigations</b></p>
<p><b>48. </b> The earliest concerns about the military’s investigative process emerged in </p>
<p>September 2003. Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, expressed </p>
<p>his concern that the next of kin of deceased Service Personnel increasingly perceived </p>
<p>that the MOD’s investigations lacked focus and were too slow, and that the MOD did not </p>
<p>keep them informed of progress.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> The following month, Lt Gen Palmer advised that the Army’s Royal Military Police </p>
<p>(RMP) was “swamped” with the volume of work in Iraq.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The major challenge was the </p>
<p>difficult working environment, including the need for force protection for Service Police </p>
<p>and a potentially hostile population. The Army’s policy of holding investigations into all </p>
<p>fatalities added to the pressure on the RMP.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Reviews of Service Police investigations in October 2004 and April 2005 found </p>
<p>that there were still delays in Service Police investigations, but did not recommend any </p>
<p>substantial changes to the investigative process. The October 2004 review concluded </p>
<p>that investigations could be complex and “speed must not be at the expense of quality”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>Boards of Inquiry</b></p>
<p><b>51. </b> The purpose of a military BOI was to establish the facts about an event and to make </p>
<p>recommendations to prevent a recurrence.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> In response to Mr Ingram’s concern over the MOD’s investigative process, the MOD </p>
<p>had, by June 2004:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>shortened the time allowed for completing BOIs to 14 weeks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthened the role of the BOI President;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>introduced measures to improve the management of BOIs by each Service; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>introduced a series of measures to improve communications with bereaved </p>
<p>families on progress with the entire Service Police investigation and BOI </p>
<p>process.</p>

<p>Report Loudon, 12 October 2004, ‘Review of Service Police Investigations on Operations’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>53. </b> MOD Ministers remained closely engaged. From June 2004, Mr Geoff Hoon, the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary, received regular briefings on progress on BOIs and the reasons for </p>
<p>any delays.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> The possibility of adding an independent member to a BOI was raised by Mr Hoon </p>
<p>in June 2004 and by Mr Browne in December 2007. On neither occasion was the idea </p>
<p>considered seriously by the MOD.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The Inquiry recommends that the MOD consider whether an independent member </p>
<p>should sit on BOIs, in particular in order to assure families that the process is as rigorous </p>
<p>and transparent as possible.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> The MOD, and in particular the Army (through the work of the Army Inquiries and </p>
<p>Aftercare Support Cell and Army Inquest Cell), continued to improve the management of </p>
<p>the Service Police investigation and BOI processes, the support provided for bereaved </p>
<p>families, and the support provided for coroners. The Army Inquest Cell provided the </p>
<p>model for the tri-Service Defence Inquests Unit, which was established in May 2008.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> By early 2008, the Army had appointed permanent Presidents to lead high-profile </p>
<p>Army BOIs, and the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force had taken steps to establish pools </p>
<p>of expertise from which Presidents could be selected.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The Inquiry recommends that the MOD consider providing BOI Presidents with </p>
<p>access to expert advisers on process and standards, who would play a role analogous </p>
<p>to Court Clerks, in order to help establish consistency and best practice.</p>
<p>THE CONCERNS OF BEREAVED FAMILIES</p>
<p><b>59. </b> A number of families shared with the Inquiry their concerns over the MOD’s process </p>
<p>for investigating fatalities. The concerns were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military investigations were not sufficiently rigorous, in particular in relation to </p>
<p>incidents where there were suspicions of friendly fire or equipment failure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No action appeared to be taken against individuals as a result of military </p>
<p>investigations (this concern also applied to inquests).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Material had been redacted from the version of the BOI report that families </p>
<p>received, which made the content harder to understand. Some family members </p>
<p>thought that text had been redacted to protect individuals criticised in reports or </p>
<p>to hide failings by the MOD.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> The Inquiry reviewed 25 percent of BOI investigations into Op TELIC fatalities, </p>
<p>including those that attracted the most controversy. The Inquiry also reviewed the </p>
<p>15 BOI reports into Op TELIC fatalities that are in the public domain.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>61. </b> The BOI reports reviewed by the Inquiry were not consistent in approach or quality. </p>
<p>Areas of particular variance were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent to which the reports considered what happened to the individual(s) </p>
<p>who died (as well as the wider incident in which it happened); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent to which the reports recorded and addressed the concerns of the </p>
<p>deceased’s family and next of kin.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> The Inquiry does not believe that any of the BOI reports it reviewed were </p>
<p>deliberately produced in such a way as to protect the MOD. In at least two cases, the </p>
<p>BOI revealed that an incident might have been caused by friendly fire when the earlier </p>
<p>Service Police investigation had concluded otherwise.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> However, some practices apparent in the BOI reports reviewed by the Inquiry could </p>
<p>create a mistaken impression of a “cover-up”. They were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>interview transcripts which switch between on and off the record;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the difficulty in taking evidence, for example from Iraqi witnesses;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>restrictions on using US material;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the use of defensive or euphemistic language, which can give the impression </p>
<p>that serious failings are being dismissed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>heavy redaction.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> A recurring theme raised by families with the Inquiry was frustration at being denied </p>
<p>visibility of action taken against those who were shown to have done something wrong </p>
<p>(for example, where an individual had not provided truthful evidence to a BOI) or who a </p>
<p>family believed to have been in some way negligent.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> A BOI is not intended to apportion blame. The MOD defended that position, on the </p>
<p>basis that it was the best way to ensure maximum disclosure and, therefore, the best </p>
<p>chance to prevent a recurrence of the incident.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> That position is not unique to BOIs. The right not to incriminate oneself is common </p>
<p>to other investigative processes (such as inquests) where the main objective is to </p>
<p>establish the facts of a case.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> Very few of the BOI reports considered by the Inquiry led to disciplinary measures.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> In order to respond to the concerns regarding the redaction of material from BOI </p>
<p>reports, the Inquiry reviewed a sample of BOI reports relating to Op TELIC, comparing </p>
<p>the full and redacted versions. The Inquiry considered whether the substance justified </p>
<p>redaction, and how the redaction was made.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> The Inquiry concludes that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were no indications that information was redacted by the MOD in order to </p>
<p>cover up wrong-doing, either by individuals or the MOD.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of redaction was not consistent between BOIs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Not all redactions were justified. In some cases, whole passages were </p>
<p>redacted when only a few details were sensitive. In others, material had been </p>
<p>redacted when it was already in the public domain (for example, the name of a </p>
<p>Commanding Officer or pathologist).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In many cases, no attempt was made to explain the nature of the redacted </p>
<p>material to the reader.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were some improvements in practice during the course of Op TELIC. </p>
<p>In general, the most recent BOI reports contained fewer redactions and were </p>
<p>easier to follow.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> The Inquiry recognises that some redactions will be required in almost all such </p>
<p>reports but recommends that the MOD take steps to ensure consistency of practice, in </p>
<p>line with the Information Commissioner’s guidance.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Good practice seen by the Inquiry </p>
<p>includes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>including a clear statement of redaction policy at the start of a document;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing a short overarching description of events described in text which has </p>
<p>been redacted;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adding a description which tells the reader the nature of the text has been </p>
<p>redacted (for example, ‘Personal medical information’);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assigning each individual a unique number or other cipher and attaching a </p>
<p>description of their role to it; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>leaving in ranks where names are redacted, so that command relationships </p>
<p>are clear.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Many of the concerns shared by families in relation to the rigour of the BOI process </p>
<p>and its transparency could be addressed by adding an independent member to a BOI.</p>
<p><b>Inquests</b></p>
<p><b>72. </b> From January 2003, the MOD and the Home Office (the department then </p>
<p>responsible for coronial policy) worked with Mr Nicholas Gardiner, the Coroner for </p>
<p>Oxfordshire, to refine the arrangements for receiving UK military fatalities from Iraq. </p>
<p>The majority of fatalities were expected to be repatriated to RAF Brize Norton, which fell </p>
<p>within his area of responsibility.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> During those initial exchanges, Home Office officials highlighted a number of </p>
<p>issues that would later become problematic: the need for Mr Gardiner’s office to secure </p>
<p>additional resources (from Oxfordshire County Council) to cover the cases it was taking </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>on; the desirability of transferring cases to coroners who were local to the families of the </p>
<p>deceased; and how to handle cases where the deceased was based in Scotland.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> The day before the beginning of military operations against Iraq, Mr Gardiner wrote </p>
<p>to Home Office officials:</p>
<p>“There are a few matters outstanding but, generally, I think we are reasonably well </p>
<p>prepared, although there are bound to be things we have not thought of.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>75. </b> There are no indications that the Government put in place any contingency plans </p>
<p>to support Mr Gardiner’s office, or that the Government maintained contact with </p>
<p>Mr Gardiner’s office after those initial exchanges.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The Inquiry recommends that for any future major operational deployment, the </p>
<p>Chief Coroner, the department responsible for coronial policy (currently the Ministry of </p>
<p>Justice) and the MOD should develop contingency plans to increase the capacity of </p>
<p>the coronial system to handle fatalities. Those plans should include the identification </p>
<p>of funding in the event that it becomes necessary to increase the capacity of the </p>
<p>coronial system.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> In May 2006, in response to growing concern over delays in holding inquests </p>
<p>into the deaths of Service Personnel, Ms Harriet Harman, Minister of State for the </p>
<p>Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), was charged with resolving the problem.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> By early June, Ms Harman had brokered an agreement with the MOD to provide a </p>
<p>substantial package of support to Mr Gardiner’s office, including the recruitment of three </p>
<p>Assistant Deputy Coroners.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Although the package was announced in Parliament in June 2006, discussions </p>
<p>continued between the DCA, the MOD and the Treasury until February 2007 on how </p>
<p>much the MOD would contribute. The discussions concluded with the DCA reluctantly </p>
<p>accepting the MOD’s initial offer of £125,000.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> While the discussions did not delay the provision of support to Mr Gardiner’s office </p>
<p>(as the DCA bore the costs as they were incurred), a disproportionate amount of senior </p>
<p>officials’ and Ministers’ time was consumed in inter-departmental wrangling over a </p>
<p>relatively small amount of money.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The additional resources provided in June 2006 allowed Mr Gardiner’s office to clear </p>
<p>the existing backlog of inquests by October 2007, much sooner than it would otherwise </p>
<p>have done.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> From July 2006, the Government pursued a number of initiatives to make the </p>
<p>inquest process more responsive to the needs of the families of deceased Service </p>
<p>Personnel. The Inquiry commends Ms Harman’s efforts in pursuing those initiatives.</p>

<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Between July 2006 and February 2007, Ms Harman pressed the US Government, </p>
<p>through the US Embassy London, to provide classified US material and </p>
<p>US representatives to support inquests into the deaths of UK Service Personnel. </p>
<p>The US declined to provide that support.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Following a meeting with the families of Service Personnel killed on Op TELIC </p>
<p>in December 2006 and representations in Parliament, including from Mr Roger Gale, </p>
<p>Ms Harman explored the possibility of providing legal representation at inquests for the </p>
<p>families of Service Personnel, in particular at inquests where the MOD chose to have </p>
<p>legal representation.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The Government did not provide that support. In 2009, the Government agreed an </p>
<p>amendment to the Coroners and Justice Bill to provide legal representation at inquests </p>
<p>into the death of British Service Personnel on active service. However, that provision </p>
<p>was not brought into force and was subsequently repealed.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> From June 2007, MOD Ministers pressed the Scottish Executive to make provision </p>
<p>for Fatal Accident Inquiries to be held into the deaths overseas of Service Personnel </p>
<p>normally domiciled in Scotland.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The Government made provision for such Inquiries in the 2009 Coroners and </p>
<p>Justice Act.</p>
<p><b>Delays in military investigations and civilian inquests</b></p>
<p>It could take several years for the MOD and the coronial system to conclude investigations </p>
<p>into the deaths of Service Personnel.</p>
<p>The Inquiry considered why the investigative process should take so long. The four main </p>
<p>factors were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the difficulty of conducting Service Police investigations in a hostile environment, </p>
<p>which was exacerbated by a lack of qualified military investigators; the MOD set no </p>
<p>deadlines for the conclusion of Service Police investigations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Army’s policy, at the beginning of Op TELIC, to hold an investigation into all </p>
<p>deaths, and only to launch a BOI after the investigation had concluded; this policy </p>
<p>changed in 2004;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the time taken to complete BOIs, and in particular to receive comments from senior </p>
<p>officers and advisers on draft BOI reports; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the backlog of inquests which built up in the Oxfordshire Coroner’s office.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>Support for bereaved families</b></p>
<p><b>88. </b> Most of the contacts between the MOD and bereaved families were conducted with </p>
<p>sensitivity. In a few cases, they were not.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> In April 2003, prompted by concern over the insensitive treatment of a bereaved </p>
<p>spouse, and at the direction of Mr Hoon, the MOD initiated a comprehensive review </p>
<p>of bereavement procedures. By the middle of May, it had introduced new guidelines </p>
<p>for communicating with bereaved families, begun work to make the guidance on the </p>
<p>support available to bereaved families more accessible, and amended its policy to allow </p>
<p>bereaved spouses to remain in Service accommodation for as long as they required it.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Mr Ingram attributed the MOD’s failings at the beginning of Op TELIC to a continuing </p>
<p>view within the military that bereavement was “just something that happened”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Ingram added that, in the context of “a big sea change” in public attitudes and the </p>
<p>experience of Op TELIC, the MOD moved quickly to improve the bereavement and </p>
<p>welfare support it provided to families.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The creation, in 2005, of the Joint Casualty Co-ordination Cell (JCCC) and the </p>
<p>production of a joint policy covering the support for bereaved families reduced the </p>
<p>inconsistency between the Services and individual units in the support they offered  </p>
<p>to bereaved families.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> The experiences shared with the Inquiry by bereaved families suggest that the </p>
<p>creation of the JCCC led to an improvement in the quality of the notification process.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> Being a Casualty Notifying Officer (CNOs) and a Visiting Officer (VOs) was (and </p>
<p>remains) an extremely difficult role: a small number fell below the standard required.  </p>
<p>The training and support provided to CNOs and VOs remained an issue of concern for </p>
<p>the MOD throughout the period covered by the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>Support for Service Personnel and their families</b></p>
<p><b>94. </b> The MOD progressively improved the allowances and support provided to Service </p>
<p>Personnel and their families over the course of Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The most substantial development was the introduction of the Operational </p>
<p>Allowance in October 2006. The Allowance, initially set at £2,400 for all Service </p>
<p>Personnel who completed a six-month tour in Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans or on </p>
<p>certain other operations, was designed “to reflect the current, high operational tempo”.</p>

<p>Letter PS/Secretary of State [MOD] to Phillipson, 9 October 2006, ‘A Package for Service Personnel </p>
<p>on Operations’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.4  |  Conclusions: Service Personnel</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>The Operational Welfare Package</b></p>
<p><b>96. </b> The Inquiry heard mixed reports about the Operational Welfare Package (OWP) </p>
<p>from families and veterans of Op TELIC. Limited access to telephones early in the </p>
<p>campaign and the fragility of the air bridge between Iraq and the UK – which reduced the </p>
<p>time available for rest and recuperation – were particular sources of frustration.</p>
<p><b>97. </b> While these were undoubtedly real frustrations, the Inquiry considers that the </p>
<p>MOD delivered most elements of the OWP as quickly as could reasonably have been </p>
<p>expected. A key challenge, recognised by the MOD, was managing and meeting rising </p>
<p>expectations.</p>
<p><b>Support for Reservists</b></p>
<p><b>98. </b> Over 5,000 Reservists were mobilised for Op TELIC 1 (comprising some 12 percent </p>
<p>of total UK forces). Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that Reservists “performed </p>
<p>magnificently during the operation, and we simply could not have done without them”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The MOD’s policy was that deployed Reservists, and their families, should receive </p>
<p>the same welfare support as Regular Service Personnel.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> The MOD found it difficult to provide support to the families of deployed Reservists. </p>
<p>It was the responsibility of the unit to which a Reservist was attached to provide that </p>
<p>support, but the families of Reservists were often spread across the country, some </p>
<p>distance from that unit. A Reservist’s family might have had little or no previous contact </p>
<p>with the unit to which the Reservist was attached, and find it difficult to access the </p>
<p>support that was available.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> The MOD introduced a number of measures to improve the support provided to </p>
<p>Reservists in theatre and in the UK. It also sought to ensure that Reservists benefited </p>
<p>from new initiatives, such as decompression, alongside their Regular colleagues. </p>
