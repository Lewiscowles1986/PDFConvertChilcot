<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the assessments between October 2002 and 19 March 2003 </p>
<p>of Iraq’s capabilities and intentions to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>develop, produce and use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and </p>
<p>ballistic missiles; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>conceal those programmes from the inspectors and obstruct their activities.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The Section also addresses the:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>advice based on intelligence provided to Ministers and others; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>withdrawal of three important streams of SIS reporting in 2003 and 2004.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The roles of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and Secret Intelligence Service </p>
<p>(SIS) are addressed in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The assessment of Iraq’s capabilities and intentions to develop, produce and use </p>
<p>chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles between 2000 and </p>
<p>July 2002, including the initial preparation of a paper on Iraq for publication, is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The subsequent JIC Assessments of 21 August and 9 September, the preparation </p>
<p>of the dossier published on 24 September and Mr Blair’s statement to the House of </p>
<p>Commons on the same day, are addressed in Section 4.2.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The post-invasion search for evidence of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </p>
<p>in Iraq, the Government’s response to the failure to find stockpiles of WMD in Iraq, </p>
<p>demands for an independent judge-led inquiry into pre-conflict intelligence on </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD and the decision to establish the Butler Review, and the Government’s </p>
<p>involvement with the preparation and publication of the series of reports produced </p>
<p>by the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), are addressed in Section 4.4.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The development of UK strategy and options during this period, including </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s and Mr Straw’s statements to Parliament on 18 March 2003, is addressed </p>
<p>in Sections 3.5 to 3.8.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The military planning for a campaign in which chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>could be used, and the arrangements to provide protection for UK Forces, is addressed </p>
<p>in Sections 6.1 to 6.3.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The core construct that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological </p>
<p>warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its </p>
<p>capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was </p>
<p>pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment, underpinned the UK </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>Government’s position that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with and it needed </p>
<p>to disarm or be disarmed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That remained the case up to and beyond the decision to invade Iraq in March 2003.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The judgements about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions relied too heavily on Iraq’s </p>
<p>past behaviour being a reliable indicator of its current and future actions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no consideration of whether, faced with the prospect of a US-led invasion, </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had taken a different position.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) made the judgements in the UK Government </p>
<p>September dossier part of the test for Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s statements that it had no weapons or programmes were dismissed as further </p>
<p>evidence of a strategy of denial.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The extent to which the JIC’s judgements depended on inference and interpretation </p>
<p>of Iraq’s previous attitudes and behaviour was not recognised.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might no longer have chemical, biological </p>
<p>or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or the </p>
<p>policy community.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A formal reassessment of the JIC’s judgements should have taken place after the </p>
<p>report to the Security Council on 14 February 2003, by Dr Hans Blix, Executive </p>
<p>Chairman of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission </p>
<p>(UNMOVIC), or, at the very latest, after his report of 7 March.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq’s capabilities and intent </p>
<p>continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government statements </p>
<p>in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the limitations of </p>
<p>the intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The independence and impartiality of the JIC remains of the utmost importance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) had a responsibility to ensure that key </p>
<p>recipients of its reporting were informed in a timely way when doubts arose about key </p>
<p>sources and when, subsequently, intelligence was withdrawn.</p>
<p><b>The UK assessment of Iraq’s position, October to </b></p>
<p><b>December 2002</b></p>
<p><b>9. </b> As the previous Sections of this Report show, there was an ingrained belief within </p>
<p>the UK Government that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and biological </p>
<p>warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible enhance its capabilities, </p>
<p>including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, and was pursuing an active </p>
<p>policy of deception and concealment.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The UK position reflected the widely shared view that when the UN inspectors left </p>
<p>Iraq in December 1998, Iraq had not fully accounted for major gaps and inconsistencies </p>
<p>in its declarations and had provided no credible proof that Iraq had destroyed its </p>
<p>weapons stockpiles and production infrastructure as it claimed.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> In addition, the description of Iraq’s capabilities and intent in the UK Government </p>
<p>dossier, <i>Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Assessment of the British </i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><i>Government</i>, published on 24 September, became part of the baseline against which </p>
<p>the UK Government measured Iraq’s statements and future actions and the success of </p>
<p>weapons inspections.</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s rebuttal of the UK dossier</b></p>
<p><b>12. </b> The Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a “detailed rebuttal” on 2 October, </p>
<p>which described the UK dossier as “a series of lies and empty propaganda” which was </p>
<p>“totally inconsistent” with the facts and reports made by the UN Special Commission </p>
<p>(UNSCOM) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The rebuttal emphasised Iraq’s “intensive efforts” and co-operation between </p>
<p>1991 and 1998 in implementing resolution 687 (1991) and other UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions. It also stated that Iraq had not imported any prohibited material.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Addressing the dossier’s “claims about alleged activities after 1998”, the Iraqi </p>
<p>rebuttal stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “assumptions” about a nuclear programme were “groundless”. Iraq’s imports </p>
<p>and facilities were subject to strict monitoring, including through the IAEA </p>
<p>safeguards regime.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The allegation that Iraq had tried to acquire uranium “from South Africa” was </p>
<p>“a bogus lie”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no toxic chemical agents, precursors or chemical weapons”; </p>
<p>and “no capabilities to produce chemical or biological agents”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>VX agent production required “an advanced technology” which was “not </p>
<p>available in Iraq”. It had not obtained “any large scale or significant production </p>
<p>of VX agent” from equipment destroyed in 1997.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The al-Muthanna site had been destroyed and was abandoned.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The chlorine and phenol site at Fallujah 2 had produced chlorine for water </p>
<p>purification and chlorine was no longer subject to monitoring.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Ibn-Sina site produced material for civil industries and its equipment had </p>
<p>been tagged by UNSCOM.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The al-Qaqa state company had no plant to produce phosgene and its </p>
<p>equipment was tagged and monitored.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “completely clear of all biological weapons and agents” and did “not </p>
<p>keep any quantity of these agents”. The “botulinum protein” and “anthrax slurry” </p>
<p>previously produced had a “short shelf life”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reaction to the allegation that mobile facilities were producing biological </p>
<p>agent was “astonishment”.</p>

<p>official] to Hamill, 3 October 2002, ‘Iraq’s reply on Blair’s Report’ and Paper [CIC], [undated], ‘Iraq – Still </p>
<p>Playing Games’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Claims that Iraq had “reconstructed and renewed the sites … previously used in </p>
<p>producing biological agents” were “groundless and false”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq did “not possess any missile with a range greater than 150km”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new engine test station was for “horizontal testing” of “Al Samoud” engines </p>
<p>and “could not be used for larger engines”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>RPVs [remotely piloted vehicles] were for aerial reconnaissance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Facilities at the al-Mamoun plant had been destroyed and it could not be used </p>
<p>for solid fuel missiles.</p>
<p><b>15.  A review of the rebuttal by the Assessments Staff stated that it did not </b></p>
<p><b>undermine the UK dossier and in a number of key areas failed to provide a </b></p>
<p><b>credible response.</b></p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, told Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat (OD Sec), that a review of the rebuttal conducted by the Assessments Staff, </p>
<p>the intelligence agencies and the FCO dismissed the rebuttal as: “In broad terms … very </p>
<p>weak; long on rhetoric and short on detail.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Miller added that the document presented “a somewhat rosy picture” of Iraq’s </p>
<p>relationship with UNSCOM. He characterised Iraq’s refutation of the UK “claim that its </p>
<p>WMD programmes have continued post 1998” as an “attitude of denial”.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Miller stated that there was “nothing in the detail of the Iraqi reply” that </p>
<p>undermined the dossier and that:</p>
<p>“In a number of key areas they have failed to provide any credible response. </p>
<p>For example they:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>claim that accusations that they are seeking uranium from South Africa is a </p>
<p>‘bogus lie’. But the dossier did not mention South Africa …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>claim the al-Rafah [engine] test stand is for horizontal rather than vertical </p>
<p>engine testing Al Samoud missile … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>merely state that accusations of mobile biological agent production facilities </p>
<p>are ‘astonishing’.”</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Under a heading ‘Iraq: Still Playing Games’, press lines prepared by the </p>
<p>Communications and Information Centre (CIC) focused on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s pre-1998 co-operation with UNSCOM and its failures to:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>provide full and comprehensive disclosures;</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>allow the inspectors immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to </p>
<p>relevant sites, documents and persons; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the material for which UNSCOM had been unable to account.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> The press lines did not acknowledge or address Iraq’s explicit denials of possession </p>
<p>of prohibited weapons, materials and programmes.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Miller concluded: “I do not think we need to offer a fuller reply to any of </p>
<p>Iraq’s claims.”</p>
<p><b>22. </b> There was no consideration of the risks which Iraq would have faced by issuing </p>
<p>a detailed rebuttal which inspections might show to be untrue.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 11 October 2002: ‘Iraq: The Return of UN Inspectors’</b></p>
<p><b>23.  The JIC assessed on 11 October that Saddam Hussein was determined to </b></p>
<p><b>retain Iraq’s proscribed weapons programme and that he was confident he could </b></p>
<p><b>prevent the UN inspectors, operating under existing UN resolutions, from finding </b></p>
<p><b>any evidence before military options started to close in spring 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>24.  Without specific intelligence, the inspectors would not know where to look.</b></p>
<p><b>25.  As military pressure increased, Iraq’s concealment policy could be </b></p>
<p><b>undermined by the requirement to prepare hidden “chemical and biological </b></p>
<p><b>missile systems for military deployment”.</b></p>
<p><b>26. </b> At the request of OD Sec, the JIC assessed Iraq’s attitude and approach to dealing </p>
<p>with the return of UN weapons inspectors.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> It also assessed Iraq’s concealment policy.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment on 9 October </p>
<p>recorded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “very confident” about its concealment policy and “had put a lot of effort </p>
<p>into ensuring that inspectors would not find anything”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UNMOVIC [UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] still had </p>
<p>no information about suspect sites and without specific intelligence, it would be </p>
<p>impossible for them to know where to start looking.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A tougher, penetrative [inspections] regime backed by a good intelligence flow </p>
<p>from inside Iraq, would therefore be absolutely central to success”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [A]s military pressure increased, the point would come when concealment </p>
<p>would make it impossible” for Iraq to “prepare for weaponisation”.</p>

<p>Minutes, 9 October 2002, JIC meeting.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The JIC Assessment, ‘Iraq: The Return of UN Inspectors’, was issued on </p>
<p>11 October.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam is determined to retain Iraq’s proscribed weapons programmes. He </p>
<p>is confident that he can prevent UNMOVIC, operating on the basis of existing </p>
<p>UNSCRs [United Nations Security Council resolutions], from finding any </p>
<p>evidence before military options start to close off in spring 2003.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concealment and dispersal of sensitive items are the main elements of Iraq’s </p>
<p>strategy for dealing with UNMOVIC. The inspectors are hampered by poor </p>
<p>preparedness and a lack of intelligence, so far, to guide them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam will probably accept a new UN resolution. If inspections are conducted </p>
<p>under a tougher regime, and if specific intelligence on WMD locations </p>
<p>is forthcoming in response to clear US determination to topple Saddam, </p>
<p>UNMOVIC might find evidence of Iraq’s WMD programmes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the short-term, we do not expect a repeat of the blatant Iraqi policy of </p>
<p>intimidation and obstruction that UNSCOM encountered. Widespread Iraqi </p>
<p>obstruction would be seen as too obvious a challenge to the authority of the UN. </p>
<p>But if inspectors come close to uncovering evidence of WMD, Iraq will employ a </p>
<p>wide range of tactics to delay their work.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq will use all diplomatic efforts, backed by its economic leverage on its </p>
<p>neighbours, to undermine political support for a continuation of the inspections </p>
<p>and sanctions.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The Assessment is addressed in detail in Section 3.5. The key points in relation </p>
<p>to Iraq’s possession of WMD and its intent to conceal its capabilities and deceive the </p>
<p>inspectors were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence indicated that Saddam Hussein was “determined to retain Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction”, which he considered “to be a key part of Iraq’s </p>
<p>regional political and military power”. He was “adamant that UN weapons </p>
<p>inspectors should not be allowed to find and destroy the WMD capability </p>
<p>that Iraq has been able to develop further in the four years since UNSCOM </p>
<p>left in 1998”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “confident” that it could “ensure the inspectors, acting under the terms </p>
<p>of existing UNSCRs”, would “not be able to find anything when they return and </p>
<p>that Iraq will retain its proscribed weapons programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A body of intelligence” indicated that “concealment and dispersal of sensitive </p>
<p>items” were “the main planks of Iraq’s strategy to deal with the return of </p>
<p>weapons inspectors”. Saddam Hussein had “reportedly taken into account the </p>
<p>5 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 11 October 2002, ‘Iraq: The Return of UN Inspectors’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>experience gained during the UNSCOM inspections” and believed he could </p>
<p>“exploit weaknesses in the inspections regime” in resolution 1284 (1999).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Qusay Hussein (Saddam Hussein’s son) had “instructed that the production of </p>
<p>sensitive materials be moved to other secret locations. We have little intelligence </p>
<p>on these locations …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s concealment efforts were “widespread”. Iraq had “had time to prepare”; </p>
<p>and stocks of chemical and biological weapons would be “considerably smaller </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence showed that “steps were being taken to prevent weapons inspectors </p>
<p>from finding any prohibited weapons, sensitive papers and documents, including </p>
<p>by hiding them in residential buildings, schools and private homes. Duplicate </p>
<p>and non-essential papers had been destroyed and the remaining archives had </p>
<p>been split up and hidden in the homes of trusted officials. In the absence of </p>
<p>specific intelligence, the prospects of successfully finding illicit material at such </p>
<p>sites is very limited …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “exploiting dual-use sites and mobile production facilities” and reporting </p>
<p>indicated that it was “confident that any inspection of dual-use facilities” would </p>
<p>be “unsuccessful”: the equipment could be used for legitimate purposes “and </p>
<p>any incriminating raw material or prohibited product would be removed before </p>
<p>any inspection”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “developed transportable biological production facilities with the </p>
<p>intention of not only making it harder to target them but also difficult to find </p>
<p>them. Iraq may also have dispersed stocks of chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>away from suspect sites to avoid detection. Intelligence indicates that Iraq has </p>
<p>explored unorthodox options for delivering chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>which means the weapons inspectors will have difficulty knowing what to </p>
<p>look for.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “confident in its concealment plans”. “The fact that Saddam is </p>
<p>prepared, temporarily, to allow sensitive equipment out of his ‘immediate’ </p>
<p>control, indicates the importance he attaches to retaining chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons and ballistic missiles.”</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Commenting on Iraq’s repeated statements that it had “nothing to declare and no </p>
<p>documents to reveal”, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“… the longer inspectors remain in Iraq the greater the likely impact on Iraq’s </p>
<p>development programmes. UNMOVIC are more likely to come up with evidence of </p>
<p>proscribed activity at Iraq’s missile facilities than those associated with the chemical, </p>
<p>biological and nuclear programmes. We judge that production could continue at </p>
<p>a much reduced level whilst inspectors were in-country. As the military pressure </p>
<p>against Iraq increases, its concealment policy could be undermined by the Iraqi </p>
<p>requirement to prepare its hidden stocks of chemical and biological missile systems </p>
<p>for military deployment.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>The US National Intelligence Estimate</b></p>
<p><b>32. </b> On 1 October, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) produced its National </p>
<p>Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on ‘Iraq’s Continuing Programs for Weapons of Mass </p>
<p>Destruction’.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>33. </b> An unclassified document based on the NIE, published on 4 October, included the </p>
<p>following judgements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has continued its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs in </p>
<p>defiance of UN resolutions and restrictions. Baghdad has chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons as well as missiles with ranges in excess of UN restrictions; </p>
<p>if left unchecked, it probably will have a nuclear weapon during this decade.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Baghdad hides large portions of Iraq’s WMD efforts …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Since inspections ended in 1998, Iraq has maintained its chemical weapons effort, </p>
<p>energized its missile program, and invested more heavily in biological weapons; </p>
<p>most analysts assess Iraq is reconstituting its nuclear weapons program.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“How quickly Iraq will obtain its first nuclear weapon depends on when it </p>
<p>acquires sufficient weapons-grade fissile material.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Baghdad has begun renewed production of chemical warfare agents, probably </p>
<p>including mustard, sarin, cyclosarin, and VX.” Iraq’s capability was “probably </p>
<p>more limited now” than it was in 1991, although VX production and agent </p>
<p>storage life had probably “been improved”. Iraq probably possessed “CW </p>
<p>[chemical warfare] bulk fill” for ballistic missile warheads “including for a limited </p>
<p>number of covertly stored, extended range Scuds”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“All key aspects – R&amp;D, production, and weaponization – of Iraq’s offensive BW </p>
<p>[biological warfare] program are active and most elements are larger and more </p>
<p>advanced than they were before the Gulf war.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq maintains a small missile force and several development programs, </p>
<p>including for a UAV [unmanned aerial vehicle] that most analysts believe </p>
<p>probably is intended to deliver biological warfare agents.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>34. </b> The discussion of Iraq’s biological warfare programme included reference to “a </p>
<p>large-scale, redundant, and concealed BW agent production capability, which includes </p>
<p>mobile facilities; these facilities can evade detection, are highly survivable, and can </p>
<p>exceed the production rates Iraq had prior to the Gulf war”.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The discussion on the Iraqi nuclear programme referred to “Iraq’s aggressive </p>
<p>attempts to obtain proscribed high-strength aluminium tubes” and stated that all </p>
<p>“intelligence experts agree that Iraq is seeking nuclear weapons and that these tubes </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Some AQ leaders who had fled Afghanistan were in Iraq, including “one very </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“[C]onfronting the threat posed by Iraq” was “crucial to winning the war against </p>

<p><b>emphasised the reliability of the intelligence on which the UK analysis of Iraq’s </b></p>

<p>In relation to Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction he stated:</p>
<p>“We remain deeply perturbed by evidence that Iraq believes it can hide its weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction rather than declare them, that it can again fool the inspectors </p>
<p>and play games with them. The United Kingdom analysis, backed by reliable </p>
<p>intelligence, indicates that Iraq still possesses chemical and biological materials, has </p>
<p>continued to produce them, has sought to weaponise them, and has active military </p>
<p>plans for the deployment of such weapons. The United Kingdom analysis, backed </p>
<p>up by reliable intelligence, shows that Iraq has in recent years tried to buy multiple </p>
<p>components relevant to the production of a nuclear bomb. The United Kingdom </p>
<p>analysis, backed by reliable intelligence, points to the retention of extended-range </p>
<p>missiles and to the employment of hundreds of people in projects to develop </p>
<p>weapons with a range of over 1,000 kilometres that could carry both weapons of </p>

<p><b>JIC Current Intelligence Group Assessment, 28 October 2002: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Global Chemical and Biological Weapons Survey’</b></p>
<p><b>45.  A global survey of chemical and biological weapons on 28 October addressed </b></p>
<p><b>the practicalities of producing chemical and biological weapons and how they </b></p>
<p><b>might be used.</b></p>
<p><b>46.  It stated that intelligence indicated that Iraq continued to produce chemical </b></p>
<p><b>agent. It assessed that Iraq was producing chemical and biological agents and </b></p>
<p><b>that the agents could be weaponised; it did not say that Iraq was doing so.</b></p>
<p><b>47. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued a Current Intelligence Group (CIG) </p>
<p>global survey of chemical and biological weapons on 28 October.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> It provided a general </p>
<p>assessment of the practicalities involved in producing and using chemical and biological </p>
<p>agents, and an assessment of the capabilities of several countries, including Iraq. It </p>
<p>highlighted the relative ease with which many chemical and biological agents could be </p>
<p>produced and disseminated, and the impact of their use.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> The Key Judgements stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There are few significant technical problems in the production or dissemination </p>
<p>of many chemical warfare (CW) and biological warfare (BW) agents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ballistic missiles and most conventional munitions, such as artillery shells, </p>
<p>rockets and aerial bombs can be modified to deliver agent. It can also be </p>
<p>sprayed from land or marine platforms and a variety of aerial systems.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>BW agents are less suitable for some battlefield roles than CW because they </p>
<p>generally act more slowly. CBW could play an increasing role in military thinking, </p>
<p>especially asymmetrically. The use of even small quantities of CW could help </p>
<p>redress conventional superiority on the battlefield. BW agents have the potential </p>
<p>for covert, deniable delivery which is particularly suited to terrorist-type attacks </p>
<p>and asymmetric warfare.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The potential for the proliferation of CBW is increasing. Arms control treaties and </p>
<p>export regimes hinder, but cannot stop the trends.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is a growing risk of secondary proliferation [of technical knowledge </p>
<p>and experience as well as equipment and hardware] between countries of </p>
<p>concern. […]</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>States are increasingly using sophisticated denial, deception and concealment </p>
<p>methods, including the use of dual-use and/or underground facilities, to hide </p>
<p>their activities.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Other points made in the Assessment included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The equipment and materials used in the production of CW and BW agents were </p>
<p>“subject to international export controls imposed by some countries but all are </p>
<p>dual-use. They can therefore be imported for legitimate purposes.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once in country it is difficult to prevent such equipment and materials being </p>
<p>diverted to offensive CBW programmes.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The very large quantities of CW agent required for a significant military attack </p>
<p>(of the order of one tonne, optimally disseminated, is needed to contaminate </p>
<p>2.5 sq km …) mean that a large-scale delivery capability is needed.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The effectiveness of an attack depends on the lethality and persistency of </p>
<p>the agent …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“BW agents are more potent than CW agents, cheaper, easier to produce and </p>
<p>usable against a wide range of targets. A country does not need a sophisticated </p>
<p>biotechnology industry to produce BW. Their potency means that the quantities </p>
<p>required for an effective large-sale attack are relatively small … and have the </p>
<p>potential to cause more casualties. If effectively disseminated in unprotected </p>
<p>urban population centres some BW agents could cause casualties on a scale </p>
<p>similar to that of a nuclear attack. Of particular concern are agents that are not </p>
<p>just virulent, but highly infectious and capable of causing an epidemic … </p>
<p>[E]ffective delivery is difficult to guarantee.”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> In relation to Iraq’s chemical weapons programme, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“We continue to judge … that <b>Iraq</b> has an offensive CW programme and intelligence </p>
<p>indicates that it has continued to produce chemical agent … Despite UNSCOM’s </p>
<p>efforts, we believe Iraq retained some production equipment, small stocks of agent </p>
<p>precursors, and small quantities of agents and weapons, including warheads for the </p>
<p>Al Hussein 650km ballistic missile. Apart from this hidden capability, Iraq has also </p>
<p>retained documentation on CW agent production and experienced key personnel. </p>
<p>Despite the constraints that have been put in place to restrict Iraq’s access to </p>
<p>dual-use equipment, the chemical industry has been built up and could be used to </p>
<p>support an offensive CW programme.”</p>
<p><b>51. </b> In relation to Iraq’s biological weapons programme, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“… Iraq has continued with an offensive BW programme. Research, development </p>
<p>and production is assessed to continue under cover of a number of outwardly </p>
<p>legitimate institutes and covert facilities. Confirmed intelligence reveals that </p>
<p>transportable BW production facilities have been constructed. Iraq has possibly </p>
<p>already made significant quantities of BW agents and intelligence indicates that it </p>
<p>has continued to produce biological agents. We judge that Iraq is self-sufficient in </p>
<p>its BW programme and currently has available, either from pre-Gulf War stocks or </p>
<p>more recent production, anthrax spores, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and possibly </p>
<p>plague and ricin.”</p>

<p>301</p>
<p><b>52. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq also researched a number of other agents within its offensive programme, </p>
<p>some of which may be available for production. “Iraq can weaponise CBW agents </p>
<p>into missile warheads, bombs, artillery rockets and shells, and could adapt </p>
<p>helicopters, manned and un-manned aircraft … to disseminate agent. CBW plays an </p>
<p>important role in Iraqi military thinking. As compensation for its conventional military </p>
<p>weakness Iraq is determined to retain CBW in order to dominate its neighbours. </p>
<p>Intelligence indicates Iraq is ready to use CBW weapons and that munitions could </p>
<p>be with military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes.”</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Addressing the judgements in the Assessment, the<i> Review of Intelligence on </i></p>
<p><i>Weapons of Mass Destruction</i>,<i> </i>chaired by Lord Butler of Brockwell, stated:</p>
<p>“The judgement that Iraq was continuing to produce chemical agent was supported </p>
<p>by one new intelligence report received on 30 September.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>“… The most significant change in this assessment was in the JIC’s indication </p>
<p>… that the intelligence on mobile biological agent production facilities had been </p>
<p>‘confirmed’ … based on the receipt of one intelligence report, from a reliable </p>
<p>and established source quoting a new sub-source. That report reinforced the </p>
<p>large volume of reports on those facilities received from a single source through </p>
<p>a liaison service since April 2000, although our view is that the new report was </p>
<p>complementary to rather than confirming those from the liaison source.”</p>

<p>18</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The key points in the letter in relation to WMD were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The claims by President Bush and Mr Blair that “Iraq might have produced, or </p>
<p>might have been on the way to producing, nuclear weapons” since 1998 and </p>
<p>that “Iraq had indeed produced chemical and biological weapons” was “an utterly </p>
<p>unfounded fabrication” and “baseless”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had agreed to the return of inspectors, and had “already stated” that it had </p>
<p>“neither produced nor possessed any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction during the absence of the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> The letter challenged a statement made by Sir Jeremy Greenstock that Iraq had </p>
<p>been provided with the opportunity to dispose of its weapons of mass destruction, but </p>
<p>Iraq had ignored that opportunity and decided to keep possession. The letter asked why </p>
<p>“none of the representatives” of the members of the Security Council had “asked … </p>
<p>when, how or where such an alleged decision had been taken by Iraq to keep weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>60.  The UK remained sceptical about Iraq’s intentions, focusing on its track </b></p>
<p><b>record of deceit, and repeating the need to maintain the threat of military action to </b></p>
<p><b>secure compliance.</b></p>
<p><b>61. </b> In a lecture that evening, Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, welcomed Iraq’s </p>
<p>response “so far as it goes” but added:</p>
<p>“… we must remain vigilant for experience with Iraq tells us to temper optimism with </p>

<p>What matters above all is their actions not their words.</p>
<p>“… The history of UN weapons inspections in Iraq is littered with examples of deceit, </p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 14 NOVEMBER 2002: ‘IRAQ: REGIME COHESION </p>
<p>UNDER PRESSURE’</p>
<p><b>62.  The JIC judged on 14 November that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq accepted resolution 1441 because Saddam Hussein knew that this </b></p>
<p><b>was the only way to avert a large-scale US-led ground attack.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq could try to overload UNMOVIC by releasing large volumes of </b></p>
<p><b>information about legitimate industries. It might admit to some </b></p>
<p><b>“expendable” parts of its WMD, but it would focus on concealing sensitive </b></p>
<p><b>items from inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>63. </b> In parallel with the adoption of resolution 1441, the JIC decided to revisit its July 2002 </p>
<p>Assessment of regime cohesion in Iraq to:</p>
<p>“… examine how the Iraqi regime is responding to mounting international </p>
<p>pressure … [and] assess whether there are any signs of strain within the regime </p>
<p>and evaluate the speed and effectiveness of Iraqi decision-making.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>64. </b> In the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment on 13 November, the point was </p>
<p>made that concealment and the retention of a WMD capability “remained a cornerstone </p>
<p>of Saddam’s policy” and his intention was to allow the inspectors in and manage the </p>
<p>inspections indefinitely as a means of avoiding conflict. But the resolution put the onus </p>
<p>on Iraq to prove it had no WMD programmes. The inspectors would need to be  </p>
<p>prepared to deal with diversionary tactics including lengthy inspections of sites not </p>

<p>14 November.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> In its Key Judgements the JIC stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq accepted resolution 1441 “because Saddam knew that this was the only </p>
<p>way to avert a large-scale US-led coalition ground attack. The regime probably </p>
<p>believes that a coalition attack will not be possible when inspectors are </p>
<p>inside Iraq.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq could try to overload UNMOVIC by releasing large volumes of information </p>
<p>about legitimate industries. Although less likely, Iraq might admit to some </p>
<p>‘expendable’ parts of its WMD programmes to demonstrate ostensible </p>
<p>co-operation and to provoke divisions in the UN. But it will focus on concealing </p>
<p>sensitive items from inspectors.”</p>

<p><b>66. </b> In relation to Iraq’s WMD programmes and the return of inspectors, the </p>
<p>Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s “overriding priority” was “regime survival” and “he also had </p>
<p>a very strong commitment to retaining WMD” which he saw as “key to Iraqi </p>
<p>power and influence”. Iraq had “no credible alternative to ostensible co-operation </p>
<p>with the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “no new intelligence” on whether Iraq would “declare any </p>
<p>prohibited materials or activity in response” to resolution 1441. Any disclosures </p>
<p>on WMD would “damage the regime’s already limited credibility, given its </p>
<p>continuing blanket denials of WMD possession”. The Iraqi regime would “seek </p>
<p>to take advantage of any opportunity to fudge Iraq’s obligations or delay the </p>
<p>UN process”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Senior Iraqis agreed “that Iraq should maintain a WMD capability”, but if </p>
<p>UNMOVIC made “demonstrable progress which threatens to overcome Iraq’s </p>
<p>policy of deception and concealment, and Saddam refuses to give ground, there </p>
<p>could be pressure on key insiders to break with Saddam in order to ensure their </p>
<p>own survival”.</p>

<p><b>69.  Subsequent intelligence that Saddam Hussein had made clear that UNMOVIC </b></p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq intended to declare a small part of its illegal programmes, and overload </p>
<p>UNMOVIC with large quantities of information on legitimate activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>WMD were seen as vital to the regime’s survival, so a core WMD capability and </p>
<p>infrastructure must be retained.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was concerned about the provisions for conducting interviews of Iraqis </p>
<p>outside Iraq, which could expose illicit procurement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was concern about the potential destruction by the inspectors of </p>
<p>dual-use facilities.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Scarlett commented that the concerns about exposing illicit procurement might </p>
<p>be referring to conventional weapons programmes and that the dual-use facilities </p>
<p>supported “the WMD programmes”.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that the intelligence confirmed earlier JIC judgements, including </p>
<p>the identification of “overload” as a potential strategy. There was no intelligence on which </p>
<p>illegal programmes might be declared.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Scarlett also drew attention to preparations to intimidate potential Iraqi </p>
<p>interviewees.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Scarlett’s other comments included the observations that there seemed to be:</p>
<p>“… an inconsistency in Iraq’s policy towards inspectors. The [intelligence] indicates </p>
<p>the regime plans to let the inspectors into any site. But it also indicates that the </p>
<p>regime must rethink a core WMD capability.”</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded that it was “possible” that Iraq was “so confident of its </p>
<p>concealment strategy that it believes inspectors will not discover prohibited activity. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, this [intelligence] is important in that it further confirms that ultimately the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime does not envisage having to accept genuine and complete disarmament, </p>
<p>and is confident in its ability to mislead inspectors.”</p>
<p><b>77. </b> The intelligence described by Mr Scarlett was based on reported comments, </p>
<p>including from someone with access to senior members of the Iraqi regime; but it was </p>
<p>not quoting Saddam Hussein’s views.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote in </p>
<p>his diaries:</p>
<p>“There was some interesting stuff around on deception programmes, for example </p>

<p>warning that they and their families would be harmed if they were lost.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The Assessments Staff Intelligence Update on 26 November stated that intelligence </p>
<p>indicated Saddam Hussein was personally handling all dealings with UNMOVIC; and he </p>
<p>was confident the inspectors would not find anything, nor find grounds for claiming Iraq </p>
<p>had obstructed its work.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The Update was summarising intelligence from a reliable source quoting Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s own views second hand. The intelligence reported that Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>made clear UNMOVIC was to be given no grounds for claiming that inspections were </p>
<p>being obstructed; not that he was confident that the inspectors would not find grounds </p>
<p>for claiming that they were being obstructed.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> An Assessments Staff Intelligence Update on 3 December summarised recent </p>
<p>reporting which suggested that Iraqi personnel were observing the inspectors, </p>
<p>that officials had been instructed on how to handle the inspection teams, and that </p>
<p>questioning overseas was forbidden.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The Update also reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was afraid that inspectors would destroy weapons and materials which were </p>
<p>not proscribed but had been acquired by procurement activities in contravention </p>
<p>of resolution 687 (1991).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was reporting indicating that Iraq believed inspectors would not detect </p>
<p>modifications to extend missile ranges.</p>
<p>SECURITY COUNCIL, 25 NOVEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, gave an informal briefing </p>

<p>18 to 19 November with Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, the Director General of the IAEA.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr Blix told the Council that they had been assured Iraq intended to provide full </p>
<p>co-operation.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Dr Blix reported that he had told Iraq that “many governments believed that </p>
<p>WMD programmes remained in Iraq”; and that “The Council had wanted to offer Iraq </p>
<p>a last opportunity. If the Iraqi side were to state – as it still did at our meeting – that </p>
<p>there were no such programmes, it would need to provide convincing documentary </p>
<p>or other evidence.” The FFCDs (Full, Final, and Complete Declarations) submitted </p>
<p>by Iraq to UNSCOM had, “in many cases left it an open question whether some </p>

<p>FCO ADVICE, 29 NOVEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>85. </b> On 29 November, in response to a request from Sir David Manning, Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>Private Office provided advice on handling Iraq’s declaration required by resolution </p>
<p>1441.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The FCO advised that Iraq could maintain it had “no WMD and defy UNMOVIC/</p>
<p>IAEA to prove them wrong, confident that they can conceal the programmes uncovered </p>
<p>by UNSCOM in 1998”, but the expectation was that it would be “more subtle: </p>
<p>declaring very large quantities of dual-use items and programmes and reiterating </p>
<p>all … past declarations … In both cases our assumption is that they will continue to </p>
<p>hide programmes …”</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The UK aim should be to get the inspectors to “check (or audit)” the declaration </p>
<p>“as soon as possible through intrusive inspections, interviews and access to records” </p>
<p>against information from other sources, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The information available to UNSCOM in 1998. If Iraq declared “nothing”, it </p>
<p>“must demonstrate the destruction of material or the disbandment of possible </p>
<p>WMD programmes identified by UNSCOM”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence material provided by the US/UK. We have already pointed </p>
<p>UNMOVIC towards key sites and provided a list of 6,500 individuals involved </p>
<p>in WMD programmes …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Where the declaration was “inconsistent with intelligence”, the UK would </p>
<p>“want UNMOVIC/IAEA to be able to discover that inconsistency on the ground </p>
<p>before notifying the Council”. That would avoid giving Iraq the chance to </p>
<p>conceal evidence.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 6 December 2002: ‘Iraq: Military Options’</b></p>
<p><b>88.  On 6 December 2002, as part of a wider assessment of Iraq’s military </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities and options, the JIC judged that Saddam Hussein would use chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological weapons if he faced defeat, and might use them earlier in a conflict.</b></p>
<p><b>89.  The Assessment itself identified possible practical and political considerations </b></p>

<p>Iraq’s plans for using chemical and biological weapons remained “limited”.</p>
<p>30</p>

<p>Mosul fell to allied control, or if Iraqi military units rebelled”. He “would wait and see how </p>
<p>neighbouring countries reacted to any Allied attack, and whether they had allowed their </p>
<p>territory to be used by Allied forces, before deciding whether to use CBW against them”. </p>
<p>His initial “targets” would be “Israel, Kuwait and Jordan”.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> In the JIC discussion on 4 December, the draft Assessment was described as “an </p>
<p>important paper which highlighted the gaps in our knowledge”.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> The judgements were </p>
<p>based “largely on a mixture of observation and past experience”, but the Assessment </p>
<p>“did not quite do justice to the intelligence”; the judgements “could be made more </p>
<p>confidently”. The Assessment needed to bring out more clearly the risks of a phased </p>
<p>attack and unpack the risks involved in possible scenarios, such as the possible use </p>
<p>of CBW before Coalition Forces were properly assembled and urban fighting.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> The JIC issued an Assessment of Iraq’s military capabilities and options, which </p>
<p>is considered in more detail in Section 6.1, on 6 December 2002.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>93. </b> A Key Judgement<b> </b>stated that:</p>
<p>“Saddam would use chemical and biological weapons … if he faced defeat. </p>
<p>He might also use them earlier in a conflict, including against Coalition Forces, </p>
<p>neighbouring states and his own people. Israel could be his first target …”</p>
<p><b>94. </b> In the main text, the JIC set out its assessment of Iraq’s missiles and unguided </p>
<p>rockets. The text of the Assessment stated that, given the limited number of Al Hussein </p>
<p>missiles, Iraq would use them “principally against Israel”. Shorter-range missiles and </p>
<p>unguided rockets “might be used against deployed coalition forces or Iraq’s neighbours”.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“We judge Iraq would be able to arm at least some of the missiles and rockets </p>
<p>with chemical and biological (CBW) warheads. Iraqi aircraft or artillery could also </p>
<p>deliver CBW. […] in mid-September Saddam re-iterated his willingness to use </p>
<p>CBW, […]. Saddam also envisaged using CBW against Israel, Kuwait, and Jordan. </p>
<p>This is consistent with earlier intelligence, but we lack definite corroboration. […] </p>
<p>Iraqi interest in procuring large quantities of protective equipment and treatments for </p>
<p>exposure to nerve agent. […] the regime would consider using CBW against internal </p>
<p>uprisings or Shia-populated Iraqi cities, and for propaganda purposes could seek </p>
<p>to blame the coalition. CBW use against civilians could cause severe casualties. </p>
<p>And even relatively small-scale use could cause widespread panic and a serious </p>
<p>humanitarian impact. Iraq’s ability to use CBW might be constrained by its available </p>
<p>stocks of agent and the difficulty of producing more while inspectors are present. </p>
<p>But we do not know the extent of Iraq’s current stocks or what it might have at </p>
<p>such a stage.”</p>

<p>309</p>
<p><b>96. </b> The JIC also stated:</p>
<p>“In determining whether to use CBW, Saddam would have to balance the risk of </p>
<p>strengthening the Coalition’s political case for removing him against the desire </p>
<p>to widen the war by involving Israel or inflicting unacceptable casualties upon </p>
<p>the coalition. We judge that, faced with the likelihood of military defeat and being </p>
<p>removed from power, it is unlikely Saddam could be deterred from ordering the </p>
<p>use of CBW.”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> The JIC stated that Iraqi responses to a Coalition attack might include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“CBW terrorism: although Iraq probably lacks the capability to deploy a </p>
<p>sophisticated device …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“using non-lethal BW in a deniable manner to cause sickness amongst Coalition </p>
<p>troops as they assembled;”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq … might also target the civilian Shia or Kurdish populations, possibly </p>
<p>with CBW.”</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s declaration of 7 December and the UK response</b></p>
<p><b>98. </b> Operative paragraph 3 (OP3) of resolution 1441 required Iraq to provide:</p>
<p>“… not later than 30 days from the date of this resolution, a currently accurate, full </p>

<p>Security Advisor, and Mr George Tenet, Director of Central Intelligence, in Washington </p>
<p>on 9 December.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Sir David reported to Mr Blair that there was impatience in the US Administration </p>
<p>and pressure for early military action, probably in mid/late February. There were </p>
<p>concerns about the risks if the inspections found nothing and the difficulties of </p>
<p>persuading the international community to act if there were a series of “low level and </p>
<p>less clear-cut acts of obstruction” rather than the discovery of chemical or biological </p>
<p>agents or a nuclear programme, or the imprisonment or murder of UNMOVIC inspectors.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Sir David had said that Iraq’s declaration should be handled in a way “calculated </p>
<p>to maintain coalition support and to try to secure a second resolution”. He thought that </p>
<p>was possible. The UK needed “a convincing case based on evidence. Public defiance by </p>
<p>Saddam was not the same as proving non-compliance. We should work hard over the </p>
<p>next couple of months to build our case and secure a second resolution.”</p>

<p>36</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, recorded that </p>

<p>Saddam was pursuing WMD programmes.”</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Blair would speak to President Bush and possibly Dr Blix in the next few days.</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Miller advised Sir David Manning on 13 December that the declaration was </p>

<p>“There appears to have been no attempt to answer any of the unresolved </p>
<p>questions highlighted by UNSCOM or refute any of the points made in the UK or </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Sir Richard told one US official that, in addition to setting out clearly and </p>
<p>persuasively that Iraq had failed to abide by resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… we needed to continue on parallel tracks designed to reinforce the case, and for </p>
<p>HMG, to give the PM sufficient evidence of a breach which the declaration by itself </p>
<p>did not. We needed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a detailed audit of the declaration</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to press the interview issue or force Saddam’s refusal to co-operate</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to prepare for the release of intelligence to prove deception</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to press on with a rigorous inspection regime absent a ‘silver-bullet’.”</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Sir Richard said that “perhaps by the end of January all those elements would have </p>
<p>produced sufficient evidence to make the convincing case we needed”. A “convincing </p>
<p>defector or a revealing site inspection” would be preferable, “but we could not depend on </p>
<p>this”. He added later that “success was far from guaranteed”.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> In a separate conversation with another official, Sir Richard Dearlove had said that </p>
<p>he “estimated the chance of a successful operation to produce a defector or a smoking </p>
<p>gun at about 20 percent”.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> In a manuscript comment to Mr Blair, Sir David wrote that “we should go flat out” to </p>
<p>find a defector or evidence in a site inspection.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr Blair replied: “absolutely”.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>124. </b> Against Sir Richard’s estimate of the chances of success, Mr Jonathan Powell, </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, wrote: “Not good”.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>125. </b> On the description of a discussion about a possible presentation of intelligence </p>
<p>“when conflict was inevitable”, including overhead photographs of material being moved </p>
<p>and intercepts of conversations about deception operations, Mr Blair wrote “but can’t this </p>
<p>be used to convince Blix?”</p>

<p>DOUBTS ABOUT THE SOURCING CHAIN FOR SIS REPORTS ISSUED ON </p>
<p>11 AND 23 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>126.  By December 2002, doubts had emerged within SIS about the reliability of </b></p>
<p><b>the source who had given SIS the reporting issued on 11 and 23 September.</b></p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Section 4.2 sets out the material from SIS reports described as from “A new source </p>
<p>on trial with direct access” and issued to a small number of very senior readers on </p>
<p>11 and 23 September. These stated that Iraq had accelerated the production of chemical </p>
<p>and biological agents and that Saddam Hussein was determined to maintain his CBW </p>
<p>capability. Mr Blair and others were told that the SIS expected to receive substantial </p>
<p>additional material on Iraq’s chemical and biological programmes through the same source.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove was reported to have briefed Mr Straw “in general terms </p>
<p>only, on the hoped for dump of material from [codename] and the importance it would </p>
<p>have” on 27 September.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> Mr Straw had “asked several questions about [codename’s] </p>
<p>motivation and whether he was genuine”. Sir Richard had told him that the answer to the </p>
<p>first was “money and ideology”, and that the answer to the second was “yes”.</p>
<p><b>129. </b> When he was asked by the Inquiry about the questions raised by Mr Straw about </p>
<p>the sourcing for the report, SIS4 outlined the level of confidence that SIS had had in the </p>
<p>source at this point and the reasons for those views and set out the steps which were </p>
<p>open to SIS in these circumstances to validate the intelligence.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> But he explained that </p>
<p>he was unsighted on the exact steps taken in this case.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> In early October, questions were raised with SIS about the mention of glass </p>
<p>containers in the 23 September 2002 report.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> It was pointed out that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Glass containers were not typically used in chemical munitions; and that a </p>
<p>popular movie (<i>The Rock</i>) had inaccurately depicted nerve agents being carried </p>
<p>in glass beads or spheres.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had had difficulty in the 1980s obtaining a key precursor chemical for soman </p>
<p>[a chemical agent].</p>
<p><b>131. </b> The questions about the use of glass containers for chemical agent and the </p>
<p>similarity of the description to those portrayed in <i>The Rock</i> had been recognised by </p>
<p>SIS.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> There were some precedents for the use of glass containers but the points would </p>
<p>be pursued when further material became available.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> A document written on 11 November described the issue of acquiring the promised </p>
<p>further reporting as “reaching a crucial point” and that it was being afforded “our highest </p>
<p>priority”.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> It also said that Sir Richard Dearlove was “following progress of the case”.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> On 13 November, Sir Richard Dearlove “updated” Mr Straw “on our hopes to get </p>
<p>further [codename] reporting”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> Sir Richard described “in outline terms only” the delays in </p>
<p>obtaining the expected intelligence and, given its importance, possible steps to retrieve it.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>134. </b> By 6 December, questions were being asked within SIS about whether there was </p>
<p>any further reporting.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> It was suggested that that meant “a health warning” on material </p>
<p>from SIS’s source.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Following further contacts, doubts were expressed on 9 December within SIS </p>
<p>about the reliability of the source and whether he had “made up all or part of the account </p>
<p>of his dealings” with the sub-source.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Reporting on 16 December suggested that further material did exist.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary recorded that Mr Straw asked for </p>
<p>an “update on the likelihood” of [codename] “producing silver bullet intelligence to </p>
<p>guide the UNMOVIC inspection teams” in his meeting with Sir Richard Dearlove on </p>
<p>19 December.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Sir Richard was reported to have stated that “the outcome of [codename] was </p>
<p>still in the balance”. SIS was talking to his contacts and he [the sub-source] “definitely </p>
<p>existed”; but he “may not have written up the intelligence in the manner which was being </p>
<p>claimed for him”.</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Sir Richard also told Mr Straw that US policy and planning – the “generation </p>
<p>of a road map” – were proceeding “on the assumption that a silver bullet would not </p>
<p>be forthcoming”.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Straw was reported to have been “concerned by the timetabling and what would </p>
<p>happen without evidence of a clear material breach”; and that “in a recent meeting the </p>
<p>Prime Minister had made the point that unless there was a clear material breach, he </p>
<p>would face political difficulties in joining the US in military action”. Mr Straw had said </p>
<p>it was “important that there was a sufficiently strong case against Saddam to move a </p>
<p>resolution at the UNSC”. The “objective was to ‘scare the pants off the Iraqis’”.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Following the meeting, a copy of the report of Sir Richard’s visit to Washington was </p>
<p>sent to Mr Straw’s office on 19 December.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>142. </b> By 24 December there were still “unresolved questions” about the SIS case.</p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>315</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq “continued to claim that it has not conducted any illicit WMD or </b></p>
<p><b>ballistic missile programmes since 1991”.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>There had been “No serious attempt” to answer any of the unresolved </b></p>
<p><b>questions highlighted by UNSCOM or to refute any of the points made in </b></p>
<p><b>the UK dossier on Iraq’s WMD programme.</b></p>
<p><b>144.  The JIC Assessment addressed the substance of the issues, but the </b></p>
<p><b>judgement that Iraq had made no attempt to deal with the points in the dossier </b></p>
<p><b>made the dossier a test for Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>145.  That was not its purpose. It was for the UN not the UK to define the bar </b></p>
<p><b>for Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>146. </b> An initial DIS Assessment of Iraq’s declaration of 7 December, based on an </p>
<p>analysis of the text provided in English and an attempt to translate the key sections </p>
<p>written in Arabic, was produced on 16 December.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>147. </b> On 18 December, the JIC discussed a draft Assessment, supported by the DIS </p>
<p>analysis of 16 December.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Comments recorded in the minutes of the discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “no significant disagreements of perception or judgement </p>
<p>between the UK and the US”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration was “surprisingly bad”; virtually none of the issues arising from </p>
<p>the 1999 UNSCOM report had been answered.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further analysis of the annexes “would be an enormous job”, and the UK “would </p>
<p>have to rely upon seeing the UN translation of much of the Arabic material”. </p>
<p>That text was “unlikely to contain the missing information”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be “a fuller assessment in due course”.</p>
<p><b>149. </b> The JIC Assessment, ‘An initial Assessment of Iraq’s WMD Declaration’, was </p>
<p>issued on 18 December, with the DIS Assessment of 16 December as an Annex.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>150. </b> The Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration failed “to address the issues outstanding from UNSCOM’s report </p>
<p>to the UN Security Council in 1999”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq maintained that it currently had “no proscribed WMD programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The majority of information in the declaration” had “already been passed to the </p>
<p>UN in some form”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The new material so far found” did “not alter UK assessments of Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration made “no attempt to deal with the points made in the </p>
<p>UK dossier”.</p>
<p><b>151. </b> The key elements of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 18 December 2002: </b></p>
<p><b>‘An Initial Assessment of Iraq’s WMD Declaration’</b></p>
<p>The Assessment rehearsed the UK’s knowledge of Iraq’s production of WMD before 1991 </p>
<p>and the material which UNSCOM had been “unable to account for”, and the judgements in </p>
<p>the September dossier.</p>
<p><b>Intelligence on the declaration</b></p>
<p>“Intelligence indicated in early November that Iraq was considering a number of options </p>
<p>… including a possible admission of a small proportion of its illegal activity. But by late </p>
<p>November intelligence indicated that Iraq’s declaration would omit references to its </p>
<p>banned weapons and that the aim was to overload UNMOVIC with information.” A senior </p>
<p>Iraqi official was quoted as saying “the declaration would be general and lacking in detail </p>
<p>and had been padded out with various scientific reports and studies”.</p>
<p><b>Overview</b></p>
<p>The declaration was “largely based on material already presented to the UN in previous </p>
<p>FFCDs [Full, Final, and Complete Declarations] and other correspondence”. “No </p>
<p>serious attempt” had “apparently been made to answer any of the unresolved questions </p>
<p>highlighted by UNSCOM or to refute any of the points made in the UK dossier”. </p>
<p>Iraq continued to “claim that it has not conducted any illicit WMD or ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes since 1991”. “Little new material … on the nuclear, chemical or biological </p>
<p>weapons” had been found; there was “some new material” on missiles.</p>
<p><b>Chemical weapons</b></p>
<p>The declaration was based on a June 1996 FFCD and additional information provided to </p>
<p>the UN before 1998. Some of that information had not been seen previously by the UK. </p>
<p>As well as the “unaccounted for” quantities of agent, precursors and munitions which </p>
<p>UNSCOM had identified, the declaration did not:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“provide a key document detailing the consumption of special munitions in the </p>
<p>1980s” which had been “removed from UNSCOM by the Iraqis”;</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“substantiate Iraq’s denials … that attempts were made to manufacture and </p>
<p>weaponise VX”.</p>
<p>The list of “over 30 sites in which chemical activity” took place was “incomplete”.</p>
<p>60 </p>
<p>A document found by an UNSCOM inspector in a safe in Iraqi Air Force headquarters in 1998. </p>
<p>It gave an account of the expenditure of bombs, including chemical bombs, by Iraq in the Iraq/Iran </p>
<p>war. It indicated that 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force between 1983 and </p>
<p>1988. Iraq had claimed that 19,500 bombs were consumed during that period. Iraq had taken the </p>
<p>document from the inspector.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>Biological weapons</b></p>
<p>The declaration reiterated information already provided to the UN, which had already been </p>
<p>reviewed. It failed to “provide a technically coherent account of Iraq’s biological weapons </p>
<p>programme”. The declaration provided new material relating to 40 sites which Iraq claimed </p>
<p>had no connection with proscribed activity but which were judged capable of supporting </p>
<p>a BW programme. It did not mention some dual-use sites previously monitored by </p>
<p>UNSCOM. Names of individuals included in previous declarations on biological weapons </p>
<p>had been “systematically removed”, although the declaration stated that they would be </p>
<p>“provided to UNMOVIC on request”.</p>
<p>It did not:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“address the issue of unaccounted for growth media”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“provide fully documented accounts” of the pre-1991 programmes or “recognition </p>
<p>of the military application”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“acknowledge any proscribed biological weapons activity post-1991”; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“mention … transportable production facilities”.</p>
<p><b>Nuclear weapons</b></p>
<p>The declaration was “largely the same as the FFCD” for activity pre-1991 which had been </p>
<p>issued in 1998, “with a new extended summary”. It was “accurate” but “incomplete”. It </p>
<p>maintained that no weapons-related work had been undertaken since 1998. It did not </p>
<p>address whether Iraq had been seeking uranium in Africa.</p>
<p><b>Ballistic missiles</b></p>
<p>Most of the data provided related to pre-1991 programmes. The declaration acknowledged </p>
<p>“some facilities established since 1998” and “known from intelligence”. It also provided </p>
<p>“some limited new evidence of proscribed missile development post-1991”. Two designs </p>
<p>were judged to have ranges greater than the limit of 150km.</p>
<p>The “major omissions” were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no attempt to resolve outstanding issues” relating to SCUD missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no mention of any post-1998 activity at many missile related facilities, including </p>
<p>the al-Rafah engine test stand”, which was “capable of testing engines for </p>
<p>missiles with ranges over 1000km”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no details of recent procurement activity associated with more advanced </p>
<p>missile propellant”.</p>
<p><b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)</b>:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration referred to “aborted attempts” to convert an anti-ship missile into </p>
<p>a land attack weapon with a range of 95km. The JIC judged the “system would </p>
<p>be suitable for chemical and biological delivery”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration claimed that the L-29 aircraft was “a target-drone” and there </p>
<p>“was no mention of a chemical or biological agent delivery capability”. The JIC </p>
<p>judged that Iraq had “more aircraft” and had “conducted more flight tests than </p>
<p>stated”; and that its range was “understated”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration provided “limited, but new information on two UAV programmes”, </p>
<p>which Iraq claimed had “started after 1998”, that had been included in reports </p>
<p>recently passed to UNMOVIC. They would be “used as target drones”. The </p>
<p>JIC judged that the UAVs “would have a significantly better performance” than </p>
<p>claimed and could be “adapted to chemical and biological agent delivery”.</p>
<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>
<p>The JIC concluded that the declaration so far analysed failed to address the outstanding </p>
<p>issues from UNSCOM’s report to the Security Council in 1999 and “made no attempt to </p>
<p>answer any of the points outlined in the UK dossier”. Iraq might:</p>
<p>“… feel they dealt with these points in their previous rebuttal of the dossier. Some of </p>
<p>the deficiencies may be addressed in the parts yet to be translated, but this does not </p>
<p>look likely.”</p>
<p><b>152. </b> On 20 December, Mr Miller sent Sir David Manning a further DIS overview of </p>
<p>Iraq’s declaration.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Miller re-stated the key findings outlined in the 18 December JIC Assessment </p>
<p>and identified the principal areas of apparent omission. The main new points </p>
<p>identified were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“an admission by the Iraqis that they have delivered 50 Al Samoud missiles to </p>
<p>their military. The UK dossier stated that at least 50 of these missiles had been </p>
<p>produced and were being deployed to military units;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>details of missile related procurement activities post-1998, which Iraq claims </p>
<p>were for permitted programmes. There are no details concerning the origin of </p>
<p>the material and equipment procured, some of which we judge were obtained </p>
<p>illicitly; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the document fails to cover refurbishment at potential BW sites.”</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr Miller reported that the DIS would continue to analyse the declaration when a </p>
<p>full English text was available from the UN. That was likely to be after Christmas.</p>
<p>SECURITY COUNCIL, 19 DECEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>155.  Dr Blix told the Security Council on 19 December that, while individual </b></p>
<p><b>governments had stated they had evidence which contradicted Iraq’s denial that </b></p>
<p><b>it had weapons of mass destruction, UNMOVIC was not yet in a position to give a </b></p>
<p><b>definitive view.</b></p>
<p><b>156. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported overnight on 17/18 December that Dr Blix would </p>
<p>tell the Security Council on 19 December that it could not have confidence that the </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>319</p>
<p>declaration “disposed of” the question of Iraq’s WMD holdings but that he could not say </p>
<p>Iraq definitely had WMD; there was more work to do and the ball was in Iraq’s court.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei briefed members of the Security Council on 19 December </p>
<p>on inspections in Iraq and their preliminary assessment of the Iraqi declaration.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Dr Blix told the Security Council on 19 December that, while individual </p>
<p>governments had stated they had evidence which contradicted Iraq’s denial that </p>
<p>it had weapons of mass destruction, UNMOVIC was not yet in a position to give </p>
<p>a definitive view.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> In his “necessarily provisional” comments on the Iraqi declaration, Dr Blix stated </p>
<p>that Iraq continued to state that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq </p>
<p>when inspectors left in December 1998 and that none had “been designed, procured, </p>
<p>produced or stored in the period since then”. While individual governments had stated </p>
<p>that they had “convincing evidence to the contrary”, UNMOVIC was, at that point, </p>
<p>“neither in a position to confirm Iraq’s statements, nor in possession of evidence </p>
<p>to disprove it”.</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Dr Blix added that, during the period between 1991 and 1998, Iraq had submitted </p>
<p>many declarations which had “proved inaccurate or incomplete or was unsupported </p>
<p>or contradicted by evidence”. Dr Blix stated:</p>
<p>“A declaration cannot, if it stands alone, create confidence. The listing of sites or </p>
<p>of persons, the reporting of production, importation, destruction and consumption </p>
<p>figures … is not enough to create confidence that no weapons programmes and </p>
<p>proscribed items remain. The statements need to be supported by documentation </p>
<p>or other evidence. Only so do they become verifiable.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> The overall impression was that “not much new significant information” </p>
<p>had been provided which related to proscribed programmes; nor had “much new </p>

<p><b>JIC priorities</b></p>
<p>Mr John Scarlett recorded that he had discussed the JIC’s priorities for January 2003 with </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 3 January.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> They had agreed that there would be:</p>
<p>“… a need to retest our standing judgements on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the continuing cohesion or otherwise of Saddam’s regime</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the developing attitudes of neighbouring/regional states</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the attitudes of the Kurds and other internal opposition forces”.</p>
<p>Mr Scarlett and Sir David had also agreed the JIC should attempt in mid-January to </p>
<p>answer the question “what will Saddam do now or next?” which “might allow us to retest </p>
<p>the standing judgements”.</p>
<p>Mr Scarlett wrote that he and Mr Julian Miller had agreed there would be a wider audience </p>
<p>“outside the MOD” for an “assessment of the significance of Iraqi military dispositions” and </p>
<p>its future options and strategy.</p>

<p><b>166. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that, at Chequers over Christmas 2002, he had </p>
<p>asked himself:</p>
<p>“What did I truly believe? That Saddam was about to attack Britain or the US? No. </p>
<p>That he was a bigger WMD threat than Iran or North Korea or Libya? Not really, </p>
<p>though he was the only leader to have used them. That left alone now, with these </p>
<p>inspections ending the same way as the last, he would threaten the stability of </p>
<p>the region? Very possibly. That he would leach WMD material or provide help to </p>
<p>terrorists? Yes …”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>167. </b> In a meeting overseas in early January, SIS1 told Mr Blair that the body of </p>
<p>available evidence was “highly damning” but “none of the reports could yet be termed </p>
<p>a silver bullet”.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> SIS1 told the Inquiry that Mr Blair had been “surprised and pleased” </p>
<p>that so much had been accumulated, but he needed some more evidence that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was in breach (of resolution 1441), which he (Mr Blair) could use as the basis </p>
<p>for personal assurances to Cabinet, the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP), and to </p>
<p>key allies such as Mr Jacques Chirac, the French President, and President Bush and </p>
<p>regional leaders. SIS1 recorded that, as a result, Mr Blair had asked for a “stocktake”, </p>
<p>including an assessment of the likelihood that the UNMOVIC process would produce </p>
<p>that kind of evidence.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> Asked whether that illustrated the pressure on SIS to produce something that </p>
<p>Mr Blair could use to justify supporting President Bush without necessarily having </p>
<p>a second Security Council resolution, SIS1 told the Inquiry that SIS was not under </p>
<p>“unusual pressure”.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> The meeting had taken place before the real diplomatic push to </p>
<p>secure a second resolution and the “evidence that would win that second resolution, </p>
<p>even over French scepticism and Russian obduracy … was in the balance”.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Asked whether SIS was being asked to find facts that would fit a policy that had </p>
<p>already been determined, SIS1 replied: “No”. In early 2003, he was “in no doubt … at </p>
<p>all” that the Americans were going to go in. The “dilemma for [the] British Government” </p>
<p>was whether to stand with the US and “intelligence could play a very significant part in </p>
<p>arriving at those decisions”.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Asked if Mr Blair would have got something significantly different from the </p>
<p>stocktake to what he was getting from the JIC, SIS1 replied: “No.”</p>

<p><b>172. </b> On 4 January, Mr Blair sent a long note to officials in No.10 (see Section 3.6).</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>173. </b> On Iraq, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“We start from behind. People suspect US motives; don’t accept Saddam is a threat; </p>
<p>worry it will make us a target. Yet the truth is removing Saddam is right; he is a </p>
<p>threat; and WMD has to be countered. So there is a big job of persuasion.”</p>
<p><b>174. </b> The actions proposed by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“most obviously, the evidence of breach of the UN resolution leading hopefully </p>
<p>to a new resolution. Time is short. We need either evidence of actual WMD; or </p>
<p>documentation concealed; or an eye witness account of the programme. We </p>
<p>are making efforts on all three. But one or more needs to be in place. […] our </p>
<p>biggest hindrance, is the intimidation Saddam is exercising. Those who might  </p>
<p>co-operate are being told very clearly their families will die. So even though we </p>
<p>all know the declaration … is a lie, proving the lie will be hard. I need an early </p>
<p>meeting on this with C [Sir Richard Dearlove].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We need to set out the WMD case generally; publish evidence of it; and have </p>
<p>some high profile interdiction of WMD material. People just totally underestimate </p>
<p>the WMD threat.”</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Mr Blair had a meeting with Sir Richard Dearlove on the afternoon of 9 January.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is no No.10 record of the meeting.</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Secretary recorded Sir Richard’s view that it had </p>
<p>been a good meeting at which Mr Blair had emphasised the importance of being able to </p>
<p>demonstrate that the Iraqis were in material breach of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>177. </b> In response to a question from Mr Blair about the likelihood of being able to find </p>
<p>a “silver bullet” that would demonstrate a material breach, Sir Richard was reported to </p>
<p>have said that “he felt the odds were 50/50”. That was “higher than the US estimates but </p>
<p>he simply could not guarantee a successful outcome”.</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Sir Richard had also reported that Mr Blair’s parting words were: “Richard, my fate </p>

<p>Sir Richard told Mr Blair that Dr Blix “knew he was being ‘cat and moused’ </p>
<p>but he was not on a mission. He was sure that Saddam was lying but he had </p>

<p>“The nightmare scenario, or one of them, was a discovery that was sufficient for </p>
<p>the US but not for us.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“C said the other risk was that we found the evidence of the breach before the </p>
<p>US was ready to go to war … if the inspectors had another month with genuine </p>
<p>access, the picture would be pretty clear. We were now pushing the line that </p>
<p>they needed time and space to do the job.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Asked about Mr Blair’s comment that his fate was in Sir Richard Dearlove’s hands, </p>

<p>The UK’s objectives were published in a Written Ministerial Statement by Mr Straw on </p>

<p>Mr Straw stated that the “prime objective” was:</p>
<p>“… to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated </p>
<p>programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles … as </p>
<p>set out in UNSCRs. This would reduce Iraq’s ability to threaten its neighbours and </p>
<p>the region, and prevent Iraq using WMD against its own people. UNSCRs also </p>
<p>require Iraq to renounce terrorism, and return captured Kuwaitis and property taken </p>
<p>from Kuwait.”</p>
<p>Mr Straw also stated:</p>
<p>“Success in achieving our prime objective should help deter the proliferation of WMD </p>
<p>and BM more generally.”</p>

<p>324</p>
<p><b>182. </b> As agreed on 19 December, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei gave an informal update of </p>
<p>their assessment of the Iraqi declaration and the progress of inspection activities to the </p>
<p>members of the Security Council on 9 January (see Section 3.6).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> The points made by </p>
<p>Dr Blix included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>His “overall impression” remained that Iraq’s declaration was “rich in volume </p>
<p>but poor in new information” and “practically devoid of new evidence on </p>
<p>such issues”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [T]o create confidence that it has no more weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>or proscribed activities relating to such weapons, Iraq must present </p>
<p>credible evidence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “not asserted … that proscribed items or activities” existed; but if they </p>
<p>did “Iraq should present them in our presence”. There was “still time” for that. </p>
<p>There was “no way the inspectors” could “close a file by simply invoking the </p>
<p>precept that Iraq cannot prove the negative”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a series of inconsistencies between the declaration and earlier Iraqi </p>
<p>declarations which had been described as full, final and complete, in addition to </p>
<p>the issues he had highlighted on 19 December, including in relation to special </p>
<p>munitions, imports of missile engines and solid missile fuel and VX.</p>
<p><b>UNMOVIC finds</b></p>

<p>On 30 December, UNMOVIC inspectors found some Volga missile engines.</p>

<p>80</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“For the most part the note repackages the contents of the September dossier </p>
<p>bringing out the key points, including quantities of WMD more clearly. There is some </p>
<p>limited updating to cover the work of UNMOVIC and concealment activities.”</p>
<p><b>187. </b> The key points in the note included:</p>
<p><b>Judgements in the dossier:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has a useable [sic] chemical and biological weapons capability, which </p>
<p>includes recent production of chemical and biological agents, and military plans </p>
<p>to use them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continues to work on developing nuclear weapons;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq possesses up to twenty 650km Al Hussein missiles, is developing </p>
<p>longer-range ballistic missiles, and is extending its shorter range systems </p>
<p>beyond the UN permitted range of 150km.”</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s declaration of 7 December 2002:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “not taken the opportunity … to explain the issues outstanding from </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq maintained that it currently had “no proscribed WMD programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN already had the “majority of information” in the declaration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration did “not alter UK assessments of Iraq’s WMD programmes”.</p>
<p><b>Chemical weapons:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could produce mustard gas, tabun, sarin and VX nerve agents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had had “chemical weapons available from both pre-Gulf War stocks and </p>
<p>more recent production”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK did “not know exactly how much CW agent” was available. While it </p>
<p>believed current holdings were “less than” the 360 tonnes for which UNSCOM </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has biological weapons available, both from pre-Gulf War stocks and more </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could “produce at least” anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK did “not know how much agent” Iraq had, but it had “admitted to </p>
<p>producing 19,000 litres of botulinum toxin, 8,500 litres of anthrax and 2,200 litres </p>
<p>of aflatoxin” before the 1990-1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had been unable to account for the growth media Iraq had procured </p>
<p>which was “enough for 25,000 litres of anthrax”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “developed mobile agent production facilities, which makes it extremely </p>
<p>difficult for inspectors to find them”.</p>
<p>Without distinguishing between chemical and biological capabilities, the minute stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UNSCOM could not account for over 30,000 CBW munitions, including </p>
<p>550 mustard filled artillery shells.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “admitted to producing CBW warheads for its Al Hussein </p>

<p>Iraq had “manufactured up to 100 short range ballistic missiles” and was “aiming </p>

<p>Chief of Defence Intelligence and the Press Offices of the MOD and the FCO.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>190. </b> In response to a request for themes which Mr Blair could use with the press, </p>
<p>and in particular on <i>Breakfast with Frost</i> on 26 January, SIS1 submitted advice to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 25 January.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>191. </b> That set out four “Themes from CX”, “for use with the press”. The points to </p>
<p>make included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Giving the UN the run around: </b>Saddam Hussein was “determined to keep his </p>
<p>weapons” and believed he could “successfully hide them from the UN”. There </p>
<p>was “reliable intelligence, which we have been sharing with the UN inspectors, </p>
<p>that for the last few months the Iraqis have been dispersing and concealing </p>
<p>the evidence: hiding munitions for chemical warfare, engines for long-range </p>
<p>missiles, top secret documents”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Spying on the inspectors: </b>intelligence had “confirmed” that there was “a huge, </p>
<p>well co-ordinated Iraqi operation to spy on the inspectors … there are well </p>
<p>rehearsed plans to prevent them from having access to sites where the weapons </p>
<p>are concealed. Iraq’s security agents have orders even to stage car accidents, if </p>
<p>necessary, to prevent at all costs the inspectors from finding anything significant. </p>
<p>These agents dare not fail: they know only too well what the consequences for </p>
<p>them personally would be.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein rules by fear and repression:</b> “we have intelligence </p>
<p>Saddam has ordered that any scientists who dare to co-operate will be severely </p>
<p>punished, even killed, along with their families. They have been forced to </p>
<p>hide secret documents at home. Iraq’s ruthless security apparatus has placed </p>
<p>minders alongside everyone who could give the game away to inspectors to </p>
<p>ensure that they don’t step out of line and to remind them what will happen to </p>
<p>them if they do.”</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>192. </b> In his extended interview on the <i>BBC</i>’s <i>Breakfast with Frost</i> programme on </p>
<p>26 January (see Section 3.6), Mr Blair set out in detail his position on Iraq.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Asked whether Dr Blix should be given more time, Mr Blair stated that the </p>
<p>inspectors had “to be given the time to do the job”, but there was “confusion” about </p>
<p>what that job was. The time they needed was to certify whether Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“fully co-operating or not”. Saddam Hussein had to provide information on “exactly what </p>
<p>weapons material” he had, “allowing the inspectors to inspect it, monitor it and shut it </p>
<p>down”. If they were not able to do that job, Saddam Hussein would have to be disarmed </p>
<p>by force. That should not take months, but Saddam Hussein was not co-operating.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Pressed as to whether non-compliance rather than evidence of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction justified “a war”, Mr Blair replied that he “profoundly” disagreed with the idea </p>
<p>that a refusal to co-operate was of a “lesser order”. He added:</p>
<p>“… what we know is that he has this material … we know there is something like </p>
<p>350 tonnes of chemical warfare agent. We know there is something like 30,000 </p>
<p>special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t even told us where those old leftovers from 1998 are … we know … that </p>
<p>there is an elaborate process … of concealment …</p>
<p>“… [T]he people that the inspectors want to interview … are being told, by the Iraqi </p>
<p>authorities, they can only come for interviews with an Iraqi … minder, and only be </p>
<p>interviewed in certain places.</p>
<p>“And we know also from intelligence that these people’s families are being told that if </p>
<p>they co-operate and give any information at all they will be executed.</p>
<p>“… [I]f he fails to co-operate in being honest and he is pursuing a programme of </p>
<p>concealment, that is every bit as much a breach as finding, for example, a missile or </p>
<p>chemical agent.”</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Asked whether there would be “another dossier” setting out what UK intelligence </p>
<p>had discovered, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… we have the intelligence that says that Saddam has continued to develop these </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction; that what he’s doing is using a whole lot of dual-use </p>
<p>facilities in order to manufacture chemical and biological weapons; and … that there </p>
<p>is an elaborate programme of concealment … forcing the inspectors to play a game </p>
<p>of hide and seek.”</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Asked if he had sufficient evidence to back action, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… I’ve got no doubt at all that he’s developing these weapons and that he poses a </p>
<p>threat but we made a choice to go down the UN route …</p>

<p>“… our judgement, the American judgement … is that Saddam has these weapons, </p>
<p>but the purpose of the inspectors … is … to report back to the UN and say whether </p>
<p>he is fully co-operating or he’s not.”</p>
<p><b>Security Council, 27 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>197.  Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on 27 January that Iraq’s declaration </b></p>
<p><b>of 7 December did not provide new evidence which would eliminate or reduce the </b></p>
<p><b>unresolved issues identified in 1999.</b></p>
<p><b>198. </b> As required in resolution 1441, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei made their first reports to </p>
<p>the Security Council on 27 January (see Section 3.6).</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Dr Blix stated:</p>
<p>“One might have expected … that Iraq might have tried to respond to, clarify and </p>
<p>submit supporting evidence regarding the many open disarmament issues, which </p>
<p>the Iraqi side should be familiar with from the UNSCOM document S/1999/94 of </p>
<p>January 1999 and the so-called Amorim Report of March 1999 … These are the </p>
<p>questions which UNMOVIC, governments and independent commentators have </p>
<p>often cited.”</p>
<p><b>200. </b> UNMOVIC had found “the issues listed in those two documents as unresolved, </p>
<p>professionally justified”. The reports pointed to:</p>
<p>“… lack of evidence and inconsistencies … which must be straightened out, if </p>
<p>weapons dossiers are to be closed … They deserve to be taken seriously by Iraq </p>
<p>rather than being brushed aside as evil machinations of UNSCOM. Regrettably, </p>
<p>the … declaration, most of which is a reprint of earlier documents, does not </p>
<p>seem to contain any new evidence that would eliminate the questions or reduce </p>
<p>their number.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Dr Blix set out examples of questions and issues that needed to be addressed in </p>
<p>some detail, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had information indicating that Iraq had worked on purifying </p>
<p>and stabilising the nerve agent VX, and had achieved more than it had </p>
<p>declared. This conflicted with the Iraqi account that the agent had only been </p>
<p>produced on a pilot scale, which had been destroyed in 1991, and was never </p>
<p>weaponised. There were also questions to be answered about the fate of VX </p>
<p>precursor chemicals.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had provided a copy of the “Air Force” document it had withheld in 1998. </p>
<p>It indicated that 13,000 chemical bombs were dropped by the Iraqi Air Force </p>
<p>between 1983 and 1988. Iraq had claimed that 19,500 bombs were consumed </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>during that period. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, UNMOVIC “must </p>
<p>assume these quantities are now unaccounted for”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The discovery of “a number of 122mm chemical rocket warheads in a bunker at </p>
<p>a storage depot southwest of Baghdad”. The bunker was relatively new, which </p>
<p>meant “the rockets must have been moved there in the past few years, at a time </p>
<p>when Iraq should not have had such munitions”. Iraq had stated that they were </p>
<p>“overlooked from 1991 from a batch of 2,000 that were stored there during the </p>
<p>Gulf War. That could be the case. They could also be the tip of a submerged </p>
<p>iceberg. The discovery of a few rockets does not resolve, but rather points to, </p>
<p>the issue of several thousands of chemical rockets that are unaccounted for.” </p>
<p>Iraq had subsequently found four more chemical rockets at a storage depot in </p>
<p>al-Taji. The warheads were “empty”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspectors had found “a laboratory quantity of thiodiglycal, a mustard gas </p>
<p>precursor”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “strong indications that Iraq produced more anthrax than it declared, </p>
<p>and that at least some of this was retained after the declared destruction date. </p>
<p>It might still exist.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not declared “a significant quantity of bacterial growth media” which had </p>
<p>been included in Iraq’s submission to the Amorim panel. This omission appeared </p>
<p>“to be deliberate as the pages of the resubmitted document were renumbered”. </p>
<p>The quantity of growth media involved would “suffice to produce … about </p>
<p>5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Al Samoud 2 and Al Fatah missiles “might well represent <i>prima facie</i> cases </p>
<p>of proscribed systems” but further technical consideration would be necessary </p>
<p>before reaching a conclusion on the issue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had refurbished its missile production infrastructure, including a number </p>
<p>of casting chambers which were capable of producing motors for missiles with </p>
<p>ranges greater than the 150km limit.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had illegally imported 300 rocket engines which might be for the Al Samoud 2, </p>
<p>chemicals used in propellents and other potentially proscribed items.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> Dr Blix questioned Iraq’s claims that there were no more documents about its </p>
<p>activities. After the discovery of documents in the home of a scientist “relating to the </p>
<p>laser enrichment of uranium”, UNMOVIC could not “help but think that the case might </p>
<p>not be isolated and that such placements of documents is deliberate to make discovery </p>
<p>difficult”. He warned that: “Any further sign of the concealment of documents would </p>
<p>be serious.”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Dr Blix also questioned whether Iraq had provided a complete list of the names of </p>
<p>personnel who had worked on proscribed programmes, and pointed out the difficulties of </p>
<p>interviewing individuals “in private”. He reported that UNMOVIC had asked 11 individuals </p>
<p>for interview in Baghdad and that none of them would speak without the presence of an </p>
<p>Iraqi official.</p>

<p>331</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Commenting on Iraqi demonstrations against the inspectors at a number of sites, </p>
<p>Dr Blix told the Security Council:</p>
<p>“Demonstrations and outbursts of this kind are unlikely to occur in Iraq without </p>
<p>initiative or encouragement from the authorities … They do not facilitate an already </p>
<p>difficult job … Where our Iraqi counterparts have some complaint they can take it up </p>
<p>in a calmer and less unpleasant manner.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> In his memoir, Dr Blix wrote:</p>
<p>“There were some cases of demonstrations against the inspectors, though hardly </p>
<p>threatening ones. They occurred at our Baghdad office, at a hospital site and during </p>
<p>the inspection of the private home that yielded nuclear documents.”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>206.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had found no evidence that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>revived its nuclear weapons programme but it was still investigating a number </b></p>
<p><b>of issues.</b></p>
<p><b>207. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had conducted 139 inspections at some </p>
<p>106 locations, with a “focus on areas of concern identified by other States, facilities </p>
<p>identified through satellite imagery as having been modified or constructed since 1998, </p>
<p>and other inspection leads identified independently”. They had been able to “gain ready </p>
<p>access and to clarify the nature of the activities” at those facilities. “No prohibited nuclear </p>
<p>activities” had been identified.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>208. </b> Iraq’s unsuccessful attempts to procure high-strength aluminium tubes which </p>
<p>Iraq had indicated were related to a programme to reverse-engineer conventional </p>
<p>rockets, had been a particular focus. The IAEA had concluded that the tubes “would be </p>
<p>consistent with” use in a conventional rocket programme. They “would not be suitable </p>
<p>for manufacturing centrifuges” without modification. The IAEA was “still investigating” the </p>
<p>issue, but the attempt to acquire such tubes was “prohibited” by resolution 687 (1991).</p>
<p><b>209. </b> The IAEA was investigating how “dual-use” material had been relocated or used, </p>
<p>including the “HMX”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> explosive which had been removed from IAEA seals at the end of </p>
<p>1998. Dr ElBaradei stated that it would be difficult to verify how that had been used.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> The IAEA was investigating reports of Iraqi efforts to import uranium but it did “not </p>
<p>have enough information, and … would appreciate more”.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Iraq had not provided “any new information relevant to … questions which had </p>
<p>been outstanding since 1998”; but those questions did “not constitute unresolved </p>
<p>disarmament issues”.</p>

<p><b>212. </b> Dr ElBaradei concluded:</p>
<p>“… we have to date found no evidence that Iraq has revived its nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme since the elimination of the programme in the 1990s … [O]ur work is </p>
<p>steadily progressing and should be allowed to run its natural course … [W]e should </p>
<p>be able within the next few months to provide credible assurance that Iraq has no </p>
<p>nuclear weapons programme. These few months … would be a valuable investment </p>
<p>in peace because they could help us avoid a war. We trust that we will continue </p>
<p>to have the support of the Council … to verify Iraq’s nuclear disarmament through </p>
<p>peaceful means and to demonstrate that the inspection process can and does work </p>
<p>as a central feature of the international nuclear arms control regime.”</p>
<p><b>Extracts from President Bush’s State of the Union address, </b></p>
<p><b>28 January 2003</b></p>
<p>In his State of the Union address on 28 January, President Bush emphasised the threat of </p>
<p>terrorism to the US and others, the potential threat from Iraq in that context and the need </p>
<p>to disarm Iraq.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>President Bush’s detailed statements about the threat posed by Iraq included:</p>
<p>“The United Nations concluded in 1999 that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons </p>
<p>sufficient to produce over 25,000 liters of anthrax – enough doses to kill several </p>
<p>million people. He hasn’t accounted for that material. He has given no evidence that </p>
<p>he has destroyed it.</p>
<p>“The United Nations concluded that Saddam Hussein had material sufficient to </p>
<p>produce more than 38,000 liters of botulinum toxin …</p>
<p>“Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam Hussein had the materials to produce </p>
<p>as much as 500 tonnes of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent …</p>
<p>“US intelligence indicates that Saddam Hussein had upwards of 30,000 munitions </p>
<p>capable of delivering chemical agents. Inspectors recently turned up 16 of them – </p>
<p>despite Iraq’s recent declaration denying their existence …</p>
<p>“From three Iraqi defectors we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile </p>
<p>biological weapons labs …</p>
<p>“The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed in the 1990s that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had an advanced nuclear weapons development program … The British Government </p>
<p>has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from </p>
<p>Africa. Our intelligence sources tell us that he has attempted to purchase high-strength </p>
<p>aluminium tubes suitable for nuclear weapons production. Saddam Hussein has not </p>
<p>credibly explained these activities. He clearly has much to hide.”</p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>333</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>213.  The JIC assessed on 29 January that retaining WMD was a vital Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>interest and that Saddam Hussein was unlikely to agree to relinquish power </b></p>
<p><b>or go into exile.</b></p>
<p><b>214.  The JIC sustained its earlier judgements on Iraq’s ability and intent to </b></p>
<p><b>conduct terrorist operations.</b></p>
<p><b>215. </b> At the request of the FCO, the JIC reviewed current developments in Iraq from </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s perspective and possible Iraqi moves in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>216. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion on 29 January record that the draft Assessment </p>
<p>had been difficult to write given the fast-moving developments, and it was important </p>
<p>to ensure it reflected the latest information, especially the UNMOVIC perspective.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The minutes also recorded that:</p>
<p>“… it was difficult to predict if and when Saddam might launch pre-emptive strikes, </p>
<p>but the paper should try and make a judgement on possible timescales. The trigger </p>
<p>would probably be set when Saddam concluded that his fate was sealed, rather </p>
<p>than any movements by Coalition Forces. Most of the Iraqi military would probably </p>
<p>crumble quickly under attack. Saddam would maintain his hold on power until then, </p>
<p>and there were no indications of possible coups beforehand. Whilst the Iraqi public </p>
<p>might welcome the end of Saddam’s regime, they were also concerned about the </p>
<p>human costs of fighting.”</p>
<p><b>217. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements about weapons of mass destruction were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Retaining WMD remains a vital Iraqi interest. Saddam might nevertheless </p>
<p>consider a last minute tactical declaration of some of his WMD to avert a war, </p>
<p>believing that he can rebuild his WMD capability later.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam probably believes he has some strong political and military cards to </p>
<p>play, even in the face of an inevitable attack. … He may … fire CBW against </p>
<p>Coalition Forces …”</p>

<p>use are set out in the Box below.</p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq: The Emerging View from Baghdad’</b></p>
<p><b>Inspections</b></p>
<p>The JIC had “judged in October” that:</p>
<p>“Saddam was confident he could prevent UNMOVIC from finding any evidence </p>
<p>before military options started to close off … and that concealment and dispersal </p>
<p>of sensitive items were the basis of Iraq’s strategy. […] But by mid-January there </p>
<p>were signs that Iraq was coming under pressure from UNMOVIC finds that were </p>
<p>inconsistent with its December 2002 declaration. […]</p>
<p>“[…] Intelligence is unclear, but it is possible the UNMOVIC discoveries have </p>
<p>increased Iraqi uncertainty. Blix’s tough statement to the Security Council on </p>
<p>27 January surprised Baghdad and may have increased the regime’s concerns about </p>
<p>UNMOVIC. Saddam Hussein continues to believe that the possession of WMD is a </p>
<p>vital Iraqi interest. […] Any WMD admission would therefore be tactical rather than </p>
<p>indicative of a genuine change of policy.”</p>
<p><b>Iraqi military preparations</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would have “little incentive to launch such a strike while the </p>
<p>Iraqi strategy focuses on convincing UNMOVIC that Iraq does not have WMD </p>
<p>holdings”, but it might “become an attractive option in the face of imminent </p>
<p>Coalition military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “pre-emptive limited artillery strike on Kuwait using CBW could be launched </p>
<p>in as little as two hours”.</p>
<p><b>Saddam’s mindset</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “under increasing pressure” as the inspections regime </p>
<p>intensified, UNMOVIC had made “significant discoveries” and the Coalition </p>
<p>military build-up continued.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that Saddam Hussein had “underestimated UNMOVIC’s capability </p>
<p>to expose his deception”. He had “failed to realise that he was facing a situation </p>
<p>different from the days of UNSCOM”. UNMOVIC’s “limited success” highlighted </p>
<p>the “risks Saddam took in providing a weak declaration of Iraq’s WMD-holdings”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the face of an attack, or even before hostilities if he judged that an attack was </p>
<p>imminent,” Saddam Hussein might take a number of actions, including:</p>
<p>– making a last minute declaration of his WMD;</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>– inflicting “high enough casualties on any Coalition ground forces, perhaps </p>
<p>in Kuwait, including through use of CBW, to halt a Coalition attack and to </p>
<p>swing public opinion in the West against hostilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once hostilities were underway”, Saddam Hussein might also:</p>
<p>– “… seek to cause an international outcry over the level of Iraqi or Coalition </p>
<p>casualties”; and</p>
<p>– “pursue a scorched earth policy, including the destruction of oil wells and </p>
<p>poisoning the water supply”.</p>

<p><b>219. </b> Sir David Manning visited Washington on 29 January for talks with Dr Rice (see </p>
<p>Section 3.6).</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> He was accompanied by Sir Richard Dearlove. Sir David reported </p>
<p>that Sir Richard Dearlove had “briefed in detail on our intelligence” which the US </p>
<p>Administration “clearly find very impressive”.</p>
<p><b>220.  Mr Scarlett assured Sir David Manning on 30 January that the intelligence </b></p>
<p><b>reporting was “consistent and convincing”, and there was no evidence that </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein was considering the renunciation of WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>221.  Mr Scarlett also highlighted the need for the Government to take seriously </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s options for using chemical and biological weapons and missiles.</b></p>
<p><b>222. </b> In addition to the JIC Assessment of 29 January, Mr Scarlett sent </p>
<p>Sir David Manning his “personal observations on the overall intelligence picture”, </p>
<p>which addressed Saddam Hussein’s mindset and likely actions.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>223. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“Our intelligence reporting has been consistent and convincing. I have not seen a </p>
<p>single reference to Saddam even considering the renunciation of WMD to save his </p>
<p>regime (and probably his own life).”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Addressing WMD and inspections, Mr Scarlett wrote that Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>“followed essentially the same strategy and tactics as during the 1990s”. He had </p>
<p>“probably … considered making a ‘partial’ declaration of WMD holdings”, but “even that </p>
<p>has proved too difficult, at least so far”. Mr Scarlett suggested that would be “an obvious </p>
<p>tactic to deploy at the very last minute” but, in his view, a “genuinely full and open </p>
<p>renunciation” was:</p>
<p>“… simply too dangerous. It would remove the one weapon of last resort with which </p>
<p>Saddam can threaten his population and neighbours and send a signal of weakness </p>
<p>to both with possibly unmanageable consequences (for him). Given the decision </p>
<p>not to come clean, a ‘partial’ admission (for example in the 7 December declaration) </p>
<p>would have been a big risk. The chance of opening up lines of investigation to </p>
<p>what was still being concealed would have been too great. Better to submit a flat </p>
<p>denial leaving no loose ends. From Saddam’s point of view, that was probably the </p>
<p>right decision.”</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Scarlett added that the Iraq position had:</p>
<p>“… certainly made it more difficult to find concrete proof of his WMD and leaves him </p>
<p>the continuing options of concealment and delay.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>336</p>
<p>“Until now, Saddam and his closest advisers have seemed confident that </p>
<p>concealment would work. Oddly, they have not appeared worried by the obvious risk </p>
<p>of leaks from the thousands of people aware of this concealment activity. They have </p>
<p>relied on the brutal discipline of the regime and so far it has worked. Even now we </p>
<p>cannot be confident of finding really significant evidence of retained WMD.”</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Mr Scarlett suggested Iraq had recognised that:</p>
<p>“The one clear weak point in the policy … has been interviews, especially interviews </p>
<p>outside Iraq. The regime has no choice but to continue to resist these. They may </p>
<p>be able to give a bit of ground on ‘private’ interviews inside Iraq although they </p>
<p>will hesitate about meetings in UNMOVIC’s Baghdad HQ … Everywhere else, </p>
<p>and even in the HQ, they can probably feel confident that the overall level </p>
<p>of extreme intimidation will deter interviewees. This is the nature of this kind of </p>
<p>totalitarian regime … And why put your life and that of your family in the hands of </p>
<p>an inspector …?”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded that it was “proving more difficult to deal with the new </p>
<p>inspection regime than Saddam and his close advisers probably expected”. Events were </p>
<p>“moving faster than anticipated” and Dr Blix was “now pursuing the line that ‘passive </p>
<p>cooperation’ is coming close to non-co-operation”. For Iraq, that would be “difficult to </p>
<p>handle” because Dr Blix was:</p>
<p>“… pushing Saddam close to red lines he cannot afford (outside interviews) or is </p>
<p>simply not able (proof of destruction of VX, chemical munitions, etc) to cross. But if </p>
<p>you are Saddam you do not give up hope. The key tactic remains delay in the hope </p>
<p>or expectation that something will turn up …”</p>
<p><b>228. </b> Addressing Saddam Hussein’s hold on power, Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“I continue to be struck by the regime’s ability to conduct complex surveillance and </p>
<p>deception operations without unforced errors or major slip ups. Co-ordinating the </p>
<p>dispersal of materials and associated documentation around the country and fielding </p>
<p>surprise UNMOVIC and IAEA visits to hundreds of sites in a few weeks is a complex </p>
<p>undertaking and evidence of the regime’s continuing grip on the population at least </p>
<p>of central Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>229. </b> Addressing Saddam Hussein’s options after an invasion, Mr Scarlett wrote that: </p>
<p>“Given the perceived inability of his enemies [the Coalition] to take significant casualties </p>
<p>or setbacks”, the Government should take seriously the options available identified </p>
<p>in the JIC Assessment “to give us pause even after a military operation begins”. </p>
<p>He “picked out”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Attempted use of CBW and missiles … immediately before an attack or (in </p>
<p>Kuwait and southern Iraq) in the early stages of the attack itself.” That would </p>
<p>be “Very difficult to pull off”, but “even a small number of short range artillery </p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>

<p>rockets getting through would have a disproportionate effect” and it was “not </p>
<p>unreasonable for Saddam to think it would give us second thoughts”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“CBW armed Al Hussein attack on Israel. Again very difficult to achieve, but the </p>
<p>benefits of success are obvious.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A move against the Kurds either immediately before or after a Coalition </p>

<p><b>232. </b> In the subsequent discussion it was suggested that the onus was on Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein to explain the discrepancies between the Iraqi declaration and a series of </p>
<p>unanswered questions: “about 223 missile motors imported illegally; the production </p>
<p>of VX nerve agent; 6,500 missing chemical bombs; 12 newly stored chemical shells; </p>
<p>and the refusal to allow [Iraqi] scientists to be interviewed in private” listed by Dr Blix. </p>

<p>Mr Sabri also stated that the 518 inspections since 27 November, which included all </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>Iraq had “a huge infrastructure of deception and concealment designed to prevent the </p>
<p>inspectors from doing their job”.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> In response to a request from Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, for </p>
<p>the Government to make available any further intelligence relevant to the security of the </p>
<p>UK or its citizens, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“We issued further intelligence over the weekend about the infrastructure of </p>
<p>concealment. It is obviously difficult when we publish intelligence reports, but I hope </p>
<p>that people have some sense of the integrity of our security services. They are not </p>
<p>publishing this, or giving us this information, and making it up. It is the intelligence </p>
<p>that they are receiving and we are passing it on to people. In the dossier that we </p>
<p>published last year, and again in the material that we put out over the weekend, it is </p>
<p>very clear that a vast amount of concealment and deception is going on.”</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The report, ‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’, </p>
<p>stated that it drew on “a number of sources, including intelligence material” and showed </p>
<p>how the Iraqi regime was “constructed to have, and to keep, WMD”, and was “now </p>
<p>engaged in a campaign of obstruction” of the UN inspectors.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>237. </b> The document was in three parts:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Part One</b> focused on how Iraq’s security organisations operated “to conceal” </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction;</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Part Two</b> provided “up to date details of Iraq’s network of intelligence and </p>
<p>security organisations whose job it is to keep Saddam and his regime in power, </p>
<p>and to prevent the international community from disarming Iraq”; and</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Part Three</b> showed “the effects of the security apparatus on the ordinary people </p>
<p>of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> In Part One, the document stated that Iraqi security organisations worked “together </p>
<p>to conceal documents equipment and materials” and the regime had:</p>
<p>“… intensified efforts to hide documents in places where they were unlikely to </p>
<p>be found, such as private homes of low-level officials and universities. There are </p>
<p>prohibited materials and documents being relocated to agricultural areas and private </p>
<p>homes or hidden beneath hospitals and even mosques.</p>
<p>“The material is being moved constantly, making it difficult to trace or find without </p>
<p>absolutely fresh intelligence.</p>
<p>“And those in whose homes this material is concealed have been warned of serious </p>
<p>consequences to them and their families if it is discovered.”</p>

<p><b>239. </b> The report described Iraqi activities to monitor UNMOVIC’s activities, including that </p>
<p>all interviews would be monitored and, in relation to any interviews outside Iraq, that:</p>
<p>“All scientists and key workers have been made to draw up a list of their relatives … </p>
<p>The interviewees know only too well what will happen to them, or their relatives still </p>
<p>in Iraq, if it is even suspected that they have said too much …”</p>
<p><b>240. </b> The report stated that Iraq would seek to intimidate and put psychological pressure </p>
<p>on individual inspectors.</p>
<p><b>241. </b> On 6 February, <i>Channel 4 News</i> reported accusations that the report contained </p>
<p>material drawn from published articles, including one by Dr Ibrahim al-Marashi </p>
<p>from September 2002, which had been published in the <i>Middle East Review of </i></p>
<p><i>International Affairs</i>.</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The FCO informed the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) on 16 June 2003 that </p>
<p>the report was compiled by the CIC, “a cross-government team” which reported to </p>
<p>Mr Campbell but which was based in the FCO.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Campbell told the FAC that the document was:</p>
<p>“… intended as a briefing paper for journalists to inform them of the way in which </p>
<p>the Iraqi state was dominated by its security apparatus and therefore well placed to </p>
<p>conceal WMD. When new intelligence material came to light, which was authorised </p>
<p>for use in the public domain, which revealed the scale of the regime’s programme of </p>
<p>deception and concealment, it was my idea … to base a briefing paper for the media </p>
<p>upon it and this approach was agreed by the Iraq communication group in early </p>
<p>January, and the paper worked on during that month.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Campbell stated that the CIC was commissioned to produce the paper. He had </p>
<p>edited it and changed the title, and informed Mr Blair about the nature of the report and </p>
<p>its intended purpose, before it was given it to “six representatives of the UK Sunday </p>
<p>newspapers” travelling to Washington with Mr Blair. The document had subsequently </p>
<p>been posted on the No.10 website on 3 February and placed in the House of Commons </p>
<p>Library the same day.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Campbell stated that Dr al-Marashi’s article had been submitted to the CIC and </p>
<p>had been “absorbed into the briefing paper, without attribution”. It “formed the basis” of </p>
<p>Part Two of the report and was then assumed by those asked to comment on the report </p>
<p>to have come from Government sources.</p>

<p>the report were “based on information provided by SIS from a range of sources”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was also some intelligence material in Part Two, and Mr Campbell provided </p>
<p>some examples.</p>
<p><b>247. </b> The Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) was informed that the SIS </p>
<p>representative at Mr Campbell’s meeting in January had offered to provide a briefing </p>
<p>note on the organisation of deception, concealment and intimidation in Iraq as SIS had </p>
<p>“acquired a body of information on these matters”.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> The document provided by SIS was </p>
<p>published by the ISC in its report.</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Mr Campbell wrote to the CIC authors on 7 February pointing out the “absolute </p>
<p>necessity of quality control”.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> That was “particularly important in any document … </p>
<p>that includes intelligence assessment”. He took responsibility for the document and he </p>
<p>“would defend it on substance”, but he had to be “able to make basic assumptions about </p>
<p>quality control”.</p>
<p><b>249. </b> Mr Campbell added that:</p>
<p>“… as the prospect of conflict grows, we have to be extra sensitive to the fact that </p>
<p>the media will want to pick apart our communications.</p>
<p>“So lessons must be learnt from this, and greater emphasis placed on quality not </p>
<p>quantity, and acute sensitivity to the new political and media realities.”</p>
<p><b>250. </b> On 11 February, Sir David Omand, Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary and </p>
<p>Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator, issued guidance on the use of intelligence in CIC </p>
<p>products, including the need for the lead policy department to be “fully consulted”.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Pointing out that “the reputation of the intelligence community” was “at risk” whenever </p>
<p>intelligence material and judgements were “attributed to the Government”, Sir David </p>
<p>proposed applying the following rules:</p>
<p>“a. where intelligence is to be used attributably, in whatever form, the precise </p>
<p>wording must be cleared with the Agency originating the material and the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff; </p>
<p>b. where the attributable product is to be released under the rubric that intelligence </p>
<p>material is involved, the document as a whole must be cleared with the </p>

<p><b>251. </b> Asked about the origins and accuracy of the dossier published by No.10 during </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Questions on 13 February, Mr Blair said that the part of the document </p>
<p>that dealt with intelligence was from intelligence sources and was accurate, as was the </p>
<p>document as a whole.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Mr Blair “had said publicly that Dr al-Marashi should have been acknowledged </p>
<p>as a source”, and that the journal in which his article was published should have </p>
<p>been identified.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>253. </b> The FCO told the FAC that lessons had been learned from the way the report </p>
<p>had been handled and systems had been put in place “to ensure that any intelligence </p>
<p>material which is made available publicly will first be authorised by the JIC Chairman”.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>254. </b> In its report published on 7 July 2003, the FAC concluded:</p>
<p>“… the effect of the February dossier was almost wholly counter-productive. By </p>
<p>producing such a document the Government undermined the credibility of their </p>
<p>case for war and of the other documents which were part of it.</p>
<p>“… [B]y referring to the document on the floor of the House as ‘further </p>
<p>intelligence’ the Prime Minister – who had not been informed of its provenance … </p>
<p>misrepresented its status and thus inadvertently made a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>“… [I]t is wholly unacceptable for the Government to plagiarise work … and to </p>
<p>amend it without … highlighting the amendments … [I]t was fundamentally wrong </p>
<p>to allow such a document to be presented to Parliament and made widely available </p>
<p>without ministerial oversight.</p>
<p>“We recommend that any paper presented to Parliament … for the purpose of </p>
<p>explaining the Government’s foreign policy be signed off by a FCO Minister. We </p>
<p>further recommend that any FCO document presented to Parliament which draws </p>

<p>The overall accuracy of the document has never been challenged.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair “did not misrepresent the status of the document. It did contain </p>

<p><b>258. </b> In his presentation to the Security Council on 5 February, Secretary Powell stated </p>

<p>facts and disturbing patterns of behaviour” that demonstrated that Saddam Hussein and </p>
<p>his regime had “made no effort to disarm as required by the international community” </p>
<p>and was “concealing their efforts to produce more weapons”.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Secretary Powell provided tapes of intercepted conversations and satellite imagery </p>
<p>which he interpreted as demonstrating Iraq’s attempts to conceal activity to “clean up” </p>
<p>facilities before visits by the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>261. </b> Secretary Powell also stated that human sources had told the US that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqis were moving “not just documents and hard drives but also weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction to keep them from being found by inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [W]e know from sources that [last fall] a missile brigade outside Baghdad </p>
<p>was disbursing rocket launchers and warheads containing biological warfare </p>
<p>agents to various locations, distributing them to various locations in western </p>
<p>Iraq. Most of the launchers … were to be moved every one to four weeks to </p>
<p>escape detection.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the </p>
<p>serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed </p>
<p>any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents </p>
<p>acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave </p>
<p>Iraq. Anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as </p>
<p>a spy.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “false death certificate” had been issued for one scientist, and he was “sent </p>
<p>into hiding” and a “dozen experts have been placed under house arrest … at </p>
<p>one of Saddam Hussein’s ‘guest houses’”.</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Secretary Powell added that the “information and intelligence” pointed to “an active </p>
<p>and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep materials and people from </p>
<p>the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Secretary Powell stated that Iraq had failed the test of providing an honest </p>
<p>declaration and the conclusion that Iraq was now in further material breach of its </p>
<p>obligation was “irrefutable and undeniable”. Iraq had “placed itself in danger of the </p>
<p>serious consequences called for in resolution 1441”. The Council placed itself “in danger </p>
<p>of irrelevance” if it allowed Iraq to “continue to defy its will without responding effectively </p>
<p>and immediately”.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Secretary Powell set out the “real and present dangers” posed by Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction.</p>
<p><b>265. </b> In relation to Iraq’s biological weapons, Secretary Powell stated that “One of the </p>
<p>most worrisome things” was the “existence of mobile production facilities used to make </p>

<p>another country. He added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The existence of transportable facilities moving on trailers had been “confirmed </p>
<p>by a second source, an Iraqi civil engineer in a position to know the details of </p>
<p>the program”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A third source, also in position to know, reported in summer 2002 that Iraq had </p>
<p>manufactured mobile production systems mounted on road trailer units and on </p>
<p>rail cars.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A fourth source, “an Iraqi major, who defected, confirmed that Iraq has mobile </p>
<p>biological research laboratories”.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Secretary Powell provided diagrams of the reported facilities and stated: “We know </p>
<p>that Iraq has at least seven of these mobile biological agent factories.”</p>
<p><b>267. </b> During his presentation Secretary Powell also drew attention “to the fine paper </p>
<p>that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi </p>
<p>deception activities”.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> Secretary Powell was referring to the No.10 document, ‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure of </p>
<p>Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> In his statement to the Security Council, Mr Straw described Secretary Powell’s </p>
<p>presentation as “a most powerful and authoritative case against the Iraqi regime” and </p>
<p>thanked him for “laying bare the deceit practised by the regime of Saddam Hussein, and </p>

<p>“incorrect allegations” in Secretary Powell’s statement and reiterated that Iraq had no </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction. He stated that inspectors had visited the sites identified </p>
<p>in US and UK reports in September and October and “none of the allegations” was true. </p>
<p>He also rebutted statements made by President Bush in his State of the Union address </p>
<p>on 28 January.</p>
<p><b>271. </b> Mr Aldouri reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to pro-active co-operation with the </p>

<p><b>274. </b> On 6 February, Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei met Mr Blair and Mr Straw.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> In the meeting with Mr Blair, Dr Blix registered a number of questions about </p>
<p>Secretary Powell’s briefing to the Security Council the previous day.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> He also said that </p>
<p>intelligence leads had so far produced only one success.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> The record of the meeting stated that Dr Blix:</p>
<p>“… would seek to resolve three relatively minor points related to process: U2 </p>
<p>overflights, interviews, and Iraqi domestic legislation. His approach would be that </p>
<p>the Iraqis had better come up with co-operation on substance … If Saddam decided </p>
<p>to be as helpful on substance as he was on process, fine.”</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Mr Blair doubted that Saddam Hussein would co-operate:</p>
<p>“He would try some trick to divide the Security Council. Retaining his WMD was </p>
<p>essential to his own view of his grip on Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>278. </b> Dr Blix reminded Mr Blair that: “UNSCOM had not reported that the 1999 </p>
<p>left-overs were present in Iraq, just that they were unaccounted for.” UNMOVIC was </p>
<p>more cautious than the UK, but Dr Blix agreed that if Iraq did not have documents it </p>
<p>should be more eager to allow interviews to go ahead. There was a stalemate on the </p>
<p>issue. The inspectors might have to ask for interviews without minders, but Dr Blix was </p>
<p>uneasy about risking people’s lives.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Dr Blix was reported to have informed Mr Blair that his report to the Security </p>
<p>Council on 14 February would probably contain a “balance sheet”. His last assessment </p>
<p>had been “honest but harsh”; the next might have to say that the inspectors “had not </p>
<p>found any WMD”.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> In response to a comment by Mr Blair that containment “was not a long term policy, </p>
<p>and sanctions caused misery to the Iraqi people”, Dr Blix “commented that it would </p>
<p>be paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn out to be very little”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that “if Saddam had no or little WMD he should prove it”.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Rycroft reported that Sir David Manning had:</p>
<p>“… underlined we were confident of our judgements on Iraq’s CBW. If the inspectors </p>
<p>had difficulty finding it, this was because Saddam was not co-operating.”</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Dr Blix felt that Secretary Powell had done </p>
<p>well but was avoiding comment.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> Dr Blix was “pretty cagey” and had “made clear his </p>
<p>job was to be sceptical”. Dr Blix was talking to Iraq about enhanced co-operation and </p>

<p>trying to resolve the issues of anthrax and VX: “On the remnants of old programmes </p>
<p>they should be able to tell us.”</p>
<p><b>283. </b> In his subsequent meeting with Mr Straw, Dr Blix was reported to have said he had </p>
<p>clear indications that anthrax had been weaponised and his personal judgement was </p>
<p>that Iraq did have programmes and “definitely possessed the ability to jump-start BW </p>
<p>programmes”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> The trick would be to find evidence.</p>
<p><b>284. </b> Dr Blix also told Mr Straw that if the Al Samoud missiles were found to be illegal, </p>
<p>they would be destroyed. That could force a real confrontation with the Iraqis who were </p>
<p>not keen to lose billions of dollars of armaments at a time when they were threatened </p>
<p>with military action.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Dr ElBaradei was reported to have told Mr Straw that he would press Iraq hard on </p>
<p>possible uranium imports and interviews. He did not expect much movement from Iraq </p>
<p>and tough messages from the international community could only help the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>286. </b> Mr Straw encouraged Dr ElBaradei to focus on interviews. Dr ElBaradei reported </p>
<p>that the scientists he had interviewed were clearly extremely nervous, but he saw great </p>
<p>difficulties with conducting interviews overseas.</p>
<p><b>287. </b> Dr ElBaradei told Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>“Not all members agreed with the US timing … Iraq was not co-operating. Unless </p>
<p>there were clear signs of an Iraqi change of heart on co-operation, (both process, </p>
<p>including interviews, and substance), UNSCR 1441 would have to be implemented. </p>
<p>Not allowing interviews was a lack of full co-operation … dribbling out concessions </p>
<p>was not full co-operation … His 14 February report would be a clear as possible.”</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>288. </b> In Dr ElBaradei’s view, CBW (chemical and biological weapons) was the key.</p>
<p><b>289. </b> On nuclear issues, the inspectors continued to assess the aluminium tubes. </p>
<p>Reports of the possible import of uranium were: “Much more disturbing … There could </p>
<p>only be one reason for such an import.”</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Dr ElBaradei told Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>“If satisfactory co-operation was not forthcoming, the next best outcome would </p>
<p>be to force Saddam … out … [He] did not oppose more time for inspections. Any </p>
<p>war would risk radicalising the region. It should be UN-controlled. As should the </p>
<p>future Iraq …”</p>

<p><b>291. </b> The No.10 record stated that Mr Blair had made clear to both Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei “the importance of putting Iraqis on the spot with some sharp questions, </p>
<p>to show whether they were co-operating fully or not”. He had “also emphasised the </p>

<p><b>293.  Mr Straw set out a detailed case for confronting the challenge posed by Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>in a speech to the International Institute for Strategic Studies on 11 February.</b></p>
<p><b>294. </b> In a speech made at the International Institute for Strategic Studies on 11 February, </p>
<p>Mr Straw set out “the disturbing outcome of a failure to act decisively to secure Iraq’s </p>
<p>disarmament” and the need, “for the sake of the Iraqi people, long-term stability in the </p>
<p>Middle East, the credibility of the UN and the cause of international law and collective </p>
<p>security” to confront the challenge posed by Iraq.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>295. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“Weapons of mass destruction have been a central pillar of Saddam’s dictatorship </p>
<p>since the 1980s. He has amassed poisons and viruses both to suppress his own </p>
<p>people, and to threaten his neighbours. He has relentlessly pursued his ultimate </p>
<p>ambition, the acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability, in flagrant disregard </p>
<p>of SCRs and Iraq’s obligations as a non-nuclear weapons state under the </p>
<p>Non-Proliferation Treaty. His pursuit of these weapons has lain at the heart of the </p>
<p>UN’s stand-off with Iraq for the past 12 years.”</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Mr Straw argued that the Iraqi threat to Europe and the US was not “overstated”. </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 recognised the “singular menace” from Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction. UNSCOM had had some successes, including overseeing the destruction </p>
<p>of “significant quantities” of weaponry, but when the inspectors left in 1998, it was </p>
<p>“clear that the regime continued to hold vast stocks of deadly weaponry”. The </p>
<p>absence of inspectors since 1998 had “allowed Saddam to accelerate his weapons </p>
<p>programmes”. The report published in autumn 2002 had “demonstrated determined </p>
<p>efforts” to enhance Iraq’s nuclear, biological and chemical capabilities. Dr Blix’s report </p>
<p>to the Security Council in January had “underlined these concerns”. Diplomacy, </p>
<p>intelligence co-operation, reinforced export controls, and interdiction and disruption of </p>
<p>supplies were options being used to “frustrate the ambitions” of other regimes. But “in </p>
<p>respect of Iraq”, those options had been “exhausted … over 12 long years”. It was the </p>
<p>“deadly combination of capability and intent” which made Saddam Hussein “uniquely </p>
<p>dangerous”. Rogue regimes which showed “total disregard for the rule of law, and </p>
<p>share the terrorists’ hatred of our values” were the “most likely source of materials and </p>
<p>know-how”. Given Saddam Hussein’s “longstanding support for terrorist causes”, the </p>

<p><b>The UK contribution to UNMOVIC’s investigations</b></p>
<p><b>297.  Sir Richard Dearlove told No.10 that UK intelligence had been responsible for </b></p>
<p><b>two of UNMOVIC’s finds.</b></p>
<p><b>298. </b> UNMOVIC and the IAEA’s inspections were supported by information provided by </p>
<p>both SIS and the DIS.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>299. </b> The FCO advised No.10 in mid-January that UK intelligence had helped UNMOVIC </p>
<p>to discover illegally imported rocket engines.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>300. </b> The UK also had provided intelligence on the home of the Iraqi scientist who had </p>
<p>concealed documents relating to Iraq’s pre-1991 nuclear programme.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>301. </b> At Sir Richard Dearlove’s request, his Private Secretary sent an update on the </p>
<p>progress of inspections to Sir David Manning on 12 February.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>302. </b> Sir David was told that the strike rate in relation to the UK intelligence-led </p>
<p>inspections was low, but it had been responsible for two out of three UNMOVIC finds </p>
<p>to date, from more than 550 inspections. In addition, “even where there is no WMD, </p>
<p>something else has often been concealed […] Our inspections have revealed the </p>
<p>Iraqi game.”</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Sir Richard’s update also stated that “we needed to keep going in the expectation </p>
<p>that an intelligence-led inspection would lead to a find or a solid refusal of entry”.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Sir David sent the letter to Mr Powell with the comment: “More inspections ahead – </p>
<p>but time getting very short.”</p>

<p><b>305. </b> In a note produced on 12 February, the DIS recorded that most of the site visits </p>

<p>“CW associated rocket warheads at Ukhaider Ammunition depot” the same </p>

<p>“parts” from a “suspected … biological or chemical sub-munition” were found </p>
<p>“at the al-Numan factory” on 2 February.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> The Iraqis realised that some inspections had “been mounted on the basis of </p>
<p>intelligence”, and had “increased even further the measures being taken to prevent </p>
<p>damaging material being uncovered by either UNMOVIC or IAEA”. That included </p>
<p>“ensuring that WMD material only remains at a particular location for an absolute </p>
<p>maximum of 24 hours, and contingency plans to ensure that ‘crowds’ will always be </p>
<p>available to disrupt an inspection that might prove successful”.</p>
<p><b>308. </b> The DIS report concluded:</p>
<p>“UNMOVIC and the IAEA are capable of conducting thorough inspections; </p>

<p>“UNMOVIC and IAEA remain very receptive to UK intelligence. On balance, </p>
<p>however, in the absence of Iraqi cooperation, we assess that the discovery of a </p>
<p>‘smoking gun’ will probably be the result of intelligence information, skill on the part </p>
<p>of the inspectors, an Iraqi mistake, and an element of luck.”</p>

<p> UNMOVIC visited seven of those sites, made a </p>

<p><b>The perspective of the inspectors</b></p>
<p><b>311.  Dr Blix reported to the Security Council on 14 February that UNMOVIC </b></p>
<p><b>had not found any weapons of mass destruction and the items that were not </b></p>
<p><b>accounted for might not exist, but Iraq needed to provide the evidence to answer </b></p>

<p><b>313. </b> The third Ministerial-level meeting of the Security Council to discuss Iraq took </p>
<p>place on 14 February.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Dr Blix told the Security Council that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had begun the process of destroying approximately 50 litres of </p>
<p>mustard gas declared by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples had been </p>
<p>collected. Three-quarters of the samples had already been tested and the </p>
<p>results were consistent with Iraq’s declarations.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Addressing how much, “if any”, was left of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC had not found any so far, “only a small number of empty </p>
<p>chemical munitions, which should have been declared and destroyed”. UNMOVIC had </p>
<p>destroyed the “laboratory quantity” of a “mustard gas precursor” that had been found. </p>
<p>Many proscribed weapons and items had not been accounted for, but:</p>
<p>“One must not jump to the conclusion that they exist. However that possibility is </p>
<p>also not excluded. If they exist they must be presented for destruction. If they do not </p>
<p>exist, credible evidence to that effect should be presented.”</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Addressing Iraq’s ballistic missile programmes, Dr Blix stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Experts had “concluded unanimously” that the two variants of the Al Samoud 2 </p>

<p>Any of the 380 SA-2 engines imported in contravention of resolution 687 and </p>
<p>converted for use in the Al Samoud missile system were also proscribed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The casting chambers for missile motors which had been destroyed by </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Clarifications were needed before decisions could be made on the capabilities </p>
<p>of the Al Fatah missile and the engine test stand at al-Rafah.</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Addressing the role of intelligence, Dr Blix stated that in the closed society of Iraq, </p>
<p>and given the history of inspections, “other sources of information, such as defectors </p>
<p>and government intelligence agencies” were “required to aid the inspection process”. </p>
<p>International organisations then needed to analyse such information critically.</p>
<p><b>318. </b> Dr Blix added that intelligence had been useful for UNMOVIC, and in one case had </p>
<p>led to the discovery of documents relating to laser enrichment of uranium:</p>
<p>“In other cases, intelligence has led to sites where no proscribed items were </p>
<p>found. Even in such cases, however, inspection of these sites were useful in </p>
<p>proving the absence of such items and in some cases the presence of other </p>
<p>items – conventional munitions. It shows that conventional arms are being moved </p>
<p>around the country and their presence is not necessarily related to weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction.”</p>
<p><b>319. </b> Dr Blix also pointed out that the evidence that Iraq had prepared for inspections </p>
<p>by cleaning up sites and removing evidence, presented to the Security Council by </p>
<p>Secretary Powell on 5 February, could have a different interpretation.</p>
<p><b>320.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had found no evidence of ongoing </b></p>
<p><b>prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related activities in Iraq, although a number of </b></p>
<p><b>issues were still under investigation.</b></p>
<p><b>321. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that Iraq had provided documentation relating to the </p>
<p>reported attempt to import uranium, the attempted procurement of aluminium tubes, </p>
<p>the procurement of magnets and magnet production capability, and the use of HMX. </p>
<p>The IAEA:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was pursuing the acquisition of uranium;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>examining issues in relation to aluminium tubes and magnets; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>might be unable to reach a final conclusion on HMX: “While we have no </p>
<p>indication that this material was used for any application other than declared by </p>
<p>Iraq, we have no technical method of verifying … the declared use …”</p>
<p><b>322. </b> In relation to “documents found on 16 January in the private residence of an Iraqi </p>
<p>scientist”, the IAEA had “completed a more detailed review”. The documents related </p>
<p>“predominantly to lasers, including the use of laser technology to enrich uranium”. </p>
<p>“Nothing” in the documents altered “the conclusions previously drawn by the IAEA” </p>
<p>about the extent of Iraq’s laser enrichment programme.</p>

<p>352</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Iraq had also provided documentation about questions and concerns which </p>
<p>had remained since 1998 about weapons and centrifuge design, but the documents </p>
<p>contained “no new information”. Dr ElBaradei hoped that “the new Iraqi commissions </p>
<p>… will be able to discover documents and other evidence that could assist in clarifying </p>
<p>remaining questions and concerns”.</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Dr ElBaradei had “reported on numerous occasions” that the IAEA had:</p>
<p>“… by December 1998 … concluded that it had neutralised Iraq’s past nuclear </p>
<p>programme and that therefore no unresolved disarmament issues remained … </p>
<p>Hence, our focus since the resumption of inspections … has been verifying whether </p>
<p>Iraq revived its nuclear programme in the intervening years.</p>
<p>“We have to date found no evidence of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related </p>
<p>activities in Iraq. However … a number of issues are still under investigation … we </p>
<p>intend to make full use of the authority granted to us … to build as much capacity </p>
<p>into the inspection process as necessary.</p>
<p>“In that context, I would underline the importance of information that States may </p>
<p>be able to provide to help us in assessing the accuracy and completeness of </p>
<p>information provided by Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>325. </b> Mr Straw thanked Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei for “their great efforts in the face </p>
<p>of what I think is still very clear: Iraq’s failure, fully and actively to comply with </p>
<p>resolution 1441”.</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Mr Straw stated that the issue, which “could not be graver”, was “about the </p>
<p>authority of the United Nations and about the responsibility of the Security Council for </p>
<p>international peace and security”. All the members of the Council knew that Iraq had </p>
<p>“had these weapons [of mass destruction and long-range missiles]”; Iraq had been </p>
<p>“found guilty” in 1991. The issue was whether Iraq was “actively co-operating to get rid </p>
<p>of them”.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Mr Straw stated that Iraq had lied, had concealed weapons and played games. </p>
<p>As Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had:</p>
<p>“… spelled out in their report of 27 January, Iraq has failed to account for thousands </p>
<p>of tons of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals, of shells and bombs for </p>
<p>anthrax, for mustard gas, for VX nerve agent. They have failed to make a full and </p>
<p>complete disclosure as required of them … They have failed to co-operate fully </p>
<p>and actively on substance, as well as on process with the inspectors, and failed </p>
<p>substantively to meet the obligations imposed on them.”</p>
<p><b>328.  Iraq continued to state that it did not possess weapons of mass destruction.</b></p>
<p><b>329. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had agreed to act on resolution 1441 and had “provided </p>
<p>everything that might fall within the concept of pro-active Iraqi co-operation”. The </p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>documents provided with the Iraqi declaration, of 7 December 2002, required “in-depth </p>
<p>study” because they contained “updated relevant information responding to many </p>
<p>questions”. Iraq had “the right to wonder whether the declaration had been studied with </p>
<p>due diligence and thoroughness”. Iraq had “begun to co-operate pro-actively”, and many </p>
<p>speakers had called for that but there was a question about what that would mean.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Mr Aldouri pointed out that there was an “Arabic proverb that an empty hand </p>
<p>has nothing to give. You cannot give what you do not have. If we do not possess such </p>
<p>weapons, how can we disarm ourselves? How can such weapons be dismantled if they </p>
<p>do not exist?”</p>
<p><b>331. </b> Iraq agreed that the “best way to resolve these issues is through continuing pro-</p>
<p>active co-operation with the inspectors”. Mr Aldouri stressed that Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… chosen the path of peace. We have opted for solutions that would satisfy the </p>
<p>international community. We are prepared to provide all means to assist in making </p>
<p>clear the true picture …</p>
<p>“We hope the Security Council will heed the desire of the vast majority of States </p>
<p>Members of the United Nations and allow the inspectors to fulfil their role …”</p>
<p><b>332.  In the subsequent private discussion of the Council, Mr Straw stated that </b></p>
<p><b>there was “overwhelming evidence that Iraq had had WMD”; if there was no </b></p>
<p><b>evidence it had been destroyed, we had to work on the basis that it existed.</b></p>
<p><b>333. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that in response to points raised during the private </p>
<p>session of the Council, Mr Straw had stated that the reason the Council had said Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD posed a threat was because there was “overwhelming evidence that it had had </p>
<p>the material. If we had no evidence it had been destroyed, we had to work on the basis </p>
<p>that it existed and that there was a danger to the region and to our national security.”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Oral cross-examination was the best way to get the truth. Interviewees were not saying </p>
<p>anything and were insisting on tape recorders because they wanted to stay alive: “Until </p>
<p>Iraq allowed interviews outside Iraq and in free conditions, we would be naive to think </p>
<p>that they were co-operating.”</p>
<p><b>334.  Dr Blix told Mr Blair on 20 February that the intelligence he had received was </b></p>
<p><b>“not all that compelling”; perhaps there was not much WMD in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr Blair telephoned Dr Blix on 20 February.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>336. </b> In the course of a discussion lasting 45 minutes about the possibility of devising </p>

<p>to think that Iraq was concealing some WMD, he needed evidence to put to the Security </p>

<p><b>337. </b> Dr Blix also commented that “perhaps there was not much WMD in Iraq after all”; </p>
<p>and that the French and Germans were “unsure” about mobile BW production facilities: </p>
<p>“It would be paradoxical and absurd if 250,000 men were to invade Iraq and find </p>

<p><b>338. </b> Mr Blair responded that “our intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted </p>

<p>128</p>
<p> Given the resources Saddam Hussein had </p>

<p><b>354. </b> Mr Scarlett also provided briefings for Mr Donald Anderson and Mr Bruce George, </p>
<p>respectively the Chairmen of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs and Defence </p>
<p>Committees.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett reported that Mr Anderson had found the imagery used by </p>
<p>Secretary Powell “especially ‘compelling’”.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> The report of the briefing on 6 February for Mr George stated that the text had </p>
<p>been agreed with the intelligence Agencies.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> Mr George had shown most interest in </p>
<p>Iraq’s policy of concealment and had also asked about its links with Al Qaida. Mr Scarlett </p>
<p>also reported that Mr George was: “… clear that the evidence on WMD holdings and </p>
<p>concealment was ‘sufficiently compelling’ to justify ‘military operations’.”</p>
<p><b>356. </b> The brief prepared for the Cabinet members drew on the document produced for </p>
<p>briefing the Chairmen of the Select Committees.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>357. </b> The brief for Cabinet members provided substantial additional material on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s programmes before the 1990-1991 Gulf Conflict;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the current assessment of Iraq’s capabilities – including its missile capabilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>difficulties with securing interviews;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>scenarios for CBW use;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the risk of terrorism in the event of military action against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Drawing on the detailed information published in the 24 September dossier, the </p>
<p>brief stated that before the 1990-1991 Gulf Conflict, Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “declared to the UN the production of:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>2,850 tonnes of mustard gas, 210 tonnes of tabun, 795 tonnes of sarin and </p>
<p>cyclosarin, and 3.9 tonnes of VX</p>

<p>up to 650km”.</p>
<p><b>359. </b> In addition:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM and the IAEA had “destroyed much of the pre-1991 programmes”.</p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>360. </b> The brief stated that the Government assessment published on 24 September </p>
<p>(the dossier), judged that Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Had “a usable chemical and biological capability, which included production in </p>
<p>2002 of chemical and biological agents, and military plans to use them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Continued “to work on developing nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Possessed “up to 20 650km range” Al Hussein missiles”, and was “developing </p>
<p>longer-range ballistic missiles, and is extending the ranges of Al Samoud and </p>
<p>Ababil-100 systems beyond the permitted range of 150km”.</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Addressing the current assessment of Iraq’s capabilities, the brief stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “Very little significant new intelligence on [Iraq’s] WMD capabilities” </p>
<p>since September 2002, “although continue to see planning for its use”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The focus on UN inspections “may have limited activity in some areas such as </p>
<p>missile development”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “possibility of ongoing production” of CBW agents could not be ruled out </p>
<p>because it was “easily concealed especially in the case of BW agents using </p>
<p>transportable biological production facilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence indicated that Iraq had “produced both chemical and biological </p>
<p>agents since 1998 to add to stocks since the [1991] Gulf War. As late as </p>
<p>September 2002 Iraq was carrying out illegitimate work on anthrax that could be </p>
<p>used as part of a weapons programme.”</p>
<p><b>362. </b> The brief recognised that not all the systems which were capable of delivering </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons would have such munitions or a CBW delivery role. </p>
<p>Intelligence suggested that Iraq might “not be able to deliver CBW efficiently” using </p>
<p>Al Samoud and Ababil-100 missiles.</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Addressing Iraq’s declaration in response to resolution 1441, the brief rehearsed </p>
<p>the outstanding issues identified by UNSCOM in 1999 and added references to Iraq’s:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>understatement in the declaration of the quantity of Volga engines which had </p>
<p>been procured;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of any reference to the engine test stand at al-Rafah; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“misrepresentation of the status and performance of the L-29 programme”.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Addressing Iraq’s concealment and deception activities, the briefing for the </p>
<p>Cabinet stated that “Iraq was confident in its ability to prevent inspectors finding </p>
<p>any ‘smoking gun’”.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> The briefing for Mr Anderson and Mr George had stated that “Iraq was confident </p>
<p>that inspections would not find” any “smoking gun”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>366. </b> The brief did not refer to the fact that although the inspectors had found material </p>
<p>that had been procured illicitly, some of it related to permitted programmes including </p>
<p>missiles with ranges less than 150km.</p>
<p><b>367.  Mr Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary from May 1997 to June 2001 and then </b></p>
<p><b>Leader of the House of Commons, recorded that he had concluded Iraq did not </b></p>
<p><b>have weapons of mass destruction in the sense of weapons that could be used </b></p>
<p><b>against large-scale civilian targets.</b></p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Scarlett reported that Mr Cook had asked a number of questions during his </p>
<p>briefing on 20 February, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “threat posed by battlefield CBW as opposed to missiles capable of hitting </p>
<p>civilian targets (e.g. cities) in foreign countries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “weaponisation capabilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Had containment worked?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Had Iraq’s WMD programmes had developed since 1998?”</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Scarlett added that he had:</p>
<p>“… made clear that Iraq had a range of battlefield systems capable of delivering </p>
<p>CBW. We assessed that Saddam was ready to use them, including against his </p>
<p>civilian population. Iraq might not have succeeded in developing CBW capable </p>
<p>warheads for the 150km ‘permitted’ missiles. We assessed that Iraq could deliver </p>
<p>CBW with the 650km missiles it retained; if only one of these hit home in favourable </p>
<p>conditions on an Israeli city (I might also have mentioned Kuwait), civilian casualties </p>
<p>would be large. I also made clear that Iraq’s programmes had not stood still since </p>
<p>1998 and had developed in all areas except perhaps the nuclear, where I reminded </p>
<p>him of what was in the public assessment.”</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Cook wrote that the briefing from Mr Scarlett had lasted an hour, and “was </p>
<p>impressive in its integrity and shorn of the political slant with which No.10 encumbers </p>
<p>any intelligence assessment”.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> Mr Cook had concluded, “Saddam probably does not </p>
<p>have weapons of mass destruction in the sense of weapons that could be used against </p>
<p>large-scale civilian targets”.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Asked if Mr Cook had challenged the briefing, Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… he questioned me very closely on the assessment … He asked for more detail </p>
<p>than other Ministers did … he was an especially experienced Minister when it came </p>
<p>to the use of intelligence. He didn’t dispute what I was saying … Where he … took a </p>
<p>different view was on how he interpreted it …”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>379. </b> The JIC Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The relative weakness of Iraqi forces in the South and the fact that those forces will </p>
<p>face the brunt of a Coalition attack mean <b>southern Iraq is the most likely area for </b></p>
<p><b>the first use of CBW against both Coalition Forces and the local population</b>.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>380. </b> The Assessment added that one report from August 2002 had indicated:</p>
<p>“… Iraqi plans to use CBW in southern Iraq to cause mass casualties among the </p>
<p>Shia in the event of a US-led attack. The regime would seek to pin the blame for the </p>
<p>resulting high-level of casualties on the Coalition.”</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Responding to a series of questions from Mr Blair (see Section 6.2), the MOD </p>
<p>advised on 24 February that Iraq retained “the capability (through a variety of means) </p>
<p>pre-emptively to deliver CBW against Coalition Forces in Kuwait. The question is one of </p>
<p>intent.”</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> There was “no intelligence” to indicate that the regime was “currently planning </p>
<p>a pre-emptive strike”. In the MOD view that was “highly unlikely whilst Saddam believes </p>
<p>war can be averted”. If he was convinced that war was “inevitable and imminent” that </p>
<p>“might make a pre-emptive move more attractive” but it was “more likely that Saddam </p>
<p>would deploy CBW after the onset of the campaign”.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> In its Assessment, ‘Iraq: Prospects in the North’, of how Iraq would respond in </p>
<p>northern Iraq to a coalition attack, issued on 26 February, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi regime would be willing to use CBW against the Coalition and </p>

<p>148</p>
<p><b>385. </b> The JIC assessed that it was “likely that, even if it had not done so already, the </p>
<p>regime would use CBW in the defence of Baghdad if it could”. That “would depend on </p>
<p>the survival of leadership command and control, and of some delivery means, such as </p>
<p>artillery”. Intelligence indicated that the Special Republican Guard and Special Security </p>
<p>Organisation retained “control over CBW munitions” and that the regime had “been </p>
<p>distributing protective CBW clothing and medical supplies for treating exposure to nerve </p>
<p>agents to units around Baghdad”.</p>

<p><b>Presentation of the UK position</b></p>
<p><b>386. </b> The UK’s intensive lobbying to secure support in the Security Council for a second </p>
<p>resolution on Iraq is described in Sections 3.7 and 3.8. It included a series of visits to the </p>
<p>capitals of many members of the Council.</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Mr Miller informed Sir David Manning that a script was being prepared which </p>
<p>would:</p>
<p>“… briefly summarise evidence and judgements on Saddam’s WMD; describe the </p>
<p>effect of some of the agents; set out the Iraqi response to UNSCR 1441, including </p>
<p>the flaws in the 7 December declaration; and cover what we know of concealment, </p>
<p>intimidation of witnesses and other aspects of non-co-operation. It will also provide </p>
<p>supporting material on Saddam’s regime and – briefly – on links with terrorism. </p>
<p>We will update the pack as new material becomes available.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>388. </b> On 26 February, Mr Miller provided a brief for Sir Jeremy Greenstock to use in </p>
<p>Security Council discussions, setting out the UK assessment of Iraq’s WMD and its </p>
<p>response to resolution 1441.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>389. </b> The brief provided a very short summary of the judgements in the September </p>
<p>dossier, including that there had been recent production of chemical and biological </p>
<p>agents; that judgements on concealment had been borne out by events; that the dossier </p>
<p>had highlighted rocket motor casting chambers which UNMOVIC had now proscribed; </p>
<p>and that UNMOVIC had agreed that the al-Rafah engine test stand had “a capability far </p>
<p>in excess of what is needed for permitted missile systems”. The brief also stated that </p>
<p>work on anthrax “carried on late into 2002”.</p>
<p><b>390. </b> In relation to Iraq’s response to resolution 1441, the brief stated:</p>
<p>“Saddam’s behaviour since the middle of last year has been very instructive. </p>
<p>We have been watching closely as the story unfolds. What follows is not </p>
<p>supposition. It is what we know.”</p>
<p><b>391. </b> The points made in the briefing included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In April 2002, Qusay Hussein had issued instructions for the concealment of </p>
<p>chemical warfare agents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In August 2002, “individual scientists and officials were made personally </p>
<p>responsible for the items on which they were working, holding them in their </p>
<p>homes and the homes of relatives and friends”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By 20 November, all production work on banned weapons at Military </p>
<p>Industrialisation Commission sites had been stopped and evidence of prohibited </p>
<p>activity was being cleaned up.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Proscribed materials were concealed “at innocuous sites such as hospitals”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Some materials, such as missiles, have been and remain on trucks that are </p>
<p>continually on the move.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“By the end of December Saddam was confident that this concealment strategy </p>
<p>would work at least until the spring when military options might become more </p>
<p>difficult – the aim was to buy time.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following the discovery of nuclear-related documentation at a scientist’s </p>
<p>home on 16 January 2003, orders were given to remove hidden items from </p>
<p>scientists’ homes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When inspectors arrived at a hospital at al-Kut in search of hidden weapons in </p>
<p>January, they were “confronted by an orchestrated crowd, whose aim was to </p>
<p>prevent a full inspection of the area”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Many proscribed materials were “now being moved daily”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continued to ensure, mainly through a policy of intimidation and monitoring, </p>
<p>that the inspectors were not able to interview who they wanted.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> The brief concluded:</p>
<p>“Iraq will continue ostensible co-operation … and seek support in the UNSC to avert </p>
<p>a war while continuing an active policy of concealment …</p>
<p>“And as part of that, and despite current protestations, we know that Saddam is </p>
<p>likely to agree to the destruction of all Al Samoud 2 missiles …”</p>
<p><b>393. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had used the points provided by the Assessments Staff </p>
<p>during “informal consultations” on 27 February, including Iraq’s:</p>
<p>“… capacity to produce chemical and biological weapons; its delivery mechanisms; </p>
<p>the efforts the regime had taken to conceal WMD; the fact that the regime had </p>
<p>considered whether to declare some weapons but concluded it was too risky; plans </p>
<p>to obstruct … [the inspectors] if they got too close; and the intimidation to prevent </p>
<p>private interviews which Iraq saw as the weak link that could expose their WMD.”</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>394. </b> In addition, Sir Jeremy stated that “UNMOVIC had been tagging proscribed </p>
<p>equipment that had been repaired by the Iraqis”.</p>
<p><b>395.  In meetings with President Vicente Fox, the Mexican President, and President </b></p>
<p><b>Ricardo Lagos, the Chilean President, Mr Scarlett emphasised his confidence </b></p>

<p><b>396. </b> Sir David Manning and Mr Scarlett went to Mexico and Chile on 1 and 2 March<b> </b></p>
<p>to explain the UK’s position to President Fox and President Lagos, and to seek their </p>
<p>support for the UK’s proposals for the Security Council.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>397. </b> Mr Scarlett was reported to have told President Fox that the UK had developed:</p>
<p>“… a range of sources, some inside Iraq, that had proven reliability. We had built up </p>
<p>a consistent picture in which we had confidence. Our allies, including Europeans, </p>
<p>had no serious differences of substance with us …</p>
<p>“While we believed that UNSCOM had been able to disarticulate Iraq’s nuclear </p>
<p>programme it had not been able to account for a wide range of chemical and </p>
<p>biological materials – we were particularly worried about VX and anthrax. Even </p>
<p>conservative estimates of material Iraq still held indicated the capacity to assemble </p>
<p>thousands of WMD artillery shells. Since 1998 Iraq had continued to produce </p>
<p>new agents, develop its missile capability and, with less success, reconstitute its </p>
<p>nuclear programme.</p>
<p>“In 2002 a conscious decision was taken to deny possession of WMD to frustrate </p>
<p>a renewed and strengthened inspection programme. We had watched a policy of </p>
<p>concealment and intimidation develop. Evidence had been dispersed, factories </p>
<p>cleaned up and scientists cowed.</p>
<p>“… Some UNMOVIC successes in January resulted in further efforts to hide </p>
<p>evidence and deceive inspectors. Continued small successes forced Iraq to </p>
<p>move to a policy of slow, small concessions to give the impression of movement </p>
<p>(eg on missiles). For the UK, the litmus test would be interviews with scientists. </p>
<p>Iraq realised their knowledge was their Achilles heel, hence the intimidation.”</p>
<p><b>398. </b> In the subsequent meeting with President Lagos, Mr Scarlett was reported to </p>
<p>have described the intelligence assessment and, in response to a specific question, </p>
<p>informed President Lagos that “although there were some differences of detail e.g. over </p>
<p>the degree to which Saddam could weaponise, the French assessment was similar” to </p>
<p>the UK’s.</p>

<p>364</p>
<p>information from the UK that had “still not been followed up”.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> The IAEA had apparently </p>
<p>concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no significant evidence that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium </p>
<p>from Niger”. The documents the IAEA had seen “that formed the basis of such </p>
<p>an allegation appeared to be forgeries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Aluminium tubes, “although imported illegally”, were not connected with a </p>
<p>gas centrifuge programme. Iraq had “satisfactorily explained the use of the </p>
<p>tubes, and the reasons for their various fine tolerances”. The Iraqis “were no </p>
<p>longer (if ever) in a position to manufacture a gas centrifuge, especially without </p>
<p>foreign assistance”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence to link the magnets with a covert nuclear programme”; </p>
<p>the IAEA had found the part in the guidance system of a missile.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had evidence that a significant amount of the “missing 32 tonnes of </p>
<p>HMX (a high explosive used to help trigger nuclear fission)”, had been used for </p>
<p>commercial purposes, “as the Iraqis had claimed”.</p>
<p><b>UK assessments of Iraq’s intentions</b></p>
<p><b>400.  In evidence to the FAC on 4 March, Mr Straw emphasised Iraq’s attempts to </b></p>
<p><b>conceal its capabilities and deceive the inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Straw gave evidence to the FAC on 4 March (see Section 3.7).</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>402. </b> In his opening statement, Mr Straw said that it was assessed that Iraq had the </p>
<p>capability to produce a range of chemical and biological agents, and:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi regime has put up an elaborate screen of concealment based on </p>
<p>intimidation and deception to cover this capability … [W]e know that sensitive </p>
<p>materials and documents have been hidden in the homes of employees and </p>
<p>hidden too in hospitals, farms and other sites. Intelligence also suggests that </p>
<p>WMD-related items may have been buried and others were being kept on the move </p>
<p>every 12 hours using trucks and trains. Throughout the period of inspection Iraq’s </p>
<p>security and intelligence agencies have been monitoring UNMOVIC and the IAEA </p>
<p>and plans are available to obstruct them if they come close to WMD itself … Iraq </p>
<p>is particularly concerned about … interviews of scientists and others because if </p>
<p>they were carried out as mandated by [resolution] 1441 they would unquestionably </p>
<p>expose the regime’s deception and its stockpile of weapons … In early December </p>
<p>we know that Saddam Hussein issued instructions that scientists were to be </p>
<p>threatened with serious consequences for themselves and their families if they </p>
<p>revealed any sensitive information to UNMOVIC. They were ordered not to agree </p>
<p>to any interviews taking place outside Iraq … The potential witnesses have been </p>

<p>their homes and places of work and detained to prevent them from being interviewed.”</p>
<p><b>403.  An assessment of Iraq’s intentions on 6 March concluded that the strategy </b></p>
<p><b>was to play for time, and that Iraq thought the strategy was working.</b></p>
<p><b>404.  The Assessments Staff was “confident” that Saddam Hussein’s aim would be </b></p>
<p><b>the eventual re-creation of his WMD capability.</b></p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Miller provided an assessment of “Saddam’s possible next moves” for </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 6 March.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> The document was also sent to officials in the FCO, </p>
<p>the MOD and the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Mr Miller described Saddam Hussein’s strategy as “to play for time, gradually </p>
<p>releasing limited information on Iraq’s terms or when there is no other option”. Iraq </p>
<p>thought its strategy was working. Mr Miller stated: “Even if he [Saddam Hussein] does </p>
<p>opt for a declaration of WMD, we are confident that his aim would be the eventual </p>
<p>recreation of his capability.”</p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Miller advised that the decision to destroy the Al Samoud 2 missile was </p>
<p>“indicative of Saddam’s strategy: a drawn out debate with UNMOVIC over legality; an </p>
<p>offer to form a ‘technical committee’ to review the weapon; compliance; and an attempt </p>
<p>to portray compliance as a major concession”. Mr Miller predicted that Iraq would “draw </p>
<p>out the destruction process”, which might take “as long as two months to complete”.</p>
<p><b>408. </b> Mr Miller concluded:</p>
<p>“In short, we have seen no indication that there will be a change in Iraq’s strategy … </p>
<p>Iraq will continue to put the onus on the inspectors to set out what they want rather </p>
<p>than pro-actively provide information … Saddam will be prepared to offer further </p>
<p>concessions – or at least to say he is ready to. But based on current behaviour any </p>
<p>information will be incomplete, will be difficult to interpret and will not represent a </p>
<p>full declaration of Iraq’s capability. On overseas interviews and any proposal for </p>
<p>a substantial UN military force, agreement is likely only in the face of imminent </p>
<p>military action.”</p>
<p><b>Security Council, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>409.  In his report to the Security Council on 7 March, Dr Blix stated that there had </b></p>
<p><b>been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq since the end of January, but they </b></p>
<p><b>could not be said to constitute immediate co-operation. Nor did they necessarily </b></p>
<p><b>cover all areas of relevance; but they were nevertheless welcome.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Introducing UNMOVIC’s 12th quarterly report of activity to 28 February 2003, </p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that, when the quarterly report had been finalised, there had still been </p>
<p>“relatively little tangible progress to note” and the report had been “cautious”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 7 March, there had been a number of relevant events on which he would bring the </p>
<p>Council up to date</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Dr Blix stated that inspections had begun on 27 November 2002, and “faced </p>
<p>relatively few difficulties”. While there were “frictions”, “at this juncture”, UNMOVIC was </p>
<p>“able to perform professional no-notice inspections all over Iraq and to increase aerial </p>
<p>surveillance” and its capabilities were being increased.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Iraq seemed “to have encouraged interviewees not to request the presence of Iraq </p>
<p>officials … or the taping of interviews” but “conditions ensuring the absence of undue </p>
<p>influence were difficult to attain inside Iraq. Interviews outside Iraq might provide such </p>
<p>assurance. It is our intention to request such interviews shortly.” Thirty-eight individuals </p>
<p>had been asked for interviews and 10 had accepted UNMOVIC’s terms, seven during </p>
<p>the last week.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Iraq had denied the existence of mobile production units for biological weapons </p>
<p>and that proscribed activities were being conducted underground. Inspections had taken </p>
<p>place at declared and undeclared sites but no evidence of proscribed activities had “so </p>
<p>far been found”. Iraq was “expected to assist in the development of credible ways to </p>
<p>conduct random checks of ground transportation”.</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Inspectors were examining Iraq’s programmes for RPVs and data was being </p>
<p>collected to assess the range and other capabilities of the models found.</p>
<p><b>416. </b> In relation to “reports of proscribed activity conducted underground”, which Iraq </p>
<p>had denied, Dr Blix stated that “no facilities for chemical or biological production or </p>
<p>storage have been found so far”. Iraq should provide information on any underground </p>
<p>facilities that were suitable for the production or storage of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Dr Blix stressed the importance of Iraq’s acceptance of the destruction of </p>
<p>Al Samoud 2 missiles and associated items, which constituted a “substantial measure </p>
<p>of disarmament … the first since the middle 1990s”.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Other points covered by Dr Blix included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC was reviewing the legality of the Al Fatah missile.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Papers on anthrax, VX and missiles had recently been provided. Many re-stated </p>
<p>what Iraq had already declared, but some required further study and discussion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “a significant Iraqi effort under way to clarify a major source of </p>
<p>uncertainty” about the “quantities of biological and chemical weapons” that had </p>
<p>been “unilaterally destroyed in 1991”, by excavating a site that was formerly </p>

<p>“deemed too dangerous”. Eight intact bombs had been unearthed, two of which </p>
<p>had a “liquid fill”. That “should be followed by a serious and credible effort to </p>
<p>determine” how many R-400 bombs had been produced.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had informed UNMOVIC that there would be further legislation on </p>
<p>prohibiting work on weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><b>419.  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear activities since the inspectors left in December 1998 and the recently </b></p>
<p><b>increased level of Iraqi co-operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council with an assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future.</b></p>
<p><b>420. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA was focused on the “central question” </p>
<p>of “whether Iraq has revived, or attempted to revive, its defunct nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme over the last four years”.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> Dr ElBaradei noted that:</p>
<p>“… in the past three weeks, possibly as a result of ever-increasing pressure by the </p>
<p>international community, Iraq has been forthcoming in its co-operation, particularly </p>
<p>with regard to the conduct of private interviews and in making available evidence </p>
<p>that could contribute to the resolution of matters of IAEA concern.”</p>
<p><b>421. </b> That “should enable” the IAEA “in the very near future to provide the Security </p>
<p>Council with an objective and thorough assessment of Iraq’s nuclear-related </p>
<p>capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>422. </b> Iraq’s industrial capacity had deteriorated sharply, including through the departure </p>
<p>of foreign support present in the 1980s and large numbers of skilled Iraqi personnel in </p>
<p>the preceding decade.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Interviews were continuing, including two “private interviews in the last 10 days”. </p>
<p>Interviews outside Iraq might be the best way to ensure that interviews were “free”, and </p>
<p>the IAEA intended to request such interviews “shortly”.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> The primary technical focus of the IAEA in the field had been on the possible </p>
<p>resumption of Iraq’s efforts to enrich uranium. In relation to the three key issues, </p>
<p>the IAEA had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Failed to uncover any evidence that Iraq’s attempts to purchase high strength </p>
<p>aluminium tubes was for “any project other than … rockets”. The documents </p>
<p>provided and interviews had allowed the IAEA “to develop a coherent picture of </p>
<p>attempted purchases and intended usage”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Verified that none of the magnets Iraq had declared could be used directly </p>
<p>for the magnetic bearings in centrifuges. It was likely that Iraq possessed the </p>
<p>expertise to manufacture such magnets and the IAEA would continue to monitor </p>
<p>and inspect equipment and materials.</p>

<p>368</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Stated that documents relating to the reports of possible acquisition of uranium </p>
<p>from Niger were not authentic, but the IAEA would continue to follow up any </p>
<p>additional evidence.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Dr ElBaradei concluded that there was no indication:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“of resumed nuclear activities” in buildings identified as new or reconstructed </p>
<p>since 1998;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“of nuclear-related prohibited activities at any inspected sites”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that Iraq has attempted to import uranium since 1990”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that Iraq has attempted to import aluminium tubes for use in centrifuge </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“to date that Iraq imported magnets to use in a centrifuge enrichment </p>
<p>programme”.</p>
<p><b>426. </b> Dr ElBaradei stated that Iraq’s procurement efforts, including those in relation to </p>
<p>magnets and aluminium tubes, had been conducted “in contravention of the sanctions </p>
<p>controls” imposed by the Security Council. The IAEA would continue to scrutinise and </p>
<p>investigate those issues and hoped “to continue to receive from States actionable </p>
<p>information relevant to our mandate”.</p>
<p><b>427.  Mr Aldouri emphasised that Iraq had taken the strategic decision to disarm </b></p>
<p><b>in 1991.</b></p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Aldouri underlined Iraq’s “pledge to continue pro-active co-operation” with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA. He also stated that Iraq had taken “the strategic decision to rid </p>
<p>itself of weapons of mass destruction” in 1991. He added:</p>
<p>“All weapons that have been proscribed fall into one of two categories: they have </p>
<p>been either declared or unilaterally destroyed by Iraq. All the declarations that Iraq </p>
<p>has been repeatedly asked to present concerned the details and verification of that </p>
<p>unilateral destruction and nothing … else. It is for the accusers to prove otherwise, if </p>
<p>they possess any evidence.”</p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had no VX programme.</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that the issues of concern identified by the US and UK were “an </p>
<p>attempt to confuse the issue” and mask their real agenda to take over Iraq’s oil and the </p>
<p>political and economic domination of the region. Iraq continued to hope for justice from </p>

<p><b>431.  In subsequent informal consultations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK was sure Iraq had WMD, but they could not be located because they had been </b></p>
<p><b>hidden by Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>432. </b> The Council meeting was followed by “a long session of informal consultations”.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>433. </b> The points made by Sir Jeremy Greenstock included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no real evidence of non-compliance on the nuclear weapons file”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “key question” was whether Iraq had WMD: “The UK was sure they did. </p>
<p>But the WMD could not be located because Iraq had hidden them, and they </p>
<p>would not be found without unconditional and immediate Iraqi co-operation.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and the UK “had invested time and money in finding out the truth. </p>
<p>So we knew that WMD were being moved every 12 hours; that mobile weapons </p>
<p>facilities existed; and that documents and materials were being moved around.”</p>
<p><b>434. </b> Dr Blix was reported to have stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi co-operation “sometimes seemed grudging”, but “only if UNMOVIC </p>
<p>found that Iraq was concealing things could one say that there was a real lack </p>
<p>of co-operation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With the Al Samoud missiles and UAVs, Iraq was “trying to push to the </p>
<p>boundaries of what was permissible”. On the former, Iraq had arguably </p>
<p>“trespassed over the border”; the resolution did not prohibit UAVs, but they were </p>
<p>“on the border of what was allowed”. UNMOVIC was “still investigating”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “seemed to be trying to find ways of assisting UNMOVIC” on mobile </p>
<p>BW facilities.</p>

<p><b>438. </b> The points made by Mr Aldouri, who spoke at the beginning and end of the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The US and the UK had propagated “falsehoods and untrue allegations” </p>
<p>about “Iraq’s compliance and implementation of the relevant Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ninety-five percent of the disarmament tasks had been completed between 1991 </p>
<p>and 1994.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had recently unilaterally declared its missile programme and was destroying </p>
<p>the Al Samoud 2 missiles which UNMOVIC had deemed to be proscribed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>None of the “allegations” presented to the Council by Secretary Powell on </p>
<p>5 February had “proved to be true”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The most recent “intelligence report produced by the UK [the No.10 dossier]”, </p>
<p>contained previously published information.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recent allegations about RPVs were unfounded. They were small experimental </p>
<p>aircraft which had been examined by the inspectors.</p>

<p>“taken the strategic decision” to rid itself of weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p><b>440.  In response to his requests, Mr Blair was given several notes on 15 and </b></p>
<p><b>16 March about Iraq’s WMD and the activities of the inspectors since 1991.</b></p>
<p><b>441.  They comprised a series of statements setting out past problems without </b></p>
<p><b>any caveats about how they should be interpreted in relation to Iraq’s current </b></p>

<p><b>442. </b> A note on the subjects covered by UNMOVIC’s “clusters” report listed the </p>
<p>unresolved issues, commenting: <b>“There are therefore questions to which UNMOVIC </b></p>

<p>– </p>

<p>incorporate those facts. There is no genuine effort at openness or honesty.</p>
<p>“The Blix ‘clusters’ paper underlines the inspectors’ very limited information on the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>372</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Mr Cook stated that Iraq’s military strength was now less than half its size in 1991; </p>
<p>and, “Ironically”, it was “only because Iraq’s military forces” were “so weak that we can </p>
<p>even contemplate its invasion”. He questioned the threat posed by Iraq:</p>
<p>“Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood </p>
<p>sense of the term – namely a credible device capable of being delivered against </p>
<p>a strategic city target. It probably … has biological toxins and battlefield chemical </p>
<p>munitions, but it has had them since the 1980s when US companies sold Saddam </p>
<p>anthrax agents and the then British government approved chemical and munitions </p>
<p>factories. Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a </p>
<p>military capacity that has been there for twenty years, and which we helped to </p>
<p>create? Why is it necessary to resort to war this week, while Saddam’s ambition to </p>
<p>complete his weapons programme is blocked by the presence of UN inspectors?”</p>
<p><b>451. </b> The questions about Iraq’s capabilities asked by Mr Cook in response to the </p>
<p>briefing he had been given by Mr Scarlett on 20 February are set out earlier in </p>
<p>this Section.</p>
<p><b>Mr Scarlett’s advice, 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>452.  On 17 March, Mr Scarlett addressed the different elements of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>capability, including Iraq’s actions since the departure of the inspectors in 1998 </b></p>
<p><b>to pursue chemical and biological weapons programmes, and Iraq’s activities to </b></p>
<p><b>pursue enhanced ballistic missiles and other means to deliver them.</b></p>
<p><b>453.  In relation to Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons capability, Mr Scarlett </b></p>
<p><b>concluded that the JIC view was clear: Iraq possessed chemical and biological </b></p>
<p><b>weapons, the means to deliver them, and the capacity to produce them.</b></p>
<p><b>454.  Mr Scarlett attributed the failure to find any significant evidence of chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological weapons to Iraq’s ability to conceal its activities and deceive </b></p>
<p><b>the inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>455. </b> On 17 March, in response to a request from Sir David Manning, Mr Scarlett </p>
<p>provided advice on “the strength of evidence showing Saddam’s possession of WMD”.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>456. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“The starting point is our knowledge of Iraq’s past WMD programmes. This </p>
<p>demonstrates not only large-scale possession of these weapons, and the readiness </p>
<p>to use them, but also Saddam’s determination to retain WMD in the face of military </p>
<p>defeat in 1991 and the subsequent UN inspections. You will recall that much of his </p>
<p>BW programme came to light only in 1995, following Kamil’s [Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>son-in-law] defection. And as UNSCOM demonstrated in 1999, there has never been </p>
<p>a full and convincing account of the destruction of Iraq’s capabilities.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>373</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Mr Scarlett pointed out that:</p>
<p>“Evidence of past possession is not, of course, enough. Indeed it could itself </p>
<p>engender rumour and speculation in Iraq that might be fed back to us as fact. </p>
<p>(Some opposition and defector material may be suspect on these grounds.)”</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Referring to the Government’s assessment of Iraq’s WMD published on </p>
<p>24 September 2002, Mr Scarlett wrote: “our judgement … draws on a range of </p>
<p>well-sourced intelligence” falling under three main headings:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>SIGINT</b> [signals intelligence] has provided extensive material relating to </p>
<p>procurement activities particularly in the missile and UAV field. Some of </p>
<p>this has led to a number of interdictions of missile material. Procurement </p>
<p>of dual-use items that could be related to CBW and nuclear programmes has </p>
<p>also been noted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Imagery </b>has also provided useful material in relation to the extensive </p>
<p>reconstruction of the Iraq’s [sic] missile infrastructure, such as the identification </p>
<p>of the al-Rafah Test Stand and the al-Mamoun solid fuel facility. Because many </p>
<p>chemical and biological facilities are dual-use, it is difficult for imagery to provide </p>
<p>proof of the existence of a CBW programme. For this reason we have not relied </p>
<p>on imagery in supporting our case that Iraq has a CBW programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>HUMINT </b>[human intelligence]<b> </b>has provided clear and consistent reporting </p>
<p>relating to Iraq’s continuing WMD programmes …”</p>
<p><b>459. </b> Mr Scarlett added that HUMINT came “from a variety of sources”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS have a number of well placed and reliable sources […] [with high-level </p>
<p>access in Iraq] and have been able to report on the regime’s WMD policy, its </p>
<p>plans for use and its extensive concealment efforts. SIS also have a number of </p>
<p>sources who report from closer to the programmes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some of these have provided a consistent picture of Iraq’s missile programme </p>
<p>(including extension of Al Samoud and the existence of Al Husseins).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on CBW programmes has been less complete but indicates </p>
<p>continued production of CBW agents after UNSCOM’s departure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CIA and other foreign intelligence agencies (the mobile BW production </p>
<p>laboratories originated from […]).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DIS … reporting, relating to Iraq’s long range missile programme.”</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that Sir David Manning was “familiar with the main conclusions </p>
<p>from intelligence”.</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Addressing Saddam Hussein’s behaviour, Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“The picture from past possession and from intelligence is further reinforced by </p>
<p>Saddam’s current behaviour. He has been given clear opportunities to avoid </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>374</p>
<p>military action by demonstrating full and active co-operation with UNMOVIC. </p>
<p>But he has repeatedly failed to take this route. Leaving aside the intelligence on his </p>
<p>concealment tactics, his actions since the adoption of UNSCR 1441 are strongly </p>
<p>indicative of deceit. They include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure to volunteer scientists for interview outside Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>illicit procurement, and subsequent concealment, of Volga engines;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure to declare reconstructed facilities (including the rocket motor casting </p>
<p>chambers) previously disabled by UNSCOM”.</p>
<p><b>462. </b> In relation to inspections, Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“The failure of UNMOVIC to uncover significant chemical or biological weapons </p>
<p>has been disappointing. But it is not wholly unexpected. On 16 October last year,</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the JIC judged that there was a serious risk that Iraq could prevent inspectors from </p>
<p>finding conclusive evidence of WMD before the spring, unless there was additional </p>
<p>guidance to UNMOVIC. The JIC pointed in particular to the importance of interviews </p>
<p>free of Iraqi intimidation: you know the limited progress in this area.”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded:</p>
<p>“The JIC view is clear. Iraq possesses chemical and biological weapons, the means </p>
<p>to deliver them and the capacity to produce them. The scale of the holdings is </p>
<p>hard to quantify: it is undoubtedly much less than in 1991. But the evidence points </p>
<p>both to Saddam’s view that the capability is already militarily significant, and to his </p>
<p>determination – left to his own devices – to build it up further.”</p>
<p><b>464. </b> A reference in paragraph 4 of the minute to the conclusions being “summarised </p>
<p>at Annex” was crossed out by Mr Scarlett on the signed version of the minute on </p>
<p>the No.10 file.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Mr Scarlett sent a copy of the minute to Mr Powell in February 2004 with a </p>
<p>manuscript note stating that he had “not yet traced a copy of the Annex”.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>466. </b> The Government could not find any evidence of an Annex. The Inquiry concludes </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>376</p>
<p><b>477. </b> A JIC Note, ‘Saddam: The Beginning of the End’, which revisited previous </p>
<p>JIC judgements in the light of recent events and intelligence, was issued by the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff on 19 March after discussion by the JIC earlier that day.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>478. </b> Addressing the use of chemical and biological weapons, the Note stated that the </p>
<p>JIC judged:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “a usable CBW capability, deliverable using artillery, missiles and </p>
<p>possibly unmanned aerial vehicles”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s Al Hussein and shorter-range missiles, “mostly with a range of 150km or </p>
<p>less … may be able to deliver CBW, although intelligence suggests that Iraq </p>
<p>might lack warheads capable of the effective dispersal of such agents.”</p>
<p><b>479. </b> In addition, the Note stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A report […] in mid-March indicated that Iraq’s chemical weapons remained </p>
<p>disassembled and that Saddam had not yet ordered their assembly.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The issue of gas masks and injections for CBW antidotes indicated “Iraqi plans </p>
<p>to use CBW”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence on the timing of CBW use is inconsistent […].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on the deployment of CBW was “sparse”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Uncorroborated reporting” suggested the “delivery of CW shells to Republican </p>
<p>Guard units … south of Baghdad”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence” that ballistic missiles destroyed by Coalition air action </p>
<p>in February “were equipped with CBW warheads”, but the JIC could not be sure </p>
<p>that it “would receive indications prior to an attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein retained “ultimate control of CBW use”, but there were </p>
<p>suggestions that he had “contingency plans to devolve military decision </p>
<p>making, including CBW, to regional commands, if communications are cut </p>
<p>with Baghdad”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “might take this decision early, once the severity of the initial </p>
<p>attack becomes clear or in the face of Kurdish or Shia uprisings”, although the </p>
<p>possibility of Saddam Hussein offering concessions to remain in power “would </p>
<p>argue against pre-emptive attacks and devolving control”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An “early strategic U-turn, once Saddam realises the intensity of the attack … </p>
<p>and the risk of losing control of his CBW capability” could not be ruled out, and </p>
<p>he might “then order early CBW attacks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued to judge that “in the face of death and the destruction of his </p>
<p>regime”, Saddam Hussein would “try to wreak as much havoc as possible”, but </p>

<p>There was a “further risk … that CBW could become available to extremist </p>
<p>groups either as a last vindictive act by Saddam, or through the loss of control  </p>
<p>in the final days of his regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Two recent reports suggested that “some or all” of Iraq’s Al Hussein missiles </p>
<p>“were disassembled to hide them from inspectors. It would take Iraq at least </p>
<p>several days to reassemble the missiles once they decided to do so.”</p>
<p><b>480. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that an Intelligence Update produced on 10 March </p>
<p>had referred to a report issued on 7 March:</p>
<p>“… essentially saying that Iraq had no missiles which could reach Israel and none </p>
<p>which could carry germ or biological weapons.</p>
<p>“The leadership had ordered the dismantlement of the missiles known as Al Hussein </p>
<p>… to avoid discovery and they thought they could be quickly re-assembled. The JIC </p>
<p>had over many months throughout this period reported the assessed existence </p>
<p>of these missiles … But all along, it had been reported that they had been </p>
<p>disassembled and concealed.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The Defence Intelligence Staff advised … that … it might be possible to reassemble </p>
<p>[the missiles] in one or two days. But if it was very complex disassembly it would </p>
<p>be longer.</p>
<p>“SIS advised that the reference to ‘germ and biological’ might also refer to chemical, </p>
<p>just from the context, although that was speculative.”</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Sir John Scarlett also told the Inquiry that, on 17 March:</p>
<p>“… intelligence was received that chemical weapons had been disassembled </p>
<p>and dispersed and would be difficult to reassemble. Saddam had not yet ordered </p>
<p>reassembly nor, indeed, asked about chemical weapons.”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Sir John added that the two reports:</p>
<p>“… were assessed in the context of the policy of dispersal and concealment. </p>
<p>They were not understood to be an indication that chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>did not exist. Indeed they didn’t say that but … it was clear … that they might be </p>
<p>difficult to find.</p>
<p>“Previous reporting and updates had already reported separately on the difficulty </p>
<p>that Iraq was having or was reported to have in developing or redeveloping chemical </p>
<p>warheads for ballistic missiles … An update at the end of December had noted … </p>

<p><b>483. </b> Asked whether the JIC had revised its assessment in the light of the reports, </p>
<p>Sir John stated:</p>
<p>“… the JIC looked again at the issue and recorded its view in the minute [JIC </p>
<p>Note] of 19 March and judged then that Iraq had a usable chemical and biological </p>
<p>warfare capability, deliverable by artillery shells and possibly by aerial vehicles. </p>
<p>It also said that missiles might be available to deliver CBW, but Iraq might lack </p>
<p>the necessary warheads …”</p>

<p><b>484. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 20 March that Saddam Hussein would, in extremis, </p>
<p>probably use chemical and biological weapons, and that it was believed that some were </p>

<p>181</p>
<p><b>485. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote to Mr Powell on 21 March stating that: “in the current crisis, </p>

<p>intention of launching a hostile war against Iraq and occupying it under the pretext of the </p>
<p>presence in Iraq of weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Mr Aldouri stated:</p>
<p>“For the record, and for the sake of historical accuracy, as well as to reassure every </p>
<p>State that has recently made active efforts to maintain peace and to prevent war, we </p>
<p>would like to reiterate that Iraq no longer possesses weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>The presence of such weapons has been relegated to the past. Iraq decided in </p>

<p>so arduously to put before the Council as damning evidence”. The US and the UK had </p>
<p>failed to “provide even a shred of evidence”.</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Mr Aldouri concluded by reaffirming that Iraq would “continue to work with the </p>
<p>Security Council to make the truth known” that Iraq was “free of weapons of mass </p>

<p>distribution to named senior officials.</p>
<p><b>498. </b> The report did not make clear that SIS was not itself in contact with the source </p>
<p>whom it considered had direct access to Iraq’s programmes.</p>
<p><b>499. </b> The detail of the reporting and Sir Richard Dearlove’s description of it in a </p>
<p>telephone call to Mr Scarlett on 11 September are set out in Section 4.2.</p>
<p><b>500. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove briefed Mr Blair on the reporting on 12 September, </p>
<p>when he had:</p>
<p>“… underlined … the potential importance of the new source and what SIS </p>
<p>understood his access to be; but also said that the case was developmental and </p>
<p>that the source remained unproven.”</p>

<p><b>501. </b> SIS4 suggested that Mr Blair had already known about the intelligence before </p>

<p>wanted to see the product.</p>

<p><b>502. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry that “it would have been very rare” for him to </p>
<p>have talked to Ministers or Mr Blair “about our source base”.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>503. </b> Asked about Mr Blair’s reaction, Sir Richard told the Inquiry that Sir David Manning </p>
<p>had asked him to give Mr Blair a briefing “which would give him [Mr Blair] more of a </p>
<p>flavour for what was actually going on on the ground”.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> Mr Blair “had an appetite for </p>
<p>that sort of briefing which was a pretty rare event”, and had had a “fair amount of general </p>
<p>discussion” with SIS9 “about the difficulties and problems we were facing”.</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Asked whether he had been precipitate in going to Ministers with the report so </p>
<p>quickly, Sir Richard replied:</p>
<p>“I think in the circumstances, I don’t agree … because if you issue a report like that </p>
<p>in the middle of a crisis, you’re going to get a phone call from a Ministerial office </p>
<p>within a short period of time.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Sir Richard also stated that in the circumstances it would have been “impossible” </p>
<p>not to issue the report; SIS could not “sit on something as potentially important” </p>

<p><b>506. </b> The report of 11 September was used by Mr Scarlett and Mr Miller in reaching </p>
<p>key judgements about Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons capabilities in the </p>
<p>Government dossier published on 24 September.</p>
<p><b>507. </b> Specifically it provided the assurance for the judgements that Iraq had:</p>

<p>“continued to produce chemical and biological agents”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons …”</p>
<p><b>508. </b> The way in which the reporting was used in the preparation of the dossier and the </p>

<p><b>509. </b> The judgements in the dossier on Iraq’s production of chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons and the circumstances in which they could be used became the baseline for </p>
<p>subsequent advice to Ministers and public statements on the threat posed by Iraq.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> SIS issued a second report from the same sourcing chain as the 11 September </p>
<p>report on 23 September.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> That stated VX, sarin and soman had been produced at </p>
<p>Al-Yarmuk, and were loaded into a variety of “containers”, including “linked hollow glass </p>
<p>spheres”. The source commented that there had been “accelerated production of CW </p>
<p>substances at Al-Yarmuk for several years”.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> SIS described the report as expanding and clarifying the intelligence in the first </p>
<p>report, and that it was “valuable intelligence”.</p>
<p><b>512. </b> The report was sent to the same restricted group as the report on 11 September, </p>
<p>with the addition of Mr Mark Bowman, Private Secretary to Mr Gordon Brown, the </p>

<p><b>513. </b> The Butler Report stated that SIS had hopes that this source would become a </p>

<p> In particular, the source had indicated to SIS that he would be able to </p>
<p>provide substantial and critical additional intelligence in the near future.</p>

<p>382</p>
<p><b>517. </b> A minute of 2 April recorded that a SIS Requirements officer had been telephoned </p>
<p>the previous night about the two reports produced in September 2002. Mr Scarlett had </p>
<p>asked “about the reliability of the sourcing” and for a copy as he no longer had access to </p>
<p>the original copies.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>518. </b> The SIS Requirements officer had given “only the briefest details (that we </p>
<p>obtained the material via another source, with whom we were no longer in contact, and </p>
<p>that we were still trying to contact the original source)”.</p>
<p><b>519. </b> The SIS Requirements officer also wrote:</p>
<p>“Despite the problems over the … sourcing chain, there could be some merit in at </p>
<p>least widening the extremely limited readership of these two reports. We cannot (yet) </p>
<p>discount their content and, topically … [the report of 11 September] provides useful </p>
<p>support for … [another report]. The case is no longer as sensitive and we could </p>
<p>usefully re-circulate the two reports, with some additional commentary.”</p>
<p><b>520. </b> The SIS Requirements officer provided a draft letter for SIS4 to send to Mr Scarlett.</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Another SIS Requirements officer commented that there had been “no public use </p>
<p>of the material; what it was used for was to give assurance to the assessment in the </p>
<p>‘dossier’ that Iraq continued production of CW after 1998”. The DIS would “welcome” the </p>
<p>downgrading of the restricted marking on the reports and it would “need to see these </p>
<p>reports whenever a review of the Iraq WMD story is commissioned”.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>522. </b> SIS4 wrote to Mr Scarlett on 3 April 2003 providing copies of the two reports of </p>
<p>11 and 23 September 2002.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>523. </b> The letter stated that the reports were “not drawn upon for either the dossier or for </p>
<p>the Prime Minister’s subsequent statements. And of course it [the material] post-dated </p>
<p>… [the JIC Assessment of 9 September 2002, ‘Iraqi Use of Chemical and Biological </p>
<p>Weapons – Possible Scenarios’].” SIS4 also wrote that Sir Richard Dearlove had briefed </p>
<p>Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… on the background to the case (and on what else we hoped it might deliver) but </p>
<p>for speed the reports were issued to other readers without a full briefing. This was to </p>
<p>have followed but, as there was no further reporting, we did not bother you with this.”</p>
<p><b>524. </b> SIS4 added:</p>
<p>“You may therefore wish to know something of the background to the case. The </p>
<p>material came from an Iraqi sub-source who was working within the CW programme </p>
<p>[via SIS source]. We are still endeavouring to establish direct contact with him [the </p>
<p>sub-source]; until we succeed in this we shall not be able to verify fully the details </p>

<p>other reporting issued on 30 March 2003].”</p>
<p><b>525. </b> Because source protection was no longer as sensitive, the documents would be </p>
<p>reissued “with additional comment and to a wider readership”.</p>
<p><b>526. </b> A report was issued on 3 April 2003 which was described as “a lightly edited </p>
<p>composite of two reports” previously issued in September 2002. The source </p>
<p>was described as: “A new source (with whom contact has now ceased) quoting </p>
<p>the [sub-source].”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>527. </b> The 3 April report merged much of the reporting in the reports of 11 and 23 </p>
<p>September 2002 and added new comments from SIS. The significant changes were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A statement that “capability outstripped personnel able to operate it” was moved </p>
<p>to the Summary of the report. That gave it additional prominence in comparison </p>
<p>with the original report of 11 September.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS added a comment that this was consistent with a later report from March </p>
<p>2003 about the problems caused by the dispersal of technical experts previously </p>
<p>involved in the production of CW.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Details of spherical glass containers filled with CW agents at the named </p>
<p>establishment, which had constituted part of the main body of the second report, </p>
<p>were identified as a “source comment” in the 3 April report.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Additional details were provided substantiating the authenticity of the sub-</p>
<p>source’s existence. His previous involvement in CW activities was also </p>
<p>emphasised.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS acknowledged that it would not be possible “to verify fully” the details in </p>
<p>the report until it had succeeded in gaining direct access to the sub-source, </p>
<p>but it had “no reason to dismiss the bulk of this material, for which there </p>
<p>has been collateral”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>However, it drew attention to the fact that the source’s description of the device </p>
<p>and its spherical glass contents was “remarkably similar to the fictional chemical </p>
<p>weapon portrayed in the film <i>The Rock</i>”. It acknowledged that the similarity </p>
<p>had been pointed out by one recipient when the report of 23 September was </p>
<p>circulated. That significantly changed the context in which the details were </p>
<p>subsequently presented in the reissued report.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is no evidence that that point was made to the original readers of the </p>
<p>reports before they were reissued on 3 April.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>SIS added a comment that the reporting of additional risks being taken to </p>

<p>working practices and their disregard for safety.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS also added a comment that the reporting of an order to stop production and </p>
<p>decontaminate equipment in August 2002 was “unsurprising” as it paralleled the </p>
<p>then assumed arrival of UNMOVIC. It added that the current state of the facility </p>
<p>“and the material produced prior to August 2002” was “unknown”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS had been unable to identify the “anthrax specialist” mentioned in the </p>
<p>original report.</p>
<p><b>528. </b> The summary of the intelligence produced for dissemination at “Secret” level, </p>
<p>including to selected foreign partners, presented the information that the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>had “demanded accelerated production of BCW substances” in 2002. In August 2002 an </p>
<p>order had been sent to all factories involved in producing BCW instructing them to stop </p>

<p><b>534. </b> The Requirements officer added:</p>
<p>“Without denying that these reports are no longer valid, we need to ensure their </p>

<p><b>535. </b> The relevant SIS team leader had “prepared the ground with Mr Scarlett and </p>
<p>others for the likelihood that, now we have the opportunity to validate our CX, some may </p>

<p>reports had been issued and sought SIS3 and SIS4 approval for the text to be used.</p>
<p><b>537. </b> The Requirements officer also commented:</p>
<p>“… there are still unanswered questions as to how this story could have been so </p>
<p>wrong, but that is not an issue for CX readers.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove informed the ISC in mid-July 2003 that the intelligence had </p>
<p>been withdrawn.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>539. </b> Internal SIS documents seen by the Inquiry show that the briefing produced for Sir </p>
<p>Richard Dearlove’s appearance before the ISC stated that: “In the light of the post-war </p>
<p>research … [the reporting of 11 and 23 September 2002] has now been withdrawn.”</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>540. </b> A memorandum withdrawing the reports of 3 April 2003 (and 11 and </p>
<p>23 September 2002) was issued on 29 July 2003.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> It said that SIS had interviewed the </p>
<p>individual identified as the sub-source for the intelligence after the conflict, but he had </p>
<p>denied being the source of the material passed to SIS. The memorandum stated that the </p>
<p>reports were being withdrawn because the sourcing chain was discredited. That did “not </p>
<p>necessarily invalidate their contents (some of which chimed with other reporting)”.</p>
<p><b>541. </b> The memorandum was sent to most of the recipients of the original reports, </p>
<p>including to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Hoon and to Mr Bowen in the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office. But it was not sent to No.10 or to Mr Brown’s Private Office.</p>
<p><b>542. </b> In the covering letter to SIS’s Annual Report for 2002-2003, Sir Richard Dearlove </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“Iraq of course has been the dominant issue. I am confident that the intelligence </p>
<p>picture to which we contributed pre-conflict will be proved correct.”</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Sir Richard added that the search for Saddam Hussein’s WMD would continue </p>
<p>into 2004, “and possibly beyond”. He also wrote:</p>
<p>“We risk damage to the credibility of the intelligence community if the public </p>
<p>perception remains that our intelligence may have been wrong. If we can persuade </p>
<p>Iraqi scientists involved in the programme to go public, then we may be able to turn </p>
<p>the media debate more in our favour and reduce our dependence on the eventual </p>
<p>outcome of the physical search.”</p>

<p>THE INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY COMMITTEE’S VIEW</p>
<p><b>548. </b> In its Report published in September 2003, the ISC stated that it had considered </p>
<p>the concerns expressed by two individuals in the DIS about “the language used in </p>
<p>the draft dossier, which was not in their view supported by the intelligence available </p>
<p>to them on the current production of chemical and biological agents and weapons”. </p>
<p>The Report stated:</p>
<p>“We were told that there was further intelligence of a nature so sensitive that it </p>
<p>was only released on a very restricted basis. We have seen the intelligence and </p>
<p>understand the basis on which the CDI [Chief of Defence Intelligence] and JIC took </p>
<p>the view they did.”</p>

<p><b>552. </b> The Butler Report noted that the two reports, “including one which was important in </p>

<p>MINISTERIAL AWARENESS THAT THE REPORTING HAD BEEN WITHDRAWN</p>
<p><b>554.  Mr Blair and Mr Hoon became aware that the reporting had been withdrawn </b></p>
<p><b>as a result of the Butler Review.</b></p>
<p><b>555. </b> In the No.10 press briefing on 16 July 2004, Mr Blair’s Official Spokesman was </p>
<p>asked why Lord Hutton had not been informed that the intelligence had been withdrawn </p>
<p>a month before Mr Scarlett had given evidence to the Hutton Inquiry.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> The Spokesman </p>
<p>replied that SIS validation of the intelligence was still “ongoing” and that at the time </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett gave evidence, “this matter was still being investigated”.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Asked about Sir Richard Dearlove’s evidence to the Hutton Inquiry that the </p>
<p>information in the dossier was “sound” and whether the SIS decision not to inform </p>
<p>Lord Hutton that the intelligence had been withdrawn meant that Sir Richard’s evidence </p>
<p>had been “wrong”, the Spokesman replied that “Lord Hutton had been investigating the </p>
<p>controversy surrounding the 45-minute claim, not the wider intelligence picture”.</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Asked when Mr Blair had “discovered” that the intelligence had been withdrawn, </p>
<p>the Spokesman replied that Mr Blair “had not known at the time he had given evidence </p>
<p>to Lord Hutton [on 28 August 2003]” that the intelligence had been withdrawn “because </p>
<p>the process of validation had been ongoing”. Mr Blair had “found out” that the </p>
<p>intelligence had been withdrawn “as a result of the Butler Inquiry”.</p>
<p><b>558. </b> In Written Questions to Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, Mr Adam Price </p>
<p>(Plaid Cymru) asked each of them when they were:</p>
<p>“… informed that SIS had withdrawn reporting from the source who claimed </p>
<p>that production of biological and chemical agents had been accelerated by </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime, because the source of the reporting had subsequently been </p>
<p>deemed unreliable.”</p>
<p><b>559. </b> Mr Straw replied on 20 July:</p>
<p>“I became aware of the withdrawal of this reporting when I agreed, in response to </p>
<p>a request from SIS on 8 September 2003, that the reports in question should be </p>
<p>disclosed to the Intelligence and Security Committee.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Mr Hoon replied on 21 July:</p>
<p>“I first became aware that SIS had withdrawn the reports as a result of the </p>
<p>Butler Review.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Mr Blair replied on 21 July:</p>
<p>“As my Official Spokesman made clear on 16 July, it was as a result of the </p>
<p>Butler Review.”</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>562. </b> In response to a further question from Mr Price, asking when he had become </p>
<p>aware that “in July 2003” SIS “had withdrawn two reports from a new source on trial </p>
<p>because the source had by then been discredited”, Mr Blair replied on 16 September:</p>
<p>“These matters have been examined during the course of the Butler Review and </p>
<p>other inquiries, and covered during debates and statements on Iraq and in briefings </p>
<p>by my Official Spokesman. All relevant information has been placed in the public </p>
<p>domain insofar as that could be done without prejudicing national security.”</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>563. </b> Asked by Mr Bob Marshall-Andrews (Labour), in November 2004, for the </p>
<p>precise date on which he was aware of the intelligence services’ withdrawal of “wholly </p>
<p>discredited” reports, Mr Blair replied that he thought:</p>
<p>“… the doubts about the information … were drawn to our attention during the </p>
<p>Butler Review. I can certainly look into the precise date on which that happened. </p>
<p>It has to be said, however, and I hope that he understands this, that the information </p>
<p>and intelligence that we received, we received in good faith and acted on in </p>
<p>good faith.”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Although the SIS minute of 29 July 2003 withdrawing the reporting was sent to </p>
<p>the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Hoon and to the Cabinet Office, it was not sent </p>
<p>to No.10.</p>
<p><b>565. </b> The withdrawal of the reporting was done in a very low key manner compared with </p>
<p>the way in which the original reporting was issued. That and the timing of the minute </p>
<p>may explain why it was not drawn to Mr Hoon’s attention. It is not clear why SIS did not </p>
<p>inform No.10 or ask the Assessments Staff to do so.</p>
<p><b>566.  Senior members of SIS offered the Inquiry differing views about how the </b></p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>567. </b> Asked about the confidence attached to the reports of 11 and 23 September, </p>
<p>SIS1 told the Inquiry that he thought “it was based in part on wishful thinking”. </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“SIS was under quite extraordinary pressure to try and get a better view of Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD programme, and I think we marketed that intelligence – I think this is not [an] </p>
<p>original comment – before it was fully validated.”</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>568. </b> Asked whether there were doubts in SIS’s collective consciousness even before </p>
<p>March 2003, SIS1 replied:</p>
<p>“Well before that. Even while it was still going on. Here was a chap who promised </p>
<p>the crock of gold at the end of the rainbow. Now, you have got to go for those, </p>
<p>because sometimes that can be just what you are looking for.”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>569. </b> Asked about the strain that had put on the validation process and the way in which </p>
<p>it is reported, SIS1 replied:</p>
<p>“Well, there wasn’t much to validate. What he was promising had not arrived. </p>
<p>That was the point.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… and I think that that created an expectation which could not be fulfilled, not only </p>
<p>on the part of those who were briefed on it …”</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>570. </b> Asked whether the reporting was the reason for the belief that there was a growing </p>
<p>threat, SIS1 replied: “No, because, again, there wasn’t much to go on.”</p>
<p><b>571. </b> Asked if the reporting had influenced actual assessments, SIS1 replied:</p>
<p>“No, he didn’t influence assessments. He influenced expectation on the part of </p>
<p>people who were concerned, are we going in the right direction.”</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Asked about Sir David Omand’s comment to the Inquiry that SIS over-promised </p>
<p>and under-delivered, SIS1 replied:</p>
<p>“If he was referring to that [the information promised by the SIS source], I think he’s </p>
<p>right. I would hate it to be the epitaph of the whole period. If that was the suggestion, </p>
<p>that’s completely untrue.”</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>573. </b> Asked about the confidence which Sir Richard Dearlove had expressed in the </p>
<p>intelligence, SIS4 told the Inquiry that, for SIS, the report had a story behind it. The </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>technical experts in SIS “knew the Iraqi story intimately”. If they “said we know about this </p>
<p>chap, we know about the account of his past, if he’s possibly in touch with us and going </p>
<p>to send us stuff, that’s a very major development”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>574. </b> SIS4 added that it was “potentially a very, very serious breakthrough”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>575. </b> SIS4 told the Inquiry that Sir Richard Dearlove had not, in his view, “acted </p>
<p>unprofessionally” in briefing Mr Blair about the 11 September report. He had had “to take </p>
<p>all these political decisions on his own shoulders” and those were:</p>
<p>“Heavy responsibilities.</p>
<p>“He judged that Blair needed to know, and he told him. I don’t think he did a wrong </p>
<p>thing. The style may be questioned, but I don’t think he was wrong to do what he did.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>“… the analysis and motivation at the time … stands.”</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Asked why Mr Blair was under the impression when he gave evidence to the </p>
<p>Hutton Inquiry that the process of validation was still continuing, SIS4 told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think that was one of life’s ghastlinesses. I don’t think the withdrawal notice was </p>
<p>sent to Number 10 because withdrawal notices are not major new intelligence. </p>
<p>They are not the sort of thing ministers get up early to read. What they do affect, </p>
<p>importantly, is the integrity of the record.</p>
<p>“I imagine that the requirements officer issuing the withdrawal report … thought, </p>
<p>‘They won’t be interested in this’. How wrong he was, and what a skid-up within just </p>
<p>a few days, when the Prime Minister said at a public inquiry something that was </p>
<p>probably not the case.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> It’s very embarrassing.”</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Asked whether that was, “A cock-up rather than a conspiracy”, SIS4 replied: </p>

<p>391</p>
<p><b>578. </b> Asked what conclusions he had drawn when reviewing the case in 2004, </p>
<p>SIS3 replied:</p>
<p>“Well, I think it illustrated, first of all, the dangers of a chain of sourcing …</p>
<p>“The second point is that when you have senior people who reach down into </p>
<p>the machinery and try moving the cogs, if I may put it like that … you obviously </p>
<p>disenfranchise the operational chain of command. You cut out expertise, and </p>
<p>perhaps you also disable that element of challenge which is, I think, a very important </p>
<p>part of operational life in the Service.</p>
<p>“The third point is there was a judgment … that we had overpromised and </p>
<p>underdelivered. I absolutely agreed with that judgment. It’s precisely what we did.”</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>579. </b> Pressed to clarify to whom he was referring, SIS3 told the Inquiry he was reporting </p>
<p>what people had said about Sir Richard Dearlove, and that it had been controversial at </p>
<p>the time at an operational and working level where he thought “people were genuinely </p>
<p>annoyed and concerned”.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>580. </b> Asked whether there were political pressures not to be as careful as SIS should </p>
<p>have been over an unvalidated, untested source, SIS3 replied:</p>
<p>“Well, it was obviously pressure – whether you describe it as political pressure </p>
<p>or merely pressure from Assessments Staff – to have more material, in a sense </p>
<p>responding to the tasking that we had received. Clearly when you are under a lot of </p>
<p>pressure to produce intelligence, there is a risk that you will take short cuts.”</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>581.  The information in the report issued on 11 September was very striking and </b></p>
<p><b>further information confirming the material as the source promised would have </b></p>
<p><b>been of great importance in providing proof that Iraq had chemical and biological </b></p>
<p><b>programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>582.  The way the report of 11 September was used to support critical judgements </b></p>
<p><b>in the dossier without being subject to evaluation and challenge by the </b></p>
<p><b>appropriate technical experts or properly assessed by the JIC is addressed in </b></p>
<p><b>Section 4.2.</b></p>

<p><b>585.  Given the controversy about the failure to find WMD and questions about </b></p>
<p><b>whether the intelligence had been presented accurately after the conflict, </b></p>
<p><b>Sir Richard Dearlove should have ensured that Ministers were aware of the </b></p>

<p><b>Withdrawal of two other streams of SIS reporting</b></p>
<p><b>586.  By the middle of 2004, serious doubts had emerged about two further </b></p>
<p><b>streams of reporting which had informed pre-conflict assessments on:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the production and possession of stocks of chemical and </b></p>
<p><b>biological agents;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the weaponisation and deployment of those agents;</b></p>

<p><b>reporting from the chain responsible for the “45 minutes” report and a number of </b></p>
<p><b>other reports including the one which had informed the 27 November 2002 Update.</b></p>
<p><b>588. </b> The ISC Report published in September 2003 stated that Sir Richard Dearlove </p>
<p>told the Committee that the sourcing for the SIS report of 30 August (the source for </p>
<p>the reference in the September dossier to chemical and biological weapons being </p>
<p>deployable within 45 minutes of an order to use them), was “reliable”:</p>
<p>“The senior military officer named and quoted in the report was in a position to </p>
<p>comment on the deployment of chemical and biological weapons.”</p>

<p>before Sir Richard Dearlove gave further evidence to the Butler Review on 10 June.</p>
<p><b>592. </b> When Mr Straw saw the papers he asked for them to be sent to Mr Blair “without </p>

<p><b>598. </b> SIS did not gain direct access to Curve Ball until early 2004.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>599. </b> The US Commission on WMD reported that the CIA had doubts about Curve Ball </p>
<p>from summer 2003:</p>
<p>“Any remaining doubts, however, were removed when the CIA was finally given </p>
<p>access to Curve Ball himself in March 2004. At that time, Curve Ball’s inability to </p>
<p>explain discrepancies in his reporting, his description of facilities and events, and </p>
<p>his general demeanor led to the conclusion that his information was unreliable … </p>
<p>Having concluded that Curve Ball had fabricated his reporting, CIA and Defense </p>
<p>HUMINT recalled all of it.”</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>600. </b> A senior SIS officer replied to the questions raised by Mr Blair on 10 June.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The senior SIS officer stated that, if intelligence from the sub-source were withdrawn, </p>
<p>there was:</p>
<p>“… still a body of intelligence which consistently indicated that Saddam was </p>
<p>considering using CBW; that he would be prepared to use it against advancing allied </p>
<p>forces; and that he considered possession of CBW vital to the long term survival of </p>
<p>his regime.”</p>
<p><b>601. </b> The senior SIS officer also reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS had received a large amount of liaison reporting, “about deception of </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the concealment of CBW; and limited reporting on the military </p>
<p>deployment of CBW”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS was validating other sources.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CIA had already formally withdrawn some reporting from Curve Ball but SIS </p>
<p>continued to judge that it was “premature to conclude … that all intelligence from </p>
<p>the source must be discounted”.</p>
<p><b>602. </b> The senior SIS officer added that, as a result of its discussions with Curve Ball </p>
<p>earlier in 2004, the “most likely function” of the trailers he had described was “to </p>
<p>provide a breakout production capability and not the continual production of material </p>
<p>for stockpiling”.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Separately, Mr Tim Dowse, who succeeded Mr Miller as Chief of the Assessments </p>
<p>Staff in November 2003, sent Sir Nigel Sheinwald an assessment of the impact of </p>
<p>concerns about the reliability of the sourcing chain for the 45 minute report.</p>
<p>235</p>

<p><b>604. </b> The sub-source for the 45 minute report had provided five reports which were </p>
<p>drawn on in the JIC Assessments of 21 August, 9 September, 11 October, 6 December </p>
<p>2002 and 19 February 2003. In addition, he had provided the reporting for the </p>
<p>JIC Update of 27 November.</p>
<p><b>605. </b> Mr Dowse wrote that, while the intelligence was not “crucial to key judgements” in </p>
<p>the JIC Assessments, it had:</p>
<p>“… increased our confidence in judgements that Saddam possessed and was </p>
<p>prepared to use chemical and biological weapons – but these also rested on </p>
<p>other intelligence.”</p>
<p><b>606. </b> Reporting from the sub-source was crucial on “one detailed point”, the statement </p>
<p>in the 9 September Assessment that Iraq could deploy chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>within 45 minutes.</p>
<p><b>607. </b> Mr Dowse added:</p>
<p>“However, this would not have materially affected the key JIC judgements on Iraqi </p>
<p>capabilities: it was seen simply as extra detail supporting the picture of the Iraqi </p>
<p>command and control structure that we already had, based on other intelligence. </p>
<p>The prominence this point has received in the media since the conflict was not how </p>
<p>it was seen by the JIC at the time.”</p>
<p><b>608. </b> An internal SIS minute of 8 June also identified that the sub-source had </p>
<p>provided a report in late 2002 that Iraq had an indigenous UAV programme capable of </p>
<p>CBW delivery.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Mr Dowse wrote to Sir Nigel Sheinwald again on 7 July, reporting that SIS had </p>
<p>provided a more detailed summary of its work to validate the pre-conflict sources on </p>
<p>Iraqi WMD, which was continuing.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>610. </b> Mr Dowse concluded:</p>
<p>“… we see no reason at present to revise JIC judgements on Iraqi WMD beyond </p>
<p>the (objectively minor, but presentationally very awkward) point over the ‘45 </p>
<p>minutes’ claim …”</p>
<p><b>611.  The Butler Report published on 14 July stated that serious doubts had </b></p>
<p><b>emerged about the reliability of intelligence from three sources.</b></p>

<p>weapons, their use and their concealment … [D]oubts – and in some cases serious </p>
<p>doubts – have emerged about the reliability of intelligence from three sources whose </p>
<p>intelligence helped to underpin JIC Assessments and the Government’s dossier of </p>
<p>September 2002.”</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>613. </b> The withdrawal of intelligence in July 2003 from the source of the reports issued on </p>
<p>11 and 23 September 2002 is dealt with earlier in this Section.</p>
<p><b>614. </b> The Butler Report stated that more than 80 percent of the human intelligence </p>
<p>reports “which had had a material influence on JIC Assessments on Iraqi deception </p>
<p>and concealment … came from two principal sources”; and that one of those sources </p>
<p>produced two-thirds of the reports.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> Because both sources were “believed at the </p>
<p>time to be reporting reliably”, there would have been “a tendency for the intelligence </p>
<p>community to assume that they were similarly reporting reliably on Iraqi concealment </p>
<p>and deception”.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> In a footnote, the Butler Report drew attention to the fact that, during SIS validation </p>
<p>of its sources after the conflict, doubts had emerged about the reliability of reporting from </p>
<p>the source providing the smaller proportion of the reports.</p>
<p><b>616. </b> The Butler Report stated that two sources had produced “some two-thirds of all the </p>
<p>intelligence reports” circulated in 2002. Those reports had “had a significant influence on </p>
<p>intelligence assessments on Iraqi use of chemical and biological weapons”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>One of those sources “reported accurately and authoritatively on some key </p>
<p>issues”, but on the “production and stocks of chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>and agents, he could only report what he learned from others in his circle of high </p>
<p>level contacts in Baghdad”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In 2002, SIS issued a number of reports from the second source “quoting a new </p>
<p>sub-source on Iraqi chemical and biological programmes and intentions”. SIS </p>
<p>considered the second source “to be an established and reliable source” whose </p>
<p>“intelligence on other subjects had previously been corroborated”. SIS had also </p>
<p>included a caution about the sub-source’s links to Iraqi opposition groups.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>617. </b> The Butler Report stated that it had:</p>
<p>“… been informed by SIS that the validity of the intelligence report on which the </p>

<p>affecting this intelligence report.”</p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>618. </b> The third source about which doubts had arisen provided “the vast majority of the </p>
<p>intelligence suggesting that Iraq had developed mobile facilities for the production of </p>
<p>biological agent”.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Butler Review in May 2004 that these </p>
<p>reports had “been received through a liaison service” and SIS:</p>
<p>“… had been able to verify that he had worked in an area which would have meant </p>
<p>that he would have had access to the sort of information he claimed to have. But </p>
<p>they had not been able to question him directly until after the war.”</p>
<p><b>619. </b> SIS told the Butler Review that, after their initial debrief of the source (Curve Ball):</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had “become apparent that significant detail did not appear in the original </p>
<p>liaison reports … But based on the information derived from the limited access </p>
<p>to date we continue to judge that it is premature to conclude … that all the </p>
<p>intelligence from the source must be discounted.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS had concluded that the trailers described by the source as part of the mobile </p>
<p>facilities would have produced agent in the form of a slurry, which would have </p>
<p>a limited life, and, therefore, that the “most likely function … was to provide a </p>
<p>breakout production capability and not the continued production of material </p>
<p>for stockpiling”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS was continuing to debrief the source.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p><b>620. </b> The Butler Report concluded that the reports received in 2000 from this source, </p>
<p>suggesting that Iraq had recently produced biological agent were “seriously flawed”; and </p>
<p>that the grounds for the JIC Assessments drawing on these reports (see Section 4.1) “no </p>
<p>longer exist”.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>621. </b> The Butler Report stated that the source (Curve Ball) was “a refugee”, and that his </p>
<p>reporting had been:</p>
<p>“… treated with some caution by the JIC until it appeared to be confirmed by other </p>
<p>human intelligence. The subsequent need to withdraw a key part of the reporting </p>
<p>received through the liaison service arose as a result of misunderstandings, not </p>
<p>because of the source’s status.”</p>

<p><b>622. </b> The Butler Report also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>We consider that it was reasonable for the JIC to include in its </b></p>
<p><b>Assessments of March and September 2002 a reference to intelligence </b></p>
<p><b>reports on Iraq’s seeking mobile biological production facilities. But it </b></p>
<p><b>has emerged that the intelligence from the source, if it had been correctly </b></p>

<p>246</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All JIC Assessments about the production of biological warfare agents were </p>
<p>based on intelligence about mobile facilities.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>623. </b> The Butler Report stated that reports from two further sources continued to be </p>
<p>regarded as reliable, although it was “notable that their reports were less worrying than </p>
<p>the rest about Iraqi chemical and biological weapons capability”.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>624. </b> The Butler Report also stated that it had subsequently emerged that one of </p>
<p>the sources on which US assessments of Iraqi ownership of mobile biological agent </p>
<p>production facilities, including Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council </p>
<p>on 5 February 2003, had been based, a defector associated with the Iraqi National </p>
<p>Congress, had already been retracted before the US National Intelligence Estimate was </p>
<p>issued in October 2002.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> That report was not relied on by the UK.</p>

<p>250</p>
<p><b>626. </b> Mr Scarlett commented:</p>
<p>“This discredited report was sent to SIS but not issued by them so it was not </p>
<p>reflected in our classified assessments or in the dossier. There is one reference in </p>
<p>the dossier (the Executive Summary) to mobile ‘laboratories’. This was a general </p>
<p>term to cover mobile facilities and was not meant to be distinct from ‘production’ </p>

<p> There were concerns that the source had coached the sub-source; that the </p>

<p>“It would be drawn to … [Mr Straw’s and Mr Blair’s] attention. After the work of the </p>

<p>253</p>
<p> SIS and the DIS had reached a common position on the technical aspects </p>

<p>It was now not clear whether Curve Ball had ever told the liaison service whose </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Substantial UK and ISG efforts to collect significant collateral to conclude that </p>
<p>the system was BW-related had produced little that was concrete.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “irreconcilable inconsistencies” in Curve Ball’s claims for the </p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 23 DECEMBER 2004: ‘IRAQI WMD – A REVIEW OF JIC </p>
<p>JUDGEMENTS MADE IN 2002’</p>
<p><b>640. </b> At the request of the JIC, its Assessments of Iraqi WMD programmes in 2002 were </p>
<p>reviewed in December 2004.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>641. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion on 22 December of the draft paper on WMD </p>
<p>recorded that the points made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The paper had been produced at the JIC’s request and “reviewed the 2002 JIC </p>
<p>judgements of Iraqi WMD programmes, capabilities and intentions, in the light of </p>
<p>subsequent investigations, particularly the findings of the Iraq Survey Group”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC’s 2002 judgements on ballistic missiles had been “partially </p>
<p>substantiated”. Iraq “had developed missiles that exceeded the legal range </p>
<p>of 150km, and had designs for missiles with ranges up to 1000km. The paper </p>
<p>should not be so definitive in its conclusions. While our knowledge had been </p>
<p>considerably enhanced, the ISG itself acknowledged that more information may </p>
<p>yet come to light, and the picture was still incomplete”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The box on the intelligence base in the Assessment “should highlight the limited, </p>
<p>fragmentary nature of the intelligence, and the fact that much of the CBW </p>
<p>reporting had been withdrawn. But the paper should also point out that many of </p>
<p>the JIC’s judgements were informed by UNSCOM reporting, and even without </p>
<p>the withdrawn intelligence, would have remained reasonable judgements based </p>
<p>on what we knew at the time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC “would discuss lessons learned as part of following up the Butler </p>
<p>Review recommendations”.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>642. </b> The Assessment, issued on 23 December, made clear that it was not examining </p>
<p>the process through which assessments and judgements were made or attempting </p>
<p>to analyse the findings of the ISG in detail.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> The ISG findings provided “a baseline </p>
<p>against which to compare the pre-conflict JIC Assessments”. The ISG had “considerably </p>
<p>enhanced” the UK’s knowledge, but it had “acknowledged” that its findings were “by no </p>
<p>means definitive and new information may yet come to light”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>643. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The ISG judged that Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq’s WMD capability, but only </p>
<p>after sanctions were removed and the economy had stabilised. He aspired to </p>
<p>develop a nuclear capability in an incremental fashion, and intended to focus on </p>
<p>ballistic missile and tactical warfare capabilities. The ISG found that Iran was the </p>
<p>prime motivator for this policy, with a secondary requirement to balance Israel and </p>
<p>have influence in the Arab world.”</p>
<p><b>644. </b> Against that background, and validation work on the intelligence on which its </p>
<p>judgements had been based, the JIC reviewed its 2002 Assessments of Iraq’s activities:</p>
<p>“<b>Iraq is pursuing a nuclear weapons programme. But it will not be able to </b></p>
<p><b>indigenously produce a nuclear weapon while sanctions remain in place, </b></p>
<p><b>unless suitable fissile material is purchased from abroad</b>” (CIG Assessment, </p>
<p>15 March 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The judgement “was wrong in that Iraq was not pursuing a nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme, but correct on Iraq’s nuclear ambitions and its inability to </p>
<p>produce a nuclear weapon under sanctions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG found no indigenous nuclear production capability or a </p>
<p>reconstitution of effort to produce nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It did find evidence of efforts to preserve nuclear related intellectual </p>
<p>capabilities post 1991, with the probable intention of restarting a nuclear </p>
<p>programme once sanctions ended …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence dated June 2002 identified Iraqi interest in seeking uranium ore </p>
<p>from Niger. The ISG has contested this, but it has not been possible for the </p>
<p>UK to share the relevant intelligence […] This intelligence stands.”</p>
<p>“<b>Iraq retains up to 20 Al Hussein ballistic missiles</b>” (CIG Assessment, </p>
<p>15 March 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The judgement had “not been substantiated”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG judges that Iraq probably did not retain any SCUD-variant missiles </p>
<p>after 1991 …”</p>
<p>“<b>Iraq has begun development of medium range ballistic missiles over 1000km</b>” </p>
<p>(CIG Assessment, 15 March 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The judgement “had been partly substantiated: the ISG found that Iraq had </p>
<p>authorised its scientists to develop missiles with ranges in excess of … </p>
<p>150km … and had designs for missiles with ranges up to 1000km”.</p>
<p>“<b>Iraq may retain some stocks of chemical agents … Iraq could produce </b></p>
<p><b>significant quantities of mustard within weeks, significant quantities of sarin </b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>403</p>
<p><b>and VX within months, and in the case of VX may already have done so</b>” </p>
<p>(CIG Assessment, 15 March 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Although a capability to produce some agents probably existed, this </p>
<p>judgement has not been substantiated.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG judged that by 2003 Iraq probably had a capability to produce large </p>
<p>quantities of mustard within three to six months. Saddam never abandoned </p>
<p>his intention to resume a CW effort.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [T]he Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS) may have maintained covert </p>
<p>laboratories … though this probably reflected requirements for small-scale </p>
<p>operations by intelligence services and special forces, particularly for use </p>
<p>against internal dissent.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG judged that Iraq unilaterally destroyed its undeclared CW stockpile </p>
<p>in 1991, although a small number of weapons either escaped destruction or </p>
<p>suffered only partial damage.”</p>
<p><b>“Iraq currently has available, either from pre-Gulf war stocks, or more recent </b></p>
<p><b>production, a number of biological agents … Iraq could produce more of these </b></p>
<p><b>biological agents within days”</b> (CIG Assessment, 15 March 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG found no direct evidence of a BW programme after 1996. It </p>
<p>concluded, however, that Saddam probably intended to resume a BW </p>
<p>programme if the opportunity arose.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG found that Iraq had dual-use facilities which could have allowed </p>
<p>BW production to resume, but not within the timeframe judged by the JIC, </p>
<p>and found no evidence that production had been activated.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “judgements on Iraq’s ability to produce biological agent within days </p>
<p>were based on reporting of a TPS [transportable production system] which </p>
<p>has been subsequently withdrawn, and evidence (largely imagery) of the </p>
<p>refurbishment of a facility involved in BW research and production before the </p>
<p>first Gulf war. While acknowledging the possibility that a TPS capability did </p>
<p>exist, the ISG uncovered no evidence of such systems.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… the IIS may have had a series of small laboratories conducting small </p>
<p>scale BW work … The ISG was not able to establish the full scope and </p>
<p>nature of the laboratory work.”</p>
<p>“<b>Recent intelligence indicates that production of chemical and biological </b></p>
<p><b>weapons is taking place</b>” (JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ISG found that, while there were no credible indications that Baghdad </p>
<p>resumed production of chemical munitions post-1991, Iraq did conserve </p>
<p>intellectual CW capability, and enhanced its chemical infrastructure in </p>
<p>the mid-1990s.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>404</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reporting on which the assessment was based had “not been </p>
<p>subsequently substantiated by the ISG”.</p>
<p>“<b>Intelligence [also] indicates that chemical and biological munitions could be </b></p>
<p><b>with military units and ready for firing within 20-45 minutes</b>”<b> </b>(JIC Assessment, </p>
<p>9 September 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reporting had been withdrawn.</p>
<p>“<b>Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is </b></p>
<p><b>prepared to use it</b>” (JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002).</p>
<p>“<b>Saddam has already taken the decision that all resources, including CBW, be </b></p>
<p><b>used to defend the regime from attack. One report states that Saddam would </b></p>
<p><b>not use CBW during the initial phase of any military campaign, but would use </b></p>
<p><b>CBW once a ground invasion of Iraq has begun</b>” (paragraph 4, JIC Assessment, </p>
<p>9 September 2002).</p>
<p>“<b>Intelligence indicates that Saddam has identified Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, </b></p>
<p><b>Israel and Kuwait as targets</b>” (paragraph 6, JIC Assessment, 9 September 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reporting specifically referred to in paragraph 4 had been withdrawn; </p>
<p>as had the report on which paragraph 6 was based. “However, other </p>
<p>intelligence on Iraqi CBW programmes and activities, and on Israel and </p>
<p>Kuwait as possible targets, supported the Key Judgement and elements of </p>
<p>the detail quoted.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG findings did “not support the JIC judgement that Saddam would use </p>
<p>all resources, including CBW”.</p>
<p>“<b>Saddam … might use CBW … against coalition forces, neighbouring </b></p>
<p><b>states and his own people. Israel could be his first target</b>” (JIC Assessment, </p>
<p>6 December 2002).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Based on Iraq’s actions pre-1991 and during the first Gulf Conflict, the </p>
<p>judgement would have remained a reasonable one although reporting </p>
<p>which had been used in compiling the Assessment had subsequently been </p>
<p>withdrawn.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An Assessments Staff Intelligence Update on 27 November 2002 referred to </p>
<p>recent intelligence that Saddam Hussein had reiterated his intention to use </p>
<p>CBW to defend his regime “if allied forces approached Baghdad, if Basra, </p>
<p>Kirkuk or Mosul fell to Allied control, or if Iraqi units rebelled”. He “would wait </p>
<p>and see how neighbouring countries reacted to an allied attack, and whether </p>
<p>they allowed their territory to be used by Allied forces, before deciding </p>
<p>whether to use CBW against them”. His initial targets would be “Israel, </p>
<p>Kuwait and Jordan”. That reporting was withdrawn.</p>

<p><b>645. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The JIC’s judgements on Iraq’s production, retention and the availability of chemical </p>
<p>and biological agents in 2002/3 cannot currently be substantiated.”</p>
<p>JIC DISCUSSION, 9 FEBRUARY 2006</p>
<p><b>646. </b> In an “open discussion” of the lessons learned on Iraq in the JIC on 9 February </p>
<p>2006, the minutes record that the following points were made:</p>
<p>“i. the more important a subject became, the more rigorously checks and balances </p>
<p>needed to be applied to JIC product;</p>
<p>ii. peer review of work was vital for some, but not all Assessments. This was </p>
<p>particularly so when, in fast changing situations, the JIC was subject to an upward </p>
<p>pressure of increased intelligence flow and a downward pressure of demand from </p>
<p>senior readers; and</p>
<p>iii. it was vital that the knowledge base within the Assessments Staff was not allowed </p>
<p>to atrophy in lower priority subject areas …”</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>Reliability of intelligence</b></p>
<p><b>647.  Iraq was undoubtedly a difficult intelligence target and the UK had no </b></p>
<p><b>sources of human intelligence with reliable first-hand knowledge of Iraq’s WMD </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities or Saddam Hussein’s intentions.</b></p>
<p><b>648. </b> The ISC stated that Iraq was a hard target but SIS “successfully ran a number of </p>
<p>agents against Iraq and Saddam’s regime” who “provided intelligence over a wide range </p>
<p>of topics, although the SIS acknowledged that coverage on some subjects was stronger </p>
<p>than on others”.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>649. </b> The ISC described the SIS process of issuing intelligence reports in the </p>
<p>following terms:</p>
<p>“The SIS collects human intelligence (HUMINT) when agents, who can also be </p>
<p>known as sources, report back to their case officer. Sources either operate on </p>
<p>their own or quote a sub-source, who may be quoting another sub-source of their </p>
<p>own. After a meeting or communication between agent and [SIS] case officer, the </p>
<p>information is checked by the SIS who, after consulting experts as necessary, issue </p>
<p>an intelligence report. This report contains the information provided by the agent </p>
<p>(who by definition is the single source for the information) and an assessment </p>
<p>of the reliability of the agent and any sub-sources, as appropriate, together with </p>
<p>SIS comments. The SIS comments will refer the reader of the report to any other </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>intelligence that either confirms or conflicts with the information provided by the </p>
<p>agent and will put the report in context where required. This is to ensure that the </p>
<p>reader is able to make the best judgement on the veracity of the intelligence.”</p>
<p>263</p>
<p><b>650. </b> Addressing comments “about the unreliability of ‘single-source reporting’”, </p>
<p>the ISC added:</p>
<p>“Some … intelligence that agents produce cannot be verified or corroborated </p>
<p>by intelligence from other sources. The professional judgement of the agent’s </p>
<p>reliability is based on all that is known about the agent and their circumstances, </p>
<p>including the reliability of information that can be verified. It is possible to recruit </p>
<p>a reliable agent with exceptional access to high-grade intelligence. Examples … </p>
<p>are amongst the most valuable agents that the UK has ever had. Each was the </p>
<p>origin of ‘single-source’ reporting from SIS. For much of the reporting there was no </p>
<p>collateral from other sources.”</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>651. </b> The Butler Report stated:</p>
<p><b>“Validation of human intelligence sources after the war has thrown doubt </b></p>
<p><b>on a high proportion of those sources and of their reports, and hence on the </b></p>
<p><b>quality of the intelligence assessments received by Ministers and officials in </b></p>
<p><b>the period from summer 2002 to the outbreak of hostilities. Of the main human </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence sources described above:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>One SIS main source reported authoritatively on some issues, but on </b></p>
<p><b>others was passing on what he had heard within his circle.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Reporting from a sub-source to a second SIS main source that was </b></p>
<p><b>important to JIC assessments on Iraqi possession of chemical and </b></p>
<p><b>biological weapons must be open to doubt.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Reports from a third SIS main source have been withdrawn as </b></p>
<p><b>unreliable.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Reports from two further SIS main sources continue to be regarded </b></p>
<p><b>as reliable, although it is notable that their reports were less worrying </b></p>
<p><b>than the rest about Iraqi chemical and biological weapons capabilities.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Reports received from a liaison service on Iraqi production of </b></p>
<p><b>biological agent were seriously flawed, so that the grounds for JIC </b></p>

<p><b>652. </b> In its consideration of the reasons why “such a high proportion of the human </p>
<p>intelligence reports should have been withdrawn or subsequently be subject to doubt”, </p>
<p>the Report’s conclusions included:</p>
<p>“…<b> the length of the reporting chains</b>. Even when there were sources who were </p>
<p>shown to be reliable in some areas of reporting … in other areas … where they did </p>
<p>not have direct knowledge [they had] to draw on sub-sources or sub-sub-sources. </p>
<p>This was the case with the first of the two dominant sources [in the previous </p>
<p>paragraph].</p>
<p>“…<b> agents who were known to be reliable were asked to report on issues </b></p>
<p><b>going well beyond their usual territory</b>, leading to intelligence reports which were </p>
<p>more speculative than they would have provided on their own specialisms. We </p>
<p>believe this to have been the case with some aspects of the reporting of the second </p>
<p>of the two dominant sources.</p>
<p>“… because of the scarcity of sources and the urgent requirement for intelligence, </p>
<p>more credence was given to untried agents than would normally be the case. This </p>
<p>was the case with the report received between the JIC assessment of 9 September </p>
<p>2002 and the publication of the Government’s dossier in September 2002.”</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>653. </b> Asked about the difficulty of obtaining intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction programmes and capabilities, Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… when we are talking about the nuclear or chemical or biological or missile </p>
<p>programmes, we are talking about the most secret parts of what is already a highly </p>
<p>secretive state. We are talking about secret parts which are highly compartmented. </p>
<p>So you might achieve access to somebody who knows a lot about a particular … </p>
<p>programme, but by definition they are not going to have a broader picture.</p>
<p>“So you need a lot of such sources at a ground level to really get detailed </p>
<p>information about the programme. And, of course, with WMD you have … dual-use, </p>
<p>where it is very difficult to interpret any information or intelligence that you acquire as </p>
<p>to whether it is relevant to the programmes …”</p>
<p>267</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Asked about intelligence on the thinking of the leadership and military </p>
<p>commanders, Sir John stated:</p>
<p>“They were both very difficult … [W]e did have … some insight, we believed into the </p>
<p>thinking of the leadership and the work done subsequently in Iraq after the conflict </p>
<p>by the Iraq Survey Group would suggest that some of those insights were not far </p>
<p>off reality.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>408</p>
<p>“The problem was … that … this was a highly autocratic state, where almost </p>
<p>everybody revolved around the person, the thinking the behaviour and whims of the </p>
<p>leader. So it was what was going on in his mind which was critical, and that was very </p>
<p>difficult to fathom. And by his [Saddam Hussein’s] nature such a society generates, </p>
<p>deliberately or not, obfuscation and uncertainty. Nobody quite knows what about </p>
<p>what. There is a great deal of uncertainty of knowledge.</p>
<p>“So an individual, maybe a very senior military or civilian commander who you would </p>
<p>normally expect to have quite a confident view of a particular issue or capability … </p>
<p>might not … might say … I don’t know about this, but … a friend who does … tells </p>
<p>me … and you wouldn’t really know whether that was true or not.”</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Sir John subsequently told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… taken overall, I think as of mid-March 2003 … I think we said five lines [of </p>
<p>HUMINT] by that stage … [T]hat was a general statement which we were given by </p>
<p>the agency [SIS]. It wasn’t something that reflected research and real knowledge on </p>
<p>our part.”</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>656. </b> SIS1 told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think there was a sense in Iraq where the leader wished to convey to a fearful </p>
<p>regime and the people that he was powerful, that he had things up his sleeve, and </p>
<p>that those who were responsible for various programmes wanted to convince the </p>
<p>leader that work was continuing and that there were capabilities. It was not a well </p>
<p>organised place. It was extremely repressive.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“And it was corrupt. So people told people up and down what they wanted to hear, </p>
<p>and things which suited their ends.”</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>657. </b> The Inquiry asked SIS1 whether SIS sources and Iraqis in direct contact, for </p>
<p>example, with the UN and Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who were saying, “we don’t have </p>
<p>anything”, were telling the truth as they knew it then, or whether he thought some of </p>
<p>them did suspect they had something but that was the party line. SIS1 replied:</p>
<p><b>“</b>Many of them believed they had it, and in a way that was part of the picture that we </p>
<p>were getting […].</p>
<p>271</p>
<p><b>658. </b> Asked whether he thought there were any lessons, SIS1 observed, “we based a lot </p>

<p>nuclear, chemical, biological or ballistic missile programmes.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Sir David Omand told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think there were certainly people in the intelligence community, and there are still </p>
<p>some, who believe that something will turn up in Syria, and I am certainly not going </p>
<p>to break my own rules and say categorically that won’t happen. We could all still be </p>
<p>surprised. But there was a sense in which, because of past successes – very, very </p>
<p>considerable successes supporting this Government, that SIS overpromised and </p>
<p>underdelivered, and when that became clear that the intelligence was very hard to </p>
<p>find … they really were having to bust a gut to generate the intelligence.</p>
<p>“I think the Butler Committee really uncovered that the trade craft at that point </p>
<p>wasn’t as good as it should have been for validation … that’s one of the background </p>
<p>reasons why people were very unwilling to actually conclude: no … we may have </p>
<p>miscalculated, or misassessed this.”</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>A LESSON LEARNED?</p>
<p><b>661. </b> As the current version of <i>National Intelligence Machinery </i>explains, JIC </p>
<p>Assessments put intelligence in the context of wider knowledge available and past </p>
<p>judgements and historic evidence.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> They also need to try to understand, drawing on </p>
<p>all sources at their disposal, the motivations and thinking of the intelligence targets </p>
<p>and sources.</p>
<p><b>662. </b> Reflecting the findings and recommendations of the Butler Review in relation to the </p>
<p>nature of intelligence and the way in which it was used before the conflict in 2003, the </p>
<p>document also states:</p>
<p>“Intelligence … may by its nature be fragmentary or incomplete. It needs to be </p>
<p>analysed in order to identify significant facts, and then evaluated in respect of the </p>
<p>reliability of the information in order to allow a judgement to be made about the </p>
<p>weight to be given to it before circulation either as single source reports or collated </p>
<p>and integrated with other material as assessments.</p>
<p>“SIS and GCHQ evaluate and circulate mainly single source intelligence. The </p>
<p>Security Service also circulates single source intelligence although its primary </p>
<p>product is assessed intelligence. Defence Intelligence produces mainly assessed </p>
<p>reports on an all-source basis …</p>

<p>“Assessment should put intelligence into a sensible real-world context and identify </p>
<p>elements that can inform policy-making. Evaluation, analysis and assessment thus </p>

<p>276</p>
<p><b>663. </b> The Cabinet Office document also states:</p>
<p>“Intelligence collected by the three [intelligence] Agencies is passed directly in </p>
<p>the form of reports to customer departments in Government, where it informs and </p>
<p>assists decision-making. It contributes with other sources of information to threat </p>

<p>277</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>664.  The core construct that Saddam Hussein’s regime retained chemical and </b></p>
<p><b>biological warfare capabilities, was determined to preserve and if possible </b></p>
<p><b>enhance its capabilities, including at some point in the future a nuclear capability, </b></p>
<p><b>and was pursuing an active policy of deception and concealment, underpinned </b></p>
<p><b>the UK Government position that Iraq was a threat that had to be dealt with and it </b></p>
<p><b>needed to disarm or be disarmed.</b></p>
<p><b>665.  That remained the case up to and beyond the decision to invade Iraq in </b></p>
<p><b>March 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>666. </b> As the<b> </b>Report of the <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> (the </p>

<p>“<b>Intelligence on Iraqi nuclear, biological, chemical and nuclear programmes </b></p>
<p><b>was used in support of the execution</b> of … [Government] policy on Iraq for three </p>
<p>main purposes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>To inform planning for a military campaign</b> if that should be necessary, in </p>
<p>particular in relation to unconventional weapons, for providing the necessary </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>To obtain and provide information to United Nations inspectors</b> about </p>
<p>the likely locations of weapons and programmes which contravened the </p>
<p>terms of United Nations Security Council resolutions.”</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>667.  From October 2002 onwards, the JIC focused on two main themes:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s attitude to the return of the inspectors and, from 8 November, its </b></p>
<p><b>compliance with the specific obligations imposed by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s options, diplomatic and military, including the possible use </b></p>
<p><b>of chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles against </b></p>
<p><b>Coalition Forces or countries in the region in either pre-emptive attacks </b></p>
<p><b>or in response to a military attack.</b></p>
<p><b>668.  The way in which the assessments and intelligence on Iraq’s WMD were used </b></p>
<p><b>in pursuit of the UK’s strategy towards Iraq is considered in Section 3.</b></p>
<p><b>669.  In its Assessment of 18 December, the JIC made the judgements in the </b></p>
<p><b>UK Government September dossier part of the test for Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>670.  The judgements about Iraq’s capabilities and intentions relied heavily on </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s past behaviour being a reliable indicator of its current and future actions.</b></p>
<p><b>671.  There was no consideration of whether, faced with the prospect of a US-led </b></p>
<p><b>invasion, Saddam Hussein had taken a different position.</b></p>
<p><b>672. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote on 30 January 2003 that Saddam Hussein had “followed </p>
<p>essentially the same strategy and tactics as during the 1990s”.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>673. </b> Mr Scarlett told No.10 on 17 March that the JIC was clear that Iraq possessed </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons, the means to deliver them, and the capacity to </p>
<p>produce them.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> He stated that the starting point for those judgements was the </p>
<p>“knowledge of Iraq’s past WMD programmes” which demonstrated “not only </p>
<p>large-scale possession of these weapons, and the readiness to use them, but </p>
<p>also Saddam’s determination to retain WMD”.</p>
<p><b>674.  The absence of evidence of proscribed programmes and materials relating </b></p>
<p><b>to the production or delivery of chemical, biological or nuclear weapons was </b></p>
<p><b>attributed to Iraq’s ability to conceal its activities and deceive the inspectors and </b></p>
<p><b>the difficulties which it had been anticipated the inspectors would encounter.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>675. </b> Many of Iraq’s perceived capabilities, such as relatively small, transportable </p>
<p>or mobile facilities to produce chemical and biological agents or documentation left </p>
<p>over from past programmes, were seen as likely to be difficult to find in a country the </p>
<p>size of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>676. </b> The JIC Assessment of 11 October 2002 stated that a good intelligence flow from </p>
<p>inside Iraq, supporting tougher inspections, would be “central to success”.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>677. </b> On 30 January 2003, Mr Scarlett wrote that it was odd that the Iraqi regime did </p>
<p>not appear “to be worried about the obvious risk of leaks from the thousands of people </p>
<p>aware of this concealment activity”.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett attributed that success to the “brutal </p>
<p>discipline” of the regime.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Mr Scarlett stated that he continued:</p>
<p>“… to be struck by the regime’s ability to conduct complex surveillance and </p>
<p>deception operations without unforced errors or major slip ups. Co-ordinating the </p>
<p>dispersal of materials and associated documentation around the country and fielding </p>
<p>surprise UNMOVIC and IAEA visits to hundreds of sites in a few weeks is a complex </p>
<p>undertaking and evidence of the regime’s continuing grip on the population at least </p>
<p>of central Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>679.  A key element of the Assessments was the reporting and intelligence on </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s intentions to conceal its activities, deceive the inspectors and obstruct the </b></p>
<p><b>conduct of inspections, particularly Iraq’s attitudes to preventing interviews with </b></p>
<p><b>officials who were identified as associated with its proscribed programmes or who </b></p>
<p><b>had been involved in Iraq’s unilateral destruction of its weapons and facilities.</b></p>
<p><b>680.  The large number of intelligence reports about Iraq’s activities were </b></p>
<p><b>interpreted from the perspective that Iraq’s objectives were to conceal its </b></p>
<p><b>programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>681. </b> For instance, reporting in late November 2002 that Saddam Hussein was confident </p>
<p>that inspectors would not find anything was interpreted as confidence that Iraq’s policy of </p>
<p>concealment would work, not as an indication that there was nothing to find.</p>
<p><b>682. </b> In his minute to Sir David Manning of 17 March 2003, Mr Scarlett described </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s failure to uncover significant chemical and biological weapons as </p>
<p>“disappointing”, but “not wholly unexpected”.</p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>413</p>
<p><b>683. </b> Intelligence of 17 March 2003, that Saddam Hussein had not asked about </p>
<p>chemical weapons or ordered their reassembly, was viewed in the context of a policy </p>
<p>of concealment and the absence of chemical warheads for missiles rather than as an </p>
<p>absence of the capability.</p>
<p><b>684.  Similarly, Iraq’s actions were consistently interpreted as indicative of deceit.</b></p>
<p><b>685. </b> The ability to interview scientists and engineers involved in past programmes or </p>
<p>involved in Iraq’s unilateral destruction of weapons and materials was increasingly seen </p>
<p>as the key to identifying Iraq’s deception and the litmus test for Iraqi co-operation.</p>
<p><b>686. </b> As Mr Straw told the FAC on 4 March 2003, interviews would “expose the regime’s </p>
<p>deception and its stockpile of weapons”.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>687. </b> The Government’s focus on this issue intensified in early 2003 with the failure to </p>
<p>find evidence of Iraqi chemical, biological and nuclear programmes.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> The decision to include provision for interviews inside and outside Iraq in resolution </p>
<p>1441 (2002), and the subsequent discussion about the conduct of such interviews, are </p>
<p>described in Sections 3.5 to 3.8. These Sections show the UK recognised that a policy </p>
<p>of interviews outside Iraq would be difficult to implement.</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Dr Blix had initially expressed reservations about interviewing Iraqi personnel </p>
<p>outside Iraq but on 7 March he told the Security Council that he would be requesting </p>
<p>such interviews “shortly”.</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… was deliberately concealing documentation, and … he was deliberately not </p>
<p>allowing people to be interviewed properly.</p>
<p>“In December 2002 … we received information, and this information remains valid, </p>
<p>that Saddam called together his key people and said that anybody who agreed to an </p>
<p>interview outside of Iraq was to be treated a spy.”</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… the reason for that is very simple, and it emerges from the Iraq Survey Group </p>
<p>report. He retained full intent to restart his programme, and, therefore, it was very </p>
<p>important for him that interviews did not take place, because the interviews with </p>
<p>senior regime members were precisely what would have indicated the concealment </p>
<p>and the intent.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>692. </b> There were, of course, other reasons why an insecure regime, convinced that </p>
<p>past inspections had been used for espionage and facing military attack, would want to </p>
<p>limit the conversations key personnel were having with foreigners while military action </p>
<p>was threatened.</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Asked whether the intelligence on Saddam Hussein’s strategy for dealing with </p>
<p>inspections reinforced the view that there really was something to hide, SIS1 told </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think they looked guilty as hell. In a way it’s a sort of spectacular miscalculation, </p>
<p>and I think it’s partly because of their paranoia about being open to hostile scrutiny, </p>
<p>and partly because they had stuff to hide, but not necessarily what the inspectors </p>
<p>were looking for. From military secrets to, as I mentioned before, embargo breaking, </p>
<p>but on things that would not have been prohibited as part of the programmes.</p>
<p>“So there was quite a lot of evidence of the unco-operative and mule-headed and </p>
<p>crude efforts to make the inspectors’ life more difficult. Demonstrations, car crash, </p>
<p>you know, traffic problems and heavy surveillance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Yes, and it seemed to form part of a consistent picture, allowing for the fact that </p>
<p>there was a certain assumption in the first place about what that picture was.”</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>694.  From early 2003, the Government drew heavily on the intelligence reporting </b></p>
<p><b>of Iraq’s activities to deceive and obstruct the inspectors to illustrate its </b></p>
<p><b>conclusion that Iraq had no intention of complying with the obligations imposed </b></p>
<p><b>in resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>695.  The Government also emphasised the reliability of the reporting.</b></p>
<p><b>696. </b> The briefing provided by SIS1 for Mr Blair to use in his interview on <i>BBC</i>’s<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Breakfast with Frost</i> programme on 26 January was one instance. Much of the same </p>
<p>material was used in the No.10 dossier published on 3 February.</p>
<p><b>697. </b> Mr Straw set out similar arguments in his statement to the FAC on 4 March </p>
<p>in which he referred to an “elaborate screen of concealment based on intimidation </p>
<p>and deception”.</p>
<p><b>698. </b> In conversations with key allies and public statements by both Ministers and </p>
<p>senior officials, including Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s presentations to the Security Council </p>
<p>in February and March 2003 and the visit by Sir David Manning and Mr Scarlett to </p>
<p>Mexico and Chile which are described briefly in this Section, the UK emphasised that its </p>
<p>intelligence on Iraq’s capabilities and intentions was reliable and well sourced.</p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>415</p>
<p><b>699. </b> The Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>“… there was throughout this period a substantial volume of intelligence reports </p>
<p>on Iraqi deceptions and concealment activities, coupled with – as UNMOVIC </p>
<p>reported – a lack of active co-operation with the inspectors. There were also </p>
<p>the UNMOVIC discoveries … Even so, we are surprised that neither policy-</p>
<p>makers nor the intelligence community … conducted a formal re-evaluation of </p>
<p>the quality of the intelligence and hence of the assessments made on it. We </p>
<p>have noted in departmental papers expressions of concern about the impact on </p>
<p>public and international opinion of the lack of strong evidence of Iraqi violation </p>
<p>of its disarmament obligations. But those involved seem to have operated on </p>
<p>the presumption that the intelligence was right, and that it was because of the </p>
<p>combination of Iraqi concealment and deception activities and perceived UNMOVIC </p>
<p>weaknesses that such evidence was not found.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>700. </b> In his minute of 11 February issuing guidance on the use of intelligence in </p>
<p>CIC products, Sir David Omand pointed out that “the reputation of the intelligence </p>
<p>community” was “at risk” whenever intelligence material and judgements were “attributed </p>
<p>to the Government”.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>701. </b> The reputation of the Government was equally at risk whenever it used material </p>
<p>from the intelligence community as evidence in support of its policy.</p>
<p><b>702.  The JIC’s judgement from August 2002 until 19 March 2003 remained that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq might use chemical and biological weapons in response to a military attack.</b></p>
<p><b>703. </b> Despite the lack of firm intelligence about Iraqi plans, the JIC continued to judge </p>
<p>that Iraq might use chemical and biological weapons. The JIC did not, however, address </p>
<p>the tension between that judgement and its judgement that Saddam Hussein’s primary </p>
<p>objective was the survival of his regime.</p>
<p><b>704. </b> In addition, although the quantity of chemical and biological weapons and material </p>
<p>which was unaccounted for, or could have been produced, since 1998 was significant, </p>
<p>it was much less than Iraq had possessed in 1991 and would have been of limited utility </p>
<p>on the battlefield against the Coalition, as the evidence on military planning set out in </p>
<p>Sections 6.1 to 6.3 demonstrates.</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Iraq’s ability to use chemical or biological weapons to pose a threat to countries </p>
<p>in the region would have depended on having an effective means of delivery, which </p>
<p>was questionable.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p><b>706. </b> The JIC Assessment of 19 March 2003 recognised that Iraq’s ability to use </p>
<p>chemical or biological weapons was likely to be limited.</p>
<p><b>707.  Iraq’s statements that it had no weapons or programmes were dismissed as </b></p>
<p><b>further evidence of a strategy of denial.</b></p>
<p><b>708.  In addition, the extent to which the JIC’s judgements depended on inference </b></p>
<p><b>and interpretation of Iraq’s previous attitudes and behaviour was not recognised.</b></p>
<p><b>709.  At no stage was the hypothesis that Iraq might not have chemical, biological </b></p>
<p><b>or nuclear weapons or programmes identified and examined by either the JIC or </b></p>
<p><b>the policy community.</b></p>
<p><b>710.  After its 9 September 2002 Assessment, the JIC was not asked to review </b></p>
<p><b>its judgements on Iraq’s capabilities and programmes which underpinned UK </b></p>
<p><b>thinking. Nor did the JIC itself suggest such a review.</b></p>
<p><b>711.  As a result there was no formal reassessment of the JIC judgements, and </b></p>
<p><b>the 9 September Assessment and the 24 September dossier provided part of the </b></p>
<p><b>baseline for the UK Government’s view of Iraq’s capabilities and intentions on its </b></p>
<p><b>chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>712. </b> The inspections revealed in early 2003 that Iraq had undoubtedly been pursuing a </p>
<p>range of proscribed activities which it was keen to conceal, including enhancements to </p>
<p>its ballistic missile capabilities and procurement or attempted procurement of dual-use </p>
<p>items that could have had a use in the production of chemical and biological agents. </p>
<p>It also wanted to preserve its conventional capabilities.</p>
<p><b>713. </b> But the inspectors were also reporting that they had not found any evidence of </p>
<p>current chemical, biological or nuclear weapons programmes in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>714. </b> Dr Blix reminded Mr Blair on 6 February that UNSCOM had said material was </p>
<p>unaccounted for, not that it was present in Iraq. He made the same point in his report to </p>
<p>the Security Council on 14 February, adding that if the material did not exist, “credible </p>
<p>evidence to that effect” was needed.</p>
<p><b>715. </b> The dismissal of Iraq’s persistent denials that it had retained weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction has to be considered in the context that past Iraqi statements had often </p>
<p>been shown to be untrue. The evidence of other proscribed activities may have </p>
<p>served to reinforce confidence in the intelligence and in UK assessments about Iraq’s </p>
<p>other activities.</p>
<p><b>716.  Given the weight which rested on the JIC’s judgements about</b> <b>Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>possession of WMD and its future intent for the decision in March that military </b></p>
<p><b>action should, if necessary, be taken to disarm Iraq, a formal reassessment of the </b></p>
<p><b>JIC’s judgements should have taken place.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>417</p>
<p><b>717.  This might have been prompted by Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>on 14 February 2003, which demonstrated the developing divergence between the </b></p>
<p><b>assessments presented by the US and the UK. Dr Blix’s report of 7 March, which </b></p>
<p><b>challenged the view that Iraqi behaviour was preventing UNMOVIC from carrying </b></p>
<p><b>out its tasks, should certainly have prompted a review.</b></p>
<p><b>718. </b> Mr Scarlett and Sir David Manning discussed the JIC’s priorities and the need to </p>
<p>retest the standing judgements on 3 January 2003.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> They did not include Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes and its intentions to use WMD.</p>
<p><b>719. </b> Sir David Manning rightly sought advice on the strength of the evidence showing </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s possession of WMD, to which Mr Scarlett responded on 17 March.</p>
<p><b>720. </b> But as the Butler Report stated, after the JIC’s initial assessment of Iraq’s </p>
<p>declaration on 18 December:</p>
<p>“Thereafter, despite its importance to the determination of whether Iraq was </p>
<p>in further material breach of its disarmament obligations … the JIC made no </p>
<p>further assessment.”</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>721. </b> The Butler Report added:</p>
<p>“The JIC’s attitude will have been shaped by intelligence received in late-November </p>
<p>that Iraq’s declaration would omit references to its prohibited programmes and more </p>
<p>generally would seek to overload the United Nations with information. Predictions on </p>
<p>the extreme length and nature of the declaration were subsequently borne out. Even </p>
<p>so, we find it odd that … the JIC produced no further assessment.”</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>722. </b> Mr Tim Dowse, Head of the FCO Non-Proliferation Department, from January 2001 </p>
<p>to November 2003, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… from the end of 2002 … almost up until the invasion, we were getting a fairly </p>
<p>steady stream of quite sort of low level intelligence, operational reports, reports </p>
<p>coming from military sources … about Iraqi concealment activities … which … had </p>
<p>we subjected them to the JIC analytical process might have been regarded as not </p>
<p>very strong. Collectively … every few days getting more of this rather confirmed us </p>
<p>in our view that, if the inspections could be pursued with a little more vigour, a little </p>
<p>more skill, that things were there and could be found.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>723. </b> Asked whether there had been a challenge to the intelligence and if he was </p>
<p>absolutely sure that there was not another way of explaining the material, Mr Blair told </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“When you are Prime Minister and the JIC is giving this information, you have got to </p>
<p>rely on the people doing it, with experience and with commitment and integrity, as </p>
<p>they do. Of course, now, with the benefit of hindsight, we look back on the situation </p>
<p>differently.”</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>724. </b> Responding to a question about why there might have been an unwillingness to </p>
<p>conclude the intelligence had been misassessed, Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think … the situation in January and February 2003, when UNMOVIC were not </p>
<p>finding things, and so the reaction might have been: well, why is that? But the </p>
<p>reaction was: well it’s there. This just goes to show that UNMOVIC aren’t much use </p>
<p>and we will find it.”</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Mr Miller acknowledged that the 18 December 2002 Assessment of the Iraqi </p>
<p>declaration was “rooted in the intelligence view about the extent of his possession and </p>
<p>continuing programme”.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> If the Assessments Staff had known then what they knew </p>
<p>about the reliability of the intelligence reporting in July 2004, Mr Miller thought “there </p>
<p>would still have been some serious reservations … but that they would have been less </p>
<p>pronounced than they were at the time.”</p>
<p><b>726. </b> Sir John Scarlett took a more cautious view, pointing out the nature of the </p>
<p>requirements on Iraq and its failure to address in the declaration that it had unilaterally </p>
<p>destroyed its agent stockpile in 1991 without telling anyone or that it had destroyed the </p>
<p>Al Hussein missiles in 1992. They had also said nothing about the work on missiles:</p>
<p>“So there would have been a whole series of points where the declaration would </p>
<p>have been found to be … not conforming with resolution 1441.”</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Sir John told the Inquiry that his:</p>
<p>“… own mindset … up until early March at least, was that intelligence was being </p>
<p>borne out by what was being found by UNMOVIC. My state of mind wasn’t: oh gosh, </p>
<p>UNMOVIC aren’t finding things, therefore there’s something big that is wrong.</p>
<p>“Now, if we had continued and had more time, and this hadn’t all come to an end in </p>
<p>the middle of March, of course that would have changed.”</p>

<p>4.3  |  Iraq WMD assessments, October 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>419</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Mr Miller added:</p>
<p>“… there was a flow of intelligence to the inspectors which in some cases … led to </p>
<p>discoveries … and in cases where it didn’t, it simply wasn’t possible for us to reach </p>
<p>a firm view on whether the deficiency was in the intelligence or in the ability to move </p>
<p>fast enough in Iraq to have uncovered what was said to have been concealed.”</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>729. </b> The problems were not confined to the UK. The US Senate Select Committee </p>
<p>on Intelligence report on the <i>U.S. Intelligence Community’s Prewar Intelligence </i></p>
<p><i>Assessments on Iraq</i>, published on 9 July 2004, concluded:</p>
<p>“The intelligence community suffered from a collective presumption that Iraq had </p>
<p>an active and growing WMD program. This “group think” led intelligence community </p>
<p>analysts, collectors and managers to both interpret ambiguous evidence as </p>
<p>conclusively indicative of a WMD program and to ignore or minimise evidence that </p>
<p>Iraq did not have active and expanding weapons of mass destruction programs. </p>
<p>This presumption was so strong that formal mechanisms established to challenge </p>
<p>assumptions and group think were not used.”</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>730.  In the context of the lessons from the preparation of the September 2002 </b></p>
<p><b>dossier, the Inquiry identified in Section 4.2 the benefits of separating the </b></p>
<p><b>responsibility for assessment of intelligence from the responsibility for setting out </b></p>
<p><b>the arguments in support of a policy.</b></p>
<p><b>731.  The evidence in this Section reinforces that lesson. It shows that the </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence and assessments made by the JIC about Iraq’s capabilities and </b></p>
<p><b>intent continued to be used to prepare briefing material to support Government </b></p>
<p><b>statements in a way which conveyed certainty without acknowledging the </b></p>
<p><b>limitations of the intelligence.</b></p>
<p><b>732. </b> In the context of its examination of the role of the JIC in the preparation of the </p>
<p>September 2002 dossier, the Butler Review commented:</p>
<p>“The JIC, with commendable motives, took responsibility for the dossier in order </p>
<p>that its content should properly reflect the judgements of the intelligence community. </p>
<p>They did their utmost to ensure that this standard was met. But this will have put a </p>
<p>strain on them in seeking to maintain their normal standards of neutral and objective </p>
<p>assessment. Intelligence assessment is necessarily based heavily on judgement, </p>
<p>relying on such material as intelligence has provided. It is not simply a matter of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>reporting this material but of presenting the judgements which flow from it to an </p>
<p>experienced readership. Explaining those judgements to a wider public audience is </p>
<p>a very different and difficult presentational task.”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>733. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir David Omand whether the involvement of Mr Scarlett and </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove, as part of Mr Blair’s circle of close advisers, had risked breaching </p>
<p>the distinction between provision of intelligence and the formulation of policy, and </p>
<p>whether they had become too involved in the making and selling of policy.</p>
<p><b>734. </b> Sir David Omand told the Inquiry that the “golden rule” for the Chairman of the </p>
<p>Joint Intelligence Committee should be that: “he would deliver the views of the Joint </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee, he would never venture a view on the policy even if asked”.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>735. </b> Asked if it had been difficult to maintain the separation between intelligence and </p>
<p>policy, Sir John Scarlett replied:</p>
<p>“I cannot recall worrying about this at the time in a deep way. Obviously I, we worried </p>
<p>about it because we understood that it was necessary to ensure that the public </p>
<p>assessment was consistent with what was being said in the classified assessments, </p>
<p>and so that discipline was very strong within us, and in ways that have been </p>
<p>discussed many times, we sought to protect ourselves against …”</p>
<p>303</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Sir John added:</p>
<p>“So I do not recall worrying about it in a deep way or in the sense that it was </p>
<p>something which I or we couldn’t control. It was something to which we had to pay </p>
<p>very close attention, both through the procedures and processes we followed, and </p>
<p>by the way we reached our judgments. But I never felt that I was not in control of the </p>
<p>process, and I have said that on quite a number of occasions.”</p>
<p><b>737.  The independence and impartiality of the JIC remains of the utmost </b></p>
<p><b>importance.</b></p>
<p><b>738. </b> As the FAC report in July 2003 pointed out, the late Sir Percy Cradock, Chairman </p>
<p>of the JIC from 1985 to 1992, wrote in his history of the JIC that:</p>
<p>“Ideally, intelligence and policy should be close but distinct. Too distinct and </p>
<p>assessments become an in-growing, self-regarding activity, producing little or no </p>
<p>work of interest to the decision-makers … Too close a link and policy begins to play </p>
<p>back on estimates, producing the answers the policy makers would like … The </p>

<p>analysts become courtiers, whereas their proper function is to report their findings </p>
<p>… without fear or favour. The best arrangement is intelligence and policy in separate </p>
<p>but adjoining rooms, with communicating doors and thin partition walls …”</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>739. </b> Mr Straw told the FAC in 2003:</p>
<p>“The reason why we have a Joint Intelligence Committee which is separate from the </p>
<p>intelligence agencies is precisely so that those who are obtaining the intelligence are </p>
<p>not then directly making the assessment upon it. That is one of the very important </p>
<p>strengths of our system compared with most other systems around the world.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>740. </b> The FAC endorsed those sentiments.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> It stated that the JIC has a “vital role </p>
<p>in safeguarding the independence and impartiality of intelligence”; and that the </p>
<p>“independence and impartiality of its own role” was “of the utmost importance”. </p>
<p>It recommended that Ministers should “bear in mind at all times the importance of </p>
<p>ensuring that the JIC is free of all political pressure”.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> In its response to the FAC, the Government stated:</p>
<p>“We agree. The JIC plays a crucial role in providing the Government with objective </p>
<p>Assessments on a range of issues of importance to national interests.”</p>
