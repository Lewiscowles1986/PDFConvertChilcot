<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Following the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, Mr Blair became increasingly </p>
<p>concerned about the risk that international terrorists might acquire and use weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction (WMD) and the threat that posed to the UK and its wider interests. </p>
<p>He was convinced that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those risks had to be dealt with; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was only one element of that wider problem, but the risk changed the way </p>
<p>the threat posed by Iraq should be viewed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had to be dealt with as a priority.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section of the report sets out the evidence relating to events leading up </p>
<p>to Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Crawford, the meeting itself, and the </p>
<p>subsequent statements in public and to Cabinet.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The UK’s assessments of Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </p>
<p>capabilities, its intent to preserve and enhance those capabilities, and the likelihood of </p>
<p>proliferation from Iraq, are addressed in Section 4.1. That Section also addresses the </p>
<p>initial preparation of a document for publication on WMD programmes of concern.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK continued to pursue implementation of the “smarter” economic sanctions </p>
<p>regime in the first months of 2002, but continuing divisions between Permanent </p>
<p>Members of the Security Council meant there was no agreement on the way forward.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In public statements at the end of February and in the first week of March 2002, Mr </p>
<p>Blair and Mr Straw set out the view that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At Cabinet on 7 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that no decisions had </p>
<p>been taken and Cabinet was not being asked to take decisions. Cabinet endorsed </p>
<p>the conclusion that Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes posed a </p>
<p>threat to peace and endorsed a strategy of engaging closely with the US Government </p>
<p>in order to shape policy and its presentation. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At Crawford, Mr Blair offered President Bush a partnership in dealing urgently with </p>
<p>the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. He proposed that the UK and the US should </p>
<p>pursue a strategy based on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the return of </p>
<p>weapons inspectors or face the consequences. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following his meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>to be confronted and brought back into compliance with the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The acceptance of the possibility that the UK might participate in a military invasion </p>
<p>of Iraq was a profound change in UK thinking. Although no decisions had been taken, </p>
<p>that became the basis for contingency planning in the months ahead.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>President Bush’s “axis of evil” speech and the UK response</b></p>
<p><b>4.  Addressing the potential threat from terrorists with weapons of mass </b></p>
<p><b>destruction, President Bush described Iraq in his State of the Union speech on </b></p>
<p><b>29 January as part of an “axis of evil”.</b></p>
<p><b>5.  The speech prompted a major public debate on both sides of the Atlantic about </b></p>
<p><b>policy towards Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> In his annual State of the Union speech on 29 January 2002 President Bush </p>
<p>described the regimes in North Korea and Iran as “sponsors of terrorism”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> He added </p>
<p>that Iraq had continued to:</p>
<p>“… flaunt its hostility towards America and to support terror … The Iraqi regime has </p>
<p>plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. </p>
<p>This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own </p>
<p>citizens … This is a regime that agreed to international inspections – then kicked out </p>
<p>the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilised world.”</p>
<p><b>7. </b> President Bush stated: </p>
<p>“States like these [North Korea, Iran and Iraq], and their terrorist allies, constitute an </p>
<p>axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. </p>
<p>“America will do what is necessary to ensure our nation’s security … We’ll be </p>
<p>deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on events while dangers gather. </p>
<p>I will not stand idly by, as perils draw closer and closer. The United States of America </p>
<p>will not permit the world’s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world’s </p>
<p>most destructive weapons. </p>
<p>“Our war on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign may not be </p>
<p>finished on our watch – yet it must be and it will be waged on our watch.” </p>
<p><b>8. </b> In his memoir President Bush wrote that the media had taken:</p>
<p>“… the line to mean that the three countries had formed an alliance. That missed the </p>
<p>point. The axis … was the link between Governments that pursued WMD and the </p>
<p>terrorists who could use those weapons. There was a larger point in the speech that </p>
<p>no one could miss. I was serious about dealing with Iraq.”</p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Dr. Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, wrote in 2011 that </p>
<p>President Bush’s phrase, an “axis of evil”, was “overdramatized”. She and the President </p>
<p>were “stunned” when the media focused almost exclusively on it: </p>
<p>“Since many people believed that we’d already decided to go to war against Iraq, </p>
<p>sinister interpretations suggested that we were preparing to use military force </p>
<p>against all three states. We had, for all intents and purposes, some believed, </p>
<p>declared war on North Korea, Iraq and Iran.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>10. </b> Dr Rice added that, in a speech the following day, and in media interviews, she had </p>
<p>sought to clarify what the President had meant:</p>
<p>“The President wouldn’t take any options off the table, but he’d said we’d work with </p>
<p>our friends to deal with the problem; diplomacy was the first line of defense. But, </p>
<p>admittedly, the harsh language suggested that negotiation was impossible. How </p>
<p>could you negotiate with members of an ‘axis of evil’?” </p>
<p><b>11.  From early 2002, there were increasing indications that key figures in the </b></p>
<p><b>US Administration were considering military action to achieve regime change </b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq and there was an emphasis on the potential nexus for the fusion of WMD </b></p>
<p><b>proliferation and terrorism.</b></p>
<p><b>12.  Mr Blair stated that regime change would be desirable. If Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>wanted to avoid war, he would need to agree to the return of inspectors. </b></p>
<p><b>13.  Mr Blair told President Bush on 6 February that he agreed on the importance </b></p>
<p><b>of sending a strong signal to the countries identified as an “axis of evil” that their </b></p>
<p><b>behaviour needed to change. </b></p>
<p><b>14. </b> At a meeting of the Overseas Sub-Committee of the Official Committee on Domestic </p>
<p>and International Terrorism (TIDO(O)) on 1 February 2002, chaired by Mr Stephen </p>
<p>Wright, FCO Deputy Under-Secretary Defence and Intelligence, the FCO reported </p>
<p>that US thinking about Phase 2 of the “War on Terrorism”, as reflected in President </p>
<p>Bush’s State of the Union address, was already under way and crystallising around two </p>
<p>concepts: the proliferation of WMD and counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Wright stated that the US appeared to be most concerned about the proliferation </p>
<p>of WMD to terrorist groups, and that lay at the heart of concerns about a number </p>
<p>of states including Iraq. The US saw Iraq increasingly as a WMD rather than a </p>
<p>counter-terrorism problem. UK officials thought that the interagency process would </p>
<p>probably result in a balanced approach. Military action was seen as a last resort. Action </p>
<p>against Iraq was not seen as imminent.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and the Head of the Overseas </p>
<p>and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), advised Mr Blair that a number of senior Americans, </p>
<p>both Republican and Democrat, were convinced that President Bush was determined on </p>
<p>war with Iraq; the doves in the US system were totally marginalised; it was impossible </p>
<p>to stand out against the jingoistic mood – people wanted war; taking on the Iraqs of </p>
<p>the international system was the best way of making sure that America would not be </p>
<p>surprised again.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> To avoid that, some Americans had urged that Europeans should </p>
<p>pursue a policy of tightening sanctions against Iraq, and getting an UNMOVIC (UN </p>
<p>Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission) and with teeth back on the ground </p>
<p>in Iraq. A former US military officer had suggested that the US would invade Iraq within </p>
<p>four or five months. Another American expressed doubt about whether Turkey would </p>
<p>support military action because of the risk of refugees flooding across its borders. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> Sir David Manning wrote that the “rhetoric has so far been running ahead of the </p>
<p>reality” in the US:</p>
<p>“The US military have probably been told to make contingency plans … But unless </p>
<p>we have been pretty comprehensively deceived … no decisions have yet been taken </p>
<p>on how or when to bring it [regime change] about.” </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Blair responded: </p>
<p>“… Yes it’s desirable but how? If we can sort out “how”, do it and this is the reason </p>
<p>Iraq is making overtures to Iran. To avoid war, Iraq [wd] need to let the inspectors </p>
<p>back in.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Lord Williams of Baglan, Special Adviser to Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, </p>
<p>from 2001 to 2005, told the Inquiry that he recalled that: </p>
<p>“By the opening months of 2002 it was becoming clearer that the Bush </p>
<p>Administration appeared intent on a more muscular approach on Iraq that did not </p>
<p>rule out military action. At the Davos meeting in January 2002 a US Senator had </p>
<p>told the NATO Secretary General George Robertson that President Bush was </p>
<p>determined on a war with Iraq and that it was ‘a cast iron certainty within the year’. </p>
<p>In reported remarks at the Munich security conference, in February the former NATO </p>
<p>commander General Wesley Clarke told interlocutors that he believed war was </p>
<p>inevitable.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> During a telephone call with President Bush on a range of issues on 6 February </p>
<p>2002, Mr Blair said that “whatever President Bush may have read in the media, he </p>

<p>391</p>
<p>agreed on the importance of sending a strong signal” to the countries identified as part </p>
<p>of an “axis of evil” that their behaviour needed to change.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>21.  FCO officials advised Mr Straw that, while the immediate US focus was on </b></p>
<p><b>getting a revised Goods Review List agreed by the deadline of 30 May, the signs </b></p>
<p><b>were that the US would pursue regime change. Pressing for implementation of a </b></p>
<p><b>tougher inspections regime could offer a potential alternative to military action. </b></p>
<p><b>If Saddam Hussein failed to co-operate there would be a stronger justification for </b></p>
<p><b>military action.</b></p>
<p><b>22. </b> Reporting on talks the previous week with the US, including progress in US talks </p>
<p>with Russia, Mr William Patey, Head of the FCO Middle East Department, advised </p>
<p>Mr Straw that:</p>
<p>“In the absence of any decisions on wider Iraq policy and the post-11 September </p>
<p>situation, the immediate US focus is on getting the Goods Review List (GRL) agreed </p>
<p>by 30 May deadline.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Patey also described clarification of resolution 1284 (1999) as “anathema to </p>
<p>the US”. It feared that would represent “a slippery slope towards a weaker inspections </p>
<p>regime”. Mr Patey added:</p>
<p>“As for the wider policy all the signs point to the US going for a regime change </p>
<p>option. But there does not appear to be a viable plan as yet and the time frame </p>
<p>remains uncertain. Cheney [Vice President Dick Cheney] is due to tour the Middle </p>
<p>East in mid-March and we would be surprised if any decisions were taken before </p>
<p>then. We have asked Washington for a further read-out of US thinking beyond State </p>
<p>Department.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> Reporting on talks with a senior French official, Mr Patey wrote that his reading of </p>
<p>US intentions was “the same as ours”. That appeared “to have produced a change in </p>
<p>French attitudes towards [resolution] 1284 and the prospects of clarification”. Security </p>
<p>Council “agreement on a tough inspections regime with unconditional access” was seen </p>
<p>“as the only realistic alternative to US military action”. The talks with French officials are </p>
<p>addressed in more detail later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Mr Patey concluded:</p>
<p>“If we can get agreement on a tough regime, this would represent a no-lose </p>
<p>situation. If the Iraqis continue to resist a tough inspections regime or let the </p>
<p>inspectors in then renege, the justification for any military action would be much </p>
<p>stronger. If, against all expectations, UNMOVIC were allowed to do their job this </p>
<p>would offer the best prospect of dealing with Saddam’s WMD.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr Alan Goulty, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, commented to </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Private Secretary:</p>
<p>“So far so good. But much will depend on how the US decide to pursue the regime </p>
<p>change option. It would be helpful if I and Mr Patey could be kept up to speed on </p>
<p>discussions with the US: hard to write contingency planning papers in ignorance of </p>
<p>the contingencies we are planning for.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>27. </b> In a letter to Mr Peter Westmacott, British Ambassador to Turkey, the following day, </p>
<p>Mr Goulty wrote:</p>
<p>“The reality is that there is deep scepticism in the US that any UN process can </p>
<p>deal seriously with Iraq’s WMD … The Iraqis have shown little interest in 1284/</p>
<p>suspension, believing it to be a way of extending sanctions indefinitely. But if we are </p>
<p>to offer an alternative to military action, both we and the French are convinced that </p>
<p>this will need to involve a tough inspections regime based on strict implementation </p>
<p>of existing resolutions. Events since 11 September have increased the chances </p>
<p>of reuniting the Security Council around such a proposition. Faced with a regime </p>
<p>threatening alternative, and Security Council unity, there is a slight chance Iraq </p>
<p>would allow unconditional inspections. This would make it difficult for the hawks in </p>
<p>Washington to go ahead with military action. If the Iraqis persist in their refusal then </p>
<p>the moral and legal basis for action would be improved. Either way we are in a better </p>
<p>position.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>28. </b> Mr Goulty concluded:</p>
<p>“We certainly need a clearer assessment of what the Americans are up to. But it is </p>
<p>obvious that there are some in Washington who would not accept yes for an answer. </p>
<p>Disillusionment with containment is widespread and the status quo is no longer an </p>
<p>option.”</p>
<p><b>29.  Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, saw President Bush’s </b></p>
<p><b>speech as a warning to regimes he saw as “especially dangerous”, which had </b></p>
<p><b>increased expectations of military action against Iraq. The hawks in Washington </b></p>
<p><b>felt that they had won the argument about the need for military action. The US </b></p>
<p><b>might want to issue an ultimatum on inspections but set the bar so high that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>would never comply. </b></p>
<p><b>30.  The US might seek UK endorsement for its vision by early March. </b></p>
<p><b>31.  Sir David Manning was assured by Dr Rice that no decisions would be taken </b></p>
<p><b>before the planned meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at Crawford in </b></p>
<p><b>early April.</b></p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>393</p>
<p><b>32. </b> On 11 February, Sir Christopher Meyer advised that President Bush’s reference to </p>
<p>an “axis of evil” was:</p>
<p>“… a warning to regimes which Bush sees as especially dangerous. It is not </p>
<p>simplistic; it increases expectations of military action against Iraq; and it has added </p>
<p>to transatlantic strains.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Sir Christopher reported that it was “the latest version of the Bush doctrine” which </p>
<p>rotated “on an axis which links terrorist networks, states which harbour them, and rogue </p>
<p>states with WMD”. President Bush had set out the first version of the doctrine, which </p>
<p>comprised the elements in his speech to Congress on 20 September 2001. Rogue </p>
<p>states had been added because “intelligence and the anthrax scare have generated the </p>
<p>view that WMD in the hands of rogue states is the clear and present danger”.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> President Bush had been “criticised for enunciating the doctrine without thinking </p>
<p>through the policy implications”. In Sir Christopher’s view, that missed the point. The </p>
<p>purpose in naming three countries was “to intimidate them, to put them on notice that </p>
<p>they were marked regimes; to ‘change the terms of the debate’”. There was a “serious </p>
<p>analysis” behind the phrase:</p>
<p>“It cannot be emphasised too strongly that 11 September was a shattering blow, </p>
<p>creating a sense of threat and vulnerability never before experienced by Americans.”</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The consequences were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“an outpouring of American gratitude to Britain, which more than others </p>
<p>appeared instantly to grasp the enormity of what had happened”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“incomprehension and anger at those who seemed more concerned for the </p>
<p>rights of the Guantanamo detainees than for the need to extract information </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>“The backdrop is growing US/European mutual disenchantment. This puts the UK </p>
<p>in an awkward spot … The Europeans are seen as burying their heads in the sand, </p>
<p>refusing to face up to an international threat which only the US, and maybe the UK, </p>
<p>have the guts and capability to tackle …</p>
<p>“Looking at this solely as an issue of unilateralism v. multilateralism does not capture </p>
<p>the complexity of American attitudes … For all their brave talk, the Americans know </p>
<p>perfectly well that they are better off with capable allies than not …</p>
<p>“War-fighting considerations are an insufficient guide to handling the next phase in </p>
<p>combating terrorism … The task for the next few months is to demonstrate to the </p>
<p>Americans that it is possible and desirable to reconcile the pursuit of the mission </p>
<p>with the concerns of the main coalition partners. This may call for some very </p>
<p>plain speaking in private. But we are just about the only foreigners to whom the </p>
<p>Administration consistently listens.</p>
<p>“So the visit to London next month of the Vice President and that of the Prime </p>
<p>Minister to the US in April assume even greater importance than usual.”</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Assessing the climate in Washington on 13 February, Sir Christopher Meyer </p>
<p>reported that President Bush’s speech had “quickened the drumbeat on Iraq” and </p>
<p>commentators were “drawing the conclusion that military action is now inevitable”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Drawing together the views the Embassy and senior visitors had heard over the last </p>
<p>couple of weeks, Sir Christopher wrote:</p>
<p>“The line that no decision has been taken … may still formally be correct. But there </p>
<p>are few parts of the Administration that see any alternative to US action – the real </p>
<p>questions now are what, when, and (from our point of view) how much international </p>
<p>legitimacy the US will seek to build …</p>
<p>“As ever, the hawks’ agenda is easiest to discern. They feel they have won the </p>
<p>argument over whether US action is needed … </p>
<p>“The military, meanwhile, continue to look at their plans in expectation that they will </p>
<p>be asked to take on a major operation in Iraq this year (this is … what lies behind </p>
<p>CENTCOM’s [US Central Command] reluctance to provide back-up to an expanded </p>
<p>ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] in Afghanistan) … But they remain </p>
<p>very worried about the ideas being pushed by DoD [Department of Defense] civilian </p>
<p>hawks, above all the perception that this would be easy to do quickly …</p>
<p>“The perception that key regional states are now essentially on board … now </p>
<p>appears to have spread across the Administration … officials and pundits alike </p>
<p>speculate that Cheney’s visit will be aimed at nailing the necessary support. </p>

<p>“What remains unclear is how the US will handle the UN track, above all the </p>
<p>inspection regime. The Administration’s repeated high-profile demands for </p>
<p>inspections suggest that the US will want to issue some sort of ultimatum, but set </p>
<p>the bar so high that Iraq will never comply in practice (Armitage [Richard Armitage, </p>
<p>US Deputy Secretary of State] as much as stated this to PUS [the FCO Permanent </p>
<p>Under Secretary] in January). Our objective remains to persuade the US … that they </p>
<p>must show that they are serious about implementing the resolutions – even if only to </p>
<p>prepare the ground properly in the international community for action if Saddam fails </p>
<p>to comply.</p>
<p>“There is a clear tension between the argument for preparing international opinion </p>
<p>(which leaves open the possibility of coercing Iraq into some real disarmament </p>
<p>measures under the threat of US military action), and the arguments for striking </p>
<p>swiftly and with maximum surprise … So although the goal of US policy may be ever </p>
<p>firmer, the way to get there is not.” </p>
<p><b>40. </b> Sir Christopher concluded that Vice President Cheney’s visit in early March “may </p>
<p>or may not be the main vehicle for consulting the UK. But it would be wise to assume </p>
<p>that by then, the US will have a reasonably clear vision, for which they will want our </p>
<p>endorsement.”</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Summarising the issues, the telegram predicted: </p>
<p>“The Administration appears to be gearing up for a decision on removing Saddam, </p>
<p>but are not quite there yet. The ‘how’ is still difficult. The debate looks likely to come </p>
<p>to a head this month. The likeliest outcome is some combination of an ultimatum </p>
<p>on weapons inspectors, backing of opposition forces, and US military intervention. </p>
<p>Cheney’s visit to the region in mid-March is likely to be on the critical path of US </p>
<p>diplomacy leading to action. We need to encourage the US to build international </p>
<p>legitimacy for action, but there may be a tension between this and operational </p>

<p>WMD proliferation”.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Ehrman said he had outlined the legal difficulty in trying to argue that WMD </p>
<p>development posed an “‘imminent’ threat”. Sir David Manning had asked whether </p>
<p>another justification for action could be the “flouting of UN SCRs [Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions]”. Mr Ehrman had advised that his understanding was that “a further SCR </p>
<p>would be required to authorise military action”; and that: “It seemed highly unlikely </p>
<p>that the US would be willing to seek such a resolution or, even if they did, that they </p>
<p>would get it.”</p>

<p>Committee (JIC), for “an analysis of the state of opinion in Iraq” and whether there were </p>
<p>“really segments of the population who might be willing to rise against Saddam … David </p>
<p>was sceptical. He also mentioned work … on the … INC [Iraqi National Congress].”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Wright informed the meeting of the JIC on 13 February that US policy towards </p>
<p>Iraq was “going to be the dominant one for relationships with US and Europe over the </p>
<p>next few weeks”.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> The Embassy in Washington had produced a “paper drawing together </p>
<p>all available information” which was circulated to JIC members. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> In the discussion the following points were made:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Policy discussions between US Principals were expected in the next 10-14 days </p>
<p>but there was no evidence that anything sudden or unexpected would happen. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US air supremacy “could be quick to secure, but the assembly of a large enough </p>
<p>force to bind measures together would take much longer”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the meantime Saddam had a number of options open to him to queer the </p>
<p>US pitch.” </p>
<p><b>47. </b> JIC members were invited to “share quickly” any useful analysis or information they </p>
<p>received.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> The date and context of the JIC discussion suggests that Mr Wright was referring </p>
<p>to Sir Christopher Meyer’s telegram of 13 February, received in London that morning.</p>

<p><b>62. </b> Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, described </p>
<p>a meeting in No.10 on 19 February as a “‘Phase 2’ war meeting” for Mr Blair with Sir </p>

<p>McKane, Deputy Head of OD Sec, Mr Powell and himself.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair was:</p>
<p>“… not sure if the Americans had taken all the decisions. He wanted to be in a </p>
<p>position to influence their strategy, which we would project as being about fighting </p>
<p>poverty and taking aid, but which they [the US] would see as fighting for their </p>
<p>values. He also wanted to commission papers on Iraq, Libya, North Korea, and the </p>
<p>European trade in WMD. He wanted work done on how to rejuvenate the MEPP </p>
<p>[Middle East Peace Process]. He assumed that by the time of our visit to the States </p>
<p>in April, there was chance the Americans would be casting around wider, and he </p>
<p>wanted all the facts at his fingertips. He felt that the political situation would be </p>
<p>different and internationally a lot harder for the Americans than things were post </p>
<p>September 11, if they were thinking of going for any of the other countries.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> There is no No.10 record of the meeting.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that, following the meeting on 19 February, “a large </p>
<p>number of papers” had been commissioned for the meeting between President Bush </p>
<p>and Mr Blair, at Crawford, Texas, in early April 2002.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>66. </b> The papers included: </p>

<p>against Iraq” would be “at the top of the agenda”. As with Usama Bin Laden and the </p>
<p>war in Afghanistan, it would be necessary to maintain public and international support </p>
<p>for military action against Saddam Hussein. That was a “public persuasion” issue </p>

<p><b>France’s position, mid-February 2002 </b></p>
<p><b>71.  Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, reported French concerns </b></p>
<p><b>about possible US actions and a desire to work with the UK on a policy of </b></p>
<p><b>engagement to keep the US within the international system.</b></p>
<p><b>72.  France was not necessarily opposed to military action to remove Saddam, </b></p>
<p><b>but it had identified a number of conditions which had yet to be met.</b></p>
<p><b>73.  France was also concerned that action against states such as Afghanistan </b></p>
<p><b>and Iraq would not solve the underlying problems of WMD proliferation and </b></p>
<p><b>terrorism, and might result in recruiting more terrorists.</b></p>
<p><b>74. </b> On 11 February, the British Embassy Paris reported talks between Mr Goulty, </p>
<p>Mr Patey and Mr Felix Paganon, UN Director in the Quai d’Orsay.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Paganon was reported to have said France was convinced the US would take </p>
<p>military action against Iraq before the end of the year. The US considered that it did not </p>
<p>need additional authority for action, and:</p>
<p>“When it came to decision time, the US would proceed according to their own </p>
<p>criteria, not on the basis of consultation with allies.” </p>
<p><b>76. </b> France wanted to do whatever was achievable to prevent military action, “not out of </p>
<p>concern for Saddam’s survival but through fear of the consequences of military action”, </p>
<p>which could include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>chaos in Iraq, where the vacuum might be filled by another Ba’ath general;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>division of Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increased instability in the region.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> France believed the unconditional return of weapons inspectors was the only way </p>
<p>to prevent military action. France was no longer pressing for an early discussion of </p>
<p>the Goods Review List but there was scepticism about the prospects for toughening </p>

<p>enforcement of existing resolutions, “particularly the Syrian pipeline”. Tightening the </p>
<p>sanctions regime would be “difficult to achieve and did little to prevent confrontation”, </p>
<p>which was now the “basic aim”. </p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Paganon and Mr Goulty agreed on the need “to maintain P5 [the five Permanent </p>
<p>Members of the Security Council] unity”. </p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Patey said that if the:</p>
<p>“… consensus were broken, military action would be more likely. The US would </p>
<p>be prepared to act on their own if necessary, but would be inhibited if there were a </p>
<p>viable UN track in train.” </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Paganon agreed that it was vital the P5 and Arab states sent the same tough </p>
<p>message to Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Mr Goulty stated:</p>
<p>“… in the meantime we should all send the same message to the Americans, that </p>
<p>we should continue to go down the UN route, and that if this did not work, we would </p>
<p>then have a better pretext for dealing with WMD through military action.” </p>
<p><b>82. </b> Sir John Holmes advised on 19 February that France was “particularly concerned” </p>
<p>about what President Bush’s “axis of evil” implied for US policy.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> It was ready to </p>
<p>recognise that “differences with the Americans” were “more about means than </p>
<p>ends”; but they would want to work with the UK “to keep American action within the </p>
<p>international system”. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> France had “worried since the end of the Cold War that American power was </p>
<p>becoming disproportionate”. The main French concerns following President Bush’s “axis </p>
<p>of evil” speech were that the US:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>would be “increasingly tempted towards unilateral action without consulting allies </p>
<p>or the UN”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>saw “military action as more or less the sole response to terrorism and </p>
<p>proliferation”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was confusing the two problems of terrorism and proliferation.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> The French view was that:</p>
<p>“… as well as clamping down hard (but in accordance with international law) on </p>
<p>unacceptable actions, we also need to address their political economic, cultural </p>
<p>and military causes … [A]scribing them simply to a national or individual propensity </p>
<p>for wrongdoing is inadequate. There are reasons beyond mere wickedness why </p>

<p>dangerous regimes by military repression, or removing them by military force, may </p>
<p>in the long run even make things worse.</p>
<p>“So on most cases the French favour a policy of engagement …” </p>
<p><b>85. </b> Sir John identified Iraq as “the real problem”. France had “long been at odds” with </p>
<p>the US and UK over “the basic analysis: arguing that a policy of punitive sanctions and </p>
<p>containment of Saddam is in the long term likely to create even greater incentives for </p>
<p>the regime to proliferate and more antagonism in the population, and so store up new </p>
<p>dangers, particularly in the absence of real MEPP progress”. </p>
<p><b>86. </b> Before 11 September, France had felt US policy was moving in its direction:</p>
<p>“Now, although work continues on the Goods Review List (a French idea), they </p>
<p>suspect the gap will widen again … They are not necessarily totally opposed to an </p>
<p>American operation to remove Saddam, which they increasingly see as inevitable, </p>
<p>provided that it is supported in the UN and in the region; is carefully thought through </p>
<p>in military terms; and forms part of a realistic project for creating a better and more </p>
<p>stable future for the country and the region. So far they do not think these conditions </p>
<p>have been met. The lack of American willingness so far to follow through on nation </p>
<p>building in Afghanistan has not encouraged them. Nor does the present parlous </p>
<p>state of the MEPP …”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>87. </b> In addition, France was “not convinced that the approach of naming key states </p>
<p>of concern, and dealing with them by military means or diplomatic isolation” would </p>
<p>“solve the underlying problems of WMD proliferation or terrorism”. Those threats were </p>
<p>developing through “shadowy non-state networks” which would “not go away” even </p>
<p>if examples were made of Afghanistan and Iraq; “and may well gain more recruits </p>
<p>over time”.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Sir John concluded the French “instinct remains to back the Americans in </p>
<p>upholding international stability when push comes to shove”. What France wanted </p>
<p>“above all” was “to be consulted and involved, and to have some input into analysis and </p>
<p>policy before they are faced with the choice of following US decisions or not”. The UK </p>
<p>was “likely to be in the front line of any split” and had “a particular incentive to act, and to </p>
<p>do so quickly. If we wait until the Americans have a fully worked out plan, attitudes may </p>
<p>well have hardened too far on both sides.” </p>
<p><b>89. </b> Sir John suggested the UK needed to persuade:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US “using the influence we have earned” to explain their thinking and </p>
<p>“to share intelligence as much as they can to illustrate the real, present WMD </p>
<p>dangers of the Iraqi regime; to explain why they believe they can remove the </p>
<p>regime without setting the region on fire; and, once they have a plan, to explain </p>

<p>why they think it can work”. The US instinct would be to share only with the </p>
<p>UK but that would put “us in a particularly difficult position, increasing the </p>
<p>appearance of poodlism if we follow without being able to explain adequately </p>
<p>ourselves. We saw in the early stages of the Afghan crisis how bad the </p>
<p>Americans could be at appearing to have a coherent plan, and at keeping allies </p>
<p>in the loop. Doubts were stilled by good PR work by us, and above all by quick </p>
<p>success. But we and they should learn the lessons.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France and others to “eschew megaphone diplomacy” and to engage the US.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Sir John added:</p>
<p>“… our chances of success with the Americans would be much greater if we could </p>
<p>persuade other Europeans to … be serious about defence capabilities. Our chances </p>
<p>with the Europeans would be much greater if we could persuade the Americans to </p>
<p>put their full weight behind breaking the current disastrous MEPP cycle, and look </p>
<p>as if they were doing so.” </p>
<p><b>The UK diplomatic perspective</b></p>
<p><b>91.  FCO officials identified the need to pursue “the UN route” demanding </b></p>
<p><b>access for weapons inspectors as a possible way to avoid military action while </b></p>
<p><b>establishing stronger arguments for such action if necessary.</b></p>
<p><b>92.  The way in which the minute was written indicates that the FCO officials did </b></p>
<p><b>not, at that stage, envisage military action would comprise a full-scale, US-led </b></p>
<p><b>invasion.</b></p>
<p><b>93.  The minute prompted a wider debate in the Diplomatic Service which </b></p>
<p><b>identified a number of key issues. </b></p>
<p><b>94.  Although those contributions did not lead to the establishment of an agreed </b></p>
<p><b>FCO position, on the implications for the UK of military action in Iraq and the </b></p>
<p><b>advantages and disadvantages of different courses of action.</b></p>
<p><b>95. </b> On 20 February, Mr Goulty produced “a note on contingency planning in the event </p>
<p>of military action against Iraq”, which advised: </p>
<p>“Planning for any military action against Iraq will need to take into account the need </p>
<p>to prepare the ground for, and minimise, the adverse humanitarian, diplomatic and </p>
<p>PR consequences of, what will be a widely unpopular move. Much will depend on </p>
<p>the duration of the action … and whether or not it succeeds in removing Saddam. </p>
<p>The worst possible scenario … would be a prolonged campaign which left Saddam </p>
<p>in power and allowed him to make maximum propaganda gains … In the current </p>

<p>403</p>
<p>Middle East climate, we would probably be faced with the collapse of sanctions and </p>
<p>the effective end of our containment policy.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Addressing the “Legal position/UN route”, Mr Goulty wrote:</p>
<p>“Whether we participated or not, we would wish to see a convincing legal justification </p>
<p>for military action …”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Addressing the chances of obtaining fresh UN authority, Mr Goulty advised that it </p>
<p>seemed:</p>
<p>“… highly unlikely that, in the absence of a new attack on Kuwait or the Kurds or of </p>
<p>clear and publicly usable evidence that Iraq has reconstituted its WMD, the Security </p>
<p>Council would agree a further resolution that could justify military action. This </p>
<p>would include a new … resolution specifically demanding access for the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors, although we should still push for one … We should continue to put </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq to readmit inspectors – this makes sense whether or not military </p>
<p>action is contemplated. If the Iraqi regime continues to refuse (and signs are … it </p>
<p>has no intention of doing otherwise) we would at least be in a stronger position to </p>
<p>defend military action. In the unlikely event that the inspectors are admitted, history </p>
<p>would suggest that it would not be long before they were blocked, which again would </p>
<p>strengthen the arguments for military action. We should also continue pushing for </p>
<p>tougher action … against those states … breaking sanctions (especially Syria). </p>
<p>Again this makes sense whether or not military action is contemplated: it would put </p>
<p>real pressure on Saddam either to submit to meaningful inspections or to lash out.”</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr Goulty suggested:</p>
<p>“Our message to those who oppose military action should be to get serious about </p>
<p>the UN route: encouraging Iraq to believe that it can escape sanctions without </p>
<p>complying with SCRs, seeking to water down those … obligations, and blocking </p>
<p>initiatives in the UN to crack down on smuggling serves only to make military action </p>
<p>more likely.”</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Goulty’s view was that: “In the current climate, and in the absence of progress </p>
<p>on the MEPP – highly unlikely in this timescale – Arab States would have the greatest </p>
<p>difficulties in supporting an operation which is bound to be seen as serving Israeli </p>
<p>interests.” Nevertheless there were signs that some countries would support the US. </p>
<p>The UK would have “a better picture of regional attitudes after Vice President Cheney’s </p>
<p>March tour”.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Addressing the attitudes of others, Mr Goulty wrote:</p>
<p>“We would expect the Iranians, hitherto (privately) in favour of action to remove </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, to be much less helpful in the light of President Bush’s ‘axis </p>

<p>French position is not greatly different from our own. Their policy remains to keep </p>
<p>up pressure on Baghdad over inspectors and maintain P5 unity. But they accept </p>
<p>that US military action to remove Saddam is now very much on the cards. In this </p>
<p>event, they would want the US to fully think through the consequences and take </p>
<p>adequate steps to build legitimacy in the UN. Recent German statements reveal </p>
<p>a preoccupation with maintaining the rule of law, concern over the unilateralist </p>
<p>trend in US policy, but a reluctance to criticise the US overtly … We would expect </p>

<p><b>101. </b> Addressing public and media reaction, Mr Goulty wrote:</p>
<p>“The public and media reaction to any military action would be mixed … </p>
<p>“The Arab and Muslim media and ‘street’ would be deeply hostile …</p>
<p>“In the build up to any action, we would need to mount an aggressive PR [public </p>
<p>relations] campaign emphasising Iraq’s record of non-compliance with UNSCRs </p>
<p>and evidence of WMD reconstitution and other crimes (making maximum use of </p>
<p>intelligence). Our basic message, around which further, more detailed messages </p>
<p>could be built, might be: ‘Iraq poses a unique threat to the security and stability </p>
<p>of the region as well as the rest of the world.’ </p>
<p>“Ideally targets selected would be purely military and steps taken to avoid </p>
<p>non-combatant civilian casualties …” </p>
<p>“Ultimately the success of any campaign would depend on the success and </p>
<p>swiftness of the military action (and removal of Saddam Hussein).”</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Mr Goulty concluded that planning would:</p>
<p>“… need to take into account the need to prepare the ground for, and minimise the </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Sawers began:</p>
<p>“I have hesitated to offer my own [views], in the knowledge that contacts between </p>
<p>London and Washington will already be intensive and rightly held close. But I </p>
<p>sense a danger of us becoming too predictable. I do not advocate a US march on </p>
<p>Baghdad. But I do think we need to box more cleverly, not least to retain leverage </p>
<p>in Washington.”</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Sawers stated containment had worked for 10 years but the price had been </p>
<p>high. Iraq’s WMD activities were “still without doubt going ahead” and Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>regime would “remain an obstacle to every single Western objective in the Middle East”. </p>
<p>In his view the UK needed to say:</p>
<p>“… clearly and consistently that our goal is Regime Change – for the sake of stability </p>
<p>in the Middle East, for the Iraqi people, and for the goal of controlling the spread </p>
<p>of WMD.” </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Setting out a list of other countries where regime change had been and remained a </p>
<p>goal of UK policy, Mr Sawers wrote:</p>
<p>“Whether or not we actually express it is purely a matter of tactics. So the lawyers </p>
<p>and peaceniks should not prevent us from saying what we really want in Iraq. And </p>
<p>by associating ourselves with Bush’s heartfelt objective of seeing Saddam removed, </p>
<p>we will be given more houseroom in Washington to ask the awkward questions </p>
<p>about how.</p>
<p>“And there are many such questions. What is the plan? How long would it take for </p>
<p>a direct confrontation to succeed? How do we retain the support of our regional </p>
<p>friends … If we were to build up the Kurds and Shia as proxies, what assurances </p>
<p>would we have to give them that we would not let them down yet again? How would </p>
<p>we keep the Iranians from meddling? How do we preserve Iraq’s territorial integrity … </p>
<p>How would we provide for stability after Saddam and his cronies were killed?</p>
<p>“All these are much more important questions than legality, the Arab street and </p>
<p>other hardy Foreign Office perennials. On a tactical point, I recall Colin Powell [the </p>
<p>US Secretary of State, who had been Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from </p>
<p>1988 to 1993] … in 1993 saying that one of the blessings of retirement was that he </p>
<p>would never have to listen to another British legal opinion. Presenting Washington </p>

<p>“Conventional advice will be to plough on in New York, get the Goods Review List </p>
<p>agreed, and work to implement the SCRs by sending back the inspectors.</p>
<p>“We should think long and hard on the last point. There is not a shred of evidence </p>
<p>that Saddam is willing to open up his WMD plants to the UN. We would be </p>
<p>sending people … on a fool’s errand and offering them as hostages. We could be </p>
<p>precipitating the very crisis we would rather avoid, on terms favourable to Saddam </p>
<p>… and we would offer an opportunity on a plate to the hawks in Washington. And if </p>
<p>it is the UK in the lead, as we usually are, we will suffer a heavier backlash … We </p>
<p>need to have an agreed strategy with Washington before we head down a road </p>
<p>which might look sensible, legal, UN-friendly etc, but only leads us into the jam we </p>
<p>are trying to avoid.”</p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Sawers concluded:</p>
<p>“Visiting Americans say privately that there is still a debate to be had in Washington. </p>
<p>Powell is not as lonely a voice as he might seem. We know that Bush, at the end of </p>
<p>the day, will be both intelligent and responsible. If we can help the Americans come </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S MEETING WITH MR ANNAN, 25 FEBRUARY 2002</p>
<p><b>114. </b> In preparation for a meeting with Mr Kofi Annan, UN Secretary-General, in London </p>
<p>on 25 February, the FCO advised Mr Blair that Mr Amre Moussa, Secretary General of </p>
<p>the Arab League, had conveyed an “offer” from President Saddam Hussein to Mr Annan </p>
<p>“to re-open dialogue, without pre-conditions, on co-operation with the UN”.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> The FCO </p>
<p>added that it was “not clear whether Saddam would under any circumstances allow </p>
<p>the return of the inspectors” or whether it was “simply a propaganda exercise”. History </p>
<p>“would suggest the latter”. </p>
<p><b>115. </b> Mr Annan had responded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He was always willing to talk to any [UN] Member State about complying with </p>
<p>UN resolutions. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any renewed dialogue should be more focused and substantive than before, </p>
<p>and set in the context of implementing the relevant resolutions, including getting </p>
<p>the inspectors back in.</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Mr Blair was advised to make a number of points to Mr Annan, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Congratulating Mr Annan on his response to Saddam Hussein’s offer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime’s support for terrorism and development of WMD was “of the </p>
<p>utmost concern” to the international community. Saddam’s “WMD ambitions” </p>
<p>would not be allowed to “go unchecked”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK believed getting inspectors back into Iraq was the “best way to eliminate </p>
<p>WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Getting them in on Saddam Hussein’s terms was “not an option”: the UK was </p>
<p>looking for “an effective inspections regime as specified in … resolutions 687 </p>
<p>and 1284, not false assurances”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime had to be “brought to realise that if it continues to reject its UN </p>
<p>obligations to disarm then military action to deal with the threat it poses becomes </p>
<p>more likely. We collectively share responsibility for ensuring this message gets </p>
<p>across.” </p>
<p><b>117. </b> In their meeting, Mr Blair told Mr Annan that WMD were “the key” for the next </p>
<p>phase of the response to terrorism, “particularly acquisition by states that were not </p>

<p>democratic, stable or progressive”, and “no final decisions had been taken on Iraq”: </p>
<p>“He had been hoping there would be a new UN resolution and inspectors back in.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>118. </b> In response to comments about the evidence of Iraqi activity, Mr Blair said the UK </p>
<p>was “giving thought to how to produce the necessary evidence”. Nothing would “happen </p>
<p>precipitately” and there might be “other ways to deal with Iraq, for instance if Saddam </p>
<p>allowed inspectors back in”.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote that in late February he had been told by a senior </p>
<p>British diplomat that the US “was determined to have the resolutions obeyed, or ‘to have </p>
<p>the regime out’”.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> When Mr Annan had “responded that Saddam Hussein had a habit of </p>
<p>miscalculating”, he had been told “either they [the US] will get rid of the capability or they </p>
<p>will get rid of him [Saddam Hussein]”. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Mr Annan added:</p>
<p>“But what was also clear, even to the most ardent of opponents of military action </p>
<p>was that the current strategy wasn’t working: the sanctions could never be made </p>
<p>‘smart’ enough to spare the Iraqi people from continued suffering; nor were they </p>
<p>robust enough to ensure with certainty that Baghdad wasn’t finding ways to rearm </p>
<p>in contravention of its obligations …” </p>
<p><b>121. </b> A report of discussions between Mr Blair and other European leaders at the </p>
<p>Progressive Governance Summit in Stockholm stated that “there was a general sense … </p>
<p>that it would be counter-productive to confront the US. The wiser course was to get the </p>
<p>US to widen their agenda and encourage them to approach the issue from a coalition </p>
<p>perspective.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> Mr Blair’s overall sense from those discussions was that it “would be a </p>
<p>challenging task, but possible” to bring France and Germany “onside”.</p>
<p><b>122.  The FCO advised No.10 on 26 February that the immediate US focus was on </b></p>
<p><b>getting the Goods Review List agreed. After that, the UK wanted Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>discussions on the arrangements for inspections, but US support was uncertain. </b></p>
<p><b>If “against all expectations” UNMOVIC was allowed to do its job that would “offer </b></p>
<p><b>the best prospect of dealing with Iraq’s WMD”. </b></p>
<p><b>123.  The FCO advice did not address the wider issues arising from the </b></p>

<p><b>response should be to that.</b></p>

<p><b>124. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office advised Sir David Manning on 26 February that: </p>
<p>“In the absence of any decisions on wider Iraq policy and the post-11 September </p>
<p>situation, the immediate US focus is on getting the Goods Review List (GRL) agreed </p>
<p>by the 30 May deadline.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>125. </b> Once the GRL was implemented, there was:</p>
<p>“… an expectation, if UN credibility is to be maintained, that the Security Council </p>
<p>would begin discussions on clarification of SCR 1284 … The US are reluctant to </p>
<p>go down this route, fearing that it represents a slippery slope towards a weaker </p>
<p>inspection regime. But it remains our view that, properly handled, clarification would </p>
<p>work to our advantage … If the Iraqis continued to resist a tough inspection regime </p>
<p>or let the inspectors in then reneged, the justification for any military action would be </p>
<p>much stronger. If, against all expectations UNMOVIC were allowed to do their job, </p>
<p>this would offer the best prospect of dealing with Iraq’s WMD.” </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The FCO wrote that the US was talking to the Russians. If the French could be </p>

<p><b>129. </b> Sir Derek Plumbly, British Ambassador to Saudi Arabia wrote to Sir Michael Jay </p>
<p>on 27 February, warning:</p>
<p>“… we have always said we want to see regime change. There is no harm in saying </p>
<p>it now more insistently perhaps, given that the Bush Administration have raised the </p>
<p>issue to the top of the international agenda. But to date we have presented regime </p>
<p>change as an aspiration, not an objective which we believe we (or the US can </p>
<p>deliver). If we cross that bridge definitively, it will be difficult to pull back later.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>130. </b> Sir Derek argued that the UK did need to take account of the Arab Street:</p>
<p>“Post 11 September I really do not see how we can disregard the depth of anger </p>
<p>in our Middle Eastern back yard … regimes may not fall in this part of the world, </p>

<p>“… the need to frame our arguments within the US universe of facts. But we should </p>
<p>not kid ourselves. UNSCOM [UN Special Commission] ground to a halt because </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 27 February 2002: ‘Iraq: Saddam Under the Spotlight’</b></p>
<p><b>147.  The JIC Assessment of 27 February concluded that Saddam Hussein saw the </b></p>
<p><b>Goods Review List as making sanctions sustainable indefinitely. </b></p>
<p><b>148.  Saddam Hussein would permit the return of weapons inspectors if large </b></p>
<p><b>scale military action was believed to be imminent, but he would seek to frustrate </b></p>
<p><b>their efforts.</b></p>
<p><b>149.  Iraq continued to pursue its WMD programmes; design work for missiles </b></p>
<p><b>with ranges greater than the UN limit of 150km was under way and it could </b></p>
<p><b>produce chemical warfare agents “within weeks”. The JIC also introduced a new </b></p>
<p><b>judgement that, “If it has not already done so, Iraq could produce significant </b></p>
<p><b>quantities of biological warfare agents within days”. </b></p>
<p><b>150.  Without direct intervention on the ground, the opposition would be unable </b></p>
<p><b>to overthrow Saddam Hussein’s regime. </b></p>
<p><b>151.  If he was unable to deter a US attack, Saddam Hussein would “go down </b></p>
<p><b>fighting and could adopt high risk options”.</b></p>
<p><b>152. </b> At the request of the JIC, an Assessment, ‘Iraq: Saddam Under the Spotlight’, was </p>
<p>produced on 27 February.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> It addressed “Saddam’s threat perceptions and internal </p>
<p>position: whether he is secure, what opposition he faces, and what he is doing to try and </p>
<p>avoid the internal and international threats he faces”. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> In its discussion of the draft, the JIC concluded that the Assessment should </p>
<p>“put … to one side” the issue of Iraq’s interpretation of US policy as the latter was “itself </p>
<p>developing, and would probably become much clearer to everyone … within the next </p>
<p>few weeks”.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>154. </b> The JIC also decided that the final Assessment:</p>
<p>“… needed to say a bit more about Iraq’s aspirations and potential in terms of </p>
<p>Weapons of Mass Destruction, not least because this was, and would remain, an </p>
<p>important area for policy discussions with the US. The Pentagon’s views on how </p>
<p>soon Iraq might develop a nuclear capability did not quite match the UK’s, and it </p>
<p>would be useful for Ministers to know the JIC’s mind.”</p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>413</p>
<p><b>155. </b> In the first of its Key Judgements, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“Saddam fears a US military attack which would threaten his regime by bringing </p>
<p>about the disintegration of his military and security apparatus. A force on the scale </p>
<p>of Desert Storm (1991) would constitute such a threat.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>156. </b> The JIC also judged that Saddam did not believe such an attack was inevitable. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> In addition, the JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein continued to “resist the enforcement” of Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions “on disarmament while encouraging sanctions erosion”. His strategy </p>
<p>was “threatened by US/UK efforts to introduce the Goods Review List (GRL) and </p>
<p>make Iraq accept weapons inspectors”. Iraq saw the GRL as “making sanctions </p>
<p>indefinitely sustainable”. But “the greatest risk seen by Saddam” was “that </p>
<p>non-compliance with the UN may be used to justify a full-scale US attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam had: “In response … begun a nominal re-engagement with the UN </p>
<p>and a diplomatic charm offensive.” So far he had offered “nothing new”. The </p>
<p>JIC judged that if the threat of large-scale military action was believed to be </p>
<p>imminent, Saddam would permit the return of weapons inspectors. It they did </p>
<p>return Saddam would “frustrate their efforts” and he would “continue to play for </p>
<p>time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continued “to pursue its WMD programmes. Design work for missiles with </p>
<p>ranges greater than the UN limit of 150km is under way. If it has not already </p>
<p>done so, Iraq could produce significant quantities of biological warfare agent </p>
<p>within days and chemical warfare agents within weeks of a decision to do so.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Republican Guard (SRG) remained “closely tied to Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime” and was “likely to resist any attempt to overthrow him”. The Republican </p>
<p>Guard was also “favoured” and was “relatively well equipped and trained; it </p>
<p>would be relatively resilient under attack, but its loyalty in dire straits is more </p>
<p>open to question than the SRG”. “Other elements of the Iraqi military” were </p>
<p>“more liable to crack if subjected to strong attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Kurdish and Shia groups formed “the most significant opposition to Baghdad”. </p>
<p>The “opposition” was “militarily weak and riven by factional differences”. They </p>
<p>would “not act without visible and sustained US military support on the ground”. </p>
<p>A “coup or military revolt” was “only a remote possibility”.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> The JIC stated that the US reaction, to the attacks on 11 September, had “been a </p>
<p>jolt” to Saddam Hussein’s position. President Bush’s speech labelling Iraq as part of an </p>
<p>“axis of evil” would have “reinforced” Saddam Hussein’s concern.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>159. </b> In respect of developments at the UN, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“In conjunction with pressure from the US, developments at the UN since November </p>
<p>2001 threaten to de-rail Saddam’s long-term strategy of refusing to comply with </p>
<p>UNSCRs on weapons inspectors while working to circumvent sanctions and </p>
<p>encourage their erosion. UK and US proposals to introduce the Goods Review List </p>
<p>(GRL) in June 2002 … undermine Iraq’s propaganda over sanctions by offering Iraq </p>
<p>unrestricted access to most goods. Iraq therefore sees the GRL as making sanctions </p>
<p>politically sustainable indefinitely. Russia’s acceptance of UNSCR 1382 while </p>
<p>accepting only ill-defined assurances on steps to clarify UNSCR 1284 … was also </p>
<p>a defeat for Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> In response, there were signs that Iraq had “embarked on a <b>nominal policy of </b></p>
<p><b>re-engagement with the UN and a diplomatic charm offensive</b>”. Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq’s </p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister, had visited Moscow and Beijing in early 2002 “to solicit support </p>
<p>against sanctions and the US threat […]”.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> The Assessment added:</p>
<p>“But <b>this tactical diplomacy has failed to improve Iraq’s position</b>. […] The UN </p>
<p>Secretary-General has been wary of accepting Saddam’s suggestion of a renewed </p>
<p>dialogue and accurately perceives Iraq’s wish to prevaricate …” </p>
<p><b>162. </b> In relation to Iraq’s WMD programme, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“… Iraq continues to pursue the development of weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>Though we lack precise data, Iraq has probably reconstituted many of the </p>
<p>elements struck during Operation Desert Fox in December 1998. Iraq’s ballistic </p>
<p>missile programme has extensively tested missiles under the 150km UN limit and </p>
<p>intelligence indicates that design work for systems with ranges over 1,000km is </p>
<p>underway. Iraq is assessed to have hidden 10-20 Al Hussein missiles (range 650km) </p>
<p>capable of hitting Israel. Iraq also continues with its chemical and biological warfare </p>
<p>(CBW) programmes and, if it has not already done so, could produce significant </p>
<p>quantities of BW agent within days and CW agents within weeks of a decision </p>
<p>to do so … These can be delivered by a variety of means. Methods of ensuring </p>
<p>survivability of CBW production facilities from attack are a high priority.</p>
<p>“Procurement activity suggests that Iraq is continuing with a nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme, although its current status is unclear. Before the Gulf War intervened, </p>
<p>Iraqi plans were well advanced and we judge they were only three years away from </p>
<p>possessing a nuclear weapon. Were sanctions lifted now, we judge it would take </p>
<p>Iraq at least five years to produce a nuclear weapon and a further two to produce </p>
<p>a warhead. The acquisition of fissile material or significant technical assistance </p>
<p>from abroad could significantly shorten this timescale. Iraq still has some low grade </p>
<p>radioactive material which it could utilise in a radiological dispersal device, but there </p>
<p>is no recent intelligence indicating that Iraq is pursuing such a course.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>415</p>
<p><b>163. </b> The Assessment stated that Saddam Hussein recognised the “greatest risk” was:</p>
<p>“… that the Iraqi WMD programme and non-compliance with UNSCRs may be used </p>
<p>to justify a US attack to overthrow him. He would probably see a force on the scale </p>
<p>of Desert Storm (1991) as overwhelming. We judge that [if the threat of large-scale </p>
<p>military action was believed to be imminent, Saddam would permit the return of </p>
<p>weapons inspectors] …” </p>
<p><b>164. </b> The JIC judged that, as “an interim fall-back position”:</p>
<p>“… Iraq could try to resurrect Russian proposals to link the entry of inspectors to a </p>
<p>pre-determined timetable of sanctions-lift. But this would be no more than a tactical </p>
<p>move to buy time, not an admission of defeat … <b>even if inspectors were allowed </b></p>
<p><b>to return, Iraq would embark on a renewed policy of frustration</b>, involving </p>
<p>denial, deception, obstruction and delay. Iraq would be able to conceal from </p>
<p>inspectors much of its CBW work and research on longer range missiles, though </p>
<p>probably not its missile production facilities.”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The Assessment reviewed Iraqi opposition groups and elaborated the final Key </p>
<p>Judgement: </p>
<p>“Overall we judge that, <b>unaided, the Iraqi opposition is incapable of </b></p>
<p><b>overthrowing the Iraqi regime; in the present circumstances a coup or </b></p>
<p><b>military revolt remains only a remote possibility</b>. With outside help short of </p>
<p>direct intervention on the ground, the opposition would still be unable to succeed. </p>
<p>Spontaneous mass uprisings might be more important if the regime’s control </p>
<p>wavered, but this is not in prospect; however, it might hasten the regime’s downfall </p>
<p>in conjunction with a massive US attack.”</p>
<p><b>166. </b> The Assessment added:</p>
<p>“The resilience of the Iraq military is uncertain; much would depend on the particular </p>
<p>nature and scale of the attack it faced and how it perceived that threat. Though the </p>
<p>Iraqi military is relatively large, well-trained and well-equipped by regional standards </p>
<p>… it also has serious weaknesses … [I]ts training and equipment is inadequate to </p>
<p>face Western forces on equal terms and it is especially vulnerable to air power.</p>
<p>“The Republican Guard (RG) and Special Republican Guard (SRG) are the elite </p>
<p>… they are better equipped and trained than the regular army. For these reasons, </p>
<p>we would expect them to be relatively resilient under attack … It [the SRG] would </p>
<p>defend any attempt to topple Saddam. In dire straits, the RG’s loyalty would be more </p>
<p>open to question. The regular army would be most liable to waver in its support of </p>
<p>the regime, or disintegrate, if subject to a strong US attack.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Looking to the future, the JIC judged that Saddam Hussein was “not yet convinced” </p>
<p>that a US: </p>
<p>“… move to overthrow him is inevitable. While the Coalition campaign continues in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, he probably believes the US is militarily preoccupied; in any event, US </p>
<p>rhetoric has not so far been backed up by overt preparations to attack. He still hopes </p>
<p>that his efforts to counter progress at the UN will undermine support for sanctions </p>
<p>and for US military action …” </p>
<p><b>168. </b> The Kurds and Shia “would not show their hand until US resolve to overthrow </p>
<p>Saddam” was “absolutely clear”. There was “no obvious leader” among those groups </p>
<p>who was “capable of unifying the opposition” and had “credibility and popular appeal </p>
<p>inside Iraq”. No likely replacement for Saddam from within the regime had been </p>
<p>identified, but the JIC stated that, in the event of internal change, it was “likely that any </p>
<p>successor would be autocratic and drawn from the Sunni military elite”. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> The JIC concluded:</p>
<p>“In the event of a US attack, Saddam would probably shift to a well-tested defensive </p>
<p>strategy in the hope that Iraqi resistance to a US ground campaign would strain </p>
<p>US resolve … Alternatively, if Saddam believed he was unable to deter a US attack </p>
<p>to oust his regime, we judge he would go down fighting and could adopt high risk </p>
<p>options, such as seizing northern Iraq, to disrupt US planning. Faced with defeat, </p>
<p>Saddam could resort to even riskier options such as conducting terrorist attacks </p>
<p>or using weapons of mass destruction against US forces or Israel.</p>
<p>“Iraq could fracture under attack. But all Iraq’s neighbours agree that … is deeply </p>
<p>undesirable. Each will try to influence events as they develop; it is likely that Iran … </p>
<p>would try to maintain and build its influence … But we judge it would try to avoid </p>
<p>becoming directly involved in fighting on either side.” </p>
<p><b>MOD advice to Mr Hoon, 27 February 2002</b></p>
<p><b>170.  The MOD advised Mr Hoon that the UK should not rule out military action </b></p>
<p><b>against Iraq; but there was a need to think through the options in more depth. </b></p>
<p><b>That would also improve the “prospects of influencing the US towards a </b></p>
<p><b>successful outcome”.</b></p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Simon Webb, the MOD Policy Director, sent Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence </p>

<p><b>172. </b> Mr Webb recommended that the UK should acknowledge that the countries posed </p>
<p>“increasing” risks to international stability; and that the US should be persuaded to </p>
<p>explain why. The UK should:</p>
<p>“Encourage a broad-based approach ranging from diplomacy to challenge </p>
<p>inspections and levers on suppliers.</p>
<p>“Not rule out UK participation in military action against Iraq […] if that is the only way </p>
<p>to stem the tide of WMD proliferation and a worthwhile and legal option exists at </p>
<p>the time.”</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Mr Webb also stated that it was important to distinguish between two strands; the </p>
<p>“direct risks from proliferation” and the “potential association with international terrorism”.</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Mr Webb’s detailed advice on the risks posed by Iraq is addressed in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><b>175. </b> In the context of the response from European partners, Mr Webb advised:</p>
<p>“… it would be wiser for the UK to take a more complex position supporting the </p>
<p>underlying concerns but advocating a greater mix of possible approaches. No.10 </p>
<p>have started to take this line over the last week but we need to think through the </p>
<p>options in more depth. In this way we have better prospects of influencing the US </p>

<p>the issues more effectively …” </p>
<p><b>176. </b> Mr Webb asked Mr Hoon for approval for the overall approach he had set out </p>
<p>on which he would “be working with the Cabinet Office” before Mr Blair’s meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush in early April. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Ehrman, who had been shown a draft of Mr Webb’s advice, raised a number </p>

<p>it is important that we make sure that we have taken action in respect of it.” </p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Blair also stated that: “The accumulation of weapons of mass destruction by </p>

<p><b>190. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had given an interview for <i>ABC</i> which was “very </p>
<p>forward on Iraq and pro GWB [President Bush]. He had decided that was the best </p>
<p>position to adopt to gain influence.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>191. <i></b> The Telegraph</i> the following day reported that Mr Blair had “stepped up his rhetoric </p>
<p>against Saddam Hussein”, and that his remarks were the “strongest support yet” for </p>
<p>President Bush’s “tough line”. It was “seen as an attempt to prepare the British public </p>
<p>for a second phase in the war against terrorism”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 3 March, Mr Blair was reported to have told <i>Channel Nine</i> in Australia: </p>
<p>“We know they [Iraq] are trying to accumulate … weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>we know he’s prepared to use them. So this is a real issue but how we deal with </p>
<p>it, that’s a matter we must discuss.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Blair was also reported to have argued that the lessons of 11 September meant </p>
<p>that such threats must be tackled; and that “if we don’t act we will find out too late the </p>
<p>potential for destruction”. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> Introducing a debate in the House of Commons on 4 March, on the Government’s </p>
<p>policy towards countries supporting international terrorism, in particular Syria, Iran </p>
<p>and Iraq, Mr Jim Murphy (Labour) stated that Iraq had a history of support for terrorist </p>
<p>organisations and had:</p>
<p>“More recently … again assumed a high profile, taking centre stage in world politics. </p>
<p>It is now absolutely clear in the wider sense of global and regional security that </p>
<p>Iraq must act. Saddam Hussein, newly armed with an improved weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction capability, is a threat not only to his own people and his neighbours, </p>
<p>but to international security. The United Kingdom, along with its allies, is rightly </p>
<p>considering action, but I firmly believe that we must also publish whatever evidence </p>
<p>we can, notwithstanding the lack of observers on the ground.</p>
<p>“There is evidence of the increased viability and range of Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, and we need to persuade not only the House but the British public </p>
<p>and world opinion – especially Arab opinion that, because of the threat posed by </p>
<p>Saddam to his neighbours and to world security, we may, unfortunately, be left with </p>
<p>no alternative as an international community but to act, in more than a diplomatic </p>

<p>debate on Iraq which would take place on 6 March.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr Bradshaw stated that the UK’s “European allies very much share our concern </p>
<p>that Iraq should comply fully with its obligations under the United Nations resolutions to </p>
<p>allow weapons inspectors back into that country without any conditions attached”. If Iraq </p>
<p>failed to do that, the international community would:</p>
<p>“… face some very difficult decisions. Those who oppose in principle any talk of </p>
<p>a military response against countries such as Iraq in such circumstances need to </p>
<p>say how they would deal with rogue states determined to acquire weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and use them on their neighbours and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>197.  In an article published on 5 March, Mr Straw stated that if Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>refused to co-operate with weapons inspection, he would have to live with the </b></p>
<p><b>consequences.</b></p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Straw wrote an article, published in <i>The Times</i> on 5 March, stating: </p>
<p>“The stalemate between the United Nations and Iraq cannot go on for ever. For </p>
<p>more than a decade, Britain and the United States have led the UN’s efforts to </p>
<p>protect Iraq’s neighbours from aggression and protect the world from Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction.</p>
<p>“Iraq persistently flouts the authority of the UN Security Council and international </p>
<p>law … </p>
<p>“The threat from Iraq is not receding. Unique among the world tyrants, Saddam has </p>
<p>both the ruthlessness and capability to employ weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>199. </b> “The international community’s most pressing demand” was that Iraq should allow </p>
<p>UN officials to inspect its weapons programmes. </p>
<p><b>200. </b> The article concluded:</p>
<p>“We cannot allow Saddam to hold a gun to the heads of his own people, his </p>
<p>neighbours and the world for ever. Intense diplomatic efforts will continue, and I </p>
<p>hope they will achieve our aim of removing the threat which Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction pose to humanity. But if he refuses to open his weapons programmes to </p>
<p>proper international inspection, he will have to live with the consequences. </p>
<p>“No decisions have been taken, but let no one – especially Saddam – doubt </p>
<p>our resolve.”</p>

<p>in Section 4.1.</p>

<p><b>204. </b> The paper provided more detail on the arguments for addressing the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>as “a demonstrable threat to the stability of the region”, which Mr Straw had set out in </p>

<p>failure to comply with most of the 27 obligations imposed in UN resolutions, and criticism </p>
<p>of Iraq’s “notorious” human rights record.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>205. </b> In response to the question: “Are you preparing for military action against Iraq?”, </p>
<p>the paper stated: </p>
<p>“We cannot ignore the threat Iraq poses to the international community through its </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN had “demanded” in 1991 “that its representatives should be allowed into </p>
<p>Iraq to dismantle his weapons of mass destruction and ensure he did not replace </p>
<p>them” because Saddam had “used chemical weapons repeatedly against Iranian </p>
<p>soldiers”, and had used them “against his own citizens when he attacked Kurds </p>
<p>in northern Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN weapons inspectors had “discovered and destroyed thousands of </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons, including thousands of litres of anthrax and </p>
<p>48 missiles” before they had been “kicked out”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors were “convinced” that Saddam Hussein had “hidden other deadly </p>
<p>arsenals and the plants to manufacture more” but could not track them down </p>
<p>because of “almost daily obstruction”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was important to “remain vigilant” about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>If he was not restrained, “a volatile situation in the region could easily become a </p>
<p>world crisis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fact that Saddam Hussein had been contained “for so long” did not mean </p>
<p>the threat had gone away, he was “continuing his chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons programmes and … the long-range missiles to deliver them”. </p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“How we act is a matter for discussion … [I]t is in the interest of all to face up to </p>
<p>these threats with determination and resolve.</p>
<p>“… President Bush will consult widely with his allies. Saddam Hussein would be wise </p>
<p>not to mistake this for weakness. He should not underestimate the determination of </p>
<p>the international community to prevent him developing and using weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction.” </p>
<p><b>212.  The issue of possible UK support for US military action in Iraq was raised </b></p>
<p><b>in the House of Commons on 6 March. </b></p>
<p><b>213. </b> In the debate in Westminster Hall on 6 March Mr Tam Dalyell (Labour) and a number </p>
<p>of other MPs, including Mr Menzies Campbell (Liberal Democrat), expressed concerns </p>
<p>about the possibility of the UK Government supporting US military action in Iraq.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>214. </b> The issues raised included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need for Mr Blair to explain the policy to Parliament. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Force should not be used until everything possible had been done to avoid war. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Others beside Iraq were continuing to defy UN resolutions and acquire weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction without military action being taken.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was little domestic or international support for military action and a danger </p>
<p>of a backlash in Muslim states. </p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Nothing should be done without the full authority and approval of the UN. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military action should never be taken without clear and realistic political </p>
<p>objectives that were capable of achievement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The most immediate cause of instability in the Middle East was the escalating </p>
<p>violence between Israel and the Palestinians. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to win the peace as well as war which meant considering a </p>
<p>post-Saddam Hussein Iraq before acting.</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Other speakers were more supportive of military action, particularly if diplomatic </p>
<p>routes had been exhausted. </p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr George Howarth (Labour) asked if it “was possible to deal with rogue states </p>
<p>under the auspices of Security Council resolutions”, and whether Iraq was “a serious </p>
<p>enough threat to warrant the type of action that seems to be under consideration”.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> If </p>
<p>the United Nations was “to deserve and continue to enjoy a good level of support”, it </p>
<p>was “vitally important that Security Council resolutions are taken seriously and amount </p>
<p>to more than mere words on paper”. In his view there could be “no doubt” that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was “developing weapons of mass destruction of various kinds” and that “our </p>
<p>security is threatened by what might happen if no action is taken”. He had “no difficulty” </p>
<p>supporting the positions taken by Mr Blair and Mr Straw, including “if it became obvious </p>
<p>that an appropriate form of intervention was necessary”. In that event he advocated </p>
<p>a debate in which the case would be argued properly. There was “a case for action, </p>
<p>but it must be cautious, considered and carefully weighed”, and the House should be </p>
<p>consulted before action was taken.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> Mr Alan Duncan, the Opposition spokesman on Defence, stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq under Saddam Hussein had “refused to acknowledge international norms </p>
<p>or its own international agreements”, oppressed its own people, and appeared </p>
<p>“intent on developing weapons of mass destruction” that the UK would be </p>
<p>“naive” to see as “merely defensive”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The policy of containment had been followed “with some success” but it was </p>
<p>not enough on its own “to defeat the evil of the Iraqi regime and its weapons </p>
<p>programme”. He questioned whether it was “any longer realistic to pursue” </p>
<p>containment, and whether the policy was “sufficient to guarantee the safety and </p>
<p>security of Iraq’s immediate neighbours and the wider world”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In facing the “latent threat” from Iraq, “we should not rule out any course of </p>
<p>action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Conservative Members support the Prime Minister in his determination to tackle </p>
<p>the issue and not shy away from it, as some would wish. His full support for </p>
<p>President Bush shows an appreciation of the gravity of the issue and we await </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>424</p>
<p>the outcome of their talks … There is a clear and present danger and we must </p>
<p>face it.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein should tell the UN that he was prepared to admit inspection </p>
<p>teams and prove that was a realistic option.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Action in Iraq would be “on an altogether different scale” from Afghanistan. And </p>
<p>there would not be a rebel force “similar to the Northern Alliance” to take that </p>
<p>military action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein was to be toppled, there was a need to “be certain to win the </p>
<p>peace as well as any war”. That meant “considering a post-Saddam Iraq” before </p>
<p>acting, and considering “reconstruction, humanitarian aid and the massive </p>
<p>difficulty of filling the political vacuum left by the regime of a dictator”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Nor could there be any “support for any form of separation or any breakaway </p>
<p>state”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If, as he believed, the Government had “considered Iraq’s long-term </p>
<p>requirements” and should be supported, “Those who continue to argue that </p>
<p>containment is sufficient must answer the charge of naivety.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>218. </b> Responding to the points raised in the debate, Mr Bradshaw stated that there were </p>
<p>“no proposals, only speculation”.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> He agreed that everything possible should be done to </p>
<p>avoid military action. Mr Annan would be holding talks with Iraq in New York the following </p>
<p>day, but Mr Bradshaw said it remained to be seen if Iraq was serious. Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had embarked on charm offensives before and they had come to nothing. Iraq was “a </p>
<p>state sponsor of terrorism” but the main concern was “its determination to build weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and the threat it poses, not just to its neighbours, but to the rest of </p>
<p>the world”. The UK was actively pursuing diplomacy. In the “hypothetical circumstances” </p>
<p>of military action, the legal view was that Iraq was in “flagrant breach” of both UN </p>
<p>resolutions and the cease-fire agreement, “which made the cease-fire no longer valid”. </p>
<p>Iraq was “unique” in that it had used chemical weapons against its neighbours and its </p>
<p>own people. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> Mr Bradshaw added that all the Labour members who had spoken in the debate </p>
<p>opposing the Government’s policy had opposed the policy in Afghanistan and Kosovo: </p>
<p>“They were wrong then, and they are wrong now.”</p>
<p><b>220. </b> During Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) later that day, Ms Diane Abbott (Labour) </p>
<p>asked if Mr Blair was:</p>
<p>“… aware of the growing concern in the country that we may be moving by degrees </p>
<p>towards war with Iraq? Does he accept that in the event that British troops are sent </p>
<p>into action, there should be a debate and a vote on the Floor of the House?”</p>

<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The international community should proceed in a measured and </b></p>
<p><b>determined way to decide how to respond to the real threat represented </b></p>
<p><b>by the Iraqi regime. </b></p>

<p><b>227. </b> As agreed the previous week, Cabinet discussed Iraq on 7 March.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet that “in view of the current media speculation about military </p>
<p>action in Iraq, it was important to remind his colleagues of the background to the current </p>
<p>situation”. President Saddam Hussein had launched “an unprovoked invasion of Kuwait </p>
<p>in 1990”. Following his defeat in 1991, 27 separate obligations had been imposed on </p>
<p>Iraq by the UN Security Council; Saddam Hussein’s regime had met only three. The:</p>
<p>“… regime continued to pose a threat to peace through its development of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction (WMD) and the means to deliver them. United Nations weapons </p>
<p>inspectors had been forced to leave Iraq in 1998 because they were close to </p>
<p>exposing the full extent of … Saddam Hussein’s programmes. Iraq’s neighbours </p>
<p>were concerned about the threat to peace posed by … Saddam … but feared that </p>
<p>military action which did not result in his removal would strengthen his position.” </p>
<p><b>229. </b> Mr Straw continued:</p>
<p>“… sanctions imposed by the United Nations were not preventing food and other </p>
<p>humanitarian goods from reaching Iraq. Contracts to the value of $30 billion had </p>
<p>been approved under the Oil-for-Food programme … The United Kingdom alone </p>
<p>had given £100 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq. Negotiations were … in train </p>
<p>to change the sanctions regime so that, with the exception of those military and </p>

<p><b>230. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“No decision had been taken on launching further military action against the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime, but it was important to ensure that the British public and international </p>
<p>opinion understood the true nature of the threat posed by the regime and the need </p>
<p>to respond effectively.”</p>

<p>427</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Cabinet Ministers raised a number of points in the subsequent discussion, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“it was important to distinguish between the campaign against international </p>
<p>terrorism and efforts to address the threat to international peace posed by the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime’s continuing development of WMD”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “more difficult to convince the public of the need for military action” </p>
<p>in Iraq than it had been for Afghanistan. “It would be necessary to have a clear </p>
<p>legal basis for military action and to convince people that the situation had </p>
<p>deteriorated sufficiently to justify military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“any military action would create new tensions” in the UK, “particularly within the </p>
<p>Moslem community. The domestic impact of action would have to be weighed </p>
<p>carefully before any decisions were taken”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“it would be important to secure maximum international support … before any </p>
<p>military action took place. Western policy would have to be carefully calibrated to </p>
<p>convince President Saddam Hussein that military action would ensue if he failed </p>
<p>to comply with the United Nations Security Council resolutions, without making </p>
<p>such action inevitable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “military action in December 1998 [Operation Desert Fox], while meeting </p>
<p>the objectives set out by the Coalition at the time, had boosted … Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s reputation on the Arab Street. The Iraqi regime was a more formidable </p>
<p>opponent than the Taliban regime in Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“to isolate … Saddam Hussein” it would be “necessary to make progress </p>
<p>towards resolving the Israel/Palestine problem” to avoid accusations that </p>
<p>the West was “not being even handed”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Many people believed” that the US </p>
<p>Government was an “uncritical” supporter of the Government of Israel. Mr Blair </p>
<p>“could play a key role” in persuading the US to make clear that was not the case. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“… the concerns expressed in discussion were justified. It was important that the </p>
<p>United States did not appear to be acting unilaterally. It was critically important </p>
<p>to reinvigorate the Middle East Peace Process. Any military action taken against </p>
<p>President Saddam Hussein’s regime had to be effective. On the other hand, the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime was in clear breach of its obligations under several United Nations </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions. Its WMD programmes posed a threat to peace. Iraq’s </p>
<p>neighbours regarded President Saddam Hussein as a danger. The right strategy </p>
<p>was to engage closely with the Government of the United States in order to be in </p>
<p>a position to shape policy and its presentation. The international community should </p>
<p>proceed in a measured but determined way to decide how to respond to the real </p>
<p>threat represented by the Iraqi regime. No decisions to launch military action had </p>
<p>been taken and any action taken would be in accordance with international law.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>234. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell provided more detail of the discussion. The points </p>
<p>recorded by Mr Campbell included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blunkett had said “he didn’t feel there was much support [for where policy </p>
<p>on Iraq was going]”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Several Cabinet members thought the “real concern” was the Middle East Peace </p>
<p>Process.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Charles Clarke, Minister without Portfolio and Chairman of the Labour Party, </p>
<p>said the Labour Party “would support provided the case was real and properly </p>
<p>made”. In his view, judgement of the UK would rest on success or failure. People </p>
<p>“understood” Mr Blair’s “position of support in exchange for influence”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blunkett also “raised the international and legal basis for action”. Support </p>
<p>for [military intervention in] Kosovo and Afghanistan had been “pretty </p>
<p>overwhelming”, but “a military assault on Iraq would carry less weight. It would </p>
<p>depend on the role of the UN.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Cook described Saddam Hussein as “a psychopath” and stated that there </p>
<p>was “a fine balance” to strike on military action. Saddam would not listen to </p>
<p>Mr Annan unless he believed “there might be military action”. Mr Cook wasn’t </p>
<p>convinced that the [military] action [in December 1998] “had been productive”. </p>
<p>He “doubted whether it would be worth taking action” if Saddam was “still </p>
<p>standing at the end”, and Saddam would be “much cleverer than the Taliban”. </p>
<p>The best way of isolating Saddam would be progress on the MEPP. Mr Cook </p>
<p>also warned against allowing the UK to become isolated in Europe. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had said “people’s concern’s were justified. ‘I do want to assure you that </p>
<p>the management has not gone crazy.’ What are the dangers? US unilateralism. </p>
<p>Bush doing it for the wrong reasons. Lack of progress on the Middle East. Taking </p>
<p>action which proves to be ineffective.” The UK had to “try to influence and shape </p>
<p>US strategy. But we have to try to put ourselves in the right position. Get the </p>
<p>weapons inspectors back in … the only thing Saddam responds to was real fear. </p>
<p>If we had regime change it would make a huge difference to the whole region.”</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that it was the most important Cabinet discussion of </p>
<p>Iraq he had attended in 2002.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> It had lasted an hour and he had taken “seven and a bit </p>
<p>pages of notes … and Iraq occupied six and a bit pages”. Lord Wilson commented that </p>
<p>that was not bad “as a full discussion without papers”. He had gone “away feeling pretty </p>
<p>pleased. I thought ‘In my time as Cabinet Secretary I have seen the Cabinet begin to </p>
<p>play its role as I think the Cabinet should play its role.’” </p>
<p><b>236. </b> Cabinet had:</p>
<p>“… raised all sorts of issues, not political issues particularly, issues about the legal </p>
<p>position, about … what would be involved in military action, whether you could </p>

<p>succeed … about the importance of the United Nations, about the prior importance </p>
<p>of the Middle East Peace Process.” </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Lord Wilson also stated Mr Blair had finished the meeting by saying: “The concerns </p>
<p>expressed are justified. The management hasn’t gone crazy.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“… those are not the words of a man who has had the authority to proceed on </p>
<p>a course which is likely to lead to military action. It is about a Cabinet which has </p>
<p>expressed concern … They know that force is an essential ingredient in policy </p>
<p>on Iraq. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“ … and I think Robin Cook said that again, but the message was … they were </p>
<p>worried about the direction the US Administration was going and they wanted the </p>
<p>Prime Minister to use his power and influence to focus it on the United Nations, on </p>
<p>getting the inspectors back in and on giving Saddam Hussein a real fright to get him </p>
<p>to co-operate. They weren’t talking about military action … [T]he whole flavour … </p>
<p>was, ‘Any decisions on this are a long way away’ …”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Lord Wilson also explained that Mr Cook had made a number of points in January </p>
<p>1998, about the need to be “ready to use force if necessary, because not being ready … </p>
<p>would undermine leverage over Saddam Hussein; and … the United States were clear </p>
<p>they had legal authority to take action whereas our legal advice was more nuanced …  </p>
<p>[T]hose are things you could transpose” to March 2002.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that there was “great anxiety about the intentions of the </p>
<p>Bush Administration”.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Straw added that he “would have been fairly circumspect” about his own views </p>
<p>in the discussion.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> He would not “have spilled out all the things that I was saying to </p>
<p>the Prime Minister in private”, not least because he was “concerned about the matter </p>
<p>leaking”.</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Cabinet was not exactly divided but there was “a lot of </p>
<p>concern” about where policy on Iraq was going. It was not a “row” but it had immediately </p>
<p>been briefed to the press as one.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> The next day the papers were “full of division, threats </p>
<p>of resignation over Iraq”, which were “untrue”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>430</p>
<p><b>242. </b> In questions to Mr Cook later that day, Mr Dalyell asked for confirmation that the </p>
<p>House of Commons would be consulted before a commitment to military action, not </p>
<p>after.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> Mr Cook responded that Mr Blair had said no decision had been taken, and no </p>
<p>one anticipated one being taken in the near or medium future. Mr Cook added:</p>
<p>“Indeed, there is no timetable or process by which such a decision could be taken. </p>
<p>It would therefore be ludicrously premature … to commit myself to what the House </p>
<p>may do in the event of a hypothetical outcome that is not expected for many </p>
<p>months.”</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Douglas Hogg (Conservative) asked for an early debate on Iraq, the publication </p>
<p>of a document setting out “the chief areas of concern in the context of Iraq”, and that, </p>
<p>in the event of military action outside action in the No-Fly Zones, the House should be </p>
<p>given an opportunity to vote on a substantive motion.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Cook replied that a decision might never be taken. He added that the areas </p>
<p>of concern:</p>
<p>“… were well known and unarguable. The fact is that the Iraqi regime has several </p>
<p>thousand of unaccounted litres of toxic chemicals that would be appropriate to </p>
<p>use in a chemical weapon; it has made a considerable investment in developing </p>
<p>biological germ agents that could be used in biological weapons; and has proceeded </p>
<p>intensively – and appears to be continuing to do so – with medium-range missiles </p>
<p>that could deliver such warheads. In addition … Saddam Hussein used chemical </p>
<p>weapons … </p>
<p>“Given that history and the present record, it is entirely proper that the world should </p>
<p>take action through every available channel, starting with the United Nations to </p>
<p>ensure Saddam Hussein accepts what the rest of the world accepts: no regime </p>
<p>should have access to weapons of mass destruction unless it fully participates in </p>
<p>international regimes to control proliferation.”</p>
<p><b>245. </b> The following day, an article in <i>The Guardian</i> newspaper reported that, questioned </p>
<p>by reporters at his weekly meeting, Mr Cook had:</p>
<p>“… admitted that ‘many people sometimes have contradictory instincts on this. </p>
<p>Nobody likes military action.’</p>
<p>“… also praised the Labour rebels as MPs who include some with ‘long and </p>
<p>honourable records in opposing proliferation and demanding strong action’ against </p>
<p>transgressors. That may have been a hint to colleagues that they should not be </p>

<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>246. </b> The article also reported “Signs of real unease” had begun to emerge “last night” </p>
<p>about “the perceived hardening of Tony Blair’s opposition towards Iraq”. Officials had </p>
<p>described the discussion in Cabinet as a thoughtful and sombre discussion of the </p>
<p>options. Downing Street had denied that a Minister had spoken out against the military </p>
<p>option.</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that, the day after the 7 March Cabinet, reports of the </p>
<p>meeting “appeared in virtually every newspaper”.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> The reports were not very accurate, </p>
<p>but they had “caused huge ructions”.</p>
<p><b>248.  Given Mr Blair’s subsequent actions, the question of what Cabinet Members </b></p>
<p><b>understood they had endorsed is a matter of some importance.</b></p>
<p><b>249.  Cabinet minutes do not provide a verbatim record of the discussion in </b></p>
<p><b>Cabinet. Their purpose is to provide a record of the key points made and the </b></p>
<p><b>decisions taken. </b></p>
<p><b>250.  The discussion undoubtedly took place against a background of </b></p>
<p><b>considerable Parliamentary, public and media debate about possible US military </b></p>
<p><b>action to depose and replace Saddam Hussein and whether the UK would support </b></p>
<p><b>and participate in such action. </b></p>
<p><b>251.  In the previous week, both Mr Blair and Mr Straw had made public </b></p>
<p><b>statements that Iraq was a threat which had to be dealt with, and Mr Straw </b></p>
<p><b>reiterated to Cabinet the need for the British public and international opinion to </b></p>
<p><b>understand “the true nature of the threat posed by the [Iraqi] regime and the need </b></p>
<p><b>to respond effectively”. </b></p>
<p><b>252.  The discussion in Cabinet was couched in terms of Iraq’s need to comply </b></p>
<p><b>with its obligations and future choices by the international community on how </b></p>
<p><b>to respond to the threat which Iraq represented.</b></p>
<p><b>253.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw went to some lengths to assure their colleagues that </b></p>
<p><b>no decisions had been taken and Cabinet was not being asked to take decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>254.  Cabinet did endorse the conclusion that Iraq’s WMD programmes posed a </b></p>
<p><b>threat to peace and a strategy of engaging closely with the US Government in </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>255.  Mr Blair had committed the UK to support the US in the fight against </b></p>
<p><b>international terrorism, but given the absence of evidence of any Iraqi support </b></p>
<p><b>for Islamic extremists, it is hard to see how that would have applied to US policy </b></p>
<p><b>on Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>256.  There was no discussion of the nature of the strategy for dealing with Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>At that stage, Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon were yet to receive advice.</b></p>
<p><b>UN talks with Iraq, 7 March 2002</b></p>
<p>The UN and Iraq held their first talks for more than a year on the possible return of </p>
<p>weapons inspectors, when Mr Annan met Mr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister on </p>
<p>7 March 2002, before a meeting with experts.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>The talks were described as exploratory and neither side predicted an immediate </p>
<p>breakthrough. They ended with agreement to a further round of talks in April.</p>
<p>Mr Annan told journalists that the talks were an effort to prevent a new Middle East </p>
<p>war and that he “didn’t want to see a widening conflict in the region”.</p>
<p>The Iraqis made no specific commitments to co-operate with UN resolutions and </p>
<p>posed 19 questions about US/UK policies. The majority were about clarification of </p>
<p>resolution 1284.</p>

<p><b>The Cabinet Office ‘Iraq: Options Paper’ </b></p>

<p>433</p>
<p><b>261. </b> The Cabinet Office paper described the UK’s policy objectives on Iraq as:</p>
<p>“Within our objectives of preserving peace and stability in the Gulf and ensuring </p>
<p>energy security, our current objectives towards Iraq are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reintegration of a law-abiding Iraq, which does not possess WMD or </p>
<p>threaten its neighbours, into the international community. Implicitly, this </p>
<p>cannot occur with Saddam in power; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hence as the least worst option, we have supported containment of Iraq, by </p>
<p>constraining Saddam’s ability to re-arm or build up WMD and to threaten his </p>
<p>neighbours. </p>
<p>Subsidiary objectives are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preserving the territorial integrity of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the humanitarian situation of the Iraqi people;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>protecting the Kurds in northern Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>sustaining UK/US co-operation, including, if necessary, by moderating </p>
<p>US policy; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining the credibility and authority of the Security Council.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>262. </b> The Cabinet Office paper provided an analysis, drawing on recent JIC </p>
<p>Assessments, of the existing policy of<b> </b>containment, which it described as having been </p>
<p>“partially successful”. The policy had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>effectively frozen Iraq’s nuclear programme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prevented Iraq from rebuilding its conventional arsenal to pre-Gulf war levels;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>severely restricted Iraq’s ballistic missile programmes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hindered Iraq’s biological and chemical weapons programmes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>given some protection to the Kurds and the Shia through the operation of the </p>
<p>No-Fly Zones; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam was not seriously threatening his neighbours.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Despite containment, there was considerable oil and other smuggling; Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein led a brutal regime and provided a rallying point for anti-western sentiment, </p>
<p>which was a cause of instability.</p>

<p>434</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Reflecting the JIC Assessment of 27 February, that Iraq continued to pursue the </p>
<p>development of weapons of mass destruction, the Cabinet Office paper stated that </p>
<p>Iraq continued “to develop WMD, although our intelligence is poor”. There was no </p>
<p>greater threat now that Saddam would use WMD than there had been in recent years. </p>
<p>Current intelligence was “insufficiently robust” to convince the P5 and the majority of the </p>
<p>Security Council that Iraq was in breach of its obligations; the proof would need to be </p>
<p>“incontrovertible and of large-scale activity to meet that criterion”. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> The JIC Assessments of Iraq’s ability and intent to pursue weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction programmes, and the robustness of their judgements, is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 4.1. </p>
<p><b>267.  An improved containment policy would make a sanctions regime more </b></p>
<p><b>attractive and reduce Iraq’s illicit revenues. The return of the inspectors would </b></p>
<p><b>also allow greater scrutiny of Iraq’s WMD programme and security forces.</b></p>
<p><b>268.  The US had, however, lost confidence in the policy. </b></p>
<p><b>269. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated that a policy to toughen containment would </p>
<p>comprise:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>full implementation of all relevant Security Council resolutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>introduction of the revised sanctions regime and a Goods Review List in May </p>
<p>as envisaged in resolution 1382 (2001);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarification of the modalities of resolution 1284 (1999) with a specific demand </p>
<p>that Iraq re-admit UN inspectors with the aim of telling Saddam Hussein to admit </p>
<p>inspectors or face the risk of military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pushing for tougher action, especially by the US, against states breaking </p>
<p>sanctions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining the present military posture, including in the No-Fly Zones, and </p>
<p>being prepared robustly to respond to any Iraqi adventurism; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to make clear “without overtly espousing regime change” the view </p>
<p>that Iraq would be better off without Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Toughening containment would put pressure on Saddam Hussein. The Goods </p>
<p>Review List would make the sanctions regime more attractive. Better implementation </p>
<p>of sanctions would reduce Iraq’s illicit revenues. The return of inspectors would allow </p>
<p>greater scrutiny of Iraq’s WMD programme and security forces. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> Some of the difficulties with the existing policy would, however, still apply. They </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tougher containment would not reintegrate Iraq into the international community </p>
<p>as it offered little prospect of removing Saddam Hussein.</p>

<p>Iraq had progressively increased its international engagement and while the </p>
<p>GRL might make sanctions more sustainable, the sanctions regime could </p>
<p>collapse in the long term.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those states in breach of sanctions would want compensation.</p>

<p>Saddam Hussein was only likely to permit the return of inspectors if he believed </p>
<p>the threat of large scale US military action was imminent; and that such </p>
<p>concessions would prevent the US from acting.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was likely then to play for time, embarking on a renewed policy </p>
<p>of non-co-operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “contract with the Iraqi people” would need “some detailed work” to be “at all </p>
<p>credible”.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> The US had lost confidence in containment. Some in the US Administration wanted </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein removed. The success of Operation Enduring Freedom (the US </p>
<p>military operation in Afghanistan), distrust of UN sanctions and inspection regimes, and </p>
<p>unfinished business from 1991 were all identified as factors. </p>
<p><b>273.  The Cabinet Office paper identified two possible types of future regime </b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>a government led by a Sunni military strongman; or </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>a Sunni-led representative and broadly democratic government.</b></p>
<p><b>274.  The second option would require the commitment of the US and others </b></p>
<p><b>to nation-building for many years. </b></p>
<p><b>275. </b> The paper stated that the UK should consider what sort of Iraq it wanted. It </p>
<p>identified two possibilities:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “Sunni military strong man” who would be likely to maintain Iraqi territorial </p>
<p>integrity. That might allow military forces to “withdraw quickly”. While outside </p>
<p>assistance might be “traded” with assurances on WMD programmes and respect </p>
<p>for human rights, there would be a strong risk of the Iraqi system reverting to </p>
<p>type with a series of military coups until a Sunni dictator emerged who protected </p>
<p>Sunni interests and with time could acquire WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “representative, broadly democratic government”, which would be Sunni-led </p>
<p>but within a federal structure which gave the Kurds guaranteed autonomy and </p>
<p>the Shia fair access to government. Such a government was judged to be less </p>
<p>likely to develop WMD and threaten its neighbours. But it would require the US </p>
<p>and others to commit to nation-building for many years and entail a substantial </p>
<p>international security force and help with reconstruction. The paper did not </p>
<p>address how a broadly representative government would not be Shia-led. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>436</p>
<p><b>276. </b> The paper noted that even a representative government could seek to acquire </p>
<p>WMD and build up its conventional forces, as long as Iran and Israel retained their WMD </p>
<p>and conventional armouries.</p>
<p><b>277.  The Cabinet Office paper stated that the only certain means to remove </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein and his elite was to invade and impose a new government. That </b></p>
<p><b>would be a new departure which would require the construction of a coalition and </b></p>
<p><b>a legal justification.</b></p>
<p><b>278. </b> Examining the internal position in Iraq, the paper stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the current circumstances, a military revolt or coup is a remote possibility.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Unaided, the Iraqi opposition is incapable of overthrowing the regime. The </p>
<p><b>external opposition</b> is weak, divided and lacks domestic credibility. The </p>
<p>predominant group is the Iraqi National Congress (INC) … The other major </p>
<p>group, the Iraqi National Accord (INA) espouses moderate Arab socialism and </p>
<p>is led by another Shia, Ayad Allawi. Neither group has a military capability, and </p>
<p>both are badly penetrated by Iraqi intelligence …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The <b>internal opposition</b> is small and fractured on ethnic and sectarian </p>
<p>grounds. There is no effective <b>Sunni-Arab </b>opposition. There are 3-4m <b>Kurds</b> </p>
<p>in northern Iraq … divided between two main parties, the Patriotic Union of </p>
<p>Kurdistan (PUK) and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). These groups have </p>
<p>an interest in preserving the status quo, and are more interested in seeking </p>
<p>advantage over the other than allying against Saddam …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Kurds do not co-operate with the <b>Shia-Arabs</b> who form 60 percent of the </p>
<p>population … Most Shia would like to have a greater say in Iraqi government, </p>
<p>but not necessarily control: they do not want secession, Islamic autonomy or </p>
<p>Iranian influence.”</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Three options for achieving regime change by military means were identified, </p>
<p>which were described as “a new departure which would require the construction of a </p>
<p>coalition and a legal justification”. Those were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Covert support to opposition groups, internal revolt by the Kurds and Shia, and </p>
<p>the defection, or at least acquiescence, of large sections of the Army. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An air campaign providing overt support to opposition groups, leading to a coup </p>
<p>or uprising. Pressure on the regime could be increased by massing ground and </p>
<p>naval forces and threatening a land invasion. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A full-scale ground offensive to destroy Saddam Hussein’s military machine and </p>
<p>remove him from power. An invasion would need to be preceded by a major </p>
<p>air offensive to soften up Iraq’s defences and be sufficient to pose a credible </p>
<p>threat to Baghdad to persuade members of the Sunni military elite that their </p>
<p>survival was better served by deserting to the coalition than staying loyal to </p>
<p>Saddam. That would require fewer forces than Operation Desert Storm because </p>

<p>437</p>
<p>Iraqi forces were considerably weaker than they had been in 1991. The paper </p>
<p>added: “The greater investment of western forces, the greater our control of </p>
<p>Iraq’s future, but the greater the cost and the longer we would need to stay. The </p>
<p>only certain means to remove Saddam and his elite is to invade and impose a </p>
<p>new government, but this could involve nation building over many years.” For </p>
<p>logistical reasons, a ground campaign would not be feasible until autumn 2002. </p>
<p><b>280. </b> The three options were not “mutually exclusive”. The first had a very low prospect </p>
<p>of success and the second had no guarantee of success, but either or both would be </p>
<p>“natural precursors” to the third.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> While bases in only a few countries would be essential for a successful invasion, </p>
<p>a wider and durable international coalition would be advantageous for both military and </p>
<p>political reasons. Securing moderate Arab support would be greatly assisted by the </p>
<p>promise of a quick and decisive campaign, and credible action by the US to address </p>
<p>the MEPP. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Any coalition would need much tending over the difficult months of preparation:</p>
<p>“Iran, fearing further US encirclement and that it will be invaded next, will be prickly </p>
<p>but is likely to remain neutral. With his regime in danger, Saddam could use WMD, </p>
<p>either before or during an invasion. Saddam could also target Israel as he did during </p>
<p>the Gulf war. Restraining Israel will be difficult. It could try to pre-empt a WMD attack </p>
<p>and has certainly made clear that it would retaliate. Direct Israeli military involvement </p>
<p>in Iraq would greatly complicate coalition management and risk sparking conflict </p>
<p>more widely.”</p>
<p><b>283. </b> The paper stated: </p>
<p>“At this stage we need to wait and see which options or combination of options may </p>
<p>be favoured by the US Government.” </p>
<p><b>284.  No legal justification for an invasion currently existed.</b></p>
<p><b>285. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated:</p>
<p>“A legal justification for invasion would be needed. Subject to Law Officers advice, </p>
<p>none currently exists. This makes moving quickly to invade very difficult. We should </p>
<p>therefore consider a staged approach, establishing international support, building </p>
<p>up the pressure on Saddam, and developing military plans. There is a lead time of </p>
<p>about 6 months to a ground offensive.” </p>
<p><b>286. </b> A separate paper prepared by FCO Legal Advisers, ‘Iraq: Legal Background’, </p>
<p>circulated as an annex to the Cabinet Office paper, set out the general legal background, </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>438</p>
<p>Iraq’s obligations in the relevant Security Council resolutions, and the potential </p>
<p>difficulties in relying in 2002 on existing resolutions to support the further use of force.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>287. </b> As well as examining the legal base for the No-Fly Zones, the Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions relevant to the sanctions regime and resolution 1284 which had established </p>
<p>UNMOVIC, the FCO addressed three possible bases under international law whereby </p>
<p>the use of force could be authorised in relation to the circumstances of Iraq. It stated that </p>
<p>two of the bases – self-defence and humanitarian intervention – were not applicable at </p>
<p>that time. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> The third potential legal base was the possibility that the authorisation to use force </p>
<p>in resolution 678 (1990) could be revived. That had happened in the past, most recently </p>
<p>when Iraq refused to co-operate with the UNSCOM in 1997 and 1998. A series of </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions had condemned Iraq. </p>
<p><b>289. </b> Resolution 1205 (1998) had condemned Iraq’s decision to end all co-operation </p>
<p>with UNSCOM as a “flagrant violation” of Iraq’s obligations under resolution 687 (1991), </p>
<p>and restated that effective operation of UNSCOM was essential for the implementation </p>
<p>of that resolution. In the UK’s view, that had had the effect of reviving the authorisation </p>
<p>to use force in resolution 678. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> In a letter to the President of the Security Council in 1998, the UK had “stated </p>
<p>that the objective of Operation Desert Fox was to seek compliance by Iraq with the </p>
<p>obligations laid down by the Council, that the operation was undertaken only when it </p>
<p>became apparent that there was no other way of achieving compliance by Iraq, and </p>
<p>that the action was limited to what was necessary to secure this objective”.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>291. </b> The revival argument and the UK’s position during the 1990s are set out in </p>
<p>Section 5.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> The FCO drew attention to potential difficulties in relying on existing Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions to support further use of force in 2002: </p>
<p>“The more difficult issue is whether we are still able to rely on the same legal base </p>
<p>for the use of force more than three years after the adoption of resolution 1205. </p>
<p>Military action in 1998 (and on previous occasions) followed on from specific </p>
<p>decisions of the Council; there has now not been any significant decision by the </p>
<p>Council since 1998. Our interpretation of resolution 1205 was controversial anyway; </p>
<p>many of our partners did not think the legal basis was sufficient as the authority </p>

<p>to use force was not explicit. Reliance on it now would be unlikely to receive </p>
<p>any support.”</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>293. </b> The FCO also identified a difference in the view of the UK and US about the role of </p>
<p>the Security Council in determining any breach of the cease-fire enshrined in resolution </p>
<p>687 (1991). It stated:</p>
<p>“As the cease-fire was proclaimed by the Council … it is for the Council to assess </p>
<p>whether any breach of those obligations has occurred. The US have a rather </p>
<p>different view: they maintain that the assessment of a breach is for individual </p>
<p>Member States. We are not aware of any other State which supports this view.”</p>
<p><b>294. </b> In relation to the possible legal grounds for the use of force set out in the FCO </p>
<p>note, Sir Michael Wood, the FCO Legal Adviser from 1999 to 2006, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think the legal position was pretty straightforward and pretty uncontroversial. </p>
<p>The first possible basis would be self-defence and it was clear to all the lawyers </p>
<p>concerned that … a factual basis for self-defence was not present unless </p>
<p>circumstances changed … </p>
<p>“The second possibility would have been the exceptional right to use force in the </p>
<p>case of an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. This was the Kosovo argument, </p>
<p>the argument we used in 1999, and also used for the No-Fly Zones. Apart from the </p>
<p>No-Fly Zones, it was clear that there was no basis, using that rather controversial </p>
<p>argument, for the use of force in 2001/2002. </p>
<p>“So that left the third possible basis, which was with authorisation by the Security </p>
<p>Council. There we had had a series of resolutions culminating in 1205 of 1998, </p>
<p>which was seen as the basis for Operation Desert Fox … so there was a slight </p>
<p>question whether that finding of a serious breach still had some force. </p>
<p>“But I think all the lawyers who looked at it … were very clearly of the view that it </p>
<p>was not, and that if we sought to rely on that resolution of some years before, we </p>
<p>wouldn’t have a leg to stand on.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>295. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated that for the P5 and the majority of the Security </p>
<p>Council to take the view that Iraq was in breach of the cease-fire provisions of resolution </p>
<p>687 (1991):</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they would need to be convinced that Iraq was in breach of its obligations </p>
<p>regarding WMD, and ballistic missiles. Such proof would need to be </p>
<p>incontrovertible and of large-scale activity. Current intelligence is insufficiently </p>
<p>robust to meet this criterion …; or</p>

<p><b>300. </b> The elements of a staged approach comprised:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>winding up the pressure: increasing the pressure on Saddam through tougher </p>
<p>containment. Stricter implementation of sanctions and a military build-up will </p>
<p>frighten his regime. A refusal to admit UN inspectors, or their admission and </p>
<p>subsequent likely frustration, which resulted in an appropriate finding by the </p>
<p>Security Council, could provide the justification for military action. Saddam would </p>
<p>try to prevent this, although he has miscalculated before;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>302. </b> The Cabinet Office also provided a paper, produced by the FCO, on the attitudes </p>
<p>of selected third countries, which is addressed in the Box below.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>Attitudes of selected third countries, March 2002</b></p>
<p>The March 2002 FCO paper on the attitudes of selected third countries to military action </p>
<p>in Iraq stated that countries were more likely to be supportive, “or at least neutral or less </p>
<p>hostile” if:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>some attempt is made to build UN legitimacy, ie a real effort to get the inspectors </p>
<p>in; public presentation of the WMD evidence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US are seen to be making a major effort to revive the MEPP;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>(with allies) there is genuine consultation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US show that this time they are serious about getting rid of Saddam and </p>
<p>have a plan that will work;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the economic concerns of neighbouring states will be taken into account;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they are convinced that the day-after questions are being addressed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the campaign has good prospects of being short as well as successful.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>The FCO assessed that, of the Permanent Members of the Security Council:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France would be “difficult but not impossible to bring on board”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia would be looking for “an economic quid pro quo (on debt and future </p>
<p>business in Iraq)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>China’s interest in improving relations with the US “may overcome its traditional </p>
<p>opposition to interference in other countries’ affairs”.</p>
<p>The FCO also advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the absence of progress on the MEPP, Arab states would have “the greatest </p>
<p>difficulties” in supporting an operation perceived to be serving Israeli interests. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Turkey would want to know that the US was “focused on maintaining a </p>
<p>centralised, secular Iraqi government” and would not want to be the only Islamic </p>
<p>country supporting the US.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Jordan could find itself under the greatest pressure if military action went ahead </p>
<p>given its economic dependence on Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Public criticism but private neutrality” was probably the best that could be hoped </p>
<p>for from Iran.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Overt Israeli support would be counterproductive.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the EU, France and Germany could probably be brought onside “with </p>
<p>careful attention from Washington and depending on the degree of UN cover”. </p>
<p>Overt criticism was more likely from Italy. Spain did not want an open breach </p>
<p>with the US.</p>

<p>THE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE CABINET OFFICE ‘OPTIONS PAPER’ </p>
<p><b>305.  The Cabinet Office ‘Options Paper’ was prepared as a background paper. </b></p>
<p><b>It contained no recommendation, and did not represent agreed inter-departmental </b></p>
<p><b>advice for Ministers. </b></p>
<p><b>306.  The paper was seen by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon and, later, by Mr Brown; but </b></p>
<p><b>it was not approved by them or discussed collectively. </b></p>
<p><b>307.  No further cross-departmental analysis and advice on the policy options was </b></p>

<p><b>308. </b> Following discussions with the FCO and MOD, Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head </p>

<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>309. </b> Mr Drummond had identified two options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Continuing containment by tightening the No-Fly Zones and destroying Iraq’s </p>
<p>new air defence system; pursuing the revised sanctions regime; and moving </p>
<p>towards clarification of resolution 1284, including being prepared to respond </p>
<p>militarily if there were major finds or the inspectors’ work was frustrated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Going “for the military option now”. That could involve either “bomb plus </p>
<p>stimulate an uprising in the South and/or Kurdish areas”, which the FCO did </p>
<p>not think would get rid of Saddam, or “bomb and invade”.</p>
<p><b>310. </b> Mr Drummond stated that the revised sanctions regime would have “limited </p>

<p>“The US position is critical. There is plenty of press speculation and third hand </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>444</p>
<p><b>319. </b> A minute from Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, </p>
<p>recorded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ‘Options Paper’, and the (Assessments Staff) paper on WMD Programmes </p>
<p>of Concern, had been submitted by Mr Ricketts to Mr Straw on 8 March. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had asked for a meeting with officials to discuss “all this” and for </p>
<p>details of what happened in 1998, “particularly the sequence of events … what </p>
<p>was, in Washington’s view, the legal base for a strike on Iraq … [and] more detail </p>
<p>about the Iraqi National Congress”.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr Straw’s comments on the draft WMD paper and his role in its development are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><b>321. </b> In late March, as agreed between Mr Blair and Mr Brown, Mr Rycroft sent </p>
<p>Mr Brown’s Private Office a copy of the “latest version” of the Cabinet Office ‘Options </p>
<p>Paper’ and the draft paper for publication on WMD “strictly for the Chancellor </p>
<p>personally”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>322. </b> The letter also drew Mr Brown’s attention to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the JIC Assessment of 27 February, ‘Iraq: Saddam Under the Spotlight’;</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the CIG Assessment of 15 March, ‘The Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>323. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that the papers were “designed to prepare the </p>
<p>Prime Minister for discussions with the President”.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that he had not been directly involved in the production </p>
<p>of the ‘Options Paper’; his focus had been on the implications of 9/11, and “there </p>
<p>wasn’t really a great deal of capacity certainly inside the Secretariat to think seriously </p>
<p>about Iraq”.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>325. </b> Mr McKane stated that, by that time it had been “clear that the US Government </p>
<p>is shifting its sights towards Iraq and that the policy we had adopted in the spring of </p>
<p>the previous year is not really producing the results that had been hoped for it”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>‘Options Paper’ did not “express an opinion on whether we should stick with containment </p>
<p>or a tougher form of containment or should start to shift more towards looking at regime </p>
<p>change and military intervention”. </p>

<p>445</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that the Cabinet Office ‘Options Paper’: </p>
<p>“… was prepared in the same kind of way as the previous one; that is a framework </p>
<p>for the paper was produced and different elements were commissioned from </p>
<p>different Whitehall departments … It went through a number of drafts and was </p>
<p>finalised in early March.”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>327. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that the initiative for the Cabinet Office paper </p>
<p>had arisen from a discussion he had had with Mr McKane; and that it was “just </p>
<p>a contingency”.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>328. </b> Lord Wilson could not remember the precise origins of the paper: </p>
<p>“All I can tell you now is that the idea of this paper was raised … and … I thought </p>
<p>it was timely … We had not been looking at Iraq for a while. We used to do regular </p>
<p>reviews of policy on Iraq and I thought it was about time we did another … I am not </p>
<p>sure if No.10 knew or not …” </p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>329. </b> Later in the hearing, Lord Wilson added:</p>
<p>“Ever the optimist, I had rather hoped we would show the options paper to the </p>
<p>Prime Minister or to No.10 … and get a meeting of DOP on it. Forlorn hope. I asked </p>
<p>after a while … and I had been told that it had been wrapped up in the briefing for </p>
<p>Crawford.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The Inquiry sought additional evidence from the two members of Mr McKane’s </p>
<p>staff who had written the Cabinet Office paper. They were asked about the process for </p>
<p>producing the paper, the basis for the judgements made, and what changes were made </p>
<p>as a result of Sir David Manning’s meeting and who was responsible for the advice that </p>
<p>led to those changes.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> In a statement for the Inquiry, Mr Drummond wrote: “From 9/11 until February </p>
<p>2002, Afghanistan and other post 9/11 counter terrorism issues took a higher priority </p>
<p>than Iraq in the Secretariat’s work.”</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> Mr McKane had handed over responsibility for </p>
<p>co-ordination of policy on Iraq to him around the end of 2001. </p>
<p><b>332. </b> Describing the production of the paper, Mr Drummond wrote that, by mid-February, </p>
<p>Mr Blair had been expected to have “a preliminary discussion” on Iraq during his meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush in early April. Mr Drummond’s recollection was that “the Secretariat </p>
<p>had offered to produce an options paper as background”. The paper had to be prepared </p>
<p>quickly in time for Mr Blair’s return from the Commonwealth Heads of Government </p>
<p>Meeting which ended on 5 March. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>446</p>
<p><b>333. </b> Drafts were commissioned at a meeting on 21 February from the:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>FCO on policy objectives towards Iraq and the wider region, a tightened policy </p>
<p>of containment, and legal advice on regime change;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD on the military options for regime change; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIS on possible successor regimes.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> A draft paper had been circulated on 28 February for a discussion on 1 March and </p>
<p>a further draft on 5 March for discussion the same day. </p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr Drummond had chaired the two discussions but he was unable to recall them </p>
<p>in any detail and the files did not contain records of the contributions or what was </p>
<p>discussed:</p>
<p>“The paper clearly drew on the JIC and Assessments Staff judgements about the </p>
<p>likelihood of Saddam having WMD and that his regime was unlikely to be removed </p>
<p>by internal opposition … There was debate about continuing containment and that </p>
<p>is recorded in the paper as an option, before considering regime change and the </p>
<p>options for how that could be achieved.” </p>
<p><b>336. </b> Mr Drummond added:</p>
<p>“As a background paper, no recommendations were made and … it was submitted </p>
<p>as being in close consultation with FCO, MOD, SIS and the Assessment Staff rather </p>
<p>than agreed word for word with them.”</p>
<p><b>337. </b> After Sir David Manning’s meeting on 7 March, Mr Drummond had “made some </p>
<p>changes … after further consultation” with the FCO, MOD and SIS, which “covered the </p>
<p>difficulty of identifying successor regimes, that it was unlikely Iraq would disintegrate”, </p>
<p>and changes clarifying the legal advice. </p>
<p><b>338. </b> Mr Drummond concluded:</p>
<p>“At the time of drafting, we expected this paper to be the first of several that would </p>
<p>help Ministers to reach conclusions on policy towards Iraq and hoped that there </p>
<p>would be discussion with them.” </p>
<p><b>339. </b> In his statement, Mr Tom Dodd, who was a desk officer in OD Sec, wrote that he </p>
<p>was the principal drafter of the paper.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> He made similar points to Mr Drummond about </p>
<p>the process, with more detail of the individuals and Departments with whom Mr Dodd </p>
<p>had held bilateral discussions.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> The judgements in the paper “drew on the collective wisdom of the time, informed </p>
<p>by JIC judgements of the state of the threat posed by Saddam Hussein”. The policy </p>
<p>judgements had been “formulated in the first instance” by himself and Mr Drummond, </p>

<p>then “endorsed or mutated in group discussion”. Sir David Manning had suggested </p>
<p>some changes to the draft paper, but “they were not major”.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Mr Dodd remembered:</p>
<p>“… spending some time debating as a group the final wording of the statement </p>
<p>‘the use of overriding force in a ground campaign is the only option that we can be </p>
<p>confident will remove Saddam and bring Iraq back into the international community’.” </p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s request to be kept informed</b></p>
<p><b>342.  Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, asked in early March to be involved in </b></p>
<p><b>Ministerial thinking about Iraq as policy was being formulated not just to be asked </b></p>
<p><b>for his advice at the last minute.</b></p>
<p><b>343. </b> On 8 March, Mr Paul Berman, a member of the Attorney General’s Office, </p>
<p>contacted the Cabinet Office to say that Lord Goldsmith had seen the previous week’s </p>
<p>Cabinet Conclusions and would hope to be involved in Ministerial thinking about Iraq as </p>
<p>policy was being formulated rather than be consulted formally only at the last minute.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Mr McKane, explained to Mr Berman that Mr Blair had made clear to Cabinet that </p>
<p>decisions on military action were not imminent; and that it was “well understood” that </p>
<p>the Attorney General would need to be “properly engaged at the right time” but that was </p>
<p>“most unlikely to be before the Prime Minister’s meeting with President Bush”.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr McKane advised Sir David Manning that he thought there was:</p>
<p>“… a good case for engaging the Attorney General in a discussion, so that he </p>
<p>understands the options and the policy background, before he is asked formally </p>
<p>for advice. Intriguingly Paul Berman said that the Attorney General did not rule out </p>
<p>justification for military action based on Article 51 (self defence) but would certainly </p>
<p>want to be assured that the alternatives (UN Security Council resolutions) had been </p>
<p>thoroughly explored in the first instance.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Sir David Manning replied to Mr McKane: “I think we should engage the Attorney </p>
<p>after the Texan [Crawford] summit.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>347. </b> In a minute to Lord Goldsmith, Mr Berman recorded that he had told Mr McKane </p>
<p>that Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… wanted to be in a position to engage constructively with this issue. This meant </p>
<p>keeping you in the loop from a very early stage, as policy was being formulated, </p>

<p>discuss these matters with Ministerial colleagues.”</p>
<p> 128</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Mr Berman also wrote that he had “recalled (and Mr McKane agreed) that the legal </p>
<p>basis for the use of force in 1998 had been very difficult and contentious. Any proposed </p>
<p>recourse to the inherent right of self-defence would also be far from straightforward.” </p>
<p><b>349. </b> Mr Berman had contacted Mr Michael Wood, the FCO Legal Adviser, who told him </p>
<p>that a policy paper had already been submitted to No.10 but he (Mr Wood) could not </p>
<p>send Mr Berman a copy. Mr Wood had provided a copy of the FCO paper (‘Iraq: Legal </p>
<p>background’). Mr Berman had “underlined to Mr Wood the importance of ensuring that </p>
<p>LSLO [Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers] was fully kept in … the loop – in relation to </p>
<p>the development of policy as well as any comments on the legal issues”.</p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S MEETING WITH VICE PRESIDENT CHENEY, 11 MARCH 2002</p>
<p><b>350.  The FCO briefing for Mr Blair’s meeting with Vice President Cheney </b></p>
<p><b>suggested that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair should state that the UK supported the US objective of regime </b></p>

<p>• </p>
<p><b>It would be important to alert a sceptical world to the threat posed by Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>351. </b> The FCO briefing for Mr Blair’s meeting with Vice President Cheney covered a </p>
<p>range of issues but Iraq was identified as:</p>
<p>“… the main issue, including for the media given speculation that the US are moving </p>
<p>towards early decisions on military action … This will … be an important opportunity </p>
<p>… to get a feel for where the debate in Washington stands and what options are </p>
<p>emerging.” </p>
<p>129</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>352. </b> The FCO suggested that the key messages for Mr Cheney on Iraq were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In complete agreement on objective. World a better place without Saddam </p>
<p>in power. Need to ratchet up the pressure on Iraq.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Containment policy has had some success … Climate post 11 September </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Military action requires key allies, particularly in the region, to be on board. </p>
<p>That is why we see continuing with the UN route – i.e. ratcheting up pressure on </p>
<p>Iraq to comply with UN resolutions and allow weapons inspectors back in as a </p>
<p>necessary precursor. We doubt Saddam will co-operate but we must be seen to </p>
<p>have tried.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Also essential to alert sceptical world to the WMD threat … We are working on </p>
<p>evidence paper.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Meanwhile … should continue our efforts to get GRL implemented – will remind </p>
<p>international community that our quarrel is not with the Iraqi people.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… Introduction of revised sanctions regime will send an important signal of </p>
<p>Security Council unanimity. Thereafter focus will be on clarification of UNSCR </p>
<p>1284. We should use this to put pressure on Saddam to readmit inspections.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Consistent message we are getting from region and beyond is that if it is </p>
<p>decided to launch military action, that action must succeed in removing Saddam, </p>
<p>otherwise we will be worse off than we are now.” </p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>353.  Mr Blair told Vice President Cheney on 11 March that it was “highly desirable </b></p>

<p><b>354.  That meant building up the case against Saddam carefully and intelligently; </b></p>
<p><b>putting him in the wrong place over inspections and compliance with UN Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council resolutions; and thereby helping to convince “international opinion to </b></p>
<p><b>rally to the idea of regime change” and avoiding unintended consequences.</b></p>
<p><b>355.  Mr Blair’s approach reflected a deliberate choice that the right way to </b></p>
<p><b>get close to the US in order to influence it was to offer the UK’s support for its </b></p>
<p><b>objectives.</b></p>
<p><b>356.  In his public statement after the meeting, Mr Blair emphasised that no </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>357. </b> The record of the meeting between Mr Blair and Vice President Cheney confirms </p>
<p>that most of the discussion addressed US concerns, in the context of Al Qaida’s pursuit </p>
<p>of WMD, about the need for action to deal with the threat posed by Iraq and the potential </p>
<p>link between terrorism and WMD.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Blair confirmed that “it was highly desirable to get rid of Saddam”; and that:</p>
<p>“Arguing that this was in the interests of regional stability was probably a better </p>
<p>line even than the threat from WMD … The UK would help … as long as there was </p>
<p>a clever strategy, and one that worked. This meant building up the case against </p>
<p>Saddam carefully and intelligently. </p>
<p>“… If action was taken suddenly against Saddam now, the international community </p>
<p>would ask what had changed. It was important to take enough time to put Saddam </p>
<p>in the wrong place over inspections and compliance with UNSCRs. This would play </p>
<p>an important part in convincing international opinion to rally to the idea of regime </p>
<p>change.</p>
<p>“… we also needed a proper strategy for dealing with the Iraqi opposition. </p>
<p>“… We should also concentrate much more on the appalling nature of Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime. </p>
<p>“… As far as military strategy was concerned, we must ensure that our forces were </p>
<p>equipped to finish the job quickly and successfully … the Arab world … did not want </p>
<p>a campaign launched against him [Saddam] unless we were determined to see it </p>
<p>through to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>“… it was particularly important to guard against the law of unintended </p>
<p>consequences … We must ensure that a campaign to bring about regime change </p>
<p>in Iraq did not inadvertently destabilise other countries in the Middle East. The Arab </p>
<p>street was very angry … We needed to generate a sense that we were determined </p>
<p>to promote a peace process that would give justice to the Palestinians … If this </p>
<p>problem were not tackled successfully, it would dominate the way that the Arabs </p>
<p>thought about the Iraq problem.” </p>
<p><b>359. </b> Following confirmation that the US were considering deploying ground troops and </p>
<p>a discussion of whether the US was looking for a wide international discussion, Mr Blair </p>
<p>understood that the US would welcome whatever contribution the UK could make, but it </p>
<p>was not looking for other help. Mr Blair also said that:</p>
<p>“… the diplomacy surrounding action against Saddam would be important. We must </p>
<p>avoid giving any appearance of having taken a decision and then making everything </p>
<p>else fit round it.” </p>

<p><b>360. </b> Mr Blair concluded that “one argument worth stressing” was that we “had paid a </p>
<p>terrible price” by failing to act on warnings about Al Qaida and the Taliban:</p>
<p>“We should not make the same mistakes again ignoring warnings about the </p>
<p>international trade in WMD and the threat that this posed to us. We must educate </p>
<p>the public.”</p>
<p><b>361. </b> After the meeting, Mr Blair asked for further advice about the nature and role of the </p>
<p>opposition to Saddam Hussein inside and outside Iraq; and for advice on the timetable </p>
<p>for trying to get weapons inspectors back into Iraq and their remit. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> In the press conference after the meeting, Vice President Cheney stated that </p>

<p>important choices that await us in the days ahead”. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Asked about the second phase of the war on terrorism and what evidence </p>
<p>there was that Saddam Hussein had, or shortly would have, the capability to threaten </p>
<p>countries in Western Europe or the United States, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Let us be under no doubt whatever. Saddam Hussein has acquired weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction over a long period of time. He is the only leader in the world that </p>
<p>has actually used chemical weapons against his own people. He is in breach of at </p>
<p>least nine UN Security Council resolutions … He has not allowed the [UN] weapons </p>
<p>inspectors to do the job the UN wanted them to do in order to make sure that he </p>
<p>can’t develop them … no decisions have been taken on how we deal with this threat, </p>
<p>but that there is a threat … is not in doubt at all.” </p>
<p><b>364. </b> Addressing the conflict between Israel and Palestine, Mr Blair said that the UK </p>
<p>would “do everything we possibly can to assist the US in the efforts to bring about some </p>
<p>relaunching” of the Middle East Peace Process. </p>
<p><b>365. </b> Vice President Cheney stated that effective policies were needed to deal both with </p>
<p>that conflict and Iraq: “We have an obligation to deal with both simultaneously.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Asked whether, if Saddam Hussein allowed inspectors back into Iraq, that would </p>
<p>negate the need for military action, Vice President Cheney replied:</p>
<p>“… we feel very strongly … that it needs to be the kind of inspection regime that has </p>
<p>no limitations on it … so … the outside world can have confidence that he is not </p>
<p>hiding material that he has promised to give up.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>452</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that the meeting with Vice President Cheney constituted </p>
<p>the first “face to face” discussions with the US.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> Mr Cheney wanted to discuss Iraq with </p>
<p>Mr Blair before he consulted Middle East leaders about what should be done in Iraq and </p>
<p>“their tolerance … for action”. </p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Powell explained Mr Blair’s warning about “the law of unintended </p>
<p>consequences” as: “If you are going to deal with something like Iraq, you have to think </p>
<p>ahead about what might happen … including things you do not expect.” Mr Cheney had </p>
<p>said “that a coalition was nice, but not essential”.</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he didn’t think that Mr Cheney’s message </p>
<p>had been a “particular surprise”, and:</p>
<p>“… when the Prime Minister says you have got to have a clever plan … I think he is </p>
<p>probably saying that you have got to go back through the UN system … he’s clear </p>
<p>in his own mind that it’s very important to try to keep the international community </p>
<p>together …” </p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Sir David added that there was a difference between Mr Blair saying Iraq would be </p>
<p>better off without Saddam Hussein and: </p>
<p>“… saying that he’s sympathetic to the idea that regime change is the purpose of the </p>
<p>activity. He always made it clear there had to be disarmament. That was what we </p>
<p>were looking for …</p>
<p>“So I think it would be a mistake to assume that this conversation means the Prime </p>
<p>Minister has signed up [to an invasion] …” </p>

<p><b>the UK “would continue to give strong support to the idea of regime change” in </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq, but a convincing plan would be needed.</b></p>

<p><b>374.  Sir David reported that President Bush wanted to hear Mr Blair’s views </b></p>
<p><b>before taking decisions, and that Mr Blair would have real influence.</b></p>
<p><b>375.  Sir David also warned that there was a risk that the US Administration was </b></p>
<p><b>underestimating the difficulties.</b></p>
<p><b>376. </b> In his discussions with Dr Rice on Iraq in mid-March, Sir David Manning recorded </p>
<p>that he had “made it clear that we would continue to give strong support to the idea of </p>
<p>regime change, but we were looking to the US to devise a convincing plan of action. </p>
<p>This would also need to answer the question of who would follow Saddam.” </p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that a series of issues would need to be addressed if the US </p>
<p>decided on military action against Iraq. </p>
<p><b>378. </b> One was whether the US “wanted company”. If it wanted the support of a coalition, </p>
<p>it would have to address a number of concerns that would be critical in determining the </p>
<p>attitude of potential partners. Those were the need to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“mount a public information campaign explaining the nature of Saddam’s regime </p>
<p>and the nature of the threat he posed”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“describe the role that the US envisaged for the UN, and particularly for the </p>
<p>weapons inspectors”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“provide a convincing plan setting out how a combination of outside military </p>
<p>pressure, and external and internal opposition could topple Saddam”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“provide an equally convincing blueprint for a post Saddam Iraq … acceptable to </p>
<p>its neighbours as well as to its own population”.</p>
<p>Preparing public opinion and deciding who and what might replace Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>were tough propositions. </p>
<p><b>379. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that the UK “hoped shortly to publish an </p>
<p>unclassified paper giving as much detail as possible about Saddam’s WMD programme”. </p>
<p>The UK would “share as much as possible” as a way of convincing governments and </p>
<p>public opinion of the dangers of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. </p>
<p><b>380. </b> Sir David also pointed out the importance of taking:</p>
<p>“… time and trouble over the UN observers. Demonstrating to international opinion </p>
<p>that Saddam was in breach of the UNSCRs and continued to thwart the activities </p>
<p>of Blix [Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chair of UNMOVIC] and his team was a crucial </p>
<p>part of coalition building … It should not be impossible to persuade moderate public </p>
<p>opinion that it was Saddam who was at fault if he flouted the conditions and blocked </p>
<p>the inspectors … we should find ways of getting him to speak out publicly about </p>
<p>what his inspection team would need if they were to function effectively.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that the Israel/Palestine crisis, “where we </p>
<p>were accused of double standards”, would be “critical to Washington’s prospects of </p>
<p>constructing a coalition against Iraq”. If the crisis “went on spiralling down, it could lead </p>
<p>to a sharp divergence of view between Washington and the Europeans”. That would </p>
<p>“make the prospect of joint action against Iraq much more problematic”. Sir David stated </p>
<p>that the “urgent need for a process, and progress, towards peace” was “not an optional </p>
<p>extra”, it was “integral” to the strategy on Iraq. That would be the subject that Mr Blair </p>
<p>would “concentrate on when he sees the President after Easter”. </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Sir David sent the account of his discussions with Dr Rice and other members of </p>
<p>the US National Security Council (NSC) to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon’s Private Secretaries </p>
<p>and to key officials. </p>
<p><b>383. </b> Sir David Manning sent a separate note to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>384. </b> Sir David reported that President Bush was grateful for Mr Blair’s support and </p>
<p>had registered that Mr Blair was “getting flak”. Sir David had told President Bush that </p>
<p>Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… would not budge in your support for regime change but you had to manage a </p>
<p>press and Parliament and a public opinion that was very different from anything in </p>
<p>the States. And you would not budge either in your insistence that, if he pursued </p>
<p>regime change, it must be carefully done and produce the right result. Failure was </p>
<p>not an option.”</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Sir David wrote that Dr Rice was still enthusiastic about regime change, but there </p>
<p>were “some signs … of greater awareness of the practical difficulties and political risks”. </p>
<p>But President Bush had:</p>
<p>“… yet to find answers to the big questions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to persuade international opinion that military action against Iraq is </p>
<p>necessary and justified;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what value to put on the exiled Iraq opposition;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to co-ordinate a US/allied military campaign with internal opposition …</p>

<p>455</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Sir David advised Mr Blair that President Bush would want “to pick your brains”. He </p>
<p>would “also want to hear whether we can expect coalition support”. Sir David wrote that </p>
<p>he had told Dr Rice that if the US:</p>
<p>“… wanted company, it would have to take account of the concerns of potential </p>
<p>partners. In particular:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UN dimension. The issue of the weapons inspectors must be handled </p>
<p>in a way that would persuade European and wider opinion that the US was </p>
<p>conscious of the international framework, and the insistence of many countries </p>
<p>on the need for a legal base. Renewed refusal by Saddam to accept unfettered </p>
<p>inspections would be a powerful argument;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the paramount importance of tackling Israel/Palestine. Unless we did, we could </p>
<p>find ourselves bombing Iraq and losing the Gulf.” </p>
<p><b>387. </b> Sir David concluded: </p>
<p>“No doubt we need to keep a sense of perspective. But my talks with Condi </p>
<p>convinced me that Bush wants to hear your views on Iraq before taking decisions. </p>
<p>He also wants your support. He is still smarting from the comments from other </p>
<p>European leaders on his Iraq policy. </p>
<p>“This gives you real influence: on the public relations strategy; on the UN and </p>
<p>weapons inspections; and on US planning for any military campaign. This could be </p>
<p>critically important. I think there is a real risk that the Administration underestimates </p>
<p>the difficulties. They may agree that failure is not an option, but this does not mean </p>
<p>they will avoid it.</p>
<p>“Will the Sunni majority really respond to an uprising led by Kurds and Shias? Will </p>
<p>the Americans really put in enough ground troops to do the job …? Even if they do, </p>
<p>will they be willing to take the sort of casualties … if it turns out to be an urban war, </p>
<p>and Iraqi troops don’t … collapse … as Richard Perle and others confidently predict? </p>
<p>They need to answer these, and other tough questions, in a more convincing way </p>
<p>than they have so far before concluding that they can do the business.</p>
<p>“The talks at the ranch will also give you the chance to push Bush on the Middle </p>
<p>East. The Iraq factor means that there may never be a better opportunity to get this </p>
<p>administration to give sustained attention to reviving the MEPP.”</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he had gone to Washington on 12 March for </p>
<p>a “reconnaissance visit” in preparation for the meeting at Crawford, and that the intention </p>
<p>was to “take soundings”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> The UK had been clear by then that Iraq would be on the </p>

<p>456</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Sir David stated that he had also wanted to reflect Mr Blair’s “preoccupations” </p>

<p>and … wanted the participation of its allies … it would have to address allies’ concerns </p>
<p>… including obviously our own”. He had set out the issues which would need to be </p>
<p>addressed. Sir David had also said that, after Afghanistan, the idea of working with a </p>
<p>coalition was a “powerful” one. </p>

<p><b>390. </b> Summing up the Cabinet discussion on 14 March on the deteriorating position </p>
<p>in the Middle East, Mr Blair referred to his planned meeting with President Bush and </p>
<p>stated that:</p>
<p>“… it was necessary to remain close to the Government of the United States and </p>
<p>to persuade President Bush to re-engage completely in the [Middle East] Peace </p>
<p>Process, not least because it would otherwise be difficult to gather support for </p>
<p>addressing the threat posed by the Iraqi regime …”</p>

<p>SIR CHRISTOPHER MEYER’S ADVICE, MARCH 2002</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer wrote to Sir David Manning reporting his conversation with </p>
<p>Mr Paul Wolfowitz, US Deputy Secretary of Defense, on 17 March.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>392. </b> On Iraq, Sir Christopher took the same line as Sir David had in his discussions with </p>
<p>the NSC about the actions necessary if the US wanted to build support for military action </p>
<p>against Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p><b>393. </b> Sir Christopher told Mr Wolfowitz that: </p>
<p>“If the UK were to join with the US in any operation against Saddam, we would have </p>
<p>to be able to take a critical mass of parliamentary and public opinion with us. It was </p>
<p>extraordinary how people had forgotten how bad he was.” </p>
<p><b>394. </b> The UK was giving serious thought to publishing “a paper that would make the </p>
<p>case against Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Sir Christopher reported that Mr Wolfowitz considered the “WMD danger … was </p>
<p>crucial to the public case against Saddam, particularly the potential linkage to terrorism”, </p>
<p>but he saw “Saddam’s barbarism” as an “indispensable” element of the case for action. </p>
<p><b>396. </b> Sir Christopher and Mr Wolfowitz also discussed the potential role of the Iraqi </p>
<p>opposition and “well documented” debate inside the Administration about supporting the </p>
<p>Iraqi National Congress or a wider coalition of opposition groups. Mr Wolfowitz seemed </p>
<p>to prefer the former and “brushed over” Sir Christopher’s reference to the absence </p>

<p>democracy not another military officer. </p>
<p><b>397. </b> Sir Christopher and Mr Wolfowitz also discussed developments in Afghanistan, </p>
<p>including the planned deployment of 45 Commando Group and Sir Christopher’s view </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“… the greatest danger in Afghanistan was a slipping back to the conditions which </p>
<p>had allowed Al Qaida to prosper in the first place; that the greatest safeguard </p>
<p>against this was a continuing visible presence of the US military … for some time to </p>
<p>come. Wolfowitz displayed the DoD’s customary distaste for an ISAF-type expansion </p>
<p>to other Afghan cities. He thought there was a case for something akin to OSCE </p>
<p>monitors in certain regions.” </p>
<p><b>398. </b> Sir David thought the report sufficiently interesting to show to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry that Sir David Manning had given him a new </p>
<p>set of instructions during his visit to Washington in March 2002.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>400. </b> Sir Christopher described the new message for the Americans as:</p>
<p>“Look, if you want to do regime change, and if this is going to require military action, </p>
<p>you … can do it on your own … but if … you want your friends and partners to join </p>
<p>you, far better that you should do it inside an alliance, preferably taking the UN </p>
<p>route. </p>
<p>“That … was the single most important message I delivered to the US Administration </p>
<p>at that time.” </p>
<p><b>401. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… I had to come up with a set of arguments, which … he [Wolfowitz] might find </p>
<p>appealing enough not to become a serious obstacle to a policy that would involve </p>
<p>the UN.”</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>402. </b> Later Sir Christopher added:</p>
<p>“… I think the attitude of Downing Street … was … it was a fact that there was … </p>
<p>the Iraq Liberation Act. It was a fact that 9/11 had happened and it was a complete </p>
<p>waste of time, therefore … if we were going to be able to work with the Americans, </p>
<p>to … say, ‘We can’t support it [regime change]’ … the attempt was made to square </p>
<p>the circle … was actually … so to contextualise it, that regime change, if and when </p>

<p>it happened, would be with the benefit of the support of the international community </p>

<p>“… What we said was, ‘Let’s do this cleverly … and that means … go to the UN and </p>
<p>get a Security Council resolution … </p>
<p>“… You talked the talk of regime change, but you walked the walk, you hoped, of a </p>
<p>UN Security Council resolution permitting the use of force, if that was what it was </p>
<p>going to come to.”</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Asked whether at that stage the US Administration was looking at options other </p>
<p>than military action, Sir Christopher replied:</p>
<p>“… are you asking me at what point was it clear that war was inevitable? … that’s </p>
<p>a … hard question to answer. What was inevitable … was that the Americans were </p>
<p>going to bust a gut to carry out the mandated policy of regime change.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>404. </b> Asked how confident he was at that stage that the UK could influence the US, </p>
<p>Sir David Manning replied: </p>
<p>“I wasn’t confident, but I thought my job was to try … on two levels. One, on the role </p>
<p>I had as an official reflecting the British Government’s view that we needed to go </p>
<p>back to the UN, we needed to get the inspectors back, the issue was disarmament </p>
<p>not regime change. But I also felt very strongly personally that it was the way we </p>
<p>should go … </p>
<p>“I wasn’t confident it would work … there was a sense that the [US] Administration </p>
<p>[…] that military force had worked in Afghanistan … This was going to be the global </p>
<p>war on terror. This was a 1945 or 1991 moment when they were going to change the </p>
<p>world for the better on their watch. It was very tough but it was an historic moment </p>
<p>and they would do whatever it took.</p>
<p>“We didn’t really have that perception … So I was very conscious that there was </p>
<p>a very strong sense of historical destiny at work in the Bush Administration …</p>
<p>“But I was also conscious that there were different views within the </p>
<p>Administration …”</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>405. </b> Commenting on the media reaction in the US to Vice President Cheney’s tour of </p>
<p>the Middle East, Sir Christopher Meyer advised on 20 March that there had been “no </p>
<p>public flinching by Bush et al from tackling Saddam”; and that “No attempt is being made </p>
<p>by the Administration to counter the media supposition that it is no longer a question of </p>

<p><b>407.  The FCO paper on the Iraqi opposition concluded that regime change led by </b></p>
<p><b>the external opposition was not a viable option and the most realistic successor </b></p>
<p><b>to Saddam Hussein would be a senior Sunni military or ex-military figure.</b></p>
<p><b>408.  The FCO explained that the provisions of resolution 1284 were ambiguous </b></p>
<p><b>because the P5 had been unable to reach agreement in 1999, and there had been </b></p>
<p><b>no progress on clarification since.</b></p>
<p><b>409.  There would be difficulties with securing agreement from Iraq, the US and </b></p>
<p><b>Russia on its implementation. The US could seek to raise the barrier for Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>compliance; Russia was likely to take the opposite view. France might support the </b></p>

<p>“In any case, we do not assess the external opposition to be capable of leading </p>

<p>oppositionists are not credible figures for a provisional government. Regime change </p>
<p>relying mainly or exclusively on the external opposition is therefore not a viable </p>

<p><b>413. </b> The note on inspections summarised the history of efforts to get inspectors back </p>
<p>into Iraq, examined the future prospects for doing so through clarification of resolution </p>
<p>1284 (1999), and described the remit of UNMOVIC and the IAEA (International Atomic </p>
<p>Energy Agency).</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> It described the “main feature” of resolution 1284 as being that it </p>
<p>offered Iraq “a suspension of sanctions in return for co-operation with the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors, including progress on key disarmament tasks. Resolution 687 (1991) had </p>
<p>offered lifting of sanctions “only when the inspectors say disarmament is complete”, </p>
<p>which Iraq regarded as “an unattainable goal”. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> The FCO wrote that Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remained “determined to escape sanctions without fulfilling its disarmament </p>
<p>obligations”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “never accepted” resolution 1284; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued to “refuse to allow inspectors to return”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>justified its position by claiming that resolution 1284 was “so ambiguous” that </p>
<p>the US could “easily deny” that co-operation had been “adequate”. </p>
<p><b>415. </b> Addressing the prospects for the future, the FCO advised that there was “no </p>
<p>independent timetable as such” for the return of the inspectors. The “key” would be </p>
<p>persuading Iraq to accept resolution 1284:</p>
<p>“While it is possible that the threat of military action might also prompt a change </p>
<p>in the Iraqi position, we have always assumed that the only real prospect lies in </p>
<p>clarifying … [resolution] 1284. We recognise there are ambiguities … They are </p>
<p>there for a good reason: the P5 was unable to reach agreement. If positions remain </p>
<p>as entrenched as they were during … negotiations, there is little prospect of the </p>
<p>situation changing, which is why clarification has not been attempted sooner. But </p>
<p>SCR 1382 [2001] now commits the Security Council to trying.”</p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>461</p>
<p><b>416. </b> The FCO reminded Mr Blair that the US was “reluctant to go down the road </p>
<p>of clarification” because of fears it represented a “slippery slope towards a weaker </p>
<p>inspections regime”. No Security Council member had “yet challenged this”, although </p>
<p>the FCO predicted that “pressure may increase” following the talks between Iraq and </p>
<p>Mr Annan on 7 March. “Nearly all of Iraq’s serious points” had related to clarification; and </p>
<p>Mr Annan expected the Security Council “to provide answers” before the next round of </p>
<p>talks in April. The US would “not be able to hold out against beginning clarification talks </p>
<p>for much longer without appearing unreasonable”.</p>
<p><b>417. </b> The FCO advised that the UK “would be willing to see some clarification” as long </p>
<p>as this did not water down Iraq’s obligations or cut across UNMOVIC’s mandate or </p>
<p>rights. That included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Elaboration of post-suspension financial controls, i.e. how much, if any, </p>
<p>control of the Iraqi economy, including oil revenues, should revert to the Iraqi </p>
<p>government once sanctions are suspended.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Definition of key remaining disarmament tasks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Clarification/shortening of the suspension timetable”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Clarification of the triggers for suspension, i.e. what is meant by full </p>
<p>co-operation with the inspectors.”</p>
<p><b>418. </b> The FCO advised that the US would “resist strongly any attempt to lower the </p>
<p>barrier for Iraqi compliance” and they “could even seek to raise it”. That probably </p>
<p>meant that the US would adopt an “extreme position” and Russia was “likely to take </p>
<p>the opposite extreme”. The FCO predicted that France might support the UK because </p>
<p>it saw a “Security Council agreement on a tough inspection regime as the only realistic </p>
<p>alternative to US military action”. </p>
<p><b>419. </b> The FCO also explained that UNMOVIC had been given “all UNSCOM’s </p>
<p>responsibilities, rights and resources”. It had additionally been tasked “with establishing </p>
<p>a reinforced system of ongoing monitoring and verification, under which outstanding </p>
<p>disarmament issues would be addressed”. UNMOVIC and the IAEA were also asked </p>
<p>to “draw up a list of key disarmament tasks and to report on the level of co-operation” </p>
<p>they had received “so that the Security Council” could “judge whether the conditions for </p>
<p>sanctions suspension” had been met. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“Neither SCR 687 or any subsequent resolutions contain any provision for </p>
<p>ending … monitoring and verification, even after sanctions lift. It is our interpretation </p>
<p>that ending monitoring would require a separate decision by the Security Council, </p>
<p>hence … Iraq could be subjected to special scrutiny indefinitely, until we were </p>
<p>completely satisfied that it no longer posed a threat.” </p>

<p><b>JIC Current Intelligence Group Assessment, 15 March 2002: ‘The </b></p>
<p><b>Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’ </b></p>
<p><b>421.  A Current Intelligence Group</b> (<b>CIG) Assessment of the status of Iraq’s WMD </b></p>
<p><b>programmes was produced to inform Mr Blair’s discussions with President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush. It stated that Iraq continued to pursue a policy of acquiring WMD and their </b></p>
<p><b>delivery means. </b></p>
<p><b>422. </b> A CIG Assessment, ‘The Status of Iraqi WMD Programmes’, was “approved on </p>
<p>behalf of the Committee” by Mr Miller on 15 March.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> (The status of a CIG is explained </p>
<p>in Section 2.) </p>
<p><b>423. </b> The paper stated that it had been commissioned by the FCO “to aid policy </p>
<p>discussions on Iraq”, but the minutes of the JIC of 6 March suggest it was produced </p>
<p>in response to a request from Sir David Manning specifically to inform Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>discussions with President Bush.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>424. </b> The Key Judgements in the Assessment were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq <b>retains up to 20 Al Hussein ballistic missiles </b>… The location and </p>
<p>condition of these is unknown, but there is sufficient engineering expertise to </p>
<p>make them operational.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has begun development of <b>medium range ballistic missiles over 1000km</b> </p>
<p>… but will <b>not be able to produce such a missile before 2007</b> provided that </p>
<p>sanctions remain effective.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is <b>pursuing a nuclear weapons programme</b>. But <b>it will not be able to </b></p>
<p><b>indigenously produce a nuclear weapon while sanctions remain</b> in place, </p>
<p>unless suitable fissile material is purchased from abroad.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq <b>may retain some stocks of chemical agents</b>. Following a decision to do </p>
<p>so, Iraq could produce:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>significant quantities of <b>mustard within weeks</b>; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>significant quantities of <b>sarin and VX within months</b>, and in the case of </p>
<p>VX may already have done so.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq currently <b>has available</b>, either from pre Gulf War stocks or more recent </p>
<p>production, a number of biological agents. Iraq could produce more of these </p>
<p><b>biological agents</b> within days.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A decision to begin CBW production would probably go undetected.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq can deliver CBW weapons by a variety of means including ballistic missiles. </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s CBW production capability is designed to survive</b> a military attack and </p>
<p>UN inspectors.”</p>

<p>463</p>
<p><b>425. </b> In the main text, but not in the Key Judgements, the Assessment warned that </p>
<p>the intelligence on Iraq’s WMD and ballistic missile programmes was “<b>sporadic and </b></p>
<p><b>patchy</b>”. It added , however, that Iraq was:</p>
<p>“… well practised in the art of deception, such as concealment and exaggeration. </p>
<p>A complete picture of the various programmes is therefore difficult. But it is clear </p>
<p>that Iraq continues to pursue a policy of acquiring WMD and their delivery means. </p>
<p>Intelligence indicates that planning to reconstitute some of its programmes began </p>
<p>in 1995. WMD programmes were then given a further boost with the withdrawal of </p>
<p>UNSCOM inspectors.” </p>
<p><b>426. </b> The Assessment and the uncertainties underlying its judgements are addressed </p>
<p>in more detail in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s minute, 17 March 2002</b></p>
<p><b>427.  Mr Blair concluded that the papers he had been given on Iraq did not </b></p>
<p><b>constitute a properly worked out strategy and that he would need to provide the </b></p>
<p><b>US with a far more intelligent and detailed analysis of a game plan. </b></p>
<p><b>428.  Mr Blair asked for a meeting with military personnel. He did not seek a </b></p>
<p><b>collective discussion with Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and other key Cabinet colleagues. </b></p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Blair sent a minute on 17 March to Mr Powell, and a copy to Sir David Manning, </p>
<p>setting out three points in response to the briefing papers he had been given for the </p>
<p>meeting with President Bush:</p>
<p>“(1) In all my papers I do not have a proper worked-out strategy on how we would </p>
<p>do it. The US do not either, but before I go [to Crawford], I need to be able to </p>
<p>provide them with a far more intelligent and detailed analysis of a game plan. </p>
<p>I will need a meeting on this with military folk.</p>
<p>“(2) The persuasion job on this seems very tough. My own side are worried. </p>
<p>Public opinion is fragile. International opinion – as I found at the EU – is pretty </p>
<p>sceptical.</p>
<p>“Yet from a centre-left perspective, the case should be obvious. Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime is a brutal, oppressive military dictatorship. He kills his opponents, </p>
<p>has wrecked his country’s economy and is source of instability and danger </p>
<p>in the region. I can understand a right-wing Tory opposed to “nation-building” </p>
<p>being opposed to it on the grounds it hasn’t direct bearing on our national </p>
<p>interest. But in fact a political philosophy that does care about other nations – </p>
<p>eg Kosovo, Afghanistan, Sierra Leone – and is prepared to change regimes on </p>
<p>their merits, should be gung-ho on Saddam. So why isn’t it? Because people </p>
<p>believe we are only doing it to support the US; and they are only doing it to </p>
<p>settle an old score. And the immediate WMD problems don’t seem obviously </p>
<p>worse than 3 years ago. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>“So we have to re-order our story and message. Increasingly I think it should </p>
<p>be about the nature of the regime. We do intervene – as per the Chicago </p>
<p>speech. We have no inhibitions – where we reasonably can – about nation-</p>
<p>building ie we must come to our conclusion on Saddam from our own position, </p>
<p>not the US position.</p>
<p>“(3) Oil prices. This is my big domestic worry. We must concert with the US to get </p>
<p>action from others to push the price back down. Higher petrol prices really might </p>
<p>put the public off.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Asked to explain his thinking in the minute Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The first sentence was asking: “How we would either get Saddam to cease </p>
<p>being a threat peacefully or to get him out by force.” He had been very open </p>
<p>in public about that. The minute was “more about the politics”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The WMD question was about the changed assessment of the risk and the </p>
<p>difficulty of making the case that Saddam Hussein posed a threat.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The message had to address the nature of the regime and the security threat </p>
<p>to command the support of both the right and the left of the political debate.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The change in the security risk after 11 September was the basis for changing </p>
<p>the regime but the nature of the regime was why “we should be proud of having </p>
<p>got rid of him [Saddam Hussein]”.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“So if September 11 hadn’t happened, we would have carried on in the same way </p>
<p>frankly that George Bush and I first discussed … in February 2001.”</p>
<p><b>The threat to the UK</b></p>
<p><b>432.  From March 2002, the Security Service advised that, in the event of a US </b></p>
<p><b>attempt to topple Saddam Hussein’s regime, the threat to the UK and UK interests </b></p>
<p><b>from Iraq would be limited and containable.</b></p>
<p><b>433. </b> Consideration of Iraq’s capability effectively to threaten the UK had begun in </p>
<p>early 2002. </p>
<p><b>434. </b> On 22 March 2002, Ms Eliza Manningham-Buller, the Deputy Director General of </p>
<p>the Security Service, wrote to Mr John Gieve, the Permanent Secretary of the Home </p>
<p>Office, about the “possible terrorist consequences should the US, possibly with UK </p>
<p>support, seek to topple Saddam Hussein’s regime in Iraq”.</p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>465</p>
<p><b>435. </b> The letter stated that since 1991, Iraq had been “implicated” in “only one terrorist </p>
<p>plan directed against a Western target – a planned car bomb attack on ex-President </p>
<p>Bush in Kuwait in 1993”. The letter reflected the JIC Assessment, of 21 November 2001 </p>
<p>(see Section 3.1), that Saddam Hussein was likely to order terrorist attacks only if he </p>
<p>perceived that his regime was threatened. It stated: </p>
<p>“If Saddam were to initiate a terrorist campaign … Iraqi capability to mount attacks in </p>
<p>the UK is currently limited. We are aware of no Iraqi intelligence (DGI) officers based </p>
<p>in the UK. There are up to […] DGI agents here who report on anti-regime activities. </p>
<p>But most of these agents lack the inclination or capability to mount terrorist attacks. </p>
<p>So if the DGI wished to mount attacks in the UK it would need to import teams from </p>
<p>overseas.”</p>
<p><b>436. </b> Addressing a potential chemical or biological attack, the letter stated that there had </p>
<p>been “media stories” during the Gulf Conflict and:</p>
<p>“… a 1998 scare (arising from a tale put about by Iraqi émigrés) that Saddam </p>
<p>planned to send anthrax abroad in scent bottles. Given Iraq’s documented CB </p>
<p>capabilities, we can anticipate similar stories again.” </p>
<p><b>437. </b> “Most Iraqi CB attacks” had, however, been “assassination attempts against </p>
<p>individuals” and there was “no intelligence that Iraq has hitherto planned or sought </p>
<p>mass-casualty CB terrorist attacks”. If the survival of the regime was in doubt, Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s “preferred option would be to use conventional military delivery systems </p>
<p>against targets in the region, rather than terrorism”.</p>
<p><b>438. </b> The letter also described the steps being taken by the Security Service in response </p>
<p>to the potential threat.</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Sir David Omand, Security and Intelligence Co-ordinator from September 2002 </p>
<p>to April 2005, told the Inquiry that, in March 2002, the Security Service judged that the </p>
<p>“threat from terrorism from Saddam’s own intelligence apparatus in the event of an </p>
<p>intervention in Iraq … was judged to be limited and containable”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>440. </b> Baroness Manningham-Buller confirmed that position, stating that the Security </p>
<p>Service felt there was “a pretty good intelligence picture of a threat from Iraq within the </p>
<p>UK and to British interests”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>441. </b> Baroness Manningham-Buller added that subsequent events showed that the </p>
<p>judgement that Saddam Hussein did not have the capability to do anything much in the </p>
<p>UK, had “turned out to be the right judgement”.</p>

<p>466</p>
<p><b>Advice from Cabinet Ministers</b></p>
<p>CABINET, 21 MARCH 2002</p>
<p><b>442. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 21 March that he would be meeting President Bush </p>
<p>in the first week of April:</p>
<p>“Their talks would focus on how to respond to the threat to international security </p>
<p>represented by the Iraqi regime, efforts to build on the success of the Coalition’s </p>
<p>intervention in Afghanistan, how to achieve progress in the Middle East Peace </p>
<p>process and gathering support for the New Economic Partnership for Africa’s </p>
<p>Development.”</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>443. </b> No further discussion of the issues is recorded. </p>
<p><b>444. </b> Cabinet also discussed the deployment of an infantry battlegroup based on </p>
<p>45 Commando Royal Marines to Afghanistan, and the nature of the task it would </p>
<p>perform. Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“… the troops were supported by the majority of the people in Afghanistan and would </p>
<p>not be seeking to occupy territory, there was substantial United States air cover and </p>
<p>there were troops from several Coalition partners involved. There was no parallel </p>
<p>with the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. The total number of British </p>
<p>forces engaged in operations related to Afghanistan was substantial, but still only </p>
<p>one-tenth of the number deployed during the 1991 Gulf War.”</p>
<p><b>445. </b> The deployment of the battlegroup, which was the largest deployment of UK forces </p>
<p>since 1991, had been announced on 18 March.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> That is addressed in Section 6.1. </p>

<p><b>447.  On Iraq, Mr Hoon advised that the UK should support President Bush and </b></p>
<p><b>be ready to make a military contribution; and that UK involvement in planning </b></p>
<p><b>would improve the US process. One of Mr Blair’s objectives at Crawford should, </b></p>
<p><b>therefore, be to secure agreement to the UK’s participation in US military </b></p>
<p><b>planning.</b></p>
<p><b>448.  Mr Hoon also stated that a number of issues would need to be addressed </b></p>
<p><b>before forces were committed to military action, including the need for a </b></p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>467</p>
<p><b>449. </b> Following a discussion with key officials, which is addressed in Section 6.1, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair, on 22 March, stating:</p>
<p>“The key strategic problem is the spread of WMD – of which Saddam is only one </p>
<p>unpleasant dimension. A more active counter-proliferation strategy is required for </p>
<p>the region as a whole (for example any Iraqi government will seek WMD if Iran is </p>
<p>getting them so our strategy must cover both). On Iraq, we should support President </p>
<p>Bush and be ready for a military contribution … [W]e should be involved in the detail </p>
<p>before we commit our forces.”</p>
<p>“… In objective terms, Iran may be the greater problem for the UK … Ironically, we </p>
<p>have Saddam Hussein bound into an established control mechanism. There is some </p>
<p>substance in the US view that he as an individual is at the root of the WMD risk in </p>
<p>Iraq. But any Iraqi government is likely to try and achieve a balance of forces with </p>
<p>Iran. I strongly support the parallel campaign by Jack [Straw] to tackle Iran through </p>
<p>the IAEA system.”</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Mr Hoon identified three factors that the UK should keep in mind in considering </p>
<p>how to support President Bush:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US already has heavy land forces in the region … [and] is planning on the </p>
<p>basis that it would take 90 days to deploy all necessary forces to the region; it </p>
<p>would take us longer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite 10 years of searching, no one has found a credible successor to </p>
<p>Saddam.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If a coalition takes control of Baghdad (especially without catching Saddam), </p>
<p>it will probably have to stay there for many years.”</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the UK “should support President Bush and be ready for a </p>
<p>military contribution” for Iraq. Mr Hoon cautioned that the UK was:</p>
<p>“… not privy to detailed US planning, either strategically across the region or on </p>
<p>Iraq. Before any decision to commit British forces, we ought to know that the US </p>
<p>has a militarily plausible plan with a reasonable prospect of success compared to </p>
<p>the risks and within the framework of international law. Our involvement in planning </p>
<p>would improve their process – and help address our lead time problem. It would </p>
<p>enable either CDS to reassure you that there is a sound military plan or give you a </p>
<p>basis to hold back if the US cannot find a sensible scheme … I suggest one of your </p>
<p>objectives at Crawford should be to secure agreement to the UK’s participation in </p>
<p>US military planning …”</p>

<p><b>Iraq and in favour (if necessary) of military action” might be made in the context </b></p>
<p><b>of seeking regime change as an essential part of a strategy of eliminating Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>WMD, rather than an objective in its own right. </b></p>
<p><b>455.  Mr Straw advised that the fact that Iraq was in flagrant breach of the </b></p>
<p><b>obligations imposed on it by the Security Council provided the core of a strategy </b></p>
<p><b>based on international law. </b></p>
<p><b>456.  The case could be based on a demand for the unfettered re-admission of </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>457.  The US was likely to oppose any proposal for a new mandate from the UN </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council, but the weight of UK legal advice was that a new mandate “may </b></p>
<p><b>well be required”. </b></p>
<p><b>458.  Mr Straw also stated that, if the argument was to be won, the whole “case </b></p>

<p>469</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Ricketts sent a personal minute advising Mr Straw that: </p>
<p>“By sharing Bush’s broad objective, the Prime Minister can help shape how it is </p>
<p>defined and the approach to achieving it. In the process he can bring home … some </p>
<p>of the realities which will be less evident from Washington. He can help Bush make </p>
<p>good decisions by telling him things his own machine probably isn’t.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr Ricketts added that “broad support for the objective” brought “two real problems </p>
<p>which need discussing”. The first was the threat from Iraq on which Mr Ricketts wrote, </p>
<p>“The truth is that what has changed is not the pace of Saddam Hussein’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes, but our tolerance of them” after 9/11.</p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Ricketts advised:</p>
<p>“This is not something we need to be defensive about, but attempts to claim </p>
<p>otherwise publicly will increase scepticism about our case … </p>
<p>“US scrambling to establish a link between Iraq and Al Qaida is so far frankly </p>
<p>unconvincing. To get public and Parliamentary support for military operations we </p>
<p>have to be convincing that: </p>
<p>•</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the threat is so serious/imminent that it is worth sending our troops to die for;</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>it is qualitatively different from the threat posed by other proliferators who are </p>
<p>closer to achieving nuclear capability (including Iran). </p>
<p>“We can make the case on qualitative difference (only Iraq has attacked a </p>
<p>neighbour, used CW and fired missiles against Israel). But the overall strategy needs </p>
<p>to include re-doubled efforts to tackle other proliferators … in other ways … But we </p>
<p>are still left with a problem of bringing public opinion to accept the imminence of a </p>
<p>threat from Iraq. This is something the Prime Minister and President need to have </p>
<p>a frank discussion about.”</p>
<p><b>465. </b> The second problem was the need to define an “end state” for any military action. </p>
<p>Mr Ricketts advised:</p>
<p>“Military operations need clear and compelling military objectives … For Iraq, </p>
<p>‘regime change’ does not stack up. It sounds like a grudge match between Bush </p>
<p>and Saddam. Much better, as you have suggested, to make the objective ending </p>
<p>the threat to the international community from Iraqi WMD before Saddam uses it </p>
<p>or gives it to terrorists. That is … easier to justify in terms of international law, but </p>
<p>also more demanding. Regime change which produced another Sunni general still </p>
<p>in charge of an active Iraqi WMD programme would be a bad outcome (not least </p>
<p>because it would be almost impossible to maintain UN sanctions on a new leader </p>
<p>who came in promising a fresh start).”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Ricketts added:</p>
<p>“As with the fight against UBL, Bush would do well to de-personalise the objective, </p>
<p>focus on elimination of WMD, and show that he is serious about UN Inspectors as </p>
<p>the first choice means of achieving that (it is win/win for him: either Saddam against </p>
<p>all the odds allows Inspectors to operate freely, in which case we can further hobble </p>
<p>his WMD programmes, or he blocks/hinders, and we are on stronger ground for </p>
<p>switching to other methods).”</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Ricketts concluded:</p>
<p>“Defining the end state in this way, and working through the UN, will … also help </p>
<p>maintain a degree of support among the Europeans, and therefore fits with another </p>
<p>message which the Prime Minister will want to get across: the importance of </p>
<p>positioning Iraq as a problem for the international community as a whole, not just </p>
<p>for the US.”</p>
<p><b>468. </b> In a personal minute to Mr Blair on 25 March, Mr Straw advised:</p>
<p>“The rewards from your visit to Crawford will be few. The risks are high, both for you </p>
<p>and for the Government. I judge that there is at present no majority inside the PLP </p>
<p>for any military action against Iraq …”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>469. </b> Mr Straw wrote that making the case that “Saddam and the Iraq regime are bad” </p>
<p>was “easy”, but there were four areas where there was:</p>
<p>“a long way to go to convince them as to:</p>
<p>(a)  the scale of the threat from Iraq and why this has got worse recently;</p>
<p>(b)  what distinguishes the Iraqi threat from that of eg Iran and North Korea </p>
<p>so as to justify military action;</p>
<p>(c)  the justification for any military action in terms of international law;</p>
<p>(d)  whether the consequence of military action really would be a compliant, law </p>
<p>abiding replacement government.</p>
<p>“The whole exercise is made much more difficult to handle as long as conflict </p>
<p>between Israel and the Palestinians is so acute …”</p>
<p><b>470. </b> Mr Straw advised that the Iraqi regime posed “a most serious threat to its </p>
<p>neighbours, and therefore to international security” but, from “the documents so far </p>
<p>presented it has been hard to glean whether the threat from Iraq is so significantly </p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>471</p>
<p>different” as to justify military action. Without the attacks of 11 September, it was </p>
<p>“doubtful that the US would now be considering military action against Iraq”. There was:</p>
<p>“… no credible evidence to link Iraq with UBL and Al Qaida … </p>
<p>“… Objectively, the threat from Iraq has not worsened as a result of 11 September. </p>
<p>What has, however, changed is the tolerance of the international community </p>
<p>(especially that of the US), the world having witnessed on September 11 just what </p>
<p>determined evil people can these days perpetrate.”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Addressing the difference between Iraq, Iran and North Korea, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“By linking these countries together in his ‘axis of evil’ speech, President Bush </p>
<p>implied an identity between them not only in terms of their threat, but also in terms </p>
<p>of the action necessary to deal with the threat. A lot of work will now need to be done </p>
<p>to delink the three, and to show why military action against Iraq is so much more </p>
<p>justified than against Iran and North Korea. The heart of this case – that Iraq poses </p>
<p>a unique and present danger – rests on the fact that it:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>invaded a neighbour;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>has used WMD, and would use them again;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>is in breach of nine UNSCRs.”</p>
<p><b>472. </b> In relation to the position in international law, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“That Iraq is in flagrant breach of international legal obligations imposed on it by </p>
<p>the UNSC provides us with the core of a strategy, and one which is based on </p>
<p>international law. Indeed, if the argument is to be won, the whole case against Iraq </p>
<p>and in favour (if necessary) of military action needs to be narrated with reference </p>
<p>to the international rule of law.</p>
<p>“We also have better to sequence the explanation of what we are doing and why. </p>
<p>Specifically, we need to concentrate in the early stages on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making operational the sanctions regime foreshadowed by UNSCR 1382; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demanding the re-admission of weapons inspectors … to operate in a free </p>
<p>and unfettered way …</p>
<p>“… I believe that a demand for the unfettered re-admission of weapons inspectors </p>
<p>is essential, in terms of public explanation, and in terms of legal sanction for any </p>
<p>subsequent military action. </p>
<p>“Legally, there are two potential elephant traps:</p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p>regime change per se is no justification for military action; it could form </p>
<p>part of the method of any strategy, but not a goal. Of course, we may want </p>
<p>credibly to assert that regime change is an essential part of the strategy by </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>472</p>
<p>which we have to achieve our ends – that of the elimination of Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>capacity; but the latter has to be the goal;</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>on whether any military action would require a fresh UNSC mandate (Desert </p>
<p>Fox did not). The US are likely to oppose any idea of a fresh mandate. On </p>
<p>the other side, the weight of legal advice here is that a fresh mandate may </p>
<p>well be required. There is no doubt that a new UNSCR would transform the </p>
<p>climate in the PLP. Whilst that (a new mandate) is very unlikely, given the </p>
<p>US’s position, a draft resolution against military action … could play very </p>
<p>badly here.”</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Addressing the consequences of military action, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“A legal justification is a necessary but far from sufficient pre-condition for military </p>
<p>action. We have also to answer the big question – what will this action achieve? </p>
<p>There seems to be a larger hole in this than on anything. Most of the assessments </p>
<p>from the US have assumed regime change as a means of eliminating Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD threat. But none has satisfactorily answered how that regime change is to </p>
<p>be secured, and how there can be any certainty that the replacement regime will </p>
<p>be better.</p>
<p>“Iraq has had no underlying history of democracy so no-one has this habit or </p>
<p>experience.”</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Mr Straw also wrote:</p>
<p>“I will talk to you about handling the PLP. But one thing which would help greatly is </p>
<p>agreeing that any UK action would have to be endorsed by a substantive resolution </p>
<p>of the Commons. There is precedent for this – in the Gulf War. It makes the </p>
<p>Government look weak and condescending to its own parliamentary party, to evade </p>
<p>a substantive vote. A more messy alternative expression of dissent (on the division </p>
<p>for the adjournment) cannot be avoided if there is no substantive vote. The question </p>
<p>will also be asked of you – if there can be substantive votes on a trivial issue like </p>
<p>hunting, why not on war?”</p>

<p><b>479. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that his recommendation was:</p>

<p>Government.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> Part of that was how to handle the US.</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Straw added that the UK had succeeded in achieving its policy objective when </p>

<p>MR STRAW’S CONVERSATION WITH SECRETARY POWELL, 25 MARCH 2002 </p>
<p><b>482. </b> In a conversation with Secretary Powell, on 25 March, Mr Straw was reported to </p>
<p>have described the political situation in the UK as:</p>
<p>“… generally ‘twitchy’, mostly for domestic reasons. Everyone accepted the case </p>
<p>against Iraq but not everyone acknowledged that post-11 September, our tolerance </p>
<p>of threats to security had reduced. He explained the need for military action, </p>
<p>should it take place later in the year, to be clearly within international law, even if </p>
<p>not explicitly endorsed by UNSCRs. He understood American impatience with our </p>
<p>approach … There would be a real problem if the objective of military action were </p>
<p>regime change. The Foreign Secretary felt entirely comfortable making a case </p>
<p>for military action to deal with Iraq’s WMD and could even say that the means of </p>
<p>meeting those concerns might be regime change, but this could not be the objective. </p>
<p>Politically we needed a strategy to swing parliamentary, public and European opinion </p>
<p>behind whatever course of action we took.”</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>483. </b> When he saw the record of the conversation with Secretary Powell, Mr Wood </p>

<p><b>484. </b> Having seen the telegram reporting the conversation between Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Secretary Powell, Mr Wood wrote to Mr Straw’s office to remind him of the advice in the </p>
<p>FCO paper<i>, </i>‘Iraq: Legal Background’, including that:</p>
<p>“… we would receive no support for reliance on the 1990 resolution authorising the </p>
<p>use of force prior to Desert Storm in the absence of a further decision by the Council </p>
<p>(whether by Presidential statement or by new resolution) that Iraq was in flagrant </p>
<p>violation of its obligations under the cease-fire resolution.</p>
<p>“… The Attorney General’s advice will need to be sought at the appropriate stage </p>
<p>before Ministerial decisions on actions or public statements.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>485. </b> Sir Michael Wood told the Inquiry that was the first of a series of occasions on </p>
<p>which he sent such a note:</p>
<p>“I was obviously quite concerned by what I saw him [Mr Straw] saying … often </p>
<p>reports are not accurate. They are summaries, they are short. He may well not have </p>
<p>said it in quite the form it came out in the telegram, but whenever I saw something </p>
<p>like that, whether from the Foreign Secretary or from the Prime Minister or from </p>
<p>officials … I would do a note just to make sure they understood the legal position. </p>
<p>“This is just an example of quite a few notes, but it certainly wasn’t my impression </p>
<p>that the Foreign Secretary really misunderstood the legal position at that stage.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Sir Michael added: </p>
<p>“This was quite early. It was before it had got into the bloodstream … of the Foreign </p>

<p>people of what was the accepted view.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Asked about Mr Wood’s minute, Mr Straw told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“What we were seeking to do – that was just before Crawford – was to persuade </p>
<p>the Americans to go down the UN route. There were still a number of views about </p>
<p>whether or not [resolutions] 678 and 687 could ‘revive’ the authority for military </p>
<p>action. As is well-known, I had told the Prime Minister that my view was that we had </p>
<p>to go down the UN route in any event, but I also had to keep our negotiating position </p>
<p>protected publicly, and that was why I used the words that I did.”</p>

<p>475</p>
<p><b>489.  In late March 2002, Lord Goldsmith, Attorney General, informed Mr Hoon and </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Straw that there could be considerable difficulties in justifying the use of force </b></p>
<p><b>without further action by the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>490.  Lord Goldsmith was seeking to avoid Ministers making apparently </b></p>
<p><b>authoritative statements before he had been asked to give his views.</b></p>
<p><b>491. </b> On 24 March, both Mr Straw and Mr Hoon were interviewed on television and </p>
<p>asked questions about the legal basis for any military action against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>492. </b> In response to a question about whether international law provided a mandate to </p>
<p>attack Iraq during an interview on <i>Breakfast with Frost</i> on 24 March, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“… we have never been involved in any military action in our history since the </p>
<p>establishment of the United Nations without the backing of international law and </p>
<p>we’re not going to be …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We don’t have a mandate to invade Iraq now, no … what we need to do however is </p>
<p>to ensure the full compliance by Iraq … with these United Nations obligations … if </p>
<p>Iraq refuses to comply … then the position in international law may very well change </p>
<p>… Nobody wants military action … at all and the way out lies very clearly in Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s hands. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… But, on the fundamental issue, do you need to ensure that any action that </p>
<p>is taken is justified in international law, there can only be one answer and that </p>
<p>is yes.”</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Later the same day, in an interview by Mr Jonathan Dimbleby on <i>ITV </i>about the </p>
<p>deployment of 1,700 Royal Marines to Afghanistan, Mr Hoon was asked whether, if </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein did not allow weapons inspectors in or only allowed them in on terms </p>
<p>which the US and UK found unacceptable, the UK would insist on having a mandate </p>
<p>from the United Nations Security Council or were the existing resolutions enough to </p>
<p>validate military action.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> Mr Hoon replied: “In principle they would be, not least because </p>
<p>those weapons of mass destruction might well be capable of posing a threat to the </p>
<p>United Kingdom in which case we will be entitled to act in self defence.”</p>
<p><b>494. </b> Asked whether Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, was </p>
<p>correct to say that it was not tolerable to act militarily against Saddam Hussein without </p>
<p>a UN mandate, Mr Hoon replied: “well what I am saying is that legally we would be </p>
<p>perfectly entitled to use force without a specific United Nations resolution”.</p>

<p>476</p>
<p><b>495. </b> In answer to a further question about what kind of necessity there might be to go </p>
<p>back to the UN, Mr Hoon responded that would “depend on the circumstances on the </p>
<p>ground, the nature of the information we had about the regime and crucially the extent to </p>
<p>which Saddam Hussein was or was not prepared to accede to existing … resolutions.” </p>
<p>Pressed further, Mr Hoon added that it would: “Depend on the context … But as far as </p>
<p>I understand the position legally we would be perfectly entitled to use force as we have </p>
<p>done in the past without the support of a United Nations Security Council resolution.” </p>
<p><b>496. </b> A minute from Mr Patey recorded that the media were “playing up apparent </p>

<p>for military action. No.10 will seek to play this down at the lobby briefing today”.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>concluded that it would be “important not to get drawn in public on the legal position </p>
<p>in respect of what are, at this stage, hypothetical scenarios”.</p>
<p><b>497. </b> Lord Goldsmith saw the transcripts of both interviews and wrote to Mr Hoon </p>
<p>on 28 March pointing out that: </p>
<p>“… the Law Officers’ opinion has not been sought on the legality of possible action </p>
<p>and I have not therefore offered any views on the legal position. The clarity of your </p>
<p>statement and the apparently authoritative way it was produced puts me … in a </p>
<p>difficult position.</p>
<p>“I would not want to be definitive until I have had the benefit of full submissions … </p>
<p>Nonetheless I think you should know that I see considerable difficulties in being </p>
<p>satisfied that military action would be justified on the basis of self defence …</p>
<p>“I am aware that another potential argument is that the breaches of Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions by Iraq would revive the authorisation to use force in … resolution 678 </p>

<p> He did not think that curtailed Lord Goldsmith’s “ability to offer an opinion about </p>

<p>we can discuss this further”. </p>
<p><b>501. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that the interview with Mr Dimbleby had been long and </p>
<p>that he had been pushed “quite hard on legality”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> He had been “trying quite hard not </p>
<p>to answer any questions, and that’s quite difficult”. Mr Hoon added that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>had not been “particularly concerned about the nature of my legal observation, I think he </p>
<p>was more concerned that I might be, in effect, boxing him in when he came to write his </p>
<p>own opinion”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>508. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy wrote to Mr Blair on 26 March “in advance of your meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush to express the concern that many feel with regard to the possibility </p>
<p>of military action against Iraq”.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Kennedy wrote:</p>
<p>“… those of us who believe that the case for fresh military action remains unproven </p>
<p>are in no way apologists for a brutal dictator who subjects his own people to </p>
<p>ignominy and deprivation, flouts international law, and continues to pose a threat to </p>
<p>international security.</p>
<p>“Military action should never be undertaken without clear and realistic political </p>
<p>objectives that are capable of achievement, and always as a last resort after all </p>
<p>other available means of achieving those objectives have been explored. I urge you </p>
<p>to seek such avenues with the same vigour and determination which you showed in </p>
<p>helping to build the international coalition against terrorism …</p>
<p>“It is axiomatic that those of us who seek to make Iraq fulfil its obligations under </p>
<p>international law, should ensure that any action taken to impose these obligations is </p>
<p>supported by international law.</p>
<p>“… there is no evidence to link Baghdad with the events of 11 September. Nor is </p>
<p>there any published evidence of the chemical, biological or nuclear capability of Iraq </p>
<p>since the withdrawal of the UNSCOM inspectors in 1998, but it would be reasonable </p>
<p>to conclude from past history that there is a strong probability that such capabilities </p>
<p>exist or at least are being actively pursued.</p>
<p>“The return of the weapons inspectors … must remain the international community’s </p>
<p>priority. I would therefore urge engagement with the regime to solicit agreement on </p>
<p>access …</p>
<p>“Before the UK lends its support for action against Iraq, the Government must </p>
<p>be satisfied that there is no other course of action open to the international </p>
<p>community. I would also urge the Government should seek the views of the elected </p>
<p>representatives of the British People in debate and a substantive motion before the </p>
<p>House of Commons before any further British forces be deployed beyond present </p>
<p>military commitments against Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>Mr Powell’s advice, 28 March 2002</b></p>
<p><b>510.  Mr Powell advised Mr Blair that the objectives for his meeting with President </b></p>

<p><b>“capitalise” on his standing in the US and support for the US Administration. </b></p>

<p>479</p>
<p><b>511.  In relation to the tactics on Iraq, Mr Powell suggested making the case </b></p>
<p><b>against Saddam Hussein and then setting an ultimatum seeking the return of </b></p>
<p><b>weapons inspectors. </b></p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Powell advised Mr Blair on 28 March that:</p>
<p>“Your meeting with Bush is an unusually important one and as timely on substance </p>
<p>as it is untimely in terms of domestic politics. </p>
<p>“On substance I think we have two basic aims:</p>
<p>a) </p>
<p>to agree sensible plans for Iraq and for the MEPP. On the former I would not </p>
<p>major on UN authorisation or legal base or any of that. I would stick to how </p>
<p>we come up with a military and political plan that is likely to be successful; </p>
<p>how we get the necessary support; and how we set it up properly, with </p>
<p>Afghanistan as the model – we need to make the case against Saddam and </p>
<p>then set an ultimatum (in this case return of inspectors rather than handing </p>
<p>over UBL). On the MEPP, the US are now engaged …</p>
<p>b) </p>
<p>to capitalise on your standing in the US and your support for the </p>
<p>Administration …”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Powell foresaw the need: “In terms of positioning” to “wrestle with three </p>
<p>important audiences – the PLP, US and Europe – all of whom want to hear different </p>
<p>things”. He suggested: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Putting Iraq into the internationalist context. Refer back to Chicago … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Make the case against Iraq on grounds of the way it treats its own people as well </p>
<p>as the WMD threat. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Set an ultimatum before we act rather than acting precipitately: we will only act </p>
<p>if Iraq defies UN resolutions by refusing to accept the inspectors back in (and it </p>
<p>does need to be anyone, anytime, anywhere).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Demonstrate we do not have double standards by showing we are persuading </p>
<p>the Americans to engage seriously on the MEPP.”</p>
<p><b>514. </b> Finally, Mr Powell advised on the need to position the Prime Minister’s approach </p>
<p>“before, during and after” the visit and suggested that Mr Blair should make it clear that </p>
<p>he was speaking as part of Europe as well as the UK: “You are a bridge not a poodle!” </p>
<p>Mr Blair needed “warm words from him [President Bush] on MEPP in return for warm </p>
<p>words from you on Iraq”. Mr Blair could use the speech at College Station, “to put Iraq </p>
<p>into the wider context”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>515. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I actually put a note to the Prime Minister setting out what I thought we should focus </p>
<p>on … This is not Kosovo. This is not Afghanistan. If you are thinking about Iraq, you </p>
<p>have to think about it in a different way. You have to be able to put it in a political </p>
<p>context. I referred … to the Chicago speech … You need to think about the long </p>
<p>term, about the Middle East peace process … and how you’d put Saddam in a … </p>
<p>proper framework to consider this sort of action.” </p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>516. </b> Mr Powell emphasised that he was not providing Mr Blair with options in his note </p>
<p>on 28 March, and others had also given Mr Blair their views. His role was to help Mr </p>
<p>Blair to focus before the meeting.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Mr Powell added that he was:</p>
<p>“… talking about how we could influence the Americans … we were trying to </p>
<p>replicate what we had done after 9/11 on Afghanistan. We were trying to say to </p>
<p>them, ‘Don’t rush into anything. Move at a deliberative pace and, above all, build </p>
<p>a coalition. Talk to people, go the UN route. Don’t rush into unilateral action.’ We </p>
<p>believed unilateral action would have been a terrible thing by America, and we </p>
<p>wanted to try and put it in a much wider political context.” </p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>518. </b> Mr Powell said that Mr Blair was:</p>
<p>“… always clear that the world would be better off without Saddam Hussein … from </p>
<p>the very beginning … he thought the best way to pursue this, as with Afghanistan, </p>
<p>would be to go down the UN route and give Saddam every chance to comply, but, </p>

<p><b>were beginning to be asked about the risks.</b></p>
<p><b>520.  Sir Christopher also warned about the implications of the US approach </b></p>

<p>as “Commander in Chief of the war on terrorism” which had transformed his Presidency, </p>

<p>the Administration and out, was that the only decision still to be taken on Iraq was </p>
<p>how to do it. Now, the question on everyone’s lips is how far Iraq has been pushed </p>
<p>back by the Palestinian conflict: by the outcome of Cheney’s tour: and by a longer </p>
<p>prognosis for operations in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“There is no shortage of Bush insiders who tell us that the die is cast for a </p>
<p>regime-change operation of some sort this autumn. But there is now a sense that the </p>
<p>Administration are for the first time really staring the hard questions in the face: how </p>
<p>much international support is needed: what smart options are available to topple </p>
<p>Saddam: above all what happens afterwards. There is a doubt among some – no </p>
<p>bigger than a fist sized cloud on the horizon – that Iraq might be too risky politically.</p>
<p>“There is no bigger obstacle than the Israeli Palestinian conflagration …”</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>522. </b> Separate advice from the Embassy to Whitehall analysing recent US polls a few </p>
<p>days earlier reported strong support (88 percent) for removal of Saddam as an important </p>
<p>foreign policy goal of the US, although only 46 percent favoured using ground troops to </p>
<p>invade Iraq.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> The Embassy concluded that US public opinion was ready to respond to </p>
<p>strong leadership: the US had been attacked and:</p>
<p>“… if and when a persuasive case is made for specific action in Iraq as part of the </p>
<p>war on terrorism, the American people will be up for it. But for now, it would be </p>
<p>unwise to interpret the headline figures as depicting a bellicose and confident US </p>
<p>ready to do whatever it takes to rid the world of Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>523. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer also offered advice on the US approach in Afghanistan, </p>
<p>where decisions had been taken:</p>
<p>“… in a very small circle of key officials around the President. Where Rumsfeld </p>
<p>(and General Franks) have not been fully engaged, little action has resulted. </p>
<p>Many in the Administration recognise that, on the ground, there is a real danger of </p>
<p>losing Afghanistan because of a US fear of getting sucked into nation-building. But </p>
<p>Rumsfeld has, in effect, blocked all but a minimalist approach.”</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Sir Christopher suggested that the UK should “vigorously” use the leverage from </p>
<p>the deployment of 45 Commando Royal Marines to:</p>
<p>“… push for greater US engagement in international stability efforts … We have </p>
<p>proportionately far more ground forces in Afghanistan than the Americans. If we are </p>
<p>not careful, the US will try to pass to us lead responsibility for Afghan stability for the </p>

<p><b>525. </b> Sir Christopher told the Inquiry that he had advised Mr Blair to focus on three </p>
<p>things at Crawford:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… how to garner international support for a policy of regime change, if that </p>
<p>is what it turns out to be.” </p>

<p>“If it involves removing Saddam Hussein, how do you do it and when …”</p>

<p>mean an armed invasion”.</p>
<p><b>Advice on the economic effects of military action</b></p>
<p><b>527.  In response to his concern about the impact that high oil prices might have </b></p>
<p><b>on public support for military action, Mr Blair was sent advice by both the FCO </b></p>
<p><b>and Mr Scarlett.</b></p>
<p><b>528. </b> In his minute of 17 March, Mr Blair had described oil prices as his “big domestic </p>
<p>worry”; and that higher petrol prices “really might put the public off”.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Mr Michael Arthur, the FCO Economic Director, sent Sir David Manning a </p>
<p>briefing on the economic effects of military action against Iraq which concluded that: </p>
<p>while military action against Iraq would pose some risk to the oil market, it should be </p>
<p>containable; there would be unavoidable economic consequences for Iraq’s neighbours, </p>
<p>particularly Jordan; and economic effects on Iraq itself were inevitable.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> It suggested </p>
<p>that the UK should think about helping northern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Scarlett responded to a separate request from Sir David Manning for an update </p>
<p>on Iraq’s oil production, the importance of oil income to the Iraqi regime and the effect of </p>
<p>a halt in oil exports on the world oil market on 4 April.</p>
<p>197 </p>
<p><b>531. </b> Mr Scarlett advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq benefited from both manipulating the Oil-for-Food regime and illegal </p>
<p>oil exports. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “unlikely that Iraq would voluntarily cease its illegal oil sales”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had halted oil exports under OFF for five weeks in mid-2001 to pressurise </p>
<p>the Russians to resist UK/US proposals on revised sanctions.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could “survive for several months at least and possibly several years” </p>
<p>without any oil income, as it had between 1991 and the end of 1996.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The contribution of revenues from OFF was not “regarded as necessarily crucial </p>
<p>to regime survival”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Removal of access to revenue from illegal oil exports would be a “more direct </p>
<p>threat to the regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been considerable successes in limiting oil smuggling through the </p>
<p>Gulf, but it had “proved politically impossible to counter effectively Iraq’s other </p>
<p>illegal oil exports”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While a sudden cut in Iraqi oil exports would probably cause a temporary spike </p>
<p>in the oil price, the price rise would be “moderate” (less than US$5 per barrel).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Market expectations would be a key factor in determining the duration of the </p>
<p>spike. They were already influenced by “jitters over the Middle East and talk </p>
<p>of war with Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> When Iraq announced on 8 April that it would halt oil exports under the UN </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food programme for 30 days “or until Israel withdraws from Palestinian </p>
<p>territories”, Mr Blair was advised that the market had already factored in the possibility </p>
<p>of disruption given the situation in the Middle East and the possibility of from an Iraqi </p>

<p><b>538. </b> Lt Gen Pigott produced a set of briefing slides at the meeting.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> They identified a </p>
<p>provisional end state for military action against Iraq which was defined as: </p>
<p>“A law-abiding Iraq which is reintegrated in the international community, that does </p>
<p>not threaten its neighbours, or global security.” </p>
<p><b>539. </b> The slides prepared for Lt Gen Pigott also contained elements related to </p>
<p>Afghanistan, the need to eliminate international terrorism as a force in international </p>
<p>affairs and a series of questions in relation to the goals and approach of any military </p>
<p>action in Iraq, including that if the US wanted the UK to be involved in any military action, </p>
<p>the UK would need to be involved in the planning.</p>
<p><b>540. </b> Dr Simon Cholerton, Assistant Director in the MOD Secretariat (Overseas), advised </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit:</p>
<p>“… we believe that the key issue for the PM to raise with President Bush is the </p>
<p>outcome the US would seek from any military action: would it simply be [to] control </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD, remove Saddam from office (in the knowledge that a successor regime </p>
<p>may well continue with Iraq’s WMD programmes) or is it necessary to install a </p>
<p>replacement regime? The answer to this question will be key to military planning; </p>
<p>how action would fit into the framework of international law and help hugely in </p>
<p>subsequent work to influence US policy.”</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>541. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that Adm Boyce and Lt Gen Pigott:</p>
<p>“… gave a presentation. They warned it could be a bloody fight and take a long time </p>
<p>to remove Saddam. The US were engaged in preliminary planning, but it was hard </p>
<p>to read where they were going with it. We needed to get alongside that planning and </p>

<p><b>543. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he did not remember the Chequers meeting </p>
<p>as “outstandingly important”, though he recollected that “things accelerate in the second </p>

<p><b>544. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove had discussed the Chequers meeting with colleagues on </p>
<p>4 April.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> In response to questions from the Inquiry, Sir Richard confirmed that regime </p>
<p>change didn’t necessarily mean military action and could, at that stage, have meant a </p>
<p>variety of things. </p>
<p><b>545. </b> Asked whether, from his memory of Chequers, Sir Richard thought Mr Blair </p>
<p>would have taken that view, Sir Richard replied: “I think you have got to look at it in the </p>
<p>broadest, most general sense”. </p>
<p><b>546. </b> Asked if Mr Straw and Adm Boyce would have gone along with Mr Blair’s view, </p>
<p>or were they more cautious, Sir Richard replied:</p>
<p>“I am not sure. I think you’ve got to realise that SIS at this point is in a pretty </p>
<p>extraordinary position … with an insight into what’s happening in the US which was </p>
<p>probably much more profound than anyone else in Government has got.” </p>
<p><b>547. </b> Sir Richard had also reported to his colleagues that: “WMD would only be one </p>
<p>of several arguments pointing to the need to uproot Saddam.” </p>
<p><b>548. </b> Sir Richard had told his colleagues that Mr Blair was seized of the fact that the </p>
<p>WMD threat from Libya was more serious than that from Iraq.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> Sir Richard added </p>
<p>that it had been about that time the UK “discovered that Libya has an active nuclear </p>
<p>programme”, which had been “something of a shock”.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Asked whether the concerns about WMD in other countries – Iran, North Korea </p>
<p>and Libya – were more important than Iraq, and how important WMD was for making the </p>
<p>case “to topple the [Iraqi] regime”, Sir Richard told the Inquiry that in April 2002 concerns </p>
<p>about Iraq’s WMD were “above the level of routine” and there was “an assumption that </p>
<p>Iraq’s interest in WMD” continued.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> Mr Blair would “push” President Bush to pursue </p>
<p>an active policy on Iraq “but the initial phase would be to prepare international public </p>
<p>opinion”.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Asked how to interpret a reference in the record of the discussion [on 4 April] to </p>
<p>Mr Blair wanting to lead, not just support the process of regime change, Sir Richard told </p>
<p>the Inquiry he thought it was the former: “keeping our hands on what’s going on and not </p>
<p>letting the Americans run away with the ball”.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>551. </b> Mr Campbell produced the most detailed account of the meeting. In his diaries, he </p>
<p>described it as: </p>
<p>“… a repeat of the smaller meeting we’d had on Afghanistan. Boyce … mainly set </p>
<p>out why it was hard to do anything …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>“TB [Tony Blair] wanted to be in a position to give GWB [President Bush] a strategy </p>
<p>and influence it. He believed Bush was in the same position as him, that it would </p>
<p>be great to get rid of Saddam and could it be done without terrible unforeseen </p>
<p>circumstances? … </p>
<p>“We were given an account of the state of Iraqi forces, OK if not brilliant, the </p>
<p>opposition – hopeless – and Saddam’s ways – truly dreadful<i>.</i> CDS [Adm Boyce] </p>
<p>appeared to be trying to shape the meeting towards inaction, constantly pointing out </p>
<p>the problems, the nature of the administration, only Rumsfeld and a few others knew </p>
<p>what was being planned, TB may speak to Bush or Condi but did they really know </p>
<p>what was going on? … He said apart from Rumsfeld, there were only four or five </p>
<p>people who were really on the inside track.</p>
<p>“… but CDS would keep coming back to the problems … General Tony Pigott did </p>
<p>an OK presentation which went through the problems realistically but concluded </p>
<p>that a full-scale invasion would be possible, ending up with fighting in Baghdad. But </p>
<p>it would be bloody, could take a long time. Also, it was not impossible that Saddam </p>
<p>would keep all his forces back. He said post-conflict had to be part of conflict </p>
<p>preparation. The Americans believed we could replicate Afghanistan but it was very, </p>
<p>very different … [Lt Gen] Cedric [Delves] … said Tommy Franks [General Franks, </p>
<p>Commander in Chief CENTCOM] was difficult to read because he believed they </p>
<p>were planning something for later in the year, maybe New Year. He basically </p>
<p>believed in air power plus Special Forces. CDS said if they want us to be involved </p>
<p>in providing force, we have to be involved in all the planning, which seemed fair </p>
<p>enough.</p>
<p>“TB said it was the usual conundrum – do I support totally in public and help deliver </p>
<p>our strategy, or do I put distance between us and lose influence?</p>
<p>“We discussed whether the central aim was WMD or regime change. Pigott’s view </p>
<p>was that it was WMD. TB felt it was regime change in part because of WMD but </p>
<p>more broadly because of the threat to the region and the world … [P]eople will say </p>
<p>that we have known about WMD for a long time … [T]his would not be a popular </p>
<p>war, and in the States fighting an unpopular war and losing is not an option.</p>
<p>“C said that the Presidential Finding, based on an NSC paper, made clear it was </p>
<p>regime change that they wanted … There was a discussion about who would </p>
<p>replace Saddam and how could we guarantee it would be better. Scarlett said it </p>
<p>couldn’t be worse …”</p>

<p>487</p>
<p><b>Presidential Finding in early 2002</b></p>
<p>In an article in <i>The Washington Post</i> on 16 June 2002, Mr Bob Woodward wrote that </p>
<p>President Bush had signed an intelligence order earlier in the year “directing the CIA </p>
<p>to undertake a comprehensive, covert program to topple Saddam Hussein, including </p>
<p>authority to use lethal force to capture the Iraqi President”.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The order was:</p>
<p>“… an expansion of a previous Presidential Finding designed to oust [Saddam] </p>
<p>Hussein”.</p>
<p>The Finding directed the CIA to “use all available tools, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increased support to Iraqi opposition groups and forces inside and outside Iraq </p>
<p>including money, weapons, equipment, training and intelligence information.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Expanded efforts to collect intelligence within the Iraqi government, military, </p>
<p>security service and overall population where pockets of intense anti-Hussein </p>
<p>sentiment have been detected.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Possible use of CIA and U.S. Special Forces teams, similar to those that </p>
<p>have been successfully deployed in Afghanistan since the Sept. 11 terrorist </p>
<p>attacks. Such forces would be authorized to kill Hussein if they were acting </p>
<p>in self-defense.”</p>
<p><b>The US perspective on Mr Blair’s position, pre-Crawford</b></p>
<p><b>552.  Secretary Powell told President Bush that Mr Blair:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>would want to present the strategic, tactical and public affairs lines he </b></p>
<p><b>believed would strengthen support for the US and UK; “common cause” in </b></p>

<p><b>recognised he would pay a political price for supporting the US on Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>and wanted to minimise that. UK voters would be looking for signs that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK and US were “equity partners in the special relationship”.</b></p>
<p><b>553. </b> Secretary Powell told President Bush that Mr Blair would want to discuss </p>
<p>“Afghanistan; Iraq; the Middle East; Russia and NATO enlargement; and trade and </p>
<p>development”.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>554. </b> Secretary Powell wrote that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… continues to stand by you and the US as we move forward on the war on </p>
<p>terrorism and Iraq. He will present to you the strategic, tactical and public affairs </p>
<p>lines that he believes will strengthen global support for our common cause. […]</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>“Blair and the UK are in Afghanistan with us for the long haul. He readily committed </p>
<p>to deploy 1700 commandos, even though his experts warn that British forces are </p>
<p>overstretched … […]. </p>
<p>“On Iraq, Blair will be with us should military operations be necessary. He is </p>
<p>convinced on two points: the threat is real; and success against Saddam will yield </p>
<p>more regional success. Aside from his foreign and defense secretaries, however, </p>
<p>Blair’s Cabinet shows signs of division, and the Labour Party and the British public </p>
<p>are unconvinced that military action is warranted now. Blair may suggest ideas </p>
<p>on how to (1) make a credible public case on current Iraqi threats to international </p>
<p>peace; (2) keep Iraq’s neighbours on our side; (3) handle calls for a UNSC blessing </p>
<p>that can increase support for us in the region and with UK and European audiences; </p>
<p>and (4) demonstrate that we have thought through ‘the day-after.’</p>
<p>“The UK will follow our lead in the Middle East, but Blair may seek greater US </p>
<p>engagement […] He will argue that continued terrorist violence and Israeli military </p>
<p>action are rapidly sapping European and Arab support for a tough line on Baghdad.</p>
<p>[…]</p>
<p>“… He is sharply criticised by the media for being too pro-US in foreign and security </p>
<p>policy, too arrogant and ‘presidential’ (not a compliment …</p>
<p>“Blair knows he may have to pay a political price for supporting us on Iraq, and </p>
<p>wants to minimize it. Nonetheless, he will stick with us on the big issues. His voters </p>
<p>will look for signs that Britain and America are truly equity partners in the special </p>
<p>relationship.”</p>
<p><b>555.  The US Embassy in London reported on 2 April that MPs in the Labour Party </b></p>
<p><b>were opposed to military action and identified the actions likely to be needed to </b></p>
<p><b>secure their support.</b></p>
<p><b>556.  Mr Blair’s challenge was to judge the timing and evolution of America’s Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>policy, and to bring his party and the British people on board, so that the UK could </b></p>
<p><b>be the “keystone” for any coalition the US wanted to build.</b></p>
<p><b>557. </b> On 2 April, a telegram from Ambassador William Farish, US Ambassador to the </p>
<p>UK, reported that “for a noticeable time after” President Bush had “identified Iraq’s </p>
<p>development of WMD and missiles as a serious threat” in his State of the Union speech </p>
<p>on 26 January, Mr Blair’s Government “essentially kept quiet on whether it agreed”.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That had “changed at the end of February” when Mr Blair “spoke out forcefully” at the </p>
<p>Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Australia. </p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>489</p>
<p><b>558. </b> The Embassy reported that the Government had a week later released a Foreign </p>
<p>Office briefing paper to the Parliamentary Labour Party “that outlined the case against </p>
<p>Iraq”. That had been followed by the article in <i>The Times</i> by Mr Straw [on 5 March] and </p>
<p>a similar piece by Mr Blair the following day. The subsequent “debate” on the issue in the </p>
<p>House of Commons was described as “sharp”, with opposition to military action going </p>
<p>“unfortunately, well beyond the ‘usual suspects’”. The large number of signatories of an </p>
<p>Early Day Motion opposing support for US military action, 130 of whom 100 were Labour </p>
<p>MPs, was “significant” and “many more … did not sign” but agreed with its thrust. The </p>
<p>MPs were seen to be reflecting overall voter opinion. </p>
<p><b>559. </b> Labour MPs who considered “themselves to be moderate and strongly pro-US” </p>
<p>had told the US Embassy that they needed “more evidence of Iraq’s connivance with </p>
<p>terrorism and/or willingness to use WMD before they could support HMG co-operation </p>
<p>with military action”. Labour MPs had “especially” raised “concerns about the reaction </p>
<p>of the Arab world”. “Several MPs” had also told the Embassy “that progress in the Middle </p>
<p>East Peace Process could defuse some of their concerns”. “Another element raised was </p>
<p>that there would be less negative fallout if military action were taken only after all other </p>
<p>options were seen to have been exhausted” and “virtually all MPs with whom we spoke” </p>
<p>wanted “the UN to endorse any military action”. MPs were worried:</p>
<p>“… that the US is ‘looking for another fight’ and will ‘ignore even its close friends </p>
<p>if they object’ … There is the impression … that the US is not acknowledging the </p>
<p>relevance of the UK to the US agenda.”</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Addressing what it would take to convince Labour Parliamentarians to support </p>
<p>military action against Iraq, Ambassador Farish wrote that widespread revulsion with </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime did not:</p>
<p>“… necessarily translate into support for war. Some MPs would endorse action if </p>
<p>they had proof that Iraq has continued to develop WMD since UN inspectors left. </p>
<p>More would follow if convinced that Iraq has succeeded in developing significant </p>
<p>WMD capability (not just CW, but BW and/or nuclear/radiological) and the missiles </p>
<p>to deliver it. Many more would follow if they see compelling evidence that Iraq </p>
<p>intends and plans to use such weapons. A clear majority would support military </p>
<p>action against Iraq if Saddam is implicated in the 9/11 attacks or other egregious </p>
<p>acts of terrorism. Other factors of influence include … Arab sentiment, progress in </p>
<p>the MEPP, UN support, civilian casualties, and having a plan that works. </p>
<p>“Since making his decision to move to a more robust public diplomacy on Iraq, </p>
<p>Blair plus Straw and … Hoon have made a string of tough statements. Blair was </p>
<p>especially forthright when standing alongside VP Cheney on March 11.” </p>
<p><b>561. </b> Ambassador Farish concluded:</p>
<p>“Blair has proved an excellent judge of political timing, and he will need to be </p>
<p>especially careful about when to launch a ramped-up campaign to build support </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>490</p>
<p>for action against Iraq. He will want neither to be too far in front, or behind, US </p>
<p>policy. As one FCO official pointed out to us, if Blair unleashes a full scale campaign </p>
<p>in Parliament and with the general public when Parliament returns from the Easter </p>
<p>recess, and the US policy turns out to be on a longer-term trajectory, when the time </p>
<p>comes for action, the PM may find that his preparations have come unglued. On the </p>
<p>other hand, if he waits too long, then the keystone of any coalition that we wish to </p>
<p>build may not be firmly in place. No doubt these are the calculations that Blair hopes </p>
<p>to firm up when he meets the President at Crawford …” </p>

<p>objective on Iraq as:</p>
<p>“Commitment from Bush to transparency and consultation. (The model is </p>
<p>Afghanistan.) We need to start US/UK military planning (i.e. access for UK military </p>

<p>The Iraq ‘Options Paper’ remained “current”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Annan met an Iraqi delegation on 7 March. The Iraqis had made no specific </p>
<p>commitments to co-operate with UN resolutions and posed 19 questions about </p>
<p>US/UK policies. The majority were polemics but some were about clarification </p>
<p>of resolution 1284. Mr Annan wanted the Security Council to answer those </p>
<p>questions before further talks scheduled for 18/19 April. The UK position was </p>
<p>that Mr Annan had no mandate to negotiate with Iraq and that he should urge </p>
<p>them to talk to UNMOVIC and the IAEA about readmitting weapons inspectors.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There was no war plan for Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Thinking so far had been on a broad, conceptual level. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A very small cell in Central Command in Florida had recently been set up </p>
<p>to do some planning and to think through the various options. </p>

<p>of the claim that he was not developing WMD; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the timing of possible military action. If a decision was taken to use military </p>
<p>action, that would not take place before late 2002/early 2003.</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Mr Blair said that it was important to go back to the United Nations and to present </p>
<p>that as an opportunity for Saddam Hussein to co-operate: </p>
<p>“… no one could doubt that the world would be a better place if there were regime </p>
<p>change in Iraq. He was sure it was right to go the inspectors’ route. But we would </p>
<p>have to give careful thought about how we framed the ultimatum to Saddam to allow </p>
<p>the inspectors to do their job.” </p>

<p>and play for time. That was why it was so important that they must be allowed in at </p>

<p><b>577. </b> Mr Blair considered that the US and UK would “still face the question of why </p>
<p>they had decided to act now; what had changed?” In his view one of the lessons of </p>
<p>11 September was that: “Failure to take action in good time meant that the risks would </p>
<p>only grow, and might force us to take much more costly action later.” </p>
<p><b>578. </b> Sir David Manning also recorded that, following a further conversation with </p>
<p>President Bush, Mr Blair had concluded that President Bush wanted to build a coalition, </p>
<p>and that had led him to dismiss pressure from some on the American right. </p>

<p>Mr Blair and President Bush had also discussed the first quarter of 2003 as a timeframe </p>
<p>for action against Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>581. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that, at Crawford:</p>
<p>“… [President] Bush acknowledged the possibility that Saddam would allow </p>

<p>to adjust our approach accordingly.</p>
<p>“So it was absolutely clear we were not signing up for a war … we were signing </p>
<p>up for going down the UN route and giving Saddam a chance to comply.”</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>582. </b> Asked if military options were discussed, Mr Powell replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t recall them getting into any sort of discussion of military options …”</p>
<p><b>583. </b> Mr Powell added that he thought Mr Blair’s message to President Bush was:</p>
<p>“… if you are going to do this, you have got to do this in the most intelligent manner </p>
<p>possible, like after Afghanistan, like after 9/11. You have got to put this on a political </p>

<p><b>588. </b> President Bush wrote that he and Mr Blair had:</p>

<p>consequences. I didn’t have a lot of faith in the UN. The Security Council had </p>

<p><b>592.  Mr Blair stated that “doing nothing” was not an option; the threat of WMD </b></p>
<p><b>was real and had to be dealt with. The lesson of 11 September was to ensure that </b></p>
<p><b>“groups” were not allowed to develop a capability they might use.</b></p>
<p><b>593.  In his memoir, Mr Blair characterised the message that he and President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush had delivered to Saddam Hussein as “change the regime attitude on WMD </b></p>
<p><b>inspections or face the prospect of changing regime”.</b></p>
<p><b>594. </b> In the press conference President Bush said that the bonds between the peoples </p>
<p>of the US and UK were “stronger than ever” and that they shared “common interests and </p>
<p>a common perspective on the important challenges of our times”.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> He was “extremely </p>
<p>grateful” for Mr Blair’s “courageous leadership” since 11 September, and the world </p>
<p>was “grateful for all that Great Britain has contributed in the war against terror”. He and </p>
<p>Mr Blair both understood that “defeating global terror requires a broad based, long-term </p>
<p>strategy” and “the importance of denying terrorists weapons of mass destruction”. They </p>
<p>had also had “extensive conversations about the situation in the Middle East” where </p>
<p>both nations were “strongly committed to finding a just settlement”. He and Mr Blair had </p>
<p>“agreed to work closely in the weeks and months ahead on these difficult issues”.</p>
<p><b>595. </b> Mr Blair said he agreed with President Bush on the Middle East and that they </p>
<p>had also discussed international terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. They had </p>
<p>agreed that “the issue of weapons of mass destruction cannot be ducked, it is a threat, </p>
<p>it is a danger to our world and we must heed that threat and act to prevent it being </p>
<p>realised”. In Afghanistan, it was important “not just that we root out the last remnants of </p>
<p>the Al Qaida terrorist network … but also that we help that country to go from being a </p>
<p>failed state … to a state that offers some hope of stability and prosperity for the future”. </p>
<p><b>596. </b> In response to questions about the need for military action in Iraq, Mr Bush said he </p>
<p>and Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… of course, talked about Iraq. We both recognise the danger of a man who </p>
<p>is willing to kill his own people harboring and developing weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction … He’s a man who obviously had something to hide.</p>
<p>“He told the world that he would show us that he would not develop weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and yet, over the past decade he has refused to do so. </p>
<p>And the Prime Minister and I both agree that he needs to prove that he isn’t </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>496</p>
<p><b>597. </b> Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… any sensible person … asking the question, would the region, the world, and not </p>
<p>least the ordinary Iraqi people be better off without the regime of Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>the only answer anyone could give … would be, yes.</p>
<p>“… how we approach this, is a matter for discussion … for considering all the </p>
<p>options. But a situation where he continues to be in breach of all the United Nations </p>
<p>resolutions, refusing to allow us to assess … whether and how he is developing </p>
<p>these weapons of mass destruction. Doing nothing is not an option … </p>
<p>“But the President is right to draw attention to the threat of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction. That threat is real. How we deal with it, that’s a matter we discuss. </p>
<p>But … we have to deal with it …”</p>
<p><b>598. </b> Asked whether removal of Saddam Hussein was now the policy of the British </p>
<p>Government, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… it has always been our policy that Iraq would be a better place without </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein. I don’t think anyone can be in any doubt about that for all the </p>
<p>reasons I have given. But how we proceed … how we make sure that this threat that </p>
<p>is posed by weapons of mass destruction is dealt with, that is a matter that is open. </p>
<p>And when the time comes for taking those decisions, we will tell people about those </p>
<p>decisions …”</p>
<p><b>599. </b> Asked whether regime change was a change in policy, President Bush replied that </p>
<p>it was not:</p>
<p>“… the worst thing that can happen is to allow the man to abrogate his promise, and </p>
<p>hook up with a terrorist network. And then all of a sudden you’ve got one of those </p>
<p>shadowy terrorist networks that have got an arsenal at their disposal, which could </p>
<p>create a situation in which nations down the road get blackmailed. We can’t let </p>
<p>that happen, we just can’t … And, obviously, the Prime Minister is somebody who </p>
<p>understands this clearly …”</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Asked about the absence of a direct linkage between Al Qaida and Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein, President Bush replied:</p>
<p>“… he wouldn’t accept that. But can’t they see the linkage between somebody who’s </p>
<p>willing to murder his own people and the danger of him possessing weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction, which he said he would not develop? I see the linkage between </p>
<p>someone who is willing … to use chemical weapons in order to keep himself in </p>
<p>power, and at the same time develop a weapon that could be aimed at Europe, </p>
<p>aimed at Israel, aimed anywhere, in order to affect foreign policy …</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine people not seeing the threat and not holding Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>accountable for what he said he would do, and we’re going to do that.<i> </i>History has </p>
<p>called us into action. The thing I admire about the Prime Minister is he doesn’t need </p>

<p>a poll or focus group to convince him the difference between right and wrong. And </p>
<p>it’s refreshing to see leaders speak with moral clarity when it comes to the defense </p>
<p>of freedom.</p>
<p>“… We will hold Saddam Hussein accountable for broken promises. And that’s what </p>
<p>a lot of our discussion … has been about. And … we are going to continue our </p>
<p>discussions.”</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“You talked about no linkage there. There is a reason why United Nations resolutions </p>
<p>were passed … calling upon him to stop developing weapons of mass destruction … </p>
<p>and that is because we know he has been developing these weapons.</p>
<p>“We know that those weapons constitute a threat. Three days after the 11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>September </p>
<p>when I made my first statement to the House of Commons … I specifically said </p>
<p>then that this issue of weapons of mass destruction has to be dealt with … [W]hat </p>
<p>happened on the 11th of September was a call to us to make sure that we didn’t </p>
<p>repeat the mistake of allowing groups to develop a destructive capability and hope </p>
<p>that, at some point, they weren’t going to use it. They develop that destructive </p>
<p>capability for a reason. </p>
<p>“Now we’ve made it very clear to you how we then proceed and how we deal with </p>
<p>this. All the options are open. And I think after the 11th September this President </p>
<p>showed that he proceeds in a calm and a measured and a sensible, but in a firm </p>
<p>way. Now that is precisely what we need in this situation too.” </p>
<p><b>602. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that he and President Bush had “delivered a strong </p>
<p>message” during the press conference, which he characterised as:</p>
<p>“It was basically: change the regime attitude on WMD inspections or face the </p>
<p>prospect of changing regime.”</p>
<p>231</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that the “worry” about the press conference was that </p>
<p>“we had a different position on regime change” and they had spent some time discussing </p>
<p>how to avoid exposing a “huge gulf between us”.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>College Station speech, 7 April 2002</b></p>
<p><b>604.  As suggested by Mr Powell, Mr Blair used his speech at College Station </b></p>
<p><b>on 7 April to argue for an internationalist approach in dealing with Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>605.  Mr Blair advocated a policy of “an enlightened self interest that put fighting </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>606.  Leaving Iraq to develop WMD in breach of its obligations to the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council was “not an option”, although the moment for decision on how to act had </b></p>
<p><b>not yet been reached. Saddam Hussein had to let the weapons inspectors back in </b></p>
<p><b>with unrestricted access.</b></p>
<p><b>607. </b> Mr Blair used his speech at the George Bush Senior Presidential Library at College </p>
<p>Station, Texas on 7 April to set out an internationalist approach drawing on his speech in </p>
<p>Chicago in 1999.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>608. </b> Mr Blair identified two views of international affairs: one, which was utilitarian, </p>
<p>where “each nation maximises its own self interest”; the other was utopian, where “we </p>
<p>tried to create a better world”. In Mr Blair’s view those two views were merging and he </p>
<p>advocated an approach of “an enlightened self interest that put fighting for our values at </p>
<p>the heart of the policies necessary to protect Our nations”. “Engagement in the world on </p>
<p>the basis of these values, not isolationism from it, is the hard headed pragmatism for the </p>
<p>21st century.” </p>
<p><b>609. </b> Citing the example of intervention in Kosovo, Mr Blair stated that it was “still </p>
<p>costing us time, effort and money, but it’s a lot less than if we had turned our back and </p>
<p>let the Balkans plunge into civil war”. </p>
<p><b>610. </b> Mr Blair described instability as “contagious” and that “the surest way to stability </p>
<p>is through … values of freedom, democracy and justice”. Promotion of those values was:</p>
<p>“… part of our long-term security and prosperity. We can’t intervene in every case. </p>
<p>Not all the wrongs of the world can be put right, but where disorder threatens us all, </p>
<p>we should act.” </p>
<p><b>611. </b> Mr Blair described the response to the terrorist attacks on 11 September as one </p>
<p>where “the world stood firm. America took the lead, but it led a coalition of extraordinarily </p>
<p>wide international proportions.” Mr Blair warned there was “a real danger we forget the </p>
<p>lessons of September 11”. </p>
<p><b>612. </b> In Mr Blair’s view there was “no escape” from facing events and “dealing with </p>
<p>them”. Four “policy positions” should guide those responses.</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Firstly:</p>
<p>“… the world works better when the US and EU stand together … </p>
<p>“… The international coalition matters. Where it operates the unintended </p>
<p>consequences of action are limited, the diplomatic parameters better fixed …”</p>
<p>233 </p>
<p>The National Archives, 7 April 2002, <i>Prime Minister’s Speech at the George Bush Senior </i></p>
<p><i>Presidential Library.</i></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>499</p>
<p><b>614. </b> Secondly: </p>
<p>“… we must be prepared to act where terrorism or weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>threaten us. The fight against international terrorism is right. We should pursue it </p>
<p>vigorously. Not just in Afghanistan but elsewhere. Not just by military means but by </p>
<p>disrupting the finances of terrorism … But there should be no let up. </p>
<p>“If necessary the action should be military and again, if necessary and justified, it </p>
<p>should involve regime change. I have been involved … in three conflicts involving </p>
<p>regime change …</p>
<p>“Britain is immensely proud of the part our forces have played and with the results </p>
<p>but I can honestly say that the people most pleased have been the people living </p>
<p>under the regime in question …</p>
<p>“We cannot, of course, intervene in all cases but where countries are engaged in </p>
<p>the terror or the WMD business, we should not shirk from confronting them. Some </p>
<p>can be offered a way out, a route to respectability. I hope in time that Syria, Iran </p>
<p>and even North Korea … A new relationship is on offer. But they must know that </p>
<p>sponsoring terrorism or WMD is not acceptable.</p>
<p>“As for Iraq, I know that some fear precipitate action. They needn’t. We will proceed </p>
<p>as we did after September 11, in a calm, measured, sensible but firm way. But </p>
<p>leaving Iraq to develop WMD, in flagrant breach of no less than nine separate UN </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions, refusing still to allow weapons inspectors back to do </p>
<p>their work properly, is not an option. The regime of Saddam is detestable. Brutal, </p>
<p>repressive, political opponents routinely tortured and executed: it is a regime without </p>
<p>a qualm in sacrificing the lives of its citizens to preserve itself, or starting wars with </p>
<p>neighbouring states and it has used chemical weapons against its own people.</p>
<p>“As I say, the moment for decision on how to act is not yet with us. But to allow </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction to be developed by a state like Iraq without let or </p>
<p>hindrance would be grossly to ignore the lessons of September 11 and we will not </p>
<p>do it. The message to Saddam is clear: he has to let the inspectors back in, anyone, </p>
<p>any time, any place that the international community demands.”</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Thirdly, quoting the plight of the Middle East, the dispute between India and </p>
<p>Pakistan and conflicts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sudan and Angola, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“… we should work hard to broker peace where conflict threatens a region’s stability </p>
<p>because we know the dangers of contagion …”</p>
<p><b>616. </b> Fourthly, Mr Blair argued:</p>
<p>“Prevention is better than cure. The reason it would be crazy for us to clear out of </p>
<p>Afghanistan once we had finished militarily, is that if it drifts back into instability, the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>same old problems will re-emerge. Stick at it and we can show, eventually, as in the </p>
<p>Balkans, the unstable starts to become stable.”</p>
<p><b>617. </b> In the concluding section of his speech, Mr Blair stated that an integrated approach </p>
<p>was needed. He was not suggesting that nothing should be done without unanimity: </p>
<p>“That would be a recipe for the lowest common denominator – a poor policy. I am </p>
<p>arguing that the values we believe in are worth fighting for … We shouldn’t be shy </p>
<p>of giving our actions not just the force of self-interest but moral force.</p>
<p>“And in reality, at a certain point these forces merge. When we defend our countries </p>
<p>… we aren’t just defending territory. We are defending what our nations believe in: </p>
<p>freedom, democracy, tolerance and respect towards others.</p>
<p>“… Fighting for these values is a cause the world needs …</p>
<p>“But if that’s what I and many others want … It means we don’t shirk our </p>
<p>responsibility. It means that when America is fighting for those values, then, however </p>
<p>tough, we fight with her. No grandstanding, no offering implausible but impractical </p>
<p>advice from the comfort of the touchline, no wishing away the hard not the easy </p>
<p>choices on terrorism and WMD, or making peace in the Middle East, but working </p>
<p>together, side by side.</p>
<p>“That is the only route I know to a stable world …</p>
<p>“If the world makes the right choices now – at this time of destiny – we will get there. </p>
<p>And Britain will be at America’s side in doing it.”</p>
<p><b>618. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had written the speech “pretty much … himself”. </p>
<p>He would make it clear that the UK would “support” the US on Iraq “but also make the </p>
<p>point about UN inspectors effectively as an ultimatum”.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>619. </b> The references in the speech to the UN and the use of the word “justified” </p>
<p>in relation to regime change were “strengthened” after the discussions with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>

<p>FCO on 10 April, providing additional points which Mr Ricketts had used in briefing EU </p>
<p>Ambassadors.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> In relation to Iraq, it stated:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister came away convinced that President Bush would act in a </p>
<p>calm, measured and sensible but firm way. There was no question of precipitate </p>
<p>action. But they agreed that Iraq’s WMD programmes were a major threat to the </p>
<p>international community, particularly when coupled with Saddam’s proven track </p>
<p>record on using these weapons. Letting that programme continue unhindered was </p>
<p>not an option. The Prime Minister and President Bush agreed that action in the UN </p>
<p>was the priority. It was essential to get the weapons inspectors deployed to begin </p>
<p>to assess the extent of the Iraqi WMD programmes. The Prime Minister had been </p>
<p>tough in his demand that Saddam must let the inspectors back in: ‘any one, any </p>
<p>time, any place that the international community demands’.” </p>
<p><b>Reports to Parliament</b></p>
<p><b>623.  Mr Straw was concerned about the potential reaction in Parliament to </b></p>
<p><b>developments on Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>624.  Mr Straw advised that Parliament should be given a chance to vote on </b></p>
<p><b>a substantive motion before any military action.</b></p>
<p><b>625.  Mr Straw warned Mr Blair that Lord Goldsmith had expressed “serious </b></p>
<p><b>doubt” about whether existing resolutions would provide “sufficient cover” </b></p>
<p><b>for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>626.  Mr Straw also advised that Mr Blair should avoid being “pinned down” </b></p>
<p><b>on whether a new UN resolution would be required to provide the legal basis </b></p>
<p><b>for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>627. </b> Mr Straw welcomed Mr Blair’s decision to make a statement to Parliament about </p>
<p>the discussions with President Bush but made a number of points in relation to Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair should concede that any military action in Iraq should be decided in a </p>
<p>debate on a substantive motion in the House of Commons, not a debate on the </p>
<p>adjournment. This was “quite a point of principle with many in the PLP”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The shift of focus to the re-admission of weapons inspectors was welcome and </p>
<p>would “greatly help in making the argument for military action if (as I suspect) </p>
<p>Iraq fails properly to comply”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>But it drew the UK and the US “inexorably into questions of cover in international </p>
<p>law for any such military action”. Lord Goldsmith had expressed “serious doubt” </p>
<p>that any existing resolution would provide “sufficient cover”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s “strong advice” was “not to get pinned down on the question … of </p>
<p>whether a new UNSC mandate would be needed for military action”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>should “readily acknowledge” that the UK had “always operated within the </p>
<p>framework of international law”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had asked for work on whether it would be possible to strengthen the </p>
<p>forthcoming resolution bringing the Goods Review List into operation “in respect </p>
<p>of weapons inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair could say that the document [for publication] on Iraq would be produced </p>
<p>“shortly”. In Mr Straw’s view the UK could “certainly get something out pretty </p>
<p>quickly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Early Day Motion signed by more than 150 members of the PLP had gained </p>
<p>support because “it spoke of no military action ‘at this time’; and called for </p>
<p>weapons inspectors to go back”.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>628.  During PMQs on 10 April, Mr Blair emphasised the threat Iraq posed to </b></p>
<p><b>the world, and the need for Saddam Hussein to comply with the UN resolutions </b></p>
<p><b>and allow weapons inspectors back into Iraq. The region would be a better </b></p>
<p><b>place without Saddam Hussein, but the method of achieving that was “open </b></p>
<p><b>to consultation and deliberation”.</b></p>
<p><b>629. </b> During PMQs on 10 April, Mr Iain Duncan Smith, leader of the Opposition, and </p>
<p>other MPs asked a number of questions on Iraq.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>630. </b> Stating that Iraq would “if left unchecked … be able to deploy its weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction against targets in western Europe, including the United Kingdom”, </p>
<p>Mr Duncan Smith asked Mr Blair:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… to confirm reports that he told President Bush … that if military action is </p>
<p>needed against Saddam Hussein, the British Government will support and, </p>
<p>if necessary contribute to it?”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… to confirm that getting rid of Saddam Hussein may now be an objective of </p>
<p>the Government”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether he believed that “countering the growing threat from Saddam Hussein” </p>
<p>was “about protecting lives in Britain and the lives of British forces abroad, and </p>
<p>not just about supporting our allies”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in a reference to his speech at College Station, whether Mr Blair believed that </p>
<p>those who refused to accept the need to act “misunderstand the nature of the </p>
<p>threat, or that they will simply refuse to accept any evidence they are given”. </p>

<p>503</p>
<p><b>631. </b> In response, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The time for military action has not yet arisen. However, there is no doubt at </p>
<p>all that the development of weapons of mass destruction by Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>poses a severe threat not just to the region, but to the wider world … [I]n my first </p>
<p>statement to the House … after 11 September, I made it clear that the issue of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction had to be, and should be, dealt with. How we deal </p>
<p>with it will be a matter for consultation and deliberation in the normal way. After </p>
<p>11 September, we proceeded in a calm and sensible way, and we shall do so </p>
<p>again, but we must confront the issue of weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… there is no doubt at all that the region would be a better place without </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein … the Iraqi people would rejoice most at Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>leaving office … that regime has a particular record: the Iran-Iraq war … the </p>
<p>annexation of Kuwait … and perhaps the most appalling act of all, the use of </p>
<p>chemical weapons on the Kurdish people … However, the method of achieving </p>
<p>that is … open to consultation and deliberation. When the judgements are made, </p>
<p>I have no doubt at all that this House – indeed, the whole country – will want to </p>
<p>debate the issue thoroughly.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… The key issue is that this is not something that has suddenly arisen … </p>
<p>Before 11 September, a whole series of negotiations took place about potential </p>
<p>new United Nations Security Council resolutions to put in place a better </p>
<p>sanctions regime, and about how we try to ensure that weapons inspectors get </p>
<p>back inside Iraq. The reason why the Security Council resolutions that were </p>
<p>originally proposed and passed demand that weapons inspections take place … </p>
<p>is precisely that the threat of weapons of mass destruction is real and present.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The issue is quite clear … Saddam Hussein has a very clear message from the </p>
<p>international community: the weapons inspectors should go back in – anyone, </p>
<p>any place, any time … Simply turning our backs on the issue of weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction is not an option. That is why I think it so important that we </p>
<p>stand with the United States in saying this issue is one that has to be, and will </p>
<p>be, confronted. We will do so in a sensible and measured way, but we cannot </p>
<p>allow a state of this nature to develop those weapons without let or hindrance.”</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Asked by Mr George Howarth (Labour) for an assurance that, before any military </p>
<p>action which might become necessary was contemplated, Saddam Hussein would be </p>
<p>“given every opportunity to comply with” the Security Council’s resolutions, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that Saddam Hussein was:</p>
<p>“… in defiance of the resolutions … However, he has the opportunity to comply now. </p>
<p>He is not in any doubt about what is necessary. The United Nations resolutions are </p>
<p>clear; there are nine and he is in breach of every one. The international community’s </p>
<p>position is also clear. Whatever people think about the action that will follow, he must </p>
<p>comply with the resolutions.”</p>

<p><b>635.  Mr Blair assured Parliament that the question of whether action in respect </b></p>

<p><b>636. </b> Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons on 10 April concentrated on the </p>
<p>crisis in the Middle East.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>637. </b> Addressing Iraq in the context of stability in the Middle East Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“There will be many occasions on which to debate Saddam Hussein’s flagrant </p>
<p>breach of successive UN resolutions on his weapons of mass destruction … [His] </p>
<p>regime is despicable, he is developing weapons of mass destruction, and we cannot </p>
<p>leave him doing so unchecked. He is a threat to his own people and to the region </p>
<p>and, if allowed to develop these weapons, a threat to us also.</p>
<p>“Doing nothing is not an option … [W]hat the international community should do </p>
<p>through the UN is challenge Saddam to let the inspectors back in without restriction </p>
<p>… If he really has nothing to hide, let him prove it.</p>
<p>“… no decisions on action have been taken. Our way of proceeding should be and </p>

<p><b>638. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, stated that the issue of Iraq:</p>

<p>among the Liberal Democrats and perhaps in sections of the Conservative party </p>
<p>… that unease is a reflection of genuine and sincerely held shades of opinion </p>
<p>throughout the country. Therefore, as a result of his discussions with President </p>
<p>Bush, will the Prime Minister acknowledge that no country can conduct a foreign </p>
<p>policy on the basis of ‘my ally, right or wrong’? Although I am not implying that the </p>
<p>Government are seeking to do so, there is a need for discernment. Many of us hope </p>
<p>that the Government may be able to temper some of the ideas of the American </p>

<p><b>639. </b> Mr Kennedy welcomed the fact that “if decisions on Iraq have to be reached at </p>
<p>some point in the future”, Mr Blair had confirmed the House of Commons would have </p>
<p>“an opportunity to debate the matter fully”. </p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Kennedy asked for confirmation that, if that stage was reached, </p>
<p>“incontrovertible evidence” would “be presented publicly, preferably at the level of </p>
<p>the United Nations Security Council”. That would be “most important, not just for </p>
<p>the legitimacy of any action under international law, but for maintaining a political </p>
<p>consensus”.</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… Some people will be against taking action in respect of Iraq no matter what </p>
<p>it does, but I accept entirely that there are many people who are concerned … </p>
<p>whether that action will be sensible, whether it will have the backing of international </p>
<p>law and whether proper thought has been given to the consequences for the wider </p>
<p>region … [T]hose are questions that we shall consider very carefully …</p>
<p>“… most people would accept … Saddam Hussein does lead a despicable regime, </p>
<p>that he is a threat in respect of weapons of mass destruction and that it is important </p>
<p>that we deal with that threat …</p>
<p>“… it is the case that Saddam Hussein poses a threat. That is why the UN </p>
<p>resolutions are there … [T]his is somebody who has a track record of absolutely </p>
<p>extraordinary aggression on his neighbours, on his own people, on everyone that </p>
<p>he sees advantage in being aggressive towards … That is why British pilots are </p>
<p>still flying over the No-Fly Zone in order to protect people in Iraq. That is why the </p>
<p>inspectors went in, could not do their job properly and then came out. </p>
<p>“… in the end we can all respond to concerns but we have to take decisions on </p>
<p>them. I can assure people that those decisions will be sensible and that the House </p>
<p>will have a proper opportunity to debate them before we act upon them.</p>
<p>“I have never taken the view that we support the US right or wrong … But I do </p>
<p>believe … that the relationship is special and … that it is a fundamental part of </p>
<p>British foreign policy and should remain so. All I can say is that in my dealings with </p>
<p>the Administration and with this President, we have found them immensely open and </p>
<p>consultative, and where they have acted they have acted not just with consultation </p>
<p>but in what I would regard as a sensible way.”</p>
<p><b>642. </b> Mr Douglas Hogg (Conservative) asked Mr Blair to tell President Bush that “many </p>
<p>in this country are not yet persuaded that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is </p>
<p>sufficiently great to justify military action, especially when the Middle East is in such </p>
<p>a turbulent state”.</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Mr Tam Dalyell (Labour) asked whether President Chirac (of France) had told </p>
<p>Mr Blair that he had taken “the thuggish young Vice-President of Iraq” [Saddam Hussein] </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>506</p>
<p>to the “French equivalent of Aldermaston”; and that it was to his (Mr Dalyell’s) discredit </p>
<p>that he “like many others, turned a blind eye to the huge amount of arms being poured </p>
<p>into Iraq in the 1980s by our country and others”. He also stated that Iraq had been </p>
<p>given a “clean bill of health on nuclear capacity” by the International Atomic Energy </p>
<p>Agency in January 2002; and that Mr Hoon had “an invitation to send a scientific </p>
<p>delegation of his choosing to Iraq at the beginning of March”. Mr Dalyell asked: “… </p>
<p>would it not be wise at least to go and talk to Iraq? If nothing comes of that, so be it, </p>
<p>but is it not high time that we started serious discussions?” </p>
<p><b>644. </b> Mr Blair replied that sending a team out to Iraq was “best done through the United </p>
<p>Nations” and that Saddam Hussein had “the opportunity to prove that he has nothing </p>
<p>to hide by letting the inspectors back in unconditionally”. There was “some truth” in the </p>
<p>point that everyone had turned a blind eye “to what was happening in Iraq in the 1980s” </p>
<p>but “what we are learning about the international community is that when we turn a </p>
<p>blind eye, sooner or later the problems come back to us full frontally. That is precisely </p>
<p>what happened in Afghanistan, and it is one reason why … we should certainly not </p>
<p>turn a blind eye to what Saddam Hussein is doing.” There was “no doubt” that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was “still trying to acquire nuclear capability and ballistic missile capability. </p>
<p>Furthermore, although we do not know what has happened, we suspect that the piles of </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons remain.”</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Mr Stuart Bell (Labour) referred to Saddam Hussein’s attacks using chemical </p>
<p>weapons on Halabja and other villages in northern Iraq in 1988 and 1999 which had </p>
<p>affected “4 million people” and asked: “Can we not remind ourselves of how important </p>
<p>it is that Saddam Hussein lives with UN resolutions, and the sooner he does so </p>
<p>the better?”</p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Blair replied that Mr Bell was “right to remind us of the nature of Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime and the way it deals with its political opponents”. He added that “most people </p>
<p>realise that” Saddam Hussein “constitutes a threat”.</p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Robert Wareing (Labour) stated that everyone would agree that the “world </p>
<p>would be better off without” Saddam Hussein’s regime, but Mr Bradshaw had told the </p>
<p>House that “the objective of British foreign policy was to remove the threat of Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons and not to replace the Iraqi Government, which was described as a matter for </p>
<p>the people of Iraq”. President Clinton had stated that sanctions “must remain as long as </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein lasted”. </p>
<p><b>648. </b> Mr Wareing asked:</p>
<p>“What is the current view and policy of the British Government? If they take the latter </p>
<p>position, there is no incentive to get the current regime in Iraq to change tack and </p>
<p>allow the inspectors back in. I happen to remember that, initially, the inspectors left </p>
<p>of their own accord; the difficulty now is to get them back in.”</p>

<p>3.2  |  Development of UK strategy and options, January to April 2002 – “axis of evil” to Crawford</p>
<p>507</p>
<p><b>649. </b> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Of course, the policy is to protect ourselves against weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>but obviously that cannot be divorced from the regime, because it is the regime that </p>
<p>is responsible … regime change in Iraq has been the policy of successive American </p>
<p>Governments … precisely because of the fear of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>… [I]t is for that very reason that the international community has said to Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein, ‘Let the inspectors back in’. That is what I am saying, but it must be done </p>
<p>unconditionally.” </p>
<p><b>650. </b> In relation to Mr Blair’s comments about Saddam Hussein’s chemical weapons </p>
<p>attacks on the Kurds, Ms Joyce Quin (Labour) asked Mr Blair to confirm that “the </p>
<p>maintenance of the breadth of the international coalition against terrorism” remained </p>
<p>“an important priority for him and President Bush”. She stated that it was:</p>
<p>“… important to ensure that those who have already been victims … will not suffer </p>
<p>a second time in any action against Iraq. Indeed we should not repeat the mistakes </p>
<p>of the past, in which one evil regime was replaced by another, but try to create as </p>
<p>far as possible the conditions for a multi-ethnic, religiously tolerant, representative </p>
<p>regime in Iraq, if and when Saddam Hussein’s regime is changed.” </p>
<p><b>651. </b> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“I strongly agree … about the international coalition. It is important that we build </p>
<p>as much support as possible for any action that we may undertake. She is entirely </p>
<p>right that, if the regime in Iraq is to change, it is important that it changes to one that </p>
<p>is genuinely broad based. I hope that we have provided some symbol of our good </p>
<p>intentions … by what has happened in Afghanistan … I am sure that she, like me </p>
<p>and many others … would be one of the first to say that many people in Iraq would </p>
<p>rejoice at Saddam Hussein’s departure. I hope that at some stage we shall be able </p>
<p>to furnish the House with details of the way in which his regime operates, because </p>
<p>its brutality is scarcely believable.</p>
<p>“It is important to proceed in a measured way. As I said in my speech in Texas, </p>
<p>I have been involved in three regime changes … and I can honestly say that we </p>
<p>should not regret any of them. Let us proceed with care … we must ensure that, </p>
<p>if we ever get a regime change in Iraq, what follows is an improvement on what </p>
<p>is there now.” </p>
<p><b>652. </b> Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru) welcomed Mr Blair’s reference to seeking an early </p>
<p>United Nations Security Council resolution but asked whether one would be “sought </p>
<p>before any further action is taken against Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>653. </b> Mr Blair replied: “The time for debating any legal basis of action against Iraq </p>
<p>is when we take such action.”</p>

<p><b>Cabinet, 11 April 2002</b></p>
<p><b>654.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 11 April that regime change in Iraq was greatly to be </b></p>
<p><b>desired but no plans for achieving that had been tabled during his discussions </b></p>
<p><b>with President Bush at Crawford.</b></p>
<p><b>655.  Reflecting Mr Straw’s advice, Mr Blair emphasised to Cabinet on 11 April that </b></p>
<p><b>it would be important for the Government not to “tie its hands” in relation to the </b></p>
<p><b>need for a further Security Council resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>656.  Mr Blair had stated publicly that doing nothing was not an option, and that </b></p>
<p><b>the threat from Iraq had to be dealt with.</b></p>
<p><b>657.  Mr Blair suggested that the US Government recognised the need to embark </b></p>
<p><b>on a process involving a clear ultimatum and an effort to gather international </b></p>
<p><b>consensus for action.</b></p>
<p><b>658.  Mr Blair did not disclose that he had informed Vice President Cheney on </b></p>
<p><b>11 March that the UK would help the US to achieve its objective of regime change </b></p>
<p><b>provided that there was a clever plan. </b></p>
<p><b>659. </b> Mr Blair reported his discussions with President Bush to Cabinet on 11 April.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He told colleagues that the talks with President Bush had been dominated by events </p>
<p>in Israel and the Occupied Territories. </p>
<p><b>660. </b> On Iraq, Mr Blair said that the US Government wanted to see a change of regime, </p>
<p>which was greatly to be desired. No plans for achieving that had, however, been tabled. </p>
<p>The significance of the crisis in Israel and the Occupied Territories for policy in Iraq was </p>
<p>recognised. He had consulted his hosts about his speech, at College Station on 7 April, </p>
<p>which had made clear that Iraq should unconditionally permit UN weapons inspectors to </p>
<p>return. That suggested the US Government recognised the need to embark on a process </p>
<p>involving a clear ultimatum and an effort to gather international consensus for action. </p>
<p><b>661. </b> In the subsequent discussion a number of points were made. Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A UN resolution would be helpful in cementing support both internationally and </p>
<p>in the UK for any military action against the Iraqi regime. It would, however, </p>
<p>be important not to become boxed in by stating that a UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolution would be a necessary pre-condition for military action against the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was in breach of nine UN resolutions. He could avert action by </p>
<p>the international community if he were to abide by those resolutions. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was important to encourage the US to remain engaged in the Middle East and </p>
<p>to take account of the concerns of the international community, including the </p>
<p>Secretary-General of the UN.</p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 11 April 2002. </p>

<p>509</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The impact of events in the Middle East on attitudes among the ethnic minorities </p>
<p>in the UK, and the encouragement that could give to political extremists, should </p>
<p>not be under-estimated. </p>
<p><b>662. </b> Mr Blair concluded that it was important to maintain the maximum possible level </p>
<p>of international support for policy towards the Middle East, including Iraq. Given the </p>
<p>impossibility of foreseeing precisely how events would unfold, it was important for the </p>
<p>Government not to “tie its hands”. If Saddam Hussein were to reject a clear ultimatum on </p>
<p>the return of weapons inspectors, there would be widespread understanding of the need </p>
<p>to take appropriate action. </p>
<p><b>663. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote that there had been “a full Cabinet </p>
<p>discussion” after the visit on 11 April “where we set out our objectives”.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>664. </b> Asked whether the Cabinet was discussing regime change and how it might have </p>
<p>been effected, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… from 11 April … the Cabinet was discussing this. We are going to have to deal </p>
<p>with this issue now. Everybody knew that the Americans were taking a different and </p>
<p>stronger line. The issue was very simple. He [Saddam Hussein] either had a change </p>
<p>of heart, or regime change was on the agenda. That was clear from the minutes, </p>
<p>from the discussion at Cabinet and indeed from the whole of the public discourse </p>
<p>around this.</p>
<p>“Now you could have regime change happening in a number of different ways. There </p>
<p>didn’t need to be military action but the likelihood was that’s what would happen.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>665. </b> Lord Wilson confirmed that the flavour of the discussion was of turmoil in the </p>
<p>Middle East and the Arab world, although “we were left in no doubt by Crawford … that </p>
<p>the Americans wanted regime change”, which “in a sense” was “not news”. In addition </p>
<p>to Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, four Cabinet Ministers had spoken on Iraq.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>666. </b> Lord Wilson described Mr Blair’s report to Cabinet on 11 April as:</p>
<p>“… skilfully touching on the things Cabinet had been concerned about and </p>
<p>reassuring them that nothing was imminent and he was using his influence to bring </p>
<p>the American President in the direction he wanted to go. Indeed, I think he may have </p>
<p>been congratulated by one Cabinet Minister on shifting American thinking in … the </p>
<p>direction of the United [Nations].” </p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>667. </b> Lord Wilson added that he did not think “anyone would have gone away thinking </p>
<p>they had authorised a course of action likely to lead to military action”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>668.  Mr Straw continued to make clear, as he had suggested in his letter of </b></p>
<p><b>25 March, that action in support of regime change in Iraq would be justified only </b></p>
<p><b>as a means to remove the threat from WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>669. </b> SIS activity was discussed in a meeting with Mr Straw and Mr Wright on 11 April.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>670. </b> Mr McDonald’s record of the meeting stated that Mr Straw had noted that:</p>
<p>“… legally and politically, regime change in Iraq was justified only as a means to </p>
<p>the end of removing the threat of their WMD. If Saddam Hussein were to allow </p>
<p>in weapons inspectors, that would change the equation: to seek regime change </p>
<p>would no longer be possible for us because our desired end state would have </p>
<p>been achieved.”</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Mr Straw also agreed with Mr Wright that the focus was on operations which built </p>
<p>up the forces of opposition and democracy.</p>
<p><b>The perceptions of key officials</b></p>
<p><b>672.  The evidence offered to the Inquiry and accounts in memoirs provide some </b></p>
<p><b>indications of the perceptions held by key officials about the UK’s strategy before </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Crawford. </b></p>
<p><b>673. </b> In his memoir, Sir Christopher Meyer described his view of the position before </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> He wrote that the debate about Iraq in </p>
<p>Washington “had become deafening”, although on the eve of Mr Blair’s visit the </p>
<p>escalating violence between Israel and the Palestinians had “reached such a pitch that </p>
<p>for a while it pushed Iraq into the background”. It had been clear to him that President </p>
<p>Bush was:</p>
<p>“… determined to implement the official American policy of regime change; but the </p>
<p>how and when … were uncertain. It made war probable but not inevitable … There </p>
<p>were one or two people in Washington, whose judgement I respected, who thought </p>
<p>that when Bush finally realised the scale of his Iraqi ambition, he would see that the </p>
<p>risk was too great.</p>
<p>“It was time to put our fix into American thinking before it coagulated …”</p>
<p><b>674. </b> Sir Christopher added: </p>
<p>“The central issue was to influence the Americans. Blair had already taken the </p>
<p>decision to support regime change, though he was discreet about saying so </p>
<p>in public. It would be fruitless to challenge a fixed … policy that had bipartisan </p>
<p>support in the US. It was hard to see how Saddam could be de-fanged without </p>

<p>being removed from power. Blair was also wedded to the proposition that, to have </p>
<p>influence in Washington, it was necessary to hug the Americans close …”</p>
<p><b>675. </b> Sir Christopher wrote that “Support for regime change caused deep concern inside </p>
<p>the Foreign Office.” There were questions about the legal basis and uncertainties about </p>
<p>the consequences of action. Those were tough questions on which the UK wanted the </p>
<p>US to focus. In his conversation with Mr Wolfowitz on 17 March, Sir Christopher had </p>
<p>taken his cue from Sir David Manning’s exchanges with Dr Rice, and:</p>
<p>“To reinforce my credentials as something to say worth listening to, I emphasised the </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s commitment to regime change. I wanted Wolfowitz to know that we </p>
<p>were starting from the same premise, and that in Britain it was not without political </p>
<p>cost. It was the diplomacy of ‘Yes, but …” </p>
<p><b>676. </b> Sir Christopher described the approach as identifying tough questions which </p>
<p>would need to be answered if the US wanted coalition partners and support from the </p>
<p>international community, including the need for a “clever plan which convinced people </p>
<p>that there was a legal basis for toppling Saddam”. </p>
<p><b>677. </b> Sir Christopher told the Inquiry that, in his speech at College Station on 7 April </p>
<p>2002, Mr Blair had tried to:</p>
<p>“… draw the lessons of 9/11 and apply them to the situation in Iraq, which led, I </p>
<p>think, not inadvertently, but deliberately, to a conflation of the threat by Usama Bin </p>
<p>Laden and Saddam Hussein.”</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>678. </b> Sir Christopher added that the speech represented “a tightening of the UK/US </p>
<p>alliance and the degree of convergence on the danger that Saddam Hussein presented”. </p>
<p>It drew on Mr Blair’s speech on humanitarian intervention in Chicago in 1999, and “was </p>
<p>a rather sophisticated argument for pre-emption”, that Saddam Hussein’s record was </p>
<p>“too bad” and the potential threat he presented could not be ignored.</p>
<p><b>679. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry that by the time Mr Blair and President Bush </p>
<p>met at Crawford:</p>
<p>“… they weren’t there to talk about containment or sharpening sanctions. There </p>
<p>had been a sea change in attitudes in the US Administration to which the British </p>
<p>Government, progressively from October [2001] onwards, had to adapt and make </p>
<p>up its mind where it stood.”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>680. </b> In his statement, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote:</p>

<p>preparations might have begun in Washington for an attack on Iraq. Even </p>
<p>then I gave these relatively little credence … my conception of the difficulties </p>
<p>and downsides of taking on such a task outweighed my understanding of the </p>
<p>determination of the Bush Administration to undertake such an initiative.”</p>
<p>251</p>
<p><b>681. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“It wasn’t until the Crawford meeting … that I realised that the United Kingdom was </p>
<p>being drawn into quite a different sort of discussion, but that discussion was not </p>
<p>made totally visible to me … nor did I have any instructions to behave any differently </p>
<p>in the United Nations as a result of what might have been going on in bilateral </p>
<p>discussions with the United States.</p>
<p>“… I wasn’t being politically naive, but I wasn’t being politically informed either, and </p>
<p>I had a job to do to maximise the strength of the United Nations instruments on Iraq </p>
<p>at the time … and that continued to mean acting under the resolutions we had.”</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>682. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Our view, the Prime Minister’s view, the British Government’s view throughout </p>
<p>this episode was that the aim was disarmament. It was not regime change. The </p>
<p>Prime Minister never made any secret of the fact that if the result of disarming </p>
<p>Saddam was regime change, he thought this would be a positive thing, but, for </p>
<p>the Americans, it was. It was, ‘We want regime change in order to disarm Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein.’”</p>
<p>253</p>
<p><b>683. </b> Sir David told the Inquiry that at Crawford Mr Blair was saying:</p>
<p>“Yes, there is a route through this that is a peaceful and international one, and </p>
<p>it is through the UN, but, if it doesn’t work, we will be ready to undertake regime </p>
<p>change.”</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>684. </b> Sir David Manning believed Mr Blair had wanted to influence US policy </p>
<p>towards Iraq:</p>
<p>“I think that when it became clear … that the United States was thinking of moving </p>
<p>its policy forward towards regime change, he [Mr Blair] wanted to try and influence </p>
<p>the United States and get it to stay in the UN, to go the UN route, which is what we </p>
<p>spent the rest of the year trying to do, but he was willing to signal that he accepted </p>
<p>that disarmament might not be achieved through the UN route.</p>
<p>“But I don’t think he felt … that these were moments of decision in February and </p>
<p>March before he went to Crawford. I think he saw that much more as an attempt </p>

<p>to find out where the Americans had got to, but to impress on them his own </p>
<p>conviction that we needed to ensure that inspections were continued.”</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Asked whether the US had already changed tack, Sir David replied: </p>
<p>“I think you are right about the Americans moving onto a different track … the </p>
<p>perception … was that containment was probably finished … but I don’t think, at </p>
<p>that stage, there was a view in London … that we had completely given up on </p>
<p>containment. We were waiting … to see what sort of pressure the US would produce </p>
<p>in the light of the debate that we knew was taking place in handling Iraq. </p>
<p>“Our concern … and the Prime Minister’s view … was that it [action on Iraq] must </p>
<p>be retained within the United Nations … I don’t think he thought … that it was likely </p>
<p>that the President … would accept containment any longer, and I suspect that he </p>
<p>probably didn’t think containment was relevant any longer; but I think he did think </p>
<p>that there was everything to play for in terms of trying to ensure that the Iraq problem </p>

<p>unilaterally for regime change.”</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>686. </b> Asked when Iraq became a priority for the UK, Sir David Manning responded:</p>
<p>“In the early months of 2002 … we knew that we had to deal with Iraq as a more </p>
<p>pressing priority because the US Administration were going to insist on making </p>
<p>it more prominent. They were concerned about a threat from Iraq in a new way </p>
<p>because they believed threats internationally were now threats they had to meet </p>
<p>rather than contain.</p>
<p>“… Iraq was given a salience, it was given an importance because the US </p>
<p>Administration was determined to confront the international community over this </p>
<p>perceived threat. Therefore we had to respond to that.”</p>

<p>Sir David Manning replied:</p>

<p>This was something that the Prime Minister wanted resolved in an international </p>
<p>context … he wanted the inspectors to be reintroduced into Iraq … and he believed </p>
<p>international pressure was the best way of trying to ensure that happened, and </p>
<p>that in turn was the best way of managing the Iraq crisis that had been given a new </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>514</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that he disagreed with Sir Christopher Meyer’s </p>
<p>analysis that Mr Blair’s position had shifted from a policy of containment and </p>
<p>disarmament to one of regime change.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> He described Mr Blair’s policy, before </p>
<p>Crawford, at Crawford and afterwards as “to pursue disarmament of Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>through the United Nations”. </p>
<p><b>689. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that the policy:</p>
<p>“… was to persuade the Americans to take a multilateral approach, to put the focus </p>
<p>on the UN, to give Saddam a chance to comply with the UN Resolutions and to force </p>
<p>the issue there … the only way you can get Saddam’s attention is by the threat of </p>
<p>military force.”</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Powell added that it was “a shift to a policy of disarmament through the UN”, </p>
<p>leading to military action and regime change, “If that is what was necessary to remove </p>
<p>the threat of weapons of mass destruction”. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> Asked whether he thought “the Foreign and Defence Secretaries were trying to pull </p>
<p>back on the Prime Minister’s reins in giving advice”, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Yes, I think probably I did. How far, I’m not sure, but … certainly the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary was keen … to make it very clear there were risks … and not to be more </p>
<p>forward than was wise for the Government, especially when he didn’t know exactly </p>
<p>where the policy was going to take us … I think it probably was an attempt to say </p>
<p>let’s just see where the Americans are going on this. It’s a position I would certainly </p>
<p>sympathise with.”</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>692. </b> In the context of a reference during his evidence about his visit to the US in March </p>
<p>2002, to his strong personal view that the issue was disarmament not regime change, </p>
<p>Sir David Manning was asked how much he was trying to influence Mr Blair.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> Sir David </p>
<p>responded that he:</p>
<p>“… certainly argued strongly for the UN route with the Prime Minister, and </p>
<p>subsequently argued very strongly that we needed two resolutions. I also argued </p>
<p>very strongly with him that we needed more time.”</p>

<p>515</p>
<p><b>694. </b> Asked about the rationale for focusing on Iraq first, Sir David responded that he </p>
<p>thought there were a number of reasons. One was:</p>
<p>“… that the Americans were determined to focus on it. We weren’t given a choice </p>
<p>… In the international system, whether it wanted to have a good look at Iraq at this </p>
<p>point or not, it really had no option because Bush was going to do this …</p>
<p>“The question was therefore how far you could get inside the argument and try and </p>
<p>shape it and shape what happened, and I think that’s where the Prime Minister was </p>
<p>in April. They are going to do something. We have to try and be in a position to affect </p>
<p>the policy.</p>
<p>“He believed … that given his own relationship with Bush, he probably had a good </p>
<p>chance of doing that. So therefore he was determined to have that discussion, </p>
<p>though … he didn’t need any persuading that Iraq was a problem … he felt Iraq </p>
<p>was a serious destabilising influence in the system, but I don’t want to pretend that </p>
<p>it would have been his top priority at this stage if it hadn’t been one of Bush’s top </p>
<p>priorities … it wouldn’t …”</p>
<p>263</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Asked whether Mr Blair was more forward leaning about getting rid of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein than his principal advisers, including Sir David himself, Sir David responded </p>
<p>that, in terms of Mr Blair’s position as a very prominent actor on the international stage:</p>
<p>“Iraq fits into a pattern … interventionism in the Balkans … Kosovo … Sierra Leone </p>
<p>… Afghanistan, he’s very much an activist … much more inclined to push and take </p>
<p>the bold action than probably other members of his Cabinet.”</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Asked if Mr Blair would have listened to a contrary opinion if one had been “argued </p>
<p>powerfully” at the Chequers meeting, Sir David told the Inquiry that Mr Blair would have </p>
<p>listened but:</p>
<p>“… he was somebody who was very comfortable with his own convictions … </p>
<p>believed he had a capacity to influence the international system in quite profound </p>
<p>ways, had a quite a lot of success doing this … he had a sense that he could </p>
<p>actually act for the good, he could change things, and that this was absolutely a role </p>
<p>that he felt he could command.”</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>697. </b> Sir David added:</p>
<p>“I don’t want to suggest he’s not open to argument … He was absolutely up for </p>
<p>argument and didn’t hold it against you. But I think this is part of a deep conviction </p>
<p>that there are moments when you can change things, you’ve got to have the </p>
<p>courage to do it, and he was up for that.”</p>

<p><b>698. </b> Sir David described Mr Blair’s objectives at Crawford as:</p>
<p>“I think it was to find out where Bush was going [on Iraq] … What did Bush really </p>
<p>think and what were Bush’s intentions […]</p>
<p>“… he said to me afterwards … Bush is interested in going the international route </p>
<p>and he’s not simply going to become – I can’t remember his wording – the creature </p>
<p>of the American right or something like this.”</p>
<p>“He came away … reassured that it was quite possible to persuade Bush to use the </p>
<p>international system, rather than to bypass it.”</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>699. </b> Sir David Manning did not believe that in April and May 2002 Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… made his mind up he was going to send troops. I think he was always ready to </p>
<p>do it, but he always hoped he wouldn’t have to … I certainly didn’t feel [Crawford] </p>
<p>was a moment of decision, no.”</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>700. </b> Sir David added that the discussion at Crawford had been “evolutionary” but it had </p>

<p><b>701. </b> Sir David stated: </p>
<p>“But I think the reality, as far as the … international politics were concerned, that </p>

<p>“From my recollection by the time I joined Downing Street the British Government </p>
<p>had essentially decided that continued containment was not going to work … we </p>
<p>were on a track of … dealing with Iraq’s WMD … what dealing meant was to be </p>
<p>determined by the policy over the coming months.”</p>

<p><b>703. </b> Mr Rycroft told the Inquiry:</p>

<p>back in to do their work properly and compliance with the UN resolutions, or, in the </p>
<p>final analysis … if sanctions could not contain him and he was not prepared to allow </p>
<p>the inspectors back in, then the option of removing Saddam was there.”</p>

<p><b>708. </b> Asked whether he had had a meeting to discuss the ‘Options Paper’ and take </p>
<p>decisions on it, Mr Blair told the Inquiry he had talked to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, there </p>
<p>had been a meeting of “the key people to decide where we were then going to go”, and </p>
<p>the meeting at Chequers had been a “very structured debate”.</p>

<p><b>709. </b> Mr Blair confirmed that the ‘Options Paper’ had not been discussed in Cabinet.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>710. </b> Mr Blair subsequently told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Well, the ‘Options Paper’ really said two things. It said you can either go for </p>
<p>containment. We can’t guarantee that that’s successful. He will probably continue </p>
<p>to develop his programmes and be a threat, but nonetheless that is one option. The </p>
<p>other option is regime change.”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>711. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… there’s nothing in those papers … that wasn’t surfaced as part of the discussion </p>
<p>… [which] all the way through was: what is the judgment? … That was certainly part </p>
<p>of the discussion that was going on in Cabinet. Now you can say, and I would be </p>
<p>perfectly happy if you did say, look it is better to disclose all those or give everybody </p>

<p>a copy of those papers. I certainly didn’t say they shouldn’t be, but the content of </p>
<p>those papers, that is something that was very, very adequately discussed and the </p>
<p>issue was clear in the end. There was not a great dispute about what we thought </p>
<p>about the facts. The facts were he is continuing to develop WMD. He has the </p>
<p>intention of doing that. It is crucial to his regime. On the other hand, so far we have </p>
<p>contained him.”</p>
<p><b>712. </b> Asked what Admiral Boyce had advised (at Chequers), Mr Blair told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>the concern was to make sure that the UK “got alongside” any US planning and “did it </p>
<p>[the military campaign] as quickly as possible”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>713. </b> Mr Blair described the Chequers meeting in his memoir as a meeting:</p>
<p>“… with senior army officers … not specifically in preparation for Crawford, but to </p>
<p>kick around the basic questions of what military action might entail. There had been </p>
<p>discussion about whether our aim was focused on WMD or regime change. I had </p>
<p>emphasised that the two were linked, and also that it was hard at this point to say </p>
<p>that the nature of the WMD threat specific to Iraq had changed demonstrably in the </p>
<p>last few years. It was the assessment of risk that had.”</p>
<p> 279</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>714. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, after the meeting at Chequers and before the meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush, there had been “quite an intensive interaction on this whole issue </p>
<p>… smart sanctions, because I needed to get a sense of whether this policy … was really </p>
<p>going to be a runner or not”.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>715. </b> Asked whether by the time of the meeting at Crawford he had reached the point </p>
<p>of regarding the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime as a valid objective of UK policy, </p>
<p>Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“No, the absolutely key issue was the WMD issue …” </p>
<p>281</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>716. </b> Asked what he intended to achieve at Crawford, Mr Blair replied he intended:</p>

<p>of how our own strategy was going to have to evolve in the light of that.”</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>717. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that “nothing was actually decided at Crawford”, and </p>
<p>explained the importance of a “close and strong relationship” between a British Prime </p>
<p>Minister and the President of the US and being able to discuss what the issues were </p>
<p>“in a very frank way”. His conversation with President Bush had been “less to do with </p>

<p>part of the conversation had been about his view that “dealing with the various different </p>
<p>dimensions” of the “whole issue … to do with unrepresentative extremism within Islam in </p>
<p>a different way”. He “wanted to persuade President Bush, but also get a sense from him </p>
<p>where he was on that broader issue”.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“The only commitment I gave, and I gave this very openly, at the meeting was a </p>
<p>commitment to deal with Saddam.” </p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>719. </b> Asked whether he and President Bush were agreed on the ends but not the </p>
<p>means, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We were agreed on both … we were agreed that we had to confront this issue, that </p>
<p>Saddam had to come back into compliance with the international community, and … </p>
<p>the method is open …</p>
<p>“… one major part of what President Bush was saying to me was just to express his </p>
<p>fear … that if we weren’t prepared to act in a really strong way, then we ran the risk </p>
<p>of sending a disastrous signal to the world.” </p>
<p>285</p>

<p><b>720. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he could not “explain how people have come to the </p>

<p>he had said at the subsequent press conference.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>721. </b> Asked what conclusions President Bush would have taken from the meeting about </p>
<p>his commitment to deal with Saddam Hussein through military action, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“I think he took … exactly what he should have taken, which is that, if it came to </p>
<p>military action because there was no way of dealing with this diplomatically, we </p>
<p>would be with him … because, as I had set out publicly … we had to confront </p>
<p>this issue, it could be confronted by a sanctions framework that was effective … </p>
<p>we didn’t have one. It could be confronted by a UN inspections framework … or, </p>
<p>alternatively, it would have to be confronted by force … We had been through this </p>
<p>with Saddam several times … the fact is that force was always an option. What </p>
<p>changed after September 11 was this, if necessary, and there was no other way of </p>

<p><b>722. </b> Asked whether the commitment had been given for tactical reasons, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t so much for tactical reasons … I believed if you wanted to make a real </p>
<p>change to this whole issue – this is very important to understanding … my strategic </p>
<p>thinking …</p>
<p>“What I believed we confronted was a new threat … based, not on political ideology, </p>
<p>but on religious fanaticism …</p>
<p>“What I was trying to set out, not for tactical reasons, but for deep strategic reasons, </p>
<p>is: what did we need to do to make a successful assault on this ideology that was so </p>
<p>dangerous? Therefore, the Middle East Peace Process was absolutely fundamental </p>
<p>… to dealing with this issue.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>723. </b> Asked if there was an identity of view at the meeting on how to deal with Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We were of course pushing the UN route … the American view was regime change </p>
<p>… because they didn’t believe Saddam would ever, in good faith, give up his WMD </p>
<p>ambitions or programmes.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>724. </b> Asked if his view of the means to achieve the objective was different from the US </p>
<p>because it was not keen on the UN route, Mr Blair replied: </p>
<p>“We did have to persuade them [the US], although I think it is fair to say that, even </p>
<p>at that meeting [Crawford], President Bush made it clear that America would have </p>
<p>to adjust policy if Saddam let the inspectors back in and the inspectors were able </p>
<p>to function properly.”</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Addressing the key messages in his speech at College Station, Mr Blair drew </p>
<p>the Inquiry’s attention to his argument that the international community should not </p>
<p>shrink from confronting regimes which were “engaged in terror or WMD”. Some could </p>
<p>be offered “a route to respectability” but, in relation to Iraq the point he was making </p>
<p>was that:</p>
<p>“… the issue was very simple … the need to make absolutely clear that from now </p>
<p>on you did not defy the international community on WMD.”</p>
<p> 291</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>726. </b> Mr Blair added that when a regime was brutal and oppressive it was a bigger threat </p>

<p>521</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Mr Blair said that Iraq posed a “conjoined” threat, “it was an appalling regime and </p>
<p>we couldn’t run the risk of such a regime being allowed to develop WMD”.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the American position, after the passage of the Iraq </p>
<p>Liberation Act in 1998, was “for regime change” because it did not “trust he [Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein] is ever going to give up his WMD ambitions”. The UK position was: “We have </p>
<p>to deal with WMD ambitions. If that means regime change, so be it.” Mr Blair’s view was </p>
<p>that they were “different ways of expressing the same proposition”.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>729. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that “planning was inevitable and right, not because </p>
<p>war was inevitable but because it was an option and … had to be planned for”. The </p>
<p>meeting in Crawford was “the first time we got to grips with it [Iraq] properly”.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>730. </b> Mr Blair continued:</p>
<p>“From my standpoint, by this time, I had resolved in my own mind that removing </p>
<p>Saddam would do the world, and most particularly the Iraqi people, a service. </p>
<p>Though I knew regime change could not be our policy, I viewed a change with </p>
<p>enthusiasm not dismay.</p>
<p>“In my Chicago speech of 1999, I had enunciated the new doctrine of a </p>
<p>‘responsibility to protect’, i.e. that a government could not be free grossly to oppress </p>
<p>and brutalise its citizens. I had put that into effect in Kosovo and Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>“… because war should be the last not the first resort, I had come to a firm </p>
<p>conclusion that we could only do it on the basis of non-compliance with UN </p>
<p>resolutions. Tyrant though he was, Saddam could not be removed on the basis </p>
<p>of tyranny alone.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… I was clear about two things. </p>
<p>“The first was that Saddam had to be made to conform to the UN resolutions … </p>
<p>“The second was that Britain had to remain … ‘shoulder to shoulder’ with America. </p>
<p>This is not as crude or unthinking a policy as it sounds. It didn’t mean we sacrificed </p>
<p>our interest to theirs; or subcontracted out our foreign policy. It meant that the </p>
<p>alliance between our two nations was a vital strategic interest and, as far as I was </p>
<p>concerned, a vital strategic asset for Britain.</p>
<p>“It implied we saw attacks on the US as attacks on us … It argued for an attitude </p>
<p>that did see us genuinely as at war together, with a common interest in a successful </p>
<p>outcome … our job as an ally … should be to be with them in their hour of need. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>522</p>
<p>I know all this can be made to sound corny or even … self-deceiving in terms of our </p>
<p>effect on US decision-making. I was well aware that ultimately the US would take its </p>
<p>own decisions in its own interests. But I was also aware that … Britain and Europe </p>
<p>were going to face a much more uncertain future without America … our alliance </p>
<p>with the US mattered …</p>
<p>“So when they had need of us, were we really going to refuse; or, even worse, </p>
<p>hope they succeeded but could do it without us? I reflected and felt the weight of an </p>
<p>alliance and its history, not oppressively but insistently, a call to duty, a call to act, a </p>
<p>call to be at their side, not distant from it, when they felt imperilled.” </p>
<p>296</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>731. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“We needed to get alongside that [US] planning and be part of it. Of course, as ever, </p>
<p>that presented a dilemma: If you wanted to be part of the planning, you had to be, at </p>
<p>least in principle, open to being part of the action early on, because I could see … </p>
<p>this might have to end with Saddam’s forcible removal, I resolved to be part of the </p>
<p>planning. From around April, we were then fairly closely involved even in the early </p>
<p>stages of US thinking.</p>
<p>“None of this meant that war was certain. It wasn’t and indeed a constant part of </p>
<p>the interaction between George and myself through those months, probably up to </p>
<p>around November, was acute anxiety that since we were planning for the possible, </p>
<p>that meant in the media mind that it was inevitable. We had the basic concepts </p>
<p>ironed out: Saddam had to comply with the UN resolutions and let the inspectors </p>
<p>back in: he couldn’t, on this occasion, be allowed to mess about – his compliance </p>
<p>had to be total; and if he refused we were going to be in a position where we were </p>
<p>capable of removing him. So the diplomacy and the planning proceeded along </p>
<p>separate but plainly at certain points connected tracks.</p>
<p>“It made domestic politics, however, highly uncomfortable. Naturally people </p>
<p>were reading the reports, assuming everything was decided and taking positions </p>
<p>accordingly. If we said that war was not agreed, they asked if we were planning; </p>
<p>if we accepted we were doing some form of planning, that meant war was indeed </p>
<p>agreed. The notion of a contingency was too subtle. And, to be fair, many of the </p>
<p>noises emanating from parts of the US system did suggest that there was only one </p>
<p>direction in which policy should go.” </p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>732. </b> In his account of the discussions with President Bush, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Behind closed doors … our talk was more nuanced. We shared the analysis </p>
<p>about the nature of the Saddam government, its risk to security and also the </p>
<p>wider problems of the region. My concern then and subsequently was to locate </p>

<p>523</p>
<p>the question of Saddam in the broader context of the Middle East as a region in </p>
<p>transition. Even then, though less clearly than today, I saw the disparate issues </p>
<p>as essentially part of the same picture. Therefore I made a major part of my pitch </p>
<p>to George the issue of the Israeli-Palestine peace process. To me this was the </p>
<p>indispensable soft-power component to give equilibrium to the hard power that was </p>
<p>necessary if Saddam was to be removed.”</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>733. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair if there was “an explicit, recorded statement of what the </p>
<p>UK’s objectives were in April 2002”, and how they had been agreed.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> It also asked: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what the UK objectives were in September 2002 and what process had been </p>
<p>used to revise those objectives between April and September; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how the US had interpreted comments in his meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld </p>
<p>on 5 June and in his Note to President Bush on 28 July; and whether he had any </p>
<p>concerns that that “pre-empted collective discussion” with Cabinet colleagues.</p>
<p><b>734. </b> In his statement Mr Blair chose to address those points together, writing:</p>
<p>“Though the meeting at Crawford provides a convenient breakpoint for the purposes </p>
<p>of the narrative, I want to stress it did not result in an alteration of policy. The policy </p>
<p>had been clear since 9/11: we wanted to take a tougher line altogether on terrorism </p>
<p>and WMD globally, and sought to bring Saddam into compliance with UN authority </p>
<p>… [T]he Crawford meeting was … a chance to explain how best to implement it … </p>
<p>Prior to the visit I had studied the Cabinet Office Options Paper, together with recent </p>
<p>JIC reports. I had also had the Chequers meeting with CDS and read-outs of the </p>
<p>military interaction with Washington.</p>
<p>“The objectives of our policy were not secret. They were set out in numerous </p>
<p>statements by myself and other Ministers …</p>
<p>“The objective never changed between April and September 2002. It remained … </p>
<p>to bring Saddam back to full and unconditional compliance with UN resolutions in </p>
<p>respect of which he had been in breach for over a decade. It was absolutely clear </p>
<p>that we were going to be with the US in implementing this objective. There can be </p>
<p>no-one who was in any doubt about my determination on that score. I expressed it </p>
<p>publicly. I made it clear also to President Bush I would be with him in tackling it … </p>
<p>I could not and did not offer some kind of ‘blank cheque’ in how we accomplished </p>
<p>our shared objective … I would never engage in any military campaign our military </p>
<p>thought unwise or unachievable. What I was signalling was there would be no </p>
<p>withdrawal of support for something we thought right and do-able, simply for reasons </p>
<p>of political pressure, i.e. I was going to be steadfast as an ally … I sent this signal </p>
<p>both because I believed in the substance and because we would be right alongside </p>
<p>the US thinking from the outset.</p>

<p>300</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>735. </b> In his statement, Mr Blair wrote that there had been “a full Cabinet discussion” after </p>
<p>the visit on 11 April “where we set out our objectives”, and that:</p>
<p>“The issues were regularly debated in Cabinet. I was answering questions on it, </p>
<p>giving press interviews. It was a dominant news issue. I was constantly interacting </p>
<p>on it, therefore, with colleagues, MPs and the media, and in the most plain terms.”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Asked if the meeting with President Bush at Crawford had been a turning point, </p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a turning point. It was really that all the way through we were saying this </p>

<p><b>Conclusions </b></p>
<p><b>737.  As a means to sustain international support for a policy of containment and </b></p>
<p><b>improve its effectiveness, the UK continued to pursue agreement to measures for </b></p>
<p><b>implementation of the smarter economic sanctions regime, agreed in November </b></p>
<p><b>2001, in the first months of 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>738.  But continuing divisions between Permanent Members of the Security </b></p>

<p><b>of weapons inspectors and establishing the verification and monitoring regime </b></p>
<p><b>identified in resolution 1284 (1999). Without inspections, there was no route for </b></p>

<p><b>743.  The focus on Iraq was not the result of a step change in Iraq’s capabilities </b></p>
<p><b>or intentions.</b></p>
<p><b>744.  Although the possibility of future military action provided the context for </b></p>
<p><b>the discussion at Cabinet on 7 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw emphasised that </b></p>
<p><b>no decisions had been taken and Cabinet was not being asked to take decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>745.  The discussion was couched in terms of Iraq’s need to comply with its </b></p>
<p><b>obligations and future choices by the international community on how to respond </b></p>
<p><b>to the threat which Iraq represented.</b></p>
<p><b>746.  Cabinet endorsed the conclusion that Iraq’s WMD programmes posed a </b></p>
<p><b>threat to peace and a strategy of engaging closely with the US Government in </b></p>
<p><b>order to shape policy and its presentation. But it did not discuss how that might </b></p>
<p><b>be achieved.</b></p>
<p><b>747.  Mr Blair sought and was given information on a range of issues before his </b></p>
<p><b>meeting with President Bush. But no formal and agreed analysis of the issues and </b></p>
<p><b>options was sought or produced; and there was no collective consideration of </b></p>
<p><b>such advice. </b></p>
<p><b>748.  The advice offered to Mr Blair by Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Mr Powell assumed </b></p>
<p><b>that the US objective would be regime change and that the UK would be likely to </b></p>
<p><b>support US-led military action in some circumstances if that could be shown to be </b></p>
<p><b>necessary to eliminate Iraq’s WMD. </b></p>
<p><b>749.  At Crawford, Mr Blair offered President Bush a partnership in dealing </b></p>
<p><b>urgently with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein. He proposed a strategy based </b></p>
<p><b>on an ultimatum calling on Iraq to permit the return of weapons inspectors or face </b></p>
<p><b>the consequences. </b></p>
<p><b>750.  Mr Blair’s approach reflected the thinking in Mr Straw’s advice of 25 March. </b></p>
<p><b>Proposing that the US and UK should seek an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to </b></p>
<p><b>readmit weapons inspectors provided a route for the UK to align itself with the US </b></p>
<p><b>without adopting the US objective of regime change.</b></p>
<p><b>751.  President Bush agreed to consider the idea but there was no decision until </b></p>
<p><b>September 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>752.  It was subsequently reported that, in his discussions with President Bush, </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair set out a number of considerations in relation to the development of </b></p>
<p><b>policy on Iraq, which were subsequently described by others as “conditions” </b></p>
<p><b>for action (see Section 3.3). </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>526</p>
<p><b>753.  Following his meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair stated that Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein had to be confronted and brought back into compliance with the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>754.  The statements made in public by Mr Blair clearly implied the use of force </b></p>
<p><b>in the event that Saddam Hussein failed to comply with an ultimatum.</b></p>
<p><b>755.  The acceptance of the possibility that the UK might participate in a military </b></p>
<p><b>invasion of Iraq was a profound change in UK thinking. Although no decisions had </b></p>
<p><b>been taken, that became the basis for contingency planning in the months ahead.</b></p>
