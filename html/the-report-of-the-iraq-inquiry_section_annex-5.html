<p><b>Structure of the Report</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> The Executive Summary contains the Inquiry’s key findings and conclusions.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The 17 Sections of the Report contain accounts of the relevant decisions and events, </p>
<p>the Inquiry’s full analysis and conclusions, and, where appropriate, lessons for the </p>
<p>future.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Sections address separate themes arising from the sequence of events between </p>
<p>2001 and 2009. In each Section the Inquiry draws on the available evidence to provide </p>
<p>an account of events, policy discussions and decision-making processes.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The Inquiry does not present all its conclusions in the same way. Different topics </p>
<p>benefited from different approaches. In the Sections covering the period before the </p>
<p>invasion, conclusions are placed alongside the main evidence in a single Section. In </p>
<p>the majority of post-invasion material, the conclusions appear in separate analytical </p>
<p>Sections.</p>
<p><b>Use of bold text</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> Bold text is used in the pre-invasion Sections of the Report to highlight Inquiry </p>
<p>comment and analysis, and to signpost or summarise key events. Bold text is not used </p>
<p>in post-invasion Sections. Throughout the Report, bold text is retained in quotes as it </p>
<p>appeared in the original.</p>
<p><b>Cross-referencing</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> Cross-references to other Sections are used where an issue or event referred to in </p>
<p>one Section is addressed in more detail elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>Duplication of text</b></p>
<p><b>7. </b> Identical, or very similar, material can appear in two or more Sections where that aids </p>
<p>comprehension or is necessary for an accurate description of events.</p>
<p><b>Use of evidence</b></p>
<p><b>8. </b> The Report draws on material from a wide range of sources, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK Government documents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>transcripts of the Inquiry’s public and private hearings;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>written submissions to the Inquiry;</p>

<p><b>HOW TO READ AND NAVIGATE THE REPORT</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Parliamentary records;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>documents published by the US Government and international organisations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>published memoirs and diaries;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>academic papers, including papers produced to inform the two seminars </p>
<p>organised by the Inquiry;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>meetings in the UK with Service Personnel and their families, and with UK </p>
<p>civilians who worked in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>views heard during visits to Iraq, the US and France by members of the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The Inquiry presents that material in the form of gists, which summarise the key </p>
<p>points of a document or part of a document, and quotes. The source of each gist and </p>
<p>quote is given in a footnote.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The Report quotes extensively from the full range of sources. To aid comprehension </p>
<p>the Inquiry has sought to standardise spellings, abbreviations and acronyms and the </p>
<p>representation of numbers, dates and times within quotes. All bold and italic text and </p>
<p>underlining appearing within a quote has been retained from the original.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Where the meaning of a quote is uncertain or ambiguous, explanatory material has </p>
<p>been added in square brackets.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> US spellings are used for all US job titles and for US and international organisations </p>
<p>using US spellings in their names, and are retained in all quotes from US sources.</p>
<p><b>Documents published by the Inquiry</b></p>
<p><b>13. </b> Whole documents and extracts declassified by the Government, transcripts of the </p>
<p>Inquiry’s hearings and written submissions to the Inquiry are published on the Inquiry </p>
<p>website, with redactions where necessary.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Where the Government has declassified a gist or quote from a document, but not </p>
<p>the whole document or an extract from it, there is no further material available to the </p>
<p>reader beyond the gist or quote in the Report.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> In the online version of the Report, hyperlinks in the footnotes take the reader to </p>
<p>documents published on the Inquiry website.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The footnotes in the printed version of the Report do not distinguish between those </p>
<p>documents which have been published on the Inquiry website and those which have not.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The Report does not include links to other published sources.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> The legibility of a small number of government documents published on the Inquiry </p>
<p>website is poor. In each case, the Inquiry has published the clearest copy available.</p>

<p>327</p>
<p><b>Redacted evidence</b></p>
<p><b>19. </b> The Government has required redactions to certain documents under the terms </p>
<p>of the <i>Protocol between the Iraq Inquiry and Her Majesty’s Government regarding </i></p>
<p><i>Documents and Other Written and Electronic Information. </i>Those redactions appear </p>
<p>in three forms:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as thick black lines in the transcripts of oral evidence given in private;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as blank white space in whole documents published by the Inquiry; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as an ellipsis (three dots) within quotations in the text.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Certain categories of information have been withheld from publication under the </p>
<p>terms of the Protocols agreed between the Inquiry and the Government:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>views expressed by President Bush in conversations with Mr Blair;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reference numbers of JIC Assessments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the names of SIS officers (other than C), who are identified in the Report as </p>
<p>SIS1 to SIS10;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>certain material on the activities of UK Special Forces and the names of </p>
<p>successive Directors of Special Forces, who are identified in the Report as </p>
<p>DSF1 to DSF3; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a small number of other identities and capabilities that require protection and are </p>
<p>identified in the text by ciphers.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The Inquiry has received some evidence which it has agreed to publish </p>
<p>anonymously in accordance with the criteria in paragraphs 4a and 4b of the <i>Protocol for </i></p>
<p><i>hearing evidence by the Iraq Inquiry in public, and for identifying witnesses</i>.</p>
<p><b>Unusual document types</b></p>
<p><b>22. </b> The Inquiry has published and makes reference to a wide range of written material. </p>
<p>Less familiar categories of official document include:</p>
<p><b>FCO telegrams</b></p>
<p><b>23. </b> Telegrams were electronically transmitted reports sent between the FCO in London </p>
<p>and British Embassies, Missions and Consulates overseas. Very occasionally they were </p>
<p>transmitted to or from other government departments and between overseas posts.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> All telegrams from the FCO in London were attributed to the Foreign Secretary. </p>
<p>The most important were seen by the Foreign Secretary in draft. All telegrams from </p>
<p>posts were signed, and almost always seen in draft by, the Head or acting Head of Post.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> All telegrams formed part of the FCO official record.</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Not all ellipses represent a redaction. Some represent text omitted by the Inquiry for reasons of </p>
<p>relevance. All ellipses in square brackets represent redacted text. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Telegrams to and from individual posts were numbered sequentially through the </p>
<p>calendar year, starting with “TELNO 1” on 1 January.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> All telegrams included a date time group using Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). </p>
<p>A telegram from the British Embassy Washington sent on “170356Z JULY 03” refers to </p>
<p>a telegram sent at 3.56am GMT on 17 July 2003 (11.56pm on 16 July in Washington; </p>
<p>4.56am on 17 July in London).</p>
<p><b>28. </b> A precedence marking signified the urgency of the telegram. “FLASH” indicated </p>
<p>a telegram to be seen immediately by the recipient. A telegram marked “DESKBY </p>
<p>170600Z” was to be available to the recipient at 6.00am GMT. The other designations </p>
<p>were “IMMEDIATE”, “PRIORITY” and “ROUTINE”.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The FCO phased out telegrams during 2005. They were replaced by eGrams.</p>
<p><b>FCO eGrams</b></p>
<p><b>30. </b> The eGram, which replaced FCO telegrams during 2005, was used for significant </p>
<p>communications and formed part of the FCO official record. It offered much of the </p>
<p>flexibility of an email, including the ability to add attachments.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Unlike telegrams, each eGram was assigned a unique number in a single FCO-wide </p>
<p>sequence starting at midnight GMT on 31 December. Paris eGram 127/06 to the FCO </p>
<p>was not the 127th eGram from Paris, but the 127th eGram sent on the system in 2006.</p>
<p><b>FCO teleletters</b></p>
<p><b>32. </b> Letters between named individuals sent electronically using the FCO telegram </p>
<p>system. Phased out in 2005.</p>
<p><b>Valedictories</b></p>
<p><b>33. </b> Reports from officials at the end of a tour of duty as the head of an overseas post.</p>
<p><b>Hauldown reports</b></p>
<p><b>34. </b> Valedictories sent by UK military commanders at the end of a tour of duty in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Private Secretary letters</b></p>
<p><b>35. </b> Routine formal communication between government departments is often </p>
<p>conducted by means of a letter from one Ministerial Private Secretary to another. Such </p>
<p>letters should be interpreted as reflecting the views of the Minister, not of the signatory. </p>
<p>The importance of an issue can often be inferred from the seniority of the Private </p>
<p>Secretary. For instance, a letter from one Principal Private Secretary to another would </p>
<p>usually hold more weight than a letter from one junior Minister’s Private Secretary </p>
<p>to another.</p>

<p>329</p>
<p><b>Names and ranks</b></p>
<p><b>36. </b> All names, honours, military ranks and job titles in the Report reflect the individual’s </p>
<p>position at the time of the event in question.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Where the Report quotes written or oral evidence from a witness to the Inquiry, the </p>
<p>witness is identified according to their status at the time they gave evidence.</p>
