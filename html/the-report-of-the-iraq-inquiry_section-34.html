<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the development of UK policy on Iraq and the UK’s </p>
<p>discussions with the US between the end of July and President Bush’s speech to the </p>
<p>UN General Assembly on 12 September 2002, in which he challenged the UN to act </p>
<p>to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security Council since </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Iraq in August 1990. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessment of Iraq’s chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons and potential scenarios for their use, of 9 September 2002, is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 4.2. That Section also addresses the FCO briefing on Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction (WMD) and the production of the Iraq dossier, which was published on </p>
<p>24 September 2002 and debated in both Houses of Parliament.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The development of options for a possible UK contribution to a US&#8209;led military </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq is addressed in Section 6.1. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> By late July 2002, the arrangements for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq had been </p>
<p>identified as a crucial element for success in the event of regime change in Iraq, </p>
<p>however that occurred. UK planning for that is addressed in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In discussions with the US over the summer of 2002, Mr Blair and Mr Straw sought </p>
<p>to persuade the US Administration to secure multilateral support before taking </p>
<p>action on Iraq; and to do so through the UN. They proposed a strategy in which the </p>
<p>first objective was to offer Iraq the opportunity and “last chance” to comply with its </p>
<p>obligations to disarm. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq did not take that opportunity and military action was required, the UK was </p>
<p>seeking to establish conditions whereby such action would command multilateral </p>
<p>support and be taken with the authority of the Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair also decided to publish an explanation of why action was needed to deal with </p>
<p>Iraq; and to recall Parliament to debate the issue. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK made a significant contribution to President Bush’s decision, announced on </p>
<p>12 September, to take the issue of Iraq back to the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Statements made by China, France and Russia after President Bush’s speech </p>
<p>highlighted the different positions of the five Permanent Members of the Security </p>
<p>Council, in particular about the role of the Council in deciding whether military action </p>
<p>was justified. As a result, the negotiation of resolution 1441 was complex and difficult. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>Advice for Mr Blair following his meeting of 23 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>MOD advice on the military options, 26 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>5.  In response to the request following the meeting on 23 July for full details of </b></p>
<p><b>the proposed military campaign and possible UK contributions, the MOD advised </b></p>
<p><b>No.10 on 26 July:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>US military planning was still evolving and the Chiefs of Staff were not yet </b></p>
<p><b>able to judge whether the US had a winning concept.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Three possible options for a UK contribution were identified but no </b></p>
<p><b>recommendation was made about which option should be selected. </b></p>
<p><b>The advice was sent to Mr Blair on 31 July, as one of several background papers </b></p>
<p><b>he had commissioned at his meeting on 23 July for summer reading. </b></p>
<p><b>6.  Mr Blair was advised that no decision was needed at that stage. </b></p>
<p><b>7.  The three options identified by the MOD remained the broad framework for </b></p>
<p><b>discussions until the end of 2002.</b> </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The record of Mr Blair’s meeting on 23 July stated that the UK should work on the </p>
<p>assumption that it would take part in any military action against Iraq and that Admiral </p>
<p>Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), could tell the US that the UK was </p>
<p>considering a range of options.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Adm Boyce was asked to send Mr Blair full details of the proposed military campaign, </p>
<p>and options for a UK contribution, by 30 July or earlier if they were available.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The MOD advice on options for a UK contribution to US&#8209;led military operations </p>
<p>in Iraq was provided in a letter to Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs, on 26 July.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> The MOD advised that US military planning was “in full swing but it was still </p>
<p>evolving”. The concept was for an attack launched by forces deployed in Kuwait and </p>
<p>from other Gulf States and from ships in the Gulf and elsewhere. The plan was “neither </p>
<p>fully developed nor finalised”. The Chiefs of Staff were “not yet able to judge whether </p>
<p>this is a winning concept”. Greater clarity would be needed “before any UK option could </p>
<p>be recommended”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The MOD stated that it was “clear that the US plan of attack from the South” did not </p>
<p>“need British land forces”:</p>
<p>“… in the time available there is very little scope for the preparation and integration </p>
<p>of British land forces into the US order of battle; moreover the logistic space </p>
<p>available in Kuwait, with five divisions worth of equipment and logistics support </p>
<p>entering through only one airhead and a single port would already be confined …”</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Adm Boyce recommended three options:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 1: </b>an “in&#8209;place support package” using forces already in the region </p>
<p>and US use of UK bases. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 2:</b> an “enhanced support package” comprising Package 1 and </p>
<p>additional air and maritime forces. That package could include forces that would </p>
<p>be “of particular interest to the US because of their own deficiencies, e.g. mine </p>
<p>clearance vessels and air&#8209;to&#8209;air refuellers for their carrier&#8209;based aircraft”. While </p>
<p>no conventional land forces could meet the timescales for the deployment of </p>
<p>maritime and air forces: “Special Forces could be deployed very rapidly to match </p>
<p>US timescales and priorities. This is likely to be very attractive to US planners, </p>
<p>and their contribution to success would be significant.”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 3:</b> a “discrete UK package” based on deployment of an armoured </p>
<p>division which the MOD envisaged would be used in northern Iraq, in addition to </p>
<p>the forces in Packages 1 and 2. The MOD stated that a force that was “credible” </p>
<p>would be required: “Even to create uncertainty in the mind of Saddam”, and the </p>
<p>contribution of a division “would probably require command and control at Corps </p>
<p>level. The UK might consider providing an armoured division either as part of a </p>
<p>US&#8209;led Corps or as part of a larger coalition force possibly led by the UK using </p>
<p>the framework of the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps [ARRC].”</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The MOD highlighted problems with:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the concept of a “Running Start”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the fragility of the logistic chains; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>vulnerability to chemical or biological weapons. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The MOD stated that “thinking about dealing with the aftermath of a successful </p>
<p>attack remains sketchy”. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Finally, the MOD drew attention to the funding which would be required once a </p>
<p>decision in principle was made to participate in military activity.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, attached “two large caveats” to all </p>
<p>three options. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>First, the timescales were “best planning estimates” and made “sweeping </p>
<p>assumptions” about basing, transit routes, and overflights. They also assumed </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>that funding would be available to improve sustainability and implement Urgent </p>
<p>Operational Requirements (UORs). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secondly, if the Armed Forces were required to provide 18,000&#8209;20,000 people </p>
<p>for an emergency fire service in the event of a nationwide firefighters’ strike </p>
<p>(Operation FRESCO), and the US started military action in winter 2002/3, </p>
<p>only the in&#8209;place support package and Special Forces would be available. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Hoon had commissioned further work with a view to expediting what would </p>
<p>need to be done once a decision in principle had been taken. UK representatives at </p>
<p>a US Central Command (CENTCOM) planning meeting the following week would be </p>
<p>instructed “to set our options positively but without committing us to any specific ones”. </p>
<p>The MOD would write again as soon as there was “greater clarity about the US plan, </p>
<p>such that the Chiefs can update their assessment of it (and the risks involved) and the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary can make recommendations about the best option to pursue”.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>19. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to the Private Offices of Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary, and the Cabinet Secretary, and to Mr John Scarlett, Chairman of the JIC. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The MOD advice and subsequent developments in its contingency planning during </p>
<p>August are addressed in Section 6.1.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Rycroft submitted the letter to Mr Blair on 31 July, as one of several “background </p>
<p>papers you commissioned at the Iraq meeting last week” for “summer reading”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“The military are not yet ready to make a recommendation on which if any of the </p>
<p>three options to go for. They are continuing to work with the US military. Nor can </p>
<p>they yet judge whether the US have a winning concept. You do not need to take </p>
<p>decisions yet.” </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that Mr Blair had said:</p>
<p>“… he didn’t want to take any decision or accept any of these options. I think in </p>
<p>retrospect … this was because … this was the time … when we were pressing for </p>
<p>the Americans to consider the UN route. I think he didn’t want to give any signal that </p>
<p>he was keen to think about a military alternative …”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The other background papers sent to Mr Blair included advice from the FCO on </p>
<p>the attitudes of allies, the history of weapons inspection, and from Mr Scarlett on the </p>
<p>cohesion of the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> Those are addressed later in this Section. </p>

<p><b>25. </b> A manuscript note records that the papers were seen by Mr Blair.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>The attitudes of allies</b></p>
<p><b>26.  The FCO advised that achieving an EU consensus on Iraq would be difficult. </b></p>
<p><b>27.  Sir John Holmes advised that it would be difficult to persuade France to </b></p>
<p><b>support military action but “not totally impossible”. </b></p>
<p><b>28.  There was a striking congruence between the conditions Mr Blair had raised </b></p>
<p><b>in his discussions with President Bush and the conditions identified by France </b></p>
<p><b>and other allies to help secure support – UN legitimacy; public presentation of </b></p>
<p><b>credible evidence on WMD; consultation, including on “day after” questions; and </b></p>
<p><b>a visible attempt to revive the MEPP. </b></p>
<p><b>29. </b> Following the meeting on 23 July, Mr Straw was asked to provide advice on the </p>
<p>positions of countries in the region and the background on UN inspections.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The FCO provided advice on the attitudes of EU partners to military action against </p>
<p>on 30 July.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> It stated that the JIC would be producing an Assessment of the attitudes of </p>
<p>regional governments.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> In relation to EU partners, a short paper was provided based on the advice of </p>
<p>FCO posts. The UK had deliberately tried to keep Iraq off the EU agenda because </p>
<p>“debate would be futile and would merely expose differences”. That restraint was </p>
<p>“increasingly hard to sustain” because of speculation about military action. Achieving an </p>
<p>EU consensus on military action would be “difficult”, but a number of factors might help. </p>
<p>These included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“achieving some sort of UN legitimacy, preferably … a new resolution; a </p>
<p>real effort to get the inspectors in and public presentation of credible WMD </p>
<p>evidence”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“genuine consultation” by the US “before … action starts”. That would “need to </p>
<p>cover the day&#8209;after questions”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a visible effort by the US to revive the MEPP”.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> As part of the preparation of that advice, Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador </p>
<p>to France, addressed the attitude of the new French Government led by </p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> In a telegram about France&#8209;US relations on 24 July, Sir John advised that the </p>
<p>French Government wanted a better dialogue with the US and that “for EU and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>transatlantic reasons we have a strong interest in encouraging the French down this </p>
<p>road”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> France was worried that the US wished to “free itself of external constraints </p>
<p>and its readiness to consider short&#8209;term and military solutions do not add up to a </p>
<p>coherent and sustainable approach to international problems”. It particularly feared </p>
<p>“the consequences of an attack on Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Subsequently on 26 July, Sir John advised that France would be “difficult to bring </p>
<p>on board for action against Iraq” for the reasons he had set out in his telegram of </p>
<p>19 February (see Section 3.2).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> But “despite opposition in the French media and public”, </p>
<p>there was:</p>
<p>“… a better chance with [President] Chirac and his new team in place – particularly </p>
<p>if certain conditions can be met (credible plan; answers to the day after questions; </p>
<p>prospect of international support and legal cover; consultation with France in </p>
<p>advance). Neutrality in the event of action is certainly possible. Participation </p>
<p>unlikely but not totally impossible – the French want to have a say in what </p>
<p>happens afterwards.” </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Sir John added that the new French Government would be “more inclined to keep </p>
<p>their doubts private and to engage with the Americans”. The UK needed to “encourage” </p>
<p>and “to talk to the French ourselves”.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The key elements of Sir John’s analysis were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new French Government had said nothing in public, in the lead up to </p>
<p>the election and subsequently, about possible US military action against </p>
<p>Iraq. They had “stuck rigidly to the need for Iraq to accept the unconditional </p>
<p>return of inspectors”. That was “partly driven” by their desire “to avoid public </p>
<p>disagreement with the US” but also reflected “their belief that the UN track </p>
<p>represents the best hope of averting a military solution, and that P5 [the five </p>
<p>Permanent Members of the Security Council] consensus is essential to getting </p>
<p>the inspectors back in”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Privately” the Quai d’Orsay (the French Foreign Ministry) accepted that the </p>
<p>chances of avoiding military action were “more or less gone”, and it was “deeply </p>
<p>concerned about the implications of an attack on Iraq”, which one senior official </p>
<p>had described as “highly unwise”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Chirac had more freedom of movement after the election “should he </p>
<p>choose to use it”; but he would have his “work seriously cut out in shifting press </p>
<p>and public opinion in favour of military action” if that was what he wanted to do.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France was not encouraged by the absence of progress since February.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN backing was “particularly important … not just because of the Quai’s </p>
<p>approach to international law, but because they also see it as critical to winning </p>

<p>the support of enough of the Arab world. The French would be prepared to go </p>
<p>a long way to secure UN support for a military operation, which they believe </p>
<p>might just be obtainable if (a very big if) the Americans want it enough … </p>
<p>[O]n past precedent, formal UN authorisation is not an absolute requirement … </p>
<p>But what would be indispensable would be a Security Council statement (not </p>
<p>necessarily in the form of a SCR [Security Council resolution]) that Iraq was in </p>
<p>breach of its obligations and a warning making clear to Iraq the consequences of </p>
<p>continued violation.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new Government had been “careful not to rule out the possibility of French </p>
<p>participation in an operation with UN backing … They know that … French </p>
<p>interests in the region will be tied to the success or failure of US action. The </p>
<p>French will certainly not want to be excluded from what happens afterwards. </p>
<p>This will increase the pressure on them to acquiesce in any action …” </p>
<p><b>37. </b> Sir John’s view was that France shared the UK’s desire to avoid “a great </p>
<p>European split”. He advocated engagement “seriously and early … at every level, </p>
<p>including Chirac”. That:</p>
<p>“… should not just be, or seem to be, as a catspaw for the Americans, when our </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>the activities of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the International </p>
<p>Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Iraq before their withdrawal in December 1998, stating:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The history of UN weapons inspections in Iraq has been characterised by </p>
<p>persistent Iraqi efforts to frustrate, deceive and intimidate inspectors.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite that, UNSCOM and the IAEA had “a valuable record of achievement in </p>
<p>discovering and destroying biological and chemical weapons stocks, missiles </p>
<p>and the infrastructure for Iraq’s nuclear weapons programme”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By the end of 1998, “significant uncertainties about the disposition of Iraq’s </p>
<p>prohibited programmes” remained when “A series of confrontations and the </p>
<p>systematic refusal of Iraq to co&#8209;operate, left UNSCOM unable to perform its </p>
<p>disarmament mandate and the inspectors withdrew on 13 December 1998.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since December 1998, Iraq had “refused absolutely to comply with its UN </p>
<p>disarmament and monitoring obligations and allow access to weapons </p>
<p>inspectors”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK judged that Iraq had “used the intervening 40&#8209;month period to rebuild </p>
<p>significant aspects of its chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those actions “not only” presented “a direct challenge to the authority of </p>
<p>the United Nations”, they also breached “Iraq’s commitments under two key </p>
<p>international arms control agreements”, the Biological and Toxin Weapons </p>
<p>Convention</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> and the Nuclear Non&#8209;Proliferation Treaty.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>42. </b> The document described the UN’s inspections mandate in Iraq, recorded “some </p>
<p>instances of Iraqi obstruction” and focused on “one of the most egregious examples on </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance”, its denial of a biological weapons programme.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> The document concluded with a “summary of developments” since December 1998 </p>
<p>and the steps Iraq needed to take “if the international community was ever to have any </p>
<p>assurance that Saddam Hussein’s ambitions to develop … WMD have finally been </p>
<p>thwarted”. That summary referred to the report to the Security Council by the UNSCOM </p>
<p>Chairman in 1999 as a “damning account of Iraqi deceit”; and to the establishment of a </p>
<p>UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC). It described “full </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation with UN inspectors, including unconditional, immediate and unrestricted </p>
<p>access to any and all sites” as a “key measure” of Iraqi compliance. It ended with a </p>
<p>statement that:</p>
<p>“In the interests of regional and global security, the international community cannot </p>
<p>allow this stand off to continue indefinitely.”</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Resolution 1284, adopted by the UN Security Council in December 1999 after </p>
<p>considerable debate and disagreement, is addressed in Section 1.1. </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>“which bans the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition or retention of biological weapons”. </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>“which prohibits Iraq from manufacturing or otherwise acquiring nuclear weapons”.</p>

<p><b>Iraqi regime cohesion</b></p>
<p><b>45.  Mr Scarlett advised on 31 July that Iraq considered a US attack to be likely.</b></p>
<p><b>46.  There was no intelligence of serious rifts within the regime and the perception </b></p>
<p><b>that senior members would be targeted by the US gave them no incentive to work </b></p>
<p><b>directly against Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>47.  Some key members of Saddam Hussein’s regime were reported to favour </b></p>
<p><b>allowing inspectors to return.</b></p>
<p><b>48.  Popular uprisings would only be possible if there was a credible coalition </b></p>
<p><b>attack “with the clear intention of finishing off the regime”.</b></p>
<p><b>49. </b> On 31 July, Mr Scarlett provided a note “examining the weaknesses and sources of </p>
<p>friction within the regime”, in response to a request from Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), </p>
<p>for more work on the cohesion of the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> As well as internal regime tensions, </p>
<p>which had been examined in the JIC Assessment of 4 July, ‘Iraq: Regime Cohesion’, </p>
<p>and discussed in Mr Blair’s meeting of 23 July (see Section 3.3), Mr Scarlett addressed </p>
<p>military preparations and the attitudes of the Iraqi populace. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that the Iraqi regime considered a US attack to be “likely”; and it </p>
<p>saw the “greatest threat in the short term as coming from an ‘Afghanistan’ scenario of air </p>
<p>strikes and Special Forces supporting an internal uprising”. But Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“beginning to realise that a much larger US military operation” was “now possible”. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> The UK had no “intelligence suggesting any serious rifts within the senior members </p>
<p>of the regime”. There were differences within the Iraqi regime over permitting the return </p>
<p>of UN inspectors. Mr Tariq Aziz, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr al&#8209;Hadithi, the Foreign </p>
<p>Minister, Mr Izzat Ibrahim al&#8209;Duri, the Vice Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, </p>
<p>and Mr Uday Hussein, Saddam Hussein’s son, were “reportedly … more in favour”. </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett judged that policy differences were “unlikely to be a serious concern” for </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein: he totally dominated the regime and “despite any damage to his </p>
<p>prestige from allowing the return of inspectors” there was “little risk to him personally </p>
<p>from making sharp changes in policy”. He had “done so in the past” and his deputies </p>
<p>disagreed “at their peril”. It was “likely that senior members of the regime” judged </p>
<p>that “the US threat to topple the regime” would “include them”. There was “little or no </p>
<p>incentive for them to work directly against Saddam”. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Conditions inside Iraq were better than they were “immediately before the start </p>
<p>of the Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food (OFF) programme in late 1996”; but the “greatest losers under </p>
<p>sanctions” had been the middle classes. There was “no reliable information on public </p>
<p>opinion inside Iraq”, but a belief that the Iraqi population was “cowed by Saddam’s </p>
<p>security apparatus”.</p>

<p>Minute Scarlett to Manning, 31 July 2002, ‘The Iraqi Regime: Risks and Threats’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>53. </b> The Kurds were “content with the status quo”. They had “a significant degree of </p>
<p>independence and, as the Kurds did not contribute to compensation payments from OFF </p>
<p>revenue to Kuwait, they had done “disproportionately well from OFF”. Their goal was </p>
<p>“significant <b>autonomy</b> in a federal Iraq”. They remained “wary of backing US military </p>
<p>action too openly”. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> The Iraqi regime was “relatively sanguine about the risk of opposition” in the </p>
<p>South, and deemed the “main threat” to be “from <b>SCIRI</b> [Supreme Council for Islamic </p>
<p>Revolution in Iraq] and its military wing, the <b>Badr Corps</b>”. The UK lacked “reliable </p>
<p>intelligence on the size and attitudes of particular tribes in southern Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded:</p>
<p>“… until the regime’s military and security forces have been significantly weakened </p>
<p>by external attack, neither SCIRI nor these tribal insurgents can present a significant </p>
<p>threat to regime control. Once the regime’s security and military apparatus begins </p>
<p>to crack, however, a more general uprising is quite possible, as in 1991. Only </p>
<p>a credible coalition attack with the clear intention of finishing off the regime will </p>
<p>overcome the local population’s natural sense of caution. After all, the precedent of </p>
<p>1991 showed that the regime was allowed brutally to re&#8209;establish its control without </p>
<p>significant interference from coalition forces.”</p>

<p><b>facing Ministers.</b></p>
<p><b>61.  The judgements in the Assessment reflected the conditions which had </b></p>
<p><b>already been identified in policy papers and discussions. </b></p>
<p><b>62.  The Assessment identified that the US must continue to convince regional </b></p>

<p><b>and offer credible plans for the aftermath. </b></p>
<p><b>63. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC reconsidered the judgements in its Assessment </p>

<p> It also assessed the </p>
<p>impact of military action on the internal stability of regional states. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> In its discussion of the draft Assessment on 31 July the JIC identified Iraq as:</p>

<p>options but needed to spell out more, the huge ambiguities and doubts in the region </p>
<p>about the timing of any US attack, as well as the likely aftermath … The success of </p>
<p>any US action would also depend partly on whether the objective was for the West </p>
<p>to have control over Iraq in the longer term … The overview … was rather negative </p>
<p>but in fact governments in the region would rather like to be rid of Saddam;</p>
<p>“the key issue facing Ministers now was gauging what Iraq’s neighbours would say </p>
<p>… the draft Assessment was a little too conventional on this point and did not really </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>65. </b> In its Key Judgements, which were very similar to those of 19 April, the </p>
<p>JIC concluded:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“No regional state, including Iran and Syria, would give Iraq significant practical </p>
<p>support against a US&#8209;led attack.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Turkey would be willing to provide basing for a US&#8209;led attack on Iraq. Provided </p>
<p>there were no worsening of the security situation in Palestine, Kuwait […] would </p>
<p>provide basing or staging support […].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saudi Arabia would be very unlikely to provide basing. It might approve some </p>
<p>over&#8209;flights, but possibly only for non&#8209;offensive operations. It would distance </p>
<p>itself from US&#8209;led military action, […].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Arab governments’ support would be badly damaged if Israel used a US&#8209;led </p>
<p>attack on Iraq […]. Their support might also be reduced if any military campaign </p>
<p>is prolonged or causes many civilian casualties.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A US&#8209;led attack on Iraq would spark large&#8209;scale protests across the Arab world. </p>
<p>Security forces would probably be able to maintain control, at least initially, […] </p>
<p>Anti&#8209;Western sentiment in the region would not dissipate quickly and could boost </p>
<p>popular sympathy for extremist causes, including Al Qaida.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>66. </b> In the Assessment itself, the JIC stated that Iraq had “no real allies” but regional </p>
<p>States were influenced by a long list of factors which made “winning any support [for </p>
<p>military action] an uphill struggle”. Those factors were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “deep Arab concern” that they were “being called on to support an </p>
<p>attack on a fellow Muslim country.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Events in Israel/Palestine remained “a primary focus” for Arab States: </p>
<p>“No Arab State is persuaded that Saddam should be dealt with before there </p>
<p>is a substantial movement towards resolution of the Palestinian problem.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For Arab States, “concerns about military action” owed “more to fears about </p>
<p>potential internal instability than to any affection for Saddam”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “uncertainty over US resolve”. Regional support might “firm up </p>
<p>when a credible plan” was “on the table” and preparations had begun: </p>
<p>“<b>A quick build up and a rapid and decisive victory</b>, with low civilian </p>
<p>casualties, would minimise popular discontent, especially if the Iraqi people </p>
<p>welcomed Saddam’s overthrow”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A UN Security Council resolution justifying force would make it easier for </p>
<p>regional governments to justify publicly their acquiescence to US military action. </p>
<p>Otherwise, regional States would want stronger evidence of Iraq’s continued </p>
<p>pursuit of WMD and that the return of weapons inspectors had been visibly </p>
<p>pursued and exhausted.”</p>
<p>21 </p>

<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Most regional governments would be happy to see Saddam’s demise. But </p>
<p>they would be likely to have profound misgivings about a campaign without a </p>
<p>well&#8209;constructed plan for a new Iraq. All agree that Iraq’s territorial integrity must </p>
<p>be maintained. But there are differing regional concerns about the place of the </p>
<p>Kurds and Shia in any new regime, the type of government and its relationship </p>
<p>with the West. Arab States want Iraq to remain a counter&#8209;balance to Iran.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “<b>economic</b> concerns about the effect of lost trade”.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> In addition, the Assessment included the following points: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “volatility in Israel/Palestine” continued to “dominate the Arab World’s </p>
<p>attention. The pro&#8209;Western Arab States may accept a military build up in the </p>
<p>region, even in the absence of more concrete progress on Palestine. But we </p>
<p>assess that in the run up to an Iraq campaign, <b>Arab governments’ support </b></p>
<p><b>could be withdrawn with any worsening of the Israel/Palestine security </b></p>
<p><b>situation</b>.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“As the originator of the Arab peace initiative, Crown Prince Abdullah [of Saudi </p>
<p>Arabia]” remained “focused on Palestine”. If there was “little progress there” or </p>
<p>the US was “perceived as resistant to Saudi pressure” that would be “damaging </p>
<p>to his domestic credibility”. Anti&#8209;US sentiment remained “strong” and the JIC </p>
<p>judged that “for the next few months at least”, there was “no prospect of Saudi </p>
<p>Arabia agreeing to provide basing for US military action … even if the prospects </p>
<p>for the return of inspectors” remained “slim”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iran feared “eventually being targeted by the US” and was “seriously alarmed </p>
<p>at the prospect of greater encirclement by the US if a pro&#8209;Western regime were </p>
<p>installed in Baghdad”. Once a US attack began, the JIC assessed that Iran </p>
<p>“would probably boost its support for Shia groups working against Saddam, with </p>
<p>the aim of increasing its own influence in Iraq”. The JIC judged that the Iranian </p>
<p>Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) “would be likely to work directly to </p>
<p>undermine US influence, e.g. by manipulating Iraqi groups through propaganda </p>
<p>and the selective provision of money and arms, although it would not undertake </p>
<p>anything that would provoke US military retaliation”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the build up to an attack … Saddam would seek to speak direct to the ‘Arab </p>
<p>street to incite unrest … Saddam may also begin a campaign of <b>terrorism </b></p>
<p><b>and sabotage</b>, possibly even before an attack began. Iraq has consistently </p>
<p>failed in previous attempts to conduct successful attacks, either through its own </p>
<p>agents or by proxy … But there is a risk that once Saddam was convinced a </p>
<p>regime threatening attack was inevitable he could become more willing to adopt </p>
<p>extreme, unpredictable and unorthodox courses of action.”</p>
<p><b>68. </b> The implication of the Assessment was that the US “must continue to convince </p>
<p>regional governments of its determination and ability to remove Saddam quickly and </p>
<p>offer credible plans for the aftermath”.</p>

<p>On 1 August, Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister wrote to Mr Kofi Annan, UN </p>
<p>Secretary&#8209;General proposing a further round of technical talks in Baghdad between Iraqi </p>
<p>technical experts and UNMOVIC:</p>
<p>“… to review what was accomplished in disarmament issues between May 1991 </p>
<p>until December 1998, to look into the remaining issues … included in the report </p>
<p>of Ambassador Amorim to the Security Council on 30 March 1999, and to study </p>
<p>and assess their importance and decide upon measures to resolve them when the </p>

<p>108</p>
<p>On 15 August, Dr Sabri sent a further letter to Mr Annan, repeating the offer of technical </p>
<p>discussions and asking for answers to questions to the questions it had presented to the </p>
<p>Security Council in March 2002.</p>

<p><b>Mr Straw’s meeting with Secretary Powell, 20 August 2002</b></p>
<p><b>80.  The British Embassy Washington warned that many in the US Administration </b></p>
<p><b>were talking about “when” military action would be taken, not “if”; and that the </b></p>
<p><b>views of Vice President Cheney and Secretary Rumsfeld were likely to prevail over </b></p>
<p><b>those of Secretary Powell.</b></p>
<p><b>81. </b> Following their discussion on 26 July (see Section 3.3), Mr Straw had agreed with </p>
<p>Secretary Powell that he should make an unpublicised visit to the USA on 20 August. </p>
<p><b>82. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Washington, wrote </p>
<p>to Mr Straw’s Private Office on 15 August to provide “a snapshot of the public mood and </p>
<p>what we are hearing from contacts on Iraq”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“Despite repeated affirmations that no decisions have yet been taken, there is a </p>
<p>general assumption that the [US] Administration is moving towards military action </p>
<p>to remove Saddam … The private language of the … majority of those to whom </p>
<p>we speak is ‘when rather than if’. There have been a string of … leaks from the </p>
<p>Pentagon about the feasibility and means of doing this … the President held a </p>
<p>carefully publicised meeting with Franks at the start of this month to look at military </p>
<p>options. Over the past few days we have begun to hear a consistent line from the </p>
<p>Administration … on why Saddam should be removed (BW [biological weapons/</p>
<p>warfare], links to terrorism, threat to neighbouring states, brutal oppressor). And </p>
<p>[John] Bolton [US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International </p>
<p>Security] told me yesterday that the US is planning to run a roadshow in the Autumn </p>
<p>about the threat of Iraq’s WMD.</p>
<p>“This does not mean the matter is yet settled. The debate on military tactics has </p>
<p>died down and is now focusing on some other very big problems. These include </p>
<p>widely publicised fears about possible use by Saddam of his WMD and the risk of </p>
<p>Israel being drawn in to a war … and the need to build more international support for </p>
<p>US actions.” </p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Brenton advised that the US felt a:</p>
<p>“… strong diplomatic and presentational need for the support, and perhaps </p>
<p>involvement, of a few key allies – with the UK close to the top of the list. They of </p>

<p>course recognise that allied support would be much easier to achieve if they could </p>
<p>get Security Council endorsement for military action. They are already playing </p>
<p>the inspections issue in the Council with a view to putting Saddam clearly in the </p>
<p>wrong. But they claim they … have sufficient legal justification for military action </p>
<p>in Saddam’s breach of earlier UNSC [UN Security Council] resolutions. It is highly </p>
<p>unlikely that they would go to the Council for further endorsement unless they were </p>
<p>100 percent sure they would get it. A number of Administration hawks … have made </p>
<p>it clear that in their view the case for regime change would not be affected if Saddam </p>
<p>accepted inspectors, on whatever terms.” </p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Brenton wrote that President Bush had “recently tried to calm the press frenzy </p>
<p>by talking about a ‘patient and deliberate’ approach”. American domestic and political </p>
<p>opinion would be more important to the US Administration than the UN. So far the </p>
<p>public debate had run “rather against the Administration” with a number of Republican </p>
<p>heavyweights, including General Scowcroft, “lining up to question the wisdom of military </p>
<p>action”. Opinion polls showed strong support for action. Congressional hearings would </p>
<p>resume on 16 September and Mr Brenton reported that there were indications that </p>
<p>Administration testimony would “start to make the case for military action”. </p>
<p><b>85. </b> Mr Brenton described what to do on the “day after” as the “most vexed” issue. </p>
<p>A senior State Department official had said that they were “increasingly thinking in </p>
<p>terms of some form of democracy, but recognised that it would need to be propped </p>
<p>up by a long term international, (i.e. almost certainly US) security presence”. In a </p>
<p>recent conference the Iraqi opposition had made it clear there should not be a “foreign </p>
<p>invasion”; they wanted to be in charge.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Mr Brenton concluded:</p>
<p>“Finally, as the key operational issues come to be addressed (including whether </p>
<p>to go ahead at all), there is the balance of power within the Administration. The </p>
<p>arch hawks are Rumsfeld and Cheney both of whom firmly support military action </p>
<p>and are undeterred by the possible effect on the already inflammable Middle East </p>
<p>(indeed they believe the successful US action in Iraq would have a salutary effect on </p>
<p>other troublesome entities in the region). The instincts of the President himself (and </p>
<p>therefore Rice [Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor]) </p>
<p>are likely to be closer to their side than to that of Powell, who is plausibly reported </p>
<p>to be more cautiously [sic]. There is also the political dimension. The Administration </p>
<p>will not want to get into a vote losing quagmire – but will also be wary of failing to </p>
<p>meet the strong expectations they have now created. The key point about this not </p>
<p>unfamiliar pattern … is that (eg as on the MEPP) it is normally the Rumsfeld/Cheney </p>
<p>faction that prevails.”</p>

<p>110</p>
<p><b>88.  The meeting of the National Security Council on 16 August decided that the </b></p>
<p><b>US strategy should be launched at the UN; but not what that strategy should be.</b></p>
<p><b>89. </b> Dr Rice wrote in her memoir that, in the National Security Council on 16 August, </p>
<p>“There was unanimous agreement that our new strategy should be launched at the </p>

<p>34</p>
<p><b>90.  When Mr Straw met Secretary Powell during an unpublicised visit to the US </b></p>
<p><b>on 20 August, he was informed that Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July </b></p>
<p><b>had been very timely; and that President Bush was keen to hear the outcome of </b></p>
<p><b>their talks.</b></p>
<p><b>91.  Mr Straw informed Secretary Powell that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair had been irritated to find himself in the position, where the US and </b></p>
<p><b>UK had been “outed” before they had been able to make the case with the </b></p>
<p><b>public for action against Iraq.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The UK’s draft dossier on Iraq did not in his view lead inexorably </b></p>
<p><b>to the conclusion that military action was the only way to deal with </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>A better case for action could be made.</b></p>
<p><b>92.  Mr Straw argued that the case for an international coalition was overwhelming </b></p>
<p><b>and UN “involvement” was essential. Military action would easier for the UK if </b></p>
<p><b>there was a UN resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>93.  Mr Blair wanted a “hard&#8209;edged ultimatum” issued by the UN with a clear link </b></p>
<p><b>to military action. He would stand by the US, but he was worried. The “UN was the </b></p>
<p><b>way through”; it was “an opportunity not an obstacle”.</b></p>
<p><b>94.  If Saddam Hussein accepted inspectors on US and UK terms, the UK view </b></p>
<p><b>was that the case for military action would be ended “for the time being”.</b></p>
<p><b>95.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell agreed that a key question was whether they </b></p>
<p><b>could live with a Saddam Hussein who had fulfilled the UN mandate.</b></p>
<p><b>96. </b> Lord Williams of Baglan, Special Adviser to Mr Straw from 2001 to 2005, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“As the summer months approached I felt increasingly that the war was becoming </p>
<p>unavoidable and the Bush Administration had made up its mind on this course </p>
<p>of action. The only question remaining was whether the UK would join in the </p>
<p>military assault.”</p>

<p><b>97. </b> Lord Williams added that he had used the summer to write a long note for Mr Straw </p>
<p>on US military actions since the Second World War, the position taken by the UK </p>
<p>Government on those actions, and the relevance to an invasion of Iraq, concluding </p>
<p>with the suggestion that, “if war in Iraq was to involve the UK it would be strategic and </p>
<p>political folly without UN authorisation”. </p>
<p><b>98. </b> The FCO was unable to find a copy of the document for Lord Williams before he </p>
<p>gave evidence. </p>
<p><b>99. </b> Lord Williams had advised Mr Straw that “while containment had successfully boxed </p>
<p>in would be aggressors, it has done nothing to stem the spread of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> That had been addressed through arms control treaties: it had been in the </p>
<p>mutual interest of both the US and the Soviet Union to reach such agreements. It had </p>
<p>been “less successful in dealing with ‘rogue states’ and … WMD” where there were “no </p>
<p>mutual interests between rogue states and the US”. Containment was “by definition” an </p>
<p>“acceptance of the status quo” and it was questionable whether that was “acceptable </p>
<p>with regard to WMD”. In his view, the “experience of North Korea” had taught the Bush </p>
<p>Administration “a bitter lesson it does not want to repeat with Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> The lessons for Iraq to be drawn from history which Lord Williams had offered </p>
<p>Mr Straw were: </p>
<p>“With the exception of Vietnam, the United States has always fought alongside </p>
<p>substantial Allied Forces. On most occasions since 1945 … it has done so under </p>
<p>a UN mandate. It is not unthinkable that the US could do so … against Iraq. </p>
<p>A UN mandate may not be so unattainable …</p>
<p>“The advantage for the US of a UN mandate would be twofold. Firstly, substantial </p>
<p>Allied support would be likely … Secondly, most importantly, a UN mandate will </p>
<p>be essential for post war Iraq. It will simply not be possible for the US to do this </p>
<p>alone … Experience elsewhere … has underlined the necessity of UN involvement </p>
<p>as the mechanism indispensable for the marshalling of global, political and </p>
<p>economic support in the context of post war [re]construction.</p>
<p>“… ‘regime change’ per se has seldom been a declared war aim. Nevertheless, </p>
<p>it was the declared war aim of the Allies from 1942 …</p>
<p>“In more recent cases involving the UK, the defeat of Argentina in … 1982 … led </p>
<p>to the ousting of the junta … while the defeat of Serbia in … Kosovo … led to the </p>
<p>overthrow of Milošević within twelve months. Despicable though both regimes were, </p>
<p>neither were as brutal and totalitarian as … Saddam Hussein who survived military </p>
<p>defeat in 1991 only through the exercise of extreme political coercion domestically. </p>
<p>This … made it unlikely short of Saddam’s death that his regime could change </p>

<p><b>101. </b> A copy of the minute, which was sent to Mr Straw on 19 August, was sent to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 21 August.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>102. </b> When Mr Straw and Secretary Powell met on 20 August, they discussed Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Note to President Bush of 28 July and its impact on thinking in the US.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, reported that </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had “spoken frankly”. He told Mr Straw that Mr Blair’s “letter [the Note </p>
<p>of 28 July]” to President Bush had been “very timely”. The “case for doing something </p>
<p>straight away was being pressed hard”. Secretary Powell was “putting the case for a </p>
<p>longer haul”, including during a private dinner with President Bush at which Dr Rice was </p>
<p>been the only other person present. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that what happened next would depend on what </p>
<p>US “Principals” heard in their meeting 10 days later, “in particular about the status of </p>
<p>the military plan”. President Bush was keen to hear the outcome of the discussion </p>
<p>with Mr Straw. Dossiers on the “case for action” were being prepared: “True believers </p>
<p>would see a smoking gun no matter what. But most of the stuff Iraq was importing was </p>
<p>dual&#8209;use. It was not clear that the situation was any more serious this year than last.” </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Straw handed over a copy of the UK’s draft dossier on Iraq: “Although it made </p>
<p>clear that Saddam was a very bad man, the contents did not lead inexorably to the </p>
<p>conclusion that the only way to deal with him was by military action.” Secretary Powell </p>
<p>agreed that “containment had worked”. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he had discussed the position with Mr Blair the </p>
<p>previous day. Mr Blair was concerned and had:</p>
<p>“… asked him to stress that the problem was that we had been ‘outed’ long before </p>
<p>we had been able to make the case with the public for action … [Mr Blair] was </p>
<p>also signed up to the importance of the relationship with the US, and had moved </p>
<p>mountains to ensure that the EU stayed in line with the US. Nonetheless, he had </p>
<p>been irritated to find himself in his present position because of US hawks … The key </p>
<p>issue … was whether the US wanted an international coalition or not. The US could </p>
<p>go it alone; if they wanted that, they had only to tell us.” </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Straw’s view was that:</p>
<p>“… the case for an international coalition was overwhelming: first for basing and </p>
<p>access and then for what would happen after getting rid of Saddam. But also, </p>

<p>especially, if things went wrong. In such circumstances the US would need the </p>
<p>international community at the scene of the crime … A solo US effort that ended </p>
<p>in failure would give those who saw the EU as an alternative power to the US the </p>
<p>chance they had been waiting for. </p>
<p>“If the US answer to a coalition was ‘yes’, then UN involvement was essential. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister’s letter [the Note of 28 July] had been a little ambiguous on </p>
<p>who should issue the ultimatum; yesterday he [Mr Blair] had been clear that the </p>
<p>ultimatum should issue from the UN. He wanted a hard&#8209;edged ultimatum with a clear </p>
<p>link to military action – but recognised that achieving such a text would be difficult. If </p>
<p>Saddam … accepted inspectors on our terms, the Prime Minister thought that would </p>
<p>end the case for military action for the time being. But he thought Saddam unlikely </p>
<p>to give in.” </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Mr Straw said that he had a slightly different opinion: “Saddam was a busker and </p>
<p>survivor”. Mr Straw added that: “it would be harder to make the case for military action </p>
<p>if he [Saddam Hussein] had been disarmed – and, eventually, Saddam would go”. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair’s view was that building a coalition </p>
<p>“meant working through the UN”; and that in the Middle East it meant doing something </p>
<p>on the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP). Mr Blair would be “willing to spend time and </p>
<p>political capital” on the latter “including holding a peace conference”. Secretary Powell </p>
<p>responded that although he had been the principal advocate of a conference, there were </p>
<p>not “enough elements to get it together”. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> Addressing the “public case”, Mr Straw said that the UK dossier:</p>
<p>“… needed a compelling last chapter. We could make a better case than the one </p>
<p>we had made so far. Traditional Cold War&#8209;style containment did not work for WMD. </p>
<p>Rogue states did not have as much at stake as the Soviet bloc.”</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Mr Straw said that he had told Mr Blair about Secretary Powell’s “more sceptical </p>
<p>view of Russia’s likely support” but Mr Blair “was convinced that securing Russia </p>
<p>depended on the price”.</p>
<p><b>112. </b> Mr Straw asked whether military action would work. Secretary Powell explained </p>
<p>that US thinking had developed since the end of July; the “standing start” needed </p>
<p>an Iraqi trigger, so the US enthusiasm for it had waned. The focus was now on the </p>
<p>“generated case”. </p>
<p><b>113. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that “if there were action tomorrow the Prime </p>
<p>Minister would be in difficulties”. It was “not just the usual suspects causing trouble”; </p>
<p>respected retired officials were “publicly raising doubts” and the “lawyers were saying in </p>
<p>terms that there were not sufficient grounds … to support regime change”. On “military </p>
<p>action more generally” the lawyers “had not definitively opined but had said it would be </p>
<p>easier if there were an SCR”. Mr Straw drew Secretary Powell’s attention to the passage </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>in Mr Blair’s Note of 28 July that “in Britain, right now, I couldn’t be sure of support from </p>
<p>Parliament, Party, public or even some of the Cabinet”. In Mr Straw’s view, if Cabinet </p>
<p>held a secret ballot, it was unlikely that Mr Blair would win.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> On the “day after”, Mr Straw said that Iraq had been “the artificial creation of the </p>
<p>UK in 1921. The country had no experience of democracy and democracy could pull </p>
<p>it apart.” </p>
<p><b>115. </b> Secretary Powell had said he “took it” that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… wanted some kind of UN resolution. Some of his colleagues did not want UN </p>
<p>involvement in any shape: it might frustrate their purpose. But he did not think the </p>
<p>evil/moral case worked: there were lots of evil people we did not go after.</p>
<p>“At the (video) meeting last week, he had made the argument that the US was </p>
<p>isolated and had slipped badly in the Arab world … and must make the case in </p>
<p>the international community, otherwise the US would be accused of the biggest </p>
<p>act of unilateralism … So the US should start making the case in the President’s </p>
<p>12 September speech [to the UN General Assembly]. The Vice President had come </p>
<p>on board but added the line that we could not allow the UN to stop us if we did not </p>
<p>like the way things were going. Importantly, the President had repeated that the </p>
<p>objective of regime change was getting rid of WMD. Others in the (virtual) meeting </p>
<p>had not, he thought, appreciated the importance of what the President was saying; </p>
<p>but, for Powell, the logic of the President’s position meant that, if WMD were dealt </p>
<p>with, regime change would no longer be required.” </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Secretary Powell said that “the hawks had not made the terrorism case against </p>
<p>Iraq” and Iraq had not threatened the US; “Saddam was a ‘regional bastard’. So the </p>
<p>US might find itself taking action for the benefit of regional friends who were not keen </p>
<p>on that action.” </p>
<p><b>117. </b> Secretary Powell was “still alone in the Administration, except for the President”. </p>
<p>In response to Mr Straw’s question about what the UK could do to help, Secretary Powell </p>
<p>said that “if his strategy was OK’d by the President, the US would need to share” with the </p>
<p>UK “what they had planned at UNGA [UN General Assembly]” and would need the UK </p>
<p>“to back them up in the Security Council”. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> Summarising their discussion, Secretary Powell said that he and Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“… were agreed that we had to do something with our public and with the </p>
<p>international community. We had to think about the ‘ultimatum sentence’ and </p>
<p>recognise that if Saddam accepted inspectors, military action would be on hold. </p>
<p>A key question then was whether we could live with a Saddam who had fulfilled </p>
<p>the UN mandate.”</p>

<p><b>119. </b> Secretary Powell said that:</p>
<p>“… war in Iraq would define the first term. He poured scorn on the hawks’ beliefs: </p>
<p>that a quick triumph was inevitable because Iraqis were waiting to be liberated; and </p>
<p>that victory in Iraq would help the MEPP and spread democracy in the region. What </p>
<p>would the Syrians and Iranians make of the US action – where next?” </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Asked where Mr Blair stood, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“… if he had a free choice, the PM wanted to get rid of Saddam. But the more he </p>
<p>thought about it the more difficult it looked to the PM. He would stand by the US but </p>
<p>he was worried. The UN was the way through. An effort now could be a dry run for </p>
<p>later if military action were required. As the PM had said to him, the UN should be </p>
<p>seen as an opportunity, not an obstacle.”</p>
<p><b>121. </b> The record of the discussion was to be seen only by Sir David Manning and </p>
<p>Mr Blair. </p>
<p><b>122. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote: </p>
<p>“Not for the first time, and certainly not for the last, Colin opened up to me about his </p>
<p>intense frustration with parts of the Administration; in particular Dick Cheney and </p>
<p>Don Rumsfeld … I left the Hamptons pleased that Colin and I were in agreement </p>
<p>and hopeful that although it was going to take a great effort, we might be able to get </p>
<p>the Bush Administration to go to the UN.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>The position at the end of August 2002</b></p>
<p><b>The legal view</b></p>
<p><b>123.  During August 2002, Mr Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser, continued to </b></p>
<p><b>express concerns about assumptions that, in the absence of an identified legal </b></p>
<p><b>basis, the UK would participate if military action was taken by the US.</b></p>
<p><b>124.  Lord Goldsmith remained concerned to address the issues. </b></p>
<p><b>125. </b> Mr Wood wrote to Mr Stephen Wright, FCO Deputy Under Secretary Defence and </p>
<p>Intelligence, and other senior colleagues on 15 August expressing concern that, while he </p>
<p>appreciated that no decision had been taken, “there appears to be an assumption that if </p>
<p>military action were taken by the US, we would not only support but participate”.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>126. </b> Mr Wood wrote that while it was “ultimately for the Attorney General to advise HMG </p>
<p>on matters of this importance”, he thought it would “be helpful” to colleagues to briefly </p>
<p>restate the legal position. He was “not, at present, aware of facts which would provide a </p>
<p>respectable legal basis for military action, though further action by the Security Council </p>

<p>could provide such a basis.” Unless there was “a proper legal basis for military action, </p>
<p>individual members of the Armed Forces and civilian officials … would also be potentially </p>
<p>liable to charges of murder.” </p>
<p><b>127. </b> Mr Wood warned that: “To advocate the use of force without a proper legal basis </p>
<p>is to advocate the commission of the crime of aggression, one of the most serious </p>
<p>offences under international law.” He also referred to the importance that: “HMG act </p>
<p>in accordance with international law, and not only because this is required by the </p>
<p>Ministerial Code.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Mr Wright responded:</p>
<p>“… I work on the premise that if a question of military action arises, the Attorney </p>

<p> He would be away on an official visit until 8 September and it would </p>
<p>be helpful if they could start now to identify what timing Mr Powell had in mind. </p>

<p><b>136.  The JIC had little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW and little insight into how it </b></p>

<p><b>137. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment on 21 August </p>
<p>considering “what diplomatic options Saddam has to deter, avert or limit the scope of </p>
<p>a US&#8209;led attack”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> It also considered his “military options for facing a US&#8209;led attack” </p>
<p>and how his analysis about each course of action might “change as an attack becomes </p>
<p>increasingly imminent”. </p>
<p><b>138. </b> During the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment, it was suggested that Saddam </p>
<p>was “likely to exploit options on weapons inspectors as a stalling tactic. An offer of </p>
<p>unconditional access for weapons inspectors would attract international approval, and </p>
<p>allow Saddam breathing space.”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>139. </b> The JIC examined Iraq’s options for the short term, whether Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>might seize the initiative, how Iraq might respond to a US military build&#8209;up, Saddam’s </p>

<p>at the death”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein was “likely to pursue continued talks with the UN on the return of </b></p>
<p><b>weapons inspectors as a means to delay a US attack. He would permit their return if </b></p>
<p><b>he believed that the threat of large&#8209;scale military action was imminent.” </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam would “play for time”, avoiding “giving the US a pretext to attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By mid&#8209;July 2002 Saddam had “started to believe that a US&#8209;led attack was </p>
<p>inevitable and would threaten his regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An Iraqi “statement that inspectors would be allowed to return unconditionally </p>
<p>would attract considerable international approval” and “reinforce regional </p>
<p>concerns about the military option, even before Iraqi willingness to implement </p>
<p>the agreement had been put to the test”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that “until US military action seemed imminent” Iraq would make </p>
<p>“incremental improvements” to its “offer on inspectors that fell short of accepting </p>
<p>the … requirements of the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If inspectors did return, the JIC repeated its judgement of 27 February that Iraq </p>
<p>would “embark on a renewed policy of frustration, involving denial, deception, </p>
<p>obstruction and delay”.</p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein would “try a mix of charm, bribery and threats with his </b></p>
<p><b>neighbours”. Iraq’s influence was “limited, although Saddam” was “adept at </b></p>
<p><b>manipulating popular Arab opinion”.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam would seek to deter the US “and/or potential regional allies” and use </p>
<p>diplomacy to persuade or coerce his neighbours not to provide bases.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “likely to pursue every opportunity to split the … Security Council and </p>
<p>particularly the P5”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would also seek to “exert economic leverage”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could “play on regional fears” that a military attack “would have </p>
<p>unacceptable outcomes” such as threatening Iraq’s integrity, encircling Iran or </p>
<p>emboldening the US to attack other countries.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s ability to influence neighbouring governments was “strictly limited”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam was “likely to try to do all he can to exploit the Israel/Palestinian crisis”. </p>
<p>The JIC pointed out that, “Practical support to Palestinian rejectionists groups” </p>
<p>was “limited”; and there was “little scope for Iraq to improve its position” as the </p>
<p>most effective groups were “closer to Iran”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam was “adept at manipulating popular Arab opinion”.</p>
<p><b>“Much as Saddam would like to seize the initiative before a US attack, his options </b></p>
<p><b>remain limited.” He was “likely to be cautious about using force early. But the </b></p>
<p><b>closer and more credible an attack seemed, the more risks he will be willing to take, </b></p>
<p><b>perhaps including deniable terrorist attacks, most likely in the Gulf region – though </b></p>
<p><b>we cannot exclude a threat to the UK.”</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “concerted attempt” to bring down an aircraft in one of the No&#8209;Fly Zones was </p>
<p>“a possibility”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A pre&#8209;emptive attack on the Kurds or Kuwait was judged “unlikely”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An attempt to destabilise the two main Kurdish parties “to complicate coalition </p>
<p>planning” was “more likely”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam “would probably … order preparations for a campaign of <b>terrorism and </b></p>
<p><b>sabotage</b> in the region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we know that Iraqi Special Forces and other organisations, such as the </p>
<p>‘Saddam Fedayeen’, also possess the capability to conduct sabotage or terrorist </p>
<p>attacks.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Palestinian groups “could be reluctant to carry out attacks which did not further </p>
<p>their own objectives”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “possible that Iraqi terrorist attacks could be conducted against other </p>
<p>[non&#8209;military] interests or the leadership and economic (e.g. oil industry) targets </p>
<p>of regional States”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC did not “know enough about Iraqi capabilities to discount the threat </p>
<p>outside the region, including within the UK, though previously Iraqi attempts to </p>
<p>mount terrorist attacks, or engage proxies to do so on their behalf, have been </p>
<p>largely ineffective”.</p>
<p><b>“Early on in any conflict, Saddam would order missile attacks on Israel, coalition </b></p>
<p><b>forces and regional states providing the US with bases.”</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam would probably order missile attacks …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that attacks on Israel would be “an attempt to attract Israeli </p>
<p>retaliation and thus widen the war, split the coalition and arouse popular opinion </p>
<p>in the Arab States”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Missiles “could be armed with chemical or biological warfare (CBW) agents”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam might be deterred at least initially by the threat of Israeli nuclear </p>
<p>retaliation.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had a “limited number of long range missiles … available”; the JIC assessed </p>
<p>“12&#8209;20 650km range Al Hussein missiles”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had produced more than 50 Al Samoud missiles with a range of 150km.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Attacks on coalition forces in Kuwait would require Iraq to deploy short&#8209;range </p>
<p>missiles into the “No Drive Zone”.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A pre&#8209;emptive missile attack on Israel was “less likely because it would show </p>
<p>Iraq had been lying about its retention of long range missiles”.</p>
<p><b>“Saddam would order the use of CBW against coalition forces at some point, </b></p>
<p><b>probably after a coalition attack had begun. Once Saddam was convinced that his </b></p>
<p><b>fate was sealed, he would order the unrestrained use of CBW against coalition </b></p>
<p><b>forces, supporting regional states and Israel.”</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although it had “little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW doctrine” and knew “little about </p>
<p>Iraq’s CBW work since late 1998”, the JIC judged it “likely that Saddam would </p>
<p>order the use of CBW against coalition forces at some point, probably after </p>
<p>coalition attacks had begun”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi CBW use “would become increasingly likely the closer coalition forces </p>
<p>came to Baghdad. Military targets might include troop concentrations or </p>
<p>important fixed targets in rear areas such as ports and airfields.”</p>
<p>49 </p>
<p>Resolution 949 (1994) imposed a “No Drive Zone” in Iraq south of the 32nd parallel.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “might pursue an extreme course of action at an earlier stage” </p>
<p>if he judged it to be “worth the risk of providing the US with overt justification to </p>
<p>attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Unorthodox options might include “the early or pre&#8209;emptive use of <b>CBW</b>”; </p>
<p>“<b>CBW terrorism</b>: although Saddam probably lacks the capability to deploy a </p>
<p>sophisticated device, he could cause widespread panic”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Should he feel his fate is sealed, Saddam’s judgement might change to ‘bring </p>
<p>the temple down’ on his enemies no matter what the cost …” At that stage, </p>
<p>“Saddam would order the unrestrained use of CBW against coalition forces, </p>
<p>supporting regional states and Israel, although he would face practical problems </p>
<p>of command and control, the loyalty of his commanders, logistics problems and </p>
<p>the availability of chemical and biological agents in sufficient quantities to be </p>
<p>effective and the means to deliver them.”</p>
<p><b>“Iraq would probably try to ride out air strikes while conserving its ground forces. </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s likely strategy for a ground war would be to make any coalition advance as </b></p>
<p><b>slow and costly as possible, trying to force the coalition to fight in urban areas.”</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “little insight into how the Iraqi military might plan to fight any </p>
<p>ground war … At present we have little evidence to judge whether Iraq sees </p>
<p>urban or guerrilla warfare as feasible options. Iraqi effectiveness would be </p>
<p>mitigated by problems of command and control, inadequate training and poor </p>
<p>morale. We doubt that guerrilla activity would be very effective; urban warfare is </p>
<p>more plausible …” </p>
<p><b>“There is a significant potential for Saddam to miscalculate, either by escalating </b></p>
<p><b>a crisis at an early stage, or by making concessions too late in the day to avert an </b></p>
<p><b>attack.”</b></p>
<p><b>Dr Blix’s interview, 25 August 2002</b></p>
<p><b>143. </b> In an interview on <i>NBC</i>’s <i>Meet the Press</i> programme on 25 August, Dr Hans Blix, </p>
<p>Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, stated that there had been “discussion and dialogue </p>
<p>under the auspices of the [UN] Secretary&#8209;General” since the early part of 2002, in which </p>
<p>Iraq had “shown a greater interest in inspections”; but he could not say that they had </p>
<p>“moved closer to an invitation to the inspectors”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Dr Blix added that Iraq did not see inspections as an isolated issue, it should be </p>
<p>addressed in conjunction with and concurrently with other outstanding issues. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Asked whether Iraq possessed biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, Dr Blix </p>
<p>responded that there were “many open questions” but the inspectors did not have proof </p>
<p>that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. </p>

<p>121</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Dr Blix stated that, to be effective, inspectors needed “immediate, unrestricted and </p>
<p>unconditional” access to sites; they needed information; and they needed skill. Under </p>
<p>the previous inspections regime there were relatively few problematic inspections where </p>
<p>access was denied. The burden of proof did not lie with the inspectors to prove that </p>
<p>Iraq was guilty. It was “for Iraq to restore confidence in the world that they do not have </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction”. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> Dr Blix pointed out that “an absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence”.</p>
<p><b>FCO advice, 27 August 2002</b></p>
<p><b>148.  The FCO’s further advice on the possible text of a draft resolution judged </b></p>
<p><b>that an ultimatum calling for the re&#8209;admission of inspectors would be “difficult </b></p>
<p><b>to secure” but was “not out of reach”.</b></p>
<p><b>149.  If the talks between Iraq and the UN about the return of inspectors petered </b></p>
<p><b>out or “better” broke down, that could provide a “trigger” for such a resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>150.  The objective was for a resolution which would provide legal cover for </b></p>
<p><b>military action, in the event of a refusal to comply with an ultimatum, without </b></p>
<p><b>the need for further action in the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>151.  Mr Straw suggested that the UK dossier might be published via the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Rycroft had commissioned further advice from the FCO on what a UN </p>
<p>ultimatum would look like, and how it would be achieved, for Mr Blair’s return to work in </p>
<p>late August (see Section 3.3).</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>153. </b> The FCO advised No.10 on 27 August that it had “now done further work on the </p>
<p>possibility of a Security Council ultimatum to Iraq”, and that “President Bush’s speech </p>
<p>to the UN General Assembly on 12 September could be an important curtain&#8209;raiser.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An ultimatum would be “difficult to secure” but it was “not out of reach”. It would “need </p>
<p>a carefully managed campaign during the early autumn” and “a great deal of work in </p>
<p>P5 capitals”. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Considering tactics in the Security Council, the FCO advised that the UN/Iraq “talks </p>
<p>petering out, or, better, a definite breakdown due to Iraqi intransigence” could provide a </p>
<p>“trigger” for a resolution. If inspectors were allowed back into Iraq, “the trigger could be a </p>
<p>report by Blix on Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation”. </p>
<p><b>155. </b> The text of a resolution would be “conditioned to some extent by the wider context”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>is a serious Iraqi outrage, the harder the language, the more difficult it will be to get the </p>
<p>resolution through”.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> The FCO had produced a “more developed reworking” of the draft elements </p>
<p>for a resolution setting out an ultimatum it had offered on 26 July. The key options </p>
<p>identified were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A choice between describing Iraq’s refusal to accept the return of weapons </p>
<p>inspectors as a “material breach” of resolution 687 (1991) (the cease&#8209;fire </p>
<p>resolution) or a “flagrant violation”. The former would be clearer and send a very </p>
<p>direct message, but “might be difficult for some Council members to accept”. </p>
<p>The latter might be “a little easier to sell” and was an “obvious fact”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether to include an explicit operative paragraph setting a date for Iraq to allow </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA “immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access … </p>
<p>so that they may discharge their mandates”, after which it would be deemed that </p>
<p>Iraq had no intention of complying with its obligations. Such a paragraph was </p>
<p>seen to have “political and presentational” advantages although it might “not be </p>
<p>indispensable” if a date were to be included in an earlier operative paragraph </p>
<p>which demanded that Iraq immediately reverse its non&#8209;co&#8209;operation with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> The FCO advised that, subject to Lord Goldsmith’s views, a resolution “(particularly </p>
<p>with ‘material breach’ language) would still give cover for military action, and that in legal </p>
<p>terms no further Council decisions would be required”. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> The FCO warned that, in the absence of clear language on a demand that Iraq </p>
<p>reverse its non&#8209;co&#8209;operation within a specified time, the opponents of military action </p>
<p>would argue that Iraq “should be given still more time to comply”. It would be “important” </p>
<p>that the draft resolution provided “legal cover for military action without further Council </p>
<p>action”. The Attorney General’s advice would be needed on that point.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Straw considered that the UK should try to persuade President Bush to state </p>
<p>that the aim of regime change was to ensure the disarmament of Iraq. The most </p>
<p>appropriate occasion might be the President’s speech to the UN General Assembly in </p>
<p>September, as part of a wider challenge to the UN to demonstrate that it could tackle </p>

<p><b>The US perspective, late August 2002</b></p>
<p><b>161.  The debate on Iraq in the US continued throughout August.</b></p>
<p><b>162.  A speech by Vice President Cheney on 26 August fuelled that debate.</b></p>
<p><b>163. </b> In a press conference with Secretary Rumsfeld at Crawford on 21 August, about </p>
<p>security and defence issues, President Bush was asked whether the US had the </p>
<p>capacity to “go to war with Saddam” alone; and whether, given remarks by General </p>
<p>Franks that he was drawing up war plans to provide credible options, the American </p>
<p>people should conclude that a decision was imminent.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>164. </b> In response to the first question, Secretary Rumsfeld described the intense </p>
<p>speculation about Iraq as “frenzy”; President Bush said that he would be consulting </p>
<p>allies and Congress about how to secure peace. In response to the second question, </p>
<p>President Bush said only that the US had to be prepared to use its military and other </p>
<p>assets to “keep the peace” in the face of an unstable world and a global terrorist </p>
<p>network that might strike anywhere; and that General Franks’ job was to prepare </p>
<p>for contingencies.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> In an article in the <i>New York Times</i> on 25 August, Mr James Baker, former US </p>
<p>Secretary of State, called for “a simple and straightforward resolution requiring that Iraq </p>
<p>submit to intrusive inspections anytime, anywhere, with no exceptions, and authorizing </p>
<p>all necessary means to enforce it”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>166. </b> In his memoir, Vice President Cheney wrote that the White House had been talking </p>
<p>about the idea of an “aggressive” inspection regime, advanced by Dr Rice, which was </p>
<p>so intrusive it might result in toppling Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> It had been discussed by the </p>
<p>President and Mr Blair, but he (Vice President Cheney) “didn’t buy it”. He had therefore </p>
<p>decided to press the issue in his speech on the threat from terrorism to a National </p>
<p>Conference of the Veterans of Foreign Wars on 26 August. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> In the speech, Vice President Cheney stated that Saddam Hussein had “made a </p>
<p>science out of deceiving the international community”. Vice President Cheney stated </p>
<p>that there was no doubt that Saddam Hussein had WMD and Iraq was enhancing its </p>
<p>capabilities. He concluded: “the risk of inaction is far greater than the risk of action”. </p>
<p>There was “no assurance whatsoever” that inspections would produce compliance </p>
<p>with UN resolutions; on the contrary there was “a great danger that it would provide </p>
<p>false comfort”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>168. </b> In her memoir, Dr Rice wrote that President Bush asked her to call Vice President </p>
<p>Cheney after his speech to say that the President hadn’t yet made a decision. She had </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>told the Vice President that President Bush was “concerned that your speech is being </p>
<p>read as a decision to skip the UN and challenge Saddam unilaterally”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>169. </b> Sir David Manning was contacted by Dr Rice on 28 August.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> She stressed that, </p>
<p>despite the statements and articles over the previous few days, the US position had not </p>
<p>changed. President Bush was “determined to build international support for action on </p>
<p>Iraq” and believed it was possible:</p>
<p>“He was working on the ‘UN route’, and planned to use his UNGA speech to </p>
<p>challenge the international community to deal with the Saddam threat. He was </p>
<p>thinking of proposing that the UN should pass a further tough resolution demanding </p>
<p>wide&#8209;ranging disarmament measures from Saddam. If he accepted them (which she </p>
<p>thought unlikely) Saddam would be forced to run Iraq in a completely different way.”</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that Mr Blair “too, remained in the same place”, and that the </p>
<p>UK “well understood the recent difficulties”. They “pointed to the need for a core script </p>
<p>we could all stick to”. Dr Rice had agreed.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Sir David also said that a “clear line of action” was needed. Challenging and </p>
<p>encouraging the international community to deal with Iraq through the UN “sounded </p>
<p>exactly the right course”. If the context was right, “action would become much easier”. </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“Action through the UN would do much to change the profile of the problem. If the </p>
<p>UN route succeeded, well and good. If it did not, we would at least have tried to work </p>
<p>with the international community. And anyone who blocked effective action in the UN </p>
<p>would not only have to explain why, but … what they would do instead.”</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Dr Rice agreed; President Bush wanted to speak to Mr Blair the next day. Sir David </p>
<p>and Dr Rice also discussed a meeting, possibly on 11 September.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Sir David commented to Mr Blair that the discussion:</p>
<p>“… was encouraging. The signs are that Bush is now thinking of opting for a coalition </p>
<p>strategy that takes account of the UN (though probably on pretty tough terms). </p>
<p>I was particularly struck by Condi’s remark that Saddam would have to run Iraq </p>
<p>in a different way if he signed up to proper disarmament measures. The fact that </p>
<p>the Administration is now conceptualising this thought, rather than reiterating its </p>
<p>commitment to regime change irrespective of Saddam’s behaviour, is significant.</p>
<p>“… My sense is that he [President Bush] will be keen to know that he still has your </p>
<p>support; and keen to know that you approve of his plans to work through the UN. </p>
<p>I am sure you should encourage him strongly.</p>

<p>Iraq issue.” </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The record of that discussion was sent only to Mr Straw outside No.10.</p>

<p>59</p>
<p> He had “called more </p>
<p>clearly for Iraq to comply with UNSCRs [UN Security Council resolutions] by disarming </p>
<p>fully”, but had “underlined concerns that Saddam would nonetheless continue to plot to </p>
<p>develop WMD”.</p>

<p>On 29 August 2002, President Bush signed the national security document, ‘Iraq: Goals, </p>

<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The stated goal of the US was to free Iraq in order to:</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Liberate the Iraqi people from tyranny and assist them in creating a society </p>
<p>based on moderation, pluralism and democracy.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>The document stated that “the United States is prepared to play a sustained role in </p>
<p>the reconstruction of post&#8209;Saddam Iraq with contribution from and participation of the </p>

<p>“… how to move forward on the diplomatic track. One option was to seek a UN </p>

<p><b>177. </b> President Bush added that Vice President Cheney and Mr Rumsfeld “believed that </p>
<p>going to the UN would trigger a long bureaucratic process that would leave Saddam </p>
<p>even more dangerous”. But Secretary Powell had told him that “a UN resolution was </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S DISCUSSION WITH PRESIDENT BUSH, 29 AUGUST 2002</p>
<p><b>178.  President Bush and Mr Blair discussed the need to make clear that Iraq was </b></p>
<p><b>the UN’s problem on 29 August. The issue had to be disarmament, not just the </b></p>
<p><b>return of the inspectors, with a tough and unconditional resolution so that if Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>complied it would change the way the regime operated. </b></p>
<p><b>179.  Mr Blair’s view was that conflict was “inevitable” because he did not think </b></p>
<p><b>that Saddam Hussein would comply with the UN’s demands; “but the choice </b></p>
<p><b>was Saddam’s”.</b></p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke on 29 August.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair and President Bush had discussed the </p>
<p>implications of speculation in August and Mr Blair’s view that the US and UK had been </p>
<p>“outed before being fully ready to make the case” against Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush had also discussed the need to make clear that Iraq </p>
<p>was the UN’s problem and that the issue was total disarmament of Iraq’s WMD and </p>
<p>associated systems not just the reintroduction of inspectors. The next phase should be </p>
<p>to go to the Security Council with a resolution which put the burden on Iraq. That would </p>
<p>put the US and the UK on the front foot and the challenge was for the international </p>
<p>community and the UN. Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“… wanted the UN to meet that challenge, but if it could not we would have to act. </p>
<p>So we should remake the case, put together the evidence against Saddam, and </p>
<p>work up a UNSCR … [It] needed to be tough and unconditional so that – if Iraq </p>
<p>complied – it would change the way the regime operated. It was right to issue not an </p>
<p>ultimatum to the UN but a challenge to the international community.” </p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Blair also said that, before that, what was needed was “a line to take” so that </p>
<p>“we were all answering the difficult questions in the same way”, including timing, the </p>
<p>nature of the challenge to the UN, and whether conflict was inevitable. He said that the </p>
<p>UN route “if pursued carefully was an opportunity, not an obstacle”. </p>

<p><b>184. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“… we were in the same place as the US. September should be the month to sort </p>
<p>out the strategy. We should be clear within two weeks how the UN route should </p>
<p>work. We were determined to deal with the WMD issue. September 11 had taught us </p>

<p><b>187.  Dr Rice told Sir David Manning that President Bush had worked carefully </b></p>
<p><b>through the ideas in Mr Blair’s Note of 28 July and concluded the best way </b></p>
<p><b>forward was the “UN route”.</b></p>
<p><b>188.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that the UK would share its ideas on a </b></p>
<p><b>resolution “shortly”.</b></p>
<p><b>189.  Dr Rice and Sir David also discussed the need to launch an effective public </b></p>
<p><b>relations campaign to coincide with the decision to go back to the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>190. </b> Dr Rice and Sir David Manning spoke later that day to follow up the discussion </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and President Bush.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>191. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David Manning that President Bush had given “a great deal of </p>
<p>thought to Iraq during his summer vacation at the Crawford ranch”. He had worked </p>
<p>carefully through the ideas in Mr Blair’s Note of 28 July and had concluded the best way </p>
<p>forward was the UN route. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice discussed how an approach to secure UN action might </p>
<p>best be pursued and agreed that it would be useful for Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s </p>

<p>Hussein’s Iraqi regime. </p>
<p><b>193. </b> The possible timetable for launching the initiative in the UN and the contents of a </p>
<p>UN resolution were also explored. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> The options for a UN resolution included a very short resolution along the lines of </p>
<p>the ultimatum to Iraq in 1990 or a fuller resolution which spelt out:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent to which Saddam was in violation of previous resolutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the steps he must take if Iraq was to be welcomed back into the international </p>
<p>community; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a “real” deadline, possibly 1 November. </p>
<p><b>195. </b> The possibility of “very invasive” measures, which would involve troops being </p>
<p>deployed inside Iraq, e.g. to protect the inspectors or in northern Iraq to prevent attacks </p>
<p>on the Kurds, and which would change the way Saddam Hussein could rule Iraq, were </p>
<p>also raised.</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that a deadline “must be right if we were to avoid endless </p>
<p>prevarication and evasion”. He referred to the model which had been used “successfully” </p>
<p>the previous year in dealing with the Taliban, and said that the UK had done some </p>

<p>69</p>
<p> He “stressed” </p>
<p>the importance of ensuring that there was “no daylight” between the US and UK in their </p>
<p>public presentations and the need “in particular to focus on the WMD threat and how </p>
<p>best to address it”. That meant:</p>
<p>“… we needed to use the UN track. This was the best way to pursue control of </p>
<p>WMD. It would help to build international support. And if Iraq rejected a robust </p>
<p>inspection regime, it would strengthen the case for other action.” </p>
<p><b>199. </b> The discussions acknowledged that much of the intelligence on Iraq’s WMD was </p>
<p>“inferential” and that the “aim” should be to present the case “in terms of [Iraqi] failure to </p>

<p>THE BRITISH EMBASSY WASHINGTON’S VIEW, 30 AUGUST 2002</p>
<p><b>201.  The British Embassy Washington reported that it would be very difficult for </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush to do nothing, but it was clear to the main players that they would </b></p>
<p><b>have to make a convincing case before going ahead with any action.</b></p>
<p><b>202. </b> Mr Brenton wrote to Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and North </p>
<p>Africa, to provide a “snapshot of the situation as it now looks here” for a meeting on Iraq </p>
<p>to be held on 30 August by Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS).</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>203. </b> Mr Brenton advised:</p>
<p>“The public debate … is now firmly engaged. We have seen contributions from </p>
<p>practically every prominent Republican … With the signal exceptions of </p>
<p>Scowcroft … and Zinni [General Anthony Zinni, former Commander in Chief </p>
<p>CENTCOM and US Special Envoy for Middle East Peace], virtually all have </p>
<p>endorsed the idea of military action, subject to various preliminaries (such as going </p>
<p>through the UN) to maximise international support. Cheney’s speech … has further </p>
<p>raised expectations of an early decision leading to military action.”</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Brenton described the key points under discussion as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a) <b>Whether to do it at all</b>: President Bush’s public position was that he would </p>
<p>“proceed ‘cautiously and deliberately’ with full consultations of Congress and </p>
<p>allies, and that a range of options remained open”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>b) <b>UN inspections</b>: Mr James Baker and others had “argued that the US must </p>
<p>go the UN route – demanding unfettered inspections (with the expectation, but </p>
<p>not certainty, that Saddam will refuse), and the right to take action to enforce </p>
<p>compliance, to maximise international support”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>c) <b>Consulting Congress</b>: The White House had “made it clear” that it saw “no </p>
<p>legal need to get Congressional support for military action … But, they have also </p>
<p>been briefing that there will be ‘full consultation’ and have not ruled out seeking </p>
<p>formal support … if the Administration made an effective case, Congress was </p>
<p>likely to support action.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Brenton suggested that a number of other considerations continued to weigh </p>
<p>heavily in the debate. Those were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “day after” question;</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact on the oil market; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s possible use of WMD.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Mr Brenton wrote that the relevance of the MEPP had not been as prominent </p>
<p>as might have been expected: “The hawks’ argument here, which has gained some </p>
<p>resonance, is that to postpone action until Arab/Israel improves is to postpone it </p>
<p>for ever.” </p>
<p><b>207. </b> Mr Brenton also wrote that US public opinion was “lukewarmly supportive of </p>
<p>action … Commentators believe that if a public case begins to be made that support will </p>
<p>firm up.”</p>
<p><b>208. </b> Mr Brenton concluded:</p>
<p>“… the hard questions are now … on the table and it is clear to the main players </p>
<p>that they are going to have to make a convincing case before going ahead with any </p>
<p>action. So far the absence of a political green light has hindered them in making that </p>
<p>case … The expectations that have now been generated will make it very difficult </p>
<p>for the President to do nothing (though this … does not mean that military action is </p>
<p>inevitable) … Even if concrete action … is still some way off, the Republicans would </p>
<p>far prefer an Autumn in which the press is dominated by Iraq headlines than one </p>
<p>where the economy is the lead story.”</p>
<p><b>209. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to a number of addressees, including </p>
<p>Sir David Manning. </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s decision to set out a public script on Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>210.  When Mr Blair returned to No.10 after his holiday, he set out his concerns </b></p>
<p><b>about the public debate, and that he and President Bush had been “outed” as </b></p>
<p><b>having decided on military action when no decisions had been taken. </b></p>
<p><b>211.  Mr Blair stated that the “strategy” should be aimed at answering the </b></p>
<p><b>questions of those who might support military action and, in doing so, set Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>in a bigger context.</b></p>
<p><b>212.  Mr Blair set out a series of steps to achieve that, including working for a new </b></p>
<p><b>UN Security Council resolution which would effectively become an ultimatum. </b></p>
<p><b>213.  Conflict would depend on the regime’s response, but Mr Blair did not think it </b></p>

<p><b>214. </b> As part of a wider note to No.10 officials on 30 August, Mr Blair set out his position </p>
<p>on Iraq: </p>
<p>“I don’t need any convincing as to where we are on this. The state of opinion, the </p>
<p>difficulties. The problems are compounded by the fact that [President] Bush and </p>
<p>myself have been ‘outed’ as having decided for war, come what may, when actually </p>

<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>no decisions have been taken. So the arguments are all being made against any </p>
<p>action, when we are not yet in a position to make the arguments for it. But all this </p>
<p>can be turned round in time, with the right strategy.</p>
<p>“My basic view on Iraq is clear and hard. The policy of containment … has worked </p>
<p>up to a point, but can’t continue indefinitely; there is no doubt that, uncontained, </p>
<p>Iraq is a threat; they are trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability; they are </p>
<p>developing ballistic missile capability for biological and chemical weapons of a </p>
<p>longer range; they retain substantial WMD stocks; the regime is deeply repugnant, </p>
<p>corrupt and repressive … The region, the world, the Iraqi people would be better off </p>
<p>without Saddam.</p>
<p>“Opinion against action divides into two: those always opposed and the usual </p>
<p>anti&#8209;American lobby; and those, a large number, who ask entirely sensible </p>
<p>questions, but who might support action if the questions were answered.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Blair stated: “The basic strategy should be to answer these questions and, </p>
<p>in doing so, set … Iraq in a bigger context.” The steps to do that were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Raising the whole issue of WMD up the agenda with a separate strategy </p>
<p>for each country developing WMD, “in particular [those] acquiring nuclear </p>
<p>technology in secret”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Setting out the “unique danger posed by Iraq … an inherently violent and </p>
<p>unstable regime, with a track record of external aggression, unmitigated by any </p>
<p>moderate elements unlike other WMD countries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Exposing and highlighting the “limits of the policy of containment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A strategy which “should be to work towards a new UN resolution on weapons </p>
<p>inspections, effectively becoming an ultimatum to Saddam. But it must be </p>
<p>unconditional access and change to the way the regime operates viz its military </p>
<p>capability. It will be clear that refusal or non&#8209;compliance will not be a subject </p>
<p>of negotiation but action. We need to begin the diplomatic work on this now. </p>
<p>Russia and my visit to Putin [Russian President, Mr Vladimir Putin] in October </p>
<p>will be crucial. Obviously – and this is the legitimate US worry – if we go the UN </p>
<p>route, Saddam may yield, agree and then play about. We need to be very clear </p>
<p>we won’t let that happen. But it does mean that conflict is dependent on the </p>
<p>regime’s response, not inevitable, though I don’t think it will be long before his </p>
<p>true intention is clear.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Building EU and Arab support for action “if the UN route does not deliver, ie we </p>
<p>say … we will try the UN route; but doing nothing is not an option”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working “strenuously to put together a new MEPP process. This is the key to </p>
<p>Arab opinion …”</p>

<p>Working on a post&#8209;Saddam Iraqi regime: “The conundrum is: if it is merely </p>
<p>changing Saddam for another military dictator, that hardly elicits support from </p>
<p>the rest of Iraq, especially the Shia majority, and is in any event, not in line with </p>
<p>our principles; on the other hand, if the whole nature of the regime changes, the </p>
<p>Sunni minority in power may be less tempted to fold and acquiesce in Saddam’s </p>
<p>removal. But there are ways through this.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[N]aturally” getting “detailed working on the military plan necessary to succeed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Developing a “proper media strategy” including “real information about life under </p>
<p>Saddam … The moral case for regime change should be made.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Addressing the “whole issue of the Muslim world and its relations with the West”.</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Blair wanted detailed work internally within the UK and with the US and </p>
<p>suggested: </p>
<p>“A small team under JS [Jack Straw] and DM [David Manning] should meet and </p>
<p>coordinate. </p>
<p>“If I go to the US in the next couple of weeks, the idea should be to agree the </p>
<p>strategy with GWB [President Bush], set it out at the TUC [Trades Union Congress] </p>
<p>or shortly after and then get going.”</p>
<p><b>217. </b> In his memoir Mr Blair wrote that he had returned from holiday with his “lines </p>
<p>clear”. He:</p>
<p>“… was going to be very tough: we had to deal with Saddam; it was right to do it; we </p>
<p>had to send an unvarnished and plain message on WMD to the world.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>218.  Mr Blair was concerned about the effect that press speculation, that he was </b></p>
<p><b>seeking to influence the US, would have on President Bush. </b></p>
<p><b>219.  Initially Mr Blair’s instinct was to reiterate the lines he had been using earlier </b></p>
<p><b>in the year, but he quickly decided to use a press conference on 3 September to </b></p>
<p><b>set out a public script on Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>220. </b> Mr Campbell wrote to Mr Blair on 30 August to warn him that during the flight </p>
<p>to a Sustainable Development Summit in Johannesburg the following day, the press </p>
<p>would be pushing him on Iraq.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> Mr Campbell recommended a statement with the top </p>

<p><b>221. </b> Mr Campbell recorded in his diary that Mr Blair wanted to “avoid” talking about </p>
<p>Iraq; and that he would use the line that doing nothing was not an option “if pushed”, </p>
<p>but he did not want to go beyond that.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair was:</p>
<p>“Privately … growing more and more dismissive of the critics … Equally he was </p>
<p>clear that the Yanks had not handled it well over the holiday … [T]hey had allowed </p>
<p>the game to run ahead of them, and Cheney and Rumsfeld had just made it worse.</p>
<p>“… He was a lot steelier than when he went on holiday. Clear that getting Saddam </p>
<p>was the right thing to do …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“David had got Condi to get GWB to offer TB next Saturday for a meeting in the </p>
<p>margins of his so&#8209;called war counsel [sic]. I think they realised that they had messed </p>
<p>up the presentation and had to get into a better position, so it seemed clear Bush </p>
<p>did want TB there, but heaven knows what Cheney and Rumsfeld would make of it. </p>
<p>TB was up for it.” </p>
<p><b>223. </b> In response to an article in the <i>Financial Times</i> of 31 August, reporting that Mr Blair </p>
<p>had pressed President Bush for a UN mandate, Mr Campbell wrote in his diary on </p>
<p>1 September:</p>
<p>“Iraq was becoming a frenzy again. TB was becoming more and more belligerent, </p>
<p>saying he knew it was the right thing to do … Obviously the best thing to do would </p>
<p>be to avoid war, get the inspectors in and all the weapons out … the US had to </p>
<p>be managed into a better position … but we won’t be able to do it if we come out </p>
<p>against the US the whole time … Equally it was clear that public opinion had moved </p>
<p>against us during August.”</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>224. </b> On 2 September Mr Campbell wrote to Sir David Manning, and to Mr Powell and </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft, saying that Mr Blair was “alarmed, and angry, at the way parts of our thinking </p>
<p>and planning on Iraq are seeping into the media in an unco&#8209;ordinated and undisciplined </p>
<p>way”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> “Above all”, Mr Blair was “concerned what the US Administration must think”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair intended to use his press conference the following day (in his Sedgefield </p>
<p>constituency) to make the general position clear and “give people a public script”. </p>
<p>But more must be done “to ensure people do not depart from that, publicly or privately, </p>
<p>or give a running commentary in every aspect of his thinking”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that he left it to Sir David and Mr Powell to decide what to do </p>
<p>with his minute, “but it might be worth sending round as a general message that if people </p>
<p>are talking loosely … they are being foolish and risk being highly counter&#8209;productive”. </p>
<p><b>226. </b> Mr Powell commented on the manuscript: “David [Manning] will speak to </p>
<p>the FCO.”</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Sir David Manning discussed the issue with Dr Rice on both 1 and 2 September.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> There is no record of the first conversation although it was a difficult one which </p>
<p>Sir David had reported orally to Mr Blair. He described the second conversation as </p>
<p>“much easier” and “a great deal better than it might have been”. Sir David said he had </p>
<p>told Dr Rice that Mr Blair was “angry at the way the British press were covering the Iraq </p>
<p>issue”, and that “We were doing all we could to ensure that there were no leaks at our </p>
<p>end.” Mr Blair “had given fierce instructions”. Sir David suggested that the coverage </p>
<p>“was probably the result of speculation, lucky hits, and people driving their own agenda”.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that Mr Blair would deal with Iraq at his press conference the </p>
<p>following day. Mr Blair would “dismiss all suggestions” that he was “trying to pressure </p>
<p>the US”. There was “no lack of consultation” and Mr Blair would not “want to pressure </p>
<p>the President” because he “believed very strongly that Saddam must be dealt with”. </p>
<p>“However difficult, we had to face up to the problem and to the wider problem of WMD.” </p>
<p>Mr Blair and President Bush “might get together at some point if you both felt that was </p>
<p>useful”. Sir David reported that Dr Rice was content with that line.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> Sir David Manning also reported that he and Dr Rice had discussed elements of a </p>
<p>“very tough” resolution, including a stipulation that the UN inspectors would have force </p>
<p>protection and the possibility of “external back up” provided by larger military forces in </p>
<p>a number of neighbouring countries who would invade Iraq if Saddam tried to obstruct </p>
<p>the work of UNMOVIC. The assumption was that the resolution should be tabled two or </p>
<p>three days after President Bush’s speech on 12 September. Sir David added: “With luck, </p>
<p>we may be over the worst. Your [Mr Blair’s] press conference tomorrow will obviously </p>
<p>be important.”</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair was “livid” about the stories in the media and had </p>
<p>spoken to Mr Powell and Sir David Manning “saying that he wanted message round the </p>
<p>system that all this loose talk had to stop. And he wanted the Americans to know how </p>
<p>angry he was”.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>232. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that Dr Rice had “said it looked like we were trying to push </p>
<p>them, and they didn’t like it”. He added that Dr Rice liked the argument that the UN was </p>
<p>the route to deal with Iraq, not the route to avoid it. </p>

<p><b>233.  The FCO was concerned that Mr Blair should strike a balance between </b></p>
<p><b>acknowledging the deficiencies of the policy of containment without saying </b></p>
<p><b>it had failed.</b></p>
<p><b>234. </b> In preparation for his press conference in Sedgefield, Mr Blair asked for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a summary of “what we knew of the existing Iraqi WMD programme, in particular </p>
<p>ballistic missile technology (and its significance); and nuclear weapons </p>
<p>technology (including why the civil nuclear programmes they are funding is </p>
<p>almost certainly misused for weapons programmes)”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “list of Saddam Hussein’s atrocities”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “rough summary” of statistics showing the brutality of political repression;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>information on the “sanctions programme and containment” telling him “why the </p>
<p>policy of containment cannot continue indefinitely”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>information on the extent to which Saddam Hussein’s refusal to use the </p>
<p>Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food programme properly was harming the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Advice was provided by Mr Straw’s Private Office on 2 September.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>236. </b> Mr Charles Gray, Head of the FCO Middle East Department, explained to </p>
<p>Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director:</p>
<p>“The difficulty lies in providing No.10 with language which will adequately bring out </p>
<p>the deficiencies in our present policy and show that there is a need to move beyond </p>
<p>it, without suggesting that it has been a total failure (which, for the reasons set out in </p>
<p>the first version … we do not believe to be the case). And I also see a presentational </p>
<p>risk that if we do not in the end go hard over on a policy of military action, and [we] </p>
<p>have already said categorically that containment has failed, we shall be setting </p>
<p>ourselves up for accusations that we are then left with no policy at all.</p>
<p>“So rather than tie us down to pursuing an alternative to containment immediately, </p>
<p>the language … seeks to demonstrate why the present state of affairs cannot </p>
<p>continue indefinitely, thus leaving us with some flexibility on the timing of any </p>
<p>other action.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>237. </b> As well as the briefing note, Mr Rycroft was sent a “blind copy” of Mr Gray’s </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>238. </b> The brief for Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The purpose of the policy had been to ensure that Iraq was disarmed through </p>
<p>two main elements: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>disarmament through inspections regimes; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>reducing Iraq’s ability to finance its WMD programmes by controlling its </p>
<p>revenues from oil.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The policy had had “some success in dismantling Saddam’s arsenal when the </p>
<p>inspectors were able to operate”, and it had “slowed his efforts to rebuild WMD”. </p>
<p>The arms embargo had “been effective in preventing Saddam acquiring new </p>
<p>complete weapons systems”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But, “in the absence of inspectors” Iraq could “work on its WMD programmes </p>
<p>unimpeded” and Iraq was “in violation of a string of Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>intended to curb” those programmes. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Controls on revenues were “eroding”, giving Saddam Hussein “access to large </p>
<p>sums over which the international community had no control” and “much” of that </p>
<p>was “certainly going into his high&#8209;priority WMD programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although the sanctions regime had been “targeted on goods of most concern”, </p>
<p>no sanctions regime would “be completely effective in stopping a ruthless and </p>
<p>well&#8209;funded regime getting its hands on some of the goods and technology </p>
<p>needed for a WMD programme”. </p>
<p><b>239. </b> The FCO response to Mr Blair’s questions on Iraq’s WMD, which stated </p>
<p>unequivocally that Iraq had and was hiding WMD and that it had continued its </p>
<p>chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile programmes after the departure of the </p>
<p>UN weapons inspectors in 1998, is addressed in Section 4.2 </p>
<p><b>The Sedgefield press conference, 3 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>240.  In his press conference, Mr Blair stated that Saddam Hussein was, “without </b></p>
<p><b>any question, still trying to develop” a “chemical, biological, potentially nuclear </b></p>
<p><b>capability”; and that to allow him to do so would be “irresponsible”.</b></p>
<p><b>241.  As he had discussed with President Bush, Mr Blair framed Iraq’s position as </b></p>
<p><b>a challenge to the UN which the UN should address.</b></p>
<p><b>242.  Mr Blair’s remarks indicated that time and patience were running out and that </b></p>
<p><b>there were difficulties with the existing policy of containment.</b></p>
<p><b>243.  Mr Blair announced that the “dossier” setting out the evidence of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>attempts to develop its “chemical, biological and potentially nuclear capability” </b></p>
<p><b>would be published in the “next few weeks”.</b></p>
<p><b>244.  Mr Campbell wrote that the hardest question to answer was “Why now?”</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>245. </b> In his press conference, which lasted 90 minutes, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… I think I would be right in saying that many of your questions will be on Iraq … </p>
<p>I sense that some of you believe we have taken all the key decisions but just haven’t </p>
<p>got round to telling you. That isn’t the case … We, at every level of government, </p>
<p>have been and remain in close dialogue with the United States of America about this </p>
<p>issue and where we are in absolute agreement is that Iraq poses a real and unique </p>
<p>threat to the security of the region and the rest of the world. But Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>is continuing in his efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction … We have to </p>
<p>face up to it, we have to deal with it and will. The issue is then what is the best way </p>
<p>of proceeding.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr Blair emphasised the importance of the “broadest possible basis of support”; </p>
<p>and that “because this is a problem for the world … the United Nations has to be the </p>
<p>route to deal with this problem, not a way of people avoiding dealing with this problem”. </p>
<p><b>247. </b> Explaining his support for the US, Mr Blair stated: “For a long period of time we </p>
<p>have done our best to contain that threat, though it is increasingly difficult to do without </p>
<p>inspectors being back in there with a proper regime on the ground which alters the </p>
<p>way the [Iraqi] regime behaves.” The US was “right” to raise the issue and supporting </p>
<p>them was not a question of “misplaced allegiance or blind loyalty”; it was the “right </p>
<p>thing to do”. </p>
<p><b>248. </b> Mr Blair stated that the policy of containment of Saddam Hussein had “worked up </p>
<p>to a point, but there is a point beyond which it hasn’t worked because the inspectors </p>
<p>aren’t in, we don’t really know what is happening now”. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Mr Blair said: “I think I am right in saying that a couple of years ago we reckoned </p>
<p>there was somewhere in the region of $1.8 billion of illicit money coming to the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime, we think it is probably $3 billion … now”. </p>
<p><b>250. </b> Mr Blair also drew attention to Saddam Hussein’s human rights record and the </p>
<p>“thousands … of refugees flooding across Europe”. </p>
<p><b>251. </b> Referring to US concerns about Saddam Hussein’s past record of obstructing </p>
<p>inspections and the need to follow through on any resolution, Mr Blair concluded: </p>
<p>“… is there a threat we can simply turn a blind eye to, despite the breach of all the </p>
<p>UN resolutions. If the answer to that is no, we have to deal with it, then let’s work </p>
<p>out the right way of dealing with it. But it is perfectly understandable if in the light of </p>
<p>previous experience, that people will look with a very sceptical eye as to whether </p>
<p>any regime could be successful, but that is not to dismiss it.” </p>
<p><b>252. </b> A number of questioners pointed out that public opinion had moved against the </p>
<p>idea of a strike against Iraq “partly because people feel that there hasn’t been much </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>evidence … We have heard again and again that there is a dossier of evidence about </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction. Why haven’t we got it up to now and </p>
<p>when are we going to see it?” Would there be any evidence in the dossier which had </p>
<p>been “gleaned in the last four years” that Saddam Hussein had “moved any further down </p>
<p>the route to nuclear weapons”? There were suggestions that there was “not going to be </p>
<p>much new”; and that, in terms of public opinion, there was “a mountain to climb”. </p>
<p><b>253. </b> In response to the first question Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Originally I had the intention that we wouldn’t get round to publishing the dossier </p>
<p>until we’d actually taken the key decisions. I think it is probably a better idea to bring </p>
<p>that forward.” </p>
<p><b>254. </b> Mr Blair added: “A lot of the work has already been done, there needs to be some </p>
<p>more work and some more checking” but “the best thing to do is to publish … within the </p>
<p>next few weeks”. When that happened:</p>
<p>“… people will see that there is no doubt at all the United Nations resolutions that </p>
<p>Saddam is in breach of are there for a purpose. He [Saddam Hussein] is without any </p>
<p>question, still trying to develop that chemical, biological, potentially nuclear capability </p>
<p>and to allow him to do so without any let or hindrance, just to say, we [sic] can carry </p>
<p>on and do it, I think would be irresponsible.” </p>
<p><b>255. </b> In terms of the specifics of Iraq’s WMD Mr Blair made a number of comments </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… there is no doubt that at some point the Iraqi regime were trying to develop </p>
<p>nuclear weapons … I believe that there is evidence that they will acquire nuclear </p>
<p>weapons capability if they possibly can.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Now we will provide what support we can for that, although of course the </p>
<p>absence of inspectors … means there is necessarily a limit. But I don’t think </p>
<p>we should be in any doubt about the nature of this regime, they will acquire </p>
<p>whatever weapons they possibly can.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Certainly they were trying to obtain a nuclear weapons capability. I think there is </p>
<p>some evidence that they continued to do so.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we don’t really know what is happening now, there are huge amounts of </p>
<p>stocks of chemical, biological weapons unaccounted for.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we can’t be quite sure what is happening on the nuclear side … but on the </p>
<p>biological and chemical weapons side there is no doubt about it, there are vast </p>
<p>stocks of these weapons unaccounted for by the previous weapons inspectors.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“And in addition there is real concern that there is ballistic missile technology.”</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the reason Iraq might not be letting inspections take place </p>
<p>was because “the last time the inspectors were in there, they uncovered so much that </p>

<p>the Iraqi regime was deeply embarrassed”. He also argued that people would “think </p>
<p>about it differently once they see the evidence”.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diary on 3 September:</p>
<p>“The hardest [question] was: ‘Why now? What was it that we knew now that we </p>
<p>didn’t before that made us believe we had to do it now?’ It was not going to be at all </p>
<p>easy to sell the policy in the next few months …”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>258. </b> Mr Campbell added that announcing the publication of the dossier would “raise </p>
<p>expectations massively. Today was about beginning to turn the tide of public opinion and </p>
<p>it was going to be very tough indeed.”</p>
<p><b>259. </b> Mr Campbell told the Inquiry that the decision to bring forward the publication of </p>
<p>the dossier was a way of trying to calm the situation.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> Mr Blair had wanted “to set out </p>

<p><b>263. </b> The Key Judgements<i> </i>were: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is successful in manipulating its trade relations to obtain diplomatic support </p>
<p>from other countries. It will continue to do so. The weakness of the economies </p>
<p>of many of Iraq’s neighbours means they will continue to be susceptible to Iraqi </p>
<p>pressure through the offer of lucrative trading opportunities.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s ability to use cuts in oil supply or threats of such disruption to cause spikes </p>
<p>to world energy market prices is likely to be temporary and limited by the extent </p>
<p>to which Saudi oil production can make good any loss of Iraqi supplies.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq uses economic levers to put political pressure on Russia for support, whilst </p>
<p>Russia sees its political importance to Iraq as a means to extract economic </p>
<p>benefit. But Russia remains the dominant partner. At present Russia is able to </p>
<p>exercise the greater leverage.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russian policy on Iraq will continue to be heavily influenced by its determination </p>
<p>to protect its economic interests. The status quo provides the benefit of a </p>
<p>privileged commercial position; but contracts which can only be realised after </p>
<p>sanctions are lifted may not be honoured by a post&#8209;Saddam regime.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s use of trade to further its political influence will be limited in future by its </p>
<p>inability to significantly expand oil production.”</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Other points from the Assessment are set out in the Box below. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 3 September 2002: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraqi Trade: A Tool of Influence’</b></p>
<p>The Assessment concluded that Iraq deliberately used “<b>trade with other countries as </b></p>
<p><b>one way to achieve strategic goals</b>”.</p>
<p>“It had worked hard to build up trading relations, legal and otherwise, both with its </p>
<p>neighbours and influential countries on the UNSC. <b>The granting of future oil/gas </b></p>
<p><b>extraction rights for the post&#8209;sanctions period is also a source of leverage.</b>” </p>
<p>In addition, “<b>Iraq manipulates OFF contracts to obtain political support from other </b></p>
<p><b>countries.</b>” The lifting of the ceiling on OFF contracts in 1999 had “increased Iraq’s power </p>
<p>of patronage significantly”. Iraq had “used the OFF programme to divert funds illegally to </p>
<p>Baghdad using a number of schemes, the most important being a 10 percent commission </p>
<p>on all OFF contracts for goods coming into Iraq and the imposition of a surcharge on </p>
<p>exports of its oil”.</p>
<p>Iraq was also pursuing illegal trade which was described as “typically” involving “the </p>
<p>transfer of Iraqi oil at below world prices”. That gave the Iraqi regime “direct access to </p>
<p>foreign currency” and allowed it “to procure goods prohibited by the UN from countries, </p>
<p>firms and individuals willing to break sanctions”.</p>
<p>The JIC assessed that Jordan and Syria were the two countries most dependent on Iraqi </p>
<p>trade. For Jordan OFF and other trade with Iraq accounted for “about 20 percent” of its </p>
<p>GDP; Syrian trade with Iraq was estimated to account for about 10 percent of its GDP, </p>
<p>not including earnings of firms and individuals who dealt with Baghdad directly or some </p>
<p>revenues derived from the use of Syria as a major transit route for illegal Iraqi trade. Illegal </p>
<p>oil exports from Iraq through a pipeline with Syria began in 2000. Syria was the largest </p>
<p>purchaser of illegal Iraqi oil which it used for domestic consumption allowing it to increase </p>
<p>exports of its own oil.</p>
<p>With Egypt, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates, trade was “relatively significant”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>The JIC set out the scale of Russia’s economic interests in Iraq, including expected </p>
<p>earnings of US$2.5bn in 2002 from OFF contracts; contracts to develop Iraq’s oil and gas </p>
<p>fields; and a five year trade agreement. Moscow was also concerned about recovering </p>
<p>outstanding debt of at least US$8bn.</p>
<p>Iraq used its economic relationship with Russia to put pressure on Russia, including to </p>
<p>engage in illegal trade which the Russian Government had resisted. Iraqi bribes paid </p>
<p>to Russian officials, businessmen and politicians and oil industry lobbyists had helped </p>
<p>“nurture an influential pro&#8209;Iraqi lobby in Russia”.</p>
<p>Russian policy was “<b>to hope for the best and plan for the worst – so far as its </b></p>
<p><b>economic interests are concerned</b>”. Russia might see the “<b>deals it has signed with </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq as a card to negotiate some form of compensation should the current regime </b></p>
<p><b>be toppled by the US</b>”. It was “hoping to maintain and possibly expand its current trading </p>
<p>position”. </p>
<p>Russia wanted “to maintain good relations with the US while at the same time opposing an </p>
<p>attack on Iraq”. It was “becoming increasingly irritated by Iraq’s refusal to allow the return </p>
<p>of UN inspectors”, which Russia saw as “the best way to avoid a conflict in Iraq and get </p>
<p>sanctions lifted”. </p>
<p><b>US agreement to pursue “the UN route”</b></p>
<p><b>265. </b> In a meeting on 3 September, Mr Blair told Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary&#8209;</p>
<p>General, that:</p>
<p>“… Iraq needed to know that they had to let the inspectors back in and that, if they </p>
<p>refused, the US would not ignore it. The President was under pressure not to go </p>
<p>down the UN route and it was important that the international community stood </p>
<p>ready to support him if he did.”</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Annan stated that he had been informed earlier in the year that it was thought </p>
<p>Iraq would comply and let the inspectors back in.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Dr Rice telephoned Sir David Manning after the Sedgefield press conference to </p>
<p>discuss the arrangements for Mr Blair and President Bush to meet at Camp David and </p>
<p>develop US thinking on what the resolution should contain.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>268. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that he had “assumed we would need to table a </p>
<p>very tough initial draft that included negotiating fat that could be conceded”. Some of the </p>
<p>elements Dr Rice had outlined would be a “tough sell” and “we might have … to modify </p>
<p>these demands to get the resolution through”. Sir David said he would get back to </p>
<p>Dr Rice “when our experts had thought the issues through”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Outside No.10, only Mr Straw was sent a personal copy of the record of that </p>
<p>discussion. </p>
<p><b>270.  Mr Blair and President Bush agreed they should meet on 7 September to </b></p>
<p><b>discuss Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>271.  President Bush announced the meeting on 4 September, as part of wider </b></p>
<p><b>remarks about his determination to disarm Iraq about which he would also be </b></p>
<p><b>consulting Congress and other world leaders.</b></p>
<p><b>272. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair spoke later on 3 September.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> They discussed </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s press conference and Mr Blair said he was confident that a very strong case </p>
<p>could be made against Saddam Hussein. Mr Blair’s visit to the US would be announced </p>
<p>the next day. It would follow a US National Security Council meeting on 7 September </p>
<p>and precede President Bush’s speech to the UN on 12 September. They would also </p>
<p>discuss the handling of the UK dossier. </p>
<p><b>273. </b> On 4 September, in a press opportunity after a meeting with Congressional </p>
<p>leaders in the White House to discuss foreign policy, President Bush stated that they </p>
<p>had spent most of their time “talking about a serious threat to the United States” and to </p>
<p>the world from Saddam Hussein. Doing nothing about that threat was “not an option”.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He “looked forward to an open dialogue with Congress and the American people”. </p>
<p>The Administration would “participate fully in any hearings” that Congress wished to </p>
<p>hold, and “at the appropriate time” he would seek Congressional approval to “deal with </p>
<p>the threat”.</p>
<p><b>274. </b> President Bush also announced that he had asked Mr Blair to “come to Camp </p>
<p>David on Saturday” where they would discuss “mutual concerns about how to make the </p>
<p>world more secure and safe”. President Bush said that he would also speak to other </p>
<p>world leaders, including those of China, France and Russia, before giving his speech at </p>
<p>the UN General Assembly in New York the following week. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> Asked whether putting weapons inspectors back into Iraq was a viable option, </p>
<p>President Bush replied that the issue was disarmament not inspectors. That was the </p>
<p>primary issue and he would be discussing “ways to make sure that that is the case”. </p>
<p>In response to a subsequent question, President Bush added that he would be calling </p>
<p>“on the world to recognize that he [Saddam]” was “stiffing the world”; and discussing </p>
<p>“ways to make sure that he fulfils his obligations”. </p>

<p><b>276. </b> Asked whether the time had come to issue an ultimatum “similar to that you issued </p>
<p>to the Taliban [in October 2001 – see Section 3.1]”, President Bush replied:</p>
<p>“I am going to state clearly to the United Nations what I think … he [Saddam] has not </p>
<p>fulfilled any of the obligations that he made to the world. And I believe it is important </p>
<p>for the world to deal with this man. And I believe it is really important for the world to </p>

<p>the Speaker of the House of Representatives, during the meeting on 4 September.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The letter stated: </p>
<p>“America and the civilised world face a critical decision in the months ahead. The </p>
<p>decision is how to disarm an outlaw regime that continues to possess and develop </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction … Since September 11, we have been reminded that </p>
<p>we are vulnerable to evil people. And this vulnerability increases dramatically when </p>
<p>evil people have access to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>“I know Members of Congress agree that Saddam Hussein’s regime is still a threat </p>
<p>to peace … America intends to lead the way to make certain that Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>regime is not able to threaten anyone in the world with the world’s most devastating </p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>“I am in the process of deciding how to proceed. This is an important decision that </p>
<p>must be made with great thought and care. Therefore I welcome and encourage </p>
<p>discussion and debate. Congress will hold hearings on Iraq this month, and I have </p>
<p>asked members of my Administration to participate fully.</p>
<p>“Doing nothing in the face of a grave threat to the world is not an option. At an </p>
<p>appropriate time and after consultation with the leadership, I will seek Congressional </p>
<p>support for US action to do whatever is necessary to deal with the threat posed </p>
<p>by Saddam Hussein’s regime. Congress can play an important role in building a </p>
<p>national consensus for action.”</p>
<p><b>278. </b> After a reference to meeting Mr Blair and consulting other world leaders, the letter </p>
<p>continued:</p>
<p>“My Administration remains committed to the regime change policy enshrined in the </p>

<p><b>Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s advice, 3 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>279.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised on 3 September that none of the options </b></p>
<p><b>identified by the FCO for a draft resolution, giving Iraq an ultimatum which might </b></p>
<p><b>then provide legal cover for military action, would be achievable. Even a challenge </b></p>
<p><b>to Iraq to accept UN inspections would face “considerable opposition”.</b></p>
<p><b>280.  Sir Jeremy advised that the UK should focus on the elimination of WMD </b></p>
<p><b>rather than regime change, and choose its tactics “with circumspection”. </b></p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Blair had concluded on 30 August that the UK strategy should be a new UN </p>
<p>resolution which would become an ultimatum to Iraq.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Sir Michael Jay had asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock for his “considered advice </p>
<p>on the handling of a Security Council resolution on Iraq in preparation for the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s visit to Camp David at the end of the week”.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Sir Jeremy replied to Sir Michael on 3 September addressing a draft FCO letter to </p>
<p>No.10 provided by Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of UN Department in the FCO, “on the </p>
<p>options for Security Council Resolutions aimed at putting pressure on Iraq and preparing </p>
<p>the ground for enforcement action”. </p>
<p><b>284. </b> Sir Jeremy described the FCO draft as raising three possibilities: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a resolution “specifically authorising the use of force”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “softer text determining a flagrant violation or material breach by Iraq of </p>
<p>previous SCRs”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “middle&#8209;ground resolution aimed at provoking an indisputable example of Iraqi </p>
<p>intransigence by calling for the re&#8209;admission of Inspectors with a tight timetable </p>
<p>and more intrusive powers”.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that none of those options was yet achievable and only the </p>
<p>second was “likely to stand much chance of success after further work”. He wrote:</p>
<p>“We start from a point where the other 13 members of the Council will, at best, </p>
<p>have serious doubts about the use of force. Despite the attractions from our and </p>
<p>the US perspective of a clear and ‘in your face’ justification for the use of force, </p>
<p>there is bound to be strong resistance to this in the Council. Nor would we have </p>
<p>the necessary nine votes for an explicit pre&#8209;authorisation in the event of continued </p>
<p>Iraqi non&#8209;compliance. There will even be considerable opposition to throwing down </p>

<p>the gauntlet to Saddam by challenging him to accept UN Inspectors under tight </p>
<p>conditions. […] introducing force protection for UNMOVIC is simply unachievable, </p>
<p>even if UNMOVIC decided to ask for it. The majority of the Council members will see </p>
<p>any attempt to ratchet up the requirements on Iraq as a device to create a pretext for </p>
<p>military action rather than an effort to get verification and inspection under way. And </p>
<p>trying and failing to obtain this sort of language would be worse than not trying at all </p>
<p>because it would create a presumption of further Council discussion and decision </p>
<p>before military action could start.”</p>
<p><b>286. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that the UK should be:</p>
<p>“… focusing our presentation as much as possible on WMD elimination rather than </p>
<p>regime change, and … choosing our Security Council tactics with circumspection. </p>
<p>On the assumption that our first requirement is to secure legal cover for military </p>
<p>intervention if the UN route fails, our priority should be to reactivate SCRs 678 </p>
<p>and 687. The Attorney General will need to give a view on the best way to make this </p>
<p>legally watertight, but to be politically effective we would need to secure more than </p>
<p>the minimum nine votes necessary.”</p>
<p><b>287. </b> In that context, Sir Jeremy wrote:</p>
<p>“… Ideally this [the text of an ultimatum resolution] should include ‘material breach’ </p>
<p>(rather than ‘flagrant violation’) language and be under Chapter VII of the Charter. </p>
<p>But, subject to the Attorney General’s views, I do not think that either Chapter VII </p>
<p>or an explicit ultimatum is necessary to secure the legal cover we need. […] … in </p>
<p>my view [we] should be very cautious about spelling out an ultimatum, which could </p>
<p>easily be used by others to argue for a further Council decision before military action </p>
<p>is launched. Our real objective in a resolution should be to achieve the minimum </p>
<p>language necessary to justify the use of force (without a further SCR) without striving </p>
<p>for extra bells and feathers …</p>
<p>“We may need to discuss later how to handle Iraqi reaction to a successful </p>
<p>resolution. Actually getting inspectors back in would change the picture.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Mr Blair replied “? why not? – sounds right to me except possibly it may be </p>
<p>possible to get a middle ground resolution.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>FCO advice, 4 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>291.  The FCO advice to No.10 on 4 September reflected Sir Jeremy’s view that </b></p>
<p><b>it would be difficult to negotiate any resolution which implicitly or explicitly </b></p>
<p><b>authorised the use of force without clear Iraqi provocation to provide a “trigger”.</b></p>
<p><b>292. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office sent advice to No.10 on 4 September on a “wider </p>
<p>range of possible UNSCRs and a game&#8209;plan for securing them”, drawing attention </p>
<p>to Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s advice in his letter of 3 September.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> The letter to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning made clear that Mr Straw had not seen the advice. </p>
<p><b>293. </b> The FCO set out three possible approaches, but made no recommendation. </p>
<p>First<b>, a resolution specifically authorising the use of force: </b>affirming that Iraq had </p>
<p>“ignored” the UN’s demands and failed to comply with relevant resolutions; confirming </p>
<p>that Iraq’s behaviour, and in particular its possession of WMD, “constituted a threat to </p>
<p>international peace and security”; and authorising a “coalition of the willing to take ‘all </p>
<p>necessary measures’ to ensure Iraq’s compliance with the UN’s demands”. </p>
<p><b>294. </b> Such a resolution would “provide an unambiguous justification for the use of force” </p>
<p>but it would be “immensely difficult to negotiate” and the prospects would improve “only </p>
<p>if there were a recent and flagrant example of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance”.</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Secondly, <b>a resolution determining that Iraq’s failure to co&#8209;operate with </b></p>
<p><b>“UNMOVIC etc” constituted a flagrant violation or material breach of previous </b></p>
<p><b>resolutions: </b>with a call for Iraq to co&#8209;operate fully and possibly a timed ultimatum </p>
<p>“though the warning to Iraq would be implicit without it”. </p>
<p><b>296. </b> In the FCO view “such a resolution could be argued to provide sufficient grounds </p>
<p>for the use of force … on the [grounds] that it revived the authorisation … in [resolution] </p>
<p>687”. That would “undoubtedly be easier for some UNSC members to support than one </p>
<p>which explicitly authorised all necessary measures, although many would recognise it for </p>
<p>what it is, and take up positions accordingly”.</p>

<p><b>298. </b> The FCO advised that, in that eventuality: “It would obviously be preferable to have </p>
<p>automatic authorisation of the use of force” but the Russians and others were “likely to </p>
<p>insist on a separate decision”. Armed support for UNMOVIC “would be very difficult, if </p>
<p>not impossible to negotiate”. </p>
<p><b>299. </b> Such a resolution would “demonstrate … willingness to give Iraq one last chance. </p>
<p>But there would be pressure … to keep to the timetable outlined in … [resolution] 1284, </p>
<p>which gave UNMOVIC months rather than weeks to report full Iraqi compliance.” There </p>
<p>would also have to be tight criteria for determining whether Iraq was co&#8209;operating “to </p>
<p>ensure that there would be no return to Iraq playing cat and mouse with UNMOVIC”. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> The FCO judged that the UK would be “unlikely to secure language which provided </p>
<p>a clear justification for future military action without further recourse to the UNSC”. It also </p>
<p>pointed out that, “A failed attempt in this area would be damaging. For this reason, it </p>
<p>would be wise not to go for the hardest option.” </p>
<p><b>301. </b> Reviewing the “Prospects and Pitfalls” of action, the FCO concluded that it would </p>
<p>be “difficult to negotiate any resolution which implicitly or explicitly authorises the use of </p>
<p>force without clear Iraqi provocation”. It identified the Russian attitude as “pivotal”; and </p>
<p>argued that China and other Security Council members would be nervous of setting a </p>
<p>precedent for “what may look like regime change”. </p>
<p><b>302. </b> The FCO also addressed the need for a trigger to support a resolution authorising </p>
<p>the use of force:</p>
<p>“The best trigger would be if Iraq were to be caught out taking action in clear </p>
<p>violation of UN Security Council demands. For example, if we were to get new </p>
<p>evidence of an egregious attempt by Iraq to rebuild its WMD programme … But it is </p>
<p>unlikely that Iraq will play into our hands in this way. </p>
<p>“The next best trigger would be to adopt a resolution demanding more intrusive </p>
<p>inspections … in the expectation that Iraq would not co&#8209;operate … Iraq’s refusal </p>
<p>to let UNMOVIC in or a subsequent report from UNMOVIC of Iraq’s failure to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate would suffice.</p>
<p>“Even without a specific trigger … we might argue that the UNSC’s patience had run </p>
<p>out … the first anniversary of … resolution [1382] (on 29 November [2002]) might be </p>
<p>a useful opportunity to focus minds.”</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Addressing an ultimatum the FCO advised:</p>
<p>“Various types of ultimatum are possible. They would need to be linked to demands </p>
<p>for the re&#8209;admission of inspectors, and Iraqi co&#8209;operation … Some options would </p>
<p>include deadlines … but … in the absence of … Iraqi move[s] to comply within a </p>
<p>reasonable (but short) period, they would be in clear violation.”</p>

<p><b>Attack in Iraq, 5 September</b></p>
<p>In response to hostile acts against coalition aircraft monitoring the southern No&#8209;Fly Zone, </p>
<p>US aircraft, with UK aircraft in support, attacked an Iraqi air defence facility in western Iraq </p>
<p>on 5 September 2002, prompting press speculation that it was a prelude to Special Forces </p>
<p>attacks and more general military action.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Amre Moussa, Secretary General of the Arab League, told a press conference in </p>
<p>Cairo on 5 September that any attack would cause major instability in the region.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>press also reported Arab foreign ministers had said that military action to topple Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would “open the gates of hell” and that no Arab countries would join it.</p>
<p><b>FCO advice, 6 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>305.  Mr Straw had a different perspective. He advised that the UK should seek a </b></p>
<p><b>resolution that simply determined that Iraq’s failure to co&#8209;operate constituted a </b></p>
<p><b>breach of its obligations and set an ultimatum for the readmission of inspectors </b></p>
<p><b>on the basis of the provisions in resolution 1284. </b></p>
<p><b>306. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10 on 6 September offering “elements” </p>
<p>for a possible resolution “authorising a tougher mandate and enforcement powers for </p>
<p>UNMOVIC inspectors in Iraq” and a draft resolution taking a different approach.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>307. </b> The first draft resolution made clear that “Iraq would be obliged to grant inspectors </p>
<p>immediate access to any sites, records or officials as requested”; with the “provision of </p>
<p>armed guards to accompany UNMOVIC” and authorisation for “a standby force to assist </p>
<p>UNMOVIC obtain Iraqi compliance if necessary”. The FCO stated that it had assumed </p>
<p>military operations would be run by a “coalition of the willing led by the US”, not run </p>
<p>by the UN. </p>
<p><b>308. </b> The FCO advised that there would be “strong pressure” from members of the </p>
<p>Security Council “to be consulted again before military action” commenced. The draft </p>
<p>aimed “high” by “including various formulae designed to obtain prior UNSC authority </p>
<p>or at least approval in principle, for any enforcement action”. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> The timetable in the draft resolution was “modelled on the arrangements envisaged </p>

<p>account of Dr Blix’s views. </p>
<p><b>310. </b> The draft included only an implicit reference to regime change; “the market will </p>
<p>bear no more”. </p>
<p><b>311. </b> The draft “also included requirements for Iraq to allow access to humanitarian </p>
<p>agencies, and for other UN members to co&#8209;operate by providing assistance to the </p>

<p><b>312. </b> The second draft resolution reflected Mr Straw’s amendments to a draft letter to </p>

<p>options were “too ‘in your face’ at present”.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>313. </b> While Mr Straw recognised “the importance of engaging the White House in </p>
<p>discussion of the UN options and of a tough draft UNSCR designed to get the inspectors </p>
<p>back in”, he believed the UK should:</p>
<p>“… point out to the White House that this is unlikely to be achievable and that the </p>
<p>concerns of Sir Jeremy Greenstock … must be taken seriously. You will recall </p>

<p><b>314. </b> The letter of 6 September summarised Sir Jeremy’s concerns and stated that the </p>

<p>Iraq’s failure to co&#8209;operate constitutes a material breach/gross violation of its </p>

<p><b>316. </b> The FCO concluded with a caution on timing:</p>
<p>“… no action in the Security Council should be taken until the Russians have been </p>

<p><b>319. </b> In a conversation with Secretary Powell on 6 September, Mr Straw said that the UK </p>
<p>would not want a kitchen sink resolution which was un&#8209;negotiable.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> He was sure that </p>
<p>Mr Blair would reinforce that message with President Bush. </p>
<p><b>Sir David Manning’s discussion with Dr Rice, 6 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>320.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that there would be better prospects of </b></p>
<p><b>securing a tough mandate if there was a promise to return to the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>before force was used. </b></p>
<p><b>321. </b> Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed the contents and handling of a draft </p>
<p>resolution in the morning of 6 September.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>322. </b> Sir David reported to Mr Blair that he had told Dr Rice:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A resolution “must not be a transparent device to justify military action. The focus </p>
<p>must be the return of Inspectors, and WMD. If Bush tabled something that could </p>
<p>not easily be dismissed as a transparent pretext for immediate military action, </p>
<p>there would be a wide measure of international support.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That “did not mean that the resolution should not be tough on Saddam. But it </p>
<p>would need nice judgement and strong nerves to get the balance right … Once </p>
<p>the international community had signed up, we would be in a different place.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Russians would be key. It was essential that Bush did a great deal of heavy </p>
<p>lifting with Putin before the resolution was tabled …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“France would also be crucial to the argument.” Mr Blair was talking to President </p>
<p>Chirac that day. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir David “thought that the French would rally to a well constructed, even if tough </p>
<p>resolution, as long as they believed the US purpose in tabling it was genuine”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A resolution was needed that “made it clear this was Saddam’s last chance. But </p>
<p>the question of an ultimatum would need great care. It might be worth adopting </p>
<p>a strategy in two parts: an initial resolution that stipulated strict conditions with </p>
<p>the implication that further action would follow swiftly if these were not met. </p>
<p>Thereafter, if Saddam failed to fulfil the conditions, we would need a second </p>
<p>resolution containing an ultimatum. Countries that had supported the first </p>
<p>resolution would find it correspondingly harder to oppose the second … these </p>

<p>were preliminary thoughts … you [Mr Blair] would want to explore the pros and </p>
<p>cons of an ultimatum, and its timing, when you saw [President] Bush tomorrow.” </p>
<p><b>323. </b> Dr Rice did not contest Sir David’s points. She told him that “the current plan” was </p>
<p>for President Bush’s speech at the UN General Assembly to “focus on a clear demand </p>
<p>that Iraq must forswear WMD” which would be “accompanied by an announcement” that </p>
<p>the US would be tabling a draft resolution.</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Sir David reported that current White House thinking on the core points for the </p>
<p>resolution included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>full “WMD disarmament under the international supervision of the Security </p>
<p>Council”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“unrestricted access for UNMOVIC”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>freedom for “witnesses” to the WMD programme to leave Iraq and be </p>
<p>interviewed by UNMOVIC “at any time”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>empowerment for inspectors “to destroy any prohibited material they </p>
<p>discovered”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“force protection” for UNMOVIC; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi agreement to no&#8209;fly and no&#8209;drive zones as required.</p>
<p>The resolution would conclude by stating that If Saddam Hussein “adhered to these </p>
<p>conditions”, that would “lead to a new international relationship with Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>325. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that force protection would be “a hard sell”. He had repeated </p>
<p>the need to have some “negotiating fat” in the draft resolution for Russia, which might </p>
<p>include force protection. Dr Rice agreed.</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Sir David reported that he had “welcomed the fact” that the US was “not now </p>
<p>thinking of stipulating regime change”. Dr Rice said that as they “had discussed before, </p>
<p>Saddam’s acceptance of the other conditions would lead to a radically different regime </p>
<p>anyway”. Sir David also said that there was a need to find a way to emphasise that the </p>
<p>“quarrel was with Saddam not the Iraqi people”; the “aim should be to isolate him, as we </p>
<p>had tried to isolate Milošević”. Dr Rice agreed.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Sir David reported to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“As I said to you afterwards, further encouragement. White House thinking about the </p>
<p>contents of the resolution has come back to earth and looks broadly plausible. And </p>
<p>their view of handling (a serious text, working with Putin etc) seems close to ours. </p>
<p>We must hope all this survives Cheney and the NSC meeting starting this evening. </p>
<p>But on this evidence, the Administration may now be ready to make a genuine effort </p>
<p>to go the UN route. Cementing this at Camp David will be a real prize.”</p>

<p><b>Sir Christopher Meyer’s advice, 5 and 6 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>329. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer reported on 5 September that the US Administration was </p>
<p>considering starting to make the case against Saddam Hussein and using President </p>
<p>Bush’s speech at the UN to indict him then circulating a draft resolution the following </p>
<p>week. Congressional resolutions authorising military action would be sought in </p>
<p>early October.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> The US was also thinking about a further resolution at a date to be </p>
<p>determined which would issue a 48 hour ultimatum before military action was taken. </p>
<p><b>330. </b> Sir Christopher added that there was still “feverish debate” about the content of </p>
<p>the first resolution, and in particular how to secure intrusive inspections and whether to </p>
<p>expand the case against Saddam beyond WMD. A study to be released on 6 September </p>
<p>would suggest an “Inspection Implementation Force” to be established in neighbouring </p>
<p>countries. Other options were also being considered although any option was likely to be </p>
<p>unacceptable to Iraq. One official had commented: “but that was the whole point”.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> Sir Christopher reported that he had made clear that the UK view was that the </p>
<p>focus had to remain squarely on the WMD threat, but there were two US concerns about </p>
<p>that approach. First, the intelligence was not substantial enough to make a convincing </p>
<p>case that regime change was necessary and justified. American public opinion would </p>
<p>need something more; issues like human rights would play well. Secondly, there was </p>
<p>concern that, if the focus was only on WMD and Saddam Hussein folded at the eleventh </p>
<p>hour, it would undercut the imperative for regime change.</p>
<p><b>332.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised on 6 September that Iraq was likely to </b></p>
<p><b>dominate Washington politics during the autumn and there was a raft of </b></p>
<p><b>unanswered questions about a “UN route”.</b></p>
<p><b>333.  Sir Christopher warned that it was “far from a given” that the “UN process </b></p>
<p><b>should be exhausted, as we would understand it, before military action is </b></p>
<p><b>contemplated”. </b></p>
<p><b>334.  Sir Christopher suggested that it would be more important to get it right than </b></p>
<p><b>to do it fast.</b></p>
<p><b>335. </b> Before the meeting at Camp David, Sir Christopher Meyer advised that, while </p>

<p><b>336. </b> Sir Christopher wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A military invasion and its aftermath would be “less perilous [for the US] </p>
<p>in company”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush’s initiative (his letter to Congress of 4 September) had “got him </p>
<p>off the defensive” but he had “been damaged by policy drift”. Iraq was “likely to </p>
<p>dominate Washington politics until Congress adjourns for the mid&#8209;term elections </p>
<p>[in November 2002]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush had repeated comments that the policy was Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>removal: “Disarmament as [an] objective has been left to lesser spokesmen to </p>
<p>articulate.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush’s instincts “were with the hawks”: Saddam Hussein had “had his </p>
<p>chance” and would “never change”. The elimination of WMD was “inseparable </p>
<p>from the elimination of Saddam himself; inspections were a discredited </p>
<p>instrument” and the UN “was not to be trusted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair was “likely to find a President with his heart and his head in conflict”. </p>
<p>While President Bush’s instincts might be to “move to attack Iraq as soon as </p>
<p>possible”, now that he had “launched a process of consultation” he would “to a </p>
<p>degree be bound by its dynamic”. The challenge for the President would be how </p>
<p>to convince Congress and the American people “why it is urgent” to get rid of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hearings in Congress could last “through October”. There was a “huge debate </p>
<p>inside the Administration about the content of Security Council resolution(s) … </p>
<p>even the principle of a SCR remains under challenge. I am reluctant to predict </p>
<p>how this will be decided … before the Prime Minister arrives.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “dilemma … over inspections” was “sharp”: “Many Americans want to set </p>
<p>the bar so high that if Saddam were to accept, it would be tantamount to regime </p>
<p>change. I assume this is unsaleable in New York. For others … the nightmare is </p>
<p>that Saddam will say ‘yes’ and avoid attack. I think it is far from a given … that </p>
<p>the UN process should be exhausted, as we would understand it, before military </p>
<p>action is contemplated. The UK could find itself in an awkward two&#8209;way stretch </p>
<p>between the Americans and others in the Security Council.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The White House hoped that the UN approach would “square the circle of </p>
<p>divisions within the Administration”. Sir Christopher commented that it might </p>
<p>succeed but it was “as likely to reopen the fault line between [Secretary] Powell </p>
<p>and the neo cons and by extension between the two sides of the Atlantic”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The pre&#8209;conditions for military action are a focal point for Camp David. So are </p>
<p>post&#8209;war Iraq and the MEPP … The President seems to have bought the neo </p>
<p>con notion that with the overthrow of Saddam all will be sweetness and light in </p>
<p>Iraq, with automatic benefits in the rest of the Middle East (which partly explains </p>
<p>his inactivity on the latter). In reality, it will probably make pacifying Afghanistan </p>
<p>look like child’s play. The US is probably in greater need of coalition and UN </p>

<p>support for what is likely to be a very protracted post&#8209;war phase, than for the </p>
<p>attack itself. Afghanistan has shown that the US is not good at consolidating </p>
<p>politically what it has achieved militarily.”</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Sir Christopher commented:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister will have very clear ideas how he wants to play Iraq with Bush. </p>
<p>I would say only that it is more important to get it right than to do it fast. Bush’s head </p>
<p>will agree. But his heart is impatient, he fears being labelled a wimp like his father, </p>
<p>and his emotions will be stirred by the approach of the 9/11 anniversary.” </p>
<p>There would be “pressure on Bush to elide the distinction” between the two positions. </p>
<p><b>President Chirac’s views, 6 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>338.  President Chirac told Mr Blair that the inspectors had to return to Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>immediately with full powers and they needed to be intelligent. He would support </b></p>
<p><b>that sort of resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>339.  The disadvantages of any US unilateralism would be much greater than the </b></p>
<p><b>advantages. </b></p>
<p><b>340. </b> In a conversation with President Chirac on 6 September, Mr Blair asked for his </p>
<p>views in advance of the meeting with President Bush.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>341. </b> President Chirac’s response was reported to have included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had been “systematically and stupidly provoked … into getting rid of the </p>
<p>inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He did not think Saddam Hussein “posed an immediate nuclear danger, but </p>
<p>clearly there were CBW risks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors had to return immediately, but in the current climate Mr Annan </p>
<p>should give Iraq an assurance that the inspectors were real, not spies.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors must have full powers, but they needed to be intelligent.</p>
<p><b>342. </b> President Chirac told Mr Blair that France would support that sort of UN resolution, </p>
<p>but if that did not work, there were two scenarios:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US could attack Iraq on its own initiative but, “France would not participate, </p>
<p>‘since we are against unilateralism and do not want to feed anti&#8209;Americanism’, </p>
<p>and because it would be dangerous militarily especially if Saddam had CBW. </p>
<p>It would not lead to the right result. There was a risk of Iraq blowing up in the </p>

<p><b>343. </b> Mr Blair told President Chirac that Saddam Hussein had to know that this was “his </p>
<p>last chance to co&#8209;operate”. It would be:</p>
<p>“… difficult to persuade the US to go down the UN path unless they believed that </p>
<p>a refusal by Saddam to abide by his UN obligations would result in some damage </p>
<p>to him.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… he understood the French position: support for a UNSCR on inspectors, no </p>
<p>support for unilateral military action, and ready to discuss UN S[ecurity] C[ouncil] </p>
<p>measures if Saddam refused to comply.” </p>
<p><b>345. </b> President Chirac:</p>
<p>“… confirmed that that was his position. He recognised that maximum pressure </p>
<p>was needed on Saddam. Saddam understood that he faced a choice: inspectors </p>
<p>or attack. The problem was that he always took stupid decisions. So Chirac was </p>
<p>worried. And worse was Cheney’s talk about military action whatever Saddam did </p>
<p>on inspections, which gave Saddam no incentive to accept inspectors. There were </p>
<p>imbeciles on both sides.” </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Mr Blair “agreed to report back” to President Chirac after his discussions with </p>
<p>President Bush. </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with Dr Blix, 6 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>347. </b> Mr Blair met Dr Blix on 6 September.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>348. </b> The record stated that Dr Blix told Mr Blair that Iraq was continuing to insist on </p>
<p>a comprehensive settlement, which would link lifting the No&#8209;Fly Zones, removing the </p>
<p>US threat, lifting sanctions, and establishing a zone free of WMD. The threat of military </p>
<p>action had led to Iraq weakening its position but Iraq would not move to allow inspectors </p>
<p>back in if it thought that military action was inevitable or if they thought there was no </p>
<p>prospect of military action. They would move if they saw a link between a move and </p>
<p>avoiding military action. Mr Blair said that he thought there was such a link but the </p>
<p>inspection regime would have to be tough. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>349. </b> Dr Blix told Mr Blair that Iraq had two “fears”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Once the inspectors returned there would be a “a stand&#8209;off over access which </p>
<p>the US would take as a casus belli”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC would “inherit UNSCOM’s leakiness” which had “discredited </p>
<p>UNSCOM”. </p>
<p><b>350. </b> Dr Blix said that he would support stronger inspections if that was the decision </p>
<p>of the Security Council. Whatever arrangements were agreed, there would be limits </p>
<p>to what inspections could achieve: “For instance, it would be very hard to catch Iraq’s </p>
<p>mobile installations.” </p>
<p><b>351. </b> Dr Blix also warned Mr Blair that UNMOVIC would need a couple of months to </p>
<p>prepare and 60 days thereafter for “rebaselining”: “So it would be nearly four months </p>
<p>before the inspectors could present the issues to the UNSC.”</p>
<p><b>President Putin’s views, 6 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>352.  President Putin told Mr Blair that he had great doubts about the legality of </b></p>
<p><b>the use of military force, but was prepared to work to achieve a UN resolution </b></p>
<p><b>which would convince Iraq to readmit inspectors on terms which had been agreed </b></p>
<p><b>in the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>353. </b> In a telephone conversation on 6 September, President Putin stated that he </p>
<p>thought the Russian and UK approaches were “very close”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>both were insisting on the return of inspectors in accordance with UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Foreign Ministers were working with a close understanding; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>we had to be 100 percent sure that Iraq would never produce </p>
<p>WMD programmes.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>354. </b> Russia had been working with Iraq to ensure that it understood, and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Foreign Minister had confirmed in Moscow earlier that week that it was prepared to </p>
<p>discuss the return of “UN structures”. Iraq was prepared to allow UN inspectors and </p>
<p>monitoring to return; we had to ensure that was on our conditions. Russia had to be </p>
<p>involved in developing those conditions or it would not be possible for it to subscribe to </p>
<p>those “rules”. Mr Blair agreed.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> President Putin told Mr Blair that Russia had great doubts about the legality of the </p>
<p>use of military force and all diplomatic means were far from exhausted: “But he thought </p>
<p>it would be possible for the UN Security Council to come up with a common position, to </p>
<p>ensure that the Iraqis saw that they had no way out.” </p>

<p><b>Saudi Arabia</b></p>
<p><b>357. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Blair met the Saudi Foreign Minister, Prince Saud, on </p>

<p>international coalition on terrorism of the current speculation about military action in Iraq </p>
<p>and the dangers in the region if military action was taken without some improvement </p>

<p><b>358.  No decision on a possible UK military contribution to US operations was </b></p>

<p> The letter said that Mr Hoon considered:</p>
<p>“… it particularly important that we guard against any false assumptions that </p>

<p>158</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Mr Blair’s view, as reported on 3 September by Sir David Manning, was for </p>
<p>“nothing to be said to the US about Op FRESCO for the moment”.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> Mr Blair hoped it </p>
<p>would be possible to discuss the issues with Mr Hoon the following week before he flew </p>
<p>to Washington.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Blair discussed the UK’s military contribution with Mr Hoon on 5 September.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Straw was also present. </p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, recorded that Mr Blair, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and Mr Straw had discussed the packages, and that Mr Hoon had highlighted </p>
<p>the benefits of Package 2. “No decisions were taken” and Mr Blair “did not expect </p>
<p>President Bush to commit himself imminently to a military campaign”. </p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Watkins also recorded that Mr Hoon had met Mr Gordon Brown, Chancellor of </p>
<p>the Exchequer, to discuss the options and alert him to the likely costs of Package 2. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> There was no No.10 record of the meeting.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Watkins wrote to No.10 on 6 September, providing an update on US military </p>
<p>planning and “the factors informing decisions on any UK military contribution”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>cautioned that the MOD’s assessment was “necessarily provisional”, partly because </p>
<p>the US plan was still evolving, and partly because there had not yet been “detailed joint </p>
<p>planning with the US”. </p>
<p><b>369. </b> The MOD had identified three options ranging from minimum to maximum effort, </p>
<p>including a further revision of the impact of Op FRESCO which meant that: </p>
<p>“Were we to throw in everything we are likely to have, the UK could potentially </p>
<p>generate up to a divisional headquarters, an armoured brigade, 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade and a logistic brigade.” </p>
<p><b>370. </b> The MOD was also “examining whether a Royal Marine Commando could form </p>
<p>part of Package 2 [the air and maritime forces packages]”.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> A land Task Force would “offer significant capability to a US&#8209;led northern </p>
<p>force, although it would not be fully suitable for involvement in decisive war&#8209;fighting </p>
<p>operations”. </p>
<p><b>372. </b> The MOD advice concluded that should “US military preparations continue at their </p>
<p>current pace, we will face some early tough decisions within two weeks of your return </p>
<p>from Camp David”.</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, Camp David, </b></p>
<p><b>7 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>375.  President Bush held a meeting of his National Security Council at </b></p>
<p><b>Camp David before his meeting with Mr Blair, during which he decided to seek </b></p>
<p><b>a UN resolution on Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>376. </b> President Bush described the meeting of the US National Security Council at </p>
<p>Camp David on 7 September as having been convened “to finalize my decision on the </p>
<p>resolution”; the US was “trying to find a way to remove the threat in Iraq without war”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>377. </b> The meeting was given a briefing by Gen Franks, who introduced his concept of </p>
<p>five simultaneous “operational fronts” in Iraq.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>378. </b> Describing the positions of senior members of the Administration, President Bush </p>
<p>wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney had recommended giving Saddam: “30&#8209;60 days to come </p>
<p>clean, and then disarm him by force if he refused to comply … We can’t delay </p>
<p>for another year … An inspection regime does not solve our problem.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had pushed for a UN resolution: “If we take the case to the UN, </p>
<p>we can get allies to join. If not, it will be hard to act unilaterally. We won’t have </p>
<p>the international support we need to execute the military plan.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>379. </b> President Bush also wrote: </p>
<p>“After listening to the options one last time, I made a decision: We would seek a </p>
<p>resolution. ‘There’s ambiguity in the international community’s view of Saddam … </p>
<p>and we need to clear it up. Either he will come clean about his weapons or there will </p>
<p>be war’.” </p>
<p><b>380. </b> President Bush had told his team that he would deliver the message in his speech </p>
<p>to the UN the following week:</p>
<p>“Either the words of the Security Council would be enforced, or the UN would exist </p>
<p>only as a useless international body …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Dr Rice gave a similar account of the 7 September NSC meeting in her memoir:</p>
<p>“The President had decided on a policy of coercive diplomacy. He would give </p>
<p>Saddam a chance to respond to the united pressure of the international community, </p>
<p>and the build&#8209;up of US forces would make that pressure credible … One way or </p>
<p>another, the threat of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq would finally be removed.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Dr Rice further commented:</p>
<p>“Some people have claimed that the President never asked his advisors whether </p>
<p>he should go to war against Saddam. At that September meeting … the National </p>
<p>Security Council, after a full and frank discussion, decided on a course of action. </p>
<p>Everyone in that room heard the President say: ‘Either he will come clean about his </p>
<p>weapons, or there will be war.’ There was no disagreement. The way ahead could </p>
<p>not have been clearer.”</p>
<p><b>383. </b> Vice President Cheney wrote that he had been a strong advocate of using </p>
<p>President Bush’s speech to “challenge the UN”, to “confront” it and “hold the </p>
<p>organization accountable”, making clear that “if the Security Council was unwilling to </p>
<p>impose consequences for violations, the UN would become irrelevant”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> He did not </p>
<p>want “yet one more meaningless resolution”. </p>
<p><b>384. </b> Vice President Cheney also wrote that President Bush:</p>
<p>“… had not yet made a decision, but in neither this meeting nor any other I attended </p>
<p>did any of the President’s advisors argue against using military force to remove </p>
<p>Saddam … Nor did anyone argue that leaving Saddam in power, with all the risks </p>
<p>and costs associated with that course, was a viable option.”</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Tenet wrote in his memoir:</p>
<p>“Colin Powell was firmly on the side of going the extra mile with the UN. The </p>
<p>Vice President argued just as forcefully that doing so would only get us mired in </p>
<p>a bureaucratic tangle with nothing to show for it other than time lost off a ticking </p>
<p>clock … To me, the President still appeared less inclined to go to war than many of </p>
<p>his senior aides.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>386.  In a press conference before the discussions at Camp David, Mr Blair stated </b></p>

<p><b>388. </b> President Bush stated that it was “an important meeting” with “an important ally” </p>
<p>and friend. They were going to talk about how to keep the peace, the threats faced by </p>
<p>the world and how to promote freedom.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>389. </b> Mr Blair was more direct, stating that they would be “discussing the issues that are </p>
<p>preoccupying us”, and adding: </p>
<p>“The point I would emphasise … is the threat from Saddam Hussein and weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction, chemical, biological, potentially nuclear weapons capability, </p>
<p>that threat is real. We only need to look at the report from the International Atomic </p>
<p>Agency [sic] this morning</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> showing what has been going on at the former nuclear </p>
<p>site to realise that. And the policy of inaction is not a policy we can responsibly </p>
<p>subscribe to. So the purpose of our discussion today is to work out the right strategy </p>
<p>for dealing with this, because deal with it we must.”</p>
<p><b>390. </b> In response to a question, Mr Blair emphasised concern about Iraq’s attempts to </p>
<p>develop nuclear weapons and the importance of the IAEA report he had mentioned, </p>
<p>which showed there was “a real issue that has to be tackled here”. He stated that, on the </p>
<p>way to Camp David, he had been reading “the catalogue of attempts by Iraq to conceal </p>
<p>its weapons of mass destruction, not to tell the truth … over a period of years”.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> President Bush said that Saddam Hussein had:</p>
<p>“… said he was going to get rid of weapons of mass destruction. And for 11 long </p>
<p>years, he has not fulfilled his promise. And we are going to talk about what to do </p>
<p>about it. We owe it to future generations to deal with this problem, and that’s what </p>
<p>these discussions are all about.” </p>
<p><b>392. </b> Asked about international support, Mr Blair replied that:</p>
<p>“… people were asking perfectly reasonable questions … but the one thing no one </p>
<p>can deny is that Saddam Hussein is in breach of the United Nations resolutions </p>
<p>on weapons of mass destruction … that that poses a threat not just to the region, </p>
<p>because there is no way, if those weapons are used, that the threat would simply </p>
<p>stay in the region.</p>
<p>“People understand that. Now we have got to make sure that we work out a way </p>
<p>forward that, of course, mobilises the maximum support, but does so on the basis </p>
<p>of removing a threat that the United Nations itself has determined is a threat to the </p>
<p>whole world.”</p>

<p><b>393. </b> The British journalists covering the Camp David meeting focused on the </p>

<p><b>394. </b> The<i> Sunday Express</i> anticipated a “<i>Dossier of Doom</i>”.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>395. </b> An editorial in the<i> News of the World </i>claimed that the dossier would be “as </p>
<p>devastating as it is vital”.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> It would show that “evil Saddam has enough chemical and </p>
<p>biological stocks to attack the entire planet, and the missile technology to deliver them”, </p>
<p>and would confirm that he is on the brink of nuclear capability. The editorial concluded </p>
<p>“We believe Mr Blair CAN convince us a military attack on Iraq is right. We have faith in </p>
<p>our Prime Minister.” </p>
<p><b>396.  In their meeting Mr Blair told President Bush that he was in no doubt about </b></p>
<p><b>the need to deal with Saddam Hussein. </b></p>
<p><b>397.  Mr Blair argued that the strategy should be to seek two resolutions; one </b></p>
<p><b>making tough initial demands including intrusive inspections, with the option of a </b></p>
<p><b>second if and when Saddam Hussein did not comply. </b></p>
<p><b>398.  The UN would then need to accept the responsibility for enforcing its </b></p>
<p><b>decisions, or action would be taken without it. </b></p>
<p><b>399.  Mr Blair also set out the need to build a case to persuade the international </b></p>
<p><b>community of the threat posed by Iraq, including the potential for fusion of WMD </b></p>
<p><b>and terrorism. </b></p>
<p><b>400.  It was “critically important” that the US and UK made it clear that they </b></p>
<p><b>remained committed to the return of inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>401.  Mr Blair cautioned President Bush about his assumption that the UK would </b></p>
<p><b>be ready to lead a strike into northern Iraq. But he told President Bush that the UK </b></p>
<p><b>would take a significant military role if it came to war with Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>402.  Sir David Manning suggested that US and European opinion should be </b></p>
<p><b>reminded that, while the US and UK would prefer to take action through the UN, </b></p>
<p><b>they would find other means if that was not possible.</b></p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Campbell recorded that Mr Blair had discussed the content of a resolution on </p>
<p>the flight to Camp David; and that “after a long discussion”, Mr Blair had “[come] round” </p>
<p>to Sir David Manning’s view “that it was probably best to get a tough first mandate by </p>
<p>promising to go back to the UN, but make it clear that the UN had to face up to this”.</p>

<p>Vice President Cheney and Dr Rice from 1600 to 1745. Sir David Manning recorded that </p>
<p>it was a “remarkable” meeting. President Bush had congratulated Mr Blair on his speech </p>
<p>at Sedgefield. </p>
<p><b>406. </b> During the meeting, the arguments for taking the issue to the UN, the type of </p>
<p>resolution, the attitude of other members of the Security Council, the relationship with </p>
<p>the MEPP, and aspects of a military campaign and the “morning after”, were discussed </p>
<p>in depth. </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Blair said that he was in no doubt about the need to deal with Saddam Hussein; </p>
<p>and that the likelihood was that this would mean military action at some point. The </p>
<p>immediate issue was “how to maximise the chance of resolving the Saddam dilemma </p>
<p>quickly and cleanly”. It was possible that sustained pressure would lead to his quick </p>
<p>collapse, but “we could certainly not count on it”. That might “in part” depend on “winning </p>
<p>the propaganda battle” and securing wide international support:</p>
<p>“If it came to force, we could hope that we would secure the relatively quick </p>
<p>overthrow of Saddam. But even if we did, we would still be faced with the big issue </p>
<p>of what followed his departure.”</p>
<p><b>408. </b> There would be even more difficult problems if Saddam Hussein did not collapse </p>
<p>quickly. We should not assume that there would be a quick collapse in Iraq as there had </p>
<p>been with the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Blair stated that the position of the international community made it important </p>
<p>to bring the issue back to the UN and secure a new Security Council resolution. Indeed, </p>
<p>two resolutions might be necessary: one setting conditions and one stipulating action </p>
<p>when Saddam failed to meet them. Without a resolution, military action would have little </p>
<p>or no international backing. </p>
<p><b>410. </b> Later, Mr Blair recognised that the two resolution route offered a better chance of </p>
<p>setting tough initial demands, but with a risk of difficulties in securing a second resolution </p>
<p>authorising action. In a discussion about how a breach would be established and the </p>
<p>need to avoid a long debate, Mr Blair said: “If Saddam was obviously in breach we </p>
<p>would know, and we had to be ready to move.” On balance, Mr Blair favoured a tough </p>
<p>initial resolution leaving open the option of going back to the UN for a second resolution, </p>
<p>if and when Saddam were in breach.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Mr Blair said that it was “unlikely” that Saddam would comply with the new </p>
<p>resolution; even if he let the inspectors back in he would probably prevent them from </p>
<p>doing their job. He added:</p>
<p>“We should then be in a very powerful position in demanding action in response to </p>
<p>his obstruction and prevarication.”</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Blair suggested the need, in parallel with UN activity, to:</p>
<p>“… start making military deployments to demonstrate to Saddam and the </p>
<p>international community our seriousness of intent; and to be ready to move if we </p>
<p>had to. The message would be stark; either the regime must change in response </p>
<p>to the UN resolution, or it would be changed through military action.”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Mr Blair stated that there would be a need to table a very strong resolution that </p>
<p>would stipulate intrusive inspection; and that Dr Blix would do a “thorough job”. Dr Blix </p>
<p>had put forward some good ideas about UNMOVIC’s coverage of Iraq in a discussion </p>
<p>the previous day. The resolution would also need to include provisions for humanitarian </p>
<p>monitoring inside Iraq, and possibly force protection for UNMOVIC. “The trick would be </p>
<p>to make a resolution acceptable to Security Council members but sufficiently stringent to </p>
<p>bring about profound change in Iraq were Saddam to implement it.” </p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Blair also set out the need to make a good public case against Saddam, </p>
<p>publishing all the evidence. The UK would publish a dossier. He stated that the US </p>
<p>and UK: </p>
<p>“… must build our case, persuading the international community of the nature of the </p>
<p>threat. In particular we must get over to our publics the reality that any crisis in the </p>
<p>Gulf generated by Saddam would inevitably involve us.”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Later Mr Blair stated that there was a need to explain the case for action fully to </p>
<p>public opinion: “While insisting that no&#8209;one wanted war, we must spell out why we had to </p>
<p>act.” This included reminding people of the horrors of Saddam’s regime. </p>
<p><b>416. </b> Mr Blair said that there was a:</p>
<p>“… natural reluctance to do difficult things, made worse by ignorance … of Saddam’s </p>
<p>capabilities and intentions. We had to correct this, at the same time answering the </p>
<p>legitimate question of why we were taking action now. 11 September was a powerful </p>
<p>argument for dealing with threats before they materialised … At some point, </p>
<p>WMD and terrorism would come together, with appalling consequences, unless </p>
<p>we took action.”</p>

<p><b>417. </b> In the context of a discussion about the attitudes of other members of the Security </p>
<p>Council, Sir David Manning suggested that US and European opinion should be </p>
<p>reminded of what had happened over Kosovo: </p>
<p>“We had tried to go the UN route; we were thwarted; so we had had to resort to a </p>
<p>coalition of the willing. The moral was that we would prefer to take action through the </p>
<p>UN if we could but we would find other means if we could not.” </p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Blair stated that in those circumstances, the US and UK would have to make </p>
<p>clear that either the UN accepted its responsibilities for enforcing its decisions, or action </p>
<p>would be taken without it. It was “critically important” that the initial resolution should </p>
<p>not appear to be “merely a pretext for military action”; we had to make it clear that </p>
<p>we remained committed to the resumption of inspections and wanted the resolution </p>
<p>to succeed.</p>
<p><b>419. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair also discussed the prospects for a military campaign, </p>
<p>including the possibility of leaving Saddam “bottled up” in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> Sir David Manning recorded that Mr Blair had expressed caution about the US </p>
<p>assumption that the UK would be ready to lead a strike from Turkey into northern Iraq </p>
<p>and provide two&#8209;thirds of the force. But Mr Blair emphasised that the UK would indeed </p>
<p>take “a significant military role” if it came to war with Iraq. </p>
<p><b>421. </b> Finally, the importance of US action to make progress on the MEPP was also </p>
<p>discussed.</p>
<p><b>422. </b> Sir David Manning’s record of the discussion was submitted to Mr Blair and sent to </p>
<p>a number of colleagues in No.10. A personal copy was also sent to Mr Straw. No other </p>
<p>copies appear to have been made.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> US and UK officials held a meeting in parallel with the discussions between </p>
<p>President Bush and Mr Blair. The only record of that meeting appears in Mr Campbell’s </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>426. </b> Mr Blair stated that since 1998, there was evidence, including in the 6 September </p>
<p>IAEA report, of continued development of WMD. He also thought that the nature of </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime “should become part of our case on WMD”; and that: “We needed an </p>
<p>active strategy to take the debate to the rest of the world.” He set out the UK’s plans to </p>
<p>publish the dossier within a few weeks. Mr Campbell emphasised the need for people </p>
<p>“to understand what BW actually did”; and that the “media threshold would be high, so </p>
<p>the dossier would need to include new facts from the last four years”.</p>
<p><b>427. </b> During the plenary meeting Mr Stephen Hadley, US Deputy National Security </p>
<p>Advisor, put forward principles for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq: territorial integrity, </p>
<p>democracy, and a role for the UN. </p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Rycroft’s record of the plenary contained little of the substance addressed in </p>
<p>the restricted meeting. It was sent to the Private Secretaries to Mr Hoon and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretary, and to Sir Richard Dearlove, Sir Francis Richards, Mr Scarlett, Mr Bowen, </p>
<p>Sir Christopher Meyer and Sir Jeremy Greenstock. It was again marked personal and it </p>
<p>is clear from the copy on the FCO files that named senior officials were allowed to read </p>
<p>the letter only in Mr Straw’s Private Office. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair “felt that his job was to sell the </p>
<p>case for the UN route to Cheney”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> After the private meeting, Sir David Manning had </p>
<p>said that President Bush had used Mr Blair to persuade the Vice President; and that </p>
<p>President Bush had made up his mind on the threat and the need for the UN to deal </p>
<p>with it.</p>
<p><b>430. </b> The official record confirms that was the UK perception.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that President Bush had told him:</p>
<p>“… it’s the right thing to do and future generations will surely thank us. I really </p>
<p>believe that. I really believe the world has to get rid of Saddam and I really </p>
<p>appreciate y’all coming over.”</p>

<p>“… We believed Saddam’s weakness was that he loved power and would do </p>
<p>anything to keep it. If we could convince him that we were serious about removing </p>
<p>his regime, there was a chance he would give up his WMD … The odds of success </p>
<p>were long. But given the alternative it was worth the effort. The approach was called </p>
<p>coercive diplomacy.</p>
<p>“Coercive diplomacy with Iraq consisted of two tracks: One was to rally a coalition </p>
<p>of nations to make clear that Saddam’s defiance of his international obligations was </p>
<p>unacceptable. The other was to develop a credible military option that could be used </p>
<p>if he failed to comply. These tracks would run parallel at first. As the military option </p>
<p>grew more visible and more advanced, the tracks would converge. Our maximum </p>
<p>leverage would come just before they intersected. That would be the moment of </p>
<p>decision. And ultimately, it would be Saddam Hussein’s decision to make.”</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>434. </b> President Bush wrote that Mr Blair had been “pleased when I told him that I </p>
<p>was planning to ask the UN for the resolution”, and that Mr Blair had replied: “Many </p>
<p>opponents wish we would just be unilateral – then they could complain … But you are </p>
<p>calling their bluff.”</p>
<p><b>435. </b> President Bush added:</p>
<p>“We both understood what the decision meant. Once we laid out our position at </p>
<p>the UN, we had to be willing to follow through with the consequences. If diplomacy </p>
<p>failed, there would be only one option left. ‘I don’t want to go to war,’ I told Tony, ‘but </p>
<p>I will do it’.</p>
<p>“Tony agreed.”</p>
<p><b>436.  Vice President Cheney wrote that President Bush wanted to support </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s position; but he also expressed scepticism about the utility of </b></p>

<p><b>437. </b> Vice President Cheney wrote that in the meeting with Mr Blair they had talked </p>
<p>through the need for UN involvement: </p>
<p>“Blair was tough. He understood the stakes and the importance of acting against </p>
<p>Saddam, and he was clear that he would be with us no matter what – and that was </p>
<p>likely to include strong opposition from within his own party.</p>
<p>“Blair argued that a UN resolution was necessary to achieve maximum international </p>
<p>cooperation. He was very persuasive, and I understood that the President wanted </p>
<p>to support his friend. There was no legal obligation for us to pursue a resolution, but </p>
<p>there were some in the United States and many more in Europe who felt it would </p>
<p>legitimize military action, and a resolution would also speak to their concerns. The </p>
<p>President told the Prime Minister he would go forward with a resolution.</p>

<p><b>445. </b> President Chirac gave an interview to the <i>New York Times</i> on 8 September, which </p>
<p>was published the following day.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>446. </b> In the context of the US position that a doctrine of pre&#8209;emption was necessary </p>
<p>to fight terrorism, President Chirac stated that he had told President Bush that he had </p>
<p>“great reservations” about that doctrine: “As soon as one nation claims the right to </p>
<p>take preventive action, other countries will naturally do the same … How would the </p>
<p>Americans, the Europeans and others react?” </p>
<p><b>447. </b> Asked what would be the best way to be sure that Saddam Hussein did not </p>
<p>develop “further weapons of mass destruction” and whether he shared the US objective </p>
<p>of regime change, President Chirac replied: </p>
<p>“I don’t need to tell you that I condemn the regime …</p>
<p>“Secondly, I am totally against unilateralism in the modern world. I believe that </p>
<p>the modern world must be coherent and consequently, if a military action is to </p>
<p>be undertaken, it must be the responsibility of the international community, via a </p>
<p>decision by the Security Council. Now, the Security Council has decided that Iraq </p>
<p>must not have weapons of mass destruction; it did not say that a regime change </p>
<p>was necessary there. So if the objective is to prevent Iraq from having weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction, we have to go along with what the United Nations has done, that </p>
<p>is, impose the return of inspectors in Iraq without restrictions or preconditions … </p>
<p>If it refuses, then it’s up to the Security Council to deliberate and decide what must </p>
<p>be done and notably whether a military operation should be undertaken or not …”</p>
<p><b>448. </b> Asked about divisions between allies in the context of Mr Blair’s visit to Washington </p>
<p>and his own meeting with Chancellor Schröder, President Chirac replied:</p>
<p>“France is a member of the Security Council, it cannot be prejudiced … I agree </p>
<p>completely that there must be a Security Council decision concerning the return of </p>
<p>the inspectors … If the inspectors are not allowed to return, then there should be a </p>
<p>second Security Council resolution to say if there should be or not an intervention. </p>
<p>Following the second resolution, France will definitely give its position. But I am very </p>
<p>worried about the consequences of an intervention on the international coalition to </p>
<p>counter terrorism …”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>449. </b> Asked under what circumstances France would favour the use of force, President </p>
<p>Chirac responded that he “naturally” wished for a change in the Iraqi regime:</p>
<p>“But a few principles and a little order are needed to run the affairs of the world. The </p>
<p>issue today is to know whether there are any weapons of mass destruction. And to </p>
<p>see it, the inspectors must be free … to visit. This is the objective. If this is fulfilled, </p>
<p>then it’s over. The Security Council or the international community never wanted to </p>

<p>change the regime in Iraq, because there are numerous countries where one wished </p>
<p>to see another regime. But if we go down that road, where are we going?”</p>
<p><b>450. </b> President Chirac stated that military action was possible “if it’s decided by the </p>
<p>international community on the basis of indisputable proof. For the moment, we have </p>
<p>neither proof, nor decisions …” </p>
<p><b>451. </b> In a conversation with Mr Blair on 9 September, President Chirac reiterated his </p>
<p>points.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> Mr Blair gave him a report of his talks with President Bush. Mr Blair told </p>
<p>President Chirac that a UN resolution must focus on WMD, not regime change, and </p>
<p>ensure that the inspectors could return unconditionally and do their job properly. </p>
<p><b>452. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that President Chirac supported a resolution seeking the </p>
<p>return of inspectors but was concerned that some in the US wanted Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>to refuse to justify military action. In President Chirac’s view, there would have to </p>
<p>be a second resolution to justify military action “and that would not be adopted”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair responded that that “would depend on the circumstances”. If the inspectors </p>
<p>returned and Saddam’s WMD were disarmed, the nature of the regime would change. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein should be given the chance to comply. If he refused to do so, </p>
<p>we should be tough.</p>
<p><b>453. </b> In response to a question from President Chirac about whether the UK was sure </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein had WMD, Mr Blair said that: “Personally he had no doubt that </p>
<p>Saddam was trying to rebuild his WMD capacity.” Mr Blair’s view was:</p>
<p>“… we should move to the point where the choice was Saddam’s. Either he </p>
<p>accepted and abided by the new resolution, or we would have to act to ensure that </p>
<p>he abided by it.”</p>
<p><b>454. </b> After further discussion of the US approach and its potential impact, Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that he had made clear to President Bush the need to take action to relaunch the MEPP </p>
<p>and the importance of Afghanistan. He was “convinced that through co&#8209;operation with </p>
<p>the US on Iraq it would be possible to make progress in other areas”. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> Following a conversation between Mr Jean&#8209;David Levitte, French Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN, and Sir Jeremy Greenstock on 11 September, the UK Mission </p>
<p>to the UN New York reported that the French view was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Two resolutions were the only way of achieving consensus and building a </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>459. </b> The Key Judgements of the JIC Assessment, which was issued on 9 September, </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared </p>
<p>to use it.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Faced with the likelihood of military defeat and being removed from power, </p>
<p>Saddam is unlikely to be deterred from using chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>by any diplomatic or military means.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of chemical and biological weapons prior to any military attack would </p>
<p>boost support for US&#8209;led action and is unlikely.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam is prepared to order missile strikes against Israel, with chemical or </p>
<p>biological warheads, in order to widen the war once hostilities begin.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam could order the use of CBW weapons in order to deny space and </p>
<p>territory to coalition forces, or to cause casualties, slow any advance, and sap </p>
<p>US morale.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If not previously employed, Saddam will order the indiscriminate use of whatever </p>
<p>CBW weapons remain available late in a ground campaign or as a final act </p>
<p>of vengeance. But such an order would depend on the availability of delivery </p>
<p>means and the willingness of commanders to obey.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s speech to the TUC, 10 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>461.  In his speech to the TUC on 10 September, Mr Blair argued that the threat </b></p>
<p><b>posed by Iraq was not imminent but it had to be dealt with before it could </b></p>
<p><b>“erupt and engulf us all”. </b></p>
<p><b>462. </b> As he had planned in his minute of 30 August, Mr Blair set out the rationale for </p>
<p>tackling the problem of Iraq – “why I say Saddam is a threat that has to be dealt with” – </p>
<p>in the first section of his speech to the TUC on 10 September.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>463. </b> In the speech, Mr Blair elaborated many of the points he had made in his press </p>
<p>conference on 3 September. Mr Blair argued that Saddam Hussein’s actions in starting </p>
<p>wars of aggression, using chemical weapons against his own people and oppressing </p>
<p>them made his regime: </p>
<p>“With the Taliban gone … unrivalled as the world’s worst regime … </p>
<p>“Given that history … to allow him to use the weapons he has or to get the </p>
<p>weapons he wants would be an act of gross irresponsibility and we should not </p>
<p>countenance it.” </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Blair stated that “when the weapons inspectors were evicted from Iraq in 1998 </p>
<p>there were still enough chemical and biological weapons remaining to devastate the </p>
<p>entire Gulf region”. He also stated that Saddam Hussein had a nuclear programme, </p>
<p>which he had denied and which had been “disrupted” by inspections. He was in breach </p>
<p>of “23 outstanding UN obligations requiring him to admit inspectors and disarm”.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Containment had worked “up to a point”, but sanctions were eroding and Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was getting around US$3bn a year through illicit trade which he was “almost </p>
<p>certainly” using for his weapons programmes. British and American pilots were risking </p>
<p>their lives to police the No&#8209;Fly Zones; and that couldn’t “go on for ever”. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Addressing the way ahead, Mr Blair stated that it was right to deal with Iraq through </p>
<p>the UN; it was the will of the UN that Saddam was flouting. The challenge for “all in the </p>
<p>UN” was “to resolve the threat from Saddam not avoid it”. Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Let it be clear that he must be disarmed. Let it be clear that there can be no more </p>
<p>conditions, no more games, no more prevaricating, no more undermining of the UN’s </p>
<p>authority. </p>
<p>“Let it be clear that should the will of the UN be ignored, action will follow. Diplomacy </p>
<p>is vital. But when dealing with dictators … diplomacy has to be backed by the certain </p>

<p>knowledge in the dictator’s mind that behind the diplomacy is the possibility of force </p>
<p>being used.</p>
<p>“… if we do not deal with the threat from this international outlaw and his barbaric </p>
<p>regime, it may not erupt and engulf us this month or next; perhaps not even this year </p>
<p>or the next. But it will at some point. And I do not want it on my conscience that we </p>
<p>knew the threat, saw it coming and did nothing.” </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Blair concluded this section of his speech by asking people to “listen to the </p>
<p>case” he would “be developing over the coming weeks and to reflect on it”. </p>
<p><b>468. </b> In a broader call for action, including to “restart the Middle East Peace Process” </p>
<p>and for renewed efforts on international terrorism, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“Internationalism is no longer a utopian cry of the left, it is practical statesmanship.”</p>
<p><b>469. </b> It is clear from a record of Mr Hoon’s discussions in Washington on 11 September </p>
<p>that officials in the US Administration were following what Mr Blair said in public closely: </p>
<p>one senior official had described the speech to the TUC as “spectacular”.</p>

<p><b>The decision to recall Parliament</b></p>

<p><b>weapons of mass destruction.</b></p>
<p><b>471. </b> On 11 September,<b> </b>Mr Blair wrote to the Speaker of the House of Commons, and </p>
<p>to the Lord Chancellor, asking for Parliament to be recalled in the week beginning </p>
<p>23 September.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Mr Blair wrote that “Parliament must and will be at the heart of the national debate </p>
<p>on the issue of Iraq and Weapons of Mass Destruction”. He was seeking permission “to </p>
<p>recall Parliament for a one&#8209;day debate on the Adjournment”, led by Mr Straw, following a </p>
<p>statement from himself. He added:</p>
<p>“By then, important discussions at the UN will have taken place. And the </p>
<p>Government will be in a position to publish the dossier on what we know of </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime and its WMD programme.”</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Mr Blair emphasised that “we are not yet at the stage of making decisions about </p>
<p>military commitments with regard to Iraq, and that should we be so in the future, </p>
<p>Parliament would obviously be given every opportunity to express its view”. </p>

<p>174</p>
<p><b>Establishing the objectives of a UN resolution</b></p>
<p><b>474.  Questions emerged in Washington shortly after the meeting at Camp David </b></p>
<p><b>about whether Mr Blair regarded intrusive inspections as a necessary first stage </b></p>
<p><b>in the plan.</b></p>
<p><b>475.  In discussions with Secretary Powell about the strategy, Mr Straw raised </b></p>
<p><b>doubts about the plan to seek authority for the use of military force in a </b></p>
<p><b>second resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>476. </b> Letters from Sir Christopher Meyer</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> and Mr Brenton</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> on 9 September reported </p>
<p>suggestions in the US Administration that Mr Blair had indicated at Camp David that </p>
<p>he would be willing to move straight to a resolution that sought approval to use “all </p>
<p>necessary means” in response to Iraq’s existing material breaches of its obligations </p>
<p>without a resolution strengthening the inspection regime first. The UK was being asked </p>
<p>to make sure that the White House correctly understood its position and, in particular, </p>
<p>whether the UK regarded intrusive inspections as a necessary first stage in the plan.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Straw spoke twice to Secretary Powell on 9 September.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>478. </b> In the first conversation they discussed the issue of whether to go for one or two </p>
<p>resolutions. The record stated that both were concerned to preserve what they described </p>
<p>as “the Kosovo option”; and that Mr Straw thought that that “would require only one </p>
<p>resolution as long as it contained a fig leaf for military action. We should not commit to a </p>
<p>second resolution, although that option could be kept open.” </p>
<p><b>479. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell also agreed that no public document could produce </p>
<p>an incontrovertible case for military action; the focus had to be on compliance with </p>
<p>UN resolutions.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> In the second conversation, Mr Straw had “confirmed ‘100%’ that a UNSCR was </p>
<p>a key part of the strategy discussed between” Mr Blair and President Bush, and that </p>
<p>President Bush had “made clear he did not regard military action as the first option”. </p>
<p><b>481. </b> Secretary Powell and Mr Straw discussed the latest position in a telephone </p>
<p>conversation on 10 September.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> US thinking, influenced by Mr Blair at Camp David, </p>
<p>was that the provision for the use of “all necessary means” against Iraq should be put in </p>
<p>the second resolution. Mr Straw said that he was: </p>
<p>“… in two minds. He was searching for what would work best. If we could get what </p>
<p>was needed in the first resolution, it would be good to have it in the bank. He was </p>

<p>together to pass the first resolution.” </p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the possibility that a second resolution </p>
<p>might not be agreed, whether they would be free to follow the “Kosovo model” and what </p>
<p>Security Council members opposed to the use of force might do. Mr Straw said that </p>
<p>“good wording in the first resolution would change the politics”. They agreed to discuss </p>
<p>the issues further after Mr Straw had spoken to Mr Blair and Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
<p><b>483.  In parallel discussions with Dr Rice and in the context of clear US concerns </b></p>
<p><b>about the potential timetable required by inspections, Sir David Manning </b></p>
<p><b>emphasised the importance of inspections and the need for a report to </b></p>
<p><b>the Security Council before addressing enforcement. Dr Rice asked for </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s views.</b></p>
<p><b>484.  Mr Blair stated that Iraq needed to be played cleverly, using a step by step </b></p>
<p><b>approach to convince opinion that action was needed.</b></p>
<p><b>485. </b> Sir David Manning and Dr Rice also discussed the developing thinking on a </p>
<p>UN resolution on 10 September.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> Sir David reported to Mr Blair that Dr Rice had told </p>
<p>him President Bush was:</p>
<p>“… keen to find a way to ensure the onus was put back on Saddam. We did not </p>
<p>want the ‘inspectors searching around forever’ in a game of cat and mouse. Bush </p>
<p>was uneasy about finding himself in the position of asking the Security Council </p>
<p>to give Saddam a last chance when Saddam had been given so many last </p>
<p>chances already.”</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Sir David had replied that this:</p>
<p>“… was unavoidable: we would inevitably be in the business of giving Saddam </p>
<p>‘another last chance’. This had its difficulties. But it had the overriding benefit of </p>
<p>ensuring that we could attract widespread international support by making clear </p>
<p>that we wanted to go the UN route. And this ‘last chance’ came with the widespread </p>
<p>expectation that, this time we meant business.”</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David that the US Administration was:</p>
<p>“… exploring the possibility of tabling a resolution in two parts. The first would </p>
<p>stipulate that Saddam must make a declaration within fifteen to thirty days </p>
<p>explaining why there had been a discrepancy between his claims and those of the </p>
<p>UNSCOM inspectors … in 1998. He would be required to account for the materials </p>
<p>that UNSCOM had been unable to identify and to promise that UNSCOM would </p>
<p>have access to any that were remaining. This would challenge him to provide </p>
<p>physical evidence relating to his WMD programme, as well as test his commitment </p>

<p>176</p>
<p>of re&#8209;engaging seriously with the international community. Anything less than a </p>
<p>forthcoming response would amount to an admission of guilt, confirming that he was </p>
<p>in material breach of the … UN resolutions.</p>
<p>“The second part would deal with inspections. This would stipulate that the </p>
<p>inspectors would have sixty days to certify that they had now been granted full and </p>
<p>unfettered access to all installations and materials in Iraq, with provision for them </p>
<p>to report back to the Security Council … If Saddam were co&#8209;operating, inspections </p>
<p>could continue after the sixty day period. This part of the resolution would cover the </p>
<p>conditions … including free access (anyone, anywhere, anytime) … and an explicit </p>
<p>invitation to all members of the international community to provide full intelligence to </p>
<p>the Inspectors.”</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David that the US had abandoned the idea of seeking force </p>
<p>protection for UNMOVIC and the second part of the resolution could be “dispensed with” </p>
<p>if the response on a declaration was “unsatisfactory”. She said the US and UK “could </p>
<p>argue that this would amount to a material breach and provided a green light for action”. </p>
<p><b>489. </b> Sir David replied:</p>
<p>“… there were attractions in demanding a declaration from Saddam although we </p>
<p>should not kid ourselves: he was likely to refuse, or to announce blithely that there </p>
<p>had been no discrepancy with UNSCOM and all his WMD had long since been </p>
<p>destroyed. But his response would show either that he was unco&#8209;operative and </p>
<p>obstructive; or that he was ready to make claims that the inspectors would probably </p>
<p>quickly expose.</p>
<p>“But … there could be no question that the second part of the resolution could </p>
<p>be dispensed with if Saddam’s response to the first part seemed unsatisfactory. </p>
<p>As … [Mr Blair] had told President Bush at Camp David, it was essential that the </p>
<p>resolution stipulated intrusive inspection, and that this was carried out. This was the </p>
<p>only way in which the international community would believe that we were serious </p>
<p>about the UN route. I reiterated forcefully the points you had made at Camp David </p>
<p>about avoiding any impression that the resolution was merely a pretext for quick </p>
<p>military action, or that we were not sincere when we said that our preferred option </p>
<p>was the reintroduction of an inspection regime. However unsatisfactorily Saddam </p>
<p>responded to the first part of the proposed resolution, we were bound to be faced </p>
<p>with a chorus of demands that we should test his response by getting the Inspectors </p>
<p>back into Iraq. It was only after they had reported that we could move onto the </p>
<p>enforcement issue.” </p>
<p><b>490. </b> Dr Rice “pressed” Sir David, who said he:</p>
<p>“… was absolutely clear. We needed the international community behind us; this </p>
<p>meant a resolution that did not appear to be a pretext for military action; and this in </p>
<p>turn meant serious commitment to UNMOVIC inspections. I was confident that this </p>

<p>3.4  |  Development of UK strategy and options, late July to 14 September 2002</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>would be your view. I would check with you as soon as possible. The second part of </p>
<p>the draft resolution was an integral part of the strategy.” </p>
<p><b>491. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David that “‘speaking very frankly’, there was a timing problem”. </p>
<p>The timetable he had set out “risked running well into next year before we could clear </p>
<p>the decks for military action (assuming Saddam’s continued obstruction)”. </p>
<p><b>492. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that the US and UK should refuse to accept the:</p>
<p>“… ideal, but too leisurely, UNSCOM timetable. Once we had a resolution stipulating </p>
<p>the return of the inspectors, we should get teams in quickly to look at carefully </p>
<p>chosen targets. We should insist that they tackled the job right away. [Dr] Blix could </p>
<p>build up to full strength in slower time.” </p>
<p><b>493. </b> Dr Rice also said that the US was looking at giving the inspectors a Security </p>
<p>Council label, which Sir David resisted because it would “look restrictive and alienate the </p>
<p>wider UN membership”. It might be possible to associate the Security Council with the </p>
<p>teams, and that “could be advantageous” if it was “sold” to Russia “as a way of ensuring” </p>
<p>it was “fully consulted and implicated”. </p>
<p><b>494. </b> Dr Rice said she would feed Sir David’s views into the White House debate and </p>
<p>asked for Mr Blair’s views by the end of the day. </p>
<p><b>495. </b> Sir David commented:</p>
<p>“The pressure on Bush to try a quick fix through the ‘material breach ploy’ will be </p>
<p>Cheney’s attempt to rewrite the Camp David conclusions. I pushed back hard and </p>
<p>made it clear that this would not run.”</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Sir David subsequently discussed the issues with Mr Blair who:</p>
<p>“… emphasised the need to play Iraq cleverly. We must look reluctant to use force, </p>
<p>making it clear that we saw the current situation as a challenge to the credibility </p>
<p>of the UN, and to the international community. You [Mr Blair] were increasingly </p>
<p>convinced that, in the end, people would come round to accepting the need </p>
<p>to deal with Saddam, if we had made full and willing use of the UN route. You </p>
<p>were confident that we could get the Security Council behind us once we had </p>
<p>demonstrated clearly that Saddam remained in violation. But if we appeared to be </p>
<p>riding roughshod over the UN or taking it for granted, opinion would be very difficult </p>
<p>to shift. We should move step by step. Once we had a new resolution … we would </p>
<p>be putting the onus on Saddam as Bush wanted. But this would only work if the </p>
<p>Americans resisted the Cheney temptation to go to the UN with what amounted </p>
<p>to a take it or leave it resolution, and with the clear intention of early resort to </p>
<p>military force.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>497. </b> Sir David advised that, despite his prodding, the UK did not know what </p>
<p>President Bush would say in his speech on 12 September. Mr Blair might have </p>
<p>to speak to President Bush again “to try to hold him to the Camp David conclusions”.</p>
<p><b>498.  Sir David subsequently informed Dr Rice that Mr Blair’s position was that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq must be made a challenge to the whole international community through a UN </b></p>
<p><b>resolution which required intrusive inspections; that they were an indispensable </b></p>
<p><b>part of the strategy; and that if the UN route was proposed with real conviction, </b></p>
<p><b>support could be secured.</b></p>
<p><b>499. </b> Sir David spoke again to Dr Rice on the evening of 10 September conveying </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s:</p>
<p>“… very strong view that we must make Iraq a challenge to the whole international </p>
<p>community. We must do so through a UN resolution that … provided for an intrusive </p>
<p>inspection regime. The inspectors were an indispensable part of the strategy. </p>
<p>Saddam would either refuse to let the inspectors back, or he would let them in </p>
<p>but almost certainly obstruct their operations. We should then be in a very strong </p>
<p>position to insist on action. You [Mr Blair] believed that we should deal with Iraq step </p>
<p>by step. We needed to get this resolution under our belt, put the onus squarely on </p>
<p>Saddam, and then decide what to do in the light of his reaction.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>500. </b> Sir David added that it was “essential” that a resolution was put forward:</p>
<p>“… with conviction and made it absolutely clear that we wanted it to succeed. </p>
<p>We should be emphasising at every turn that war was the last resort. The US </p>
<p>Administration would have the worst of both worlds if it appeared to have been </p>
<p>forced reluctantly to choose the UN route, or if it appeared to want a new resolution </p>
<p>to serve as nothing more than a pretext for early military action.” </p>
<p><b>501. </b> Sir David added that it was “increasingly” Mr Blair’s:</p>
<p>“… impression that public opinion would come round if we proposed the UN route </p>
<p>with real conviction. If and when it became clear that Saddam had yet again violated </p>
<p>the will of the UN and the international community, there was a real chance that we </p>
<p>could build wide support for further action. But if we failed to do this, and it appeared </p>
<p>that Washington wanted to go the unilateral route, the international community would </p>
<p>be resistant or hostile to action. Securing wide support would be a great prize, one </p>
<p>that you [Mr Blair] believed was in reach.” </p>

<p><b>503. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that Mr Blair would want to talk to President Bush before the </p>

<p><b>504. </b> Sir David commented to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“There is little doubt that the Cheney counter&#8209;attack, with its wilful distortion of what </p>

<p>that Mr Tariq Aziz had been “casting around for a way out, willing to contemplate the </p>
<p>return of inspectors but apparently genuinely puzzled as to how this could help Iraq if the </p>
<p>inspectors were likely to be cover for spies to indicate Iraqi military targets”. Mr Annan </p>
<p>said he had assured Mr Aziz of Dr Blix’s professionalism and independence.</p>

<p><b>511.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that he would need to make his position clear to </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>512. </b> On 10 September, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell, with officials, met for supper in </p>
<p>New York.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>513. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that President Bush’s speech would not refer to a </p>
<p>resolution but he (Powell) would confirm to journalists that a resolution was the aim. It </p>
<p>would have four key elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “statement that Iraq was in ‘material breach’ of its obligations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq to provide “all information required under [resolution] 687” within 15 days, </p>
<p>and “a declaration of everything they were holding”. There had been a debate </p>
<p>in the Administration about how to respond if Iraq complied. Inspectors “would </p>
<p>have to go in to destroy what Iraq had declared: there [would] be no further </p>
<p>scope for military action. But most in the Administration did not think that Iraq </p>
<p>would respond satisfactorily.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had acknowledged that intrusive inspections were an </p>
<p>“alternative at this stage” and that all necessary means could be in either a first </p>
<p>or second resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Either way, the first resolution would deal with Iraq’s violation of everything apart </p>
<p>from WMD … [T]he President would linger on this kind of thing in his speech.” </p>
<p><b>514. </b> Secretary Powell said:</p>
<p>“It was possible that the US would want to move from material breach to all </p>
<p>necessary means without interim steps, ie without inspectors … [T]there was some </p>
<p>confusion about how the Prime Minister had left things at Camp David, i.e. some </p>
<p>argued that the Prime Minister did not attach priority to inspectors.”</p>
<p><b>515. </b> Using Sir David Manning’s record of the discussions at Camp David, Mr Straw put </p>
<p>Secretary Powell “straight” on the UK position. He stressed that Mr Blair’s “whole focus </p>
<p>was on inspectors: regime change might be an incidental consequence of our policy but </p>
<p>it was not the aim”. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> Secretary Powell said that he had heard that Dr Rice had presented </p>
<p>Sir David Manning with the “declaration of holdings option”; and he implied that was </p>
<p>“with some success”.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Mr Straw said that was the first he had heard of the option and asked whether </p>
<p>it “was a device to avoid inspectors”. The world knew that Saddam Hussein was bad </p>
<p>but not everybody was convinced by the threat he posed; the only way to prove it was </p>
<p>to get inspectors in. Mr Straw was “worried about the motives of those suggesting the </p>
<p>156 </p>
<p>Letter McDonald to Manning, 10 September 2002, ‘Iraq’. </p>

<p>181</p>
<p>declaration alternative. Saddam was intelligent and well advised; he could be coached </p>
<p>into providing a difficult answer.” </p>
<p><b>518. </b> In response to a question from Sir Jeremy Greenstock about whether the US was </p>
<p>genuine about the UN approach or whether it was “a brief effort before the early use </p>
<p>of force”, with the status of inspectors the key difference between the two approaches, </p>
<p>Secretary Powell said that President Bush was not doing this as a fig leaf for war: the </p>
<p>US could not act unilaterally; it needed too much help in the region. Secretary Powell </p>
<p>added that the US needed more than resolution 1284 (1999). If the UN approach worked </p>
<p>and regime change “dropped away”, the US would need a really tough inspection regime </p>
<p>(“Blix plus plus”), not a weak UNSCOM.</p>
<p><b>519. </b> Mr Straw gave an account of Sir David Manning’s telephone conversation with </p>
<p>Dr Rice earlier that day, which Secretary Powell summed up as the UK saying that the </p>
<p>US can’t say “we don’t like the answer [to our declaration demand], we’re going to war”. </p>
<p>Secretary Powell advised that Mr Blair might need to make the importance he attached </p>
<p>to the return of inspectors clear to President Bush.</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Mr Straw sent Mr Blair a separate minute reporting the conversation and </p>
<p>“recommend[ing] strongly” that Mr Blair should speak to President Bush after his </p>
<p>speech “to secure a reconfirmation” of what he had agreed at Camp David.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> Mr Straw </p>
<p>suggested that Mr Blair should also “dismiss” any idea of simply giving Iraq 15&#8209;30 days </p>
<p>to explain the discrepancies the inspectors had unearthed then moving to military action </p>
<p>rather than seeking the insertion of inspectors. </p>
<p><b>521.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that Mr Blair thought President Bush should </b></p>
<p><b>use his speech at the UN General Assembly to make a virtue of going the </b></p>
<p><b>UN route. </b></p>
<p><b>522. </b> Sir David Manning spoke again to Dr Rice at 12.15pm on 11 September.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He suggested that President Bush’s speech needed to expand his concluding sentence </p>
<p>on the role of the UN by announcing he would be proposing a new resolution “within </p>
<p>the next few days”. That would have “immediate impact at the UN and great resonance </p>
<p>in Europe and more widely. At present the speech left us hanging.” It was “at best, only </p>
<p>implicit” what President Bush thought the UN should do.</p>
<p><b>523. </b> In response to a question from Dr Rice, Sir David told her he was “confident” that </p>
<p>was Mr Blair’s view. The President should use the speech to make a virtue of going the </p>
<p>UN route.</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David that President Bush “would probably be ready to do this” </p>
<p>for Mr Blair. </p>

<p><b>The UN General Assembly</b></p>
<p>MR ANNAN’S SPEECH, 12 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>526.  Mr Annan opened the annual debate of the UN General Assembly on </b></p>
<p><b>12 September by re&#8209;affirming the indispensable necessity and enduring relevance </b></p>
<p><b>of multilateralism and multilateral institutions in maintaining international peace, </b></p>
<p><b>security and freedom for all.</b></p>
<p><b>527.  Mr Annan called on Member States to act through the UN adding that an </b></p>
<p><b>effective international security system depended on the Security Council’s </b></p>
<p><b>authority and willingness to act even in the most difficult cases.</b></p>
<p><b>528.  Mr Annan called on Iraq to comply with its obligations and appealed to those </b></p>
<p><b>who had influence with Iraq to encourage it to do so. If Iraq’s defiance continued, </b></p>
<p><b>the Security Council “must face its responsibilities”. </b></p>
<p><b>529. </b> Mr Annan’s address to the General Assembly on 12 September focused on the </p>
<p>arguments for multilateral not unilateral action to address the challenges on the UN’s </p>
<p>agenda and for the full use of multilateral institutions, where all States had “a clear </p>
<p>interest, as well as a clear responsibility, to uphold international law and maintain </p>
<p>international order”.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Annan stated that “only concerted vigilance and co&#8209;operation among all States” </p>
<p>would offer “real hope of denying terrorists their opportunity” and warned:</p>
<p>“On all these matters, for any one State – large or small – choosing to follow or </p>
<p>reject the multilateral path must not be a matter of simple political convenience. </p>
<p>It has consequences far beyond the immediate context …</p>
<p>“The more a country makes use of multilateral institutions – thereby respecting </p>
<p>shared values, and accepting the obligations and restraints inherent in those values </p>
<p>– the more others will trust and respect it, and the stronger its chance to exercise </p>
<p>true leadership.” </p>
<p><b>531. </b> Addressing the role of the Security Council, Mr Annan stated that “when States </p>
<p>decide to use force to deal with broader threats to international peace and security”, not </p>
<p>acting under the inherent right to self&#8209;defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter, there </p>
<p>was “no substitute for the unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations”. Member </p>

<p>States attached “fundamental importance to such legitimacy and the international rule </p>
<p>of law”. They had shown, “notably in the action to liberate Kuwait”, that they were:</p>
<p>“… willing to take actions under the authority of the Security Council, which they </p>
<p>would not be willing to take without it.</p>
<p>“The existence of an effective international security system depends on the Council’s </p>
<p>authority – and therefore on the Council having the political will to act, even in the </p>
<p>most difficult cases … The primary criterion for putting an issue on the Council’s </p>
<p>agenda should not be the receptiveness of the parties, but the existence of a grave </p>
<p>threat to world peace.”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Addressing “current threats to world peace, where true leadership and effective </p>
<p>action are badly needed”, Mr Annan stated:</p>
<p>“… the leadership of Iraq continues to defy mandatory resolutions adopted by the </p>
<p>Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter.</p>
<p>“I have engaged Iraq in an in&#8209;depth discussion on a range of issues, including the </p>
<p>need for arms inspectors to return, in accordance with the relevant Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions.</p>
<p>“Efforts to obtain Iraq’s compliance with the Council’s resolutions must continue. </p>
<p>I appeal to all who have influence with Iraq’s leaders to impress on them the vital </p>
<p>importance of accepting the weapons inspections. This is the indispensable first step </p>
<p>towards assuring the world that all Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction have indeed </p>
<p>been eliminated, and – let me stress – towards the suspension and eventual ending </p>
<p>of the [economic] sanctions …</p>
<p>“I urge Iraq to comply … If Iraq’s defiance continues, the Security Council must face </p>
<p>its responsibilities.”</p>
<p><b>533. </b> Mr Annan wrote in his memoir that concerns had been expressed in early </p>
<p>September about the impact on international law of pre&#8209;emptive action taken by one </p>
<p>state, and that his response had been that support given by the United Nations for </p>
<p>military action would bestow both legitimacy and legality on anything done with respect </p>
<p>to Iraq.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> In his address to the Assembly, he stated: </p>
<p>“…there was no alternative for the legitimate use of force than through a united </p>
<p>Security Council and that there was still time to seek a peaceful way out.” </p>
<p><b>534. </b> Mr Annan added:</p>
<p>“After the meeting I spoke with Tony Blair for whom the process of negotiating a new </p>

<p>PRESIDENT BUSH’S SPEECH, 12 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>535.  In his speech to the General Assembly, President Bush set out his view of </b></p>
<p><b>the “grave and gathering danger” posed by Saddam Hussein and challenged the </b></p>
<p><b>UN to act to address Iraq’s failure to meet the obligations imposed by the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council since 1990. </b></p>
<p><b>536.  President Bush made clear that, if Iraq defied the UN the world must hold </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq to account and the US would “work with the UN Security Council for the </b></p>
<p><b>necessary resolutions”.</b></p>
<p><b>537.  But the US would not stand by and do nothing in the face of the threat.</b></p>
<p><b>538. </b> President Bush’s speech to the UN General Assembly on 12 September focused </p>
<p>primarily on Iraq.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>539. </b> President Bush began his speech by referring to the origin of the United Nations, </p>
<p>stating that the Security Council had been created “so that, unlike the League of Nations, </p>
<p>our deliberations would be more than talk, our resolutions would be more than wishes”. </p>
<p>He stated that security was being challenged by regional conflicts, ethnic and religious </p>
<p>strife, and “outlaw groups and regimes that accept no law of morality and no limit to their </p>
<p>violent ambitions”. The “greatest fear” was that terrorists would “find a shortcut to their </p>
<p>mad ambitions when an outlaw regime supplies them with the technologies to kill on a </p>
<p>massive scale”. </p>
<p><b>540. </b> President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“In one place and one regime, we find all these dangers in their most lethal and </p>
<p>aggressive forms – exactly the kind of aggressive threat the United Nations was </p>
<p>born to confront.” </p>
<p><b>541. </b> President Bush stated that, to suspend hostilities after its invasion of Kuwait in </p>
<p>August 1990, Saddam Hussein had “accepted a series of commitments” and “agreed to </p>
<p>prove” that he was “complying with every one of those obligations”. By “breaking every </p>
<p>pledge”, Saddam had “made the case against himself”. </p>
<p><b>542. </b> President Bush set out the obligations imposed by the UN on Iraq, including that it </p>
<p>should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“cease at once repression of its own people”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“return all prisoners from Kuwait and other lands”;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“renounce all involvement with terrorism and permit no terrorist organisations to </p>
<p>operate in Iraq”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“destroy and stop developing all weapons of mass destruction and long range </p>
<p>missiles and to prove to the world it has done so by complying with rigorous </p>
<p>inspection”.</p>
<p><b>543. </b> President Bush set out Iraq’s failure to meet those obligations. Iraq had “broken </p>
<p>every aspect” of the last pledge, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities that were used for the </p>
<p>production of biological weapons.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN inspections had revealed that Iraq “likely maintains stockpiles of VX, mustard </p>
<p>and other chemical agents, and that the regime is rebuilding and expanding </p>
<p>facilities capable of producing chemical weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continued “to withhold important information about its nuclear program”; </p>
<p>employed “capable nuclear scientists and technicians”; and retained “the </p>
<p>physical infrastructure needed to build a nuclear weapon”. It had “made several </p>
<p>attempts to buy high&#8209;strength aluminium tubes used to enrich uranium for a </p>
<p>nuclear weapon”. If Iraq acquired fissile material, “it would be able to build a </p>
<p>nuclear weapon within a year”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “state controlled media” had “reported numerous meetings between </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and his nuclear scientists, leaving little doubt about his </p>
<p>continued appetite for these weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq also possessed “a force” of SCUD&#8209;type missiles with greater than permitted </p>
<p>range and was “building more … that can inflict mass death throughout the </p>
<p>region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “subverted” the OFF programme “to buy missile technology and military </p>
<p>materials”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite the UN’s demands for the return of inspectors, Iraq had had “four </p>
<p>years … to plan and to build and to test behind the cloak of secrecy”. </p>
<p><b>544. </b> Challenging the United Nations to act, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“We know that Saddam Hussein pursued weapons of mass murder even when </p>
<p>inspectors were in his country. Are we to assume that he stopped when they left? </p>
<p>The history, the logic and the facts lead to one conclusion: Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>regime is a grave and gathering danger. To suggest otherwise is to hope against </p>
<p>the evidence. To assume … good faith is … a reckless gamble … [T]his is a risk we </p>
<p>must not take. </p>
<p>“We have been more than patient … Saddam Hussein has defied all these efforts </p>
<p>and continues to develop weapons of mass destruction. The first time we may be </p>
<p>completely certain he has … nuclear weapons is when … he uses one. We owe it to </p>
<p>all our citizens to prevent that day from coming. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>“The conduct of the Iraqi regime is a threat to the authority of the United Nations, </p>
<p>and a threat to peace … All the world now faces a test, and the United Nations a </p>
<p>difficult and defining moment. Are the Security Council resolutions to be honoured </p>
<p>and enforced, or cast aside without consequence? Will the United Nations serve the </p>
<p>purpose of its founding or will it be irrelevant?</p>
<p>“The United States … want the United Nations to be effective and respected and </p>
<p>successful. We want the resolutions of the world’s most important multilateral body </p>
<p>to be enforced, and right now those resolutions are being unilaterally subverted by </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime …”</p>
<p><b>545. </b> Challenging Iraq, President Bush stated: “If the Iraqi regime wishes peace” it would </p>
<p>act in accordance with its obligations to the UN. He listed those obligations but did not </p>
<p>explicitly mention the obligation to allow weapons inspectors to return.</p>
<p><b>546. </b> President Bush offered the prospect of a new relationship: </p>
<p>“If all these steps are taken, it will signal a new openness and accountability in Iraq. </p>
<p>And it could open the prospect of the United Nations helping to build a Government </p>
<p>that represents all Iraqis – a Government based on respect for human rights, </p>
<p>economic liberty and internationally supervised elections.</p>
<p>“The United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people …</p>
<p>“My nation will work with the UN Security Council to meet our common challenge. </p>
<p>If Iraq’s regime defies us again, the world must move deliberately and decisively to </p>
<p>hold Iraq to account. We will work with the UN Security Council for the necessary </p>
<p>resolutions. But the purposes of the United States should not be doubted. The </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions will be enforced, and the just demands of peace and </p>
<p>security will be met, or action will be unavoidable, and a regime that has lost its </p>
<p>legitimacy will lose its power.”</p>
<p><b>547. </b> President Bush warned:</p>
<p>“Events can turn in one of two ways. </p>
<p>“If we fail to act in the face of danger the people of Iraq will continue to live in brutal </p>
<p>submission. The regime will have new power to bully, dominate and conquer its </p>
<p>neighbours, condemning the Middle East to more years of bloodshed and fear. </p>
<p>The regime will remain unstable … With every step the Iraqi regime takes towards </p>
<p>gaining and deploying the most terrible weapons, our own options to confront that </p>
<p>regime will narrow. And if an emboldened regime were to supply these weapons </p>
<p>to terrorist allies, then the attacks of September 11 would be a prelude to far </p>
<p>greater horrors.</p>
<p>“If we meet our responsibilities, if we overcome this danger, we can arrive at a </p>
<p>very different future. The people of Iraq can shake off their captivity. They can one </p>

<p>day join a democratic Afghanistan and a democratic Pakistan, inspiring reforms </p>
<p>throughout the Muslim world …”</p>
<p><b>548. </b> President Bush concluded:</p>
<p>“Neither of these outcomes is certain … We must choose between a world of fear </p>
<p>and a world of progress. We cannot stand by and do nothing while dangers gather </p>
<p>… By heritage and by choice, the United States will make that stand. And, delegates </p>
<p>to the United Nations, you have the power to make that stand as well.” </p>
<p><b>549. </b> President Bush also made a brief reference to the conflict between Israel and </p>
<p>Palestine, stating:</p>
<p>“… there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. America </p>
<p>stands committed to an independent and democratic Palestine, living side by side </p>
<p>with Israel in peace and security … My nation will continue to encourage all parties </p>
<p>to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement </p>
<p>to the conflict.”</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Dr Rice wrote in her memoir that the speech was intended to remind the audience </p>
<p>of the dangers of Saddam Hussein’s regime and “to put the world on notice that the </p>
<p>United States would act – alone if necessary – to deal with the threat”.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> President Bush </p>
<p>had been “supposed to call for a <i>new</i> resolution … Somehow it had been left out … The </p>
<p>President … immediately noticed the omission and ad&#8209;libbed a line that put the fate of </p>
<p>Saddam into the hands of the UN Security Council.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>551. </b> There was uncertainty in the UK until the last moment about whether President </p>
<p>Bush would announce that the US would seek a new Security Council resolution on Iraq. </p>
<p><b>552. </b> Mr Straw wrote in his memoir that he had “been slipped an advance copy” of the </p>
<p>speech and that he and others had:</p>
<p>“… spotted that the crucial line on working with the Security Council ‘for the </p>
<p>necessary resolution’ had been omitted … I immediately assumed dirty work … But </p>
<p>simple human error … was to blame. Fortunately the President spotted the omission </p>
<p>and ad&#8209;libbed …”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>553. </b> In a handwritten letter to President Bush congratulating him on the speech, </p>
<p>Mr Blair wrote:</p>

<p>of “force alone” was “often futile” and that, in an interdependent world, “Let us take </p>
<p>care that our interventions do not give rise to new frustrations, do not produce new </p>
<p>imbalances and spark fires which we cannot put out.”</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>556. </b> Mr de Villepin stated:</p>
<p>“The case of Iraq is typical of this new situation. It is a country that has defied the </p>
<p>authority of the Security Council and flouted international law for several years. It is </p>
<p>a regime that poses a grave threat to security, particularly the security of the peoples </p>
<p>of its region, because of the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Its </p>
<p>conduct is the direct cause of the great suffering endured by its people.</p>
<p>“Is the international community concerned? Of course it is. Can it continue to tolerate </p>
<p>this situation? Definitely not. Should it act? Obviously: the status quo cannot go on. </p>
<p>France’s determination to obtain compliance with the law is absolute.</p>
<p>“We must act, but we must do so effectively …”</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Mr de Villepin added that action should not “exacerbate” a situation that was </p>
<p>“already very disturbing”:</p>
<p>“We must act, but there are many traps. Intervention that is politically or legally </p>
<p>ill&#8209;defined or poorly mounted would not garner the broad support necessary; it might </p>
<p>galvanise public opinion in the region against it, and the regime in Baghdad which is </p>
<p>isolated now could benefit; lastly, it might aggravate tensions in the Middle East and </p>
<p>beyond at a time when we should … re&#8209;double our efforts to return to the path of </p>
<p>dialogue and peace.”</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Mr de Villepin stated that there was “only one way” to avoid those traps, the path of </p>
<p>“collective responsibility”:</p>
<p>“The necessary measures must be adopted by the international community after </p>
<p>an in&#8209;depth and transparent consideration. Any temptation to engage in unilateral </p>
<p>preventive action would be dangerous. We must take care to avoid any suspicion </p>
<p>of bias or injustice. This is the only way to ensure that any action to enforce law and </p>
<p>restore security does not add to insecurity …</p>

<p><b>wider authority if action was not taken.</b></p>
<p><b>566. </b> Mr Straw’s speech to the UN General Assembly on 14 September focused on the </p>
<p>critical role the UN had to play in world affairs, and the “three rising challenges” of failing </p>
<p>states, terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> He cited the experience with the </p>
<p>International Security Assistance Force working with the UN in Afghanistan as showing </p>
<p>what could be done. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Addressing the threat from proliferation, Mr Straw stated: “Nowhere is the case </p>
<p>for universal support for the enforcement of the UN’s law stronger than in the field of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction.” He added:</p>
<p>“… with one infamous exception – no States have resorted to these, the world’s </p>
<p>worst weapons. </p>
<p>“That exception is Iraq. For two decades, Saddam has defied and frustrated </p>
<p>every attempt to enforce the international rule of law. Iraq is the only country to </p>
<p>be condemned by the United Nations for breaching the Convention on Chemical </p>
<p>Weapons. Iraq has fought two wars of aggression … No country has deceived every </p>
<p>other country in the world as systematically and cynically as Iraq. And no country </p>
<p>presents as fundamental a challenge to the United Nations …</p>
<p>“Every society has to have rules … So those of us who believe in an active </p>
<p>international community cannot stand by and do nothing while Iraq continues to </p>
<p>defy the will of the United Nations. All of us who believe in the United Nations have </p>
<p>to make up our minds now about how to deal with Iraq. The authority of the United </p>
<p>Nations itself is at stake.</p>
<p>“We cannot let Iraq do grave damage to this Organisation and the international </p>
<p>order it represents. We cannot let Iraq go on defying a decade of Security Council </p>

<p>“There are times when hard choices have to be made. On Iraq, we have now </p>
<p>reached such a moment. If we fail to deal with this challenge, the United Nations </p>
<p>will be seriously weakened. And that would make the world a much more </p>

<p>“As President Bush spelled out … we have to be resolute in the face of Iraq’s </p>

<p>the United Nations. We must require Iraq to re&#8209;admit inspectors with unfettered </p>

<p>THE UK GOVERNMENT’S POSITION</p>
<p><b>568.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that he had decided during August 2002 that </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam had to be dealt with; and that the one objective of his meeting with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush at Camp David on 7 September was to persuade President Bush </b></p>
<p><b>to go to the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>569.  Mr Blair described that as obtaining a resolution and giving Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein a final chance to comply.</b></p>
<p><b>570. </b> In his memoir Mr Blair described Iraq, and what the UK was going to do about it, </p>
<p>as, by the summer of 2002, “an insistent and pervasive backdrop”.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> He recorded that </p>
<p>as a result of 24&#8209;hour media:</p>
<p>“Literally every day, stories would appear moving the debate this way and that and </p>
<p>in line with developing patterns of reporting, always hardening speculation into fact. </p>
<p>At times we would not be sure whether we were driving the agenda or being driven </p>
<p>by it. On holiday in France in August 2002, I took a call from George, who was </p>
<p>equally frustrated by the fact that everyone assumed we had made up our mind and </p>
<p>that the march to war was inexorable.” </p>
<p><b>571. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“When I returned from holiday … I also had my lines clear. I was going to be </p>
<p>very tough: we had to deal with Saddam; it was right to do it; we had to send an </p>
<p>unvarnished and plain message to the world.”</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the Camp David meeting had had one objective: </p>
<p>“… to get [President Bush] to go down the UN route, ie to agree that before any </p>
<p>action we would pass a UN resolution and give Saddam a final chance.</p>

<p>192</p>
<p>“This was not an easy sell. The US context … was completely opposite to ours; and </p>
<p>the UN did not play well there. The meeting was a little tense … In the end, one to </p>
<p>one, I got his acceptance … because … ultimately he bought the idea that this was </p>
<p>going to be a whole lot easier if we had a coalition behind us.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>573. </b> In the context of putting Iraq back into the UN system, Mr Blair told the Inquiry, that </p>
<p>he had had “to persuade [President Bush] to take a view radically different from any of </p>
<p>the people in his Administration”.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>574.  Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that it would in his view have been </b></p>
<p><b>impossible for the UK to act in support of the US without “the UN route”, but </b></p>
<p><b>US acquiescence was reluctant.</b></p>
<p><b>575. </b> Asked what thought had been given to the position if President Bush had decided </p>
<p>not to take the UN route, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that his assumption was that </p>
<p>it would have been impossible for the UK to act for two reasons:</p>
<p>“One was that I thought the domestic political position was just impossible … the </p>
<p>other … was it seemed to me legally it would be very, very difficult.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Asked whether the US had fully embraced the UN route, Sir David replied:</p>
<p>“No, I think the description … is we moved them from scepticism to reluctant </p>
<p>acquiescence. I don’t think there was a sudden conversion.”</p>
<p><b>577.  In his memoir, Mr Straw expressed concern that the US Administration </b></p>
<p><b>interpreted Mr Blair’s position in his discussions with President Bush as offering </b></p>
<p><b>the UK’s unconditional support.</b></p>
<p><b>578. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that President Bush’s speech was the critical point at </p>
<p>which the US “committed itself to the strategy which we had been arguing for”, and </p>
<p>“meant that we were embarked on the strategy which, in my judgement could easily </p>
<p>have led to a peaceful resolution of this major dispute and that was fundamental to the </p>
<p>approach of the British Government”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>579. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote: </p>
<p>“… when telling people things they didn’t want to hear, Tony frequently used </p>
<p>ambiguous, elliptical language. I continually worried that Bush heard Tony’s nuanced </p>
<p>phraseology as offering unconditional support. Time and again, on Iraq and the </p>
<p>Middle East especially, Colin told me that this was exactly what he was picking up </p>

<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I arrived at a very interesting transitional phase in this whole story … This was, </p>

<p>following Camp David. The idea that Saddam Hussein would be confronted, that </p>
<p>there would be an approach to the UN in alliance with the US and a justification </p>
<p>would be put into the public domain. All that happened within days of my arrival …”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>582. </b> Lord Turnbull added: </p>
<p>“I think that was a point where a particular strategy coalesced, and at that point </p>
<p>the position of [the] Cabinet Office, the Civil Service generally was: we now have a </p>

<p>“… there was never any opportunity seriously to say, ‘This is the wrong option. </p>

<p>September 2002 that decision had been made …</p>
<p>“… We had agreed, not only what we wanted to do but the Prime Minister … had </p>
<p>agreed with the President of the United States what was going to be done next, and </p>
<p>the idea of formulating [a] single resolution, and you could almost say setting a trap </p>
<p>for Saddam Hussein – the idea of an ultimatum, that was all formulated at around </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>586.  By late August, the UK was proposing coercion of Iraq to disarm by means </b></p>
<p><b>of a UN resolution issuing an ultimatum to Iraq to admit the weapons inspectors. </b></p>
<p><b>In the event that Saddam Hussein refused, or subsequently obstructed, the </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors, the UK was seeking a commitment from the Security Council to </b></p>
<p><b>take action. </b></p>
<p><b>587.  The UK Government’s first objective was to offer Iraq the opportunity and a </b></p>
<p><b>last chance to comply with its obligations and avoid military action. In the event of </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq not taking that opportunity, the UK was also seeking to establish conditions </b></p>
<p><b>whereby military action (should it become necessary) would command multilateral </b></p>
<p><b>support and be taken with the authority of the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>588.  In his public statements, Mr Blair clearly presented the strategy as providing </b></p>
<p><b>a final opportunity for Saddam Hussein to disarm peacefully.</b></p>
<p><b>589.  Reflecting the level of public debate and concern, Mr Blair decided in early </b></p>
<p><b>September that an explanation of why action to deal with Iraq was needed should </b></p>
<p><b>be published. That led to the publication of the Iraq dossier on 24 September. </b></p>
<p><b>He also considered debate on the issue was sufficiently important for both </b></p>
<p><b>Houses of Parliament to be recalled from recess. </b></p>
<p><b>590.  As a result of Mr Blair’s initiative and the subsequent bilateral discussions </b></p>
<p><b>involving Mr Blair, Sir David Manning and Mr Straw, the US Administration was left </b></p>
<p><b>in no doubt that the UK Government needed the issue of Iraq to be taken back to </b></p>
<p><b>the Security Council before it would be able to participate in military action in Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>591.  The UK’s arguments complemented and reinforced the arguments being </b></p>
<p><b>made within the US Administration, particularly by Secretary Powell, that the US </b></p>
<p><b>should not act alone.</b></p>
<p><b>592.  The UK was a key ally whose support was highly desirable for the US.</b></p>
<p><b>593.  That and the force of UK diplomacy undoubtedly made a significant </b></p>
<p><b>contribution to President Bush’s decision in the meeting of the National Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council on 7 September to take the issue of Iraq back to the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>594.  The objective of the subsequent discussions between President Bush and </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair at Camp David was, as Mr Blair stated in the press conference before the </b></p>
<p><b>discussions, to work out the strategy. </b></p>
<p><b>595.  Although at that stage no decision had been taken on which military package </b></p>
<p><b>might be offered to the US for planning purposes, Mr Blair also told President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush that, if it came to war, the UK would take a significant military role. </b></p>
<p><b>596.  When President Bush made his speech on 12 September, the US and UK had </b></p>
<p><b>agreed the broad approach but not the substance of the proposals to be put to the </b></p>
<p><b>UN Security Council, nor the tactics. </b></p>

<p><b>597.  Statements made by China, France and Russia in the General Assembly </b></p>
<p><b>debate after President Bush’s speech highlighted the different positions of the </b></p>
<p><b>five Permanent Members of the Security Council, in particular about the role of the </b></p>

<p><b>the danger that the US might seek to set the bar for Iraq so high that a new </b></p>
<p><b>resolution might not be agreed by the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>598.  Those tensions meant the negotiation of resolution 1441 was complex and </b></p>
