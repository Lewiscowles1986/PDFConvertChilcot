<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the negotiation of resolution 1441 following President Bush’s </p>
<p>speech to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on 12 September, including the </p>
<p>provision of legal advice, and the unanimous adoption of the resolution by the Security </p>
<p>Council on 8 November</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. </b> There were a number of other key developments during this period which are </p>
<p>addressed elsewhere in the Report:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessments of Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction (WMD) capabilities and Iraq’s intentions for their use are set out in </p>
<p>Section 4. The production of the Iraq dossier, published on 24 September 2002, </p>
<p>and the presentation of its contents to Parliament are addressed in Section 4.2. </p>
<p>The subsequent assessments of Iraq’s actions, including its attitude towards the </p>
<p>return of weapons inspectors, are addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The development of options for a possible UK contribution to a US&#8209;led military </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq, and the decision on 31 October to offer ground forces to the US </p>
<p>for planning purposes, are addressed in Section 6.1. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK planning for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq is addressed in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The discussion within the UK Government after the adoption of resolution 1441 about </p>
<p>the legal effect of the resolution, and Lord Goldsmith’s advice on that issue and the legal </p>
<p>basis for military action in Iraq, are addressed in Section 5. </p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declared objective of the US and UK was to obtain international support within </p>
<p>the framework of the UN for a strategy of coercive diplomacy for the disarmament </p>
<p>of Iraq. For the UK, regime change was a means to achieve disarmament, not an </p>
<p>objective in its own right. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The negotiation of resolution 1441 reflected a broad consensus in the UN Security </p>
<p>Council on the need to achieve the disarmament of Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions of </p>
<p>the US and France and Russia, resolution 1441 was a compromise containing </p>
<p>drafting “fixes”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That created deliberate ambiguities on a number of key issues including: the level </p>
<p>of non&#8209;compliance with resolution 1441 which would constitute a material breach; </p>
<p>by whom that determination would be made; and whether there would be a second </p>
<p>resolution explicitly authorising the use of force.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>US/UK discussion of a draft resolution</b></p>
<p><b>4.  The US and UK were in agreement about the objective of securing a UN </b></p>
<p><b>resolution demanding that Iraq should permit the immediate and unconditional </b></p>
<p><b>return of weapons inspectors and setting out the consequences of </b></p>
<p><b>non&#8209;compliance. </b></p>
<p><b>5.  At the beginning of the negotiations, however, there were significant </b></p>
<p><b>differences between the US and the UK about the detailed content of a UN </b></p>
<p><b>resolution and the approach to negotiations with China, France and Russia, </b></p>
<p><b>the other Permanent Members, and with the wider Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> The debate between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and No.10 on </p>
<p>the objectives and terms for a new Security Council resolution on Iraq, between the end </p>
<p>of July and President Bush’s speech to the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on </p>
<p>12 September, are addressed in Section 3.4. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Initial discussion within the UK, and between the UK and US, about the terms </p>
<p>of a draft resolution revolved around seven key issues: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a UN determination that Iraq was in material breach of its </p>
<p>obligations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the demands for Iraq to comply should be limited to WMD (weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction) or address Iraq’s wider failures to meet the obligations specified </p>
<p>in UN resolutions since 1991;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the nature of the ultimatum to Iraq on WMD and whether that should demand an </p>
<p>immediate Iraqi declaration of its WMD holdings, and/or the return of weapons </p>
<p>inspectors; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether to seek more intrusive and quicker inspections than those specified </p>
<p>in resolution 1284 (1999); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether to seek explicit agreement to the use of “all necessary means” in </p>
<p>the event of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance, which would provide explicit authority for </p>
<p>military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>when the UN route would be deemed exhausted and the role of the Security </p>
<p>Council in determining the seriousness of any reported Iraqi breach and in </p>
<p>authorising the use of force; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether to seek one resolution which met all the objectives or to adopt a two </p>
<p>stage approach. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> Resolution 1284 establishing the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection </p>
<p>Commission (UNMOVIC), to replace the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM), was </p>
<p>adopted on 17 December 1999, with China, France, Russia and Malaysia all abstaining.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>UN Security Council resolution 1284 (1999).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>201</p>
<p>The timetable for inspections and the position of UNMOVIC in September 2002 is set </p>
<p>out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>Resolution 1284 (1999) and action to establish UNMOVIC</b></p>
<p>In March 1999, the panel chaired by Mr Celso Amorim, the Brazilian Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN in New York, which was tasked to provide a “comprehensive </p>
<p>review” of UN approaches to Iraq, reported that “although important elements still have </p>
<p>to be resolved, the bulk of Iraq’s proscribed weapons programs has been eliminated”.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nonetheless, some inspections&#8209;based monitoring was needed to prevent rearmament.<i> </i></p>
<p>The timetable set out in resolution 1284 for UNMOVIC and the International Atomic </p>
<p>Energy Agency (IAEA) to start work and report to the Security Council on Iraq’s position </p>
<p>resolution envisaged the inspectors would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“draw up, for approval by the Council, a work programme” not later than 60 days </p>
<p>after they started work in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>report “immediately when the reinforced system of ongoing monitoring and </p>
<p>verification is fully operational in Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>120 days after that, report on whether “Iraq has co&#8209;operated in all respects with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA in particular in fulfilling the work programmes in all the </p>
<p>aspects to suspend sanctions”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The resolution also stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The 120 days would be renewable, subject to the “elaboration of effective financial </p>
<p>and other operational measures” to ensure that Iraq did not acquire prohibited items.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Should the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC or the Director General of the IAEA </p>
<p>report that Iraq was not co&#8209;operating in all respects, sanctions could be renewed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA would remain responsible for nuclear inspections and certification.</p>
<p>As Section 1.1 shows, the resolution was a compromise. Iraq was not required to </p>
<p>demonstrate full compliance, just co&#8209;operation; and co&#8209;operation was not clearly defined. </p>
<p>In addition, there was no certainty of a definitive end to sanctions. For this reason Iraq did </p>
<p>not accept resolution 1284. It apparently hoped that sanctions would be suspended or at </p>
<p>least eroded without it having to do much. </p>
<p>The decision to establish a new organisation to replace UNSCOM reflected allegations </p>
<p>that it had not been impartial and had been used by western intelligence agencies to </p>
<p>spy on Iraq. The intelligence agencies of member states could supply information to any </p>
<p>new body but could not expect to receive any in return.<i> </i>Intelligence traffic would only </p>
<p>be one&#8209;way. Inspectors were to be recruited independently and work directly for the </p>
<p>UN, following UN standards and rules on impartiality and professionalism, rather than </p>
<p>be loaned to the Commission by Member States. UNMOVIC was to be controlled by </p>
<p>a College of Commissioners. </p>
<p>UNMOVIC was funded from Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food (OFF) revenue. </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>UN Security Council, 30 March 1999, ‘Letter dated 27 March 1999, from the Chairman of the panels </p>
<p>established pursuant to the note by the President of the Security Council of 30 January 1999 (S/1999/100) </p>
<p>addressed to the President of the Security Council’ (S/1999/356).</p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>UN Security Council resolution 1284 (1999).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>Dr Hans Blix was appointed as Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC on 27 January 2000. </p>
<p>A junior member of the UK permanent Mission to the UN in New York met Dr Blix on </p>
<p>12 September 2002 for a confidential conversation to explore:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how long it would take UNMOVIC to establish a presence in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how long it would take to be “up and running”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how often it would be realistic for UNMOVIC to report on progress; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what its priorities would be for reinforcing inspections.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The official reported that the practical arrangements for the return of inspectors would </p>
<p>be crucial and would need to be agreed before their deployment. Discussions on the </p>
<p>arrangements should take place outside Iraq, but once agreed an advance party from </p>
<p>UNMOVIC could be in Iraq in a week. UNMOVIC would prefer to have three months to </p>
<p>build up its presence before it “started work as set out in resolution 1284”, but it “could </p>
<p>just about manage two months”. </p>
<p>The 60 days to draw up a work programme was “doable if Iraq co&#8209;operated” but that </p>
<p>deadline could slip; the report would need to be shown to Iraq and approved by the </p>
<p>College of Commissioners. Some inspections could take place within that period; that </p>
<p>would be an early test of Iraqi compliance. There was nothing to stop Iraq providing </p>
<p>UNMOVIC with the backlog of its biannual declarations on WMD. Depending on the </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation it received, UNMOVIC could be “fully operational at the same time as it </p>
<p>presented the work programme”.</p>
<p>The official noted that UNMOVIC already produced quarterly reports and a report every </p>
<p>month was likely to be “too frequent”. Regular reports could help to put pressure on Iraq </p>
<p>and could be used to highlight non&#8209;co&#8209;operation. </p>
<p>Dr Blix had received a suggestion that UNMOVIC be asked to report to the Council </p>
<p>immediately if Iraq was not co&#8209;operating positively. He did not underestimate the </p>
<p>difficulties of annulling the modalities governing access to sensitive sites and had advised </p>
<p>that the Security Council could usefully reaffirm existing rights. Asking UNMOVIC to put </p>
<p>forward suggestions to strengthen inspections would put its independence in doubt.</p>
<p><b>9.  In preparation for a meeting with Mr Blair and following initial discussions in </b></p>
<p><b>New York, Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, set out his thinking on the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>approach to the negotiation of a new UN resolution on 14 September. </b></p>
<p><b>10.  Mr Straw advised that the UK’s objective should be a more intrusive </b></p>
<p><b>inspections regime. If Saddam Hussein complied, that would achieve the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>WMD objectives.</b></p>
<p><b>11.  Mr Straw advocated that the UK and the US should seek only one resolution; </b></p>
<p><b>and that it should incorporate both a demand for the return of inspectors and </b></p>
<p><b>a tougher inspections regime. That would maximise pressure on Iraq to comply </b></p>
<p><b>and avoid giving France and Russia a veto over military action. </b></p>

<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Reporting a conversation with Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National </p>
<p>Security Advisor, at a reception given by President Bush on 12 September, Mr Straw </p>
<p>wrote that he had rehearsed his concerns about a two resolution strategy, “not least </p>
<p>because it was being pushed … by those who wanted a veto on military action and </p>
<p>who wanted to avoid hard choices”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> They had also discussed the possibility of seeking </p>
<p>an Iraqi “declaration” of its WMD programmes. While that might create “something to </p>
<p>do” while UNMOVIC got its teams into place, Mr Straw had said he thought it could be </p>
<p>a “very dangerous proposal”. Saddam Hussein “would be very likely to respond with </p>
<p>a massively detailed document to split the five Permanent Members of the Security </p>
<p>Council (the P5) and international public opinion and buy more time”.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Following his discussions in New York and in preparation for a meeting with Mr Blair </p>
<p>on 17 September, Mr Straw sent a minute to Mr Blair setting out a proposed strategy for </p>
<p>“achieving our objectives through the UN”.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Summarising his views, Mr Straw advised that the UK should:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deliver a more intrusive inspection regime which, if Saddam complies, achieves </p>
<p>our WMD objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demand Iraqi actions not words, within tight deadlines;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>get all we need into a first resolution, without either committing ourselves </p>
<p>[to] or ruling out a second [resolution];</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuade President Bush to commit to the heavy lifting necessary to secure </p>
<p>Russian acquiescence, while we take the lead with the French;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be prepared to run the resolution ourselves if the US agree, since we are better </p>
<p>placed to deliver in the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Straw wrote that President Bush’s speech on 12 September had “transformed </p>
<p>the politics of the issue, at least in the short term”, which “gives us a huge opportunity”. </p>
<p>He added that achieving the objectives would be a “highly complex process” which </p>
<p>would require Mr Blair’s intervention at “crucial moments”, and that:</p>
<p>“US views will carry a lot of weight. But as on many issues, they will need our advice </p>
<p>and tactical judgement to get what they need out of the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Straw reported that he had been assured that President Bush was “serious </p>
<p>about trying intrusive inspections as a means to achieve Iraqi WMD disarmament”. </p>
<p>There were, however, differences of view within the US Administration. Mr Straw was </p>
<p>concerned that there were voices suggesting that any resolution should be loaded “with </p>
<p>impossible demands to ensure the inspectors never get deployed, and to create the </p>
<p>earliest pretext for military action”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Straw was also concerned that others in the Security Council wanted an </p>
<p>approach which would “make it politically impossible to take military action”. It would </p>
<p>be “crucial to avoid both traps”.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Addressing the substance of the issues, Mr Straw wrote that “our own emerging </p>
<p>thinking and that of the US is converging” and the US and UK should seek a resolution </p>
<p>which:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>determined that Iraq had been and was “now in material breach of a … series </p>
<p>of obligations to the Security Council”. That was “designed to provide the </p>
<p>necessary legal cover”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demanded “unfettered access for inspectors, with clear deadlines as a first test </p>
<p>of Iraqi acceptance and a more intrusive mandate”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>included “some provisions on what happens if Iraq fails to comply with the </p>
<p>specific requirements”, but “falling short of authorising ‘all necessary measures’”. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, </p>
<p>judged that was “simply a non&#8209;starter” with China, France and Russia. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Mr Straw provided “an illustrative draft” resolution, which reflected initial discussions </p>
<p>with the US but had not been shown to them. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The draft included elements from each of the options offered by the FCO on </p>
<p>6 September (see Section 3.4). Mr Straw identified a number of issues that would </p>
<p>require political judgements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of the US proposal to challenge Iraq </p>
<p>to produce a full declaration of its WMD holdings very quickly. Mr Straw </p>
<p>thought that was “a bad idea” and that there were “better ways of setting early </p>
<p>deadlines”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How much tougher an agreed inspection regime could be without making </p>
<p>demands which would not be agreed by either the members of the Security </p>
<p>Council or Iraq. The US was “thinking of a provision which would allow [Dr] Blix </p>
<p>to decide what further access he needed to achieve his mandate”. That “would </p>
<p>mean jettisoning previously agreed special arrangements (like exemption of </p>
<p>palaces etc)”. That “would be difficult to negotiate” and Mr Straw did not want </p>
<p>Iraq to reject the resolution because it “could be said to move the goalposts”; </p>
<p>but he favoured trying the approach. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How clear the resolution could be about the consequences in the event of </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance. That would be “the hardest&#8209;fought point in the Security </p>
<p>Council”. As “all necessary measures” looked “unnegotiable”, and the US </p>
<p>would “adamantly oppose a requirement” for a further resolution, the current </p>
<p>US preference was “to stipulate that any failure to comply with the provisions </p>
<p>of the resolution would constitute a further material breach and that Iraq would </p>
<p>be responsible for the serious consequences of that”. Mr Straw took the view </p>

<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>that, while the negotiations should “start tough”: “The final result will almost </p>
<p>certainly be less explicit.” </p>
<p><b>21. </b> Addressing the tactics, Mr Straw wrote that the P5 lunch the previous day had, </p>
<p>in the words of Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of State, been “a good start on securing </p>
<p>a consensus”. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Mr Straw added that France’s approach of two resolutions was “attractive to some </p>
<p>precisely because it postpones any hard choices and gives Russia and France a veto </p>
<p>on military action. I think it a very dangerous idea.” It would postpone hard choices and </p>
<p>give other members of the P5 a veto over military action. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Straw had argued to his Ministerial colleagues that “the tougher and more </p>
<p>complete the first resolution, the greater the chance of Iraqi compliance. Paradoxically </p>
<p>… [a] two resolution approach would make the use of force more likely, because Iraq </p>
<p>would view it as weak.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> Mr Straw wrote that he and Secretary Powell both believed that “we should get a </p>
<p>long way down the road of agreeing the strategy in capitals” with the P5 before putting </p>
<p>any draft text into the Council. They envisaged that, after intensive discussions, the </p>
<p>US and UK would be “in a position to table proposals in the Security Council early in </p>
<p>the week of 23 September”. He also suggested that there might be tactical advantages </p>
<p>in the UK tabling the resolution.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and the Head of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), sent the minute to Mr Blair with his </p>
<p>own comments on a number of points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Jacques Chirac, the French President, would not accept the use of the </p>
<p>phrase all necessary measures “at this stage”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A declaration did not need to precede inspections: it could be pursued in parallel.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK dossier was “designed to show how unsatisfactory absolving palaces </p>
<p>from inspections has proved”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s view that the negotiations should start tough but the consequences </p>
<p>in the event of non&#8209;compliance would be less explicit than agreement to “all </p>
<p>necessary measures” looked “right.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>27. </b> US and UK officials discussed draft resolutions on 15 and 16 September. Mr Peter </p>
<p>Ricketts, FCO Political Director, reported that the main differences between them were; </p>
<p>a US demand for comprehensive declarations and making failure to comply with that </p>
<p>a “casus belli”; detailed proposals for unfettered access for inspectors; and “the ‘all </p>
<p>necessary means’ issue”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>28. </b> Sir David Manning discussed developments with Dr Rice on 16 September.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stated that the position was “very much better … than … eight weeks ago”; and that </p>
<p>Mr Blair was “pleased that the issue was now focused in the UN, where the early signs </p>
<p>suggested the debate was going well”. Saudi Arabia had announced that they would </p>
<p>permit overflights if there was a resolution authorising action. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Sir David Manning reported that he had told Dr Rice:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would consider two resolutions, one dealing with Iraq’s WMD and </p>
<p>one dealing with other aspects of the Iraqi problem, including the restoration </p>
<p>of Kuwaiti property.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was still considering whether to demand that Saddam Hussein should </p>
<p>make a “Declaration about his WMD stocks”. There would be a discussion </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and Mr Straw the following day.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair would be “sympathetic” to the need for an effective and intrusive </p>
<p>inspections regime and the measures to ensure that, such as protection </p>
<p>for UNMOVIC and the role of P5 representatives. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On the question of whether to seek “all necessary means” or accepting language </p>
<p>specifying “serious consequences”, there was the option of falling back on the </p>
<p>Kosovo model (taking independent action if ultimately the UN route failed). It </p>
<p>was the right way forward.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The US and UK Missions to the UN in New York produced a draft “composite </p>
<p>resolution” on 16 September, which Mr Straw and Sir Jeremy Greenstock discussed </p>
<p>with Secretary Powell later that day.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that he had discussed the possibility of an Iraqi letter </p>
<p>agreeing to unconditional access for inspectors with Mr Kofi Annan, Secretary&#8209;General </p>
<p>of the UN, “three times in the last 14 hours”. Mr Annan had made it clear to Iraq that </p>
<p>there would be a new resolution and there was nothing it could do to stop it. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Straw thought that “overall the argument was going well”. Egypt and other </p>
<p>countries were complaining about where an objective of regime change left them, </p>
<p>but: “Saddam Hussein had a choice, either complying with SCRs [Security Council </p>

<p>as a consequence of the international community enforcing compliance.” </p>
<p><b>33. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that the US was looking for a serious response from </p>
<p>Iraq to a required declaration. If it was not serious, “Saddam would clearly be playing </p>
<p>games and that should be considered a casus belli”. The US wanted something which </p>
<p>it could measure, and “to assess Iraqi seriousness before they got rolling on inspectors”. </p>
<p>In his view, Mr Blair and President Bush “needed to talk about the role of a declaration: </p>
<p>there was still some uncertainty in the Administration about what the UK wanted/could </p>
<p>live with”. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Mr Straw replied he “feared” a declaration “could be a trap for us, not Saddam”, </p>
<p>and “a real chance that Saddam would deliver a Rolls Royce reply in order to ‘scatter </p>
<p>his enemies’ … [A] full, final and complete declaration could only be done with the </p>
<p>inspectors.” A declaration could be folded into the process in a different way. The US and </p>
<p>UK should focus on the return of the inspectors and ask for a declaration after practical </p>
<p>arrangements had been agreed but before the inspectors arrived. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Asked what would happen if the declaration was inadequate, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>stated that the Security Council could say the “inspectors would check the points over </p>
<p>which there was disagreement”.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Secretary Powell said that “his hunch” was that Iraq would be forthcoming: </p>
<p>“They would send something which matched what we knew. In that case we could </p>
<p>say we had a ‘serious basis’ for inspectors … If, on the other hand, the Iraqis gave </p>
<p>something thin, there would be no point sending inspectors …” </p>
<p><b>37. </b> Mr Straw thought that Iraq would calibrate its response to satisfy France and </p>
<p>Russia: “We preferred the test to rely less on subjective judgement”. Mr Blair had “been </p>
<p>consistent in giving prominence to the importance of inspections since the Crawford </p>
<p>meeting in April. A declaration would be a diversion from our long&#8209;standing position.” </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell agreed that there were “no real differences” between </p>
<p>the US and UK on the conditions for the inspectors’ return and the modalities for their </p>
<p>operations. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock asked “how fierce the US wanted to be over ‘all necessary </p>
<p>means’”. Sir David Manning’s conversations with Dr Rice seemed to indicate this was </p>
<p>“not an absolute requirement” for President Bush. The US should talk to Russia before </p>
<p>putting it to the Security Council. If the US and UK tried and failed to get Security </p>
<p>Council agreement to inclusion of the phrase, “we would be further back than if we had </p>
<p>not tried at all”. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> Secretary Powell assessed that Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, “wanted </p>
<p>to be on this train” and we could get him “to sign up to most anything”. He reminded </p>
<p>Mr Straw that “the US was going to deliver the French”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>208</p>
<p><b>41. </b> In relation to the preparation of the UK dossier, Secretary Powell said “he was laying </p>
<p>less stress on (disputable) dossiers and more on the fact that Saddam had (indisputably) </p>
<p>violated SCRs for the last 11 years”.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell also discussed whether to produce two resolutions. </p>
<p>Mr Straw “pointed out that … would both fulfil President Bush’s promise and help Villepin </p>
<p>[Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister] off a hook”. The UK preference </p>
<p>was for a second resolution, addressing other problems with Iraq including terrorism, </p>
<p>to be tabled later “so as not to blur the focus on WMD”.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell were reported to have agreed that “we will only get </p>
<p>a peaceful resolution if we prepare for war”. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, sent a separate letter </p>
<p>to Sir David Manning reporting that, at the end of the discussion, Mr Straw and Secretary </p>
<p>Powell had had a private word to discuss US uncertainty about Mr Blair’s position on </p>
<p>the proposal for a comprehensive declaration.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Mr McDonald advised Sir David that </p>
<p>Mr Straw had concluded “we need to incorporate a declaration within our approach but </p>
<p>not in such a way that it can be used as a casus belli”. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Straw also discussed possible resolutions with Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian </p>
<p>Foreign Minister, including whether, if Baghdad offered to allow the inspectors to resume </p>
<p>their work, a new resolution would be needed.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Ivanov warned Mr Straw not to repeat the actions of Operation Desert Fox </p>

<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“The dossier is crucial. The expectations must be right. Remember the case we </p>
<p>need to make is for the return of a tough inspection regime, not that he is about </p>
<p>to launch a strike. In my view, advice to me from the JIC is sufficiently persuasive. </p>

<p><b>return of inspectors and that it was ready to discuss the practical arrangements </b></p>
<p><b>with the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>51.  A subsequent letter from Saddam Hussein made clear that Iraq still saw </b></p>

<p><b>rights under the UN Charter and the need to address all the obligations of both </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq and other Member States in relevant Security Council resolutions, not just </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s disarmament obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>52.  Saddam Hussein declared that Iraq was “totally clear of all nuclear, chemical </b></p>
<p><b>and biological weapons”; and challenged President Bush’s “insinuation” that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>was linked to the attacks on 9/11 and international terrorism.</b></p>
<p><b>53. </b> In a meeting with Foreign Ministers of the League of Arab States on 14 September, </p>
<p>Mr Annan sought their support for the return of inspectors to Iraq as a means to </p>
<p>strengthen peace and stability in the region and to avoid another major conflict.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>also raised the issue in a meeting with Mr Amre Moussa, the Secretary General of the </p>
<p>League of Arab States, and Dr Naji Sabri, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, later that day.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Dr Sabri wrote to Mr Annan on 16 September to inform him that, following the series </p>
<p>of talks between Iraq and the UN in New York and Vienna between March and July 2002 </p>
<p>and the latest round in New York on 14&#8209;15 September, Iraq had decided “to allow the </p>

<p><b>55. </b> Dr Sabri stated that, in taking the decision, the Government of Iraq was responding </p>
<p>to the appeals of Mr Annan, Mr Moussa and those of “Arab, Islamic and other friendly </p>
<p>countries”. The decision was based on Iraq’s “desire to complete the implementation </p>
<p>of the relevant Security Council resolutions and to remove any doubts that Iraq still </p>
<p>possesses weapons of mass destruction”. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Responding to the points in Mr Annan’s statement to the General Assembly on </p>
<p>12 September, the Dr Sabri stated that the decision was:</p>
<p>“… the indispensable first step towards an assurance that Iraq no longer possesses </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction and equally important, towards a comprehensive </p>
<p>solution that includes the lifting of sanctions … and the timely implementation </p>
<p>of other provisions of the relevant … resolutions. To this end … Iraq is ready </p>

<p>The UK should “seek to secure in the first resolution as much as possible of </p>

<p><b>70. </b> The key points of the UK position were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… scepticism. Iraq has a long history of playing games. The … offer comes only </p>
<p>four days after Iraq rejected inspections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Not clear what, exactly, the Iraqi letter amounts to …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Note Iraqi reference to discussion of practical arrangements for inspections. </p>
<p>Iraq must not be allowed to drag this process out. A new UNSCR [UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolution] would need to address this point …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Offer does not make clear that Iraq has accepted our basic demand, namely </p>
<p>to grant inspectors immediate access to any site, building, records, personnel </p>
<p>at any time of UNMOVIC’s choosing …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must keep up the pressure on Iraq. Their latest offer has only come because </p>
<p>the international community has demonstrated its determination to stand firm. </p>
<p>We must continue to do so.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must, therefore, work for a new UNSC resolution …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>History tells us that we cannot trust Saddam’s word. This time, our goal is to </p>
<p>ensure that he complies with UNSC demands.”<b> </b></p>
<p><b>71.  Mr Blair and President Bush decided to continue to pursue a new Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the position on 18 September.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Blair said that they should stick to the strategy. A resolution was needed and </p>
<p>the inspectors must be allowed in to do their job properly. Mr Blair was sceptical about </p>
<p>whether Saddam would comply: “It was obvious that Saddam would play games. </p>
<p>He had only made his offer on inspections … because he felt under pressure.” The </p>
<p>pressure would need to be continued.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed the need for a new inspections regime </p>
<p>that was unconditional and unrestricted. Mr Blair’s view was that: </p>
<p>“This time we must be clear that obstruction would mean military action. This had to </p>
<p>be a disarmament process. There could be no mindset of accepting conditions …”</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Blair stated that, in relation to the overall strategy, Saddam Hussein was “trying </p>
<p>to drag us into a negotiation”, and that the UN route provided the means to deprive </p>
<p>him of the argument that the US would attack him whatever he did. Mr Blair said that </p>
<p>disarmament “would occur, either through inspections or military action” and that the </p>
<p>“choice was Saddam’s”. In Mr Blair’s view, the Iraqi regime “could crack with the arrival </p>
<p>of inspectors”. Keeping up the public pressure would give the international community </p>
<p>“no option but to support us”.</p>

<p>213</p>
<p><b>76.  Iraq welcomed the US decision to act through the UN while emphasising that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s “inalienable rights” should be met and members of the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>should meet their obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>77.  A letter from Saddam Hussein stated that Iraq was “totally clear of all nuclear, </b></p>
<p><b>chemical and biological weapons” and would accept inspections to “achieve, with </b></p>
<p><b>transparency the goal of making sure Iraq no longer possesses … weapons of </b></p>
<p><b>mass destruction”.</b></p>
<p><b>78. </b> In his speech to the UN General Assembly on 19 September, Dr Sabri offered </p>
<p>Iraq’s “condolences to the American people, especially the families of the victims” </p>
<p>of the 11 September 2001 attacks.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>79. </b> Dr Sabri expressed “sincere gratitude” to states and organisations which had </p>
<p>rejected US threats against Iraq and called for “a comprehensive political solution </p>
<p>to the impasse in the relationship between Iraq and the Security Council”. The Iraqi </p>
<p>Government’s decision “to allow the return of UN weapons inspectors without conditions </p>
<p>as a first step towards a comprehensive solution” that included “the lifting of sanctions </p>
<p>imposed on Iraq and the timely implementation of other provisions of relevant Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions”, was a response to the appeals of Mr Annan and others.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Dr Sabri told the Security Council that he had been instructed by Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>to convey excerpts from his letter to the General Assembly, which presented “Iraq’s </p>
<p>position on the latest developments in the relationship between Iraq and the Security </p>
<p>Council”. </p>
<p><b>81. </b> Saddam Hussein welcomed the US decision “for the first time since the end of the </p>
<p>cold war” to put one of its problems to the General Assembly “after years of disregard </p>
<p>of the weight, effect and opinion of others”. But the letter was critical of American actions </p>
<p>on Iraq and its support for Israel. It described President Bush’s speech on 12 September </p>
<p>as presenting “extreme distortions of the so&#8209;called nuclear, biological, and chemical </p>
<p>threats” posed by Iraq:</p>
<p>“… so as to make American citizens believe the deliberate insinuation that Iraq was </p>
<p>linked to the American people’s tragedy of September 11.” </p>
<p><b>82. </b> Saddam Hussein’s letter set out Iraq’s views on US actions and statements, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>“So, after utilizing the American propaganda machine for a long time and spouting </p>
<p>official statements full of lies, distortion, and falsehood, the focus was basically </p>
<p>turned on inciting the American public against Iraq and pushing it to believe the </p>
<p>United States Administration’s schemes of aggression as a fait accompli<b> </b>as if it were </p>

<p>the solution or the necessary rescue that would allow American citizens to live in </p>
<p>security and stability after what they had gone through in the 11 September events.”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Saddam Hussein stated that when the US Administration had realised the necessity </p>
<p>to have:</p>
<p>“… international cover for using force<b> </b>and that the world did not believe the lies it </p>
<p>tried to propagate to link Iraq to the September events, it changed the issue and </p>
<p>began to shed crocodile tears about international law and the necessity to comply </p>
<p>with the resolutions of international legitimacy, alleging that Iraq is not complying </p>
<p>with the Security Council resolutions, especially with regard to … inspectors. This </p>
<p>implied that Iraq had the intention to develop or already possesses nuclear, chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons …” </p>
<p><b>84. </b> Iraq “might give those weapons to terrorist organizations that pose a threat to world </p>
<p>security”.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> After complaining about the “intelligence and espionage” activities of weapons </p>
<p>inspectors in the past and accusing the US of “acting on behalf of Zionism” and wanting </p>
<p>“to destroy Iraq in order to control Middle East oil, and consequently control the politics </p>
<p>as well as the oil and economic policies of the whole world”, Saddam Hussein stated </p>
<p>that Iraq “was, and still is ready to co&#8209;operate with the Security Council and international </p>
<p>organizations”. But it rejected “anyone’s transgression of its rights, sovereignty, security </p>
<p>and independence”.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Iraq had “not rejected the relevant resolutions”, even though they were “unjust and </p>
<p>at odds with the United Nations Charter and international law”. It called on members </p>
<p>of the Security Council to meet their obligations, and demanded that Iraq’s “inalienable </p>
<p>rights” should be met. </p>
<p><b>87. </b> Saddam Hussein declared that Iraq was “totally clear of all nuclear, chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons” and offered to receive “any scientific experts accompanied by </p>
<p>politicians” who wished to see “places and scientific and industrial installations” alleged </p>
<p>to “contain prohibited materials or activities”. He also stated that Iraq had “accepted the </p>
<p>return of inspections teams … taking into consideration the arrangements that should </p>
<p>safeguard” the principles that Iraq’s rights, sovereignty and security should be respected. </p>
<p>That would “achieve, with transparency, the goal of making sure that Iraq no longer </p>
<p>possesses nuclear, biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction”. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> Saddam Hussein stated that Iraq had been:</p>
<p>“… keen to see the issue discussed between the Security Council and Iraq, through </p>
<p>the United Nations Secretary&#8209;General and the representatives of Iraq, with a </p>
<p>view to reaching a balanced formula, based on the principles of the Charter and </p>
<p>the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, within a comprehensive solution </p>
<p>which should bring to an end the cyclone of American accusations and fabricated </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Following two conversations with Dr Rice on 19 September, Sir David Manning </p>
<p>recorded that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… accepts that we should bid high … with a view to being negotiated down to the </p>
<p>sort of resolution … we really want. He is content for us to work for specific mention </p>
<p>of disarmament in the resolution. He is also content for us to work for a compromise </p>
<p>on the question of an Iraqi declaration in parallel with preparations for the inspectors’ </p>
<p>return. He is ready, too, to agree to a formulation that stipulates that UNMOVIC’s </p>
<p>inspection regime must be settled in consultation with the Security Council; and </p>
<p>that we should load this section of the resolution with demands on force protection </p>
<p>for regional bases, participation by the P5 etc., in the knowledge that we shall have </p>
<p>to jettison some of this under pressure from the Russians and French. He has, </p>
<p>however, confirmed that he is not willing to allow references to terrorism to detract </p>
<p>from the force of a resolution. This remains a firm UK red line.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>98. </b> In advance of a planned visit to Moscow on 10 and 11 October, Mr Blair spoke to </p>
<p>President Putin on 19 September.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Blair said that the US decision to take the issue of Iraq to the UN was a </p>
<p>significant and welcome step, but in the light of Iraq’s letter of 16 September: </p>
<p>“… we must hold to our original position: unconditional access for inspectors, backed </p>
<p>by a strong resolution. It was only under pressure that Saddam would move further. </p>
<p>So we had to keep the pressure up.”</p>
<p><b>100. </b> President Putin had agreed that firm action was needed and that we must not lose </p>
<p>time or give Saddam Hussein a breathing space. As a result of pressure, including from </p>
<p>Russia, Saddam Hussein had yielded to an ultimatum. It would be wrong to engage in </p>
<p>a debate about a new resolution until we had seen how the inspectors got on. President </p>
<p>Putin would think further about what Mr Blair had said, and they had agreed that it would </p>
<p>be vital to keep together. There would be further discussions between officials, including </p>
<p>a briefing in London on Iraq’s WMD capability. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> The US produced a draft resolution late on 20 September. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice on 21 September that the draft was “very difficult” </p>
<p>for the UK.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> The risk was that it would be interpreted as a pretext for very early military </p>
<p>action and the UK was:</p>
<p>“… not in the business of manufacturing a casus belli. Only if we were seen to </p>
<p>have tried genuinely to make a success of the inspection route would we be able to </p>
<p>secure support for other action if Saddam blocked us.” </p>

<p>217</p>
<p><b>103.  With President Bush, Mr Blair emphasised the need for the inspectors </b></p>
<p><b>to return to test Saddam Hussein’s intentions.</b></p>
<p><b>104. </b> On 21 September, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the difficulties if the </p>
<p>resolution was too weak and Saddam Hussein outwitted the inspectors so that when </p>
<p>they returned they found nothing.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> They also discussed the need for the draft resolution </p>
<p>to be divided into two: a strong resolution concentrating on WMD – the toughest regime </p>
<p>possible – and a second on non&#8209;disarmament issues. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Blair argued that if Saddam Hussein “messed about with the inspectors, we </p>
<p>must be ready to pull them out and take the appropriate steps. This was not going to </p>
<p>be a re&#8209;run of UNSCOM.” It was likely that “Saddam would get up to his old tricks pretty </p>
<p>quickly”. But “for the moment we must insist that we wanted to make inspections work </p>
<p>so that we could disarm Saddam”. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Blair agreed the need for a quick resolution and the rapid return of inspectors. </p>
<p>They could not wait for another year for the inspectors to do their work. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Campbell recorded that Mr Blair had had to “work on” President Bush in a </p>
<p>conversation that had lasted 30 minutes because the US was “going down an impossible </p>
<p>road again, basically a route that was unsellable”. No.10 was “worried that Rumsfeld </p>
<p>[Mr Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense] and Cheney [Mr Dick Cheney, US Vice </p>
<p>President] were pushing for the idea that we get in conditions that we know Iraq could </p>
<p>not meet”.</p>

<p><b>come to test the negotiability of the US position with France and Russia. They </b></p>
<p><b>also agreed a negotiating strategy which asked for more than the UK thought </b></p>
<p><b>could be agreed.</b></p>
<p><b>110. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Straw discussed the content of the revised draft resolution on </p>

<p>32</p>
<p> They agreed that there were dangers with a proposal for a full, final and </p>
<p>complete declaration of Iraq’s capabilities but the time had come to test its negotiability </p>

<p>threat, the strategic decision that this was a better course than unilateral action was </p>
<p>right. It would be “important to show that we were serious about allowing the UN to </p>
<p>do its business”. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> Following that meeting, Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that Mr Blair and Mr Straw </p>
<p>were “pleased that the new draft resolution focused on the destruction of Iraq’s WMD, </p>
<p>and the regime that would govern UNMOVIC inspections. This was the right place to </p>
<p>be but there was one area of the draft in particular that continued to give us serious </p>
<p>difficulties.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> That was the stipulation that Iraq must make a declaration of its holdings </p>
<p>within 15 days of the passage of the resolution. He and Dr Rice had discussed the </p>
<p>issues many times, including the likely response of other Security Council members. </p>
<p>They discussed the language on that point and in the final operative paragraphs [OPs] </p>
<p>and the regime for inspections.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Reporting the discussions Sir David Manning wrote that he had been assured that </p>
<p>the resolution was not a “trigger” for military action and that he had told Dr Rice that he </p>
<p>expected the discussions on the resolution to be difficult:</p>
<p>“They would be particularly resistant to the reference in OP10 to ‘… authorises </p>
<p>Member States to use all necessary means’. We were very unlikely to get this, even </p>
<p>though we should press it to see how the other Security Council members reacted. </p>
<p>Condi agreed. She said that the Administration was privately prepared to concede </p>
<p>this and settle for something like ‘serious consequences’.” </p>
<p><b>114. </b> Sir David concluded that the UK had “done as much as we can in the last 48 hours </p>
<p>to get the resolution into something approaching a plausible shape”. The UK would now </p>
<p>have to wait to see the reactions to the draft. </p>

<p><b>116. </b> In parallel with the discussions on a new UN resolution, military planning continued </p>
<p>although knowledge was kept to a very tight group of people and the sensitivities about </p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Principal Private Secretary to Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary, wrote to Sir David Manning on 20 September, advising that two issues </p>
<p>needed quickly to be addressed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what potential UK force contribution should be presented to a US planning </p>
<p>conference the following week; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether to replace army units already allocated to Operation FRESCO, the plan </p>
<p>for the Armed Forces to provide cover in the event of a firefighters’ strike, so that </p>
<p>they would be available if a land force contribution was approved.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>119. </b> The MOD proposed that the air and maritime package, with Special Forces </p>
<p>(Package 2), should be presented as a potential UK contribution at the US Central </p>
<p>Command (CENTCOM) planning conference; and that further work was under way on </p>
<p>whether the UK might also offer a Commando Group of around 1,700 Royal Marines for </p>
<p>early operations in southern Iraq, although further work would be needed to establish </p>
<p>whether that could be sustained in parallel with ground operations in northern Iraq.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> The MOD had also considered the provision of a divisional headquarters </p>
<p>together with an armoured brigade to operate with the US (Package 3). That would </p>
<p>be “more complicated”, but the Chiefs of Staff regarded it as the “minimum sensible” </p>
<p>ground contribution to operations in the North. It would entail a commitment of around </p>
<p>28,000 service personnel in addition to the 13,000 in Package 2, and the call&#8209;out of </p>
<p>around 6,000 reservists. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Watkins told Sir David that Mr Hoon felt it would be “premature” to offer </p>
<p>a ground contribution on the same basis as Package 2:</p>
<p>“… we should indicate to CENTCOM that we are still considering this option and that </p>
<p>they should model two plans in parallel, one including the UK land force contribution </p>
<p>and one without it.”</p>
<p><b>122.  Mr Blair and Sir David Manning had reservations about the viability and costs </b></p>
<p><b>of the MOD proposal.</b></p>
<p><b>123. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that: </p>
<p>“The possibility that the military could make a land contribution in the North is </p>
<p>a surprise. Until recently we were being told that covering the firemen’s strike </p>
<p>(Operation FRESCO) would make this impossible. Now, suddenly it isn’t. The </p>
<p>(militarily mouth&#8209;watering) prospect of being given tactical leadership of the </p>
<p>campaign in the North … may have something to do with this volte face.”</p>

<p><b>124. </b> Sir David advised Mr Blair to register “extreme caution” and to address a number </p>
<p>of questions; in particular how this was suddenly possible, the Turkish angle, and </p>
<p>whether the UK could sustain the numbers and, if so, for how long.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Mr Blair commented: “As discussed. Be careful of this Land idea …”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>126.  In a meeting with Mr Hoon on 23 September, Mr Blair agreed limited </b></p>
<p><b>contingency preparations for a land option, but asked for publicity to be </b></p>
<p><b>minimised.</b></p>
<p><b>127.  Following the discussion, the MOD informed the US that the UK was still </b></p>
<p><b>considering a land option. </b></p>
<p><b>128.  That was not the No.10 understanding of what had been agreed.</b></p>

<p><b>23 September 2002,</b></p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b> the Inquiry has seen no evidence to indicate that the </b></p>
<p><b>difference of view about what Mr Blair and Mr Hoon had agreed was anything </b></p>
<p><b>other than a genuine misunderstanding. </b></p>
<p><b>130. </b> Mr Blair discussed the issues with Mr Hoon on 23 September. </p>
<p><b>131. </b> Following that meeting, Mr Watkins informed officials in the MOD that: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is content for us to proceed broadly as set out in my letter </p>
<p>of 20 September. The Prime Minister remains very cautious about the viability </p>
<p>of Package 3, not least because of its implications for our ability to meet other </p>
<p>contingencies and the significant cost premium entailed. In the light of this, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>believes that it is all the more necessary heavily to caveat this possibility in contacts </p>
<p>with the US. We should emphasise that it is at the limits of what we could offer and </p>
<p>that – because of other potential demands on our Armed Forces including FRESCO </p>
<p>– we cannot be sure that we could deliver it. The US must therefore examine </p>
<p>carefully how they would plan the campaign in the absence of such a contribution.”</p>

<p><b>134. </b> Sir David Manning’s record of the meeting on 23 September, issued on </p>

<p>as a potential contribution at the CENTCOM Planning Conference”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> “We should not </p>
<p>be shy about presenting this as a significant and valuable offer.” Units for Op FRESCO </p>
<p>should be re&#8209;allocated to maintain the possibility of a Land Force contribution, with </p>
<p>minimum publicity. Mr Blair did not, however, want “any suggestion” that the UK might </p>
<p>offer “a major land contribution to a Force in northern Iraq. We should not surface the </p>
<p>possibility at the [US] Planning conference.” </p>
<p><b>135. </b> By that time, the MOD had already acted. Mr Hoon’s Private Office replied </p>
<p>to No.10 immediately, stating: </p>
<p>“Separately and heavily caveated, we have indicated to CENTCOM that we are </p>
<p>still considering a Land option … [W]e agreed that the UK involvement … should </p>
<p>continue on this basis. Defence staffs will continue actively to ensure that US </p>

<p>45</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Opening the discussion, Mr Blair told his colleagues that:</p>
<p>“… the dossier on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction would show that the policy </p>
<p>of containment had worked up to a point, but that Saddam Hussein … continued </p>
<p>to rebuild his programme to acquire such weapons. The evidence showed his efforts </p>
<p>to procure equipment and materials, and to restore production facilities. This was </p>
<p>an issue for the United Nations, with whose Security Council resolutions Iraq had </p>
<p>not complied. A new resolution was being negotiated.”</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“It was the threat of military action which had caused Saddam Hussein recently </p>
<p>to invite United Nations inspectors back into Iraq. Only if inspections were thwarted </p>
<p>again would the question of military action arise. Meanwhile, pressure had to be </p>
<p>maintained … We were not at the point of authorising military action now.” </p>
<p><b>144. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“In presenting the case to Parliament … he intended also to stress our commitment </p>
<p>to rebuilding Afghanistan and making progress towards solving the Israel/Palestine </p>
<p>problem.” </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet that “the climate of opinion had changed”. Since President </p>
<p>Bush’s speech to the UN on 12 September:</p>
<p>“Responsibility for dealing with Iraq’s non&#8209;compliance had been placed with the </p>
<p>United Nations. To achieve a peaceful outcome a tightly worded Security Council </p>
<p>resolution was required and maximum support, including for the threat of the use </p>
<p>of force.” </p>
<p><b>146. </b> Mr Straw added that “the nature of the motion to be put before Parliament if military </p>
<p>action became necessary would require consideration”. </p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>147. </b> In discussion a number of points were made:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the accusation of double standards, particularly in respect of dealing with Israel, </p>
<p>would be made, but the … development of weapons of mass destruction by </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein presented a quite different order of threat”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“facing the United Nations with its responsibility for dealing with Iraq provided an </p>
<p>opportunity” for the UN “to achieve success”. Iraq’s “defiance of the international </p>
<p>community needed a firm response”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“promotion of multilateral action through the United Nations and our respect for </p>
<p>international law” gave the UK’s stance “political legitimacy”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“in the event of military action a clear vision was required of the outcome we </p>
<p>wanted in reconstructing Iraq: this would be a major task”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the proportionality of any military action would have to balance the safety of UK </p>
<p>forces with the avoidance of civilian casualties”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact on Muslim opinion in the UK “would need to be managed to preserve </p>
<p>community cohesion”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK had “a clear role to play in overcoming a tendency in the United States </p>
<p>towards unilateralism and in Europe towards anti&#8209;Americanism”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the Middle East needed political impetus, as did other international problems …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the international community had to build confidence in democratic values and </p>
<p>address the causes of terrorism”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“solidarity and resolution backed by the threat of force” would be needed “to </p>
<p>achieve a peaceful outcome”.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that a “crunch point” had been reached:</p>
<p>“The sanctions regime … was being eroded and Saddam Hussein was on the way to </p>
<p>acquiring new capability in weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had to comply with the </p>
<p>obligations placed on it by the United Nations. A tough line was required. If military </p>
<p>action was required, the job could be done. There would be a discussion about the </p>
<p>military options … civilian casualties should be kept to a minimum, but there could </p>
<p>be no doubt that the main beneficiaries of the removal of Saddam Hussein would be </p>
<p>the Iraqi people. Iraq was basically a wealthy country. The international community </p>
<p>had to be committed to Iraq’s reconstruction. Progress also had to be made in </p>
<p>the Middle East which he had stressed in his contacts with the United States </p>
<p>Administration.” </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the UK had to engage with Muslim countries. It also had </p>
<p>to “deal with weapons of mass destruction elsewhere as a growing threat to peace </p>
<p>and security”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>151.  Cabinet was not told about the difficulties in reaching agreement on the </b></p>
<p><b>content of a UN resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>152.  Cabinet recognised that the strategy being pursued would lead to the use </b></p>
<p><b>of military force if Saddam Hussein failed to disarm, but it was not asked to </b></p>
<p><b>address the strategy or to endorse any decision. </b></p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had explained that the dossier “brought together accumulated evidence </p>
<p>about Iraq’s attempts to build WMD, part historical, part intelligence&#8209;based” – </p>
<p>“not saying that he [Saddam Hussein] was about to launch an attack on London, </p>
<p>but we were saying there was an attempt to build a WMD programme in a </p>
<p>significant way”. Mr Blair had “made clear we were still focused on the UNSCR </p>
<p>route and if he doesn’t comply there will have to be international military action”, </p>
<p>and that Saddam Hussein would not comply “unless he thinks the threat is real”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister and Deputy Leader of the Labour </p>
<p>Party, had said that the Cabinet was “in this together” and Mr Blair had “done </p>
<p>a brilliant job of moving the US down the UN route and we should stick with him </p>
<p>and stick together”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, had made “a few long&#8209;term </p>
<p>points for the US, the need to think through post&#8209;Saddam, the importance of the </p>
<p>MEPP [Middle East Peace Process]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Patricia Hewitt, the Trade and Industry Secretary, had suggested that the </p>
<p>Attorney General should come to Cabinet to explain the legal position. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, has said that “if we </p>
<p>are going to have collective responsibility we should have a collective decision”; </p>
<p>there was “no doubt that Saddam was dedicated to possessing WMD but re the </p>
<p>UN there’s a double standard vis&#8209;a&#8209;vis Israel”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had said “he believed it would be folly for Britain to go against the US </p>
<p>on a fundamental policy” and that he “really believed in getting rid of bad people </p>
<p>like Saddam”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had said “the ultimate objective was disarmament and that the </p>
<p>weapons inspectors are a means to an end. The clearer we are that we would </p>
<p>use force, the likelier it may be that we don’t have to.” On “why now?”, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>had said Saddam’s record, his use of WMD and the continued development. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had argued that the US could become unilateralist or it could “be part of </p>
<p>a wider agenda on Africa, MEPP, Afghanistan”.</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr Campbell commented: </p>
<p>“It was a pretty good discussion, though focused as much as anything on the idea </p>
<p>that we were having to deal with a mad America and TB [Mr Blair] keeping them </p>
<p>on the straight and narrow. JP [John Prescott] referred to the idea that TB would </p>
<p>have sleepless nights, that we knew it could go to a difficult choice between the </p>
<p>US and the UN.” </p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Campbell added that the discussion had been “serious and sober and </p>
<p>hard&#8209;headed and TB was in control of all the arguments”: “Funnily enough, I think </p>
<p>TB won the Cabinet over more easily than the public.”</p>
<p><b>156. </b> In his memoir published after the conflict, Mr Robin Cook, Leader of the House </p>
<p>of Commons, June 2001 to March 2003, wrote that only he and Ms Short had “openly </p>
<p>questioned the wisdom of military action”.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> Ms Short had concluded that it was an unjust </p>
<p>war. Mr Cook wrote that for him “the most difficult question was ‘Why now?’. What had </p>
<p>happened in the past year to make Saddam Hussein more of an imminent danger than </p>
<p>he has been any year in the past decade?” Mr Hoon’s attempt to answer that question </p>
<p>by reference to the attack on 11 September 2001 had, in Mr Cook’s view, “only served </p>
<p>to confirm the difficulty of the question” as “no one has a shred of evidence that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was involved” in that attack. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Cook wrote that he had closed his contribution:</p>
<p>“… by stressing the vital importance of getting approval for anything we do through </p>
<p>the UN. ‘What follows after Saddam will be the mother of all nation building </p>
<p>projects. We shouldn’t attempt it on our own – if we want the rest of the international </p>
<p>community with us at the end, we need them in at the start.’”</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Mr Cook also wrote that in summing up the meeting, Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… put rather more stress on the US than the UN. ‘To carry on being engaged with </p>
<p>the US is vital. The voices on both the left and right who want to pull Europe and </p>
<p>the US apart would have a disastrous consequence if they succeeded.’” </p>
<p><b>159. </b> Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from September 2002 to September 2005, </p>
<p>described Cabinet on 23 September as an “important meeting”; the members:</p>
<p>“… weren’t simply listening … They were actually applying their political judgement </p>
<p>and – for the most part supportively, in the direction that the Prime Minister wanted. </p>
<p>“… the only dissension was Robin Cook … Everyone else accepted … that </p>
<p>containment wasn’t working and he was the one person to say he thought it was, </p>
<p>and I am sorry he isn’t around to take the credit for that …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Asked if Mr Cook thought containment was working and could be defended and </p>
<p>sustained, Lord Turnbull replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, but what the Prime Minister was saying was it wasn’t working, it couldn’t be </p>
<p>sustained and we couldn’t take the risk that he [Saddam Hussein] would use this </p>
<p>period to come back at someone.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… there is a slight implication in the way you put that they were just getting a </p>
<p>nice interesting briefing. What was interesting about these occasions was – and </p>
<p>it happens quite rarely – virtually everybody spoke.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Lord Turnbull also stated that Mr Cook had said: “You are overestimating the extent </p>
<p>to which containment has been eroded.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>162. </b> Lord Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury in September 2002, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that Cabinet in September 2002 was a “critical discussion”. His sense was that the UK </p>
<p>was not, at that point, set on a particular course; it was:</p>
<p>“… engaged in a process, where there was strenuous diplomatic activity in order </p>
<p>to bring Saddam Hussein to the table, that we were engaged in a process where </p>
<p>diplomacy was obviously the preferred route and considerable activity in the UN </p>
<p>and in capitals around that …”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Asked whether there had been a debate about different scenarios and different </p>
<p>possible courses, Lord Boateng replied:</p>
<p>“… there was certainly a discussion around different scenarios that came up in the </p>
<p>way in which we addressed these issues in Cabinet …</p>
<p>“… in the September meeting, where, as you know, we were about to publish the </p>
<p>dossier, there was about to be a report to Parliament and there was a discussion </p>
<p>around that and it was a full discussion and, in the course of that, colleagues made </p>
<p>various contributions and various scenarios surfaced. Did we come together at that </p>
<p>meeting in September and say ‘These are the options, what are we going to go for?’ </p>
<p>It wasn’t that sort of discussion …</p>
<p>“What we did have was a full discussion around the issues as they were reported to </p>
<p>us by those … who were obviously most closely involved, and you never got a sense </p>
<p>that debate and discussion were being curtailed, but you also got a sense – and </p>
<p>indeed it was the case – that there were those who were most intimately involved on </p>
<p>a day&#8209;to&#8209;day basis because it fell within their areas of responsibility and competence </p>

<p>referred to.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Asked if, given his estimation that Saddam Hussein was unlikely to back down, </p>
<p>Cabinet understood that beyond the UN route lay the possibility of military action, </p>
<p>Mr Blair said he had been saying that at every Prime Minister’s Questions, and the </p>
<p>Cabinet was fully behind the UN route.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> He added that there were two groups in </p>
<p>Cabinet:</p>
<p>“One group would have been absolutely with me all the way. The other group were </p>
<p>saying: ‘Well … we understand it’s a big problem, but let us try to avoid military </p>
<p>action if we possibly can and the United Nations route is a good way of doing that.’</p>
<p>“All of us knew that at some point there was going to be a moment of truth … where </p>
<p>you had to decide are you seeing it through or are you not …” </p>
<p><b>165. </b> In response to a series of questions about when he sought Cabinet endorsement </p>
<p>for the policy and whether Cabinet was aware that preparations for military action were </p>
<p>under way and that it was taking collective responsibility for the policy, Mr Blair told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the policy was totally clear. The policy was that we were going to deal with this </p>
<p>issue. Our preference is to deal with it through the United Nations but not dealing </p>
<p>with it is not an option.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Of course they were taking collective responsibility for the policy because it was </p>
<p>being outlined the entire time. They know you can’t simply decide one day …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“I would have been astonished if they didn’t [know that military preparations </p>
<p>were under way] because there was discussion of that.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“I don’t think anybody was in any doubt about the course they were on.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… that does not mean to say that there were not some who were saying ‘I wish </p>
<p>we weren’t on this course’, but it really does defy common sense and logic, let </p>
<p>alone the discussion, to think that there were people in the Cabinet who didn’t </p>
<p>know … that we were on a course where the principles of it were absolutely </p>
<p>clear. Go down the UN route, get an ultimatum. If he fails to meet the ultimatum </p>
<p>we are going to be with America on military action … my public comments at the </p>
<p>time. I set it out with crystal clarity at the time. That was our position. It was a </p>
<p>position … I was under a certain amount of criticism for having, but the Cabinet </p>

<p><b>Parliamentary debates, 24 September 2002</b></p>
<p><b>167. </b> Both Houses of Parliament were recalled from recess on 24 September 2002 </p>
<p>to debate the case for effective action in respect of the threat posed by Iraq.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> When he sought the recall of Parliament, Mr Blair wrote that: “Parliament must </p>
<p>and will be at the heart of the national debate on the issue of Iraq and weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”; and that he envisaged a statement from himself followed by “a one&#8209;day </p>
<p>debate on the Adjournment”, led by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>169. </b> The dossier, <i>Iraq’s Weapons of Mass Destruction – The Assessment of the British </i></p>
<p><i>Government</i>, was published on 24 September 2002 (see Section 4.2).</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>170. </b> The Foreword to the dossier written by Mr Blair set out the Government’s position </p>
<p>that “the inspectors must be allowed back to do their job properly”. If Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>refused or “made it impossible for them to do their job” then “the international community </p>
<p>will have to act”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MR BLAIR’S STATEMENT, 24 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>

<p><b>173. </b> Mr Blair’s statement to Parliament on the publication of the dossier on </p>
<p>24 September and the subsequent questions and answers lasted for 90 minutes.</p>

<p><b>174. </b> Mr Blair began by thanking the Speaker for recalling Parliament “to debate the </p>
<p>best way to deal with the issue of the present leadership of Iraq and weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction” and described the dossier as “detailing the history of Iraq’s weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction programme, its breach of United Nations resolutions and its attempts </p>
<p>to rebuild that illegal programme”.</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Addressing the problems encountered by the inspectors, Mr Blair placed the issues </p>
<p>being addressed firmly in the context of: </p>
<p>“… an 11&#8209;year history … of UN will flouted, of lies told by Saddam about the </p>
<p>existence of his chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and of obstruction, </p>

<p>of mass destruction programme is active, detailed and growing. The policy of </p>
<p>containment is not working. The weapons of mass destruction programme is not </p>
<p>shut down; it is up and running now.”</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Blair stated that the dossier disclosing the intelligence assessments provided </p>
<p>by the JIC had been produced because it was “important to explain our concerns about </p>
<p>Saddam to the British people”. The “intelligence picture” painted by the JIC “had been </p>
<p>accumulated over the last four years” and was:</p>
<p>“… extensive, detailed and authoritative. It concludes that Iraq has chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons, that Saddam has continued to produce them, that he has </p>
<p>existing and active military plans for the use of chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>which could be activated within 45 minutes, including against his own Shia </p>
<p>population, and that he is actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons capability.” </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Addressing the content of the dossier, Mr Blair told Parliament that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As well as the chemical agents and pre&#8209;cursor chemicals, growth media for </p>
<p>anthrax and special munitions for the delivery of chemical and biological agents </p>
<p>which were “missing and unaccounted for” in 1998, Iraq continued “to produce </p>
<p>chemical weapons; has rebuilt previously destroyed production plants across </p>
<p>Iraq; has brought dual use chemical facilities; has retained key personnel … and </p>
<p>has a serious ongoing research programme into weapons production, all of it </p>
<p>well funded”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… production of biological agents has continued; facilities formerly used for </p>
<p>biological agents have been rebuilt; equipment has been purchased for such a </p>
<p>programme; and again Saddam Hussein has retained the personnel who worked </p>
<p>on it prior to 1991. In particular, the UN inspection regime discovered that Iraq </p>
<p>was trying to acquire mobile biological weapons facilities … Present intelligence </p>
<p>confirms that it has now got such facilities.” The UK believed Iraq could produce </p>
<p>anthrax, botulinum toxin, aflatoxin and ricin, which “all eventually result in </p>
<p>excruciatingly painful death”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s previous nuclear programme had been “shut down by </p>
<p>the inspectors” and “known remaining stocks of uranium” were “held under </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>supervision” by the IAEA. Key personnel who used to work on the nuclear </p>
<p>weapons programme were “back in harness”. Saddam Hussein had also:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“bought or was attempting to buy” items that could have a use in a nuclear </p>
<p>programme; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“been trying to buy significant quantities of uranium from Africa, although </p>
<p>we do not know whether he has been successful”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s ballistic missile programme was required for the delivery of its chemical, </p>
<p>biological and nuclear weapons, and “a significant number of longer&#8209;range </p>
<p>missiles were effectively concealed from the previous inspectors and remain, </p>
<p>including up to 20 extended&#8209;range SCUD missiles”. In mid&#8209;2001 there had </p>
<p>been a step change in the programme; “development of weapons with a </p>
<p>range of more than 1,000km was well under way; and … hundreds of people </p>
<p>are employed in that programme”. The capability being developed was “for </p>
<p>multi&#8209;purpose use, including with WMD warheads”. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> Mr Blair stated that: “In addition, we have well founded intelligence to tell us </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein sees his WMD programme as vital to his survival and as a </p>
<p>demonstration of his power and influence in the region.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“There will be some who dismiss all this. Intelligence is not always right. For some </p>
<p>of the material, there might be innocent explanations. There will be others who say </p>
<p>rightly that … it could be several years before Saddam acquires a usable nuclear </p>
<p>weapon – though if he were able to purchase fissile material … it would be only </p>
<p>a year or two.”</p>
<p><b>181. </b> In the light of the information he had set out, Mr Blair asked whether the world </p>
<p>would be wise to trust to the “good faith of the current Iraqi regime”. Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Our case is simply this: not that we take military action come what may, but </p>
<p>that the case for ensuring Iraqi disarmament, as the UN itself has stipulated, </p>
<p>is overwhelming. I defy anyone, on the basis of this evidence, to say that that </p>
<p>is an unreasonable demand for the international community to make when, </p>
<p>after all, it is only the same demand that we have made for 11 years and that </p>
<p>Saddam has rejected.” </p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Blair posed, and addressed, three questions: ‘”Why Saddam?”; “Why now?”; </p>
<p>and “Why should Britain care?”.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> On the question “Why Saddam?”, Mr Blair said two things about Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>stood out: “He had used these weapons in Iraq” and thousands had died, and he had </p>
<p>used them during the war with Iran “in which one million people died”; and the regime </p>
<p>had “no moderate elements to appeal to”.</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>231</p>
<p><b>184. </b> On the question “Why now?’”, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I agree I cannot say that this month or next, even this year or next, Saddam will </p>
<p>use his weapons. But I can say that if the international community, having made </p>
<p>the call for his disarmament, now, at this moment, at the point of decision, shrugs </p>
<p>its shoulders and walks away, he will draw the conclusion dictators faced with a </p>
<p>weakening will always draw: that the international community will talk but not act, </p>
<p>will use diplomacy but not force. We know, again from our history, that diplomacy </p>
<p>not backed by the threat of force has never worked with dictators and never will.</p>
<p>“If we take this course and if we refuse to implement the will of the international </p>
<p>community, Saddam will carry on, his efforts will intensify, his confidence will grow </p>
<p>and, at some point in the future not too distant, the threat will turn into reality. The </p>
<p>threat therefore is not imagined. The history of Saddam and weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction is not American or British propaganda. The history and the present </p>
<p>threat are real.”</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr Blair said that Britain should care:</p>
<p>“Because there is no way this man, in this region … could begin a conflict using </p>
<p>such weapons and the consequences not engulf the whole world, including this </p>
<p>country. That … is the reason the UN passed its resolutions. That is why it is right </p>
<p>that the UN Security Council again makes its will and its unity clear and lays down </p>
<p>a strong new UN resolution and mandate. Then Saddam will have the choice: </p>
<p>comply willingly or be forced to comply. That is why alongside the diplomacy, there </p>
<p>must be genuine preparedness and planning to take action if diplomacy fails.</p>
<p>“Let me be plain about our purpose. Of course there is no doubt that Iraq, the region </p>
<p>and the whole world would be better off without Saddam. Iraq deserves to be led by </p>
<p>someone who can abide by international law, not a murderous dictator; by someone </p>
<p>who can bring Iraq back into the international community where it belongs, not … </p>
<p>languishing as a pariah; by someone who can make the country rich and successful, </p>
<p>not impoverished by Saddam’s personal greed; and by someone who can lead </p>
<p>a government more representative of the country as a whole while maintaining </p>
<p>absolutely Iraq’s territorial integrity.</p>
<p>“We have no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Indeed, liberated from Saddam they </p>
<p>could make Iraq prosperous and a force for good in the Middle East. So the ending </p>
<p>of this regime would be the cause of regret for no one other than Saddam. But </p>
<p>our purpose is disarmament. No one wants military conflict. The whole purpose </p>
<p>of putting this before the UN is to demonstrate the united determination of the </p>
<p>international community to resolve this in the way it should have been resolved </p>
<p>years ago: through a proper process of disarmament under the UN. Disarmament </p>
<p>of all weapons of mass destruction is the demand. One way or another it must </p>
<p>be acceded to.” </p>

<p><b>186. </b> Mr Blair also set out the UK’s commitment, following regime change in Afghanistan, </p>
<p>to “stick with” the Afghan people “until the job of reconstruction” was done. He </p>
<p>highlighted the need for “a firm commitment to action and a massive mobilisation of </p>
<p>energy” to get the Middle East Peace Process moving again, to address resentment </p>
<p>in the Arab world that the international community was not pursuing that issue with the </p>
<p>same vigour as addressing the threat from Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Blair’s statement concluded: </p>
<p>“Finally, there are many acts of this drama still to be played out. I have always said </p>
<p>that Parliament should be kept in touch with all developments, in particular those </p>
<p>that would lead us to military action. That remains the case, and to those who doubt </p>
<p>it I say: look at Kosovo and Afghanistan. We proceeded with care, with full debate in </p>
<p>this House, and when we took military action, we did so as a last resort. We shall act </p>
<p>in the same way now, but I hope we can do so secure in the knowledge that should </p>
<p>Saddam continue to defy the will of the international community, this House, as it </p>
<p>has in our history so many times before, will not shrink from doing what is necessary </p>
<p>and what is right.”</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Blair’s statement was followed by questions from the Leaders of both the main </p>
<p>Opposition parties and 24 other MPs. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, said the “key question” was </p>
<p>whether Saddam Hussein had “the means, the mentality and the motive to pose a </p>
<p>threat to Britain’s national security and the wider international order”. Mr Duncan Smith </p>
<p>concluded that Saddam Hussein had the means and mentality. He stated:</p>
<p>“The evidence produced in the Government’s report shows clearly that Iraq is still </p>
<p>pursuing its weapons of mass destruction programme …</p>
<p>“The … dossier confirms that Iraq is self sufficient in biological weapons and that the </p>
<p>Iraqi military is ready to deploy those, and chemical weapons, at some 45 minutes’ </p>
<p>notice.”</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Addressing whether Saddam Hussein had the motive to strike against Britain, </p>
<p>Mr Duncan Smith stated:</p>
<p>“… I believe that it is fair to assume that he has …</p>
<p>“The report shows that Saddam has illegally retained at least 20 Al Hussein missiles, </p>
<p>with a range of 650km, capable of carrying the various warheads that he needs, and </p>
<p>that he is also developing new ones.” </p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Duncan Smith also asked a number of questions, including whether a new </p>
<p>Security Council resolution would be needed to take military action. He concluded it was </p>
<p>“time to act” and: “The matter is now in Saddam Hussein’s hands.”</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Mr Blair responded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need for the new UN Security Council resolution to be “absolutely </p>
<p>clear and unambiguous about what is expected from Saddam and about what </p>
<p>will follow if he does not comply”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would “always act in accordance with international law”.</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, stated that legitimate </p>
<p>questions had not been “adequately answered” either by Mr Blair’s statement or the </p>
<p>dossier, including the role of the House of Commons and “the overriding supremacy </p>
<p>of the United Nations”. In his view, the “notion of regime change” was “ill&#8209;defined” and </p>
<p>would “set a dangerous precedent”. The UK also had to be “clear about the possible </p>
<p>consequences”, including the “longer&#8209;term need for a rehabilitation strategy”. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr Kennedy asked: </p>
<p>“Does the Prime Minister truly believe that, on the evidence published today, </p>
<p>a sufficient case has now been made that both clarifies Iraq’s present capacity, </p>
<p>as well as its intent?” </p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“… yes I do believe the information we published today shows that there is a </p>
<p>continuing chemical and biological weapons programme, and an attempt by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein to acquire a nuclear weapons capability. That is what I believe, and that </p>
<p>is the assessment of the Joint Intelligence Committee – and frankly I prefer its </p>
<p>assessment to the assessment of the Iraqi regime, which, let us say, on the basis </p>
<p>of experience, is not one that should carry a lot of credibility.”</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr William Hague (Conservative) asked:</p>
<p>“Does the Prime Minister recollect that, in the half&#8209;century history of various states </p>
<p>acquiring nuclear capabilities, in almost every case – from the Soviet Union in 1949 </p>
<p>to Pakistan in 1998 – their ability to do so had been greatly underestimated and </p>
<p>understated by intelligence sources at the time? Estimates today of Iraq taking </p>
<p>several years to acquire a nuclear device should be seen in that context … [I]s there </p>
<p>not at least a significant risk of the utter catastrophe of Iraq possessing a nuclear </p>
<p>device without warning, some time in the next couple of years? In that case, does </p>
<p>not the risk of leaving the regime on its course today far outweigh the risk of taking </p>
<p>action quite soon?”</p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“I entirely agree … For the preparation of the dossier we had a real concern not to </p>
<p>exaggerate the intelligence that we had received. For obvious reasons, it is difficult </p>
<p>to reflect the credibility of the information, and we rate the credibility of what we have </p>
<p>very highly. I say no more than that.</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>“… I entirely agree that the danger of inaction … far outweighs the danger of action.”</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru) asked if Mr Blair had “given the United States any </p>
<p>commitment that the United Kingdom would support unilateral action against Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Mr Blair replied that it was:</p>
<p>“… important to recognise that in the event of the UN’s will not being complied with </p>
<p>we must be prepared to take that action. We are not at the point of decision yet, but </p>
<p>no one should be in any doubt that it is important to express very clearly that should </p>
<p>the UN’s will not be resolved through the weapons inspections and monitoring, it has </p>
<p>to be resolved in a different way.” </p>
<p><b>200. </b> Other points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no point in the UN taking charge … again unless we are precise and </p>
<p>clear about what we expect the Iraqi regime to do”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A fresh resolution was needed to focus on disarmament and for the </p>
<p>“international community to reassert its will very clearly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Experience suggested the Americans were “right to be cautious about believing </p>
<p>that it [Iraq] intends to comply”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In fact, I am sure that the regime does not intend to comply at all, although it </p>
<p>may be forced to do so. Therefore, it is important that we make it clear that the </p>
<p>pressure is there all the time. The purpose of any new UN resolution should be </p>
<p>focused on disarmament because that is where the UN has expressed its will </p>
<p>clearly.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… it is perfectly natural to look at the history of Saddam Hussein and what he </p>
<p>has done and to be sceptical about whether we shall be able to get a weapons </p>
<p>inspection regime back in there that will be able to do its job properly.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… in my judgement, if we do not deal with the proliferation of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and their retention by highly unstable states, often with dictatorial </p>
<p>regimes, then perhaps not this year or next, but in the not too distant future, </p>
<p>that problem will explode on to the consciousness of the world. I believe that </p>
<p>passionately, which is why, whatever the issues in relation to Iraq … it is </p>
<p>important to take a stand now and say that, when we have made determinations </p>
<p>on behalf of the international community, we will see them through. If we do not, </p>
<p>the message to Saddam and anyone else will be that they can develop these </p>
<p>weapons with impunity and that the international community lacks the will to deal </p>
<p>with them.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“I have no doubt that if the weapons inspectors are able to do their job and </p>
<p>we are effectively able to disarm Iraq, that will change the whole nature of the </p>
<p>regime. Our ability to do so has to depend on the United Nations being prepared </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“If we cannot get the UN resolution – I believe that we can – we have to find </p>
<p>a way of dealing with this.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We should make sure … that the United States and the international community </p>

<p>strongly; it is an article of faith with me – the American relationship and our </p>
<p>ability to partner America in these difficult issues is of fundamental importance, </p>
<p>not just to this country but to the wider world. Those people who want to pull </p>
<p>apart the transatlantic relationship … or who can sneer about the American </p>

<p>ADJOURNMENT DEBATE IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS, 24 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Blair’s statement was followed in the House of Commons by a nine&#8209;hour </p>
<p>debate. </p>
<p><b>205.  In his speech, Mr Straw focused on the risk that, given his past actions, </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein might “easily” use weapons of mass destruction in the future </b></p>
<p><b>and his “deliberate and persistent flouting of the will of the United Nations”.</b></p>
<p><b>206.  Mr Straw stated that only free and unfettered inspections, backed by a </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council united in its determination to disarm Iraq, offered the prospect </b></p>
<p><b>of dealing with that threat by peaceful means. The paradox in respect of Iraq was </b></p>
<p><b>that diplomacy had a chance of success only if it was combined with the clearest </b></p>
<p><b>possible prospect that force would be used if diplomacy failed.</b></p>
<p><b>207. </b> In his speech opening the debate, Mr Straw stated that it was “about the case </p>
<p>we make for effective action in respect of the threat posed by Iraq”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>208. </b> Mr Straw addressed four issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Is the Iraqi regime the threat that we say it is?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Are there not other countries that have developed equally dangerous arsenals </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Is not the international community guilty of double standards?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Even if Iraq is the danger that we claim, is the threat of force or its use justified? </p>
<p><b>209. </b> Before dealing with the threat posed by Saddam Hussein’s WMD, Mr Straw said: </p>
<p>“… I want to detain the House briefly on another aspect of the Iraqi regime – its </p>
<p>record on human rights. That record speaks volumes not only about the way in which </p>
<p>the regime deals directly with its own people, but with the way in which it would seek </p>
<p>to operate in respect of other countries and territories beyond its borders. Taking </p>
<p>both the threat from Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and its human rights record, </p>
<p>Iraq is in a league of its own – uniquely evil and uniquely dangerous. </p>
<p>“On human rights, no other regime now in power anywhere in the world has </p>
<p>Saddam’s record for brutality, torture and execution as a routine way of life and </p>
<p>as the principal means by which the elite stays in power.” </p>

<p>237</p>
<p><b>210. </b> In relation to other states which might have amassed stockpiles of weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction and could proliferate those weapons, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“It is our hard&#8209;headed judgement that we can best prevent the use of their weaponry </p>
<p>through diplomacy.</p>
<p>“With Saddam Hussein, the diplomatic route has been constantly and consistently </p>
<p>obstructed by his intransigence and duplicity. It has been blocked altogether since </p>
<p>December 1998 leaving us no alternative but to consider other options. Iraq not the </p>
<p>UN has chosen the path of confrontation.”</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Straw added that Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… much greater intent to use … [weapons of mass destruction] Saddam’s is the </p>
<p>only regime in recent history to have used chemical weapons, the only regime to </p>
<p>have been declared in breach of the Geneva protocol on chemical weapons and </p>
<p>the only regime that sees those weapons of mass destruction as an active tool of </p>
<p>regional and internal dominance. As page 19 of the dossier sets out, Saddam is </p>
<p>prepared to use these weapons – they are by no means a last resort.”</p>
<p><b>212. </b> Asked why he was convinced that Saddam Hussein would use weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, except as a suicidal gesture in response to a military invasion when he was </p>
<p>desperate and beaten, Mr Straw replied that there was “no need to look in the crystal </p>
<p>ball for the reason why”. The answer was in Saddam’s record: “He has done it once, </p>
<p>he has done it twice; he can easily do it again.” </p>
<p><b>213. </b> Addressing the question of whether it would be justifiable to use force to deal with </p>
<p>the threat from Iraq, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“The short answer … is yes, provided force is a last resort and its use is consistent </p>
<p>with international law.</p>
<p>“Law … depends for its legitimacy on the values it reflects … But … there will always </p>
<p>be some who reject or despise the values on which the law is based. Against them, </p>
<p>the law has to be enforced, ultimately by the force of arms. But the force used has </p>
<p>to be consistent with the moral and legal framework it seeks to defend.”</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“The UN declaration of human rights and the UN Charter … recognised that … the </p>
<p>ultimate enforcement of the rule of international law had to be by force of arms.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Diplomacy … should always be tried first, but the paradox of some situations – </p>
<p>Iraq is pre&#8209;eminently one – is that diplomacy has a chance of success only if it </p>
<p>is combined with the clearest possible prospect that force of arms will be used </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>if diplomacy fails … We have used all the diplomatic instruments at the disposal </p>
<p>of the United Nations, but, so far, Saddam has rendered them unworkable.”</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Drawing attention to the recent changes in Iraq’s position on the admission </p>
<p>of inspectors, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“This is a pretence at co&#8209;operation, but even this has come about only because </p>
<p>Saddam has at last realised that he faces a clear choice …</p>
<p>“Some assert that the policy of containment has worked. My answer is that </p>
<p>containment, backed by the potential use of force, was broadly working while the </p>
<p>inspectors were able to do their job and the Security Council’s resolve remained </p>
<p>firm. But all the evidence suggests that Saddam has used the past four years … </p>
<p>to break out of his containment and to seek to re&#8209;establish his power. Only free and </p>
<p>unfettered inspections, backed by a Security Council united in its determination </p>
<p>to disarm Iraq, offer the prospect of dealing with the threat by peaceful means.”</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Straw concluded: </p>
<p>“We should all be gravely exercised by the potential use of force … I hope and pray </p>
<p>that it will not come to a use of force. It there is military action, any participation … </p>
<p>will be strictly in accordance with our obligations in international law, and its purpose </p>
<p>would be the disarmament of the Iraqi regime’s weapons of mass destruction and an </p>
<p>end to its deliberate and persistent flouting of the will of the United Nations.</p>
<p>“The choice is Saddam’s … But if Saddam continues to defy the international </p>
<p>community … doing nothing – will be much worse …</p>
<p>“We faced difficult choices over Kosovo, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, but does </p>
<p>anyone now say that we should not have taken action in respect of those countries? </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Abdication of responsibility, and equivocation in the face of evil, led Europe down </p>
<p>a desperate path in the late 1930s. From the ashes was born the United Nations … </p>
<p>But this international order requires law, and law requires enforcement. That is the </p>
<p>issue before us today.”</p>
<p><b>Issues raised in the debate</b></p>
<p>A wide variety of issues were raised, by MPs of all parties, in the course of the debate, in </p>
<p>which 50 backbench MPs spoke. There was a broad consensus about the brutal nature </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein’s regime, and the need for inspectors to return to Iraq and complete </p>
<p>their task. </p>
<p>The points raised included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the level of threat posed by Iraq; and whether that justified military action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of a UN resolution for the legal authorisation of military action and </p>

<p>A number of MPs also protested that the debate should have been held much earlier. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> In his speech closing the debate, Mr Adam Ingram, the Minister of State for </p>
<p>Defence, set out “two critical questions” which Mr Blair and Mr Straw had said had to be </p>
<p>addressed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Had the threat from Saddam Hussein increased?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Should action be taken to address that threat and, if so, what action? </p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr Ingram stated that the dossier demonstrated:</p>

<p>There was “significant evidence” that Saddam Hussein had “brazenly flouted” </p>
<p>UN resolutions “to which he had agreed to adhere”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“continued to produce chemical and biological weapons”;</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>“tried covertly to acquire technology and materials that could be used in the </p>

<p>“recalled specialists to work on his nuclear programme”;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“commenced a comprehensive weapons development programme across </p>

<p>“With such evidence, I am surprised that there are hon. Members who continue </p>
<p>to argue that Saddam Hussein does not now pose an increased threat both to the </p>
<p>stability of the Middle East and on a wider international scale. I fear their opinion </p>
<p>is based more on an entrenched position than on a cool analysis of the facts.” </p>
<p><b>220. </b> Mr Ingram concluded that he had:</p>

<p>241</p>
<p>MR STRAW’S EVIDENCE TO THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE,  </p>
<p>25 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>225.  Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee on 25 September that a new </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council resolution was desirable but not essential.</b></p>
<p><b>226. </b> During his appearance before the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) on </p>
<p>25 September, Mr Straw was asked if existing Security Council resolutions provided </p>
<p>a sufficient legal basis for military action without a further resolution.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Straw referred to his speech the previous day, adding:</p>
<p>“It has never been the case that the only basis of international law [for the use of </p>
<p>force] is an extant resolution. Sometimes some people think it is and it is actually </p>
<p>clear from within the United Nations Charter itself that this is not the case.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… there are various points in the Charter, which is one of the key bases of </p>
<p>international law, where the Charter itself refers to the inherent right of individual </p>
<p>members. So as far as this is concerned, the direct answer to your question is no, </p>
<p>we do not regard it as absolutely essential that there should be another Security </p>
<p>Council resolution. We do regard it as desirable. As to what legal advice we </p>
<p>receive if there is not a Security Council resolution, that frankly depends on the </p>
<p>circumstances at the time …” </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Straw added that the UK did “not regard it [existing resolutions] as an </p>
<p>inadequate basis” for action, but “a clear, new resolution” was “desirable, not least </p>
<p>politically”. But there was “ample power” in the existing resolutions and “ample evidence </p>
<p>of a material breach”. </p>
<p><b>229. </b> Mr Straw emphasised the extent to which Saddam Hussein’s actions “in the last </p>
<p>20 years” posed a unique threat to peace and security.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> The UK approach in relation </p>
<p>to other proliferators was to pursue progress through diplomatic channels for as long </p>
<p>as possible, even if progress was slow, but it was impossible to do that with Iraq. </p>
<p><b>230. </b> When Mr Michael Wood saw the evidence, he reminded Mr Straw that the use </p>
<p>of force required express authorisation by the Security Council, which in turn required </p>
<p>a further decision from the Council, such as a finding of material breach.</p>

<p><b>Discussions between the US, the UK, France and Russia</b></p>
<p><b>231. </b> Following the agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Straw on 23 September, there </p>
<p>were further intensive discussions between the US and the UK in pursuit of agreement </p>
<p>on a draft text which the US and UK might co&#8209;sponsor. That included further discussions </p>
<p>in New York,</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> several telephone calls between Sir David Manning and Dr Rice,</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> advice </p>
<p>from Washington,</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> and telephone calls between Mr Straw and Secretary Powell.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>232. </b> The UK was adamant that Iraqi non&#8209;compliance in relation to the proposed </p>
<p>declaration of its holdings should not itself be a trigger for military action: </p>
<p>“It was essential that inspectors got onto the ground before any irrevocable </p>
<p>decisions were made.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>233. </b> Mr Blair spoke to Mr Annan after the Parliamentary debates on 24 September, </p>
<p>telling him that “a new, strong, clear resolution, focused on disarmament without </p>
<p>extraneous issues, was essential”.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that it “was a critical moment for the </p>
<p>UN and for persuading the US that the UN could deal with these issues”. There were </p>
<p>concerns that Saddam Hussein would play games and the inspectors would not find </p>
<p>any material. </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Speaking about the Parliamentary debate, Mr Blair stated: </p>
<p>“People accepted that the threat had to be dealt with. It was important to </p>
<p>demonstrate that military action was a last resort.”</p>
<p><b>235. </b> A letter from Mr Straw to Mr Blair on 24 September recorded Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock’s concern that the draft “will not be seen as credible, it will be seen </p>
<p>as a pretext”.</p>

<p><b>basis for discussion with other members of the P5 on 25 September.</b></p>
<p><b>237. </b> The detailed text of a draft resolution for discussion with other members of the P5 </p>
<p>was finally agreed in a conference call between Mr Straw, Secretary Powell, Dr Rice and </p>
<p>officials, including Sir David Manning and Sir Jeremy Greenstock, on 25 September.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>238. </b> In the conference call:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was agreed to set the timeline for the production of an Iraqi declaration as </p>
<p>“prior to the beginning of inspections and not later than 30 days of the date </p>
<p>of the resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following a discussion of Dr Blix’s reservations about interviewing Iraqi officials </p>
<p>outside Iraq and concerns that they would be used to seek asylum, Dr Rice </p>
<p>stated that conducting interviews outside Iraq was “a red line” for the US. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was agreed that the resolution should allow Permanent Members of the </p>
<p>Security Council to request representation on the inspection teams. Dr Rice’s </p>
<p>view was that there was “no need to be sympathetic to Iraqi concerns” that that </p>
<p>would be a route for the US and UK to get intelligence for military strikes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Rice said that there was no intention to force inspections but the US wanted </p>
<p>to “signal that conditions were different”. It was “important to have things in the </p>
<p>resolution to discard later”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reflecting UK concerns about US draft language on provisions for No&#8209;Fly </p>
<p>or No&#8209;Drive Zones, which Mr Straw described as looking like “an attempt to </p>
<p>legitimise NFZs” – which was “not necessary for the future and dangerous for </p>
<p>the past” – it was agreed that the draft should distinguish zones for the purposes </p>
<p>of the resolution from the existing No&#8209;Fly Zones.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reflecting Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s concerns that there were “many things in </p>
<p>the text that looked like trip wires”, and that it would be “better to judge Iraq by </p>
<p>its actions not its words”, it was agreed that Iraq should be given a week, not </p>
<p>48 hours, to indicate that it accepted the resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was agreed that it would be better to engage Russia and France “at a political </p>
<p>level” before the French and Russian Permanent Representatives to the </p>
<p>UN “got their hands on the text”. As the US and UK got close to agreement, </p>
<p>senior officials should be sent to Moscow and Paris “to begin the task of selling </p>
<p>the text”.</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, reported </p>
<p>that concerns arising from the vote in the House of Commons the previous day had </p>
<p>been a key factor in achieving compromise.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>241.  President Bush continued to determine the US position.</b></p>
<p><b>242. </b> Dr Rice stated in her memoir that during the negotiations, she had “run </p>
<p>interference” for the State Department:</p>
<p>“… taking up practically every controversy directly with the President rather than </p>
<p>allowing continued haggling among the various agencies. I know that caused some </p>
<p>unhappiness in Defense and within the Office of the Vice President, but the process </p>
<p>was taking long enough at the United Nations; we didn’t need to slow it down with </p>
<p>divisions within our own ranks.”</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Straw wrote in his memoir: </p>
<p>“It was one thing to have President Bush declare in favour of going to the UN. </p>
<p>Turning his twelve words about ‘necessary resolutions’ into a text that could </p>
<p>command a majority in the Security Council, and had teeth, was quite another. </p>
<p>“The first task was to pin down an acceptable draft. Inevitably parts of the US </p>
<p>Government weren’t bothered about securing a consensus in the Security Council. </p>
<p>If the other members of the Council supported it, fine; if they vetoed it, fine too … </p>
<p>The early drafts from the US were unacceptable to us. To resolve this we organised </p>
<p>a six&#8209;way conference call … We made good progress, but there were still some </p>

<p>“Lord Goldsmith stressed the importance of the purpose for which force was used. </p>
<p>Although regime change could not be the objective, it could possibly be the means </p>
<p>by which an objective was achieved (if the only way to disarm Iraq of its WMD was </p>
<p>to change the regime …).</p>
<p>“Lord Goldsmith confirmed that he was satisfied with [the] existing arrangements </p>

<p>stressed that you [Mr Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser] had his full authority to talk </p>
<p>to Lord Goldsmith.”</p>
<p><b>247.  Lord Goldsmith was asked for his advice on the draft US/UK resolution </b></p>
<p><b>on 24 September. He offered oral views to Mr Wood and Mr Grainger on </b></p>
<p><b>27 September.</b></p>
<p><b>248. </b> On 24 September, Mr Wood wrote to Ms Cathy Adams, Legal Counsellor in the </p>
<p>Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, with a copy of the draft resolution which had “now </p>
<p>been largely agreed with the US Government”.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> He stated that Lord Goldsmith would </p>
<p>be “aware of the context and background”. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Mr Wood reviewed the provisions of the draft resolution, focusing on the question </p>
<p>of whether, if it were not possible to agree the current draft text authorising the use of </p>
<p>“all necessary means”, the resolution would provide a legal basis for the use of force in </p>
<p>the event of a breach which was sufficiently grave to undermine the basis or effective </p>
<p>operation of the cease&#8209;fire agreed in resolution 687 (1991) “on the ground that it revived </p>
<p>the authorisation to use force contained in resolution 678”. </p>
<p><b>250. </b> Mr Wood wrote that the Government had “last relied upon this legal basis” in 1998; </p>
<p>and that “The passage of time has not changed the principle”. In his view, if a resolution </p>
<p>could be achieved which contained “an amended version … with ‘serious consequences’ </p>
<p>language it would be an adequate legal basis for the use of force”.</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Mr Wood qualified that view by reference to advice set out by Mr Grainger in </p>
<p>an internal FCO minute, which stated that the military action authorised would be </p>
<p>such action as was necessary and proportionate to remedy a particular breach in </p>
<p>the circumstances at the time.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>252. </b> Mr Wood stated that he “would be grateful for any advice which the Attorney </p>

<p>would constitute a clear statement by the Security Council that Member States </p>

<p>on to say though that the use of force would have to be directed towards securing </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>259. </b> The US and UK began to circulate elements of the draft resolution, which became </p>
<p>resolution 1441, to fellow Security Council members on 25 September.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Following visits to Paris and Moscow by Mr Ricketts</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> and a conversation </p>
<p>between Sir David Manning and Mr Jean&#8209;Marc de La Sablière, Diplomatic Adviser </p>
<p>to President Chirac,</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> it became clear that France and Russia had serious concerns </p>
<p>about the key elements of the draft resolution proposed by the US and UK. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> A perception that the draft text of OP10 implied automaticity for the use of force </p>
<p>was one area of difficulty. As a result, both Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Mr Ricketts </p>
<p>began to consider how the UK should react if, as they had predicted, it proved </p>
<p>impossible to secure agreement to “all necessary means” in a first resolution.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>262. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that there was “a case for not showing too deep a concern </p>
<p>about the need to come back to the Council for a decision”. In his view, the “primary </p>
<p>objective of a first resolution” was to “establish unequivocal powers for the inspectors </p>
<p>and hurdles for Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Sir Jeremy wrote that the US and UK should not “walk away” if the first stage </p>
<p>failed; that would “almost certainly lead to a critical resolution which we would have </p>
<p>to veto”. Instead they should “bear with it to a second stage” when:</p>
<p>“… the chance of persuading the Council to come with us will remain open; and if </p>
<p>they eventually do not, we will be seen to have tried harder, our political case … will </p>
<p>look more objective, and we shall be less likely … to confront a critical resolution.” </p>
<p><b>264. </b> Sir Jeremy also advised: </p>
<p>“There will, of course, be differing views about what constitutes an Iraqi sin of </p>
<p>sufficient gravity to trigger a second resolution authorising force.”</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr Ricketts reported that he had told a US colleague that the UK remained </p>
<p>“absolutely firm on the need for an ‘all necessary means’ authorisation” but it looked </p>
<p>as though “we might well not win the argument”.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> While the shared negotiating priority </p>
<p>was to take a “hard position” on that point to “line up support for the toughest possible </p>
<p>inspection regime”, there was a recognition that “we would have to find a middle way </p>
<p>between our present position and an explicit two resolution approach”. They had agreed </p>
<p>work was needed on a formula which would achieve that. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>268. </b> Sir David reported that he had decided not to get into a detailed discussion </p>
<p>about one resolution or two, although he had said that Mr Blair “remained very firm on </p>
<p>substance and would want to be convinced that the two resolution route would work”. </p>
<p><b>269. </b> Sir David Manning and Dr Rice also discussed what had happened over Kosovo. </p>
<p>Sir David asked for “a note setting out our own views on Kosovo” before he spoke to </p>
<p>Dr Rice the next day. </p>
<p><b>270. </b> Mr Straw discussed French concerns, about “how far a UN resolution should </p>
<p>rewrite arrangements for weapons inspections and ‘automaticity’ of military action”, </p>
<p>with Mr de Villepin on 30 September.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>271. </b> Mr Straw told Mr de Villepin that the “resolution had to be tough enough so </p>
<p>Saddam understood this was his last chance”; and that “a peaceful solution was more </p>
<p>likely to be found through a strong and clear resolution”. The provisions in resolution </p>
<p>1284 were “unsatisfactory, not least on the access to Presidential sites”. </p>
<p><b>272. </b> Mr Straw warned Mr de Villepin that:</p>
<p>“… we had to ensure that Washington could keep on board those within the </p>
<p>Administration who were averse to handling Iraq in the UN. If that required one </p>
<p>resolution, France would still have the option of tabling … another if it did not like </p>
<p>what the US proposed.” </p>
<p><b>273. </b> In Mr Straw’s view, there would be “serious difficulties” without an international </p>

<p><b>274. </b> In a telegram later that day, Sir John Holmes identified a number of underlying </p>
<p>French concerns, including:</p>

<p>that “Western, and French, political and economic interests in the Middle East </p>

<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>275. </b> Sir John commented that the UK should:</p>
<p>“… keep hammering home to the key decision makers [in France] that … a tough </p>
<p>resolution now can really avoid military action – indeed it is the only way to do so – </p>
<p>and thus avoid the consequences they fear … At the same time we must continue </p>
<p>to make the intellectual arguments for action (Why Saddam? Why now? Why does </p>

<p>“work … on persuading the French that the Americans:</p>

<p>framework and therefore the unconditional and immediate return of the inspectors. </p>
<p>A simple, firm resolution showing the unity of the Security Council and the international </p>
<p>community could help achieve that. </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Sir John Holmes reported that the spokesman had also said that a telephone call </p>

<p>approach; and that the French spokesman had quoted the Chinese Prime Minister </p>
<p>as saying:</p>
<p>“… if inspections did not take place, and there was no proof of Iraqi WMD and </p>
<p>no authority for action from the UN Security Council, there should be no question </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s speech to the Labour Party Conference, 1 October 2002</b></p>
<p><b>280.  In his speech to the Labour Party Conference on 1 October, Mr Blair briefly set </b></p>
<p><b>out the arguments for acting in a global partnership, and for the UK to “help shape” </b></p>
<p><b>the new world through its friendship with the US and its membership of the EU. </b></p>
<p><b>281.  Mr Blair also stated that in dealing with a dictator, sometimes the only </b></p>
<p><b>chance for peace was a readiness for war. </b></p>
<p><b>282. </b> Mr Blair’s speech to the Labour Party Conference on 1 October was mainly about </p>
<p>domestic issues, but in his remarks on international relations he focused on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to build “a new global partnership” that moved “beyond a narrow view </p>
<p>of national interest”. That was “the antidote to unilateralism”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The basic values of democracy, freedom, tolerance and justice were shared </p>
<p>by the UK, the US and Europe. But they were “human values”, not western </p>
<p>values and should be used to “build our global partnership” and be applied </p>
<p>in an even&#8209;handed way. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Partnership was “statesmanship for the 21st Century”.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>283. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“Some say the issue is Iraq. Some say it is the Middle East Peace Process. </p>
<p>It is both.</p>
<p>“Some say it’s poverty, some say it’s terrorism. It’s both.</p>
<p>“So the United Nations route. Let us lay down the ultimatum. Let Saddam comply </p>

<p>252</p>
<p>“Sometimes and in particular dealing with a dictator, the only chance for peace </p>
<p>is a readiness for war.” </p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr Blair also set out his goals for the Middle East Peace Process:</p>
<p>“By this year’s end, we must have revived final status negotiations and they must </p>
<p>have explicitly as their aims: an Israeli state free from terror, recognised by the Arab </p>
<p>World and a viable Palestinian state based on the boundaries of 1967.” </p>
<p><b>285. </b> Mr Blair added that “to help shape” that new world, the UK needed to be part of it. </p>
<p>That meant making the most of both the UK’s friendship with the US and its membership </p>
<p>of Europe. In five years in government he had learnt that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the radical decision is the right one”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “right decision is usually the hardest one”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the hardest decisions are often the least popular at the time”. </p>
<p>The “starting point” was not policy, it was “hope”. </p>
<p><b>286.  Public opinion in the US was supportive of President Bush’s position. </b></p>
<p><b>287. </b> In early October, the US Administration was also negotiating the terms of a </p>
<p>bipartisan resolution to be tabled in Congress. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer reported that “the points of disagreement [were] relatively </p>
<p>narrow: no one doubts that inspections will fail, the argument is how hard to try for </p>
<p>international support for the war that will ensue”.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>289. </b> A draft circulated by the Chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee (Senator </p>
<p>Biden) and his Republican counterpart (Senator Lugar) required the President to certify </p>
<p>before using force against Iraq that he had attempted to seek UN approval for action, </p>
<p>and provided for regular updates to Congress on how far allies were assisting the </p>
<p>military effort. It also focused on the WMD threat as the basis for action rather than the </p>
<p>wider failings of the Iraqi regime. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> Sir Christopher reported that the White House was taking an “uncompromising </p>
<p>approach” and had rejected that text. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> Sir Christopher assessed that the Administration was in a strong position, with at </p>
<p>least 70 out of 100 votes for military action in the Senate and a Democrat leadership </p>
<p>which did not want to fight the November mid&#8209;term elections by challenging President </p>

<p><b>a “second” decision of the Security Council would be required before the use </b></p>
<p><b>of force would be authorised. In the light of that, Mr Straw advised a two stage </b></p>
<p><b>approach would be needed for agreement on a first resolution establishing a </b></p>

<p><b>298. </b> In a conversation with Secretary Powell on 1 October, about whether to table </p>
<p>OP10 as currently drafted in the Security Council, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that </p>

<p>resolution but without specifying what would follow if they did not. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Putting the “all necessary means” provision into a second resolution.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Sir David stated: </p>
<p>“There should be no difficulty if Blix [Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC] </p>
<p>notified the Council that Saddam was in breach. It might be more difficult if there </p>
<p>were a series of low level skirmishes between Blix and the Iraqi authorities that we </p>
<p>interpreted as obstruction but that the French or others tried to interpret differently. </p>
<p>In that event, we should have to be very clear and very tough.” </p>
<p><b>301. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush were to discuss the issue the following day. Sir David </p>
<p>asked the FCO for advice.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell at 12.30pm on 2 October and talked him </p>
<p>through proposed language for “the ‘one and a half’ resolutions” they had discussed.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>303. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office subsequently advised Sir David Manning that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK were focusing in the P5 in New York on the arrangements </p>
<p>for inspections in OP5, which would leave “time for the Prime Minister and </p>
<p>President Bush to discuss the most politically difficult point, the consequences </p>
<p>of non&#8209;compliance, in OP10”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was clear that “both the French and the Russians” would “insist that the </p>
<p>Council must take a second decision before the use of force is authorised”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Secretary Powell had “therefore agreed to look at an alternative </p>
<p>two stage approach”, which Mr Blair and Mr Straw had “always seen … as a </p>
<p>possible approach to achieving our overriding objective of getting the inspectors </p>
<p>in to tackle the disarmament of Iraqi WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That “would involve a first resolution establishing a tough inspections regime and </p>
<p>sending a strong signal of the Council’s willingness to authorise the use of force </p>
<p>in the event of Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There “would be a private side agreement committing the French/Russians </p>
<p>to agree the adoption of a short second resolution authorising the use of force </p>
<p>in the event of clear Iraqi violations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To address French and Russian concerns that OP10 as drafted could authorise </p>
<p>the use of force on a trivial pretext, it would be redrafted to “drop the prior </p>
<p>determination that any violation constituted a material breach and the prior </p>
<p>authorisation” for the use of “all necessary means”.</p>

<p>would trigger further Council action”.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>whether Kosovo provided a precedent; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the principles on which a possible side agreement might be based.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>305. </b> Mr Straw recommended that Mr Blair should discuss the case for moving to one of </p>
<p>those options, with President Bush, “to achieve the goal of a much tougher inspections </p>
<p>regime, and putting the onus on the Security Council to pass the necessary second </p>
<p>resolution in the case of non&#8209;compliance or do huge damage to the credibility of the UN </p>
<p>system”. Mr Blair should start with an option whereby the Security Council declared its </p>
<p>readiness, in the event of non&#8209;compliance, to decide whether there had “been a further </p>
<p>material breach of Iraq’s obligations” and “that such a breach” authorised “member </p>
<p>states (or another formula …) to use all necessary means to restore international peace </p>
<p>and security”.</p>
<p><b>306. </b> The FCO did not address the precedent of Kosovo for Iraq. The paper stated only </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“Several Council resolutions on Kosovo warned of an impending humanitarian </p>
<p>catastrophe, and affirmed that the deterioration in the situation constituted a threat </p>
<p>to peace and security in the region. But we argued that military action was justified </p>
<p>as an exceptional measure to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe, </p>
<p>rather than that it was based on any provisions in a resolution.” </p>
<p><b>307. </b> The FCO suggested that a possible side agreement between the parties on the </p>
<p>adoption of a second resolution should be based on the following general principles:</p>
<p>“… where there is information/evidence [reported by UNMOVIC/IAEA] of any Iraqi: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>action/attempts to conceal information related to weapons programmes; </p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>308. </b> Sir David Manning told Mr Blair that the “main issue” for his conversation with </p>
<p>President Bush was the provision for the use of “all necessary means” if Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was found to be in breach of his obligations.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> That “automaticity” went “too </p>
<p>far” for France and Russia. President Bush would “ideally like to dispense” with the draft </p>
<p>OP10, but accepted that was “a political impossibility”. The UK wanted “something like </p>
<p>OP10 to give us legal cover if at some stage we take military action”. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> Sir David added that the FCO letter “identified various possible fixes”, and he </p>
<p>recommended that Mr Blair should persuade President Bush “to go the two resolution </p>
<p>route (you warned that this might well be necessary at last month’s Camp David </p>
<p>meeting)”. </p>
<p><b>310. </b> Sir David proposed language in OP10 that stipulated “in the event of a breach, the </p>
<p>Council will decide to authorise all necessary means”. That conceded the issue would </p>
<p>“have to come back to the Security Council for further decision, so saving Chirac’s face”.</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Sir David advised that, “at the same time”, the US and UK “should insist on </p>
<p>privately pre&#8209;negotiating the terms of a second, follow&#8209;up resolution [with France and </p>
<p>Russia] that would authorise ‘all necessary means’ once a breach is established”; and </p>
<p>that the current draft should not be revised until that had been agreed. That would:</p>
<p>“… not be without difficulties:</p>
<p>–  bringing the French and Russians to pre&#8209;negotiate a tough second resolution </p>
<p>and commit themselves to it;</p>
<p>–  establishing clearly what would constitute a breach and so trigger action: this </p>
<p>will need to be pinned down in advance.</p>
<p>“But there is a chance a deal of this kind can be struck … The French and Russians </p>
<p>may well be reluctant: but if this is the price to avoid early US unilateralist action with </p>
<p>serious long term damage to the Security Council, they may well pay.”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Sir David concluded that if Mr Blair and President Bush could agree, “we can </p>
<p>get on with the business of trying to sell it in capitals and the UN. We now need to </p>
<p>move fast.”</p>
<p><b>313. </b> In a second conversation on 2 October, Mr Straw was informed that President </p>

<p><b>314.  In the first of two conversations with President Bush on 2 October, Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>initially focused on achieving a tough regime for inspections as more important </b></p>
<p><b>than the issue of a two stage approach. </b></p>
<p><b>315. </b> Mr Blair spoke twice to President Bush on the afternoon of 2 October.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>316. </b> In the first conversation, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed their concerns </p>
<p>about the outcome of Dr Blix’s talks with Iraqi representatives in Vienna on 1 October </p>
<p>and that the burden of proof that he had no WMD must be on Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p><b>317. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that the need to ensure a sufficiently strong inspection </p>
<p>regime was “more important than the question of one resolution or two”. The inspectors </p>
<p>should “go in as soon as possible”. </p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Blair set out three options in descending order of preference:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>two resolutions (as set out by Sir David Manning);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “tough resolution keeping open whether a second resolution would be </p>
<p>needed, with others knowing that we would be prepared to act without a second </p>
<p>resolution if necessary. We need not rule out a second resolution, but we should </p>
<p>not tie ourselves to one”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “worst outcome” of requiring a second resolution but not being able to get it.</p>
<p><b>319. </b> In a conversation with Dr Rice between the two discussions between Mr Blair and </p>
<p>President Bush, Sir David Manning pursued the argument for two resolutions.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> He also </p>
<p>suggested that Mr Blair and President Bush should confer about the scale of the deceit </p>
<p>that would require military action: “We would want to establish a ‘pattern of deceit’ rather </p>
<p>than a specific incident as a trigger.”</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Separately, Mr Straw was informed by Secretary Powell that the White House was </p>
<p>interpreting Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush as support for a single resolution </p>
<p>and that some in the US were warning the President about the dangers of being mired in </p>
<p>the UN.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> Mr Straw had talked him through the UK proposals for modifying the existing </p>
<p>resolution which Sir Jeremy Greenstock thought France would agree. They agreed it </p>
<p>was worth trying to get President Bush’s agreement.</p>

<p><b>322.  Mr Blair said that any significant obstruction or discovery of WMD would </b></p>
<p><b>constitute a breach. The inspectors should report the facts and we should make </b></p>
<p><b>the judgements.</b></p>
<p><b>323.  Mr Blair told President Bush that if the UN did not authorise force in the </b></p>
<p><b>event of a breach, the US and UK would still act.</b></p>
<p><b>324.  The issues of what would constitute a breach and who would decide on the </b></p>
<p><b>appropriate action were key issues in the negotiation of the resolution and its </b></p>
<p><b>subsequent interpretation. </b></p>
<p><b>325. </b> In the second conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair proposed that OP10 </p>
<p>should be amended to read:</p>
<p>“Decides that false statements and omissions in the declaration submitted by Iraq </p>
<p>to the Council and failure by Iraq at any time to comply and co&#8209;operate fully in </p>
<p>accordance with the provisions laid out in this resolution shall constitute a further </p>
<p>flagrant violation of Security Council resolutions, and expresses its readiness </p>
<p>to authorise all means necessary to restore international peace and security </p>
<p>in the area.”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>326. </b> In exchange, Mr Blair said the US and UK should “hang tough” on OP5 [the </p>
<p>arrangements for intrusive inspections] and on material breach in OP1. When the </p>
<p>first resolution was passed the US and UK should make clear that, in the event of </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance, “we would expect the Security Council to authorise the use of force”. If </p>
<p>for any reason it were not to do so, “we would go ahead anyway, on the Kosovo model”. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also discussed what would constitute a breach and </p>
<p>who would decide. </p>
<p><b>328. </b> Mr Blair said that if Iraq declared it had no WMD and the inspectors then found a </p>
<p>significant amount, it “would be a casus belli”; any significant obstruction or discovery of </p>
<p>WMD would constitute a breach. That was not a judgement for Dr Blix; “the inspectors </p>
<p>should report the facts, and we should make the judgements”. </p>
<p><b>329. </b> In a subsequent telephone call Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that he and Dr Rice </p>
<p>were about to discuss the UK proposal.</p>

<p>done on it”.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>331. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair and Mr Straw had had “a very difficult meeting </p>

<p>war at all, China “didn’t care, and Russia was playing hardball”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>332. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the US “wanted one resolution that would allow them to hit </p>
<p>Iraq at the first sign of Saddam lying or causing trouble”. Mr Blair had described his first </p>
<p>conversation with President Bush as “difficult”. President Bush was “beginning to wonder </p>
<p>whether we are going down the right road”. Mr Campbell wrote that the US was “getting </p>
<p>more and more impatient”.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that President Clinton’s references to Iraq in his speech </p>
<p>to the Labour Party Conference were intended to convey the view that Mr Blair “was </p>
<p>in a position to influence US policy” and to get President Bush “to side with [Secretary] </p>
<p>Powell”. But Mr Blair was “less confident we could get the tough resolution we wanted”. </p>
<p>President Bush had told Mr Blair that he was “having trouble holding on to my horse”. </p>
<p>Mr Campbell wrote it was clear that President Bush was trying to get Mr Blair “to agree </p>
<p>that if Saddam was found to be lying that was a ‘<i>casus belli’ </i>”.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Following the second conversation between Mr Blair and President Bush, </p>
<p>Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair was concerned that rhetoric aimed at managing the </p>
<p>Republican right wing would stop President Bush getting to the right policy positions; </p>
<p>and that Mr Blair “seemed to be moving to the view that this [the US Administration] </p>
<p>was a government that was ruthless about its own power and position”.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that in his first conversation with President Bush, </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s mind was on the Labour Party Conference and he:</p>

<p>“There then followed an extraordinary five&#8209;week period in which not just every </p>

<p><b>Continuing difficulties in securing agreement on a draft text</b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s rebuttal of the UK dossier</b></p>
<p><b>337. </b> The Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs published a “detailed rebuttal” on 2 October, </p>
<p>which described the UK dossier as “a series of lies and empty propaganda” which was </p>
<p>“totally inconsistent” with the facts and reports made by UNSCOM and the International </p>
<p>Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>338. </b> The rebuttal emphasised Iraq’s “intensive efforts” and co&#8209;operation between 1991 </p>
<p>and 1998 in implementing resolution 687 (1991) and other resolutions. It also stated that </p>
<p>Iraq had not imported any prohibited material. </p>
<p><b>339. </b> Detailed comments on Iraq’s rebuttal are set out in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, told Sir David Manning that a </p>
<p>review of the rebuttal conducted by the Assessments Staff, the intelligence agencies </p>
<p>and the FCO dismissed it as: “In broad terms … very weak; long on rhetoric and short </p>
<p>on detail.” It did not undermine the UK dossier and in a number of key areas failed to </p>
<p>provide a credible response.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Mr Miller added that the document presented “a somewhat rosy picture” of Iraq’s </p>
<p>relationship with UNSCOM. He characterised Iraq’s refutation of the UK “claim that its </p>
<p>WMD programmes have continued post 1998” as an “attitude of denial”. </p>
<p><b>342. </b> Under the heading “Iraq: Still Playing Games”, press lines prepared by the </p>
<p>Communications and Information Centre (CIC) focused on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s pre&#8209;1998 co&#8209;operation with UNSCOM and its failures: </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>to provide full and comprehensive disclosures; </p>
<p>{</p>

<p>to allow the inspectors immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access </p>
<p>to relevant sites, documents and persons; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>material for which UNSCOM had been unable account. </p>
<p><b>343. </b> Mr Miller concluded: “I do not think we need to offer a fuller reply to any </p>
<p>of Iraq’s claims.” </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Iraq’s explicit denials of possession of prohibited weapons, materials and </p>
<p>programmes were not addressed, and there was no consideration of the risk which </p>

<p><b>346. </b> Dr Blix and Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, held separate </p>
<p>talks with Iraqi officials about the practical arrangements for inspections in Vienna on </p>
<p>30 September and 1 October.</p>

<p>He had also stated that, since promising on 16 September to allow the </p>
<p>unconditional return of inspectors, Iraq had fired on coalition aircraft 67 times </p>
<p>with the clear inference that Iraq was threatening US interests. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A White House spokesman had stated that “regime change is welcome whatever </p>

<p>“substantially less” than the cost of military action.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>352. </b> The FCO instructed Sir Jeremy Greenstock to use Dr Blix’s report to the Security </p>
<p>Council on 3 October to emphasise that key issues remained to be resolved and a new </p>
<p>resolution was “essential to demonstrate that the UNSC is determined to ensure proper </p>
<p>inspections this time, backed up by the will to enforce its decisions if necessary”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In an interview for the <i>BBC’s</i> <i>Today</i> programme on 1 October, Mr Blair had stated that a </p>
<p>tougher resolution was necessary before the inspectors returned.</p>
<p><b>353. </b> While recognising that Member States could not dictate the inspectors’ activities, </p>
<p>the UK was concerned that inspectors should not return to Iraq before “new modalities” </p>
<p>had been agreed.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Dr Blix’s view, as expressed to the Security </p>
<p>Council on 3 October, was that, while it would be helpful to reaffirm and strengthen </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s rights, there was no legal need for a new resolution before the inspectors </p>
<p>returned.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> His “main concern” was “unanimity and a Council willingness to back </p>
<p>inspectors up”. If there was going to be a new resolution there would be no point in </p>
<p>returning to Iraq only for new arrangements then to be put in place. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Council that a further resolution was necessary </p>
<p>to ensure the inspectors were effective. Iraq was continuing to take measures to conceal </p>
<p>its WMD facilities and stocks. The Council needed to hear from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei </p>
<p>what additional measures were required and it would be prudent to tie up loose ends – </p>
<p>“one man’s loose end could be another man’s casus belli”. </p>
<p><b>356. </b> The agreement reached in Vienna was set out in a letter of 8 October from Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Dr ElBaradei to the Government of Iraq.</p>

<p> It was subsequently endorsed by the </p>

<p>“In our view, a text along these lines would require a further Security Council </p>

<p><b>360. </b> The FCO also stated:</p>
<p>“There would, of course, be … argument about the extent to which any Iraqi </p>
<p>transgression constituted a flagrant violation. It would therefore be important to </p>

<p>either be through a side agreement with them containing an indication of the </p>
<p>circumstances in which we would want to seek authorisation on the lines described </p>
<p>in the paper enclosed with my letter … of 2 October. It could also be useful to agree </p>
<p>on a contingency basis among the P5 the text of a second resolution.” </p>
<p><b>361. </b> Sir David Manning discussed the draft resolution with Dr Rice on 3 October, </p>
<p>pointing out that it “did not rule out military action if there were no further Security </p>

<p>to take a view on it.”</p>

<p>to February because then the ‘window of war’ would close”.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>363.  Mr Ricketts advised that failure to obtain a second resolution was likely </b></p>

<p><b>365. </b> In a minute on 3 October to Mr Straw’s Private Office, which was sent to Sir David </p>

<p>of OP10 … we have conceded the principle that a second resolution is required.”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>added: “If we do not for some reason get it, it must be very likely that the Attorney would </p>
<p>conclude that [the UK] did not have a legal basis for military action.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>382. </b> President Bush used a speech in Cincinnati on 7 October to set out in detail the </p>
<p>case for urgent action to disarm Iraq.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>383. </b> President Bush described Iraq as “a grave threat to peace” and stated that the US </p>
<p>was determined “to lead the world in confronting that threat”. Members of Congress and </p>
<p>the Security Council agreed that Saddam Hussein was a threat and “must disarm”; the </p>
<p>question was how best that could be achieved.</p>
<p><b>384. </b> President Bush stated that the US Administration had “discussed broadly and fully” </p>
<p>the nature of the threat and the urgency of action. The threat from Iraq stood “alone” </p>
<p>because it gathered “the most serious dangers of our age in one place”. Iraq was </p>
<p>“unique” because of its “past and present actions … its technological capabilities … </p>
<p>the merciless nature of its regime”. </p>
<p><b>385. </b> President Bush set out the main components of that threat, including the US </p>
<p>perception of Iraq’s WMD programmes and intent and its ability to deliver such weapons; </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s potential links to international terrorism; and the need for the US to </p>
<p>act to protect itself. The points made included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The possibility of Iraq acquiring a nuclear weapon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concerns that Iraq was “exploring ways of using UAVs [Unmanned Aerial </p>
<p>Vehicles] for missions targeting the United States”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq and Al Qaida (AQ) had “high level contacts that go back a decade”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some AQ leaders who had fled Afghanistan were in Iraq, including “one very </p>
<p>senior … leader” who had “been associated with planning for chemical and </p>
<p>biological attacks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[C]onfronting the threat posed by Iraq” was “crucial to winning the war against </p>
<p>terror”. Saddam Hussein was “harboring terrorists and the instruments of terror, </p>
<p>the instruments of mass death and destruction”. He could not be trusted and the </p>
<p>risk that he would “use them, or provide them to a terror network” was “simply </p>
<p>too great”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The enemies of the US would be “eager to use biological or chemical, or a </p>
<p>nuclear weapon”, and it “must not ignore the threat”: “Facing clear evidence </p>
<p>of peril, we cannot wait for the final proof – the smoking gun – that could come </p>
<p>in the form of a mushroom cloud.”</p>
<p><b>386. </b> President Bush stated that the danger, from Iraq, could not be addressed </p>
<p>“by simply resuming the old approach to inspections”. After eleven years of trying </p>
<p>“containment, sanctions, inspections, even selected military action”, Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>still had chemical and biological weapons and was “increasing his capabilities to make </p>
<p>more”; and he was “moving ever closer to developing a nuclear weapon”.</p>

<p>only if it took steps to comply with all its obligations [as set out in Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions]”. The US hoped the regime would make that choice but it had “little reason </p>
<p>to expect it”. </p>
<p><b>388. </b> President Bush also warned the Iraqi regime against attempting “cruel and </p>
<p>desperate measures” if it were facing its demise. If Saddam Hussein ordered such </p>
<p>measures, his generals would be “well advised to refuse”; “they must understand that </p>
<p>all war criminals will be pursued and punished”.</p>
<p><b>389. </b> President Bush stated that waiting to act was “the riskiest of all options”. There </p>
<p>could be “no peace” if the security of the US depended “on the will and whims of a </p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 10 October 2002</b></p>
<p><b>391.  The JIC Assessment of 10 October stated that Iraq’s ability to conduct </b></p>
<p><b>effective terrorist attacks was very limited; and it was “inadequate” to carry </b></p>
<p><b>out terrorist, chemical or biological attacks outside Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>392.  The JIC also assessed that Saddam Hussein would use terrorism only </b></p>
<p><b>in response to a US attack.</b></p>
<p><b>393. </b> At the request of the FCO, the JIC produced a specific Assessment on 10 October </p>

<p><b>394. </b> The Assessment stated that Saddam Hussein’s “overriding objective” was to “avoid </p>

<p><b>395. </b> The Key Judgements of the JIC Assessment of 10 October were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s capability to conduct effective terrorist attacks is very limited, </p>
<p>especially outside the Gulf region.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But Iraq will aim to conduct terrorist attacks against Coalition interests and Israel </p>
<p>during a military campaign. Terrorism could be attempted against Coalition </p>
<p>forces and Gulf States supporting them during a military build&#8209;up if Saddam </p>
<p>believes an attack is inevitable.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam will seek to conduct terrorist attacks against UK interests abroad in the </p>
<p>event of military action against him. Iraqi attacks within the UK are unlikely.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No major terrorist group will conduct attacks on behalf of Iraq. But Al Qaida and </p>
<p>other Islamic extremists may initiate attacks in response to Coalition military </p>
<p>action. Al Qaida will use an attack on Iraq as further ‘justification’ for terrorist </p>
<p>attacks against Western or Israeli interests.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s terrorism capability is inadequate to carry out chemical or biological </p>
<p>attacks beyond individual assassination attempts using poisons. But Al Qaida </p>
<p>or other terrorist groups could acquire a chemical/biological capability from the </p>
<p>dispersal of Iraqi material or expertise during a conflict in Iraq or following the </p>
<p>collapse of Saddam’s regime.”</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The Assessment stated that during the 1991 Gulf Conflict, Iraq had “sought (with </p>
<p>negligible success) to conduct terrorist attacks against Coalition interests” and that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s “overriding objective” was to “avoid a US attack that would threaten </p>
<p>his regime”. </p>
<p><b>397. </b> In the event of US&#8209;led military action against Iraq, the JIC judged that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would:</p>
<p>“… aim to use terrorism or the threat of it. Fearing the US response, he is likely to </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The Directorate of General Intelligence (DGI) had “little reach or capability outside </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There were indications that Saddam Hussein was “trying to rebuild a terrorist </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had the materials for chemical and biological (CB) terrorism but the JIC </p>
<p>judged that the overall terrorist capability was “inadequate to carry out CB terrorist </p>
<p>attacks outside Iraq other than individual assassinations using poisons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “likely to attempt terrorist attacks against military targets during a build </p>
<p>up of Coalition Forces” and it was “possible that attacks – or threats – could be </p>
<p>directed against regional states affording support to Coalition Forces”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Even after hostilities commenced, the expectation of diplomatic options might </p>
<p>“restrain any attempt to use terrorism until he [Saddam Hussein] believes collapse </p>
<p>of his regime is certain”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the event of military action”, Saddam Hussein would “seek to conduct terrorist </p>
<p>attacks” against the UK’s overseas interests, “especially military forces and </p>
<p>diplomatic facilities in the Middle East” and possibly Cyprus; but there was “no </p>
<p>intelligence” suggesting specific plans for attacks in the UK. The “experience of </p>
<p>1991 and current intelligence” suggested that Iraq might “seek less well&#8209;protected </p>
<p>targets overseas, for example South East Asia”.</p>
<p><b>Al Qaida</b></p>
<p>The JIC judged that “<b>the greatest terrorist threat in the event of military action </b></p>
<p><b>against Iraq will come from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists</b>”; and they would be </p>
<p>“pursuing their own agenda”. </p>
<p>The JIC did “<b>not believe that Al Qaida plans to conduct terrorist attacks under Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>direction</b>”.</p>
<p>The JIC assessed that “US&#8209;led military action against Iraq” would “motivate other Islamic </p>
<p>extremist groups and individuals to carry out terrorist attacks against Coalition targets”. </p>
<p>Al Qaida had:</p>
<p>“… sought to portray anticipated US&#8209;led military operations against Iraq as further </p>
<p>confirmation that the US is waging a war on Islam, attracting widespread popular </p>
<p>support across the Muslim world and on the Arab ‘street’. Al Qaida could also use the </p>
<p>opportunity of a military build up to target Coalition forces in the Gulf.”</p>
<p>The JIC predicted that: </p>
<p>“In the longer term, a Coalition attack may radicalise increasing numbers of Muslims, </p>
<p>especially Arabs, and boost support and recruitment for terrorist groups.” </p>
<p>The JIC concluded:</p>
<p>“… the terrorist threat from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists will increase in </p>
<p>the event of US&#8209;led action against Iraq. Widespread, sporadic, opportunity attacks </p>
<p>are most likely. Major, complex operations would be mounted by Al Qaida only if the </p>
<p>timing of military action coincides with culmination of their longer&#8209;term attack plans.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s links with Al Qaida</b></p>
<p>The Assessment stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “sporadic links between Al Qaida and the Iraqi regime since at </p>
<p>least the early 1990s”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s attitude to Al Qaida had “not always been consistent”; he had </p>
<p>“generally rejected suggestions of co&#8209;operation”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence nonetheless indicates that […] meetings have taken place between </p>
<p>senior Iraqi representatives and senior Al Qaida operatives.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Some reports also suggest that Iraq may have trained some Al Qaida terrorists </p>
<p>since 1998.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Al Qaida has shown interest in gaining chemical and biological expertise from </p>
<p>Iraq, but we do not know whether any such training was provided.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no intelligence of current co&#8209;operation between Iraq and Al Qaida”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was intelligence on an Al Qaida presence in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Abu Musab al&#8209;Zarqawi, “a prominent Al Qaida associated operational planner, was </p>
<p>in Baghdad” and appeared “to act with a considerable degree of autonomy”. It was </p>
<p>“possible that he could be acting independently of the senior Al Qaida leadership”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In addition, there were “a number of Al Qaida extremists (possibly in the </p>
<p>hundreds)”, “linked to al&#8209;Zarqawi”, in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone (KAZ) </p>
<p>in northern Iraq. Some were “involved in development and production of CB </p>
<p>substances at a facility near Halabjah, within a base run by the Kurdish extremist </p>
<p>group <b>Ansar al&#8209;Islam</b> (associated with Al Qaida).”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence of control” by the Iraqi regime over either Ansar al&#8209;Islam </p>
<p>or the Al Qaida elements in the KAZ.</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s links with other terrorist groups</b></p>
<p>Senior Iraqi Government officials had “sought to establish contact with <b>Hizballah</b>” in the </p>
<p>summer of 2002, but “those approaches were rejected”; Hizballah would “not respond in </p>
<p>any way that might be perceived as support for Saddam”. </p>
<p>There had also been Iraqi “attempts to increase co&#8209;operation” with “major <b>Palestinian </b></p>
<p><b>terrorist groups</b>”. The JIC assessed that they would remain preoccupied with events in </p>
<p>Israel and the Occupied Territories; and that they would “be influenced more by Iran and </p>
<p>Syria – who want to avoid antagonising the US – than by Saddam”. Individual Palestinian </p>
<p>terrorists and groups under Saddam Hussein’s influence had “limited capabilities, but </p>
<p>could mount small scale attacks”.</p>

<p>bombings in Bali on 12 October, a JIC Assessment of the current threat from Islamic </p>
<p>extremists was produced at short notice on 16 October.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Campbell wrote on 15 October that the question of “how can we do terrorism </p>
<p>and Iraq” was “growing”, and that Mr Blair was “keen to build argument that they were </p>
<p>part of the same coin”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>402. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion on 16 October record that the draft Assessment </p>
<p>focused “on the areas of greatest current concern and presented a rather sombre </p>
<p>picture”.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> The final Assessment could “bring out the changing nature … of the threat </p>
<p>to the UK, especially CBW attacks”. There was “a huge amount of intelligence and </p>
<p>a kaleidoscope of ghastly possibilities, but it was important to balance that with the </p>
<p>aspirational nature of much of the planning – not all threats came to fruition”.</p>
<p><b>403. </b> The Assessment addressed the overall threat posed by AQ and other Islamic </p>
<p>extremists. In relation to the UK and US interests, the JIC judged that: “Many known </p>
<p>threats to Western interests include US interests as a target. Planning and preparation </p>
<p>for attacks in the UK itself is probably also in progress. There is a continuing risk of </p>
<p>displacement from hardened US targets to the UK, UK interests and other Western </p>
<p>interests.”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>404. </b> The JIC assessed that AQ was “also intent on attacking US allies, especially the </p>
<p>UK; and […]. Intelligence on attacks against US interests often includes UK interests </p>
<p>as a parallel or secondary target.”</p>
<p><b>405. </b> The Assessment stated that an AQ network based in northern Iraq was interested </p>
<p>in the use of toxic chemical and biological materials, based on techniques learned in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, but also wished to mount conventional operations. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 11 October 2002</b></p>
<p><b>406.  The JIC assessed on 11 October that Saddam Hussein was determined to </b></p>

<p><b>408.  As military pressure increased, Iraq’s concealment policy could be </b></p>
<p><b>undermined by the requirement to prepare hidden “chemical and biological </b></p>

<p><b>409. </b> The JIC had assessed, most recently on 21 August, that Saddam Hussein would </p>
<p>permit the return of weapons inspectors if he believed the threat of large scale military </p>
<p>action was imminent. The JIC had also assessed that he would seek to frustrate the </p>
<p>activities of the inspectors. </p>
<p><b>410. </b> At the request of the Cabinet Office (OD Sec), the JIC assessed Iraq’s attitude </p>
<p>and approach to dealing with the return of UN weapons inspectors and its concealment </p>
<p>policy.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>411. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment on 9 October recorded:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “very confident” about its concealment policy and “had put a lot of effort </p>
<p>into ensuring that inspectors would not find anything”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UNMOVIC still had no information about suspect sites and without specific </p>
<p>intelligence, it would be impossible for them to know where to start looking.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A tougher, penetrative [inspections] regime backed by a good intelligence flow </p>
<p>from inside Iraq, would therefore be absolutely central to success”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… as military pressure increased, the point would come when concealment </p>
<p>would make it impossible” for Iraq to “prepare for weaponisation”.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>412. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam is determined to retain Iraq’s proscribed weapons programmes. He </p>
<p>is confident that he can prevent UNMOVIC, operating on the basis of existing </p>
<p>UNSCRs, from finding any evidence before military options start to close off </p>
<p>in spring 2003.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concealment and dispersal of sensitive items are the main elements of Iraq’s </p>
<p>strategy for dealing with UNMOVIC. The inspectors are hampered by poor </p>
<p>preparedness and a lack of intelligence, so far, to guide them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam will probably accept a new UN resolution. If inspections are conducted </p>
<p>under a tougher regime, and if specific intelligence on WMD locations is </p>
<p>forthcoming in response to clear US determination to topple Saddam, UNMOVIC </p>
<p>might find evidence of Iraq’s WMD programmes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the short&#8209;term, we do not expect a repeat of the blatant Iraqi policy of </p>
<p>intimidation and obstruction that UNSCOM encountered. Widespread Iraqi </p>
<p>obstruction would be seen as too obvious a challenge to the authority of the UN. </p>
<p>But if inspectors come close to uncovering evidence of WMD, Iraq will employ </p>
<p>a wide range of tactics to delay their work.</p>

<p>Iraq will use all diplomatic efforts, backed by its economic leverage on its </p>

<p>143</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Details of the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 11 October 2002: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq: The Return of UN Inspectors’</b></p>
<p>The Assessment stated that Saddam Hussein’s decision to agree to the return of weapons </p>
<p>inspectors on 16 September appeared “to have been driven by a serious wish to avoid a </p>
<p>new, strong UN Security Council resolution”. </p>
<p><b>Overall strategy</b></p>
<p>Intelligence indicated that Saddam Hussein was “determined to retain Iraq’s weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction”, which he considered “to be a key part of Iraq’s regional political and </p>
<p>military power. He was “adamant that UN weapons inspectors should not be allowed to </p>
<p>find and destroy the WMD capability that Iraq has been able to develop further in the four </p>
<p>years since UNSCOM left in 1998”. </p>
<p>Iraq was “confident” that it could “ensure the inspectors, acting under the terms of existing </p>
<p>UNSCRs”, would “not be able to find anything when they return and that Iraq will retain its </p>
<p>proscribed weapons programmes”.</p>
<p>Iraq’s tactics would be:</p>
<p>“… guided principally by the need to avoid military action which would threaten </p>
<p>Saddam’s regime. Whilst there is a credible military threat, Iraq is likely to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>with the inspectors and present them with sanitised sites, the result of a programme </p>
<p>of concealment and deception. This will be backed by a political effort to focus </p>
<p>the inspection issue on as narrow a programme as possible (in scope, geography </p>
<p>and time). Iraq will continue to pursue a ‘comprehensive solution’ and argue for </p>
<p>unwarranted interim ‘rewards’, such as softening of sanctions or the No&#8209;Fly Zones </p>
<p>for early reasonable behaviour.” </p>
<p>The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s obstruction may initially be limited, for fear of provoking early US military </p>
<p>action, but that Saddam will incrementally test the extent to which the international </p>
<p>community retains the political will to enforce Iraqi disarmament. […] Iraq’s Deputy </p>
<p>Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is confident that it will be easier to delay the inspectors once </p>
<p>they arrive in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>Practical arrangements for the return of the inspectors</b></p>
<p>Under the provisions of resolution 1284 (1999), UNMOVIC would submit a work </p>
<p>programme for UN approval 60 days after inspections began. It would then have 120 days </p>
<p>after being able to establish monitoring and verification to confirm co&#8209;operation by Iraq: </p>
<p>“Possibly by the end of July/Sept[ember] 2003”. </p>
<p>143 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 11 October 2002, ‘Iraq: The Return of UN Inspectors’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>Discussions with UNMOVIC revealed concerns focused on “the limited technical </p>
<p>knowledge of the sites and equipment to be inspected and poor quality of some </p>
<p>inspectors”. Dr Blix and the IAEA had “also expressed concerns about the lack of reliable </p>
<p>information currently available to them”. Dr Blix “would prefer to have any new UNSCR </p>
<p>agreed before the inspectors return[ed] to Iraq”. To be effective “he needed: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>authority (including ability to freeze sites);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>practical arrangements including regional bases;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a supporting threat (from the UN Security Council rather than forces on the </p>
<p>ground);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>information on where to look.”</p>
<p>The Assessment stated that, “despite its public statements”, Iraq “would reluctantly judge </p>
<p>it had to accept” a new Security Council resolution:</p>
<p>“International pressure to do so would be overwhelming and rejection would trigger </p>
<p>military action to overthrow the regime. A further round of technical talks might be </p>
<p>required to take account of a new UNSCR. […] Saddam may lose patience at the </p>
<p>constant pressures … and refuse to co&#8209;operate. A resolution with such stringent </p>
<p>conditions that it threatened Iraq’s sovereignty or the regime’s confidence in its </p>
<p>concealment policy would clearly increase the likelihood of such a refusal. On </p>
<p>balance, however … Iraq is likely to accept a new resolution, play for time and rely </p>
<p>on concealment to deal with inspections.</p>
<p>“In the short term, we do not expect the same level of intimidation and obstruction </p>
<p>that UNSCOM encountered. But a policy of deniable obstruction is likely, where </p>
<p>problems at individual inspection sites are blamed on over&#8209;zealous local Iraqi </p>
<p>officials, avoiding too obvious a challenge to the authority of the UN. However, </p>
<p>we cannot rule out a mistake by Saddam that would result in a serious breach </p>
<p>of UNMOVIC’s mandate and bring about the military attack he seeks to avoid.”</p>
<p><b>Concealment tactics</b></p>
<p>“A body of intelligence” indicated that “concealment and dispersal of sensitive items” were </p>
<p>“the main planks of Iraq’s strategy to deal with the return of weapons inspectors”. Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein had “reportedly taken into account the experience gained during the UNSCOM </p>
<p>inspections” and believed he could “exploit weaknesses in the inspections regime” in </p>
<p>resolution 1284.</p>
<p>The JIC stated: </p>
<p>“Iraq’s current preparedness to be flexible on access to these sites [presidential </p>
<p>palaces as defined in a 1998 MOU [Memorandum of Understanding] between Iraq </p>
<p>and the UN] should be seen in the light of this intelligence. Qusay [Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>son] also instructed that the production of sensitive materials be moved to other </p>
<p>secret locations. We have little intelligence on these locations and Blix has expressed </p>
<p>his concern at this weakness.”</p>
<p>Iraq’s concealment efforts were “widespread”; Iraq had “had time to prepare”; and stocks </p>
<p>of chemical and biological weapons would be “considerably smaller than after the Gulf </p>
<p>War”. Intelligence showed that:</p>
<p>“… steps were being taken to prevent weapons inspectors from finding any prohibited </p>
<p>weapons, sensitive papers and documents, including by hiding them in residential </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>buildings, schools and private homes. Duplicate and non&#8209;essential papers had been </p>
<p>destroyed and the remaining archives had been split up and hidden in the homes of </p>
<p>trusted officials. In the absence of specific intelligence, the prospects of successfully </p>
<p>finding illicit material at such sites is very limited … Iraq will use widespread media </p>
<p>coverage to exploit any UNMOVIC failures to find anything of significance at any </p>
<p>sites, including presidential palaces, to undermine public opinion in the need for </p>
<p>inspections. Iraq is likely to seek to move the onus of responsibility away from it </p>
<p>having to prove its compliance onto the inspectors to justify their activity.”</p>
<p>Iraq was “exploiting dual&#8209;use sites and mobile production facilities” and reporting indicated </p>
<p>that it was “confident that any inspection of dual&#8209;use facilities” would be “unsuccessful”: </p>
<p>the equipment could be used for legitimate purposes “and any incriminating raw material </p>
<p>or prohibited product would be removed before any inspection”. Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… developed transportable biological production facilities with the intention of not </p>
<p>only making it harder to target them but also difficult to find them. Iraq may also have </p>
<p>dispersed stocks of chemical and biological weapons away from suspect sites to </p>
<p>avoid detection. Intelligence indicates that Iraq has explored unorthodox options for </p>
<p>delivering chemical and biological weapons which means the weapons inspectors will </p>
<p>have difficulty knowing what to look for.” </p>
<p>Iraq was “confident in its concealment plans”: </p>
<p>“The fact that Saddam is prepared, temporarily, to allow sensitive equipment out of </p>
<p>his ‘immediate’ control, indicates the importance he attaches to retaining chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons and ballistic missiles.”</p>
<p>Commenting on Iraq’s repeated statements that it had “nothing to declare and no </p>
<p>documents to reveal”, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“… the longer inspectors remain in Iraq the greater the likely impact on Iraq’s </p>
<p>development programmes. UNMOVIC are more likely to come up with evidence of </p>
<p>proscribed activity at Iraq’s missile facilities than those associated with the chemical, </p>
<p>biological and nuclear programmes. We judged that production could continue at </p>
<p>a much reduced level whilst inspectors were in&#8209;country. As the military pressure </p>
<p>against Iraq increases, its concealment policy could be undermined by the Iraqi </p>
<p>requirement to prepare its hidden stocks of chemical and biological missile systems </p>
<p>for military deployment.”</p>
<p><b>Prospects for concealment</b></p>
<p>The JIC judged that Iraq’s “emphasis on concealment and the limited capabilities of </p>
<p>UNMOVIC” meant that:</p>
<p>“… without additional guidance to UNMOVIC, there is a serious risk that Iraq could </p>
<p>prevent inspectors from finding conclusive evidence of its WMD programmes before </p>
<p>military options start to close off in spring 2003. Nonetheless, Iraq’s concealment </p>
<p>policy will face some challenges. Inspections conducted under a tougher regime than </p>
<p>allowed for under UNSCR 1284 could, for example, allow interviews to be conducted </p>
<p>without an intimidating Iraqi presence, increasing the prospects for obtaining </p>
<p>incriminating evidence. And the changed political context, including the clear </p>
<p>determination of the US to bring about regime change, may itself encourage a greater </p>
<p>intelligence flow, which could enable UNMOVIC to discover substantive evidence of </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD programme.”</p>

<p><b>Differences between the US, the UK, France and Russia remain </b></p>
<p><b>unresolved</b></p>
<p><b>414.  Following discussions with Mr Blair, President Putin stated on 11 October </b></p>
<p><b>that he supported an effective inspections regime but questioned whether there </b></p>
<p><b>was evidence that Iraq had any weapons of mass destruction. </b></p>
<p><b>415. </b> In preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Putin, the FCO advised </p>
<p>that Russia was negotiating but its position was that there was no need for a new </p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> It was unlikely to agree a resolution which would allow military action </p>
<p>without further reference to the Security Council. The FCO suggested Mr Blair would </p>
<p>wish to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“major on Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reassure President Putin that the overriding objective was “to remove WMD from </p>
<p>Iraq and therefore to ensure the inspectors have a means of doing so”, and that </p>
<p>we would “continue to take full account of Russian views”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>say that if military action became “inevitable”, the long&#8209;term stability of Iraq </p>
<p>would be “a key consideration”. </p>
<p><b>416. </b> Mr Blair met President Putin on 10 and 11 October.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>417. </b> President Putin emphasised that action against Saddam Hussein should be </p>
<p>channelled through the UN. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Blair and President Putin also discussed the political and economic constraints, </p>
<p>including the effect on Russia of a reduction in the price of oil if Saddam Hussein were </p>
<p>overthrown and the supply of Iraqi oil on the world market increased.</p>
<p><b>419. </b> In the subsequent joint press conference President Putin stated that he agreed the </p>
<p>“need to take into account the experience of the work done by the UN inspectors” and </p>
<p>“to take a decision to ensure the effective operation of the UN inspectors”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> For the first </p>
<p>time, President Putin added:</p>
<p>“With this purpose we don’t exclude … the possibility of adopting a UN resolution.”</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Asked what he thought about the UK dossier, President Putin replied:</p>
<p>“Russia does not have in its possession any trustworthy data which would support </p>

<p><b>without an explicit decision by the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>422. </b> On 5 October, Mr Straw and Mr Blair discussed the need to induce France to </p>
<p>move.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that he would speak to President Chirac after President Bush </p>
<p>had done so. </p>
<p><b>423. </b> Following discussions between Sir David Manning and Dr Rice,</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> and his own </p>
<p>discussions with Secretary Powell and Mr de Villepin, Mr Straw told Mr de Villepin in </p>
<p>a meeting in Paris on 7 October that he had listened to two telephone conversations </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and President Bush in which the President had said he wanted to solve </p>
<p>the problem peacefully.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> Mr Straw said he “believed him [President Bush]”. Mr Straw </p>
<p>encouraged Mr de Villepin to get President Chirac to talk to President Bush. </p>
<p><b>424. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported on 7 October that:</p>
<p>“… under the pressure of the unmistakeable determination of Washington to resort </p>
<p>to force unless Saddam throws in the towel completely, is the growing focus </p>
<p>amongst other members of the Council, not on avoiding war, but on preserving the </p>
<p>authority of the UN. It is therefore quite possible that a large majority in the Council </p>
<p>would go along with a package which (a) adopted a first resolution which did not </p>
<p>(not) specifically prefigure a second one to authorise force; and (b) gave the Council </p>
<p>a chance to pass an authorising resolution even if the Americans were going to </p>
<p>go ahead anyway.</p>
<p>“… This could be done by drafting the two resolutions at the same time …”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Sir Jeremy offered some suggestions. </p>
<p><b>426. </b> In a conversation on 9 October, Sir David Manning told Mr de La Sablière: </p>
<p>“… we did not envisage taking military action if there were one isolated act of </p>
<p>stupidity. The test would be whether there was a pattern of obstruction or deceit … </p>
<p>Washington realised that the Council would need to review the position and decide </p>

<p>In practice, we all knew that if Blix were unable to do the job, the Security Council </p>
<p>would have to meet to consult. There was thus bound to be a second stage in the </p>
<p>UN process …”</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>427. </b> Sir David suggested that the resolution might say something to the effect that the </p>
<p>Security Council “would consult and decide”. He told Mr de La Sablière that the “time </p>
<p>had come” to “talk seriously about texts … We needed to find a way through quickly. </p>
<p>The price of failure would go well beyond the immediate Iraq crisis. It would strike at the </p>
<p>viability of the UN itself.”</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Sir David also discussed the points with Dr Rice, who told him that President Bush </p>
<p>and President Chirac were due to speak later that day.</p>

<p><b>429.  FCO Legal Advisers considered that the draft resolution would not authorise </b></p>
<p><b>the use of force. </b></p>
<p><b>430. </b> In response to a request from Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and </p>
<p>North Africa, for his views on a further draft of the resolution, which stated that if Iraq </p>
<p>failed to comply fully with its obligations it would “bear full responsibility for the serious </p>
<p>consequences” that would follow, Mr Grainger advised on 11 October that “even read </p>
<p>in the context of the rest of the draft” that provision “would not in itself authorise the </p>
<p>use of force”.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Grainger was concerned that the draft did not use the language of material </p>
<p>breach of resolution 687 (1991): “This point is crucial, as it is only a material breach </p>
<p>of the cease&#8209;fire terms which permits the revival argument.” </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Grainger added: “If our objective is that the resolution itself authorises the use </p>
<p>of force”, amendments would be needed and even then the resolution would need to be </p>
<p>looked at as a whole and in the light of any statements made at the time it was adopted. </p>
<p><b>433. </b> Mr Grainger also raised a question about whether the finding that Iraq was </p>
<p>in material breach of OP1 of the draft resolution could be relied on “in current </p>
<p>circumstances” to justify the use of force. That would be “difficult to maintain when the </p>
<p>[other] provisions … indicate that the Council is itself taking the responsibility of setting </p>
<p>out the steps Iraq must follow to remedy those breaches”.</p>
<p><b>434. </b> Mr Grainger warned that the addition of language suggested by Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock, to the effect that the Council had decided to “remain fully seized of its </p>
<p>responsibility”, would in his view have the effect of making it “even clearer that the </p>
<p>Council was not authorising the use of force”.</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>435. </b> In conclusion, Mr Grainger wrote: </p>
<p>“What we say to the French as a tactical ploy is one thing, but we should be under </p>
<p>no illusion that the use of force solely on the basis of the first resolution as currently </p>
<p>drafted would be unlawful.” </p>
<p><b>436.  Reporting major difficulties with the negotiations, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </b></p>
<p><b>proposed a way of bridging the gap between the US, UK and French positions </b></p>
<p><b>by making the UK’s expectation of a second resolution authorising force implicit </b></p>
<p><b>rather than explicit.</b></p>
<p><b>437. </b> In a telegram to Mr Straw late on 11 October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s visit to Washington was “an opportunity to get a firm message across to the </p>
<p>Americans about UK requirements”, and offered “some thoughts about turning our need </p>
<p>for UN legal cover into virtue”.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Sir Jeremy advised: “The French/US standoff is looking unresolvable. It places the </p>
<p>UK in a very difficult situation.” </p>
<p><b>439. </b> Sir Jeremy calculated that the US “could not get nine positive votes for a first&#8209;stage </p>
<p>resolution that appeared to authorise US military force”. Norway and Bulgaria would </p>
<p>be the only two countries which could be counted on to vote with the US and UK; but </p>
<p>“only if some of the excesses” in the draft provisions on the inspections regime were </p>
<p>“trimmed”. There could be seven abstentions. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> Sir Jeremy predicted: </p>
<p>“Even if they [the US] managed to find a text which attracted nine votes, it would </p>
<p>leave the inspection regime in a weak position and Iraq somewhat comforted. </p>
<p>More to the legal point, many members of the Council … could be expected to make </p>
<p>explanations of vote stating that they regarded it as essential for the Council to meet </p>
<p>to take a decision on any report of significant Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation.” </p>
<p><b>441. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he was concerned that Secretary Powell thought he had </p>
<p>nine votes for a first stage resolution that would satisfy the US. His judgement was that </p>
<p>Mr de Villepin’s calculation was more accurate. Mr Annan agreed.</p>
<p><b>442. </b> Addressing the question of where that left the UK, Sir Jeremy wrote:</p>
<p>“We have to ensure that decisions taken by … [the UK Government] conform with </p>
<p>international law, as you [Mr Straw] and the Prime Minister have made clear publicly. </p>
<p>A first resolution which falls short of explicit or implicit authorisation of the use of </p>
<p>force would, I assume be insufficient as a basis for UK military action, depending of </p>
<p>course on the circumstances and the final advice of the Law Officers. I have seen no </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>indication that we have Self&#8209;Defence grounds for military action. We need a second </p>
<p>resolution if the first does not do the job; or at the very least we need to … point to a </p>
<p>clear Council failure to face up to its responsibilities.</p>
<p>“If this is the case, there is a way of making a virtue out of necessity. If the </p>
<p>Americans jib at the need for a second resolution, the UK does not have to. If we </p>
<p>stated clearly and publicly … that we would expect the Council to meet to discuss </p>
<p>any significant Blix report of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation, and we … would want to hear Council </p>
<p>views about that, we would be providing a bridge between the US and French </p>
<p>positions.”</p>
<p><b>443. </b> Sir Jeremy explained: </p>
<p>“The US would not have expressed a commitment [to a second resolution], but the </p>
<p>rest of the Council would know that a second stage was inevitable, in practice even </p>
<p>for the US unless the latter decided, improbably, to go for unilateral military action </p>
<p>before Blix had reported …</p>
<p>“If we were to make this signal about future Council action, it would add strength </p>
<p>to our approach if it was we who put a second&#8209;stage resolution on the table …”</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“We should in this way have put our money where our mouth is with the Americans; </p>
<p>we would solve a problem for them; we would have found a constructive way of </p>
<p>telling them that we could not go with them on a unilateral route; and we should </p>
<p>have enhanced our legal cover for the use of force.”</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Sir Jeremy offered to discuss the telegram with Mr Straw on 14 October before </p>
<p>he (Mr Straw) left for Washington.</p>
<p><b>446. </b> There is no record of any discussion. </p>
<p><b>447. </b> The telegram was also sent to Sir David Manning and British Ambassadors in </p>
<p>Washington, Paris and Moscow. </p>
<p><b>448.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised on 11 October that President Bush was the </b></p>
<p><b>prime mover for US policy on Iraq and he believed war would be necessary to </b></p>
<p><b>eliminate Saddam Hussein. With Congressional authorisation to use force, he </b></p>
<p><b>was likely to become “increasingly impatient and tough with the Security Council” </b></p>
<p><b>and US and UK views on what exhausting the UN process meant could diverge.</b></p>
<p><b>449.  Sir Christopher also questioned whether there would be an “intolerable </b></p>
<p><b>contradiction” between the preferred military timetable and that for inspections. </b></p>
<p><b>450.  If there was no agreement in New York and the US was faced with acting </b></p>
<p><b>alone, the UK’s position might have a decisive effect on President Bush’s </b></p>

<p><b>451. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer sent a telegram to Mr Straw later on 11 October.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> He wrote </p>
<p>that President Bush wanted:</p>
<p>“… to be rid of Saddam. He is the prime mover of US policy. He believes that this </p>
<p>can be done in the end only by war. To eliminate the danger presented by Iraqi WMD </p>
<p>is to eliminate Saddam. Anything short of that, including highly intrusive inspections </p>
<p>backed by a new SCR, will not do the trick. Inspections are a tripwire for war.” </p>
<p><b>452. </b> Sir Christopher advised that President Bush was “intensely suspicious of the UN”, </p>
<p>and in an:</p>
<p>“… ideal world, he would be on his way now to Baghdad, with a little assistance from </p>
<p>the British and a handful of regional helpers. This is why he is eternally susceptible </p>
<p>to those like Cheney and Rumsfeld who think coalition&#8209;building is of limited utility </p>
<p>and inspections a waste of time (thus their attempt to insert in the UNSCR a </p>
<p>pre&#8209;inspections tripwire in the requirement for Saddam to make a declaration </p>
<p>of his WMD holdings).” </p>
<p><b>453. </b> Sir Christopher wrote that his analysis was “a little different” from his advice before </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s visit to Camp David in early September: “the forces arguing for more haste, </p>
<p>less speed have gathered some strength, sharpening dilemmas for the White House”.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> Sir Christopher reported that President Bush had “bought the argument that it is </p>
<p>worth trying to maximise international support by giving the Security Council one last </p>
<p>chance”. That argument had “got stronger as the Administration started to focus … on </p>
<p>‘day after’ issues: it is one thing to go to war without … UN cover, quite another to rule </p>
<p>Iraq indefinitely without UN backing”. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> The polls were telling the White House that “Americans are far happier about going </p>
<p>to war if they do so in company and under UN cover”. President Bush was “well aware of </p>
<p>the British political debate”. Sir Christopher reported that he had been told by Mr Scooter </p>
<p>Libby, Vice President Cheney’s Chief of Staff, that “the UK was the only indispensable </p>
<p>ally for an attack on Iraq”. President Bush’s “rhetoric has been less inflammatory and he </p>
<p>has soft&#8209;pedalled on regime change”. That had “helped him get, by large majorities, the </p>
<p>Congressional resolutions which as near as dammit give him a free hand in Iraq”. With </p>
<p>that behind him, the President was likely to become “increasingly impatient and tough </p>
<p>with the Security Council”. </p>
<p><b>456. </b> Sir Christopher warned that if there was no progress in discussions with the </p>
<p>French, “patience could start to expire next week”; and that: </p>

<p>process means could suddenly diverge.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>“Most people in Washington see two scenarios, each leading to war: Security </p>
<p>Council discussions collapse without agreement, in which case the UN will – in </p>
<p>Bush’s eyes – have failed the key test; or Saddam flouts a new UN resolution on </p>
<p>WMD declarations/inspections, thereby bringing the full force of the international </p>
<p>community to bear.</p>
<p>“The big worry for the hardliners is a third way: that Saddam appears to … take ‘yes’ </p>
<p>for an answer. If Saddam is clever, he will give UNMOVIC and the Security Council </p>
<p>no cause for complaint for months to come, until the US becomes enmeshed in the </p>
<p>2004 presidential election campaign.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Sir Christopher added: </p>
<p>“Assuming we can get past the current US/French impasse … the next argument </p>
<p>will therefore be over the trigger. The White House claims to agree with us that there </p>
<p>would have to be a pattern of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation to provide a casus belli: I do not think </p>
<p>… this is bankable. An important point for you to discuss with [Secretary] Powell </p>
<p>is whether … mobilisation has reached such a point that there is an intolerable </p>
<p>contradiction between the preferred military timetable and Blix scouring Iraq for </p>
<p>months on end.”</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Sir Christopher concluded:</p>
<p>“We are not yet at the moment of truth when the irresistible force meets the </p>

<p>wrong in New York, and the US is faced with going it alone, Bush may blink. </p>

<p>283</p>
<p><b>US Congressional authorisation for the use of force</b></p>
<p>On 10 and 11 October, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed a joint </p>
<p>resolution authorising the use of military force against Iraq.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The resolution expressed support for President Bush’s efforts: </p>
<p>“to –</p>
<p>(1) strictly enforce through the United Nations Security Council all relevant … </p>
<p>resolutions regarding Iraq and encourages him in those efforts; and</p>
<p>(2) obtain prompt and decisive action by the Security Council to ensure that Iraq </p>
<p>abandons its strategy of delay, evasion and non&#8209;compliance and promptly and strictly </p>
<p>complies with all relevant … resolutions …”</p>
<p>It also authorised President Bush to:</p>
<p>“use the Armed Forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and </p>
<p>appropriate to –</p>
<p>(1) defend the national security of the United States against he continuing threat </p>
<p>posed by Iraq; and </p>
<p>(2) enforce all relevant United Nations … resolutions …”  </p>
<p>Signing the joint resolution on 16 October, President Bush stated that it symbolised the </p>
<p>united purpose of the nation and expressed the considered judgement of Congress.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Congress had authorised the use of force but he had not ordered that use, and he hoped </p>
<p>that would not become necessary. </p>
<p>President Bush added that confronting the threat from Iraq was:</p>
<p>“… necessary, by whatever means that requires. Either the Iraqi regime will give </p>
<p>up its weapons of mass destruction, or, for the sake of peace, the United States will </p>
<p>lead a global coalition to disarm that regime …</p>
<p>“The Iraqi regime is a serious and growing threat to peace … [T]he regime is armed </p>
<p>with biological and chemical weapons, possesses ballistic missiles, promotes </p>
<p>international terror and seeks nuclear weapons …</p>
<p>“If Iraq gains even greater destructive power, nations in the Middle East would face </p>
<p>blackmail, intimidation or attack. Chaos in that region would be felt in Europe and </p>
<p>beyond. And Iraq’s combination of weapons of mass destruction and ties to terrorist </p>
<p>groups and ballistic missiles would threaten the peace and security of many nations. </p>
<p>Those who choose to live in denial may eventually be forced to live in fear.”</p>
<p>President Bush also called on the members of UN to meet the challenge:</p>
<p>“Every nation that shares in the benefits of peace also shares in the duty of defending </p>
<p>the peace. The time has arrived once again for the United Nations to live up to the </p>
<p>purposes of its founding to protect our common security …” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>President Bush stated that Iraq had an obligation to comply with the world’s demands. </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Failure to provide “an accurate and full and complete accounting for all chemical, </p>
<p>biological and nuclear materials, as well as missiles and other means of delivery </p>
<p>… would be further indication of the regime’s bad faith and aggressive intent”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>New and effective rules were needed for inspections which Iraq “must accept … </p>
<p>without qualification or negotiation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The regime must allow witnesses to be interviewed outside Iraq and take their </p>
<p>entire families with them.</p>
<p>President Bush emphasised that the US was seeking to liberate and free Iraq and its </p>
<p>people. When it had “a government committed to the freedom and well&#8209;being of its </p>
<p>people”, the US and other nations would “share a responsibility to help Iraq reform and </p>
<p>prosper”. He pledged that the US would meet those responsibilities.</p>
<p>President Bush concluded:</p>
<p>“… those risks only increase with time. And the costs would be immeasurably higher </p>
<p>in years to come.</p>
<p>“To shrink from that threat would bring a false sense of temporary peace …</p>
<p>“The terrorist attacks of last year put our country on notice … This nation will not live </p>
<p>at the mercy of any foreign power or plot. Confronting grave dangers is the surest </p>
<p>path to peace and security …</p>
<p>“The broad resolve of our government is now clear to all … We will defend our nation, </p>
<p>and lead others in defending peace.”</p>

<p>was determined to resolve the wording of the resolution the following week.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> He and </p>
<p>Dr Rice also discussed: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s insistence on independence and legitimacy and the need to ensure </p>
<p>he did not underestimate the tricks Saddam Hussein would play and the efforts </p>
<p>he would make to obstruct the inspectors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether Saddam Hussein might refuse to allow the inspections to go ahead </p>
<p>which “would be a casus belli”. The regime might collapse once rigorous </p>
<p>inspections were taking place. </p>

<p><b>466. </b> Sir David commented that he had been left in little doubt that Washington’s </p>
<p>patience was “wearing very thin”. He added that he had been struck by Dr Rice’s:</p>
<p>“… comment on the possible collapse of Saddam’s regime. Perhaps, even in the </p>
<p>White House there is now a faint sense of disquiet about what a military campaign </p>
<p>against Iraq, and its subsequent occupation, would involve. Long shot though it may </p>
<p>be, the thought that the Iraqis might do the job themselves may seem increasingly </p>
<p>attractive.” </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that a resolution was needed that week and </p>
<p>the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insist on material breach language in OP1;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>get the tightest inspection regime it could negotiate in OP5, taking account </p>
<p>of Dr Blix’s legitimate concerns;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>look for language in OP10 that balanced commitment to consult with </p>
<p>commitment to act; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consider pre&#8209;negotiating a second resolution which committed everyone to </p>
<p>action “when Saddam is in breach” as a way through the “current impasse”.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 14 October.</p>
<p><b>469. </b> The conversation on Iraq focused primarily on the progress of the discussions </p>
<p>on the draft UN resolution, including the need to find common ground with France </p>
<p>and to take action if the UN did not respond.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>470. </b> Referring to the “Kosovo model”, Mr Blair said that it would allow a return to the </p>
<p>Security Council for a further discussion in the event of a breach but it was clear that </p>
<p>“if there were no UN action then we would take action ourselves”.</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Mr Blair also underlined the importance of OP5; the key was for Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>not only to allow inspectors in but also to co&#8209;operate fully with them and tell the truth </p>
<p>about Iraq’s WMD holdings. </p>
<p><b>472. </b> Commenting on President Bush’s public line that war was his last choice, Mr Blair </p>
<p>said that had registered in Europe. They also discussed the possibility that the issue </p>
<p>could be resolved peacefully. A tough inspections regime could embolden dissidents </p>
<p>“a la Romania”. Mr Blair agreed that war was not inevitable but disarmament was; either </p>
<p>through UN inspections or through enforcement.</p>

<p>165</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy Greenstock judged that was unlikely to be </p>

<p><b>476. </b> Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw that the French proposal was the first time that they </p>
<p>had been willing to engage in textual discussion and that should be encouraged.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Ricketts wrote that the US was considering seeking text which would decide </p>
<p>that the Council should meet to assess how to meet its responsibility for international </p>
<p>peace and security; and that Iraq would bear responsibility for the consequences. If </p>
<p>that proved acceptable to the US, Mr Ricketts thought that implied a second Council </p>
<p>decision and would “put us in the position of needing a second resolution: and therefore </p>
<p>potentially at odds with the US at a later stage. But that is implicit in the Greenstock </p>

<p>French nor the US willing to back down on their approach”. That left “the UK in a very </p>
<p>difficult position”:</p>
<p>“Unlike the French, we are committed (politically) to participating in any military </p>
<p>action. But unlike the Americans, the Government needs to be sure that there is </p>
<p>a secure legal basis … given that the PM has stated on numerous occasions that </p>
<p>any action will be in accordance with international law.” </p>
<p><b>483. </b> Ms Adams told Lord Goldsmith that she had “no indication of precisely what </p>
<p>Number 10 would like to discuss with you”, but she addressed three points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for the Council to “make clear that there has been a breach of the </p>
<p>cease&#8209;fire conditions which is ‘sufficiently grave to undermine the basis or </p>
<p>effective operation of the cease&#8209;fire’”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“what would be the position if the UK were to propose a second resolution which </p>
<p>was then not adopted by the Council?”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what would happen in the event of no resolution.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Addressing the second point, Ms Adams wrote that there was:</p>
<p>“… nothing to prevent us from tabling a draft second resolution authorising the use </p>
<p>of force if, as expected, the Iraqis did not comply with the Council’s demands in the </p>
<p>first resolution. But there is no guarantee that such a resolution would be adopted. </p>
<p>The question then would be whether the perverse failure of the Council to adopt the </p>
<p>resolution (perhaps because of a single veto) would justify recourse to unilateral </p>
<p>action …”</p>
<p><b>485. </b> Ms Adams advised:</p>
<p>“This is a question which would have to be considered very carefully in the light </p>
<p>of the circumstances at the time. The Law Officers advised in 1997 … that there </p>
<p>could be ‘exceptional circumstances in which although the Council had not made </p>
<p>a determination of material breach it was evident to and generally accepted by the </p>
<p>international community as a whole that Iraq had in effect repudiated the cease&#8209;fire </p>
<p>and that a resort to military force to deal with the consequences of Iraq’s conduct </p>
<p>was the only way to ensure compliance with the cease&#8209;fire conditions.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>486. </b> Ms Adams added: </p>
<p>“I understand this passage was included in the advice to cover the sort of situation </p>
<p>where the Council was unable to act. But of course the counter view would be that </p>
<p>if the Council has rejected a resolution authorising the use of force, then under the </p>
<p>scheme of the Charter, it cannot be said that force is legally justified.”</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Ms Adams recommended that if Lord Goldsmith had “concerns about the </p>
<p>lawfulness of military action under any of these scenarios”, he should make that “very </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>clear at the meeting, as it is likely to increase the political efforts to achieve a satisfactory </p>
<p>resolution”. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> There is no record of the discussion. </p>
<p><b>489.  Mr Straw separately sought urgent advice from Mr Wood on the practical </b></p>
<p><b>consequences of acting without international legal authority.</b></p>
<p><b>490. </b> On 15 October, Mr Straw’s Private Office asked Mr Wood for an urgent note about </p>
<p>the practical consequences of the UK acting without international legal authority in using </p>
<p>force against Iraq for the UK Government or individual Service personnel; whether they </p>
<p>would be vulnerable to charges relating to unlawful use of force and therefore whether </p>
<p>the legality of the UK’s actions would be determined in domestic courts; and whether </p>
<p>the International Court of Justice could have any role.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Mr Wood replied the same day, outlining a number of potential consequences, </p>
<p>including that such action might constitute a breach of the Ministerial Code, and the </p>
<p>possible risk of civil litigation.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> He stated that the advice had been provided “on the </p>
<p>basis that we enter into an armed conflict which is clearly unlawful, without respectable </p>
<p>legal arguments”; and that it was “therefore in the realm of extremely theoretical </p>
<p>speculation”. </p>
<p><b>492. </b> Mr Wood wrote that, while the legality of the conflict would not be directly in issue </p>
<p>either in UK courts or the International Criminal Court, “the choice of lawful targets would </p>
<p>be difficult if the objectives of the conflict were themselves unlawful”. In that context, it </p>
<p>was “not inconceivable” that allegations of war crimes could be made on the basis that </p>
<p>the objectives of the conflict were unlawful. In addition, it was “just conceivable” that an </p>
<p>attempt could be made in the UK “domestic courts to launch a private prosecution for the </p>
<p>crime of aggression”. </p>
<p><b>493.  Mr Straw and Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that two resolutions would </b></p>
<p><b>be needed to authorise military action. </b></p>
<p><b>494.  Mr Straw urged Mr Blair to give President Bush clear messages about the </b></p>

<p>Secretary Powell on 14 and 15 October.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>498. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he had spoken to Mr Blair on 13 October, </p>
<p>who “had … favoured a two resolution approach”. He had also told Secretary Powell:</p>
<p>“… legally and politically it was almost certain that we would need a second </p>
<p>resolution explicitly authorising military action were the UK to be involved in such </p>
<p>[military] action against Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Mr Blair wrote alongside that point: “I don’t accept this in all circs.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>500. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell had also discussed the risks of acting without </p>
<p>international backing and the problems of the “day after” which would be the “largest </p>
<p>and most hazardous exercise in nation&#8209;building”; it would not be as straightforward </p>
<p>as some thought.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>501. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he felt:</p>
<p>“… with two resolutions we could close a deal with [President] Chirac, but otherwise </p>
<p>Chirac would use every chance he had, of which there would be many, to stift [sic] </p>
<p>both us and the US. And right now, the French had the votes and we did not.”</p>
<p><b>502. </b> As he had agreed with Mr Blair, Mr Straw also set out the arguments for two </p>
<p>resolutions, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the real world, there was bound to be a further discussion in the S[ecurity] </p>
<p>C[ouncil] if there was any non&#8209;compliance by the Iraqis, and (since we did not </p>
<p>control the agenda) a second resolution. On this … the only question was who </p>
<p>took the initiative – us (US/UK) or others.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He “accepted that Blix could not determine whether the US could go to war but </p>
<p>we were all bound to rely on Blix’s reports as to the facts about non&#8209;compliance, </p>
<p>on which the US and others would then make their own judgements”. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> In relation to the political environment in the UK, Mr Straw had told Secretary </p>
<p>Powell that he was: </p>
<p>“… as certain as [he] could be that there would be insufficient support in Cabinet </p>
<p>and the parliamentary Party to allow us to go to war without clear UN backing. I was </p>

<p><b>504. </b> Finally, Mr Straw recorded that he had asked whether the military preparations </p>
<p>were such that war was inevitable and had been told “emphatically” that they were not. </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had told him that, as President Bush got into the issue, he became </p>

<p><b>510. </b> In his absence, a statement from Mr Annan was read to the Council by Ms Louise </p>
<p>Fréchette, Deputy Secretary&#8209;General. In addition to reiterating the points he had made </p>
<p>on 12 September (see Section 3.4), Mr Annan also stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “failure to comply fully” with the resolutions of the Council was one of the </p>
<p>“gravest and most serious” situations facing the Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council’s primary responsibility for the maintenance of international </p>
<p>peace and security, conferred in Article 24 of the UN Charter, was a grave </p>
<p>responsibility. It was “essential” for the Council to face up to that responsibility.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The situation also presented an opportunity to “strengthen international </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, the rule of law and the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s decision to readmit the inspectors without condition was “an important first </p>
<p>step, but only a first step”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full compliance remained “indispensable”, and had “not yet happened”. The </p>
<p>Council would expect “unfettered access”. A new resolution “strengthening the </p>
<p>inspectors’ hands” would be “appropriate”: “The new measures must be firm, </p>
<p>effective, credible and reasonable.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq failed “to make use of this last chance, and if its defiance continues”, </p>
<p>the Council would “have to face its responsibilities”. It did that “best and most </p>
<p>effectively” when its members worked “in unison”.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Mr Annan concluded by “urging” the Council:</p>
<p>“… to make every effort to retain their unity of purpose. If you allow yourselves to be </p>
<p>divided, the authority and credibility of the … [UN] will undoubtedly suffer; but if you </p>
<p>act in unison, you will have a greater impact and a better chance of achieving your </p>
<p>objective, which must be a comprehensive solution that includes the suspension and </p>
<p>eventual ending of the sanctions that are causing such hardship for the Iraqi people, </p>
<p>as well as the timely implementation of other provisions of your resolutions. If the </p>
<p>Council succeeds … it will strengthen the United Nations in a way that will place </p>
<p>future generations in its debt.” </p>
<p><b>512. </b> During the debate that followed, a wide range of views and concerns were aired </p>
<p>reflecting the positions of the participants.</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Mohammed Aldouri, Iraqi Permanent Representative to the UN, criticised </p>
<p>the US Administration’s “plans to invade and occupy Iraq, using military force” and </p>
<p>argued that it wanted “a blank cheque” from the Security Council to “colonize Iraq … </p>
<p>[and] subject the entire region to American hegemony”. He stated that there were “no </p>
<p>nuclear, chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and that Iraq had </p>
<p>implemented many years ago the disarmament requirements” in resolution 687 (1991).</p>
<p><b>514. </b> Following a description of Iraq’s position on its implementation of resolution 687 </p>
<p>and the conduct of inspectors before their departure in December 1998, “as instructed </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had taken the initiative of opening a dialogue with Mr Annan. </p>
<p>That had achieved “some progress” but the US had exerted pressure “which prevented </p>
<p>the Council from participating in efforts to seek a comprehensive solution”.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> The Iraqi Government had “agreed, unconditionally, to the return” of inspectors </p>
<p>on 16 September and agreed arrangements with Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei in Vienna </p>
<p>for the return of inspectors by 19 October. The US had hampered those arrangements </p>
<p>by “calling for the imposition of unfair, impossible and arbitrary conditions on Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> Mr Aldouri concluded by reiterating that Iraq “had pledged to co&#8209;operate with </p>
<p>inspectors in every possible way so as to facilitate their task of ascertaining” there were </p>
<p>“no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq”. There was “absolutely no need for adoption </p>
<p>of a new Security Council resolution”.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Following the statements by non&#8209;members of the Security Council, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock set out the UK position in his speech on 17 October. He stated that the </p>
<p>issues being debated went much wider than Iraq and included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the security of the whole neighbourhood of Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the reinforcement of our collective effort to eliminate terrorism”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“justice for Palestine and security for Israel within the law”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the role of the Security Council when serious matters of national security are </p>
<p>before its members”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the overall effectiveness of the United Nations itself”.</p>
<p><b>518. </b> Sir Jeremy emphasised that the UK’s “firm objective” was “the complete </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq in the area of weapons of mass destruction, by peaceful means”, </p>
<p>and “a peaceful resolution to the current crisis surrounding Iraq”. But ensuring that there </p>
<p>was such a solution lay “in the hands of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>519. </b> Addressing Iraq’s response to the conditions of the cease&#8209;fire in 1991, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>stated that Iraq remained “in material breach of these obligations”. He added:</p>
<p>“We all know of the myriad ways in which Iraq sought, almost immediately after </p>
<p>inspections began to frustrate inspections and intimidate inspectors.</p>
<p>“We all know of the succession of allegedly final declarations … We all know that </p>
<p>Iraq tried to limit and hinder inspections to the extent that in August 1998 the then </p>
<p>head of … UNSCOM said it was impossible for him to do his job. We all know of </p>
<p>the outstanding weapons of mass destruction for which UNSCOM was unable to </p>

<p>letter of 16 September … emerged.”</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that Iraq’s:</p>
<p>“… words, while necessary, are of themselves not enough. We remain deeply </p>
<p>perturbed by evidence that Iraq believes it can hide its weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>rather than declare them, that it can again fool the inspectors and play games </p>
<p>with them. The United Kingdom analysis, backed by reliable intelligence, indicates </p>
<p>that Iraq still possesses chemical and biological materials, has continued to </p>
<p>produce them, has sought to weaponise them, and has active military plans for the </p>
<p>deployment of such weapons. The United Kingdom analysis, backed up by reliable </p>
<p>intelligence, shows that Iraq has in recent years tried to buy multiple components </p>
<p>relevant to the production of a nuclear bomb. The United Kingdom analysis, backed </p>
<p>by reliable intelligence, points to the retention of extended&#8209;range missiles and to </p>
<p>the employment of hundreds of people in projects to develop weapons with a range </p>
<p>of over 1,000 kilometres that could carry both weapons of mass destruction and </p>
<p>conventional warheads.</p>
<p>“It would be an abdication of responsibility to ignore this challenge to the </p>
<p>international community. We cannot afford to bury our heads in the sand and </p>
<p>pretend the problem does not exist. We cannot accept the Iraqi Government’s word </p>
<p>at face value, knowing what we know.”</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that the UK wished “to see the Security Council … express </p>
<p>its will and its unity in a clear strong resolution”, which gave the Iraqi regime “an </p>
<p>unequivocal choice” to complete WMD “disarmament and normal membership of the </p>
<p>international community, or refusal and the inevitable consequences”. The offer to Iraq </p>
<p>was genuine and represented “a single final chance for Iraq”. If that was understood and </p>
<p>the Council kept its nerve, there might be:</p>
<p>“… a prospect that Iraq will finally comply with its obligations and that military action </p>
<p>can be averted. If we fail to send that tough signal, we shall be ignoring the realities. </p>
<p>The weaker we collectively appear, the more probable it is that military action will be </p>
<p>the outcome.”</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Sir Jeremy added that effective inspections were an “essential component” of the </p>
<p>message and there should be no return to the “ambiguous modalities” and exceptions of </p>
<p>the past. He questioned whether the language in recent Iraqi letters about the practical </p>
<p>arrangements for inspections was sufficient and called for the arrangements to be made </p>
<p>legally binding.</p>
<p><b>523. </b> Sir Jeremy said he had “heard loud and clear the concerns of many speakers that, </p>
<p>on a decision so crucial, we should not rush into a war”; and that “any Iraqi violations </p>
<p>must be discussed by the Security Council”. If either Dr Blix or Dr ElBaradei reported </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>that Iraq was “not fully co&#8209;operating with the inspections process”, the UK Government </p>
<p>would “expect there to be a detailed Security Council discussion”. The UK would “want </p>
<p>at that point to hear the views” of the other members of the Council.</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Addressing the comments by a number of speakers that the non&#8209;permanent </p>
<p>members of the Council had “been kept in the dark” or even humiliated, Sir Jeremy said </p>
<p>he believed the facts had been “misrepresented”. None of the permanent members had:</p>
<p>“… been in a position so far to bring a draft resolution to each other here or to the </p>
<p>Council as a whole. The permanent five have done no negotiating on a text in New </p>
<p>York. Discussion in capitals has taken place on bilateral channels. Of course our </p>
<p>Governments have been working to make a negotiation worthwhile … Once there is </p>
<p>a draft with a prospect of broad acceptance in the Council, no Council member will </p>
<p>be excluded from discussion …”</p>
<p><b>525. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded by referring to Iraq’s breach of other Security Council </p>
<p>obligations and called on Iraq to rectify that position. </p>
<p><b>526. </b> The description of Iraq’s WMD capabilities in Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s statement </p>
<p>reflected the judgements in the UK dossier on Iraq and the JIC Assessment of </p>
<p>11 October. </p>
<p><b>527. </b> Setting out China’s position, Mr Zhang Yishan, Chinese Deputy Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN, stated that the “absence for so long of a solution to the </p>
<p>question of Iraq” had “not served peace and stability in the Gulf region or the authority </p>
<p>and credibility of the Security Council”. Nor had it “been conducive to improving the </p>
<p>humanitarian situation in Iraq”. “An early and appropriate settlement” was “the important </p>
<p>and urgent task” for the international community and the UN in particular.</p>
<p><b>528. </b> The Chinese Government had “consistently maintained that Iraq should </p>
<p>unconditionally and strictly implement the relevant Security Council [resolutions] … </p>
<p>and fully co&#8209;operate with the United Nations” on inspections and other issues. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Commenting that the number of participants attested to the importance of the </p>
<p>issues and the concerns about the implications for international relations, Mr Zhang </p>
<p>added:</p>
<p>“The overwhelming majority of States have emphasised during the debate that the </p>
<p>question of Iraq should be settled within the framework of the United Nations, that </p>
<p>the Security Council should play a central role in the process and that the unity of </p>
<p>the Security Council was of paramount importance. </p>
<p>“A number of countries, especially the Arab States, have also expressed their strong </p>
<p>wish for peace not war. They have pointed out that war can only further exacerbate </p>
<p>the already tense situation in the Middle East. The independence, sovereignty </p>
<p>and territorial integrity of Iraq, Kuwait and other countries of the region should be </p>

<p>respected. These views and positions are very important, and we agree with them. </p>
<p>We hope the Security Council will give them serious consideration.”</p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Zhang stated that disarmament was “at the core of the Iraqi question”, but: </p>
<p>“Only when the … weapons inspectors return to Iraq and conduct effective inspections </p>
<p>can the truth ultimately emerge.” He welcomed the agreements reached in Vienna for </p>
<p>inspections, adding that China hoped Iraq would “honour its commitments and translate </p>
<p>them into actual deeds”, and it believed weapons inspectors should return:</p>
<p>“… as soon as possible to conduct independent, fair and professional inspections </p>
<p>and report truthfully and in a timely manner to the Council the results of such </p>
<p>inspections, so that the Council can draw objective, fair and realistic conclusions …</p>
<p>“Under such circumstances, it is not that we cannot consider the adoption by the </p>
<p>Council of a new resolution … Such a draft … however, should be practical and </p>
<p>feasible, in the interests of an appropriate settlement …”</p>
<p><b>531. </b> Mr Zhang concluded:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi question has reached a critical juncture. The international community </p>
<p>has high hopes of the Security Council. It hopes that the Council will be able to </p>
<p>effectively undertake its responsibilities to maintain international peace and security </p>
<p>and take action to safeguard the purposes and principles of the Charter. The </p>
<p>Chinese Government is ready to join other countries in promoting an appropriate </p>
<p>settlement of the Iraqi question within the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Ambassador Negroponte described President Bush’s speech to the General </p>
<p>Assembly on 12 September as a “declaration of purpose, not a declaration of war” </p>
<p>which had:</p>
<p>“… put the United Nations in the spotlight and challenged the international </p>
<p>community to restore the Security Council’s relevance on this issue by confronting </p>
<p>this threat to international peace and security and 11 years of failure by Iraq to </p>
<p>accept the demands made of it after its invasion and destruction of Kuwait.”</p>
<p><b>533. </b> The threat from Iraq was “serious and unique”, arising directly from Iraq’s “history </p>
<p>of aggression and brutality, its defiance of the international community and its drive </p>
<p>towards an arsenal of terror and destruction”. It was a regime which had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“invaded two of its neighbours and tried to annihilate one of them”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“used chemical weapons on its neighbours and on its very own citizens”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“lied about its development of weapons of mass destruction”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“signed the Nuclear Non&#8209;Proliferation Treaty and then proceeded to develop </p>
<p>a major nuclear weapons programme”. </p>
<p><b>534. </b> Since 1991, the Council had “tried in every way to bring Iraq to peaceful fulfilment </p>
<p>of the … cease&#8209;fire”, but the Iraqi regime had “violated all of its obligations”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>535. </b> Ambassador Negroponte stated that the Council was meeting “to publicly discuss </p>
<p>the message that the Security Council will send to Iraq and … Saddam Hussein”. </p>
<p>The US view had been clear since 12 September; there could be:</p>
<p>“… no more business as usual or toothless resolutions that Iraq will continue to </p>
<p>ignore. Our intent is that the Council should meet the challenge and stand firm, </p>
<p>resolute, and united in adopting a draft resolution that holds Iraq to its commitments, </p>
<p>lays out clearly what Iraq must do to comply and states that there will be </p>
<p>consequences if Iraq refuses to do so.” </p>
<p><b>536. </b> The US expected the Council to act, and that when it adopted a resolution which </p>
<p>sent “a clear and united message to Iraq that it must fulfil its obligations”, Iraq would </p>
<p>have a choice “whether to take this last chance to comply”. The US hoped Iraq would </p>
<p>comply, but if it did not, the US would “seek compliance and disarmament by other </p>
<p>means”. </p>
<p><b>537. </b> Addressing the role of the UN, Ambassador Negroponte described the world’s </p>
<p>“united response” to Iraq’s aggression in 1990 and 1991 and the resolutions passed by </p>
<p>the Security Council as “unique and ground&#8209;breaking”, which “brought the world body </p>
<p>closest to the visions of its founders”. But in the ensuing 10 years, Iraq’s “failure to </p>
<p>implement” the “peace terms” had become “a question of enormous significance”. The </p>
<p>challenge was whether the UN could “perform the function its founders envisaged”.</p>
<p><b>538. </b> The US hoped the answer would be “Yes”. Since 12 September it had “seen signs </p>
<p>of emerging Council unity during intensive discussions here and in capitals”. But it had </p>
<p>“also seen clear signs” that Iraq was “reverting to form”, including inviting inspectors to </p>
<p>return without conditions, then placing conditions, and responding to UNMOVIC and </p>
<p>IAEA requests for clarity with “obfuscation and multiple answers”. Iraq had shown it </p>
<p>hoped “to return to the word games, ephemeral commitments and misdirection of the </p>
<p>past, while continuing to develop the world’s deadliest weapons”. That was “why a clear, </p>
<p>firm message from the Council was so important”. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> The Council and the UN membership would do “no favour” to the people of Iraq, </p>
<p>the countries of the region or the credibility of the UN if they created “the impression </p>
<p>that an outcome in which Iraq retains its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programmes is an acceptable or possible outcome”. A consensus had been forming in </p>
<p>the Council that “the time for denial, deception and delay” had “come to an end and that </p>
<p>Iraq must be verifiably disarmed”. There was “a growing agreement that there must be </p>
<p>immediate, unconditional and unrestricted inspections of all Iraqi facilities that may have </p>
<p>a role in the development of weapons of mass destruction”. </p>
<p><b>540. </b> Ambassador Negroponte stated that the US and UK had shared “the elements </p>
<p>of our vision of a resolution that will address Iraq’s material breach of its obligations … </p>
<p>specify the types of access and authorities that UNMOVIC and IAEA must have to be </p>
<p>able effectively to verify Iraqi disarmament, make clear Iraq’s obligations and articulate </p>
<p>to Iraq that there will be consequences to non&#8209;compliance” with other members of </p>

<p>297</p>
<p>the Council. The US believed that the “best way to ensure Iraqi compliance” was one </p>
<p>resolution which was “firm and unambiguous in its message”. A resolution “with clear and </p>
<p>immediate requirements … that Iraq would voluntarily meet if it chooses to co&#8209;operate” </p>
<p>would be placed before the Council “in the near future”. Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had </p>
<p>“made it clear that they would welcome a new … resolution that strengthens their hands </p>
<p>and allows for more effective inspections”. </p>
<p><b>541. </b> Ambassador Negroponte concluded:</p>
<p>“Now, the spotlight is back on the Security Council. We hope and expect that the </p>
<p>Council will act and play its proper role as a safeguard of our common security. </p>
<p>If it fails to do so, then we and other States will be forced to act.</p>
<p>“The approach of the United States and United Kingdom aims at clarity … with </p>
<p>respect to what Iraq must now do to fulfil its 1991 obligations to restore peace </p>
<p>and security in the region … what inspectors must be allowed to do; and our </p>
<p>seriousness. Without such clarity there is too high a danger that Iraq will </p>
<p>miscalculate. And miscalculation by Iraq will lead to precisely the military action </p>
<p>we all hope to avoid.</p>
<p>“The Security Council faces a defining moment. The Council works best on Iraq </p>
<p>when it works together … when the Council is resolute and united, its actions </p>
<p>produce results. We must stand together and show Iraq that its failure to comply </p>
<p>will no longer be tolerated.” </p>
<p><b>542. </b> Mr Jean&#8209;David Levitte, French Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that </p>
<p>the international community had been unable, since December 1998, to verify whether </p>
<p>Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and whether it was “pursuing programmes </p>
<p>to that end”. By refusing to allow the return of inspectors, Iraq had defied the authority </p>
<p>of the Council. “Even though France” did “not possess irrefutable proof”, there were </p>
<p>“several indications” that Iraq had used the absence (of inspectors) to “pursue or </p>
<p>resume its prohibited programmes, notably in the chemical and biological areas”. The </p>
<p>“behaviour of the Baghdad authorities” had “given rise to strong suspicions”. That </p>
<p>situation could “not be tolerated”; proliferation of WMD and their delivery systems, “in </p>
<p>Iraq or elsewhere”, constituted “a serious threat to international security”. In the face of </p>
<p>that challenge, France considered the objective was the disarmament of Iraq and that </p>
<p>implied “the return of the inspectors and the resumption of monitoring on the ground”. </p>
<p><b>543. </b> Iraq had confirmed the practical arrangements for inspections agreed in Vienna, </p>
<p>and inspectors “must now return … as soon as possible”, but the UN would need to </p>
<p>verify the sincerity of Iraq’s commitments:</p>
<p>“In the light of past experience, the international community cannot be satisfied with </p>
<p>words alone. Iraq must translate its promises into concrete, verifiable and lasting acts.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Mr Levitte observed that the outcome of past UN inspections had been “very </p>
<p>positive. UNSCOM had destroyed more WMD between 1991 and 1998 than military </p>
<p>operations in 1991”, and: “In 1998, the IAEA believed it had succeeded in dismantling </p>
<p>the Iraqi nuclear programme. It was not the inspections that failed, but the international </p>
<p>community’s ability to enforce its decisions in a sufficiently firm and united manner.” </p>
<p>He added that France was “fully disposed to support measures strengthening the </p>
<p>inspection regime, insofar as that proves necessary to facilitate the inspectors’ work”. </p>
<p>But it rejected “measures that would … multiply the risk of incidents without improving </p>
<p>the effectiveness” of UNMOVIC and the IAEA. In addition, France “also set store” on the </p>
<p>“multinational, independent nature of the inspectors” and any measure which countered </p>
<p>that “would be tantamount to repeating past mistakes”. The Council should be guided </p>
<p>in its choices by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei. </p>
<p><b>545. </b> Addressing the role of the Council, Mr Levitte stated that France attached </p>
<p>“importance to the principle of collective security”. That was why it was proposing a </p>
<p>two&#8209;stage approach. In the first, the Council “should adopt a resolution clearly stating the </p>
<p>‘rules of the game’”. It would “define the inspection regime with a view to ensuring the </p>
<p>inspectors” could “accomplish their mission fully and without any hindrance”. It “should </p>
<p>also send a clear warning to Iraq” that the Council would “not tolerate new violations”. </p>
<p><b>546. </b> In the second stage, if the inspectors observed that Iraq was “refusing to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate fully” with them, the Council “would meet immediately to decide on the </p>
<p>appropriate measures to take, without ruling anything out a priori”. </p>
<p><b>547. </b> France’s view was that such an approach, which was also the one proposed </p>
<p>by Mr Annan in his statement to the Council, was “the only one” that could offer “unity, </p>
<p>cohesion, fairness and legitimacy”. Unity of the Council was “absolutely vital”. In the </p>
<p>past Iraq had “taken advantage of divisions … to renege on its obligations and defy </p>
<p>the Council’s authority”: </p>
<p>“Only a united front will convince it not to repeat this error. Only a two&#8209;stage </p>
<p>approach will allow us to preserve our Council’s unity; any kind of ‘automaticity’ </p>
<p>in the use of force will profoundly divide us.</p>
<p>“The two&#8209;stage approach is, rather, the choice of cohesion. United in sending Iraq </p>
<p>a message of firmness in an initial resolution, the Security Council will, we have no </p>
<p>doubt, remain united to assume all of its responsibilities during the second stage, </p>
<p>should Iraq violate its commitments.”</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Mr Levitte added that the Council “should also demonstrate fairness by showing </p>
<p>Iraq that war is not inevitable if it fully and scrupulously fulfils its obligations”. That would </p>
<p>“open the way to the suspension then lifting of sanctions in accordance with Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions”. Given the “gravity of the situation”, it was “essential for the Security </p>
<p>Council to stay in charge of the process every step of the way”. That was “fundamental </p>
<p>for the legitimacy of our action and essential for maintaining unanimous support for our </p>
<p>common objectives”. </p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Mr Levitte concluded the Council was discussing:</p>
<p>“… the future of the international order, relations between North and South, and </p>
<p>notably, our relationship with the Arab world. An action of uncertain legitimacy … that </p>
<p>does not enjoy the support of the international community, would not be understood </p>
<p>and could gravely affect these relations.</p>
<p>“By placing this action within the framework of collective security, the French </p>
<p>approach aims to ensure its legitimacy and effectiveness, while respecting the </p>
<p>principles defined by the United Nations Charter.”</p>
<p><b>550. </b> In his opening remarks, Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative </p>
<p>to the UN, stated:</p>
<p>“For almost 12 years now, the international community has sought a way to settle </p>
<p>the Iraqi situation. Throughout that time the Security Council has adopted more than </p>
<p>50 resolutions and endured several severe crises. The current ongoing impasse is </p>
<p>rooted not only in the position of the Iraqi side, although we are far from condoning </p>
<p>Baghdad’s behaviour, while the need for Iraq to meet all its obligations … has been </p>
<p>frequently alluded to … We fully support such assessments. At the same time, in a </p>
<p>number of instances the Security Council has been unable to hold up its own end </p>
<p>with respect to an objective assessment of the situation and to meeting its own </p>
<p>obligations to work for a comprehensive settlement …” </p>
<p><b>551. </b> After making similar remarks to Mr Levitte on the overall achievements of the </p>
<p>inspectors, Mr Lavrov stated that it was unfortunate that the Council “was not able </p>
<p>to recognise” the opinion of the IAEA in 1998 that its task could be converted into a </p>
<p>“long&#8209;term monitoring regime”. That conclusion had been supported in a letter from </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei to the President of the Council on 14 October, which had “clearly indicated” </p>
<p>there were “no outstanding unresolved nuclear issues requiring further clarification”. </p>
<p>Mr Lavrov added that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “virtually complete picture of the missile situation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “significant portion of the stocks of chemical weapons” had been destroyed, </p>
<p>“although there were some outstanding issues requiring further clarification”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “largest problems persisted in the biological sphere”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But on these issues and all the outstanding issues, solutions were possible. </p>
<p>At any rate, documents of the former UNSCOM testify that such was the case.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In December 1998 the head of the former UNSCOM [Dr Richard Butler] </p>
<p>provoked a crisis, arbitrarily withdrawing inspectors from Iraq without the </p>
<p>approval of the Security Council. His report came to the Security Council only </p>
<p>after [the] United States and the United Kingdom had launched military strikes </p>
<p>against Iraq.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After the strikes, the US Government stated they “had dealt with the issue of </p>
<p>eliminating the vestiges of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction programmes, </p>
<p>although the relevant information was not given to the Security Council”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Through its “acts of provocation” the former UNSCOM had “fully discredited itself </p>
<p>and simultaneously undermined the pre&#8209;December 1998 prospects for reaching </p>
<p>a comprehensive settlement”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Council then found itself in a profound crisis not of its own making on the </p>
<p>question of Iraq and for a long time was unable to get out of the impasse”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1284 “allowed us to renew the inspections on a new genuinely </p>
<p>international basis”, but it “contained extremely ambiguous criteria for </p>
<p>suspension of the sanctions”. That gave individual Council members the </p>
<p>opportunity “to maintain the embargo indefinitely”. Russia had made proposals </p>
<p>to give “concrete substance to the criteria of sanctions suspension in the context </p>
<p>of a comprehensive settlement”, which remained extant.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Security Council had implemented the provisions of resolution 1382 (2001) </p>
<p>in respect of the creation of a Goods Review List, but it had not pursued the </p>
<p>“commitment to a comprehensive settlement on the basis of existing Council </p>
<p>decisions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia would “do its utmost to prevent a renewal” of Iraq’s WMD programmes, </p>
<p>and was “prepared to co&#8209;operate” on that “with all States”. But Russia, “like all </p>
<p>unbiased observers”, had “not seen any kind of persuasive evidence that there </p>
<p>are weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or programmes to develop them”. Nor </p>
<p>had it “seen any other facts that would situate Iraq in the context of combating </p>
<p>terrorism”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “immediate redeployment of the international inspectors to Iraq” was the </p>
<p>“only way to remove any doubts”.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that Iraq had “consented” to an unconditional return of inspectors </p>
<p>and the “new, enhanced and very effective parameters for conducting inspections”. </p>
<p>There was “everything we need to ensure there is no renewal of the proscribed military </p>
<p>programmes in Iraq” and for “a political and diplomatic settlement of the crisis”. There </p>
<p>was “no need to delay deployment” of the inspectors. He added:</p>
<p>“If the Council has a prevailing desire to give further support to UNMOVIC and the </p>
<p>IAEA in the interest of the effective implementation of the existing resolutions … we </p>
<p>will be prepared to look at the relevant proposals, including and based on the great </p>
<p>importance of maintaining Council unity.”</p>
<p><b>553. </b> In his concluding remarks, Mr Lavrov stated that Russia was “calling for collective </p>
<p>steps by the international community” and unilateral actions did “not facilitate the efforts </p>

<p>for a settlement”. The Council should continue to press for Iraq’s compliance with all </p>
<p>resolutions. The crux of the matter was:</p>
<p>“If we are all sincerely interested in the non&#8209;renewal of weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>… What are we waiting for? … If we are talking not about the deployment of the </p>
<p>inspectors but about an attempt to use the Security Council to create a legal basis </p>
<p>for the use of force, or even for a regime change of a United Nations Member State </p>
<p>– and this goal has been constantly and publicly alluded to by several officials – then </p>
<p>we see no way how the Security Council could give its consent to that …</p>
<p>“The Charter powers of the Security Council allow it at any time to make decisions </p>
<p>about any measures which could be required to eliminate real threats. The </p>
<p>important thing now is to achieve a comprehensive settlement based on political </p>

<p>“… we are prepared to interact on this platform with other members of the Security </p>
<p>Council. This is what we have been called on to do by the vast majority of the </p>
<p>international community during the discussions … We are convinced that Security </p>
<p>Council members will not be able to ignore this call.” </p>
<p><b>554. </b> In a second intervention, Mr Aldouri made a number of further points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council was “fully aware that the only objectives of the approaching war are </p>
<p>oil, wealth and hegemony … the world is now split into two and that the larger </p>
<p>part favours peace …” He was in the latter camp.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The future of the UN had “recently been jeopardised by the statement of one </p>
<p>major Power that, if the United Nations failed to take into account the interests of </p>
<p>that State, it would go its own way”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>One State had adopted war legislation during the debate, and that was “a virtual </p>
<p>declaration of war”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s doors were “open” to the inspectors. Iraq had “full trust” in Dr Blix, and </p>
<p>“he and his teams will be welcomed in Iraq”. Iraq’s “hands were now clean” and </p>
<p>there were “no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq”. It hoped the inspectors </p>
<p>would “return soon” so that they “could tell the international community that Iraq” </p>
<p>had no WMD. Iraq would not “in any way hinder the work of the inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>American and British officials had “made clear statements to the effect that </p>
<p>sanctions and the embargo will never be lifted until there has been ‘regime </p>
<p>change’ in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>555. </b> The report of the second day of the debate from the UK Mission in New York </p>
<p>stated that the Security Council was “almost unanimously open to a new resolution” that </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>strengthened inspections.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> There was overwhelming support for two stages “or at least </p>
<p>a continued central role for the Council” in authorising military action. There was “an </p>
<p>overwhelming dislike of unilateral action and strong desire for [a] diplomatic solution”. </p>
<p><b>556.  Sir John Holmes advised that France was likely to stand firm on the need for </b></p>
<p><b>a two stage approach, which would leave the UK in an uncomfortable dilemma.</b></p>
<p><b>557. </b> Sir John Holmes advised that France thought that it was winning the argument </p>
<p>and did not think that much would happen until the debate on Iraq in the Security </p>
<p>Council on 16 October.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> France “remained convinced of the need for the international </p>
<p>community to stay united to avoid an explosion of unrest and terrorism”. It was </p>
<p>concerned about “the catastrophic consequences of a war on Iraq without clear proof </p>
<p>of Saddam’s WMD ambitions and full international, including Arab, support”. France </p>
<p>would “nevertheless” be:</p>
<p>“… ready to support military action if the full cycle of inspections/renewed (serious) </p>
<p>Iraqi misbehaviour/international agreement can be gone through, and have </p>
<p>confirmed that someone else’s veto of a second resolution would not deter them if </p>
<p>they were convinced of the need for action. But they are uncomfortably aware that </p>
<p>there may … not be time available for this full cycle to be gone through before the </p>
<p>presumed climatic window … for military action closes.” </p>
<p><b>558. </b> That led to two reflections which were “mutually contradictory”: that the US </p>
<p>was “bent on war come what may … and are only looking for the UN to endorse a </p>
<p>casus belli” or that “even the US are not mad enough to embark on military action … </p>
<p>without significant international support”. Both led “the French to think that they </p>
<p>should stand firm”. </p>
<p><b>559. </b> Sir John concluded that, if the deadlock was not broken, the UK risked “being left </p>
<p>in the most uncomfortable position of all, choosing whether to follow the US without UN </p>
<p>cover, with all that entails, domestically and internationally”. He understood the UK’s </p>
<p>“reluctance to get squeezed between the Americans and the French”, but suggested that </p>
<p>Mr Blair might have a “crucial” role.</p>
<p><b>The US offers compromise language for OP10</b></p>
<p><b>560.  The US tabled compromise language on 16 October intended to bridge the </b></p>
<p><b>difference between the US and French positions, deliberately creating ambiguity </b></p>
<p><b>by stating that the Security Council would “consider” reports of a breach, not </b></p>
<p><b>“decide” if a breach existed.</b></p>
<p><b>561.  That language remained virtually unchanged in the final resolution.</b></p>

<p><b>562.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that US “understood and accepted” </b></p>
<p><b>the UK’s need for a second resolution but did not want this “spelt out” </b></p>
<p><b>in the resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>563. </b> Reporting on discussions in New York on 16 October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote </p>
<p>that the latest US draft was intended to show that the US had taken French concerns </p>
<p>seriously and made an effort to meet them halfway.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> The reference to “all necessary </p>
<p>means” had been removed and the draft provided for a Security Council meeting. The </p>
<p>US would not agree to the Council “explicitly taking the decision to approve force; but </p>
<p>that did not mean that the Council would not take it”. Sir Jeremy reported that President </p>
<p>Bush had personally approved the draft text in OP10.</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that he had told Ambassador Negroponte that Mr Straw </p>
<p>had made clear to Secretary Powell that the UK “needed a second resolution. It was </p>
<p>extremely unlikely we could find a legal basis without it.” The US “understood and </p>
<p>accepted” the UK need for a second resolution; “but it didn’t have to be spelt out in the </p>
<p>resolution”. Sir Jeremy had agreed but warned that, if the formulation in the draft “made </p>
<p>it through the Council, the explanations of vote were likely to make it unequivocally clear </p>
<p>there needed to be a second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>565. </b> In relation to a discussion about the political importance of interviews to the US, </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy reported that the language on interviews would be unchanged. In response </p>
<p>to his concerns that the draft language would make it harder to secure interviews and </p>
<p>that Dr Blix was likely to oppose it, Ambassador Negroponte had said the arrangements </p>
<p>were discretionary. </p>
<p><b>566. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that the French Mission had been pleased with the </p>
<p>indications of US movement, but were likely to suggest France should “push for an </p>
<p>amendment saying that the Council would convene immediately to ‘consider any </p>
<p>measures’”. He had warned Mr Levitte that there would be “a very big reaction” if the </p>
<p>compromise was rejected. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that the new text had a “good chance of being a basis for </p>
<p>progress so long as the French are not foolish enough to reject it”. It was clear the US </p>
<p>had “no appetite to give more ground”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>568. </b> Sir Michael Wood drew the Inquiry’s attention to the “American compromise </p>
<p>language” handed over in New York by Ambassador Negroponte to Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> It stated that the Security Council would: </p>
<p>“… convene immediately, upon receipt of a report … [of a breach] in order to </p>
<p>consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all the relevant Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions in order to restore international peace and security.” </p>
<p><b>569. </b> That paragraph remained virtually unchanged throughout the rest of the negotiation </p>
<p>and became OP12 of resolution 1441. </p>
<p><b>570. </b> Before a meeting planned for 17 October, Mr Straw sent a handwritten letter </p>
<p>to Mr Blair addressing the differences of view within the US Administration.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>571. </b> Mr Straw wrote that Mr Blair should read the record of his conversation with </p>
<p>Secretary Powell, which would give him a “flavour of the intense and dangerous </p>
<p>arguments in the Administration”. </p>
<p><b>572. </b> In response to Mr Blair’s question about whether Secretary Powell was “winning”, </p>
<p>Mr Straw wrote that “he should win in the end”, but Mr Blair had a critical role to play. </p>
<p>Mr Straw advised that Mr Blair now needed “to give some clear messages” to President </p>
<p>Bush that:</p>
<p>“… we’ll have to settle for a two resolution approach; that it is safe to do so; and </p>
<p>that the non&#8209;UN approach being pushed by Cheney et al would be a catastrophe for </p>
<p>the US, and whatever your personal sentiment, not something where you would get </p>
<p>support, still less obtain legal authority. In other words, you need to tell him that you </p>
<p>have politics too. At present, partly because they are mesmerised with your standing </p>
<p>in British politics, they (White House) take your support for any US position for </p>
<p>granted. This (a) is to misread your position (b) weakens people like Powell.” </p>
<p><b>573. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“David and I can work up a good case for two resolutions to put to Bush – not a </p>
<p>climb&#8209;down or a wimp&#8209;out, but a way of squaring – and then cornering Chirac – </p>
<p>by a private deal with him on the second resolution.” </p>
<p><b>574. </b> Sir David Manning spoke twice to Dr Rice on 16 October.</p>
<p><b>575. </b> In the first conversation they discussed possible wording for the draft resolution </p>
<p>which avoided conceding that the Security Council would “decide” on the action to be </p>
<p>taken in the event of a report of a serious breach by Iraq and leave the question of a </p>
<p>decision ambiguous.</p>

<p><b>576. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice agreed that everyone knew that the Security Council would </p>
<p>have to meet if Dr Blix reported that the Iraqis were in breach; and that everyone knew </p>
<p>that the French could table another resolution at that point if they wanted to. Sir David </p>
<p>told Dr Rice that “it was important to signal, through the new resolution, that the Security </p>
<p>Council was united in its determination to support Blix and bring the maximum pressure </p>
<p>to bear on Saddam to disarm. We had to go through this process.”</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Mr Powell asked, “Where does this leave us with the AG [Attorney General]?”</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>578. </b> Sir David responded:</p>
<p>“Can’t say at this stage.</p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p>Will almost certainly be the beginning not the end of the negotiation with </p>
<p>the French.</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>If we have a material breach in OP1 with an open OP10 (ie consultations) </p>
<p>we shall still be in the same place with the AG as before – at least I </p>
<p>presume so. Still better for us to get a pre&#8209;cooked second resolution.”</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>579. </b> In the second conversation, Dr Rice told Sir David that the US had agreed to put </p>
<p>new language “in play” while ensuring that it remained clear to everyone that the US </p>
<p>would insist on safeguarding its freedom to act if the UN would not.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>580. </b> Sir David Manning also wrote to Mr Powell, pursuing the idea that Mr Blair could </p>
<p>suggest a private agreement to President Bush on the text of a second resolution </p>
<p>authorising “all necessary means”, which the UK would table at the UN Security Council </p>
<p>“if and when appropriate”.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> Sir David thought it “could be a tough sell” but Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock thought it was “possible”. Sir David added: “This would give us legal cover.”</p>
<p><b>581. </b> Mr Powell marked the minute to Mr Blair “to see”.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>582.  Mr Straw clearly expected that in response to a breach, a second resolution </b></p>

<p>306</p>
<p><b>584.  Mr de Villepin made clear that the decision would be made by President </b></p>
<p><b>Chirac. </b></p>
<p><b>585. </b> In the conversation with Mr de Villepin on 17 October, Mr Straw reminded him of </p>
<p>his “undertaking not to veto” a second resolution “if Iraq were obviously in breach, and of </p>
<p>his suggestion that France might participate in military action even if someone else had </p>
<p>vetoed (following the Kosovo precedent)”. Mr de Villepin had not demurred.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>586. </b> Mr Straw told Mr de Villepin that Secretary Powell had “moved mountains </p>
<p>to accommodate French concerns” and that the draft resolution “referred explicitly </p>
<p>to a further meeting of the Council”:</p>
<p>“The US could not accept language requiring a further SCR, but they accepted that </p>
<p>a further meeting implied a second SCR whether moved by them or other members </p>
<p>of the Council. There was no need to spell this out …” </p>
<p><b>587. </b> Mr de Villepin:</p>
<p>“… described the new text as very good and a basis for final agreement. He </p>
<p>accepted the need for some ambiguity, so was prepared to agree the verb ‘consider’ </p>
<p>rather than ‘decide’, which he recognised was too much for the US. But … [h]e </p>
<p>would like language along the lines of: ‘… consider the situation and any necessary </p>
<p>measures to ensure full compliance …’.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>588. </b> Mr Straw warned Mr de Villepin that:</p>
<p>“… pressing the US for more … risked making the best the enemy of the good … </p>
<p>Levitte could use his EOV [Explanation of Vote] to explain the French interpretation, </p>
<p>even if it were not possible to get the exact language they wanted. He explained </p>
<p>at some length that, in English political language, ‘consider’ was an active verb </p>
<p>implying a subsequent decision. It was a stronger concept than the French </p>
<p>equivalent. He also explained that ‘need’ should be read as embracing ‘measures’.”</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Mr de Villepin warned Mr Straw that:</p>
<p>“… although he entirely took the point about the debate within the US Administration, </p>
<p>he would have to persuade Chirac, who would probably want the text strengthened. </p>
<p>For Chirac the second step had to have credibility.”</p>
<p><b>590. </b> In their further conversation, Mr Straw:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Urged Mr de Villepin “to take Yes for an answer”, which Mr de Villepin was </p>
<p>reported to have “agreed; as soon as he got an answer from Chirac on </p>
<p>‘measures’”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Warned Mr de Villepin not to make an issue of the “material breach” language </p>
<p>in OP1. That was “a matter of historical fact and, with the new OP10, no longer </p>
<p>permitted the one stage approach France had feared”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Told Mr de Villepin that the French position was “a matter of trust for the UK as </p>
<p>well as the US. Villepin’s reassurances about France’s willingness to support </p>
<p>and participate in military action if justified had empowered Powell to get the </p>
<p>changes made in OP10. If France tried to get ‘material breach’ language out of </p>
<p>OP1, those in the [US] Administration who opposed the UN route would argue </p>
<p>that France could not be trusted on a second SCR.”</p>
<p><b>591. </b> Mr de Villepin was reported to have responded “somewhat half&#8209;heartedly” that </p>
<p>“others in the Council opposed ‘material breach’ language … and that the SCR should </p>
<p>focus on the need for inspections rather than looking back”. He had not suggested it was </p>
<p>a French “red line”.</p>
<p><b>592. </b> Mr Straw concluded that, if President Chirac “were willing to sign up to the new </p>
<p>OP10 language, he would have more negotiating room … should he want to reach </p>
<p>a private agreement on how to move forward”.</p>
<p><b>593. </b> In a statement for the Inquiry, Sir Michael Wood wrote:</p>
<p>“Early the next morning (17 October) the Foreign Secretary ran through the new </p>
<p>OP10 with the French Foreign Minister, saying in this context that the US could not </p>
<p>accept any language requiring a further Security Council resolution but that they </p>

<p>a clear understanding that if [Dr] Blix reported an Iraqi breach of the first resolution, </p>
<p>then Saddam would not have a second chance. In other words, if for some reason </p>
<p>(such as a French or Russian veto) there were no second resolution agreed in those </p>
<p>circumstances, we and the US would take action.”</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>598. </b> The meeting also agreed that, “at the time the first resolution was passed”, the UK:</p>
<p>“would make three public points:</p>
<p>(a)  When the Inspectors returned, Iraq’s obligation was not only to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>with them on access to sites etc, but also to provide accurate and full </p>
<p>information about WMD.</p>
<p>(b)  If Iraq breached this resolution, action would follow.</p>
<p>(c)  In the meantime we could not assume a peaceful solution to the problem of </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD, so we would outline the military preparations we were making. </p>
<p>(It was important to do this only once the resolution was passed, and not </p>
<p>before.)” </p>

<p><b>601. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the meeting had: </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>310</p>
<p><b>Legal views on the draft resolution</b></p>
<p><b>613.  Mr Wood remained concerned about the references to the “Kosovo model” </b></p>
<p><b>providing a precedent and that the draft resolution then under discussion did not </b></p>
<p><b>have the effect of reviving the authority to use force.</b></p>
<p><b>614. </b> Mr Wood wrote to Mr Chaplin on 17 October to express concerns about Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>statement, reported in the record of a conversation with President Bush on 14 October, </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“… the Kosovo model would allow a return to the Security Council for a further </p>
<p>discussion in the event of a further breach by Iraq; but if there were UN inaction </p>
<p>(i.e. no second UN resolution authorising the use of force) we would take action.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>615. </b> Mr Wood was “concerned that the conversation does not take full account of legal </p>
<p>advice”. The legal justification for action in Kosovo was an overwhelming humanitarian </p>
<p>catastrophe which could not be prevented by any other means. That was not the </p>
<p>position in Iraq. The “Kosovo model” was “no authority for a proposition that action would </p>
<p>be legally justified if authority from the Security Council had been sought but without </p>
<p>success”. The facts available to Mr Wood did “not justify action in self&#8209;defence”. “The </p>
<p>use of force would, therefore, be unlawful unless authorised by the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>616. </b> Mr Wood added: </p>
<p>“There is currently no express authorisation to use force against Iraq, nor would </p>
<p>a resolution on the lines discussed … give an implied authorisation based on the </p>
<p>revival of the authority to use force contained in resolution 678 (1990). Subject </p>
<p>to consideration of a final text (and the circumstances of its adoption), a finding </p>
<p>of material breach in OP1 of the current text, followed by a long list of provisions </p>
<p>detailing the action which the Council expects Iraq to take, together with a final </p>
<p>paragraph which indicates that the Council would need to meet in the case of a </p>
<p>further breach by Iraq, or some such, would not permit the revival argument. Rather, </p>
<p>it would point to further action to be taken by Iraq, and then by the Council if Iraq </p>
<p>were not to co&#8209;operate. </p>
<p>“In my view, we need to write urgently to No.10 recalling the legal position.” </p>
<p><b>617. </b> When Mr Wood saw Mr Rycroft’s record of Mr Blair’s meeting on 17 October, </p>
<p>he sent an “urgent and personal” minute to Mr Ricketts, stating: </p>
<p>“The concerns in my minute to Edward Chaplin earlier today are reinforced by [the] </p>
<p>record of the Prime Minister’s meeting this morning, suggesting that ‘if for some </p>
<p>reason [such as a French or Russian veto] there were no second resolution … we </p>
<p>and the US would take action’.</p>

<p> He drew attention to the key elements of the draft which were </p>
<p>“particularly relevant to the issue of whether it could be regarded as authorising the </p>

<p>aware, a finding by the Council that Iraq was in material breach of its obligations under </p>
<p>the cease&#8209;fire resolution 687, together with a warning that Iraq would face serious </p>
<p>consequences in the event of continued non&#8209;compliance, “can have the effect of reviving </p>
<p>the authorisation to use force”. The draft, however, had to be “read as a whole” and </p>
<p>other paragraphs gave “a clear indication that further action would be for the Council”. </p>

<p>LORD GOLDSMITH’S CONVERSATIONS WITH MR POWELL AND MR STRAW,  </p>
<p>17 AND 18 OCTOBER 2002</p>
<p><b>623.  Lord Goldsmith raised his concerns with Mr Straw on 18 October.</b></p>
<p><b>624.  Mr Straw persuaded Lord Goldsmith not to put his views in writing until </b></p>
<p><b>he had spoken to Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>625.  Mr Straw told Lord Goldsmith that he accepted a second resolution would </b></p>
<p><b>be needed “unless circumstances changed”, but he argued that could not be </b></p>
<p><b>acknowledged publicly for tactical reasons.</b></p>
<p><b>626.  Mr Straw subsequently advised Mr Blair that they should camp on the </b></p>
<p><b>position they had both taken publicly not to rule out involvement in military </b></p>
<p><b>action if circumstances required that and, for example, a second resolution </b></p>
<p><b>were to be vetoed.</b></p>
<p><b>627. </b> Lord Goldsmith spoke to Mr Jonathan Powell on 17 October to register his </p>
<p>concerns about what Mr Blair was reported to have told President Bush on 14 October. </p>
<p>Mr Powell suggested that he should speak to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Asked how Mr Powell had responded, Lord Goldsmith was unable to recall any </p>
<p>further details of his conversation with Mr Powell than the details in the record of his </p>
<p>discussion with Mr Straw the following day.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>629. </b> Lord Goldsmith spoke to Mr Straw on 18 October. </p>
<p><b>630. </b> Both Ms Adams and Mr Straw’s Private Office made records of the conversation. </p>
<p>There is a considerable difference in emphasis between the two documents. </p>
<p><b>631. </b> Ms Adams recorded that Lord Goldsmith had told Mr Straw that “he was concerned </p>
<p>by reports he had received” that Mr Blair had indicated to President Bush that “he would </p>
<p>join the US in acting without a second Security Council decision if Iraq did not comply </p>
<p>with the terms of a resolution in the terms of the latest US draft”.</p>

<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>632. </b> In Lord Goldsmith’s view, the “draft would not be sufficient to authorise the use </p>
<p>of force without a second resolution”. He had made that clear the previous day to </p>
<p>Mr Powell, who had suggested that he should speak to the Prime Minister. </p>
<p><b>633. </b> Discussing the detail of the draft, Lord Goldsmith reiterated that he was “very </p>
<p>troubled by the way things appeared to be going”. </p>
<p><b>634. </b> Ms Adams reported that Mr Straw had “explained the political dimension”, his </p>
<p>conviction that the “strategy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the US was right </p>
<p>politically”, and the importance of obtaining a “decent Security Council resolution”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair had said that the UK would act in accordance with international law:</p>
<p>“That remained the position. The consequences of acting unlawfully were clearly </p>
<p>unacceptable. But it was important not to suggest publicly that we had doubts </p>
<p>about the proposed resolution. It would make the prospects of reaching agreement </p>
<p>remote.” </p>
<p><b>635. </b> Mr Straw told Lord Goldsmith that he had made Lord Goldsmith’s views on the </p>
<p>legal position clear to Mr Blair. </p>
<p><b>636. </b> Lord Goldsmith responded that he understood the politics and the importance </p>
<p>of getting President Bush “behind” a UN resolution. He was:</p>
<p>“… not concerned about what Ministers said externally, up to a point. The </p>
<p>Government must, however, not fall into the trap of believing it was in a position to </p>
<p>take action which it could not take. Nor must HMG promise the US Government that </p>
<p>it can do things which the Attorney considers to be unlawful.” </p>
<p><b>637. </b> Ms Adams recorded that Mr Straw commented that he believed Secretary Powell </p>
<p>“understood the legal position”.</p>
<p><b>638. </b> Recalling his advice to Mr Blair of 30 July, Lord Goldsmith told Mr Straw that he </p>
<p>might “now need to send a further note”. Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… recognised that circumstances may change, but he wished to make clear to </p>
<p>the Foreign Secretary that his firm view was that if a resolution was adopted in the </p>
<p>terms of the present US draft, and if Blix subsequently reported to the Council that </p>
<p>there had been a breach by Iraq, the resolution as it stands would not be sufficient to </p>
<p>authorise the use of force without another Security Council resolution.”</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Mr Straw was recorded as suggesting that Lord Goldsmith might:</p>
<p>“… not wish to commit himself on paper until he had seen the Prime Minister. There </p>
<p>might be circumstances, for example, if Russia vetoed a second resolution in the </p>
<p>face of clear evidence that Iraq was flouting the Council’s demands, in which force </p>
<p>would be justified on the basis of existing resolutions. The French had indicated that </p>
<p>they would support such an interpretation.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>640. </b> Lord Goldsmith had agreed but “stressed that he wished to ensure that his advice </p>
<p>was clearly on the record”. Mr Straw had “assured” Lord Goldsmith that Mr Blair was </p>
<p>fully aware of Lord Goldsmith’s views. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Finally, Ms Adams recorded that Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… hoped that, if there were any further meetings … at which decisions on the use </p>
<p>of force were to be made, the Foreign Secretary would make clear that the Attorney </p>
<p>ought to be present. The Foreign Secretary agreed.”</p>
<p><b>642. </b> The note of the conversation produced by Mr Straw’s Private Office records that </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith told Mr Straw that the latest draft of the resolution “did not provide legal </p>
<p>authorisation for the use of force”.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> In a discussion of the tactics necessary to persuade </p>
<p>the US to take the UN route, Lord Goldsmith said he was:</p>
<p>“… comfortable with what had been said publicly so far. He noted the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s assurance to Bush that we would participate in military action should </p>
<p>the Security Council route fail, but he took the Foreign Secretary’s point that to </p>
<p>maintain influence over the American approach, we had to demonstrate that we </p>
<p>stood shoulder to shoulder. The Foreign Secretary reassured the Attorney that both </p>
<p>he and the Prime Minister had explained our legal position to Powell and Bush who </p>
<p>understood the constraints.”</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Lord Goldsmith and Mr Straw agreed that discussions within Government “should </p>
<p>take full account of the legal issues”. Mr Straw “accepted” that “unless circumstances </p>
<p>changed … we would need a second resolution to authorise the use of force” but </p>
<p>“tactically, we should not commit ourselves to this externally yet”. Mr Straw also pointed </p>
<p>out that he “could envisage circumstances in which it might be possible to take action </p>
<p>without specific Security Council authority”, but “obviously the Government would need </p>
<p>the Attorney’s advice”. Lord Goldsmith would be seeing Mr Blair the following week and </p>
<p>he and Mr Straw would keep in touch.</p>
<p><b>644. </b> The FCO record of Lord Goldsmith’s conversation with Mr Straw was sent to </p>
<p>Mr Ricketts. It was also sent to the Private Secretaries of Mr Straw and Sir Michael Jay, </p>
<p>FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), Mr Wood, Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of FCO </p>
<p>United Nations Department and other senior officials. </p>
<p><b>645. </b> No record of the conversation between Lord Goldsmith and Mr Straw appears </p>
<p>to have been sent to UKMIS New York.</p>
<p><b>646. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Lord Goldsmith wrote that he had not had the </p>
<p>opportunity to consider the draft resolution in detail before his telephone call to Mr Straw, </p>
<p>but his view was that the draft was not sufficient to authorise the use of force.</p>

<p><b>647. </b> Lord Goldsmith explained that his telephone call to Mr Straw had been “prompted” </p>
<p>when he had learned of Mr Blair’s statement to President Bush (on 14 October) that he </p>
<p>would join the US in acting without a second Security Council resolution:</p>
<p>“I thought that such action by the UK would be unlawful and I felt strongly that there </p>
<p>had to be recognition within government of the constraints under which we were </p>
<p>acting, and we should not lead the US to believe that we would take action … I knew </p>
<p>too that if we boxed ourselves into a corner that would make my task when I came </p>
<p>to advise on the effect of the resolution more difficult.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Lord Goldsmith confirmed that Mr Straw had persuaded him not to provide a note </p>
<p>of advice until he (Lord Goldsmith) had seen Mr Blair.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> Mr Straw had said that there </p>
<p>might be circumstances in which the UK could proceed without a second resolution, for </p>
<p>example if Russia exercised a veto unreasonably. Lord Goldsmith wrote that although he </p>
<p>“was not persuaded by that example … it did make sense to him to have a discussion </p>
<p>with the Prime Minister … before putting his advice in writing”. </p>
<p><b>649.  Intense discussions on the elements of a draft resolution continued. </b></p>
<p><b>650. </b> Reporting a discussion on 16 October, Sir Christopher Meyer wrote that Mr Sandy </p>
<p>Berger, President Clinton’s National Security Advisor, thought that an attack on Iraq </p>
<p>would be “very risky” and might destabilise a number of countries in the region. In </p>
<p>addition, he “thought that, whatever the scenario, the British Government has got itself </p>
<p>into the position where it would go with the US whatever the circumstances. ‘The die </p>
<p>is cast for the UK.’”</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>651. </b> Sir Christopher also reported that Mr Berger could envisage a situation where </p>
<p>UNMOVIC might find “something nasty” and the US “would want to go to war”, but </p>
<p>others on the Security Council would say that it “showed inspections were working and </p>
<p>that they should continue”.</p>
<p><b>652. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Powell that that was “an inherent risk in the </p>
<p>UN route”; and that: “Other routes were even riskier.”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>653. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Annan discussed the need to bring the discussions on a </p>

<p>They did not want to see action on the slightest pretext but they were worried that in the </p>

<p>intended to authorise the use of force”. Mr Brummell’s note records that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>replied that it was “not easy to see how there is room for arguing that a condition of </p>
<p>reasonableness can be implied as a precondition for the lawful exercise of a veto”; but </p>
<p>he agreed to give the issue further consideration. </p>
<p><b>669. </b> Mr Brummell wrote that it would “be important for the Attorney to be kept closely </p>

<p>whether there is general support within the Council and the wider community for military </p>

<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>The UK’s draft strategic objectives</b></p>
<p>The preliminary objective for UK policy in Iraq agreed by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon in May, </p>
<p>and recorded in Mr Hoon’s minute to Mr Blair of 31 May 2002 (see Section 3.3), was </p>
<p>revised in October 2002.</p>
<p>Mr Stephen Wright, FCO Deputy Under Secretary Defence and Intelligence, told the first </p>
<p>FCO co&#8209;ordination meeting on 6 September that, following a conversation with the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff, he thought more work needed to be done on strategic campaign objectives.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>Mr Bowen sent a draft to Sir David Manning on 4 October, explaining that “Whitehall would </p>
<p>find it helpful” to agree objectives “for the present phase of activity” and, “in particular, it </p>
<p>would help us in formulating an information strategy”.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The draft stated that the UK’s prime objective was: </p>
<p>“… to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated </p>
<p>programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles (BM) … in </p>
<p>accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions … an expression of the </p>
<p>will of the international community, with which Iraq has persistently failed to comply, </p>
<p>thereby perpetuating the threat to international peace and security.” </p>
<p>Other objectives included the desired end&#8209;state for Iraq,</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> to which “and providing </p>
<p>effective and representative government for its own people” had been added; and </p>
<p>restoring the authority of the UN. The draft also stated that: “Success in achieving </p>
<p>our prime objective should help deter the proliferation of WMD and B[allistic] M[issiles] </p>
<p>more generally.” </p>
<p>The Cabinet Office draft identified the immediate priorities as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>achieving “a tough new UNSCR”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the return of inspectors to Iraq “under conditions which enable them to identify and </p>
<p>eliminate prohibited WMD/BM material, associated equipment and activity”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enabling UNMOVIC and the IAEA to institute a regime of long&#8209;term monitoring and </p>
<p>verification measures to ensure compliance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining “international solidarity behind the UN Security Council and support </p>
<p>for effective … action” by UNMOVIC and the IAEA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preserving regional stability; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to “make military plans and preparations in case military action” was </p>
<p>required to “force compliance with UNSCRs”.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Bowen advised that some had argued that the aspirations for the future of Iraq should </p>
<p>be translated into the main objective. He had resisted:</p>
<p>“… on the grounds that our purpose has been plainly stated by the Prime Minister </p>
<p>as disarmament and because the effective implementation of that policy does not </p>
<p>necessarily deliver our wider aspirations”. </p>

<p>The objectives would also need to “evolve with changing circumstances”.</p>
<p>Mr Bowen stated that the paper was not intended for publication: if Mr Blair was content, </p>
<p>Sir David would “no doubt … arrange for it to be sent to DOP [Defence and Overseas </p>
<p>Policy Sub&#8209;Committee of Cabinet] colleagues” (see Section 2). </p>
<p>Mr Bowen’s advice was also sent to Sir David Omand, Cabinet Office Permanent </p>
<p>Secretary and Security and Intelligence Co&#8209;ordinator, Mr Scarlett, and to officials in the </p>
<p>FCO, the MOD and the Home Office.</p>
<p>Mr Ian Lee, MOD, Director General Operational Policy, sent a copy of the draft to </p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s Private Office, commenting that while the text was “helpful” it did not “go far </p>
<p>enough in providing direction for current military activity and an information strategy”.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Lee did not expect the draft to move forward until there was a clear UN position.</p>
<p>Pointing out that there was “a good deal of contingency planning work going on in </p>
<p>Whitehall to support action in the United Nations on Iraq”, Sir David Manning wrote on </p>
<p>22 October to Mr McDonald and the Private Secretaries of DOP members to inform them </p>
<p>that Mr Blair had approved the objectives enclosed with his letter, which “should help </p>
<p>guide work in Departments for current phase of activity”.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The letter was also sent to the Private Secretaries to Mr David Blunkett (the Home </p>
<p>Secretary), Mr John Prescott and Mrs Margaret Beckett (the Environment, Food and Rural </p>
<p>Affairs Secretary).</p>
<p>The objectives were unchanged from those proposed by Mr Bowen on 4 October.</p>
<p>The draft objectives underpinned subsequent policy statements both to explain the UK’s </p>
<p>position and to maintain the pressure on Saddam Hussein to comply with the demands of </p>
<p>the international community. </p>
<p>Mr Straw formally announced the UK’s objectives on 7 January 2003 (see Section 3.6).</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>677. </b> On 22 October, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed French and Russian </p>
<p>concerns that the draft text had reintroduced “automaticity” in the preambular </p>
<p>paragraphs (PPs) and in OPs 1&#8209;3.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>678. </b> Mr Powell suggested to Sir David Manning that it was “Worth bringing to the AG’s </p>
<p>attention. Shows Russians and French think OPs 1&#8209;3 [?] automaticity.”</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>679. </b> Following the conversation between Mr Straw and Secretary Powell, the FCO </p>
<p>told UKMIS New York on 22 October that it could confirm that the UK would act as </p>
<p>co&#8209;sponsor of the resolution if that was what the US wanted.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>680.  In the face of signs of mounting US impatience with the UN process, Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>sought to persuade President Bush to continue to negotiate a resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>681.  Mr Blair continued to assert that the UK would take action in the event </b></p>
<p><b>of a further material breach by Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>682.  Mr Blair did not offer any caveats to reflect the views Lord Goldsmith </b></p>
<p><b>had expressed.</b></p>
<p><b>683. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that, after the “difficult” discussions of the draft text </p>
<p>between the P5 in New York on 22 October, Mr Blair thought the time had come to engage </p>
<p>Foreign Ministers directly in the debate.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> He had asked Mr Straw to talk to Secretary </p>
<p>Powell “about a meeting at Foreign Minister level” early the following week. Dr Rice </p>
<p>thought that was an attractive idea which she would discuss with Secretary Powell.</p>
<p><b>684. </b> Mr Blair also thought “we should revisit the possibility of agreeing the wording of a </p>
<p>short second resolution that the P5 would table if Saddam violated the terms of the first </p>
<p>resolution”. Sir David added:</p>
<p>“If we could secure this, the French and the Russians would have acknowledged, in </p>
<p>writing, that they would be ready to use ‘all necessary means’ if Saddam were again </p>
<p>in material breach.”</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Sir David reported that Dr Rice had doubts: </p>
<p>“… the difficulty would be that the French or the Russians would quibble over </p>
<p>whether Saddam had committed a violation serious enough to trigger the follow </p>
<p>up action required for the second resolution.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>686. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David that the objections raised by France in relation:</p>
<p>“… to the language dealing with: ‘material breach’; ‘serious consequences’; and </p>
<p>OP5 … were unacceptable to Washington. The US had gone a long way in meeting </p>
<p>French and Russian difficulties. The earlier reference to ‘all necessary means’ had </p>
<p>been dropped … there was agreement to go back to the Council to assess any </p>
<p>Blix report of violations; and it was clear to everyone that a second resolution could </p>
<p>be tabled by the French whatever the US and UK might prefer. The Administration </p>
<p>could not give any more ground … on the substance. There had been lots of </p>
<p>publicity about US concessions already. Today there were two editorials in major US </p>
<p>newspapers … saying it was time for Washington to put down its draft resolution … </p>
<p>either the UN backed the resolution; or the US went to war.” </p>
<p><b>687. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that he “understood the political pressures” but the effect </p>
<p>of tabling a resolution “on a take&#8209;it or leave&#8209;it basis would not necessarily be clear </p>
<p>cut”. France and Russia might table a resolution which might attract more support. </p>
<p>In response to a comment from Dr Rice that the US and UK “would have to veto the </p>
<p>counter&#8209;draft just as the French and Russians would no doubt veto ours”, Sir David </p>
<p>replied that was possible, “but deeply unattractive”. That was why the UK had proposed </p>
<p>discussion at Foreign Minister level.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Dr Rice told Sir David that the: </p>
<p>“Essential elements for the US were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maintaining the references to ‘material breach’ and ‘serious consequences’</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Retaining the wording ‘… false statements or omissions … and failure by </p>
<p>Iraq at any time to comply …’</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Standing firm on the terms of the inspections regime</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No further weakening of OP12.”</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Sir David stated that the UK’s willingness to co&#8209;sponsor the resolution </p>
<p>demonstrated that it was “in firm agreement on the elements” of the resolution, but he </p>
<p>“accepted that there might be differences on where to compromise if there was a serious </p>
<p>negotiation”. That would be a matter “for the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary” </p>
<p>whom he would consult. Dr Rice also said she would try to set up a conference call </p>
<p>between herself, Sir David, Secretary Powell and Mr Straw. </p>
<p><b>690. </b> Dr Rice concluded that France still seemed to misunderstand the US position, and </p>
<p>its apparent belief that the US would, if pushed, concede was “mistaken”. “Washington </p>
<p>was ready to go it alone if it had to; and the consequence would be that the UN would </p>
<p>be marginalised for a long time to come.”</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Sir David suggested that he was not sure President Chirac understood. It “seemed </p>
<p>to him” that President Chirac’s “grasp of the issue” was “uncertain, and sometimes </p>
<p>emotional”. Dr Rice should talk to the Élysée.</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>692. </b> Sir David wrote that he had told Mr Straw there were “signs of mounting impatience </p>
<p>in the White House with the whole UN process”. He added:</p>
<p>“Apparent evidence, too, that this is pushing the White House to consider putting </p>
<p>the resolution down, and challenging the French (and Russians) to block it. Condi’s </p>
<p>mood this morning was that the US had made enough concessions. If the UN </p>
<p>process failed, Paris and Moscow would be responsible for the broken UN china …”</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that he should tell President Bush to persist </p>
<p>with the UN route despite the frustrations and that “real negotiations” were “just </p>
<p>beginning”. The domestic pressures on President Bush to do so were considerable. </p>
<p>There was nervousness in Middle America about war on Iraq without UN cover, or </p>
<p>without UK company. That gave the UK “leverage in the UN context”. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> In his conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair accepted that the negotiations </p>
<p>in New York were in pretty good shape: the three vital elements in the resolution were </p>
<p>material breach, the declaration of Iraqi WMD, and the tough inspection regime.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>695. </b> Mr Blair’s view was that those provisions should not be weakened. If they were </p>
<p>agreed, the UK could accept a further Security Council discussion in the event of a </p>
<p>breach, but “on the understanding that either this discussion would then authorise action </p>
<p>or if it did not we would go ahead anyway”. </p>
<p><b>696. </b> To ensure that President Bush understood the UK position, Mr Blair underlined the </p>
<p>importance for the UK of securing the first resolution.</p>
<p><b>697. </b> Mr Blair also stated that he continued to think that tough inspections just might lead </p>
<p>to the collapse of Saddam Hussein’s regime. </p>

<p><b>US/UK draft resolution, 23 October 2002</b></p>
<p>Key revisions in the text tabled in the Security Council by the US and UK on 23 October </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new <b>OP2</b> recalling that the Council had repeatedly warned Iraq that it would </p>
<p>face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its objectives, </p>
<p>replacing the reference to all necessary means in the initial OP10; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new <b>OP4</b> deciding that false statements and omissions in the declarations </p>
<p>submitted by Iraq (pursuant to this resolution &#8209; the original OP2 provisions) </p>
<p>and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co&#8209;operate fully in the </p>
<p>implementation of this resolution shall constitute a further material breach </p>
<p>of Iraq’s obligations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new <b>OP11, </b>a revision of the previous OP9, directing Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei </p>
<p>to report immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection </p>
<p>activities, as well as any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations, </p>
<p>including its obligations regarding inspections under this resolution; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new <b>OP12, </b>a revision of the previous OP10, deciding that the Council would </p>
<p>convene immediately upon receipt of a report (in accordance with OP11) to </p>
<p>consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all the relevant </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions in order to restore international peace and security.</p>
<p><b>702. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that he had stated: </p>
<p>“In terms of process this was the first time we … had a text worth putting down </p>
<p>as [the] basis for discussion. The text gave Iraq a clear warning that it had a last </p>
<p>chance to comply with strengthened UN inspections. This was a genuine offer … </p>
<p>the co&#8209;sponsors were proposing two clear stages. No decisions on further action </p>
<p>would be taken until inspections had been tested by UNMOVIC/IAEA, professional </p>
<p>and independent bodies. If [they] reported problems, the text made clear that the </p>

<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was a long drawn out process and progress was slow. </p>
<p><b>711. </b> In discussion a number of points were made:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A strong resolution was required so that Saddam Hussein would understand that </p>
<p>the disarmament of Iraq would be achieved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of a breach of that resolution, the Security Council’s response would </p>
<p>determine its future reputation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If there was military action and Iraq responded with chemical or biological </p>
<p>weapons, a humanitarian disaster could ensue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Effective disarmament of Iraq through inspection remained a possibility, as did </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime cracking under the pressure applied.</p>
<p><b>712. </b> Mr Blair stated that Iraq would continue to be discussed in Cabinet, “including </p>

<p>Mr Blair over reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries </p>
<p>that: </p>
<p>“They had also had some pretty fiery exchanges on Iraq, TB telling him [President </p>

<p><b>717. </b> Reporting discussions with a wide range of colleagues in New York, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock said he had told Ambassador Negroponte that there was a case for putting </p>
<p>the US/UK text into near final form (“into the blue”) on 25 October, to pre&#8209;empt possible </p>
<p>alternative texts being tabled by France or Russia. “Doing so would show that we were </p>
<p>serious about not wasting time.”</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Ambassador Negroponte agreed. The three compromise changes discussed with </p>
<p>the UK on 23 October “were getting nowhere in Washington”: “The main stumbling block </p>
<p>was State Department lawyers.” </p>
<p><b>719. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that, as he saw the UK’s position, “we had no fear of a second </p>
<p>stage Council discussion. We would not be bound if, at that stage, the Council funked its </p>
<p>responsibilities.” He “did not understand why the US lawyers were frightened. This would </p>
<p>simply mean taking the process to that point.” Sir Jeremy “asked if UK pressure would </p>
<p>help”. He also suggested amending OP11 to require Dr Blix to report “any systematic </p>
<p>interference”, rather than “any interference”.</p>
<p><b>720. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Negroponte had also said Mr Lavrov had told </p>
<p>him he had been instructed to make clear that the draft resolution was “unacceptable” </p>
<p>and “Russia would veto”.</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Sir Jeremy commented:</p>
<p>“The tactical manoeuvring is now getting sharp. Lavrov’s veto threat is presumably </p>
<p>agreed by Putin. My instinct is to regard this as hard negotiating … they [the </p>
<p>Russians] would not veto on their own. But it makes clear that, whatever further </p>
<p>concessions are squeezed out of the Washington system, the Russians will not </p>
<p>vote positively.</p>
<p>…</p>

<p>was a potential trigger for military action.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> They agreed that the issue needed to be </p>
<p>addressed. </p>
<p><b>723. </b> During the discussion in the Security Council on 25 October Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock stated that the draft:</p>
<p>“… was a text about disarmament and nothing else. It was not, and would not be, a </p>
<p>text that established a casus belli. The whole point was to make clear that Iraq had </p>
<p>not complied, but … we were giving it a last chance to get this right through peaceful </p>
<p>disarmament. OP4 did not establish that a false declaration or omission was, on its </p>
<p>own, a casus belli. There were no triggers except as set out in OPs 11 and 12, ie </p>
<p>requiring a second stage of Council business.”</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>724. </b> Discussions also focused on whether the finding of material breach in OP1 would </p>
<p>be framed in the past or present tense, and the need to make clear that it did not </p>
<p>constitute a trigger for action. </p>
<p><b>725. </b> Reporting informal consultations between Security Council members and Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Dr ElBaradei on 28 October, the UK Mission in New York advised that there was </p>
<p>support for most provisions in the UK/US draft resolution. Both Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei </p>
<p>had emphasised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of clear and unified support for inspections from the Council;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA should choose their staff; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the modalities for the conduct of interviews should be left to the inspectors.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>726. </b> There were foreseeable practical difficulties with interviews outside Iraq. Dr Blix </p>
<p>was aware of the large responsibility placed on UNMOVIC in reporting Iraqi interference </p>
<p>and failure to comply. Its reports would have to be accurate. But that would not mean </p>
<p>war and peace were in the inspectors’ hands – they would simply report to the Security </p>

<p><b>Decision to offer a land contribution to the US for planning purposes</b></p>
<p><b>735.  The MOD advised Mr Blair on 29 October that its influence on US planning </b></p>
<p><b>was reducing and the option to deploy UK ground forces was at risk of being </b></p>
<p><b>excluded by default. The only way to avoid that was to offer Package 3 to the </b></p>
<p><b>US for planning on the same basis as Package 2.</b></p>
<p><b>736.  Package 3 could also significantly reduce the UK’s vulnerability to US </b></p>
<p><b>requests to provide a substantial and costly contribution to post&#8209;conflict </b></p>
<p><b>operations. </b></p>
<p><b>737. </b> Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning on 29 October, to report that “US military </p>
<p>planning [was] continuing, but increasingly assuming no UK Land contribution”; and </p>
<p>that an option for a “significant land contribution” could be “sensibly kept open only </p>
<p>by placing it on a similar basis” to Package 2.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>738. </b> The MOD stated that Package 3 was:</p>
<p>“… for practical purposes being excluded by default. If we are to keep the option </p>
<p>open, and continue to have the strongest military cards to underpin our political </p>
<p>influence, the Defence Secretary believes that we should indicate to the US that </p>
<p>they should plan on the assumption that the land contribution would be available, </p>
<p>subject to final political approval … It is also worth noting that, while Package 3 </p>
<p>is significantly more expensive in itself than Package 2, making it available could </p>
<p>significantly reduce our vulnerability to US requests to provide a substantial (and </p>
<p>costly) contribution to post&#8209;conflict stabilisation operations.”</p>
<p><b>739. </b> The MOD letter and the advice for Mr Blair from Sir David Manning are addressed </p>
<p>in Section 6.1. </p>

<p><b>741.  The decision to offer ground forces (Package 3) to the US for planning </b></p>

<p><b>been difficult to withdraw and constrained the UK’s subsequent policy choices. </b></p>
<p><b>742. </b> Mr Blair, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce discussed the MOD wish to offer </p>

<p>the UK was “prepared to put Package 3 on the same basis as Package 2 for planning </p>

<p><b>746.  Sir David Manning raised the possibility with Dr Rice of delaying action </b></p>
<p><b>until winter 2003 in view of the potential mismatch between the timetable for </b></p>
<p><b>inspections and the US military plan, but there was no substantive discussion </b></p>
<p><b>of that option. </b></p>
<p><b>747. </b> Sir David Manning flew to Washington on 31 October for talks with Dr Rice, </p>
<p>Secretary Powell and Mr Richard Armitage, US Deputy Secretary of State.</p>
<p><b>748. </b> The record of the discussions sent to Whitehall stated that Sir David had </p>
<p>“underlined the importance for the UK of a UNSCR” and had discussed the prospects </p>
<p>for reaching agreement. The US was working on a revised text. Sir David had “a strong </p>
<p>impression that the gap between [the US and France] had widened again”.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p><b>749. </b> A separate private minute from Sir David to Mr Blair reported concern about </p>
<p>whether the potential difficulties in reaching agreement with the French had been </p>
<p>underestimated, and an assurance that President Bush understood the UK’s political </p>
<p>constraints.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>750. </b> The other major issue discussed was whether a UK military force would be </p>
<p>permitted to transit through Turkey. </p>
<p><b>751. </b> Sir David Manning reported that he and Dr Rice had discussed the fact that “the </p>
<p>UN inspection timetable was now out of sync with the timetable for possible military </p>
<p>action beginning in early January”. He had asked “whether we might now be looking at </p>
<p>the second of the original ‘windows’ ie a campaign next winter rather than this”. That had </p>
<p>not been ruled out but the conversation had shifted to the prospects for internal regime </p>
<p>change sparing the need for military action. The best chance of securing that was “a </p>
<p>very tough UN resolution accompanied by threatening military preparations, in the hope </p>
<p>that Saddam’s system would implode under the strain”. </p>
<p><b>752. </b> Sir David reported that Dr Rice had been focused on events developing in a way </p>
<p>which meant military action might not be necessary. He speculated whether that might </p>
<p>indicate a shift in the US attitude. They had also discussed the possibility of issuing </p>
<p>an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein and his sons to leave Iraq if he was in breach of </p>
<p>the resolution. </p>
<p><b>753. </b> In conclusion, Sir David reported that there had been a “pretty sharp change of </p>
<p>mood over the past three months, perhaps fuelled by polls which show growing doubts </p>

<p>if it suggested “a new wariness at the heart of the [US] Administration”. </p>
<p><b>Final stages of the negotiation of resolution 1441</b></p>
<p><b>754.  Cabinet was informed on 31 October that a UN resolution was likely to be </b></p>

<p><b>755. </b> On 31 October, Mr Straw told the Cabinet that the Security Council was in the </p>
<p>final stages of the negotiation of a resolution on Iraq.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> The text would need to meet </p>
<p>French concerns that it would not provide a pretext for war and UK and US concerns to </p>
<p>avoid too restrictive a formulation on what would follow an Iraqi breach of the resolution. </p>
<p>The most likely outcome was a resolution the following week. The pressure to reach </p>
<p>closure was “growing”.</p>
<p><b>756. </b> In discussion the need for the inspection regime to be tough and for existing </p>
<p>defects to be rectified, and for the resolution to provide for further discussion in the </p>
<p>Security Council, were raised. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> Mr Blair concluded that a “robust resolution was required which would send a clear </p>
<p>message to Saddam Hussein. If Iraq did not comply there would be further discussion </p>
<p>in the … Security Council of the next steps.”</p>

<p><b>759. </b> In a conversation with Mr Straw on 1 November, Mr Ivanov stated that efforts </p>
<p>should be concentrated on two sets of questions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The provisions in the resolution on inspection procedures should reflect the </p>
<p>views of Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei. In his view, that would be “difficult, but </p>
<p>feasible”. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>760. </b> Mr Ivanov was reported to be content for the resolution to contain references </p>
<p>to previous material breaches:</p>

<p><b>763. </b> Mr Straw responded that:</p>

<p><b>782. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“… it is not clear when that manuscript note was made. In any event I do not believe </p>
<p>that I saw it and there was no request to advise on the effect of the words. I feel </p>
<p>reasonably confident that if I had been asked about those words I would have said </p>
<p>that they were problematic and would have argued for their removal. In the event, </p>

<p><b>786. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that there was a chance, albeit a small one, that under </p>
<p>the pressure and humiliation of inspections the regime might crumble. They “must play </p>
<p>into that” and “be very tough, to encourage regime members to split off”. A psychological </p>
<p>profile would be useful. </p>
<p><b>787. </b> Mr Blair said that: </p>
<p>“… there must be a clear understanding that if there were a further breach action </p>
<p>must follow; we should imply, without spelling it out, that if there were a veto in those </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>336</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Lavrov was disappointed that the draft did not take on board comments </p>
<p>on a number of issues, but he had been instructed to focus on four:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“… 30 days was unrealistic for a declaration covering non&#8209;WMD chemical </p>
<p>and biological programmes.” That was “important given omissions … could </p>
<p>trigger a material breach”. </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The draft language in OP4 “created a casus belli before the report reached </p>
<p>the Council”. He had been instructed to insist on the earlier French </p>
<p>formulation, referring to a material breach being reported to the Council, </p>
<p>“in accordance with Ops 11 and 12”. </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>A preference for French language on Presidential sites in OP7.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The reference to restoring international peace and security in the draft </p>
<p>of OP12 was not appropriate “(it was not clear it would need restoring)”. </p>
<p>He could compromise on “secure”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Wang Yingfan, Chinese Permanent Representative to the UN, shared </p>
<p>Mr Lavrov’s view on OP4 and was not clear what “assessment” meant </p>
<p>in Chinese. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Levitte said that unanimity was essential. OP4 “had to refer to OPs 11 ‘and’ </p>
<p>12, not 11 ‘or’ 12”: “‘Or’ could mean a meeting taking place, not on a report from </p>
<p>Blix, but from a Council member. If this was the intention, the result would be </p>
<p>conflicting reports from different Members. If reports were not sent through Blix </p>
<p>or ElBaradei we would end up with a very ambiguous situation … He expected </p>
<p>Powell and Villepin to address the issue.”</p>
<p><b>797. </b> In subsequent discussion, the US said OP4 created a distinction between an </p>
<p>“automatic casus belli” and “automaticity for the use of force”: “further failures to comply </p>
<p>would constitute a material breach, but that material breach would result in a Council </p>
<p>discussion”. Ambassador Negroponte “clarified” that an omission in the declaration </p>
<p>(required by OP3) “on its own would not constitute a material breach”. </p>
<p><b>798. </b> In a bilateral discussion with Ambassador Negroponte, Sir Jeremy suggested that </p>
<p>“and” could be reinstated in OP4 but the use of “or” should be retained in OP12 (which </p>
<p>provided for the Council to convene immediately upon receipt of a report in accordance </p>
<p>with OP4 or OP11).</p>

<p>CABINET, 7 NOVEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>799.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 7 November that after the return of inspectors </b></p>

<p>likely to take place the following day and described its provisions.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> The aim was to </p>
<p>achieve unanimity, which would be a triumph for UK and American diplomacy. </p>
<p><b>801. </b> In discussion, it was suggested that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>public opinion in the US, which had in the past not been supportive of the UN, </p>
<p>was now supportive of the multilateral approach;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inspections had to be done properly and would need to be backed by a sufficient </p>
<p>level of military threat to ensure Iraq’s compliance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the facts of any breach would be reported by the inspectors, with the Security </p>
<p>Council having to judge what the facts meant; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>media speculation that pressure on Iraq was about access to oil supplies and </p>
<p>that British companies would be disadvantaged was not helpful.</p>
<p><b>802. </b> Mr Blair concluded that “after the return of inspectors tricky questions would arise </p>
<p>about whether Iraq had breached its obligations and what steps should be taken”. </p>
<p>The resolution “should send a clear message to Iraq in terms of what the international </p>
<p>community required and the consequences of non&#8209;compliance”. The “need to move </p>
<p>forward on the Middle East Peace Process had not been overlooked”.</p>
<p>MR STRAW’S CONVERSATION WITH LORD GOLDSMITH, 7 NOVEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>803. </b> In preparation for a discussion between Mr Straw and Lord Goldsmith, Mr Wood </p>
<p>wrote to Mr Straw on 6 November offering his view of the legal considerations.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Wood emphasised that it was important that anything said by the Government, either </p>
<p>publicly or to the US or others, was not incompatible with the position under international </p>
<p>law. All statements, including Explanations of Vote and Parliamentary Statements, </p>
<p>should be seen by the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. </p>
<p><b>804. </b> Mr Wood identified “the most difficult question on which doubtless we shall be </p>
<p>pressed, is what the legal position would be if [in the event of a further material breach </p>
<p>by Iraq] the Council ‘fails to act’ at a second stage”. He wrote: </p>
<p>“The first resolution [what became 1441] … does not itself authorise the use of force, </p>
<p>or revive the authorisation to use force given in SCR 678. Although OP1 decides </p>
<p>that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of the cease&#8209;fire resolution, the </p>
<p>remaining paragraphs (and in particular OPs 11 and 12) indicate that the Council </p>
<p>has decided to take action itself if the breach continues or if there are further </p>
<p>violations. This is the case even though OP4 remains in the resolution.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>“If at a second stage the Council authorises the use of force, or uses language </p>
<p>which revives the authorisation given by SCR 678 … the position will be relatively </p>
<p>straightforward. </p>
<p>“If, however, the Council is unable to take a decision at the second stage, whether </p>
<p>because there are insufficient votes for another resolution, or a resolution is vetoed, </p>
<p>there will be nothing to point to by way of revival of the authorisation to use force </p>
<p>given in SCR 678. We have previously noted that this is not a judgment to be made </p>
<p>unilaterally by individual Member States.” </p>
<p><b>805. </b> Mr Wood also addressed the position if the Security Council failed to act in </p>
<p>response to a further material breach by Iraq:</p>
<p>“The position that could arise if the Council ‘fails to act’ was … addressed, in </p>
<p>hypothetical terms, by the then Law Officers in November 1997. After concluding </p>
<p>that in circumstances then prevailing an essential precondition for the use of force </p>
<p>was appropriate action by the Council, the Law Officers went on to say that they ‘did </p>
<p>not exclude the possibility’ (though they reached no firm conclusion) that exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances could arise in which it was generally accepted by the international </p>
<p>community as a whole that Iraq had in effect repudiated the cease&#8209;fire and that a </p>
<p>resort to military force to deal with the consequences of Iraq’s conduct was the only </p>
<p>way to ensure compliance.</p>
<p>“Too much should not be read into this … The possibility raised in 1997 has not been </p>
<p>relied upon and is not based on authority or precedent. In any event, the situation </p>
<p>envisaged was a very narrow one where the international community as a whole </p>
<p>favoured action but the Council decided not to act.”</p>

<p><b>813.  Mr Straw told Parliament that the UK’s objective was consensus on a tough </b></p>
<p><b>resolution that left Iraq under no illusions about the need for disarmament.</b></p>
<p><b>814.  The UK wanted a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and the best chance </b></p>
<p><b>of achieving that was a clear and credible threat of the use of force.</b></p>
<p><b>815.  If Saddam Hussein failed to comply, it was open to any member of the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council to table a further resolution seeking UN support for the use of </b></p>
<p><b>force and the UK reserved the right to do so. But Mr Straw could not anticipate </b></p>
<p><b>what could happen. </b></p>
<p><b>816.  Whether military action was justified would depend on the circumstances. </b></p>
<p><b>The UK reserved its “right” within international law to take military action if that </b></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>818. </b> Mr Straw stated:</p>

<p>“The text sets out the procedure to be followed in the case of failure by Iraq to </p>

<p>should be reported to the Security Council. It directs in operative paragraph 11 the </p>

<p>“Britain wants a peaceful resolution to this crisis, and the United States has </p>
<p>shown by its engagement in the long negotiation over the past weeks that it too </p>

<p>“… in the event of non&#8209;compliance, no further resolutions will be required? Is it </p>
<p>implicit in the resolution that action is already justified by the existing and continuing </p>
<p>breach of Iraq’s obligations?”</p>
<p><b>824. </b> In response, Mr Straw referred to the provisions of OPs 1, 2 and 3&#8209;10, adding:</p>
<p>“… under operative paragraph 11, the inspectors are under a duty to report to the </p>
<p>Security Council if they come across any breach; and under operative paragraphs </p>
<p>4 and 11, the Security Council can – and will – resume its meetings to consider the </p>
<p>circumstances if there is a breach.</p>
<p>“I do not want to anticipate what will happen if there is a breach, except to say that </p>
<p>although we would much prefer decisions to be taken within the Security Council, we </p>
<p>have always made it clear that within international law we have to reserve our right </p>
<p>to take military action, if that is required, within the existing charter and the existing </p>
<p>body of UN Security Council resolutions, if, for example, a subsequent resolution </p>
<p>were to be vetoed … I do not believe it will come to that.”</p>

<p><b>825. </b> Asked by Mr George Osborne (Conservative) if UN&#8209;authorised military action </p>
<p>would require a new resolution if Iraq was in material breach of the resolution, Mr Straw </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“The processes set out in the Security Council resolution are complicated … False </p>
<p>statements or omissions or failure to comply, as set out in operative paragraph 4, </p>
<p>will amount to a material breach, and any reporting by the inspectors may turn out </p>
<p>to show a material breach. Then, under operative paragraph 12, the Security Council </p>
<p>will meet to discuss the matter. Any member of the Council can table a resolution, </p>
<p>and it remains to be seen whether the Security Council or individual members </p>
<p>judge that a further resolution is necessary to deal with the material breach that </p>
<p>is presented to them. It is complicated, but it is clear.”</p>
<p><b>826. </b> Asked if the British Government intended to table a resolution seeking UN support </p>
<p>for the use of force in the event that Saddam Hussein failed to comply, Mr Straw replied </p>
<p>that it was “open to any member of the Security Council … to put forward a resolution or </p>
<p>resolutions” and that the UK reserved the right to do so. But he could not “at this stage </p>
<p>anticipate what could happen”.</p>
<p><b>827. </b> Asked by Ms Ann Clwyd (Labour) about progress using international law to set </p>
<p>up a war crimes tribunal on Iraq, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“We have been making as much progress as we can in respect of indicting war </p>
<p>criminals in Iraq. I recognise my hon. Friend’s feeling that is not sufficient and I </p>
<p>will continue to pursue indictment in the United Kingdom … I speak to … Attorney </p>
<p>General about this from time to time. I shall be seeing him again this afternoon for </p>
<p>a further discussion. We certainly do not rule out an international tribunal trying </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and others in his Government for war crimes.”</p>
<p><b>828. </b> In response to other points raised by MPs, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… any decisions that we make in respect of military action will be made within </p>
<p>the context of the body of international law, of which Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>form part, but not the whole.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “best chance of a peaceful solution to the crises” was “through unanimity </p>
<p>of the international community and a clear and credible threat of the use of </p>
<p>force” if Iraq did not comply. He remained “quite optimistic” that the process </p>
<p>could work.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The text did not define “material breach” because it was “a term of art familiar </p>
<p>in international law”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In relation to who was to decide if there was a material breach, it would “become </p>
<p>patent [sic] whether there has been a material breach”, and what followed would </p>
<p>“in the first instance be a matter for discussion within the Security Council”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the resolution was passed unanimously, there would be “clear deadlines for </p>
<p>compliance”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>342</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether military action was justified in law “with or without a second resolution” </p>
<p>would depend on the circumstances, which he could not predict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “now a great emerging consensus” which recognised that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein had “been in the most terrible breach of international obligations … and </p>
<p>that the time had come to require that awful, terrible regime to put right those </p>
<p>breaches”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no trip wires in the resolution”; the UK had “been extremely careful </p>
<p>to ensure” that there were none. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was working on the basis that Saddam Hussein was “a liar and a cheat”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He and Mr Blair were aware “of the anxieties of the public … about the prospect </p>
<p>of military action”, and: “Military action should never be used except as a last </p>
<p>resort when all other possibilities have been exhausted.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “would prefer to stay with the UN Security Council route” but “must </p>
<p>reserve the right, within our obligations under international law, to take military </p>
<p>action if we deem that necessary, outwith a specific Security Council resolution </p>
<p>being passed in the future”. The UN Charter, Security Council resolutions and </p>
<p>customary international law were the basis of international law, and judgements </p>
<p>about whether military action was “necessary and justified” had to be made </p>
<p>on “that totality”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The prospect of military action was seen “very much as a last resort”; if the </p>
<p>resolution was passed, the prospect of military action would recede.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>835. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Mr Lavrov had sought an addition to OP4 </p>
<p>providing for a material breach to be “reported [to] and assessed by the Council”, and </p>
<p>had also expressed concern that the “US wanted the whole Council to accept some </p>

<p><b>836. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock subsequently stated that the purpose of the resolution was:</p>
<p>“(i) to clarify and strengthen the inspections regime so that the disarmament of Iraq’s </p>
<p>WMD, in accordance with its obligations … could be brought to full and verified </p>
<p>completion through this enhanced inspections regime; and (ii) to deliver the clear&#8209;cut </p>
<p>warning, one final time, that failure to comply with its disarmament obligations would, </p>

<p><b>837. </b> The US and UK also made clear that the resolution provided for a two stage </p>

<p><b>838. </b> Following discussion with Washington and agreement with the UK, the US </p>
<p>delegation introduced a revised text. The decision that a further material breach would </p>
<p>be “reported to the Council in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12”, not “11 or 12”, </p>
<p>in OP4 was described as a “substantial change”. At the request of Russia, “secure” </p>
<p>replaced “restore” in OP12.</p>
<p><b>839. </b> Mr Lavrov had also asked the US and UK for confirmation that the “failures” </p>
<p>referred to in OP4 related to WMD programmes, and to clarify whether they understood </p>

<p>Iraq “has been and remains in material breach of … relevant resolutions, including </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations”. The Security </p>

<p>to full and verified completion the disarmament process established by … resolutions </p>
<p>of the Council” (<b>OP2</b>).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “shall provide … not later than 30 days from the date of this resolution, a currently </p>
<p>accurate, full and complete declaration of all aspects of its programmes to develop </p>

<p><b>Explanations of Vote</b></p>

<p><b>of Vote did not directly address the issue of whether there should be a further </b></p>
<p><b>resolution and decision by the Security Council, stating only that, in the event of </b></p>
<p><b>a report of a further breach, the UK “would expect the Security Council to meet its </b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities”.</b></p>
<p><b>848. </b> As Sir Jeremy Greenstock had predicted, each member of the Security Council </p>
<p>made a statement explaining the basis for its vote, and in a number of cases its </p>
<p>interpretation of the provisions of the resolution.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> Many Member States, including </p>
<p>the US and the UK, stressed that resolution 1441 did not provide “automaticity” for </p>
<p>the use of force. </p>
<p><b>849. </b> Referring to his statement on 17 October, during the Security Council’s open </p>
<p>debate on Iraq, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that there was “no shadow of doubt” that </p>
<p>Iraq had defied the UN and had sought to hinder and frustrate inspections since 1991.</p>
<p><b>850. </b> Sir Jeremy also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“With the adoption of this resolution the Security Council has clearly stated </p>
<p>that the United Nations will no longer tolerate this [Iraq’s] defiance.” Iraq was </p>
<p>“being given a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations; </p>
<p>a final opportunity to remedy its material breach of resolution 687”. The regime </p>
<p>in Baghdad faced “an unequivocal choice: between complete disarmament and </p>
<p>the serious consequences indicated in paragraph 13” of the resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The unanimous support of Council members sent the most powerful signal that </p>
<p>Iraq could no longer evade its obligations. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Because of the strength of that signal there was “at last a chance” that Iraq </p>
<p>would “finally comply … and that military action can be averted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The provisions agreed in the resolution made the practical arrangements set out </p>
<p>by the inspectors legally binding. That would “reinforce international confidence </p>
<p>in the inspectors”. It would also, he hoped, “lead Iraq away from a fatal decision </p>
<p>to conceal weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council had “heard loud and clear … the concerns about ‘automaticity’ and </p>
<p>‘hidden triggers’ – the concern that on a decision so crucial we should not rush </p>
<p>into military action; that on a decision so crucial any Iraqi violations should be </p>
<p>discussed by the Council”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As a co&#8209;sponsor of the resolution, the UK would be “equally clear in response”. </p>
<p>There was: “… no ‘automaticity’ in this resolution. If there is a further Iraqi breach </p>
<p>of its disarmament obligations, the matter will return to the Council for discussion </p>
<p>as required in paragraph 12.” The UK “would [then] expect the Security Council </p>
<p>to meet its responsibilities”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Ultimately” the choice lay with Iraq “whether to take the peaceful route to </p>
<p>disarmament”. The UK hoped it would do so: disarmament “by peaceful means” </p>
<p>remained “the UK’s firm preference”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq chose “defiance and concealment, rejecting the final opportunity” it had </p>
<p>been given, the UK “together, we trust with other Members of the Security </p>

<p>“By this resolution we are now united in trying a different course … to send a clear </p>
<p>message to Iraq insisting on disarmament … or face the consequences. </p>
<p>“… This resolution is designed to test Iraq’s intentions … Every act of Iraqi </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance will be a serious matter, because it would tell us that Iraq has no </p>
<p>intention of disarming. </p>
<p>“… this resolution contains no ‘hidden triggers’ and no ‘automaticity’ with respect to the </p>
<p>use of force. If there is a further Iraqi breach, reported to the Council by UNMOVIC, </p>
<p>the IAEA or a Member State, the matter will return to the Council for discussions as </p>
<p>required in paragraph 12. The resolution makes clear that any Iraqi failure to comply </p>
<p>is unacceptable and that Iraq must be disarmed … If the Security Council fails to act </p>
<p>decisively in the event of further Iraqi violations, this resolution does not constrain any </p>
<p>Member State from acting to defend itself against the threat posed by Iraq or to enforce </p>
<p>relevant United Nations resolutions and protect world peace and security.”</p>

<p>“The Resolution strengthens the role and authority of the Security Council. That was </p>

<p>maintain control of the process at each stage. </p>
<p>“That objective has been attained: in the event that … UNMOVIC or the … IAEA reports </p>
<p>to the Security Council that Iraq has not complied with its obligations, the Council </p>

<p>“… The first stage would entail a credible process to evaluate Iraq’s true military </p>
<p>capability and its intentions to use its weapons or the ability of terrorist groups to have </p>
<p>access to them. The second … would entail the agreement of the Security Council and </p>
<p>other States involved on the measures to be adopted if the evaluation process detects </p>
<p>a threat to international peace and security.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… We emphasise the importance that the Security Council decisions taken in this </p>
<p>connection must continue to comply with the principles of the Charter and international </p>
<p>law on the basis of objectively verifiable facts.</p>
<p>“We reiterate the belief reflected in the agreed text that the possibility of the use of force </p>
<p>is valid only as a last resort, with prior explicit authorisation required from the Security </p>
<p>Council.</p>
<p>“… the resolution stipulates that should Iraq fail to comply, it will be the inspectors who </p>
<p>will report to the Council. This multilateral body will then determine the nature of the </p>
<p>failure to comply, judge whether international peace and security have been imperilled, </p>

<p>and there should be no hidden triggers in 1441, which would allow the Americans </p>

<p>they hadn’t.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>856. </b> Sir John was very clear that France had deliberately accepted ambiguity about the </p>
<p>need for a further decision by the Security Council: </p>
<p>“… if the language could have been more explicit about that they would have liked </p>
<p>that, but they accepted weaker language in the interests in the end of getting a </p>
<p>result, and I think the other objective they did share at that point was getting the </p>
<p>international community united about something, which of course 1441 did, however </p>

<p>was to be sure that you had to go back to the Security Council. Now, what that </p>
<p>meant, whether it meant a resolution or not was perhaps less important to them, </p>

<p>as a sufficient legitimisation by the Security Council of military action … everybody </p>

<p>and Saddam does his best to conceal them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “duty of co&#8209;operation” meant “not just access but information. Failure to be </p>
<p>open and honest in helping the inspectors … is every bit as much a breach as </p>
<p>failure to allow access to sites.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The survival of Saddam Hussein’s regime was “in his hands”. Conflict was “not </p>
<p>inevitable”. Disarmament was.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of Saddam refusing to co&#8209;operate or a breach, there would be </p>
<p>“a further UN discussion”. There was no “automatic trigger” in the resolution. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But everyone now accepts that if there is a default … the international </p>

<p>had “aggressively pursued weapons of mass destruction, even while inspectors were </p>
<p>inside the country”. The world had learned “an essential lesson” from that experience:</p>
<p>“… inspections will not result in a disarmed Iraq unless the Iraqi regime fully </p>
<p>co&#8209;operates. Inspectors do not have the power to disarm an unwilling regime. They </p>
<p>can only confirm that a government has decided to disarm itself. History has shown </p>

<p>have something to hide.”</p>
<p><b>871. </b> President Bush warned Iraq that “the old game of cheat and retreat” would </p>
<p>“no longer be tolerated”; and:</p>
<p>“Any act of delay or defiance will be an additional breach of Iraq’s international </p>
<p>obligations, and a clear signal that the Iraqi regime has once again abandoned </p>
<p>the path of voluntary compliance.”</p>
<p><b>872. </b> Setting out the US standpoint, President Bush stated: </p>
<p>“With the passage of this resolution, the world must not lapse into unproductive </p>
<p>debates over whether specific instances of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance are serious. Any </p>
<p>Iraqi non&#8209;compliance is serious, because such bad faith will show that Iraq has no </p>
<p>intention of disarming …</p>
<p>“America will be making only one determination: is Iraq meeting the terms of the </p>
<p>Security Council resolution or not? The United States has agreed to discuss any </p>
<p>material breach with the Security Council, but without jeopardising our freedom </p>
<p>of action to defend our country. If Iraq fails to comply, the United States and other </p>
<p>nations will disarm Saddam Hussein.”</p>
<p><b>873. </b> President Bush stated that the US would support the UN inspections teams, </p>
<p>including with “information that can help identify illegal activities and materials in Iraq”, </p>
<p>and called on other nations and “patriotic Iraqis” to do the same. Saddam Hussein could </p>
<p>not “hide his weapons of mass destruction … without the co&#8209;operation of hundreds and </p>
<p>thousands of Iraqis – those who work in the weapons programmes and those who are </p>
<p>responsible for concealing the weapons”. </p>
<p><b>874. </b> Framing action on Iraq squarely in the context of the threat from international </p>
<p>terrorism, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“Americans recognise what is at stake. In fighting a war on terror, we are determined </p>
<p>to oppose every source of catastrophic harm that threatens our country, our friends, </p>
<p>and our allies … And we oppose a uniquely dangerous regime – a regime that has </p>
<p>harboured terrorists and can supply terrorists with weapons of mass destruction; </p>

<p>“The United States of America will not live at the mercy of any group or regime that </p>
<p>has the motive and seeks the power to murder Americans on a massive scale. </p>
<p>The threat to America also threatens peace and security in the Middle East and far </p>
<p>beyond. If Iraq’s dictator is permitted to acquire nuclear weapons, he could resume </p>
<p>his pattern of intimidation and conquest and dictate the future of a vital region.</p>
<p>“In confronting this threat, America seeks the support of the world. If action becomes </p>
<p>necessary, we will act in the interests of the world. And America expects Iraqi </p>
<p>compliance with all UN resolutions.”</p>
<p><b>875. </b> President Bush concluded that the UN Security Council “must maintain its </p>
<p>unity and sense of purpose so that the Iraq regime cannot revert to the strategies of </p>
<p>obstruction and deception it used so successfully in the past”. The question for Iraq was </p>
<p>whether to meet its obligations voluntarily. If it did not, the US was “prepared for the </p>
<p>alternative” and the “just demands of the world” would be met.</p>
<p><b>876. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld wrote:</p>

<p><b>879. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair stated that fighting the new threats, which crossed all </p>
<p>national boundaries and were linked to extremism and failed states, needed a unified </p>
<p>international community and that depended on a shared agenda:</p>
<p>“The real reason people worry about Iraq is that they think the US is solely </p>
<p>concerned with their issues but no&#8209;one else’s. A shared agenda can only be based </p>
<p>on a sense of fair play and justice and of one standard for all. Hence the importance </p>
<p>of the MEPP.” </p>
<p><b>880. </b> Mr Blair also commented: “helping failed states recover ie Afghanistan </p>
<p>or, potentially Iraq, can’t just be invaded and left”.</p>

<p><b>881. </b> Mr Blair began his speech:</p>
<p>“Last Friday was an important day for the world. After months of debate, the United </p>
<p>Nations came together and made its will plain. Saddam now has to decide: he </p>
<p>can either disarm voluntarily … or he can defy the world, in which case he will </p>
<p>be disarmed by force.”</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>882. </b> Most of the speech focused on the broader threat posed by WMD and terrorism, </p>
<p>stating that they were linked, and the need to counter them by moving forward the </p>
<p>Middle East Peace Process, being prepared to help failed or failing nations to recover, </p>
<p>and creating “bridges of understanding” between religions, and coalitions of force </p>
<p>buttressed by a coalition of common ideas and a shared agenda. </p>
<p><b>883. </b> Drawing together the capabilities of Iraq and North Korea, Mr Blair warned:</p>
<p>“States which are failed, which repress their people brutally, in which notions </p>
<p>of democracy and the rule of law are alien, share the same absence of rational </p>
<p>boundaries to their actions as the terrorist. Iraq has used WMD. North Korea’s </p>
<p>admission that it has a programme to produce Highly Enriched Uranium was </p>
<p>an important confession. We know that North Korea has traded ballistic missile </p>
<p>technology. We know there are other highly unstable states who want to get their </p>
<p>hands on Highly Enriched Uranium. With it a nuclear weapon could be a step away. </p>
<p>Just reflect on that and the danger is clear.</p>
<p>“And terrorism and WMD have the potential, at least, to be directly linked …”</p>
<p><b>884. </b> Mr Blair added that Al Qaida could and would buy and use WMD:</p>
<p>“So these are new and different dangers …</p>
<p>“… above all the international community needs to be unified in its response.” </p>
<p><b>885. </b> Mr Blair concluded that it would be “irresponsible to ignore the threat” posed </p>
<p>by terrorism and WMD. President Bush recognised that “full US engagement and </p>
<p>leadership” was needed, as the “decision to go through the UN on Iraq” showed. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote: </p>
<p>“We were also having to get the balance right re Bush. There was no point him </p>
<p>[TB] just getting up there and putting the US line but he did not want to be seen as </p>
<p>anything other than supportive. The question was how you weave in the argument </p>
<p>about maximising influence without being explicit.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>What was resolution 1441 intended to achieve?</b></p>
<p><b>887.  The Inquiry was given a range of views about the UK’s policy objectives </b></p>
<p><b>for resolution 1441, the relative priority of those objectives, and what had </b></p>
<p><b>been achieved.</b></p>
<p><b>888.  Some witnesses emphasised the objective of disarming Iraq through a </b></p>
<p><b>policy of coercive diplomacy and agreement on an effective inspections regime </b></p>
<p><b>without military action.</b></p>
<p><b>889.  Other witnesses emphasised the purpose of providing a legal base for </b></p>
<p><b>military action without the need for a further decision by the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>890. </b> Resolution 1441 decided (OP1) that Iraq “has been and remains in material </p>
<p>breach” of its obligations under relevant resolutions adopted by the Security Council, </p>
<p>in particular its failure to co&#8209;operate with UNMOVIC and the IAEA and to complete the </p>
<p>actions for disarmament required by resolution 687 (1991), and decided to set up an </p>
<p>enhanced inspection regime.</p>
<p><b>891. </b> In his advice of 7 March 2003, Lord Goldsmith wrote that:</p>
<p>“… while the US objective was to ensure the resolution did not constrain the right of </p>
<p>action which they believed they already had, our objective was to secure a sufficient </p>
<p>authorisation from the Council in the absence of which we would have had no right </p>
<p>to act.”</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s consideration of the legal effect of the resolution and whether </p>
<p>it achieved that objective is addressed in Section 5. </p>
<p><b>893. </b> Mr Blair was asked to provide a statement setting out:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>his understanding of President Bush’s objectives in relation to the UN;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>his objectives and strategy in the negotiation of [resolution] 1441;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether he was aware of differences between the UK’s position and prevailing </p>
<p>American objectives for 1441; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the implications of those differences for his strategy.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>894. </b> In response, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The objectives for both President Bush and myself in trying to secure a fresh </p>
<p>resolution were clear: to give Saddam one final chance to comply; and to make it </p>
<p>clear if he didn’t, then we would act, if necessary by force. In other words: change </p>
<p>of heart or change of regime. Because he had so frequently broken his word, </p>
<p>disregarded UN resolutions and refused to comply with the inspectors, we knew </p>

<p>3.5  |  Development of UK strategy and options, September to November 2002 –  </p>
<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>359</p>
<p>the wording of the resolution had to be unequivocal: he had to co&#8209;operate fully and </p>
<p>unconditionally. The stress on co&#8209;operation was deliberate. His concealment activity </p>
<p>was again very clear and had been further demonstrated by his treatment of his </p>
<p>son&#8209;in&#8209;law who had revealed his intentions, been lured back to Iraq and executed.</p>
<p>“So we had to insert language in the resolution that made this plain; and in particular </p>
<p>resist language that meant that the words ‘final opportunity’ were diluted by requiring </p>
<p>another UNSC decision. So we also sought to ensure that in the resolution itself, we </p>
<p>specifically had a provision that a failure to comply would be itself a material breach.</p>
<p>“I was kept closely in touch with the negotiation, as was Jack Straw. We were very </p>
<p>satisfied with the outcome. It achieved our objectives. We resisted attempts by </p>
<p>France to insert language that would have required an additional decision. We never </p>
<p>had a problem with another discussion in the UNSC. What we could not tolerate was </p>
<p>a situation where Saddam continued to refuse to comply fully and unconditionally </p>
<p>and yet we were powerless to act.”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>895. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“Then, but even more in retrospect, UNSCR 1441 was a pivotal moment. If Saddam </p>
<p>at that point had genuinely changed; had he welcomed inspectors and fully </p>
<p>co&#8209;operated, action would have been avoided. I made this clear to President Bush </p>
<p>and he agreed. I also think at the time those more sympathetic to Saddam thought </p>
<p>he would. The fact is he did not and the Iraq Survey Group reports show why he </p>
<p>did not.” </p>
<p><b>896. </b> Asked for a statement about what he thought would be achieved by inspections </p>
<p>and his expectations about Iraqi co&#8209;operation with UNMOVIC, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“It is fair to say that I did not think that Saddam would change his behaviour. His </p>
<p>record was clear. On the other hand he might have.”</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>897. </b> Mr Blair cited Libya’s response to the events of 9/11, which had condemned </p>
<p>the attack and co&#8209;operated in pursuing Al Qaida, as evidence of a country which had </p>
<p>demonstrated “a genuine change of heart, a strategic decision to alter” its position in the </p>
<p>world. Saddam Hussein’s actions and behaviour, including payments to the families of </p>
<p>Palestinian suicide bombers, had shown “a completely different attitude”. Inspections </p>
<p>were “necessary”, but they could only be successful with genuine co&#8209;operation.”</p>
<p><b>898. </b> Asked at what point he had asked for and received advice about what would </p>
<p>happen if the inspectors did get back into Iraq, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that “the view of </p>
<p>our system was, and certainly the intelligence services, was the likelihood that Saddam </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p>would play around, but I always thought it was possible that he would realise that this </p>
<p>was the moment of choice”.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p><b>899. </b> In the context of advice from officials in the 19 July Cabinet Office paper, ‘Iraq: </p>
<p>Conditions for Military Action’, that the inspectors would “need at least six months”, </p>
<p>Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“For me it was never a matter of time but a matter of attitude. You could have given </p>
<p>him [Saddam Hussein] longer than six months if he was co&#8209;operating but if he was </p>
<p>not it wouldn’t really matter … I do not accept that if Blix had carried on doing his </p>
<p>inspections we would have found out the truth.”</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>900. </b> In his first statement for the Inquiry, Mr Straw wrote that the UK objective was </p>
<p>to secure agreement to:</p>
<p>“… a robust text which provided terms for the readmission of inspectors to Iraq, </p>
<p>and their unfettered operation, which was tough but not so tough that the Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein regime could plausibly reject them altogether.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>901. </b> Asked whether the purpose of 1441 was to ensure the return of the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors to Iraq, or to create the conditions necessary to justify military action, </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“The purpose of 1441 was as it stated. It was to secure compliance by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein with the obligations imposed on him by the Security Council. As I have </p>
<p>said probably to the point of tedium, had Saddam complied with the resolution, he </p>
<p>would have stayed in post. At the very minimum it would have been impossible for </p>
<p>any British Government to have taken part in any military action, but I don’t believe </p>
<p>military action would have taken place, because the casus belli would have gone …<b> </b></p>
<p>It was not there as an excuse for military action. Certainly not … sometimes </p>
<p>diplomacy has to be backed by the threat and, if necessary, the use of force …<b> </b>It </p>
<p>was, to use the jargon, based on the idea of coercive diplomacy, but its purpose was </p>
<p>to secure compliance, essentially the disarmament of Iraq, and that’s what we set </p>
<p>about achieving.”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>902. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“The resolution provided the best hope there was of resolving the crisis through </p>
<p>peaceful means. The obligations that it imposed on the Iraqi government were easy </p>
<p>to meet. Iraq had to make a full declaration of all its WMD programmes, and allow </p>
<p>the IAEA and UNMOVIC inspectors unrestricted access. I often said that ‘we would </p>
<p>take yes for an answer’. There would have been no possibility whatever of war if the </p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>361</p>
<p>inspectors had reported in unequivocal terms that Iraq was complying with 1441. </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 was the means of enabling Saddam to say ‘yes’. But we could only </p>
<p>resolve this peacefully with the threat of military action.”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>903. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote:</p>
<p>“The UK … was interested in ending the threat from Iraq of the use of WMD against </p>
<p>UK interests. If this could be done by a successful and effective UN regime of </p>
<p>intrusive inspections, this was preferable to a war.”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>904. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“UK strategy was influenced by two principal factors: the need to research every </p>
<p>possible angle for the disarmament of Iraq through means short of the use of actual </p>
<p>force; and the need to establish with the greatest international consensus the </p>
<p>justification for the use of force, if force in the end proved necessary. This meant </p>
<p>… that the UN inspectors had to return to Iraq to establish in detail whether or not </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was complying with UN resolutions, under conditions that both </p>
<p>attracted support within the Security Council and gave the inspectors a real chance </p>
<p>of achieving something useful.”</p>
<p>309</p>
<p><b>905. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote: </p>
<p>“The US … was keen to impose terms on Saddam Hussein which made the case </p>
<p>for military measures unquestionable if he did not fulfil them. There was therefore </p>
<p>an American interest in setting the bar very high for Iraq.”</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>906. </b> Sir Jeremy added:</p>
<p>“The UK, on the other hand, was interested in ending the threat from Iraq from the </p>
<p>use of WMD against UK interests. This could be done by a successful and effective </p>
<p>UN regime of intrusive inspections, this was preferable to a war.” </p>
<p><b>907. </b> Sir Jeremy wrote that it was the expectation of many Member States that there </p>
<p>would be a Security Council decision before force was used:</p>
<p>“Most members of the Council, however, made an assumption that further </p>
<p>discussion in the Security Council about Iraqi compliance would itself lead to a </p>
<p>decision for or against the use of force. In public explanations of vote after 1441 was </p>
<p>adopted, only Mexico was absolutely explicit that this was their expectation. France </p>
<p>and Russia were not so explicit, which implied to me that they recognised that 1441 </p>
<p>did not amount unambiguously to such a condition.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p><b>908. </b> Sir Jeremy also wrote:</p>
<p>“… the UK was not specific in saying that a new decision would not be necessary. </p>
<p>Nor in fact was the United States. We left it that SCR 1441 would have to speak </p>
<p>for itself.</p>
<p>“The UK’s actual position was that the whole corpus of resolutions, from SCR 678 </p>
<p>and 687 onwards, substantiated the case for the use of force against Iraq, through </p>
<p>the termination of the 1991 ceasefire, if Iraq was shown not to have complied </p>
<p>with relevant resolutions. In taking this position, we were using exactly the same </p>
<p>approach as in justifying the bombing of Iraq in December 1998, which up to this </p>
<p>time had never been contested on a legal basis by another Member State.”</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>909. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry that, in negotiating resolution 1441, the UK had:</p>
<p>“… had to scale Washington’s more unilateral ambitions back down to something </p>
<p>that was negotiable within the Security Council.”</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>910. </b> Subsequently, Sir Jeremy said: “it was an important objective of our diplomacy </p>
<p>that we should have as large a consensus in the Security Council as possible for those </p>
<p>reasons of legitimacy”.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>911. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“We found language to express a consensus that meant that the inspectors </p>
<p>would normally be expected to declare whether or not Saddam Hussein was in </p>
<p>compliance, but there could also be a report from other sources that there was </p>
<p>non&#8209;co&#8209;operation or non&#8209;compliance … Secondly, that if there was a report that </p>
<p>there was non&#8209;compliance, the Security Council would meet to assess what that </p>
<p>meant, and that was the only requirement of the resolution. It was not expressly </p>
<p>stated in any operative paragraph of 1441 that the Security Council should meet and </p>
<p>decide what to do in the case of non&#8209;compliance, and that was where the French </p>
<p>and the Americans met, that there should be a further stage of consideration but that </p>
<p>further stage of consideration should not necessarily mean that there would be a </p>
<p>further decision of the Security Council if force had to be used under the terms of the </p>
<p>whole corpus of resolutions up to that point.”</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>912. </b> Sir Jeremy added:</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>363</p>
<p><b>913. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The French and Russians and some others were absolutely determined to establish </p>
<p>that there should be no use of force without a specific decision of the UN Security </p>
<p>Council. The United States was absolutely determined to resist the need for a </p>
<p>specific decision by the United Nations Security Council on the use of force. Those </p>
<p>two positions were irreconcilable.”</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>914. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“It was actually quite surprising to me that only the Mexican delegation said </p>
<p>unequivocally that they expected that, if it came to the use of force, it would be solely </p>
<p>the Security Council that had the authority to take that decision. The Irish delegate </p>
<p>said something similar … but not as unequivocally as the Mexicans. Strangely, the </p>
<p>French and the Russians, who were, as it were, our antagonists in this operation in </p>
<p>the Security Council, were equivocal in what they said in their explanations of vote, </p>
<p>which they had to be, because they had tried to negotiate specific language in 1441 </p>
<p>and they had failed to negotiate that.”</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>915. </b> Summing up the position following adoption of Resolution 1441, Sir Jeremy said: </p>
<p>“This is where diplomacy gets clever and, as you can see from the outcome, from </p>
<p>1441, too clever for its own good, but diplomacy got clever and it produced a text in </p>
<p>1441 that was equivocal on two issues: one, what should happen if Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>and his regime did not comply with the terms of 1441; and who should be the judge </p>
<p>of whether or not Iraq was complying with the terms of 1441.”</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>916. </b> Sir Jeremy also told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It was not expressly stated in any operative paragraph of 1441 that the Security </p>
<p>Council should meet and decide what to do in the case of non&#8209;compliance, and that </p>
<p>was where the French and the Americans met, that there should be a further stage </p>
<p>of consideration but that further stage of consideration should not necessarily mean </p>

<p>320</p>
<p><b>917. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… there was a surge of hope after 1441. 1441 was quite a remarkable achievement </p>
<p>and if the Security Council could once more come together, as it had before, and </p>
<p>we could see a track record going way back into the 90s, that, when the Security </p>

<p>this problem through the inspection route and without military action.”</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>918. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Pattison offered his perspective “on how FCO </p>
<p>policy officials understood” resolution 1441 “at the time of its drafting”.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>919. </b> Mr Pattison wrote that the “objectives in negotiating the text were clear by early </p>
<p>September 2002”. The FCO wanted “if possible to secure a resolution which:</p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p>brought the UN back into the process by putting the focus on the disarmament </p>
<p>process (rather than follow the perceived US agenda of regime change);</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>made clear that Iraq had an absolutely final opportunity to comply with UN </p>
<p>demands; and </p>
<p>(iii)  contained authorisation to use force if necessary.”</p>
<p><b>920. </b> Mr Pattison’s “broad understanding during the negotiations was that, at a </p>
<p>minimum, the position of previous Attorneys General required us to obtain a resolution </p>
<p>which contained a material breach finding and talked of ‘serious consequences’ if Iraq </p>
<p>remained in breach”.</p>
<p><b>921. </b> Mr Pattison explained: </p>
<p>“At the risk of stating the obvious, I think it worth pointing out that Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions are often the products of complex political negotiations. The result is </p>

<p><b>924. </b> Mr Macleod thought that there were two main objectives for the resolution:</p>
<p>“One was to achieve the disarmament of Iraq by essentially inspections and </p>
<p>peaceful means, if we could at all, and that’s why part of the focus of 1441 is on a </p>
<p>strong inspection regime, but I think it was very much a part of the framework, also, </p>
<p>that there should be one final opportunity for Iraq to disarm and that that should be </p>
<p>this resolution, and that there would not be a further Security Council decision at a </p>
<p>later stage.”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>925. </b> In his private hearing, Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that the US: </p>
<p>“… wanted freedom to be able to pin Iraq down in material breach, either through </p>
<p>something that was heinous in the declaration, or through a further act or omission, </p>
<p>and they wanted the capacity to report that to the Security Council without it being </p>
<p>reported through the inspectors.”</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>926. </b> Sir Jeremy stated: </p>
<p>“The French knew what they were agreeing to, and then later didn’t want to live </p>
<p>up to what they had agreed to, and to that extent changed their policy from the basis </p>
<p>of the understanding of the negotiation in 1441.”</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>927. </b> Sir Jeremy added:</p>
<p>“The French wanted to make sure that the United States could not take unilateral </p>
<p>action. This was underlying the French position from beginning to end.</p>
<p>“… the French knew that they had not achieved in 1441 the requirement that the </p>
<p>Security Council make a decision following 1441, that 1441 was the last point of </p>
<p>agreement that we had reached, and that left the decision open by a Member State, </p>
<p>devoid of a Security Council resolution, to follow up on the previous resolutions.”</p>

<p>on a second resolution.”</p>
<p>330</p>
<p><b>929. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that his view “was that there was an overwhelming </p>
<p>argument that 1441 required a second stage but not a second resolution”.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>930. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I believed that we were intent on negotiating a self&#8209;contained resolution … The </p>
<p>Americans would never agree to a resolution that was not self&#8209;contained. I would </p>
<p>say everybody else we were negotiating with took the same view. As Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock has pointed out, if we had been ready to accept a resolution which </p>
<p>simply required another resolution, we would have got that in a week.”</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>931. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw described the negotiation of resolution 1441 as “a great </p>
<p>team effort”. The UK and US teams had:</p>
<p>“… argued so intensely over every last detail because everyone knew what was </p>
<p>riding on it.”</p>
<p>333</p>
<p><b>932. </b> Mr Straw wrote that he had felt a “great sense of relief and achievement “about </p>
<p>the outcome of the resolution; it was “comprehensive”, it was “mandatory, based </p>
<p>on Chapter VII of the UN Charter” and, “crucially it recognised ‘the threat Iraq’s </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance … poses to international peace and security’”.</p>

<p>339</p>

<p>of the context and background” of the draft resolution and asked for his advice.</p>

<p><b>“prevented” him “from being more actively engaged” in advising on </b></p>

<p><b>941.  In his statement, Lord Goldsmith identified three broad areas of difficulty:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>his Office was not sent all the relevant documents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>he was not sufficiently involved in Ministerial discussions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the approach to seeking his advice was inconsistent.</p>
<p><b>942. </b> Lord Goldsmith initially told the Inquiry that during the drafting of resolution 1441: </p>
<p>“I don’t know whether every draft was being copied, but certainly some drafts were </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>368</p>
<p><b>945.  While the exceptional nature of the negotiations would have made it </b></p>
<p><b>impossible for Lord Goldsmith to follow each twist and turn of the negotiations, </b></p>
<p><b>he was not sent the records of some of the most critical discussions.</b></p>
<p><b>946. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that, as Ms Adams had told the Inquiry, his Office was not </p>
<p>sent copies of all the telegrams during the negotiation process. In particular, he had not </p>
<p>seen those reporting “some of the most critical discussions”.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>947. </b> Ms Adams told the Inquiry that the Attorney General’s Office (then known as the </p>
<p>Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers (LSLO)) received telegrams from UKMIS New York </p>
<p>and from the Foreign Office itself:</p>
<p>“… during the course of the negotiation … there were two distributions for telegrams </p>
<p>… and … a lot of the very critical points in the negotiation were issues that were </p>
<p>discussed between the Foreign Secretary and US Secretary Powell and obviously </p>
<p>the French Foreign Minister and so on. Those records of rather key moments were </p>
<p>not coming to us at the time.”</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>948. </b> The evidence confirms that Lord Goldsmith did not see records of key discussions </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and Mr Straw and their counterparts, or proposals on the draft </p>
<p>resolution which were being discussed within the UK Government, before decisions </p>
<p>were taken.</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Mr Macleod told the Inquiry that, during the negotiation of resolutions 1154 and </p>
<p>1205 in 1997 and 1998, he had been working in the Attorney General’s Office. In relation </p>
<p>to resolution 1154, he described a letter and briefing which took him and the Attorney </p>
<p>General through the background in New York, the UN processes, the significance </p>
<p>of the different terminology, the origins of the revival doctrine and the view of previous </p>
<p>Law Officers on it: </p>
<p>“The picture that emerges is very much of the Attorney’s office being told what was </p>
<p>happening, being offered ideas about what the future shape of the resolution might </p>
<p>be, being asked for advice on whether one formulation was the stronger basis than </p>
<p>another and giving views on that.”</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>950. </b> After the adoption of resolution 1154 and before and during the negotiation </p>
<p>of resolution 1205 Mr Macleod stated:</p>
<p>“… it [the process] worked exactly the same way; we knew what was coming, there </p>
<p>were drafts going round, different operative paragraphs. I think there were even </p>
<p>drafts of the explanations of vote, and they were gone through both before and after </p>
<p>the adoption of the text, and I think there was guidance from the Attorney.” </p>

<p><b>951. </b> Mr Macleod’s account of the involvement of the Attorney General in 1998 is </p>
<p>supported by contemporaneous records that the Inquiry has seen.</p>
<p><b>952. </b> Ms Adams contrasted the process during the drafting of resolution 1441 with that </p>
<p>which subsequently took place on the second resolution and other cases when: </p>
<p>“… the Attorney General was presented with a draft and it was clear, ‘This is our </p>
<p>objective for this resolution. Is this text sufficient to achieve this objective, and </p>
<p>if it isn’t, what do we need as a sort of legal red line?’ … the Attorney was able </p>
<p>to say ‘I think X or Y’ and therefore, that informed the process of the negotiation </p>
<p>in New York …”</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>953. </b> Sir Michael Wood told the Inquiry that the FCO Legal Advisers “kept the Attorney </p>
<p>General informed” about the “course of the negotiations” and about the advice they were </p>
<p>giving as the draft resolution developed: “both to ensure that he was in a position to give </p>
<p>advice to Ministers and to the negotiators at any time, either on request or as he saw fit, </p>
<p>whether or not his advice was formally sought”.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>954. </b> Sir Michael explained:</p>
<p>“What was in my view more important than a formal request for advice was for the </p>
<p>FCO Legal Advisers to keep the Attorney General’s Office as fully informed as they </p>
<p>could throughout the negotiations. This we did. We sent to his Office anything we </p>
<p>saw that was legally significant as soon as we received it, and we kept him informed </p>
<p>of the advice that we were giving. We wished to ensure that the legal advice we </p>
<p>were giving within the FCO and beyond on a matter of such importance did not differ </p>
<p>from his own views. </p>
<p>“The Attorney’s advice was … obtained during the negotiation of 1441, but not </p>
<p>at every stage (which would have been impractical, given the complexity of the </p>
<p>negotiations and the manner in which they were being carried out). His views on </p>
<p>the revival argument, and the kind of language that was needed in any resolution </p>
<p>if it was of itself to authorise the use of force, were well known.”</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>955. </b> Sir Michael Wood also told the Inquiry that there were “no formal or other rules” </p>
<p>on seeking the Attorney General’s advice during the negotiation of UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions, “either in general or in exceptional circumstances like 1441”; and that it “all </p>
<p>depends on the circumstances”. The FCO Legal Advisers had “made it clear throughout </p>
<p>to policy clients, including Ministers, that it was highly desirable to seek the Attorney’s </p>
<p>advice, and in particular that the Attorney’s advice would be needed before military force </p>
<p>was used”.</p>

<p><b>959.  Key decisions on the resolution had already been taken and the draft was </b></p>

<p>involved in the Ministerial meetings and discussions about the resolution and the policy </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw on 18 October that he should be present at “any meetings between the </p>

<p><b>968. </b> In addition, there had been “no further meetings” between Lord Goldsmith and </p>

<p>his eventual advice, and that therefore in our view early advice from the Attorney </p>
<p>was desirable. As I recall, the Attorney’s response was to the effect that he would </p>
<p>give his advice when it was requested by Ministers, but that in any event we knew </p>
<p>his views.”</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>975. </b> Asked what legal advice had been provided on the effect of the insertion of the </p>
<p>words “for assessment”, Sir Michael Wood wrote that the words were “proposed by the </p>
<p>US Secretary of State, in response to a French request, and agreed by him directly with </p>
<p>the British and French Foreign Ministers, without, so far as I am aware, legal advice </p>
<p>being sought”.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>976.  Despite the difficulties which Lord Goldsmith rightly identified as limiting </b></p>
<p><b>his contribution during the negotiation of resolution 1441, the way in which </b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s advice was provided raises a number of issues.</b></p>
<p><b>977.  After the meeting with Mr Blair on 22 October, Lord Goldsmith </b></p>
<p><b>understandably felt it necessary to ask Mr Brummell to record his views.</b></p>
<p><b>978.  Accordingly, on Lord Goldsmith’s instructions, Mr Brummell wrote to </b></p>
<p><b>Sir David Manning setting out the points that Lord Goldsmith had made in his </b></p>
<p><b>meeting with Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>979. </b> Asked about his meeting with Mr Blair on 22 October and Mr Brummell’s letter </p>
<p>of 23 October 2002 before the declassification of his manuscript notes of that meeting, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he hadn’t thought he needed to put his views </p>
<p>in writing at that stage: </p>
<p>“I think I had been very clear in my oral statements that there needed to be a </p>
<p>clear statement of material breach and so forth. So I don’t think I needed to add </p>
<p>anything else.”</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>980. </b> Asked if he had been anxious that Mr Blair should know his legal advice, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t think so … I couldn’t have given definitive legal advice at that stage, because </p>
<p>the whole point was he [Mr Blair] had had the advice in July about what needed to </p>
<p>happen … Until there was a resolution finally, there wasn’t really anything more to </p>
<p>say, although I was giving a bit of guidance about a couple of matters. One of them </p>

<p>though, as I have said it actually changed in significant ways at the last moment.” </p>
<p><b>981. </b> Lord Goldsmith subsequently wrote that in his oral evidence he had had in mind </p>
<p>the passage in Mr Brummell’s letter recording that he could not give a final view on the </p>
<p>effect of the resolution until it had been adopted.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>982. </b> Asked about Mr Brummell’s letter to Sir David Manning of 23 October, Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith wrote that he “felt there should be a record of the advice” he had offered; that </p>
<p>he had asked Mr Brummell to send the letter; and that, if he had not recorded his advice </p>
<p>through that means, he “would have ensured that the same result was achieved by other </p>
<p>means, i.e. through written advice in a note to No.10”.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>983.  Lord Goldsmith’s argument that he could not give a ‘final view’ on the legal </b></p>
<p><b>effect of resolution 1441 until after its adoption is evidently correct.</b></p>
<p><b>984.  Lord Goldsmith was also being advised that he should not “provide </b></p>
<p><b>a running commentary”.</b></p>
<p><b>985.  Nevertheless, and given its importance, Mr Blair and Mr Straw should have </b></p>
<p><b>ensured that Lord Goldsmith was invited to advise on the legal implications of the </b></p>
<p><b>text under discussion at key stages in the development of resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>986.  That would have ensured that policy decisions were fully informed by </b></p>
<p><b>consideration of the legal issues.</b></p>
<p><b>987.  Specifically Lord Goldsmith’s views should, at the very least, have been </b></p>
<p><b>sought and considered first in the context of the decision on 17 October that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK should seek to negotiate a resolution which would be capable of authorising </b></p>
<p><b>the use of force without a further decision by the Security Council, and secondly </b></p>
<p><b>once the near final draft of the resolution was available on 4 November and before </b></p>
<p><b>the resolution was adopted on 8 November. </b></p>
<p><b>988.  There should have been an agreed, collective understanding of the legal </b></p>
<p><b>effect of the resolution amongst key Ministers, the Cabinet Secretary, the Chief </b></p>
<p><b>of the Defence Staff and senior officials participating in the negotiations.</b></p>
<p><b>989.  As Ms Adams pointed out, the UK Government “didn’t really know what </b></p>
<p><b>it was voting for”. </b></p>
<p><b>990. </b> Ms Adams had told the Inquiry that the timing of the legal advice was: </p>
<p>“… a very important issue … and in fact for me this is the key lesson learned from </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>991. </b> Ms Adams stated: </p>
<p>“… it has struck me very forcibly with the benefit of hindsight that that would have </p>

<p>Government didn’t really know what it was voting for … the Foreign Secretary and </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy had a very clear view of what they thought the resolution meant. Michael </p>
<p>Wood had a very clear view which was a rather different view, but the one person </p>
<p>whose view actually mattered hadn’t even been asked at that stage.”</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>992. </b> Ms Adams told the Inquiry that Lord Goldsmith’s advice at an earlier stage: </p>
<p>“… would have influenced the statements that were made about the resolution after </p>
<p>its adoption … the Explanation of Vote which was made. Normally, when you have </p>
<p>a resolution negotiated, if you don’t achieve everything that you want to achieve </p>
<p>in the negotiation and you end up with a less than clear text, it is a classic way to </p>
<p>reinforce one’s interpretation by stating clearly that you think it means a certain </p>
<p>thing … our statement was arguably not inconsistent with the view that the Attorney </p>
<p>had reached, but it could have been clearer and I think some of the things that were </p>
<p>said … about what automaticity did or didn’t mean and these kind of issues, but if </p>
<p>there had been a very definitive legal view, then perhaps that would have fed into a </p>
<p>clearer Explanation of Vote.”</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>993. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that there was a view within his Office that he “should not </p>
<p>provide a running commentary on the drafts as they emerged”.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> He only saw what were </p>
<p>“effectively snapshots provided … for information”. His role should be to “provide advice </p>
<p>on the legal effect of the final, agreed wording”. That seemed to him “a valid position” </p>
<p>which he “understood to be consistent with the role adopted by his predecessors”. </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith wrote that that was what he “had in mind” when he told Mr Blair in their </p>
<p>meeting on 22 October that “it would not be possible to give a final view on the legal </p>
<p>effect of the resolution until it had been adopted”. </p>
<p><b>994. </b> Asked to address the effect greater involvement during the negotiation of the </p>

<p>366</p>
<p><b>995. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that it would not be “impossible for an Attorney General </p>

<p>368</p>
<p><b>997. </b> Sir Michael Wood identified the “main consequence” of the fact that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>did not give advice at the later stages of the negotiation was that “there was inevitably </p>

<p>difficult for FCO Legal Advisers to advise Ministers”. But it was “far from clear that having </p>

<p><b>not consistent. </b></p>
<p><b>1003. </b> In a statement to the Inquiry, Sir Michael Wood wrote that he, Ms Wilmshurst and </p>
<p>Mr Grainger worked closely together as a team on all matters concerning the use of </p>
<p>force against Iraq.</p>
<p>370</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1004. </b> Legal advice was “folded in to the day&#8209;by&#8209;day instructions to UKMIS New York”. </p>
<p>Mr Grainger attended the daily meetings on Iraq, discussed drafts with the United </p>
<p>Nations Department (UND), cleared draft instructions to New York and gave day&#8209;to&#8209;day </p>
<p>advice orally and in writing. Virtually all significant pieces of written legal advice were </p>
<p>a co&#8209;operative effort.</p>
<p>371 </p>
<p><b>1005. </b> Sir Michael had been aware of, and agreed with, all the advice Mr Grainger </p>
<p>had given.</p>
<p><b>1006. </b> Sir Michael stated that he had ensured that he was “consulted … on all significant </p>

<p>“was asked directly by Ministers or senior officials”.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> He would “intervene directly only </p>

<p>on major negotiations, such as resolution 1441 “pretty rare”. He reported “ultimately </p>
<p>to the Permanent Representative [Sir Jeremy Greenstock]”. There was:</p>
<p>“… no line of reporting, direct or indirect to the FCO Legal Adviser in London … </p>
<p>Nor was there any routine process of … reporting on legal issues or anything of </p>
<p>that sort.”</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> Sir Michael Wood wrote that “the work of a legal adviser overseas is quite </p>
<p>different from that of a lawyer in London, having large policy and representational </p>
<p>elements”.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> The Legal Counsellor and First Secretary (Legal) in UKMIS New York </p>
<p>reported to the UK Permanent Representative to the UN and, while it was “important” </p>
<p>that the links to the FCO Legal Advisers were maintained, it would not have been </p>
<p>“appropriate” for them to “report directly to, and effectively work under the FCO </p>
<p>Legal Adviser”. </p>
<p><b>1012. </b> Sir Michael added:</p>
<p>“… the negotiation of SCR 1441 was wholly exceptional, with Washington firmly in </p>
<p>the lead and key negotiations taking place directly between foreign ministers and </p>
<p>often on the telephone. The negotiating process was quite different from that for </p>
<p>other SCRs, such as SCRs 1154, 1205, the second resolution in early 2003, and </p>
<p>subsequent resolutions on Iraq adopted in 2003/4.” </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> As a result, in Sir Michael’s view: “It was, therefore, not always easy for anyone, </p>
<p>including the lawyers, to follow the negotiations blow&#8209;by&#8209;blow and to feed in considered </p>
<p>and timely advice in the usual way.”</p>
<p>376</p>

<p><b>1014. </b> In Mr Macleod’s view, the UK Mission in New York had had “a relatively limited </p>

<p>“The main components of the draft came to us from Washington via London.”</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>1015. </b> Mr Macleod wrote that he had received “no instructions” from London in relation </p>
<p>to the negotiation of resolution 1441 “beyond or in addition to those received by </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock and UKMIS”.</p>
<p>378 </p>
<p><b>1016. </b> Mr Macleod told the Inquiry that, “as a member of Sir Jeremy’s team”, he </p>
<p>was “closely involved in the negotiation of what became UNSCR 1441 from an early </p>

<p>379</p>
<p> He “knew what we were trying to achieve and attended the majority of the </p>

<p><b>1018. </b> Asked about the process of providing advice to Sir Jeremy, Mr Macleod told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that it was “fairly informal”: </p>
<p>“… Jeremy knew the issue very, very well. He understood that the legal parameters </p>
<p>in which 1441 was being negotiated were very well&#8209;established, at least as far as we </p>
<p>were concerned, because he had been responsible for negotiating resolution 1205 </p>
<p>and he had probably been involved in the earlier ones too. So the framework we </p>

<p>380 </p>
<p><b>1019. </b> Within the FCO, Mr Pattison was responsible for the formulation of policy on </p>

<p><b>1032. </b> Subsequently, in the context of questioning about the later debate on the </p>
<p>interpretation of resolution 1441 and the need for a second resolution, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock stated:</p>
<p>“If I had known that there was that degree of doubt in London, I would have had to </p>
<p>examine whether the advice I was getting from my own legal adviser was the advice </p>
<p>I should be listening to.”</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> The Inquiry drew those extracts from Sir Jeremy’s evidence, which addressed the </p>
<p>understanding in New York of the legal effect of resolution 1441 after its adoption and </p>
<p>which had not at that stage been published, to the attention of Mr Macleod before he </p>
<p>gave evidence to the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Addressing his advice to Sir Jeremy in his statement, Mr Macleod wrote:</p>
<p>“Sir Jeremy Greenstock knew the legal framework as well as I did … I think we </p>
<p>had a shared understanding of what London’s instructions required and a shared </p>
<p>assessment of what the final text meant. I did not have to offer lengthy written </p>
<p>advice: my views were simply fed into the negotiating process, along with those of </p>
<p>the rest of the team. At no time during the negotiation of UNSCR … was there any </p>
<p>opposition or questioning of the views I expressed, and nor was I put under any </p>
<p>pressure to advise in any particular direction (by Sir Jeremy or anyone else).”</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1035. </b> Mr Macleod told the Inquiry that he was “not really clear about what exactly </p>
<p>happened in London during the negotiation of resolution 1441”.</p>
<p>389 </p>
<p>He understood from </p>
<p>papers that he had seen “that questions were being asked of the Attorney on a couple </p>
<p>of occasions” but he did not “think that was evident to us at the time in New York”. </p>
<p><b>1036. </b> Mr Macleod added that “there seemed to be no definitive view from the Attorney’s </p>
<p>Office during the 1441 process”; which he thought had been “a big mistake” and which </p>
<p>he contrasted with the process adopted during the negotiations in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>1037. </b> Mr Macleod told the Inquiry that UKMIS “had one view of the resolution, we </p>
<p>thought it would authorise the use of force”. He thought difficulties “could have been </p>
<p>avoided” if Lord Goldsmith’s view “had been obtained at that earlier stage”.</p>
<p>391 </p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Referring to the “doubts in London that began to emerge and really became </p>
<p>apparent to us in November”, Mr Macleod stated that it was:</p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>381</p>
<p>the resolution was that there wouldn’t have to be a further decision of the Security </p>
<p>Council to authorise the use of force. </p>
<p>“… the other reason why it is odd is that we had been negotiating in New York side </p>
<p>by side with the US …</p>
<p>“… to have reached the end of that and then have to turn round and tell the </p>
<p>Americans that ‘Actually, what you and we thought we were negotiating, we haven’t </p>
<p>achieved at all’, it is a very strange place to end up.”</p>
<p>392 </p>
<p><b>1039. </b> Asked if he was completely unaware that the FCO Legal Adviser was repeatedly </p>
<p>and very clearly advising Mr Straw during and after the negotiation of 1441 that it did not </p>
<p>authorise the use of force without a further resolution, Mr Macleod replied:</p>
<p>“There are minutes – on the file which I have seen subsequently, which in hindsight </p>
<p>you could see … the London legal view was diverging from the policy as we thought </p>
<p>of it. But I wasn’t really aware, to be honest, that there was such a divergence </p>
<p>of view.”</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Mr Macleod added that it was not until “towards the end of November” when he </p>
<p>saw the draft of the instructions asking Lord Goldsmith to advise that he “really realised </p>
<p>that something was not quite right here. I hadn’t really spotted it before then, and </p>
<p>perhaps I should have, but I hadn’t really.” </p>
<p><b>1041. </b> Addressing what he described as “the legal advice beginning to diverge from </p>
<p>where the policy was”, Mr Macleod stated “Jeremy [Greenstock] and I both thought that </p>
<p>it [resolution 1441] did achieve that [the policy aim]”; and: </p>
<p>“That remains my view and, in the end that was the view the Attorney also took. But </p>
<p>London, it is clear certainly now, that wasn’t the view in [the FCO] Legal Advisers. </p>
<p>The way to fix that was actually relatively straightforward, which is to get a view from </p>
<p>the Attorney. I think it should have happened. Now, why it didn’t is very difficult for </p>
<p>me to say from where I was, but I think it is a big gap in the process.”</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>1042. </b> Asked specifically if he was aware that Lord Goldsmith had advised Mr Straw on </p>
<p>18 October that the draft resolution would not in itself authorise force, Mr Macleod said </p>
<p>he was not aware of that advice.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1043. </b> Pressed on the implications, Mr Macleod stated that he should have been aware </p>
<p>of the advice, and that: </p>
<p>“… it would have had an impact. There would have had to be some quite serious </p>
<p>analysis with London, but also with Washington, of where we were going.</p>

<p>He identified the close personal </p>

<p>potential consequences that would follow from the resolution as the reasons for the </p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>1080.  The declared objective of the US and UK was to obtain international </b></p>
<p><b>support within the framework of the UN for a strategy of coercive diplomacy </b></p>
<p><b>for the disarmament of Iraq. For the UK, regime change was a means to achieve </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament, not an objective in its own right. </b></p>
<p><b>1081.  A new UN resolution was a key element of Mr Blair’s “clever strategy” </b></p>
<p><b>to achieve the policy objectives of the US and UK in a manner which fostered </b></p>
<p><b>international unanimity and maintained the authority of the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>1082.  The UK’s stated objective for the negotiation of resolution 1441 was to give </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein “one final chance to comply” with his obligations to disarm. The </b></p>
<p><b>UK initially formulated the objective in terms of: </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>a resolution setting out an ultimatum to Iraq to readmit the UN weapons </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors and to disarm in accordance with its obligations; and</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>a threat to resort to the use of force to secure disarmament if Iraq failed </b></p>
<p><b>to comply.</b></p>
<p><b>1083.  Iraq’s agreement in principle on 16 September to the return of inspectors, </b></p>
<p><b>was almost certainly a response to President Bush’s speech on 12 September, but </b></p>
<p><b>the US and UK immediately expressed scepticism about the terms on which Iraq </b></p>

<p><b>of the UK dossier, the Assessments Staff concluded that there was no need for </b></p>
<p><b>a full reply to Iraq’s claims.</b></p>
<p><b>1086.  The negotiation of resolution 1441 reflected a broad consensus in the </b></p>
<p><b>United Nations Security Council on the need to achieve the disarmament of Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>1087.  There were, however, significant differences between the US and UK </b></p>
<p><b>positions: and between them and China, France and Russia about the substance </b></p>
<p><b>of the strategy to be adopted, including the role of the Security Council in </b></p>
<p><b>determining whether peaceful means had been exhausted and the use of force </b></p>
<p><b>to secure disarmament was justified. </b></p>
<p><b>1088.  Those differences resulted in difficult negotiations over more than </b></p>
<p><b>eight weeks before the eventual unanimous adoption of resolution 1441 on </b></p>
<p><b>8 November 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>1089.  In September and October 2002 negotiations were being conducted </b></p>
<p><b>simultaneously at three separate levels: discussions between Heads of State and </b></p>
<p><b>Government and their advisers; between foreign ministers; and in New York.</b></p>
<p><b>1090.  The degree to which Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Sir David Manning, and their </b></p>
<p><b>counterparts in other capitals, were directly engaged in the detailed negotiations </b></p>
<p><b>with counterparts in other capitals was highly unusual and demonstrated the </b></p>
<p><b>difficulty and political sensitivity of the issues under discussion. </b></p>
<p><b>1091.  Mr Blair played an active role in determining the UK’s negotiating strategy </b></p>
<p><b>and seeking to influence President Bush, President Chirac and President Putin.</b></p>
<p><b>1092.  Within the UK’s overarching objective, the initial discussion of the </b></p>
<p><b>resolution focused on the crucial need to revive UN authority to permit UK use </b></p>
<p><b>of military force if coercive diplomacy failed. </b></p>
<p><b>1093.  Mr Blair was advised that it would be impossible to get agreement in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council to a single resolution unequivocally providing that authority. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>From the end of September, Mr Blair was advised that a second decision by the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council would be needed to authorise military action. </b></p>
<p><b>1094.  Mr Straw and Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that tough messages were </b></p>
<p><b>required to persuade President Bush to accept the UK position and to address the </b></p>
<p><b>difficulties for the UK that the US stance might create. He was encouraged to try </b></p>
<p><b>to get the US to agree to two resolutions.</b></p>
<p><b>1095.  Between 2 and 17 October, Mr Blair made a series of decisions which </b></p>
<p><b>aligned the UK with the declared US position that no further decision by the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council could be explicitly conceded in the negotiation. </b></p>
<p><b>1096.  To maintain pressure on Iraq, Mr Blair and Mr Straw decided on 17 October </b></p>
<p><b>not to address the question of a second resolution at that time. </b></p>
<p><b>1097.  The effect of the policy was that if a material breach of the resolution was </b></p>
<p><b>reported to the Security Council, Saddam Hussein would not get a second chance.</b></p>
<p><b>1098.  But Mr Blair, Mr Straw and other senior UK participants in the negotiation </b></p>
<p><b>of resolution 1441 envisaged that, in the event of a material breach of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>obligations, a second resolution determining that a breach existed and </b></p>
<p><b>authorising the use of force was likely to be tabled in the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>1099.  The pursuit of a possible “side agreement” to that end, Mr Straw’s </b></p>
<p><b>conversations with Secretary Powell and Mr de Villepin, and Sir Jeremy </b></p>
<p><b>Greenstock’s suggestion that the UK might table such a resolution all confirm that </b></p>
<p><b>conclusion.</b></p>
<p><b>1100.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw were, however, concerned that it might be difficult to </b></p>
<p><b>secure agreement to a second resolution within the Council and that one or more </b></p>
<p><b>of the Permanent Members might veto the resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>1101.  In those circumstances, Mr Blair’s and Mr Straw’s position was that if the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council failed to meet its responsibilities, military force should be used </b></p>
<p><b>to disarm Iraq. Mr Blair had already assured President Bush on several occasions </b></p>
<p><b>that the UK would take such action. </b></p>
<p><b>1102.  Mr Blair framed that in terms of the “Kosovo option” and what would </b></p>
<p><b>happen in the event of an “unreasonable” veto.</b></p>
<p><b>1103.  Mr Straw told Lord Goldsmith that he accepted a second resolution would </b></p>
<p><b>be needed “unless circumstances changed”, but he argued that could not be </b></p>
<p><b>acknowledged publicly for tactical reasons.</b></p>
<p><b>1104.  Lord Goldsmith informed Mr Blair on 22 October that, although he would </b></p>
<p><b>not be able to give a final view until the resolution was adopted, the draft of the </b></p>
<p><b>resolution of 19 October would not on its own authorise military action.</b></p>

<p>the negotiation of resolution 1441</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>1105.  The way in which the legal advice was sought and considered during </b></p>
<p><b>the negotiation of resolution 1441, and the substance of that advice, including </b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s views on the legal effects of the drafts he saw and whether </b></p>
<p><b>there was any reason for the Government to assume that the resolution adopted </b></p>
<p><b>on 8 November could by itself provide the authority for the use of force, are </b></p>
<p><b>addressed earlier in this Section. </b></p>
<p><b>1106.  Decisions made by Mr Blair at key stages in the negotiations limited the </b></p>
<p><b>policy options subsequently available to the UK. </b></p>
<p><b>1107.  In seeking to influence President Bush’s decisions, Mr Blair offered the </b></p>
<p><b>UK’s support while suggesting possible adjustments to the US position. </b></p>
<p><b>1108.  In his discussions with President Bush, Mr Blair did not seek to use the </b></p>
<p><b>potential UK military contribution to influence the US during the negotiation </b></p>
<p><b>of resolution 1441. </b></p>
<p><b>1109.  The way in which the decision on 31 October to offer significant forces </b></p>
<p><b>for ground operations to the US for planning purposes was taken is addressed </b></p>
<p><b>in Section 6.1.</b></p>
<p><b>1110.  The UK was successful in changing some aspects of the US position </b></p>
<p><b>during the negotiations, in particular ensuring resolution 1441 was based on the </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament of Iraq rather than wider issues as originally proposed by the US. </b></p>
<p><b>1111.  Initial US/UK drafts of the resolution which would not be acceptable to other </b></p>
<p><b>members of the Security Council were tabled without identifying the impact that </b></p>
<p><b>would have on the timetable for reaching consensus, the consequent delay in the </b></p>
<p><b>return of the inspectors, and the extent to which that would require key questions </b></p>
<p><b>to remain unresolved.</b></p>
<p><b>1112.  The length of time taken to agree resolution 1441 meant the first update </b></p>
<p><b>from the inspectors for the Security Council would not be required until </b></p>
<p><b>mid&#8209;February, and the resolution was silent on what would happen after that.</b></p>
<p><b>1113.  The potential tension between the time available for inspections and when </b></p>
<p><b>US would be ready to take military action was recognised in papers produced by </b></p>
<p><b>officials from July onwards. </b></p>
<p><b>1114.  Reporting from Washington in mid&#8209;October identified clear indications </b></p>
<p><b>that the US Administration was likely to be impatient about the time allowed </b></p>
<p><b>for inspections. </b></p>
<p><b>1115.  Notwithstanding Mr Blair’s and Mr Straw’s statements at the time </b></p>
<p><b>and his evidence to the Inquiry, resolution 1441 did not meet all the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>original objectives. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>1116.  To secure consensus in the Security Council despite the different positions </b></p>
<p><b>of the US and France and Russia (described by Sir Jeremy Greenstock as </b></p>
<p><b>“irreconcilable”), resolution 1441 was a compromise containing drafting ‘fixes’. </b></p>
<p><b>1117.  That created deliberate ambiguities on a number of key issues including: </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the level of non&#8209;compliance with resolution 1441 which would constitute </b></p>
<p><b>a material breach;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>by whom that determination would be made; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>whether there would be a second resolution explicitly authorising the use </b></p>
<p><b>of force. </b></p>
<p><b>1118.  As the Explanations of Vote demonstrated, there were significant </b></p>
<p><b>differences between the positions of the members of the Security Council about </b></p>
<p><b>the circumstances and timing of recourse to military action. There were also </b></p>
<p><b>differences about whether Member States should be entitled to report Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>non&#8209;compliance to the Council. </b></p>
