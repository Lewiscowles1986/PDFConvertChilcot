<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Sections 6.4 and 6.5 consider the UK’s planning and preparation for a post-Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein Iraq between late 2001 and March 2003. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> Section 6.4 covers the period up to Mr Blair’s decision on 17 January 2003 to deploy </p>
<p>UK forces to support US military preparations.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> Section 6.5 covers the 10 weeks between the decision to deploy UK forces and the </p>
<p>first post-invasion meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at Camp David on </p>
<p>26 and 27 March 2003. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> The two parts address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of UK post-conflict strategy and objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparation to implement those objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK civilian and military planning machinery;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK influence on US planning and preparation and the impact of US planning on </p>
<p>the UK; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Parliamentary interest in post-conflict planning and preparation. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> The two parts do not consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>military plans for the invasion, which are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or preparations for the </p>
<p>post-invasion search for WMD, addressed in Section 4;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the financial and human resources available for post-conflict administration and </p>
<p>reconstruction, addressed in Sections 13 and 15; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the outcome in post-conflict Iraq, which is addressed in Sections 9 and 10.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Descriptions of US preparations for post-conflict Iraq in Sections 6.4 and 6.5 are </p>
<p>mostly taken from <i>Hard Lessons</i>, Mr Stuart Bowen’s account, as US Inspector General </p>
<p>for Iraq Reconstruction, of the US experience of reconstruction between 2002 and 2008.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> Key findings for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 are listed below.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions relating to Sections 6.4 and 6.5 are at the end of Section 6.5. </p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before the invasion of Iraq, Ministers, senior officials and the UK military recognised </p>
<p>that post-conflict civilian and military operations were likely to be the strategically </p>
<p>decisive phase of the Coalition’s engagement in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK planning and preparation for the post-conflict phase of operations, which rested </p>
<p>on the assumption that the UK would be able quickly to reduce its military presence </p>
<p>in Iraq and deploy only a minimal number of civilians, were wholly inadequate.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The information available to the Government before the invasion provided a clear </p>
<p>indication of the potential scale of the post-conflict task and the significant risks </p>
<p>associated with the UK’s proposed approach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Foreseeable risks included post-conflict political disintegration and extremist violence </p>
<p>in Iraq, the inadequacy of US plans, the UK’s inability to exert significant influence </p>
<p>on US planning and, in the absence of UN authorisation for the administration and </p>
<p>reconstruction of post-conflict Iraq, the reluctance of potential international partners </p>
<p>to contribute to the post-conflict effort. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government, which lacked both clear Ministerial oversight of post-conflict </p>
<p>strategy, planning and preparation, and effective co-ordination between government </p>
<p>departments, failed to analyse or manage those risks adequately.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair, who recognised the significance of the post-conflict phase, did not press </p>
<p>President Bush for definite assurances about US plans, did not consider or seek </p>
<p>advice on whether the absence of a satisfactory plan called for reassessment of </p>
<p>the terms of the UK’s engagement and did not make agreement on such a plan </p>
<p>a condition of UK participation in military action.</p>
<p><b>Pre-conflict management of information on Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>9.  During 2002 and early 2003, a growing body of evidence on the state of Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>under Saddam Hussein and on the potential impact of conflict was available to </b></p>
<p><b>UK planners. </b></p>
<p><b>10.  The evidence was fragmented and incomplete. Many of the sources were </b></p>
<p><b>not reliable.</b></p>
<p><b>11.  A number of departments shared responsibility for the gathering, analysis and </b></p>
<p><b>dissemination of that information.</b></p>
<p><b>12. </b> The principal sources of information potentially available to UK planners before </p>
<p>March 2003 on social, political and economic conditions in Iraq included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UN, including the UN-managed Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reports on visits to Iraq by diplomats at the British Embassy in Amman, Jordan;</p>

<p>Development (DFID) focused on northern Iraq;</p>

<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Assessments produced by the UK’s Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US State Department’s Future of Iraq Project;</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>other sources, including non-governmental organisations (NGOs), academics, </p>
<p>journalists, Arabic media, Iraqi émigrés and allied countries with Embassies </p>
<p>in Baghdad.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The information available to the Government before the invasion on Iraq’s weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction (WMD) is addressed in Section 4. Information on Iraq’s other military </p>
<p>capabilities is in Sections 6.1 to 6.3.</p>
<p><b>The Foreign and Commonwealth Office</b></p>
<p><b>14. </b> In December 2003, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) presented a </p>
<p><i>Strategy for the FCO</i> to Parliament, in which it listed the department’s “key contributions” </p>
<p>to government.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“co-ordination and leadership of the UK’s international policies”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“expert foreign policy advice for Ministers and the Prime Minister, feeding into </p>
<p>the wider policy process”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“rapid gathering, analysis and targeting of information for the Government </p>
<p>and others”. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Within the FCO between 2001and 2003, prime responsibility for information on other </p>
<p>countries fell to the relevant regional department. For Iraq, that was the Middle East </p>
<p>Department (MED), under the supervision of the Director Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> The FCO Directorate of Strategy and Innovation (DSI) reported to the Permanent </p>
<p>Under Secretary (PUS)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> and the FCO Board. Its role was to review policy in areas of </p>
<p>high priority and to supplement or challenge advice from the relevant department within </p>
<p>the FCO. DSI was a significant contributor of strategy papers on Iraq in the second half </p>
<p>of 2002.</p>

<p>In keeping with variations in use within departments, the Inquiry refers to the most senior civil servant </p>
<p>in the FCO and the MOD as the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), but in all other departments as the </p>
<p>Permanent Secretary. The Permanent Under Secretaries and Permanent Secretaries are referred to </p>
<p>collectively as Permanent Secretaries.</p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The FCO Research Analysts (RA) provided expert support and background for the </p>
<p>policy recommendations made by MED and the Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), which was </p>
<p>established in February 2003.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> The FCO told the Inquiry that one analyst worked full-</p>
<p>time on Iraq during 2001, increasing to two from mid-2002.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> RA also acted as the contact </p>
<p>point within government for the US State Department’s Future of Iraq Project.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>18. </b> After the closure of the British Embassy Baghdad on 12 January 1992, the UK had </p>
<p>no diplomatic relations with Iraq. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> In other cases where diplomatic relations have been interrupted, the UK has often </p>
<p>maintained a British Interests Section within a friendly Embassy. The FCO told the </p>
<p>Inquiry it did not consider opening an Interests Section in Iraq staffed with permanent </p>
<p>UK diplomatic staff.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> Instead, Russia acted as the UK’s Protecting Power in Baghdad </p>
<p>from November 1992 until the invasion, but did not provide the UK with political reporting </p>
<p>from Iraq.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The FCO told the Inquiry that, from the late 1990s, junior UK diplomats based in </p>
<p>Amman visited Baghdad about every six months to check on UK property, in particular </p>
<p>the Embassy building, deal with locally-employed staff, call on resident diplomats from </p>
<p>other countries and glean what information they could on the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> On </p>
<p>return to Amman, the UK diplomats produced reports containing political and economic </p>
<p>information, some of which are described later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Initially, the reports from Amman had an administrative focus. The FCO explicitly </p>
<p>advised visiting diplomats from Amman not to travel to Basra, as such visits would not </p>
<p>be consistent with that purpose and might suggest the UK was increasing contact with </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Visiting diplomats were instructed to “avoid all political contacts”. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> In July 1998, FCO Economic Advisers asked the British Embassy Amman for help in </p>
<p>monitoring Iraq’s economy, explaining that basic economic indicators were unavailable </p>
<p>and that those with an interest in the issue had to rely on “snippets of information, on </p>
<p>anecdote, and on speculation”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The Embassy was asked to make a “modest effort” to </p>
<p>gather economic information during routine administrative visits to Iraq, focusing on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>living standards;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>employment/unemployment and the structure of economic activity;</p>

<p><b>23. </b> From early 2002, UK diplomats based in Amman began to visit Iraq more often. </p>
<p>They produced reports on political and social developments, drawing on information </p>
<p>gleaned from business and other travellers and monthly UN briefings in Baghdad.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>24. </b> The FCO has not been able to provide the Inquiry with the complete series of </p>
<p>reports between July 1998 and March 2003.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Dr Robert Wilson and Mr Mark Hetherington, the two research analysts working </p>
<p>on Iraq before the invasion, explained to the Inquiry that the FCO drew on a range of </p>
<p>sources for information about the social, economic and political situation in Iraq: </p>
<p>“These included Iraqi politicians and exiles from both Iraqi Kurdistan and the rest </p>
<p>of the country, contact with whom was one of the core tasks of Research Analysts </p>
<p>during this period. Amongst those were individuals who visited either Saddam-</p>
<p>controlled Iraq or Northern Iraq (where Saddam had withdrawn his administration </p>
<p>and which was under de facto control of the two main Kurdish parties) and those </p>
<p>who had links to family or contacts within the country. Though the majority of those </p>
<p>with whom we were in contact were opposed to Saddam Hussein’s regime, their </p>
<p>analysis was far from homogenous – religious organisations and NGOs in particular </p>
<p>offering more nuanced analysis. Of course we were aware that many of these </p>
<p>individuals had their own particular agenda – especially when it came to the question </p>
<p>of what level of political support their parties or ideologies had within Iraq, and this </p>
<p>was hard to assess independently. In addition there were many Iraqis who shied </p>
<p>away from contact with the British Government …”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>26. </b> Dr Wilson told the Inquiry that RA had “no shortage of information on Iraq of varying </p>
<p>degrees of reliability”.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> In addition to Iraqi exiles, the FCO’s network of Embassies in </p>
<p>the region (particularly in Jordan and Turkey) kept in touch with local Iraqi officials and </p>
<p>opinion formers. Though most contacts were opposed to Saddam Hussein’s regime, </p>
<p>their analysis was far from homogeneous.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> Researchers were aware their contacts had </p>
<p>their own agendas and it was hard to assess independently what support specific parties </p>
<p>or ideologies had in Iraq. </p>

<p><b>27. </b> Dr Wilson told the Inquiry that academics, the UN and its agencies, NGOs and the </p>
<p>Arabic media were also sources of information.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Lord Jay, the FCO PUS from 2002 to 2006, told the Inquiry that the FCO had only </p>
<p>a “partial” picture of what was going on in Iraq.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> He highlighted the critical role of an </p>
<p>Embassy in understanding a country: </p>
<p>“… we did not have first-hand knowledge of what was going on inside Iraq, of how </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and his government operated. </p>
<p>“We had it second- or third-hand from other powers to whom we spoke … [W]hat </p>
<p>we did not have was the … constant day-to-day contact between well-qualified, </p>
<p>Arabic-speaking diplomats in Baghdad able to report back constantly on the ebb </p>
<p>and flow of power and influence and what that meant for us.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“… [Y]ou really do need people on the ground feeding stuff back. If you don’t have </p>
<p>that, you are going to make mistakes.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Lord Jay agreed that, in the absence of first-hand information, No.10 looked to the </p>
<p>UK’s intelligence services to provide advice on a broader range of issues than normal.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Lord Jay added:</p>
<p>“I don’t think we had thought through as much as we should have done what the </p>
<p>implications were going to be of an invasion of a country such as Iraq … I wished </p>
<p>we had had a better understanding of what Iraq was like in the 1990s, early 2000s </p>
<p>before a decision was taken to invade.”</p>

<p>characterised UK knowledge of what happened inside Iraq as “patchy”.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> He told the </p>
<p>Inquiry he could, nevertheless, draw on a number of useful sources of information: the </p>
<p>British Embassy Amman, which held a “watching brief”; contacts with exiled Iraqi groups </p>
<p>in London and Washington; contacts with close allies, like the French, who had long </p>
<p>experience of, and still had representation in, Iraq; contacts in a number of academic </p>
<p>institutions; and contacts with journalists. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Chaplin commented: </p>
<p>“... I don’t think we lacked for sources of information, but I think one of the problems </p>
<p>is that actually nobody outside Iraq, including Iraqi exiles, quite realised how broken </p>
<p>Iraqi society had become … nobody really had that information.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Chaplin rejected the suggestion that he had made no attempt to fill gaps in </p>
<p>the UK’s knowledge base on Iraq, highlighting the multiple sources of information that </p>
<p>were available.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> Mr Simon Webb, Ministry of Defence (MOD) Policy Director from 2001 to 2004, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry he felt he had a very good feel for Iraq’s military capability, but not </p>
<p>for what was happening within Saddam Hussein’s administration, the state of Iraq’s </p>
<p>infrastructure, or the mood of the population in the South: </p>
<p>“If we had thought that we were going to play a big role in reconstruction, and </p>
<p>we’d been asked to gather that information, I suspect we could have had a </p>
<p>better picture.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Webb agreed that the Government could have made more use of “open source” </p>
<p>reporting and analysis, including from academia, think-tanks and NGOs.</p>
<p><b>The Iraq Planning Unit</b></p>
<p><b>36. </b> In early February 2003, the Government established the Iraq Planning Unit (IPU) </p>
<p>to focus on post-conflict Iraq. The IPU was an inter-departmental (FCO/MOD/DFID) </p>
<p>unit, based in the FCO and headed by a former member of MED. In the FCO, the IPU </p>
<p>reported to the Director Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p><b>37. </b> The origin and purpose of the IPU are addressed in more detail in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Dominick Chilcott, Head of the IPU from February to June 2003, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>there was “a lot of expertise” he could draw on, in particular from FCO RA, Iraqi exiles </p>
<p>and FCO posts in the region.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Joint Intelligence Committee</b></p>
<p><b>39. </b> The JIC was (and continues to be) responsible for:</p>
<p>“... providing Ministers and senior officials with co-ordinated intelligence </p>
<p>assessments on a range of issues of immediate and long-range importance to </p>
<p>national interests, primarily in the fields of security, defence and foreign affairs.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The JIC is supported by Assessments Staff analysts seconded to the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>from other departments. The Assessments Staff’s draft assessments were (and still </p>
<p>are) subject to formal inter-departmental scrutiny and challenge in Current Intelligence </p>
<p>Groups (CIGs), which bring together working-level experts from a range of government </p>
<p>departments and the intelligence agencies. In the case of Iraq between 2001and 2003, </p>
<p>the CIG brought together the desk-level experts from the FCO (including MED and RA), </p>

<p>MOD (including the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS)), Cabinet Office and the intelligence </p>
<p>agencies, and any other department with an interest in the issue being considered.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The JIC agrees most assessments before they are sent to Ministers and senior </p>
<p>officials, although some papers, including urgent updates on developing issues, are </p>
<p>issued under the authority of the Chief of the Assessments Staff. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> The current JIC Terms of Reference make clear that it is expected to draw on </p>
<p>“secret intelligence, diplomatic reporting and open source material”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Iraq was regularly considered by the JIC in 2000 and 2001, with the focus on </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction (WMD), sanctions and the implications of the No-Fly </p>
<p>Zones (NFZs).</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Sir John Scarlett, JIC Chairman from 2001 to 2004, considered that Iraq had been </p>
<p>one of the top priorities for the JIC for most of his time as Chairman.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Sir John told the Inquiry that, with the limited resources available to the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff, the breakdown, decay and decrepitude of Iraq’s civilian infrastructure </p>
<p>was “not a natural intelligence target”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> He added: </p>
<p>“That kind of information and that kind of understanding of the fragility of the </p>
<p>structures of the State … could have been … presented or understood from a whole </p>
<p>range of sources, not necessarily from intelligence.” </p>
<p><b>46. </b> Sir John later told the Inquiry that the JIC had not been asked to look at Iraqi civilian </p>
<p>infrastructure and institutions, other than Saddam Hussein’s power structures: </p>
<p>“If we had been, I think almost certainly my response would be: that’s not for us. </p>
<p>Why should that be an intelligence issue? I wouldn’t quite be able to understand </p>
<p>how intelligence would help. I would see it as fundamentally something which in the </p>
<p>first instance advice would need to come from the Foreign Office … Of course, if we </p>
<p>had been asked, we would have said can you identify or can we between us work </p>
<p>out what would be particularly susceptible to an intelligence view or consideration? </p>
<p>And I think it would have been quite narrow. I don’t quite see how secret intelligence </p>
<p>would have particularly helped.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>47. </b> Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff from 2001 to 2003, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that intelligence available to the JIC gave some peripheral indications on issues such as </p>
<p>Iraq’s civilian infrastructure and the state of its institutions, but was not focused on those </p>
<p>areas.</p>

<p>have been possible for the JIC to ask the agencies to make an effort in that direction. </p>
<p>He had no recollection of any such request. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Miller added that departments had shown interest in the internal politics of Iraq </p>
<p>and the relationship between the Shia and the Kurds, but only very limited intelligence </p>
<p>had been available on those subjects.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> The majority of JIC assessments relevant to Iraq between 2002 and the start of the </p>
<p>invasion on 19 March 2003 dealt with Saddam Hussein’s military and diplomatic options, </p>
<p>WMD, or regional attitudes to Iraq.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>50. </b> The weekly Intelligence Updates issued by the Assessments Staff from November </p>
<p>2002 and more frequently from February 2003, concentrated on the same three themes.</p>
<p><b>The Defence Intelligence Staff</b></p>
<p><b>51. </b> The principal task of the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS)</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> was the provision of </p>
<p>intelligence to inform MOD policy formulation and procurement decisions, and to support </p>
<p>military operations.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>52. </b> The DIS worked closely with other UK intelligence organisations and with overseas </p>
<p>allies.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> Its sources included human, signals and imagery intelligence, as well as open </p>
<p>sources. The DIS produced a number of reports on the state of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> In late February 2003, the DIS established a Red Team to give key planners in </p>
<p>Whitehall an independent view of intelligence assumptions and key judgements, to </p>
<p>challenge those assumptions and judgements if appropriate and to identify areas where </p>
<p>more work was needed (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> Papers were copied to the Chiefs of Staff, </p>
<p>the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), the MOD, FCO, IPU and the JIC. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> Mr Martin Howard, Deputy Chief of Defence Intelligence from February 2003 to </p>
<p>May 2004, the senior civilian in the DIS, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… at the strategic level the lead agency was the JIC. They are the ones who </p>
<p>produced, as it were, the capstone intelligence assessments. </p>
<p>“What the DIS tried to do was do things at a level a little below that, to produce </p>
<p>products which would be of interest to high level policy makers, but also extremely </p>
<p>useful to planners, to commanders and so on and so forth. So I’m not sure we were </p>
<p>necessarily the lead, but we probably did the bulk of the analytical work.”</p>

<p><b>55. </b> Mr Howard stated that the DIS produced “a mass of material, even in the short </p>
<p>time we had available, and I’m not sure that there would have been a fundamental </p>
<p>improvement in what we could have provided if we had had another few months”.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Mr Howard did not recall the Red Team having a huge impact on work done by </p>

<p>than necessarily the policy making level”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Mr Ian Lee, MOD Director General Operational Policy (DG OpPol) from September </p>
<p>2002 to May 2004, told the Inquiry that the MOD looked to the DIS for information about </p>
<p>what the UK should expect to encounter in Iraq after a military campaign, including the </p>
<p>state of the country, its sectarian, ethnic, political, and economic makeup.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> There was </p>
<p>not much detail available. Mr Lee described the written briefing as “a bit generalised”. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> Major General Michael Laurie, MOD Director General Intelligence Collection from </p>
<p>2000 to 2003, told the Inquiry he did not recall the DIS being tasked to look at the </p>
<p>situation after the campaign, but did recall “a general feeling that we weren’t paying </p>
<p>as much attention to follow-on operations and what would happen as we should have </p>
<p>done”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> He agreed that it would have been within the DIS remit to consider the state of </p>
<p>Iraq’s infrastructure: the DIS had a number of teams working on infrastructure issues </p>
<p>and had an established capability to collect open source information, including from the </p>

<p><b>69. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary from 2002 to 2008, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that DFID’s knowledge of Iraq in 2002 was “pretty scanty”. It had not itself </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>UK international development policy and the  </b></p>
<p><b>Department for International Development </b></p>
<p>Between 1979 and 1997, the UK’s international development programme was managed </p>
<p>by the Overseas Development Administration (ODA), a “wing” of the FCO. The Overseas </p>
<p>Development and Cooperation Act 1980 allowed aid funds to be used for a wide variety </p>
<p>of purposes, including supporting political, industrial and commercial objectives.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A separate Department for International Development (DFID), headed by a Cabinet </p>
<p>Minister, replaced the ODA in 1997.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> Its mission was to “refocus [UK] international </p>
<p>development efforts on the elimination of poverty and encouragement of economic growth </p>
<p>which benefits the poor”. That was to be achieved by focusing on the eight Millennium </p>
<p>Development Goals: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>eradicate extreme poverty and hunger;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>achieve universal primary education;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promote gender equality and empower women;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reduce child mortality;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve maternal health;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>combat HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure environmental sustainability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>develop a global partnership for development.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DFID’s mission was enshrined in law through the International Development Act (IDA), </p>
<p>which came into force in July 2002.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> The IDA required that all programmes and projects </p>
<p>must either further sustainable development or promote the welfare of people and be likely </p>
<p>to contribute to the reduction of poverty. </p>
<p>In 2002, DFID adopted a target to increase the proportion of its bilateral aid going to low </p>
<p>income countries from 78 percent to 90 percent (the so-called “90:10” target).</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2002/03 nearly half DFID’s resources were spent through multilateral agencies. The </p>
<p>largest parts were the UK’s share of European Community development assistance and </p>
<p>contributions to the World Bank, regional development banks and the UN agencies.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>US and UK planning machinery</b></p>
<p><b>70. </b> US planning machinery was reorganised a number of times during 2002 and 2003: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before August 2002, two separate planning processes operated in parallel in the </p>
<p>State Department and the Department of Defense (DoD). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between August 2002 and January 2003, greater inter-agency co-ordination </p>
<p>was loosely overseen by an Executive Steering Group of the National Security </p>
<p>Council (NSC). The US Agency for International Development (USAID) was </p>
<p>brought into the planning process for the first time.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From January 2003, all post-conflict planning was consolidated under Mr Donald </p>
<p>Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The UK introduced significant changes to its planning machinery in September 2002 </p>
<p>and February 2003, in part to reflect US reorganisation: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Until September 2002, a tightly held process was largely confined to No.10 </p>
<p>and the MOD, with some work in the FCO and limited Whitehall co-ordination </p>
<p>through the MOD-based Pigott Group (described later in this Section) and the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office OD Sec.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between September 2002 and February 2003, the AHGI co-ordinated Whitehall </p>
<p>planning at official level. DFID, the Treasury and other departments were </p>
<p>brought into the planning process for the first time. The MOD attended the AHGI, </p>
<p>but planning for military operations continued on a separate track. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From February 2003, the inter-departmental Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), located </p>
<p>in the FCO, but including staff from the MOD and DFID, was responsible </p>
<p>for Whitehall planning for civilian aspects of post-conflict Iraq, with the MOD </p>
<p>continuing to lead on military planning. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> Those changes are described in more detail later in this Section and in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>The US approach to nation-building</b></p>
<p><b>73. </b> The future President Bush expressed his opposition to US military involvement in </p>
<p>post-conflict nation-building during the 2000 US presidential election. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> In October 2000, Governor George W Bush cited the US military intervention in </p>
<p>Somalia in 1992 and 1993 as an example of why the US military should not be involved </p>

<p>I don’t think our troops ought to be used for what’s called nation-building. I think our </p>
<p>troops ought to be used to fight and win a war. I think our troops ought to be used </p>
<p>to help overthrow the dictator when it’s in our best interests. But in this case it was </p>
<p>a nation-building exercise, and same with Haiti. I wouldn’t have supported either.”</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Dr Condoleezza Rice, who was Governor Bush’s adviser on national security before </p>
<p>becoming President Bush’s National Security Advisor, explained that Governor Bush </p>
<p>was proposing a new division of labour in NATO:</p>
<p>“The United States is the only power that can handle a showdown in the Gulf, mount </p>
<p>the kind of force that is needed to protect Saudi Arabia and deter a crisis in the </p>
<p>Taiwan Straits. And extended peacekeeping detracts from our readiness for these </p>
<p>kinds of missions.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Dr Rice stated:</p>
<p>“Carrying out civil administration and police functions is simply going to degrade the </p>
<p>American capability to do the things America has to do. We don’t need to have the </p>
<p>82nd Airborne escorting kids to kindergarten.”</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Similar views were held by Mr Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense from 2001 </p>
<p>to 2006. </p>
<p><b>78. </b> In his memoir, Mr Rumsfeld described his views before the invasion of Iraq as </p>
<p>“straightforward”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> The US goal was:</p>
<p>“… to help the Iraqis put in place a government that did not threaten Iraq’s </p>
<p>neighbours, did not support terrorism, was respectful to the diverse elements of Iraqi </p>
<p>society, and did not proliferate weapons of mass destruction. Period …</p>
<p>“As soon as we had set in motion a process, I thought it important that we reduce </p>
<p>the American military role in reconstruction and increase assistance from the United </p>
<p>Nations and other willing coalition countries.”</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Rumsfeld added:</p>
<p>“I recognized the Yankee can-do attitude by which American forces took on tasks </p>
<p>that locals would be better off doing themselves. I did not think resolving other </p>
<p>countries’ internal political disputes, paving roads, erecting power lines, policing </p>
<p>streets, building stock markets, and organizing democratic governmental bodies </p>
<p>were missions for our men and women in uniform.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>81. </b> In April 2002, Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, warned of </p>
<p>the need to learn the lessons from Afghanistan, where “US fear of getting sucked </p>
<p>into nation-building” and Secretary Rumsfeld’s insistence on a “minimalist approach” </p>
<p>threatened failure.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>82. </b> In a speech in New York on 14 February 2003, described in more detail in Section </p>
<p>6.5, Secretary Rumsfeld drew lessons for Iraq from the US experience of nation-building </p>
<p>in Afghanistan:</p>
<p>“Afghanistan belongs to the Afghans. The objective is not to engage in what some </p>
<p>call nation-building. Rather it is to help the Afghans so they can build their own </p>
<p>nation. This is an important distinction. In some nation-building exercises well-</p>
<p>intentioned foreigners … can create a dependency.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… it’s quite clear throughout 2002, and indeed throughout 2003, that it is the </p>
<p>Pentagon, it’s the military, who are running this thing …</p>
<p>“… Bush had this vision of a new Middle East. You know, we are going to change </p>
<p>Iraq, we are going to change Palestine, and it’s all going to be a new Middle East. </p>
<p>“But there were … big flaws in this argument. One is they won’t do nation-building. </p>
<p>They think this is a principle. So if you go into Iraq, how are you going to achieve this </p>
<p>new Iraq? And the military certainly don’t think it’s their job.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>84. <i></b> Hard Lessons </i>characterised US planning for post-conflict Iraq between </p>
<p>autumn 2001 and early 2003 as a “tense interplay” between the DoD and the State </p>
<p>Department.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> Many in the DoD anticipated US forces being greeted as liberators who </p>
<p>would be able leave Iraq within months, with no need for the US to administer the </p>
<p>functions of Iraq’s government after major combat operations. The State Department </p>
<p>judged that rebuilding Iraq would require “a US commitment of enormous scope” over </p>
<p>several years.</p>

<p>129</p>
<p><b>86.  During 2001, UK officials began to consider the possible shape of Iraq after </b></p>
<p><b>the departure of Saddam Hussein. </b></p>
<p><b>87.  At that stage, the UK assumption was that the most likely successor to </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein was another Sunni strongman.</b></p>
<p><b>88.  A number of concerns emerged during initial exchanges:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the long-term implications of military action;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>US support for the Iraqi opposition;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the dilapidated state of Iraq’s infrastructure;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the risks of de-Ba’athification; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the absence of obvious successors to Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>89. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair stated that the final part of his speech to the House of </p>
<p>Commons on 18 March 2003, in which he set out the moral case for action against </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, echoed his Chicago speech of 22 April 1999.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>90. </b> In the Chicago speech, described in more detail in Section 1.1, Mr Blair had raised </p>
<p>the importance of being prepared for the long term after military intervention.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>91. </b> In a reference to international security, Mr Blair identified “two dangerous and </p>
<p>ruthless men” as the cause of “many of our problems”: Saddam Hussein and Slobodan </p>
<p>Milošević (President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), both of whom had waged </p>
<p>“vicious campaigns against sections of their own community”. Instead of enjoying its oil </p>
<p>wealth, Iraq had been “reduced to poverty, with political life stultified through fear”.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> Mr Blair set out “five major considerations” to guide a decision on when and whether </p>
<p>the international community should intervene militarily in other countries, including:</p>
<p>“… are we prepared for the long term? In the past, we talked too much of exit </p>
<p>strategies. But having made a commitment we cannot simply walk away once the </p>
<p>fight is over; better to stay with moderate numbers of troops than return for repeat </p>
<p>performances with large numbers.” </p>
<p><b>93.  Mr Blair sent a draft ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’ to President Bush in </b></p>
<p><b>December 2001.</b></p>
<p><b>94. </b> In autumn 2000, the Government began a review of the UK’s Iraq policy. That </p>
<p>process, which continued into 2001, is addressed in detail in Section 3.1.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>130</p>
<p><b>95. </b> During 2001, on the initiative of Mr Robin Cook, the Foreign Secretary, the UK </p>
<p>Government worked on a draft ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’ intended to deliver a </p>
<p>clear statement on the steps the international community would take to restore and </p>
<p>rehabilitate Iraq in the event of Saddam Hussein’s departure (see Box below).</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’</b></p>
<p>The ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’ made clear that Iraq could not be re-integrated into </p>
<p>the international community without fundamental change in the behaviour of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime, but stopped short of calling directly for the regime’s overthrow.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> It was </p>
<p>designed “to appeal to regional states and to signal to any successor regime the sort of </p>
<p>relationship with the international community that would be in prospect”. </p>
<p>The last (December 2001) version of the text seen by the Inquiry stated:</p>
<p>“We want to work with the International Community to enhance stability and security </p>
<p>in the Gulf region. We are committed to maintenance of Iraq’s sovereignty and </p>
<p>territorial integrity within its current borders.</p>
<p>“We want to work with an Iraq which respects the rights of its people, lives at peace </p>
<p>with its neighbours and which observes international law. We want to see Iraq’s full </p>
<p>integration into the International Community.</p>
<p>“The Iraqi people have a right to live in a society based on the rule of law, free from </p>
<p>repression, murder, torture and arbitrary arrest; to enjoy respect for human rights, </p>
<p>economic freedom and prosperity.</p>
<p>“For all this to happen the Iraqi regime must abide by its obligations under </p>
<p>international law …</p>
<p>“The record of the current regime … suggests that its priorities remain elsewhere. </p>
<p>The regime must end its mistreatment of the Iraqi people and be held to account </p>
<p>for its war crimes. We must ensure that the Iraqi people have access to information </p>
<p>not controlled by the regime. Those who wish to promote change in Iraq deserve </p>
<p>our support.</p>
<p>“Until such time as Iraq is able to rejoin the international community we will continue </p>
<p>to ensure that it is not in a position to threaten its neighbours and that there are </p>
<p>tight controls on its ability to build up its military and WMD capability. We will also </p>
<p>endeavour to minimise the impact of these controls on the Iraqi people.” </p>
<p>The ‘Contract’ set out objectives to be pursued once Iraq rejoined the international </p>
<p>community:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for an international reconstruction programme for Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>rebuilding political relations with the rest of the world;</p>

<p>Section. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> On 3 December 2001, in response to a request from Mr Blair for “a note on the </p>
<p>options for dealing with Iraq”, Mr Simon McDonald, Principal Private Secretary to </p>
<p>Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, advised No.10 that:</p>
<p>“A strategy to deal with a WMD threat will require ratcheting up our present policy </p>
<p>of containment … We should encourage and support the Iraqi opposition. We could </p>
<p>mount a higher profile campaign on the issue of war crimes and consider the options </p>
<p>for an international tribunal to try Saddam and his principal lieutenants. We could set </p>
<p>out a vision of post-Saddam Iraq by deploying a ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’.”</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>97. </b> The other issues addressed in Mr McDonald’s letter are considered in Section 3.1.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> On 4 December, Mr Blair sent President Bush a paper, ‘The War against Terrorism: </p>
<p>The Second Phase’, which was delivered by Sir David Manning (see Section 3.1).</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>99. </b> The key points relating to Iraq included the need for “a strategy for regime change </p>
<p>which builds over time” and might include supporting opposition groups, and setting out </p>
<p>an agenda for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq (the FCO’s ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’).</p>
<p><b>100. </b> In December 2001, an attempt was made by a senior Republican close to the </p>
<p>Pentagon to persuade Mr Kevin Tebbit, MOD PUS, that the opposition Iraqi National </p>
<p>Congress (INC) could be a force to be reckoned with, “sufficient to cause an Iraqi </p>
<p>response and enable the US to take supportive military action” (see Section 3.1).</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>101. </b> On 13 December, Mr Tebbit commissioned an analysis of that thesis, which he </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>102. </b> In its response on 14 January 2002, the DIS concluded that the INC’s weaknesses </p>
<p>far outweighed its strengths and that it would have no chance of overthrowing </p>
<p>the regime.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>103. </b> On 21 December 2001, in the context of discussions on the sustainability of  </p>
<p>US/UK joint patrols to enforce the NFZs in Iraq, Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, </p>
<p>asked MOD officials for advice on options for future military action against Iraq and their </p>
<p>“political, legal and military implications” (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Dr Simon Cholerton, a junior official in Overseas Secretariat (Sec(O)), replied on </p>
<p>24 January 2002.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> He focused on options for patrolling the NFZs, but also addressed </p>
<p>the issue of wider action against Iraq. Dr Cholerton emphasised that neither the MOD </p>
<p>nor the FCO had seen any “detailed US planning”. Work on policy options, at both </p>
<p>military and political levels, was continuing in the US but “little, if anything has been </p>
<p>shared with the UK”. He advised that the “initial assessment of the efficacy (never mind </p>
<p>the legality) of military action to effect regime change is that it is poor”. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Dr Cholerton explained that work commissioned by Mr Tebbit in December 2001 </p>
<p>had addressed the strengths and weaknesses of the INC. In the MOD’s view: </p>
<p>“There is no [Afghan] Northern Alliance equivalent in Iraq who could take advantage </p>
<p>of precision bombing – nor is it obvious that a successor regime would be an </p>
<p>improvement on the existing one. In the absence of any detailed US planning …  </p>
<p>it is very difficult to comment further.”</p>
<p><b>106.  In January and February 2002, the DIS in London and junior officials based at </b></p>
<p><b>the British Embassy Amman produced a number of reports on the state of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>politics, economy and society.</b></p>
<p><b>107.  The DIS reports painted a bleak picture of the state of Iraq’s infrastructure </b></p>
<p><b>and highlighted the degree of inter-connectedness between the Ba’ath Party and </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s armed forces and civil bureaucracy.</b></p>
<p><b>108.  The British Embassy Amman reported that foreign diplomats based in </b></p>
<p><b>Baghdad were agreed that, without massive external commitment on the ground </b></p>
<p><b>or the continuation of “the current system of order”, there was a risk that regime </b></p>
<p><b>change would destabilise Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>109. </b> In mid-January 2002, the DIS reported on Iraq’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> With the exception </p>
<p>of road and rail transport, the picture was comprehensively bleak. Services had </p>

<p>since then had been minimal. The DIS assessed that theoretical power generation </p>
<p>capacity was about 10,000 megawatts (MW), but that the “practical limit” was about </p>
<p>5,000 MW, well below “even the most basic demand”. Power cuts were widespread </p>
<p>and prolonged. The report stated that the UN had begun extensive works to rehabilitate </p>
<p>the transmission network. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> The DIS cited “a recent UN report” which suggested the Iraqi oil industry had </p>
<p>declined seriously over the previous 18 months and that “urgent measures” needed </p>
<p>to be taken to avoid yet more deterioration of oil wells and petroleum infrastructure. </p>
<p>Of 12 oil refineries in Iraq, only three were operating, inefficiently and unreliably. </p>
<p>Pipelines in Iraq had not been repaired since 1991 and oil distribution was by road.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> On Iraq’s water and sewerage systems, the DIS assessed that: </p>
<p>“... despite recent heavy investment into modernisation and extension of municipal </p>
<p>water systems, the water supply and sanitation sectors in Iraq are in a state of </p>
<p>continuous deterioration.”</p>
<p><b>112. </b> The DIS reported that, across Iraq, power outages and damage to water pipes </p>
<p>meant a substantial proportion of piped water was routinely lost and that the water </p>
<p>supply was known to be affected by sewage leaks. There were marked differences </p>
<p>between urban areas, where 96 percent of the population had access to safe, potable </p>
<p>water, and rural areas, where the figure was 48 percent. In particular, Basra province </p>
<p>was “chronically short” of drinkable water, with treatment plants working at less than </p>
<p>60 percent of capacity. </p>
<p><b>113. </b> The sewerage system was in very poor condition. Sewage treatment, even in </p>
<p>Baghdad, was “virtually non-existent”, with the few treatment plants that were functioning </p>
<p>operating at less than a third of capacity. Sanitary conditions were deteriorating because </p>
<p>of indiscriminate dumping of sewage and industrial and medical waste.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> The DIS warned that, throughout Iraq, water supplies were: </p>
<p>“... contaminated by pathogenic bacteria, parasites and viruses. Given the shortages </p>
<p>of essential treatment chemicals, deployed forces could not rely on local water </p>
<p>supplies as a source of safe, potable water.” </p>
<p><b>115. </b> A second DIS report, in late January, stated that the Ba’ath Party, the Iraqi civil </p>
<p>bureaucracy and the armed forces were intertwined: “every government ministry (as well </p>
<p>as state labour organisations, youth and student organisations and media organisations) </p>
<p>has within it, at each level, a parallel Ba’ath Party structure”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>116. </b> The second report concluded:</p>
<p>“… any ‘regime insider’ succeeding Saddam would find the functional roles of the </p>
<p>Party indispensable in administering the state and controlling the populace. One </p>
<p>can therefore assume that, unless a fundamental political change accompanies the </p>
<p>succession to Saddam, the Ba’ath Party will continue in its present role. Were a </p>
<p>figure outside the inner circle of the regime to take power (such as a senior military </p>
<p>officer), the future of the party would be open to question.” </p>
<p><b>117. </b> The paper provided details of eight ranks in the Ba’ath Party. The three most </p>
<p>senior, in ascending order, were: <i>Udw Firqa</i> (Division Leader); <i>Udw Shu’ba</i> (Section </p>
<p>Leader); and <i>Udw Fara’</i> (Branch Leader). Party membership was estimated at between </p>
<p>600,000 and 700,000, four percent of the Iraqi population.</p>
<p><b>118. </b> The earliest UK consideration of options for dealing with the Ba’ath Party in a post-</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein Iraq seen by the Inquiry appeared in an MOD paper on UK military </p>
<p>strategic thinking in mid-June 2002, described later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> The DIS papers on infrastructure and the Ba’ath Party were included in Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>summer reading pack at the end of July. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Much of the material in the infrastructure paper was incorporated into a DIS report </p>
<p>on Basra in March 2003 (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>121. </b> In January 2002, the British Embassy Amman reported on the economic situation </p>
<p>in Iraq, drawing on a seven-day visit to Iraq by an Embassy junior official.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> Changes to </p>
<p>the Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme had led to improvements to Baghdad’s infrastructure </p>
<p>and the provision of some essential services, although “underlying poverty” remained </p>
<p>and power cuts continued. There were signs that the private sector was picking up. </p>

<p><b>131. </b> Mr Sawers argued that:</p>

<p>“And there are many such questions. What is the plan? How long would it take for </p>

<p><b>138. </b> At the request of Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), the </p>

<p>Hussein over the next 12 months.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> The paper is described in more detail in Section 6.1. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> In the list of key judgements, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“The UK intelligence community has consistently assessed that the only viable, </p>
<p>long-term successor to Saddam will come from within the Sunni security/military </p>
<p>structure. Such a figure is unlikely to command popular support among the Shia or </p>
<p>Kurdish populations and would be forced (and probably inclined) to run Iraq along </p>
<p>autocratic lines. Iraq will remain a unitary state, but many of the long-term problems </p>
<p>of Iraq will not disappear with Saddam.” </p>
<p><b>140. </b> The paper described the Iraqi opposition in exile:</p>
<p><b>“The Iraqi National Congress (INC), based in London, remains the main </b></p>
<p><b>umbrella opposition grouping. </b>Both Kurdish factions (KDP [Kurdistan Democratic </p>
<p>Party] and PUK [Patriotic Union of Kurdistan]) are represented along with various </p>

<p><b>141. </b> The concluding section addressed Iraq after Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“We assess that despite potential instability Iraq will remain a unitary state. But </p>
<p>many of Iraq’s structural problems will remain. Sunni hegemony, the position of </p>
<p>the Kurds and Shia, enmity with Kuwait, infighting among the elite, autocratic rule </p>
<p>and anti-Israeli sentiment will not disappear with Saddam. We should also expect </p>
<p>considerable anti-Western sentiment among a populace that has experienced ten </p>
<p>years of sanctions.</p>
<p>“A US attempt to create a more equitable long-term distribution of power in Iraq </p>
<p>would require massive and lengthy commitment. Modern Iraq has been dominated </p>
<p>politically, militarily and socially by the Sunni. To alter that would entail re-creation </p>

<p>The paper stated: “we need to wait and see which options or combination of options </p>

<p><b>Government contact with the Iraqi opposition</b></p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen evidence of four meetings between UK Ministers and the Iraqi </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>separate meetings with the “Group of Four” (G4) Iraqi opposition parties and the </p>
<p>Iraqi National Conference (INC) in March 2002, hosted by Mr Ben Bradshaw, </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a visit to No.10 by the two leaders of the Iraqi Kurds in December 2002, part of </p>

<p>94</p>
<p> and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a meeting between Mr Straw and “Iraqi exiles” in London on 21 February 2003.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At official level, by late 2002, it was UK policy “to stay in touch with the thinking of </p>
<p>opposition groups who may have a role to play in shaping a post-Saddam Iraq”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Regular, routine meetings” took place between opposition representatives and junior FCO </p>
<p>officials. There were occasional meetings at senior official level. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> On 15 March, Mr William Patey, Head of MED, sent Mr Straw a paper by Research </p>
<p>Analysts on the “nature and role of the opposition to Saddam” commissioned by Sir </p>
<p>David Manning.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>154. </b> The paper cautioned that the UK’s ability to influence or direct the Iraqi opposition </p>
<p>was constrained by dependence on contacts with Iraqi exiles. Ten years without </p>
<p>diplomatic representation in Iraq meant that the UK knew little about the internal </p>
<p>opposition to Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> The paper listed three main problems dealing with the external opposition:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of a coherent structure, with Western offers of financial support or </p>
<p>political backing exacerbating rivalries between groups;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of Sunni representation in the INC, which was dominated by </p>
<p>Kurds and Shia Arabs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of credibility. Regional governments had no faith in the INC’s ability to </p>
<p>achieve its goals and high-profile Western support left it open to charges of </p>
<p>being a Western stooge.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Research Analysts reported few signs of co-ordinated opposition in Iraq, where </p>
<p>most organisations were believed to be penetrated by agents of the regime. It concluded </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein’s immediate successor was most likely to be a senior Sunni </p>
<p>member or ex-member of the Iraqi military. </p>

<p><b>166. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that a series of issues would need to be addressed </p>
<p>if the US decided on military action against Iraq. One was whether the US “wanted </p>
<p>company”. If it wanted the support of a coalition, it would have to address a number of </p>
<p>concerns that would be critical in determining the attitude of potential partners:</p>
<p>“… the US would need to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mount a public information campaign explaining the nature of Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime and the threat he posed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>describe the role that the US envisaged for the UN, and particularly for the </p>
<p>weapons inspectors;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide a convincing plan setting out how a combination of outside military </p>
<p>pressure, and external and internal opposition could topple Saddam; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide an equally convincing blueprint for a post Saddam Iraq … </p>
<p>acceptable to its neighbours as well as to its own population.</p>
<p>“… Preparing public opinion and deciding who and what might replace Saddam </p>
<p>were tough propositions.”</p>

<p><b>167.  Before Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Crawford, Mr Hoon, </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Straw and Sir Christopher Meyer expressed concern about the potential </b></p>
<p><b>longer-term implications of military action in Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>168. </b> On 22 March, Mr Hoon advised Mr Blair: “If a coalition takes control of Baghdad … </p>
<p>it will probably have to stay there for many years.”</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>169. </b> In evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Hoon recalled that he had pointed out that:</p>
<p>“… we had never successfully identified at that stage someone who might replace </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein. There was real concern about what Iraq might look like in </p>
<p>the aftermath of his regime being removed, and … that debate was a very live </p>
<p>debate …”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 25 March, advising that the Government was a long </p>
<p>way from convincing the Parliamentary Labour Party that “the consequence of military </p>
<p>action really would be a compliant, law abiding replacement government”.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> On the </p>
<p>“big question” of what military action would achieve, there was “a larger hole … than on </p>
<p>anything”. Mr Straw added: “Iraq has had no history of democracy so no-one has this </p>
<p>habit or experience.” </p>
<p><b>171. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer advised on 1 April that President Bush had raised </p>
<p>expectations that the US would take military action against Iraq in autumn 2002, but </p>
<p>questions were beginning to be asked about the risks.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer reported: </p>
<p>“There is no shortage of Bush insiders who tell us that the die is cast for a regime-</p>
<p>change operation of some sort this autumn. But there is now a sense that the </p>
<p>Administration are for the first time really staring the hard questions in the face: how </p>
<p>much international support is needed: what smart options are available to topple </p>
<p>Saddam: above all what happens afterwards. There is a doubt among some – no </p>
<p>bigger than a fist sized cloud on the horizon – that Iraq might be too risky politically.” </p>
<p><b>173. </b> Sir Christopher also offered advice on the US approach in Afghanistan, where </p>
<p>decisions had been taken:</p>
<p>“... in a very small circle of key officials around the President. Where Rumsfeld (and </p>
<p>General [Tommy] Franks [Commander in Chief CENTCOM]) have not been fully </p>
<p>engaged, little action has resulted. Many in the Administration recognise that, on the </p>
<p>ground, there is a real danger of losing Afghanistan because of a US fear of getting </p>
<p>sucked into nation-building. But Rumsfeld has, in effect, blocked all but a minimalist </p>
<p>approach.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry that he had advised Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“‘There are three things you really need to focus on when you get to Crawford. One </p>
<p>is how to garner international support for a policy of regime change, if that is what it </p>
<p>turns out to be. If it involves removing Saddam Hussein, how do you do it and when </p>
<p>do you do it?’ And the last thing I said, which became a kind of theme of virtually all </p>
<p>the reporting I sent back to London in that year was, ‘Above all … get them to focus </p>
<p>on the aftermath, because, if it comes to war and Saddam Hussein is removed, and </p>
<p>then …?’”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>175. </b> On 2 April, Mr Blair held a meeting at Chequers to prepare for his meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush at Crawford (see Section 3.2). </p>
<p><b>176. </b> No formal record was made of the discussion or who was present. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Accounts given by participants suggest that Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (Chief of </p>
<p>the Defence Staff (CDS)), Sir Kevin Tebbit (representing Mr Hoon, who was unable to </p>
<p>attend), Lt Gen Pigott, Lieutenant General Cedric Delves (senior UK liaison officer at </p>

<p>(Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff), Sir David Manning, Mr Alastair Campbell (Mr Blair’s Director of </p>

<p><b>178. </b> The FCO was not represented. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell recorded that Lt Gen Pigott said at the meeting: </p>
<p>“post-conflict had to be part of conflict preparation”.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> Mr Campbell added: “There was </p>
<p>a discussion about who would replace Saddam and how could we guarantee it would </p>
<p>be better. Scarlett said it couldn’t be worse.” </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Rycroft told the Inquiry that, around this time: “Undoubtedly the thought was in </p>
<p>the Prime Minister’s mind that if at the end of this we were going to go down the military </p>

<p><b>FCO views on strategic direction might have been expected to have most </b></p>
<p><b>influence; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>UK military planning dominated Whitehall consideration of Iraq, with </b></p>
<p><b>the consequence that any potential UK involvement was considered </b></p>
<p><b>principally in terms of the military role; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>DFID expertise on post-conflict issues was excluded from discussion as </b></p>
<p><b>strategy took shape; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the systematic research and analysis of post-conflict issues that was </b></p>

<p><b>186.  Many of the failings in UK planning and preparation over the coming year </b></p>
<p><b>stemmed from those developments. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>190. </b> In his speech at College Station on 7 April, Mr Blair argued:</p>
<p>“Prevention is better than cure. The reason it would be crazy for us to clear out of </p>
<p>Afghanistan once we had finished militarily, is that if it drifts back into instability, the </p>
<p>same old problems will re-emerge. Stick at it and we can show, eventually, as in the </p>
<p>Balkans, the unstable starts to become stable.”</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>191.  Immediately after Crawford, UK officials and the UK military began to define </b></p>
<p><b>the possible end state after a military operation against Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>192. </b> Section 6.1 describes how consideration of UK military options intensified after </p>
<p>Crawford. </p>
<p><b>193. </b> On 8 April, Mr Hoon discussed Iraq with Adm Boyce and Sir Kevin Tebbit.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Afterwards he commissioned further work on potential military options, to be conducted </p>
<p>“on very close hold”. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> On 12 April, Mr Webb sent Mr Hoon a “think piece”, listing three possible US </p>
<p>options for invasion and touching briefly on post-invasion commitments: </p>
<p>“To secure the country subsequently would depend critically on the extent of popular </p>
<p>support: but without it how could we justify staying? It is possible that forces would </p>
<p>be needed only sufficient to secure a new popular figure from being dislodged by </p>
<p>dissident remnants. But we have to be ready for a longer job against an uncertain </p>
<p>background of host nation support and regional instability.”</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Webb suggested that:</p>
<p>“… there could be advantage in the MOD doing some discreet internal strategic </p>
<p>estimating. This should help us think through what would be the key strategic </p>
<p>objectives and end states and the ‘centre of gravity’ of the situation we need to </p>
<p>tackle; and give better shape to redefining potential force packages (within the </p>
<p>large region).</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Actively to prepare for operations on Iraq would obviously attract interest and </p>
<p>possibly reactions … There would come a point at which preparations could </p>
<p>apply some valuable pressure on Saddam; or be seen as a natural reaction to </p>
<p>prevarication over inspections. In general, however, until that point – say in the </p>
<p>summer – we should keep a low profile, confining ourselves to the items that </p>
<p>timeline analysis shows need to be got underway to preserve the ability to contribute </p>
<p>on time later.</p>

<p>“… The FCO are content for activity to be centred on MOD to preserve the best </p>
<p>prospect for dialogue with US DoD. All scoping activity would be confined to the </p>
<p>minimum number of named individuals.” </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit explained to the Inquiry that: “At this early stage … April 2002, </p>
<p>we did not know whether the Americans were going to go for a military option and, if so, </p>
<p>which one. So this was very, very preliminary ground clearing.”</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>197.  An MOD-led, inter-departmental group of senior officials, headed by Lt Gen </b></p>
<p><b>Pigott, was established in April 2002. That body, which came to be known as the </b></p>
<p><b>Pigott Group, considered issues related to UK participation in a US-led ground </b></p>
<p><b>offensive in Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>198.  In spring 2002 the Pigott Group was the FCO’s principal forum for </b></p>
<p><b>contributions to cross-government consideration of post-conflict Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>199.  Mr Peter Ricketts, the FCO Political Director and FCO member of the Pigott </b></p>
<p><b>Group, took responsibility for Whitehall consideration of the UK’s desired “end </b></p>
<p><b>state” for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>200. </b> On 25 April, Mr Peter Ricketts, the FCO Political Director, informed Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>Private Office, Sir Michael Jay and a small number of other senior FCO officials, that the </p>
<p>MOD had established “a small group of senior officials and military planners [the Pigott </p>
<p>Group] to think about the issues that would be involved in any military operation in Iraq, </p>
<p>as the basis for initial contingency planning in the MOD”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> Participants included the </p>
<p>FCO, Cabinet Office, JIC and Intelligence Agencies. </p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Ricketts described the Group’s work as “a sensitive exercise”. Participation was </p>
<p>being tightly restricted and paperwork would be kept to a minimum, but it was “important </p>
<p>that the FCO was involved from the ground floor with MOD thinking”. </p>
<p><b>202. </b> The first meeting of the Pigott Group took place in late April. Mr Ricketts reported </p>
<p>that it had covered “mainly the political context, including the implications of the </p>
<p>Arab/Israel crisis, attitudes in the Arab states, the risks of Iraq disintegrating and the </p>
<p>consequences of that”. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> The meeting also considered how to define the objective, or “end state” of a </p>
<p>military operation:</p>
<p>“As we found in the run-up to the Afghanistan operation, defining the objective of </p>
<p>an operation is crucial since this defines the scope of the operations and hence </p>
<p>the scale of military effort required. The MOD had tried their hand at a definition of </p>
<p>the ‘end state’ which was discussed at length, and I undertook to produce a further </p>
<p>version.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>“I have now done so. Before feeding it in to the Whitehall [Pigott] group, it would be </p>
<p>helpful to know whether the Foreign Secretary thinks we are on the right lines. At </p>
<p>this stage, it is only to inform MOD contingency planning: at the right point, these </p>
<p>issues would have to be negotiated carefully and at a high level with the Americans, </p>
<p>who will have their own priorities. My proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘A stable and law-abiding Iraq, within its present borders, co-operating with </p>
<p>the international community, no longer posing a threat to global security or </p>
<p>to its neighbours, and abiding by its international obligations on control of its </p>
<p>WMD.’”</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Ricketts reported that the Pigott Group had debated a number of issues related </p>
<p>to the end state, including:</p>
<p>“... should there be anything more explicit about a future regime abiding by </p>
<p>international norms on the treatment of its own population? I have got ‘law-abiding’ </p>
<p>which is designed to capture that. There is a risk in overloading a definition of the </p>
<p>‘end state’ with desirable outcomes which cannot be achieved by military means.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Ricketts explained that the meeting had commissioned further work on a range </p>
<p>of intelligence issues, which would be addressed by the JIC. The military would work on </p>
<p>“the likely scale of effort required”. He proposed that he or Mr Stephen Wright, Director </p>
<p>General Defence and Intelligence, should represent the FCO at future meetings, </p>
<p>accompanied by Mr Edward Chaplin (Mr Goulty’s successor as Director Middle East </p>
<p>and North Africa), who should remain the FCO “point man on Iraq issues”. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> Mr Ricketts made no reference to further contingency planning in the FCO.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> On 3 May, Mr Ricketts sent a very slightly amended definition of the end state, </p>

<p>“A stable and law-abiding Iraq, within its present borders, co-operating with the </p>
<p>international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or  </p>
<p>to international security, and abiding by its international obligations on control  </p>

<p>119</p>
<p><b>208. </b> On 10 May, Lt Gen Pigott advised Mr Hoon that, although his Group was focused </p>
<p>on military options, it needed to be supported by thinking on the end state.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>explained that the FCO was already engaged on the issue. </p>
<p><b>209. </b> A revised version of the end state, agreed by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon, was sent </p>

<p>149</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We [the Pigott Group] didn’t discuss military planning as such. We discussed  </p>
<p>the implications of military planning for other departments’ activities … We worked </p>
<p>up in that group an end state which was one of the political implications of any </p>
<p>military plan.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>211.  In early May 2002, the international effort to resolve the India/Pakistan crisis </b></p>
<p><b>was the FCO’s principal foreign policy concern and the major preoccupation for </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Straw, Sir Michael Jay and Mr Ricketts. </b></p>
<p><b>212.  Iraq policy was a lower priority and restricted to a small number of officials.</b></p>
<p><b>213.  Despite those constraints, it fell to the FCO to ensure that the military </b></p>
<p><b>contingency planning already under way in the MOD was placed in a wider </b></p>
<p><b>strategic context, and that it took place alongside analysis of non-military options </b></p>
<p><b>for achieving the desired end state in Iraq.</b> </p>
<p><b>214.  There is no indication that senior FCO officials commissioned such work </b></p>
<p><b>during spring and early summer 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Tom McKane, Deputy Head of OD Sec, was asked by the Inquiry whether the </p>
<p>Pigott Group had considered aftermath planning. He explained:</p>
<p>“There wasn’t from my recollection much, if any, discussion about the aftermath in </p>
<p>terms of infrastructure of the country, the security of the country, or humanitarian </p>
<p>or development assistance. That wasn’t the focus of these meetings, and I think </p>
<p>that it’s not really surprising, given that they were meetings being convened in the </p>
<p>Ministry of Defence and had quite a defence focus. </p>
<p>“… [T]he focus of everybody at that point was … what is the military plan going to </p>
<p>be? What is the form of the UK contribution likely to be? … [U]ntil one had … some </p>
<p>resolution on those points the question of precisely what the aftermath was going to </p>
<p>be was not something that could be settled.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr McKane added:</p>
<p>“We had not got to the point at that stage of planning for an aftermath, because </p>
<p>there wasn’t yet an aftermath to be planned for.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>218. </b> On 24 May, the MOD Strategic Planning Group (SPG), headed by Brigadier </p>
<p>James Dutton and reporting to Lt Gen Pigott, produced a paper for the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on potential UK military commitments.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> ‘Contingency Thinking: Force Generation and </p>
<p>Deployment for the Gulf’ (see Section 6.1) was circulated to a limited number of named </p>
<p>MOD addressees. It aimed to provide sufficient information “to judge what the UK’s </p>
<p>maximum level of commitment could be in the event of a contingent operation against </p>
<p>Iraq, together with appropriate costs and timings”. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> On the post-conflict phase, the paper stated that it might be necessary to maintain </p>
<p>force elements in theatre for policing, stabilisation or humanitarian operations, which had </p>
<p>the potential to add considerably to the cost and commitments, depending on the end </p>
<p>state of the campaign. </p>
<p><b>220. </b> The emerging findings from the SPG analysis were presented to Mr Hoon on </p>
<p>24 May to report to Mr Blair in advance of a planned meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld </p>
<p>in early June.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Mr Hoon sent Mr Blair an update on military contingency planning for Iraq on </p>
<p>31 May (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr Hoon’s minute was copied to Mr Gordon Brown (Chancellor of the Exchequer), </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Sir Richard Wilson (Cabinet Secretary). The minute included a definition of </p>
<p>the end state, which it described as “tentative objectives to guide” contingency planning. </p>
<p>The definition, agreed with Mr Straw, envisaged:</p>
<p>“A stable and law-abiding Iraq, within its present borders, co-operating with the </p>
<p>international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or international </p>
<p>security, abiding by its international obligations on WMD.”</p>
<p><b>223. </b> Mr Hoon advised: </p>
<p>“In order for us to plan properly we need to know what outcome in Iraq the US </p>
<p>would wish to achieve … and when the US might wish to take action. It would also </p>
<p>be useful to know how long the US see themselves as remaining engaged in Iraq. </p>
<p>Further, we need to clarify the policy basis and legal justification for any action.” </p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr William Nye, Head of the Treasury Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, </p>
<p>provided a commentary for Mr Brown on 7 June.</p>

<p> He pointed out that the MOD had </p>
<p>only provided costings for preparing for an operation, not for deploying a force, for a </p>
<p>campaign, or for any “follow-up operation”. He commented:</p>
<p>“MOD have understandably given no thought to costs ‘after the war’ … But there </p>
<p>must at least be the possibility of some medium-term deployment for peacekeeping </p>
<p>or occupation. If on the scale of the Balkans, it would cost several £100m a year.” </p>

<p><b>The Future of Iraq Project</b></p>
<p>In October 2001, the US State Department began work on what became known as the </p>
<p>Future of Iraq Project.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> The project was launched publicly in early 2002. It involved a </p>
<p>series of working groups of Iraqi exiles and officials from the State Department, each </p>
<p>looking at an area of importance to Iraq’s future, including justice, education, the economy, </p>
<p>infrastructure, the environment and reform of government institutions.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> The objective was </p>
<p>to expand the scope of US post-war planning and provide a common focus for competing </p>
<p>exile groups. </p>
<p>The Future of Iraq Project worked independently of the US inter-agency planning process. </p>
<p>It developed parallel proposals for post-invasion Iraq that did not contribute to the official </p>
<p>US planning effort. According to <i>Hard Lessons</i>: </p>
<p>“The richly developed reports constitute the single most rigorous assessment </p>
<p>conducted by the US Government before the war. Although the findings … did not </p>
<p>amount to an operational plan … [they] contained facts and analysis that could – and </p>
<p>in some cases did – inform operational planning.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>As a whole, the project failed to make a significant impact on US planning:</p>
<p>“… the project’s reports did not capture the attention of the State Department’s senior </p>
<p>decision-makers … Without a high-level patron, the … reports lacked the visibility and </p>
<p>clout to reach key decision-makers in time.”</p>
<p>UK officials were aware of the project, but the Inquiry has seen very little evidence of UK </p>
<p>engagement with the working groups or analysis of the final report. </p>
<p>The 1,500 page, 13 volume final report is publicly available in the US National Security </p>
<p>Archives.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> It is a compendium of papers prepared by the different working groups, some </p>
<p>agreed by consensus, others not. </p>
<p>The US National Security Archive summary of the project highlights some prescient </p>
<p>observations in the final report, including warnings that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the period after regime change might provide an opportunity for criminals “to </p>
<p>engage in acts of killing, plunder looting, etc.”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>former Ba’athists not re-integrated into society “may present a destabilizing </p>
<p>element”, especially if unable to find employment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a decade of sanctions had resulted in the spread of “endemic corruption and </p>
<p>black market activities into every sector of … economic life” that would be </p>
<p>difficult to reverse;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the relationship between the new Iraqi state and religion was an intractable issue </p>
<p>“which ultimately only the people of Iraq can decide on”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>repair of Iraq’s electricity grid would be a key determinant of Iraqis’ reaction to </p>
<p>the presence of foreign forces.</p>
<p>The Economy and Infrastructure Working Group</p>
<p>The final report of the Economy and Infrastructure Working Group provides one example </p>
<p>of the range of material generated by the Future of Iraq Project.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quoting data from the US Department of Energy, the Working Group reported that </p>
<p>85-90 percent of Iraq’s national power grid and 20 power stations had been damaged </p>
<p>or destroyed in 1991. The UN programme to restore electricity generation in central </p>
<p>and southern Iraq to pre-1991 levels required US$10bn, of which $US4.7bn had been </p>
<p>allocated from Oil-for-Food (OFF) funds since 1996. US$1.67bn of material had reached </p>
<p>Iraq, but only 60 percent had been put to use. In northern Iraq, problems included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to transmission lines and substations in 1991;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to replace major circuits constructed out of salvaged material after the </p>
<p>region’s disconnection from the Iraqi national grid in 1991; </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Mr McKane described the 18 June discussion to Sir David Manning as “preparatory </p>
<p>to military talks with the US … at which Tony Pigott and Desmond Bowen [MOD Director </p>
<p>General Operational Policy (DG Op Pol)] would represent the UK” (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>236. </b> The SPG paper set out the desired end state for Iraq in two forms: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A UK text, substantively unchanged from the version agreed by Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Mr Hoon: “A stable and law-abiding Iraq, within present borders, co-operating </p>
<p>with the IC [international community], no longer posing a threat to its neighbours </p>
<p>or to international security, and abiding by its international obligations on WMD.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A US version derived from the CENTCOM Iraq plan: “maintenance of Iraq as </p>
<p>a viable nation state, disavowing the use of WMD but capable of defending </p>
<p>its borders and contributing to the counter balance of Iran”. The SPG </p>
<p>paper added that US was “determined to achieve a more representative, </p>
<p>non-tyrannical government”.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>237. </b> The SPG stated that the end state “cannot be achieved while the current Iraqi </p>
<p>regime remains in power. Consequently, regime change is a necessary step and there </p>
<p>is no point in pursuing any strategy that does not achieve this.” </p>
<p><b>238. </b> The paper listed a number of “military/strategic implications” of this approach, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>“Post-conflict. Need to acknowledge that there will be a post-conflict phase with </p>
<p>an associated commitment, manpower and finance bill. Depending on how the </p>
<p>regime change is achieved, and the form of the replacement, there is a spectrum </p>
<p>of commitment where the worst case is a long period with a large bill.”</p>
<p><b>239. </b> The SPG judged that domination of Iraq’s state institutions, security organisations </p>
<p>and the officer corps by Sunni Arabs, who constituted just 15 percent of the population, </p>
<p>made the country “potentially fundamentally unstable”. Iraq was held together by the </p>
<p>strong security apparatus. It would require considerable force to break the security </p>
<p>structure, but when that happened the regime would “shatter”. </p>
<p><b>240. </b> Three possibilities for regime change were presented:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removal of Saddam Hussein and key advisers, including his sons, to be replaced </p>
<p>by a Sunni strongman;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removal of Saddam Hussein and “his wider security and governing regime” to be </p>
<p>replaced by an “International Presence coupled with a bridging process leading </p>
<p>eventually to a broad based coalition”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removal of the entire Ba’athist regime to be replaced by a federated state.</p>

<p><b>241. </b> The section of the paper on post-conflict tasks stated:</p>
<p>“This will depend on how regime change occurs, and what shape the campaign </p>
<p>takes to bring about the change. However, key differences between Iraq and recent </p>
<p>experience in Afghanistan and Balkans are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq is naturally wealthy with significant oil reserves and potential revenue, </p>
<p>therefore reconstruction should be self-sufficient, with cash from OFF </p>
<p>escrow account providing significant pump priming as compared to </p>
<p>Afghanistan or Balkans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has a sound agricultural base (‘fertile crescent’).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Educated and able technical, industrial, and managerial population exists.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although ethnic suppression has occurred there is limited regional inter-</p>
<p>ethnic mixing as compared to Afghanistan and Balkans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>International intervention is not in tandem with ongoing, and in the case of </p>
<p>Afghanistan, prolonged civil war.”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The paper listed likely short-, medium- and long-term post-conflict military tasks:</p>
<p>“Immediate (0 – 6 months):</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Provide external and internal security, law and order to prevent any potential </p>
<p>for inter-ethnic violence, or opportunity for organised crime</p>

<p>paper included the “key judgement” that: “In the worst case, we need to be prepared for </p>
<p>a substantial long-term commitment.” </p>
<p><b>244. </b> The paper listed “sustainability” as one of a number of principles affecting </p>
<p>campaign design. The post-conflict commitment needed to be “planned and agreed </p>
<p>before we embark on military action”. The paper advised that “sustainment beyond </p>
<p>initial SDR [Strategic Defence Review] assumptions” had not yet been factored into </p>
<p>calculations, and that prolonged post-conflict deployment would be a “significant burden </p>
<p>on defence resources”.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> The paper also set out a list of actions required as “precursors” to shape the </p>
<p>necessary conditions for whichever military option was selected. They included </p>
<p>preparations “to support [a] new (post-conflict) regime, politically, militarily and </p>

<p><b>248. </b> The March update from the British Embassy Amman, issued at the beginning of </p>
<p>April, reported a number of demonstrations in Baghdad against recent Israeli incursions </p>
<p>into Palestinian territory.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> The Embassy commented that:</p>
<p>“Iraqis no doubt are willing to demonstrate on this issue to vent anti-Western feeling </p>
<p>and disgust at Israeli action against an Arab state. But they are unlikely to put their </p>
<p>necks on the line by demonstrating out of turn. Support is also tempered by anger </p>
<p>that so much Iraqi money is being given to the Palestinians instead of being used to </p>
<p>address the problems at home …”</p>
<p><b>249. </b> The Embassy reported that there had been rumours Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“threatening to use chemical weapons in Baghdad itself if necessary to quell any </p>
<p>uprising. Stockpiling of food and enough fuel to get to the border is now standard </p>
<p>amongst families in Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>250. </b> In the April update, the Embassy reported “mixed stories” of the mood on the </p>
<p>street in Baghdad: “Some say that Iraqis are used to American threats and simply do </p>
<p>not believe that the regime will ever fall. Others report a freer atmosphere in Baghdad, </p>
<p>encouraged by the possibility of change at the end of the year.”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>251. </b> The May update contained some insights into both social and infrastructure </p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> It highlighted Saddam Hussein’s “scare tactics” over what would happen in </p>
<p>the event of a coalition invasion of Iraq and the possibility of Iraqi and regional instability </p>
<p>thereafter: “This line plays on real fears of the unknown and of religious instability. For all </p>
<p>his faults, Saddam does, for now, mean stability and peace.”</p>
<p><b>252. </b> The May report also included a snapshot of communications infrastructure </p>
<p>in Baghdad: a medical student had reported significant difficulty accessing the </p>
<p>internet, both because of state controls on what could be viewed but also because </p>
<p>of limited server access. Illegal access via satellite to both the internet and </p>
<p>international news (copied onto CD and then sold) was becoming popular but was </p>
<p>both expensive and risky.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> On 6 June, the DIS assessed that, while there were undoubtedly divisions between </p>
<p>Shia and Sunni groups in Iraq, these were not straightforward. The interaction between </p>
<p>tribal allegiance, Arab identity, religious affiliation and political persuasion was highly </p>
<p>complex.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> The relationship between some tribes was characterised by “general </p>
<p>lawlessness and brigandry … and occasional incidents of inter-tribal conflict”, leading </p>
<p>the DIS to question whether the activities of southern tribal insurgents really represented </p>
<p>a political challenge to Saddam Hussein’s regime rather than simply traditional tribal </p>
<p>activity that had always resented central government rule. </p>

<p><b>259. </b> A team from the MOD headed by Lt Gen Pigott visited the US to discuss military </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>260. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, reported the outcome to </p>
<p>No.10 on 2 July: US planners’ assumed mission was “to conduct offensive operations in </p>
<p>Iraq to overthrow the regime, destroy the WMD capability, and reduce the threat to the </p>
<p>Iraqi people, the region and the US”. That was being discussed “in a policy void”: “the </p>
<p>end state to be achieved after conflict has not been defined and the identified military </p>
<p>task currently runs out after the overthrow of the regime”. </p>
<p><b>261.  In early July, Mr Hoon and Mr Straw encouraged Mr Blair to try to influence </b></p>
<p><b>US thinking on post-conflict objectives and the strategic framework for Iraq before </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush was briefed on US military plans in August. </b></p>
<p><b>262. </b> On 2 July, Mr Hoon proposed that Mr Blair convene a “small group of colleagues” </p>
<p>specifically to consider “how best to get the US to address the strategic, as opposed to </p>

<p><b>263. </b> Mr Hoon also recommended that officials from the MOD, FCO and Cabinet Office </p>
<p>“do some more homework urgently” to put Mr Blair in a better position to influence </p>
<p>President Bush and Dr Rice before they were briefed on an updated CENTCOM plan </p>
<p>during August. </p>
<p><b>264. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit advised Mr Hoon on 3 July that Ministers who had not been </p>
<p>exposed to the issues over the previous three months might “run a mile” from the picture </p>
<p>of “a military plan being worked up in a policy vacuum, with no strategic framework” </p>
<p>and “no clearly defined end state”.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> It might be that an Iraq campaign was unlikely to </p>
<p>happen, but that was not certain. If it did happen, the UK might not be able to avoid </p>
<p>being linked to a US military campaign. In those circumstances, it was not responsible </p>
<p>for the UK “to let matters run without greater active engagement designed seriously to </p>
<p>influence US conceptual as well as operational thinking”. The UK needed “some early </p>
<p>careful engagement with the US policy machine, rather than just with the Pentagon”. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr Straw endorsed Mr Hoon’s proposals on 8 July.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> He advised Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“We are all agreed that we must act to remove the threat posed by Iraqi WMD. If </p>
<p>the US decide that to do so requires military action then the UK will want to support </p>
<p>them. But this will be harder for us to do without serious US action to address some </p>
<p>of the lacunae in their plan, notably:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>no strategic concept for the military plan and, in particular, no thought </p>
<p>apparently given to ‘day after’ scenarios. Although other parts of the US </p>
<p>Administration have done some work on such aspects, US military planning </p>
<p>so far has taken place in a vacuum.” </p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Straw added: “Regional states in particular will want assurance that the US has </p>
<p>thought through the ‘day after’ questions before giving even tacit support.” </p>
<p><b>267. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“The key point is how to get through to the Americans that the success of any </p>
<p>military operation against Iraq – and protection of our fundamental interests in the </p>
<p>region – depends on devising in advance a coherent strategy which assesses the </p>
<p>political and economic as well as military implications. They must also understand </p>
<p>that we are serious about our conditions for UK involvement.”</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The question of whether a satisfactory plan for post-conflict Iraq should have been </p>
<p>a condition for UK involvement in military action is addressed later in this Section and in </p>
<p>Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Mr Hoon’s proposal prompted Mr Nye to advise Mr Brown to write to the MOD to </p>

<p>150</p>
<p> That would enable the Government to </p>
<p>assess how much it wished to devote to securing a degree of influence over US policy </p>
<p>and operations, in terms of risk to UK troops, the opportunity cost of withdrawing from </p>
<p>other operations, and the financial cost. </p>

<p>152</p>
<p> It acknowledged </p>
<p>an absence of “detailed knowledge about the significance of particular motivators and </p>
<p>alternative loyalties (eg to tribe versus State) for regime insiders”, but judged that “real </p>
<p>loyalty and support for Saddam Hussein’s regime is confined to the top of the hierarchy”. </p>
<p><b>272. </b> The JIC reported, as had earlier DIS papers, that Ba’ath Party membership was </p>
<p>compulsory for anyone holding an official position and that the “extensive party network </p>
<p>provides all-pervasive oversight of Iraqi society, with representatives in most Iraqi social, </p>
<p>government and military organisations”. While the Sunni officer corps of the Iraqi military </p>
<p>was likely to remain loyal, the Shia rank-and-file was less likely to, and mass desertions </p>
<p>seemed likely.</p>
<p><b>273. </b> On 11 July, Lt Gen Pigott sent a revised version of the SPG paper on UK military </p>
<p>strategic thinking to a limited number of senior MOD addressees.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>274. </b> The only change to the material on post-conflict planning in the June edition of the </p>
<p>paper was the addition of references to the “weakness” of US planning, which needed </p>
<p>“much greater definition”.</p>

<p><b>279.  Mr Jonathan Powell advised Mr Blair to avoid a repeat of the Afghanistan </b></p>
<p><b>experience, where there had been a “scramble” to get post-conflict arrangements </b></p>
<p><b>ready. He advised that post-conflict planning for Iraq needed to start immediately. </b></p>
<p><b>280. </b> In his diaries, Mr Chris Mullin, Chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee </p>
<p>from 2001to 2003, recorded that he raised post-conflict issues with Mr Blair at a meeting </p>
<p>of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) on 17 July.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> Mr Mullin stated that the UK </p>
<p>needed to be thinking about a number of issues, including what Saddam Hussein would </p>
<p>do if cornered, the extent of the collateral damage and “how much help would we get </p>
<p>from the Americans when it came to clearing up afterwards?” </p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Mullin recorded that Mr Blair had replied that those questions needed to be </p>
<p>answered:</p>
<p>“‘… if we can’t answer them we won’t do it.’ He [Mr Blair] added that, contrary to </p>
<p>what most people seemed to believe, the Americans had stayed engaged both in </p>
<p>Kosovo and in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>282. </b> On 19 July, OD Sec issued ‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> The paper, </p>
<p>described in more detail in Section 3.3, reminded Ministers that Mr Blair had discussed </p>
<p>Iraq with President Bush at Crawford in April, where he had said the UK would support </p>
<p>military action to bring about regime change, provided certain conditions were met. </p>
<p><b>283. </b> The paper stated that the considerations and preparations that needed to be </p>
<p>addressed to “fulfil the conditions” set out by Mr Blair included an analysis of whether the </p>
<p>benefits of military action outweighed the risks, including whether a “post-war occupation </p>
<p>of Iraq could lead to a protracted and costly nation-building exercise”. US military plans </p>
<p>were “virtually silent” on that point and Washington could look to the UK to “share a </p>
<p>disproportionate share of the burden”. Further work was needed on what form of government </p>
<p>might replace Saddam Hussein’s regime and the timescale for identifying a successor.</p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr Powell made a similar point in a note for Mr Blair on 19 July, in which he </p>
<p>suggested points to put in writing to President Bush. Those included:</p>
<p>“… we need a plan for the day after. Loya Jirga</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> and peacekeeping in Afghanistan </p>
<p>have worked well but we had to scramble to get them ready in time. We need to be </p>

<p><b>286. </b> The British Embassy reported that Sir Kevin emphasised the need for clarity </p>
<p>on aftermath management and that Mr Wolfowitz, although he endorsed Sir Kevin’s </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>288. </b> On his return, Sir Kevin Tebbit informed No.10 of growing US resolve on aftermath </p>
<p>management and widespread recognition in Washington that the US would remain in </p>
<p>Iraq for several years after military intervention. At the same time, he reported “an air of </p>

<p>168</p>
<p> Mr Watkins reported that US “thinking </p>
<p>about dealing with the aftermath of a successful attack remains sketchy”. </p>
<p><b>296. </b> The three options identified by the MOD, known as Packages 1, 2 and 3, made </p>
<p>no explicit reference to possible post-conflict commitments. They remained the broad </p>
<p>framework for discussions until the end of 2002. </p>
<p><b>297. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“The military are not yet ready to make a recommendation on which if any of the </p>

<p>“it would be helpful for my colleagues in London to have a better feel for the ‘post-conflict’ </p>

<p>173</p>
<p> The experience of Afghanistan had shown:</p>
<p>“… that it is every bit as important to win the peace as it is to win the war. That will </p>
<p>be even truer in Iraq. I would not wish to over state the case, but it is undoubtedly </p>
<p>true that both UK politicians and my military colleagues would like to know what we </p>

<p><b>302.  Mr Blair raised post-conflict issues with President Bush at the end of July.</b></p>

<p><b>Hussein was still fluid.</b></p>
<p><b>304. </b> Mr Blair sent a personal Note to President Bush on 28 July.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> The ‘Note on Iraq’, </p>
<p>which is addressed in detail in Section 3.3, stated that removing Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>the right thing to do, but that establishing a new regime would take time. The US and </p>
<p>UK would need to commit to Iraq for the long term and, without coalition partners, there </p>
<p>was a possibility the unintended consequences of removing Saddam Hussein would </p>
<p>persist beyond the military phase. Part of the message to win round potential partners </p>
<p>might be that regime change must protect Iraq’s territorial integrity and provide security. </p>
<p>That might involve another key military figure, but should lead in time to a democratic </p>
<p>Iraq, governed by the people. Mr Blair would need advice on whether that approach </p>
<p>was feasible, but just swapping one dictator for another seemed inconsistent with US </p>
<p>and UK values.</p>

<p>and that “it was better to be right than to hurry”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>307. </b> The record of Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush on 31 July included a </p>

<p><b>313. </b> Mr Scarlett sent Mr Blair an assessment of the cohesiveness of the Iraqi regime, </p>
<p>in which he stated:</p>
<p>“Conditions inside Iraq are better now than they were immediately before the start </p>
<p>of the Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme in late 1996. OFF rations guarantee that at </p>
<p>least basic needs are met … The ‘winners’ under sanctions are those with a hand in </p>
<p>sanctions-busting trade … The greatest losers under sanctions have been the middle </p>
<p>classes … The poorer, rural communities in the south may have suffered less. </p>
<p>The agricultural economy may actually have benefited from the rise in prices …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>317. </b> On 5 August, at the request of the MOD, the JIC reviewed the likely attitude of </p>
<p>regional states to military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“Most regional governments would be happy to see Saddam’s demise. But  </p>
<p>they would be likely to have profound misgivings about a campaign without a  </p>
<p>well-constructed plan for a new Iraq. All agree that Iraq’s territorial integrity must  </p>
<p>be maintained. But there are differing regional concerns about the place of the  </p>
<p>Kurds and Shia in any new regime, the type of government and its relationship </p>
<p>with the West.”</p>
<p><b>318. </b> After a US attack began, “Iran would probably boost its support for Shia groups </p>
<p>working against Saddam”. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) “would </p>
<p>be likely to work directly to undermine US influence, eg by manipulating Iraqi groups </p>
<p>through propaganda and the selective provision of money and arms, although it would </p>
<p>not provoke anything that would provoke US military retaliation”.</p>
<p><b>319. </b> The JIC concluded that: “The US must continue to convince regional governments </p>
<p>of its determination and ability to remove Saddam quickly and offer credible plans for </p>
<p>the aftermath.”</p>
<p><b>320. </b> The Pigott Group discussed US and UK military planning on 8 August.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> Although </p>
<p>the MOD judged that progress had been made towards “a winning military concept”, </p>
<p>the Group expressed concern at the “absence of a clear strategy for the morning after”.</p>
<p><b>321.  The MOD reported on 12 August that President Bush had authorised </b></p>
<p><b>preparatory military activities.</b></p>
<p><b>322.  The British Embassy Washington described the “day after” as the “most </b></p>

<p><b>323.  Mr Straw warned Secretary Powell of the dangers of introducing democracy </b></p>

<p><b>324. </b> A letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to No.10 on 12 August reported that </p>

<p> Dr Williams </p>
<p>advised that:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he had discussed the position with Mr Blair the </p>
<p>previous day. Mr Straw explained that:</p>
<p>“The key issue for the Prime Minister was whether the US wanted an international </p>
<p>coalition or not. The US could go it alone if they wanted that, they only had to </p>
<p>tell us.”</p>
<p><b>331. </b> Mr Straw’s view was:</p>
<p>“… that the case for an international coalition was overwhelming: first for basing </p>
<p>and access, and then for what happened after getting rid of Saddam. But also, </p>
<p>especially, if things went wrong. In such circumstances the US would need the </p>
<p>international community at the scene of the crime …”</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Commenting on the “day after”, Mr Straw pointed out that Iraq had been an artificial </p>
<p>creation of the UK in 1921. Iraq had “no experience of democracy and democracy could </p>
<p>pull it apart”.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> Secretary Powell commented that: “Some of his colleagues did not want UN </p>
<p>involvement in any shape: it might frustrate their purpose.”</p>
<p><b>334. </b> The record of the discussion was not to be seen by anyone other than  </p>
<p>Sir David Manning and Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> On 30 August, Mr Blair set out his position on Iraq in a note to No.10 officials.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stated that the basic strategy to deal with those arguing against any action should be </p>
<p>to answer their questions and, in doing so, to set Iraq in a bigger context. That included </p>
<p>working on a post-Saddam Hussein Iraqi regime:</p>
<p>“The conundrum is: if it is merely changing Saddam for another military dictator, </p>
<p>that hardly elicits support from the rest of Iraq, especially the Shia majority, and is </p>
<p>in any event, not in line with our principles; on the other hand, if the whole nature </p>
<p>of the regime changes, the Sunni minority in power may be less tempted to fold </p>
<p>and acquiesce in Saddam’s removal. But there are ways through this.”</p>

<p><b>The DFID Iraq programme</b></p>
<p><b>337.  In August 2002, DFID completed a review of its programme in northern Iraq. </b></p>

<p><b>340.  DFID was not involved in cross-Whitehall planning on Iraq until </b></p>
<p><b>September 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>341. </b> During the first half of 2002, DFID involvement in Whitehall discussion of Iraq was </p>
<p>limited to the humanitarian impact of the proposed Goods Review List (GRL), addressed </p>
<p>in more detail in Section 3.2. The GRL was adopted in May 2002 and introduced fast </p>
<p>track procedures for the export to Iraq of all goods other than WMD- and military-related </p>
<p>items of concern.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> DFID did not participate in discussion of post-conflict issues or wider </p>
<p>Iraq strategy. </p>
<p><b>342. </b> On 10 May, DFID officials recommended to Ms Clare Short, International </p>
<p>Development Secretary, that the department review its existing humanitarian programme </p>
<p>for Iraq to inform its strategy for the next three years.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>343. </b> In their advice of 10 May, officials described the purpose of DFID’s existing </p>
<p>(2002/03) programme for Iraq, as being: “to improve the provision of effective </p>
<p>humanitarian support by UN agencies and NGOs for the poor affected by internal and </p>
<p>regional conflict in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Officials explained that there were problems assessing the humanitarian situation </p>
<p>in Iraq: “The GoI’s [Government of Iraq’s] strict censorship policy of key data has </p>
<p>inhibited comprehensive analyses from other [non-UN] sources … UN reports offer the </p>
<p>most reliable means of reaching whatever information is available.” Although DFID had </p>
<p>conducted “informal consultations” with UN agencies, those agencies respected Iraqi </p>
<p>Government conditions on sharing information. </p>
<p><b>345. </b> The paper stated that, despite the shortage of reliable survey evidence assessing </p>
<p>human development in Iraq, there was a consensus in the international development </p>
<p>community that the situation had “deteriorated severely” since 1990. UN/Government </p>
<p>of Iraq joint sectoral surveys showed a “general deterioration” in areas such as health, </p>
<p>nutrition, and child and maternal mortality. UNICEF assessed that, while the food ration </p>
<p>provided under OFF had arrested the rate of decline in the humanitarian situation, it had </p>
<p>not reversed it, and interference by the Iraqi Government meant that the benefits had not </p>
<p>been evenly distributed across Iraq. UNICEF was also concerned that there was a high </p>
<p>level of dependency on the food ration. </p>

<p><b>The UN Oil-for-Food programme </b></p>
<p>The UN Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme was established by resolution 986 in April 1995. </p>
<p>Implementation began in May 1996 after the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding </p>
<p>between the UN and the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>The programme allowed Iraq to export its oil and use a portion of the proceeds to buy </p>
<p>humanitarian supplies.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> Revenue from the oil sales was allocated to different tasks:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>72 percent for humanitarian supplies;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>25 percent for the UN compensation fund for Kuwait;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>2.2 percent for the UN’s OFF administration costs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>0.8 percent for the UN’s Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission </p>
<p>(UNMOVIC). </p>
<p>Funds allocated for humanitarian supplies were used in accordance with a distribution </p>
<p>plan approved by the UN. </p>
<p>The Iraqi Government implemented OFF in central and southern Iraq, with the UN in an </p>
<p>observer role. UN agencies implemented OFF in northern Iraq, either directly or through </p>
<p>contractors and local non-governmental organisations (NGOs). </p>
<p>Nine UN agencies operated in Iraq under the OFF: the Food and Agriculture Organization </p>
<p>(FAO); the UN Settlements Programme (HABITAT); the International Telecommunications </p>
<p>Union (ITU); the UN Development Programme (UNDP); the UN Educational, Scientific </p>
<p>and Cultural Organization (UNESCO); the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF); the UN Office </p>
<p>for Project Services (UNOPS); the World Food Programme (WFP); and the World Health </p>
<p>Organization (WHO). </p>
<p>By 2002, OFF had been expanded to include infrastructure rehabilitation and 24 “sectors”, </p>
<p>including health, electricity, education, water and sanitation, and oil industry parts and </p>
<p>spares.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>The UN published reports on its activities under OFF, both on the UN Office of the Iraq </p>
<p>Programme (UNOIP) website</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> and on individual agency websites.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The UN Secretary-General provided regular reports on the performance of the programme </p>
<p>to the Security Council.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>346. </b> According to the DFID report, the UN Children’s Fund (UNICEF) assessed that </p>
<p>about half of Iraq’s schools were physically unsafe and unfit for teaching, and the UN </p>
<p>Development Programme (UNDP) estimated that around a third of six-year-olds had </p>
<p>no access to basic education. Adult literacy levels were estimated to have fallen from </p>
<p>89 percent in 1985 to 57 percent in 1997, and to have continued to decline thereafter. </p>

<p><b>347. </b> On 1 August, the Cabinet Office reported to Sir David Manning that Ms Short had </p>
<p>agreed proposals to make the DFID bilateral programme in Iraq “more structured”.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also reported that a review of DFID activity in Iraq was under way, but that the focus </p>
<p>of officials’ concern was the need to improve the UK’s understanding of the existing </p>
<p>humanitarian situation in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> The first product of DFID’s review of its Iraq programme, the ‘Northern Iraq </p>
<p>Desktop Review’, was circulated within DFID on 8 August.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> The Inquiry has seen </p>
<p>no evidence that it was copied outside the department. </p>
<p><b>349. </b> The ‘Desktop Review’ drew on a combination of DFID papers and consultations </p>
<p>with UN agencies, NGOs and western European donor countries. It did not take account </p>
<p>of UK military planning. The reviewers commented: “Although we are aware that the … </p>
<p>MOD … is carrying out contingency planning for military action against Iraq, the extent of </p>
<p>this planning is not known.” </p>
<p><b>350. </b> Among their conclusions, the DFID reviewers stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>OFF had significantly improved the humanitarian situation in northern Iraq, but it </p>
<p>could be argued that it “had served to undermine the viability of local economic </p>
<p>initiatives and has been detrimental to coping mechanisms, contributing to a </p>
<p>high degree of vulnerability now and for the foreseeable future”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>60 percent of the population was dependent on the OFF food basket and “highly </p>
<p>vulnerable to external shocks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Many civil servants had resorted to alternative sources of income or left the </p>
<p>country in order to secure a stable income.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Development projects aimed at building livelihoods were “significantly </p>
<p>hampered” by the scale of OFF and its destructive effect on local markets, </p>
<p>particularly in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p><b>351. </b> In her memoir, Ms Short explained that:</p>
<p>“DFID had been involved over many years in supporting efforts to ease Iraqi </p>
<p>suffering. It was easier to work in the north but we had some projects in central Iraq </p>
<p>and were well aware of how bad things were.”</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>352. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir William Patey what assessments the UK Government had </p>
<p>made of the humanitarian situation in Iraq before 2003 and in particular the effect of </p>
<p>sanctions. Sir William explained that the UK had great difficulty in establishing whether </p>

<p>allegations made by Saddam Hussein’s regime that sanctions were damaging the </p>

<p>203</p>
<p> The UK had tried to get the World Health Organization </p>
<p>(WHO) into Iraq to assess the situation, but Saddam Hussein had refused permission. </p>
<p>Sir William judged that:</p>
<p>“... it was in Iraq’s interest not to have a reasonable assessment because, obviously, </p>
<p>if the picture was left to them to tell, they would exploit that picture. So there wasn’t </p>
<p>a good assessment, mainly because UN agencies couldn’t get in to do it, and the </p>
<p>claims that were coming out of Iraq were pretty spurious at best.”</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Military and humanitarian planning began to converge in September, with DFID’s </p>
<p>partial integration into Whitehall’s reorganised Iraq planning machinery. That change was </p>

<p><b>358. </b> A revised version, modified to reflect developments in US thinking on post-Saddam </p>

<p>in <i>War and Decision, </i>the memoir of Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense </p>
<p>for Policy 2001-2005, stated the need to:</p>
<p>“Demonstrate that the US and Coalition partners are prepared to play a sustained </p>
<p>role in providing security, humanitarian assistance, and reconstruction aid in support </p>
<p>of this vision …”</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>359. </b> The document was not shown to the UK until 31 January 2003 (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>360.  The US made a number of organisational changes to implement the goals </b></p>
<p><b>approved by President Bush on 29 August.</b></p>
<p><b>361. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> records that the US took a number of steps to help implement the </p>
<p>goals approved by President Bush on 29 August: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Joint Staff in the Pentagon instructed CENTCOM to start planning to </p>
<p>administer Iraq for an interim period after an invasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Feith enlarged the office in the Pentagon responsible for policy planning in </p>
<p>Iraq in a new Office of Special Plans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Rice established an NSC Executive Steering Group on Iraq, chaired by </p>
<p>Mr Miller, to “jump-start” post-conflict planning across the US government.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inter-agency working groups responsible for energy, diplomacy, global </p>
<p>communications and humanitarian issues were established under the umbrella </p>
<p>of the Executive Steering Group.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>362. </b> The inter-agency Humanitarian Working Group was set up in September.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> It was </p>
<p>headed by Mr Elliot Abrams, NSC Senior Director for Democracy, Human Rights and </p>
<p>International Organizations, and Mr Robin Cleveland, Associate Director of the White </p>
<p>House Office of Management and Budget. Membership included representatives of the </p>
<p>Joint Staff and the Departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Justice and Commerce, </p>
<p>and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). It was USAID’s first formal </p>
<p>involvement in the Iraq planning process. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> The Humanitarian Working Group focused on the response to large-scale </p>
<p>humanitarian contingencies, including the possible use of WMD by Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>It also considered the administration of revenue generated under OFF, liaised with the </p>
<p>international aid community to identify critical civilian infrastructure for a military </p>
<p>“no-strike” list and began to assess the demands of post-war reconstruction. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>364. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> explained that the Working Group’s task was hampered by the </p>
<p>absence of detailed assessments of the state of Iraq’s economy and infrastructure, </p>
<p>and poor integration with other planning: </p>
<p>“The few detailed reports reviewed by the Working Group suggested that sanctions </p>
<p>had significantly limited Iraq’s recovery from the first Gulf War … In light of Iraq’s </p>
<p>substantial oil wealth, however, the scope of expected infrastructure repairs seemed </p>
<p>manageable. The Group assumed that long-term repairs could be undertaken and </p>
<p>funded by the Iraqis.</p>
<p>“With military, political and democratization plans developed out of sight of the </p>
<p>Humanitarian Working Group, its members could consider only in general terms how </p>
<p>reconstruction might help legitimize a new Iraqi state. The Group asked for but never </p>
<p>received a briefing on how public-order requirements would be met … The Defense </p>
<p>Department asserted that it had plans for post-war security well in hand …”</p>
<p><b>365.  The UK Government also made organisational changes. </b></p>
<p><b>366.  Officials began to discuss changes to the Government’s machinery for Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>policy and planning in June 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>367.  Recommendations to improve Whitehall co-ordination at official and </b></p>
<p><b>Ministerial level were put to Mr Blair in mid-September. </b></p>
<p><b>368.  At official level, the cross-Whitehall Ad Hoc Group on Iraq (AHGI) met for </b></p>
<p><b>the first time on 20 September. It became the principal forum for co-ordination </b></p>
<p><b>of planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein or post-conflict Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>369.  Mr Blair put on hold proposals for the creation of a separate Ministerial </b></p>
<p><b>Group.</b></p>
<p><b>370. </b> On 26 June, Mr Webb informed Mr Hoon’s office that MOD officials were </p>
<p>encouraging the Cabinet Office to supplement the Pigott Group with a broader body </p>
<p>involving a wider range of departments with a policy interest in Iraq and the region.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>371. </b> Those ideas began to take shape on 8 August, when Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant </p>
<p>Head (Foreign Affairs) OD Sec, informed Mr McKane that he had spoken to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning about possible changes to Whitehall structures.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> Mr Drummond explained </p>
<p>that one consequence of existing Whitehall mechanisms for discussing Iraq, including </p>
<p>in particular the Pigott Group’s focus on military matters, was that “we are focusing </p>
<p>a lot on military aspects and less on the alliance building, morning after, unintended </p>
<p>consequences etc. Come September there may be a case for a tighter grip from </p>
<p>the Centre.”</p>

<p><b>372. </b> Mr Drummond raised the issue with Sir David Manning again on 30 August.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recalled that Sir David had commented earlier in the summer that it was too soon to </p>
<p>think about management of the unintended consequences of conflict, but that the issue </p>
<p>would probably need to be discussed in the autumn. </p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Drummond enclosed a “skeleton” paper on the subject prepared by a Cabinet </p>
<p>Office junior official and suggested meeting to discuss the paper and Whitehall </p>
<p>machinery for Iraq at the same time. </p>
<p><b>374. </b> The Cabinet Office paper on unintended consequences focused on the  </p>
<p>possible impact of war on UK interests and on countries in the region, rather than </p>
<p>on post-conflict Iraq. </p>
<p><b>375. </b> The FCO produced a more substantial paper on the unintended consequences </p>
<p>of conflict for the region and beyond on 20 September.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> The paper is described later </p>
<p>in this Section.</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Also attached to Mr Drummond’s minute was a “list of headings for future work”  </p>
<p>on unintended consequences, which included: “avoiding fragmentation of a failed </p>
<p>state in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Sir David Manning replied to Mr Drummond: “Let us discuss p[lea]se with Tom </p>
<p>McKane before he goes. We need to do this work: there is a question about timing.”</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Mr McKane sent Sir David Manning a note on possible machinery “for managing </p>
<p>Iraq” on 2 September.</p>
<p>216 </p>
<p>He recalled that he and Sir David had already agreed that, </p>
<p>“following the pattern of Afghanistan”, there should be two groups of officials; an “inner </p>
<p>group” chaired by Sir David (or Mr Desmond Bowen who would shortly be taking over </p>
<p>from Mr McKane as Sir David’s Deputy in OD Sec) and a more junior “wider group”, </p>
<p>chaired by Mr Bowen or Mr Drummond.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> Mr McKane proposed that the inner group “should begin work once you [Sir David </p>
<p>Manning] decide that the time is right”. It would comprise the Chair of the JIC or Chief of </p>
<p>the Assessments Staff, the FCO Middle East Director, the Deputy Chief of the Defence </p>
<p>Staff (Commitments) (DCDS(C)) and/or Mr Ian Lee (MOD Director General Operational </p>
<p>Policy (DG OpPol)), and representatives of all three Intelligence Agencies and the Home </p>
<p>Office. Mr McKane asked whether it should also include the DIS and a No.10 information </p>
<p>specialist. He proposed that the wider group “should meet periodically from now on and, </p>
<p>inter alia, address the issues set out in Jim Drummond’s minute of 30 August”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr McKane wrote that “we also need to consider the composition of a Ministerial </p>
<p>Group”. He recommended the creation of a separate Ad Hoc Sub-Committee of the </p>
<p>Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP), chaired by the Prime Minister, with the </p>
<p>participation of the Foreign and Defence Secretaries and the Intelligence Chiefs. DOP </p>
<p>“could meet less frequently and be the means of formalising decisions”. Mr McKane also </p>
<p>suggested that Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, be invited “to be in attendance at </p>
<p>both these groups, as required” and Mr Robin Cook, the Leader of the House,  </p>
<p>“be invited to attend DOP”.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Sir David Manning put the proposals to Mr Blair on 12 September.</p>
<p>217 </p>
<p>At official </p>
<p>level, Sir David recommended that he or Mr Bowen would chair an inner group, to </p>
<p>include the JIC, FCO, MOD, SIS, Security Service, GCHQ, Home Office and  </p>
<p>Sir David Omand, the Cabinet Office Permanent Secretary. </p>
<p><b>382. </b> A wider group, chaired by OD Sec, would be “tasked as necessary by the inner </p>
<p>group”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> The additional members would include DFID, the Metropolitan Police, the </p>
<p>Treasury, the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and media specialists from No.10 </p>
<p>and the FCO. </p>
<p><b>383. </b> In his advice to Mr Blair, Sir David Manning adjusted Mr McKane’s proposal for a </p>
<p>Ministerial Group. He suggested: </p>
<p>“If we follow the Afghan precedent, we would set up an Ad Hoc Group (perhaps </p>
<p>technically a Sub-Committee of DOP under your chairmanship) to include Jack </p>
<p>[Straw], Geoff [Hoon], CDS [Adm Boyce], C [Sir Richard Dearlove] and No.10. The </p>
<p>idea would be to keep it tight with meetings in the Den. If we move to military action, </p>
<p>we would, of course, need to widen this to include John Prescott [the Deputy Prime </p>
<p>Minister], David Blunkett [the Home Secretary] and perhaps others.</p>
<p>“This leaves the question of what to do about the Attorney. I assume that you would </p>
<p>not want him to attend your Ad Hoc Group except by invitation on specific occasions.”</p>
<p><b>384. </b> Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, was not on Sir David’s </p>
<p>list of recommended participants.</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Blair wrote on Sir David Manning’s advice: “Yes but we can wait before setting </p>
<p>up a key Cabinet Group.”</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>386. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, instructed Sir David Manning: </p>
<p>“to progress official groups and leave Minist[eria]l groups for now”.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>387.  Mr Blair’s decision not to establish a Ministerial Group in September 2002, </b></p>

<p><b>Ministerial consideration, challenge and direction of post-conflict planning and </b></p>
<p><b>preparation. </b></p>
<p><b>388. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether having more stress testing by very senior Ministers </p>
<p>not directly involved with Iraq issues might have helped to highlight some of the </p>
<p>weaknesses in areas such as post-conflict planning, Mr Blair replied: </p>
<p>“… in one sense I would like to say ‘yes’, because it would be in a way an easy </p>
<p>enough concession to make. My frank belief is it would not have made a great deal </p>
<p>of difference, no. The committee meetings that we had, small ‘a’, small ‘h’, ad hoc </p>
<p>meetings, I think there were 28 of them, 14 of which were minuted. I had the right </p>
<p>people there … no-one was saying to me ‘Do it a different way’. I mean, if someone </p>
<p>had I would have listened to it, but I have to say to you in addition when I looked, </p>
<p>for example, at Mrs Thatcher’s War Cabinet, it didn’t have the Chancellor of the </p>
<p>Exchequer on it … you have there the people that you need there.”</p>

<p><b>393. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit set out his views to Mr Hoon on 17 September: </p>
<p>“Mindful of the difficulties (and frustrations) we have experienced in the past in </p>
<p>establishing the right machinery and processes to run crucial politico/military </p>
<p>campaigns, I saw David Manning yesterday to discuss the arrangements which </p>
<p>might be presented to the Prime Minister, designed to help successful delivery of </p>
<p>an Iraq campaign. </p>
<p>“I reminded David of the importance of a small ‘core’ Ministerial team, meeting very </p>
<p>regularly to execute daily business (as distinct from less frequent policy meetings </p>
<p>and Cabinet itself). I outlined the linkage needed with the wider COBR and DOP </p>
<p>machinery that would pull in government departments and agencies as a whole …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>through key Ministers in small groups. The position at present was that the </p>
<p>Prime Minister had decided over the weekend on the following:</p>
<p>“a.  no Ministerial meetings at this stage;</p>
<p> b. </p>
<p>a preference, when they became necessary, for the ‘late Afghan’ model </p>
<p>to apply - ie PM; Defence Secretary; Foreign Secretary; CDS; C; Scarlett; </p>
<p>Attorney General and Alastair Campbell as appropriate;</p>
<p> c. </p>
<p>meanwhile for Restricted COBR meetings to begin on a twice weekly basis </p>
<p>under Manning’s chairmanship;</p>
<p> d. </p>
<p>for a wider DOP Committee of officials to begin work, under Bowen’s </p>
<p>chairmanship, which would be the vehicle for bringing in OGDs [other </p>
<p>government departments] – DFID, Customs etc.”</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>394. </b> Sir Kevin commented: </p>
<p>“This seems satisfactory for the time being, although we shall need to watch to </p>
<p>ensure that (b) does not begin without you being present and that (c) provides the </p>
<p>framework we need to link effectively with the contingency planning in the MOD </p>
<p>(and perhaps to begin to consider tricky issues of wider relevance, eg the effect on </p>
<p>energy prices and oil aftermath management). I should have preferred Bowen to run </p>
<p>a restricted officials forum, given the other pressures on Manning’s time, the need </p>
<p>to begin setting a regular rhythm, and some of the wider issues to be confronted. </p>
<p>But I do not think we can do better for the present.”</p>
<p><b>395. </b> The clearest statement of the composition and remit of the AHGI seen by the </p>
<p>Inquiry is in a letter from Mr Drummond to government departments on 18 September, </p>
<p>in which he stated:</p>
<p>“Desmond Bowen here will be chairing a new committee, known as the Ad Hoc </p>
<p>Group on Iraq (AHGI), which will pull together wider issues (both overseas and </p>
<p>domestic), and some elements of contingency planning. The Group will have to </p>
<p>consider both the inspection route, and the implications if that route failed and </p>
<p>military action follows. I will be Desmond’s alternate with Tom Dodd as secretary. </p>
<p>The Group will comprise representatives of the FCO, MOD, Treasury, Home Office, </p>
<p>DfT [Department for Transport], Intelligence Agencies, Cabinet Office, DTI, DFID </p>
<p>and ACPO [Association of Chief Police Officers]. Other departments will be invited </p>
<p>as and when they have an interest in the agenda. We will be looking to have a fairly </p>
<p>settled membership at Head of Department level or above as much of the work will </p>
<p>need to be conducted in a discreet manner. At this stage we envisage AHGI meeting </p>
<p>on a weekly basis, with the first meeting later this week. Detailed pol/mil [politico-</p>

<p>to the list of participants “to cover environmental aspects”.</p>

<p><b>397. </b> Asked by the Inquiry to explain the Whitehall arrangements, Sir David Manning </p>
<p>said that the restricted group chaired by him or his deputy included “all those who had </p>

<p>226</p>
<p> It was not focused solely on Iraq, and often </p>
<p>had other pressing issues to deal with but:</p>

<p>the Ministry of Defence might be encountering and so on and so forth.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>398. </b> Sir David explained that the AHGI drew in those with less or very little access to </p>
<p>sensitive intelligence.</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Bowen told the Inquiry that, when the AHGI started its work in September 2002, </p>
<p>the context was “a serious policy commitment to deal with weapons of mass destruction </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>on a UN Security Council resolution (see Section 3.5), Sir Michael was setting up a </p>
<p>“strategy group” reporting to Mr Ricketts to ensure FCO work on Iraq was “suitably </p>
<p>dynamic and coherent”. The group would meet weekly; more often if necessary. </p>
<p><b>405. </b> The Inquiry has not seen a final version of that minute and it is not clear whether </p>

<p>FCO PAPER: ‘REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF MILITARY ACTION </p>
<p>AGAINST IRAQ’</p>
<p><b>416. </b> On 29 August, the FCO Economic Adviser for the Middle East and North Africa </p>
<p>produced an assessment of short- and long-term economic consequences of military </p>
<p>action for the region and for Iraq.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> The paper identified a number of priorities for the </p>
<p>UK, including mobilising the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank as </p>
<p>soon as possible to begin building up a picture of Iraq’s economy:</p>
<p>“An enormous task of reconstruction and economic and financial normalisation lies </p>
<p>ahead. For all Iraq’s oil wealth it will take many years before the country can get </p>
<p>back to levels of prosperity seen in the 1990s.</p>
<p>“... [T]here will be a huge job of reforming Iraqi economic policies and institutions: </p>
<p>dismantling Ba’ath Party economic control and corruption and replacing it with </p>
<p>competent, transparent market-orientated management will probably be akin to </p>
<p>dismantling Communist Party control in Central and Eastern Europe. A strategy </p>
<p>for reconstruction and long-term development will have to be worked out.</p>
<p>“... [T]here is a desperate shortage of available information on Iraq’s economy </p>
<p>which will delay assessment of both the financial position and the requirement for </p>
<p>institutional change/technical assistance. Unless serious preparatory work is put </p>
<p>in hand many months before regime change there is likely to be a serious and </p>
<p>politically embarrassing hiatus.” </p>

<p><b>417. </b> The assessment was copied widely within the FCO, including to Mr Chaplin, and to </p>
<p>Trade Partners UK (TPUK). The Inquiry has seen no evidence that it was copied to other </p>
<p>departments.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Creon Butler, the FCO Chief Economist, endorsed the economic adviser’s </p>
<p>analysis and the importance of thinking about economic issues “at the same time” as </p>
<p>military options.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> He advised that: </p>
<p>“… a few $bn spent on a Jordan safety net [to cushion the economic shock of </p>
<p>conflict] and more rapid intervention in Iraq post-conflict is likely to be small beer vis-</p>
<p>a-vis the total costs of military intervention and could do a great deal to ensure the </p>
<p>ultimate success of the exercise.” </p>
<p><b>419. </b> Mr Butler added that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government would need to make special provision for the costs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was important to learn the lessons of post-Milošević Yugoslavia, where a </p>
<p>“first rate” economic team, largely from the Yugoslav diaspora, had made “a </p>
<p>tremendously positive impact” on economic management. Did such people exist </p>
<p>in Iraq’s case?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>International financial institutions (IFIs) were unlikely to sanction any significant </p>
<p>work on Iraq until there was a clear international mandate. If they did not, it could </p>
<p>still make sense for the UK to do work in-house and start a dialogue with the US. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> Mr Butler did not copy his email to Mr Chaplin, Mr Ricketts, or outside the FCO.</p>
<p>TREASURY PAPER: ‘WHAT WOULD BE THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF WAR IN IRAQ?’</p>
<p><b>421. </b> On 6 September, Treasury officials sent Mr Brown a paper on the economic impact </p>
<p>of military action on the global, regional and Iraqi economies.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> The paper addressed </p>
<p>three scenarios: a large-scale invasion leading to relatively quick regime change </p>
<p>(identified as the most likely scenario); regime change through an internal uprising; and </p>
<p>regime change after a prolonged campaign during which WMD had been used. </p>
<p><b>422. </b> The paper assessed that oil prices could rise by $US10 per barrel. Over a year, </p>
<p>that could reduce global growth by 0.5 percent and raise inflation by 0.4-0.8 percent. </p>
<p>Investor and consumer confidence could fall and there was limited room for easing </p>
<p>monetary and fiscal policy across the G7.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>423. </b> In the region, “a small group of countries could lose out quite heavily” as a result of </p>
<p>a range of factors from reduced tourism to disruption of trade with Iraq.</p>

<p><b>424. </b> The paper’s analysis of the impact on Iraq drew on three recent precedents: </p>
<p>the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), Afghanistan and East Timor. The paper </p>
<p>concluded that there were four reasons why reconstruction in Iraq might be “even more </p>
<p>expensive” than in the FRY, which had already cost nearly US$10 billion:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s infrastructure might be in a worse condition.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s economy would need stabilising after years of sanctions, reckless </p>
<p>spending and high inflation, and there was a huge external debt burden.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A large peacekeeping force would be needed to “keep a lid on” ethnic and </p>
<p>religious tensions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should expect “heavy moral pressure” to make a generous contribution </p>
<p>to the reconstruction effort. </p>
<p><b>425. </b> The paper added that, although reconstruction in Iraq might be more expensive </p>
<p>than in the FRY, it might be less challenging: Iraq already had “institutions of </p>
<p>government”, the private sector had not been completely destroyed, and Iraq was </p>
<p>much richer. </p>

<p>SPG PAPER, 4 SEPTEMBER 2002: ‘UK MILITARY STRATEGIC THINKING ON IRAQ’</p>
<p><b>427.  In the 4 September edition of its paper on UK military strategic thinking, </b></p>
<p><b>the SPG stated:</b></p>
<p><b>“Given fractious nature of Iraqi politics, broad regional concern on nature of </b></p>
<p><b>new Iraqi government, and poor state of Iraqi infrastructure, delivery of stated </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict objectives will require lengthy engagement.”</b></p>
<p><b>428.  The SPG also stated that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“lack of clarity in US on post-conflict Iraq means we do not yet have a </b></p>
<p><b>winning concept”; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the “key military question” to be addressed was whether there was a </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>431. </b> In a new list of “key deductions”, the SPG advised:</p>
<p>“Given fractious nature of Iraqi politics, broad regional concern on nature of new </p>
<p>Iraqi government, and poor state of Iraqi infrastructure, delivery of stated post-</p>
<p>conflict objectives will require lengthy engagement.</p>
<p>“Successful post-conflict delivery of US support to a new, broad-based government </p>
<p>will require co-operation and agreement of regional states on acceptability of the </p>
<p>outcome, if its efforts are not to be undermined.” </p>
<p><b>432. </b> The SPG also listed strategic issues needing resolution before there could be a </p>
<p>“winning concept”. They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “likely model for Iraqi governance, security structures, and economy, to </p>
<p>inform estimates of post-conflict engagement”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the likely post-conflict role of the UN. </p>
<p><b>433. </b> In the section on post-conflict tasks, the list of likely short-, medium- and long-term </p>
<p>post-conflict military tasks from earlier versions was replaced with a briefer description </p>
<p>of planning priorities. The SPG stated that US military planners were working on detailed </p>
<p>post-conflict plans, but drawing on very broad assumptions about the nature of the new </p>
<p>regime. The SPG recommended that:</p>
<p>“… clarity and broad agreement on [the] following is needed before coherent plans </p>
<p>can be effectively delivered:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Political.</b> Nature of regime, extent of franchise, land tenure, and relations </p>
<p>with other states.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Economic. </b>Ownership and redevelopment of oil resources and </p>
<p>development of other economic activity.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Security.</b> Security structures and security sector reform (SSR). Purpose, </p>
<p>size and nature of Iraqi Armed Forces and internal security forces.”</p>
<p><b>434. </b> The SPG continued:</p>
<p>“Planning will need to be undertaken with DFID in order to effectively manage </p>
<p>[the] NGO response to humanitarian consequences. Saddam may well use mass </p>
<p>movement of refugees as an operational tool to slow Coalition advance and as part </p>
<p>of a strategic attack on Coalition … domestic public support …</p>
<p>“Without clear post-conflict plans potential scale … of UK military commitment </p>
<p>remains an unknown.” </p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>435. </b> The SPG stated that “lack of clarity in US on post-conflict Iraq means we do not yet </p>
<p>have a winning concept”, but:</p>
<p>“US military planners are fully aware of the need to establish a strategic context and </p>
<p>for an inter-agency approach, and considerable work has been done to address </p>
<p>these concerns. Our analysis and judgements are now based on a sound knowledge </p>
<p>of the CENTCOM plan and recent military developments to which we are privy, and </p>
<p>our assessment of whether to engage or not is (now based on a much surer footing) </p>
<p>predicated on this imperfect basis.</p>
<p>“… The key <b>military</b> question to be addressed is:</p>
<p>‘Is there a winning military concept and plan?’”</p>
<p><b>436. </b> The SPG set out two responses: a list of conditions to be met before the answer </p>
<p>could be “yes” and a list of reasons why the answer should be “no”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The list of conditions for participation included:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>preparation of an acceptable post-conflict administration (US military </p>
<p>planners were reported to have identified the military tasks to be </p>
<p>addressed, but how those would be co-ordinated with other aspects of </p>
<p>nation-building was not yet clear); and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>UK post-conflict tasks to be “limited in scope and time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reasons for not participating in the US plan included the absence of a clear </p>
<p>post-conflict strategy, which would make it likely that the UK military commitment </p>
<p>would become open-ended.</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s commitment to post-conflict reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>437.  Before Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Camp David on </b></p>
<p><b>7 September, Sir Christopher Meyer advised that pacifying Iraq would make </b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan look like “child’s play”. Afghanistan had shown that the US was not </b></p>
<p><b>good at consolidating politically what it had achieved militarily.</b></p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 2 September, a few days before Mr Blair’s visit to Camp David, Mr Rycroft </p>
<p>showed Mr Blair, Mr Powell and Sir David Manning an article by <i>New York Times</i> </p>
<p>columnist Mr Thomas L Friedman about the scale of the post-conflict task.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> In the </p>
<p>article, Mr Friedman commented:</p>
<p>“… we are talking about nation-building from scratch. Iraq has … none of the </p>

<p>“This is not a reason for not taking Saddam out. It is a reason to prepare for a </p>
<p>potentially long, costly nation-building operation and to enlist as many allies as </p>
<p>possible to share the burden.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“My most knowledgeable Iraqi friend tells me he is confident that the morning after </p>
<p>any US invasion, US troops would be welcomed by Iraqis and the regime would fold </p>
<p>quickly. It is the morning after the morning after that we have to be prepared for.</p>
<p>“In the best case, a ‘nice’ strongman will emerge from the Iraq army to preside over </p>
<p>a gradual transition to democracy, with America receding into a supporting role. In </p>
<p>the worst case, Iraq falls apart, with all its historical internal tensions – particularly </p>
<p>between its long-ruling Sunni minority and its long-frustrated Shia majority. In that </p>
<p>case, George W Bush will have to become Iraq’s strongman – the iron fist that holds </p>
<p>the country together, gradually re-distributes the oil wealth and supervises a much </p>
<p>longer transition to democracy.</p>
<p>“My Iraqi friend tells me that anyone who tells you he knows which scenario will </p>
<p>unfold doesn’t know Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer reported on 5 September that the US Government was </p>
<p>considering starting to make the case against Saddam Hussein, including by using </p>
<p>President Bush’s speech at the UN General Assembly to indict him and circulating a </p>
<p>draft resolution the following week.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> Congressional resolutions authorising military </p>
<p>action would be sought in early October.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> On 6 September, Sir Christopher Meyer advised that, while President Bush’s </p>
<p>decision to take the UN route and to consult widely at home and abroad was welcome, </p>
<p>it left “a raft of questions unanswered”.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>441. </b> Sir Christopher judged that a military invasion and its aftermath would be “less </p>
<p>perilous [for the US] in company”. On post-conflict issues, he wrote:</p>
<p>“The preconditions for military action are a focal point for Camp David. So are </p>
<p>post-war Iraq and the MEPP [Middle East Peace Process] … The President seems </p>
<p>to have bought the neo-con notion that with the overthrow of Saddam all will be </p>
<p>sweetness and light in Iraq, with automatic benefits in the rest of the Middle East </p>
<p>(which partly explains his inactivity on the latter). In reality, it will probably make </p>
<p>pacifying Afghanistan look like child’s play. The US is probably in greater need </p>
<p>of coalition and UN support for what is likely to be a very protracted post-war </p>
<p>phase, than for the attack itself. Afghanistan has shown that the US is not good at </p>
<p>consolidating politically what it has achieved militarily.”</p>

<p>factors informing a UK military contribution in Iraq. He cautioned that the assessment </p>
<p>was “necessarily provisional”, partly because the US plan was still evolving, and partly </p>
<p>because there had not yet been “detailed joint planning with the US”.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>445. </b> Mr Watkins described three UK military options (Packages 1 to 3) ranging from </p>
<p>minimum to maximum effort. He also drew attention to the “sketchy” post-conflict plans </p>
<p>and the importance of keeping in mind the US timetable when identifying the contribution </p>
<p>the UK might offer and the influence it was hoped to bring. </p>
<p><b>446. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to Mr Straw’s and Sir Andrew Turnbull’s Private </p>

<p><b>462. </b> On post-conflict commitments the paper stated:</p>
<p>“The likely post-conflict scenarios and demands have yet to be clearly articulated. </p>
<p>Scenarios include immediate and catastrophic regime collapse, the mounting of an </p>
<p>internal coup as the campaign commences, or at the opposite end of the spectrum </p>
<p>an exhausted Iraq suing for peace. Each of these will require a different response. </p>
<p>The infant US inter-agency process has just started to identify the means by which </p>
<p>transition to a post-Saddam regime might take place. This commences with a </p>
<p>CENTCOM-led military government.”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> In the section headed “Conflict vs Post-conflict”, the SPG asked whether, if UK </p>
<p>forces were to participate in the military campaign, “our effort should be against the need </p>
<p>to meet US short-term planning for combat, or the equally demanding and pressing need </p>
<p>for preparations for the post-conflict phase”. It continued:</p>
<p>“Conflict phase. Commitment to this phase may carry with it inherent risks with </p>
<p>regard to post-conflict engagement with little choice on role, timing, location, or </p>
<p>future extraction. An alternative approach that offers a UK lead, or UK participation in </p>
<p>the post-conflict phase may be equally attractive to the US as our commitment to a </p>
<p>land role in the conflict phase.</p>
<p>“Post-Conflict. Given the wide range of possible post-conflict scenarios these forces </p>
<p>would have to be combat capable forces at high readiness, and in all probability </p>
<p>with key elements forward deployed during the conflict phase. The length and scale </p>
<p>of our post-conflict commitment will determine our ability to fulfil a range of other </p>
<p>operations, and most notably our Balkan commitment. An enduring medium scale</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p>commitment in Iraq would preclude continued medium scale engagement in  </p>
<p>the Balkans.</p>
<p>“Strategic Balance. We are currently committed to two medium scale land operations </p>
<p>(FRESCO</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> and the Balkans), and a land commitment to Iraq at anything above </p>
<p>small scale</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> will commit us to <b>three medium scale</b> land operations. Although with </p>
<p>a full Package 3</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> commitment to the conflict phase we retain the SLE [Spearhead </p>
<p>Land Element], our ability to deploy and sustain even a small scale force package </p>
<p>has yet to be determined, and anything above this Scale of Effort will be impossible </p>
<p>… Recovery and recuperation will also be key to our judgements as to which phase </p>
<p>to commit to. Hard and fast judgements are not possible, however, commitment of </p>
<p>Package 3 will have an effect for at least two years.”</p>

<p>Defined in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review as “deployments of brigade size or equivalent” for war-</p>

<p><b>464. </b> The SPG concluded: </p>
<p>“<b>Assuming that UK land participation is a requirement, there is a judgement </b></p>
<p><b>to be made on whether we should be engaged in the conflict or post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>phases. Both would be difficult to sustain</b>.”</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Lt Gen Pigott and Lieutenant General John Reith, Chief of Joint Operations (CJO), </p>
<p>briefed the Chiefs of Staff Committee on the options available, explaining that “Package 4  </p>
<p>was being developed to address the inevitable post-conflict tasks”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> Adm Boyce </p>
<p>commented that it was “inconceivable that the UK would not contribute in some manner, </p>
<p>to those tasks”.</p>

<p>and discussions involving No.10 and Mr Blair are covered in more detail in Section 6.1.</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Post-conflict military operations were not addressed in Mr Watkins’ letter of  </p>
<p>20 September to Sir David Manning on the potential UK contribution to military action.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Nor do they appear in the record of the discussion between Mr Blair and Mr Hoon </p>
<p>on 23 September, at which it was decided that land forces, while not being ruled out </p>
<p>altogether, should not be put forward as part of the potential UK contribution at the </p>
<p>CENTCOM planning conference later that week (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>256</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>469. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed Iraq planning on 25 September.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> They recognised </p>
<p>that the post-conflict phase of military operations (Phase IV) “would not have a clear-cut </p>
<p>start” and that the UK should “guard against any accusation that the ‘US does the  </p>
<p>war-fighting while the UK does the peacekeeping’”. Not being involved in Package 3 </p>
<p>at all “would be difficult to manage”.</p>
<p><b>470. </b> The Chiefs of Staff commissioned Lt Gen Pigott to: “Explore options for potential </p>

<p><b>473.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 23 September that the international community had </b></p>
<p><b>to be committed to Iraq’s reconstruction.</b></p>
<p><b>474. </b> Cabinet met on 23 September (see Section 3.5). Points made in discussion </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>“… in the event of military action, a clear vision was required of the outcome we </p>
<p>wanted in reconstructing Iraq: this would be a major task”.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>475. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that a “crunch point” had been reached:</p>
<p>“The sanctions regime … was being eroded and Saddam Hussein was on the way to </p>
<p>acquiring new capability in weapons of mass destruction. Iraq had to comply with the </p>
<p>obligations placed on it by the United Nations. A tough line was required. If military </p>
<p>action was required, the job could be done. There would be a discussion about the </p>
<p>military options … civilian casualties should be kept to a minimum, but there could </p>
<p>be no doubt that the main beneficiaries of the removal of Saddam Hussein would be </p>
<p>the Iraqi people. Iraq was basically a wealthy country. The international community </p>
<p>had to be committed to Iraq’s reconstruction.” </p>
<p><b>476. </b> Mr Cook wrote in his memoir that he closed his contribution:</p>
<p>“... by stressing the vital importance of getting approval for anything we do through </p>
<p>the UN. ‘What follows after Saddam will be the mother of all nation-building </p>
<p>projects. We shouldn’t attempt it on our own – if we want the rest of the international </p>
<p>community with us at the end, we need them in at the start.’”</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Brown had made “a few long-term points </p>
<p>for the US, the need to think through post-Saddam, the importance of the MEPP”.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>478. </b> Late on 23 September, Mr Brenton reported that the US Administration was </p>
<p>“starting to get to grips with ‘Day After’ questions – in [the] State [Department]’s case, </p>
<p>with considerable trepidation”.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> A senior State Department official had suggested that </p>
<p>anything other than an Iraqi General succeeding Saddam Hussein would be extremely </p>
<p>challenging and involve the US in a massive presence for an indefinite period.</p>
<p><b>479.  Parliament was recalled to discuss Iraq on 24 September. There was </b></p>
<p><b>considerable concern in both Houses about arrangements to support Iraq after  </b></p>

<p><b>481. </b> Parliament was recalled to discuss Iraq on 24 September (see Section 3.5). </p>
<p><b>482. </b> In his statement to the House of Commons, Mr Blair drew attention to the UK’s </p>
<p>continuing commitment to Afghanistan:</p>
<p>“Afghanistan is a country now freed from the Taliban but still suffering. This is a </p>
<p>regime we changed, rightly. I want to make it clear, once again, that we are entirely </p>
<p>committed to its reconstruction. We will not desert the Afghan people. We will stick </p>
<p>with them until the job of reconstruction is done.”</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>483. </b> During the adjournment debate that followed, Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of </p>
<p>the Liberal Democrats, observed that:</p>
<p>“In his statement, the Prime Minister spoke about the need for Iraq to be led by </p>
<p>someone who variously can abide by international law, bring Iraq back into the </p>
<p>international community, make the country rich and successful, and make its </p>
<p>government more representative of the country. However, he was silent on the </p>
<p>question of who or where that person or set of people is. The Prime Minister, quite </p>
<p>rightly, with our support and that of others, was able to point to the mobilisation </p>
<p>of forces in Afghanistan, which could lead to an alternative, more acceptable </p>
<p>government there. Is there capacity or potential for a similar mobilisation to take </p>
<p>place within Iraq?</p>
<p>“In the context of Afghanistan, the Prime Minister made it clear that, if such a </p>
<p>course of action proved successful – which it did – the country and the international </p>
<p>community would not walk away. Is a similar approach being identified for </p>
<p>Iraq? Does such an approach encompass the mindset of the present American </p>
<p>Administration? If we were not to walk away following the toppling of Saddam, who </p>
<p>would provide the necessary presence to police and create the ongoing stability in </p>
<p>Iraq that would be essential because of the shell-shocked nature of that country?</p>
<p>“When the American Defense Secretary speaks of a ‘decapitation strategy’ with a </p>
<p>view to Iraq does he reflect the mind processes of the British Government? Should </p>
<p>we not instead be talking about the longer-term need for a rehabilitation strategy </p>
<p>for Iraq, not least for its innocent, oppressed people with whom none of us has any </p>
<p>argument whatever?”</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>

<p>regime change in Iraq they will not walk away from that either. I simply emphasise </p>
<p>this point. Of course all sorts of issues will have to be resolved, but the fact is, as I </p>
<p>said a few weeks ago, that the first decision we must make is this: do we allow the </p>
<p>situation to continue, with this weapons of mass destruction programme?”</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>485. </b> In response to a question from Mr Jon Owen Jones (Labour) about what threats </p>
<p>would ensue if the Iraqi regime were replaced by force of arms, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“Although some of these questions – if we get to the stage of regime change,  </p>
<p>what replaces Saddam – do not arise for decision now, as I have said throughout  </p>
<p>I of course agree that they are very serious questions, which we need to look at.  </p>
<p>The only thing that I would say to my honourable Friend about regime change is  </p>
<p>that it is hard to think of an Iraqi regime that would be worse than Saddam, but that </p>
<p>said, it is obviously important that we deal with all these issues, including making it </p>
<p>quite clear to the people of Iraq that should it come to the point of regime change, </p>
<p>that has to be done while protecting the territorial integrity of Iraq. That is an </p>
<p>important point.”</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>486. </b> Mr Bruce George (Labour) proposed a number of criteria to be satisfied before any </p>
<p>decision was taken on whether to go to war, including: “a credible military strategy with </p>
<p>considerable thought given to what the consequences would be if war were undertaken </p>
<p>and strong consideration given to post-operation peace support”.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>487. </b> Ms Glenda Jackson (Labour) and Mr Doug Henderson (Labour) both warned that, </p>
<p>although the US and UK were certain to win a war in Iraq, there was no such certainty </p>
<p>about who would win the peace. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> Ms Jackson asked whether the UK was ready to commit itself to “a massive </p>
<p>commitment of money, materials and personnel to bring about change”.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>489. </b> Mr Henderson warned: “If we do not start with a coalition of public support, it will be </p>
<p>impossible to build any stable society in Iraq and neighbouring countries afterwards.”</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>490. </b> Several speakers raised post-conflict issues in the House of Lords. </p>
<p><b>491. </b> Lord Strathclyde (Conservative), in expressing support for the Government’s </p>

<p>“What vision do the Government have of a post-Saddam Iraq, which is surely in itself </p>
<p>the most important question for those who want regime change?”</p>

<p>194</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Baroness Williams (Liberal Democrat), spoke of “facing up to the necessity of force </p>
<p>should that prove inevitable”, but expressed:</p>
<p>“… grave concerns about the exit strategy that was followed in Afghanistan, a </p>
<p>country that appears to be sliding back to anarchy rather rapidly … In some ways </p>
<p>Afghanistan represents a failure of the international community to build upon </p>
<p>the military victory that it claimed would open the door to a democratic and just </p>
<p>Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What assurance could be given that the UK and US would “turn their minds more </p>
<p>seriously to the matter of the exit strategy and what follows victory”? Without that, it </p>
<p>remained unclear what the strategy was or how to ensure it “will not enrage and unite </p>
<p>the Muslim world against us”. </p>
<p><b>493. </b> Baroness Symons, joint FCO/DTI Minister of State for International Trade and </p>
<p>Investment, set out the Government’s position:</p>
<p>“Many will ask what will happen next if there is armed intervention. How will it be </p>
<p>done? When and how would those undertaking such action withdraw from Iraq? </p>
<p>What is the exit strategy? The truth is that discussion of those questions in detail </p>
<p>is not for today.”</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>494. </b> Lord Howell (Conservative), expressing full support for Mr Blair’s approach on  </p>
<p>Iraq, asked:</p>
<p>“What will happen later? Do we have a vision – I do – of a federal, democratic </p>
<p>Iraq … Is there a possibility of a benign Iraq; a force for stability in the Middle </p>
<p>East, instead of a force for evil and the culture of death? Is that wider vision in </p>
<p>the Government’s mind? We have not heard much about that, but it is important </p>
<p>we should have such a wider vision. If we do, how is it to be secured? Should US </p>
<p>troops, thousands of whom are already in the region, stay there for a long time and </p>
<p>occupy the whole area? Are they ready to go into other areas that might be at risk?</p>
<p>“Those questions hang in the air. We must have from the Government some </p>
<p>indication of where we are going. As Clausewitz said, you should not take the first </p>
<p>step … towards war unless you have thought about the last step as well.”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>495. </b> Lord Hurd (Conservative), warned of the scale of the reconstruction task: </p>
<p>“We must not delude ourselves. The process of nation rebuilding in Iraq will be </p>
<p>a slow and strenuous one. We have to consider – it will be difficult; it will be the </p>

<p><b>497.  From 20 September 2002, the Cabinet Office-chaired Ad Hoc Group on Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>(AHGI) co-ordinated all non-military cross-government work on post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>issues. </b></p>
<p><b>498.  The AHGI was not tasked to consider in detail the operational requirements </b></p>
<p><b>for humanitarian relief or wider reconstruction.</b></p>
<p><b>499.  Nor was it required to examine systematically the different policy options </b></p>
<p><b>for post-conflict Iraq, the UK’s potential involvement in different scenarios or the </b></p>
<p><b>associated risks.</b></p>
<p><b>500.  The focus of the AHGI’s work during autumn 2002 was a series of analytical </b></p>
<p><b>papers by the FCO and other departments on the post-conflict administration and </b></p>
<p><b>reconstruction of Iraq, and the possible consequences of conflict for the UK. </b></p>
<p><b>501.  There was some visibility between military and civilian post-conflict analysis, </b></p>
<p><b>but the two strands of work remained largely separate until the creation of the IPU </b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>513. </b> The introduction to the paper on international consequences stated:</p>
<p>“This paper identifies some of the possible impacts of war with Iraq on the immediate </p>
<p>region and beyond over the short term. One of the aims is to identify the unintended </p>
<p>consequences which could easily produce problems (cf the displacement of the </p>
<p>Kurds in 1991). <b>The intention is not to predict catastrophe. But by preparing for </b></p>
<p><b>the worst, we should be better placed to avoid it.</b>”</p>
<p><b>514. </b> The FCO suggested that much would depend on the nature of the military </p>
<p>campaign, but that it was possible to identify certain risks:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Humanitarian emergency in Iraq”. This was possible unless the war ended </p>
<p>quickly. The UK would be expected to play a major role in any international </p>
<p>response. That response would need military support and to be co-ordinated </p>
<p>with the military campaign. That would be difficult, with the US military unlikely to </p>
<p>want humanitarian agencies on the ground complicating things.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Refugee Crisis”. This might result from a prolonged or inconclusive conflict </p>
<p>during which the Iraqi regime targeted parts of the population. Meeting refugees’ </p>
<p>needs would be a significant challenge and potentially destabilising for some </p>
<p>of Iraq’s neighbours. Senior Ba’athists would probably try to blend in with other </p>
<p>refugees. There might need to be “some sort of screening process to identify </p>
<p>those we would wish to interrogate and possibly bring criminal charges against”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Demonstrations, riots and political stability”. Military action would heighten </p>
<p>anti-Western feeling in the region. That could pose a threat to British nationals </p>
<p>or interests and destabilise governments in the region. Much would depend on </p>
<p>whether there was UN support and which countries joined the Coalition.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Terrorist attacks”. With the US and others distracted, war in Iraq might create an </p>
<p>easier environment for terrorists to operate in and would create a new incentive </p>
<p>for them to act. UK Embassies and other interests might be attractive targets.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Environmental”. Depending on Saddam Hussein’s actions, a major </p>
<p>environmental clean-up might be needed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Non-related but potentially linked crises”. With attention focused on Iraq, other </p>
<p>crises “could easily flare up”. Afghanistan and India/Pakistan were the main </p>
<p>concerns. Russia might “increase suppression of the Chechens” or “turn the </p>
<p>heat up on Georgia”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Economic”. Oil prices would rise; stock markets would fall. Both should be </p>
<p>short-term, but could be longer lasting. War would also be expensive. Germany, </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and Japan had been major players in 1991.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> Would they be </p>
<p>again? There were also potentially significant costs linked to reconstruction and </p>
<p>Iraqi debt.</p>
<p>284 </p>
<p>Germany, Saudi Arabia, Japan and other countries made significant financial contributions to military </p>
<p>operations in the 1991 Gulf Conflict.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Two “problem multipliers” could make the situation worse: use of WMD by Iraq </p>
<p>and an attack on Israel.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> A month later, on 24 October, Sir David Manning asked Ms Anna Wechsberg, </p>
<p>No.10 Private Secretary: “I have failed to do anything with this. Should I?”</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>516. </b> On 1 November, she replied that there was probably nothing in the paper that </p>
<p>would be new to him and that the AHGI had taken it into account in their work.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> </p>

<p>circulated to the AHGI. It is not clear whether it was seen by Sir David. </p>
<p>FCO PAPER: ‘SCENARIOS FOR THE FUTURE OF IRAQ AFTER SADDAM’</p>
<p><b>518.  ‘Scenarios for the future of Iraq after Saddam’, the second FCO paper for the </b></p>
<p><b>AHGI, listed scenarios under which Saddam Hussein might lose power, the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>four “overarching priorities” for Iraq, and how those priorities might be achieved.</b></p>
<p><b>519.  The FCO recognised that the US would have the decisive voice in any </b></p>
<p><b>externally-driven regime change, but concluded that the UK should be able to </b></p>
<p><b>exert influence through its close relationship with the US, activity in the UN and </b></p>
<p><b>its likely role in any military campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>520.  The FCO concluded that the UK should:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>argue strongly for Iraq to remain a unitary state;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>avoid the root and branch dismantling of Iraq’s governmental and security </b></p>
<p><b>structures;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>argue for political reform, but not necessarily full democracy in the short </b></p>
<p><b>term; </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>aim for a political outcome to emerge from within Iraq;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>recognise the likely need for an interim administration and an international </b></p>
<p><b>security force.</b></p>
<p><b>521. </b> On 12 September, Sir David Manning had commissioned a paper from the FCO on </p>
<p>what a post-Saddam Hussein government might look like: </p>
<p>“If … there is military action … what sort of government structures should we try to </p>
<p>construct? What should the relationship be between Baghdad and the regions …? </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>522. </b> The following day Mr Chaplin set out his views in a note to Mr Gray:</p>
<p>“In the aftermath of military action … we would have a particular responsibility to </p>
<p>help hold the ring while a new government emerged … eg facilitating humanitarian </p>
<p>relief, assuring minimum functioning of utilities and so on. But … unless the military </p>
<p>campaign has been extremely destructive, civilian ministries should be able to </p>
<p>resume work fairly quickly.</p>
<p>“… The job of the Coalition will then be to ensure stability, to allow a nation-building </p>
<p>process of eg: a representative assembly; appointment of a provisional government; </p>
<p>drawing up a new constitution; elections; formation of a new government.</p>
<p>“This process could take 6 to 9 months. Apart from providing security and </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance, we may be in the business of providing technical help </p>
<p>(eg reconstruction planning; constitution drafting). We will also have a role in </p>
<p>preventing interference from neighbours, especially Iran.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>523. </b> Mr Richard Stagg, FCO Director Public Diplomacy, raised with Mr Chaplin his </p>
<p>“concern about the need to have greater clarity about our long-term vision for the Middle </p>
<p>East post-Saddam, if we are to convince people that military conflict is the best available </p>
<p>approach”.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>524. </b> Mr Stagg advised:</p>
<p>“We will make little or no headway with Arab opinion if our apparent goal is to install </p>
<p>a pro-US puppet regime in Baghdad. We need an outcome which is not a victory </p>
<p>for the US … but a victory for the region – by delivering benefits across the board in </p>
<p>terms of stability and prosperity. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I am not suggesting that we should be in a position now to say which individuals or </p>
<p>parties will rule Iraq after Saddam, nor on what basis. But I think it would be helpful </p>
<p>to have considerably greater clarity about:</p>
<p>(a)  how we will go about establishing a future government in Iraq;</p>
<p>(b)  how we will manage problems flowing from a more democratic system …;</p>
<p>(c)   what sort of international presence we expect to remain in Iraq after a </p>
<p>conflict (is there any chance of giving a major role to the UN?);</p>
<p>(d)  what does this all mean for neighbouring countries …;</p>
<p>(e)  who will control, and benefit from, Iraq’s oil wealth;</p>

<p><b>525. </b> The FCO paper ‘Scenarios for the future of Iraq after Saddam’ was sent to No.10 </p>
<p>on 26 September.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> It was circulated separately to the AHGI.</p>
<p><b>526. </b> The covering letter explained that FCO officials had discussed some of the issues </p>
<p>covered in the paper briefly with US officials earlier that day.</p>
<p><b>527. </b> The paper, written by DSI and Research Analysts, addressed three themes: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>scenarios under which Saddam Hussein might lose power; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s four “overarching priorities” for Iraq; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how those priorities might be achieved.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>528. </b> The potential scenarios listed for Saddam Hussein’s departure were: assassination </p>
<p>by a member of his inner circle; resignation; military coup; popular insurgency; and </p>
<p>externally-driven regime change. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> The paper stated that popular uprisings were most likely “during or in the aftermath </p>
<p>of any military campaign”, when the situation would be most fluid and “after regular army </p>
<p>units had been fragmented”. Uprisings were unlikely to be successful “unless Saddam’s </p>
<p>military structures had collapsed and/or they received significant external assistance”. </p>
<p>If they did succeed, “the outcome would probably be chaos”. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> The FCO judged that Iraq’s neighbours might find it difficult not to get sucked </p>
<p>in and included an explicit reference to Iran as the neighbour most likely to become </p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p><b>531. </b> In the section on externally-driven regime change, the FCO reiterated that popular </p>
<p>uprisings were one of the possible consequences of Coalition forces entering Baghdad </p>
<p>and ejecting Saddam Hussein. If that happened and external rather than internal factors </p>
<p>were the trigger, “the Coalition should have far more influence in shaping events. </p>
<p>It would have large numbers of forces in many sensitive areas” and the local population </p>
<p>would “probably be relatively passive”. </p>
<p><b>532. </b> The FCO stated that in each scenario, much would lie outside the UK’s control:</p>
<p>“In most circumstances, the decisive voice would be that of the US. But we should </p>
<p>be able to influence developments, through our close relationship with the US, </p>
<p>our diplomatic activity in the UN and elsewhere and our likely role in any military </p>
<p>campaign.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>533. </b> The UK would need “the clearest possible sense of our objectives for Iraq”. The </p>
<p>UK’s “fundamental interest in a stable region providing secure supplies of oil to world </p>
<p>markets” suggested four overarching priorities:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>termination of Iraq’s WMD programme and permanent removal of the threat it </p>
<p>posed; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more inclusive and effective Iraqi government; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a viable Iraq which was not a threat to its neighbours; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an end to Iraqi support for international terrorism.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> The FCO advised:</p>
<p>“We have stated that regime change is not one of our objectives. But once ground-</p>
<p>war started it would rapidly become an almost inevitable outcome. The US would not </p>
<p>settle again for a 1991-style solution. The question then arises of what constitutes </p>
<p>the regime. It would certainly mean the removal of the whole of Saddam’s family </p>
<p>and inner circle.</p>
<p>“It is less clear how much of any remaining military and governmental structures we </p>
<p>would want to see dismantled. This apparatus has facilitated much of what Saddam </p>
<p>has done. His influence permeates the system. But removing it entirely would mean </p>
<p>the removal of most of the structures of authority in Iraq. This could inhibit political </p>
<p>and economic reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>535. </b> The FCO stated that it was difficult to judge the extent to which government </p>
<p>structures would survive Saddam Hussein’s departure, but concluded:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The national Ba’ath superstructure would almost certainly collapse if Saddam </p>
<p>fell as a result of military action, with the leadership seeking refuge. At lower </p>
<p>levels, Ba’ath structures might continue …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Local power lay with the Ba’ath Party leadership. The limited supporting </p>
<p>bureaucracy was unlikely to be able to take on a more extensive role “without a </p>
<p>radical overhaul”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein fell, particularly after US-led military action, “tribal, regional </p>
<p>and religious differences would probably come to the fore” in the army, causing </p>
<p>splits within and between units. It was more likely that tribal leaders would seek </p>
<p>to establish their own power bases than that the armed forces and security </p>
<p>services would transfer their allegiance en masse to any new government.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not clear whether there would be any enthusiasm for clerical rule or </p>
<p>whether religion would be an effective rallying point for any post-Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein administration.</p>

<p>203</p>
<p><b>536. </b> On the scope of representative government, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“Some Americans have openly stated they want to see the establishment of </p>
<p>democracy. We have avoided this position, because it is an unrealistic ambition in </p>
<p>the short term.”</p>
<p><b>537. </b> Even if democracy were not a short-term option, presentationally it would be </p>
<p>important for the international community to show that intervention was leading to better </p>
<p>government. Difficult issues included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had no successful experience of representative or democratic government.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A democratic Iraq would not necessarily be pro-Western.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Sunni minority would probably feel threatened by a more representative </p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>External opposition was weak and probably lacked sufficient legitimacy in Iraq </p>
<p>to be credible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>None of Iraq’s neighbours would be keen to see a democratic Iraq.</p>
<p><b>538. </b> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“To the extent possible, the Iraqis themselves should have the primary role in </p>
<p>determining their future government and external intervention should appear to </p>
<p>come from within the Arab world or the UN – perhaps through an international </p>
<p>conference (but the Afghanistan model is not necessarily relevant).”</p>
<p><b>539. </b> Because of the likely delay in putting in place longer term arrangements, the </p>
<p>international community was likely to need to establish and provide staff for an interim </p>
<p>administration:</p>
<p>“This would need to be set up quickly and on a large scale. It would maintain stability </p>
<p>and provide basic services such as food rationing. It should probably have a UN </p>
<p>mandate and would need strong support and participation from Arab countries. </p>
<p>There are various models which could be adopted or drawn on, including the </p>
<p>transitional administrations in Afghanistan, Cambodia, East Timor and Kosovo. </p>
<p>We should start exploring what would be appropriate in the Iraqi context.”</p>
<p><b>540. </b> The FCO concluded that, in order to achieve its overarching priorities, the UK </p>
<p>should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>argue strongly for Iraq to remain a unitary state;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“if possible avoid the root and branch dismantling of Iraq’s governmental and </p>
<p>security structures”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accept that the political situation after Saddam Hussein’s departure would </p>
<p>“almost certainly be messy and unstable”, that a new government “will possibly </p>
<p>be military” and that “we should argue for political reform, but not necessarily full </p>
<p>democracy in the short term”; </p>

<p><b>541.  The AHGI concluded that the FCO paper on scenarios for Iraq after Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein needed to be more ambitious.</b></p>
<p><b>542.  Mr Jonathan Powell described it as “fairly useless”. He advocated a  </b></p>
<p><b>UN administration in waiting followed by “some sort of democratic choice”  </b></p>
<p><b>and highlighted the importance of finding a way to stop the “terrible bloodletting </b></p>
<p><b>of revenge”.</b></p>

<p><b>549. </b> On 28 September, the British Embassy Washington updated London on initial </p>
<p>US thinking on the post-conflict administration of Iraq.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> The latest NSC view was </p>
<p>that an initial military governorate should be succeeded by a civilian administration, </p>
<p>with the gradual draw down of the military presence ahead of the transfer of authority </p>
<p>to an Iraqi government. The size of the military footprint, economic governance, </p>
<p>oil and humanitarian and reconstruction needs were among issues yet to be </p>
<p>properly addressed.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Sir David Manning drew on the comments from Mr Powell and the Washington </p>
<p>Embassy in his response to the FCO paper on scenarios for the future of Iraq on  </p>
<p>29 September.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> He asked for more detailed advice on which were the most  </p>
<p>plausible of the possible models for a post-Saddam Hussein administration. With the  </p>
<p>US reported to be proposing a military governorate, the most immediate question was </p>
<p>where the UN would fit in. In particular, what scope was there for preparing the blueprint </p>
<p>for a UN administration-in-waiting drawing on currently exiled technocrats. Being very </p>
<p>careful not to draw false analogies with Afghanistan, should a UN administration set </p>
<p>out an early timetable promising democratic consultation on the Loya Jirga model, </p>
<p>or would this risk chaos?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>551.  The MOD raised with the FCO the need to consider how assumptions </b></p>

<p>should include more detail on de-Ba’athification, how an international security force </p>
<p>might be put together and how large it would need to be. Mr Lee also requested the </p>
<p>inclusion of questions and assumptions that would make clear “the speculative nature </p>
<p>of the current state of thinking”. Those might include: whether the UN Security Council </p>
<p>would supervise reconstruction if the US acted unilaterally; the role of neighbours, </p>
<p>Russia, France and international bodies other than the UN; and whether it was possible </p>
<p>to “determine criteria for UK military involvement”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Mr Johnson set out the MOD’s views in a letter to Mr Gray on 2 October.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recommended that the FCO paper be clear about:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The circumstances in which the UK might seek to establish democracy or set up </p>
<p>“some kind of authoritarian regime” in Iraq. The UK’s public position should “not </p>
<p>raise expectations that we may subsequently disappoint”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How much of Iraq’s bureaucracy was “either redeemable or necessary”. In </p>
<p>the paper the FCO argued against root-and-branch dismantling of a system </p>
<p>permeated by the Ba’ath Party, but also suggested that much of the Party </p>
<p>would collapse anyway. “The key issue is surely the extent to which the existing </p>
<p>bureaucratic structure will need to be retained (and no doubt re-educated) in </p>
<p>order for the country to be governable in practice.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The different options for an interim government. The paper needed to distinguish </p>
<p>between the situation following military action explicitly authorised by the UN </p>
<p>and that following what might be called “US unilateral action”. In the latter </p>
<p>case, was it still safe to assume the UN would take on the role of supervising </p>
<p>reconstruction?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The locus and role of other Permanent Members of the UN Security Council and </p>
<p>neighbouring states.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The potential role of multilateral institutions and states in reconstruction and </p>
<p>security provision. For the UK, “a long-term commitment significantly over and </p>
<p>above the forces currently in theatre, particularly following on from a war-fighting </p>
<p>campaign, would have serious consequences for our ability to respond to other </p>
<p>contingencies, or even perhaps our ability to sustain current tasks”.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Mr Johnson commented that, although many of those questions might not be easy </p>
<p>to answer at that stage, they needed to be raised, as did the issue of “whether and how </p>
<p>an assumption about UK post-conflict involvement might feed back into our decision-</p>
<p>making about our contribution to conflict (if it comes to that)”. </p>
<p><b>557. </b> Mr Johnson added that the DoD had expressed an interest in the subject. Mr Webb </p>
<p>was planning to send a copy of the next version of the paper to Mr Feith.</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Some of the MOD’s suggestions were picked up in the next FCO paper, on models </p>
<p>for administering Iraq, described later in this Section.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>559. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer questioned whether the paper was right to classify the </p>
<p>securing of UK reconstruction contracts as a second order objective.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> Russia and </p>
<p>France were, by all accounts, anxious about their economic interests in Iraq after </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s demise. UK interests were not something to press immediately, but </p>

<p>STATE DEPARTMENT PAPER ON LESSONS OF THE PAST</p>
<p><b>563. </b> On 26 September, Mr Richard Haass, State Department Director of Policy </p>
<p>Planning, produced a 15-page policy paper on Iraq reconstruction for Secretary </p>
<p>Powell.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> Mr Haass described the paper, reproduced in full in <i>War of Necessity, War of </i></p>
<p><i>Choice, </i>as “the largest single project we undertook during my tenure at Policy Planning”. </p>
<p>The paper was built on “an in-depth examination of the lessons of US experiences with </p>
<p>nation building throughout the twentieth century” and concluded with:</p>
<p>“<b>Seven Lessons for Iraq</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must decide on the scale of our ambitions in Iraq, recognizing that goals </p>
<p>that go beyond disarmament and regional stability and seek to build democracy, </p>
<p>prosperity, and good governance will require a heavy commitment in resources, </p>
<p>military involvement and diplomatic engagement. The strategic importance of </p>
<p>Iraq points toward ambitious long-term goals …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must prevent a security vacuum from emerging in Iraq that could be </p>
<p>exploited by internal spoilers, encourage external meddlers, and preclude </p>
<p>reconstruction and humanitarian efforts …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should help formulate specific plans to transform the UN Oil-for-Food </p>
<p>program into a mechanism that will simultaneously support the humanitarian </p>
<p>needs of the Iraqi people, fund the broader reconstruction effort, and address </p>
<p>outside claimants’ justified interests … At the same time, the United States </p>
<p>should avoid taking ‘ownership’ of the Iraqi oil industry.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should preclude only a small number of members of the old regime … from </p>
<p>participating in the post-Saddam political order. We will most likely need the </p>
<p>assistance of many associated in some way with the old regime to maintain </p>
<p>order and establish a new viable state …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should avoid imposing a particular ruler or party on Iraq, but cannot allow </p>
<p>Iraq to degenerate into chaos … We should work with our partners to launch a </p>
<p>political process that will allow the Iraqi people to move toward self-government …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to contain potential meddling by Iraq’s neighbours, as well as by </p>
<p>other international actors … We need to maintain broad and effective bilateral </p>
<p>dialogue with these countries, forge a six plus two-like forum</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> for co-ordination </p>
<p>among Iraq’s neighbours and most interested outside powers, and … strive to </p>
<p>develop new mechanisms to manage security concerns in the region as well as </p>
<p>promote economic linkages … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… We should assert forceful, public [US] leadership of the security operations, </p>
<p>and then guide the other components of the reconstruction effort from behind the </p>
<p>scenes as we are now doing in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>564. </b> The Haass memorandum did not have an impact in Washington. Mr Haass </p>
<p>recorded that Secretary Powell agreed most of it and sent copies to Secretary Rumsfeld, </p>
<p>Dr Rice and Vice President Cheney:</p>
<p>“No one could argue that these perspectives had not been raised, although it </p>
<p>was true that the lack of any meaningful inter-agency process or oversight of the </p>
<p>aftermath made it too easy for the Defense Department (which was essentially left </p>
<p>by the NSC to oversee itself) to ignore advice from the outside.” </p>

<p><b>567. </b> The 30 September edition of the SPG paper on UK strategic military thinking </p>
<p>included an expanded section on what it called the “aftermath – resolution phase”, the </p>
<p>word “resolution” added in recognition of the possibility of a non-military, diplomatic </p>
<p>resolution to the Iraq crisis.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>568. </b> The paper summarised what was known about current conditions in Iraq:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq though suffering from economic sanctions has great natural wealth, </p>
<p>adequate water resources (with an antiquated urban distribution network) and </p>
<p>an agricultural sector that is capable of producing food though in need of reform.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security structures are bound to the current leadership through ties of kinship </p>
<p>and patronage at senior levels, and economic advantage and fear at the bottom.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has a sophisticated though choking bureaucracy.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi infrastructure is poorly maintained by the current regime with damage from </p>
<p>the war of 1991 still not repaired, and water supplies becoming contaminated in </p>
<p>major urban centres.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Population has been ethnically mixed by current regime by internal displacement </p>
<p>to weaken opposition; however though mixed ethnic, cultural, and religious </p>
<p>divides persist with old scores remaining unsettled.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Indebtedness to Russia. Other regional debts may also exist.”</p>
<p><b>569. </b> On US policy the paper stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US plans envisage a period of military authority exercised through a military </p>
<p>governor. This would be followed by a gradual transition to civil authority and </p>
<p>finally Iraqi self-rule.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Allied to this is an extensive programme to dismantle and remove elements of </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime closely related to Ba’athist rule.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK will need to assess whether it can comfortably support the US intent to </p>
<p>provide military stewardship rather than rapidly establishing an Iraqi transitional </p>
<p>authority at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US desire to remove the influence of the previous regime may also run </p>
<p>counter to the need for basic administration and governance, further increasing </p>
<p>the reliance on external authority. This may prove counter-productive.”</p>

<p><b>572. </b> Lists of post-conflict military tasks, dropped from the 4 September version of </p>

<p>included for the first time:</p>

<p><b>577.  A JIC Assessment on 10 October judged that US-led military action against </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq would motivate extremist groups and individuals to carry out terrorist attacks </b></p>
<p><b>against Coalition targets.</b></p>
<p><b>578. </b> On 10 October, at the FCO’s request, the JIC assessed the terrorist threat from </p>
<p>Iraq in the event of US-led military action or imminent military action.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> The Assessment </p>
<p>made no explicit reference to terrorist attacks against Coalition targets in Iraq, other than </p>
<p>by Saddam Hussein during conflict, but stated:</p>
<p>“US-led military action against Iraq will motivate other [non-Iraqi] Islamic extremist </p>
<p>groups and individuals to carry out terrorist attacks against Coalition targets. </p>
<p>Al Qaida will use a Coalition attack on Iraq as further ‘justification’ for terrorist </p>
<p>attacks against Western or Israeli interests …</p>
<p>“A number of anti-West terrorist groups exploited the situation during the 1991 </p>
<p>Gulf War … Such attacks could be conducted again, by individuals and groups </p>
<p>unconnected with Iraq. This may be exacerbated by weaker international support </p>
<p>for Coalition action compared to 1991.</p>
<p>“<b>We judge that the greatest terrorist threat in the event of military action </b></p>
<p><b>against Iraq will come from Al Qaida and other Islamic extremists</b>, but they will </p>
<p>be pursuing their own agendas, not responding to direction from Iraq. In the longer </p>

<p>POSSIBLE MODELS FOR ADMINISTERING A POST-SADDAM HUSSEIN IRAQ</p>
<p><b>580.  The FCO paper ‘Models for Administering a Post-Saddam Iraq’ identified a </b></p>
<p><b>number of arguments against establishing a US military governorate, concluding </b></p>
<p><b>that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>A UN mandate would be critical in any post-conflict scenario.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Coalition would need to retain responsibility for security for some </b></p>
<p><b>time.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Coalition would also need to control and administer Iraq for an </b></p>
<p><b>unknown period before the creation of an interim administration.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>A UN-led Transitional Authority would be most appropriate model for the </b></p>
<p><b>interim administration. </b></p>
<p><b>581.  The FCO recommended that work should begin on examining a possible </b></p>
<p><b>UN role in more detail.</b></p>
<p><b>582.  It did not address the implications of the different models for the UK.</b></p>
<p><b>583. </b> On 4 October, the FCO sent Sir David Manning a draft of the third paper in its </p>
<p>series on post-conflict issues: ‘Models for Administering a Post-Saddam Iraq’.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>584. </b> A second version with a small number of revisions was handed to the AHGI on </p>
<p>11 October.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p><b>585. </b> The analysis in the paper rested on three assumptions: </p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>the US-led Coalition takes control of Iraq following a short campaign which does </p>
<p>not cause a humanitarian crisis or extensive damage to infrastructure; </p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>there has been no significant WMD usage; and </p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>Saddam’s regime has been removed almost entirely, no alternative regime had </p>
<p>replaced him (eg a military junta) and there have been no uprisings by the Kurds </p>
<p>or Shia.” </p>

<p>of a UN mandate it would be harder for the US-led Coalition to draw on the support of </p>
<p>others in the “aftermath”. </p>
<p><b>587. </b> The body of the paper set out the immediate challenges and responsibilities </p>
<p>the Coalition would face on arrival, and suggested models for managing the transfer </p>
<p>of power to an Iraqi government. Immediate challenges included administering Iraq, </p>
<p>providing security and preparing to hand over power:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Administering Iraq would involve: “Provision of basic necessities … Restoration </p>
<p>of critical infrastructure … Managing the economy … Medical treatment … </p>
<p>Resettlement of refugees … [and] Public information”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “strong security presence” would be needed to “Ensure the effective </p>
<p>destruction of Iraq’s WMD programme … Provide internal and external security </p>
<p>… Protect any transitional administration … Manage Prisoners of War … [and] </p>
<p>Initiate a disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration (DDR) programme.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Preparing for the successful handover of power meant going into Iraq “with </p>
<p>a clear idea of how [to] get out again”. Iraqis should determine their own </p>
<p>government, but it should be “representative of Iraq’s diversity and … deliver </p>
<p>effective government”. Three options were identified: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>democracy (a government elected by a free vote and universal suffrage); </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>representative government (reflecting ethnic and regional interests); or </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a unifying leader (although none was immediately identifiable).</p>
<p><b>588. </b> The paper stated that, although it would be:</p>
<p>“... possible to explore ideas with Iraq exiles … they have little credibility within Iraq. </p>
<p>Any solution would almost certainly have to be sorted out once Saddam had gone … </p>
<p>We should avoid making promises (eg on the timing of any consultation process and </p>
<p>possible government structures) which may later prove unworkable.” </p>
<p><b>589. </b> The section describing possible models for the transfer of power focused on the </p>
<p>nature of the transitional authority to be established after the immediate post-conflict </p>
<p>period: </p>
<p>“<b>The US-led Coalition would almost certainly have to retain responsibility for </b></p>
<p><b>the security function for some time after any conflict …</b></p>
<p>“In the immediate aftermath of any war, the Coalition military forces would need to </p>
<p>take control and administer Iraq at a basic level, including eg ensuring food and </p>
<p>medical supplies. It is not clear how long this would last. Ideally, it would be a matter </p>
<p>of weeks. But much would depend on the security situation. It is quite possible that it </p>
<p>could become an extended period.” </p>
<p><b>590. </b> Once security had stabilised, “the Coalition would look to establish a clearer </p>
<p>structure to carry out the full range of administrative functions … the ideal would be to </p>
<p>make as much use as possible of the existing Iraqi administrative apparatus”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>591. </b> One of the most difficult questions was the form that administration should take. </p>
<p>Two options had been suggested: a US military governorate (with or without a UN </p>
<p>mandate); and a UN or UN-supported transitional authority. The US preference was  </p>
<p>for a military governorate.</p>
<p><b>592. </b> The authors cast doubt on any analogy with the rebuilding of Germany and Japan </p>
<p>after the Second World War, but suggested that a military governorate could have </p>
<p>advantages for the UK:</p>
<p>“It could guarantee US political and financial commitment to the reconstruction </p>
<p>process. It would help ensure the civil administration and security elements of </p>
<p>post-war government remained interconnected.</p>
<p>“But there are major disadvantages. It is questionable whether a military governorate </p>
<p>would be able to carry out all the tasks outlined above effectively. Much would </p>
<p>depend on who the US brought in to take on the key roles, including civilian </p>
<p>personnel. It would be essential that full attention was paid to civilian reconstruction </p>
<p>tasks …</p>
<p>“It is not clear what the legal basis for a governorate would be …</p>
<p>“Presentationally a US-led military governorate would be unattractive. Even with a </p>
<p>UN mandate it would not be seen as impartial in the same way as a UN operation.”</p>
<p><b>593. </b> There were two possible models for a UN administration: a UN transitional </p>
<p>authority as in Cambodia and East Timor, or a UN-supported transitional administration </p>
<p>on the Afghanistan model. Ideally they would be endorsed by some sort of Iraqi political </p>
<p>process. The paper explained:</p>
<p>“Under the Cambodia model, international personnel would take over the main </p>
<p>governmental and military/security structures, replacing the senior officials and </p>
<p>running the organisations themselves. More junior staff would remain in place … </p>
<p>“We consider the Cambodia model likely to be most appropriate for post-Saddam </p>
<p>Iraq. Many senior figures in Iraq’s bureaucracy and military are compromised </p>
<p>by their connections with Saddam’s regime, and also lower down. Rather than </p>
<p>deciding immediately after any conflict who to retain and who to push out, it would </p>
<p>be neater for the UN Transitional Authority to replace the top tier of leadership with </p>
<p>international personnel immediately.</p>
<p>“Once this system was in place, the UN could then move towards the Afghanistan </p>
<p>model, by gradually re-installing senior Iraqi officials as appropriate …”</p>
<p><b>594. </b> The UN approach raised two further questions:</p>
<p>“a) </p>
<p>Who would be the domestic figurehead? … There is no obvious candidate </p>
<p>amongst the Iraqi exile/diaspora communities. It is doubtful whether they </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>would have the credibility. But we should be open to suggestions. It is possible </p>
<p>someone would emerge in the aftermath of conflict – Karzai did.</p>
<p>b) </p>
<p>Who would head the Transitional Authority? It would be critical to identify a </p>
<p>heavyweight figure to head the Transitional Authority. He or she would need to </p>
<p>be acceptable to the Iraqis, within the region and wider Muslim world and to the </p>
<p>US-led Coalition members …”</p>
<p><b>595. </b> The authors concluded:</p>
<p>“–  </p>
<p><b>Whatever we do, a UN mandate would be critical in any ‘Day After’ </b></p>
<p><b>situation …</b></p>
<p><b>– </b></p>
<p><b>The US and coalition partners would need to retain responsibility for Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>security for some time after any conflict, irrespective of the administrative </b></p>
<p><b>arrangements</b> [removed from the 11 October version] …</p>
<p><b>– </b></p>
<p><b>The US-led military coalition would need to control and administer Iraq at a </b></p>
<p><b>basic level for a period after the end of the conflict and before the creation </b></p>
<p><b>of an interim administration. It is not clear how long this period would last </b></p>
<p>[replaced in the 11 October version with: “<b>The US-led military coalition would </b></p>
<p><b>need to secure Iraq for a period after the conflict, including during the </b></p>
<p><b>creation of an interim administration. It is not clear how long this period </b></p>
<p><b>would last. We would want it to be as short as possible</b>”].</p>
<p><b>– </b></p>
<p><b>Our initial assessment is that a UN-led Transitional Authority would be </b></p>
<p><b>most appropriate for the interim administration of Iraq …</b></p>
<p><b>– </b></p>
<p><b>There are strong arguments against a US military governorate – practical, </b></p>
<p><b>presentational and legal. We should not rule it out entirely, but need to </b></p>
<p><b>understand better why the Americans favour this option and how it  </b></p>
<p><b>would work.</b>”</p>
<p><b>596. </b> The paper stated that work should begin on examining a possible UN role in more </p>
<p>detail, in particular:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mapping key tasks and posts to be filled;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identifying someone who could head a transitional authority;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identifying Iraqis who could work in an international administration; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identifying “appropriate British personnel to take over key roles” [amended to </p>
<p>“appropriate personnel (particularly Iraqis)” in the 11 October version].</p>
<p><b>597. </b> The 11 October version of the paper contained an additional recommendation that:</p>
<p><b>“Irrespective of the administrative arrangements, the US and Coalition </b></p>
<p><b>partners would need to retain overall responsibility for Iraq’s security for </b></p>
<p><b>some time after the conflict. How the different security-related tasks (including </b></p>
<p><b>security sector reform) should be carried out and by whom needs further </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>598. </b> The FCO circulated follow-up papers on the possible shape of an international </p>
<p>administration for Iraq and on SSR to the AHGI on 18 October. Both are described later </p>
<p>in this Section.</p>
<p><b>599. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We started planning in the autumn of 2002, and at that point, of course, it wasn’t </p>
<p>clear exactly what scenario there would be in terms of a new regime in Iraq, but we </p>
<p>assumed, I think, from that point onwards, that we would be dealing with an Iraq </p>
<p>without Saddam Hussein and in the aftermath of a military intervention. </p>
<p>“Therefore, we based our planning on the assumption that the right vehicle for that </p>
<p>would be the UN, which had had extensive experience of post-conflict stabilisation </p>
<p>work in a number of different countries. But we looked at a range of scenarios and a </p>
<p>range of possible outcomes from ones where it might be possible to work with large </p>
<p>parts of the previous Iraqi administration to scenarios where it would not, and we </p>
<p>had to look at a fairly wide range of scenarios.”</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>600. </b> Iraq was discussed at a meeting Mr Ricketts attended with his US, French and </p>
<p>German counterparts in Berlin on 14 October.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> The record stated that there was an </p>
<p>emerging consensus from the US Future of Iraq Project that “the Republican Guard </p>
<p>and Ba’ath Party would have to go; but some feeling that medium and lower levels of </p>
<p>government might remain, as might non-senior members of the military”. Mr Ricketts </p>
<p>indicated he thought it “likely the Ba’ath Party would implode post-Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>601. </b> In the US, the CIA considered the Ba’ath Party in two reports in October 2002.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>602. </b> The first, ‘Iraq: the Day After’, dated 18 October, assessed that the Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>would collapse along with Saddam Hussein’s regime, but added: </p>
<p>“Despite the improbability that Ba’ath ideology will persist after Saddam, much of </p>
<p>the infrastructure of the Party within civilian sectors, such as professional and civil </p>
<p>associations, may sustain to facilitate a restoration of government services.” </p>
<p><b>603. </b> On the role of Iraqi military and security services, the paper stated that “many </p>
<p>troops must be quickly disarmed and demobilized to remove a potential focal point </p>
<p>for Sunni coup plotting”, and that “certain units are so dominated by … pro-Saddam </p>
<p>tribesmen or otherwise so intimately linked to the regime that their continued existence </p>
<p>will be incompatible with democracy”. The paper judged that officers who favoured a </p>
<p>professional military ethos or saw themselves as guardians of Iraqi national values </p>
<p>“may play a role in the post-Saddam military”.</p>

<p>217</p>
<p><b>604. </b> The second CIA report, ‘The Iraqi Ba’ath Party: Inexorably Tied to Saddam’, dated </p>
<p>31 October, assessed that many bureaucrats had joined the Ba’ath Party to attain their </p>
<p>positions, were not “ardent supporters of Saddam” and “could probably remain … [after </p>
<p>having been] investigated and vetted”. The report stated, however, that the CIA did not </p>

<p>313</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>607. </b> Suggested points for Mr Straw to raise included a list of reasons why it would not </p>
<p>be easy to decide what new governmental structures should look like:</p>
<p>“–  </p>
<p>ethnic/religious/tribal mix;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>residual Ba’ath influence;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>uneven distribution of resources;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>lack of political infrastructure or unifying figure;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>scope for neighbours to meddle.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>608. </b> Officials suggested that Mr Straw seek agreement to “a few underlying principles:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Iraq to remain a unitary state;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>no need for root and branch dismantling of government;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Iraqis should determine their own government; and</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>need for more representative government, but not necessarily full democracy </p>
<p>in short term.”</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Other points covered in the briefing included the need for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a credible legal base and UN framework”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear exit strategy built on an understanding of what Iraq could look like and </p>
<p>a process for getting there;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment to stay “as long as necessary”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognition that although it would be difficult to minimise the risk of Iraq’s </p>
<p>disintegration, it was important not to fall into the “opposite trap of exaggerating </p>
<p>Iraq’s fragility.”</p>

<p><b>613.  It was intended to have a positive impact on UK and Iraqi Public opinion, </b></p>
<p><b>but did not appear to reflect any assessment of the degree to which Iraqi citizens </b></p>

<p>DFID PAPER: ‘IRAQ: POTENTIAL HUMANITARIAN IMPLICATIONS’ </p>
<p><b>620.  During October, DFID produced two papers on Iraq: a paper on humanitarian </b></p>
<p><b>contingency planning for the AHGI and a desktop analysis of central and southern </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq for internal use in DFID.</b></p>
<p><b>621.  The paper on humanitarian planning outlined possible humanitarian </b></p>
<p><b>consequences of military action and the likely emergency requirements. It </b></p>
<p><b>warned that DFID funds were likely to prove insufficient and that the international </b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian system was becoming overstretched. </b></p>
<p><b>622. </b> Before the 11 October meeting of the AHGI, Mr Alistair Fernie, Head of DFID </p>
<p>Middle East and North Africa Department, circulated a draft paper on humanitarian </p>
<p>planning not yet seen by Ms Short or other departments.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> The paper outlined the </p>

<p>and possible responses, and summarised NGO and multilateral agency contingency </p>

<p>318</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>623. </b> The draft paper made two assumptions:</p>

<p>That the UK role should be to develop and sustain a broad international coalition </p>

<p>international players.”</p>
<p>It added:</p>
<p>“Assumption a) is credible if the UN has a mandate and active support from its </p>
<p>members to do so. The situation might be different in the event of military action not </p>
<p>backed by the UN. Assumption b) is in line with current UK humanitarian policy.”</p>
<p><b>624. </b> The draft listed possible humanitarian consequences of military action, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>large-scale civilian loss of life; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>internal and international population displacement; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>significant infrastructure and environmental damage;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inter-factional clashes within Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>use of chemical and biological weapons. </p>
<p>Likely emergency requirements included provision of basic needs and: “Early focus on </p>
<p>recovery initiatives, particularly linking into infrastructure and environmental damage, </p>
<p>and the impact on livelihoods.” </p>
<p><b>625. </b> The draft explained that DFID’s Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department </p>
<p>(CHAD) was undertaking a “short-term desktop study of the humanitarian situation” in </p>
<p>central and southern Iraq. If restrictions on external contacts with humanitarian agencies </p>
<p>were lifted, CHAD would obtain a fuller picture of contingency planning and agency </p>
<p>capacities. The CHAD Operations Team (OT) was accelerating its post-Afghanistan refit </p>
<p>and being brought up to its full authorised strength of 30.</p>
<p><b>626. </b> The draft also stated that:</p>
<p>“Any large-scale UK humanitarian response would require additional funding from </p>
<p>the Central Reserve. DFID’s existing small (£6m) humanitarian programme in Iraq </p>
<p>is fully committed; available humanitarian funds within CHAD are likely to be grossly </p>
<p>insufficient and most of DFID’s contingency reserve has already been allocated.”</p>
<p><b>627.  The draft paper did not consider whether there was a need for contingency </b></p>
<p><b>plans should either of the underlying assumptions prove wrong. </b></p>

<p><b>632. </b> Like the northern Iraq review in August, the ‘Central/southern Iraq humanitarian </p>
<p>situation analysis’ was marked for DFID internal circulation only. The Inquiry has seen </p>
<p>no evidence that it was distributed more widely. </p>
<p><b>633. </b> Unlike the northern Iraq review, because of restrictions on external contacts by </p>
<p>DFID officials, the analysis of central and southern Iraq was produced without consulting </p>
<p>the UN, NGOs or bilateral partners, but did draw widely on external (including UN) </p>
<p>publications. </p>
<p><b>634. </b> Observations, some of which were repeated from DFID’s report to Ms Short in </p>
<p>May, included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“serial decline” or “collapse” in non-oil sectors of the economy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the negative impact on public services of the large number of public employees </p>
<p>leaving their jobs;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>only 50 percent of electricity demand being met; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>rising levels of waterborne diseases and salt intrusion in water systems in </p>
<p>southern Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>transport infrastructure improving slowly “from a highly degraded base”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the vulnerability of the population could be expected to increase as international </p>
<p>pressure on the government grew; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in the event of military action, the scale and duration of a humanitarian crisis </p>
<p>would be “dependent on efforts to stabilise the situation and address political, </p>
<p>security, humanitarian and economic considerations coherently and rapidly”.</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Officials recommended that better data be sought as soon as contact with </p>

<p><b>637.  DFID should have shared that material with other participants in the AHGI </b></p>

<p><b>post-conflict reconstruction.</b></p>
<p><b>638. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary from 2002 to 2008, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that DFID’s knowledge of Iraq when it began contingency planning in 2002 was </p>
<p>“pretty scanty” as DFID had not itself implemented humanitarian programmes in Iraq in </p>
<p>the period leading up to the invasion, working instead through the UN agencies, NGOs </p>
<p>and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>639. </b> Sir Suma also stated that DFID focused on humanitarian issues “because </p>
<p>we assumed that the UN would come in and show leadership on the post-conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction and recovery phase” and there was “optimism about the UN being able </p>
<p>to play that role”.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that DFID was helpful on humanitarian issues and was </p>
<p>ready “to bring in some of their expertise to help with some of the reconstruction”.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>He stated that: “the concentration on the humanitarian side, which we had expected </p>
<p>might go on for a few months, had probably taken people’s eye a bit off the </p>
<p>reconstruction side …” </p>
<p>UK STRATEGIC POLICY OBJECTIVES FOR IRAQ</p>
<p><b>641.  Mr Blair agreed draft UK strategic policy objectives for Iraq in early October. </b></p>
<p><b>642.  Those objectives were published in January 2003. </b></p>

<p><b>647. </b> Mr Bowen commented that some had argued that the aspirations for the future of </p>
<p>Iraq should be translated into the main objective. He had resisted “on the grounds that </p>
<p>our purpose has been plainly stated by the Prime Minister as disarmament and because </p>
<p>the effective implementation of that policy does not necessarily deliver our wider </p>
<p>aspirations”. The objectives would also need to “evolve with changing circumstances”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If military action were authorised, the paper would need to be revised.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Mr Lee sent a copy of the draft to Mr Hoon’s office, commenting that, while the text </p>
<p>was “helpful in acknowledging the need to make military plans and preparations in case </p>
<p>military action is required it does not, from our point of view, go far enough in providing </p>
<p>direction for current military activity and an information strategy”.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> Mr Lee did not </p>
<p>expect the draft to move forward until there was a clear UN position. He added that the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office and No.10 accepted that the objectives would need to evolve. They were </p>
<p>not for publication at that stage. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>654. </b> In a separate telegram on post-conflict issues sent the same day, Sir Christopher </p>
<p>Meyer reported that the US media, briefed by an unnamed senior official, was saying </p>
<p>that US views were coalescing around the idea of Iraq being governed by a US military </p>
<p>commander in the initial period after Saddam Hussein’s removal.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> Sir Christopher </p>
<p>explained that US Government views were yet to crystallise, but there was a strong </p>
<p>inclination towards that approach, which was at odds with the UN-led solution in the </p>
<p>recent FCO paper. </p>
<p><b>655. </b> Sir Christopher concluded:</p>
<p>“The bottom line is that the US will be firmly in the driving seat in organising any </p>
<p>post-Saddam administration. We need to wake up to this reality and consider how </p>
<p>best we can align ourselves to ensure not only a stable Iraq but also the maximum </p>
<p>benefit for UK plc.”</p>
<p><b>656. </b> On 14 October, the Cabinet Office produced a grid of military and non-military </p>
<p>contingency planning under way in Whitehall. Organised into “external” and “domestic” </p>
<p>issues, work ranged from the FCO paper on administering post-Saddam Hussein Iraq to </p>
<p>an ACPO review of counter-terrorism and counter-extremism policing.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>657. </b> The grid listed 11 papers attributed to the FCO, including the five already circulated </p>
<p>to the AHGI, and six others, “not yet ready for circulation”, covering: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consular contingencies in the region;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reopening an Embassy in Baghdad (see Section 15.1);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic issues in Iraq and the region;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the vulnerabilities of UK diplomatic missions in the region; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contingency planning for a CBW attack on UK diplomatic missions. </p>
<p><b>658. </b> The record of the meeting of the AHGI on 11 October stated that “sanitised” </p>

<p>and the scenarios for post-conflict Iraq with the US, France and Germany.</p>

<p><b>examined possible models for a UN role in the administration of Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>664.  The FCO concluded that a UN transitional administration working alongside </b></p>
<p><b>an international security force would work, but planning needed to start as soon </b></p>
<p><b>as possible.</b></p>
<p><b>665. </b> Mr Gray sent the draft of a 12th FCO paper to the AHGI on 18 October.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> </p>
<p>‘International Administration for Iraq: what, who and how?’ appears to have been </p>
<p>produced in response to the recommendation in the FCO paper on models for </p>
<p>administering a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq that work begin on examining a possible UN </p>
<p>role in more detail. It drew on recent UN experience in Afghanistan, Cambodia, East </p>
<p>Timor and Kosovo to distinguish between two approaches to international administration: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “light” approach, monitoring a local administration’s decisions against </p>
<p>principles set out in a mandate provided by the Security Council; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a more intrusive international administration implementing the mandate directly.</p>
<p>If the Iraqi regime fought to the end or the damage to Iraq was extensive, the </p>
<p>international administration would need to assume control of key areas. If Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein were overthrown quickly or “the bulk of Ba’ath apparatchiks switched sides”, </p>
<p>the lighter approach might be manageable. </p>
<p><b>666. </b> In both cases, key elements of the Security Council mandate would include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction of war damage and delivery of humanitarian assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>internal and external security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stopping Iraq’s WMD programmes;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>reintegration of Iraq into the world economy; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a realistic exit strategy.</p>
<p><b>667. </b> Security would remain the responsibility of the Coalition:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>internal security (“pacification of unrest”), which would fall to the military and be </p>
<p>provided initially by the Coalition;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>external security, where Iraqi forces “would probably have to be replaced”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“law and order issues”, which “might be handled by local police forces but with </p>
<p>strong international monitoring”.</p>
<p><b>668. </b> The FCO advised that tackling Iraq’s administration and reconstruction called for </p>
<p>a focus on key ministries, including defence, interior, justice, finance and oil, and the </p>
<p>regional administration (18 governorates and Baghdad). </p>
<p><b>669. </b> Some institutions (election machinery, parliament, a regional affairs ministry and </p>
<p>Human Rights Commission) would need complete replacement or setting up from </p>
<p>scratch. Some (the Revolutionary Command Council, intelligence and internal security </p>
<p>services, the Ba’ath Party and the presidential apparatus) would need to be dismantled. </p>
<p>Institutions in other areas (labour, planning, education, health and agriculture) could be </p>
<p>left largely in Iraqi hands. That analysis applied whether the administration was headed </p>
<p>by the US military or the UN.</p>
<p><b>670. </b> The FCO suggested that the civilian administration be divided into “pillars” on </p>
<p>the Kosovo model, with the Coalition taking on, as a minimum, defence and interior. </p>
<p>Other pillars might include civil administration, reconstruction, economic reintegration, </p>
<p>institution-building and justice and home affairs.</p>
<p><b>671. </b> On the appointment of a UN “figurehead”, the draft stated: “We would need a </p>
<p>heavyweight Special Representative, ideally a Muslim, who would be prepared to spend </p>
<p>time in Iraq leading the IA [interim administration], backed up by high-calibre senior staff.” </p>
<p><b>672. </b> There was no reference to any UK contribution. </p>
<p><b>673. </b> The FCO advised that the number of Iraqis and non-Iraqis needed for civil </p>
<p>administration would be large, but that the UN system was “unlikely to be able to produce </p>
<p>all the people needed on time”. The UK “should look at a range of other sources:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Other international institutions, e.g. IMF and World Bank</p>

<p><b>674. </b> Previous interim administrations had cost up to US$500 million per year, with civil </p>
<p>components of between 200 and 5,000 personnel, and military components between </p>
<p>40 and 15,000. Civilian police, where necessary, had numbered from 1,000 to 4,000. </p>
<p>Iraq was comparable in size and population to Afghanistan, but much more developed:</p>
<p>“… the scale of intervention in its affairs will be much greater and more intrusive. </p>
<p>Costs and numbers of personnel are likely therefore to be much greater than </p>
<p>previous missions. Who paid would be a key question.”</p>
<p><b>675. </b> The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“Administering Iraq and guiding it back to a sustainable place in the world community </p>
<p>will be a major task. A UN transitional administration could do it, in parallel with an </p>
<p>International Force to provide security and cover for the eradication of WMD. A </p>
<p>model that could work would [be] an extensive Interim Authority, divided into pillars </p>
<p>under the control of a variety of international players. The pace of eventual handover </p>
<p>to Iraqi control could be different for each pillar … But to be successful, planning </p>
<p>needs to start as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>WAR CRIMES AND THE CREATION OF AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL </p>
<p>FOR IRAQ</p>
<p><b>677.  In October, No.10 instructed the Attorney General’s Office and the Cabinet </b></p>
<p><b>Office to take account of the potential need to bring Saddam Hussein and his </b></p>
<p><b>inner circle to justice as part of Whitehall work on the future of Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>678. </b> The creation of an international body to try senior members of Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>regime for war crimes was the founding purpose of INDICT, an NGO chaired by  </p>
<p>Ms Ann Clwyd, Vice-Chair of the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). </p>
<p><b>679. </b> Ms Clwyd raised the possibility of using INDICT “as an alternative to war” at a </p>
<p>meeting of the Parliamentary Committee (the executive body of the PLP) in July 2002.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair is reported to have replied: “Why don’t we do it?” </p>
<p><b>680. </b> In his diaries, Mr Mullin recorded that Ms Clwyd told Mr Blair at the meeting of the </p>

<p>to Mr Blair even though Ms Clwyd “had been pressing the point for ages”. Ms Clwyd </p>
<p>offered to look into the issue for Mr Blair and get back to him.</p>
<p><b>681. </b> At No.10’s request, during September and October 2002, FCO officials started to </p>
<p>consider the possibility of an international criminal tribunal for Iraq (ICTI).</p>
<p><b>682. </b> In late September, the FCO advised Mr Blair that the UK would support </p>
<p>international moves to prosecute leading members of Saddam Hussein’s regime, </p>
<p>but that there were a number of obstacles.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> Those included the lack of International </p>
<p>Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction over crimes committed before the ICC Statute entered </p>
<p>into force on 1 July 2002 and limited support for the idea of establishing a UN tribunal for </p>
<p>Iraq among members of the Security Council. </p>
<p><b>683. </b> On 27 September, material was submitted to Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney </p>
<p>General, on behalf of INDICT, arguing that the UK should assert jurisdiction over crimes </p>
<p>committed against UK nationals by Saddam Hussein and Tariq Aziz (Iraqi Foreign </p>
<p>Minister and Deputy Prime Minister) in 1990 and promote the formation of an ad hoc </p>
<p>tribunal to deal with Saddam Hussein after he left office.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>684. </b> Ms Clwyd sent the material to Mr Blair, who asked officials: “Can I have some </p>
<p>proper work done on why this isn’t a good idea, or could it have PR [public relations] </p>
<p>value?”</p>
<p>337</p>
<p><b>685. </b> In their response on 15 October, FCO officials pointed out that, although President </p>
<p>Bush had warned Saddam Hussein’s generals in a speech on 7 October “that all war </p>
<p>criminals will be pursued and punished”, he had not identified the mechanism to be </p>
<p>used.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> They cautioned that “to pursue efforts to set up an ICTI now, when we are </p>
<p>seeking to engage the UNSC on a range of substantive Iraq-related issues, would be </p>
<p>a serious own goal”. </p>
<p><b>686. </b> Officials put forward four alternatives in the event of a change in the Iraqi </p>
<p>administration:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a special hybrid domestic tribunal, in connection with the UN and including </p>
<p>international judges and prosecutors, similar to the tribunal established in </p>
<p>Sierra Leone;</p>

<p><b>687. </b> Mr Rycroft explained to Mr Blair that he expected Lord Goldsmith to reject the </p>
<p>arguments put forward on behalf of INDICT relating to the 1990 hostage-taking cases </p>
<p>on the grounds that there was almost no prospect of a successful prosecution. He </p>
<p>also commented that the FCO advice on a tribunal “will … not enhance your view of </p>
<p>government lawyers”.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that No.10 officials were “pushing back” on both </p>
<p>issues. Mr Blair should tell Ms Clwyd he was interested in both proposals and that he </p>
<p>had asked for “proper legal advice”. On the tribunal, Mr Blair’s line should be:</p>
<p>“… it is essential that we take a strong line on human rights in Iraq (as we did in the </p>
<p>dossier). We are considering whether we should propose the establishment of an </p>
<p>International Criminal Tribunal for Iraq, or some other mechanism, to ensure that </p>
<p>Saddam and others guilty of the most horrendous crimes can be brought to justice.”</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Mr Rycroft instructed the FCO, the Attorney General’s Office and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office to take account of the potential need to bring Saddam Hussein and his inner circle </p>
<p>to justice as part of Whitehall work on the future of Iraq.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> He asked the FCO to do more </p>
<p>work on options, including how best to let Saddam Hussein’s inner circle know that their </p>
<p>interests would be best served by breaking with him, and the Attorney General’s Office </p>
<p>to look again at the prosecution of the 1990 crimes: “On the face of it, there is much </p>
<p>advantage in letting it be known that we are starting investigations against Saddam for </p>
<p>these crimes.” </p>
<p><b>690. </b> The Attorney General’s Office sent a holding reply on 17 October, explaining that </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith was still considering the material submitted on behalf of INDICT and had </p>
<p>not yet responded to Ms Clwyd or INDICT.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>691. </b> Lord Goldsmith sent a substantive reply to Ms Clwyd on 24 January 2003, which is </p>

<p>230</p>
<p><b>UK military options: war-fighting and reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>695.  Military planning for the deployment of UK land forces in northern Iraq as </b></p>
<p><b>part of a US-led force gathered pace during October 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>696.  On 31 October, Adm Boyce advised Mr Blair that a major contribution to the</b> </p>
<p><b>military campaign would reduce pressure on the UK to finance a share of the  </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict reconstruction effort.</b></p>
<p><b>697. </b> Mr Bowen informed Sir David Manning on 9 October that the Chiefs of Staff had </p>
<p>concluded that a decision in principle in favour of Package 3 in the next few weeks </p>
<p>would help the UK to influence US thinking to a greater extent than had been possible </p>
<p>up to that point, “especially in relation to the aftermath of any military action”.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>698. </b> Section 6.1 sets out the detail of the discussion and the pressures driving the </p>
<p>debate.</p>
<p><b>699. </b> The need for a decision on the potential UK contribution to any US-led action </p>
<p>against Iraq was set out in an urgent minute to Mr Hoon from Mr Johnson on  </p>
<p>11 October.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> Mr Johnson advised that US thinking on the “Day After” was “under-</p>
<p>developed at present” and warned:</p>
<p>“... there is likely to be a need for a substantial, potentially long-enduring </p>
<p>commitment of forces. Assuming that military action had taken place under a UN </p>
<p>umbrella, it is likely that the US would look to allies and the UK to play a major </p>
<p>role in this, perhaps including providing a framework capability through the ARRC </p>
<p>[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]. We clearly have an interest in minimising the risk of a </p>
<p>longstanding commitment … in a part of the world that will not be retention-positive </p>
<p>for our personnel: in terms of Defence Planning Assumptions, a rouled [rotating] </p>
<p>medium scale PSO [peace support operation] in Iraq would only be manageable if </p>
<p>our commitments elsewhere … were capped at small scale. The more substantial </p>
<p>our contribution to military action in the first place, the more plausibly we will be able </p>
<p>to argue that we have done our bit.” </p>
<p><b>700. </b> After a meeting with senior advisers on 14 October, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on </p>
<p>15 October, seeking a decision that week on whether to tell the US they could assume a </p>
<p>UK Land contribution in addition to the air, maritime and Special Forces package already </p>
<p>offered for planning purposes.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> Mr Hoon wrote: </p>
<p>“There is likely to be a substantial and continuing post-conflict stabilisation task in </p>
<p>Iraq. If we do not contribute Package 3, we may be more vulnerable to a US request </p>
<p>to provide a substantial force for this potentially open-ended task.”</p>

<p>231</p>
<p><b>701. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“I am not much persuaded … that if we help with the war fighting, we shall be spared </p>
<p>the post-conflict washing up. It didn’t work like that in Afghanistan. Experience shows </p>
<p>that once you are in, you’re in deep, without queues of grateful countries waiting to </p>
<p>take over when the shooting stops.”</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>702. </b> Sir David suggested that Mr Blair explore a number of questions with Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>including: “Can we afford Package 3?” </p>
<p><b>703. </b> Mr Edward Oakden, Head of FCO Security Policy Department, advised Mr Straw to </p>
<p>question whether the decision really had to be made that week.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> Mr Oakden wrote that </p>
<p>the MOD’s suggestion that the UK could trade a more active role in fighting for “a smaller </p>
<p>military role during reconstruction” seemed “optimistic”: “On the contrary, if we have </p>
<p>fought without international legal sanction, we could be left on our own with the US.”</p>
<p><b>704. </b> On 16 October, Mr Straw updated Mr Blair on his discussions with Secretary </p>
<p>Powell on 14 and 15 October.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> He and Secretary Powell had discussed the risks of </p>
<p>acting without international backing and the problems of the “day after” which would </p>
<p>be the “largest and most hazardous exercise in nation-building”; it would not be as </p>
<p>straightforward as some thought.</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Mr Blair, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce met on 17 October to discuss military </p>
<p>options.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> Mr Blair acknowledged the arguments in favour of Package 3, but:</p>
<p>“… remained concerned about costs. He concluded that he wanted to keep open the </p>
<p>option of Package 3. But we must not commit to it at this stage.” </p>
<p><b>706. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that at the meeting, Mr Blair said “it was not no, </p>
<p>but it was not yet yes, and he wanted more work done analysing the cost”.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>707. </b> The minutes of the meeting of the Chiefs of Staff on 28 October stated that </p>
<p>“it would be important to emphasise within forthcoming submissions that, although </p>
<p>Package 3 might be considered expensive, the alternative of committing to ops </p>
<p>[operations] during the aftermath would also require considerable resources”.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>708. </b> Mr Blair, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce discussed the MOD’s wish to offer </p>
<p>Package 3 to the US for planning purposes on 31 October.</p>

<p>campaign through Package 3, we would be under less pressure to finance a share of the </p>
<p>post-conflict reconstruction effort”. </p>
<p><b>709. </b> Mr Blair decided that the MOD should tell the US that the UK was prepared to “put </p>
<p>Package 3 on the same basis as Package 2 for planning purposes, in order to keep the </p>
<p>option open”.</p>
<p><b>710. </b> Asked why there might have been a reluctance in government during September </p>
<p>and October to go beyond Package 2, Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that one reason </p>
<p>was:</p>
<p>“… the lack of clarity of the overall plans still at that point. I think the Chiefs of </p>
<p>Staff were very assiduous throughout this period of always asking whether, in the </p>
<p>discussions with the United States … the US had ‘a winning concept’. </p>
<p>“… [U]nless and until the Chiefs of Staff were satisfied there was a winning </p>
<p>concept – and remember, we were talking about aftermath or the day after as well </p>
<p>as the actual operation itself - then obviously there was a reservation.”</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>711. </b> The shift in UK military focus from northern to southern Iraq, and changes in the </p>
<p>attitude of the Chiefs of Staff to the desirability of a significant UK military contribution to </p>

<p><b>Growing concern about post-conflict planning</b></p>
<p><b>712.  Between October and December 2002, UK officials expressed growing </b></p>
<p><b>concern about the slow progress of post-conflict planning.</b></p>
<p>DFID CONTACT WITH THE US AND UN</p>
<p><b>713.  By early October, restrictions on contacts with the US and UN were </b></p>
<p><b>constraining DFID’s ability to plan effectively.</b></p>
<p><b>714.  After a visit to the US by Mr Chakrabarti in late September to discuss </b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian planning, Ms Short stopped further contact between DFID and </b></p>
<p><b>US officials, concerned about the potential political implications of DFID being </b></p>
<p><b>seen to prepare for war.</b></p>
<p><b>715.  DFID was also under instruction from the Cabinet Office not to discuss </b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian issues with the UN system.</b></p>
<p><b>716.  Those restrictions had been lifted by the beginning of November.</b></p>
<p><b>717. </b> The DFID draft paper on humanitarian consequences of military action discussed </p>
<p>by the AHGI on 11 October explained that planning was constrained by the shortage of </p>

<p>354</p>
<p> Removal </p>
<p>of “restrictions on initiating contact with relevant stakeholders” would allow DFID to fill </p>
<p>the gap and develop a fuller picture of humanitarian agencies’ contingency planning and </p>
<p>regional capacity.</p>
<p><b>718. </b> The Cabinet Office record of the meeting of the AHGI on 11 October observed that </p>

<p>and added: </p>
<p>“We have asked DFID not to discuss post-conflict Iraq humanitarian issues with [the] </p>
<p>UN system yet, but they will need to do so to develop planning further.”</p>
<p>355</p>
<p><b>719. </b> On 18 October, Mr Drummond informed Sir David Manning that departments’ </p>
<p>contingency planning was mostly confined to Whitehall.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> Although there was no </p>
<p>immediate pressure to extend existing external contacts, which included DTI contacts </p>
<p>with the oil industry, the police with community leaders, and the FCO with the US, </p>
<p>France and Germany, “some Departments such as DFID, who would like to link up with </p>
<p>UN contingency planning, would find it helpful to be authorised to make contact soon, </p>
<p>perhaps after the UNSCR is agreed”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>720. </b> On 30 September, Mr Chakrabarti had called on Mr Elliot Abrams, Head of the </p>

<p>357</p>
<p> Mr Abrams outlined US thinking and </p>
<p>suggested the UK and US keep in touch. </p>
<p><b>721. </b> On 9 October, Mr Chakrabarti asked Mr Fernie to visit Washington in early </p>
<p>November “for discussions with all the parts of the US Admin[istration] and with </p>

<p>wary” of attracting any publicity: </p>
<p>“It could cause huge political difficulties if it emerged that … DFID is planning for </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>723. </b> Ms Short held a meeting on 21 October, attended by Mr Chakrabarti, to discuss </p>
<p>contingency planning. At the meeting Ms Short agreed that DFID officials should </p>
<p>“indicate an intention” to join the FCO-led delegation attending inter-agency talks in </p>
<p>Washington on 6 November, with a final decision to follow later.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>724. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that DFID received an email from the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office on 23 October saying No.10 was happy for the department to talk discreetly to </p>
<p>some NGOs if it was clear the aim was disarmament not war.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>725. </b> Sir Suma stated that, although the email made no reference to contacting the UN, </p>
<p>he and Ms Short had decided in early November that “we just had to do so”.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>726. </b> The Inquiry has not seen a copy of the Cabinet Office email.</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti was asked by the Inquiry whether he had been instructed by </p>
<p>his Secretary of State not to share information (with US officials).</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> He replied: “At no </p>
<p>stage”, and that he was “Absolutely sure” of that. </p>
<p><b>728. </b> Sir Suma’s evidence does not match the instruction sent out by Ms Short’s office </p>
<p>on 15 October. </p>
<p><b>729. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that the first contact between UKMIS </p>
<p>New York and the UN Secretariat to discuss post-conflict planning was in October 2002, </p>
<p>“probably at their request”.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p><b>730. </b> Sir Jeremy reported from New York on 30 October that UN post-conflict planning </p>
<p>was “embryonic”. There were indications of support for a “pillared” model for post-</p>
<p>conflict administration somewhere between the approaches adopted for Kosovo and </p>
<p>Afghanistan, but planning for a possible UN administration was happening at a very low </p>
<p>level. That reflected an instruction from the Secretary-General that work on what was </p>
<p>effectively planning for the UN to take over from the sovereign government of a member </p>
<p>state should be very low key.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>731. </b> On 31 October, the Cabinet Office reported to Sir David Manning that the wider </p>
<p>instruction to departments not to engage external actors was, in practice, being </p>
<p>overtaken.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> There was particular pressure for consultation from the UK oil industry: </p>
<p>a delegation from BP would be visiting the FCO on 6 November. </p>
<p><b>732. </b> On 4 November, Ms Short agreed that a revised version of the DFID paper on </p>

<p>financial resources to cover the humanitarian contingencies considered in the paper.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>733. </b> The substance of the paper was little changed from October, but a new introduction </p>
<p>made explicit reference to the need to consider the humanitarian consequences not just </p>
<p>of military action, but also of regime change without major military action and of Iraqi </p>
<p>compliance with UN resolutions.</p>
<p>368</p>
<p> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Most humanitarian planning is currently focused on the after-effects of conflict … </p>
<p>But UK ministers are clear that humanitarian planning should also consider other </p>
<p>contingencies and not assume conflict is the most likely, in line with current UK </p>
<p>policy objectives for Iraq which focus on disarmament rather than conflict or regime </p>
<p>change.”</p>
<p><b>734. </b> The paper also stated that DFID had begun informal contacts with UN agencies </p>
<p>and that wider contacts might follow the passage of a resolution, a UN decision to start </p>
<p>more active planning, or further UK Ministerial guidance.</p>
<p><b>735. </b> Ms Short told the Inquiry that she had spoken to Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-</p>
<p>General, and Ms Louise Fréchette, UN Deputy Secretary-General, a number of times, </p>
<p>“sort of slightly breaching the No.10 ruling”.</p>
<p>369</p>
<p> She believed that Mr Chakrabarti had </p>
<p>also done so. It was “very fraught” for the UN because of divisions within the Security </p>
<p>Council: “The UN prepared, but kept it quiet.”</p>
<p><b>736.  There is no indication that temporary restrictions on DFID’s contacts with </b></p>
<p><b>the UN and the US had a lasting impact on UK planning for post-conflict Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>The Inquiry does not accept, however, that the political sensitivity of the UK </b></p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 23 OCTOBER 2002: ‘IRAQ: THE KURDS AND SHIA’</p>
<p><b>743. </b> On 23 October, at the FCO’s request, the JIC assessed the likely reaction of the </p>
<p>Kurdish and Shia population of Iraq to any US-led attack.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> It evaluated how significant </p>
<p>and unified the two groups were, their links to Iraq’s neighbours and the external Iraqi </p>
<p>opposition, and their aspirations and fears for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. The JIC </p>
<p>assessed that “each population is a complex web of different groups and interests”. </p>
<p>UK knowledge of the Shia inside Iraq was “very limited”. Senior religious leaders had </p>
<p>“some influence over the Shia population”, but the JIC could not gauge its extent. </p>
<p><b>744. </b> The JIC assessed that Iraqi Shia contact with the outside world was “limited and </p>
<p>ad hoc”, and judged that:</p>
<p>“... <b>currently neither Iran nor the external opposition has a significant influence </b></p>
<p><b>over the Shia population as a whole</b>. On the contrary, we believe many Iraqi Shia </p>
<p>fear Iran winning influence over the future of Iraq because of Tehran’s supposed </p>
<p>insistence on the centrality of Sharia in political life.”</p>
<p><b>745. </b> The JIC’s conclusions included the assessment that:</p>
<p>“… <b>spontaneous uprisings, </b>without any clear central leadership, are likely in  </p>
<p>both southern and northern Iraq … should the regime’s control collapse quickly. </p>
<p>Army deserters (the Shia form the bulk of the Iraqi military’s conscript force)  </p>
<p>could join these in large numbers. The pace of events in such a scenario <b>could </b></p>
<p><b>overtake any planning by the KDP and PUK in the north, and in the south </b></p>
<p><b>control could devolve by default to a patchwork collection of tribal leaders  </b></p>
<p><b>and religious figures </b>about whom we know little. In both areas there could be </p>
<p>violent score settling …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>749.  It proposed that achieving the UK’s preferred outcome of “a more </b></p>
<p><b>representative and democratic Iraq” might involve three phases:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>a transitional Coalition military government lasting up to six months;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>a UN administration lasting about three years; and </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>a sovereign Iraqi government.</b></p>
<p><b>750. </b> The Cabinet Office sent a paper on models for Iraq after Saddam Hussein to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 1 November.</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>751. </b> The Cabinet Office paper was the first attempted synthesis of some of the work </p>
<p>undertaken by departments under the auspices of the AHGI. It was conceived as the </p>
<p>steering brief for the FCO/MOD/DFID/Cabinet Office delegation to the forthcoming </p>
<p>talks on post-conflict issues with the US in Washington and did not propose or allocate </p>
<p>responsibility for next steps. Mr Drummond described it to Sir David Manning as a </p>
<p>summary of latest thinking. The ideas in it would not be presented as UK policy.</p>
<p><b>752. </b> The paper stated that there were many possible permutations of the “stable united </p>
<p>and law abiding state … providing effective and representative government” sought by </p>
<p>the UK, but focused on just two: </p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>an Iraq under a new, more amenable strongman;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>a more representative and democratic Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>753. </b> In the event of Saddam Hussein being toppled by a new strongman from his inner </p>
<p>circle before or during the early stages of a military campaign, the new regime could be </p>
<p>recognised in return for agreement to certain conditions. But:</p>
<p>“Our leverage over the new regime would quickly dissipate as Coalition forces </p>
<p>could not remain at invasion strength in the region for long. Any sanctions, once </p>
<p>lifted, would be difficult to re-impose. This scenario for achieving our goal of Iraqi </p>
<p>disarmament would be relatively simple and cheap, but there would be a high risk </p>
<p>of the new strongman reverting to Saddam’s policies …” </p>
<p><b>754. </b> Assuming that Saddam Hussein’s regime fell and Coalition forces reached </p>
<p>Baghdad, the UK’s preferred model for the future government of Iraq might fall into </p>
<p>three phases:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>transitional Coalition military government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN administration; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “sovereign, representative and democratic government of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>755. </b> Scenario ‘b’ assumed UN authorisation for military action and that the international </p>
<p>community and UN system would be willing to assist with reconstruction. </p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>756. </b> The Coalition would make clear that it would transfer authority from a transitional </p>
<p>military government to UN administration as soon as possible, but in practice that could </p>
<p>take up to six months. The UN would then “rule” Iraq for about three years, during </p>
<p>which time a new Iraqi constitution would be agreed, paving the way for the formation </p>
<p>of a sovereign Iraqi government. The US would continue to have “overall responsibility” </p>
<p>for security.</p>
<p><b>757. </b> The Cabinet Office did not define “representative and democratic”. The phrase </p>
<p>contrasted with the more equivocal language in the FCO paper on scenarios for the </p>
<p>future of Iraq, which proposed that the UK “should argue for political reform, but not </p>
<p>necessarily full democracy in the short term”, and with the reference to “effective and </p>
<p>representative government” in the agreed definition of the desired end state, which was </p>
<p>quoted elsewhere in the Cabinet Office paper. </p>
<p><b>758. </b> The paper listed five priorities facing the transitional military government to be </p>
<p>established by the Coalition after the collapse of the Iraqi regime. </p>
<p><b>759. </b> The first, “establishing security”, was to be achieved by disbanding the “inner rings” </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein’s security apparatus. There would need to be screening of officers in </p>
<p>the security forces. Some would be demobilised, some imprisoned and some tried. </p>
<p><b>760. </b> The four other priorities were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dismantling WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Addressing humanitarian needs. A UN presence would need to be established </p>
<p>as soon as possible, accompanied by “a version of OFF”. There would be </p>
<p>a separate need for emergency work on infrastructure involving close co-</p>
<p>ordination with civilian development agencies.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Planning for a revival of the economy, which would require close co-operation </p>
<p>with international financial institutions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Preparing for a UN administration. “A major task would be to decide as early </p>
<p>as possible on the shape of a UN administration, and begin setting up as soon </p>
<p>as the conflict ends. The Secretary-General, under guidance from the Security </p>
<p>Council, would instruct the UN system to produce the necessary plan. Planning </p>
<p>for SSR, economic recovery, and long-term reconstruction would also take </p>
<p>place.”</p>
<p><b>761. </b> The paper’s description of a possible UN administration drew heavily on the </p>
<p>FCO paper on an international administration for Iraq described earlier in this Section. </p>
<p>It went further than the FCO paper in proposing that a “UN Mission to Iraq (UNMI)” </p>
<p>might be modelled on UNMIK, the UN Mission in Kosovo, where different roles had </p>
<p>been sub-contracted by the UN to other multilateral bodies (the FCO paper listed the </p>
<p>Kosovo model as one of a number of UN operations that could offer useful lessons). </p>
<p>Organisations like the World Bank, OIC, UN and possibly the EU might lead on different </p>
<p>strands. The paper proposed a parallel security structure under direct US military </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>command, replicating NATO’s parallel role in relation to UNMIK, “with as wide an </p>
<p>inclusion of effective Coalition military partners as possible”. </p>
<p><b>762. </b> The level of intervention in individual ministries “would vary from total in the </p>
<p>security field to … superficial in areas such as agriculture. The new senior cadres could </p>
<p>be composed of UN staff, as far as possible from Muslim countries, émigré technocrats </p>
<p>and non-tainted technocrats from within Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>763. </b> There would also need to be a political process managed by UNMI to prepare for a </p>
<p>democratic government. The UN would:</p>
<p>“… engage in a process of political consultation which would lead to a convention </p>
<p>of all Iraqi factions, both internal; and external … Under the UN administration, work </p>
<p>could take place on reconstructing government, encouraging new political parties, </p>
<p>facilitating free media and an active civil society. A new/revised/and possibly federal </p>
<p>constitution will be drafted by Iraqi experts with international guidance. Municipal </p>
<p>elections will take place.”</p>
<p><b>764. </b> The paper stated that UNMI would require:</p>
<p>“… at least in excess of one thousand international staff and several thousand </p>
<p>foreign police. The security force would require tens of thousands of soldiers, </p>
<p>although this figure would reduce over time. There are question[s] of how much this </p>
<p>international effort would cost and how it would be funded. This could be done by </p>
<p>national contributions or through the UN assessment system. An alternative would </p>
<p>be to use oil revenue to pay administrative and military costs. This would require </p>
<p>UN authorisation, and UNMI and security expenses would need to take account </p>
<p>of debt repayment …”</p>
<p><b>765. </b> There would also need to be a financial plan, involving detailed work by the  </p>
<p>IFIs, to reconcile payment of Iraq’s “huge external debts” with reconstruction and </p>
<p>development needs.</p>
<p><b>766. </b> The SSR section of the Cabinet Office paper drew on an early draft of a longer </p>
<p>FCO paper on the subject, the final version of which is described later in this Section. </p>
<p>The Cabinet Office paper stated: </p>
<p>“Having dismantled Saddam’s security apparatus, there will need to be a new one. </p>
<p>This will need a comprehensive security sector plan agreed with and led by the US. </p>
<p>The judiciary will need a total rebuild as well as the police. Decisions will need to be </p>
<p>taken about the size and scope of the army and intelligence services.”</p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>767. </b> The Cabinet Office paper concluded with a short section on establishing a </p>
<p>“Sovereign Democratic Iraqi Government”: </p>
<p>“To mark the end of UNMI there will be a progressive return of bureaucratic and </p>
<p>political power to Iraqis. A new constitution will be promulgated. National elections </p>
<p>will be held. International military forces will withdraw … The new Iraq would be </p>
<p>welcomed back to the international community. Under international guidance, the </p>
<p>new government could be encouraged to sign a collective non-aggression pact with </p>
<p>all states bordering the Gulf.”</p>
<p><b>768. </b> The paper did not address the UK’s responsibilities and obligations during military </p>
<p>occupation or the UK’s wider post-conflict contribution.</p>
<p><b>769. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“At the period we were developing our thinking about [the] UN lead in the summer </p>
<p>of 2002, autumn of 2002, winter of 2002, it was not clear at all the timing on which </p>
<p>military action might happen, indeed whether it would happen at all, and whether </p>
<p>there would have been full UN authorisation in the second resolution for it. </p>
<p>“So at that period, we were talking in more general terms with the UN. By the </p>
<p>time [in early 2003] it became clear, the timescale for military action, I think it was </p>
<p>then also clear that the US would not be prepared to have UN administration. </p>
<p>Therefore, by then we were on the track of working with ORHA [the DoD-led Office </p>
<p>of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, see Section 6.5]. But I think it was </p>
<p>a reasonable planning assumption in the autumn of 2002 that we could work for a </p>
<p>UN transitional authority, and at that time the UN still had time to prepare for it.”</p>
<p>378</p>
<p><b>770. </b> On 4 November, the AHGI took stock of all contingency planning papers nearing </p>
<p>completion. The record of the meeting stated: “With the new UNSCR nearing adoption, </p>
<p>it is time for those departments, which have not already done so, to conclude their initial </p>
<p>contingency planning.”</p>

<p>FCO PAPER: ‘ECONOMIC ISSUES IN IRAQ AFTER POST-SADDAM REGIME </p>
<p>CHANGE’</p>
<p><b>771.  The FCO’s second paper on rebuilding Iraq’s economy identified the </b></p>
<p><b>immediate tasks facing any new administration. Those included investing in </b></p>
<p><b>infrastructure to build public support and taking control of public finances.</b></p>
<p><b>772.  The paper stated that detailed analysis and planning needed to begin </b></p>
<p><b>immediately. </b></p>
<p><b>773. </b> A draft of the FCO paper on economic issues in Iraq, written at some point before </p>
<p>19 October,</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> was circulated to AHGI members on 4 November.</p>
<p>382</p>
<p> The paper described </p>
<p>Iraq’s economy as “distorted and very badly damaged”, and consisting of a number of largely </p>
<p>separate elements: the oil sector, which was efficiently run; the formal economy; the food </p>
<p>distribution system; the informal economy (“an unrecorded, unregulated sprawl of trading </p>
<p>and services”); the economy of northern Iraq; and the “partly secret regime/elite economy”. </p>
<p>The challenge would be to strip out the undesirable elements, retain the desirable and </p>
<p>essential elements (the central bank and economic ministries “probably” still had competent </p>
<p>staff below political appointees) and bring those together as a single economy. </p>
<p><b>774. </b> Ensuring that there was “a smooth economic transition in the early months after </p>
<p>regime change” would be the immediate task. Particularly high priority would have to be </p>
<p>given to preserving food supplies and effective control of public finances, both of which </p>
<p>were tied to the future of OFF.</p>
<p><b>775. </b> The FCO paper stated that, in order to help build popular and regional support for </p>
<p>the new administration, it might well be necessary to be able to show early gains:</p>
<p>“... the most obvious quick way of doing this would be to provide … a significantly </p>
<p>improved food ration, no doubt bolstered with a message about diverting resources </p>
<p>from Saddam’s extravagances … Beyond the first 6-12 months the focus should turn </p>
<p>more to targeting of reconstruction expenditure to achieve political quick wins.</p>
<p>“... Even if a new conflict produces little additional damage, the combination of </p>
<p>neglect and war damage means that large investments in many areas and spread </p>
<p>over many years, are needed if infrastructure and services are to recover even </p>
<p>to their pre-1990 condition. Getting this process under way will be essential to </p>
<p>economic revival, to the alleviation of humanitarian problems and to popular support </p>
<p>for a new administration.</p>

<p>“The two big constraints will be finance and implementation capacity. On the </p>
<p>former the key will be a workable agreement between external stakeholders which </p>
<p>guarantees a reasonable flow of resources to Iraq … On the latter there will be a </p>
<p>need for detailed analysis and planning of the substance, some of which should be </p>
<p>set in hand now … and also for the establishment of a competent central body within </p>
<p>Iraq able to act as the focal point for reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>776. </b> The FCO warned that Iraq’s actual or potential financial obligations, including debt </p>
<p>servicing and compensation payments, threatened to “swamp” the income available </p>
<p>from oil. There would need to be co-ordination between external players on a package </p>
<p>including new bilateral grants or loans and multilateral assistance. </p>
<p><b>777. </b> The FCO advised that advance planning for the period immediately after regime </p>
<p>change “falls to the US”, but there was also a need for “good information and sound </p>
<p>policy analysis” from the World Bank and IMF:</p>
<p>“... neither institution has done any substantive work for many years; if we leave it </p>
<p>until regime change has happened to ask them to address the issues there is likely </p>
<p>to be a considerable delay before they can produce anything useful. On economic </p>
<p>grounds there is a good case for asking senior management in both institutions to </p>
<p>put work in hand well in advance of military action … [S]ome useful preparatory </p>
<p>assessments … would at least mean that an incoming regime, and its friends </p>
<p>abroad, would not be flying completely blind on economic matters …”</p>
<p><b>778. </b> The only comments on the draft seen by the Inquiry were from a junior official </p>
<p>in DFID, who observed a need “to dovetail humanitarian relief efforts with a transition </p>
<p>phase, reconstruction and longer-term reform”.</p>
<p>383</p>
<p> The official recommended that  </p>
<p>“a revised version of OFF should incorporate <b>development planning</b> (sector </p>

<p>reported to No.10 and a large number of FCO officials, including Sir Michael Jay, </p>
<p>Mr Ricketts and Mr McDonald, a discussion on Iraq with Dr Charles Tripp of the </p>
<p>School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS).</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>785. </b> Mr Fraser highlighted a number of points raised by Dr Tripp, including his view that: </p>
<p>“Ordinary Iraqis were fairly passive towards the regime … Some among the Shia still </p>
<p>considered Saddam to be the creature of America – ‘without the Americans he would </p>
<p>not be there now’. They would be cautious in welcoming any incoming army until </p>
<p>they were convinced that Saddam really was on the way out …</p>
<p>“Analysts who tried to divide Iraq into three distinct ethnic/religious groups were </p>
<p>being over simplistic …</p>
<p>“Federalism was not an option for Iraq … and could lead to polarisation between the </p>
<p>north and south with a weak middle between …</p>
<p>“Establishing a representative government based on democratic principles would be </p>
<p>costly both in political investment, money and military effort. There was no evidence </p>
<p>that the US had either the stamina or the knowledge to carry this through. Many of </p>
<p>those … who were talking about democracy in Iraq knew nothing about the country. </p>
<p>A long-term international presence – whether US or UN-led – would be extremely </p>
<p>vulnerable to Iraqi opposition movements, as well as to other elements such as </p>
<p>Al Qaida who would want to see it fail … If this scenario were too daunting, then </p>
<p>the best thing might [be] to go for a short-term fix involving one or more military </p>
<p>strong men …</p>
<p>“Islamism was an underlying force in Iraq … If it came to a post-Saddam Iraq we </p>
<p>would need to have thought through in advance how to respond …”</p>

<p><b>787. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Straw held an off-the-record seminar on Iraq with six academics on </p>
<p>19 November. The participants were:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>788. </b> The seminar was proposed by Professor Freedman as a means to “raise some of </p>
<p>the less obvious issues and perspectives that need to be discussed”.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair to issue a disclaimer at the start of the seminar, which </p>
<p>explained that:</p>
<p>“… this session is not about Iraq policy directly, the fact that we are having it does </p>
<p>not mean anything about our policy, and any discussion of post-Saddam Iraq does </p>
<p>not mean that our policy is regime change”.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>790. </b> No.10 issued a list of questions as an agenda for the seminar. Mr Rycroft explained </p>
<p>to Mr Blair that the agenda was not designed to be adhered to religiously, but “to spark </p>
<p>off an informal, free-flowing discussion”:</p>
<p>“1. </p>
<p>Can Iraq only be ruled by a strong authoritarian regime? Are other models </p>
<p>possible? Why have they not worked in the past? Is regional devolution a </p>
<p>starter?</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>Can the different communities work together? What are the aspirations of the </p>
<p>Shia and the Kurds? What relations do the Iraqi Shia have with Iran?</p>

<p>3. </p>
<p>What role does Islam play in Iraqi political life? How strong is Iraqi secularism? </p>
<p>Would it survive the fall of the Ba’ath?</p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>What links does Iraq have to terrorism these days?</p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>Post-Saddam, how quickly would the Iraqi economy revive? Who would control </p>
<p>the oil etc?</p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>What is the future of Iraqi relations with Iran? Can they co-operate or are they </p>
<p>condemned to remain rivals for power at the north of the Gulf?</p>
<p>7. </p>
<p>Is there a prospect that Iraq can co-operate with the other Gulf Arab states, or </p>
<p>will Baghdad, as the historical centre of power and the most populous Arab state </p>
<p>in the region, always try to dominate? What are the possible models for security </p>
<p>and stability in the Gulf region in the future? Can Iraq ever work with the GCC </p>
<p>[Gulf Co-operation Council]?</p>
<p>8. </p>
<p>Would change in Iraq destabilise other states like Syria (further undermining the </p>
<p>credibility of the Ba’ath there) or Jordan? Is there really a prospect that change in </p>
<p>Iraq could unlock movement on the MEPP?”</p>
<p><b>791. </b> At the seminar, Mr Blair made clear that the discussion was off the record and “any </p>
<p>discussion of post-Saddam Iraq did not imply that regime change was our policy or was </p>
<p>inevitable”.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>792. </b> Not all the questions on the agenda were addressed at the seminar. The No.10 </p>
<p>record stated that there were “no blinding insights”. Points put forward by the academics </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some members of the Iraqi regime were arguing that any change of regime </p>
<p>would be worse for the Iraqi people: “Iraqis feared disorder; Saddam guaranteed </p>
<p>stability”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The most likely successor to Saddam Hussein was another General.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Changing Iraq substantively would mean tackling:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the shadow state behind the publicly visible state;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the role of the armed forces; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the political economy of oil, which led to a highly centralised bureaucracy </p>
<p>and the power of patronage.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be tricky decisions on the extent of co-operation with existing </p>
<p>structures, including the Ba’ath Party, with differing views on whether it would </p>
<p>survive Saddam Hussein’s downfall.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no existing process like the Afghan Loya Jirga that could be used to </p>
<p>build future governance structures.</p>

<p>Opposition groups outside Iraq had “zero credibility” in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The focus should be on building local councils (many Iraqis were localists </p>
<p>at heart).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A strong sense of Iraqi nationalism would hold the country together.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been a shift of wealth from urban to rural and a rebirth of Iraqi </p>

<p>Reintegration into the global economy would throw up serious problems, </p>
<p>including claims and debt.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>SPG PAPER, 6 NOVEMBER 2002: ‘UK MILITARY STRATEGIC THINKING ON IRAQ’</p>
<p><b>795.  The last two editions of the SPG paper on UK military strategic thinking were </b></p>
<p><b>emphatic about the strategic importance of the post-conflict phase of operations </b></p>
<p><b>and the need for better co-ordination of planning and preparation across </b></p>
<p><b>government.</b></p>
<p><b>796.  On 6 November, the SPG advised:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The post-conflict phase of operations had “the potential to prove the most </b></p>
<p><b>protracted and costly phase of all”.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Planning needed to be flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of </b></p>
<p><b>possible outcomes.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Poor handling of post-conflict Iraq had the potential to fuel international </b></p>
<p><b>tension and arm the forces of extremism.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Planning for the post-conflict phase “must be complete before the start of </b></p>
<p><b>offensive operations”.</b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>799. </b> The 6 November edition of the SPG paper on UK military strategic thinking </p>
<p>included a rewritten section on the “Aftermath-Resolution Phase” that highlighted the </p>
<p>strategic significance of the post-conflict phase of operations: </p>
<p>“The lasting impression of Coalition legitimacy and success will not be set by military </p>
<p>success in conflict – it will be determined by the nature of the Iraqi nation that </p>
<p>emerges afterwards.</p>
<p>“This phase has the potential to prove the most protracted and costly phase of all.</p>
<p>“Planning must be flexible to accommodate a wide range of start states and possible </p>
<p>outcomes ranging from fast and bloodless coup, a rapid and anarchic collapse, or a </p>
<p>damaged and ungoverned state on the verge of disintegration.</p>
<p>“Operations in Iraq may have a negative impact on the UK’s policy objectives for </p>
<p>international terrorism, as poor handling of a post-conflict Iraq has the potential to </p>
<p>increase greatly anti-Western feeling in the region; fuelling the very international </p>
<p>tensions we have sought to diffuse and arming the forces of extremism.”</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>800. </b> The SPG paper listed four policy “pillars” needed to bring about the desired end </p>
<p>state, “each composed of a range of lines of operation for different ministries, agencies </p>
<p>and NGOs”: judiciary and law; society and economy; governance; and security. </p>
<p><b>801. </b> The SPG advised: </p>
<p>“The Pillars only serve a purpose if they form the basis for interaction and co-</p>
<p>operation between OGDs. The MOD can define some lines of operation in isolation, </p>
<p>but early consultation is necessary for coherence.</p>
<p>“Action is in hand by Cabinet Office to develop UK thinking.</p>
<p>“From an MOD perspective, ideally OGDs should be invited to agree the policy </p>
<p>pillars and outline their lines of operation within them, noting where they may seek </p>
<p>assistance from, or interaction with, the military.”</p>
<p><b>802. </b> The SPG advised that, because of the US lead on military operations, much of </p>
<p>the policy on post-conflict issues was likely to reflect US aims and principles. Early </p>
<p>assessment of areas of potential difference was the key to avoiding UK principles being </p>
<p>compromised. Governance and reform might be critical areas. </p>
<p><b>803. </b> In the absence of an agreed US position on the post-conflict role of the UN, the </p>
<p>SPG judged it “probable” the UK would accept: “an initial brief period of Coalition-run, </p>
<p>largely military government; followed by an interim government run by either a UN </p>
<p>international appointee or a UN approved Iraqi; leading to self-government”.</p>

<p>249</p>
<p><b>804. </b> The SPG advised:</p>
<p>“A balance must be struck between the competing demands for reform and removal </p>
<p>of Ba’athist influence and the need for effective administration. This dilemma shapes </p>
<p>some clear information requirements …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A detailed structural analysis of the current regime, its instruments of state </p>
<p>power and its administration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An informed UK-US judgement on the degree to which reform will be required </p>
<p>immediately, for effective operation, and eventually, to secure the end state.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A rolling assessment of the effectiveness of state institutions as a result </p>
<p>of Coalition action, linked to a mechanism for moderating or accelerating </p>
<p>operations to set conditions for successful post-conflict efforts. <b>Throughout, </b></p>
<p><b>military offensive action must be balanced against the longer-term </b></p>
<p><b>objectives – the opportunity for counter-productive destruction is high.”</b></p>
<p><b>805. </b> The paper included a diagram showing the military activities (“lines of operation”) </p>
<p>supporting the four policy pillars and the expected duration of each activity across four </p>
<p>phases:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pre-conflict;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>immediate (six months);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>medium term (six months to two years);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>long term (2-10 years). </p>
<p><b>806. </b> The military activities were focused on provision of security and SSR. Potential </p>
<p>“supporting roles” included “administration, planning and co-ordination”, emergency </p>
<p>reconstruction, urgent humanitarian assistance, support to international courts and </p>
<p>“info ops”.</p>
<p><b>807. </b> The SPG proposed a possible definition of the military end state:</p>
<p>“An accountable Iraqi security structure capable of assuming self-defence and </p>
<p>internal security responsibilities in accordance with international law.”</p>
<p><b>808. </b> No firm date was given for achieving the military end state. The paper indicated </p>
<p>that the UK might choose to set its own end state at as little as two years “to meet [the] </p>
<p>aspiration for shorter engagement”. </p>
<p><b>809. </b> The diagram identified short-term military activities likely to last up to six months </p>
<p>(emergency reconstruction; urgent humanitarian assistance; transitional law and order), </p>
<p>medium-term activities of up to two years (“administration, planning and co-ordination”; </p>
<p>WMD removal), and long-term activities lasting up to 10 years (force protection; control </p>
<p>and reform of Iraqi armed forces and handover to those forces; maintenance of internal </p>
<p>security and territorial integrity; infrastructure security). </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>810. </b> In its summary of the implications of the post-conflict phase for military planning, </p>
<p>the paper stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The impact of any enduring commitment on other operations would be </p>
<p>significant. A recommendation on the size of force the UK is prepared to commit </p>
<p>must be prepared, at least for the key six months following any operation. In </p>
<p>parallel diplomatic efforts must seek partners to share, and eventually take, the </p>
<p>burden.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Planning for Resolution Phase operations must be complete before the start of </p>
<p>offensive operations. Any UK land force HQ must have the capacity to conduct </p>
<p>offensive and Resolution Phase operations concurrently.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>War-fighting forces must be able to contribute to Resolution Phase objectives </p>
<p>until formal transition to resolution phase can be declared. Therefore clarity </p>
<p>on post-Resolution Phase and likely UK contribution will be needed before </p>
<p>operations commence.”</p>
<p><b>811. </b> The aftermath section of the SPG paper concluded with seven key judgements:</p>
<p><b>“</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Views on policy pillars and extent of support expected of military forces </b></p>
<p><b>will be sought from OGD using current Cabinet Office machinery.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The development of a jointly acceptable approach to Iraqi governance and </b></p>
<p><b>reform in the Resolution Phase should be pursued with the US. Agreement </b></p>
<p><b>on the role of the UN is essential.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>A structural analysis of the Iraqi system and the need for reform is </b></p>
<p><b>required. Current FCO and DFID papers reveal key gaps in our knowledge </b></p>
<p><b>(eg structure and efficiency of Iraqi police).</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>A detailed analysis of the CoA [courses of action] of key actors is required. </b></p>
<p><b>Military and non-military pre-emption capabilities and contingency plans </b></p>
<p><b>must be prepared.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The UK’s intent to commit forces beyond offensive operations needs to </b></p>
<p><b>be clarified to allow operational planning for the Resolution Phase, and to </b></p>
<p><b>allow balancing of the wider commitments picture.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Once principal Coalition partners have agreed on key issues, this will </b></p>
<p><b>need to include agreement on Coalition management processes, early </b></p>
<p><b>diplomatic activity to seek burden-sharing partners should be undertaken.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Work to define force structure options must run concurrently with ongoing </b></p>
<p><b>operational planning in order to ensure the UK is adequately prepared to </b></p>
<p><b>conduct Resolution Phase operations.”</b></p>
<p><b>812. </b> The SPG explained that a “full and detailed strategic estimate” for the post-conflict </p>
<p>phase of operations was being prepared and would be presented in the next draft of the </p>
<p>paper, which issued on 13 December and is described later in this Section.</p>

<p>251</p>
<p><b>First round of inter-agency talks, Washington, 6 November 2002</b></p>
<p><b>813.  US/UK differences on the potential role of the UN in post-conflict Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>became increasingly apparent from November 2002. </b></p>
<p><b>814.  In early November, the UK envisaged a six-month transitional Coalition </b></p>
<p><b>military administration handing over to a UN administration for about three years. </b></p>
<p><b>US planners foresaw a role for UN agencies (but not overall UN leadership) </b></p>
<p><b>during a US-led transitional administration, with a gradual transfer of power to </b></p>
<p><b>a representative Iraqi government.</b></p>
<p><b>815. </b> During talks in London on 13 September with Sir David Manning, Mr Haass </p>
<p>proposed UK/US work on the political, economic, humanitarian and refugee issues that </p>
<p>would result from Saddam Hussein’s departure.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> Sir David welcomed the proposal. </p>
<p><b>816. </b> Before the talks took place, a “vigorous debate” about changes to US planning </p>
<p>machinery led to a hiatus in US post-conflict planning lasting several weeks.</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>817. </b> In <i>War and Decision</i>, Mr Feith explained that, during October 2002, Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld reached the conclusion that one US official should be responsible for the </p>
<p>political, economic and security aspects of reconstruction.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>818. </b> Mr Feith explained the idea to the NSC on 15 October. He proposed that </p>
<p>CENTCOM’s post-invasion structure should consist of a military headquarters (the </p>
<p>Combined Joint Task Force–Iraq (CJTF-I)) and a civil administration headed by a civilian </p>
<p>“Iraq co-ordinator”. Both would be under CENTCOM command. He also proposed that </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld should have overall responsibility for the post-war effort. </p>
<p><b>819. </b> On 18 October, Secretary Rumsfeld told Mr Feith to set up a post-war planning </p>
<p>office, only to reverse the decision soon afterwards. Mr Feith wrote that he only learned </p>
<p>much later that this had been because President Bush was concerned that setting up </p>
<p>such a unit would undercut his international diplomacy. As a result, each of the existing </p>
<p>working groups for post-conflict issues carried on working independently. Planning for </p>
<p>Phase IV of the military campaign, taking place at CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, </p>
<p>Florida, fell behind the other phases. </p>
<p><b>820. </b> Mr Feith explained that the situation changed after Iraq’s weapons declaration </p>
<p>on 7 December. On 18 December President Bush had told the NSC that war was </p>
<p>“inevitable”. Mr Feith, who had never heard the President say that before, considered it </p>
<p>a “momentous” comment. He also observed that the President’s view was not shared by </p>
<p>Secretary Powell. </p>

<p>252</p>
<p><b>821. </b> Mr Feith wrote that it now became possible to create a central post-war planning </p>
<p>office:</p>
<p>“The President knew that creating a new office … would be seen around the world </p>
<p>as … a sign that war was likely and imminent. Now, however, the President was </p>
<p>beyond that worry.”</p>
<p><b>822. </b> In late December, Secretary Rumsfeld asked Mr Feith to start drafting the charter </p>
<p>for the new “central post-war planning office”.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>823. </b> Secretary Powell, quoted in <i>Hard Lessons</i>, explained: </p>
<p>“[The] State [Department] does not have the personnel, the capacity, or the size to </p>
<p>deal with an immediate post-war situation in a foreign country that’s eight thousand </p>
<p>miles away from here, so there was never a disagreement about this. It made </p>
<p>sense.”</p>
<p>397</p>
<p><b>824. </b> President Bush formalised the creation of the new office in January 2003 </p>
<p>(see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>825. </b> On 6 November, Mr Chaplin led an FCO/MOD/DFID/Cabinet Office delegation </p>

<p>reform”, including removal of “the pervasive influence of the Ba’ath Party”, the US </p>
<p>believed “reasonably competent ministries” remained beneath permanent secretary level </p>
<p>and that, because the Ba’ath Party operated as a parallel structure to government below </p>
<p>that level, “less radical change is needed”. Mr Drummond suggested that both the UK </p>
<p>and US governments would need to develop and test their thinking more thoroughly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>829. </b> On SSR, Mr Drummond reported agreement on the need for rapid and </p>
<p>comprehensive reform of Iraqi security structures. He expected the US to “maintain a </p>
<p>tight grip on this”, but the UK had “urged them to think about the wider security sector </p>
<p>including police and the need to arrive with a plan (ie not as in Afghanistan)”. </p>
<p><b>830. </b> The US seemed to be “well ahead with thinking about the humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences of military action”, though less so the impact of CBW use; was “focused </p>
<p>on the need for urgent rehabilitation of infrastructure”; wanted to establish a trust fund </p>
<p>for transparent administration of oil revenues; and agreed Iraqi debts would require </p>
<p>rescheduling. </p>
<p><b>831. </b> On war crimes, Mr Drummond said that the US was working to identify “the top 30 </p>
<p>bad guys” with no future in a successor regime, but had not focused on how to deal with </p>
<p>any who might survive the conflict: “Given the time and cost of international tribunals we </p>
<p>offered to consider whether any Iraqi legal processes might be usable.” Mr Drummond </p>
<p>reported an absence of “serious thinking about Truth and Reconciliation”, but suggested </p>
<p>“that can be pursued later”. </p>
<p><b>832. </b> Mr Drummond concluded:</p>
<p>“We expect a further meeting in London or Washington, before the end of the year. </p>
<p>There is likely to be a separate session in December between DFID and NSC and </p>
<p>USAID. But this was a useful start and revealed that the US had done some detailed </p>
<p>work and inter-agency coordination is working.”</p>
<p><b>833. </b> Some of the differences between the UK and US positions described by Mr </p>
<p>Drummond were addressed in a paper on possible interim administrations in Iraq </p>
<p>produced by the FCO and shared with the US in mid-December. The FCO paper is </p>
<p>described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>834. </b> Ms Miller, the DFID member of the UK delegation, provided her own assessment </p>
<p>for Ms Short, reporting that the US was “reluctant to concede a meaningful role to the </p>
<p>UN at any stage of the process”, but that USAID took a slightly different position.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At her meeting with officials from USAID’s Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance </p>
<p>(OFDA), she had been told “we should assume a UN lead for planning purposes”. </p>

<p>Humanitarian Working Group was working closely with the US military, which he </p>
<p>anticipated would take on most of the immediate post-conflict restoration of utilities. </p>
<p><b>836. </b> At USAID, Ms Miller was told that OFDA was “preparing to take a major role in food </p>

<p><b>837. </b> Mr Fernie visited Geneva on 7 November to discuss UN humanitarian contingency </p>

<p>401</p>
<p> He reported that planning was being </p>
<p>done discreetly and without political cover. He added that, although he had stressed </p>
<p>throughout that the UK was thinking about a range of scenarios, including a deterioration </p>
<p>of the humanitarian situation during further weapons inspections, no-one engaged on </p>
<p>other options: “they are all planning for conflict”. </p>
<p><b>838. </b> Mr Fernie listed a number of next steps:</p>
<p>“We need to decide if/when we could support agency preparedness (we gave no </p>
<p>commitment on this, citing policy and financial constraints) …</p>
<p>“… [W]e could consider promoting military-humanitarian co-operation on the </p>
<p>implications of CBW use for civilian populations.</p>
<p>“We should consider with Whitehall colleagues how to co-ordinate our approaches </p>
<p>with other donors – particularly the USA, in the light of what was learnt in </p>
<p>Washington this week on US views of the UN’s potential role.”</p>

<p>Sir David Manning was informed that, at the AHGI, departments had been:</p>
<p>“… encouraged, where necessary, to engage those outside government in prudent </p>

<p>“... there was also a surge of hope, certainly on my part, that this would give us more </p>
<p>time.</p>
<p>“Indeed, some exchanges I had with my opposite number in Washington suggested </p>
<p>that, despite all the difficulties … it was not impossible to think that one could delay </p>
<p>things until the autumn of 2003, and that would have been a very good thing, not </p>
<p>least because we would then have extra time for the planning that was</p>
<p> </p>
<p>necessary.”</p>
<p>404</p>
<p><b>843. </b> Mr Lee told the Inquiry that, by mid-November, there had been a lot of conceptual </p>
<p>thinking and analytical work on day after planning in Whitehall and there was “a fairly </p>
<p>clear idea of the sort of things that needed to be pursued”.</p>
<p>405</p>
<p> His sense throughout the </p>
<p>autumn was that, although the US “would agree with the propositions that we put to </p>
<p>them”, it had not made much progress “translating that into some sort of plan”. During </p>
<p>a visit to Washington on 11 and 12 November, he and Lt Gen Pigott had suggested </p>
<p>post-conflict planning should be given the same level of attention and resource as </p>
<p>conflict planning: “they recognised the point, and I think they had some sort of staff </p>
<p>effort mobilised … towards post-conflict planning, but … nothing on the scale of the </p>
<p>conflict planning”.</p>
<p><b>844. </b> The record of the 15 November meeting of the AHGI stated that UN planning </p>
<p>for conflict and post-Saddam Hussein Iraq was deepening.</p>
<p>406</p>
<p> The UN was now in </p>
<p>contact with the US. The US and UK agreed that the IMF and World Bank would have </p>
<p>a leading role in helping economic recovery in Iraq. The AHGI agreed that the Treasury </p>
<p>and DFID should instruct the UK Delegation to the IMF and the International Bank for </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) in Washington to find out what planning was in </p>
<p>hand and encourage further work. </p>
<p><b>845. </b> The record also stated that the Cabinet Office would consult departments on the </p>
<p>best way to influence US thinking on whether the US or UN should lead an interim </p>
<p>administration before the second round of US/UK discussions later in the year.</p>
<p><b>846. </b> Two weeks later, at the 29 November meeting of the AHGI, it was reported that </p>
<p>the FCO would start work on a further paper on the UN role in post-Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>Iraq “to help bridge the gap with US thinking”.</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> That paper and the FCO paper on SSR </p>
<p>would need to be shared with the US before the next bilateral discussions.</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Mr Fernie produced a separate summary of the main points discussed at the AHGI </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>848. </b> Mr Chaplin discussed post-conflict issues with Mr William Burns, State Department </p>
<p>Assistant Secretary Near East, on 22 November.</p>
<p>409</p>
<p> Mr Burns suggested that the </p>
<p>US would want to follow the 6 November Washington talks with a visit to London in </p>
<p>December or, if necessary, January. Mr Chaplin said the UK was working on a paper on </p>
<p>the shape of a post-conflict administration of Iraq, the issue on which “the US and UK </p>
<p>still seemed furthest apart”. </p>
<p><b>849. </b> The FCO paper on post-conflict administration was shared with the US on </p>
<p>12 December.</p>
<p>410</p>
<p><b>Post-Saddam Hussein oil contracts</b></p>
<p><b>850.  During October and November 2002, UK oil companies expressed concern to </b></p>
<p><b>the Government about securing future oil contracts in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>851.  Sir David Manning raised the issue with Dr Rice in early December.</b></p>
<p><b>852. </b> An oil industry representative called on Mr Chaplin on 2 October, warning that </p>
<p>“by sticking to the rules over Iraq and not going for post-sanctions contracts”, major UK </p>
<p>oil companies would lose out.</p>
<p>411</p>
<p> He was concerned that some other countries would </p>
<p>sell their support for US policy for a guarantee that existing deals with the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>would be honoured. Mr Chaplin explained that the FCO was “seized of the issue” and </p>
<p>“determined to get a fair slice of the action for UK companies”.</p>
<p><b>853. </b> On 25 October, Mr Brenton reported a conversation with Vice President Cheney’s </p>
<p>office, in which he had been told that Mr Cheney was about to discuss Iraqi oil contracts </p>
<p>with Mr Yevgeny Primakov, the former Russian Prime Minister. Mr Brenton was advised </p>
<p>that Mr Primakov would be told the “bids of those countries which co-operated with the </p>
<p>US over Iraq would be looked at more sympathetically than those which did not”.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>854. </b> UK companies’ concerns persisted. Representatives of BP, Shell and British </p>
<p>Gas discussed the issue with Baroness Symons on 31 October.</p>
<p>413</p>
<p> Baroness Symons </p>
<p>reported to Mr Straw that she had said:</p>
<p>“… we could not make any definitive undertakings, given our determination that any </p>
<p>action in relation to Iraq is prompted by our concerns over WMD, and not a desire </p>
<p>for commercial gains.</p>
<p>“However, I undertook to draw this issue to your attention as a matter of urgency. </p>
<p>They were genuinely convinced that deals were being struck and that British </p>
<p>interests are being left to one side.”</p>

<p><b>855. </b> BP raised its concerns with Mr Brenton in Washington the same day.</p>
<p>415</p>
<p><b>856. </b> On 6 November, the FCO hosted a presentation on Iraqi energy given by a team </p>
<p>from BP.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> The presentation spelt out Iraq’s importance to oil companies: it had the </p>
<p>second largest proven oil reserves in the world and “unique ‘yet to find’ potential”, but the </p>
<p>oil industry was “a mess” and had to run fast to stand still. </p>
<p><b>857. </b> The record of the seminar was sent to Mr Powell and Sir David Manning as </p>
<p>evidence of why Iraq was so important to BP.</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>858. </b> Mr Powell sent it to Mr Blair, who asked: “but what do we do about it?”</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>859. </b> BP called on Mr Brenton in Washington again on 11 November.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> Sir Christopher </p>
<p>Meyer told Sir David Manning that UK oil companies had been told by the Embassy that </p>
<p>“US motivation as regards Iraq parallels our own: this is a matter of national security, not </p>
<p>oil … Nevertheless, the rumours persist.” </p>
<p><b>860. </b> Sir Christopher continued:</p>
<p>“We have seen a report from our team at CENTCOM which suggests that the </p>
<p>Pentagon has already awarded a contract to Kellogg, Brown and Root, a subsidiary </p>
<p>of Haliburton, to restore the Iraqi oil industry to production levels of 3m bpd </p>
<p>[barrels per day]. (Haliburton is of course, the company of which Cheney was </p>
<p>previously chairman). We have so far been unable to obtain collateral for this from </p>
<p>the Administration, and it might well in any case amount to no more than prudent </p>
<p>contingency planning to stabilise Iraqi oil facilities if Saddam attempts to damage </p>
<p>them in a conflict.</p>
<p>“Either way, there is clearly an issue here which we need to tackle. Raising it in an </p>
<p>effective way with the Administration is a delicate matter. My view remains that the </p>
<p>only realistic way in to this is via a PM intervention with Bush … The points to make </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Once Saddam has been disarmed … Iraq’s oil industry will be central to … </p>
<p>economic recovery.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We, as you, have energy majors who have skills and resources to help …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To give the lie to suggestions that this campaign is all about oil, it is vitally </p>
<p>important that, once sanctions are lifted, there is seen to be a level playing field </p>
<p>for all companies to work in Iraq.”</p>

<p><b>861. </b> Sir Christopher advised that this was the least the UK should do. He had been </p>
<p>advised by Mr James A Baker III, the former US Secretary of State, to put down a </p>

<p><b>862. </b> Sir David Manning raised oil and gas contracts with Dr Rice in Washington on </p>
<p>9 December.</p>
<p>420</p>
<p> He hoped UK energy companies “would be treated fairly and not </p>
<p>overlooked if Saddam left the scene”. Dr Rice commented that it would be particularly </p>
<p>unjust if companies that had observed sanctions since 1991, a category which included </p>
<p>UK companies, were not among the beneficiaries of post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. </p>
<p><b>863. </b> UK and US policies on Iraqi oil and efforts to secure contracts for UK companies </p>
<p>hoping to do business in Iraq are described in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>UK military options</b></p>
<p><b>864.  In November, the UK received a formal US request for UK military support in </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq, including for post-conflict operations.</b></p>
<p><b>865.  Lt Gen Reith submitted four proposals for the deployment of UK forces to the </b></p>
<p><b>Chiefs of Staff, one for the North and three for the South. </b></p>
<p><b>866.  The Inquiry has not seen any detailed analysis underpinning Lt Gen Reith’s </b></p>
<p><b>conclusion that the South of Iraq would be more manageable in the post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>period than the North.</b></p>
<p><b>867.  Adm Boyce directed that the North should remain the focus of UK planners </b></p>
<p><b>at that time. </b></p>
<p><b>868. </b> On 18 November, Mr Hoon’s office informed No.10, the Cabinet Office, the </p>
<p>FCO and Sir Christopher Meyer that Mr Hoon had received a formal US request for </p>
<p>UK assistance with a military campaign in Iraq (see Section 6.1), including provision </p>
<p>of “financial/material resources for a military campaign and for post-conflict efforts” </p>
<p>and “constabulary forces and humanitarian assistance as part of post-conflict stability </p>
<p>efforts”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>869. </b> Lt Gen Reith submitted a paper to the Chiefs of Staff on 18 November setting out </p>
<p>northern and southern options for a UK land contribution in Iraq (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He advised the Chiefs to think about “where we wish to be at the end of Phase III </p>

<p><b>870. </b> On the northern option, Lt Gen Reith advised:</p>
<p>“This could result in UK long-term leadership of the region during post-conflict </p>
<p>operations: a position which the US would appear to favour. It would be a </p>
<p>challenging area to control and develop, particularly in preserving regional stability </p>
<p>between the Turks, Kurds and Sunnis. Whilst the UK has the necessary experience </p>
<p>and capability, the challenges do need to be assessed in line with UK strategic </p>
<p>guidance …” </p>
<p><b>871. </b> The post-conflict responsibilities in the South were presented as being more </p>
<p>manageable:</p>
<p>“A post-conflict positioning of the UK division in the South could be attractive. The </p>
<p>range of problems appears less complex and diverse, the long-term force structure </p>
<p>requirements could be reduced and local conditions are likely to be more conducive </p>
<p>to development and influence. The Northern Arabian Gulf (NAG) is also a traditional </p>
<p>area of UK influence.”</p>
<p><b>872.  The MOD advised No.10 that post-conflict considerations needed to “guide </b></p>
<p><b>thinking” on the conflict phase of operations and that the post-conflict phase </b></p>
<p><b>would be “a challenge in its own right”. </b></p>

<p> The letter was copied to Mr Straw’s Private Office, Mr Brown’s </p>

<p><b>875. </b> Mr Watkins highlighted the importance of the “aftermath”: </p>
<p>“Our own work has increasingly convinced us that the aftermath of any military </p>
<p>action will be a challenge in its own right. This needs to guide thinking on the conflict </p>
<p>phase for all sorts of reasons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>However successful the conflict phase, a badly-handled aftermath would make </p>
<p>our intervention a net failure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Day 1 of conflict will also be Day 1 of the aftermath for some parts of Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The nature of the conflict will influence the type of aftermath we find ourselves </p>
<p>managing: in particular, Iraqi behaviour will have a big impact on the scale of the </p>
<p>humanitarian and reconstruction tasks that might emerge.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The forces we commit to conflict will also have to deal with the initial phase of </p>
<p>the aftermath, simply by virtue of being there. And of course their location in the </p>
<p>conflict phase will largely determine their post-conflict role …</p>

<p>We also need to bear in mind that the aftermath could arise with little or no prior </p>
<p>conflict, in the event that the regime collapses under pressure. Although the US </p>
<p>tend to believe that the regime would indeed collapse very quickly, their thinking </p>
<p>on the aftermath is, paradoxically, focused almost entirely on managing a post-</p>
<p>conflict scenario.”</p>
<p><b>876. </b> Mr Watkins added that the US recognised the importance of aftermath planning, </p>
<p>but their thinking remained:</p>
<p>“… somewhat immature, fitting the problem to their pre-conceived solution. In </p>
<p>particular … they continue to have difficulty understanding why anybody might think </p>
<p>that some kind of UN umbrella will be important in the aftermath stage. We need to </p>
<p>keep trying to inject realism into their thinking.”</p>
<p><b>877. </b> Mr Watkins reported that Mr Hoon believed the UK should:</p>
<p>“Continue trying to influence US thinking on the aftermath, recognising that this is </p>
<p>not something which can be neatly separated from any conflict phase (and indeed, </p>
<p>might arise without conflict at all).”</p>

<p><b>885. </b> Others focused on the importance of humanitarian contingency planning. The point </p>
<p>was put most forcefully by Mr Peter Luff (Conservative): </p>
<p>“There is a strong view held with great sincerity by many UN Member States that </p>
<p>to prepare for a humanitarian crisis is to acknowledge the inevitability of war. I do </p>
<p>not accept that argument. To prepare for the worst is not to wish for the worst, and </p>
<p>we should prepare for the worst. Indeed, that may have the incidental advantage </p>
<p>of reinforcing in Saddam Hussein’s mind the seriousness of the international </p>
<p>community’s purpose. Please let us do more to prepare for the humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences of a war that none of us want.”</p>

<p><b>886. </b> Dr Jenny Tonge (Liberal Democrat) asked Mr Straw to consider “unfinished </p>
<p>business” elsewhere in the world:</p>
<p>“Do we have the capacity to cope? In Afghanistan, only $1bn has so far been </p>
<p>committed out of the billions that were promised, and 70 percent of that has been </p>
<p>spent on humanitarian aid. There is no security in Afghanistan outside Kabul, </p>
<p>Afghanistan has asked for an extension of the international security assistance </p>
<p>force, but where will the extra help come from? Will it come from the United States </p>
<p>or from Britain? Where will it come from if we are facing war in Iraq and the Middle </p>
<p>East? Very little progress has been made in Afghanistan despite the promises of the </p>
<p>Prime Minister. It is unfinished business. </p>
<p>“Many members have rightly referred to the difficult situation in the Middle East … </p>
<p>more unfinished business.</p>
<p>“For many people, the Balkans are a distant memory, but it is still a very unstable </p>
<p>region … This year, only six percent of the aid promised in the famous Marshall Plan </p>
<p>for the Balkans has been delivered. That is yet more unfinished business. We are </p>

<p> The CCS assessed that:</p>
<p>“The most important factor within the UK will be public confidence and its extension, </p>

<p>that everyday life and services have been altered and the terrorist threat increased </p>

<p>The longer dislocation lasts, particularly if there are major terrorist incidents, the </p>
<p>greater the likelihood of real disruptive challenges emerging. The extent to which </p>
<p>military operations have public support is also important. A strong patriotic factor will </p>
<p>restrain disruption and increase tolerance of minor inconveniences.”</p>
<p><b>893. </b> The CCS formed a number of other “key judgements”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Oil price rises would be the main economic factor. “General uncertainty” would </p>
<p>affect the stock market and, possibly, domestic consumer spending. Tourism and </p>
<p>air travel would be affected by dislocation of routes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The potential for further protests by anti-war groups and ethnic groups and </p>
<p>counter-demonstrations would increase. There was “opportunity for violent </p>
<p>confrontations between protest groups, ethnic groups, or targeted against ethnic </p>
<p>groups, particularly in the aftermath of a major terrorist incident”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The firefighters’ dispute would probably go ahead.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Heightened anxiety about terrorist attacks was likely to cause increased </p>
<p>disruption from hoaxes and false alarms. The JIC assessed that the threat from </p>
<p>Al Qaida and Islamic extremist groups remained “high”. “Al Qaida and other </p>
<p>Islamic extremists will seek to exploit the circumstances of a war situation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military resources would be unavailable to cover industrial action contingencies </p>
<p>other than the firefighters’ dispute. A call up of medical Reservists would </p>
<p>probably affect NHS provision.</p>
<p><b>894. </b> The CCS stated that contingency planning by departments was in hand. In many </p>
<p>cases, existing contingency plans were “adaptable to the circumstances arising from </p>
<p>operations against Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>895. </b> The CCS paper continued to be updated until January 2003, when the AHGI </p>

<p> The meeting agreed that it would be important to cost each </p>

<p><b>899. </b> Mr Fernie set out his understanding of Ms Short’s position in an internal email the </p>
<p>following week: </p>
<p>“... HMT have been talking to MOD only about the military costs without taking into </p>
<p>account the costs to the international community of any humanitarian response, </p>
<p>post-Saddam transitional administration and/or reconstruction …”</p>
<p>434</p>

<p>find substantial funds for such work from its existing budgets. Mr Fernie explained that </p>
<p>DFID was trying to “cobble together some figures of possible costs – all a bit speculative </p>
<p>… but the point at this stage is to get others in Whitehall thinking about it.”</p>

<p>or the Treasury in costing “various scenarios”.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> Mr Drummond and the AHGI had both </p>
<p>given a “clear negative response”. The Cabinet Office position was that if DFID thought </p>
<p>it would incur unaffordable extra costs, it should bid to the Treasury. DFID’s Conflict and </p>
<p>Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) was working up preliminary costings, “but we </p>
<p>currently have no consumer for the product”. Mr Fernie asked how and when to report </p>
<p>back to Ms Short. </p>
<p><b>902. </b> Dr Brewer replied that she had spoken to Mr Ricketts who had been:</p>
<p>“… slightly more willing to acknowledge that the likely costs … should be factored </p>
<p>into the decision-making process. But I got no sense at all that the FCO would either </p>
<p>push for this or support us in doing so. Their sense is that the Prime Minister’s mind </p>
<p>will be made up by other factors.”</p>
<p>436</p>
<p><b>903. </b> Dr Brewer suggested that the issue be raised with Sir David Manning or other </p>
<p>Permanent Secretaries by Mr Chakrabarti, or at Cabinet by Ms Short. </p>
<p><b>904. </b> DFID officials reported the lack of progress to Ms Short on 10 December.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Ms Short agreed that officials should raise US and DFID cost estimates at the next </p>

<p>with the Treasury. It was also important to ensure that all costings included military and </p>

<p>I think invoking my help, saying ‘We are not satisfied that we are learning enough on </p>

<p><b>915. </b> Mr Webb was reported to be “clearly focused on aftermath planning”. Dr Brewer </p>
<p>set out Ms Short’s interest in “post-conflict stabilisation strategies” and agreed that she </p>
<p>(Dr Brewer) and he should discuss the issue on 10 January.</p>
<p><b>916. </b> The record also stated that the meetings had confirmed that little thought was </p>
<p>being given to humanitarian operations. Dr Brewer raised the issue of a stabilisation </p>
<p>force and stated that: “Making a demonstrable (and rapid) difference to the civil </p>
<p>population’s lives was vital to the success of any political-military plan and to wider </p>
<p>regional stability.” Mr Lee “saw the advantage of HMG [Her Majesty’s Government]-wide </p>
<p>discussion”.</p>
<p><b>917. </b> Mr Lee commented afterwards to Lt Gen Pigott: “From a machinery of government </p>
<p>and successful Iraq policy perspective all the arguments are surely in favour of including </p>
<p>… DFID individuals in our discussions.”</p>
<p>444</p>
<p> He explained that No.10 would not, however, </p>
<p>accept this:</p>
<p>“At David Manning’s meeting today … when asked by Peter Ricketts whether </p>
<p>DFID could attend the COBR(R), David had immediately said ‘no’. This was on </p>
<p>the grounds that DFID officials would feel bound to report what they had heard to </p>

<p>for me, as the relevant DG, as well as the Permanent Secretary also to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>924. </b> On 29 November, the FCO Board discussed priorities for the coming months, </p>
<p>including reviewing Iraq policy and planning:</p>
<p>“The Board agreed that the possibility of war in Iraq would remain the prime  </p>
<p>focus of attention over the next months. It discussed contingency plans being put  </p>
<p>in place. Work was in hand on staffing and establishing emergency units. </p>
<p>Procedures were due to be tested in January … Board members stressed the need </p>
<p>to keep the level of threat under review; and to keep examining and testing out the </p>
<p>contingency plans.”</p>
<p>447</p>
<p><b>925. </b> The Board also discussed whether further costs were likely to arise in the context </p>
<p>of Iraq contingency planning. The MOD had already placed a claim on the Reserve and </p>
<p>there was a strong case for an FCO claim “which would be strengthened if we could </p>
<p>point to clear decisions being taken now to prioritise our spending”. </p>
<p><b>926. </b> FCO claims on the Reserve are addressed in Section 13.1. </p>
<p><b>927. </b> A paper on FCO prioritisation was prepared for the Board in March 2003 and is </p>
<p>described in Section 6.5. </p>
<p><b>928. </b> On 2 December, Mr Ricketts sent Sir Michael Jay advice on “preparations for </p>
<p>handling an all-out Iraq crisis”.</p>
<p>448</p>
<p> In a brief description of how the FCO was “already </p>
<p>geared up to deal with the increased intensity of work on Iraq”, he included references </p>
<p>to the procurement of items for the future Baghdad Embassy, contingency planning for </p>
<p>CBW protection in the region, and consular contingency planning. Most of the advice </p>
<p>addressed the role of the FCO Emergency Unit and choreography of departmental </p>
<p>meetings. </p>
<p><b>929. </b> Mr Ricketts explained that he held daily meetings at 9.00am to co-ordinate FCO </p>
<p>activity, chaired in his absence by another FCO Board member or Mr Chaplin. He also </p>
<p>described the Iraq-related responsibilities of FCO senior officials:</p>
<p>“William Ehrman [Director General Defence and Intelligence] deals with JIC and </p>
<p>MOD, Graham Fry [Director General Wider World] supervises work on consular </p>
<p>planning …; Edward Chaplin and Charles Gray take the lead on policy advice, </p>
<p>working with DSI for longer range thinking, with the UN and CFSP [Common Foreign </p>
<p>and Security Policy] teams, with the Legal Advisers and others. I have deliberately </p>
<p>involved a wide spread of senior managers, because we may well have to sustain </p>
<p>an intense crisis for a significant period …</p>
<p>“You will of course want to be closely involved in all the policy-making. One of the </p>
<p>key tasks of the Emergency Unit is to prepare the Foreign Secretary and you for the </p>
<p>[anticipated] No.10 meetings, to ensure the FCO is pro-active and thinking ahead. </p>
<p>I propose to take responsibility under you as overall co-ordinator …</p>

<p>“MED and Personnel Command discussed again this week the staff numbers </p>
<p>required to produce this structure, and other essential augmentation (for example, </p>
<p>for the Press Office and Consular Division) … But it will be vital that the Board meets </p>
<p>early and decides which tasks can fall away …</p>
<p>“This all looks unwieldy, but I am confident that it will work … In managing this, the </p>
<p>trick will be to have a clear co-ordinating and tasking arrangement, without vast </p>
<p>meetings … We will need to keep [overseas] posts well briefed and targeted, while </p>

<p><b>930. </b> The Inquiry has seen no response to Mr Ricketts from Sir Michael Jay.</p>
<p><b>931. </b> The first Iraq morning meeting for which the Inquiry has seen a record was on  </p>
<p>24 December.</p>
<p>449</p>
<p> From 11 February 2003, Mr Ricketts chaired a second policy meeting </p>
<p>most evenings.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p> The records of each morning and evening meeting were sent to </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay’s office and copied widely in the FCO, to Dr Brewer in DFID, and, from  </p>
<p>3 February 2003, to Dr Simon Cholerton, an official in Sec(O) in the MOD. </p>
<p><b>932. </b> The records show that most meetings focused on negotiations at the UN. </p>
<p>Post-conflict issues, including the preparation of briefing for No.10, key meetings with </p>
<p>the US, and DFID’s humanitarian preparations, were also discussed, but were often </p>
<p>reported in less detail.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>937. </b> The first draft of the FCO report had been produced in March 2002, in response </p>
<p>to a request from Mr Blair for information on Saddam Hussein’s record of human rights </p>
<p>abuses, for publication alongside a paper on WMD.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>938. </b> The development of a communications strategy on Iraq and the preparation of the </p>
<p>Iraq dossier, which incorporated some material on human rights abuses, are addressed </p>
<p>in Section 4.2.</p>
<p><b>939. </b> The FCO report published on 2 December was “based on the testimony of Iraqi </p>
<p>exiles, evidence gathered by UN rapporteurs and human rights organisations, and </p>
<p>intelligence material”.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> It examined “Iraq’s record on torture, the treatment of women, </p>
<p>prison conditions, arbitrary and summary killings, the persecution of the Kurds and the </p>
<p>Shia, the harassment of opposition figures outside Iraq and the occupation of Kuwait”.</p>
<p><b>940. </b> Mr Straw explained to the <i>BBC</i> that the report was being published “because it is </p>
<p>important that people understand the comprehensive evil that is Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>941. </b> The report was criticised by some as an attempt to influence public opinion in </p>
<p>favour of war.</p>
<p>455</p>
<p><b>942. </b> On 11 December, in response to a request in October for more work on the </p>
<p>criminal prosecution of Saddam Hussein and his inner circle, the FCO sent No.10 </p>
<p>a paper on a possible international criminal tribunal for Iraq.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>943. </b> The covering letter explained that, as requested, the question of a tribunal was </p>
<p>being factored into Whitehall work on the future of Iraq. Officials had discussed the issue </p>
<p>at the Washington talks on 6 November and consulted the State Department’s War </p>
<p>Crimes Office. The US did not appear to favour an international tribunal for Iraq along </p>
<p>the lines of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) and was </p>
<p>giving close consideration to the Sierra Leone Special Court model.</p>
<p>457</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>944. </b> On the question of whether to circulate information about potential indictees in </p>
<p>order to encourage them to break with Saddam Hussein, the FCO advised that there </p>
<p>were various lists of possible targets in existence, including a list of 27 published by </p>
<p>the Iraqi National Congress and a secret list produced by the US containing about </p>
<p>40 names, but that it would be inappropriate for a government to issue a list as it would </p>
<p>pre-empt the role of the eventual prosecutor. It might also encourage those on the list to </p>

<p>resist to the end or to abscond. For those reasons, the US was cautious about the idea. </p>
<p>The FCO intended to stay in touch with the State Department as thinking on transitional </p>
<p>justice developed. </p>
<p><b>945. </b> The FCO advised that prosecution of the range of allegations against Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime might require a combination of different judicial institutions. Issues to </p>
<p>consider included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the capacity of the domestic criminal justice system, which was likely to need </p>
<p>“substantial re-building and re-training to restore it as an independent and </p>
<p>effective body”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the difficulty of finding a legal basis for a number of the options if the UN was not </p>
<p>involved in the administration of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s wish not to be associated with the death penalty, which remained </p>
<p>extant in Iraqi law; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>categorisation of offenders, which might include:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>political and military leaders;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>others contributing to the commission of international crimes;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>perpetrators of serious domestic crimes such as murder; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>those responsible for lesser offences.</p>
<p><b>946. </b> Those issues were considered further by officials after the second round of </p>
<p>inter-agency talks in Washington on 22 January 2003 (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>947.  In a series of papers on post-conflict Iraq prepared in mid-December and </b></p>
<p><b>shared with the US, the FCO identified:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>possible middle ground between UK and US positions on the post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>role of the UN;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the need for more information on the capabilities of Iraq’s civil service;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the need to put SSR at the centre of post-conflict work;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the risk of underplaying the importance of “Islamic forces in Iraq”;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the need to improve economic conditions as quickly as possible; and</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the importance of maintaining firm control of the internal security </b></p>
<p><b>situation.</b></p>
<p><b>948.  The British Embassy Amman also highlighted the tainted image of the UN in </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq. It stated that a UN-led interim administration would be preferable to a US-led </b></p>
<p><b>one, but would come in for much the same criticism from Iraqis.</b></p>
<p><b>949. </b> On 12 December, the FCO handed four papers to Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, </p>
<p>US Ambassador at large for Free Iraqis, who was visiting London for the conference of </p>
<p>the Iraqi Opposition from 14 to 17 December:</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>950. </b> It is not clear from the documents seen by the Inquiry which paper on war crimes </p>
<p>was handed to Ambassador Khalilzad. It seems most likely to have been the FCO paper </p>
<p>published on 2 December, but could have been the paper on a tribunal for Iraq, which </p>
<p>had been sent to No.10 on 11 December after a series of discussions on the subject </p>
<p>between the FCO and the US Government. </p>
<p><b>951. </b> The first three papers were tabled at the AHGI on 13 December. </p>
<p><b>952. </b> The Cabinet Office undertook to circulate the paper on war crimes later. </p>
<p>FCO PAPER: ‘INTERIM ADMINISTRATIONS IN IRAQ’</p>
<p><b>953. </b> The FCO paper on interim administrations shared with US on 12 December was a </p>
<p>response to the differences between the US and UK positions at the Washington talks </p>
<p>on 6 November and was described as “work in progress”.</p>
<p>459</p>
<p> The paper was tabled at the </p>
<p>AHGI on 13 December. It is not clear who contributed to the draft. </p>
<p><b>954. </b> The FCO paper set out the likely short- and medium-term functions of an interim </p>
<p>administration, ranging from destruction of WMD stockpiles to reintegration of refugees. </p>
<p>It cautioned:</p>
<p>“We cannot be sure of the scale of the problem before we encounter it (although we </p>
<p>believe the US has done a lot of work in this area, particularly with the Iraqi exile </p>
<p>community). Iraq has a reputation for being one of the better-run Arab countries with </p>
<p>a well-educated civil service. But we have little first hand evidence of how things </p>
<p>work nowadays. We need more information, and we are working with academics, </p>
<p>the Iraqi exile community and our posts on this in order to tackle the following </p>
<p>questions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To what extent are ministries infiltrated by Ba’athist elements? How central </p>
<p>are the Ba’athists to the functioning of the ministries? Can the ministries work </p>
<p>without them?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How far do the Ba’athists have to be removed to ensure loyalty to an interim </p>
<p>administration?</p>

<p>What has been the effect on good government of coping with sanctions? How </p>
<p>much activity has moved to the ‘black market’? How do we move black market </p>
<p>activity back into the legitimate sector?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To what extent have government practices become corrupted by non-</p>
<p>transparent control over oil revenues?”</p>
<p><b>955. </b> The FCO recognised that there were benefits and drawbacks with the US and </p>
<p>UN models, and suggested a “third way”:</p>
<p>“… a potential middle ground in which security requirements could be provided </p>
<p>by Coalition Forces, answerable only to US leadership, and all other functions of </p>
<p>administration provided through the UN. Or the tasks of an IA could be divided up so </p>
<p>that US-led Coalition Forces retained the lead on some – eg defence, WMD, security </p>
<p>sector reform – working alongside a UN-led civil interim administration.</p>
<p>“To achieve this sort of structure would require some innovative work in the </p>
<p>UN Security Council …”</p>
<p><b>956. </b> The FCO concluded that international legitimacy was crucial to many aspects of </p>
<p>the interim administration’s mission and would be very difficult to achieve under US </p>
<p>leadership. In the short term, the US-led model looked more likely to succeed, especially </p>
<p>in the areas of SSR and WMD. Wider political and economic reforms were more likely </p>
<p>to endure in the long term if the interim authority worked under UN auspices and </p>
<p>maximised the contribution of Iraqis.</p>
<p><b>957. </b> Comments on the paper from the British Embassy Amman were included in </p>
<p>an annex:</p>
<p>“The crucial issue here is timing. If the US or UN were to control the initial period of </p>
<p>post-conflict transition, their presence is likely to be accepted (if it brings peace and </p>
<p>not a worse situation). This stage should not be long enough for the US or the UN </p>
<p>to start expanding their duties beyond simply keeping the peace and avoiding major </p>
<p>humanitarian problems.”</p>
<p><b>958. </b> The Embassy warned that the “fervour that could be whipped up” by any US </p>
<p>attempt to run major Iraqi government departments “could be enough to endanger the </p>
<p>international community’s ability to affect the process of change at all”. Equally:</p>
<p>“Whilst a UN-led authority would be undoubtedly better than a US-led one, the UN </p>
<p>now has such a tainted image in Iraq that a UN-led IA would come in for much the </p>
<p>same criticism. (The UN is felt to be under the control of the US anyway.)”</p>
<p><b>959. </b> The Embassy concluded:</p>
<p>“There is a small group of Iraqis inside Iraq who could be trusted/used to bring </p>
<p>about change in a transitional phase. They would need to be bolstered by Iraqi </p>
<p>professionals willing to return from abroad.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>“An interim authority would be best run by the Iraqis themselves with long-term </p>
<p>technical and financial support from the international community. (The UK is in </p>
<p>a particularly strong position to do this – we still maintain the image of being </p>
<p>professional and knowledgeable!)” </p>
<p>FCO PAPER: ‘IRAQ: SECURITY SECTOR REFORM’</p>
<p><b>960. </b> During October and November, the FCO produced a number of drafts of a paper </p>
<p>on SSR, one of which informed the 1 November Cabinet Office paper on models for </p>
<p>post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>961. </b> The last version seen by the Inquiry, dated 10 December, described SSR as a key </p>
<p>task which, if carried out successfully, “should lead to Iraq giving up its attachment to </p>
<p>WMD, dismantling its oppressive network of spies, informers and secret police, scaling </p>
<p>down its huge armed forces and reforming its criminal justice system”.</p>
<p>461</p>
<p> If SSR went </p>
<p>well, Iraq would be “much less likely to pose the same threat to the region and its own </p>
<p>people”. The process would be shaped to a degree by post-conflict stabilisation and </p>
<p>should be seen within the overall policy framework of promoting good government. </p>
<p>There was a particularly clear overlap between SSR and those wider issues in areas of </p>
<p>police and judicial reform, about which the UK knew little. </p>
<p><b>962. </b> The paper listed the questions that any SSR plan for Iraq must answer:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What security structures would be appropriate? That required an assessment of </p>
<p>the internal and external threats to Iraq and knowledge of its future constitutional </p>
<p>shape.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Who should be in charge? SSR in Afghanistan had been hampered by the </p>
<p>lack of international institutional architecture: “In Iraq’s case, we should give a </p>
<p>higher priority to organising SSR much earlier, ie ideally before military action … </p>
<p>Good articulation between the body charged with overseeing SSR and the post </p>
<p>S[addam] H[ussein] interim administration will be critical.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Methodology. How far should the exclusion of members of the Tikriti clan be </p>
<p>taken? The inner circle of security agencies around Saddam Hussein were ripe </p>
<p>for abolition, but what about the civilian police and the judiciary?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DDR. What mechanisms were need to bring perpetrators of crimes against </p>
<p>humanity to justice? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Qualitative and quantitative change. How to reform the security sector to operate </p>
<p>on the basis of humanitarian values in support of a legitimate government?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Accountability. How to establish the principle of civilian oversight?</p>

<p><b>963. </b> The FCO described the paper as a “living document” and highlighted some </p>
<p>emerging themes, including the need:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to put SSR at the centre of post-conflict work, unlike in Afghanistan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to establish a UK working group to start the detailed assessment of “a number </p>

<p>academics on the issue;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to involve the new Iraqi administration in the process as early as possible;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to find out more about the judiciary and the civilian police; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for Ministers to decide the level of engagement “given our limited and stretched </p>

<p><b>965. </b> The Government has been unable to supply evidence of activity by the SSR </p>
<p>working group.</p>
<p>FCO PAPER: ‘ISLAMISM IN IRAQ’</p>
<p><b>966. </b> The FCO paper on Islamism in Iraq, written by DSI, described Iraq as “a relatively </p>
<p>secular state”, but warned:</p>
<p>“Many of the models for possible future governments, whether representative or </p>
<p>even democratic, proposed by commentators, are broadly secular too. This may be </p>
<p>the preferred outcome, but there is a risk we underplay the importance of Islamic </p>
<p>forces in Iraq.</p>
<p>“In any period of post-Saddam political instability, it is likely groups will be looking </p>
<p>for identities and ideologies on which to base movements. Ba’athism will have </p>
<p>been largely discredited. Communism is no longer the force it once was in Iraq. </p>
<p>Islamism, ethnicity and nationalism are obvious alternatives. This paper considers </p>
<p>the possibility that Islamism emerges as one of the main organising principles for </p>
<p>Iraqis.”</p>
<p>463</p>

<p>“We do not expect a massive surge in extremist sentiment”. The Shia were </p>
<p>unlikely to repeat the 1991 mistake of calling for a Khomeinist regime, a move </p>
<p>which had alienated many Iraqis who might have joined them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A number of extremist groups were likely to use violence to pursue their political </p>
<p>ends.</p>
<p><b>968. </b> The FCO proposed a number of “practical steps” to provide stability.</p>
<p><b>969. </b> In the short term, support for more extreme groups could be limited by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>avoiding Shia shrines and important religious buildings during military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving economic conditions as quickly as possible;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>winning hearts and minds through public information and media campaigns;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>discouraging meddling by Iran and other regional players;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining Israel’s neutrality during military action and making progress on </p>
<p>Israel/Palestine; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Maintaining firm control on the internal security situation and moving quickly to </p>
<p>suppress any international terrorist groups in the country.”</p>
<p><b>970. </b> The FCO suggested that, in order to ensure longer-term stability and development, </p>
<p>there would be an overriding interest in the rapid emergence of “a political class with </p>
<p>whom we can do business”. Focusing on pro-Western groups would be short-sighted. </p>
<p>It could create:</p>
<p>“… a further breeding ground for resentment, extremism and ultimately terrorism </p>
<p>directed both against any new regime and Western targets. It would be seen as </p>
<p>another example of Western hostility to Islam and double standards. It would be a </p>
<p>recipe for longer-term instability.” </p>
<p>Instead, Islamist groups and religious leaders should be involved in the creation of the </p>
<p>new Iraqi political system. </p>
<p><b>971. </b> The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should plan on the basis that political Islam will be a significant force in many </p>
<p>of the post-Saddam scenarios …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should work to limit the support the extremist elements receive …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should look to engage those moderate groups which are willing to work </p>
<p>with us, even if they disagree strongly with some of our values. This means </p>
<p>being prepared to accept the emergence of a religiously conservative and </p>
<p>anti-Western regime if that is what Iraqis want.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The approach the Americans adopt will be crucial. We should engage them on </p>
<p>this issue.”</p>

<p><b>972. </b> On 30 December, Sir Michael Jay asked Mr Gray a number of questions about </p>
<p>post-conflict issues, including how far FCO papers on post-conflict issues had been </p>
<p>shared with the US and major EU partners.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p><b>973. </b> Dr Amanda Tanfield, Head of Iraq Section in MED, reported:</p>
<p>“Almost all the UK papers have been shared with the US. We have only withheld </p>
<p>from them papers which have been overtaken by others that we have passed to </p>
<p>them.</p>
<p>“We have been more selective with EU partners. Foreign ministry officials in France </p>
<p>and Germany received the early planners [DSI] papers on ‘Scenarios for the Future </p>
<p>of Iraq after Saddam’ and ‘Consequences of Conflict for the Region’. We have given </p>
<p>the French planners … the paper on ‘Islamism in Iraq’.</p>
<p>“The difficulty with sharing a lot of thinking on day after with EU partners is that </p>
<p>day after assumes regime change, which is difficult territory for many of them, </p>
<p>particularly Germany. And some of the more recent papers have been drafted in the </p>
<p>context of the ongoing UK-US official level day after talks, with the US readership </p>
<p>very much in mind.”</p>
<p>465</p>
<p><b>974. </b> In January 2003, Mr Chilcott commented that the UK had received little in return </p>
<p>from the US (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>975. </b> Other issues raised by Sir Michael Jay on 30 December included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether DFID’s concerns about involvement in Iraq policy had been resolved; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the FCO had financial and other contingency plans if more close </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>979. </b> In late November, representatives of six Iraqi exile groups called on Mr Gray to </p>
<p>seek “permission” to hold a conference of opposition groups in London after plans to </p>
<p>hold it in Brussels had fallen through.</p>
<p>468</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>980. </b> Mr Gray informed Mr Straw’s Private Office that he had made it clear to the group </p>
<p>that he had no authority to authorise or prevent such a meeting and that they must make </p>
<p>their own arrangements and abide by the law. He had also made it clear that attendance </p>
<p>by Mr Blair or Mr Straw was “out of the question”. Mr Gray recommended against </p>
<p>attendance by a Minister or senior official, but advised that “it would be right to send a </p>
<p>relatively junior observer perhaps from Research Analysts”.</p>
<p><b>981. </b> Mr Gray held to that view after the US informed the FCO that it would send “a </p>
<p>large and senior delegation, probably led by Zalmay Khalilzad, Senior Director … at </p>
<p>the National Security Council and Ambassador at large to the Iraqi Opposition”.</p>
<p>469</p>
<p> Mr </p>
<p>Gray advised Mr Straw’s Private Office that the US had not urged the UK to raise the </p>
<p>level of its attendance and there was no reason to do so. The event was “unlikely to </p>
<p>be an edifying one, and I think we should be wary of association with it, even to please </p>
<p>the Americans”. </p>
<p><b>Iraqi opposition meetings in the UK</b></p>
<p>During 2002, representatives of the Iraqi opposition met in the UK a number of times, </p>
<p>including under the auspices of the State Department’s Future of Iraq Project. In each </p>
<p>case, UK engagement was at junior official level, led by FCO Research Analysts. </p>

<p><b>982. </b> Early in December, the British Embassy Amman issued its November update on </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p> Unlike previous updates, which had only been sent to FCO addressees, the </p>
<p>November report was copied to DFID and DIS. </p>
<p><b>983. </b> The Embassy reported the recent release of all prisoners from Iraqi jails, noting </p>
<p>that the policy had been criticised within and outside Iraq for causing a rise in crime. </p>
<p>It also provided a general assessment of Iraqi public opinion:</p>
<p>“Iraqis do not want a war because they do not know what is next. (But they fully </p>
<p>expect that a war will come) … </p>
<p>“Iraqis do not want a ‘US occupation’ … </p>
<p>“The biggest common denominator to emerge is that the Iraqi people do not know </p>
<p>who to trust. They do not trust the US because they ‘abandoned’ them in 1991. They </p>
<p>do not trust the regime or its religious men. They do not trust the opposition (who are </p>
<p>corrupt or in the pockets of foreign governments). And they do not trust each other </p>
<p>… Any serious discussions tend to take place only within the very inner core of a </p>
<p>family. All this makes an organised revolt seem improbable.”</p>
<p><b>984. </b> Over 300 representatives of a wide range of Iraqi opposition groups attended the </p>
<p>conference in London from 14 to 17 December, which agreed a “Policy Statement of </p>
<p>the Iraqi Opposition”, a paper on the post-Saddam Hussein transition to democracy and </p>
<p>appointed a 65 member co-ordinating committee.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>985. </b> The FCO Research Analyst who attended the event reported “a palpable sense of </p>
<p>relief” at those achievements, but predicted that:</p>
<p>“… given the intense differences displayed over the weekend and the chequered </p>
<p>history of opposition conferences any show of unity is unlikely to last and there are </p>
<p>enough people excluded who will already be briefing the press … [T]he US will be </p>
<p>unhappy at having such an unwieldy 65 to deal with.”</p>
<p>476</p>
<p><b>986. </b> Those conclusions were echoed in the FCO Annual Review for Iraq, written in </p>
<p>January 2003 by Research Analysts in the absence of an embassy in Baghdad.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Review commented extensively on US involvement with Iraqi exiles. The US </p>
<p>had encouraged the Iraqi opposition to convene and fund a conference to overcome </p>
<p>emerging rivalries. After several postponements and changes of venue, the conference </p>
<p>had been held in London and funded by the US. Competition between groups “cast </p>
<p>doubt on whether a credible new front can emerge” and press reports suggested those </p>
<p>groups had been “written out of the US’s Iraq script”. The Review also suggested that </p>

<p><b>987. </b> On 19 December, Mr Masoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party </p>

<p>478</p>
<p> Mr Blair joined the meeting unannounced. </p>
<p><b>988. </b> The briefing prepared for Mr Blair explained that the two party leaders did not know </p>
<p>that he might drop in and that it was not essential that he did so.</p>
<p>479</p>
<p> If he did, he could </p>
<p>ask about the opposition conference and the situation in “Kurdistan”, and should state </p>
<p>that the UK was committed to Iraq’s territorial integrity.</p>

<p><b>Military preparations gather pace</b></p>
<p><b>991.  By December 2002, US military preparations were gathering pace. </b></p>

<p><b>not DFID, that the US military was “gearing up” to be as ready as possible by </b></p>
<p><b>15 February.</b></p>

<p>Mr Blair on the progress of US planning (see Section 6.1).</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>994. </b> Mr Watkins advised Sir David Manning that it was “misleading to talk of firm plans”, </p>
<p>not just because of unresolved practical issues such as Turkish co-operation, but also </p>
<p>because the US political strategy remained “unclear”.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p> There had been “a significant </p>
<p>shift in US military planning” as CENTCOM sought to “reduce the lead times between </p>
<p>a political decision and military action”. Secretary Rumsfeld had signed a number of </p>
<p>deployment orders to take effect in early January, and the US was “increasingly moving </p>
<p>beyond pure planning into at least some actual forward deployments”. </p>

<p>military planning”. He had explained to US officials, “somewhat repetitively”, the need </p>
<p>for an early start to post-conflict planning. Kosovo had shown that civil planning took </p>
<p>longer and was more difficult than military planning. He reported that references to the </p>
<p>UN’s role had caused “an adverse reaction in many circles”, and he had found it more </p>
<p>productive to make the case for the UN as a source of legitimisation and co-ordination </p>
<p>rather than as an executive instrument. </p>
<p><b>996. </b> Mr Webb also reported a “big pitch by the Republican right for making democracy </p>

<p>with another strongman.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Weary Europeans said this was hopelessly unrealistic: modest </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>997. </b> In his next update on US military planning for No.10 on 5 December, Mr Watkins </p>
<p>warned that it was increasingly difficult for the UK to plan without knowing where the UK </p>
<p>land package would be based. In order to keep options open for significant UK military </p>
<p>participation from mid-February onwards, the Armed Forces needed to “press ahead </p>
<p>with further preparations”.</p>
<p>484</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>998. </b> The US had “no formal position on the date by which they must be ready to </p>
<p>act”. It had a wide range of options, but assuming a political decision to take military </p>
<p>action on 15 February (known as “P Day”), the MOD expected the air campaign and </p>
<p>amphibious operations to start in early March. </p>

<p> The event anticipated “rough </p>
<p>going ahead”. On the assumption that, initially, there would be no government in place, </p>
<p>participants were “anticipating chaos”. </p>
<p><b>1001. </b> After a post-event briefing, Lieutenant General George Casey, Director of the </p>

<p>282</p>
<p><b>1004.  The UK’s strategy had to be flexible enough to respond to the situation on </b></p>

<p><b>of Iraq for which the UK might want to accept responsibility “in order to make the </b></p>
<p><b>task of scoping different scenarios possible”. </b></p>
<p><b>1005.  The Inquiry has seen no indication that the urgent, cross-government work </b></p>

<p><b>1006.  Development of the Government’s thinking on the location and extent of </b></p>
<p><b>the UK military Area of Responsibility (AOR) in Iraq is addressed in Sections 6.1 </b></p>
<p><b>and 6.2. </b></p>
<p><b>1007. </b> The introduction to the “aftermath” section of the final, 13 December, edition of </p>
<p>the SPG paper on UK military strategic thinking pulled no punches:</p>
<p>“The aftermath (AM) phase of operations is likely to be the strategically decisive </p>
<p>phase of our engagement in Iraq. Only in this phase can our strategic objectives be </p>
<p>met. It will also form the lasting impression of Coalition legitimacy and success.</p>
<p>“The obvious deduction from this is that if we are not prepared to make a </p>
<p>meaningful contribution to the physical and political rehabilitation of Iraq in the </p>
<p>AM phase we should not be drawn into war-fighting. There is currently a risk </p>
<p>that we view our engagement in reverse, considering post-conflict activity as a </p>
<p>necessary but inconvenient adjunct to our war-fighting plans. The Winning Concept </p>
<p>must address AM.”</p>
<p>486</p>
<p><b>1008. </b> The material in the aftermath section was described as “key deductions distilled </p>
<p>from a strategic estimate of the AM phase”. The stated aim was to:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>Set out a framework for the co-ordination of strategic planning between </p>
<p>the MOD, OGDs, other nations and, where feasible, NGOs.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Provide guidance for PJHQ on the development of operational plans.”</p>
<p><b>1009. </b> The paper listed nine “key judgements”:</p>
<p>“The AM phase will be the strategically decisive phase. We must be sure it is </p>
<p>adequately addressed in our consideration of the Winning Concept.</p>
<p><b>“No overarching concept for the future of Iraq currently seems to exist. </b></p>

<p>e. </p>
<p>UK commitment – For how long, and to what extent, will the UK be a significant </p>
<p>contributor to AM operations?”</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> On governance and reform, the paper stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Detailed military planning was proceeding with no clear view on the future of the </p>
<p>Iraqi state. The UK had a valuable contribution to make to development of an </p>
<p>overarching concept, “but the lead must rest firmly with the US as the only nation </p>
<p>with sufficient resources to underwrite the task”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was considerable temptation for regional powers to develop bilateral </p>
<p>relations with different ethnic groups, potentially leading to the “Balkanisation” of </p>
<p>Iraq and a protracted role for Coalition forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK and US positions on the role of the UN were getting closer, but remained </p>
<p>divided. For political and military reasons the UK must continue to stress the </p>
<p>need to maximise UN and international involvement. </p>
<p><b>1012. </b> The most significant factor in determining the scale and complexity of the post-</p>
<p>conflict task, the situation in Iraq, was also the least predictable. It was not possible “to </p>
<p>truly assess the state of Iraq and the intent of its principal actors in the AM phase until </p>
<p>we are presented with them”. The UK’s strategy therefore needed to be flexible enough </p>
<p>to respond to the situation on the ground. In order to make the task of scoping different </p>
<p>scenarios possible, the UK needed to form an early view on where it wished to operate. </p>
<p>The initial location might be driven by the UK’s role in Phase III, “but we can shape this”. </p>
<p>To do that, three factors needed to be considered:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>Political – FCO:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What areas offer the UK an advantageous or influential role in the AM phase? </p>
<p>Are oil fields a factor? Are there groups … whom we would rather not assume </p>
<p>responsibility for? A reasoned policy view is required.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Military – MOD:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where will our Phase III role place us and do we wish to shape it according to </p>
<p>AM factors in any way? Are there areas where we judge there is a high risk </p>
<p>of failure? Are there areas where UK strengths will be most effective, such as </p>
<p>population centres? What size and nature of area can the UK force deployed </p>
<p>realistically assume responsibility for?</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>Humanitarian – DFID: </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What are the most significant areas of humanitarian risk? How will DFID engage </p>
<p>and how can we effectively co-ordinate our efforts? How can we apply our limited </p>
<p>military capacity to respond to best effect?</p>
<p>“This thought process must be undertaken urgently if we are to shape our Phase </p>
<p>III role accordingly. Currently our involvement in the North or South is being driven </p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>by purely operational concerns. At the very least we must validate the current </p>
<p>operational considerations strategically.” </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> The paper also set out the factors likely to determine the size of the UK military’s </p>
<p>post-conflict commitment: </p>
<p>“The scale of the UK commitment to AM will be determined by the size of force </p>
<p>deployed for war-fighting in the first instance. Very rapidly, however, the demands </p>
<p>of the AM phase are likely to drive the requirement for a different force structure. </p>
<p>While the desire will evidently be to effect as rapid a drawdown as feasible, an initial </p>
<p>increase in deployed strength may be required in order to stabilise the situation. </p>
<p>A mass PW [prisoner of war] problem and/or a humanitarian crisis could both </p>
<p>prompt this, requiring an increase in light forces and logistic effort. The options for </p>
<p>meeting such a surge demand must be considered in advance in order to ensure </p>
<p>a quick response.</p>
<p>“A final view on the extent of any long-term (post-12 months) UK commitment </p>
<p>may not be required at this stage. It is necessary, however, to provide a baseline </p>
<p>assumption for the level of commitment for the crucial ‘first roulement’ post-conflict in </p>
<p>order to allow commitments to be balanced. It is suggested the assumption should </p>
<p>be up to a medium-scale (Air and Land) commitment for up to six months of the </p>
<p>AM phase. A requirement to commit at or around this level for up to two years might </p>
<p>well be necessary to ensure any lasting progress towards the UK end state.”</p>
<p><b>1014. </b> The SPG paper was included in the Christmas reading pack prepared for Mr Blair </p>

<p><b>1015. </b> On 16 December Maj Gen Fry produced a paper on deployment of a UK </p>
<p>stabilisation force in the event of the early collapse of the Iraqi regime or military leading </p>
<p>to a “loss of control”.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1016. </b> “Early collapse” was defined as the collapse of the Iraqi regime less than 60 days </p>
<p>after “P Day”; “loss of control” as “the period between the collapse of the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>and the establishment of an effective alternative providing law and order and security”. </p>
<p><b>1017. </b> Maj Gen Fry explained that:</p>
<p>“Rapid intervention by the Coalition may be required to stabilise the situation, </p>
<p>including support to an interim government. Current Package 3 deployment </p>
<p>timelines would limit the arrival of sufficient and appropriate UK military capability in </p>
<p>time. Consequently there is a need to develop a contingency plan that would enable </p>
<p>the UK to gain an early footprint on the ground, providing influence in theatre and </p>
<p>achieving strategic impact.”</p>

<p><b>1019. </b> In order to provide a quick response, the stabilisation force was “likely to be light” </p>
<p>and its role limited to “wider peacekeeping and ‘stabilisation’ tasks”, including controlling </p>
<p>and denying access to WMD, security at key locations, disarmament and demobilisation. </p>
<p>The proposal set out a number of options for different scenarios.</p>
<p><b>1020. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the paper on 18 December.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> At the meeting, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith commented that any stabilisation force would depend on timing and </p>
<p>availability of resources, and that there was a synergy between the southern option </p>
<p>and a stabilisation force.</p>
<p><b>1021. </b> On 19 December, Mr Hoon’s Private Office informed Sir David Manning and </p>
<p>the FCO, Treasury and Cabinet Office that the US military was “gearing up” to be as </p>

<p>of our own preparations if we are to remain in step”.</p>
<p>490</p>
<p> The US now recognised that </p>
<p>stabilisation and reconstruction of up to two thirds of Iraq would need to begin before the </p>
<p>military campaign had concluded. This was “bringing home to the US military the need </p>
<p>for more planning effort to be devoted to ‘aftermath’ issues now”. </p>

<p> He observed that: “Iraq is moving up a gear as an issue and as we </p>
<p>enter the New Year we need to step up our communications efforts.” </p>
<p><b>1031. </b> Mr Campbell recommended that the objectives approved by Mr Blair in October </p>
<p>should be published as soon as Parliament returned on 7 January, with a statement </p>
<p>in the House of Commons from Mr Blair alongside publicity generated by the FCO </p>
<p>Heads of Mission Conference. The statement would set out the strategic framework </p>
<p>for the Government’s overall approach and draw together the diplomatic, political and </p>
<p>humanitarian strands of the strategy on Iraq as well as addressing issues of proliferation </p>
<p>and terrorism. </p>
<p><b>1032. </b> Mr Campbell argued that the communications strategy “should be rooted in where </p>
<p>we think we will end up which currently looks like a military conflict that ends in Saddam </p>
<p>falling”. The major steps and key messages envisaged by Mr Campbell included: “Post-</p>
<p>conflict: We’re there to help for the long term.”</p>

<p>288</p>
<p><b>1035. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell recorded the importance of publishing the objectives </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1036. </b> Mr Straw issued a Written Ministerial Statement setting out the UK’s objectives for </p>
<p>post-conflict Iraq on 7 January.</p>
<p>496</p>
<p> The objectives were closely based on those approved </p>
<p>by Mr Blair in October 2002. </p>
<p><b>1037. </b> The UK’s “prime objective” was “to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>(WMD) and their associated programmes and means of delivery”. </p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Six “immediate priorities” were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support the UN Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) </p>
<p>and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enable UNMOVIC and the IAEA to ensure long-term Iraqi compliance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintain international solidarity behind the UN Security Council;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>continue to make military plans and preparations in case military action was </p>
<p>needed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to support humanitarian efforts to relieve suffering in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> The undertaking to continue to support humanitarian efforts had been added </p>
<p>since the first draft in October. Other changes included the addition of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a statement that the objectives were consistent with wider UK policy on the </p>
<p>Middle East, WMD and terrorism; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an undertaking to act in conformity with international law to achieve the </p>
<p>objectives.</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> The definition of the post-conflict end state was unchanged, but with the </p>
<p>aspiration to achieve it “as rapidly as possible” removed:</p>
<p>“We would like Iraq to become a stable, united and law abiding state, within its </p>
<p>present borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer posing </p>
<p>a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its international </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Mr John Lyons (Labour) asked Mr Hoon what role British troops would play in </p>
<p>post-war Iraq. Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, replied:</p>
<p>“There is no inevitability about military action against Iraq; this question </p>
<p>is therefore hypothetical at this stage. What I can say is that we take very </p>

<p><b>1048. </b> On 30 December 2002, Adm Boyce issued the ‘CDS Planning and Preparation </p>

<p>502</p>
<p> authorising the military preparations needed for </p>
<p>Coalition operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>503</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1049. </b> The Directive, which included little material linked explicitly to the post-conflict </p>
<p>phase of operations (Phase IV), stated:</p>
<p>“Delivering HMG’s declared end state is likely to require UK engagement in follow-</p>
<p>on operations but the possible scale and duration of ‘aftermath operations’ are </p>
<p>uncertain and are in urgent need of clarification from US planners at all levels.”</p>
<p><b>1050. </b> Instructions to Lt Gen Reith included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to seek to influence US planning, as directed by MOD; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to prepare plans for humanitarian assistance in theatre, should it become </p>
<p>necessary.</p>

<p><b>1054. </b> Brigadier Whitley explained that, on 28 December, uncertainties about whether </p>
<p>Turkey would allow transit of ground forces had led US and UK planners urgently to </p>
<p>concentrate on developing robust operations from the south. Lt Gen McKiernan “would </p>
<p>welcome the commitment of a UK division in the South from the start of the operation”. </p>
<p>The UK mission would be to “seize, secure and control” the rear area and right flank </p>
<p>of the operation and provide a coherent transition to Phase IV operations in captured </p>
<p>territory without loss of US combat forces. That would include securing infrastructure </p>
<p>such as Umm Qasr and the Rumaylah oilfields, and fixing Iraqi forces in the Basra area. </p>
<p>The Area of Operations (AO) was likely to be bounded by the Iraq/Kuwait border, the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>Definition and use of “Area of Operations (AO)” and  </b></p>
<p><b>“Area of Responsibility (AOR)”</b></p>
<p>“<b>Area of Operations (AO)</b>” refers to the UK military’s area of combat operations during </p>
<p>the invasion of Iraq (Phase III of operations). It is the term applied during conflict and is </p>
<p>the area in which lethal force can be applied for a designated period of time.</p>
<p>“<b>Area of Responsibility (AOR)</b>” is a term usually applied during peace support </p>
<p>operations. In Iraq, it refers to the area of southern Iraq for which the UK military was </p>
<p>responsible during the post-conflict Occupation (Phase IV of operations). </p>
<p>The two terms were not used consistently and were sometimes applied interchangeably </p>
<p>in the same document. </p>
<p><b>1060. </b> On 7 January, Mr Paul Flaherty, MOD Civil Secretary at PJHQ, set out PJHQ’s </p>
<p>thoughts on preparations for Phase IV in a minute to Mr Lee.</p>
<p>509</p>
<p> In the absence of an </p>
<p>agreed US inter-agency position on Phase IV planning, the CENTCOM commanders’ </p>
<p>conference in Tampa, Florida on 15 and 16 January was likely to have a significant </p>
<p>impact on US policy-making. Phase IV planning was likely to be particularly important:</p>
<p>“… if, as now appears likely, the UK were to take on the first Phase IV AOR in </p>
<p>southern Iraq. We would, in effect be setting the standard for the rest of Phase IV </p>
<p>work. (And, of course, CJO [Lt Gen Reith] is, in any case charged in CDS’ Directive </p>
<p>with planning humanitarian assistance in theatre should it become necessary.)</p>
<p>“From our point of view … we have to begin thinking very soon about the practical </p>
<p>consequences on the ground of taking on the AOR. These include issues such </p>
<p>as: food, water, displaced persons, oil (including accounting for its use), potential </p>
<p>Iranian incursions, pollution as well as, in the slightly longer term, Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform and reconstruction. Some, if not all of this will of course either determine, </p>
<p>or more properly ought to be determined by, strategic considerations of post-conflict </p>
<p>Iraqi structures.”</p>
<p><b>1061. </b> Mr Flaherty explained that PJHQ intended to establish a team charged with </p>
<p>“developing planning for Phase IV implementation” as soon as possible, which </p>
<p>would aim to take into account the lessons of the Balkans and Afghanistan. PJHQ </p>
<p>was “in a reasonably good position to link up with US military thinking”, but would </p>
<p>need more support from other government departments to help produce “a fully </p>
<p>joined up approach”.</p>

<p>293</p>
<p><b>1062. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that during the shift from a northern to a southern </p>
<p>option, he “felt that it was important to reappraise, to pause, to take stock as to what was </p>
<p>going on”.</p>
<p>510</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“The planning for post-conflict didn’t seem to me to be very robust. As we could </p>
<p>read it in the United States, a lot had been done, but it didn’t seem to have bite </p>
<p>and direction.”</p>
<p>511</p>
<p><b>1063. </b> On 7 January, the SPG produced a paper analysing the advantages and </p>
<p>disadvantages of a southern option.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1064. </b> The SPG advised the Chiefs of Staff that US combat power would deliver military </p>
<p>success, but strategic victory would be “successful delivery of aftermath and limiting </p>
<p>unintended consequences”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper stated that adopting a southern option had the </p>
<p>potential to:</p>
<p>“Provide UK with leading role in key areas of Iraq (free of Kurdish political risks) </p>
<p>in aftermath, and thus provide leverage in aftermath planning efforts, especially </p>
<p>related to:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Humanitarian effort.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Reconstruction of key infrastructure.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Future control and distribution of Iraqi oil.”</p>
<p><b>1065. </b> The SPG concluded that adoption of the southern option would mean that the UK </p>
<p>was likely to have a discrete AOR established early, with less demanding command and </p>
<p>control than in the North. In addition: </p>
<p>“UK will have made an early commitment to aftermath that will probably demand a </p>
<p>commitment for a number of years. This would be hard to avoid in any event, and </p>
<p>engagement in South offers significant advantages over possibly being fixed in North </p>
<p>with Kurds.”</p>
<p><b>1066. </b> The SPG recommended that the Chiefs of Staff should agree Lt Gen Reith’s </p>
<p>recommendation for a force package to be deployed to the South.</p>
<p><b>1067.  The analysis underpinning the SPG’s conclusions did not appear to include </b></p>
<p><b>any assessment of the conditions likely to be encountered or the tasks to be </b></p>
<p><b>performed in either northern or southern Iraq during Phase IV.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>“Phase IV would need to begin at the same time as any offensive operations. There </p>
<p>was a need for PJHQ to take ownership of Phase IV planning, which should include </p>
<p>OGD input. The US were standing up JTF-4, which would be responsible for US </p>
<p>Phase IV planning; UK staff were to be embedded.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1069. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that there was still a need for the US formally to request </p>
<p>any UK ground forces be switched to the South. </p>
<p><b>1070. </b> Adm Boyce commented that:</p>
<p>“… it was inconceivable that the UK would not play a part in Phase IV operations, </p>
<p>which could be enduring … There remained a need to test the plan as a winning </p>
<p>concept, but against that caveat … the plan recommended in the paper represented </p>
<p>a sensible military option with a valuable task, and … the option should be taken </p>
<p>forward.”</p>
<p><b>1071. </b> Mr Bowen reported the discussion to Sir David Manning, emphasising the need </p>
<p>for urgent preparatory work if the UK was to take on an AOR.</p>
<p>514</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1072. </b> The military planning assumed a “decision date of 15 February and the start of </p>
<p>hostilities in very early March”. The UK was being offered an amphibious role at the start </p>
<p>of hostilities. Thereafter, US forces would move north while the UK “took on stabilisation </p>
<p>of a southern sector which would eventually include Basra”. </p>
<p><b>1073. </b> Mr Bowen concluded: </p>
<p>“While we are now getting more clarity about the shape of US military intentions </p>
<p>in an attack on Iraq, and the potential UK role, precious little thought has gone </p>
<p>into aftermath planning … [I]f the UK is to take on an Area of Responsibility for </p>
<p>stabilisation operations, a lot of preparatory work is needed urgently. MOD have in </p>
<p>mind to engage with FCO, DFID &amp; DTI on this.” </p>
<p><b>1074. </b> By 14 January, PJHQ had established a team to examine post-conflict issues.</p>

<p><b>1077. </b> The letter proposed that the “final UK Divisional Area of Responsibility, including </p>
<p>for aftermath operations, would be an area bounded by the Iraq/Kuwait border in the </p>
<p>south, Jalibah airfield in the west, the Euphrates in the north, and the Shatt al Arab </p>

<p>518</p>
<p> [see Map 5 in </p>
<p>Annex 4]”. </p>
<p><b>1078. </b> The letter suggested that the proposed UK role in the South “should enable </p>
<p>US forces to reach further, faster, whilst providing a coherent transition to aftermath </p>
<p>operations – an area of acknowledged UK expertise – in territory captured early in </p>
<p>the campaign”. Because the proposed UK role would be “crucial to the US plan in the </p>
<p>South”, it “would place us in a very awkward position if the US seemed likely to want to </p>
<p>proceed in circumstances with which we were not content”. Further MOD advice would </p>

<p><b>Cabinet, 9 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>1079. </b> Mr Blair told the Cabinet on 9 January that “the build up of military forces was </p>

<p>519</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1080. </b> Commenting on the preparations for the deployment of military forces to the Gulf, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon told his colleagues that no decisions had been taken to launch military action. </p>
<p>Nor had the US finalised its military planning. </p>
<p><b>1081. </b> Mr Blair said that Cabinet the following week would “provide the opportunity for an </p>
<p>in-depth discussion of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>1082. </b> Discussion in Cabinet on 9 January is addressed in more detail in Section 3.6.</p>
<p><b>1083. </b> Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry that, when </p>
<p>Cabinet met on 9 January, Ministers were told:</p>
<p>“... nothing was inevitable. We are pressing the UN option. No decisions on military </p>
<p>action, whereas you can see that, at another level, the decisions on military action </p>
<p>were hardening up quite substantially.”</p>
<p>520</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1084. </b> Lord Turnbull added: </p>
<p>“I could see he [Mr Blair] did not want key discussions of … who was going to bring </p>
<p>what forces to bear where, and there is some sense in that. But the strategic choices </p>
<p>that they implied … didn’t get discussed either. For example, the fact that if you have </p>
<p>ground forces you become an occupying power.”</p>
<p>518 </p>
<p>The figure of 1,600 sq km was used repeatedly in policy and briefing papers during January and </p>

<p>“MOD is to begin work on the practicalities of a possible UK military role in </p>
<p>administering immediate post-Saddam Iraq. It was agreed that this work needed to </p>
<p>take place in the context of existing contingency planning and with the involvement </p>
<p>of other interested departments. As a first step, the CO [Cabinet Office] would copy </p>

<p><b>1086. </b> One item not recorded in the minutes of the 8 January Chiefs of Staff meeting, </p>
<p>but reported separately by Mr Ehrman, was a decision that DFID and DTI would be </p>
<p>brought into MOD humanitarian and reconstruction planning, but “without being told </p>
<p>US timelines”.</p>
<p>522</p>
<p><b>1087. </b> Exactly how to engage DFID in military planning remained unresolved. </p>
<p>On 8 January, Mr Webb wrote to Mr Lee:</p>
<p>“The question is now before us of exactly who is going to organise CIMIC and the </p>
<p>Civil Transition in any areas occupied by UK forces (let alone the wider problem with </p>
<p>the US). It was agreed … today that we need to get DFID in on humanitarian and, </p>
<p>with DTI, aftermath aspects of Iraq planning.”</p>
<p>523</p>
<p>Mr Webb added:</p>
<p>“… I wonder whether we could use a ‘wider group’ approach in Whitehall that avoids </p>
<p>military detail and dates (and I heard an interesting SPG idea for a proper planning </p>
<p>conference to kick it off thoroughly) …</p>
<p>“We might be able to go further subsequently with staff properly posted to PJHQ and </p>

<p>“CDS [Adm Boyce] underscored the potential dangers associated with ‘catastrophic </p>
<p>success’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and the implicit need to develop thinking for aftermath management. In </p>
<p>planning for Phase IV, the UK was adopting a twin track approach: the FCO and </p>
<p>Cabinet Office were leading the top-down strand, and PJHQ was leading the bottom-</p>
<p>up effort. The challenge which lay ahead was matching the two pieces of work … The </p>
<p>UK concept at the strategic level was to develop a model that could be offered to the </p>
<p>US. It was assessed that the US was still working to an unrealistic assumption that </p>
<p>their forces would be ‘welcomed with open arms’ by the Iraqi people during Phase IV </p>
<p>operations, and there was an opportunity for the UK to lead the aftermath debate.”</p>

<p>fighting – and develop a strategy.”</p>
<p><b>1104. </b> The author of the record added some “personal observations”, including:</p>
<p>“The PM came across as someone with strong convictions that this should, and </p>
<p>will, go ahead. He accepted the military advice being given to him, although he </p>
<p>still sought reassurance that all aspects had been looked into and that plans are </p>
<p>drawn up to deal with the unexpected or perceived worse cases. It is clear from the </p>
<p>three areas that he asked further work to be done on that the Phase IV part of the </p>
<p>plan is critical.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Interestingly it was SofS [Secretary of State, Mr Hoon] who urged the PM to </p>
<p>exercise a degree of restraint on POTUS [the President of the United States], whom </p>
<p>he described as ‘going for it’. SofS expressed concern about some of the US ideas </p>
<p>and wanted to ensure that no irreversible damage was done to Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>1105. </b> After the briefing by the Chiefs of Staff, Mr Rycroft informed Mr Watkins that </p>
<p>Mr Blair agreed that “much greater clarity about US intentions” on post-conflict issues </p>
<p>was needed.</p>
<p>532</p>
<p> Mr Blair “would be keen to see the outcome of the Whitehall visit to </p>
<p>Washington next week”.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1106. </b> Mr Watkins instructed Mr Lee:</p>
<p>“… we will clearly need to use all our regular contacts with the US, in both </p>
<p>CENTCOM and the Pentagon. If appropriate, this [aftermath] is an issue that </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>1107. </b> The first record seen by the Inquiry of a discussion of post-conflict issues between </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and Secretary Rumsfeld was in Washington on 12 February (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>1108. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that his expression of concern to the Prime Minister </p>
<p>at the briefing “was more about the immediate aftermath, immediately after the fighting </p>
<p>phase, what would we need to do to provide security in the first instance, but also to </p>
<p>provide what we saw as being the most immediate problem would be a humanitarian </p>
<p>problem”.</p>
<p>535</p>
<p><b>1109. </b> Lt Gen Reith attended the CENTCOM commanders’ conference in Tampa, Florida </p>
<p>on 15 and 16 January. The conference was described by Gen Franks as “likely to be the </p>
<p>last chance for such a gathering to take place. It therefore had to be conclusive.”</p>
<p>536</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1110. </b> Maj Gen Wilson reported that “Phase IV responsibilities became a little clearer” at </p>
<p>the commanders’ conference: Gen Franks had demanded that JTF-4 deploy as soon as </p>
<p>possible to Kuwait and had welcomed Lt Gen Reith’s offer to embed four UK personnel </p>
<p>in it. Gen Franks had also directed that “key Phase IV players should visit the Pentagon </p>
<p>to ensure that planning was joined up”.</p>
<p>537</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1111. </b> In his record of the meeting with Gen Franks, Lt Gen Reith explained that UK staff </p>
<p>embedded in JTF-4 would have “reach-back” to the Phase IV planning team in PJHQ, </p>
<p>giving the UK “considerable influence over US planning”.</p>
<p>538</p>
<p> He reported that Gen Franks </p>
<p>had “agreed that we could plan on [the] UK having responsibility for the Basra region in </p>
<p>Phase IV and would welcome our setting the standard for other nations. Clearly this will </p>
<p>need Ministerial approval in due course.” Lt Gen Reith also reported that the US had </p>
<p>“a zillion dollar project to modernise and properly exploit the southern oilfields”.</p>
<p><b>1112. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry that, on 16 January, he told Gen Franks he was </p>
<p>unhappy with the way planning was going:</p>
<p>“… they were going into shock and awe, and we … the British … had been very </p>
<p>much the custodians of ‘Let’s worry about Phase IV’. So we got on to Phase IV in </p>
<p>our discussion and I made the point … that the oilfields were absolutely essential for </p>
<p>Phase IV, to provide revenue for Iraq for its reconstruction and therefore, we needed </p>
<p>to secure the oilfields rather than have them destroyed. I also made the point to him </p>
<p>that the more china that we broke, the more we would have to replace afterwards.”</p>

<p><b>1113. </b> Maj Gen Wilson told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“General Franks was very clear about the criticality of … Phase IV [and] understood </p>

<p>and … civil action.”</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>1114.  In Cabinet on 16 January, Mr Blair listed priorities for the immediate future:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“preparatory work” on post-conflict planning and the role of the UN;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the need to communicate to the Iraqi people a vision of a better life; and</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>contingency work on the unexpected consequences of conflict.</b></p>
<p><b>1115. </b> The Cabinet discussed Iraq on 16 January. The discussion is also addressed in </p>
<p>Sections 3.6 and 6.2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1116. </b> Ms Short said that work on post-conflict issues needed to be taken forward </p>
<p>urgently. She emphasised the need for extra resources, the potential effect of CBW on </p>
<p>civilians and the importance of involving the UN. </p>
<p><b>1117. </b> Summarising the discussion, Mr Blair said that the “priorities for the immediate </p>
<p>future were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improved communications, which would set out the Government’s strategy and </p>
<p>be promoted by the whole Cabinet;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparatory work on planning the aftermath of any military action and the role of </p>
<p>the United Nations in that, which should in turn be conveyed to the Iraqi people </p>
<p>so that they had a vision of a better life in prospect; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contingency work on the unintended consequences which could arise from </p>
<p>the Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction, environmental catastrophe or </p>
<p>internecine strife within Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>1118.  Despite Mr Blair’s promise that military options would be discussed and the </b></p>
<p><b>imminence of the formal decision to offer a significant land contribution, Cabinet </b></p>
<p><b>was not briefed on the substance of the military options or the circumstances in </b></p>
<p><b>which force would be used. It did not discuss the strategic implications of making </b></p>
<p><b>a military contribution. </b></p>
<p><b>1119.  On 17 January, Mr Blair approved the deployment of UK forces to support </b></p>
<p><b>US military preparation in the region. </b></p>
<p><b>1120.  He did so without clear advice on the wider strategic implications and </b></p>
<p><b>contingent liabilities, including the potential UK responsibility for post-conflict </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>1121.  Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that much greater clarity was needed on US </b></p>
<p><b>thinking on post-conflict issues.</b></p>
<p><b>1122.  Mr Blair concluded that Mr Straw’s concerns should not affect his decision </b></p>
<p><b>to deploy forces.</b></p>
<p><b>1123. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 16 January seeking agreement to the “key role in </p>
<p>southern Iraq” proposed by the US for the UK.</p>
<p>542</p>
<p> The letter, described in more detail in </p>
<p>Section 6.2, was copied to Mr Straw, Mr Brown and Sir Andrew Turnbull.</p>
<p><b>1124. </b> Mr Hoon advised: </p>
<p>“Important questions remain to be resolved … But the role proposed for the UK is </p>
<p>a sensible and significant one, and I recommend that with certain qualifications, we </p>
<p>accept it. We need to decide quickly.”</p>
<p><b>1125. </b> Mr Hoon added that equipment and personnel would need to be moved early the </p>
<p>following week and that, if Mr Blair agreed, he proposed: </p>
<p>“… to announce the composition and deployment of the force in an oral statement </p>
<p>on Monday 20 January.”</p>
<p><b>1126. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the proposed role for the UK was “essentially as described in </p>
<p>my Office’s letter of 8 January”:</p>
<p>“The final UK Divisional Area of Responsibility, including for aftermath operations, </p>
<p>would be an area bounded by the Iraq/Kuwait border in the south, Jalibah airfield in </p>
<p>the west, the Euphrates in the north, and the Shatt al Arab waterway in the east – a </p>
<p>largely Shia area of some 1,600 sq km [see Map 5 in Annex 4].”</p>
<p><b>1127. </b> Mr Hoon advised that:</p>
<p>“… a number of issues still need finally to be resolved, before we can conclude that </p>
<p>the overall US plan represents a winning concept. These include the legal basis </p>
<p>for any operation as well as the credibility of plans for the aftermath, which the US </p>
<p>accept will begin concurrently with combat operations.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Assuming that outstanding issues can be resolved, I and the Chiefs of Staff are </p>
<p>content that the role proposed for a UK ground force is both sensible and attractive. </p>
<p>The plan will need further development to address a number of specific challenges </p>
<p>(oilfields, displaced persons, handling Iran, etc) …</p>
<p>“The proposed final [UK] Area of Responsibility is a coherent one with largely </p>
<p>natural geographical boundaries … and includes economic infrastructure critical to </p>

<p>6.4  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, mid-2001 to January 2003</p>
<p>303</p>
<p>Iraq’s future, including much of its oil reserves, critical communications nodes, a </p>
<p>city (Basra) of 1.3m people and a port (Umm Qasr) about the size of Southampton. </p>
<p>Although the establishment of UK control over this area will require careful </p>
<p>presentation to rebut any allegations of selfish motives, we will be playing a vital role </p>
<p>in shaping a better future for Iraq and its people.”</p>
<p><b>1128. </b> Mr Hoon stated that he had put work in hand to address the “three big issues” </p>
<p>identified by Mr Blair at the meeting with the Chiefs of Staff:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “nature of the proposition” that was being put “to the Iraqi people including </p>
<p>those in the governing apparatus who are not considered beyond the pale, and </p>
<p>the way in which that would be conveyed to them without damaging operational </p>
<p>security and losing the element of surprise”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need “Now that we have a proposed Area of Responsibility” to work on that </p>
<p>“with greater clarity”. The forthcoming visit of a Whitehall team to Washington </p>
<p>was identified as “an opportunity to mould US thinking”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Making sure the UK had the “best possible contingency plans for worst-case </p>
<p>scenarios”.</p>
<p><b>1129. </b> On timing, Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“CENTCOM assume that, unless Saddam changes his behaviour, a political decision </p>
<p>to take military action may be made in mid-February. Air and ground operations </p>
<p>could begin in early March, with the main effort by ground forces beginning in </p>
<p>mid-March (although they still aspire to bring the main effort forward).”</p>
<p><b>1130. </b> Mr Hoon recommended that the UK:</p>
<p>“… should inform the US that we agree that planning should assume the contribution </p>
<p>of the proposed UK land force package to carry out the role the US has requested, </p>
<p>subject to:</p>
<p>i </p>
<p>the overall caveat that a further political decision would be required to </p>
<p>commit UK forces to any specific operation;</p>
<p>ii </p>
<p>US assistance in facilitating the bed-down of UK forces, and provision of </p>
<p>logistic support;</p>
<p>iii </p>
<p>further work to develop a satisfactory plan for the aftermath.”</p>
<p><b>1131.  Mr Hoon highlighted the significance of the post-conflict phase of </b></p>
<p><b>operations in his advice to Mr Blair, but he did not:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>identify the risks associated with deploying UK forces before decisions </b></p>
<p><b>had been made on the scope or duration of their post-conflict role, or on </b></p>
<p><b>the UK’s wider post-conflict responsibilities;</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>offer advice on what might constitute “a satisfactory plan for the </b></p>
<p><b>aftermath” or the consequences of failure to reach agreement with the US </b></p>
<p><b>on such a plan; or</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>adequately consult the FCO or DFID before submitting his </b></p>
<p><b>recommendation.</b></p>
<p><b>1132.  Mr Hoon should have questioned those omissions before advising Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>on an issue of such significance.</b></p>
<p><b>1133.  Sir Kevin Tebbit, as PUS, should have ensured that those issues were </b></p>
<p><b>covered in more detail in the advice put to Mr Hoon.</b></p>
<p><b>1134. </b> On Mr Ehrman’s recommendation, Mr Straw sent a letter to Mr Blair on </p>
<p>17 January flagging up “three major issues” in Mr Hoon’s proposal: targeting, Iraqi use </p>
<p>of WMD and the “aftermath”.</p>
<p>543</p>
<p> Mr Straw advised that:</p>
<p>“… much greater clarity is required about US thinking and plans for the aftermath. </p>
<p>How long would UK forces be expected to stay in the area of responsibility proposed </p>
<p>for them? What would be their role in what form of administration, not least in </p>
<p>Basra …? We need in particular far greater clarity on US thinking on management of </p>
<p>the oilfields. As you know, we have sizeable differences of view from many in the US </p>
<p>Administration who envisage Iraq being a US military governorate for an extended </p>
<p>period of time. A UK team will be discussing this issue with the US next week. It will </p>
<p>be putting hard questions, and highlighting our own view that there needs to be a </p>
<p>move to UN administration, with Coalition forces remaining responsible for security, </p>
<p>as soon as possible.”</p>
<p><b>1135. </b> Mr Straw’s minute was not sent to Ms Short.</p>
<p><b>1136.  Like Mr Hoon, Mr Straw did not give due consideration to what might </b></p>
<p><b>constitute a satisfactory plan for the UK and whether UK participation in military </b></p>
<p><b>action should be conditional on such a plan. </b></p>
<p><b>1137. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair: “Good questions. But I don’t think they </p>
<p>affect your decision in principle [to deploy forces].”</p>
<p>544</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1138. </b> Mr Blair replied: “agreed”.</p>
<p>545</p>
<p> </p>
