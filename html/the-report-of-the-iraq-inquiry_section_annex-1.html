<p><b>2. </b> Britain’s interest in what is today Iraq goes back more than four hundred years, to </p>
<p>1583 when an English merchant, John Eldred, left London on a five-year journey that </p>
<p>took him to Baghdad.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> The first British military involvement came in 1775, when the </p>
<p>Ottoman Turks faced a sustained Persian attack on the Shatt al-Arab waterway. The </p>
<p>Turkish Sultan asked Britain to defend the waterway; the British Prime Minister Lord </p>
<p>North agreed, and the Royal Navy drove the Persians out of the Sultan’s domains. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> Under the Ottomans, what is now northern Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan was within the </p>
<p>province of Mosul. What is now central Iraq was the province of Baghdad, and southern </p>
<p>Iraq the province of Basra. All three provinces were to become the British Mandate of </p>
<p>Mesopotamia (the Land of Two Rivers – the Tigris and Euphrates), later known as Iraq. </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>John Eldred, <i>Journal of His Voyage</i> (in Hakluyt’s <i>Principal Navigations</i>, first published in 1599).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>There was a fourth Ottoman province, running along the Arabian shore of the Persian </p>
<p>Gulf, with its small port of Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> In 1805 the East India Company appointed its first Resident in Baghdad: Claudius </p>
<p>James Rich, who was fluent in Arabic. A visiting Briton later wrote: “Mr Rich was </p>
<p>universally considered to be the most powerful man in Baghdad; and some even </p>
<p>questioned whether the Pasha himself would not shape his conduct according </p>
<p>to Mr Rich’s suggestions and advice rather than as his own council might wish.” </p>
<p>Mesopotamian tribesmen frequently appealed to the British Resident for support against </p>
<p>the Ottoman authorities.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Britain, Basra and al-Faw</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> In 1861, with the support of the British Government, a British merchant shipping </p>
<p>company established the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. Most of </p>
<p>the river steamers on the Tigris were built in British yards. With the opening of the Suez </p>
<p>Canal in1869, Basra, and al-Faw at the mouth of the Gulf, became an important staging </p>
<p>post for British naval and mercantile traffic with India. The fort at al-Faw had been built  </p>
<p>by local Ottoman officials, suspicious of British territorial ambitions in the Shatt al-Arab.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 1890, nine-tenths of the steamer tonnage using Basra for Indian Ocean trade </p>
<p>was British. </p>
<p><b>Anglo-German rivalry</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> In 1899, to counter a planned German railway terminus and naval base in Basra, the </p>
<p>ruler of Kuwait promised Britain that he would cede none of Kuwait’s territory without </p>
<p>Britain’s agreement. When in 1902, Turkish forces advanced from Basra into Kuwait, </p>
<p>they were driven off by a British gunboat. In 1904 a British Resident arrived in Kuwait to </p>
<p>uphold Britain’s authority there.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> In 1913 the British decided to separate Kuwait from the influence of the Ottoman </p>
<p>authorities in Basra, of which Kuwait was then an integral administrative part. </p>
<p>Under the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of July 1913, Kuwait became a separate </p>
<p>administrative district. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> As German pressure for influence in Baghdad grew, a British irrigation engineer, </p>
<p>Sir William Willcocks, was appointed Consultant for Irrigation to the Ottoman </p>
<p>Government. As a result of Willcocks’ vision, the Hindiya Barrage was built on </p>
<p>the Euphrates, bringing 3,500,000 acres under year-round irrigation. Opened in </p>
<p>November 1913, it is still one of the engineering marvels of Iraq. </p>

<p><b>Oil</b></p>
<p><b>9. </b> In 1912, the Royal Navy changed from coal to oil. To secure this oil for Britain, in the </p>
<p>spring of 1914 the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill, acquired for the British </p>
<p>Government a 51 percent share in the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (in 1904 a British </p>
<p>prospector had discovered oil in Persia, forty miles from the Mesopotamian border; </p>
<p>in 1909 the oilfield was acquired by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, whose principal </p>
<p>shareholders were British). The British Government’s 51 percent share in Anglo-Persian </p>
<p>Oil made Basra, and al-Faw at the head of the Gulf, a vital British interest. </p>
<p><b>War and conquest in Mesopotamia</b></p>
<p><b>10. </b> On 29 October 1914, in the early months of the First World War, two German </p>
<p>warships, flying the Turkish flag, bombarded Russia’s Black Sea ports. Britain, allied </p>
<p>to Russia, ordered Turkey to end the bombardments. The British ultimatum expired </p>
<p>on 31 October. On 7 November a British and Indian military force landed at al-Faw.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Marching a hundred miles inland and crossing the Persian border, it occupied the British </p>
<p>Government-owned Persian oilfields. It then marched back into Mesopotamia, to Basra, </p>
<p>which it captured on 22 November.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> That November, the Ottoman Government having declared that the Anglo-Ottoman </p>
<p>Convention of 1913 was null and void, Britain, to protect its interests at the head of the </p>
<p>Persian Gulf, declared Kuwait an independent sheikhdom under British protection.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> In London, on 19 March 1915, the War Council – headed by the Prime Minister, </p>
<p>H.H. Asquith – discussed various plans to partition the Ottoman Empire once it had </p>
<p>been defeated. Only Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary, opposed partition and </p>
<p>annexation, telling the War Council that he wanted Britain to make a good impression on </p>
<p>the British Empire’s Muslim subjects (of whom there were more than fifty million in India) </p>
<p>by setting up an independent Muslim State in all the Arab regions of the Turkish Empire: </p>
<p>Arabia, Syria and Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Fighting against the Turks continued. In August 1915, after the British occupied </p>
<p>Nasiriyah, a civil administration was set up in Basra for the whole southern area.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> A steady stream of reinforcements reached Basra during the second half of 1916. </p>
<p>That October, Lieutenant William Slim (a future Field Marshal) who had been badly </p>
<p>wounded at Gallipoli a year earlier, arrived. In the fighting that followed, he was wounded </p>
<p>again, and awarded the Military Cross. Slim remembered Basra as “a very unpleasant </p>
<p>place to be”.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>British troops again landed at al-Faw on 20 March 2003, at 2200 hours (local time), when 40 Commando, </p>
<p>Royal Marines and US Marines came ashore, followed within an hour by 42 Commando Royal Marines.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>15. </b> On 11 March 1917, as British forces approached Baghdad, and the Turkish </p>
<p>Army fled, the city was given over to mass looting by local Arabs and Kurds. After the </p>
<p>American Consul appealed to the British to intervene, British and Indian soldiers fired </p>
<p>over the heads of the looters and dispersed them. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> On March 12, a British proclamation announced: “O, people of Baghdad ... Our </p>
<p>armies do not come into your cities and lands as conquerors or enemies, but as </p>
<p>liberators”. The people of Baghdad were then invited “through your Nobles and Elders </p>
<p>and Representatives, to participate in the management of your own civil affairs in </p>
<p>collaboration with the political representatives of Great Britain who accompanied the </p>
<p>British Army so that you might be united with your kinsmen in north, east, south and </p>
<p>west in realizing the aspirations of your Race”.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> In August 1917 the Mesopotamia Commission – the first Iraq Inquiry – set up by </p>
<p>the British Government a year earlier, published its report of the first two years’ fighting. </p>
<p>Among the Report’s criticisms were equipment that was “not up to the standards of </p>
<p>modern warfare”, a “lamentable breakdown of the care of the sick and wounded”, the </p>
<p>“isolation and ignorance” of those responsible for the care of the wounded, a standard </p>
<p>of administration based on “the routine method of normal times rather than to the </p>
<p>impressment of new ideas”, army organisation that was “backward in every particular”, </p>
<p>and what it called (with regard to some of the witnesses) “misuse of reticence”. Neither </p>
<p>in the organisation of industrial resources for the purposes of war, nor in general </p>
<p>finances, the Report asserted, “was sufficient alacrity shown during the first year and a </p>
<p>half of war.” The overarching failure: “a lack of plans and a lack of preparations”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>18. </b> On 30 October 1918, Turkey accepted an armistice. When it came into force the </p>
<p>following day, the three Ottoman provinces of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra came under </p>
<p>British military rule. The human cost of the four-year campaign had been high: more than </p>
<p>31,000 British and Indian dead and at least 25,000 Turkish dead.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> With the defeat of Turkey, the British confirmed the status of Kuwait as an </p>
<p>independent sheikdom under British protectorate. A month later, under the Anglo-French </p>
<p>Settlement of 1-4 December 1918, Mesopotamia and Kurdistan – known collectively as </p>
<p>Iraq – became a British-ruled entity. </p>
<p><b>Insurgency and the British Mandate for Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>20. </b> Iraqis were divided on whether Britain should lead them towards independence </p>
<p>or whether they should seek immediate independence by force. In Baghdad, the </p>
<p>Sunni-dominated al-Ahd Society was a centre of anti-British (and anti-Kurdish) activity. </p>
<p>Al-Ahd also opposed the political aspirations of the Shia in the south. Another Sunni </p>
<p>grouping, led by Nuri Said, an officer in the Ottoman Army who had been active in the </p>
<p>Arab Revolt of 1916-18 against the Turks (a revolt that originated in the Ottoman Red </p>
<p>7 </p>
<p>Command Paper 8610 of 1917.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Annex 1  |  Iraq – 1583 to 1960</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>Sea province of Hedjaz, now part of Saudi Arabia) looked to British rule to secure the </p>
<p>unification of Iraq. Nuri Said, a supporter of British influence, was to serve seven times </p>
<p>as Prime Minister of Iraq during the following thirty-five years.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Seeking immediate independence, first the Baghdad Sunni, then the southern </p>
<p>Shia, and finally the Kurds in the north, attacked British garrisons throughout Iraq. In </p>
<p>the spring of 1920, a Revolutionary Council was established, dedicated to the removal </p>
<p>of British rule. Its President, Mohammad Hassan al-Maliki, was a poet who, after being </p>
<p>imprisoned by the British, was to become Minister of Education two years later, in the </p>
<p>first Iraqi National Government. (His grandson, Nouri al-Maliki, became Prime Minister of </p>
<p>Iraq in 2006).</p>
<p><b>22. </b> On 26 May 1920, an anti-British rebellion broke out near Mosul, and rapidly spread </p>
<p>south, threatening Baghdad. Two days after the start of the rebellion, Britain received, </p>
<p>at the San Remo Conference, the League of Nations Mandate for Iraq. The Mandate </p>
<p>pledged Britain to create in Iraq “an independent nation subject to the rendering of </p>
<p>administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as she is able to </p>
<p>stand alone”.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The Prime Minister, David Lloyd George, hoped to end the rebellion in Iraq by </p>
<p>immediately setting up an Arab administration. The Cabinet insisted the rebellion be </p>
<p>crushed first. British military and air power was used to do this; in the battle for Fallujah, </p>
<p>more than ten thousand Iraqi and a thousand British and Indian soldiers were killed. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> Starting at the end of September 1920, and lasting for three and a half months, </p>
<p>punitive expeditions set out to all the centres of revolt, and whole villages were burned </p>
<p>to the ground. Throughout the winter of 1920-1, the last of the insurgents were hunted </p>
<p>down in punitive expeditions.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The defeat of the rebellion had a long legacy. In August 1920, Lieutenant Colonel </p>
<p>Gerard Leachman had been killed south of Fallujah in a confrontation with the local </p>
<p>tribal leader, Sheikh al-Dari. Eighty-five years later, a British administrator in this same </p>
<p>area, Rory Stewart wrote: “They still glorify the killing of Colonel Leachman as a great </p>
<p>moment in the anti-colonial struggle … His death was celebrated in Iraqi soap operas, </p>
<p>and the grandson of the man who killed him, Harith al-Dari, was a leading figure in the </p>
<p>Sunni opposition to occupation. Outside my office in Nasiriyah stood a bronze statue of </p>
<p>Leachman being shot in the back.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>Britain and the Iraqi monarchy</b></p>
<p><b>26. </b> In January 1921, Lloyd George appointed Winston Churchill as Secretary of State </p>
<p>for the Colonies, charged with “setting up a local government congenial to the wishes </p>
<p>of the masses of the people” in Iraq. That April, Churchill told the House of Commons </p>
<p>it was Britain’s intention “to install an Arab ruler in Iraq ... and to create an Arab army </p>
<p>8 </p>
<p>Stewart, R. <i>The Prince of the Marshes. </i>Pan Macmillan, 2006. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>for the national defence”. Britain’s aim was “to build up around the ancient capital of </p>
<p>Baghdad, in a form friendly to Britain and to her Allies, an Arab State which can revive </p>
<p>and embody the old culture and glories of the Arab race …”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Churchill told the Commons how the decision to give “satisfaction to Arab </p>
<p>nationality” had led him to invite Emir Feisal, one of the leaders of the wartime Arab </p>
<p>Revolt in the Hedjaz, to “present himself to the people” of Iraq, which would be </p>
<p>transformed into an Arab kingdom with its own monarchy, guarded principally by an </p>
<p>Arab Army, and linked to Britain by treaty. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> Feisal was the third son of Sherif Hussein, King of the Hedjaz (and head of the </p>
<p>Sunni Hashemite dynasty). In 1919, Feisal had come to an agreement brokered by the </p>
<p>British whereby he would become the ruler of an Arab kingdom in Syria, in return for </p>
<p>recognising Britain’s 1917 promise of a Jewish National Home in Palestine. At first all </p>
<p>went according to plan. In October 1918, Feisal set up an Arab government in Syria, </p>
<p>under British protection. Then all went awry: on 7 March 1920, Feisal was proclaimed </p>
<p>King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria, by the Syrian National Congress, but within two </p>
<p>months the San Remo Conference gave France the Mandate for Syria, and French </p>
<p>forces defeated Feisal and drove him out; he went to live in Britain. The British, anxious </p>
<p>to preserve their agreement with him, decided to place him on the throne of Iraq (and to </p>
<p>give his brother Emir Abdullah the throne of Transjordan – the western part of Britain’s </p>
<p>Palestine Mandate, stretching from the river Jordan to the Iraqi border).</p>
<p><b>29. </b> With British support, Feisal arrived in Iraq in June 1921. The Shia leaders wanted </p>
<p>him to push for immediate independence. He refused to do so, fearing to lose British </p>
<p>support for his imminent throne. During the first two weeks of August 1921 a referendum </p>
<p>was held throughout Iraq on Feisal’s kingship, and on 15 August, the British High </p>
<p>Commissioner in Baghdad, Sir Percy Cox, announced that Feisal had been chosen as </p>
<p>King, by “an overwhelming vote”. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Two weeks later, as the insurgency continued, Cox informed London that Feisal had </p>
<p>agreed that “there is no objection to the use of Gas bombs in Iraq provided that they are </p>
<p>not lethal or permanently injurious to health”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>The first Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, 1922</b></p>
<p><b>31. </b> Feisal agreed to negotiate an Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. He was told that Britain must retain </p>
<p>responsibility, as the Mandatory power, both for the suppression of internal disorder and </p>
<p>for the maintenance of external defence until such time when an “independent Islamic </p>
<p>state of Iraq can stand alone”. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> As negotiations for the treaty continued, Churchill told Lloyd George that there </p>
<p>was “scarcely a single newspaper in Britain – Tory, Liberal or Labour”, which was not </p>
<p>“consistently hostile” to Britain’s remaining in Iraq. Lloyd George replied that Britain </p>
<p>9 </p>
<p>Cox to Churchill, 2 December 1921, Air Ministry papers, 5/490.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Annex 1  |  Iraq – 1583 to 1960</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>could not abandon Iraq: “Having beaten the Turk ... we could not at the Armistice have </p>
<p>repudiated all our undertakings towards the Arabs. We were responsible for liberating </p>
<p>them from Turkish sovereignty, and we were absolutely bound to assist them in setting </p>
<p>up Arab governments, if we were not prepared to govern them ourselves.” Lloyd George </p>
<p>added: “If we leave, we may find a year or two after we have departed that we have </p>
<p>handed over to the French and Americans some of the richest oilfields in the world.”</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Treaty negotiations with Feisal were concluded; under the treaty, Britain would </p>
<p>have “executive authority” for twenty years over Iraq’s foreign and security policy, in a </p>
<p>“co-equal” Kingdom of Iraq. The Iraqi Cabinet ratified the treaty on 10 October 1922. </p>
<p>Two weeks later, Lloyd George’s coalition government disintegrated, and a General </p>
<p>Election was called. During the election campaign, several candidates urged Britain to </p>
<p>leave Iraq immediately.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> So strong was antagonism in Britain to remaining in Iraq that, when the </p>
<p>Conservative leader, Andrew Bonar Law, became Prime Minister in October 1922, </p>
<p>he set up a Cabinet Committee to reconsider whether Britain should continue with the </p>
<p>Anglo-Iraq Treaty. The Committee decided that the twenty-year duration of the treaty </p>
<p>should be reduced to four years. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> In Iraq, Sir Percy Cox threatened to dissolve the Constituent Assembly if it did not </p>
<p>ratify the treaty, and issued orders for British troops to occupy the Assembly building. </p>
<p>The treaty was ratified, whereupon the British encouraged the creation of an Iraqi civilian </p>
<p>administration under Feisal’s rule. One obstacle was a <i>fatwa </i>issued in 1922 by the </p>
<p>Iraqi Shia religious leaders in Najaf, forbidding observant Shia from supporting Feisal, </p>
<p>or any members of the Sunni royal house of the Hedjaz. Feisal was, in the language </p>
<p>of the <i>fatwa</i>, “an alien usurper to the throne of Iraq, imposed by the colonial power”. </p>
<p>A few leading Shia families defied the <i>fatwa </i>(which remained in force until 1937) and </p>
<p>supported the new dynasty and government. </p>
<p><b>British bombing policy</b></p>
<p><b>36. </b> For non-Kurdish Iraqis, the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty offered a means of curbing Kurdish </p>
<p>separatism. In 1923 and 1924, British fighting against Kurdish separatists involved </p>
<p>punitive military operations and RAF bombing raids. The RAF also took part in bombing </p>
<p>raids to persuade recalcitrant tribes throughout Iraq to pay their taxes. One method by </p>
<p>which Britain sought to maintain law and order in Iraq was by the setting up of “Arab </p>
<p>Levies” – troops recruited from minority Iraqi communities: Kurds, Marsh Arabs and the </p>
<p>Assyrian Christians.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> In 1924, Air Commodore Lionel Charlton, the Chief Staff Officer of RAF Iraq </p>
<p>Command, visited the hospital in Diwaniya where he saw horribly injured civilians, </p>
<p>including women and children, who were among the Shia victims of a British air raid. </p>
<p>In protest at Britain’s bombing policy, he resigned.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Among Iraqis, the legacy of these punitive bombing raids was long-lasting. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>The Mandate years</b></p>
<p><b>39. </b> During the ten years from 1922 to the end of the Mandate in 1932, when Iraq </p>
<p>obtained full independence, as government ministries were steadily handed over to </p>
<p>Iraqi control, British officials led the rebuilding of the Iraqi civilian and administrative </p>
<p>infrastructure: in health, education, communications, irrigation, the economy, the </p>
<p>judiciary, the army and the police. There were almost three thousand British officials in </p>
<p>Iraq in 1922, as administrators in all departments. They were headed and supervised by </p>
<p>a, five-man, Iraq Secretariat of British officials. Of those, the Judicial Secretary was put </p>
<p>in charge of drafting a constitution for Iraq. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> In accordance with the gradual but immediate Iraqiisation of the administration, </p>
<p>while British officials worked as advisers in the Ministry of Finance, the first Minister of </p>
<p>Finance was an Iraqi, Sasson Eskell, a Baghdadi Jew and a distinguished financier and </p>
<p>parliamentarian since Ottoman times. He is regarded in Iraq to this day as the Father </p>
<p>of Parliament. In the long and complex negotiations for the Iraq Treaty, he had worked </p>
<p>closely with Gertrude Bell and T.E. Lawrence, and was at the centre of the creation of </p>
<p>the new Iraqi Government’s laws and financial structure. He was knighted in 1923.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Typical of these British civil servants was the Inspector General of Health Services, </p>
<p>Henry Sinderson, who introduced modern medicine to Iraq and became Dean of Iraq’s </p>
<p>Royal College of Medicine. Knighted in 1946 after twenty-five years service to medicine </p>
<p>in Iraq, the hospitals and clinics he established throughout the country made Iraq a </p>
<p>model for the whole region.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> In 1930, at the request of the Iraqi Government, a distinguished British politician, </p>
<p>writer and soldier, Sir Edward Hilton Young, went to Iraq to advise on economic and </p>
<p>loan policy, to scrutinise the budget, and to help establish a new currency, replacing the </p>
<p>Indian rupee with the Iraqi dinar. His efforts ensured a stable Iraq currency.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> By 1930 the number of British officials in the Iraqi administration had been reduced </p>
<p>to just over two hundred; some were to remain in Iraq for another decade and more. </p>
<p>The legacy of their service and of British-built infrastructure lasted into the era of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and was spoken of with appreciation by several of the Iraq Inquiry’s </p>
<p>Iraqi interlocutors. </p>
<p><b>Defending Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>44. </b> During the Mandate years, Britain also defended Iraq from attacks from across the </p>
<p>Arabian border. In December 1923, raiders from Nejd, under the control of Ibn Saud, </p>
<p>launched an attack on the tribes living in southern Iraq. The RAF drove off the attackers </p>
<p>in a series of bombing raids.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> In November 1927, the northeastern tribes of the Nejd carried out an armed attack </p>
<p>seventy-five miles inside the Iraqi border. Despite an RAF bombing raid on the attackers, </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>229</p>
<p>they penetrated even deeper into Iraq, killing Shia Marsh Arab shepherds and their </p>
<p>children in December.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> The RAF continued its bombing raids. The Arabian tribes continued their attacks. </p>
<p>In February 1928 their target was both Iraqi and Kuwaiti villages south and south-west of </p>
<p>Basra. In January 1929 another Nejd tribe crossed the border into Kuwait, killing twenty </p>
<p>Iraqis. Then a third Arabian tribe crossed into Kuwait, killing more than seventy Iraqis </p>
<p>and Kuwaitis.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> Only continued bombing raids from RAF Shaibah near Basra drove the attackers out </p>
<p>of south-western Iraq. In January 1930, Ibn Saud agreed to financial compensation to </p>
<p>the Kuwaitis and Iraqis, and, with British encouragement, in April 1931, a “Treaty of Bon </p>
<p>Voisinage, Friendship and Extradition” was signed in Mecca – the Iraqi Prime Minister, </p>
<p>Nuri Said signing for Iraq.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>The second Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, 1930</b></p>
<p><b>48. </b> In 1930, two years before the end of the Mandate, an all-Iraqi Government was </p>
<p>formed, with the Sunni politician, Nuri Said – who made determined efforts to assuage </p>
<p>Sunni-Shia and Kurdish tensions – as Prime Minister. Nuri Said also negotiated a new </p>
<p>Anglo-Iraqi Treaty establishing “perpetual peace and friendship between His Britannic </p>
<p>Majesty and His Majesty the King of Iraq” as well as “full and frank consultation </p>
<p>between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests”. </p>
<p>Article Five of the Treaty authorised British forces to remain in Iraq after it became </p>
<p>independent in 1932. By the late 1930s these forces were restricted to two RAF stations, </p>
<p>RAF Shaibah near Basra, and RAF Habbaniya west of Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> In November 1930, Nuri Said called a General Election to ratify the Treaty. He was </p>
<p>successful, but the Kurds objected that the Treaty did not meet the undertakings they </p>
<p>believed the British had given a decade earlier to protect their national status, and once </p>
<p>more raised the flag of revolt. For almost two years, RAF Habbaniya was a staging post </p>
<p>for bombing attacks on Kurdish rebels until they were defeated in April 1932.</p>
<p><b>Iraqi independence, 1932</b></p>
<p><b>50. </b> With the ending of the British Mandate in 1932, Iraq entered the League of Nations </p>
<p>as a sovereign State. Britain had fulfilled its pledges and promises – first made when the </p>
<p>British Army entered Baghdad in March 1917 – to give the Iraqis control of their country.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Oil had been discovered in Iraq in 1927. One of the first official acts of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government after independence was to grant a seventy-five-year concession – valid </p>
<p>until 2007 – to the British Oil Development Company, jointly owned by British and </p>
<p>Italian investors.</p>
<p>10 </p>
<p>In 1932 Ibn Saud renamed his three provinces – Najd, al-Ahsa and the Hijaz – as the Kingdom of </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>52. </b> King Feisal died in 1933. He was succeeded by his son, twenty-one-year-old </p>
<p>King Ghazi. Three years later General Bakr Sidqi – a Kurd, a former officer (like </p>
<p>Nuri Said) in the Arab Revolt, and a graduate of a British Staff College, seized power in </p>
<p>Baghdad. In the course of the coup, Nuri Said’s brother-in-law, the Minister of Defence, </p>
<p>was killed. Nuri fled for safety to the British Embassy in Baghdad, and eventually </p>
<p>reached Britain. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> Nationalists in the army resented General Sidqi because of his Kurdish background, </p>
<p>and because he encouraged Kurds to join the army. The Shia could not forgive his brutal </p>
<p>suppression of a Shia revolt in 1936. In 1937 General Sidqi was murdered by a group of </p>
<p>army officers.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> In 1937, King Ghazi began publicly advocating that Iraq annex Kuwait, and </p>
<p>denouncing British influence in the Middle East, under pressure from German diplomats </p>
<p>and Nazi Party representatives in Baghdad. Even the return of Nuri Said at the end of </p>
<p>1938 from London – where he had served for a year as Iraq’s Ambassador to Britain – </p>
<p>could not curb anti-British propaganda, although, to counter it, at the recommendation of </p>
<p>the British Ambassador to Iraq, Sir Archibald Clerk-Kerr, funds were made available to </p>
<p>the British Council in Iraq to help cover the cost of Iraqi students talking examinations </p>
<p>for British universities, and bursaries for their books.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>55. </b> In April 1939, King Ghazi was killed in a car accident. His four-year-old son, </p>
<p>King Feisal II, came to the throne, with one of his uncles, Abdul Illah, as Regent. </p>
<p>In Mosul, after claims that King Ghazi had been murdered by the British, a mob </p>
<p>broke into the British Consulate, dragged out the consul and stoned him to death.</p>
<p><b>Rashid Ali’s revolt, 1941</b></p>
<p><b>56. </b> On the outbreak of war in September 1939, Nuri Said broke off relations with </p>
<p>Germany. For the first eighteen months of the war, while refusing British requests to </p>
<p>declare war on Germany and Italy, he ensured that Iraq was an essential overland and </p>
<p>air link in Britain’s chain of defence from Egypt to India. On 31 March 1941, however, </p>
<p>Nuri Said was forced to resign by a Rashid Ali al-Gaylani. On April 1 the Regent fled </p>
<p>from Baghdad, and two days later Rashid Ali became Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> A Sunni whose family traced their ancestry back to Mohammed, and a lawyer by </p>
<p>training, Rashid Ali had been Minister of Justice in 1924 in Iraq’s first government. In </p>
<p>1930 he had rejected Nuri Said’s Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, and called for an end to the British </p>
<p>connection. He was Prime Minister of Iraq from March to November 1933 and again </p>
<p>from March 1940 to January 1941, when he was dismissed by the Regent for refusing </p>
<p>to allow British troops to transit Iraq, and for entering into negotiations with Germany.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> On becoming Prime Minister for the third time, Rashid Ali seized control of all </p>
<p>the main cities except Basra, restored the amicable relations between Iraq and </p>

<p>Nazi Germany that had been severed by Nuri Said in 1939, and promised the Germans </p>
<p>vital fuel oil from the Mosul oilfields. </p>
<p><b>59. </b> In London, the War Cabinet ordered a brigade of Indian infantry and extra aircraft </p>
<p>to Iraq. “We are not at war with Iraq”, Churchill told the House of Commons on May 7. </p>
<p>“We are dealing with a military dictator who attempted to subvert the constitutional </p>
<p>Government, and we intend to assist the Iraqis to get rid of him and get rid of the military </p>
<p>dictatorship at the earliest possible moment.”</p>
<p><b>60. </b> During the second week of May 1941, the first of thirty German and Italian aircraft </p>
<p>reached Mosul. Flying on to Kirkuk, they took part in air operations against the British </p>
<p>besieging Fallujah, and carried out frequent bombing raids on RAF Habbaniya. On </p>
<p>20 May, the British captured Fallujah, and nine days later were in battle with Rashid Ali </p>
<p>outside Baghdad. Unaware of the small size of the force against him, Rashid Ali fled </p>
<p>under cover of darkness to Iran.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> The Mayor of Baghdad, at the head of a Security Committee of leading Iraqis, </p>
<p>approached British forces outside Baghdad. An armistice was signed, and the monarchy </p>
<p>restored. On 9 October 1941, Nuri Said formed a government acceptable to the British. </p>
<p>Iraqi Ministers who had served under Rashid Ali were removed from all influence, and </p>
<p>in some cases deprived of citizenship and deported. At least seven hundred Rashid Ali </p>
<p>supporters and those with Axis sympathies were interned for the duration of the war.</p>
<p><b>The third Anglo-Iraqi Treaty, 1948</b></p>
<p><b>62. </b> The British military presence in Iraq both before and after Rashid Ali’s revolt was </p>
<p>based on the terms of the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty. When the war ended in 1945, and </p>
<p>as British forces prepared to leave Iraq, Britain’s Labour Government (whose Prime </p>
<p>Minister, Clement Attlee, had been wounded in Mesopotamia in 1917) asked the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq to sign a new military treaty, to give the British even greater powers </p>
<p>than under the 1930 Treaty, and to increase joint Iraqi and British military planning and </p>
<p>cooperation.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> The new Anglo-Iraqi Treaty was approved by the Iraqi Government and by the </p>
<p>Regent. The Prime Minister, Salih Jabr – Iraq’s first Shia Prime Minister – and his </p>
<p>Foreign Minister, accompanied by Nuri Said, went to Britain for the signing ceremony, </p>
<p>held at Portsmouth on 15 January 1948. The signatories were the Iraq delegates and </p>
<p>the British Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> As soon as the Treaty was signed there were mass demonstrations in Baghdad </p>
<p>against it, and against any continuing links with Britain. On 20 January 1948 the British </p>
<p>Consulate at Kirkuk was attacked, and on the following day – six days after the Anglo-</p>
<p>Iraqi Treaty had been signed – the Regent announced that the Treaty did not “realise </p>
<p>the national aspirations of Iraq or consolidate the friendship between the two countries”. </p>
<p>Salih Jabr was replaced as Prime Minister by a leading Shia and former President of </p>
<p>the Iraqi Senate, Sayyid Muhammad al-Sadr, one of Britain’s adversaries of a quarter </p>

<p>of a century earlier. Such British influence as remained waned rapidly. In May 1948 the </p>
<p>British Military Mission was withdrawn.</p>
<p><b>The continuing British contribution</b></p>
<p><b>65. </b> In April 1954, Lord Salter, a senior British civil servant – and former head of the </p>
<p>economic and financial section of the League of Nations Secretariat – was asked by the </p>
<p>Iraq Development Board to advise on the economic advancement of Iraq. His report, </p>
<p>focusing on forward planning, covered water use, agriculture, communications (road, </p>
<p>rail, river and air), industry, housing, health, education and administration. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> Lord Salter’s report was published in 1955 by the Iraq Development Board, </p>
<p>and detailed what Salter described as Iraq’s “exceptional opportunity of achieving </p>
<p>a development which within a few years would substantially increase her economic </p>
<p>resources and raise her general standard of living”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>67. </b> This was to be the last British contribution to the economy of Iraq for many </p>
<p>years. But 1955 was to see another British-Iraqi joint venture, as fear of the spread </p>
<p>of Communism in the Middle East brought Britain and Iraq together again, with the </p>
<p>establishment of the Middle East Treaty Organisation (METO), consisting of Turkey, Iraq, </p>
<p>Iran, Pakistan and Britain, later known as the Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO). </p>
<p><b>68. </b> In 1955, with Iraq a member of CENTO and in close relations with Britain’s armed </p>
<p>forces, RAF Shaibah and RAF Habbaniya were handed over to the Iraqi Air Force. As </p>
<p>part of thie air base agreement, the RAF continued to administer the RAF hospital at </p>
<p>Habbaniya, and agreed to provide medical and surgical in-patient treatment for up to </p>
<p>twenty officers of the Iraqi forces stationed there. In exchange, Iraq also granted free </p>
<p>storage to British personnel using the port at Basra.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>69. </b> In 1956, with Egypt threatening to nationalise the Suez Canal, Nuri Said was invited </p>
<p>to London by the Prime Minister, Anthony Eden, and asked what Iraq wanted for its </p>
<p>friendship. He told Eden that Iraq wanted at least one fighter squadron equipped with </p>
<p>the latest type of aircraft. Eden agreed. Nuri Said added that Iraq wanted all thirty-six </p>
<p>Centurion tanks promised by Britain and a further forty promised by the United States. </p>
<p>Eden said “he felt sure that the tanks could be found from one source or another”. </p>
<p>Nuri Said then said Iraq was interested in the application of atomic energy to peaceful </p>
<p>purposes. Eden offered him a nuclear reactor.</p>

<p><b>The fall of the monarchy, 1958</b></p>
<p><b>70. </b> On 14 July 1958, an army officer, Brigadier Abdel Karim Kassem, seized power </p>
<p>in Baghdad. That day, King Feisal II and many of his family were killed. The British </p>
<p>Embassy in Baghdad was ransacked and set on fire. The Ambassador, Sir Michael </p>
<p>Wright and his wife were held captive at the Embassy until late in the afternoon, when </p>
<p>they were released.</p>

<p> On the following day Nuri Said was murdered in the street.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The monarchy, established by Britain thirty-seven years earlier, was abolished. </p>
<p>Kassem, who was half Sunni, half Kurdish Shia, became Prime Minister, Minister of </p>
<p>Defence and Commander-in-Chief. In 1961, in a blow to British commercial activity and </p>
<p>investment in Iraq, Kassem nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company.</p>
<p><b>Kuwaiti independence</b></p>
<p><b>72. </b> In 1961, Kuwait gained independence from Britain; Iraq immediately claimed </p>
<p>sovereignty. General Kassem mobilised Iraq troops along the Kuwait border. Britain, </p>
<p>which had only recently ended its military presence in Kuwait, sent an expeditionary </p>
<p>force to Kuwait, and persuaded the Arab League to recognise Kuwait as an independent </p>
<p>country. British troops were then replaced by troops of the United Arab Republic (Egypt </p>
<p>and Syria). Britain had honoured its historic commitment to Kuwait.</p>
