<p><b>CONCLUSIONS: THE POST-CONFLICT PERIOD</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses conclusions in relation to evidence of the UK’s role after the </p>
<p>conflict in Iraq, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of UK strategy and deployment plans in response to the </p>
<p>changing security situation, particularly in Basra and the South; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK influence on the development of a new political system in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK influence on US decision-making in relation to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparations for the UK’s post-conflict role in Iraq, which are covered in </p>
<p>Sections 6.4 and 6.5; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>detailed consideration of the de-Ba’athification of Iraqi institutions, which can </p>
<p>be found in Section 11;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK role in the reconstruction of Iraq, and the reform of its Security Sector, </p>
<p>set out in Sections 10 and 12; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of military equipment for use in Iraq, which is covered in </p>
<p>Section 14.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2009, the UK’s most consistent strategic objective in relation to </p>
<p>Iraq was to reduce the level of its deployed forces. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK struggled from the start to have a decisive effect on the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority’s policies, even though it was fully implicated in its decisions as joint </p>
<p>Occupying Power.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US and UK strategies for Iraq began to diverge almost immediately after the conflict. </p>
<p>Although the differences were managed, by early 2007 the UK was finding it difficult </p>
<p>to play down the divergence, which was, by that point, striking. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK missed clear opportunities to reconsider its military approach in </p>
<p>Multi-National Division (South-East). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Throughout 2004 and 2005 it appears that senior members of the Armed Forces </p>
<p>reached the view that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that it would </p>
<p>make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it might have </p>
<p>greater effect. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From July 2005 onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were made under </p>
<p>the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan. Although Iraq remained </p>
<p>the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of a substantial </p>
<p>reinforcement of its forces there. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s plans to reduce troop levels depended on the transition of lead </p>
<p>responsibility for security to the Iraqi Security Forces, even as the latter’s ability </p>
<p>to take on that responsibility was in question. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>471</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK spent time and energy on rewriting strategies, which tended to describe </p>
<p>a desired end state without setting out how it would be reached. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces withdrew from Iraq in 2009 in circumstances which did not meet objectives </p>
<p>defined in January 2003.</p>
<p><b>Objectives and preparation</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> Before the invasion began, the UK defined ambitious objectives for Iraq after the </p>
<p>removal of Saddam Hussein and his regime from power. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> The UK’s strategic objectives for Iraq were described by Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary, in a Written Ministerial Statement on 7 January 2003. The objectives included </p>
<p>the following definition of the UK’s desired end state: </p>
<p>“We would like Iraq to become a stable, united and law abiding state, within </p>
<p>its present borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer </p>
<p>posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its </p>
<p>international obligations and providing effective and representative government to </p>
<p>its own people.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>5. </b> At the Azores Summit on 16 March, Mr Blair, President Bush and Mr José María </p>
<p>Aznar, the Prime Minister of Spain, declared in the ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’:</p>
<p>“We will work to prevent and repair damage by Saddam Hussein’s regime to </p>
<p>the natural resources of Iraq and pledge to protect them as a national asset of </p>
<p>and for the Iraqi people. All Iraqis should share the wealth generated by their </p>
<p>national economy … </p>
<p>“In achieving this vision, we plan to work in close partnership with international </p>
<p>institutions, including the United Nations … If conflict occurs, we plan to seek the </p>
<p>adoption, on an urgent basis, of new United Nations Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>that would affirm Iraq’s territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian </p>
<p>relief, and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq. We will also </p>
<p>propose that the Secretary General be given authority, on an interim basis, to ensure </p>
<p>that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people continue to be met through the </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food program.</p>
<p>“Any military presence, should it be necessary, will be temporary and intended to </p>
<p>promote security and elimination of weapons of mass destruction; the delivery of </p>
<p>humanitarian aid; and the conditions for the reconstruction of Iraq. Our commitment </p>
<p>to support the people of Iraq will be for the long term.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>472</p>
<p><b>6. </b> As described in Sections 6.4 and 6.5, the UK’s pre-invasion planning and preparation </p>
<p>for its role in the Occupation of Iraq was not sufficient to deliver these ambitious </p>
<p>objectives, in part because the UK had placed a great deal of reliance on planning </p>
<p>by the US, as the lead member of the Coalition. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Many of the difficulties which the Coalition encountered after the successful military </p>
<p>campaign had been, or could have been, foreseen. After facing those difficulties during </p>
<p>his six-month posting in Baghdad, in March 2004 Sir Jeremy Greenstock concluded: </p>
<p>“The preparations for the post-conflict stage were abject; wrong analysis, wrong </p>
<p>people …”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The UK hoped that, once the fighting had ceased, the UN would take a leading role </p>
<p>in the reconstruction operation, including the establishment of an Iraqi Government, </p>
<p>facilitating the arrival of resources from the international community and in particular </p>
<p>from nations which had not contributed to the military Coalition.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The UK recognised that it would have responsibility for the area of southern Iraq </p>
<p>controlled by its forces. It aspired to manage the post-conflict response in that region in </p>
<p>such a way that it would be considered “exemplary” in relation to the rest of Iraq, drawing </p>
<p>on resources provided by other nations. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> Although officials had warned that knowledge of conditions within Iraq was </p>
<p>incomplete, it was assumed that Iraq would have a functioning civil service, criminal </p>
<p>justice system and security forces which, after the removal of Ba’athist leadership, would </p>
<p>all play their part in its reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>Overview of the post-conflict period</b></p>
<p><b>11. </b> After the invasion force had rapidly brought down Saddam Hussein’s regime, the </p>
<p>UK’s six-year engagement in Iraq fell into three broad phases, which the Inquiry has </p>
<p>used to provide a simplified framework for describing events:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Occupation –</b> <b>March 2003 to June 2004:</b> during which the UK was formally a </p>
<p>joint Occupying Power alongside the US, and Iraq was governed by the US-led </p>
<p>Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA);</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Transition –</b> <b>June 2004 to the end of 2005:</b> characterised by the increasing </p>
<p>power of Iraqi politicians and institutions, and ending with elections and the </p>
<p>formation of the Maliki Government; and </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Preparation for withdrawal – 2006 to 2009:</b> during which period the </p>
<p>UK sought to transfer its remaining responsibilities in Multi-National </p>
<p>Division (South-East) (MND(SE)) to Iraqi forces so that it could withdraw </p>
<p>its remaining troops. </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>Telegram 109 IraqRep to FCO London, 26 March 2004, ‘Iraq Valedictory: Six Months in the Cauldron’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>473</p>
<p><b>12. </b> In each phase, the UK had dual responsibilities in Iraq: it contributed to the overall </p>
<p>direction of the Coalition’s strategy and to those activities which took place at a national </p>
<p>level, and also led the international effort in MND(SE), comprising the provinces of </p>
<p>Basra, Dhi Qar, Maysan and Muthanna. From the outset, the UK placed particular </p>
<p>emphasis on Basra province, and its capital – Iraq’s second city.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> This Section considers the UK’s dual responsibilities in each phase. </p>
<p><b>Occupation</b></p>
<p><b>Looting in Basra</b></p>
<p><b>14. </b> As described in Section 8, UK forces entered Basra City on the night of 6/7 April </p>
<p>2003 and rapidly gained control, meeting less resistance than anticipated. Once </p>
<p>the city was under its control, the UK was responsible, as the Occupying Power, for </p>
<p>maintenance of law and order. Within its predominantly Shia Area of Operations, the </p>
<p>UK assumed that risks to Coalition Forces would be lower than in the so-called “Sunni </p>
<p>triangle” controlled by the US.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Before the invasion, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) and the Defence </p>
<p>Intelligence Staff had each identified that there was a risk of lawlessness breaking out </p>
<p>in Iraq, and that it would be important to deal with it swiftly. Others, including Mr Blair, </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit (the MOD Permanent Under Secretary) and the Iraq Policy Unit had </p>
<p>recognised the seriousness of that risk.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> However, the formal authorisation for action in Iraq issued by Admiral Sir Michael </p>
<p>Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff, on 18 March contained no instruction on how to </p>
<p>establish a safe and secure environment if lawlessness broke out as anticipated. </p>
<p>Although it was known that Phase IV (the military term for post-conflict operations) </p>
<p>would begin quickly, no Rules of Engagement for that phase, including for dealing with </p>
<p>lawlessness, were created and promulgated before UK troops entered the country.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Both before and during the invasion Lieutenant General John Reith, the Chief </p>
<p>of Joint Operations, made the absence of instructions to UK forces covering what </p>
<p>to do if faced with lawless behaviour by the Iraqi population in Basra explicit to the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Faced with widespread looting after the invasion, and without instructions, UK </p>
<p>commanders had to make their own judgements about what to do. Brigadier Graham </p>
<p>Binns, commanding 7 Armoured Brigade which had taken Basra City, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that he had concluded that “the best way to stop looting was just to get to a point where </p>
<p>there was nothing left to loot”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Although the implementation of tactical plans to deal with lawlessness was properly </p>
<p>the responsibility of in-theatre commanders, it was the responsibility of the Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff and the Chief of Joint Operations to ensure that appropriate Rules of </p>
<p>Engagement were set, and preparations made, to equip commanders on the ground </p>
<p>to deal with it effectively. They should have ensured that those steps were taken. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The impact of looting was felt primarily by the Iraqi population rather than by </p>
<p>Coalition Forces. The latter initially experienced a “honeymoon period”,</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> although the </p>
<p>situation was far from stabilised. </p>
<p><b>21. </b> Lt Gen Reith anticipated that UK forces could be reduced to a medium scale </p>
<p>effort by the autumn, when he expected the campaign to have reached “some form </p>
<p>of ‘steady-state’”.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The JIC correctly judged on 16 April that the local population had high hopes that </p>
<p>the Coalition would rapidly improve their lives and that “resentment of the Coalition … </p>
<p>could grow quickly if it is seen to be ineffective, either politically or militarily. Such </p>
<p>resentment could lead to violence.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>23. </b> By the end of April, Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, had announced that </p>
<p>UK troop levels would fall to between 25,000 and 30,000 by the middle of May, from </p>
<p>an initial peak of around 46,000. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> Consequently, by the start of May there was a clearly articulated expectation of a </p>
<p>rapid drawdown of UK forces by the autumn despite the identified risk that the consent </p>
<p>of the local population was built on potentially vulnerable foundations, which could be </p>
<p>undermined rapidly and with serious consequences. </p>
<p><b>Looting in Baghdad</b></p>
<p><b>25. </b> In the absence of a functioning Iraqi police force and criminal justice system, and </p>
<p>without a clear Coalition Phase IV plan, looting and score-settling became a serious </p>
<p>problem in Baghdad soon after the regime fell. The looting of ministry buildings </p>
<p>and damage to state-owned infrastructure in particular added to the challenges </p>
<p>of the Occupation. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> Reflecting in June 2004, Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Special </p>
<p>Representative on Iraq from March to June 2004, judged that the failure to crack down </p>
<p>on looting in Baghdad in April 2003 released “a crime wave which the Coalition has </p>
<p>never been able to bring fully under control”.</p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>475</p>
<p><b>27. </b> After visiting Iraq in early May 2003, General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General </p>
<p>Staff, observed:</p>
<p>“A security vacuum still exists [in Baghdad] … particularly at night. Looting, </p>
<p>revenge killing and subversive activities are rife … Should a bloody and protracted </p>
<p>insurgency establish itself in Baghdad, then a ripple effect is likely to occur.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Gen Jackson recognised that the UK’s ability to maintain the consent of the </p>
<p>population in the South depended on a stable and secure Baghdad, and advised:</p>
<p>“The bottom line is that if we choose not to influence Baghdad we must be confident </p>
<p>of the US ability to improve [its tactics] before tolerance is lost and insurgency </p>
<p>sets in.” </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Gen Jackson, Major General David Richards (Assistant Chief of the General </p>
<p>Staff) and Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott (Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments)) all offered advice in favour of deploying the UK’s 16 Air Assault Brigade </p>
<p>to Baghdad to support Coalition efforts to retrain Iraqi police officers and get them back </p>
<p>on patrol. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> However, the Chiefs of Staff collectively considered that the benefits of making </p>
<p>a contribution to the security of Baghdad were outweighed by the risk that UK troops </p>
<p>would be “tied down” outside the UK’s Area of Responsibility, with adverse impact, and </p>
<p>advised on 21 May against deploying 16 Air Assault Brigade. The Chiefs of Staff did not </p>
<p>conclude that the tasks it was proposed that 16 Air Assault Brigade should undertake </p>
<p>were unnecessary, but rather that US troops would complete them.</p>
<p><b>UK influence on post-invasion strategy</b></p>
<p>RESOLUTION 1483</p>
<p><b>31. </b> On 21 March 2003, the day after the start of the invasion, Mr Jonathan Powell </p>
<p>and Sir David Manning, two of Mr Blair’s closest advisers, offered him advice on how </p>
<p>to influence the post-invasion US agenda. Key among their concerns was the need </p>
<p>for post-conflict administrative arrangements to have the legitimacy conferred by UN </p>
<p>endorsement. Such UK plans for the post-conflict period as had been developed </p>
<p>relied on the deployment of an international reconstruction effort to Iraq. Controversy </p>
<p>surrounding the launch of the invasion made that challenging to deliver; the absence </p>
<p>of UN endorsement would make it close to impossible. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Discussion between the US and UK on the content of a new UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolution began the same day. Resolution 1483 (2003) was eventually adopted on </p>
<p>22 May. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>476</p>
<p><b>33. </b> US and UK objectives for the resolution were different, and in several substantive </p>
<p>respects the text of resolution 1483 differed from the UK’s preferred position.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> The UK wanted oil revenues to be controlled by an Iraqi body, or failing that by the </p>
<p>UN or World Bank, in line with the pre-invasion promise to use them exclusively for the </p>
<p>benefit of Iraq. Instead, resolution 1483 placed the power to spend the Development </p>
<p>Fund for Iraq into the hands of the CPA, overseen by a monitoring board. That was in </p>
<p>line with US objectives, but did not address UK concerns.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The UK considered that an Interim Iraqi Administration should have real powers, </p>
<p>and not be subordinate to the CPA. Resolution 1483 said that the CPA would retain </p>
<p>its responsibilities until an internationally recognised representative government was </p>
<p>established. The text did not go so far as to require an interim administration to report </p>
<p>formally to the CPA, as the US wished, but that was in effect how the relationship </p>
<p>between the CPA and the Governing Council established by resolution 1483 operated.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The UK’s policy position was that the UN should take the lead in establishing the </p>
<p>Interim Iraqi Administration. Resolution 1483 gave the UN a role working with the people </p>
<p>of Iraq and the CPA, but did not give it the lead. Evidence considered by the Inquiry </p>
<p>suggests that there was consistent reluctance on the part of the UN to take on such </p>
<p>a role and the UK position was therefore not wholly realistic.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Resolution 1483 formally designated the UK and US as joint Occupying Powers </p>
<p>in Iraq. It also set the conditions for the CPA’s dominance over post-invasion strategy </p>
<p>and policy by handing it control of funding for reconstruction and influence on political </p>
<p>development at least equal to that of the UN. </p>
<p>UK INFLUENCE ON THE COALITION PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY</p>
<p><b>38. </b> By the time resolution 1483 was adopted, the CPA was already operating in Iraq </p>
<p>under the leadership of Ambassador L Paul Bremer, reporting to Mr Donald Rumsfeld, </p>
<p>the US Defense Secretary. There was no reporting line from the CPA to the UK. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> The resolution’s designation of the US and UK as joint Occupying Powers did not </p>
<p>reflect the reality of the Occupation. The UK contribution to the CPA’s effort was much </p>
<p>smaller than that of the US and was particularly concerned with Basra. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The UK took an early decision to concentrate its effort in one geographical area </p>
<p>rather than accept a national lead for a particular element of the Coalition effort (such </p>
<p>as police reform). However, it was inevitable that Iraq’s future would be determined </p>
<p>in Baghdad, as both the administrative centre and the place where the power shift </p>
<p>from minority Sunni rule to majority Shia rule was going to be most keenly felt. Having </p>
<p>decided to concentrate its effort on an area some distance removed from the capital, </p>
<p>the UK’s ability to influence policy under debate in Baghdad was curtailed. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> In Baghdad itself, the UK provided only a small proportion of the staff for the military </p>
<p>and civilian headquarters. The low numbers were influenced in part by reasonable </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>477</p>
<p>concerns about the personal legal liabilities of UK staff working initially in the Office </p>
<p>of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance and then in the CPA, and what their </p>
<p>deployment might imply about the UK’s responsibility for decisions made by those </p>
<p>organisations, in the absence of formal consultation or the right of veto. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> The pre-invasion focus on a leading UN role in Iraq meant that little thought had </p>
<p>been given to the status of UK personnel during an occupation which followed an </p>
<p>invasion without Security Council authorisation. Better planning, including proper </p>
<p>assessment of a variety of different possible scenarios, would have allowed such issues </p>
<p>to be worked through at a much earlier stage. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> There was an urgent need for suitably experienced UK officials ready to deploy to </p>
<p>Baghdad, but they had not been identified (see Section 15). </p>
<p><b>44. </b> No governance arrangements were designed before the invasion which might </p>
<p>have enabled officials and Ministers based in London and Washington to manage the </p>
<p>implications of a joint occupation involving separate resources of a very different scale. </p>
<p>Such arrangements would have provided a means to identify and resolve different </p>
<p>perspectives on policy, and to facilitate joint decisions. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Once the CPA had been established, policy decisions were made largely in </p>
<p>Baghdad, where there was also no formal US/UK governance structure. This created </p>
<p>a risk described to the Inquiry by Sir Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser from 2001 to </p>
<p>2006, as “the UK being held jointly responsible for acts or omissions of the CPA, without </p>
<p>a right to consult and a right of joint decision”.</p>

<p><b>46. </b> To manage that risk, the UK proposed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with </p>
<p>the US to establish procedures for working together on issues related to the Occupation, </p>
<p>but it could not be agreed. Having supplied the overwhelming majority of the CPA’s </p>
<p>resources, the US had little incentive to give the UK an influential role in deciding how </p>
<p>those resources were to be used, and the UK lacked the will and leverage to insist. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> In the absence of formal arrangements, there was a clear risk that the UK would </p>
<p>be inadequately involved in important decisions, and the UK struggled from the start </p>
<p>to have a significant effect on the CPA’s policies. This was a source of concern to both </p>
<p>Ministers and officials in 2003, but the issue was never resolved. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Senior individuals deployed to Iraq by the UK at this time saw themselves either as </p>
<p>working for the CPA in support of its objectives and as part of its chain of command, or </p>
<p>as UK representatives within the CPA with a remit to seek to influence CPA decisions. </p>
<p>No-one formally represented the UK position within the CPA decision-making process, </p>
<p>a serious weakness which should have been addressed at an early stage. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Managing a joint occupation of such size and complexity effectively and coherently </p>
<p>required regular formal and informal discussion and clear decision-making at all levels, </p>
<p>both between capitals and in-country. Once attempts to agree an MOU had failed, the </p>
<p>chances of constructing such mechanisms were slim. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> In the absence of an MOU with the US, the UK’s influence in Baghdad depended </p>
<p>heavily on the personal impact of successive Special Representatives and British </p>
<p>Ambassadors to Iraq and the relationships they were able to build with senior </p>
<p>US figures. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Some instances of important CPA decisions in which the UK played little or no </p>
<p>formal part were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision to issue CPA Order No.2, which “dissolved” (or disbanded) </p>
<p>a number of military and other security entities that had operated as part of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime, including the armed forces (see Section 12). This was </p>
<p>raised informally by Ambassador Bremer in his first meeting with Mr John </p>
<p>Sawers, Mr Blair’s Special Representative on Iraq, who – unbriefed – did not at </p>
<p>that point take a contrary position. The concept of creating a new army had also </p>
<p>been raised by Mr Walt Slocombe, CPA Senior Adviser on National Security and </p>
<p>Defense, in discussion with Mr Hoon. Dissolution was a key decision which was </p>
<p>to have a significant effect on the alienation of the Sunni community and the </p>
<p>development of an insurgency in Iraq, and the terms and timing of this important </p>
<p>Order should have been approved by both Washington and London.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Decisions on how to spend the Development Fund for Iraq, which resolution </p>
<p>1483 gave the CPA the power to make. CPA Regulation No.2 subsequently </p>
<p>vested Ambassador Bremer with control of the Fund, effectively placing it </p>
<p>under US control. This exacerbated concerns about the under-resourcing </p>
<p>of CPA(South) as expressed in Mr Straw’s letter to Mr Blair of 5 June 2003 </p>
<p>(see Section 10.1). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The creation of the Iraqi Central Bank as an independent body in July 2003 </p>
<p>(see Sections 9.2 and 10.1). This came as a surprise to the UK despite the </p>
<p>close involvement of officials from the Treasury in arrangements for Iraq’s new </p>
<p>currency and budget. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The creation of a new Iraqi Central Criminal Court (see Section 9.2), the </p>
<p>announcement of which UK officials could not delay for long enough to </p>
<p>enable the Attorney General to give his view on its legality under the terms </p>
<p>of resolution 1483. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Production of the CPA’s ‘Vision for Iraq’ and ‘Achieving the Vision’<i> (</i>see </p>
<p>Sections 9.2 and 10.1<i>).</i> Mr<i> </i>Sawers alerted the FCO to the first document on </p>
<p>6 July when it was already at an advanced stage of drafting, and by 18 July it </p>
<p>had been signed off by the Pentagon. No formal UK approval was sought for </p>
<p>a document which was intended to provide strategic direction to the Coalition’s </p>
<p>non-military effort in Iraq. </p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>52. </b> UK involvement in CPA decisions about the scope and implementation of </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification policy is considered in Section 11.2.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> In some areas, the UK was able to affect CPA policy through the influence that </p>
<p>Mr Sawers or his successor Sir Jeremy Greenstock exerted on senior US officials. Both </p>
<p>used their diplomatic experience to build connections with Iraqi politicians and contribute </p>
<p>to the political development of Iraq. Instances of UK influence included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Sawers’ involvement in the plans for an Interim Iraqi Administration, in </p>
<p>respect of which he considered that “much of the thinking is ours”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s “two chickens, two eggs” plan, which overcame political </p>
<p>stalemate between the CPA and Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani on how the new Iraqi </p>
<p>Constitution should be created. The plan led to the 15 November Agreement </p>
<p>which set the timetable for transfer of sovereignty to a transitional administration </p>
<p>by 30 June 2004. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ensuring that negotiations on the content of the Transitional Administrative Law </p>
<p>reached a successful conclusion. Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>he had prevented the Kurdish delegation from leaving, “which Bremer wasn’t </p>
<p>aware of”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The level of female representation in Iraq’s new political structures, including the </p>
<p>25 percent “goal” for members of the National Assembly set by the Transitional </p>
<p>Administrative Law, which the UK pursued with some success. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> In the absence of decision-making arrangements in which the UK had a formal </p>
<p>role, too much reliance was placed on communication between Mr Blair and President </p>
<p>Bush, one of the very small number of ways of influencing US policy. Some issues were </p>
<p>addressed by this route: for instance, using his regular conversations with President </p>
<p>Bush, Mr Blair was able, with some success, to urge caution in relation to the US </p>
<p>operation in Fallujah in April 2004. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> But the channel of communication between Prime Minister and President should be </p>
<p>reserved for the most strategic and most intractable issues. It is not the right mechanism </p>
<p>for day-to-day policy-making or an effective way of making tactical decisions. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> It is impossible to say whether a greater and more formal UK input to CPA decisions </p>
<p>would have led to better outcomes. But it is clear that the UK’s ability to influence </p>
<p>decisions made by the CPA was not commensurate with its responsibilities as joint </p>
<p>Occupying Power. </p>
<p><b>A decline in security</b></p>
<p><b>57. </b> From early June 2003, and throughout the summer, there were signs that security </p>
<p>in both Baghdad and the South was deteriorating. The MOD’s Strategic Planning </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>480</p>
<p>Group warned that “more organised opposition to the Coalition may be emerging”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> as </p>
<p>discontent about the Coalition’s failure to deliver a secure environment began to grow </p>
<p>in the Iraqi population. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> The extent of the decline in Baghdad and central Iraq overshadowed the decline in </p>
<p>MND(SE). Food shortages and the failure of essential services such as the supply of </p>
<p>electricity and water, plus lack of progress in the political process, however, began to </p>
<p>erode the relationship between UK forces and the local population. The deterioration </p>
<p>was exemplified by attacks on UK forces in Majar al-Kabir in Maysan province on </p>
<p>22 and 24 June. </p>
<p><b>59. </b> As the summer wore on, authoritative sources in the UK, such as the JIC, began to </p>
<p>identify issues with the potential to escalate into conflict and to recognise the likelihood </p>
<p>that extremist groups would become more co-ordinated. The constraint imposed on </p>
<p>reconstruction activities by the lack of security began to be apparent. Mr Sawers and </p>
<p>Sir David Manning expressed concern about whether the UK had sufficient troops </p>
<p>deployed in MND(SE), and about the permeability of Maysan’s substantial border </p>
<p>with Iran. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> From early July, security was seen in Whitehall as the key concern and was raised </p>
<p>by Mr Blair with President Bush. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> A circular analysis began to develop, in which progress on reconstruction required </p>
<p>security to be improved, and improved security required the consent generated by </p>
<p>reconstruction activity. Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments), reported “a decline in Iraqi consent to the Coalition in MND(SE) due to </p>
<p>the failure by the Coalition to deliver improvements in essential services” and that Shia </p>
<p>leaders were warning of a short grace period before further significant deterioration. </p>
<p><b>62. </b> By the autumn of 2003, violence was escalating in Baghdad and attacks were </p>
<p>becoming more sophisticated. Attacks on the UN in August and September, which </p>
<p>injured and killed a number of UN officials including the UN Special Representative for </p>
<p>Iraq, prompted some organisations to withdraw their international staff. Although Basra </p>
<p>was less turbulent than the capital, the risk of a ripple effect from Baghdad – as identified </p>
<p>by Gen Jackson in May – remained. </p>
<p><b>63. </b> The JIC assessed on 3 September that the security environment would probably </p>
<p>worsen over the year ahead. There had been a number of serious attacks on the </p>
<p>Coalition in MND(SE), and Islamic “extremists/terrorists”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> were expected to remain a </p>
<p>long-term threat in Iraq. The UK’s military and civilian representatives on the ground </p>
<p>were reporting a growing insurgency in central Iraq.</p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>481</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Despite that evidence, military planning under the leadership of General </p>
<p>Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, proceeded on the basis that the </p>
<p>situation in Basra would remain relatively benign. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> The Inquiry considers that a deterioration in security could and should have been </p>
<p>identified by Lt Gen Reith by the end of August 2003 and that the cumulative evidence </p>
<p>of a deteriorating security situation should have led him to conclude that the underlying </p>
<p>assumptions on which the UK’s Iraq campaign was based were over-optimistic, and to </p>
<p>instigate a review of the scale of the UK’s military effort in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> There were a number of issues that might have been examined by such a review, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UK had sufficient resources in MND(SE) to deal with a worsening </p>
<p>security situation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UK should engage outside MND(SE) in the interests of Iraq’s </p>
<p>overall stability (as had been advocated by Gen Jackson, Maj Gen Richards </p>
<p>and Lt Gen Pigott).</p>
<p><b>67. </b> No such review took place.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> There was a strong case for reinforcing MND(SE) so that it could handle its high-</p>
<p>priority tasks (providing essential security for reconstruction projects, protecting existing </p>
<p>infrastructure, guarding key sites and improving border security to inhibit the import of </p>
<p>arms from Iran) effectively in changing circumstances. Those tasks all demanded a </p>
<p>higher level of manpower than was available. Although additional military personnel were </p>
<p>deployed in September 2003, mainly to fill existing gaps in support for reconstruction </p>
<p>activities, their numbers were far too small to have a significant impact. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> The failure to consider the option of reinforcement at this time was a serious </p>
<p>omission and Lt Gen Reith and Gen Walker should have ensured that UK force levels in </p>
<p>MND(SE) were formally reconsidered in autumn 2003 or at the latest by the end of the </p>
<p>year. Increases in UK force levels in order to address the security situation should have </p>
<p>been recommended to Ministers. Any opportunity to regain the initiative and pre-empt </p>
<p>further deterioration in the security situation was lost.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> In October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Lieutenant General Ricardo </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>including an attack on the al-Rashid Hotel in Baghdad’s Green Zone, was sufficient to </p>
<p>convince some that a pivotal point in the security situation had been reached. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> When President Bush visited London in November, Mr Blair provided him with a </p>
<p>paper written by Sir Jeremy Greenstock which argued that security should be the highest </p>
<p>priority in the run-up to June 2004, when the Iraqi Transitional Government would take </p>
<p>power. Sir Jeremy suggested that troop levels should be looked at again and highlighted </p>
<p>“the dangers we face if we do not get a grip on the security situation” as a topic that </p>
<p>President Bush and Mr Blair needed to discuss in stark terms. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> The constraints within which the UK was operating as a result of the limited scale </p>
<p>of forces deployed in Iraq were articulated clearly for the Chiefs of Staff in December. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry argued that a strategy of “early effect”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> was needed which prioritised </p>
<p>campaign success. Operation TELIC was the UK “Main Effort”, but deploying additional </p>
<p>resources in a way that was compliant with the Defence Planning Assumptions would </p>
<p>require the withdrawal of resources from other operations. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> On 1 January 2004, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote bluntly: “This theatre remains </p>
<p>a security crisis.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Despite mounting evidence of violent insurgency, the UK’s policy of military </p>
<p>drawdown in Iraq continued. After force levels had been reviewed in January, the </p>
<p>rationale for continued drawdown was based on adjusted criteria by which the success </p>
<p>of Security Sector Reform would be judged, meaning that such reform would be </p>
<p>implemented “only to applicable standards for Iraq”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>Sectarianism</b></p>
<p>The UK’s approach to the development of new political structures for Iraq assumed the </p>
<p>need for an Iraqi Government that was as inclusive and representative as possible. </p>
<p>A more representative government was bound to reflect the views of the Shia majority </p>
<p>more closely. This created a risk of reprisals against members of the minority Sunni </p>
<p>community, of which Saddam Hussein was a member, after many years in which they had </p>
<p>dominated Iraq. </p>
<p>The UK sought to minimise the opportunities for reprisals and to ensure balance, </p>
<p>supported by the JIC’s assessment that “disaffected Sunni Arabs – not necessarily </p>
<p>connected to the former regime – who fear Shia domination and are frustrated by lack of </p>
<p>money and jobs”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>483</p>
<p>Concerns about a lack of balance led to a focus on constitutional arrangements founded </p>
<p>on proportional representation for Shia, Sunni, Kurdish and minority groups, based on </p>
<p>the assumption that those belonging to one confessional or ethnic group could only be </p>
<p>represented fairly by a member of the same group. </p>
<p>The electoral system that developed led to the dominance in government of Islamist </p>
<p>parties such as Dawa and SCIRI from 2005, although UK would have preferred a </p>
<p>moderate secular leader. The UK sought to compensate for the political dominance </p>
<p>of Shia parties by encouraging active outreach to the Sunni community.</p>
<p>The Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) agreed by the Governing Council on 1 March </p>
<p>2004 intended that the National Assembly would have “fair representation” for all Iraq’s </p>
<p>communities. The UK thought of the TAL as a power-sharing arrangement, but it could </p>
<p>not deliver the change of mindset needed to embed genuine sharing of power, notably </p>
<p>a majority willing to listen to the representatives of minority groups. </p>
<p>As described in Section 11.1, the TAL prevented senior Ba’athists from standing </p>
<p>for election unless they had been successful in an appeal to the de-Ba’athification </p>
<p>Commission, and stipulated that “full” members must renounce the Ba’ath Party. Both </p>
<p>measures would mainly affect the Sunni community, and reflected anxiety about a </p>
<p>Ba’athist resurgence. </p>
<p>A key UK objective for the new Iraqi Constitution which would replace the TAL was </p>
<p>to protect the provision that three provinces voting against it would constitute a veto. </p>
<p>Originally considered to be protecting Kurdish interests, after the January 2005 elections </p>
<p>this was also seen an important safeguard for the Sunni community, which had turned out </p>
<p>in very low numbers to vote on membership of the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) </p>
<p>that would draft the Constitution. </p>
<p>In October 2005, the Constitution was approved. Like the TAL, it placed restrictions on </p>
<p>Ba’athists, and the party was banned from participation in “political pluralism in Iraq”. </p>
<p>Although it contained a range of rights and liberties guaranteeing equality before the law </p>
<p>and the right to liberty, the Constitution left some divisive issues unresolved. In particular, </p>
<p>the text did not make explicit how Iraq’s oil and gas reserves would be managed by the </p>
<p>federal government “with the producing governorates and regional governments”; it left </p>
<p>the question of Kirkuk for a referendum; and – despite containing clear statements about </p>
<p>the right to freedom of worship – stated in Article 1 that “No law may be enacted that </p>
<p>contradicts the established provisions of Islam”. </p>
<p>The Constitution continued to reinforce the need for strict confessional/ethic balance. </p>
<p>In relation to the Council of Representatives, the federal legislature, it said that “the </p>
<p>representation of all components of the people shall be upheld in it”. Regarding the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces, it said they would be “composed of the components of the Iraqi people, </p>
<p>with due consideration given to their balance and representation without discrimination or </p>
<p>exclusion”. </p>
<p>In recognition of limited Sunni involvement in its drafting, the Constitution provided for </p>
<p>a committee comprising members of the Council of Representatives “representing the </p>
<p>principal components of the Iraqi society” to recommend amendments. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>484</p>
<p>The combination of ambiguity and an ongoing process may have convinced many Iraqi </p>
<p>communities to support the Constitution, but the failure to resolve some fundamental </p>
<p>issues helped to aggravate increasingly sectarian divisions. </p>
<p><b>The turning point</b></p>
<p><b>75. </b> February 2004 was the worst month for Coalition casualties since the fall of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime. More than 200 people, mainly Iraqi citizens, were killed in suicide </p>
<p>attacks. Attacks on the Iraqi Security Forces were increasing and concerns about Islamic </p>
<p>extremists operating in Iraq began to grow. By the end of March, more than 200 attacks </p>
<p>targeting Iraqi citizens were being reported each week. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> In April, there was a sudden escalation in attacks by the Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) in </p>
<p>Basra, described by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE) as “like a switch had </p>
<p>been flicked”.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> In Fallujah, a US offensive which followed the ambush and murder of </p>
<p>four security contractors provoked an angry response from the Sunni community. </p>
<p><b>77. </b> The significant worsening of security, coupled with revelations of abuse by members </p>
<p>of the US military of Iraqi detainees held in Abu Ghraib prison, led many of the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>witnesses to conclude that the spring of 2004 had been a turning point. </p>
<p><b>78. </b> At the end of April, Mr Blair’s analysis was that the key issue in Iraq was not </p>
<p>multi-faceted, rather it was “simple: security”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>79. </b> Despite the failing security situation in MND(SE) in spring 2004, Gen Walker was </p>
<p>explicit that no additional troops were required for the tasks currently assigned to </p>
<p>the UK. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> The Chiefs of Staff maintained the view they had originally reached in November </p>
<p>2003, that HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) should not be actively considered </p>
<p>for deployment to Iraq, even though:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was a higher priority for the UK than Afghanistan; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>security in Iraq was clearly worsening and had been identified by Mr Blair as </p>
<p>the key issue; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there had been a specific US request for deployment of HQ ARRC.</p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>485</p>
<p><b>Transition</b></p>
<p><b>UK influence on US strategy post-CPA</b></p>
<p><b>81. </b> In June 2004, the US and UK ceased to be Occupying Powers in Iraq and the CPA </p>
<p>was disbanded. Responsibility for day-to-day interaction on civil affairs with the Iraqi </p>
<p>Interim Government passed to the newly appointed British and US Ambassadors.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> After the handover, the UK’s priorities were to maintain the momentum of the </p>
<p>political process towards elections in January 2005, and to ensure that the conditions </p>
<p>for the drawdown of its forces were achieved. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush continued to discuss Iraq on a regular basis. It </p>
<p>continued to be the case that relatively small issues were raised to this level. The UK </p>
<p>took false comfort that it was involved in US decision-making from the strength of that </p>
<p>relationship. </p>
<p><b>84. </b> Themes which Mr Blair emphasised to President Bush included the acceleration </p>
<p>of Security Sector Reform and the Iraqiisation of security, UN engagement, better </p>
<p>outreach to the Sunni community (often referred to as “reconciliation”), provision of direct </p>
<p>support to Prime Minister Ayad Allawi and better use of local media to transmit a positive </p>
<p>message about the coalition’s intentions and actions. </p>
<p><b>Planning for withdrawal</b></p>
<p><b>85. </b> By July 2004, the UK envisaged that, providing the necessary criteria were met, </p>
<p>there would be a gradual reduction in troop numbers during 2005 leading to final </p>
<p>withdrawal in 2006, to be followed by a period of “Strategic Overwatch”.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The most important of the criteria that would enable coalition troops to withdraw was </p>
<p>the ability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take the lead on security (Iraqiisation). Having </p>
<p>recognised that a stable and secure environment was the key factor on which progress </p>
<p>in Iraq depended, by May 2004 the UK solution was “a better and quicker plan for </p>
<p>building Iraqi capacity in the Police, Civil Defence Corps, the Army and the Intelligence </p>
<p>Service”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> This made sense in the long term but was unlikely to meet the requirement </p>

<p>Lt Gen McColl’s paper and his advice that “the time is right for the consideration of the </p>
<p>substantive issues”,</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> the Chiefs of Staff, chaired by Gen Walker, declined to engage in </p>
<p>a substantive review of UK options. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> The Inquiry recognises that the scale of the resources which the UK might have </p>
<p>deployed to deal with the issues was substantially less than the US could bring to bear. </p>
<p>It is possible that the UK may not have been able to make a real difference, when the </p>
<p>key strategic change that might have affected the outcome was the deployment of a </p>
<p>much larger force. But proper consideration ought to have been given to what options </p>
<p>were available, including for the deployment of additional personnel. Mr Straw raised </p>
<p>the need for such a debate with Mr Blair in October. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> The UK had consistently resisted US requests to deploy additional personnel, which </p>
<p>Lt Gen McColl described as having “chipped away at the US/UK relationship”,</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> but in </p>
<p>October it was agreed that the Black Watch would be deployed to North Babil for 30 days </p>
<p>to backfill US forces needed for operations in Fallujah. Approximately 350 personnel </p>
<p>from 1st Battalion, the Royal Highland Fusiliers were also deployed to Iraq to provide </p>
<p>additional security across MND(SE) during the election period in January and February </p>
<p>2005. The UK remained reluctant to commit any further forces in the longer term: when </p>
<p>Dutch forces withdrew from Muthanna province, the UK instead redeployed forces from </p>
<p>elsewhere in MND(SE) plus a small amount of additional logistic support. </p>
<p><b>91. </b> In January 2005, Lt Gen Fry produced a thoughtful and realistic assessment of the </p>
<p>prospects for security in Iraq, observing that “we are not on track to deliver the Steady </p>
<p>State Criteria (SSC) before the UN mandate expires, or even shortly thereafter”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>judged that “only additional military effort by the MNF-I [Multi-National Force – Iraq] as </p>
<p>a whole” might be able to get the campaign back on track. Lt Gen Fry identified three </p>
<p>possible courses of action for the UK: increasing the UK scale of effort, maintaining the </p>
<p>status quo or, if it were judged that the campaign was irretrievable, accepting failure and </p>
<p>seeking to mitigate UK liability.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> The Inquiry endorses Lt Gen Fry’s assessment of the options open to the UK at this </p>
<p>point and considers that full and proper consideration should have been given to each </p>
<p>option by the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP).</p>
<p><b>93. </b> In his advice to Mr Blair on 21 January, Gen Walker did not expose the assessment </p>
<p>made by Lt Gen Fry that only additional military effort by the MNF-I might be able to get </p>
<p>the campaign back on track. </p>

<p>be possible significantly to undermine the insurgency”.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> In April, the JIC assessed that:</p>

<p><b>The impact of Afghanistan</b></p>
<p><b>96. </b> In June 2004, the UK had made a public commitment to deploy HQ ARRC to </p>
<p>Afghanistan in 2006, based on a recommendation from the Chiefs of Staff and Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>and with Mr Straw’s support. HQ ARRC was a NATO asset for which the UK was the </p>
<p>lead nation and provided 60 percent of its staff. </p>
<p><b>97. </b> It appears that senior members of the Armed Forces reached the view, throughout </p>
<p>2004 and 2005, that little more would be achieved in MND(SE) and that it would </p>
<p>make more sense to concentrate military effort on Afghanistan where it might have </p>
<p>greater effect.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> In February 2005, the UK announced that it would switch its existing military effort </p>
<p>in Afghanistan from the north to Helmand province in the south. </p>
<p><b>99. </b> In 2002, <i>A New Chapter</i>, an MOD review of the 1998 Strategic Defence Review </p>
<p>(SDR), had reaffirmed that the UK’s Armed Forces would be unable to support two </p>
<p>enduring medium scale military operations at the same time:</p>
<p>“Since the SDR we have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either </p>
<p>a single major operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the </p>
<p>Gulf War in 1990-91), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a </p>
<p>lesser scale (as in the mid-1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a </p>
<p>second substantial deployment … if this were made necessary by a second crisis. </p>
<p>We would not, however, expect both deployments to involve war-fighting or to </p>
<p>maintain them simultaneously for longer than six months.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>100. </b> As described in Section 16.1, since 2002 the Armed Forces had been consistently </p>
<p>operating at or above the level of concurrency defined in the 1998 SDR, and the </p>
<p>continuation of Op TELIC had placed additional strain on military personnel. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> By May 2005, the UK had been supporting an operation of at least medium scale </p>
<p>in Iraq for more than two years. The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>need to be considered in the context of the requirement to achieve “strategic balance” </p>
<p>with commitments in Afghanistan, to ensure that both were properly resourced. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> In July 2005, DOP agreed proposals for both the transfer of the four provinces in </p>
<p>MND(SE) to Iraqi control and for the deployment of the UK Provincial Reconstruction </p>
<p>Team then based in northern Afghanistan to Helmand province in the South, along with </p>
<p>an infantry battlegroup and full helicopter support – around 2,500 personnel. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> As described under the heading ‘Iraqiisation’ below, the proposals to transfer </p>
<p>responsibility for security in the four provinces of MND(SE) to Iraqi control were based </p>
<p>on high-risk assumptions about the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces to take </p>
<p>the lead for security. If those assumptions proved to be inaccurate and the UK was </p>
<p>unable to withdraw, agreement to the Helmand deployment in Afghanistan effectively </p>
<p>constrained the UK’s ability to respond by increasing troop levels in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>104. </b> In January 2006, Cabinet approved the decision to deploy to Helmand. </p>
<p>Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, announced that the UK was “preparing for </p>
<p>a deployment to southern Afghanistan” which included a Provincial Reconstruction </p>
<p>Team as “part of a larger, more than 3,300-strong British force providing the </p>
<p>security framework”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>105. </b> The impact of that decision was summarised neatly by Gen Walker as:</p>
<p>“Militarily, the UK force structure is already stretched and, with two concurrent </p>
<p>medium scale operations in prospect, will soon become exceptionally so in </p>
<p>niche areas.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Niche capabilities such as helicopter support and Intelligence, Surveillance, Target </p>
<p>Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) were essential to the successful conduct </p>
<p>of operations. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> From July 2005 onwards, decisions in relation to resources for Iraq were effectively </p>
<p>made under the influence of the demands of the UK effort in Afghanistan. Although </p>
<p>Iraq remained the stated UK main effort, the Government no longer had the option of a </p>
<p>substantial reinforcement of its forces there, should it have considered one necessary. </p>
<p>When the US announced in January 2007 that it would send a surge of resources to </p>
<p>Iraq, the UK was consequently unable to contemplate a parallel surge of its own.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The impact of the decision to deploy to Helmand on the availability of key </p>
<p>equipment capabilities for Iraq, and on the level of stretch felt by military personnel, </p>
<p>is addressed in Sections 14 and 16.</p>

<p>489</p>
<p><b>Iraqiisation</b></p>
<p><b>109. </b> After becoming Defence Secretary in May 2005, Dr Reid had continued the policy </p>
<p>of reducing UK troop levels based on the transition of lead responsibility for security </p>
<p>to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). In one of his early acts as Defence Secretary, he </p>
<p>announced the deployment of just over 400 additional personnel to enhance the UK’s </p>
<p>effort in training the ISF, which would “enable them to take on ever greater responsibility </p>
<p>for their own security and so pave the way for UK troops to withdraw”.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The proposals for transfer of the four provinces in MND(SE) to Iraqi control agreed </p>
<p>in July 2005 suggested transition from MNF-I to ISF primacy in Basra from March 2006, </p>
<p>based on the assumption that the ISF would, by that point, be capable of taking on </p>
<p>responsibility for security in what was likely to remain a very challenging environment.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> There was sufficient reliable contemporary evidence available, including from the </p>
<p>JIC and in reports from commanders in theatre, to demonstrate that the assumption that </p>
<p>the ISF would be ready to take the lead in Basra by that point was probably unrealistic.</p>
<p><b>112. </b> In September 2005, Mr Blair expressed his concerns about ISF capability, following </p>
<p>reports of police involvement in attacks on the MNF in Basra. But despite the concerns </p>
<p>that had been expressed about the capacity of the ISF, Dr Reid recommended that a </p>
<p>reduction in UK forces should take place in October or November 2005. </p>
<p><b>113. </b> A few days after Dr Reid made his recommendation, the Jameat incident in Basra </p>
<p>raised questions about the ISF in MND(SE). Officials from the FCO, the MOD and </p>
<p>DFID judged that the incident had highlighted the risks to achieving UK objectives in </p>
<p>MND(SE), and that those risks had implications for military resources. Nevertheless, </p>
<p>assumptions about ISF readiness were not re-examined by Ministers. The incident </p>
<p>should have prompted a more searching analysis of whether the conditions necessary </p>
<p>for drawdown were likely to be met within the planned timetable. Reluctance to consider </p>
<p>the potential implications of the Jameat incident obscured what it had revealed about the </p>
<p>security situation in MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>114. </b> The critical importance of ISF capability in assessing readiness for transfer to </p>
<p>Provincial Iraqi Control, on which UK plans to draw down were based, was emphasised </p>
<p>by the ‘Conditions for Provincial Transfer’ published by the Joint Iraqi/MNF Committee </p>
<p>to Transfer Security Responsibility, and by Dr Reid, who told DOP(I) that “successful </p>
<p>Iraqiisation remains the key”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> DOP(I) decided that Dr Reid should have lead </p>
<p>responsibility for building the capacity of the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) in Basra in </p>
<p>addition to his responsibility for the Iraqi Army.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> In October 2005, Mr Blair asked for a major and sustained push to make progress </p>
<p>on the ability of the ISF to take the lead on security. Gen Jackson raised concerns about </p>

<p>ISF effectiveness in a minute to Gen Walker, and concluded: “it is not to our credit that </p>
<p>we have known about the inadequacies of the IPS for so long and yet failed to address </p>
<p>them”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> The Assessments Staff reinforced the lack of progress in reforming the ISF. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> In October 2005, the Chiefs of Staff made a stark assessment of the insurgency </p>
<p>and coalition strategy in Iraq. They concluded that “Ministers needed to be clear </p>
<p>that the campaign could potentially be heading for ‘strategic failure’, with grave </p>
<p>national and international consequences if the appropriate actions were not taken”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gen Walker judged that only 5 percent of UK military effort in MND(SE) was </p>
<p>devoted to counter-insurgency operations. But neither Air Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, </p>
<p>Chief of Joint Operations, nor Gen Walker reassessed UK force requirements in Iraq, </p>
<p>based on those two assessments. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> The security situation at this point should have resulted in a reassessment of the </p>
<p>UK troop levels needed to achieve the UK’s key outcomes in MND(SE). Although the </p>
<p>responsibility for tactical decision-making rested with commanders on the ground, it was </p>
<p>for Gen Walker to ensure that those commanders had sufficient resources to deliver. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> The absence of additional resources placed further pressure on the UK’s ability </p>
<p>to deliver the conditions required for transfer. At the end of 2005 and in early 2006 </p>
<p>there were further indications that the ISF were not ready to operate alone. The MOD </p>
<p>reported to the final DOP(I) meeting of 2005 that the capacity of the Iraqi administration </p>
<p>and security forces to assume responsibility, acknowledging the challenge of increasing </p>
<p>sectarianism and militia infiltration, was one of the key challenges remaining. </p>
<p><b>119. </b> In March 2006, the JIC again highlighted doubts about the ability of the Iraqi Army </p>
<p>to operate without MNF support and concerns about the corruption and infiltration of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Police Service. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> US concerns about UK plans for the transition of Maysan and Muthanna to Iraqi </p>
<p>control in May were such that Dr Reid adapted them to include a small residual team </p>
<p>providing mentoring and support to the Iraqi Army. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> Dr Reid continued to press ahead with drawdown and announced that troop </p>
<p>levels would reduce in May 2006 from approximately 8,000 to around 7,200 based on </p>
<p>“completion of various security sector reform tasks, a reduction in the support levels for </p>
<p>those tasks, and recent efficiency measures in theatre”.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> That rationale did not include </p>
<p>an assessment of the effect of those tasks on the capability of the ISF.</p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>491</p>
<p><b>Reconciliation</b></p>
<p>One clear focus of UK strategy was the need to bring the Sunni community back into </p>
<p>mainstream Iraqi politics, often referred to as “reconciliation” or “Sunni outreach”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>consistently said that reconciliation was the key to success, and UK Ministers regularly </p>
<p>lobbied their US and Iraqi counterparts about its importance, and the added security risk </p>
<p>if it was neglected. </p>
<p>Reconciliation was hampered from the start. The UK, understandably, had limited </p>
<p>knowledge of Iraq’s complex tribal landscape, and how it interacted with broader </p>
<p>confessional groups. Decisions about the scope and implementation of de-Ba’athification </p>
<p>made in the early days of the CPA had a lasting legacy of mistrust and alienation. </p>
<p>The UK took a number of steps to promote reconciliation, including Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s </p>
<p>meetings with hard-line Sunni nationalists and representatives of Sunni insurgent groups </p>
<p>in November 2005 and February 2006, and work by Lieutenant General Graeme Lamb </p>
<p>with insurgent groups in late 2006 and early 2007. The UK also lobbied for a unity </p>
<p>Government in 2006, but ultimately in vain. Mr Dominic Asquith, British Ambassador </p>
<p>to Iraq, observed that: “For a government of national unity, most of its members are </p>
<p>in opposition.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>Preparation for withdrawal</b></p>
<p><b>A major divergence in strategy</b></p>
<p><b>122. </b> US and UK strategies for Iraq had in effect been on different courses since the UK </p>
<p>decision to focus its attention on MND(SE) in 2003. As a result of that decision, the UK </p>
<p>had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US. It was only marginally involved in </p>
<p>the central tasks of stabilising the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and managing sectarian </p>
<p>divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation </p>
<p>calm while building the case for drawdown. </p>
<p><b>123. </b> For some time, there had been indications of tension between the US and </p>
<p>UK regarding assessments of progress, and differing assumptions about whether </p>
<p>plans were needed for long-term bases in Iraq. In May 2006, Mr Blair was told about </p>
<p>“rumblings from the US system about UK failure to grip the security situation in what they </p>
<p>regard as a strategically vital part of Iraq”.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> Gen Jackson felt compelled to report that:</p>
<p>“The perception, right or wrong, in some – if not all – US military circles is that the </p>
<p>UK is motivated more by the short-term political gain of early withdrawal than by the </p>
<p>long-term importance of mission accomplishment; and that, as a result, MND(SE)’s </p>
<p>operational posture is too laissez faire and lacks initiative …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>492</p>
<p><b>124. </b> In January 2007, the divergence between US and UK strategies was thrown into </p>
<p>sharp relief by President Bush’s announcement that the US would adopt a new strategy, </p>
<p>of which a prominent feature would be the deployment of a surge of US forces, primarily </p>
<p>to Baghdad and its environs. UK assessments of the prospects for the new US policy </p>
<p>were bleak, reflecting widespread pessimism about the prospects for Iraq. UK strategy </p>
<p>continued to look towards withdrawal. </p>
<p><b>125. </b> US concerns about the differences in approach were evident. In February 2007, </p>
<p>Sir David Manning, British Ambassador to the US, reported that Secretary Rice had </p>
<p>asked him “to tell her honestly whether the UK was now making for the exit as fast </p>
<p>as possible”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The divergence in strategies was also illustrated by the conditions-based process </p>
<p>through which the four provinces in MND(SE) were transferred to Provincial Iraqi Control </p>
<p>(PIC) during 2007. Although each transfer was signed off by senior members of the US </p>
<p>military, there was persistent reporting of US concerns about readiness for PIC, whether </p>
<p>the conditions had actually been met and the wider impact of transfer. </p>
<p><b>127. </b> The US was also uncomfortable about arrangements made by the UK with a militia </p>
<p>group in Basra which allowed the safe exit of UK troops from their main base in the city </p>
<p>(see Box entitled ‘Negotiations with JAM1 in Basra’). </p>
<p><b>A possible civil war</b></p>
<p><b>128. </b> By March 2006, senior members of the UK military were considering the possibility </p>
<p>of civil war in Iraq, prompted by rising levels of sectarian violence and concerns that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government was “not … perceived as even-handed in security issues”.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> The risk </p>
<p>of civil war had been acknowledged by Prime Minister Ibrahim Ja’afari in the wake of the </p>
<p>bombing of the al-Askari mosque in February. Although there was general agreement </p>
<p>that the situation in Iraq did not constitute civil war, the risk that one might develop was </p>
<p>considered to be real. </p>
<p><b>129. </b> At this time, the presence in Iraq of the MNF was authorised by resolution 1637 </p>
<p>(2005). The exchange of letters between Prime Minister Ja’afari and the President of the </p>
<p>Security Council which accompanied the resolution clearly identified providing security </p>
<p>for the Iraqi people as the reason why a continued MNF presence was necessary. </p>
<p><b>130. </b> In late April, FCO officials were concerned that security in Basra was declining and </p>
<p>that a determined and sustained effort, including a more assertive military posture, would </p>
<p>be required to deliver the UK’s objective of transferring Basra to Iraqi control by late </p>
<p>2006 or early 2007.</p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>493</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Accounts from mid-2006 suggested that security in MND(SE) was a significant </p>
<p>concern, characterised by “steady, if generally unspectacular, decline”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> and increased </p>
<p>militia activity. The UK military’s approach had generated US concern and the security </p>
<p>situation was limiting UK civilian activity. </p>
<p><b>132. </b> Gen Jackson’s assessment in May of the short-term security prospects in Iraq </p>
<p>was bleak. He judged that “what we will leave behind will not look much like strategic </p>
<p>success. Ten years hence our strategy may fully bear fruit.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>133. </b> After visiting Iraq in early May, Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff, advised Dr Reid that there should be no change to the operational </p>
<p>approach and that there were “compelling reasons” why the UK should “press on” </p>
<p>with handing over security to Iraq, including to permit the UK’s continuing build-up in </p>
<p>Afghanistan.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> ACM Stirrup identified the risk that UK withdrawal from Basra would be </p>
<p>seen as a “strategic failure” and suggested that “astute conditioning of the UK public </p>
<p>may be necessary” to avoid that.</p>
<p><b>134. </b> ACM Stirrup’s view that the UK should press ahead with drawdown despite the </p>
<p>security challenges in Basra was not consistent with Government policy that withdrawal </p>
<p>should be conditions-based. </p>
<p><b>135. </b> ACM Stirrup’s acceptance that the “law of diminishing returns” was “now firmly in </p>
<p>play” and that there was “an increasing risk” that UK forces would “become part of the </p>
<p>problem, rather than the solution” had some validity: it was clear from accounts of the </p>
<p>situation in Basra that UK forces were not preventing a steady decline in security. ACM </p>
<p>Stirrup was also right to advise Dr Reid that the MNF in Iraq faced a “multifaceted”, </p>
<p>sophisticated and dangerous enemy; that serious issues remained in Basra (militia </p>
<p>activity, poor governance, insecurity); and that it was possible the UK would be accused </p>
<p>of strategic failure. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> The established policy was that UK forces would withdraw as the capabilities of the </p>
<p>ISF increased until responsibility could be handed over to the Iraqi Government. ACM </p>
<p>Stirrup’s proposed remedy of continued drawdown and managing public opinion did not </p>
<p>mitigate the risk of strategic failure he described.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> In the summer of 2006, in recognition of the need to stabilise Basra and prepare </p>
<p>it for transition to Iraqi control, the UK developed the Basra Security Plan, “a plan to </p>
<p>improve Basra through operations, high impact reconstruction and SSR [Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform] … lasting for up to six months”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> The military element of the plan became </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>494</p>
<p><b>138. </b> In August 2006, ACM Stirrup was asked to give direction on both seeking US help </p>
<p>for Op SALAMANCA and the possibility of deploying UK forces to support US operations </p>
<p>outside MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>139. </b> While ACM Stirrup stressed the importance of senior Iraqi political support </p>
<p>if Op SALAMANCA was to be a success, Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, </p>
<p>the Senior British Military Representative – Iraq, indicated a concern that even with </p>
<p>US support the capabilities available in MND(SE) might not be sufficient successfully </p>
<p>to deliver Op SALAMANCA. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> ACM Stirrup directed that it was acceptable for the UK to make use of US </p>
<p>enablers, such as aviation, in MND(SE), but that, in general, commitments in MND(SE) </p>
<p>were to be met by existing MND(SE) personnel (including contractors) and any shortfalls </p>
<p>were to be identified and considered appropriately. </p>
<p><b>141. </b> ACM Stirrup also directed that the deployment of UK troops to Multi-National </p>
<p>Division (Centre South): </p>
<p>“… crossed a clear policy ‘red line’ and seemed counter-intuitive, given that </p>
<p>consideration was also being given to obtaining US forces for MND(SE). The UK </p>
<p>needed to draw down its force levels as soon as practicable, both in MND(SE) </p>
<p>and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>142. </b> The decision not to allow the use of US support in Basra was an important one. </p>
<p>The Inquiry considers that the question of what was needed to make Op SALAMANCA </p>
<p>a success should have been addressed directly by ACM Stirrup, whose response instead </p>
<p>precluded proper consideration of whether additional UK resources would be required.</p>
<p><b>143. </b> There was continuing resistance to any suggestion that UK forces should </p>
<p>operate outside MND(SE) and there may have been concern that US participation in </p>
<p>Op SALAMANCA would have led to an obligation on the UK to engage more outside </p>
<p>MND(SE). This might not, as ACM Stirrup observed, be consistent with a commitment </p>
<p>to drawdown, but might have reduced the risk of strategic failure. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> The nature of Op SALAMANCA was constrained by the Iraqi Government in </p>
<p>September 2006, so that the eventual operation (renamed Operation SINBAD) left </p>
<p>“Basra in the hands of the militant militia and death squads, with the ISF unable to </p>
<p>impose, let alone maintain, the rule of law”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> This contributed to the conditions which </p>
<p>led the UK into negotiations with Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) in early 2007. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Attempts were subsequently made to present Op SINBAD as equivalent to the </p>
<p>2007 US surge. Although there was some resemblance between the “Clear, Hold, Build” </p>
<p>tactics to be used by US surge forces and the UK’s tactics for Op SINBAD, the UK </p>
<p>operation did not deploy sufficient additional resources to conduct “Hold” and “Build” </p>

<p>by the UK could not have had the same effect as the more than 20,000 troops surged </p>
<p>into Baghdad and its environs by the US. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> At the end of 2006, tensions between the military and civilian teams in MND(SE) </p>
<p>became explicit. In a report to Mr Blair, Major General Richard Shirreff, General </p>
<p>Officer Commanding MND(SE), diagnosed that the existing arrangement, in which the </p>
<p>Provincial Reconstruction Team was located in Kuwait, “lacks unity of command and </p>
<p>unity of purpose”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> and proposed the establishment of a “Joint Inter-Agency Task Force” </p>
<p>in Basra led by the General Officer Commanding MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>147. </b> ACM Stirrup’s advice to Mr Blair was that it was “too late” to implement </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal. That may have been the right conclusion, but the effect </p>
<p>was to deter consideration of a real problem and of ways in which military and civilian </p>
<p>operations in MND(SE) could be better aligned.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> The adequacy of UK force levels in Iraq and the effectiveness of the UK’s efforts in </p>
<p>MND(SE) were explicitly questioned in Maj Gen Shirreff’s end of tour report.</p>
<p><b>Force Level Review</b></p>
<p><b>149. </b> The balance of forces between Iraq and Afghanistan was reviewed by DOP in </p>
<p>February 2007 on the basis that the UK could only sustain the enduring operational </p>
<p>deployment of eight battlegroups.</p>
<p><b>150. </b> ACM Stirrup’s “strong advice”,</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> with which DOP agreed, was that the UK should </p>
<p>provide two additional battlegroups to the International Security Assistance Force in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, reducing the Iraq to Afghanistan battlegroup ratio from 6:2 to 5:3 and </p>
<p>then 4:4. </p>
<p><b>151. </b> This advice did not include an assessment of either the actual state of security in </p>
<p>Basra or the impact on the UK’s ability to deliver its objectives (including that drawdown </p>
<p>should be conditions-based) and responsibilities under resolution 1723 (2006). The </p>
<p>advice did identify US “nervousness” about the UK proposals. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> In early May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, sought ACM </p>
<p>Stirrup’s advice on the future of the UK military presence in Iraq. ACM Stirrup advised </p>
<p>that the UK should press ahead with drawdown from Iraq on the basis that there was </p>
<p>little more the UK could achieve. There was “no militarily useful mission”.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Blair was concerned about the implications of ACM Stirrup’s position unless </p>
<p>the political circumstances in Basra changed first. He commented: “it will be very hard </p>

<p>50</p>
<p><b>154. </b> After visiting Basra again in mid-May, ACM Stirrup continued to recommend the </p>
<p>drawdown of UK forces. But other contemporary evidence indicated a more negative </p>
<p>picture of circumstances in Basra than ACM Stirrup’s view that:</p>
<p>“… the Iraqis are increasingly in a position to take on responsibility for their own </p>
<p>problems and therefore they might wish to look to propose the south of the country </p>
<p>as a model through which we can recommend a drawdown of forces.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>Negotiations with JAM1 in Basra</b></p>
<p>In 2007, the UK reached an agreement with an individual described by the Inquiry as </p>
<p>JAM1 for an end to the targeting of UK forces by members of the JAM militia in Basra in </p>
<p>exchange for the some detainee releases. </p>
<p>This agreement was a response to the dominance of JAM in Basra, which UK military </p>
<p>commanders had few remaining means to challenge, given the resources available to </p>
<p>them, and the lack of support from the Iraqi Government for Op SALAMANCA. </p>
<p>The agreement was based on the commendable intention to safeguard the lives of </p>
<p>members of the UK military as they defended, and then withdrew from, Basra Palace. </p>
<p>It was a pragmatic tactical response to immensely difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>Those circumstances were at least in part of the UK’s own making, particularly because </p>
<p>of the decisions that had been taken about the balance of resources between Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan. It was humiliating that the UK reached a position in which an agreement </p>
<p>with a militia group which had been actively targeting UK forces was considered the best </p>
<p>option available. It should have been possible for the UK to consider increasing troop </p>
<p>levels in Basra even in 2007/08.</p>
<p>The agreement with JAM1 also had costs, which were little considered by the UK. </p>
<p>Although it allowed withdrawal from Basra Palace without the loss of UK life, it did nothing </p>
<p>to alleviate the impact of JAM activity on the residents of Basra.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> In July 2007, FCO and MOD officials recognised that leaving Basra Palace would </p>
<p>mean moving to PIC in fact if not in name. Mr Brown, who had become Prime Minister </p>
<p>in June, was keen that the gap between leaving the Palace and transfer to PIC should </p>
<p>be as small as possible, since UK situational awareness and ability to conduct </p>
<p>operations in Basra would be limited once the Palace was no longer in use.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> During a visit to Iraq at the start of July, ACM Stirrup sought to convince senior </p>
<p>US officers that Basra was ready for transfer to PIC on the basis that it would not </p>
<p>be possible to demonstrate readiness until after the transfer had taken place. </p>

<p>US Ambassador to Iraq, remained “circumspect” on the timing of PIC.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> They considered </p>
<p>that there remained “significant problems” associated with “unstable politics” and “JAM </p>
<p>infiltration” in Basra. </p>
<p><b>Making the decision to leave Basra Palace</b></p>
<p>In Basra City, occupation of the Basra Palace base was crucial to UK understanding </p>
<p>of what was happening and the consequent risks (known in military terminology as </p>
<p>“situational awareness”). Centrally located, the Palace site was large enough to house </p>
<p>both military and civilian staff, giving them access to Iraqi officials within the city.</p>
<p>The Palace was also a target. By summer 2007, it was considered the “most heavily </p>
<p>mortared and rocketed place in Iraq”,</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> with the result that civilian staff were relocated to </p>
<p>the more secure Basra Air Station on the edge of the city in the autumn.</p>
<p>The ‘in principle’ decision to re-posture/draw down UK forces in Basra, subject to a further </p>
<p>review, was taken by DOP on 14 February 2007. Based on the minutes of that meeting, </p>
<p>those present were entitled to assume that a further collective discussion would take place </p>
<p>before the decision made in principle was implemented.</p>
<p>Before the decision was taken, the issue had been discussed once at DOP, and at its </p>
<p>Sub-Committee on Iraq.</p>
<p>The broad timing of the withdrawal of UK forces from Basra Palace was subsequently </p>
<p>decided by Mr Brown without discussion at the Ministerial Committee on National Security, </p>
<p>International Relations and Development (NSID), the relevant Cabinet committee during </p>
<p>his time in office. The timing was influenced by UK negotiations with JAM1 in Basra, which </p>
<p>could have been discussed by NSID in a restricted session, if necessary.</p>
<p>The risks of withdrawing from the Palace to the UK’s ability to discharge its obligations in </p>
<p>Basra were clearly understood by the MOD and the FCO.</p>
<p>Mr Brown was advised by Mr Simon McDonald (his Foreign Policy Adviser) that the </p>
<p>withdrawal from Basra Palace would result in the loss of situational awareness and </p>
<p>compromise the UK’s ability to discharge its responsibility to help the Government of Iraq </p>
<p>provide security.</p>
<p>Leaving Basra Palace was a significant step towards the eventual withdrawal of UK forces </p>
<p>from Iraq, and it carried risks to the UK’s reputation. Although responsibility for the fine </p>
<p>detail rested with operational commanders, the importance of the decision on broad timing </p>
<p>was demonstrated by the Prime Minister’s involvement. For these reasons, the decision to </p>
<p>withdraw troops should have been formally considered by a group of senior Ministers.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> As they reached the end of their respective tours of duty, both Major General </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>158. </b> During a visit to Iraq in October 2007, ACM Stirrup was briefed by Major </p>
<p>General Graham Binns, General Office Commanding MND(SE) from August 2007 to </p>
<p>February 2008, that the ISF might have only limited ability to cope in the event that JAM </p>
<p>resumed combat operations. The JIC and others also identified continued weaknesses </p>
<p>in the ISF. Their “ability and willingness to maintain security in the South remains patchy </p>
<p>and dependent on MNF training, logistic and specialist air support”.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Deciding the UK role post-PIC</b></p>
<p>Decisions on the UK’s role in Basra post-PIC were also taken without the opportunity for </p>
<p>Ministerial discussion, despite Mr Brown’s 11 September commitment that Cabinet would </p>
<p>have “a further opportunity to discuss” the UK’s future role in Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Brown informed the Overseas and Defence Sub-Committee of the NSID of the content </p>
<p>of his statement to Parliament a few hours before making it on 8 October 2007.</p>
<p>As a consequence, Ministers did not have the chance to explore:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>precisely what the number of troops proposed would be able to deliver; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>conditions in Basra.</p>
<p>The decision had been discussed with the US, and with some Ministers individually, but no </p>
<p>collective discussion took place before 8 October. We cannot now know what difference </p>
<p>such a discussion might have made.</p>
<p>Although bilateral conversations are a useful and necessary part of preparing for </p>
<p>Committee discussion, they are not an adequate substitute. The effective operation </p>
<p>of a system of collective responsibility is founded on the opportunity for informed and </p>
<p>timely discussion.</p>

<p><b>160. </b> In March 2008, Prime Minister Maliki instigated the Charge of the Knights to tackle </p>
<p>militia groups in Basra. That such an important operation came as a surprise was an </p>
<p>indication of the distance between the UK and Iraqi Governments at this point.</p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>499</p>
<p><b>161. </b> When the Charge of the Knights began, the UK found itself to be both </p>
<p>compromised in the eyes of the Iraqi Government and unable to offer significant </p>
<p>operational support, as a result of the tactical decision to negotiate with JAM1and the </p>
<p>absence of situational awareness in Basra after withdrawing from the Palace site. </p>
<p><b>162. </b> On 1 April, ACM Stirrup briefed the NSID(OD) that the UK military task would </p>
<p>be complete by the end of 2008; its timetable would not be affected by the Charge of </p>
<p>the Knights. </p>
<p><b>163. </b> ACM Stirrup’s conclusion that there was no need to review UK drawdown plans </p>
<p>was premature in the light of both the level of uncertainty generated by the Charge of </p>
<p>the Knights and continued questions about the ability of the ISF to take the security </p>
<p>lead in Basra.</p>
<p><b>Did the UK achieve its strategic objectives in Iraq?</b></p>
<p><b>164. </b> From mid-2005 onwards, various senior individuals – officials, military officers and </p>
<p>Ministers – began to consider whether the UK was heading towards “strategic failure” </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The term “strategic failure” was variously used to mean:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of a widespread sectarian conflict or civil war in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“victory” for terrorist groups; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>collapse of the democratic process; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure to achieve the UK’s objectives; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure to achieve a stable and secure environment in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the collapse of the UK/Iraq relationship;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the division of Iraq and the end of its existence as a nation state;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to the UK’s military and political reputation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to the relationship between the US and UK.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> None of the contemporary accounts that the Inquiry has considered reached the </p>
<p>conclusion that strategic failure was inevitable, although most recognised that without </p>
<p>some form of corrective action it was a serious risk. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> Although the UK revisited its Iraq strategy with considerable frequency, no </p>
<p>substantial change in approach was ever implemented: UK troop numbers continued to </p>
<p>reduce; the size of the civilian deployment varied very little; the Iraqiisation of security </p>
<p>and handover of responsibility to the Iraqi Government remained key objectives. </p>
<p><b>168. </b> The Iraq of 2009 certainly did not meet the UK’s objectives as described in January </p>
<p>2003: it fell far short of strategic success. Although the borders of Iraq were the same </p>
<p>as they had been in 2003, deep sectarian divisions threatened both stability and unity. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>Those divisions were not created by the coalition, but they were exacerbated by its </p>
<p>decisions on de-Ba’athification and on demobilisation of the Iraqi Army and were not </p>
<p>addressed by an effective programme of reconciliation. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> In January 2009, the JIC judged “internal political failures that could lead to </p>
<p>renewed violence within and between Iraq’s Sunni, Shia and Kurdish communities”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p>to be the greatest strategic threat to Iraq’s stability. </p>
<p><b>170. </b> The fragility of the situation in Basra, which had been the focus of UK effort in </p>
<p>MND(SE), was clear. The JIC assessed that threats remained from Iranian-backed </p>
<p>JAM Special Groups, and the Iraqi Security Forces remained reliant on support from </p>
<p>Multi-National Forces to address weaknesses in leadership and tactical support. Even </p>
<p>as UK troops withdrew from Basra, the US was sufficiently concerned to deploy its own </p>
<p>forces there, to secure the border and protect supply lines. </p>
<p><b>171. </b> In 2009, Iraq did have a democratically elected Parliament, in which many of </p>
<p>Iraq’s communities were represented. But, as demonstrated by the protracted process </p>
<p>of negotiating agreements on the status of US and then UK forces in Iraq, and the </p>
<p>continued absence of a much-needed Hydrocarbons Law, representation did not </p>
<p>translate into effective government. In 2008, Transparency International judged Iraq to </p>
<p>be the third most corrupt country in the world, and in mid-2009 the Assessments Staff </p>
<p>judged that Government ministries were “riddled with” corruption.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>172. </b> By 2009, it had been demonstrated that some elements of the UK’s 2003 </p>
<p>objectives for Iraq were misjudged. No evidence had been identified that Iraq possessed </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, with which it might threaten its neighbours and the </p>
<p>international community more widely. But in the years between 2003 and 2009, events in </p>
<p>Iraq had undermined regional stability, including by allowing Al Qaida space in which to </p>
<p>operate and unsecured borders across which its members might move. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> The gap between the ambitious objectives with which the UK entered Iraq and </p>
<p>the resources that the Government was prepared to commit to the task was substantial </p>
<p>from the start. Even with more resources it would have been difficult to achieve those </p>
<p>objectives, as a result of the circumstances of the invasion, the lack of international </p>
<p>support, the inadequacy of planning and preparation, and the inability to deliver law and </p>
<p>order. The lack of security hampered progress at every turn. It is therefore not surprising </p>
<p>that, despite the considerable efforts made by UK civilian and military personnel over </p>
<p>this period, the results were meagre. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The Inquiry has not been able to identify alternative approaches that would have </p>
<p>guaranteed greater success in the circumstances of March 2003. What can be said is </p>
<p>that a number of opportunities for the sort of candid reappraisal of policies that would </p>
<p>have better aligned objectives and resources did not take place. There was no serious </p>

<p>strategy and objectives were reconsidered. </p>
<p><b>176. </b> It is important to reassess any strategy in the light of changing circumstances or </p>

<p>Iraq. The production of strategies consumed considerable time and energy, particularly </p>
<p>in government departments, but new strategies did not result in substantial changes of </p>
<p>direction. There are a number of reasons why that was the case. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Crucially, UK strategies tended to focus on describing the desired end state rather </p>
<p>than how it would be reached. On none of the 20 occasions when UK strategy was </p>
<p>reconsidered was a robust plan for implementation produced. Setting a clear direction </p>
<p>of travel is a vital element of an effective strategy, but strategies also require a serious </p>
<p>assessment of the material resources available and how they can best be deployed to </p>
<p>achieve the desired end state. That is especially important when the strategy relates to </p>
<p>an armed conflict in which it will be actively opposed by organised and capable groups. </p>
<p>There is very little evidence of thorough analysis of the resources, expertise, conditions </p>
<p>and support needed to make implementation of UK strategy achievable. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Without properly defined and resourced delivery plans, the UK faced obvious </p>
<p>difficulties in converting strategy into action. Consequently, the strategies that were </p>
<p>developed had limited longevity and impact. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> In the absence of a Cabinet Minister with overall responsibility for Iraq, leadership </p>
<p>on strategy rested with Mr Blair. His judgement regarding the issues holding back </p>
<p>progress was often right. For instance, in April 2004 he recognised that the lack of a </p>
<p>stable and secure environment was key and wrote to President Bush: “The good news is </p>
<p>that the problem we face is not multi-faceted. It is simple: security. The bad news is that </p>
<p>I am not sure we yet have a fully worked-out strategy to tackle it. But we can get one.”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>180. </b> In the UK system, however, the Prime Minister does not lead a department of his </p>
<p>or her own. Mr Blair’s ability to solve the strategic problems he identified therefore relied </p>
<p>on his Cabinet colleagues, and the departments they led, working together. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>502</p>
<p><b>181. </b> A recurring issue between 2003 and 2007 was the difficulty of translating the </p>
<p>Government’s strategy for Iraq into action by departments. The system that drove policy </p>
<p>on the invasion of Iraq, which centered on No.10, could not be easily transformed into </p>
<p>a system for the effective management of the aftermath, in which a coherent collective </p>
<p>effort was needed to pull together the many interrelated strands of activity required. </p>
<p>Although Iraq was designated the UK’s highest foreign policy priority, it was not the top </p>
<p>priority within individual departments. As a consequence, Whitehall did not put significant </p>
<p>collective weight behind the task. </p>
<p><b>182. </b> One indication of that, as described in Section 13, was the failure to resource the </p>
<p>UK effort coherently. Others included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s identification of “definite signs of Iraq fatigue”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> within </p>
<p>Whitehall in September 2004, and his advice to Mr Blair that he would have to </p>
<p>press for greater engagement. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concerns expressed by Sir Nigel and Mr Blair in July 2005 about the ability to </p>
<p>deliver Sir Nigel’s “Comprehensive Strategy”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Jonathan Powell’s identification in September 2005 that amongst those </p>
<p>dealing with Iraq a “weary cynicism and feeling that it is all inevitable has sunk </p>
<p>in”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> and Mr Blair’s recognition that the new strategy proposed would require </p>
<p>Mr Powell to spend “much time pushing it through”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s observation in April 2007 that the FCO and the MOD were unwilling to </p>
<p>push forward further work on reconciliation, meaning “we will have to do it”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>Optimism bias</b></p>
<p><b>183. </b> Throughout the UK’s engagement in Iraq there was a tendency to focus on the </p>
<p>most positive interpretation of events. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> One manifestation of that was failure to give weight to the candid analysis that was </p>
<p>regularly supplied by the JIC, by some commanders in theatre, and by others that things </p>
<p>were going wrong. </p>
<p><b>185. </b> The default position was to judge that negative events were isolated incidents </p>
<p>rather than potential evidence of a trend which should be monitored and which </p>
<p>might require a policy response. This meant that underlying causes were not always </p>
<p>investigated and brought to light. </p>
<p><b>186. </b> This became a particularly serious issue in relation to considering whether the </p>
<p>conditions for transfer to PIC had been met. </p>

<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>503</p>
<p><b>187. </b> One of the most senior individuals displaying this tendency was Mr Des Browne, </p>
<p>who held the post of Defence Secretary from May 2006 to October 2008. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Browne repeatedly downplayed the negative aspects of the situation in Iraq </p>
<p>and failed to ensure the dissemination of a full and unvarnished version of the truth on </p>
<p>the ground in Iraq; and that the UK’s policy was assessed and reviewed with due rigour </p>
<p>based on that information. Mr Browne should himself have proposed a reappraisal of the </p>
<p>UK’s posture and tactics in Basra in 2007, on the basis of the evidence available to him.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> In four instances, Mr Browne gave an unbalanced account of the situation in Basra </p>
<p>to the Prime Minister, Cabinet or Parliament:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 11 January 2007, Mr Browne presented Op SINBAD and the US surge to </p>
<p>DOP(I)<b> </b>as being “entirely consistent”, which did not give a full picture of the </p>
<p>substantial differences between UK and US strategy.<b> </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Browne briefed a meeting of Cabinet on 25 January 2007 that there was no </p>
<p>disagreement between the US and UK on force levels in MND(SE), downplaying </p>
<p>the concerns being raised by senior members of the US Administration. </p>
<p>Mr Browne also painted an extremely positive picture of conditions in Basra, </p>
<p>when other contemporary accounts provided a different view. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From 28 to 31 January 2007, Mr Browne visited Iraq. After returning to the UK, </p>
<p>he continued to stress to DOP the positive effect of Op SINBAD. Mr Browne’s </p>
<p>reassuring report did not take into account: the strength of US objections to </p>
<p>the UK’s approach; the serious risk that the UK would have responsibility </p>
<p>without control in Basra, which was driving consideration of a continued </p>
<p>UK presence in Basra Palace; or evidence of the dangerous situation faced </p>
<p>by ordinary Basrawis.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 1 April 2008, Mr Browne gave a positive account of the reduction of </p>
<p>corruption in the Basra police to Parliament. This painted a significantly more </p>
<p>positive picture than contemporary reporting from those on the ground in Basra. </p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>190. </b> The UK had not participated in an opposed invasion and full-scale occupation of </p>
<p>a sovereign State (followed by shared responsibility for security and reconstruction over </p>
<p>a long period) since the end of the Second World War. The particular circumstances of </p>
<p>Op TELIC are unlikely to recur. Nevertheless, there are lessons to be drawn about major </p>
<p>operations abroad and the UK’s approach to armed intervention.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> The UK did not achieve its objectives, despite the best efforts and acceptance of </p>
<p>risk in a dangerous environment by military and civilian personnel.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Although the UK expected to be involved in Iraq for a lengthy period after the </p>
<p>conflict, the Government was unprepared for the role in which the UK found itself from </p>
<p>April 2003. Much of what went wrong stemmed from that lack of preparation.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>504</p>
<p><b>193. </b> In any undertaking of this kind, certain fundamental elements are of vital </p>
<p>importance:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the best possible appreciation of the theatre of operations, including the political, </p>
<p>cultural and ethnic background, and the state of society, the economy and </p>
<p>infrastructure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a hard-headed assessment of risks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>objectives which are realistic within that context, and if necessary limited – rather </p>
<p>than idealistic and based on optimistic assumptions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allocation of the resources necessary for the task – both military and civil.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> All of these elements were lacking in the UK’s approach to its role in post-conflict </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Where responsibility is to be shared, it is essential to have written agreement in </p>
<p>advance on how decision-making and governance will operate within an alliance or </p>
<p>coalition. The UK normally acts with allies, as it did in Iraq. Within the NATO alliance, the </p>
<p>rules and mechanisms for decision-taking and the sharing of responsibility have been </p>
<p>developed over time and are well understood. The Coalition in Iraq, by contrast, was </p>
<p>an ad hoc alliance.The UK tried to establish some governance principles in the MOU </p>
<p>proposed to the US, but did not press the point. This led the UK into the uncomfortable </p>
<p>and unsatisfactory situation of accepting shared responsibility without the ability to make </p>
<p>a formal input to the process of decision-making. </p>
<p><b>196. </b> As Iraq showed, the pattern set in the initial stage of an intervention is crucial. The </p>
<p>maximum impact needs to be made in the early weeks and months, or opportunities </p>
<p>missed may be lost for ever. It is very difficult to recover from a slow or damaging start. </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Ground truth is vital. Over-optimistic assessments lead to bad decisions. Senior </p>
<p>decision-makers – Ministers, Chiefs of Staff, senior officials – must have a flow of </p>
<p>accurate and frank reporting. A “can do” attitude is laudably ingrained in the UK Armed </p>
<p>Forces – a determination to get on with the job, however difficult the circumstances – but </p>
<p>this can prevent ground truth from reaching senior ears. At times, in Iraq, the bearers </p>
<p>of bad tidings were not heard. On several occasions, decision-makers visiting Iraq </p>
<p>(including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the Chief of the General Staff) </p>
<p>found the situation on the ground to be much worse than had been reported to them. </p>
<p>Effective audit mechanisms need to be used to counter optimism bias, whether through </p>
<p>changes in the culture of reporting, use of multiple channels of information – internal and </p>
<p>external – or use of visits. </p>
<p><b>198. </b> It is important to retain a flexible margin of resources – in personnel, equipment </p>
<p>and financing – and the ability to change tactics to deal with adverse developments </p>
<p>on the ground. In Iraq, that flexibility was lost after the parallel deployment to Helmand </p>
<p>province in Afghanistan, which both constrained the supply of equipment (such as </p>
<p>ISTAR) and took away the option of an effective reinforcement. Any decision to deploy </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.8  |  Conclusions: The post-conflict period</p>
<p>505</p>
<p>to the limit of capabilities entails a high level of risk. In relation to Iraq, the risks involved </p>
<p>in the parallel deployment of two enduring medium scale operations were not examined </p>
<p>with sufficient rigour and challenge. </p>
<p><b>199. </b> The management, in Whitehall, of a cross-government effort on the scale which </p>
<p>was required in Iraq is a complex task. It needs dedicated leadership by someone with </p>
<p>time, energy and influence. It cannot realistically be done by a Prime Minister alone, but </p>
<p>requires a senior Minister with lead responsibility who has access to the Prime Minister </p>
<p>and is therefore able to call on his or her influence in resolving problems or conflicts. </p>
<p>A coherent inter-departmental effort, supported by a structure able to hold departments </p>
<p>to account, is required to support such a Minister.</p>
