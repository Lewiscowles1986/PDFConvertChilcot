<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section contains the Inquiry’s analysis, conclusions and lessons in relation </p>
<p>to the de&#8209;Ba’athification of the Iraqi public sector, the evidence for which is set out in </p>
<p>Section 11.1.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Early decisions on the form of de&#8209;Ba’athification and its implementation had a </p>
<p>significant and lasting negative impact on Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Limiting de&#8209;Ba’athification to the top three tiers of the party, rather than extending </p>
<p>it to the fourth, would have had the potential to be far less damaging to Iraq’s </p>
<p>post&#8209;invasion recovery and political stability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s ability to influence the decision by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) </p>
<p>on the scope of the policy was limited and informal.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK chose not to act on its well&#8209;founded misgivings about handing over the </p>
<p>implementation of de&#8209;Ba’athification policy to the Governing Council.</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>2. </b> Although the US and UK had discussed and recognised the need for it, </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification was one of many areas of post&#8209;invasion activity in Iraq for which </p>
<p>objectives and plans had not been agreed between the two Governments before the </p>
<p>invasion (see Section 6.5). Consequently, no detailed preparations for implementation </p>
<p>of a shared de&#8209;Ba’athification policy were put in place.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The UK lacked the deep understanding of which levels of the Iraqi public sector were </p>
<p>highly politicised that would have been desirable in developing a de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>policy, but did recognise that party membership was likely to have been a matter of </p>
<p>expediency rather than conviction for many Iraqi citizens. Since the UK’s planning </p>
<p>assumption was that a large proportion of the Iraqi civil service would continue to </p>
<p>function under new leadership post&#8209;invasion, the main UK concern was that a light&#8209;touch </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification process should protect administrative capacity for the reconstruction </p>
<p>of the country.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Measures to prevent a resurgence of the Ba’ath Party were important both to ordinary </p>
<p>Iraqi citizens and to Iraqi politicians. The UK recognised the psychological importance </p>
<p>of reassuring both groups that the Ba’athists would not return to power, but did not </p>
<p>fully grasp the extent to which de&#8209;Ba’athification might have consequences for the </p>
<p>relationship between the Shia and Sunni communities. The Coalition did not have a plan </p>
<p>to deal with the tensions which inevitably rose as result. This placed at risk the UK’s </p>
<p>objective that Iraq would become a stable and united state.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> Recognition of the symbolic importance of de&#8209;Ba’athification is clear from its inclusion </p>
<p>in General Franks’ Freedom Message of 16 April 2003, and from the fact that it was the </p>
<p>subject of the first Order issued by the CPA in May 2003.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>11.2  |  Conclusions: De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The UK did have advance sight of the text of the Freedom Message, which </p>
<p>“disestablished” the Ba’ath Party, but did not succeed in having its drafting changed </p>
<p>to reflect concerns raised by lawyers in the FCO.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> In the post&#8209;conflict phase, Secretary Rumsfeld and the Department of Defense </p>
<p>in Washington, and Ambassador Bremer in Baghdad, became the driving forces of </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification policy.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The UK’s absence from formal decision&#8209;making within the CPA (see Section 9.8) </p>
<p>meant that its input to discussion of de&#8209;Ba’athification policy in May 2003 was dependent </p>
<p>on the influence of one particular individual: Mr John Sawers, the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>Special Representative to Iraq. The key policy choice at that point was centred on </p>
<p>whether the top three, or the top four, tiers of the Ba’ath Party should be brought </p>
<p>into scope.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The CPA Order No.1 signed by Ambassador Bremer differed from the UK policy </p>
<p>position on the best approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification. In particular, the decision to bring </p>
<p>the fourth tier</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> of Ba’ath Party members into scope – which increased the number of </p>
<p>individuals potentially affected from around 5,000 to around 30,000 – was considered </p>
<p>by the UK to be disproportionate and likely to deprive Iraqi institutions of much&#8209;needed </p>
<p>capacity.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The Inquiry agrees with the UK’s view, and considers that limiting de&#8209;Ba’athification </p>
<p>to the top three tiers would have had the potential to be far less damaging to Iraq’s </p>
<p>post&#8209;invasion recovery and political stability.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> As Order No.1 was being finalised, UK officials did not propose any attempt at </p>
<p>Ministerial level to influence the policy via Washington. The effect of such an approach </p>
<p>may in any case have been limited as significant policy choices appear to have been </p>
<p>made before Ambassador Bremer deployed to Iraq. Not unreasonably, Mr Sawers </p>
<p>advised against lobbying Washington in the face of a strong desire by the Iraqi </p>
<p>Leadership Group, comprised largely of Shia and Kurdish politicians, for a stringent </p>
<p>approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> However, the UK’s informal acceptance of Order No.1 helped to set the tone for its </p>
<p>relationship with the CPA which persisted throughout the lifespan of the organisation. </p>
<p>Informal consultation with the UK, usually through Mr Sawers and subsequently </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, became the norm.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The Order had consequences. It made the task of reconstructing Iraq more difficult, </p>
<p>both by reducing the pool of Iraqi administrators and by adding to the pool of the </p>
<p>unemployed and disaffected, which in turn fed insurgent activity.</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Down to the rank of Group Member. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>14. </b> After Order No.1 was signed, the UK, having recognised the Order’s potential to </p>
<p>create a pool of disaffected individuals and to deny posts to effective public servants, </p>
<p>urged a pragmatic approach to de&#8209;Ba’athification in its contacts with the US, including </p>
<p>at the highest levels, but with little practical effect.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> In November 2003, the CPA decided to hand responsibility for implementing </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification to the Governing Council (GC). There were misgivings about the </p>
<p>decision in the FCO but, rather than act on them, it relied on assurances that the policy </p>
<p>was to be implemented flexibly.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Although it would have been challenging to create, a more independent oversight </p>
<p>body than the GC would have been more appropriate. The decision to hand over </p>
<p>responsibility for implementation to a political body of this nature was, in the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>view, a mistake which left a critically important area of policy outside the control of the </p>
<p>CPA, with damaging consequences.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> One Iraqi interlocutor suggested to the Inquiry that it would have been preferable for </p>
<p>judges to preside over the process but also recognised that the Iraqi court system was </p>
<p>not in a fit state to take on additional responsibilities in 2003.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> As soon as it was appointed, the High National de&#8209;Ba’athification Commission, </p>
<p>steered by Dr Ahmed Chalabi and Mr Nuri al&#8209;Maliki, took action to toughen the </p>
<p>impact of de&#8209;Ba’athification. Both officials and military commanders recognised </p>
<p>almost immediately that such action was likely to generate further instability, but the </p>
<p>CPA’s decision to hand over responsibility to the GC left the UK unable to intervene. </p>
<p>The UK, however, remained responsible for security in the South in the face of a </p>
<p>growing insecurity.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The enthusiasm for de&#8209;Ba’athification felt by many Iraqi political leaders – </p>
<p>Dr Chalabi and Mr Maliki in particular – may well have made any policy change difficult </p>
<p>to achieve. This enthusiasm reflected a deep&#8209;seated fear within the Shia community of </p>
<p>the resurgence of the Ba’ath Party and a return to Sunni dominance.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> After the appointment of the Interim Transitional Government in June 2004, the </p>
<p>coalition’s responsibilities in Iraq shifted, but it retained considerable influence over the </p>
<p>development of the political process.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> By the time of Iraq’s first post&#8209;invasion elections, de&#8209;Ba’athification had already </p>
<p>been identified as a major political issue because it put a substantial barrier in the way </p>
<p>of Sunni engagement with the political process. Although the UK placed a high premium </p>
<p>on successful and inclusive elections, attempting to remove the barriers imposed by </p>
<p>Order No.1 was not made a priority.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Increasing codification of the extent of de&#8209;Ba’athification, in the Transitional </p>
<p>Administrative Law and then the Iraqi Constitution, was one crucial way in which </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>11.2  |  Conclusions: De&#8209;Ba’athification</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>sectarianism was legitimised in Iraqi political culture, helping to create an unstable </p>
<p>foundation for future Iraqi governments.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Although it is difficult to arrive at a precise figure, the evidence suggests that the </p>
<p>impact of de&#8209;Ba’athification was felt by tens of thousands of rank and file Ba’athists. </p>
<p>De&#8209;Ba’athification continued to be identified as a major Sunni grievance and a source </p>
<p>of sustenance for the insurgency in Iraq as late as 2007.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> As described in Sections 9.6 and 9.7, UK influence in Iraq and its relationship with </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government declined further from 2007. From that point, lacking influence, </p>
<p>there was very little realistic prospect of a UK&#8209;inspired change in the approach to </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The Inquiry concludes that early decisions on the form of de&#8209;Ba’athification and </p>
<p>its implementation had a significant and lasting negative impact on Iraq. This negative </p>
<p>impact was soon recognised by the UK Government, but its efforts to secure a change </p>
<p>of approach were largely ineffective. This became a persistent problem that could </p>
<p>be traced back to both the early failure to have a settled US/UK agreement on how </p>
<p>the big issues of post&#8209;war Iraqi reconstruction would be handled and the improvised </p>
<p>decision&#8209;making leading up to Order No.1.</p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>26. </b> After the fall of a repressive regime, steps inevitably have to be taken to prevent </p>
<p>those closely identified with that regime from continuing to hold positions of influence </p>
<p>in public life. The development of plans which minimise undesired consequences, </p>
<p>which are administered with justice and which are based on a robust understanding </p>
<p>of the social context in which they will be implemented, should be an essential part </p>
<p>of preparation for any post&#8209;conflict phase. This should include measures designed to </p>
<p>address concerns within the wider population, including those of the victims of the old </p>
<p>regime, and to promote reconciliation.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> It is vital to define carefully the scope of such measures. Bringing too many or too </p>
<p>few individuals within scope of measures like de&#8209;Ba’athification can have far&#8209;reaching </p>
<p>consequences for public sector capacity and for the restoration of public trust in the </p>
<p>institutions of government.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> It is also important to think through the administrative implications of the measures </p>
<p>to be applied and the process for their implementation.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The potential for abuse means that it is essential to have thought&#8209;through forms </p>
<p>of oversight that are as impartial and non&#8209;partisan as possible.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> For lessons related to the UK’s involvement in decision&#8209;making within the CPA, </p>
