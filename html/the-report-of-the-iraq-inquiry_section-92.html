<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK analysis of and attempted response to the deterioriating security situation, </p>
<p>including the development of a sectarian insurgency and the emergence of </p>
<p>Al Qaida and of the Jaysh al-Mahdi militia in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consideration of the deployment of UK military assets and HQ ARRC; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s role in the political development of Iraq under the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority, including appointment of the Governing Council, the Transitional </p>
<p>Administrative Law and 15 November Agreement and handover to the Iraqi </p>
<p>Interim Government; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the impact of the first US offensive in Fallujah and the revelations of abuse by </p>
<p>US soliders in Abu Ghraib.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the exclusion of Ba’athists from positions of power in Iraq, which is described in </p>
<p>Section 11; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and reform of its security sector, </p>
<p>which are covered in Sections 10 and 12. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>May 2003: after resolution 1483</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> On 23 May 2003, Ambassador L Paul Bremer, Head of the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority (CPA), issued CPA Order No.2.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The Order dissolved Saddam Hussein’s military and security structures, including </p>
<p>the Ministries responsible for Defence, Information and Military Affairs; the intelligence </p>
<p>agencies; the armed forces; and paramilitary forces. It also announced that the CPA </p>
<p>planned to create a new Iraqi Army, which is described in Section 12.1. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> Following a visit by Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, to Iraq (see </p>
<p>Section 9.1) the Chiefs of Staff had been asked to consider whether the UK should move </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade to Baghdad (16 AA Bde) with the task of providing police training </p>
<p>for six weeks. </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Coalition Provisional Authority Order No.2, 23 May 2003. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>7. </b> A Private Secretary to Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, wrote to Sir David on </p>
<p>23 May to advise that:</p>
<p>“… the Chiefs of Staff judge that the deployment [of 16 AA Bde] … is likely to have </p>
<p>only a marginal effect. It would carry significant risks – of our forces being tied down </p>
<p>in Baghdad and of an adverse impact on our exemplary approach in the South.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The letter explained that the US military did not lack capacity to deal with security </p>
<p>in Baghdad and that it was “safe to assume” that if the situation worsened to a point </p>
<p>where strategic failure seemed possible “they would deploy the resources necessary </p>
<p>to deal with it”.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were therefore of the view that the deployment of 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade “would, at best, not ensure Coalition success but would rather provide only </p>
<p>temporary and limited assistance, the gains from which are likely to be similarly limited”. </p>
<p>It would not have a “strategic impact”. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> The Private Secretary’s letter also said that “the United States does not view such a </p>
<p>deployment as necessary”.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Sir David Manning wrote to Mr Blair on 25 May that he considered most of the </p>
<p>arguments advanced by the MOD to be “spurious”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>12. </b> Sir David suggested that the MOD appeared to have “ventriloquised” discussions </p>
<p>with the US; the views expressed to him by Ambassador Bremer had been different. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, he did not think it worth challenging the advice, suggesting instead that </p>
<p>Mr Blair “urge DFID to press ahead with plans to set up the police training school”.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Sir David wrote to Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary on 27 May, reporting Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>decision to accept the MOD’s advice.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> His letter noted that Ambassador Bremer had </p>
<p>suggested that UK forces would be welcome in Baghdad, in apparent contradiction to </p>
<p>US views quoted by the MOD. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Blair was reported to hope that “US troops will now tackle the issues with the </p>
<p>urgency and efficiency indicated by your letter”. Sir David asked for a report by the end </p>
<p>of the week on “what the Americans are doing to deal with the security in Baghdad, and </p>
<p>the steps they are putting in hand to deal with police training”. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> In his memoir, General David Richards, Assistant Chief of the General Staff in </p>
<p>May 2003, reported that Sir David Manning told him that this letter “included the biggest </p>
<p>bollocking by the Prime Minister in writing that he had ever seen”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Blair’s letter pointed out that advice from the Chiefs of Staff was “at odds with </p>
<p>what Paul Bremer had told John Sawers, David Manning and David Richards’ a few </p>
<p>days earlier” and had “reminded the MOD that the stakes in Iraq were very high, given </p>
<p>the danger that we might be approaching a point of ‘strategic failure’”. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> On 27 May, Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, named Mr Sérgio Vieira de </p>
<p>Mello as his Special Representative to “lead the United Nations effort in Iraq for the next </p>
<p>four months”.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Prior to his appointment, Mr Vieira de Mello was the UN High Commissioner for </p>
<p>Human Rights and Mr Annan explained that he would return to that post at the end of </p>
<p>four months. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Reporting from Baghdad on 27 May, Mr John Sawers, the Prime Minister’s Special </p>
<p>Representative on Iraq, explained that:</p>
<p>“The Americans are going off the idea of an early National Conference, as are many </p>
<p>of the Iraqi parties. Bremer has recommended to Washington that he appoints the </p>
<p>Interim Administration. I have warned him of the danger of veering away from the </p>
<p>SCR [resolution 1483], and have suggested a two stage process – an appointed </p>
<p>Advisory Council soon, transforming into the Interim Administration once it can be </p>
<p>approved by a representative Iraqi gathering.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Sawers reported that Ambassador Bremer proposed that the drafting of a </p>
<p>new Constitution should be directed by another, Iraqi-led, body. His ideas were “with </p>
<p>Washington” for consideration. </p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Sawers commented that:</p>
<p>“There are practical arguments for Bremer’s approach, and we do need the Coalition </p>
<p>to keep tight control at this stage. We also need to find a way of staying within the </p>
<p>terms of the SCR and keeping Vieira de Mello with our plans; and of providing for a </p>
<p>progressive transfer of responsibilities from the Coalition to the Iraqis.”</p>
<p><b>22. </b> On 29 May, Mr Simon McDonald, Principal Private Secretary to Mr Jack Straw, the </p>
<p>Foreign Secretary, wrote to Mr Nicholas Cannon, Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary </p>
<p>for Foreign Affairs, in preparation for a visit to Iraq by Mr Blair.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr McDonald advised that a core requirement for the UK was for the political </p>
<p>process to be compatible with operative paragraph 9 of resolution 1483 (2003). That </p>
<p>meant the Iraqi Interim Administration (IIA) should be set up by the Iraqi people, with the </p>
<p>help of the CPA and working with the UN Special Representative. </p>

<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>24. </b> Mr McDonald explained that although the FCO saw some grounds for US concern </p>
<p>that a National Conference appointing an IIA would open the process up to extremist </p>
<p>groups, there was:</p>
<p>“… a risk too that overt Coalition manipulation of the political process will rob it of </p>
<p>legitimacy and boost popular support for extremist groups … while attracting a lot of </p>
<p>criticism in the region and elsewhere”. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> The FCO instead agreed with Mr Sawers that the Coalition could appoint an </p>
<p>Advisory Council to agree a list of prospective members of an IIA, which would then be </p>
<p>formally approved by the Coalition. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr McDonald’s letter said that the Advisory Council’s role would be essentially </p>
<p>technocratic: to work with the Coalition to ensure provision of basic services. The other </p>
<p>tasks (review of the Constitution, legal and economic reform) were a central part of the </p>
<p>political process, and should emerge from a credible process of consultation with a </p>
<p>representative body of Iraqis. A National Conference remained the best instrument for </p>
<p>this. It was essential that Mr Vieira de Mello be allowed to play a full role, both to comply </p>
<p>with the letter and the spirit of resolution 1483, and to counter allegations that the post-</p>
<p>conflict arrangements were a Coalition fix. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Blair travelled to Iraq on 29 May to meet members of the UK Armed Forces and </p>
<p>“thank them for their part in the successful military campaign … and for their continuing </p>
<p>work on humanitarian and rehabilitation tasks”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>28. </b> The MOD briefed Mr Blair in advance of his visit that the “situation in Iraq is </p>
<p>increasingly safe and secure in the North, and permissive in the South”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Mr Blair’s meeting with Ambassador Bremer during his visit to Basra is described </p>
<p>in Section 10.1.</p>
<p><b>June 2003</b></p>
<p><b>30. </b> Sir David Manning gave an account of Mr Blair’s visit to Iraq to Dr Condoleezza </p>
<p>Rice, US National Security Advisor, and to Mr Andy Card, President Bush’s Chief of </p>
<p>Staff, on 1 June.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Sir David reported his own and Mr Blair’s views that there should be someone in </p>
<p>the  White House, as well as someone in No.10, to whom Ambassador Bremer could </p>
<p>turn when he needed help:</p>
<p>“… administering post-war Iraq through DOD [Department of Defense] was the </p>
<p>wrong profile and the wrong message … politically, it was vital that the lead was </p>

<p>seen to come from the White House in the US with support from the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>office in the UK. It must be clear to everyone that Bremer had direct access to the </p>
<p>President and the Prime Minister and was not obliged to channel everything through </p>
<p>[Defense Secretary] Rumsfeld.” </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that when Mr Blair met President Bush he would “be urging </p>
<p>quick and decisive support of Bremer … he was in no doubt that we must now get a grip </p>
<p>and very quickly”. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> On 1 June, Mr Sawers reported to the FCO on emerging thinking within the CPA </p>
<p>about how to implement plans for an IIA.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> He wrote that: “we have been closely involved </p>
<p>and much of the thinking is ours”. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> The sequence of events was likely to be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Creation of a 30-strong, politically and regionally representative Political Council, </p>
<p>the members of which would propose themselves to the CPA. The Council </p>
<p>would be mainly advisory, but would have powers to appoint interim ministers, </p>
<p>set up special commissions and initiate certain projects as well the right to be </p>
<p>consulted on major policies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Creation of a Council of Interim Ministers, to ensure inter-ministry co-ordination.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Commissions created by the Political Council would make recommendations  </p>
<p>on specific issues (eg a new currency, reform the legal code) to be agreed by </p>
<p>the CPA. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Creation of a Constitutional Convention of between 100 and 200 members to </p>
<p>prepare a new Constitution.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The idea of a National Conference was being “kept in reserve for now”. </p>
<p><b>36. </b> Mr Sawers explained that the proposed sequence had received a “quietly positive” </p>
<p>response from the Leadership Group.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The next step would be to bring Mr Vieira de </p>
<p>Mello on board, but “as we are now demonstrably within the terms [of] SCR 1483 that </p>
<p>should not be too difficult”. </p>
<p><b>37. </b> After reading Mr Sawers’ telegram, Mr Huw Llewellyn, a Legal Counsellor in FCO </p>
<p>Legal Advisers, wrote to the IPU to warn that he was not so confident that Mr Vieira de </p>
<p>Mello would be satisfied the proposals fell within the terms of resolution 1483 because:</p>
<p>“The scrapping (or delay) of the conference will give him both substantive and </p>
<p>presentational problems, and I would anticipate a cautious attitude.”</p>

<p>12 </p>
<p>Telegram 028 IraqRep to FCO London, 1 June 2003, ‘Iraq: Political Process’. </p>
<p>13 </p>
<p>The Leadership Group was comprised of Iraqi politicians drawn from identifiable political and regional </p>
<p>groups and had been established by Gen Garner after his arrival in Baghdad. It included both former </p>
<p>exiles who had returned to Iraq after the fall of Saddam, and those who had remained in Iraq. </p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>Minute Llewellyn to Bristow, 2 June 2003, ‘Iraq: Establishment of the IIA: John Sawers Telegram of </p>
<p>1 June 2003’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that Mr Vieira de Mello had identified that, as </p>
<p>well as an interim administration, there might be a need for some form of transitional </p>
<p>government, because a new Constitution would take time to prepare.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> Iraqi politicians </p>
<p>were concerned that the Constitution “should not be something that emanated from the </p>
<p>United States and Britain; it should be something that they created themselves”. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Sir John also told the Inquiry that it had been agreed by early June that a Political </p>
<p>Council, “an advisory body but with real powers”, was required.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> This needed to </p>
<p>be “genuinely accepted by the Iraqis” as representative. Over 100 individuals were </p>
<p>considered for membership. Party leaders were told that they should not delegate </p>
<p>membership to their subordinates. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> Sir John assessed that the UK had “quite a lot of influence” on the selection of </p>
<p>members, on which Ambassador Bremer was happy for him to take a leading role.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was an area in which he thought that he personally and the British political team </p>
<p>added value because:</p>
<p>“I was able to work with both Bremer and de Mello in a way which was probably </p>
<p>closer at a personal level than they were able to work with one another.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>41. </b> On 2 June, Mr Blair sent a personal Note to President Bush.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>42. </b> Sir David Manning provided copies to Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Mr Hoon’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary and Mr Jonathan Powell (Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff) but instructed “It must not </p>
<p>go wider”. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> In his Note, Mr Blair wrote that: </p>
<p>“I met Jerry Bremer and others in Iraq. He is very impressive, got a real grip and is </p>
<p>doing a great job. But the task is absolutely awesome and I’m not at all sure we’re </p>
<p>geared for it. This is worse than re-building a country from scratch.</p>
<p>“We start from a really backward position. In time, it can be sorted. But time counts </p>
<p>against us …</p>
<p>“My sense is: we’re going to get there but not quickly enough. And if it falls apart, </p>
<p>everything falls apart in the region.” </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Mr Blair suggested that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>security in Baghdad had to be dealt with at once and police training was vital </p>
<p>and urgent;</p>

<p>214</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contracts to rebuild infrastructure had to be let much more quickly;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Coalition’s communications strategy had to be put on a more energetic </p>
<p>footing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in general, the CPA needed greater administrative capacity. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Blair proposed a small US/UK team “with one of our people from our own </p>
<p>circle” to act as a rapid conduit to the President and himself, enabling them to clear the </p>
<p>bureaucratic obstacles immediately.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Blair concluded his Note by explaining that he would be “going back to almost a </p>
<p>war footing” in order to “restore focus” on issues in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> On 3 June, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on Iraq attended by Mr Hoon, Baroness </p>
<p>Amos (the International Development Secretary), Sir Michael Jay (FCO Permanent </p>
<p>Under Secretary), and No.10 officials.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Blair said he had returned from Iraq convinced that “an enormous amount </p>
<p>needed to be done”. He told those present that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CPA lacked grip and organisation, rather than money or staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should “beef up” its involvement in the CPA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a White House/No.10 team to work alongside Mr Sawers and </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a strong civilian team in the South.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CPA and US decision-making processes were too slow – contracts needed </p>
<p>to be processed faster. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>British companies needed to be energised to take up opportunities in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Mr Blair also said that he believed Whitehall should go back to a “war footing” for the </p>
<p>next two to three months, in order to avoid “losing the peace in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> Following the meeting, Mr Cannon commissioned a number of papers to be ready </p>
<p>before a further meeting on 6 June, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a list of 10 to 15 outstanding practical issues for Mr Blair to raise with </p>
<p>President Bush that would “make a big difference to the people of Iraq if they </p>
<p>are resolved”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a note from the FCO on what the UK wanted Mr Vieira de Mello to do;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>advice on how to improve the Iraqi media; and </p>

<p>215</p>
<p><b>51. </b> On 3 June, Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, sent a “quick note </p>
<p>of impressions” to Mr Hoon based on a visit he and General Michael Walker, Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff, had undertaken to Basra and Baghdad.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Sir Kevin wrote:</p>
<p>“The first impression … is an overwhelming sense of the scale and complexity of  </p>
<p>the reconstruction effort required – political, security, infrastructure – and the </p>
<p>continuing lack of the integrated strategy and plans to carry this forward. Although </p>
<p>there are indications that Bremer really is beginning to get to grips with this (and he </p>
<p>agrees with us about the solution to many, but not all, of the problems) the jury is </p>
<p>still out on whether Washington will give him the authority needed … It also means </p>
<p>that the UK has to direct its own limited resources to best effect. This amounts to </p>
<p>two things: assistance with the conceptual planning in Baghdad for the country as </p>
<p>a whole, plus practical contribution where we can … and delivering ‘our’ area in the </p>
<p>South as an exemplar.”</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Sir Kevin reported that:</p>
<p>“The most immediate thing Bremer wants from us – and he is probably right – is still </p>
<p>in the law and order field/police training. He said he was disappointed about 16AAB, </p>

<p><b>55. </b> Mr Rycroft also summarised Ambassador Bremer’s plan for the political process, </p>
<p>which was understood to be:</p>

<p>– … this will then set up a number of Commissions to carry out longer term political </p>

<p>– A Convention of 100-200 members … to prepare a new Constitution …</p>
<p>– This would then lead to the full post-election government.</p>
<p>– Alternatively, there could be an additional phase of transitional government … </p>
<p>which could be chosen by National Conference.”</p>

<p><b>58. </b> Mr Chilcott replied that he could not produce a “serious paper” with the specific </p>

<p><b>59. </b> The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR) met on 5 June, </p>
<p>chaired by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>60. </b> During the meeting, officials from the FCO reported that Ambassador Bremer was </p>
<p>proposing to create an Interim Administration in July which would provide a framework of </p>
<p>different institutions including a Political Council. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> The FCO’s view was that, to strengthen legitimacy, it would be important that </p>
<p>as wide a group of Iraqis as possible joined the process and that the UN Special </p>
<p>Representative agreed that it was consistent with resolution 1483.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair the same day to report discussion at the meeting:</p>
<p>“We [members of the AHMGIR] fully shared your view that an enormous amount </p>
<p>of work remains to be done. We were concerned that the US was not showing </p>
<p>the same energy, focus and drive in the reconstruction effort that they did in the </p>
<p>military campaign. </p>
<p>“Colleagues also felt strongly that the US must not be allowed to take UK support </p>
<p>for granted. Otherwise, as the US ultimately called the shots, we risked being </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Mr Straw asked Mr Blair to raise several issues with President Bush during their </p>
<p>telephone call planned for later in the week. He urged Mr Blair to lobby on behalf of </p>
<p>Siemens UK for access to power supply contracts and encouraged him to seek the </p>
<p>President’s agreement to “a good number of women, we think 20 percent, in Iraq’s new </p>
<p>political institutions”. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr Straw also enclosed a paper written by the FCO United Nations Department </p>
<p>which envisaged a leading role in the political process for Mr Vieira de Mello. It noted </p>
<p>that “long term political stability in Iraq will depend [on] having political parties which are </p>
<p>not drawn up wholly along ethnic/religious lines. Ensuring this will be a difficult task.” </p>
<p><b>66. </b> On the same day, Mr Straw sent a separate, personal letter to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> In it, he </p>
<p>asked Mr Blair to raise a number of points “very forcefully” with President Bush. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The first of those was that the UK “must be fully involved in all decisions [made </p>
<p>by the CPA] since the US has forced us to be jointly responsible for the effect of all </p>
<p>Coalition decisions across Iraq”. Since “the US refused” to agree a Memorandum </p>
<p>of Understanding (MOU) saying that the UK was solely responsible for parts of </p>
<p>southern Iraq:</p>
<p>“… as Peter Goldsmith [the Attorney General] advises (undoubtedly correctly) – we </p>
<p>are jointly liable for all decisions – but many complaints that we are being sidelined </p>
<p>in CPA, below Sawers’ level”. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, while consultation with the US was not perfect, and </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s letter was an expression of frustration, that was one of the reasons that he </p>
<p>had sent people of the calibre of Mr Sawers and then Sir Jeremy Greenstock to Iraq to </p>
<p>ensure that UK views were communicated effectively.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>69. </b> Mr Blair also said that if it had been possible to agree an MOU, that would not itself </p>
<p>have made the relationship work, which instead was based on Mr Blair’s relationship </p>
<p>with President Bush, Mr Straw’s with Mr Colin Powell (the US Secretary of State), </p>
<p>and others. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> Mr Blair held a further meeting on Iraq on 6 June.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> It was attended by Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Gen Walker as well as those who had been present on 3 June. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Mr Cannon reported the main points from the meeting to Mr McDonald. It had been </p>
<p>agreed that Mr Blair should tell President Bush that the UK needed “the decision-making </p>
<p>process on a different footing, so that problems are rapidly referred to the highest level </p>
<p>and obstacles short-cut”. </p>

<p><b>72. </b> It had also been agreed that Mr Blair would write to Mr Bush after the telephone call </p>
<p>to reinforce the UK’s concerns, and to Ambassador Bremer to list specific projects in the </p>
<p>Basra area that required immediate CPA funding.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> At the meeting, “US generals refusing to order troops to deploy on foot” had been </p>
<p>identified as one factor compounding security problems in Baghdad. An unwillingness </p>
<p>to operate at night, predictable patterns of deployment, an inadequate understanding </p>
<p>of the security picture across the city, the impact of de-Ba’athification and a failure to </p>
<p>co-ordinate international police assistance were also listed as contributory factors. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush later on 6 June.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> In his report of the conversation </p>
<p>to Mr McDonald, Mr Cannon wrote that Mr Blair had said that his main concern was </p>
<p>administration; Ambassador Bremer needed to be able to break through the bureaucratic </p>
<p>obstacles that he faced.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Blair raised the difficulty Ambassador Bremer was having accessing the funding </p>
<p>he needed. UK projects in Basra had been affected and Mr Blair said that he would write </p>
<p>to both Ambassador Bremer and President Bush setting out those projects. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> Mr Blair also discussed the security situation with President Bush; General Tommy </p>
<p>Franks, Commander in Chief US Central Command (CENTCOM), and Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer were of the view that it was improving.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>77. </b> In the course of the discussion, Mr Blair also raised the need for action on </p>
<p>replacing Iraq’s currency and the de-Ba’athification process, which are considered in </p>
<p>Sections 10.1 and 11.1 respectively. </p>
<p><b>78. </b> On 9 June, the MOD’s Strategic Planning Group (SPG) submitted a paper to the </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The SPG wrote that: </p>
<p>“The greatest concern remains lawlessness and there are signs that more organised </p>
<p>opposition to the Coalition may be emerging. There are also signs of rising </p>
<p>discontent amongst Iraqis at the Coalition’s failure to deliver a safe and secure </p>
<p>environment. This is most marked in Baghdad …</p>
<p>“Baghdad is the key to success in Iraq … Failures within the city will threaten a </p>
<p>successful conclusion to the campaign. The US recognise this and are responding </p>
<p>… The UK is attempting to provide support and advice to this central effort, </p>
<p>largely through the CPA … But we must also protect our achievements in our </p>
<p>southern AO [Area of Operations] and both the South and the Centre will require </p>
<p>additional resources if we wish to see a sound and lasting strategy developed </p>
<p>and implemented.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The SPG’s key judgements included:</p>
<p>“The UK main effort should be our AO in southern Iraq. It is here we can have the </p>
<p>most direct effect and achieve the exemplary effect HMG seeks.</p>
<p>“We must also assist in developing the wider Iraqi strategy through the CPA … </p>
<p>in order to adequately support our efforts in the South and to ensure they remain </p>
<p>coherent with developments across Iraq. Our military engagement in the South gives </p>
<p>us the equity in decision-making to enable this.”</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The SPG recommended increasing civilian support from the UK to help strengthen </p>
<p>CPA(South), emphasising that: </p>
<p>“This should be a <b>cross-Government effort</b>. Currently the UK military is de facto </p>
<p>in the lead in Southern Iraq, largely for reasons of simple capacity. We should seek </p>
<p>to change this. Firstly the military is reaching the limit of its capacity to engage in </p>
<p>reconstruction … Secondly, but more importantly, it is crucial to transition away </p>
<p>from quasi-military government to civil administration, to free military capacity for its </p>
<p>primary task of providing security, to avoid the impression of a military Occupation </p>
<p>and to hasten the eventual move to Iraqi self-government.”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The paper also raised the possible deployment of NATO’s Allied Rapid Reaction </p>
<p>Corps (ARRC – see Box, ‘The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps’ in Section 9.1) to Iraq, </p>
<p>noting that it was:</p>
<p>“… still a candidate in US minds for a future CJTF-7 [Combined Joint Task  </p>
<p>Force 7] but the acceptability of its use remains unresolved. At the operational </p>
<p>level US commanders clearly still see it as a replacement for V Corps …” </p>
<p><b>82. </b> The SPG observed that the CPA and CJTF-7 were not directly linked:</p>
<p>“This effectively establishes two power bases answering independently to Rumsfeld. </p>
<p>The UK should, therefore, keep a foot firmly in each camp, and consider the </p>
<p>potential role of HQ-ARRC as a future CJTF-7.”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> On 9 June, Ms Cathy Adams, Legal Counsellor to Lord Goldsmith, sent a reply to a </p>
<p>letter of 21 May from FCO Legal Advisers seeking advice on resolution 1483.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>84. </b> Ms Adams explained that FCO Legal Advisers had suggested that the resolution </p>
<p>amounted to a mandate to the Iraqi people to establish a representative government </p>
<p>which limited their choices in determining their political future. Lord Goldsmith had </p>
<p>concluded that this argument went too far. </p>
<p>32 </p>
<p>Letter Adams to Llewellyn, 9 June 2003, ‘Iraq: Effect of Security Council Resolution 1483 on the </p>
<p>Authority of the Occupying Powers’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Ms Adams’ letter said that resolution 1483:</p>
<p>“… confers a clear mandate on the Coalition working with the Special </p>
<p>Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG), to facilitate a process leading </p>
<p>to the establishment by the people of Iraq, first, of an Iraqi interim administration </p>
<p>and subsequently of an internationally recognised representative government. The </p>
<p>resolution clarifies the legitimate scope of activity of the Occupying Powers and </p>
<p>authorises them to undertake actions for the reform and reconstruction of Iraq going </p>
<p>beyond the limitations of Geneva Convention IV and the Hague Regulations. In </p>
<p>some cases such actions must be carried out in co-ordination with the SRSG or in </p>
<p>consultation with the IIA.”</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The letter continued: </p>
<p>“The Attorney agrees, however, that the resolution does not give the Coalition any </p>
<p>authority to control the political process nor engineer the outcome.” </p>
<p><b>87. </b> If the IIA were to be controlled by the Coalition, Ms Adams explained that its </p>
<p>authority would be limited to the powers of its master.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Ms Adams recorded Lord Goldsmith’s concern, based on recent diplomatic </p>
<p>reporting which suggested that the IIA might be a framework rather than a single </p>
<p>institution, that existing plans might not be compatible with resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> Ms Adams recorded that Lord Goldsmith was content that the resolution provided a </p>
<p>clear mandate for the Coalition, working with the Special Representative, to facilitate the </p>
<p>establishment of the IIA by the people of Iraq. But he was clear that the process would </p>
<p>have to be undertaken in strict compliance with the terms of the resolution. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> Since other elements of the resolution required consultation with the IIA: </p>
<p>“Questions therefore may be raised about the legitimacy of Coalition action under </p>
<p>OPs [operative paragraphs] 13 and 16 if there is no IIA, or if it appears that the body </p>
<p>which has been established is not an IIA as envisaged in OP9.” </p>
<p><b>91. </b> Ms Adams’ letter also advised on the effect of resolution 1483 on reconstruction. </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith considered that the resolution did “appear to” mandate the Coalition </p>
<p>to engage in activity beyond the scope of an Occupying Power. Since the Special </p>
<p>Representative’s wider activities were to be carried out in co-ordination with the </p>
<p>Coalition this: </p>
<p>“… must be read as implied recognition of the Coalition’s authority to engage in </p>
<p>such activities … However, to the extent that the Coalition’s involvement in activities </p>
<p>falling under these headings is not otherwise authorised elsewhere in the resolution </p>
<p>or under occupation law, then there is a clear requirement that the Coalition’s action </p>
<p>should be undertaken only in co-ordination with the SRSG.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>92. </b> The letter noted that the resolution clearly imposed joint US/UK responsibility for </p>
<p>spending the Development Fund for Iraq, and advised it was important to ensure the </p>
<p>US Government did not take action in relation to the Fund that was incompatible with </p>
<p>the resolution, explaining:</p>
<p>“The fact that the resolution imposes joint responsibility gives the UK a locus to </p>
<p>argue with the US that we should be fully involved in the decision-taking process. </p>
<p>Anything less would be legally risky.”</p>
<p><b>93. </b> The letter concluded by saying that resolution 1483 authorised the Coalition to </p>
<p>engage in the reconstruction and reform of Iraq to a greater degree than would be </p>
<p>permissible under the provisions of international law in relation to Occupation alone: </p>
<p>“However, it is clear that the resolution does not grant the Coalition full legislative </p>
<p>and executive authority in Iraq, so there is still a need to consider the legality of </p>
<p>specific proposals against the requirements of occupation law and the terms of  </p>
<p>the resolution.”</p>
<p><b>94. </b> In the Annotated Agenda for the 12 June meeting of the AHMGIR, Cabinet Office </p>
<p>officials wrote that Mr Vieira de Mello was playing an active, though cautious, role.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was general recognition that it would prove impossible at this stage to select </p>
<p>candidates for the Political Council by democratic means. The aim remained to have a </p>
<p>Political Council in place by mid-July and the Constitutional Convention shortly after. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> The Annotated Agenda also said that security in the South remained fragile. There </p>
<p>was a risk that Iraqi frustration with the pace of progress could cause the situation to </p>
<p>deteriorate. The UK’s ability to “push the pace” would be constrained by the reduction in </p>
<p>UK military force strength following transition to the 3rd (UK) Division. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the SPG’s paper on the “strategic intent and direction” </p>
<p>of the UK’s contribution to Iraq on 11 June.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> They concluded that it was not possible to </p>
<p>take a decision on the deployment of HQ ARRC until there was clarity from the US about </p>
<p>future command and control arrangements in Iraq. The UK was “currently backward </p>
<p>leaning on its deployment, pending clarification from the US”. </p>
<p><b>97. </b> The minutes record that Mr William Ehrman, FCO Director General Defence and </p>
<p>Intelligence, had “urged caution in arriving at a decision” given “the imperative for the  </p>
<p>UK to conduct exemplar operations in the South and the attendant risk of a deployment </p>
<p>to Baghdad”.</p>

<p>223</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr Hoon told the House of Commons in a Written Ministerial Statement on </p>
<p>11 June that:</p>
<p>“Overall, 25,000 UK servicemen and women have returned from operations in the </p>
<p>Gulf – more than half those originally deployed. Some 17,000 servicemen and </p>
<p>women currently remain in the region.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Hoon said that following further withdrawals and roulements, including the </p>
<p>replacement of HQ 1st (UK) Armoured Division by HQ 3rd (UK) Armoured Division, the </p>
<p>number of UK land forces in Iraq would reduce to around 10,000 by mid-July. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> In addition to land forces, the UK’s maritime presence would be retained at the </p>
<p>existing level (two frigates, a nuclear-powered submarine and two support vessels) and </p>
<p>its air presence would reduce to eight Tornados plus “a number of” supporting aircraft </p>
<p>and 18 helicopters. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> When the AHMGIR met on 12 June, Lord Goldsmith advised that:<b> </b></p>
<p>“It was not clear whether the Interim Administration currently envisaged was entirely </p>
<p>consistent with the resolution [1483] … The resolution does not confer full legislative </p>
<p>powers on the Coalition and therefore individual proposals must be judged on their </p>
<p>merits. If the Interim Administration was under direct Coalition control its powers </p>
<p>would be limited by the Geneva and Hague Conventions and resolution 1483.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>102. </b> Lord Goldsmith undertook to speak to his US counterpart, and to write to Mr Blair </p>
<p>explaining his concerns. He would also advise on the legality of currency reform. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> In the course of the meeting, Ministers observed that UN engagement in the </p>
<p>political process was vital (with DFID offering funding to strengthen Mr Vieira de Mello’s </p>
<p>office) and that the US was still not fully committed to the involvement of women in the </p>
<p>Iraqi political process. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> The AHMGIR noted that it had been decided that the UK area of military operations </p>
<p>would be expanded to cover four governorates, to match the area of CPA(South). </p>
<p>Ministers agreed to take forward measures to improve the synergies between the UK-led </p>
<p>military division in the South, and CPA(South). </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Closing the meeting, Mr Straw commissioned for the next meeting “a short Iraq </p>
<p>strategy paper agreed at UK official level prior to seeking agreement with the US”. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> On 12 June, Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Brenton felt that “some new structures are needed” and recommended that the </p>
<p>UK should: </p>
<p>“… beef up John Sawers’ (and his successor’s) office so that we have a mechanism </p>
<p>in Baghdad which can make effective input on behalf of the UK into CPA decision-</p>
<p>making. We cannot continue to rely on the Sawers/Bremer link alone. Secondly … </p>
<p>we need the Americans to establish a formal decision-making body within the </p>
<p>CPA, on which a UK representative is included – given our responsibilities, we </p>
<p>really should have a formal say, rather than having to depend on friendly influence </p>
<p>and persuasion.” </p>
<p><b>108. </b> On 12 June, a Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) briefing reported that there </p>
<p>was “a trend of intelligence reporting from the UK AOR [Area of Responsibility] showing </p>
<p>increasing dissatisfaction of the civil populace”.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>109. </b> The PJHQ attributed the deterioration in the relationship between UK forces and </p>
<p>the local population to a lack of food, failure to ensure essential services “such as water, </p>
<p>electricity and security”, a general increase in anti-Coalition rhetoric from Shia clerics, </p>
<p>a lack of accurate information/news reporting and a lack of progress in the political </p>
<p>process. The briefing said that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqis are … used to having stability and security, albeit provided by a </p>
<p>dictatorial regime … If these services and a feeling of security fail to transpire … </p>
<p>then attitudes towards the Coalition may well harden … An increase in political </p>
<p>engagement by the Iraqi population, provided it remains short of violence and </p>
<p>insurrection, should be taken as evidence of progress towards normality.”</p>
<p><b>110. </b> On 16 June, a Cabinet Office official wrote to the IPU to propose that work  </p>
<p>on the Iraq strategy paper commissioned by the AHMGIR on 12 June should not </p>
<p>continue because: </p>
<p>“It now transpires that the CPA is in the process of drafting its own strategy/vision </p>
<p>document.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>111. </b> The CPA document was due to be finalised by late June/early July. The Cabinet </p>
<p>Office official recommended:</p>
<p>“Rather than developing a rival UK version, it would seem sensible to use the </p>
<p>existing work we have done as a basis to feed into the US version.” </p>
<p><b>112. </b> Within the CPA’s formal structure, the most senior UK official was </p>
<p>Mr Andy Bearpark, CPA Director of Operations and Infrastructure, who arrived in </p>
<p>Baghdad on 16 June.</p>

<p>225</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Although UK officials in Whitehall regarded Mr Bearpark as the UK’s senior </p>
<p>representative in the CPA, Mr Bearpark saw his primary loyalty as lying with the CPA </p>
<p>and Ambassador Bremer. He told the Inquiry that when he was asked by the UK </p>
<p>Government to go to Iraq:</p>
<p>“It was made very clear to me … I would be expected to concentrate on what is my </p>
<p>professional background … economic reconstruction and physical reconstruction … </p>
<p>[What] I detected was that the British Government would have preferred… it if I was </p>
<p>the deputy administrator. This was never going to be acceptable to Jerry [Bremer].”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>114. </b> Mr Bearpark added: </p>
<p>“I had been given by the British Government to the CPA, but my allegiance was </p>
<p>meant to be 100 percent to the CPA and it was very important that I demonstrated </p>
<p>that allegiance every single day.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>115. </b> On 18 June, Mr Sawers reported Ambassador Bremer’s view that the main security </p>
<p>threat in Iraq still came from former members of Saddam Hussein’s regime and from </p>
<p>Al Qaida.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Ambassador Bremer remained concerned about the risk of Iranian intervention in </p>
<p>Iraq and the activity of a Shia militia known as the Badr Brigade, which had strong links </p>
<p>to Iran, where many of its members had been exiled until the Coalition invasion of Iraq. </p>
<p>However, in his view the priority was:</p>
<p>“… dealing with the Ba’athist remnants and possible al-Qaida elements in the Sunni </p>
<p>areas, and he had no wish to open up a second front at this stage. So no action </p>
<p>would be taken against the Badr brigade for now.”</p>
<p><b>117. </b> In the absence of a meeting of the AHMGIR, on 18 June Cabinet Office officials </p>
<p>provided a paper to bring Ministers up to date.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> They reported that:</p>
<p>“Bremer’s goal remains to convene the Political Council by mid-July, and the </p>
<p>Constitutional Conference as soon as possible thereafter. Bremer’s current plan </p>
<p>is that Constitutional Conference members should be nominated by the Political </p>
<p>Council and from the governorates, with Bremer making the final appointments and </p>
<p>adding members as the CPA thinks necessary to ensure a balanced body.” </p>
<p><b>118. </b> The update recorded progress on female participation, including a women’s </p>
<p>conference planned for 9 July, with a United Nations Development Fund for Women </p>
<p>(UNIFEM) follow-up in August. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>119. </b> The lack of consultation by the CPA persisted, and the paper noted that UK officials </p>
<p>had been unable to delay a recent announcement of a new Central Criminal Court long </p>
<p>enough for the Attorney General to consider its legality. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> It was expected that the immediate consultation problem would be eased by the </p>
<p>return to Baghdad of Mr Sawers, who had been instructed to make clear the UK’s need </p>
<p>for effective co-decision-making. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> The same paper confirmed that Sir Jeremy Greenstock would take over from </p>
<p>Mr Sawers in September. </p>
<p><b>122. </b> The update also said that a “threat of missile attacks is likely to delay the opening </p>
<p>of Baghdad airport to commercial traffic”. </p>
<p><b>123. </b> Secretary Powell raised indications of “British unease about co-ordination and </p>
<p>leadership in Iraq” with Mr Straw on 19 June.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>124. </b> Mr Straw said that the problems “all went back to our suggestion for an MOU which </p>
<p>would have divided the country”. Since that had not been acceptable to the US “we were </p>
<p>now jointly and severely liable for everything that went on in all of Iraq”. They agreed that </p>
<p>a high level of consultation was needed. </p>
<p><b>125. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 19 June that despite negative media comment “progress </p>
<p>was being made in Iraq”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The same day, Mr Sawers reported that “the security situation in the Baghdad area </p>
<p>has taken a turn for the worse” with demonstrations against the Coalition, some of which </p>
<p>resulted in fatalities among the US military.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>127. </b> Mr Sawers asked for the security threat assessment for UK civilian staff to be </p>
<p>updated, observing as he did that “I would not want us to lose</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> UK civilians before we </p>
<p>apply the necessary expertise to the issue”. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> On 24 June, Mr Hoon made a statement in the House of Commons describing two </p>
<p>incidents in Majar al-Kabir, a town in Maysan province.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>129. </b> The first was an attack by Iraqi gunmen on members of the 1st Battalion the </p>
<p>Parachute Regiment in which eight individuals were injured, two very seriously. </p>
<p>There was then a subsequent attack on the helicopter sent to assist them. </p>

<p><b>130. </b> The second resulted in the deaths of six members of the Royal Military </p>
<p>Police (RMP).</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>131. </b> In his statement to Parliament Mr Hoon said he would:</p>
<p>“… caution against reaching any wider conclusions about the overall security </p>
<p>situation in southern Iraq, particularly in the United Kingdom’s Area of Responsibility. </p>
<p>Coalition Forces have worked hard to secure Iraq in the aftermath of decisive </p>
<p>combat operations. They will not be deflected from their efforts by the enemies  </p>
<p>of peace.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>132. </b> A minute provided to Sir David Manning by Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff, described what had happened to the members of the RMP in </p>
<p>Majar al-Kabir: </p>
<p>“On 22 June, house searches by British forces in the town had led to demonstrations </p>
<p>and shots being fired. Subsequent discussion with the British military and local </p>
<p>leaders resulted in an agreement to postpone the searches for one month, however </p>
<p>this agreement was not widely known. As a result an RMP patrol of 24 June was </p>
<p>assumed to indicate plans for further British house searches. A spontaneous </p>
<p>demonstration against the RMP presence followed.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>133. </b> General Sir Peter Wall, former General Officer Commanding 1st (UK) Armoured </p>
<p>Division, described the incident to the Inquiry as:</p>
<p>“… they were making a routine call in accordance with a plan, a planned patrol. </p>
<p>And it is fair to say we had some difficulty with communications, of calling in </p>
<p>reserves, general situational awareness, all of which has been taken account of in </p>
<p>inquiries since the time, but they were subjected to a deliberate attack from a group </p>
<p>of people from a nearby town. It then generated a riot in Majar al-Kabir and we don’t </p>
<p>know the precise catalyst for it. Some of it may be to do with some tribal sensitivity </p>
<p>about the way that we were operating at the time.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>134. </b> On 25 June, Mr Annan called on Mr Blair.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> Part of their hour-long discussion </p>
<p>covered Iraq. </p>
<p><b>135. </b> Mr Annan said that Mr Vieira de Mello had established good relations with </p>
<p>Mr Sawers and Ambassador Bremer. The UN was “encouraging him [Bremer] to go as </p>
<p>fast as possible, or at least set out a political vision, to avoid Iraqi frustration of an overly </p>
<p>long Occuption” and Mr Annan said that Ambassador Bremer should engage more with </p>
<p>the Iraqi public. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Mr Annan commented:</p>
<p>“Bremer was a centraliser – good at taking quick decisions, but there was a risk of </p>
<p>reduced consultation.”</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Mr Annan also warned that:</p>
<p>“… de-Ba’athification had gone too deep, since for most Iraqis it was Saddam, not </p>
<p>Iraq, who had been defeated. We should find a way to reemploy many more former </p>
<p>policemen, as the UN had done in Bosnia.”</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Mr Blair said that de-Ba’thification needed to be implemented “pragmatically and </p>
<p>flexibly” and that he would continue to raise the issue with President Bush. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> The AHMGIR met again on 26 June.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting, </p>
<p>prepared by the Cabinet Office, stated that<b> </b>“the Iraqi Interim Administration will be </p>
<p>composed of a number of elements, including a Political Council, a Constitutional </p>
<p>Convention and reform Commissions”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It reported positive progress on appointing the </p>
<p>Council, but that “finding the right women remains a challenge”. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Cabinet Office officials recorded that Ambassador Bremer: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intended the Political Council to exercise increasing powers over time:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>its two </p>
<p>immediate tasks would be to propose ministers, and to advise the Coalition on </p>
<p>long-term issues such as regulation of political parties, and educational and </p>
<p>judicial reforms;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had given an undertaking that, once the Interim Administration was formed, the </p>
<p>CPA would not take any major decisions without consulting it; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remained keen to establish a Constitutional Conference by the end of July, but </p>
<p>Iraqi participants in the consultation process were undecided whether this should </p>
<p>be elected or appointed, and how.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> The Annotated Agenda said that the UN remained closely involved. The UK was </p>
<p>trying to involve the UN in other aspects of the democratic process, such as holding a </p>
<p>census and drawing up an electoral register.</p>
<p><b>142. </b> The AHMGIR was given a draft of the CPA’s Strategic Plan which the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office described as “a good basis for further work” but “still deficient” and “not in </p>
<p>a form digestible to Iraqi and regional audiences”. It included the CPA’s planning </p>
<p>assumptions that: </p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>Iraqi people will accept the legitimacy of the Interim Administration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The election of an accountable and representative government will be based </p>
<p>upon a Constitution borne [sic] of a popular participative process. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The Iraqi people will support a united national government structure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>143. </b> Cabinet Office officials commented that the plan did not include dates for the </p>
<p>restoration of fully sovereign Iraqi government. It also lacked reference to macro-</p>
<p>economic management, exaggerated the role of the free market, lacked reference to the </p>
<p>environment and did not include proper linkage to resolution 1483.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> In the course of the AHMGIR’s meeting on 26 June, an FCO official emphasised </p>
<p>the importance of keeping Shia groups on board.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> In discussion it was observed that </p>
<p>CPA attention was focused on Baghdad at the expense of the South. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the UK should continue to ensure the involvement </p>
<p>of Iraqis and the UN in the formation of a viable, credible and representative Interim </p>
<p>Administration in a manner consistent with resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> Ministers agreed that officials should push for improvements to the CPA Strategic </p>
<p>Plan, particularly on macro-economic issues and linkage to resolution 1483 but did not </p>
<p>specifically address the absence in the plan of indicative dates for the restoration of a </p>
<p>sovereign government. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> Ministers also asked for a weekly assessment of progress in “each of the key </p>
<p>areas” and a daily update. Reports should bring out what was being done in the South, </p>
<p>what MOD and DFID could do and what would need CPA intervention.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Cabinet met immediately after the AHMGIR on 26 June.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Straw told his Cabinet colleagues that Ambassador Bremer “intended to bring </p>
<p>the Iraqi Political Council into being by the end of July, together with a Constitutional </p>
<p>Convention”. Summing up the meeting, Mr Blair observed that “the coming months </p>
<p>would show more clearly the improvements being made”. </p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Hoon told Cabinet that the preliminary view was that the incidents in  </p>
<p>Majar al-Kabir were isolated and would not affect the way British forces undertook </p>
<p>their security duties in southern Iraq. The issue of bringing to justice those </p>
<p>responsible for the killings remained. </p>
<p><b>151. </b> After Mr Straw had updated Cabinet on reconstruction in Iraq, Mr Blair summed </p>
<p>up that the killings were “a tragic event, but the fact was that rebuilding Iraq was a </p>
<p>difficult task”.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> On 26 June, Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the most senior authority in the Iraqi Shia </p>
<p>community, issued a fatwa stating that the CPA did not have jurisdiction to select the </p>

<p>members of the assembly that would draft the new Iraqi Constitution.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> The fatwa said </p>
<p>that the CPA plan was “unacceptable from the outset”, and that in its place:</p>
<p>“First of all there must be a general election so that every Iraqi citizen – who </p>
<p>is eligible to vote – can choose someone to represent him in a foundational </p>
<p>Constitution prepration assembly. Then the drafted Constitution can be put  </p>
<p>to a referendum.”</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani concluded his fatwa:</p>
<p>“All believers must insist on the accomplishement of this crucial matter and </p>
<p>contribute and contribute to achieving it in the best way possible.”</p>
<p><b>Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani</b></p>
<p>Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani is Iraq’s senior Shia theologian.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Born in Iran, al-Sistani is considered to be the most senior of the four Grand Ayatollahs </p>
<p>based in Najaf, although that position is not a formal one.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> All four advocate the principle </p>
<p>of a clear separation between religion and politics, in contrast to Grand Ayatollah Khomeni </p>
<p>in Iran. They exercise their influence through a network of clerics and mosques, and </p>
<p>through Shia political parties, in particular the Supreme Council for an Islamic Revolution </p>
<p>in Iraq (SCIRI) and Dawa. </p>
<p>As religious leader of around 60 percent of the Iraqi population, al-Sistani has a very </p>
<p>significant influence.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Sir David Manning raised concerns about the US lack of consultation with the UK </p>
<p>with Dr Rice on 27 June.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> Dr Rice indicated that she had heard about the problems, </p>
<p>and had “taken these on board”.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> In a meeting with Mr Hoon on the same day, Dr Rice raised a US concern that </p>
<p>the drawdown of UK forces in southern Iraq meant a lessening of UK commitment to </p>
<p>the area.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Hoon replied that force levels were based on an assessment of the security </p>
<p>situation. In the South “a heavy hand might be a destabilising factor” but more troops </p>
<p>were available “if the situation demanded”. It was important that “significant funds” for </p>
<p>reconstruction flowed into the area if a successful outcome was to be achieved.</p>

<p><b>157. </b> Baroness Amos visited Iraq at the end of June. She provided her immediate </p>
<p>impressions to Mr Blair on 27 June and a detailed report with recommendations for </p>
<p>action on 2 July. Her Principal Private Secretary reported separately on meetings with  </p>
<p>Mr Vieira de Mello and Ambassador Bremer. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> In her detailed report, Baroness Amos noted that security in Baghdad was fragile, </p>
<p>with attacks on US troops on an almost daily basis, and remained a key concern </p>
<p>for Iraqi people.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> The situation appeared to be worsening; it was the overwhelming </p>
<p>and immediate priority without which “little else will be possible”. Security concerns </p>
<p>had reached such a level that the UN planned to scale back its representation in </p>
<p>Baghdad by one third to a total of 200 staff. As a result, Baroness Amos recommended </p>
<p>re-considering the case for additional troops on the ground – either Coalition or Iraqi. </p>
<p><b>159. </b> The attached report said: </p>
<p>“ … in CPA itself, there are still too many people with the wrong skill set – policy </p>
<p>focus rather than operational expertise, and insufficient experience of post-conflict </p>
<p>developing country situations.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Baroness Amos therefore recommended:</p>
<p>“We need more UK people with political skills on the ground. These should be Arabic </p>
<p>speakers, with knowledge of the region, to strengthen capacity in CPA South and </p>
<p>CPA Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> But this approach brought risk:</p>
<p>“UN workers reported that increasingly Iraqis were beginning to lump all foreigners </p>
<p>together. It is just a matter of time before international civilians are caught up in </p>
<p>these attacks [on US troops].” </p>
<p><b>162. </b> In her report, Baroness Amos also highlighted the need to agree and communicate </p>
<p>to the Iraqi people a clear timetable for the political transition to Iraqi self-government. </p>
<p>She observed that:</p>
<p>“Until Iraqis can see that we are serious about handing authority back to them, and </p>
<p>can see a defined process leading to the withdrawal of Coalition Forces, they will </p>
<p>continue to doubt our intent and the reasons for our continuing presence.” </p>
<p><b>163. </b> Baroness Amos asked Mr Blair to raise with President Bush in their telephone </p>
<p>conversation scheduled for 3 July the urgent need to get a grip on the security situation </p>
<p>as well as:</p>
<p>“… the need for a public and well communicated timetable for the political transition </p>
<p>to Iraqi self-government. An immediate objective would be to transfer maximum </p>
<p>authority to Iraqi ‘ministers’ appointed by the Governing Council – we should put </p>
<p>Iraqis in charge of helping to sort out the problems that Iraq faces.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>164. </b> In her covering letter, Baroness Amos wrote that “the UK focus in security in the </p>
<p>South, leaving security in Baghdad largely to the US, is not good enough”. </p>
<p><b>165. </b> Baroness Amos’ Principal Private Secretary reported that Baroness Amos</p>
<p> </p>
<p>had </p>
<p>asked Mr Vieira de Mello whether the establishment of a Political Council, followed by </p>
<p>the drafting and agreement of a Constitution leading to elections in around two years </p>
<p>would be acceptable to the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> Mr Vieira de Mello thought there was a danger </p>
<p>that they would say it was too little, too late: </p>
<p>“But with a clear road map and timeframe, showing them that their humiliation was </p>
<p>finite; and if the PC [Political Council] and interim ministers were given real, tangible </p>
<p>responsibilities … he thought they could be persuaded to be realistic. And if the </p>
<p>PC was genuinely representative from across Iraq, he believed that the Secretary-</p>
<p>General and he would be able to recommend the Security Council accept it as the </p>
<p>Interim Authority set out in SCR 1483.”</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Baroness Amos subsequently asked Ambassador Bremer if there was a timeframe </p>
<p>for the political process. He indicated that the Political Council should be set up by </p>
<p>mid-July, and the Constitutional Council shortly after that. Once the Councils had been </p>
<p>established, Ambassador Bremer was reluctant to impose any deadlines, believing that </p>
<p>responsibility for doing so should lie with the Iraqi people themselves. </p>

<p><b>167. </b> Reporting to No.10 on security and troop levels in Iraq on 1 July, Mr Hoon’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary wrote:</p>
<p><b>“Security situation in Iraq varies from area to area: but we do not  </b></p>
<p><b>currently judge that Al Majar Al Kabir was the start of a trend, but rather  </b></p>
<p><b>a local incident</b>.<b>”</b></p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>168. </b> The Private Secretary reported that the security environment remained very difficult </p>
<p>in places, particularly in and around Baghdad and Fallujah. The MOD had considered </p>
<p>whether troop reinforcements would make a difference:</p>
<p>“… we continue to assess that we have the right size and shape of forces to do the </p>
<p>job. The British Commander, General Wall, is aware that reinforcements could be </p>
<p>generated if he judged that they were needed.” </p>
<p><b>169. </b> General Sir Peter Wall told the Inquiry that the incidents in Majar al-Kabir:</p>
<p>“… turned out to be consistent with the broad mood across Maysan as it developed </p>
<p>over time, and … the events in 2004 in al-Amara … were really linked to that sort of </p>
<p>same resentment against our presence.”</p>

<p><b>170. </b> On 1 July, in a letter to Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who would be succeeding  </p>
<p>Mr Sawers as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative for Iraq, Mr Peter Ricketts, </p>
<p>FCO Political Director, wrote that he hoped the close consultation between Mr Sawers </p>
<p>and Ambassador Bremer could “be expanded to allow even greater access to the </p>
<p>US machine in Baghdad”.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Ricketts continued that “we need to keep working on establishing mechanisms </p>
<p>for more systematic US/UK consultation” and suggested that was a key priority for  </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy’s first few weeks.</p>
<p><b>172. </b> The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) reviewed the situation in Iraq on 2 July and </p>
<p>concluded that:</p>
<p>“Numerous groups and individuals, including extremists, are competing for </p>
<p>influence in post-war Iraq. A number of them have already demonstrated that they </p>
<p>are prepared to use violence to achieve their ends, and all have easy access </p>
<p>to weapons.</p>
<p>“For most Iraqis, the immediate concerns are security and living conditions. Most </p>
<p>are, for now, acquiescent in the Coalition presence. But events in Iraq will depend </p>
<p>heavily on Coalition action.</p>
<p>“Extremist groups currently pose a direct threat to Coalition Forces, and to  </p>
<p>ordinary Iraqis who work with the Coalition. For now, the activities of these groups </p>
<p>are largely unco-ordinated. However, it is likely that the links between groups will </p>
<p>become stronger. </p>
<p>“In the medium to long term, disagreements over political, economic and security </p>
<p>issues also have the potential to escalate into conflict. Particular points of friction are </p>
<p>likely to include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>political representation, and the future direction of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>access to property, revenue and employment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the composition of the new national army and the future role of militias.”</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“ … what we were faced with increasingly through 2003 were a series of challenges </p>
<p>to the Coalition’s position that collectively represented an onslaught on us. There </p>
<p>were the remnants of the Ba’athist regime, the elements of the presidential </p>
<p>guard, the Fedayeen Saddam, all these specialist intelligence and security units </p>
<p>that Saddam set up, who had dissolved into the mainly Sunni areas and were </p>
<p>reconstituting and posing a terrorist threat to the Coalition. There was Al-Qaida </p>

<p><b>174. </b> Mr Straw visited Iraq and met Ambassador Bremer at CPA Headquarters in </p>
<p>Baghdad on 2 July.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>175. </b> Ambassador Bremer reported that he hoped to have a Governing Council of 20-30 </p>
<p>“fairly representative Iraqis” within two weeks. The mechanism by which they would be </p>
<p>appointed had not yet been finalised. The Council would be able to appoint ministers, </p>
<p>examine the budget and establish Commissions on elements of reform. </p>
<p><b>176. </b> Mr Straw urged Ambassador Bremer to articulate a calendar for the political </p>
<p>process because:</p>
<p>“This would help dissipate some dissatisfaction, even if the milestones were some </p>
<p>months away. It would change the dynamic of the debate and help get Iraqi buy-in </p>
<p>for the process.”</p>
<p><b>177. </b> In a private meeting with Mr Straw later the same day, Mr Vieira de Mello </p>
<p>welcomed Ambassador Bremer’s commitment to:</p>
<p>“… get the Governing Council off the ground soon. This would alleviate some </p>
<p>discontent … Giving some Iraqi leaders visible responsibility for developments </p>
<p>should also reduce criticism of the CPA’s efforts.”</p>

<p><b>178. </b> The day before a video conference with President Bush planned for 3 July, </p>
<p>Sir David Manning sent a note to Mr Blair offering advice on the conversation.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Sir David wrote:</p>
<p>“This is a key exchange.”</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Of the messages that were vital to get across, Sir David identified security as the </p>
<p>top priority and suggested (noting that the MOD would probably disagree) a surge of </p>
<p>large numbers of troops into Iraq to get through the “security crisis”. This should be </p>
<p>accompanied by an accelerated reconstruction programme and a “very vigorous political </p>
<p>programme” plus an effective media strategy. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Sir David also highlighted that US analysis of Iranian involvement in Iraq differed </p>
<p>from the JIC’s assessment and questioned the value of taking action. </p>

<p><b>182. </b> The weekly meeting of Cabinet took place before Mr Blair and President Bush </p>
<p>spoke on 3 July. In the course of the meeting Mr Straw, Baroness Amos and Mr Hoon all </p>
<p>emphasised that security was the main issue.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Hoon identified “greater organisation” in anti-Coalition forces and said that the </p>
<p>vicious circle of opposition to the Coalition, which prevented improvements to the life of </p>
<p>the average Iraqi citizen, must be broken. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Blair concluded that we should make CPA(South) into “a model”. Political </p>
<p>progress was essential to the stability of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 3 July.</p>

<p>(Commander of CJTF-7) dialled in from Iraq. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Blair began by congratulating Ambassador Bremer on the “remarkable </p>
<p>performance” of the CPA. He then set out areas of concern:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security. This was hampering CPA efforts at reconstruction; what more did the </p>
<p>CPA need?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction. The power and water infrastructure needed to be rebuilt </p>
<p>urgently; were there particular obstacles that needed to be removed? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Communications. It was essential to improve the CPA’s capacity to communicate </p>
<p>with the people of Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>WMD. The search needed to be redoubled and the atrocities of the Saddam </p>
<p>regime documented and publicised.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Politics. Was the political process on track? </p>
<p><b>188. </b> On security, Mr Blair asked Mr Sawers and Ambassador Bremer to draw up a </p>
<p>list of their requirements, telling them “whatever they needed, we would do our utmost </p>
<p>to provide” and reiterating that the UK would “do our level best to meet any demand </p>
<p>for additional resources”. Mr Blair added that if there were any obstacles that needed </p>
<p>clearing, Mr Sawers and Ambassador Bremer should tell him. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>former Ba’athists; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>international terrorists (Al Qaida and Ansar al-Islam); </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iranian agents, particularly in the South and West. </p>

<p><b>191. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting, written by Cabinet Office officials, </p>
<p>described the security situation and observed that it was “constraining the reconstruction </p>
<p>work of the CPA, the UN and other international actors”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> As a result of security </p>
<p>concerns, UK CPA secondees were “operating a night-time curfew”. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> The Annotated Agenda reported growing attacks on US forces, acts of economic </p>
<p>sabotage and intimidation of Iraqis working with the CPA, all of which were beginning </p>
<p>to have an effect on reconstruction. Tensions in the UK Area of Responsibility, however, </p>
<p>had not worsened. </p>
<p><b>193. </b> Cabinet Office officials described action being taken by the UK to improve  </p>
<p>security, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training US soldiers in “urban peace support operations”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increasing police numbers and “standing up local guard forces”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security Sector Reform, which was “a long term process”. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> Cabinet Office officials observed that “<b>real improvements will depend in part on </b></p>
<p><b>wider progress on political reform and reconstruction</b>”. </p>
<p><b>195. </b> In southern Iraq, the Annotated Agenda recorded that the UK was about to assume </p>
<p>command of Multi-National Division South-East (MND(SE)), expanding by two the </p>
<p>number of provinces over which it had command. Capacity in CPA(South) was being </p>
<p>bolstered, and staffing numbers had reached 60, although “operational funding has still </p>
<p>to arrive”.</p>
<p><b>196. </b> The Annotated Agenda explained that the Political Council had been renamed </p>
<p>the Governing Council (GC),</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> and was expected to convene “by the second half of </p>
<p>July”. Members would “nominate themselves to the CPA, on the basis of a consensus </p>
<p>emerging from the CPA-led political consultations”. It was expected that Mr Vieira de </p>

<p>the Constitution would be completed by May 2004 and that elections would then follow.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>199. </b> Mr Hoon reported to the meeting on the video conference that had taken place </p>
<p>earlier in the day, observing that the US was becoming concerned that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had not yet been captured. </p>
<p><b>200. </b> Gen Walker, who had also taken part in the video conference, observed that “the </p>
<p>US appeared to have no clear plan for security in the centre”. </p>
<p><b>201. </b> In discussion, the (unattributed) point was made that “there was no need, at </p>
<p>present, to increase UK forces”. The Chair of the meeting, Mr Hoon, summed up the </p>
<p>discussion stating “real improvements [in security] would depend in part on progress on </p>
<p>political reform and reconstruction”. </p>
<p><b>202. </b> A telegram from Mr Sawers on 3 July containing points to follow up after the video </p>
<p>conference with President Bush said:</p>
<p>“It didn’t come up today, but our forces in the South are thinly stretched. I discussed </p>
<p>this with the Foreign Secretary yesterday. 3 Div will be responsible for the four </p>
<p>Southern provinces, as opposed to the two covered by 1 Div. We will have less than </p>
<p>10,000 troops to cover Basra and Maysan and provide a reserve for any problems in </p>
<p>the other two provinces …</p>
<p>“It is not for me to recommend how many forces we need for our mission. But I </p>
<p>expect the task facing our forces to get more difficult over the summer … Seen from </p>
<p>here, we would be better off putting extra capability in place now than rather than </p>

<p><b>208. </b> In response to a question from Mr Edward Leigh, the Committee Chairman, about </p>
<p>his exit strategy for Iraq, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We stay until we get the job done. The job is to get the country back on its feet, to </p>
<p>give it a proper functioning political system which means that the Iraqis themselves </p>
<p>in a representative way control their country and to make sure that it has the ability </p>
<p>to be a stable and prosperous partner in the region.”</p>

<p><b>209. </b> Mr Blair also told the Committee that:</p>
<p>“The British troop requirement … is already just under a third of what it was at the </p>
<p>height of the conflict, so we are not at the same troop strength as we were even two </p>
<p>months ago.”</p>

<p><b>212. </b> On 9 July, Mr Rycroft wrote to Sir David Manning to recount a phone call from </p>
<p>Mr Sawers in Baghdad.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> He reported that Mr Sawers considered that troops in Basra </p>
<p>were “badly stretched”. The answer to several of his questions (for example, about </p>
<p>guarding specific sites) had been “we don’t have enough troops to do that”. </p>
<p><b>213. </b> Mr Sawers described his main security concern as the border with Iran in Maysan </p>
<p>Province, which might be seen as a soft target for attacks, and proposed that the UK </p>
<p>should “go back to having a full brigade, and crucially the HQ that goes with it, rather </p>
<p>than the battalion it now has”. </p>
<p><b>214. </b> Mr Rycroft had explained the MOD view that “more troops weren’t the answer </p>
<p>and that what was needed was progress on the political track”. Mr Sawers agreed this </p>
<p>would help but “just as there could be no purely military answer to the security issue, </p>
<p>so political progress would need to be underpinned by the military”. </p>
<p><b>215. </b> Sir David Manning sent Mr Rycroft’s minute to Mr Blair, annotating it:</p>

<p> Iraqi political leaders he met had clearly welcomed the end </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein’s regime, but not the US military presence. Even opponents of </p>
<p>the old regime felt that this was a humiliation for the Iraqis who had failed to remove </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein themselves. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> Ms Patricia Hewitt, the Trade and Industry Secretary, reported that she had also </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>220. </b> Later that afternoon, Mr Straw told Cabinet that the GC would be a broadly </p>
<p>inclusive body, incorporating “Iranian influenced Shia and communist elements”.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would “progressively” take over authority for areas of government, subject to the </p>
<p>CPA’s approval. </p>
<p><b>221. </b> On 11 July, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft with a draft message </p>
<p>for Mr Blair to send to the Governing Council when it met for the first time two days </p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> The Private Secretary’s letter recorded that:</p>
<p>“The last two weeks have seen intensive consultations with political leaders, </p>
<p>religious figures, tribal leaders and civil society representatives … Sérgio Vieira de </p>
<p>Mello has been closely involved. He has expressed firm support for our approach … </p>
<p>Our approach is in accordance with UNSCR 1483.” </p>
<p><b>222. </b> The letter went on to say:</p>
<p>“GC will be the Iraqi interface with the CPA and international community. It will </p>
<p>nominate interim ministers and oversee day to day running of ministries. CPA will </p>
<p>consult GC on all areas of policy. Only in exceptions would CPA act without GC </p>
<p>support. GC will formulate new national reconstruction and security policies … and </p>
<p>submit these recommendations to the CPA … Operational security matters will </p>
<p>remain the responsibility of the CPA.”</p>
<p><b>New military structures </b></p>
<p>Multi-National Division (South-East) (MND(SE)) was formally established on 12 July.</p>

<p>A number of those who served as GOC MND(SE) gave the Inquiry their views about the </p>
<p>length of their tour in Iraq. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Riley told the Inquiry that he was “firmly of the view” that GOCs needed “an </p>
<p>extended period of duty” if they were “in any way to understand local societies” and gain </p>
<p>the trust and confidence of those with whom they were working.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> He said he believed that </p>
<p>the six month rotation period was changing and said that his last tour in Afghanistan had </p>
<p>been for 14 months.</p>
<p>The Inquiry asked Lt Gen Rollo and Lt Gen Cooper how much they were able to build on </p>
<p>their predecessors’ success during a six month GOC MND(SE) posting.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lt Gen Rollo said that he felt that six month postings were “too short” and that longer tours </p>
<p>would have been “entirely sensible” given that MND(SE) was a “vastly complicated place, </p>
<p>for commanders in particular”. He added that GOCs did, however, approach the role with </p>
<p>“a common doctrine”, common background of experience and a desire “to achieve the </p>
<p>same things”.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Cooper told the Inquiry that he felt that postings should last for at least 12 months. </p>
<p>He said that he agreed with Lt Gen Rollo’s assessment that GOCs would look at key </p>
<p>issues but observed:</p>
<p>“ … clearly I looked at it slightly differently to my predecessor, and my successor </p>
<p>looked at it slightly differently to me, his successor looked at it slightly differently </p>
<p>to him”. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry that there was “no doubt” that six months was not long </p>
<p>enough for a GOC to be in post, but that years in post were needed to develop the level </p>
<p>of understanding necessary for the role.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> He said that the duration should certainly be </p>
<p>increased to a year.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that in his opinion divisional commanders “must do more </p>
<p>than six months” and so senior commanders should do “much longer” because:</p>
<p>“ … just as you are getting up to speed, just as you are establishing trust, confidence, </p>
<p>with all your interlocutors, it is time to pull out, and, of course, your interlocutors have </p>
<p>to start all over again …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>Lt Gen Shirreff observed, however, that for soldiers on the ground, six months was  </p>
<p>“about right”. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that he thought it was an “illusion” that the six-month tour </p>
<p>lengths created a lack of continuity:</p>
<p>“I think the problem … is more a methodological one. It’s more that there is no laid-</p>
<p>down methodology. There’s nobody that owns the campaign and takes the incoming </p>
<p>commander and says, this is what we’re going to do, drive on.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw said that, during his time in Northern Ireland, there had been a clear long </p>
<p>term vision so that commanders knew their place in the bigger picture but this was lacking </p>
<p>from his experience in Iraq. As an example, he said that what he and Lt Gen Shirreff did </p>
<p>during their respective postings as GOC MND(SE) “were diametrically opposite things” but </p>
<p>that both were supported by the system because they were “allowed to do what we judged </p>
<p>was the right thing to do”.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Binns told the Inquiry that he thought there was a need to improve “campaign </p>
<p>continuity” and that one solution was for senior commanders to serve longer, where </p>
<p>appropriate, but:</p>
<p>“… we have to be careful that this doesn’t become the default setting, because </p>
<p>one can get very tired, if you are being rocketed every day, if you have got the </p>
<p>responsibility of command during a very difficult period, then simply extending </p>
<p>people’s period there isn’t necessarily the answer.”</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>Throughout the course of Op TELIC, 11 individuals held the post of Senior British Military </p>
<p>Representative-Iraq, changing roughly every six months until September 2006:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>May to September 2003: Major General Freddie Viggers (also appointed as </p>
<p>Deputy Commander of CJTF-7)</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>Some of those who served as SBMR-I offered the Inquiry similar views to those who </p>
<p>served as GOC MND(SE). </p>
<p>Lt Gen Brims told the Inquiry: “I would happily have stayed there for a year, and I think I </p>
<p>could have done a good job.”</p>

<p>243</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely went further, and said that six months was “manifestly </p>
<p>not long enough”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> One risk of a six month tour was that Iraqi interlocutors might judge </p>
<p>that the postholder was “passing trade”, and would not establish as a close a relationship </p>
<p>with them as they would with an individual who would be in post for a year or more. He </p>
<p>made similar points in 2005 in his end of tour report, which can be found in Section 9.3.</p>
<p>Lt Gen Lamb told the Inquiry that he agreed to extend the length of his tour because </p>
<p>“it was exactly the right place to be”.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Inquiry asked Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy to what extent the conduct of  </p>
<p>the campaign was determined by individual GOCs rather than by the CJO.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>ACM Torpy replied:</p>
<p>“In terms of the overall campaign objectives set by CDS and then down through </p>
<p>myself to the GOC … that provided a degree of continuity but there is no doubt we </p>
<p>had a debate over how long tour length should be … There were army reasons for </p>
<p>keeping it at six months. That’s what we stuck with. In hindsight and what we have </p>
<p>now shifted to is much longer between nine months, a year, maybe even longer for </p>
<p>certain key people.”</p>
<p>ACM Torpy said that he thought that commanders would have benefited from longer </p>
<p>tours in Iraq because “it gives you an opportunity to build relationships, understand the </p>
<p>environment” and that this was “an acknowledged lesson out of the campaign”.</p>
<p>General Sir Mike Jackson told the Inquiry that “six months seems to be self-evidently too </p>
<p>short” given the importance of relationship-building.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> He indicated that tour lengths for </p>
<p>senior officers in Baghdad had begun to extend to nine or 12 months during his time as </p>
<p>Chief of the General Staff (CGS). </p>
<p>General Sir Richard Dannatt, who succeeded Gen Jackson as CGS, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>he was “pretty convinced” that six months “in the front line” was as much as a soldier </p>
<p>should be asked to do.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> For some senior commanders and staff officers, and those </p>
<p>engaging with local leaders and in training local forces, the circumstances were different. </p>
<p>Consequently, “we have significantly changed the number of posts that go for nine </p>
<p>months, 12 months and some even longer”. </p>
<p>General the Lord Walker told the Inquiry that he considered “a minimum tour length for </p>
<p>operation, intelligence-type commanders should be a year long” but that six months was “ </p>
<p>a good time for people on the ground”.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal the Lord Stirrup told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… there is a very clear view that a brigade needs to train, fight and recover together. </p>
<p>So that presents you with a difficulty, since you would actually like your command </p>
<p>team … to stay there longer.</p>
<p>“The way we sought to balance this circle is to have more and more continuity posts </p>
<p>that are in theatre for a year, and they run over from one brigade to another … </p>
<p>particularly in the areas of intelligence and cultural understanding.”</p>

<p><b>223. </b> On 13 July, the Governing Council met for the first time. </p>
<p><b>224. </b> Ambassador Bremer described its inauguration in his account of his year in Iraq:</p>
<p>“The choreography we had agreed upon with the UK, UN and GC members called </p>
<p>for the twenty-five Council members to gather in a building not far from the palace … </p>
<p>The plan was for the group then to constitute themselves as the Governing Council. </p>
<p>(This became known to us irreverently as the ‘immaculate conception’ option).”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Chairmanship of the Council would rotate on a monthly basis.<b> </b>According to the </p>
<p>RAND report, Ambassador Bremer observed that a body that could not agree on its own </p>
<p>Chairman could hardly be ready to rule.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>226. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed Iraq in their regular meeting on 16 July.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> In </p>
<p>discussion the point was made that:</p>
<p>“The level of Iraqi consent to Coalition Occupation had deteriorated and COS </p>
<p>assessed that it might be lost by the end of 04 were the current trend to continue. </p>
<p>Retention of Iraqi consent depended on an effective, culturally attuned information </p>
<p>strategy to inform local people about the progress being made on governance and </p>
<p>reconstruction. The CPA had a mature, albeit unpublished, long term strategy, but </p>
<p>there was a need to develop measures to retain consent of the middle ground and </p>
<p>avoid extremism in the short and medium term.”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Cabinet Office officials provided an Annotated Agenda for the meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR on 17 July.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Attached to the Agenda was a copy of a document entitled ‘Authorities of the </p>
<p>Governing Council’, which had been agreed between the CPA and GC as a description </p>
<p>of the initial powers of the Council. It began:</p>
<p>“The Governing Council is the principal body of the interim administration of Iraq </p>
<p>called for in Security Council Resolution 1483.”</p>
<p><b>229. </b> The document set out that the CPA would be “required to consult” the GC on </p>
<p>“all major decisions and questions of policy”. The GC had “the right to set policies and </p>

<p>there were 14 leaders of political parties, three women (a result of the Kurdish </p>
<p>parties failing to put forward strong female candidates), and two from Basra; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>membership of the GC was agreed by consensus; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it declared itself to be a representative group of the Iraqi people and the </p>
<p>Governing Council of the interim administration called for under resolution 1483.</p>
<p><b>231. </b> In relation to Security Sector Reform (addressed in detail in Section 12.1) the </p>
<p>Annotated Agenda said that:</p>
<p>“CPA plans are to develop policies in conjunction with emerging Iraqi authorities, </p>
<p>to ensure that the major decisions on the size, shape and structure have full </p>
<p>Iraqi involvement.”</p>
<p><b>232. </b> Cabinet Office officials also explained that the newly-formed Basra Province </p>
<p>Interim Council was not connected to the GC. A link would need to be established so </p>
<p>that funding could move south from Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>233. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that the CPA denied itself the authority to appoint </p>
<p>any ministers who were not nominated by the GC.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> In the ‘Authorities’ document, the </p>
<p>GC alone was given power to appoint, oversee and dismiss interim ministers, as well as </p>
<p>appointing international representatives of Iraq, such as Ambassadors. Although the GC </p>
<p>would appoint the Finance Minister, the budget for 2004 would be drawn up “with the </p>
<p>CPA, and with the involvement of representatives of the IMF, World Bank and UNDP”. </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Sir John also told the Inquiry that the GC itself agreed that it represented the ethnic </p>
<p>composition of the country, and had the correct ethnic balance between Arabs and </p>
<p>Kurds, representatives of all the major cities and provinces of the country; and a balance </p>
<p>between Islamists and non-Islamists.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> According to Sir John, the majority of members </p>
<p>had lived in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The Cabinet Office Annotated Agenda for 17 July also informed members of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR that: </p>
<p>“The CPA Strategic Plan has been finalised and circulated internally within the </p>
<p>CPA. At present there are no plans to publish it. Although not perfect, it meets our </p>
<p>basic requirements. Next steps: CPA staff will use the Strategic Plan to inform </p>
<p>further work in planning and prioritisation of the CPA’s work. A revised, detailed </p>
<p>implementation plan is due by 22 July. UK secondees in CPA will continue to try to </p>
<p>shape this to ensure that it is coherent and commits the CPA to an ambitious but </p>
<p>realistic timetable.”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>236. </b> Cabinet Office officials described the CPA’s decision to create 18 CPA teams to </p>

<p>246</p>
<p><b>237. </b> The US would run 14 of them, and the UK four. No decision had been taken as to </p>
<p>whether these four should all be within the South-East to match the UK area of military </p>
<p>responsibility. Mr Andy Bearpark had advised against such a move, because of concern </p>
<p>that the US might then expect the UK to fund the entire effort in the South-East, meaning </p>
<p>that the South-East might not receive its proper share of CPA funds. </p>
<p><b>238. </b> At the meeting of the AHMGIR on 17 July, FCO officials reported that:</p>
<p>“International reactions [to the GC] had been mixed, with some countries … notably </p>
<p>cautious. Bremer was beginning to think a further transitional step was necessary </p>
<p>between the Governing Council and a fully representative government to provide </p>
<p>cover for other countries to support reconstruction.”</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>239. </b> In discussion, a member of the AHMGIR made the point that a better </p>
<p>communications strategy was needed to explain the role of the GC to the Iraqi people. </p>
<p><b>240. </b> On 17 July, Mr Blair visited Washington to deliver a speech to a joint session of the </p>

<p>Congressional leadership and, separately, President Bush.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Blair told Congress that:</p>
<p>“… when we invade Afghanistan or Iraq, our responsibility does not end with military </p>
<p>victory. </p>
<p>“Finishing the fighting is not finishing the job.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We promised Iraq democratic government. We will deliver it. </p>
<p>“We promised them the chance to use their oil wealth to build prosperity for all their </p>
<p>citizens, not a corrupt elite, and we will do so. We will stay with these people so in </p>
<p>need of our help until the job is done.”</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Rycroft suggested to Mr Blair that, in relation to Iraq, the aim of his meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush should be:</p>

<p> </p>
<p>By 18 July, senior officials in the Pentagon had approved it. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> The ‘Vision’ defined the CPA’s ultimate goal as working to achieve:</p>
<p>“… a unified and stable, democratic Iraq that: provides effective and representative </p>
<p>government for the Iraqi people; is underpinned by new and protected freedoms for </p>
<p>all Iraqis and a growing market economy; is able to defend itself but no longer poses </p>
<p>a threat to its neighbours or international security.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>246. </b> The highest priority was to create a secure and safe environment through recruiting </p>
<p>and training Iraqi police and armed forces. <i>Hard Lessons </i>describes its other goals as </p>
<p>promoting a rapid transition to a market economy, establishing an effective rule of law </p>
<p>system, and establishing programmes to develop democracy.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>247. </b> A plan for the implementation of the Vision,<i> ‘</i>Achieving the Vision to Restore Full </p>
<p>Sovereignty to the Iraqi People’,</p>

<p><b>248. </b> The introduction to ‘Achieving the Vision’ by Ambassador Bremer said:</p>
<p>“This progressive plan is an overview of the strategy necessary for early  </p>

<p>128</p>
<p> He had called </p>
<p>for a clear timeline for the transition to a representative government, and for an Iraqi-led </p>

<p><b>254. </b> Views within the GC were divided on timelines for the constitutional reform process </p>

<p>an initial force level review that identified the possible requirement for additional </p>
<p>manpower. GOC MND(SE) has taken this work forward and produced a detailed </p>
<p>force level review of UK tasks across MND(SE).”</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Lt Gen Reith described a shift in the role of the military to one of support, in all lines </p>
<p>of operation other than security, which remained primarily a military responsibility. In the </p>
<p>UK’s area, he judged that there was no direct threat requiring a war-fighting capability, </p>
<p>but armoured forces continued to be useful for “protection, over-match, presence and </p>
<p>domination”. Other threats included paramilitary attacks, terrorism (including Improvised </p>
<p>Explosive Devices) and a breakdown of public order. </p>
<p><b>259. </b> Further calls on military resources were being generated by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reconstruction effort (in particular the need to protect key sites and facilities);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SSR activities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to provide security for the Embassy compound in Baghdad and a </p>
<p>potential Consulate in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>plans to open border crossings;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for river patrols to combat smuggling; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to fill personnel gaps in the CPA structure.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> In addition, in the event of “localised resurgences in violence” Lt Gen Reith </p>
<p>anticipated that the UK might come under pressure to conduct cross-boundary operations. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> Lt Gen Reith wrote:</p>
<p>“The overall impact of these additional commitments is almost two companies of </p>
<p>manpower. This can just be met from within current resources, but has the penalty of </p>
<p>leaving absolutely no slack at all and no uncommitted reserve. The level of tasks is </p>
<p>also beginning to bite hard, now that R&amp;R [Rest and Recuperation] has started, and </p>
<p>is assessed as being unsustainable.”</p>
<p><b>262. </b> As a result, Lt Gen Reith recommended deployment of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an additional four-platoon</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> infantry company as soon as possible;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identification of a reserve capability that would allow for rapid reinforcement, the </p>
<p>first part of which should be a four-platoon company already in Cyprus; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>some additional specialist capabilities, including Arabic speakers. </p>
<p>131 </p>
<p>A platoon comprises between 26 and 55 people. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Lt Gen Reith’s recommendations were discussed by the Chiefs of Staff on 30 July. </p>
<p>The minutes of that meeting record that:</p>
<p>“CJO [Chief of Joint Operations] had discussed the Review with GOC MND(SE) </p>
<p>who was content that the adjustment to force levels would be adequate. CDS </p>
<p>[Chief of the Defence Staff] invited CJO to investigate the merit in deploying the </p>
<p>SLE [Spearhead Land Element] to Cyprus to acclimatise in order that they might be </p>
<p>better prepared were they called upon for deployment to Iraq. COS [Chiefs of Staff] </p>
<p>agreed to CJO’s recommendations, and CDS directed DG Op Pol [Director General </p>
<p>Operational Policy] to submit to Ministers.”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>264. </b> On 30 July, Sir Hilary Synnott took up post as the Head of CPA(South). His </p>
<p>appointment is described in Section 10.1.</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr David Richmond succeeded Mr Sawers as the Prime Minister’s Special </p>
<p>Representative for Iraq on an interim basis at the end of July 2003, and remained in </p>

<p>Sir Jeremy’s Deputy until Sir Jeremy left at the end of March 2004.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Asked about his key responsibilities, Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The first was really a thirst for information about what was going on. They wanted </p>
<p>me to establish a good working relationship with Bremer and to find out as much as </p>
<p>I could about what was going on and ensure that London were kept fully informed … </p>
<p>“[the second] to ensure they [British secondees] fitted into the organisation, that they </p>
<p>[were] able to operate effectively and look after their safekeeping and well being, </p>
<p>which became an increasing burden as time went on.</p>
<p>“… [the third] to try to ensure an orderly transition to a … sovereign representative </p>
<p>Iraqi government and associated with that was obviously trying to hand over to them </p>
<p>in the best possible condition, which meant the whole range of issues that the CPA </p>
<p>dealt with …”</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Sir David considered that:</p>
<p>“… the area where we [Greenstock, Sawers and Richmond] could make the </p>
<p>greatest contribution as representatives was to the political process. This is because </p>
<p>as diplomats that’s the sort of thing we know or are expected to know </p>

<p><b>269. </b> During the conversation on Iraq, Mr Blair described the GC as a “complete </p>
<p>antidote” to the view that Iraqis were not “delighted” that Saddam Hussein had gone. </p>
<p><b>270. </b> The conversation turned to the media, and Mr Blair commented that better Iraqi </p>

<p><b>Iranian activity and influence in Iraq</b></p>
<p>Throughout April and May, concerns were beginning to emerge within the US </p>
<p>Administration about possible Iranian activity in Iraq.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The RAND report on the Occupation of Iraq records that the US authorities tracked the </p>
<p>activity of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) within Iraq and occasionally </p>
<p>picked some individuals up for questioning.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> There was suspicion, within the Coalition, </p>
<p>that the Iranians were actively supporting and arming the Shia Badr Corps. On one </p>
<p>occasion, UK and Danish patrols identified seven armed Iranian “border posts” located </p>
<p>within Basra and Maysan Provinces, displaying the Iranian flag within Iraqi territory. </p>
<p>On 11 June 2003, the JIC issued an Assessment of Iran’s goals for Iraq, its activity in </p>
<p>support of them and the level of its influence in Iraq.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“Iran wants Iraq to be a stable, non-threatening neighbour with no long-term foreign, </p>
<p>especially US, presence. It wants influence in a future Iraqi administration. It favours </p>
<p>a unified State, but probably does not have a blueprint for how the administration </p>
<p>should be structured. It does not expect the Iranian theocratic system to be a </p>
<p>model for Iraq. But it believes that the Iraqi Shia population must have political </p>
<p>representation broadly commensurate with its numbers in a democratic government </p>
<p>… Iran also wants resumed trade, a role in reconstruction, the repatriation of some </p>
<p>200,000 Iraqi refugees and Iraq’s formal recognition of the border. It still hopes, </p>
<p>if possible, for reparations for the 1980-88 Iran/Iraq war and closure on missing </p>
<p>prisoners-of-war …</p>
<p>“Iran would have preferred a greater UN role in post-conflict Iraq and the early </p>
<p>withdrawal of US forces … The presence of large US forces adds to Iran’s sense </p>
<p>of encirclement … And a longer-term worry is that the resurgence of Najaf as a </p>
<p>centre of Shia teaching, and the emergence of Iraq as a successful Shia state, could </p>
<p>undermine the legitimacy of Iran’s theocratic system …</p>
<p>“We judge that the Iranians instinctively see progress by the Coalition as detrimental </p>
<p>to Iran, but pragmatically realise that chaos would ensue without the Coalition </p>
<p>presence … On the basis of Iranian activity so far, we judge this remains the broad </p>
<p>thrust of Iran’s policy as implemented on the ground: to avoid direct conflict with the </p>
<p>Coalition, to develop its influence, and to take advantage of the political process </p>
<p>where possible. But it will retain the option of causing trouble for the Coalition if it is </p>
<p>not satisfied by the outcome of events. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>“Iran continues to be … associated with the SCIRI leadership, but is also in touch </p>
<p>with other Iraqi political groups and influential individuals.”</p>
<p>In early July, Mr Sawers briefed Mr Rycroft that his main security concern was the UK’s </p>
<p>ability to patrol the border with Iran in Maysan Province:</p>
<p>“If we remain stretched there, we could end up being seen as the soft underbelly, and </p>
<p>therefore at risk of even more attacks.”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>Since the US had no diplomatic relations with Iran, Mr Sawers was sent to Tehran at the </p>
<p>end of July to deliver “strong messages … on [the] need to stop playing a malign role in </p>
<p>internal Iraqi security”.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His interlocutors denied that any such activity was taking place, but were “keen to stress </p>
<p>that Iran shared the same goals as the Coalition”.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 10 September, the JIC again considered Iranian activity and influence in Iraq.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It judged:</p>
<p>“Iran wants to exercise significant influence over the post-Saddam government. Much </p>
<p>Iranian activity in Iraq is aimed at ensuring that Shia groups, particularly its main ally, </p>
<p>the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) make progress in the </p>
<p>political process …</p>
<p>“Iran sees itself as competing with the Coalition for influence in Iraq. Tehran probably </p>
<p>draws a distinction between stirring up trouble and authorising terrorist attacks on </p>
<p>Coalition targets …</p>
<p>“Recent events, including the arrest in the UK of the former ambassador to Argentina, </p>
<p>Hadi Soleymanpur, have caused Iranian attitudes to harden. They could provoke </p>
<p>violent protests against the UK.”</p>
<p>The JIC judged that the assassination on 29 August of SCIRI’s spiritual leader, </p>
<p>Muhammed Baqir al-Hakim, represented a “serious blow to Iranian aspirations” in Iraq </p>
<p>although it was difficult to assess the wider impact of his death on intra-Shia relations </p>
<p>“which were already tense”. </p>
<p>The JIC observed:</p>
<p>“The loss of a more moderate Shia leader poses the risk that a more radical Shia </p>
<p>leader, such as cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, will fill the vacuum.”</p>

<p>distribution network … The violence subsided to a normal level as quickly as it had </p>
<p>blown up.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Cabinet Office officials reported on 14 August that “Daytime Improvised Explosive </p>
<p>Devices (IEDs), followed up with sniper or rocket propelled grenade attacks, are </p>
<p>becoming increasingly common”.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Officials from the FCO reported “cautious progress” on the political process. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer and Mr Richmond were “encouraging the Governing Council to </p>
<p>make decisions”. A list of ministerial names was being drawn up but it was not clear how </p>
<p>the Constitutional Preparatory Committee would be chosen. Foreign Ministers from the </p>
<p>Arab League had announced that they would not recognise the Governing Council, but </p>
<p>would work with it. </p>
<p><b>283. </b> On 14 August, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1500 (2003). There </p>
<p>were 14 votes in favour. Syria abstained.</p>
<p><b>284. </b> This short resolution welcomed the formation of the GC as “an important step </p>
<p>towards” the creation of an internationally-recognised representative government in Iraq.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>285. </b> Operative paragraph 2 of the resolution created the United Nations Assistance </p>
<p>Mission for Iraq, to support the Secretary-General in fulfilling the responsibilities he had </p>
<p>been given in resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> The Cabinet Office assessed that:</p>
<p>“The passage of UNSCR 1500 and UK lobbying have contributed to a more positive </p>
<p><b>regional attitude</b> to the Governing Council.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>287. </b> On 14 August, Cabinet Office officials reported to members of the AHMGIR that the </p>

<p><b>288. </b> That committee had begun work by 21 August.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>289. </b> On 18 August, Lt Gen Robert Fry, who had become Deputy Chief of Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments) in July, briefed the Chiefs of Staff that there had been:</p>
<p>“… a decline in Iraqi consent to the Coalition in MND(SE) due to the failure by the </p>
<p>Coalition to deliver improvements in essential services …</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that across the MND(SE) the honeymoon period that followed </p>
<p>the conflict is now over. The Shia leaders are suggesting that the Coalition now has </p>
<p>a short period of grace before a significant deterioration in local consent. Without </p>
<p>progress in infrastructure, MND(SE) is finding that work in security sector reform, </p>
<p>political development, welfare provision and so forth is stalled.”</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>290. </b> An update for the AHMGIR, produced on 20 August, said that: </p>
<p>“Basra is now calmer, following last week’s disturbances … However … the </p>
<p>willingness of local leaders to issue, and the public to respond to, appeals for calm </p>
<p>may be short-lived if the Coalition cannot maintain at least the current level of </p>
<p>service delivery. Security across MND(SE) remains volatile … Security concerns </p>
<p>have led Japanese staff in CPA(South) to be withdrawn.”</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>291. </b> In a meeting on the same day, the Chiefs of Staff were told that: </p>
<p>“There had been no deterioration of the situation in the UK AO, possibly as a result </p>
<p>of the order for restraint from Ayatollah Sistani and possibly as a rejection of the </p>
<p>call for action by the Shia against the Coalition from Saddam Hussein. Most of the </p>
<p>MND(SE) contacts over the reporting period were related to criminal activity.”</p>
<p>158</p>
<p><b>292. </b> Two days after that update, there was an attack on a Royal Military Police patrol, </p>
<p>in which three were killed</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> and another seriously injured.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> Up to five Iraqis were also </p>
<p>understood to have been killed or seriously injured. </p>
<p><b>293. </b> UK forces in theatre responded by restricting their movements to essential </p>
<p>journeys only.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>294. </b> The following week, another British soldier was killed</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s office that the MOD did not see a </p>
<p>link to previous incidents and there was “no reason … to suppose that they represent a </p>
<p>trend”. He added:</p>
<p>“It is worth noting that the number of UK Servicemen killed by enemy action since </p>
<p>the beginning of May is now greater than the number killed during major combat </p>
<p>operations in March and April.”</p>
<p><b>The UN bombing</b></p>
<p>On 19 August, a bomb exploded outside UN headquarters at the Canal Hotel, Baghdad. It </p>
<p>killed 22 UN staff and visitors, including Mr Vieira de Mello.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p>No.10 officials told Mr Blair that “It was a large explosion – about a ton of explosives, </p>
<p>probably in a truck”.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lieutenant General Andrew Ridgway, Chief of Defence Intelligence, told the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 20 August that:</p>
<p>“Further attacks were expected. The bombing would affect coalition building, NGO </p>
<p>confidence, and the reconstruction of utilities, which if not expedited could lead to a </p>
<p>significant loss of consent.”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There was a second bomb attack on the UN on 22 September.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One member of DFID staff was slightly injured in the first attack.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FCO and DFID immediately reviewed security for staff in Iraq; security advisers </p>
<p>said that they were “generally content” with security arrangements for UK staff in CPA </p>
<p>Baghdad, but made a number of recommendations for improvement. </p>
<p>At the time, it was unclear who was responsible for the attack, but it was considered that </p>
<p>the method and target suggested Islamist extremists rather than Ba’ath Party loyalists.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that the attacks were subsequently attributed to </p>
<p>Al Qaida.</p>

<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>257</p>
<p>The JIC assessed in early September that:</p>
<p>“In most cases, we do not know who carried out specific attacks. The intelligence </p>
<p>picture is incomplete. But intelligence indicates several categories of groups are </p>
<p>responsible:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>supporters and officials of the former Iraqi regime;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>‘Mujahedin’ (mainly foreign fighters, but also Iraqi Sunni extremists);</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Sunni Islamic terrorist organisations, mainly Ansar al-Islam;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>unaffiliated Iraqis, motivated by personal, local or tribal grievances or by </p>
<p>payment from one of the groups listed above.”</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>The JIC also judged that:</p>
<p>“The security environment will remain poor, and will probably worsen over the next </p>
<p>year, unless the Coalition, in conjunction with Iraqis, can reverse current trends. </p>
<p>There are likely to be more spectacular attacks.”</p>
<p>Tension in central Iraq increased after the bombing.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By 29 August, the World Bank and IMF missions had been withdrawn, a number of </p>
<p>NGOs were withdrawing their international staff, and the UN had withdrawn some staff </p>
<p>temporarily while reviewing its options.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lieutenant General Freddie Viggers told the Inquiry that the attack on the UN was:</p>
<p>“… a huge blow … they knew precisely where to put that truck … Of course it shook </p>
<p>up the workers of the UN right across the country, and the threats kept coming, and it </p>
<p>was of no surprise that within a few days they said ‘We can’t sustain this’.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>On 29 August, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, suggested to </p>
<p>Mr Blair that a ‘next step’ for the UK should be to:</p>
<p>“… persuade the UN to adopt a realistic approach to security. Give more security </p>
<p>advice and equipment to UNAMI [United Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq] so that it </p>
<p>can continue with as many operations as possible in the greater threat environment. </p>
<p>Where the UN operates, other international bodies and NGOs will follow.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It is very difficult to overstate the chaos that [the UN bombing] caused for the CPA, </p>
<p>because all your interlocutors suddenly vanished and you didn’t even know where </p>
<p>they were.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the decision by the UN to withdraw from Iraq which they took around about the </p>
<p>middle of September after a security review, I think … was regrettable, and it meant </p>
<p>for several months they were not really playing any sort of role in Iraq. It also meant </p>
<p>when Lakhdar Brahimi [UN Special Adviser on Iraq] arrived, initially in the end of </p>
<p>January 2004 and then again in April 2004, he was really working on his own.”</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that Mr Vieira de Mello would have played a very </p>
<p>influential role in Iraq.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> Firstly because of his personal qualities, and secondly because:</p>
<p>“… he had a direct link to Ayatollah Sistani, which neither Bremer nor the UK </p>
<p>Special Representatives had. Indeed he had, so we are led to believe … suggested </p>
<p>to Ayatollah Sistani that elections could be held in Iraq really quite quickly. It was </p>
<p>this fact that caused a huge amount of complications in the autumn of 2003 as we </p>
<p>were trying to find a political process that would lead to the transition to a sovereign </p>
<p>government. Had he not been killed he, of course, would have been the link with </p>
<p>Sistani, and the problems we had with Sistani I think would have been far fewer. The </p>
<p>fact he had that – because at the time in August you have to be clear we had not </p>
<p>realised in the CPA that Sistani was going to be as influential as he was. We knew </p>
<p>that he had issued this fatwa and so on but we did not know the fatwa was going to </p>
<p>be an insurmountable obstacle. That became apparent as time progressed.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>296. </b> The first Coalition update to the Security Council under the terms of resolution </p>
<p>1483 was provided on 21 August.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>297. </b> The US and the UK had planned to go into some detail about achievements in </p>
<p>Iraq, but the UN bombing on 19 August meant Ambassador Negroponte, US Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN, and Sir Emyr Jones Parry, UK Permanent Representative to </p>
<p>the UN in New York, instead delivered a much shorter and more downbeat report.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>298. </b> The report highlighted both the need for the international community to increase its </p>
<p>contribution to building a secure future for Iraq and the vital role of the UN.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>299. </b> Reporting on the Security Council’s reaction, Sir Emyr recorded that “responses </p>
<p>were only preliminary. But all those that spoke expressed their willingness to work </p>
<p>together on a new resolution, and welcomed the open approach we were taking.”</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Duclos, French Permanent Representative to the UN, said that the “UN could </p>
<p>not be expected to share more of the burden without sharing more of the authority” and </p>
<p>Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN, remarked on the need </p>
<p>for clarity on the UN’s role before member states would contribute more. </p>

<p><b>301. </b> Sir Emyr suggested in his message to London that “we need to clarify our thinking </p>
<p>on what precisely we want to achieve on the various areas”. He recorded continued </p>
<p>interest from the Security Council in the political timetable, and proposed:</p>
<p>“Possible ways forward might be to invite the Secretary-General to consult or to </p>
<p>stimulate the Governing Council itself to work up a timetable which the Security </p>
<p>Council could take note of.”</p>
<p><b>302. </b> On 26 August, Mr Richmond reported from Baghdad that August had been “a </p>
<p>difficult month” and described attacks on the Jordanian Embassy and on the UN’s </p>
<p>headquarters as “major escalations”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> He advised that the UK needed to hold its nerve; </p>
<p>problems were being identified and fixed, but “we are in for a bumpy ride”. </p>
<p><b>303. </b> On 28 August, the British Embassy Baghdad reported the number of significant </p>
<p>security incidents reported by Coalition Forces in August as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>17 to 19 August: 71 incidents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>21 to 23 August: 94 incidents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>24 to 26 August: 72 incidents.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>304. </b> The August violence had not been confined to Baghdad. On 29 August a bomb </p>
<p>attack on the Imam Ali mosque in Najaf killed 80 people, including Ayatollah Mohammed </p>
<p>Baqir al-Hakim, the leader of the Shia political party the Supreme Council for an Islamic </p>
<p>Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI).</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Sectarian violence between Turkomen and Kurds broke out in Kirkuk, but was </p>

<p><b>306. </b> Mr Miller sent No.10 a brief on the GC’s membership, personalities and progress </p>
<p>on 28 August.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> Out of the 25 GC members he wrote that 13 were Shia, and there were </p>
<p>five Sunni, five Kurds, one Turkoman and one Christian. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> In the Annotated Agenda for the 28 August meeting of the AHMGIR, Cabinet Office </p>
<p>officials advised that, since its creation on 13 July, the GC had:</p>
<p>“… made only limited progress. Unable to agree on a single chairperson, the IGC </p>
<p>agreed a 9-man leadership council.”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Cabinet Office officials advised that internal wrangling was delaying the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Cabinet Office officials also set out UK objectives for a new Security Council </p>
<p>resolution. They were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to broaden the UN Special Representative’s role, especially on the </p>
<p>political process;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to ask the GC to set a timetable for elections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage international engagement with the GC;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to stimulate funding for reconstruction; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage contributions of troops and police, “without undermining the legal </p>
<p>basis of our current military presence (a significant caveat)”.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>310. </b> Mr Straw told the AHMGIR when it met on 28 August that:</p>
<p>“… the US and UK had seized the opportunity, provided by the international </p>
<p>solidarity following the UN bombing, to work on a new UN resolution. There was </p>
<p>UN consensus on the need for a strengthened UN mandate for military forces </p>
<p>in Iraq, and that they should operate under single command but not be a  </p>
<p>blue-hatted operation.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>311. </b> FCO officials told the meeting that secularists wanted a slow political timetable </p>
<p>in Iraq but Islamists a quicker one, believing they would benefit from early elections. </p>
<p>Mr Neil Crompton, who had succeeded Mr Chilcott as the Head of the Iraq Policy Unit, </p>
<p>described progress as “limited”.</p>
<p><b>312. </b> On 28 August Mr Crompton advised Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that:</p>
<p>“… there is a head of steam within the MOD about the lack of progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction. As the military see it, CPA in general, and CPA(South) in particular, </p>
<p>have failed to deliver. As a result, the Coalition is losing consent, the military are </p>
<p>having to take on tasks which should be undertaken by civilians, and in the process </p>
<p>the military are becoming over-stretched and vulnerable.”</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>313. </b> A letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary of the same date confirmed this </p>
<p>assessment. It reported the MOD’s view that: </p>
<p>“The nub of the problem is the failure to deliver an adequate (even to pre-war </p>
<p>standards) level of essential services … electricity, water and fuel.”</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>314. </b> On 29 August, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, successor to Sir David Manning as Mr Blair’s </p>

<p><b>317. </b> In relation to security, the Cabinet Office note recorded that:</p>
<p>“The security situation in central and southern Iraq had worsened since July. It is </p>
<p>likely to deterioriate into the autumn. Numbers of attacks in and around Baghdad </p>
<p>remain broadly the same, but the <b>sophistication </b>has increased.” </p>

<p><b>326. </b> The brief said that “the priority for the MOD is to underline to the Prime Minister </p>
<p>the need for delivery on essential services in the South-East in the very near future” but </p>
<p>stated that there was a need for “urgent measures that will relieve the military of tasks </p>
<p>unrelated to security” because:</p>
<p>“… the military’s role should be to set the conditions for others to secure and </p>
<p>regenerate Iraq’s basic utilities. While we can patch up utilities, we have neither the </p>
<p>numbers, capabilities nor the money to overhaul Iraq’s infrastructure.”</p>
<p><b>327. </b> In a handwritten comment, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary added that while there </p>
<p>might be a short-term need for: </p>
<p>“… a surge deployment of troops to protect the work – we should not agree to a </p>
<p>major ‘symbolic’ deployment of troops over and above this.”</p>

<p> A handwritten note from his Principal Staff Officer added that it appeared that </p>
<p>the FCO was moving away from the view that responsibility lay with a cross-Government </p>

<p>be less on infrastructure requirements as driven by FCO/DFID”. </p>
<p><b>329. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott sent a telegram entitled ‘Southern Iraq: What Needs to be </p>

<p>“The main immediate need is a vastly increased effort, well beyond the current </p>
<p>capabilities of CPA(S) or MND(SE), to provide visible improvements in the provision </p>
<p>of power, water and fuel in a short timescale.”</p>

<p>more resources, a new location very soon and protective cover.”</p>
<p><b>331. </b> In a separate telegram, Sir Hilary proposed “An Emergency Plan for Essential </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Sir Hilary observed that “formally” it was for CPA(Baghdad) to own and resource the </p>
<p>plan “but that is not quite how things work in practice … there is a certain expectation that </p>
<p>the regions should take a lead to sort out their own problems”. He suggested that a “high </p>
<p>level task force” should be established in Whitehall to provide the support he needed. </p>
<p><b>333. </b> The Essential Services Plan is covered in detail in Section 10.1.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Immediately after the meeting on 2 September Mr Cannon wrote to the FCO with a </p>
<p>request for eight pieces of advice, to be delivered two days later.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>335. </b> The advice was to cover police and internal security, infrastructure in the South, </p>
<p>CPA finances, oil and electricity, media, the political process, conditions of service for UK </p>
<p>civilian staff, and Iraqi assets overseas. </p>
<p><b>336. </b> Mr Cannon wrote that Mr Blair “wanted action on Iraq taken forward with a </p>
<p>heightened sense of urgency”. He had observed that “the key to the security situation in </p>
<p>Iraq is the rapid mobilisation of an effective Iraqi police force”. </p>
<p><b>337. </b> In response to Sir Hilary’s telegrams, Mr Blair wanted “the maximum possible </p>
<p>support given to Sir Hilary’s proposals for immediate infrastructure projects in the </p>
<p>CPA(South) area, with appropriate military cover”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>338. </b> Mr Cannon’s letter asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock to talk through the issues </p>
<p>discussed with Ambassador Bremer, so as to avoid “cutting across [his] position in </p>
<p>raising these issues with Bush”.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> On 3 September, the JIC produced an Assessment of threats to security in Iraq.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its first three Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I. The security environment will remain poor, and will probably worsen over the next </p>
<p>year, unless the Coalition, in conjunction with Iraqis, can reverse current trends. </p>
<p>There are likely to be more spectacular attacks.</p>
<p>II. The violent opposition comprises former regime officials, Sunni Iraqi extremists, </p>
<p>Sunni ‘Mujahedin’ and Sunni Islamic terrorist organisations, mainly Ansar al-Islam. </p>
<p>But we do not know who is responsible for specific attacks. </p>
<p>III. Sunni Islamic extremists/terrorists see Iraq as the new focus for Jihad. They are </p>
<p>likely to present the main long-term threat to Coalition interests in Iraq, as they can </p>
<p>draw on external recruits and finance.”</p>
<p><b>340. </b> The JIC recorded daily attacks on the Coalition, including a recent increase in the </p>
<p>South. The most significant attacks were vehicle bombs in Najaf and Baghdad and at the </p>
<p>Jordanian Embassy and UN HQ. There had been attacks using mortars, man-portable </p>
<p>surface-to-air missiles, small arms and – increasingly – small improvised explosive </p>
<p>devices. Those conducting attacks had shown “growing competence, determination  </p>
<p>and sophistication”. </p>

<p>JIC Assessment, 3 September 2003, ‘Iraq: Threats to Security’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>341. </b> The JIC assessed that: </p>
<p>“… many Mujahedin, willing to accept martyrdom, have come to Iraq since the war </p>
<p>… Most are probably not affiliated or connected with specific terrorist groups … </p>
<p>It appears that the networks see Iraq as the new focus for Jihad … We do not know </p>
<p>how many Mujahedin there are within Iraq, or how integrated they are …</p>
<p>“The main organised Islamic terrorist group in Iraq is Ansar al-Islam (AI), which is </p>
<p>closely associated with Al Qaida (AQ). The group suffered significant casualties in </p>
<p>Coalition attacks, but about 450 members escaped … AI has since reorganised, </p>
<p>with some assistance from elements of the Iranian regime, and its members are now </p>
<p>present in at least northern and central Iraq, with large quantities of weapons … and </p>
<p>explosives. Intelligence suggests Islamic extremists and possibly AI are also trying </p>
<p>to establish themselves in southern Iraq, though with what success is uncertain. </p>
<p>It seems that AI is becoming an important co-ordinator for Islamic volunteers from </p>
<p>across the Arab world, possibly reflecting an ambition to become a significant </p>
<p>international actor.”</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The Assessment continued:</p>
<p>“… Mujahedin groups and AI have conducted some of the low-level attacks on </p>
<p>Coalition Forces, but we cannot specify how many or which ones …</p>
<p>“Bin Laden has called on Muslims to fight the Coalition and encouraged extremists </p>
<p>to travel to Iraq. al-Zarqawi, closely associated with AI and AQ was reported before </p>
<p>the war to be establishing cells that would conduct attacks in the event of a Coalition </p>
<p>Occupation. Terrorists associated with al-Zarqawi probably remain in Iraq.</p>
<p>“Islamic extremists/terrorists can draw on external recruits and finance. We judge </p>
<p>that they are likely to present the main long-term threat to Coalition interests in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>343. </b> The JIC also judged that:</p>
<p>“Attacks by Iraqi Shia groups have been limited to date … reporting indicated </p>
<p>supporters of militant Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr are acquiring weapons, planning </p>
<p>attacks on Coalition targets and may have already attacked Iraqi officials.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> The JIC characterised Shia consent as “fragile and eroding” and judged that </p>
<p>any attempt to disarm Shia militia groups such as al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army “could be a </p>
<p>significant additional cause of friction”. The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“Hitherto, the general tenor of Shia clerical advice has been to give the Coalition </p>
<p>a year in which to make a difference. But the recent attacks are likely to have </p>
<p>shortened this timeline substantially. If the acquiescence of senior clerics and others </p>
<p>with influence … changes to hostility, it would have the most serious consequences </p>
<p>for the security situation in southern Iraq.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>Muqtada al-Sadr and Jaysh al-Mahdi</b></p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr was descended from a long line of distinguished Shia clerics known </p>
<p>for their political activism.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> His father, Grand Ayatollah Sadiq al-Sadr, was jailed under </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime and assassinated in 1999. </p>
<p>Muqtada inherited from his father a network of quasi-political offices in Baghdad and </p>
<p>across the south of Iraq called “Offices of the Martyr Sadr” (OMS) which were used to </p>
<p>spread the Sadrist message and provide social welfare. </p>
<p>After the bombing of the Imam Ali Mosque in Najaf by Al Qaida in August 2003, Muqtada </p>
<p>al-Sadr established an armed militia, Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) or the Mahdi Army, to protect </p>
<p>Shia religious establishments, counter the Badr Corps and resist the Occupation of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that concern about the problem of Sunni </p>
<p>marginalisation was growing through August and September 2003.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> The problem had </p>
<p>been “relatively easily diagnosed”: the Sunnis had gone from having a very dominant </p>
<p>role in all aspects of the Iraqi state under Saddam Hussein to having a very different </p>
<p>future in a democratic state in which they made up approximately 20 percent of the </p>
<p>population. The disbandment of the army and the de-Ba’athification process had also </p>
<p>had a huge effect on employment in the Sunni provinces of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> A message from Baghdad on 4 September confirmed that Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>had no problem with the issues to be discussed with President Bush.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> He was reported </p>
<p>to be requesting between US$20bn and US$22bn in additional funding to pay for </p>
<p>investment in infrastructure as well as the daily running of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>347. </b> The eight pieces of advice Mr Blair had requested were submitted the same day.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>348. </b> The IPU’s paper on security said that:</p>
<p>“Attacks on Coalition Forces, the UN and Iraqis working with the Coalition are </p>
<p>undermining confidence and holding back efforts to restore basic services. The </p>
<p>cumulative effect is to undermine the consent of the Iraqi people to the presence of </p>
<p>Coalition Forces and raise the risk of strategic failure.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>349. </b> The papers on security and essential services had been discussed by the AHMGIR </p>
<p>earlier in the day. On security, Mr Straw as Chair had commissioned further work, in </p>
<p>particular on addressing Iraq’s “porous borders”.</p>

<p><b>350. </b> The AHMGIR also endorsed Sir Hilary’s plan for essential services and stated that </p>
<p>it should be taken forward urgently. </p>
<p><b>351. </b> A US draft of the proposed Security Council resolution was also provided to the </p>
<p>meeting. Mr Straw explained that it “included a timetable for the transfer of sovereignty, </p>
<p>expanding the United Nations role and calling for a multi-national force under unified </p>
<p>command”. Mr Straw expected that the French and German governments would </p>
<p>be “constructive”. </p>
<p><b>352. </b> The AHMGIR was also made aware of a new senior officials group on Iraq, chaired </p>
<p>by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, that would meet twice weekly. This group was known as the Iraq </p>
<p>Senior Officials Group (ISOG). </p>
<p><b>353. </b> Mr Hilary Benn wrote to Mr Blair on 4 September to explain that he had approved </p>
<p>£20m of DFID funding in support of the essential services plan. The balance would need </p>
<p>to come from the CPA in Baghdad. Mr Benn explained that he had:</p>
<p>“… held back from committing to meet the full cost, to avoid giving the impression </p>
<p>to the CPA that HMG wants to take on full responsibility for the south of the country </p>
<p>including the future funding of all infrastructure.”</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>354. </b> RAND reported that, in early September, Ambassador Bremer published a plan for </p>
<p>the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> The steps described by the plan were:</p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p>the creation of the GC;</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>the formation of the Constitutional Preparatory Committee (CPC) to propose </p>
<p>how to write the Constitution;</p>

<p>(v) </p>

<p><b>355. </b> This ‘Seven Step Plan’ did not include a timescale. </p>
<p><b>356. </b> On 4 September, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary sent a paper to Mr Cannon </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>357. </b> The paper said that elections were not yet possible because there was no </p>
<p>Constitution, no accurate electoral roll, no free media, and political parties were not </p>
<p>well established. Realistically, the process of drafting a Constitution would take six to </p>
<p>eight months. Elections might then happen within two months of the ratification of the </p>
<p>Constitution, which would mean summer 2004. </p>
<p><b>358. </b> The paper also recorded calls for an earlier transfer of sovereignty and suggested </p>
<p>that Sir Jeremy Greenstock should explore with the GC and Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>whether there was a “credible or viable way to move to a provisional Government, with </p>
<p>or without sovereignty, in advance of elections”. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> On 4 September, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft to report that:</p>
<p>“… in the light of the changing security situation in the South-East of Iraq and in view </p>
<p>of likely next steps by the CPA, the Defence Secretary had concluded that there </p>
<p>is an immediate requirement to deploy a further two infantry battalions and certain </p>
<p>specialist capabilities to Iraq … we intend to identify and put on reduced notice to </p>
<p>move a Brigade HQ, Infantry battalion and engineer capability as a contingency to </p>
<p>support the implementation of the CPA(S) plan for emergency infrastructure work …”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>360. </b> In advance of a planned conversation between Mr Blair and President Bush on </p>
<p>5 September, Sir Nigel Sheinwald spoke twice to Dr Rice.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>361. </b> Sir Nigel emphasised “the need to reflect in our [security] strategy our assessment </p>
<p>of the new and growing threats to the Coalition. There was a mood of considerable </p>
<p>concern in London, requiring a response across the board.” </p>
<p><b>362. </b> Dr Rice agreed that there was “reason for concern”, but there was also a sense on </p>
<p>the US side that things were not going as badly as the media portrayed and that an effort </p>
<p>should be made to inject more balance. Sir Nigel and Dr Rice “agreed that the level of </p>
<p>overall concern in London was maybe a notch or two higher than in Washington”. They </p>
<p>also agreed that the video conference between the Prime Minister and the President </p>
<p>should concentrate on security, reconstruction, infrastructure and utilities, media, and </p>
<p>prospects for international contributions.</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Sir Nigel congratulated Dr Rice on the US draft of the new Security Council </p>
<p>resolution. He observed that the UK “had some comments; but if we could get something </p>
<p>like it agreed, it should make a substantial difference internationally”. </p>
<p><b>364. </b> After their conversations, Sir Nigel sent Dr Rice a Note from Mr Blair for President </p>

<p><b>365. </b> In his Note, Mr Blair proposed doubling the number of Iraqi police and speeding </p>
<p>up the process of letting reconstruction contracts. In the South, he wrote that he had </p>
<p>“authorised” the CPA to “just spend the money and recoup later from CPA(Centre)”. </p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Blair confirmed that an increase in the numbers of British troops would be </p>
<p>announced in the following days. He expressed support for Ambassador Bremer, and </p>
<p>queried whether he had all the administrative and technical support he needed. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> On the developing resolution, Mr Blair wrote “I wouldn’t bet on too much help </p>
<p>coming forward … I suspect that unless we sort security, help will be hard to find”.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Blair concluded: </p>
<p>“So my basic point is: the problem is not complex to identify: it is security. The best </p>
<p>solution is not us or at least us alone but the Iraqis. It is speed in building their </p>
<p>capacity – security, intelligence, infrastructure, media – that we need.” </p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Cannon reported the video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush to </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Private Office on 5 September.</p>

<p> The conversation had followed Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Note closely. </p>
<p><b>370. </b> Dr Rice and Sir Nigel had been asked to draw up a list of concrete measures that </p>
<p>could be taken to improve the situation. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> Sir Nigel and Dr Rice spoke later on 5 September and agreed that their report </p>

<p><b>372. </b> Mr Hoon informed Parliament on 8 September that there would be an increased </p>

<p><b>373. </b> To meet the immediate requirement, the rest of 2nd Battalion the Light Infantry </p>
<p>– one company of which was already in Iraq – would be deployed from Cyprus along </p>
<p>with 1st Battalion the Royal Green Jackets, plus some specialist personnel. They would </p>
<p>remain in Iraq until around November. </p>
<p><b>374. </b> By 11 September, reporting from Iraq suggested that the Constitutional Preparatory </p>

<p>decided by nationwide elections.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>375. </b> The report also said that the fatwa issued by Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani at the </p>
<p>beginning of July was “exerting enormous influence” on their deliberations. </p>
<p><b>376. </b> Elections would mean delay, which Mr Richmond anticipated might lead to a push </p>
<p>for the early restoration of Iraqi sovereignty, through the GC. Ambassador Bremer did </p>
<p>not consider that a viable option. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Richmond commented that it was:</p>
<p>“… also impractical: a transfer of sovereignty which left – as it would have  </p>
<p>to do – security, and given the US financial investment, economic/financial  </p>
<p>issues in Coalition hands would be pretty meaningless.”</p>

<p> He reported that the </p>

<p>international involvement was required. </p>

<p> It covered security, intelligence, infrastructure, media and personnel. </p>
<p><b>381. </b> The objectives were:</p>

<p>11 and 12 September.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>383. </b> Sir Nigel reported to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“We share <b>objectives</b>; and there now appear to be detailed <b>plans</b> under </p>
<p>development by the CPA in all the priority areas. Condi was particularly clear on the </p>
<p>urgency of work on <b>electricity</b> (including imports from Iran), <b>police</b> and <b>CDC </b>[Civil </p>
<p>Defence Corps] training, and confident that we were starting to develop a coherent </p>

<p><b>384. </b> Sir Nigel and Dr Rice agreed that there would be regular video conferences </p>
<p>between London, Washington and Baghdad “to ensure we are all working from the same </p>
<p>script”. </p>
<p><b>385. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported on the political process a few days later. </p>
<p>He wrote that:</p>
<p>“An early transfer of sovereignty … raises constitutional and practical problems and </p>
<p>is unlikely to deliver our aim of a democratic and stable Iraq. The current political </p>
<p>process still offers the best way forward and has not yet been derailed. Nevertheless </p>
<p>we should be thinking about fallbacks.”</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Sir Jeremy explained that the Seven Step Plan had already run into trouble. </p>
<p>Firstly, as Mr Richmond had set out, because of a desire for an elected Constitutional </p>
<p>Convention. </p>
<p><b>387. </b> Secondly, because of pressure from Members of the UN Security Council to </p>
<p>accelerate the process of handing over sovereignty to the Iraqis. </p>
<p><b>388. </b> Sir Jeremy observed that if sovereignty were handed to the GC “questions about </p>
<p>legitimacy come to the fore”. Alternatively, it would be possible to:</p>
<p>“… hold ‘quick and dirty’ elections for a provisional assembly, which would then </p>
<p>draft a Constitution and provide an interim but sovereign government. But holding </p>

<p>Council etc.”</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Sir Jeremy repeated that Ambassador Bremer was not supportive of an early </p>
<p>handover of power. He assessed that:</p>
<p>“As long as the Coalition remains a major presence in Iraq, it is difficult to see how </p>
<p>it could cede ultimate authority over policy decisions which would affect the Security </p>
<p>of the Coalition Forces, the expenditure of Coalition resources or Iraq’s commitment </p>
<p>to human rights, a free market and democracy. If we on the UK side think differently </p>
<p>because we judge the Coalition does not have the time and the opportunity to deliver </p>
<p>these wider goals, then we have a gap in perceptions and objectives with the US we </p>
<p>need to resolve.”</p>
<p><b>390. </b> Replying to Sir Jeremy the following day, Mr Sawers wrote: </p>
<p>“I welcome your confirmation that the political process we mapped out last July </p>
<p>remains, in your and Bremer’s view, achievable. Sticking to that approach would be </p>
<p>our best bet.”</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Sawers explained that the UK’s priority should be to stick to the timescale </p>
<p>leading to elections in mid-2004 that he and Ambassador Bremer had envisaged.  </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“We are looking at fallback options, including the possibility of the sort of two stage </p>
<p>transition that you were advocating earlier this year from New York … </p>
<p>“We agree with your conclusion that we should explore this alternative route. But we </p>
<p>will do so circumspectly, and only activate it if the existing plan has to be reviewed. </p>
<p>We are not at the point where we and the Americans seriously differ; but we are </p>

<p><b>392. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock responded on 19 September to say that “discussion  </p>
<p>of possible timings for the political process needs to take more careful account of  </p>
<p>the variables”.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>393. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that “indications that the CPC [Constitutional Preparatory </p>
<p>Committee] would recommend elections to the Constitutional Conference … are being </p>
<p>tempered”, he did not sense that there was “real momentum” within the GC to press for </p>
<p>the transfer of executive power quickly. Ambassador Bremer was encouraging the GC to </p>
<p>come up with a timetable for the Seven Steps. </p>
<p><b>394. </b> Sir Jeremy recommended that a “sensible strategy is to be serious about the </p>
<p>Seven Steps, but to watch carefully, and try to affect the outcome of, the variables”. </p>
<p>Those variables were, in his view: security incidents, Iraqi public reaction, Iraqi political </p>
<p>developments and securing external resources. </p>
<p><b>395. </b> When they spoke on 16 September, Mr Blair and President Bush agreed to hold </p>
<p>regular video conferences, “usually weekly”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>396. </b> On 17 September, General Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, sent a report </p>
<p>of his visit to Iraq to Gen Walker.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p><b>397. </b> On troop numbers, Gen Jackson wrote: </p>
<p>“GOC MND(SE) … does not require a third additional battalion … at the moment </p>
<p>and is confident that he can meet any potential tasks that arise from the essential </p>
<p>services short-term plan. There is therefore no requirement for an additional brigade </p>
<p>HQ at this stage. This may change and we need to remain responsive to the needs </p>
<p>of the GOC. I see a requirement to establish a mechanism that earmarks forces … </p>
<p>at an appropriate notice to move.” </p>
<p><b>398. </b> Gen Jackson reported:</p>
<p>“The threats to Coalition and indigenous security stem from a wide variety of </p>
<p>sources including organised crime, former regime loyalists (FRL) and international </p>
<p>terrorism. Attacks are focussed against both Coalition troops and infrastructure, </p>
<p>whilst organised crime, looting and smuggling continue to erode essential services </p>
<p>… At every level the Coalition is finding it difficult to obtain a cohesive picture of </p>
<p>these various threats.”</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Gen Jackson proposed moving the focus of intelligence-gathering assets away </p>
<p>from the search for weapons of mass destruction and towards counter-terrorism. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr Benn visited Baghdad from 17 to 19 September and reported that neither </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer nor the GC wanted to set a timetable for the transfer of power from </p>
<p>the CPA to an Iraqi administration. He added, “Interestingly, none of the Iraqis we talked </p>
<p>to raised this issue.”</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Benn thought that the UK should continue to explore the potential for transition </p>
<p>steps, as suggested by Sir Jeremy Greenstock. Interim Iraqi ministers had by now </p>
<p>begun work. Ambassador Bremer talked about handing over power to them but seemed </p>
<p>“reluctant to let go”. </p>
<p><b>402. </b> Mr Benn’s experience contrasted with that of Secretary Powell, whose own visit </p>
<p>was reported by Sir Jeremy Greenstock to have included “a meeting with the IGC during </p>
<p>which IGC members made a strong pitch for immediate transfer of sovereignty”.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>403. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that the GC had been “very active”. It had agreed a </p>
<p>package of economic reforms (including bank regulations, measures to encourage </p>
<p>foreign investment and new tax rates), approved a new nationality law and visited Najaf </p>
<p>where it had taken action to protect holy shrines. </p>
<p><b>404. </b> The activities of the GC’s High National De-Ba’athification Commission are </p>
<p>recorded in Section 11.1. </p>
<p><b>The assassination of Dr Aqila al-Hashemi</b></p>
<p>On 20 September, Dr Aqila al-Hashemi, a member of the GC, was ambushed and shot </p>
<p>while driving near her home in Baghdad.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The GC’s Secretary General had been targeted in a similar – but unsuccessful – attack </p>
<p>two days earlier. </p>
<p>Dr al-Hashemi died of her injuries on 25 September.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented to the FCO in London that the attack on </p>
<p>Dr al-Hashemi:</p>
<p>“… brings into sharp relief the need for professional and effective Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces. An early UK gesture of help would be widely noticed and appreciated.”</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He explained that it seemed likely that Dr al-Hashemi had been deliberately targeted </p>
<p>as she lived “in a neighbourhood surrounded by ex-Ba’ath party members and had </p>
<p>received many warnings that she was being watched.” Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Ahmad </p>

<p>recommendations to improve the security provisions, which the CPA was taking forward. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported on 24 September that the attack on Dr al-Hashemi had </p>
<p>“sharpened the angst in the GC … more broadly, about whether they are on the right track </p>
<p>in hitching themselves to a CPA which may be a dead end”.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 25 September, Sir Jeremy described the impact of the attack on GC members’ </p>
<p>concerns about the overall security situation – “if IGC members were not safe, what about </p>
<p>the general public? … There were also questions about who was ultimately responsible for </p>
<p>security.”</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy had explained to the GC that “this was a collective effort. Neither of </p>
<p>us could ensure security without the co-operation of the other.” He concluded his telegram </p>
<p>by observing that the debate had increased interest in the idea of: </p>
<p>“… greater involvement of already present Iraqi militia forces (the Peshmerga, the </p>
<p>Badr Brigade) in helping managing the security demands. Authorising militias to </p>
<p>perform security tasks is clearly beyond the pale. But we may have to start thinking </p>
<p>creatively – and I said this to the GC – about how we can use these forces within </p>
<p>national, clearly controlled structures.”</p>

<p>237</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>406. </b> The ISOG had commissioned a short-term Action Plan, subordinate to the UK </p>

<p><b>407. </b> Funding for the major initiative on infrastructure in the South still remained </p>
<p>uncertain. Sir Hilary Synnott was “confident of obtaining further CPA funds … although </p>
<p>the processes by which these would be transferred to CPA(South) are unclear”. </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Reporting from Basra on 22 September, Sir Hilary Synnott wrote that security was:</p>
<p>“… the main and constantly expressed concern of everyone we talk to … Straight </p>
<p>criminality may be developing into organised crime: a result of Saddam’s emptying </p>
<p>of the jails and general amnesty and the lifting of his draconian controls … Many, </p>
<p>perhaps most, of the citizenry would like the Army to go in and shoot a few criminals </p>
<p>and, if we insist that they follow due process of law, have them hanged.</p>

<p> It said that: </p>
<p>“Since the end of August there has been an increase in the number of attacks </p>
<p>against Coalition Forces in Iraq … In the large majority of cases we cannot attribute </p>
<p>attacks to specific groups. Most of the attacks are against US forces in the centre </p>
<p>and north of the country and casualties continue to be taken at a steady rate. We </p>
<p>have no accurate figures for civilian casualties. The tactics of the armed opposition </p>
<p>groups continue to evolve, including the increased use of more sophisticated IEDs </p>
<p>and more elaborate attacks … Intimidation of Iraqis working [for] or seen to be </p>
<p>supporting the Coalition, criminal activity, and attacks against the police, have all </p>
<p>continued … There has been limited violence between Sunni and Shia communities </p>
<p>in the aftermath of the al-Hakim murder and any further attacks against the Shia </p>
<p>leadership [are] likely to lead to further inter-communal violence.</p>
<p>“Counter to the overall trend, the number of attacks against CF [Coalition Forces] </p>
<p>in … MND(SE) has reduced since mid-August and had reached its lowest level </p>
<p>since June. Of the total of 1,025 incidents [across Iraq, in the period 10 June to </p>
<p>9 September] only 22 took place in the UK area.”</p>
<p><b>411. </b> On Shia attitudes, the JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“Some Shia groups have demanded greater latitude to provide their own security </p>
<p>and this has resulted in the emergence of militias supporting Shia parties, some with </p>
<p>a capability to gather intelligence, conduct patrolling and mount vehicle check points </p>
<p>… However the militias are also carrying out illegal arrests, interrogations, and in </p>

<p><b>412. </b> The JIC assessed that there continued to be a significant volume of reporting on </p>
<p>the flow into Iraq of extremists, whose affiliation was often unknown. It also remained </p>
<p>unclear how many mujahedin were operating in Iraq. AI was privately claiming to be </p>
<p>responsible for 80 percent of the attacks against Coalition Forces but the JIC concluded </p>
<p>that those claims were probably exaggerated. The group:</p>
<p>“… appeared to have built on its local contacts and presence in the Kurdish </p>
<p>Autonomous Zone to position itself as the main organised Islamic terrorist group in </p>
<p>Iraq, and is likely to be working with other groups.”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> The JIC assessed that AI was developing a long-term strategy which suggested </p>
<p>that “future targeting should focus on infrastructure and strike as opposed to martyrdom </p>
<p>operations”. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> The JIC wrote that, in a new development since early September:</p>
<p>“AQ may be trying to establish an operational capability in Iraq … There are some </p>
<p>reports that al-Zarqawi … is in Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>415. </b> On 26 September, the UK Iraq Strategy was circulated to members of the AHMGIR </p>
<p>for comment.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>416. </b> Major General Andrew Figgures, who succeeded Maj Gen Viggers as Senior </p>
<p>British Military Representative-Iraq in September 2003, told the Inquiry that by </p>
<p>October 2003 central Iraq was in the grip of a growing insurgency.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> Understanding </p>
<p>the insurgency took a considerable time because of a “severe lack of human </p>
<p>intelligence” and the “lack of the ability to fuse it together to gain the understanding </p>
<p>of the situation”.</p>

<p> Many members (including the then President, Dr Ayad Allawi) </p>
<p>were absent, the meeting was poorly organised and GC approval of the 2004 budget </p>
<p>was delayed. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> Ambassador Bremer had raised the GC announcing decisions without consulting </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>419. </b> When the AHMGIR met on 2 October it did not discuss the draft Iraq Strategy.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attendees were provided with the, now populated, Short-Term Iraq Action Plan. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> The Annotated Agenda for those attending the meeting observed that: </p>
<p>“The new UNSCR has lost momentum in the US administration with the Pentagon </p>
<p>losing enthusiasm and little pressure for decision from Bremer.”</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>421. </b> The new resolution was unlikely to be passed until late October, shortly before </p>
<p>a planned Iraq Donors’ Conference, to be held in Madrid. The UK’s objective for the </p>
<p>conference was “to broaden international support for reconstruction in Iraq and secure </p>
<p>the necessary funding”. </p>
<p><b>422. </b> On 4 October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the CPA was developing ideas </p>
<p>on how to reach out to the Sunni population in Iraq.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> Mr Richmond had been asked to </p>
<p>play a leading role. Discussions at a senior level in CPA acknowledged that it had not </p>
<p>spent much effort on involving the Sunnis. There needed to be a comprehensive political </p>
<p>strategy to give them a stake in the process. </p>
<p><b>423. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that the CPA had consulted widely with Sunni </p>
<p>community leaders, and with Coalition commanders and CPA Co-ordinators in the Sunni </p>
<p>governorates.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> They drew up a programme with 30, 60 and 90 day targets covering </p>
<p>employment, including recruitment into the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps, and talked about </p>
<p>whether de-Ba’athification could be made more flexible. They also discussed trying to </p>
<p>reconnect Sunnis with the political process.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Sir David concluded:</p>
<p>“… quite a lot happened. Did it make a difference? Sadly not. This all coincided with </p>
<p>the marked increase in the insurgency towards the end of October.”</p>
<p>249</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Sir David said he had been very concerned that there was “too much stick and  </p>
<p>not enough carrot” and that aspects of the response to the Sunni insurgency were not </p>
<p>well handled. Getting the Sunni involved in the political process had been extremely </p>
<p>difficult because:</p>
<p>“… it wasn’t possible to go to the Sunnis and say ‘Here is a political process and your </p>
<p>part in this is as follows. This is how you get involved and influence the process’. We </p>
<p>were never able to do that.”</p>

<p><b>426. </b> On 5 October, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note written by Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>427. </b> In his Note Mr Blair suggested that he and the President had a common political </p>
<p>problem; losses in Iraq plus the failure to find “enough on WMD” were leading the </p>
<p>public to doubt the value of the invasion and the international community to “a sense </p>
<p>of Schadenfreude”. </p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the solution was “a coherent strategy to get us back on  </p>
<p>the high ground and get the public, at home and abroad, to focus on the big picture”. </p>
<p>That meant:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>getting a shared US/UK sense of what decisions on Iraq were vital and how to </p>
<p>take them, plus what the blockages were and how to remove them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>trying for a new UN resolution, but “only at the right price”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>being unapologetic about the need to deal with the continued security threat </p>
<p>from WMD; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tackling the wider agenda, including the MEPP, climate change and reactivating </p>
<p>the World Trade Organization. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the way ahead should include a regular, perhaps weekly, </p>
<p>stocktake on Iraq to “remove any blockages and give direction” and the need to “get our </p>
<p>confidence in our story back. Iraq is better without Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Blair’s Note ended:</p>
<p>“And by this time next year, it better be going right, not wrong. For us and for </p>
<p>the world!”</p>
<p><b>431. </b> A video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush on 7 October, also </p>
<p>attended by Vice President Cheney and Dr Rice, suggested that the US Administration </p>
<p>was upbeat.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> US Congressional visitors to Iraq from both American political parties had </p>
<p>been struck by the extent to which the issue of Iraq was perceived in the US through the </p>
<p>“biased filter” of the media.</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that he agreed with Ambassador Bremer that there </p>
<p>should be no early handover of executive power in Iraq, observing that Iraqis themselves </p>
<p>preferred stability under the Coalition umbrella to instability with an Iraqi government. </p>
<p><b>433. </b> Mr Blair made the case for the new Security Council resolution, but concluded  </p>
<p>that it would not help much with extra troops or reconstruction. The US still wanted a </p>
<p>further resolution. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>434. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… by and large, the American political assessment of what was going on in Iraq </p>
<p>was more positive than our own. In conversations with Bush and in conversations </p>
<p>with other people … by and large the impression was not that things were going </p>
<p>well, but they didn’t have the same sense of foreboding and concern which was </p>
<p>evident in London from the summer of 2003.”</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>435. </b> On 7 October, PJHQ reported a “major public order disturbance” in Basra, </p>
<p>at the site where former Iraqi army conscripts were paid their stipend.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> It was </p>
<p>thought to be the result of rumours that there was not enough money to pay all those </p>
<p>who were eligible. </p>
<p><b>436. </b> The protesters burned the records required to make the payments. PJHQ reported </p>
<p>that “Iraqi police were present but were unable to control the incident and dispersed”. </p>
<p><b>437. </b> During the incident, UK troops shot dead an Iraqi man. He was thought at the time </p>
<p>to be a protestor, but later identified as an armed security officer in plain clothes.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 8 October, a final version of the UK Iraq Strategy was issued to members of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR by Cabinet Office after “those Private Offices who responded indicated their </p>
<p>Ministers’ endorsement”.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>439. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald annotated his copy: “I don’t see a need for PM to see this.” </p>
<p><b>440. </b> The Strategy acknowledged the CPA Strategy published in July 2003 and stated </p>
<p>that this was a longer-term UK Strategy for Iraq that was broadly consistent with it, but </p>
<p>which set the framework for specific UK activities towards a common objective.</p>
<p><b>441. </b> The Strategy identified the UK objective as:</p>
<p>“Iraq to become a stable, united and law-abiding state, within its present borders, </p>
<p>co-operating with the international community, no longer posing a threat to its </p>
<p>neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its international obligations and </p>
<p>providing effective representative government, sustainable economic growth and </p>
<p>rising living standards to all its people.”</p>
<p><b>442. </b> The Strategy defined a Stabilisation Phase up to December 2003, for which  </p>
<p>the objective was that Iraq should be restored to pre-conflict levels of development  </p>
<p>and order. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> During 2004 there would be a Recovery Phase, during which the CPA would pass </p>
<p>all its powers to a sovereign, representative Iraqi Government. </p>

<p>281</p>
<p><b>444. </b> From 2005, Iraq would enter a Normalisation Phase, when the Strategy assumed </p>
<p>the UK’s objective would have been met, iraq would be largely self-supporting and </p>
<p>Coalition Forces (apart from trainers) would have been withdrawn. </p>
<p><b>445. </b> Analysis of the conditions in Iraq acknowledged both that the UK did “not wish </p>
<p>to remain Occupying Power of Iraq for any longer than is necessary” and that “our </p>
<p>influence over US policy is limited”. </p>
<p><b>446. </b> The following risks were identified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The pace of political and reconstruction progress could fall.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The resistance of forces opposing the Coalition could escalate significantly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Oil production could continue to lag.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iran and Turkey could increase their interference.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition support for the Occupation could collapse in the event of sustained </p>
<p>high casualty levels.</p>
<p><b>447. </b> The Strategy identified the highest threat as being a sustained insurgency, </p>
<p>including frequent terrorist attacks. It also identified the “worst case scenario” as  </p>
<p>major Islamist terrorist groups, especially non-Iraqis, beginning to drive the opposition, </p>
<p>as they would have no interest in engaging in the political process. The paper identified </p>
<p>possible solutions: </p>
<p>“More security forces, particularly local. Greater intelligence collection and </p>
<p>co-ordination, particularly in order to facilitate counter-terrorist operations.  </p>
<p>Greater co-operation with and pressure on neighbours to secure borders. Security </p>
<p>package for UN to allow it to resume work.” </p>
<p><b>448. </b> The Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP) met on 9 October, chaired by </p>
<p>Mr Blair.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> This was the first meeting of DOP in 2003 and the first to discuss Iraq since </p>
<p>1999. A background note on Iraq, a paper on political process by the IPU and a paper on </p>
<p>the Madrid Conference were tabled. </p>
<p><b>449. </b> The meeting began with an assessment of the security situation. Mr Scarlett </p>
<p>reported that while attacks on the Coalition were rising, 80 percent of them were </p>
<p>taking place in the “Sunni triangle”. Disillusioned Sunnis, who did not see a future for </p>
<p>themselves in the new Iraq, were the principal source of concern. </p>
<p><b>450. </b> Lt Gen Fry reported that the security situation in southern Iraq was very different </p>
<p>from that in the Sunni triangle. He argued that the Shia were largely co-operative and </p>
<p>the British approach to making balanced progress on governance, the economy and </p>
<p>security was paying dividends.</p>
<p>257 </p>
<p>Minutes, 9 October 2003, DOP meeting. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Mr Blair said that he wanted to see more progress on the delivery of better media </p>
<p>output by the Iraqi network. Overall, he believed that the security situation could be </p>
<p>turned around. The key to this was to deal with the Sunni triangle, where political </p>
<p>disaffection generated support for those acting against the Coalition. He invited Mr Straw </p>
<p>to draw up a strategy to tackle this urgently. </p>
<p><b>452. </b> The IPU paper on political process said that the “Bremer plan” remained the best </p>
<p>way forward.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> That view was shared in Baghdad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>453. </b> IPU also reported that it remained likely that the GC would opt for elections to </p>
<p>the Constitution Convention, resulting in a period of Occupation lasting two and a half </p>
<p>years. Mr Annan was supporting a French/German proposal to create a provisional </p>
<p>government, under a UN lead.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> The IPU set out a new approach which inserted an interim “provisional </p>
<p>government” to act as the repository of Iraqi sovereignty until the constitutional process </p>
<p>was complete and an elected Iraqi Government in place, “modifying the Bremer plan, </p>
<p>rather than redesigning it”.</p>
<p><b>455. </b> IPU suggested that a provisional government might be formed by either bringing </p>
<p>together the GC, ministers and the CPC or through “rough and ready” elections; or by a </p>
<p>mixture of the two. </p>
<p><b>456. </b> The paper asked members of DOP:</p>
<p>“… to agree that we should work to speed up the transfer of power to Iraqis; </p>
<p>continue to work for a central UN role based on partnership; keep open that this </p>
<p>process might make it possible to move to a Provisional Government once certain </p>
<p>conditions are met; that we should explore such an approach with the US, if </p>
<p>developments on the constitutional process dictate a change of tack.” </p>
<p><b>457. </b> The minutes of DOP’s discussion show that Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“The timetable conceived by the Bremer plan would deliver elections for a </p>
<p>representative government in Iraq by this time next year. He looked forward to </p>
<p>further advice on discussions between the Coalition Provisional Authority and the </p>
<p>Governing Council about the handling of the political process in order to create </p>
<p>greater stability in Iraq by next spring.”</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>458. </b> On 9 October, Sir Hilary Synnott reported to the FCO that: </p>
<p>“All observers close to the scene here detect markedly improved attitudes </p>
<p>throughout the South over the last three months … The overriding impression, </p>
<p>backed by some firm evidence, is that the general population and its leadership have </p>
<p>decided to give the Coalition the benefit of the doubt and thus to co-operate with us </p>
<p>and to discourage opposition … </p>

<p>283</p>
<p>“The feedback from our interlocutors is positive (and we collectively have a great </p>
<p>deal of direct contact with a wide range of Iraqis, at many levels) … The weekly </p>
<p>number of attacks against the Coalition has declined from 20 in August to two last </p>
<p>week (none the week before).”</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>459. </b> Sir Hilary continued:</p>
<p>“Of course it is not all peace and tranquillity. Violence is endemic in the South, as it is </p>
<p>in Iraq generally. Now that Saddam’s yoke has been lifted, some new manifestations </p>
<p>are becoming apparent. As in many developing countries, the irreducible level of </p>
<p>violence could end up being quite high. Tribal feuds are common … and involve </p>
<p>bloodshed as well as bravado. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Also worrying is continuing sectarian violence, although this is still at a low level.”</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… there was still this tendency among some to regard the South as the British </p>
<p>fiefdom, but actually, of course, it was not insulated from external factors and these </p>
<p>external factors were very important in terms of the security and level of violence.”</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>461. </b> On 11 October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Ambassador Bremer was:</p>
<p>“… determined to stick to his preferred order of events – Constitution, referendum, </p>
<p>national elections, transfer of sovereignty, if possible completed within the next 12 </p>
<p>months – but is open to imaginative ideas along the way”.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>462. </b> On 13 October, Lt Gen Fry put a paper to the Chiefs of Staff on the options for </p>
<p>deployment of the ARRC HQ.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> He considered there were three options – a moderate </p>
<p>role in Afghanistan from August 2004; a more extensive role in Afghanistan, also from </p>
<p>August 2004; or taking over as the Coalition HQ in Iraq (fulfilling the role then filled </p>
<p>by the CJTF-7 HQ) from March 2005. He commented that all of these would have </p>
<p>“significant personnel impact across the Army”. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> Specifically in relation to Iraq, Lt Gen Fry commented that:</p>
<p>“Since the end of Op TELIC Phase 3, Iraq has offered the potential for the most </p>
<p>challenging and high profile employment for HQ ARRC … However, the prospect of </p>
<p>deployment into Iraq in 04/05 continues to look unlikely. It remains the assessment </p>
<p>that while US casualties are being taken at a steady rate, internationalising the </p>
<p>three-star command is doubtful. Importantly, against this backdrop, it is difficult for </p>
<p>the UK to bring its influence to bear to encourage the necessary conditions for HQ </p>

<p>there is a risk that should deployment later be deemed appropriate, HQ ARRC could </p>
<p>find itself employed as a stopgap between US commands rather than as part of a </p>
<p>wider strategic shift as originally envisaged.”</p>
<p><b>464. </b> On 13 October, Mr Richmond reported that Ambassador Bremer’s frustration with </p>
<p>the GC, and in particular its ineffective decision-making processes, had led him to take </p>
<p>steps to improve its operation. These were “focused on the need to make the current </p>
<p>structures work” because he was “especially loathe to change the seven steps”.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock called on Mr Blair in London on 15 October.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> During their </p>
<p>meeting, Sir Jeremy said that, unlike in Baghdad: </p>
<p>“… a virtuous circle seemed to be building up in the South, with locals supporting the </p>
<p>reconstruction process and turning in to the Coalition outsiders who disrupted it.”</p>
<p><b>466. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported new security threats, which might include the risk </p>
<p>of rioters storming their premises or of assassination by “suborning Iraqi support </p>
<p>staff”. Sir Jeremy observed that the terrorists and supporters of Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>“were ‘mutating’ in their structures and methods faster than Coalition intelligence </p>
<p>could keep up”. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> A response by the Coalition, in Sir Jeremy’s view, should include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqiisation, but “real capability” was a year away;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>combatting Sunni marginalisation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a more flexible approach to de-Ba’athification;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>internationalisation; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improved border control, requiring up to 20,000 troops. </p>
<p><b>468. </b> In relation to the new resolution, Sir Jeremy said that:</p>
<p>“… the timing of this had been far from ideal from a CPA perspective: it would have </p>
<p>had a greater impact in two months’ time. He urged closer co-ordination between </p>
<p>London and IraqRep on such issues.”</p>
<p><b>469. </b> On 15 October, the JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“The security situation remains difficult in central Iraq. The upward trend in the </p>
<p>number of attacks against the Coalition Forces shows no sign of abatement … The </p>
<p>vast majority of attacks (some 80 percent) occur in Baghdad and the surrounding </p>

<p>the areas that Sunni Islamist terrorists were using or were likely to use as bases to </p>
<p>coalesce, recruit, train and plan attacks in safety.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> It also considered the circumstances </p>
<p>that terrorists might exploit in order to operate in this way. </p>
<p><b>471. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“Iraq has already attracted significant numbers of mujahedin seeking jihad. It is </p>
<p>possible that, if the security situation worsens, these mujahedin will be able to </p>
<p>coalesce into relatively large groups in areas where the population is sympathetic </p>
<p>to their causes, and where they can establish small training facilities and can </p>
<p>co-ordinate terrorist activity both inside, and outside, Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>472. </b> The JIC judged that some countries currently regarded as safe locations by </p>
<p>Islamist terrorists would continue to improve their counter terrorism efforts, but that:</p>
<p>“… without significant Western support, others (eg … Iraq) will be unable to prevent </p>
<p>terrorists establishing a presence.”</p>
<p><b>473. </b> At this point in October 2003, the MOD’s planning assumptions were:</p>
<p>“… [a] UK military presence in SE Iraq until at least the end of March 2006, at up </p>
<p>to a 2-star HQ, a medium scale land contribution, and small scale naval and air </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a stabilised security situation, with a functioning Iraqi criminal justice system;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>International Development Secretary, that Ambassador Bremer would not give up the </p>
<p>Seven Steps.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> In Sir Jeremy’s opinion that was too inflexible. </p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Benn’s Assistant Private Secretary reported to a senior DFID official </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy’s advice that: </p>
<p>“… the international community was shouting for a proper Iraqi Government, but this </p>
<p>will not happen until there is a real election. In the interim, Bremer would be content </p>
<p>for a front Government without real power.” </p>

<p>271</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>479. </b> The Security Council re-stated that the CPA’s authority in Iraq “will cease when an </p>
<p>internationally recognized, representative government established by the people of Iraq </p>
<p>is sworn in and assumes the responsibilities of the Authority”. </p>
<p><b>480. </b> The resolution confirmed that the GC and its ministers were the principal bodies </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Interim Administration, which embodied the sovereignty of Iraq until a </p>
<p>representative government was established which assumed the responsibilities of the </p>
<p>CPA. It declared that “the day when Iraqis govern themselves must come quickly”.</p>
<p><b>481. </b> In operative paragraph 13, the Security Council determined that “the provision of </p>
<p>security and stability is essential to the successful completion of the political process … </p>
<p>and to the ability of the United Nations to contribute effectively to that process and the </p>
<p>implementation of resolution 1483” and authorised “a multi-national force under unified </p>
<p>command to take all necessary measures to contribute to the maintenance of security </p>

<p><b>482. </b> On 17 October, Mr Llewellyn sent his preliminary views of the effect of resolution </p>
<p>1511 on “the pre-existing position of the UK in Iraq” to Ms Adams.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> He concluded that </p>
<p>the UK did not cease to be an Occupying Power because resolution 1511 authorised the </p>
<p>presence of a multi-national force, but that the resolution did define the point at which </p>
<p>the Occupation would come to an end as being “when an internationally recognised, </p>
<p>representative government established by the people of Iraq is sworn in and assumes </p>
<p>the responsibilities of the Authority”.</p>
<p><b>483. </b> Mr Llewellyn wrote that the resolution required “a progressive diminution in the </p>
<p>CPA’s authority”, without defining a specific timetable in which that should happen. </p>

<p><b>485. </b> By 23 October, Mr Sawers was beginning to doubt that credible elections </p>
<p>producing a good result, based on a legitimate Constitution, would be possible during </p>
<p>the course of 2004 because of the length of time it was likely to take to produce a </p>
<p>legitimate Constitution.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>486. </b> Mr Sawers indicated in a letter to Mr Simon Webb, MOD Policy Director, that he </p>
<p>had begun some new work on the political process in Iraq. The conclusion was that the </p>
<p>UK should avoid its forces continuing as occupiers with a Bremer-type figure in control </p>
<p>beyond 2004. </p>
<p><b>487. </b> There was a case for a provisional government, with executive powers and full </p>
<p>sovereignty, to provide more time in which to draw up a full Constitution. A provisional </p>
<p>assembly would be chosen either by full elections or some form of indirect elections. </p>
<p>FCO legal advice was that an interim Constitution would not be needed. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Sawers set out how a provisional government could be stood up in six months:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>October: CPA begins discussions with the GC about possible formation of </p>
<p>a Provisional Assembly, into which the GC and other institutions would be </p>
<p>subsumed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>15 December: GC reports to UN Security Council and sets out a preference </p>
<p>for a Provisional Assembly to last two years to allow time for drawing up a new </p>
<p>Constitution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>End January: UN Security Council agrees new resolution allowing the CPA three </p>
<p>months for orderly handover.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>April/May 2004: Provisional Assembly inaugurated. CPA comes to an end.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>April/May 2004 to April May 2005: new Constitution drafted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>April 2005: referendum on draft Constitution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Summer 2005: elections held, and internationally recognised Iraqi Government </p>
<p>formed. </p>
<p><b>489. </b> On 24 October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock supplied Mr Sawers with comments on his </p>
<p>proposals. He explained:</p>
<p>“I agree that it is unlikely that, during the course of 2004, we will obtain both a </p>
<p>permanent Constitution and the holding of credible elections. One or other is going </p>
<p>to have to give.”</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>490. </b> Sir Jeremy did not think it necessary to complete a permanent Constitution before </p>
<p>elections were held. Ambassador Bremer, however, felt that it was “the job of the </p>

<p>Coalition period to establish a Constitution for Iraq which will guarantee the values for </p>
<p>which the United States has gone to all this trouble”. </p>
<p><b>491. </b> Rather than argue with the US, Sir Jeremy’s preference was to see how </p>
<p>discussions with the GC went, as it was “much more satisfactory for the Americans </p>
<p>to change their views under the harsh light of the realities than under the importunate </p>
<p>arguments of the British”. But there was a certain amount of “seeding” the UK could do </p>
<p>to indicate to the Americans “the unwisdom of aiming too high in all this”. </p>
<p><b>492. </b> A major donor conference for Iraq was held in Madrid from 23 to 24 October and is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 10.1.</p>
<p><b>493. </b> On 24 October, Sir Jeremy told the FCO that Lt Gen Sanchez had ordered a: </p>
<p>“… comprehensive review of security to try to regain operational momentum … [He] </p>
<p>has come to recognise that Coalition operations are at a standstill and that there is </p>
<p>a need to regain momentum. The review focuses on two questions: is the direction </p>
<p>of the strategic and operational approach to Coalition objectives valid? Second, </p>
<p>what can CJTF-7 do to improve progress? The up-to-date military assessment is </p>
<p>that operations have now lost momentum, that rates of attrition of Foreign Fighters </p>
<p>and Former Regime Loyalists are outstripped by their ability to regenerate and that </p>
<p>Coalition responses are motivated less by strategic objectives than by the need to </p>
<p>react to unwelcome developments. It assesses that violent opposition is likely to </p>
<p>endure and that the key to success in the political process will be management of </p>
<p>the intensity of attacks.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>494. </b> Sir Jeremy judged that even at an early stage the review represented “a clear </p>
<p>move from stabilisation towards Counter-Insurgency operations” and notified the FCO </p>
<p>that in-depth discussions “of all this, and wider” chaired by Secretary Rumsfeld were to </p>
<p>be held in Washington at the end of the month. Both Ambassador Bremer and General </p>
<p>John Abizaid, Commander US Central Command (CENTCOM), were due to attend. </p>

<p><b>499. </b> Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry that he viewed this attack as a turning point:</p>
<p>“We were very, very clearly on an upward slope until then … We believed that the </p>
<p>CPA was getting better at what it was meant to do and we were all optimistic … </p>
<p>From [that point] onwards, then the graph just went sharply down.”</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>500. </b> On 30 October, Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that it had been agreed in </p>
<p>Washington that the Seven Step Plan should be maintained, but accelerated.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>At the same time, work would be undertaken to look for alternatives. </p>
<p><b>501. </b> At the end of October, Mr Sawers wrote to Mr Straw with a paper on the political </p>
<p>process in Iraq which described “ways of modifying the seven-point plan”.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>502. </b> The paper was based on the twin assumptions that Occupation must end in 2004 </p>
<p>and that a permanent Constitution and elections were not possible in that timescale. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> Mr Sawers proposed changing the UK’s objective to the creation of a provisional </p>
<p>government in 2004. It would be supported by a provisional assembly, which would be </p>
<p>indirectly elected “perhaps using electoral colleges based on the Governorates”. </p>
<p><b>504. </b> Since an end of Occupation would mean the end of the CPA the paper included </p>
<p>a proposal for a new international structure “on the Bosnian model with a high </p>
<p>representative appointed by the Coalition and having some reserved powers endorsed </p>
<p>by the Security Council”. </p>
<p><b>505. </b> In an annex to the paper Mr Sawers suggested that this new approach might </p>
<p>encourage more nations to participate in the military security effort in Iraq, since troops </p>
<p>would no longer be part of an Occupation and might be present in response to a request </p>
<p>from an Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>506. </b> US thinking appeared to be moving in a similar direction.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> By the end of October, </p>
<p>the British Embassy Washington reported that there was growing recognition in the US </p>
<p>Administration that Ambassador Bremer’s Seven Step Plan would not lead to credible </p>
<p>elections on the basis of a legitimate Constitution sufficiently quickly. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>508. </b> The NSC was reported by the British Embassy Washington to be leaning towards </p>
<p>the idea of a provisional government.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> No firm conclusion had been reached, but there </p>
<p>was “broad agreement on the need to transfer sovereignty to the Iraqis during 2004”. </p>
<p><b>November 2003</b></p>
<p><b>509. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“As time progressed, it became clear that … there was a genuine insurgency </p>
<p>developing. The influence of Muqtada al-Sadr was very great and, of course, it was </p>
<p>primarily north of our region, but it became clear to me in about November that an </p>
<p>infection was starting to spread south.”</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Gen Abizaid called on Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 4 November.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> Gen Abizaid said that </p>
<p>resistance was coalescing in the Sunni areas around former regime elements, backed </p>
<p>to some extent by foreign fighters and international terrorists. Gen Abizaid saw the </p>
<p>insurgency as “still at a low level” and lacking majority support even among the Sunnis.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Gen Abizaid’s solution was to accelerate Iraqiisation of the security forces  </p>
<p>whilst also improving their quality, a political ‘road map’ and a reconciliation process for </p>
<p>Sunni communities. </p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet on 6 November that “adjustments to the current plan were </p>
<p>needed” in relation to the political process.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p> He would pursue discussions in the US the </p>
<p>following week, but it would be an “iterative process” involving the GC. </p>
<p><b>513. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference on 6 November, he </p>
<p>commented that the question was “how quickly could we move to elections”.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Mr Blair thought the quicker the better, “but both the Iraqis and we needed to be able </p>
<p>to handle it”.</p>
<p><b>514. </b> Mr Blair commented that “with progress on infrastructure etc, we were now down </p>
<p>to a specific problem of how to deal with a small group of terrorists”. They wanted to </p>
<p>provoke a reaction, so that the security presence became heavier and the population </p>
<p>turned against the Coalition. Mr Blair suggested that some Sunnis were “desperate to </p>
<p>be on our side” and that infrastructure projects that would benefit the Sunni community </p>
<p>should be completed. He commented that:</p>
<p>“A stable, prosperous Iraq would send a powerful signal to the region. That was why </p>
<p>the extremists were desperate to stop us, and why we had to succeed.” </p>

<p>the failure of the GC to “get a grip” and “develop a political profile”; and</p>

<p>with little hard intelligence. As Jeremy Greenstock puts it, the enemy is mutating </p>
<p>faster than our (rapidly evolving) security structures can keep up … There is no </p>
<p>lack of intelligence; but it’s not having a decisive impact, and there are problems of </p>
<p>processing and co-ordination.”</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Sir Nigel continued:</p>
<p>“We have to put our faith in a combination of (a) Iraqiisation and (b) better </p>
<p>intelligence leading to more pre-emption of attacks. On the first, there is now an </p>
<p>ambitious scheme for all parts of the security structure. But ICDC [Iraqi Civil Defence </p>
<p>Corps] training will not be complete until the spring; and even then trainees will need </p>
<p>mentoring and monitoring … There is a bad need for Iraqi police on the streets to </p>

<p>“… [Lt Gen] Sanchez is planning an operation in Fallujah – the tribal chiefs have </p>

<p>particularly on security, for a wholesale transfer to a provisional government.”</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Instead, he and Sir Jeremy Greenstock set out an alternative political timetable </p>

<p>“… political, social and economic landmarks were swept away by the dictatorship. </p>
<p>Our position rests largely on intangible Iraqi perceptions of credibility and consent. </p>
<p>Most Iraqis are at best confused: they don’t want Saddam back, but want the </p>
<p>Occupation to end.” </p>
<p><b>527. </b> Mr Blair commented against that text “Is this right?”</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Sir Nigel continued:</p>
<p>“This is an immense task: we have, at last, the right policies in place; but there is a </p>
<p>sense of a race against time, with Iraqiisation benefits not able to kick in properly </p>
<p>until the spring, and continuing doubt about the CPA’s ability to get the practical </p>
<p>jobs done.”</p>
<p><b>529. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the key GC members were dismissive of </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer’s time constraints, arguing that direct elections to a Constitutional </p>

<p> He believed it was still possible for this to be done by </p>

<p><b>537. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 13 November that President Bush would visit the UK the </p>
<p>following week, and that it was important for policy issues, including Iraq, to be the focus </p>
<p>of the visit.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> Mr Blair judged that:</p>
<p>“While we should not expect that the visit would be universally acclaimed here, we </p>
<p>should take political advantage by entering into debate on the issues.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> On 13 November, Sir Nigel reported a telephone conversation with Dr Rice in </p>
<p>which she indicated that President Bush had agreed on a new sequence for the political </p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> This was:</p>
<p>“… basic law; interim Parliament; provisional Government; transfer of sovereignty </p>
<p>and end of the CPA.”</p>
<p><b>539. </b> There was no firm plan for what would replace the CPA. The US envisaged </p>
<p>elections by mid-June and the provisional Government in place in July, followed by the </p>
<p>handover of power. Ambassador Bremer would put this new proposal to the GC. </p>
<p><b>540. </b> During his visit to Washington, on 13 November Mr Straw discussed Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer’s revised proposals for the political process with Secretary Powell.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>541. </b> Secretary Powell explained that Ambassador Bremer had proposed a target of </p>
<p>June/July for the transfer of sovereignty. Sir Jeremy Greenstock suggested that the new </p>
<p>timetable meant that instead of popular elections to a transitional assembly, a caucus </p>
<p>process would be needed. </p>
<p><b>542. </b> Mr Straw indicated “probable UK approval” of the new timetable.</p>
<p><b>543. </b> On 14 November, Mr Crompton wrote to Mr Richmond on the Constitutional </p>

<p>300</p>
<p> He indicated general pleasure with US plans. For the selection of the </p>
<p>“Transitional Legislative Assembly” he favoured:</p>
<p>“… a national conference of notables from all the Governorates to launch the </p>
<p>process, and a further round of consultations at the end to debate, amend and, </p>
<p>we hope, endorse the fundamental law.”</p>

<p><b>545. </b> To remedy this he suggested “slippage of the timetable into 2005”. </p>

<p>This became known as the 15 November Agreement. </p>
<p><b>547. </b> The process involved creating an interim Constitution, known as the Transitional </p>
<p>Administrative Law (TAL) or Fundamental Law, a Transitional National Assembly (TNA) </p>
<p>that would be chosen by provincial caucuses, and an Interim Government to be chosen </p>
<p>by the TNA. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>Origins of the 15 November Agreement</b></p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock described to the Inquiry the stalemate the Coalition had faced </p>
<p>on the political process.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> Ambassador Bremer had not wanted elections to take place </p>
<p>without constitutional principles being laid down to govern them; Grand Ayatollah al-</p>
<p>Sistani had not wanted Iraq’s Constitution to be written by or influenced by non-Iraqis. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy described his suggestion that:</p>
<p>“… when there was a chicken and egg problem, one of the ways to get through it is </p>
<p>to design a double circuit … two chickens, two eggs, it became known as, with some </p>
<p>humour and disbelief on the American side … we designed a process of drawing up </p>
<p>some preliminary constitutional principles through an administrative law leading to a </p>
<p>first round of elections, after which there would be the writing of a proper Constitution </p>
<p>by elected officials, leading to a second round of elections under that Constitution. </p>
<p>“The Americans … thought I was talking rubbish, but the Iraqis immediately </p>
<p>understood what I was talking about, which was the point of my proposing it … And </p>
<p>that was the heart of the 15 November agreement.”</p>
<p>Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly Jeremy’s influence was very important in the change of direction of </p>
<p>the political process which led to the 15th November agreement. It is a dreadful </p>
<p>phrase [two chickens two eggs], but actually it was a very clever idea and became in </p>
<p>essence the policy that was then followed.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p>Sir David said that Ambassador Bremer’s Seven Step Plan:</p>
<p>“… had really come unstuck. It wasn’t a bad plan at all. It was almost a classic way of </p>
<p>going about these things, but it had come unstuck largely because of the opposition </p>
<p>of Sistani to certain aspects of that plan. Although we were … perhaps slow to realise </p>
<p>that they had hit an insurmountable obstacle and there was a lot of time lost, certainly </p>
<p>by the middle or end of October there was a realisation that we were going to have to </p>
<p>come up with a plan B …” </p>
<p>“A plan was being developed and Bremer went back to Washington around about </p>
<p>13th or 12th November … He came back with what became the 15th November </p>
<p>agreement. There were certain aspects of it which we were expecting, including the </p>
<p>idea that there might be some interim Constitution … We were certainly expecting an </p>
<p>end date, although I think we were expecting one a little later than 30th June, but I </p>
<p>think we – certainly I was expecting that there would be elections before we handed </p>
<p>over. We would handover to an elected interim government. It was a surprise and </p>
<p>shock to me to discover when Bremer came back from Washington that this was not </p>
<p>the case. Now I don’t know – this decision had clearly been taken in Washington by </p>
<p>the people in Washington. It was not what the CPA had been expecting. I don’t know </p>
<p>to what extent the British Government was involved in that decision to do things in a </p>
<p>different way. I imagine they were, but I don’t know.”</p>

<p>297</p>
<p><b>550. </b> On 18 November, Sir Jeremy Greenstock attended a meeting of the Iraq Strategy </p>
<p>Group, chaired by Sir Nigel Sheinwald.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>551. </b> Among the “main private messages” that Sir Jeremy believed that Mr Blair should </p>
<p>raise with President Bush was the need for a “comprehensive and fully integrated </p>
<p>approach [to security] including improved intelligence co-ordination, greater Iraqiisation </p>
<p>of security forces, bringing in more ex-Ba’athists and political outreach to the Sunnis”.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> On 19 November, in a review of Al Qaida’s global operations, the JIC reported:</p>
<p>“There have been some indications of senior Al Qaida leaders … aspiring to play </p>
<p>a role in Iraq and enabling others to do so. The ‘Iraq jihad’ has been a focus for </p>
<p>recent Al Qaida propaganda. We do not know for certain how much direct influence </p>
<p>Al Qaida leaders have over activity, or how far ‘core’ Al Qaida terrorists have been </p>
<p>involved in operations there. But groups affiliated with it (such as Ansar al Islam </p>
<p>and al-Zarqawi’s network) are planning and carrying out operations and may </p>
<p>have been responsible for some of the major attacks. The Iraq jihad is also likely </p>
<p>to produce a new generation of battle hardened fighters prepared to use their </p>
<p>expertise elsewhere.”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>553. </b> In mid-November, the Defence Intelligence Service (DIS) created an Iraq Security </p>
<p>Task Force to increase its analytical effort “into the nature of the insurgency in Iraq”.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The group was intended to work closely with PJHQ and the intelligence agencies to </p>
<p>“identify the insurgents and their organisation, strategy, tactics, methods and logistics”. </p>
<p><b>554. </b> Lt Gen Andrew Ridgway, the Chief of Defence Intelligence, cautioned that:</p>
<p>“… this effort does not come without a price. I will be forced to reduce effort </p>
<p>elsewhere … Assessment of non-insurgent related activity in Iraq will be reduced </p>
<p>in the short term as Gulf branch is back-filled with analysts less familiar with </p>
<p>the region.”</p>
<p><b>555. </b> On 20 November, Mr Blair and President Bush made a joint statement in which </p>
<p>they said:</p>
<p>“We reaffirm the resolve of our two countries, with many friends and allies, to </p>
<p>complete the process of bringing freedom, security and peace to Iraq. We warmly </p>
<p>welcome the Iraqi Governing Council’s announcement of a timetable for the creation </p>
<p>of a sovereign Iraqi Transitional Administration by the end of June 2004 …”</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>556. </b> The statement went on to say that the GC’s announcement was consistent with </p>

<p><b>557. </b> In late 2003, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff made an informal request for the UK to </p>
<p>consider deploying the HQ ARRC to Afghanistan in summer 2004.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> At the time, the </p>
<p>FCO’s advice to Mr Straw was that the MOD did “not believe that it would be sensible to </p>
<p>deploy the ARRC to Afghanistan under current levels of operational deployment, since </p>
<p>they judge that it would need to deploy for a year, and with around 2,500 additional </p>
<p>troops, to have the desired strategic effect”. </p>
<p><b>558. </b> The initial view of the FCO’s Afghanistan Unit was that this underplayed the </p>
<p>potential strategic value of the ARRC in Afghanistan. In relation to a deployment to Iraq, </p>
<p>the Unit judged it:</p>
<p>“… unlikely … that NATO would be willing to take on the overall command role. Nor </p>
<p>is it clear that the US would be prepared to put their forces under UK command. </p>
<p>Conversely, there is a risk, were the ARRC to deploy at the head of a multi-national </p>
<p>operation, that the US would not retain enough forces in theatre to make sure that </p>
<p>the security situation could be properly handled … The political risk to the UK of a </p>
<p>British HQ taking overall command of military operations would also be high, and our </p>
<p>chance of success will be no better (or worse) than the Americans. We are unlikely </p>
<p>to want to be put in such an exposed position for another two years.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>560. </b> Mr Oakden wrote: </p>
<p>“… there is a large element of tactics in the MOD’s current approach … there has </p>
<p>been a strong body of opinion, including the CGS, that since there is no attractive </p>
<p>prospect of using the ARRC in Iraq, we should use it … in Afghanistan, both to do </p>
<p>the real job that needs doing on the ground there, and because that is the way to </p>
<p>maintain UK leadership in NATO.”</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>561. </b> Mr Oakden wrote that in order to make an effective deployment of the ARRC “you </p>
<p>would also need to deploy a 2,500 strong manoeuvre battalion</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> for the ARRC to have </p>
<p>strategic effect”. He also noted that Sir Kevin Tebbit had:</p>
<p>“… insisted that with the MOD facing a massive overrun, they could not put </p>
<p>themselves in the position with HMT of arguing for additional commitments: they </p>
<p>should let others impose this on them; and let these others, No.10 or whomever, </p>

<p>and that the Central Criminal Court was now up and running; 600 Iraqi judges were now </p>
<p>presiding over 500 Iraqi courts.</p>
<p><b>568. </b> UKMIS New York told the FCO that:</p>
<p>“While generally welcomed, France, Germany and Russia stress three key </p>
<p>considerations: the need to bring in those previously excluded; the need to bring on </p>
<p>board Iraq’s neighbours; and the need for a substantive UN role. All three mention </p>
<p>the idea of a national conference under UN auspices.”</p>
<p><b>569. </b> On 21 November, the Oil-for-Food programme closed, after eight years in </p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> This met the terms of resolution 1483, which had called for it to be wound </p>
<p>up within six months. </p>
<p><b>570. </b> Responsibility for remaining activity passed to the CPA and the Iraqi Ministry of </p>
<p>Trade. A one month “buffer stock” of key commodities would be purchased by the World </p>
<p>Food Programme, but it was not expected that there would be a threat to food supply.</p>
<p><b>571. </b> From 18 to 22 November President Bush visited the UK.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>572. </b> Before the visit, Mr Rycroft gave Mr Blair a copy of a paper entitled ‘Iraq: Security’, </p>
<p>for discussion with President Bush.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> The document was described as “Jeremy’s paper” </p>
<p>and the Inquiry assumes that it was written by Sir Jeremy Greenstock. </p>
<p><b>573. </b> The paper began:</p>
<p>“The timetable for transfer of power to transitional government is challenging but can </p>
<p>be done. Momentum is there. One thing that can throw this off course is <b>security</b>. </p>
<p>Must be our highest priority from now until the handover. Current insurgency/terrorist </p>
<p>campaign may not pose a traditional strategic threat. But mounting rates of attacks </p>
<p>on Coalition will:</p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>encourage the current insurgency to become a widespread, popular </p>

<p>“<b>Military</b> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… We need to do more to tackle use of IEDs; mortar and rocket attacks; and </p>
<p>SAMs [Surface-to-Air Missiles]. <i>We should seek to avoid further alienation of </i></p>
<p><i>Sunni population.</i> Overall approach needs to provide reassurance.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><b>Intelligence </b></p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>Sunni strategy </b></p>
<p><i>• </i></p>
<p><i>Sunni outreach remains critical even while pursuing crackdown on FRE </i>[Former </p>

<p>projects must be a priority. And we must help the IGC to sell the new political </p>
<p>process in the Sunni heartlands.</p>
<p><b>Civilian security </b></p>
<p><i>• </i></p>
<p><i>Real risk of serious US and UK civilian losses. </i>When civilian volunteers begin </p>
<p>to be hit the consequences are different to those for the military. Resulting </p>
<p>mass pull-outs will undermine our ability to ensure an effective handover of </p>
<p>responsibility to Iraqis. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>…</p>

<p><b>575. </b> Mr Blair gave President Bush a slightly revised version of Sir Jeremy’s paper, </p>
<p>which included a different message under the heading “Managing the transition/</p>

<p>322</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“We need to look again at the levels and composition of US and UK troops, </p>

<p><b>576. </b> In the week before President Bush’s visit, Sir Jeremy contacted Mr Desmond </p>
<p>Bowen, the Deputy Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, </p>

<p>303</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald recorded that Mr Blair and President Bush spent most of their </p>
<p>private meeting on 19 November discussing Iraq, drawing on Sir Jeremy’s paper, a copy </p>
<p>of which Sir Nigel had also given to Dr Rice.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p><b>578. </b> At the end of the visit, Sir Nigel met Dr Rice to discuss follow-up.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p> During the </p>
<p>discussion Dr Rice emphasised the need to “crush the insurgency hard”, mainly through </p>
<p>better intelligence.</p>
<p><b>579. </b> Politically, the GC had to work better, for which the Sunnis would be key. There </p>
<p>was also a need to prioritise reconstruction projects. There was discussion about </p>
<p>reuniting the international community, and Iraq’s neighbours. </p>
<p><b>580. </b> Sir Nigel saw three elements to the post-CPA civilian arrangements: an </p>
<p>international presence under some kind of UN umbrella; UK/US advisers inside the Iraqi </p>
<p>ministries; and UK/US Missions or Embassies. Sir Nigel raised the question of contracts: </p>
<p>the UK had done well in the first tranche and “hoped that DOD [Department of Defense] </p>
<p>would give us a good crack of the whip in the oil and gas area, where three UK consortia </p>
<p>had real expertise”.</p>
<p><b>581. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the approach set out in Sir Jeremy’s paper </p>
<p>once again when they met at Sedgefield at the end of the visit.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> The meeting was a </p>
<p>private one, but Sir David Manning reported that Mr Blair had interpreted the response </p>
<p>as positive, and had stressed the importance of “effective follow-up”. </p>
<p><b>582. </b> Soon after the announcement of the 15 November Agreement, reservations began </p>
<p>to be expressed in the GC, in particular by Shia members, about its implementation. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> Concerns raised at a meeting of the nine members of the GC’s rotating </p>
<p>Presidency (the P9) on 21 November focused on the method of selecting provincial </p>
<p>caucuses, the fate of the GC post-transition, a desire to protect the position of the </p>
<p>Shia majority, a continued Coalition military presence and the lack of clarity on  </p>
<p>the UN’s role.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>584. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador Bremer had stressed the historic importance </p>
<p>of the 15 November Agreement, and the commitment of Mr Blair and President Bush </p>
<p>to it. Despite that, he was “willing to negotiate further some details”. </p>
<p><b>585. </b> Despite the problems raised, Sir Jeremy commented that they did not appear </p>
<p>“insurmountable” and no member of the GC seemed close to abandoning the </p>
<p>Agreement altogether. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>586. </b> A committee established by the P9 proposed five textual amendments on </p>
<p>23 November, including:</p>
<p>“… reforming the local and provincial councils, thereby ensuring ‘the highest possible </p>
<p>degree of representation’; ensuring that security arrangements reaffirmed the </p>
<p>sovereignty and independence of Iraq; asking the UN Secretary-General to appoint </p>
<p>a representative to help in the political process; and defining a role for the IGC </p>
<p>post-hand over and until a permanent Constitution is adopted.”</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>587. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he and Ambassador Bremer would “remain firm on key </p>
<p>principles”.</p>
<p><b>588. </b> On 26 November, the JIC assessed security in Iraq.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> It judged that the number </p>
<p>of “significant incidents” had risen from 30 to 36 per day, though the frequency of </p>
<p>significant attacks in MND(SE) had not increased and remained lower than in other </p>
<p>parts of the country. </p>
<p><b>589. </b> The JIC assessed that this was the result of increased involvement of “former </p>
<p>regime elements” who had moved into MND(SE) from elsewhere:</p>
<p>“It does not, therefore, necessarily indicate a loss of local Shia support (there are </p>
<p>some indications that this support may actually be increasing in MND(SE)).”</p>
<p><b>590. </b> In addition to the ongoing threat from former regime elements, the JIC pointed </p>
<p>to the threat to stability that came from “disaffected Iraqis – those without jobs, those </p>
<p>who have been disadvantaged by the change in regime, or those who simply find the </p>
<p>conditions of life worse than before the war”. It also assessed that, while Muqtada al </p>
<p>Sadr’s supporters had “dwindled”, he still commanded “sufficient influence to be a threat, </p>
<p>particularly in Najaf, Karbala and Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>591. </b> The Cabinet Office Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR meeting the following day </p>
<p>observed that:</p>
<p>“Although the number of security incidents has fallen in the last few days, it is too </p>
<p>soon to say that this represents a trend to improved security.”</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>592. </b> The same document also recorded that Mr Jalal Talabani, President of the GC, had </p>
<p>written to Mr Annan asking him to appoint a new UN Special Representative. A second </p>
<p>letter set out the political timetable and asked the Security Council for a new resolution. </p>
<p>Cabinet Office officials stated:</p>
<p>“The question of what future UNSCRs will be required to underpin the timetable is a </p>
<p>matter for debate.”</p>

<p>305</p>
<p><b>593. </b> On 27 November, Mr Straw told Cabinet that during his visit to Iraq he had </p>
<p>been struck that the change to the political timetable had had a dramatic impact on </p>
<p>the CPA and the GC, “New urgency had been imparted to both the political and </p>
<p>security tracks.”</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>594. </b> On 27 November, Mr Sawers commented to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that:</p>
<p>“… the ARRC is a high quality asset which, in these times of heavy demands on </p>
<p>the security front, we should be looking to deploy … Holding it back for the perfect </p>
<p>task risks leaving it with nothing to do for far too long. The question is: Iraq or </p>
<p>Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>595. </b> Mr Sawers went on to observe that “Iraq is the higher political priority for HMG”, but </p>
<p>that there was a risk that deploying the ARRC to Iraq would either create complications </p>
<p>with US troops and a dual chain of command or encourage the US to withdraw its troops </p>
<p>prematurely. By contrast, Afghanistan was seen as a more immediate priority. Mr Sawers </p>
<p>concluded that he inclined towards recommending the deployment of the ARRC to Iraq – </p>
<p>the “greater strategic and political importance of the Iraq to the UK tips the balance”. </p>
<p>Mr Sawers recommended that, as the forthcoming NATO Summit at Istanbul coincided </p>
<p>with the planned transfer of sovereignty in Iraq, it might be an opportune moment to </p>
<p>announce any decision to deploy the ARRC to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Impact of the political timetable on the CPA</b></p>
<p>Since May 2003, the CPA had been operating on the assumption that it would be </p>
<p>responsible for the administration and reconstruction of Iraq until at least December 2004. </p>
<p>CPA programmes and spending plans had been based on that assumption. </p>
<p>Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Once you know that your tenure is only going to be six months, even the most naïve </p>
<p>planners knew that the objectives they had set were not going to be achieved within </p>
<p>that period.”</p>
<p>333</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry that the idea of an early transfer to a transitional Iraqi </p>
<p>government came as a surprise to him: </p>
<p>“In the middle of November, much to our surprise, and in many – well, in some </p>
<p>senses disappointment, it was decided that the CPA should wind up at the end of </p>
<p>June, and I was due to leave – the six months would have been the end of January. It </p>
<p>became clear to me a couple of months before that that the entire focus of Baghdad’s </p>
<p>attention had shifted from trying to make something work into, ‘What are we going to </p>
<p>do to run down?’”</p>
<p>334 </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>596. </b> Towards the end of November, Mr Richmond wrote to Mr Crompton to look ahead </p>
<p>at key issues for the seven months until the CPA came to an end in June 2004.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He listed:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-select Provincial Councils in a number of governorates;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>help draft the Transitional Administrative Law;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>organise the caucus elections and build up civil/political society;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>launch a nationwide political dialogue;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keep a suspicious Shia majority on side while reassuring a resentful and angry </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>avoid dealing with the security problems in ways which alienate the local </p>
<p>population and establish a coherent security strategy to deal with the </p>
<p>insurgency;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decide on the post handover arrangements for the Multi-National forces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prioritise the outstanding economic issues …”</p>
<p><b>597. </b> He identified the most difficult issue in drafting the TAL as federalism, and in </p>
<p>particular the status of the Kurdish north. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> Mr Hoon told Parliament on 27 November that:</p>
<p>“As part of our routine management of the UK’s land deployment we intend shortly </p>
<p>to conduct a roulement of our forces in theatre. This will begin with an incremental </p>
<p>replacement of HQ 3 (UK) Division with a composite headquarters for MND(SE), the </p>
<p>staff for which will be drawn from across UK Defence and from allies … We expect </p>
<p>the level of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force presence in theatre to remain broadly </p>
<p>stable … We will continue to keep the size and mix of forces in theatre under careful </p>
<p>review and we can expect to make further adjustments to our force structures … </p>
<p>“While we remain determined to maintain appropriate forces deployed in Iraq and </p>
<p>the wider Gulf region for as long as is necessary, we are equally determined that no </p>
<p>forces should remain deployed for any longer than is necessary.”</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>599. </b> The exact total of deployed troops was not mentioned in Mr Hoon’s statement </p>
<p>to Parliament.</p>
<p><b>600. </b> On 27 November, Cabinet Office officials briefed the AHMGIR that “[Grand] </p>
<p>Ayatollah [al-]Sistani, the senior and influential Shia cleric, is said still to have doubts </p>

<p>307</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Shortly afterwards, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that:</p>
<p>“Efforts by the CPA to resolve the impasse … over the 15 November Agreement </p>
<p>were further complicated on 27 November by reports to the CPA governance team </p>
<p>that [Grand] Ayatollah [al-]Sistani has come out in favour of direct elections to the </p>
<p>TLA [Transitional Legislative Assembly].”</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>602. </b> In a statement on 28 November, Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani set out his </p>
<p>“reservations” regarding the 15 November Agreement:</p>
<p>“Firstly, it is based on preparing the law of the Iraqi state, for the transitional period, </p>
<p>through the Governing Council in conjunction with the Occupying Power – thus not </p>
<p>providing it with legitimacy. For this (legitimacy) to be achieved it must be presented </p>
<p>to representatives of the Iraqi people for approval. </p>
<p>“Secondly, the mechanism in place to choose members of the Transitional </p>
<p>Legislative Assembly does not guarantee the establishment of an assembly that truly </p>
<p>represents the Iraqi people. Therefore this mechanism must be replaced with one </p>
<p>that guarantees the aforesaid, which is ‘elections’, so the Assembly will emanate </p>
<p>from the desire of the Iraqi people and will represent them fairly without its legitimacy </p>
<p>being tarnished in any way.”</p>
<p>339</p>
<p><b>December 2003</b></p>
<p><b>603. </b> By 1 December, the GC had not agreed a way ahead in relation to Grand Ayatollah </p>
<p>al-Sistani’s objections beyond creating a committee to discuss the mechanics of </p>
<p>implementation.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>604. </b> In early December, the Iraq Senior Officials Group concluded that “a new joined </p>

<p><b>605. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 4 December.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> During </p>
<p>the conversation Mr Blair underlined the importance of Iraqiisation, including involving </p>
<p>the Sunni community and former Ba’athists. He suggested that the Coalition should </p>
<p>aim to mobilise tribal leadership, as the UK was doing in the South. Mr Blair welcomed </p>
<p>“improvements in co-ordination” and stressed that the focus should be on security. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>606. </b> A Force Level Review conducted in November and given to the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>in December noted that the military tasks for the period ahead fell into two categories: </p>
<p>counter-terrorism and security sector reform, most critically the Iraqi Police Service </p>
<p>(IPS), the Border Police (IBP) and the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC): </p>
<p>“Existing MND(SE) resources are insufficient to maintain security, in the event of </p>
<p>politically inspired instability, and simultaneously train, mentor and monitor both the </p>
<p>ICDC and the IPS/IPB. In order to achieve the necessary force levels an adjustment </p>
<p>of in-place forces coupled with a moderate increase in force levels is needed. This </p>
<p>should ensure concurrent CT [counter-terrorism] and SSR [security sector reform] </p>
<p>success. Also by achieving early effect, MND(SE) should create the conditions for </p>
<p>release of UK troops or their re-employment within Iraq.”</p>

<p><b>607. </b> On counter-terrorism, the review found that:</p>
<p>“… tasks have been reviewed and we will soon be able to reduce from four to three </p>
<p>battalions for this commitment. The released battalion will be used for the mentoring </p>
<p>and monitoring of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF).”</p>
<p><b>608. </b> The Force Level Review recommended:</p>
<p>“… the continued deployment of a surge battalion … until Jun 04. The deployment </p>
<p>of an additional battalion … to provide in-theatre flexibility … [and] a further two </p>
<p>platoons of RMP [Royal Military Police], until a request for 40 civilian police is </p>

<p> </p>
<p>A paper written by Lt Gen Fry in early December suggested that:</p>

<p>campaign success.” </p>
<p><b>610. </b> On resources, he advised that: </p>
<p>“The UK’s strategy must be one of ‘early effect’, which puts the achievement of </p>

<p><b>611. </b> A more detailed paper attached noted that the numbers of Army units deployed </p>
<p>in operations (including Iraq) was greater than envisaged in the Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions (DPAs).</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> As a result:</p>
<p>“If the MOD seeks to return within DPAs then drawdown must be sought from … </p>
<p>other theatres, reflecting TELIC’s position as the UK’s military ME [Main Effort]. As </p>
<p>the Coalition scale of effort reduces in Iraq the UK faces a choice: either UK military </p>
<p>scale of effort decreases in step with the Coalition, or, UK military effort continues </p>
<p>at MS [Medium Scale], proportionally increasing our contribution to the Coalition. </p>
<p>The UK would therefore have greater ownership of the campaign and greater </p>
<p>influence on its success. In this scenario, UK military deployment may not be </p>
<p>limited to MND(SE).”</p>
<p><b>612. </b> On 10 December, Sir Nigel Sheinwald chaired a video conference with Dr Rice  </p>
<p>and members of her team, including Ambassador Blackwill (who led in Washington on </p>
<p>the Iraqi political process).</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> Ambassador Blackwill suggested that Grand Ayatollah  </p>
<p>al-Sistani’s stance seemed to be softening on direct elections, but the lack of a direct  </p>
<p>line of communication made this uncertain. </p>
<p><b>613. </b> A day later, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported to Mr Rycroft that there had </p>
<p>been little progress with the new political timetable, mainly because Grand Ayatollah </p>
<p>al-Sistani had argued that members of the Transitional Legislative Assembly should </p>
<p>be selected by direct election, rather than through the caucus elections outlined in </p>
<p>the agreement.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>614. </b> The Private Secretary added that Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani’s intervention had </p>
<p>met strong opposition from most members of the GC and the CPA. No GC member </p>
<p>was at that point pushing for direct elections but they were advocating changes in the </p>
<p>way the caucus elections were organised, to ensure that Ba’athists did not re-emerge </p>
<p>as a political force. They were trying to sell this approach to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani. </p>
<p>The CPA was prepared to be flexible on the implementation of the agreement,  </p>
<p>but not the principles. </p>

<p>“With the arrest of Saddam Hussein, there is a new opportunity for the members of </p>
<p>the former regime to end their bitter opposition.” </p>
<p><b>617. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by telephone on 14 December and encouraged </p>

<p> The tone should be focused on reconciliation. </p>
<p><b>618. </b> During Defence Questions on 15 December, Mr Hoon told Parliament that:</p>
<p>“A crucial component of our efforts in Iraq is the training of Iraqi security forces. </p>
<p>That has been given added impetus by the acceleration of the political timetable </p>
<p>agreed by the Iraqi Governing Council on 15 November. To accelerate the rate of </p>
<p>training, there is a requirement for an additional infantry battalion and a contingent </p>
<p>of Royal Military Police. The House will recall that I have previously announced </p>
<p>the earmarking of a ready battalion for deployment on surge operations for that </p>
<p>reason. I have decided that that battalion, the 1st Battalion the Argyll and Sutherland </p>
<p>Highlanders, and two platoons of Royal Military Police, drawn from 101 and 156 </p>
<p>provost companies should deploy in January for six months.”</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>619. </b> Briefing produced for Mr Hoon suggested the following line: </p>
<p>“Of course we would welcome additional contributions to the Multi-National effort </p>
<p>in Iraq. But we can sustain our current force levels, and indeed temporary ‘surges’ </p>
<p>such as the additional deployments I am announcing today. Our approach to Iraq is </p>
<p>not driven by any sort of arbitrary targets for reducing our force levels there.”</p>

<p>favoured a general election (rather than the planned caucus approach) to select </p>
<p>the transitional National Assembly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The destabilising effect of Muqtada al-Sadr, who was considered “unlikely to </p>
<p>accept a transition process that does not facilitate a prominent role for himself </p>
<p>and for the Shia. The Assessments Staff assessed that al-Sadr’s militia – the </p>
<p>“Mahdi Army” – was poorly trained and organised, and the reported numbers </p>
<p>(between 6,000 and 8,000) “may well be exaggerated”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Continued Sunni disaffection, though the arrest of Saddam Hussein – while </p>
<p>likely to have a demoralising effect on some former regime elements – was </p>
<p>considered likely to encourage more of the Sunni to feel that they could </p>
<p>participate in the transition process without fear that the Saddam regime </p>
<p>would return.</p>
<p><b>622. </b> On Iran, Mr Dowse’s note reported:</p>
<p>“Iran wishes to promote Islam within Iraq, but no longer expects to see a mirror </p>
<p>image of its own government in place. A successful Islamic democracy on its border </p>
<p>is likely to fuel discontent among its own population and this will probably be a </p>
<p>cause for concern in Tehran. It will, however, continue its support to SCIRI with the </p>
<p>aim of securing Shia pre-eminence in the future political hierarchy. Passive support </p>
<p>for groups such as Ansar al-Islam is also likely to continue as long as the Coalition </p>
<p>remains in Iraq, but [we] stand by our judgement … that while Iran may seek to gain </p>
<p>influence … it is unlikely that they would participate directly in anti-Coalition activity.”</p>
<p><b>623. </b> On 17 December, the JIC assessed security in Iraq.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> It recorded that: </p>
<p>“After a difficult November the number of attacks against Coalition Forces has </p>
<p>fallen … Most attacks continue to take place in Baghdad and in the Sunni Arab </p>
<p>areas to the north and west. </p>
<p>“The UK area of responsibility is calmer.”</p>
<p><b>624. </b> The JIC judged that most attacks against the Coalition continued to be carried out </p>
<p>by Former Regime Elements. </p>
<p><b>625. </b> The capture of Saddam Hussein, in the JIC’s opinion: </p>
<p>“… removes a figurehead, and will at least damage the morale of his supporters </p>
<p>and offer encouragement to those many Iraqis who feared he could return. Coalition </p>
<p>policies will need to take advantage of this opportunity.”</p>
<p><b>626. </b> The JIC also judged that:</p>
<p>“Although we continue to see reports of alleged AQ personnel operating in Iraq and </p>
<p>support networks elsewhere, we have no evidence linking AQ to specific attacks.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>627. </b> The Cabinet Office Annotated Agenda for the meeting of the AHMGIR on </p>
<p>18 December noted that:</p>
<p>“The capture of Saddam Hussein, though important politically, is unlikely to improve </p>
<p>the security situation in the short-term. Saddam’s supporters may not give up easily </p>
<p>and foreign fighters have different motivations.”</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Despite the recent fall in the number of security incidents, the agenda noted that </p>
<p>“attacks on Iraqi security forces, particularly on police stations, continue” although </p>
<p>MND(SE) remained relatively quiet.</p>
<p><b>629. </b> The Annotated Agenda recorded that the CPA was taking forward ideas for a </p>
<p>National Reconciliation Strategy.</p>
<p><b>630. </b> Following the capture of Saddam, this was:</p>
<p>“… a determined effort by the CPA and the Iraqi Interim Administration to engage </p>
<p>Sunni leaders, alongside establishment of targeted job creation schemes and more </p>
<p>flexible implementation of the de-Ba’athification policy.”</p>
<p><b>631. </b> Responsibility for de-Ba’athification had been formally handed to the Governing </p>
<p>Council on 5 November in CPA Memorandum No.7 (see Section 11.1 for further details). </p>
<p><b>632. </b> Cabinet Office officials wrote that an impediment to Iraqi engagement in the </p>
<p>15 November Agreement was the further intervention of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani. </p>
<p>He had made clear his preference for the holding of direct elections rather than caucus </p>
<p>elections to the Transitional Assembly, although he had not gone so far as to issue a </p>
<p>fatwa<i>. </i>Instead, he<i> </i>had asked for UN views on the feasibility of direct elections. </p>
<p><b>633. </b> The Cabinet Office judged that the Iraqiisation of security was “highly ambitious” </p>
<p>based on the intention to withdraw Coalition military from cities, and for the Iraqi police to </p>
<p>deal with terrorism, by April 2004. </p>
<p><b>634. </b> The Annotated Agenda also discussed the role of women in Iraq, observing that </p>
<p>all 10 members of the committee that would draft the TAL were male. Cabinet Office </p>
<p>officials proposed that Ministers should agree to lobby Washington and the CPA for a </p>
<p>quota of 25 percent female representation in every caucus nominating individuals to the </p>
<p>TLA. The Agenda said that Iraqi women accounted for 60 percent of the total population. </p>
<p><b>635. </b> Ministers were also told that Mr Annan had appointed Mr Ross Mountain to be his </p>
<p>Acting Special Representative to Iraq. He would be based outside Iraq, travelling in as </p>
<p>security permitted. </p>

<p><b>636. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 18 December that the capture of Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>should enable more progress to be made in Iraq as it meant there was no focal point </p>
<p>for opposition.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>637. </b> Reflecting on events in a telephone conversation with President Bush on the same </p>
<p>day, Mr Blair said that he saw the capture of Saddam Hussein as “not the end, but the </p>
<p>beginning of the end”.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>638. </b> Also on 18 December, Ambassador Bremer hosted a Campaign Review </p>
<p>meeting in Baghdad – the first US/UK meeting to review strategy on Iraq – attended by </p>
<p>senior civilian and military representatives, including Lt Gen Fry, Mr Webb and </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>639. </b> Gen Abizaid was reported to have commented on the importance of withdrawing </p>
<p>as soon as it was possible once the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps and Iraqi police were in a </p>
<p>position to assume control. In his view “many areas of MND(SE) were ‘almost there’”. </p>
<p><b>640. </b> Lt Gen Fry observed that it was:</p>
<p>“… important for the Coalition to think strategically about deployment of resources. </p>
<p>For example the UK might consider re-deploying some personnel and assets away </p>
<p>from MND(SE) into either another geographical area or a function such as training.”</p>
<p><b>641. </b> The record of this meeting is the first time the Inquiry has seen a reference to the </p>
<p>US plans to restructure the Coalition military within Iraq. The new Multi-National Force </p>
<p>HQ would be headed by a four-star general, and Gen Abizaid hoped that it would be </p>
<p>possible for the UK to second a three-star general to serve as one of the deputies. </p>
<p><b>642. </b> The discussion also covered finalising a Security Agreement which would allow </p>
<p>Coalition Forces to operate after 1 July 2004. Negotiations were expected to focus on </p>
<p>freedom of action for US forces and on Iraqi forces operating under US command. </p>
<p><b>643. </b> Ambassador Bremer told those present that he had authorised US$400m for job </p>
<p>creation and essential services over the next six months, about half in Sunni areas. </p>
<p><b>644. </b> On 19 December, Mr Sawers sent Mr Straw an ‘End of Term Assessment’ on </p>
<p>Iraq, for “holiday reflection” and to inform any conversations Mr Straw might have with </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Mr Sawers judged that:</p>
<p>“We are ending the year in better shape on Iraq than looked likely during much of </p>
<p>the autumn. But we continue to face formidable problems inside Iraq if we are to </p>
<p>maintain stability and deliver a handover of power to a Transitional Government </p>
<p>in June 2004.” </p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Sawers described increasing engagement on Iraq within the EU, and from the </p>
<p>UN. On security, he wrote:</p>
<p>“… the critical aspect to get right is to ensure that Iraqiisation moves ahead in step </p>
<p>with Iraqi capability and the prevailing security conditions. We must not fall into the </p>
<p>trap of equating numbers with capability.” </p>
<p><b>647. </b> Short-term issues to be tackled included “the fuel crisis” through the Iraqi winter </p>
<p>and drafting the TAL by the end of February 2004, but also:</p>
<p>“We will also have to find a solution to the problem of the Governing Council’s </p>
<p>determination that they should continue to exist in some form after 30 June.” </p>
<p><b>648. </b> At the end of December, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that he had spent the </p>
<p>holiday period in bilateral discussions with key GC members.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>649. </b> Discussions had clarified the difficulties faced by the GC in drafting the TAL. The </p>
<p>main obstacles were: the mechanism for choosing the Transitional National Assembly, </p>
<p>and Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani’s demands for elections; Kurdish efforts “to push for what </p>
<p>amounts to secession”; and the future of the GC post-transition. </p>
<p><b>650. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that the UK was in favour of sticking to the </p>
<p>timetable set out on 15 November throughout the political process, despite “a lot of </p>
<p>debate about whether things should be postponed or not because of security”.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>January 2004 </b></p>
<p><b>651. </b> In his New Year telegram to the FCO, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that the </p>

<p>transfer sovereignty.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>652. </b> The first of the “hurdles in front of us” was that:</p>

<p><b>653. </b> Sir Jeremy went on to say:</p>
<p>“We have a platform for eventual success here. </p>
<p>“That is the point of this telegram. This is a nasty environment. We are </p>
<p>fundamentally unpopular … To come out well, we need one more heavy investment </p>
<p>of effort. </p>
<p>“For a start, there is no military dividend to count on during … 2004. I gathered from </p>
<p>my December contacts with MODUK that this is understood … This theatre remains </p>
<p>a security crisis. Our people need protection.</p>
<p>“… Hard, complex, manpower-intensive decisions are needed from now on. London </p>
<p>cannot afford the luxury of manpower ceilings.”</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“In short, this thing is poised. There is so much at stake that we need to pull the </p>
<p>odds just a bit further our way.”</p>
<p><b>655. </b> On 4 January, Mr Blair visited Basra for the day.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> The final item of his itinerary </p>
<p>was a meeting with Ambassador Bremer, Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Sir Hilary Synnott </p>
<p>at Basra Airport. </p>
<p><b>656. </b> A briefing note from Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary suggested that he </p>
<p>should cover the following issues:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Political process: how to handle Sistani and keep the 15 November timetable on </p>
<p>track?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Progress on bringing the Sunnis into the political process, including the </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Media.” </p>
<p><b>657. </b> A record of the meeting said that: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister was interested in how the political process would develop </p>
<p>through the transition; how and when the UN could best be involved; and what civil </p>
<p>and military US and UK structures we envisaged in place after the June transition.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>659. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary also recorded that Ambassador Bremer had </p>
<p>briefed Mr Blair that Mr Richmond had been put in charge of the operational aspects </p>
<p>of the CPA’s ‘Sunni strategy’. This included up to US$250m in project funding, and </p>
<p>attempts at political mobilisation. Sir Jeremy Greenstock observed “that there were signs </p>
<p>that the Sunni tribal leadership was spontaneously taking an increased interest in the </p>
<p>political process”.</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Ambassador Bremer had also offered his perspective on the impact of the capture </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein. In his judgement the “psychological impact of the arrest was </p>
<p>significant on those who either hoped for or feared the restoration of the old regime”. </p>
<p><b>661. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock called on Mr Blair on 8 January.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>662. </b> On the political process, Sir Jeremy told Mr Blair that there was a genuine risk of a </p>
<p>fatwa by Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani against the proposed caucus procedure, and that in </p>
<p>such a case the Coalition could not afford to back down. </p>
<p><b>663. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry that his engagement with the GC and others was </p>
<p>“an inadequate interface”: he and Ambassador Bremer were very conscious that they </p>
<p>couldn’t have a direct conversation with Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani as he refused to have </p>
<p>any direct dealings with the CPA.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>664. </b> In their video conference on 6 January Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the </p>
<p>UN role in the political process and agreed it was important.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> Mr Blair suggested that </p>
<p>Mr Annan should say that direct elections to the Transitional Assembly were impractical, </p>
<p>giving Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani a “way to row back from his call for direct elections”. </p>
<p><b>665. </b> The discussion then moved on to media issues. Mr Blair commented that he had </p>
<p>been struck by the high level of satellite TV coverage in Iraq and the absence of Iraqi </p>
<p>politicians using the media effectively. Relying on word of mouth enhanced the power </p>
<p>of religious and tribal leaders. Mr Blair suggested that improved media would allow the </p>

<p><b>668. </b> The JIC identified:</p>
<p>“… a growing weight of evidence suggesting that … [Abu Musab] al- Zarqawi, who </p>
<p>has a longstanding relationship with AI, is beginning to play a leading role in co-</p>
<p>ordinating the activities of some mujahedin groups. Indications that AI, al- Zarqawi </p>
<p>and possibly AQ are co-ordinating activity and consolidating their presence </p>
<p>represent a worrying development … We remain unclear as to the capabilities of </p>
<p>these various Islamist extremist groups and cannot link them to specific attacks. </p>
<p>However, reporting shows that they continue to plan and conduct attacks, including </p>
<p>suicide bombings, and could pose an increasing threat to Coalition interests. There </p>
<p>is reporting that Islamist extremists regard the capture of Saddam Hussein as </p>
<p>providing an ideological vacuum that can be exploited in Sunni areas.”</p>
<p><b>669. </b> In January, the UK was keen to persuade the UN to become more involved in the </p>
<p>political process, although the UN was initially minded not to engage on the ground until </p>
<p>after the handover to Iraqi sovereignty on 1 July.</p>
<p>369</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>670. </b> The UK hoped that the UN would decide that direct elections to the Transitional </p>
<p>National Assembly were not possible, and would confirm this to Grand Ayatollah </p>
<p>al-Sistani, which would assist him in withdrawing his objections to the caucus </p>
<p>arrangements. </p>
<p><b>671. </b> The UK also hoped that the UN could become involved by at least observing the </p>
<p>caucus elections. UK officials noted that, having sought to exclude the UN, the US now </p>
<p>saw UN involvement in organising the caucus elections and drafting the TAL as a way </p>
<p>out of their problems.</p>
<p><b>672. </b> UK officials considered that, given Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani’s resistance, they </p>
<p>needed to have a fall-back position. The US, and UK Ministers, remained wedded to a </p>
<p>transition on 30 June. An alternative to caucus elections, although less legitimate, would </p>
<p>be to use the GC to select TNA members from the Governorates. </p>
<p><b>673. </b> A statement issued by the office of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani on 11 January </p>
<p>said that he had explained to the President of the GC his continued objections to the </p>
<p>15 November process, and their consequences, including:</p>
<p>“… if the provisional national council was formed on the basis of a mechanism </p>
<p>that did not enjoy the necessary legitimacy, it would not be able and neither would </p>
<p>the government emanating from it be able, to carry out their tasks and honour the </p>
<p>timetable set for the transitional period. Consequently, this would create serious </p>
<p>problems and the politicial and security situation would further exacerabate.”</p>

<p><b>674. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 12 January about managing the UK defence capacity </p>
<p>in the year ahead.</p>
<p>371</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>675. </b> Commenting on Mr Hoon’s minute, Mr Straw concluded that “overall I would favour </p>
<p>our investing more in Afghanistan, including deploying the ARRC when the conditions </p>
<p>are right, to ensure we deliver strategic success there. This may be eased by reductions </p>
<p>in Iraq, from next year.”</p>
<p>372</p>
<p><b>676. </b> When Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 14 January, </p>
<p>they discussed finding a way forward which would be supported by Grand Ayatollah </p>
<p>al-Sistani, who was understood to be supportive of a UN role and willing to co-operate </p>
<p>with the Coalition.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>677. </b> At Cabinet on 15 January Mr Straw described the political process as “at a </p>
<p>sensitive stage”.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> The role of elections in establishing transitional arrangements was </p>
<p>causing difficulty between the CPA and Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani. Mr Blair reported that </p>
<p>a conversation with President Bush had suggested that progress was being made in the </p>
<p>contacts between Ambassador Bremer and the Grand Ayatollah. </p>
<p><b>678. </b> In advance of a meeting between members of the GC and the UN in New York </p>
<p>planned for 19 January, senior US and UK officials agreed their objectives for the UN’s </p>
<p>involvement in the political process.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>679. </b> They hoped that by late February the UN would give an opinion on the possibility </p>
<p>of conducting elections for the TNA. In the event that elections were not possible </p>
<p>they hoped the UN would offer advice on a fully transparent method of choosing </p>
<p>representatives to the TNA, consistent with the timetable set out in the 15 November </p>
<p>Agreement.</p>
<p><b>680. </b> On 18 January, a suicide attack within the Baghdad Green Zone killed more than </p>
<p>20 people, mostly Iraqi citizens.</p>
<p>376</p>
<p> The FCO observed that this showed that “a serious </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>688. </b> The paper entitled ‘Iraq: The Next Six Months’ described UK objectives as:</p>
<p>“–   </p>
<p>a smooth transition of executive power on 1 July to a sovereign Iraqi transitional </p>
<p>government that is regarded domestically and internationally as legitimate:</p>
<p>–   </p>
<p>a Security Agreement which allows Multinational Forces the freedom they need to </p>
<p>operate, but which does not look like an extension of the Occupation …</p>
<p>–  UN Security Council endorsement of the above and an expanded UN role. </p>
<p>–   </p>
<p>an improving economy and infrastructure that will maximise the prospects of a </p>
<p>successful transition.” </p>
<p><b>689. </b> The main challenges were agreeing how the TNA would be appointed, in a manner </p>
<p>that Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani would accept; defining the terms of Kurdish autonomy; </p>
<p>and securing Sunni engagement. </p>
<p><b>690. </b> On the first, it was hoped that the UN’s assessment of whether elections were </p>
<p>feasible would help, but it also risked delaying the handover until the autumn. On the </p>
<p>second, the FCO judged that the Kurdish “bottom line will be that they will not accept </p>
<p>less autonomy than they have now. This should be achievable.” </p>
<p><b>691. </b> Agreeing the basis on which Coalition Forces would remain in Iraq after handover </p>
<p>was potentially an even larger problem. </p>
<p><b>692. </b> In a section on ‘Security Structures’, officials identified that the key challenge was </p>
<p>to ensure “an agreement that gives Multi-National Forces the operational freedom to </p>
<p>meet our objectives, but offers the Iraqis sufficient sense of sovereignty and strategic </p>
<p>input to avoid alienating them and international opinion”. The paper noted that:</p>
<p>“… historical precedents are instructive.The UK tried and failed three times to </p>
<p>conclude an agreement for British forces in Iraq in the 1920s – each time the </p>
<p>agreement was undermined by nationalist demonstrations.”</p>
<p><b>693. </b> The paper outlined that the UK and US agreed on “red line requirements” for a </p>
<p>Security Agreement, but identified differences, including that the US had not taken on </p>
<p>board that a number of multi-national partners would require Iraqi consent/invitation and </p>
<p>UN authorisation to be in place before they could confirm their continued contribution </p>
<p>after transition. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> The paper identified the UK’s view of the key elements of the Security Agreement as:</p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>At the invitation of the Iraqi government, Multi-National Forces will continue  </p>
<p>to be present in Iraq, authorised by a UN resolution, to ensure stability and </p>
<p>security. For this they would require freedom of action in certain definable </p>
<p>respects, and the right to detain, to continue WMD investigations, and to seize </p>
<p>intelligence material.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The Commander of the MNF will retain sole operational control of the </p>
<p>Multi-National Forces in Iraq and report to the UNSC along the lines of </p>
<p>arrangements for ISAF [International Security Assistance Force] in Afghanistan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Multi-National Forces will also require operational control of Iraqi forces … </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Iraqi sovereignty must be preserved by ensuring a role for the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>at the strategic level and with provision for consultation over all elements of </p>
<p>implementation of the Security Agreement, though without relinquishing MNF </p>
<p>operational control …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>The Agreement should emphasise the role of the Multi-National Force in </p>
<p>building the capacity of Iraqi forces to take over security responsibilities </p>
<p>through continued programmes of recruitment, training, mentoring, </p>
<p>monitoring, and advice.”</p>
<p><b>695. </b> The paper explained that a further UN resolution enshrining the terms of the </p>
<p>Security Agreement would be an important safety net. Although resolution 1511 provided </p>
<p>an adequate legal basis for the political transition and the presence of the MNF, the UK </p>
<p>saw value in a new resolution that endorsed: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the TAL; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the timetable in the 15 November Agreement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Security Agreement; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the powers of the newly-appointed UN Special Adviser Mr Brahimi.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Mr Blair annotated the document “this is excellent and seems the right strategy”. </p>
<p><b>697. </b> In ‘Iraq: The Next Six Months’ the FCO also outlined that the CPA’s outreach </p>
<p>programme was gaining momentum, and that there were some encouraging indicators </p>
<p>that the Sunni community was seeking to re-engage with the political process. </p>
<p><b>698. </b> A new Council of Sunni Communities – a grouping of Sunni religious leaders – had </p>
<p>formed. Members of the GC had held a large meeting with Sunni community leaders the </p>
<p>previous week in which the theme was national reconciliation. The FCO indicated that </p>
<p>the UK would continue to push this message, and the need for real practical measures, </p>
<p>including job creation, to underpin Sunni outreach. </p>
<p><b>699. </b> In a minute to Mr Straw on 26 January, Mr Sawers highlighted the “real risk” of </p>
<p>pushing “Iraq so fast down the road to democratic politics that it crashes in a welter of </p>
<p>intra- and inter-communal violence”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>701. </b> On 26 January, Sir Hilary sent a valedictory telegram</p>
<p>383</p>
<p> from Basra.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> In it he </p>
<p>reflected on progress since the invasion: </p>
<p>“History may judge the initial stages harshly. From my immediate and close </p>
<p>perspective … it is difficult not to take a similar view. But I am also optimistic  </p>
<p>that … the underlying objective … of a peaceful, prosperous democratic  </p>
<p>(of a sort) and un-threatening Iraq, is achievable … although some serious obstacles </p>
<p>remain in the way.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>702. </b> Sir Hilary’s conclusion was that:</p>
<p>“… the balance of probability is positive. In the South, at least, there has been </p>
<p>progress on each of the Prime Minister’s priorities and it is hard to recall just how </p>
<p>bleak things looked last summer.”</p>
<p><b>703. </b> On the political process, Sir Hilary observed that:</p>
<p>“The political wrestling is largely being conducted in Baghdad, London and </p>
<p>Washington. We in the Provinces, remote from the Governing Council and its </p>
<p>appointed ministers, can only facilitate political debate, observe, and report that the </p>
<p>complexities of the caucus process for indirect elections has found no favour …</p>
<p>“The challenges remain enormous. Some movement must be made towards Sistani </p>
<p>while avoiding wholesale erosion of the CPA/GC position and a political vacuum.” </p>
<p><b>704. </b> Sir Hilary’s observations on deployment of civilian resources are described in </p>
<p>Section 15.1, and on progress of reconstruction in Section 10.1. </p>
<p><b>705. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, although there was “anxiety and concern occasionally </p>
<p>flagged up very strongly” in Sir Hilary’s telegrams, when he left in 2004 Sir Hilary was </p>
<p>“on balance optimistic, not pessimistic”.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>706. </b> Sir Hilary wrote to the Inquiry, in response to Mr Blair’s evidence, to explain that his </p>
<p>valedictory remarks should be viewed in the context of his contemporary proposals for a </p>
<p>strategy to maintain the momentum of reconstruction after the CPA had dissolved.</p>
<p>386</p>
<p><b>707. </b> Sir Hilary observed:</p>
<p>“In the event my strategy was not accepted.” </p>
<p>383 </p>
<p>Valedictory telegrams are an FCO tradition. They mark the sender’s departure from post, and generally </p>
<p>include a summary of his/her reflections on their tenure. </p>

<p><b>708. </b> On 28 January, the JIC assessed the prospects for political transition.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“There are as yet no emerging political classes or individuals around which </p>
<p>a national secular government might form under a national leader. In these </p>
<p>circumstances, religious, regional and tribal figures may be more influential. </p>
<p>Their interests are likely to clash.”</p>
<p><b>709. </b> The Assessment continued:</p>
<p>“Although Coalition Forces have enjoyed some success against Islamist extremists </p>
<p>recently, there are signs that senior Al Qaida (AQ) associate al-Zarqawi is now playing </p>
<p>a significant role in co-ordinating mujahedin, and possibly AQ groups in Iraq …</p>
<p>“We judge that the lack of security remains a major threat to progress. Unless </p>
<p>tackled effectively, many of those who want to participate in the political process will </p>
<p>be deterred … unless they have physical protection, which will benefit organisations </p>
<p>with private militias …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The larger political and religious groups in Iraq operate their own militias. These </p>
<p>groups have become accepted as local law-enforcement agencies in some areas, </p>
<p>and the transition process will be vulnerable to their influence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani is pre-eminent among the moderate Shia clergy. He is </p>
<p>emphatic that he does not seek a personal political role, but he … insist[s] on the </p>
<p>Iraqi population having a democratic voice in the political process …</p>
<p>“Sistani’s influence is considerable, and extends to the Arab Sunni community … </p>
<p>Any pronouncement he makes on political matters is likely to have an impact, </p>
<p>possibly resulting in loss of Shia support or their withdrawal from the process … </p>
<p>In Basra, Sistani’s representative is inclined towards peaceful co-existence with the </p>
<p>Coalition, but adheres strongly to Sistani’s line on the political process and recently </p>
<p>instigated a demonstration by some 60,000 people … </p>
<p>“Muqtada al-Sadr poses a threat to stability, particularly in Najaf, Karbala, and </p>
<p>Baghdad … We judge that his support will remain limited, but that he remains </p>
<p>capable of provoking localised disorder.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>324</p>
<p><b>710. </b> At the end of January 2004, a Force Level Review by Lt Gen Reith recommended </p>
<p>that: </p>
<p>“Significant manpower savings may be possible through a rationalisation of security </p>
<p>and support.”</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and that: </p>
<p>“Given the right conditions there will be no need to replace the SSR battalion … and </p>
<p>the surge battalion … in Jul 04 … The intent is progressively and prudently to reduce </p>
<p>the Division’s footprint so that, by Jul 04, the Iraqi Security Forces are well placed </p>
<p>to assume their part in Regional Control. This draw down of UK forces will continue </p>
<p>until the major roulement in Nov 04.” </p>
<p><b>711. </b> Those recommendations were based on an assumption that Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform would be implemented “largely as planned (but only to applicable standards </p>
<p>for Iraq)”. </p>
<p><b>712. </b> The basis for a continued military presence in Iraq post-handover remained </p>
<p>unresolved.</p>
<p><b>713. </b> Gen Jackson had returned from his visit “surprised at just how immature the </p>
<p>plans for transition of authority on 1st July 2004 remain” and had concluded that “any </p>
<p>partnership between the Coalition and the ITA [Iraqi Transitional Administration] should, </p>
<p>in effect, make Iraq ‘part of the Coalition’”.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>714. </b> The Iraq Senior Officials Group, chaired by Mr Bowen, discussed the Security </p>
<p>Agreement on 28 January. By this time “UK non-papers on the Security Agreement and </p>
<p>post-transition security architecture had been fed into the US system”.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>715. </b> The US position was uncertain, but it was believed that US officials were likely to </p>
<p>recommend a “high degree of Coalition military control post-transition” which “did not sit </p>
<p>well with our desire for prominent Iraqi security leadership after 1 July”. </p>
<p><b>February 2004</b></p>
<p><b>716. </b> In early February, a draft of the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) was leaked </p>

<p><b>717. </b> This language was “incendiary”, and the US National Security Council was </p>
<p>reported to have instructed Ambassador Bremer to remove all references to security </p>
<p>from the draft.</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported to Mr Blair’s Private Office that progress on </p>
<p>the TAL was “steady”.</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>719. </b> Briefing prepared for Mr Blair in advance of a conversation with President Bush </p>
<p>outlined the difficult issues for the TAL, which included national security and federalism.</p>
<p><b>720. </b> The FCO was concerned that the TAL had become too detailed, and was no </p>
<p>longer the simple framework document on structures and principles originally envisaged, </p>
<p>making it difficult to explain to the public and potentially raising objections from </p>
<p>Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani and others. </p>
<p><b>721. </b> In a video conference on 4 February, Mr Blair suggested to President Bush that </p>
<p>engagement in Iraq was an opportunity for the UN to re-establish its credibility; it could </p>
<p>also provide an “insurance policy” for the Coalition on the Iraqi political process.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>722. </b> In early February, the Chiefs of Staff considered whether or not the UK should </p>

<p>so in early 2005.</p>

<p><b>723. </b> On 9 February, Mr Llewellyn received a letter from Ms Adams.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> It recorded advice </p>
<p>given by Professor Christopher Greenwood QC, with which the Attorney General agreed, </p>
<p>in response to questions from Mr Llewellyn. Those questions were about the status </p>
<p>of the CPA plus the UK’s obligations as Occupying Power and under the European </p>
<p>Convention of Human Rights. </p>
<p><b>724. </b> Mr Llewellyn described the main conclusion of Ms Adams’ letter as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was likely that the CPA would be found to be a body constituted by the US </p>
<p>and UK, for which the two States had joint responsibility under international </p>
<p>law. It was likely that this would mean that the UK could be held responsible </p>
<p>for legislation adopted by the CPA which infringed Occupation law. The fact </p>
<p>that UK officials may have attempted to get the legislation amended would </p>
<p>not be relevant because “Bremer acts on behalf of the UK in authorising </p>
<p>CPA legislation.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>326</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a serious chance that the UK could be regarded as being an </p>
<p>Occupying Power jointly with the US throughout the whole of Iraq. There was </p>
<p>a much clearer case that the UK is an Occupying Power within MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Mr Llewellyn commented: </p>
<p>“These conclusions are not a surprise. They confirm the advice that we have given </p>
<p>throughout the period of occupation. In particular, we have assessed all draft CPA </p>
<p>legislation against occupation law … We have been largely successful in keeping </p>
<p>the legislation within the UK’s international legal obligations, but the following are </p>
<p>areas of risk …” </p>
<p><b>726. </b> Mr Llewellyn then listed several provisions within the CPA ‘s orders and regulations </p>
<p>which he was concerned that the CPA may not have had the authority to make, or where </p>
<p>the UN representative had not been consulted as required by resolution 1483.</p>
<p><b>727. </b> On 9 February, FCO officials provided Mr Cannon with a brief for a planned video </p>
<p>conference between Mr Blair and President Bush.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> They judged the priority for the </p>
<p>discussion to be the Security Agreement. The US had a different approach to the UK: </p>
<p>they did not believe it worthwhile to attempt to negotiate an agreement with the Iraqis on </p>
<p>security because any agreement made with the GC would be invalid after 30 June. </p>
<p><b>728. </b> Instead, the US believed that resolution 1511 authorised an MNF presence after </p>
<p>30 June and that CPA Order 17, which provided for immunities for Coalition Forces, </p>
<p>would remain valid after the handover. UK lawyers doubted this interpretation, while </p>
<p>policy officials were concerned that the other permanent members of the UN Security </p>
<p>Council would claim that, without a new agreed basis for the Coalition presence, the </p>
<p>occupation was continuing. </p>
<p><b>729. </b> More importantly for the UK’s military objectives, the lack of a new UN </p>
<p>authorisation could cause difficulties for the Coalition’s key partners in the MNF. Mr Blair </p>
<p>was advised that the best course would be an exchange of letters between the GC and </p>
<p>the Coalition, followed by a further resolution endorsing the continued MNF presence.</p>
<p><b>730. </b> The covering note from Mr Straw’s Private Secretary said that reporting from </p>
<p>Washington and Baghdad suggested the US was considering delaying the 30 June </p>
<p>handover. She suggested that in the video conference:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister might underline the damage any postponement would do to our </p>
<p>credibility inside Iraq and internationally.” </p>
<p><b>731. </b> In a background note appended to the brief there was some positive news of </p>
<p>“growing evidence that Sistani is resigned to no elections before June”. </p>

<p>327</p>
<p><b>732. </b> Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary advised him to argue for maintaining the end </p>
<p>of June deadline in his conversation with President Bush, because:</p>
<p>“We think that a postponement will damage our credibility (looking as though we </p>
<p>intended to stay on indefinitely); the UN won’t engage before the end of ‘occupation’; </p>
<p>we risk deterioration in security if the US/UK remain as the primary targets;  </p>
<p>and the Iraqi political vacuum will continue until we force the Iraqis to face up  </p>
<p>to real responsibility.”</p>
<p>397</p>
<p><b>733. </b> Sir Nigel raised the possibility of a further resolution with Dr Rice on 9 February at </p>
<p>which point she was not in favour.</p>
<p>398</p>
<p> He recorded that “her key point was that we should </p>
<p>do nothing to undermine the value of UNSCR 1511”. </p>
<p><b>734. </b> In his conversation with President Bush on 10 February, Mr Blair said that it was </p>
<p>vital the 30 June deadline held firm.</p>
<p>399</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>735. </b> The Cabinet Office’s Annotated Agenda for the meeting of the AHMGIR on </p>
<p>12 February stated that the US position that there was no need for a Security Agreement </p>
<p>with Iraq post-transition had hardened but no final decisions had yet been taken in </p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p> Ministers were advised that it was worth seeking to influence the US by </p>
<p>pressing the political and military drawbacks, rather than the legal objectives.</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Work to draft the TAL continued towards the deadline for publication on </p>
<p>28 February.</p>
<p>401</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>737. </b> Drafting progress was slowed in early 2004 by a combination of the Eid holiday, the </p>
<p>distraction of a visit by Mr Brahimi and his team, and ongoing discussion of the issues </p>
<p>surrounding Kurdish federalism.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>738. </b> Mr Brahimi and a UN team had visited Iraq for ten days in early February. Cabinet </p>
<p>Office officials briefed the AHMGIR that:</p>
<p>“Brahimi’s early contacts with Bremer and Greenstock suggest UN doubts about </p>
<p>elections and the caucus process prior to 30 June with a preference for Afghanistan </p>
<p>models (e.g. a national conference or national government of technocrats).”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>739. </b> Cabinet Office officials observed that with that model “we would still face the </p>
<p>problem of how to select the representatives of a national conference or government”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>740. </b> On 12 February, Mr Straw told the AHMGIR:</p>
<p>“Brahimi … and [Grand Ayatollah al-] Sistani had met and agreed that direct </p>
<p>elections should take place but had not specified the timing. Neither wanted direct </p>
<p>elections before June … We were leaving decisions on the TNA [Transitional </p>
<p>National Assembly] selection process to Brahimi and the UN team.”</p>
<p>403</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>741. </b> An FCO paper on ‘UK Representation in Iraq Post-Transition’ was discussed at the </p>
<p>same meeting of the AHMGIR on 12 February. It contained proposals for an Embassy in </p>
<p>Baghdad, a Consulate General in Basra and a representative in the North. </p>
<p><b>742. </b> The paper stated that the estimated combined start-up and running costs for </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra would be over £50m in 2004/05. If the UK presence remained the </p>
<p>same size, annual running costs would be around £36m thereafter, of which £22m would </p>
<p>be for security. </p>
<p><b>743. </b> Ministers agreed the shape of British representation and tasked officials to </p>
<p>consider the practicalities, including funding.</p>
<p><b>744. </b> Separately, the paper suggested that consideration needed to be given to how </p>
<p>international assistance in the South should be co-ordinated after CPA(South) closed on </p>
<p>30 June. The AHMGIR requested a paper on co-ordination of the international effort in </p>
<p>the South, for discussion at its next meeting. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet on 12 February that two recent large bomb attacks </p>
<p>were believed by a minister in the GC to have been organised by “infiltrators” with </p>
<p>support from inside Iraq but “such attacks would not be allowed to destabilise the </p>
<p>political process”.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>746. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported on 14 February that he was not being consulted </p>
<p>by Ambassador Bremer on the TAL, and that he had sent a formal note reminding </p>
<p>him that the UK was one of the Occupying Powers, and could not agree to the TAL </p>
<p>arrangements unless properly consulted.</p>
<p>405</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>747. </b> Ambassador Bremer had said that the matter was out of his hands and had been </p>
<p>determined in Washington.</p>

<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>329</p>
<p><b>749. </b> Mr Blair was advised by Sir Nigel Sheinwald that although there was some tension </p>
<p>in US/UK relationships on the ground in Baghdad, “The Americans of course accept </p>
<p>in principle that, as Occupying Powers, we have legal and political responsibilities and </p>
<p>must be consulted properly.”</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>750. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I felt that if I was being cut out of politics … then I really wasn’t able to do my job as </p>
<p>London had asked me to do it. I don’t think this was a matter of Bremer not wanting </p>
<p>Greenstock in the room. It was a matter of Bremer wanting to sort out differences in </p>
<p>Washington without there being a non-American in the room. But I felt that even that </p>
<p>was off-side for my relationship with Bremer.”</p>
<p>408</p>
<p><b>751. </b> Sir Jeremy added:</p>
<p>“So we constantly had to press to get in to relevant meetings because it was </p>
<p>becoming increasingly difficult for Bremer to run the CPA with Washington, with </p>
<p>Blackwill inserted to watch over his shoulder, and he just didn’t want to complicate </p>
<p>his own life.”</p>
<p>409</p>
<p><b>752. </b> In spite of the complexities of the relationship, Sir Jeremy explained: </p>
<p>“I always felt that I – whether Bremer was aware of it or not, I was doing something </p>
<p>useful. For instance, in the negotiations with the Kurds over the TAL, where I </p>
<p>prevented the Kurds walking out, which Bremer wasn’t aware of, in the final stages </p>
<p>and negotiated some of the text with TAL when Bremer wasn’t in the room. I always </p>
<p>had something useful to do. I never had enough scope to do everything that I </p>
<p>thought would be useful.”</p>
<p>410</p>
<p><b>753. </b> In advance of Mr Brahimi’s report to the Security Council of his visit, Mr Crompton </p>
<p>wrote to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary on 16 February that his key findings would be:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that elections to a Transitional National Assembly are not possible before </p>
<p>30 June;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that there should be elections some time between December 2004 and </p>
<p>March 2005 to an assembly with twin responsibility for legislating and drafting </p>
<p>the Constitution; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that in the interregnum Iraq should be ruled by a caretaker government.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>330</p>
<p><b>754. </b> It was not clear to the FCO whether Mr Brahimi’s team would recommend what </p>
<p>form the caretaker government should take. One option was that sovereignty would be </p>
<p>transferred to the Governing Council. This:</p>
<p>“… may not be enough to mark a clear change from the Occupation and give </p>
<p>sufficient domestic legitimacy.” </p>
<p><b>755. </b> Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani was understood to have accepted Mr Brahimi’s </p>
<p>recommendations. </p>
<p><b>756. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott and Mr Blair met in London on 17 February.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p> The purpose </p>
<p>of the meeting was for Mr Blair to thank Sir Hilary for his efforts in Basra. The main </p>
<p>point made by Sir Hilary during the discussion was that transition to Iraqi sovereignty </p>
<p>could lead to a loss of momentum in reconstruction in the South after the dismantling </p>
<p>of CPA(South). Mr Blair agreed that it needed to be maintained.</p>
<p><b>757. </b> On 20 February, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Sawers and Sir David Manning met </p>
<p>Dr Rice at the White House. Sir Nigel set out the UK’s view that the Iraqi political </p>
<p>structure post-handover should comprise:</p>
<p>“… a three to nine member Presidency; a technocratic Council of Ministers, headed </p>
<p>by a Prime Minister; and an IGC expanded by representatives of the Governments</p>
<p>413</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and nominated representatives.”</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>758. </b> It was common ground between the UK and US that the GC should be expanded </p>
<p>in size. The post-transition arrangements were expected to be the subject of “six weeks </p>
<p>of sustained effort” by Mr Brahimi in Iraq in mid-March. </p>
<p><b>759. </b> In an account of the visit written for Mr Blair, Sir Nigel explained that the UK view </p>
<p>was that the expansion of the GC should be substantial (to 75 or 100 members)  </p>
<p>in order to make it more representative; the US preferred a more modest expansion </p>
<p>(to 35 or 50).</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> Sir Nigel advised that the UK should not be dogmatic. </p>
<p><b>760. </b> Sir Nigel and Mr Sawers had argued for a new resolution to cover the UN role, </p>
<p>transitional structures and security arrangements.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> A letter from the GC to the Coalition </p>
<p>on security was also suggested by the UK attendees as “an additional demonstration of </p>
<p>Iraqi consent to the presence of Coalition Forces”. The note of the meeting concluded </p>
<p>that there seemed to be agreement on this point. </p>

<p><b>761. </b> After returning to London, Sir Nigel wrote to Mr Geoffrey Adams, Principal Private </p>
<p>Secretary to Mr Straw, to describe Mr Blair’s reaction to the visit report.</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> Mr Blair had </p>
<p>noted:</p>
<p>“… there is a good degree of common ground between the UK and US … and </p>
<p>also that there are some differences, eg over the powers and size of the proposed </p>
<p>Consultative Council”. </p>
<p><b>762. </b> Mr Blair’s view was that:</p>
<p>“… we should continue to be flexible and open on these matters. If a particular </p>
<p>solution emerges which works for the UN, Sistani and the IGC, it is likely to be </p>
<p>acceptable to the UK.”</p>
<p><b>763. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw on 21 February that the Kurdish Regional </p>
<p>Government had posted a four-page amendment to the TAL on its website, which </p>
<p>included a provision giving them a veto in the national government.</p>
<p>418</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Kurdish autonomy</b></p>
<p>Early in 2004, there was pressure from Kurdish political parties to use the draft TAL to </p>
<p>entrench Kurdish autonomy.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> </p>
<p>FCO officials believed that Ambassador Bremer’s proposed recognition within the draft </p>
<p>TAL of Kurdistan’s Regional Government, which had been administering Northern </p>
<p>Iraq effectively for 12 years, was the right approach, although Washington took a </p>
<p>different view.</p>
<p>420</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A draft agreement on Kurdish autonomy simply acknowledged the status quo, making </p>
<p>clear that more complex issues would have to be addressed as part of wider discussions </p>
<p>on federalism by the eventual elected Constitutional Convention. Other ethnic and </p>
<p>religious groups were reported as being wary of any hint of special treatment for the </p>
<p>Kurds, equating calls for federalism with separatism, but these issues would have to be </p>
<p>resolved among Iraqis themselves in 2005. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer and Sir Jeremy Greenstock appeared to succeed in persuading </p>
<p>Washington on this, and the reference to the Kurdish Regional Government was retained </p>
<p>in the draft text.</p>
<p>421</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy told Mr Blair in February 2004 that “US handing of the federalism issue had </p>
<p>wasted several weeks and cost a lot of Kurdish goodwill.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>764. </b> On 23 February, Mr Annan wrote to the President of the Security Council to </p>
<p>report Mr Brahimi’s findings from his first visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p> Mr Brahimi had identified three </p>
<p>conditions which needed to be met before transitional elections could be held:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a legal framework; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an institutional framework; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>availability of the required resources. </p>
<p><b>765. </b> None of those conditions existed in Iraq and Mr Brahimi assessed that, even once </p>
<p>they did, a minimum of eight months would be required to prepare for a credible election. </p>
<p>He therefore considered it was not possible to hold an election by 30 June 2004, when </p>
<p>the transfer of sovereignty was due to take place. </p>
<p><b>766. </b> Mr Brahimi therefore concluded that a provisional government would need to be </p>
<p>formed by 30 June through some mechanism other than direct elections. He considered </p>
<p>that while the caucus-style system envisaged by the 15 November Agreement was </p>
<p>one such mechanism, it did not have enough support among Iraqis. Instead, Iraqis </p>
<p>should work together with the CPA and the UN to engage in a focused dialogue on the </p>
<p>mechanism to which sovereignty would be transferred on 30 June. </p>
<p><b>767. </b> More broadly, Mr Brahimi judged that:</p>
<p>“There are many indications of a growing fragmentation of the political class. </p>
<p>Sectarianism is becoming entrenched and inter-communal politics more polarized, </p>
<p>all within a context of a political process that remains limited to a few actors, with </p>
<p>varying credibility.”</p>
<p><b>768. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 24 February.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> </p>

<p> Sir Jeremy highlighted the tension between providing </p>

<p><b>774. </b> Mr Llewellyn wrote to the IPU on 25 February.</p>

<p>as was clearly required by resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>775. </b> Consultation had taken place until the death of Mr Vieira de Mello on </p>
<p>19 August 2003. But when FCO Legal Advisers subsequently tried to establish with </p>
<p>the CPA what form of consultation was taking place, their response made clear that </p>
<p>consultation had probably ceased since the departure of the UN in the aftermath of the </p>
<p>August bombing.</p>
<p><b>776. </b> Contact between lawyers to point to the legal requirement and so encourage </p>
<p>consultation had got nowhere. In Mr Llewellyn’s view, the extensive body of CPA </p>
<p>legislation dealing with economic reform and governance matters since August 2003 </p>
<p>was therefore of questionable lawfulness. The risk of claims against the UK could not </p>
<p>be ruled out. </p>
<p><b>777. </b> Mr Llewellyn therefore recommended that the matter should be taken up at a more </p>
<p>senior level, or that the UK should simply conduct the UN consultation itself by sending </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>778. </b> On 25 February, the JIC assessed that, although the rate of attacks against </p>
<p>Coalition Forces had levelled off, February 2004 was the worst month for casualties </p>
<p>since the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p> Attacks using Improvised Explosive </p>
<p>Devices (IEDs) and surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) had become more sophisticated. </p>
<p><b>779. </b> More than 200 people were killed in suicide attacks in February, nearly all of them </p>
<p>Iraqis. The JIC assessed that most of the suicide attacks may have been carried out by </p>
<p>Islamist extremists, including groups linked to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p><b>780. </b> Attacks on Iraq’s police and security forces were increasing, with vehicle-borne </p>
<p>bombs causing most casualties. In attacks on a police station and army recruiting centre </p>
<p>almost 100 Iraqis had been killed. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> A major attack in Erbil on the main Kurdish parties left 101 dead.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>782. </b> In early February there had been an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate </p>
<p>Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> The JIC judged that a successful attack would be  </p>
<p>“very de-stabilising”.</p>
<p><b>783. </b> Major General Andrew Stewart, GOC MND(SE) from December 2003 to July 2004, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that he considered that the increase in violence and intimidation in </p>
<p>southern Iraq in February and March could be attributed to the Shia political parties </p>
<p>losing influence over the people and stirring up militias.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>784. </b> There were also continuing concerns about Al Qaida. In late February the JIC </p>
<p>assessed that:</p>
<p>“Islamist extremists continue to travel to Iraq. Some intelligence suggests that </p>
<p>Islamist extremists have been responsible for most of the recent suicide attacks over </p>
<p>the last months. Senior Al Qaida associate al-Zarqawi is playing a prominent role. </p>
<p>But the exact relationship between al-Zarqawi, Al Qaida, Ansar al Islam and other </p>
<p>apparently unaffiliated Islamist groups in Iraq is unclear … In a letter,</p>
<p>432</p>
<p> now made </p>
<p>public by the CPA, to senior Al Qaida commander Abd al Hadi al-Iraqi, al-Zarqawi </p>
<p>admits that numbers are small and that Iraq is proving to be a difficult environment </p>
<p>to operate in … Suicide attacks, although relatively small in number, are having a </p>
<p>disproportionate impact … </p>
<p>“In his letter al-Zarqawi claims to have been responsible for 25 suicide operations. </p>
<p>Al-Zarqawi also lists Americans, Kurds, Iraqi troops, police and agents, and the </p>
<p>Shia as his main targets. In particular, he sees attacking the Shia as a means of </p>
<p>fomenting civil war, and thereby ensnaring the Coalition in Iraq. Al-Zarqawi offers </p>

<p>that the Al Qaida leadership is opposed to al-Zarqawi’s plans to cause Muslim  </p>
<p>in-fighting.”</p>
<p>433</p>
<p><b>785. </b> The Cabinet Office Annotated Agenda for the meeting of the AHMGIR on </p>
<p>26 February observed that Mr Brahimi appeared to have resolved the problem posed </p>
<p>by the position of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, and his plan was close to what the UK had </p>
<p>originally proposed.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>786. </b> The Annotated Agenda explained that the UN had not so far taken a firm view on </p>
<p>the form of the caretaker government, although it was willing to assist with building Iraqi </p>
<p>consensus on its power, structure and formation, as well as with advice and assistance </p>
<p>on electoral processes. </p>
<p><b>787. </b> Cabinet Office officials wrote that the UK wanted the UN to engage as far as </p>
<p>possible in the run-up to transition and had an open mind as to structures for the interim </p>
<p>government, but felt they should provide: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a degree of continuity between the pre- and post-transition arrangements; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear change to indicate that Occupation was over; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>greater representation than the GC, to increase domestic legitimacy and  </p>
<p>draw in others. </p>
<p><b>788. </b> This pointed towards an expanded version of the GC, with a technocratic Council </p>
<p>of Ministers headed by a Prime Minister and a Presidency or Leadership Council. </p>
<p>Cabinet Office officials wrote that the US agreed in broad terms. </p>
<p><b>789. </b> The Annotated Agenda also recorded that “the UN’s growing role in the political </p>

<p><b>790. </b> The TAL was agreed by the GC on 1 March.</p>

<p>“(1) </p>
<p>The first phase shall begin with the formation of a fully sovereign Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government that takes power on 30 June 2004. This Government shall be </p>
<p>constituted in accordance with a process of extensive deliberations and </p>

<p><b>792. </b> The TAL stated that the National Assembly would be elected in accordance with an </p>
<p>electoral law and a political parties law. The electoral law would “aim to achieve the goal” </p>
<p>of no less than 25 percent female representation and “having fair representation for all </p>
<p>communities in Iraq, including the Turcomans, ChaldoAssyrians, and others”. </p>
<p><b>793. </b> The TAL recognised the Kurdistan Regional Government as the “official </p>
<p>government” for the territories it administered on 19 March 2003, before the invasion </p>
<p>began. It would “continue to perform its current functions throughout the transitional </p>
<p>period, except with regard to those issues which fall within the exclusive competence of </p>
<p>the federal government”.</p>
<p><b>794. </b> On security, the TAL named the Iraqi Armed Forces as “a principal partner in the </p>
<p>Multi-National Force operating in Iraq under unified command pursuant to the provisions </p>
<p>of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1511”. The Transitional Government </p>
<p>would have “the authority to conclude binding international agreements regarding the </p>
<p>activities of the Multi-National Force”. </p>
<p><b>795. </b> The AHMGIR discussed the TAL in its meeting on 1 March.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> The FCO </p>
<p>official present judged the TAL a “good compromise” which had been accepted by </p>

<p><b>796. </b> One (unidentified) member of the AHMGIR observed that:</p>
<p>“While a goal rather than mandatory, the 25 percent figure for women’s </p>

<p>representation was 30 percent in Denmark but less than 25 percent in the UK.”</p>
<p><b>797. </b> In his account of his time as Head of the CPA, Ambassador Bremer describes </p>
<p>the TAL as “the most remarkable document in Iraq’s long history”.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>798. </b> Ambassador Bremer told the Inquiry that the TAL “gave Iraq the political structure </p>
<p>and opportunity to remain a united, free and democratic country”.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p><b>799. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It is not clear to me really how much thought had been given to what would be </p>
<p>the consequences of … bringing democracy particularly to Iraq. It shouldn’t have </p>
<p>been impossible to work out that we were going to have problems … with a built </p>
<p>in majority … but if people had worked that out then I had no sense that anybody </p>
<p>had done anything … in the end we found solutions to that problem, but within a </p>
<p>democratic system it is actually quite difficult, but a straightforward first past the </p>
<p>post winner takes all is an extremely difficult situation to deal with. It requires quite </p>
<p>a complex constitutional political process. Checks, balances, power sharing. We </p>
<p>began to try to put some of that in place when we drafted the TAL, but the reality is </p>
<p>we should have been thinking about these issues right from the beginning.”</p>

<p><b>800. </b> On 2 March, there were:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>338</p>
<p><b>802. </b> In an update report to No.10 on 4 March, FCO officials described the Ashura </p>
<p>attacks as “devastating” and commented that they:</p>
<p>“… seem to confirm our fears that foreign fighters are trying to insight [sic] sectarian </p>
<p>violence by targeting the Shia. The attacks succeeded despite carefully planned </p>

<p>442</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>803. </b> Between 1 and 8 March, the Shia members of the GC consulted Grand Ayatollah </p>

<p>443</p>
<p> No amendments were made as a result. </p>
<p><b>804. </b> The weekly ‘Iraq Update’ for Mr Blair sent by Mr Straw’s Private Secretary on </p>

<p><b>805. </b> The same update recorded that the UK was encouraging Mr Brahimi to return to </p>

<p><b>807. </b> In preparation for a video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush on </p>
<p>9 March, the IPU prepared a brief which focused on the next steps in the political </p>

<p>446</p>
<p> It suggested that:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister might stress to President Bush the importance of the IGC and </p>
<p>CPA publicising the plan [the TAL] properly within Iraq, given that details of the law </p>
<p>were tightly held until the signing ceremony.”</p>
<p><b>808. </b> The IPU also set out a proposal to turn an expanded version of the GC into a </p>
<p>consultative council as a “national political forum of some sort to help create a new, </p>
<p>cross-sectarian political class and national political discourse ahead of the elections to </p>
<p>the National Assembly”. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>It judged that:</p>
<p>“Saddam Hussein called for a jihad to attract mujahedin to Iraq before and during the </p>

<p>“The scale of the Islamist extremist presence in Iraq is not known. Nor is the level </p>

<p>attractive to an increasing number of Iraqis. </p>

<p>451</p>
<p> He had also commented:</p>
<p>“These conclusions are not a surprise. They confirm the advice that we have given </p>

<p><b>816. </b> The IPU had brought the concerns set out in Mr Llewellyn’s letter of 25 February to </p>
<p>the attention of Mr Richmond in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>817. </b> On 15 March Mr Richmond replied, explaining that he had spoken to one of the </p>
<p>US lawyers in the CPA Office of the General Counsel (OGC – the CPA’s legal advisers) </p>
<p>to ask if they could reinstate the previous practice of consulting the UN on CPA orders </p>
<p>by faxing them to Mr Mountain.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p> OGC were content to do so, but Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>was not. </p>
<p><b>818. </b> It had been reported to Mr Richmond that, when the UN left Iraq in August 2003, </p>
<p>OGC began sending draft legislation to the UN legal office through the US Mission to </p>
<p>the UN (USUN). USUN were subsequently advised by a “reliable source” that, if they </p>
<p>continued to do this, the UN Legal Office was likely to veto legislation. Consultation had </p>
<p>then ceased. When Mr Mountain was appointed, OGC had suggested that they should </p>

<p>he would forward it to the UN legal office, who would veto it. </p>
<p><b>819. </b> State Department officials suggested that OGC should simply mention to </p>
<p>Mr Mountain when he was in Baghdad that they had legislation in various areas in </p>
<p>process. OGC agreed with the UK that this was not sufficient consideration to meet </p>
<p>the requirements of resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>820. </b> Mr Richmond explained that OGC had tried to agree a new process of consultation </p>
<p>with the UN but Ambassador Bremer had objected to the proposals. He wished to </p>
<p>avoid both a UN veto over proposed CPA Orders and delay to the CPA’s legislative </p>
<p>programme. As a result, the State Department had been asked to come up with a </p>

<p><b>822. </b> In an annex to the Annotated Agenda, the IPU recommended that, if there was </p>
<p>to be a resolution endorsing the new political process, then “we should take that </p>
<p>opportunity to also endorse the new security arrangements”.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> This would resolve the </p>
<p>problems of relying on resolution 1511 or an invitation from the (not fully sovereign) GC </p>
<p>as the basis for a continued military presence. </p>
<p><b>823. </b> By 18 March, the GC had issued an invitation to the UN to return to help with the </p>
<p>structure of the interim government and preparations for elections for the Transitional </p>
<p>National Assembly (TNA) to be held by January 2005.</p>
<p>455</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>824. </b> On 25 March, Mr Benn told Cabinet that the next question now the TAL had </p>
<p>been agreed was how to organise an interim government from 1 July.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p> There were </p>
<p>tensions within the GC about the role of the UN in that process. He observed that it </p>
<p>would be important to ensure that the transition to an interim government “resulted in </p>
<p>arrangements which looked and felt different from the preceding ones”. </p>
<p><b>825. </b> On 31 March, the JIC assessed that insurgent attacks on Coalition Forces had </p>
<p>fallen from a peak in November 2003 and levelled off, but suicide attacks targeting Iraqis </p>
<p>had increased significantly since the turn of the year.</p>
<p>457</p>
<p> Although the JIC did not know </p>
<p>the numbers of those involved in or supporting the violence, the occurrence of more </p>
<p>than 200 incidents a week was considered to suggest thousands rather than hundreds </p>
<p>of individuals. </p>
<p><b>826. </b> The JIC assessed that the relative threat from different groups was difficult to </p>
<p>gauge; in many cases it was not possible to attribute attacks to specific groups. </p>
<p><b>827. </b> The JIC judged: </p>
<p>“I. </p>
<p>Islamist extremists … will seek to increase the level of violence in the lead up to, </p>
<p>and beyond, the transition of power on 30 June … </p>
<p>II. </p>
<p>The level of violence is undermining Iraqi confidence in the Coalition and its </p>
<p>objectives. </p>
<p>III. </p>
<p>Islamist extremists are finding it difficult to operate. But they will pose a </p>
<p>continuing and dangerous threat, particularly those associated with al-Zarqawi. </p>
<p>Attacks by them upon Iraqi Shia and Kurds risk stirring up inter-communal </p>
<p>violence. A failure by the security forces to contain the violence could lead to a </p>
<p>failure of the political process and a breakdown of law and order.”</p>

<p><b>828. </b> In addition, the JIC considered:</p>
<p>“A further source of resistance to the Coalition may increasingly be disaffected Sunni </p>
<p>Arabs – not necessarily connected to the former regime – who fear Shia domination </p>
<p>and are frustrated by lack of money and jobs. Their motivations are diverse: anti-</p>
<p>Americanism, Iraqi nationalism, insensitive CF [Coalition Forces] actions, tribal and </p>
<p>clan loyalties, criminal financial gain and other grievances. And some Sunni Arabs </p>
<p>are increasingly attracted to a radical Islamist ideology.”</p>
<p><b>829. </b> At the end of March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock concluded his six month tour in Iraq </p>
<p>and was succeeded by Mr David Richmond. </p>
<p><b>830. </b> Sir Jeremy’s valedictory telegram entitled ‘Six Months in the Cauldron’ thanked UK </p>
<p>civilians and military for their “effective and courageous” work in Iraq.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>831. </b> Sir Jeremy judged that “the majority of the Iraqi people are still with us, just” </p>
<p>and that life was beginning to improve for many. But this was not attributable to </p>
<p>good planning:</p>
<p>“The preparations for the post-conflict stage were abject; wrong analysis, wrong </p>
<p>people … And the volume of resources required on the ground was, and continues </p>
<p>to be, misjudged.” </p>
<p><b>832. </b> On security, he judged that the problems “will, alas, not go away when the </p>
<p>Occupation ends. The evil-doers … are small in number but lethal in effect.” </p>
<p><b>833. </b> Sir Jeremy also recorded the important role that Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani had </p>
<p>played by using his religious authority as a force for moderation.</p>
<p><b>834. </b> By the end of March, UK and US officials were discussing the detail of the </p>

<p>to welcome the agreed arrangements for the transfer of full executive authority </p>
<p>and the proposed processes during the transition;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to specify the role of the UN during the transition; and</p>

<p>“A series of meetings are underway to communicate the TAL to Iraqis. Reactions </p>

<p>gradually increasing during February and March, it was not until April that JAM was </p>
<p>identified as a specific threat.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> He recalled that: </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>845. </b> Al Jazeera journalists were present inside Fallujah, and images of the US offensive </p>
<p>were broadcast across Iraq and the world. Lt Gen Sanchez wrote in his memoir: </p>
<p>“To say that the Fallujah offensive angered the Sunni Muslims of Iraq would be a </p>
<p>gross understatement … When the images of destruction were broadcast on  </p>
<p>Al Jazeera, most Sunnis felt Fallujah was an attack on their very existence …  </p>
<p>When tribal leaders put out a call to arms, Sunnis everywhere responded and the </p>
<p>Sunni Triangle exploded into violence.”</p>
<p>468</p>
<p><b>846. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that he had been “very concerned” because:</p>
<p>“What the Americans were doing in Fallujah which was being broadcast all over </p>
<p>the Arab media was causing serious problems all round, certainly the Sunni part </p>
<p>of Iraq but also … the Shia part of Iraq. It was clear to me this had to stop if we </p>
<p>weren’t going to face very, very serious problems. I was in constant contact with </p>
<p>London throughout the period and made very clear my views about that. I spoke to </p>
<p>Bremer and made clear what my views were about that … I think ultimately Bremer </p>
<p>came down on the same side as me and told the military that they had to rethink </p>
<p>that policy.”</p>
<p>469</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>847. </b> General Sir John McColl, SBMR-I from April to October 2004, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“There was a debate within headquarters as to how we should proceed, a debate </p>
<p>which I shared with London, and there were those within the American camp who </p>
<p>wanted to move early and seize the initiative, which involved the early use of kinetic </p>
<p>force, and those who wanted to move more slowly. Certainly, in terms of my advice </p>
<p>at the time, it was to move cautiously, to try and ensure that, as far as we could, we </p>
<p>carried the politics with us and prepared the political conditions to support whatever </p>
<p>military activity took place.”</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>848. </b> General Sanchez wrote in his memoir that:</p>
<p>“… the British three-star general [McColl] on the CJTF-7 consistently voiced his </p>
<p>Government’s concerns about our planned offensive and I’m certain that lively </p>
<p>discussions took place between the White House and 10 Downing Street. London </p>
<p>believed that we were being far too heavy-handed, but President Bush still gave the </p>
<p>order to launch.”</p>

<p>Mr Brahimi eventually agreed to remain.</p>
<p><b>850. </b> On 6 April, in a briefing on a planned conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Private Secretary wrote that:</p>
<p>“We are now fighting on two fronts for the first time. We risk underestimating </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army. There is an effective Sunni insurgency, which is </p>
<p>gaining confidence from the problems we are facing with the Shia. Overall, this is the </p>
<p>most serious challenge we have yet faced.”</p>
<p>473</p>
<p><b>851. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 7 April.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>852. </b> Mr Blair did not suggest that the US should draw back from Fallujah. Instead, he </p>
<p>told President Bush that the decisions on how to deal with Muqtada al-Sadr and others </p>
<p>rightly lay with those on the ground. They needed to act “in a decisive but sensitive way”; </p>
<p>people needed to see that the Coalition was determined to stay to see the job done. </p>
<p>They agreed to send out a clear public message that there was a process leading to </p>
<p>transfer of authority in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>853. </b> Senior members of the CPA briefed the GC on developments in Fallujah on </p>
<p>8 April.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> Mr Richmond reported that the GC raised particular concerns that the US </p>
<p>blockade of the city was preventing the entry of medicines, blood, doctors and food. </p>
<p>By preventing civilians from crossing the bridge from one side of the town to the other, </p>
<p>the US military were also preventing civilians from getting to the main hospital, and </p>
<p>mourners getting to the cemetery to bury their dead. </p>
<p><b>854. </b> One minister in the GC, who came from Fallujah, resigned and it was anticipated </p>
<p>that others might follow.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>855. </b> Mr Richmond provided daily reports on the situation in Fallujah as it unfolded. </p>
<p><b>856. </b> On 8 April, the atmosphere was tense.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> The impact of the offensive was </p>
<p>heightened by TV coverage which was “inflaming opinion” and encouraging the </p>
<p>insurgency in the rest of the country. Action to counter that was hampered by the fact </p>
<p>that several nations’ terms of engagement prevented their forces from taking part in </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>859. </b> On 8 April, in a letter to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary </p>
<p>explained that US intentions for dealing with al-Sadr and his supporters were “becoming </p>
<p>clearer” and that the US military had “ordered offensive operations against al-Sadr </p>
<p>supporters with the aim of eliminating them as a credible force”. </p>
<p><b>860. </b> On 8 April, Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on the proposed security arrangements </p>
<p>after 30 June.</p>
<p>480</p>
<p> He explained that “the Coalition needs to put in place satisfactory legal </p>
<p>and other arrangements for the force when the Occupation ends”. If they did not, “any </p>
<p>perceived gap in the legal base for UK’s conduct … is likely to be exploited by litigants”. </p>
<p><b>861. </b> Mr Straw set out the difference between the US and UK positions on a legal </p>
<p>basis for continued military operations after 30 June, and the UK’s legal concerns </p>
<p>about relying on resolution 1511. He observed that a strong case might be made that </p>
<p>resolution 1511 covered a continued military presence in Iraq, but that he doubted it </p>
<p>would cover “the full range of activities we have hitherto been conducting under the law </p>
<p>of armed conflict and Occupation law”. </p>
<p><b>862. </b> Mr Straw suggested that in contacts with the US, the UK should stress the need </p>
<p>to agree a common approach to the forthcoming resolution (expected in May or June) </p>
<p>which would also help the UK’s position against legal challenge. He emphasised that </p>
<p>when they were nearer to a clear outcome on the resolution, it would be necessary </p>
<p>to consult the Attorney General to ensure that the UK’s minimum legal requirements </p>
<p>were covered. </p>
<p><b>863. </b> On 9 April, Mr Richmond reported that the Coalition had offered a 24-hour </p>
<p>cessation of operations in Fallujah “to allow the entry of additional humanitarian supplies </p>
<p>and to enable representatives of the IGC to go to Fallujah to discuss Coalition terms for </p>
<p>ending the current military operation”.</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> The terms of the cessation included surrender </p>
<p>of the individuals who had killed the Blackwater contractors. Had the offer not been </p>

<p>action in Fallujah was being characterised as “collective punishment”.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p> Further </p>
<p>negotiation between members of the GC and the CPA/US military resulted in a new plan </p>
<p>for a cease-fire and subsequent withdrawal of Coalition Forces. </p>
<p><b>865. </b> Mr Richmond’s assessment of the situation on 10 April said:</p>
<p>“Generals Abizaid and Sanchez are confident that they can deal with (though not </p>
<p>eliminate) the Sunni insurgency currently centred on Fallujah and Ramadi … I do not </p>
<p>share their confidence … The military action in Fallujah … has ignited smouldering </p>
<p>resentment amongst other Sunnis. Governing Council members are warning us that </p>
<p>there will be other ‘Fallujahs’ in towns throughout the Sunni heartland … it is also </p>
<p>beginning to undermine the support of otherwise moderate Shia … The Americans </p>
<p>claim that their operations in Fallujah are targeted and precise. But to the outside </p>
<p>they look like collective punishment. The casualty figures, though not reliable, tend </p>
<p>to bear this out … Worse, the current situation is also putting huge pressure on the </p>
<p>Governing Council … If the Governing Council collapses (or loses all credibility) it is </p>
<p>difficult to see how we can find anyone else to work with us on the formation of an </p>
<p>Interim Government to take over from the CPA on 30 June. We will have no-one to </p>
<p>hand over to.”</p>

<p>484</p>
<p> They had persuaded leaders </p>
<p>representing 90 percent of the rebel fighters that a complete cease-fire was necessary </p>
<p>but reported back to Ambassador Bremer and Mr Richmond that the city was a: </p>
<p>“… disaster zone. The humanitarian situation was dire with a reported 518 killed so </p>
<p>far, including 46 children under the age of 5; 83 children under 15 and 157 women. </p>
<p>1,224 people had been injured and there were problems with water and electricity </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>870. </b> In a letter explaining his reasons to Lieutenant General Thomas Metz, the </p>
<p>Commander of MNC-I (see Box, ‘Creation of MNF-I, MNC-I and MNSTC-I’), </p>
<p>Maj Gen Stewart recognised that the refusal might: </p>
<p>“… appear from Baghdad to be both ineffective and apparently out of line with your </p>
<p>intent … one size does not fit all for Iraq and the south east is different. I believe </p>
<p>that our actions are being effective … Whether we like it or not, Sadr’s movement is </p>
<p>part of the political fabric in southern Iraq … This does not mean that the south east </p>
<p>is under the thumb of the Sadrists. On the contrary nearly all our interlocutors … </p>
<p>express dislike of his methods, but his sentiments resonate … Coalition Forces and </p>
<p>[Iraqi Security Forces] have secured … every municipal building within … MND(SE) </p>
<p>… Most importantly, we take the view that it is the Iraqis who will have to go on living </p>
<p>here after we depart and surely it is best to produce an Iraqi solution to an Iraqi </p>
<p>problem … I believe that our current tactics in MND(SE) are correct.”</p>
<p><b>871. </b> In advance of a meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair asked Sir Nigel Sheinwald </p>
<p>for “a note setting out a strategy for dealing with the range of problems we face </p>
<p>in Iraq”.</p>
<p>486</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>872. </b> Sir Nigel’s 12 April response identified a number of elements that a strategy </p>
<p>should include:</p>
<p>“(i)  </p>
<p>Military. We are starting to see, and need to entrench, a more measured US </p>
<p>military approach.</p>
<p>Above all, we must avoid fighting simultaneously on two fronts. We cannot </p>
<p>afford to lose the consent of the majority Shia population … [W]e should aim to </p>
<p>settle the MAS [Muqtada al-Sadr] problem first … </p>
<p>The US needs to make an effort to re-cement the Coalition.</p>
<p>(ii)  </p>
<p>Iraqiisation: we need to revisit this and our old friend de-Ba’athification. </p>
<p>The key to Fallujah and Najaf will be the insertion of Iraqi forces, rather </p>
<p>than a heavy and overt American presence on the streets. But this is not </p>
<p>straightforward given the lack of capacity of the newly formed Iraqi forces … </p>
<p>(iii)  </p>
<p>Inclusiveness: the Coalition needs to involve the IGC and local sheikhs in </p>
<p>resolving these problems. Above all we cannot afford to lose the IGC …</p>
<p>(iv)  </p>
<p>Deal with the causes: there are many deep sources of discontent, and we </p>
<p>cannot hope to deal with all of them. On both the Shia and Sunni sides, we </p>
<p>need programmes which (a) increase jobs, particularly for the young and (b) </p>
<p>increase personal security …</p>

<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>349</p>
<p>(v)  </p>
<p>The political future: this needs to be set out more clearly: elections at the end </p>
<p>of January, prepared by the UN; interim government structures in place  </p>
<p>by 1 July when we hand over sovereignty, with the UN again playing a key </p>
<p>advisory role, and better consultation on how to get there …</p>
<p>(vi)  </p>
<p>UN role: we need to clarify and promote the UN role: electoral support  </p>
<p>and political advice on the ground now; new UNSCR in May/June; clear  </p>
<p>UN co-ordinating and political role from 1 July …</p>
<p>(vii)   The deadline: we must stick to the deadline of 1 July, but need to make </p>
<p>a better job of explaining ourselves. The date is right because it remains </p>
<p>important to make an early transfer of sovereignty to the Iraqis, which they </p>
<p>themselves want …</p>
<p>(viii)  Communication: if we can agree a strategy like this, Bremer and the IGC </p>
<p>should promulgate it in a media offensive in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>873. </b> Sir Nigel concluded: </p>
<p>“We need to emerge from your meeting with Bush on Friday with the message that </p>
<p>you have an agreed, comprehensive strategy covering the handling of the immediate </p>
<p>crisis, Iraq’s political future leading to elections in January, and the role of the UN.” </p>
<p><b>874. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told Dr Rice on 14 April that there were rumours of imminent </p>
<p>further military action in Fallujah.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p> The UK judged that would be very damaging, in Iraq </p>
<p>and internationally and wanted attempts at mediation to continue “and for the tension </p>
<p>gradually to abate”. Dr Rice said that no decisions had been taken. </p>
<p><b>875. </b> On 14 April, the JIC issued an Assessment of security in Iraq, prompted by events </p>
<p>in Fallujah and attacks by JAM.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> The JIC’s first two Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I.  </p>
<p>Anti-Coalition forces occupy the centre of Fallujah. Their determination to fight in </p>
<p>a confined urban area represents a step change in capability and threat.</p>
<p>“II.  </p>
<p>The scale and extent of attacks mounted by the Mahdi Army and associated </p>
<p>Shia militants have come as a surprise. They are the first concerted attacks by </p>
<p>Shia militias on Coalition Forces. But attacks have been localised, have now </p>
<p>reduced and have only been supported by a minority of Shia. There is no clear </p>
<p>evidence of co-ordination between Sunni and Shia groups.” </p>
<p><b>876. </b> Key Judgement VII was that:</p>
<p>“The security situation may remain volatile even if a settlement is reached in Fallujah </p>
<p>and Najaf. The upsurge in violence has confirmed previous concerns over the </p>
<p>weaknesses of the Iraqi security forces.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>877. </b> The JIC also judged that the emergence of hostage-taking as a tactic by </p>
<p>anti-Coalition forces was “adding to the climate of fear and encouraging foreign </p>
<p>contractors to leave”.</p>
<p><b>878. </b> On 15 April, Mr Blair and Mr Annan met in New York.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> They agreed that the </p>
<p>political plan being formulated by Mr Brahimi should form part of a new resolution and </p>
<p>that the negotiation of its text should begin in May. </p>
<p><b>879. </b> Mr Blair underlined the importance of the UN’s role in Iraq, both for political </p>
<p>leadership and in communicating with the Iraqi people. He offered UK support for the </p>
<p>deployment of a greater number of UN officials to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>880. </b> On 15 April, Sir Nigel sent Dr Rice a “personal paper” from Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush, which Mr Blair hoped the President might read before their conversation </p>
<p>the next day.</p>
<p>490</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>881. </b> In his paper Mr Blair identified two problems:</p>
<p>“… the first is a residue of discord over the decision to go into Iraq. People who </p>
<p>disagreed are desperate to be proved right. So every difficulty is magnified; every </p>
<p>step forward ignored; every setback hailed as failure.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The second problem is more immediately serious. It is that, irrespective of the </p>
<p>original decision to go into Iraq, people ask of us: do they have a plan for Iraq that </p>
<p>will work? Do they know what they are doing?”</p>
<p><b>882. </b> The first was an “issue of political vision”; the second, one of “practical </p>
<p>competence”. Mr Blair summarised his strategy as:</p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>local engagement by Iraqis to sort the Sunni and MAS [Muqtada al-Sadr] </p>
<p>problems, with Fallujah critical;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>backed by a specific set of offers to deal with grievances;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>backed by an Iraq-wide campaign of communication, led and fronted by Iraqis.” </p>
<p><b>883. </b> Mr Blair also proposed a new resolution, firstly to provide the US and UK with the </p>
<p>political and military authority they required, but also including “measures on human </p>
<p>rights and due process so that the resolution sets out a vision of Iraq as a democratic </p>
<p>state that puts our critics on the defensive”. </p>

<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>351</p>
<p><b>884. </b> Mr Blair went on to consider international disagreement over the nature of the </p>
<p>security threat, and how it might be addressed through the G8. He wrote:</p>
<p>“We need to find a way of forcing the world to confront the dangers it faces; and to </p>
<p>build an agenda capable of consolidating and extending our support.” </p>
<p><b>885. </b> On 16 April, Mr Blair and President Bush met in Washington.</p>
<p>491</p>
<p> The meeting was </p>
<p>also attended by Dr Rice, Secretary Powell, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr Rycroft. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> Mr Blair stressed to President Bush the importance of standing firm, setting out a </p>
<p>clear political vision and implementing it competently.</p>
<p><b>887. </b> On Muqtada al-Sadr, Mr Blair said that he needed to be brought out of Najaf alive, </p>
<p>with an agreement to disband his militia. He should not be made a martyr. </p>
<p><b>888. </b> In discussion it was clear that US forces had been close to action in Fallujah a </p>
<p>couple of days previously, but had held back based on Ambassador Bremer’s advice </p>
<p>that they would “lose the IGC” if they did so. </p>
<p><b>889. </b> On Fallujah, Mr Blair suggested that the Coalition needed to get the balance right </p>
<p>between firmness and initiating further aggression. Any military offensive needed to be </p>
<p>careful, with every effort taken to avoid civilian casualties, and clearly a last resort. The </p>
<p>Coalition could not afford an error. Mr Blair continued that there needed to be a clear </p>
<p>strategy for addressing the grievances of both the Sunnis and the al-Sadr supporters, </p>
<p>including tackling poverty in Sadr City. He again emphasised the importance of better </p>
<p>communication with the Iraqi population.</p>
<p><b>890. </b> On the political process, neither the US nor the UK had difficulties with </p>
<p>Mr Brahimi’s emerging plans for the interim government. A new resolution was </p>
<p>necessary, and Mr Blair proposed that it might also include measures to set out a </p>
<p>vision of Iraq as a democratic state.</p>
<p><b>891. </b> By 18 April the situation in Fallujah was described by Mr Richmond as “relatively </p>
<p>calm” with talks continuing between the Coalition and a delegation of Fallujan leaders.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The possibility that offensive operations might resume remained and there was “CJTF-7 </p>
<p>talk of allowing one week for dialogue to yield results”. </p>
<p><b>892. </b> Negotiations between leaders in Fallujah, GC representatives, US military </p>
<p>commanders and CPA officials had enabled access to the city for emergency services, </p>
<p>the return of civilians, and progress with the handing in of weapons. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>893. </b> Coalition Forces remained in place in Fallujah although Mr Richmond reported that </p>
<p>“military action is not imminent”. It was hoped that:</p>
<p>“… if the citizens [of Fallujah] gained confidence, they would be able to put pressure </p>
<p>on the extreme elements”. </p>
<p><b>894. </b> Maj Gen Stewart told the Inquiry that the impact of events in Fallujah had been </p>
<p>significant among the Shia community in Southern Iraq.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p> At Friday prayers the </p>
<p>dominant issue had been the need to raise money for fellow Iraqis in Fallujah, because </p>
<p>what was happening there was “way beyond the pale”.</p>
<p><b>895. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“It wasn’t just that we were worried about the proportionality of the tactics that were </p>
<p>used or about the perception in the international and Iraqi media of what went on. It </p>
<p>was also that it happened at the same time as American action on the Shia side to </p>
<p>which the Shia reacted very violently … Ultimately the strategic threat was a loss of </p>
<p>Shia consent.”</p>
<p>494</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>896. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that the change in US stance as April </p>
<p>progressed was not exclusively because of the UK. Action in Washington, threatened </p>
<p>resignations from the GC, and the position of Mr Brahimi all had an influence.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>897. </b> By mid-April, the Coalition had regained control of nearly all the towns that had </p>
<p>been taken by JAM, leaving Muqtada al-Sadr’s forces restricted to the cities of Najaf, </p>
<p>Kufa and parts of Karbala, which were then the focus of millions of Shia Pilgrims </p>
<p>observing the Muslim holiday of Arba’een.</p>
<p>496</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>898. </b> After reading briefing given to him in advance of meeting President Bush, Mr Blair </p>
<p>expressed concern to Sir Nigel Sheinwald about the security situation in Iraq and the </p>
<p>problems facing the CPA in implementing its main programmes and policies.</p>
<p>497</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>899. </b> Sir Nigel commissioned 15: </p>
<p>“… unvarnished accounts of where things stand, with as much local colour as </p>
<p>possible; and with clear recommendations, where appropriate, for how to improve </p>
<p>things … The Prime Minister is conscious that implementation of these programmes </p>
<p>depends on the Americans, in Iraq and in Washington. It is therefore essential that </p>
<p>departments in London should ensure that their opposite numbers in Washington </p>
<p>are aware of our concerns, and that we work with them to produce credible plans for </p>
<p>improving performance.”</p>

<p>498</p>
<p> He had therefore “decided to </p>

<p>was explained that:</p>
<p>“IraqRep should prepare a weekly checklist of immediate actions. The Cabinet Office </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>904. </b> In conversation with Dr Rice on 21 April, Sir Nigel Sheinwald said: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister continued to believe, as he and the President had agreed … </p>
<p>that time was on our side and that we did not need to rush into new military action, </p>
<p>while of course accepting the need for the American forces to defend themselves </p>
<p>properly … targeted activity against extremists was one thing; another heavy assault </p>
<p>would have a major adverse impact, in Iraq and internationally … the Prime Minister </p>
<p>was clear that we should avoid precipitate action if possible and give time for the </p>
<p>results to emerge from the negotiations … </p>
<p>“I made clear that the Prime Minister would want a discussion if there were any </p>
<p>question of the US tactics changing …”</p>
<p>500</p>
<p><b>905. </b> In mid-April, the US made a request for the UK to send additional troops to Iraq.</p>
<p>501</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>906. </b> The request was made “informally, with no explanation of any underlying rationale </p>
<p>or assumptions” and proposed four packages of support, including the deployment of an </p>
<p>HQ (for which the main contender was the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps or ARRC), which </p>
<p>together might have totalled 10,000 additional troops.</p>
<p><b>907. </b> The US proposal was that the UK should provide:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Corps headquarters, to command both MND(SE) and neighbouring MND </p>
<p>Centre South (MND(CS)); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an armoured infantry battlegroup to be available, for a few months, as a mobile </p>
<p>reserve for the whole of Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an expansion of MND(SE) to backfill for the Spanish troops that had been </p>
<p>withdrawn from Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an expansion of the security resource focused on protecting the main supply </p>
<p>routes. </p>
<p><b>908. </b> The first advice sent by Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary to Mr Rycroft was that the </p>
<p>request needed to be examined “very carefully”. The only Corps-level headquarters </p>
<p>available to the UK was the ARRC, a NATO asset which would therefore require NATO </p>
<p>agreement to deploy “which is unlikely to be obtainable very rapidly or easily”. The </p>
<p>advice explained that:</p>
<p>“… we will need to consider to what extent we would be increasing our exposure </p>
<p>to the consequences of future US actions in, for example, Fallujah, and to what </p>
<p>extent if at all we could expect to have any greater practical influence over US </p>
<p>decision-making”.</p>

<p>355</p>
<p><b>909. </b> Having seen the letter to Mr Rycroft, Mr Straw also offered his thoughts on “political </p>
<p>aspects” of the deployment, in a letter from his Private Secretary.</p>
<p>502</p>
<p> Mr Straw endorsed </p>
<p>the MOD’s initial instinct to analyse the US request carefully. He observed that sending </p>
<p>the ARRC to Iraq:</p>
<p>“… would preclude its possible deployment to Afghanistan … probably until well </p>
<p>into 2006. This would complicate the prospects of delivering our objectives in </p>
<p>Afghanistan. But we may have to recognise that Iraq is the higher priority and the </p>
<p>(even harder) theatre to which to attract and retain international troop contributors.” </p>
<p><b>910. </b> Having read the letter from Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, Mr Bowen also supplied </p>
<p>advice to Mr Rycroft.</p>
<p>503</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>911. </b> Mr Bowen advised that the deciding factor ought to be whether taking on </p>
<p>wider responsibility would make a difference to the Coalition’s strategic success in </p>
<p>Iraq. Providing more troops for the sake of “burden sharing” was not, in his view, </p>
<p>advisable but doing so in the realistic hope that it would have a strategic impact was </p>
<p>potentially worthwhile.</p>
<p><b>912. </b> The JIC assessed the degree to which Iran might have supported or encouraged </p>
<p>Shia violence on 21 April.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p> It judged that Iran continued to want to see a stable and </p>
<p>non-threatening Iraq. Although there was a suggestion that some Iranians might have </p>
<p>offered support to Muqtada al-Sadr:</p>
<p>“Iran has not been behind attacks on Coalition Forces. It did not have foreknowledge </p>
<p>of Muqtada al-Sadr’s actions and probably has not provided any significant support </p>
<p>to al-Sadr’s followers in the recent violence. But it would probably support a violent </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>915. </b> Mr Blair urged President Bush to give more time if it was possible and to avoid </p>
<p>at all costs the bombing of mosques or the killing of large numbers of civilians.</p>
<p>507</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He underlined the importance of working with Iraqi civic leaders and working closely </p>
<p>with Mr Brahimi. </p>
<p><b>916. </b> On 23 April, Mr Blair received the first edition of all 15 “unvarnished accounts” </p>
<p>reports commissioned by Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 19 April, plus an additional four </p>
<p>covering essential services, oil, next year’s budget and Ambassador Bremer’s recent </p>
<p>speech in Tikrit.</p>
<p>508</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>917. </b> Those covering media, reconstruction, essential services, oil, gender issues and </p>
<p>health and education are described in Section 10.1.</p>
<p><b>918. </b> The paper covering the Iraqi judicial system is covered in Section 12.1. </p>
<p><b>919. </b> Mr Dominic Asquith, Deputy Chief Commissioner in the CPA, sent a checklist of </p>
<p>issues for Mr Blair to raise with President Bush.</p>
<p>509</p>
<p> On Fallujah, Mr Asquith’s advice was: </p>
<p>“… delay for as long as there are negotiations in play; when military operations </p>
<p>commence, adopt a graduated response, starting with limited and targeted </p>
<p>measures; be ready to cease operations if a negotiating process can recommence; </p>
<p>and put in place an effective support plan for when it is over.” </p>
<p><b>920. </b> On the political process, Mr Asquith advised that more effort should be put into </p>
<p>defining what the UK and US wanted out of the process. He suggested:</p>
<p>“–  a Presidency involving a Shia, Sunni and Kurd politician, with a Sunni or Shia at </p>
<p>the top;</p>
<p>–  a technocratic Cabinet, if necessary with a political Prime Minister, who is Shia, </p>
<p>provided he is not Islamist or Chalabi;</p>
<p>–  and a ‘chamber’ of 100 or 125 if that is the price of finding a home for the rest </p>
<p>of the IGC, with some legislative capacity (eg to approve laws) and the right to </p>
<p>summon ministers to account for their decisions;</p>
<p>–  a National Conference either before or after 30 June: in the case of the former, </p>
<p>it would have the added attraction of ‘endorsing’ all the above (on the basis of a </p>
<p>package presented to it).”</p>
<p><b>921. </b> Mr Asquith judged that a National Conference would have the best chance of </p>
<p>securing the right outcome if Coalition leaders attended. </p>

<p>357</p>
<p><b>922. </b> In a more detailed telegram on managing the political transition, Mr Asquith </p>
<p>wrote that:</p>
<p>“The formation of the IGC last year was unprecedented in its creation of a political </p>
<p>body that fairly accurately reflected Iraq’s diverse society. But its creation instituted  </p>
<p>a specific balance of ethnic and sectarian representation in Iraq’s political  </p>
<p>structures and empowered a specific set of players, many of whom were exiles. </p>
<p>Inevitably, many others were excluded. That these leaders were anointed by </p>
<p>the Occupying Powers had always remained a cause for criticism by political </p>
<p>actors outside the IGC.</p>
<p>“This feeling of popular resentment … was one of Brahimi’s concerns during his </p>
<p>recent visit. A key principle underlying his plan for the formation of an interim </p>
<p>government is the depoliticisation of government through the formation of an </p>
<p>apolitical cabinet of technocratic ministers, headed by a Prime Minister, and a </p>
<p>Presidency Council of a President and two Deputy Presidents.”</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>923. </b> The process by which the interim government would be formed remained unclear, </p>
<p>but Mr Asquith observed that:</p>
<p>“Whichever option is chosen the difficulty will be managing the competing </p>
<p>aspirations of the dominant political players …</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the one political force we have to placate is [Grand Ayatollah al-] Sistani.” </p>
<p><b>924. </b> In a separate telegram on Shia leadership in Iraq, Mr Asquith judged that:</p>
<p>“… the leading Shia members of the IGC have developed ties with Sistani, and </p>
<p>will try to exploit this relationship to ensure their own political ascendency. The </p>
<p>Ayatollah’s view of the IGC parties is less clear, and he may be persuadable that a </p>
<p>technocratic government is preferable for the interim period.”</p>
<p>511</p>
<p><b>925. </b> Mr Asquith sent a parallel telegram on the Sunni political picture.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> In it he warned:</p>
<p>“Continued failure to address Sunni grievances threatens the long-term stability in </p>
<p>Iraq. Fallujah has provoked a reassessment by those in the CPA who believed Sunni </p>
<p>dissatisfaction was manageable. Leaving the community insecure about its future </p>
<p>risks perpetuating an environment that breeds continued anti-Coalition and later </p>
<p>anti-Iraqi government activity.”</p>

<p>358</p>
<p><b>926. </b> The Cabinet Office also supplied a check list of points for Mr Blair, which raised the </p>
<p>urgent need to agree what would replace the CPA outside Baghdad after transition, work </p>
<p>on which had “scarcely started”.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>927. </b> The Cabinet Office list went on to record the need for “genuine partnership” </p>
<p>between the MNF and Iraqi forces “including at high command level, if we are to raise </p>
<p>the performance of Iraqi security forces and tackle insurgents and terrorists”. </p>
<p><b>928. </b> The IPU supplied a paper on Iraq’s neighbours, which proposed that:</p>
<p>“Developing regional support for the political process is essential to build the </p>
<p>legitimacy of the new Iraqi political institutions and assist the reconstruction </p>
<p>process.”</p>
<p>514</p>
<p><b>929. </b> The paper divided neighbouring states into three groups: constructive, cautious </p>
<p>and difficult. IPU’s conclusion was that: </p>
<p><b>“We should continue to engage all the neighbours on a bilateral basis,  </b></p>
<p><b>co-ordinating our efforts with the US, and discreetly encourage development </b></p>
<p><b>of the neighbours group.”</b></p>
<p><b>930. </b> Mr Chris Segar, Head of the British Office Baghdad, sent a paper on everyday </p>
<p>life in Baghdad, written in the voice of an Iraqi named ‘Mohammed’.</p>
<p>515</p>
<p> Mr Segar </p>
<p>summarised Mohammed’s concerns as:</p>
<p>“When will I be able to go about my life without fearing for my safety and that of </p>
<p>my family? I have more faith in the Dinar these days; but I don’t have enough of </p>
<p>them. Some other things are better now too. But I’m not sure what is going on in </p>
<p>the Green Zone; and I don’t think there is anyone who represents me. Al Jazeera </p>
<p>and Al Arabiyya – and more people on the street – tell me that the occupiers have </p>
<p>no respect for my people. I’m glad that Saddam is gone; but will my children have a </p>
<p>better life here?” </p>
<p><b>931. </b> On security, Mr Blair received a telegram from Mr Asquith describing the situation </p>
<p>area by area, and a minute from Maj Gen Stewart in MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>932. </b> Mr Asquith wrote that: </p>
<p>“Fallujah and Najaf continue to hang heavy over any security forecast. If the storm </p>
<p>breaks there, the effects will spread widely. </p>

<p>operations, which have inflicted significant civilian and military casualties. Evidence </p>
<p>that Former Regime Elements are increasing their activity in the Sunni Triangle </p>
<p>and extending their links to extremist groups in other parts of the country. Even if </p>
<p>Fallujah and Najaf are resolved, the potential remains for an upsurge in violence and </p>
<p>other spectaculars by extremists intent on undermining Coalition support. Iraqis will </p>
<p>continue to feel insecure in the absence of a clear political route ahead.”</p>
<p>516</p>
<p><b>933. </b> In his minute, Maj Gen Stewart concluded:</p>
<p>“The security situation remains part of the whole. In MND(SE) it is manageable </p>
<p>at current effort provided external factors are contained. The leadership of the </p>
<p>ISF needs to be improved and supported with the necessary policies to develop </p>
<p>a credible national force so that Iraqis can increasingly take charge of their own </p>
<p>security. Most importantly, the political process must be addressed by improving </p>
<p>popular engagement in it. Iraqis at all levels need to see the benefits from the bottom </p>
<p>up and have a say in the top down.”</p>
<p>517</p>
<p><b>934. </b> The external factor which Maj Gen Stewart judged to be most threatening to </p>
<p>security in the South was “the approach to the al-Sadr problem”, specifically:</p>
<p>“The Shia will not accept a forceful solution that either places the holy sites at risk or </p>
<p>sees al-Sadr arrested by CF [Coalition Forces]. Such a resolution had the potential </p>
<p>to inflame the street, turning dissatisfaction into an insurgency.” </p>
<p><b>935. </b> On 26 April Mr Rycroft wrote to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, copying his letter to </p>
<p>DFID, the MOD, the Cabinet Office and to UK officials in Iraq and the US.</p>

<p><b>936. </b> Mr Rycroft wrote that Mr Blair had read all 15 reports produced as a result of </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s commission of 19 April, had thought them “very good”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>“The conclusion the Prime Minister draws … is that the problem we face is not </p>
<p>multi-faceted. It is simple: security. It casts its shadow over everything from oil </p>
<p>production to education to the political process. The Iraqis ultimately want what we </p>
<p>want: a stable Iraq from which the Coalition Forces leave. The essential elements of </p>
<p>our security strategy have to be: make a reality of Iraqi-isation; focus on hearts and </p>
<p>minds; and make clear that we will stay, in overwhelming force, until the job is done.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>937. </b> Mr Rycroft went on to outline how Mr Blair thought existing activity could be </p>
<p>improved:</p>
<p>“(a) </p>
<p>Iraqi-isation. We must do whatever it takes to get the ICDC and Iraqi police </p>
<p>into shape. Every main road has to be guarded, oil refineries rebuilt, electricity </p>
<p>generation on target …</p>
<p>(b) </p>
<p>Communications. There needs to be a concerted campaign in Iraq and abroad </p>
<p>to explain what the security problem actually is, and how it is a deliberate </p>
<p>attempt to prevent the Iraqi people from getting the benefit of what we are </p>
<p>doing. We need to provide top security for al-Iraqiya’s [a newly set up Iraqi </p>
<p>TV channel] reporters and staff; strengthen the Coalition’s Arabic media </p>
<p>capability; improve the co-ordination between military and political to give real </p>
<p>time information to spokesmen; and vastly improve the Iraqi government’s </p>
<p>communications capability.</p>
<p>(c) </p>
<p>Reconstruction spending. There is a damaging gap between ‘obligated’ funds </p>
<p>and actual spending … We need urgent clarity and agreement on what will </p>
<p>replace the CPA outside Baghdad after 30 June.</p>
<p>(d) </p>
<p>The courts. We need to ensure that trials of criminals and sentencing begin </p>
<p>again …</p>
<p>(e) </p>
<p>Political process. We should not exclude IGC members altogether …</p>
<p>(f) </p>
<p>Security agreement. We need urgent agreement on the relationship between </p>
<p>the MNF and the Iraqi authorities and Iraqi forces after 30 June.” </p>
<p><b>938. </b> Mr Blair also asked for answers to a number of detailed questions including how </p>
<p>many civilians had been killed in Iraq and whether the UK was confident that the security </p>
<p>part of the transition plan for Southern Iraq would work. </p>
<p><b>939. </b> On the same day, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice another Note from Mr Blair, and </p>
<p>asked her to show it to President Bush before their video conference the next day.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>940. </b> In his Note Mr Blair set out the detailed analysis that Mr Rycroft had communicated </p>
<p>across Whitehall, which was summarised as:</p>
<p>“The good news is that the problem we face is not multi-faceted. It is simple: </p>
<p>security. The bad news is that I am not sure we yet have a fully worked-out strategy </p>
<p>to tackle it. But we can get one.”</p>
<p><b>941. </b> On 26 April, Mr Rycroft wrote back to Mr Hoon’s office in relation to the US request </p>
<p>for deployment of additional UK troops.</p>
<p>520</p>

<p>clearly military-led”.</p>

<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>942. </b> Mr Rycroft reported that Mr Blair’s initial view on the US request was that, provided </p>
<p>it made military sense and was achievable, MND(SE) should be expanded to include </p>
<p>Najaf (where the Spanish troops had been based), but that care should be taken to </p>
<p>avoid any increase in the overall number of UK forces. He did not rule out the use of the </p>
<p>ARRC in the longer term, but did not want to rush into a decision on it. </p>
<p><b>943. </b> On 26 April, Sir David Manning, British Ambassador to the US, described to </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald a conversation with Mr Bob Blackwill.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>944. </b> Sir David reported that a video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush, </p>
<p>planned for the following day, was more than usually important. The President was </p>
<p>reported to be “more or less” in the same place as Mr Blair and, although he would not </p>
<p>be receptive to the argument that action could be avoided in Fallujah, “he was certainly </p>
<p>open to discussion about how to conduct it, and to manage the consequences”. </p>
<p><b>945. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 27 April.</p>
<p>522</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney, Dr Rice, Mr Blackwill and Sir Nigel Sheinwald all joined </p>
<p>the discussion, which went over points from Mr Blair’s Note. </p>
<p><b>946. </b> Those attending discussed the new resolution, which would not go into detail on </p>
<p>the security agreement, but would recognise the Interim Government as sovereign, </p>
<p>formally ending the Occupation. It was anticipated that Mr Brahimi would “stand up” an </p>
<p>Interim Government at the end of May.</p>
<p><b>947. </b> Mr Blair said that it was right to handle Fallujah progressively; “slow strangulation” </p>
<p>was the right approach and would encourage some insurgents to abandon the cause. </p>
<p><b>948. </b> Mr Blair followed advice to be non-committal on the US request for the UK to </p>
<p>deploy additional troops whilst the details were considered. He said only that the UK was </p>
<p>considering what it could do to help.</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I think at the time I was worried the Americans were going in too hard and too </p>
<p>heavy, and they made certain changes as a result of the conversations we were </p>
<p>having. If I look back on it now, I’m not sure I was right about it, though.”</p>
<p>523</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>950. </b> Mr Powell also told the Inquiry that Mr Blair was very worried about a full-on </p>
<p>assault on Fallujah, and was keen that “it wasn’t done in that way”.</p>
<p>524</p>
<p> He described </p>
<p>a series of telephone calls and a meeting, and recollected that President Bush did </p>
<p>hold off and then attacked in a different way. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p><b>951. </b> Following a visit to Iraq from 4 to 15 April Mr Brahimi briefed a meeting of the </p>
<p>UN Security Council on 27 April on his ideas for the formation of the Interim Iraqi </p>
<p>Government.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> He had “previewed” some of them in a press conference before </p>
<p>returning from Iraq. </p>
<p><b>952. </b> Mr Brahimi stated that “the sooner a credible Iraqi Government is in place … </p>
<p>the better” and observed that:</p>
<p>“Between security on the one hand and the end of Occupation, the restoration of </p>
<p>sovereignty and independence and the advent of a legitimate Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>political regime on the other, there is a dialectical link that is obvious. Security is </p>
<p>essential for the [political] process to be completed.”</p>
<p><b>953. </b> The proposal outlined by Mr Brahimi was for an Interim Government with a </p>
<p>“very qualified” Prime Minister, a President and two Vice Presidents, supported by a </p>
<p>consultative assembly or council. This, he suggested, was a simple model supported by </p>
<p>most Iraqis to whom he had spoken. The key task for the Interim Government would be:</p>
<p>“… to tend to the day-to-day administration of the country in as effective and </p>
<p>efficient manner as possible, and only until such time as a democratically-elected </p>
<p>Government can be put in place.”</p>
<p><b>954. </b> Mr Brahimi suggested that the Interim Government should be selected by the Iraqi </p>
<p>people themselves through a process of meeting and consultation supported by the UN. </p>
<p>He hoped that could be completed before the end of May 2004, giving those identified a </p>
<p>month to prepare for government.</p>
<p><b>955. </b> Mr Brahimi also gave his support to a National Conference, convened by a </p>
<p>preparatory committee of “reputable and distinguished” Iraqis who were not seeking </p>
<p>elected office. The conference would “engage in a genuine national dialogue on the </p>
<p>country’s challenges”. </p>
<p><b>956. </b> On 28 April, in an update on Iraq, the JIC assessed that: </p>
<p>“… the core of anti-Coalition forces in Fallujah is based on former regime elements </p>
<p>(FRE), including former Republican Guard and Special Forces. They are well </p>
<p>organised.”</p>
<p>526</p>
<p><b>957. </b> The JIC judged that: </p>
<p>“Offensive action by Coalition Forces – particularly in Fallujah – even if well targeted </p>
<p>and limited in scale, will exacerbate a volatile security situation and cause further </p>
<p>long-term damage to Coalition objectives.”</p>

<p><b>The Fallujah Brigade</b></p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer wrote that at the end of April the US Marines sought to resolve the </p>
<p>security situation in Fallujah through the formation of the “Fallujah Brigade”.</p>
<p>527</p>
<p> This group </p>
<p>would “police the city” provided that US troops agreed to withdraw:</p>
<p>“The key assumption was that this Iraqi brigade of about 3,000 would accomplish our </p>
<p>objectives for the city by capturing or killing the insurgents and the foreign fighters.”</p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer, Dr Rice and Generals Abizaid and Sanchez had not been made </p>
<p>aware of the Brigade’s creation in advance. </p>
<p>General Jassim Mohammed Saleh, a former member of the Republican Guard, had been </p>
<p>appointed to head the Brigade.</p>
<p>528</p>
<p> Shia leaders quickly denounced this action, complaining </p>
<p>that the US was re-establishing the Saddam Hussein-era army. </p>
<p>Two days later, General Saleh was replaced by General Mohammed Latif.</p>
<p>529</p>
<p>The JIC assessed in May that General Saleh nonetheless remained in control of the </p>
<p>Fallujah Brigade.</p>
<p>530</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Iraqi National Security Council reacted angrily. Mr Ali Allawi, the Defence Minister, </p>
<p>warned of the risk of a “severe backlash amongst the Shia”, while another moderate Shia </p>
<p>member of GC added that the brigade was “a move to Iraqi disunity and civil war”.</p>
<p>531</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>958. </b> On 28 April, in an update on Iraq, the JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“Elements from the Mahdi Army are still conducting attacks across central and </p>
<p>southern Iraq, although at a much reduced level … Some reporting indicates </p>
<p>MAS [Muqtada al-Sadr] is losing support, with militants drifting away and local </p>
<p>people increasingly resentful. There are also reports that the Badr Corps may be … </p>

<p><b>959. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft with “initial advice” on the four </p>
<p>US proposals for additional UK deployments on 29 April.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> Efforts to understand the </p>
<p>proposals better had “thrown up conflicting evidence about the US thinking behind </p>
<p>these proposals and the relative priority they attach to each element”. </p>
<p><b>960. </b> The letter continued, “the Defence Secretary and the Chiefs of Staff do not </p>
<p>believe that it [the deployment of the ARRC] should be actively considered for the time </p>
<p>being” but that further consideration should be given to the feasibility of expanding </p>
<p>MND(SE). To keep options open, the planned withdrawal of Warrior vehicles was being </p>
<p>halted and a recce team was being deployed to Iraq to give detailed consideration  </p>
<p>to the options. </p>
<p><b>961. </b> The letter also reflected Mr Hoon’s view that:</p>
<p>“… any significant increase in our military commitment in Iraq would need to be </p>
<p>considered in the context of the whole cross-Government effort … if we were to </p>
<p>take on Najaf and Qadisiyah we would need FCO and DFID to help ensure that </p>
<p>acceptable arrangements are in place on the CPA (and post-CPA) side …”</p>
<p><b>962. </b> In a letter to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 30 April, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary </p>
<p>outlined Mr Brahimi’s plans to return to Iraq swiftly to continue consultations on forming </p>
<p>the Interim Government.</p>
<p>534</p>
<p> He remained confident of completing the task by 31 May. </p>
<p><b>963. </b> A particular issue was the future role of the GC since any arrangements for them </p>
<p>to continue to have a role would have to be formalised in an annex to the TAL, to </p>
<p>which the GC were co-signatories. The FCO suggested that one solution might be to </p>
<p>guarantee any GC members without positions in the Interim Government seats in the </p>
<p>Consultative Assembly. </p>
<p><b>964. </b> The same letter addressed the UN Security Council resolution being drafted by the </p>
<p>US and UK. The UN was believed to be:</p>
<p>“… keen to use the Resolution to clarify their role, but also to downplay expectations </p>
<p>that they can, and will, take over from the CPA after 30 June. Their focus is on </p>
<p>taking forward the elections process … They are reluctant to resume large-scale </p>
<p>humanitarian operations until the security situation is clearer.” </p>

<p><b>Abu Ghraib</b></p>
<p>In late April, allegations of abuse by Coalition soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison became public. </p>
<p>The Coalition, including the UK military, had been aware of the existence of these </p>
<p>allegations earlier in the year; on 16 January General Sanchez issued a statement saying </p>
<p>that he had ordered an investigation into abuse at an unnamed Coalition facility.</p>
<p>535</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Stewart told the Inquiry that he had been aware of the allegations from </p>
<p>early 2004.</p>
<p>536</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Charges were brought against six US soldiers in March 2004, but the details of the story </p>
<p>did not become public until late April, when the US television programme <i>60 Minutes II</i> </p>
<p>ran a story documenting the abuses and showing some of the pictures taken by the </p>
<p>soldiers involved.</p>
<p>537</p>
<p>Maj Gen Stewart was one of several witnesses who told<i> </i>the Inquiry that the pictures of </p>
<p>Abu Ghraib had had a “significant effect” on MND(SE), where the public began turning </p>
<p>against Coalition Forces.</p>
<p>538</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Allegations of abuse of Iraqi detainees by British Service Personnel also began to emerge </p>
<p>in early 2004. Almost immediately following the Abu Ghraib revelations, on 1 May the </p>
<p><i>Daily Mirror</i> published photographs which appeared to show UK troops torturing an Iraqi </p>
<p>detainee.</p>
<p>539</p>
<p> It was later established that those photographs were fake. </p>
<p>The photographs and accounts of events at Abu Ghraib generated a wave of </p>
<p>“shock and anger” across the world, along with repeated calls for the resignation of </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>540</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a telephone conversation with Mr Straw on 30 April, Secretary Powell said that he had:</p>
<p>“… taken Condi and Andy Card aside and said that there was nothing in the world of </p>
<p>public diplomacy which could conceivably offset the unbelievable damage done by </p>
<p>these images to the US cause, the reputation of its armed forces, and its standing in </p>
<p>the Arab world and beyond.”</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Iraq, a poll by the Independent Institute for Administration and Civil Society Studies </p>
<p>in May 2004 found that confidence in Coalition Forces had dropped to 10 percent, from </p>
<p>28 percent in January 2004. Some 55 percent of those polled said they would feel more </p>
<p>safe if Coalition Forces left immediately; 54 percent said that they believed all Americans </p>
<p>behaved in the same way as the abusers at Abu Ghraib.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>Cabinet discussed prisoner abuse on 6 May, when Mr Blair told attendees that allegations </p>
<p>against British troops were being investigated fully.</p>
<p>543</p>
<p> In discussion, Cabinet members </p>
<p>observed that the damage done by pictures of mistreatment would be hard to repair </p>
<p>and that condemnation of the behaviour, if it was confirmed, had to be “clear and </p>
<p>uncompromising”. </p>
<p>A more detailed discussion followed on 13 May.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p> Ms Hewitt told Cabinet that the </p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross’s interim report on detention in Iraq was a </p>
<p>“shaming document”. Mr Hoon observed that the report covered Coalition Forces as </p>
<p>a whole; only three cases related to British forces, each of which had been “properly </p>
<p>investigated and action taken”. </p>
<p>In discussion, it was suggested that more emphasis should be placed on the “distinctive </p>
<p>British approach” to the UN, the region, MEPP and actions in Iraq. Summing up the </p>
<p>meeting, Mr Blair said that the UK’s intention was to engage with the ICRC to ensure that </p>
<p>actions were in complete conformity with the Geneva Conventions. </p>
<p>In the run up to the US Presidential Election in 2004, <i>The Guardian</i> judged that “for the </p>
<p>first time, the US is seen by majorities in many countries, especially by younger Muslims, </p>
<p>as a potential enemy rather than a friend … the Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib abuse </p>
<p>scandals have further damaged America’s standing abroad”.</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>Assessing the impact in 2009, CNN’s Senior Editor for Middle East Affairs wrote “the </p>
<p>United States was already unpopular in the Arab world, mainly because of its war in Iraq. </p>
<p>After Abu Ghraib in most quarters, it became despised with a vengeance.”</p>
<p>546</p>
<p>Dr Rice, writing in her 2011 memoir, observed “we never recovered fully from </p>
<p>Abu Ghraib”.</p>

<p>In response, the UK increased the rank of the SBMR-I who would also serve as </p>
<p>deputy commander. </p>
<p>Lieutenant General John McColl deployed in April 2004 and served as both SBMR-I and </p>
<p>the deputy commander in first CJTF-7 and subsequently MNF-I until October 2004.</p>
<p>551</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A further three-star military command was established underneath MNF-I: the Multi-</p>
<p>National Corps – Iraq (MNC-I). This was headed by a US three-star General, Lieutenant </p>
<p>General Thomas Metz.</p>
<p>552</p>
<p> The deputy commander was a two-star British officer. Under the </p>
<p>new structures, divisional commanders reported to Lt Gen Metz.</p>
<p>A second three-star headquarters was created to focus on security sector reform: Multi-</p>

<p><b>966. </b> In discussion, Mr Brahimi agreed that security in Iraq was key, observing that it was </p>
<p>difficult to understand in what proportions the insurgency was made up of foreigners, </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein loyalists and Iraqi nationalists. </p>
<p><b>967. </b> Mr Brahimi thought that the UN’s role would be focused on the electoral process </p>
<p>after 30 June. Sir Nigel Sheinwald indicated that the UK envisaged a “substantial role </p>
<p>for the UN” working to co-ordinate reconstruction as well as in Iraqi ministries and </p>
<p>as a political guide to the Interim Government. During his discussion with Mr Straw, </p>
<p>Mr Brahimi indicated that he thought the UN had already had a positive impact in </p>
<p>managing the future expectations of the Governing Council.</p>
<p>554</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>968. </b> On the planned resolution, Mr Brahimi proposed that it should be discussed in </p>

<p>555</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>970. </b> The proposal they were to discuss was for the UK to take on two additional Iraqi </p>

<p><b>973. </b> Sir Nigel expected that the MOD would write to No.10 in two or three days’ time, </p>
<p>after the Chiefs had made a recommendation to the Defence Secretary. </p>
<p><b>974. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 May that US military commanders had changed </p>
<p>their attitude to solving the problem posed by Fallujah, by recruiting Iraqis to do the </p>
<p>policing.</p>
<p>556</p>
<p> Repeating this approach in other towns where there was violent opposition to </p>
<p>the Coalition could help to calm the security situation. Violent opposition to the Coalition </p>
<p>would have to be dealt with but it was important to show that “everything reasonable” </p>
<p>had been done to avoid bloodshed. </p>
<p><b>975. </b> In discussion, members of Cabinet said that the UK had influenced the change </p>

<p>“… the insurgents are getting bolder, in part because although British forces have </p>
<p>returned fire when under attack they have done so primarily to enable their own safe </p>
<p>extraction, leaving most of the insurgents free to fight another day.”</p>
<p><b>979. </b> The violence continued into the following week and was not limited to al-Amara. </p>

<p>560</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>983. </b> Mr Sawers judged that “however messy the compromise that emerged, it was </p>
<p>better than a US onslaught that would have flattened parts of the city”. </p>
<p><b>984. </b> He had learned that:</p>
<p>“… at least half of the … Fallujah Brigade were recruited from the ranks of the </p>
<p>insurgents who had been fighting the American forces in the previous three weeks. </p>
<p>Their motivations may vary – some were almost certainly regime elements, others </p>
<p>might have been local youths joining what they thought of as patriotic resistance to </p>
<p>defend their town. But either way, the idea that the Falljuah Brigade would now turn </p>
<p>on the insurgents in the city was fanciful.” </p>
<p><b>985. </b> Mr Sawers emphasised the advice of “political figures” he had met in Iraq that the </p>
<p>Fallujah Brigade must be dissolved or dispersed amongst other units. </p>
<p><b>986. </b> In his report to Mr Straw of the same visit, Mr Sawers wrote:</p>
<p>“The last month has taken a heavy toll, and our Iraqi allies were all depressed. </p>
<p>The onslaught on Fallujah, the messy compromise to restore calm there … the </p>
<p>clumsy handling of Muqtada al-Sadr, the pictures from Abu Ghraib prison, and US </p>
<p>talk of ‘partial sovereignty’ have had a cumulative effect, denting Coalition morale, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>370</p>
<p><b>989. </b> Mr Blair proposed refocusing effort onto the security situation and the political </p>
<p>process. He emphasised the need for the Iraqi people to take responsibility for policing </p>
<p>and security and pointed to Fallujah where this was already happening. He believed that </p>
<p>if problems arose there in the future, Iraqi forces would be in the forefront of the fighting </p>
<p>and the Coalition would be protected. </p>
<p><b>990. </b> The discussion also covered the political process. Mr Blair emphasised the </p>
<p>importance of a genuine transfer of sovereignty and proposed that after the transfer, </p>
<p>security decisions should be taken by a National Security Council, incorporating Iraqi </p>
<p>ministers and military leaders, commanders of the Multi-National Force and the UN. </p>
<p><b>991. </b> Mr Blair also proposed timing the creation of the new Iraqi government, the new </p>

<p>would show that there was a clear plan and direction.</p>
<p><b>992. </b> The following day, Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote to Dr Rice, setting out more detail </p>
<p>of the sequence of events envisaged by Mr Blair, for discussion.</p>
<p>563</p>

<p>set out was:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>accelerating the transfer of sovereignty, as had been suggested by one US interlocutor, </p>
<p>but concluded it would be logistically difficult and could give the impression of panic. </p>

<p><b>996. </b> To provide some context for the debate, Lt Gen Fry sent a paper on the </p>
<p>consequences and risks of strategic failure in Iraq to Gen Walker, copied to  </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit.</p>
<p>565</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>997. </b> Lt Gen Fry judged that failure in Iraq was so unthinkable to the US Administration </p>
<p>that they would “continue to provide sufficient force elements” to prevent it. As a </p>
<p>consequence:</p>
<p>“The issue of the UK acceding to the US request for extra support is therefore </p>
<p>not considered to be essential in mitigating the risk of circumstances leading to </p>
<p>total withdrawal.”</p>
<p><b>998. </b> Lt Gen Fry explained that whilst it was not likely that the US would allow a security </p>
<p>vacuum to develop if the UK did not take on the two additional provinces, expanding the </p>
<p>UK sector might allow US forces to re-deploy to the centre of Iraq. This could “remove </p>
<p>some sensitive Shia areas from the risk of purely kinetic solutions” by US forces, and </p>
<p>allow the “UK approach” to “help to improve Shia consent across a more uniform area”.</p>
<p><b>999. </b> Lt Gen Fry concluded:</p>
<p>“… we consider that UK accession to the US requests for military support will not, </p>
<p>in itself, guarantee the achievement of SSC [Steady State Criteria] – even if we </p>
<p>met those requests in full. Nor can we say categorically that our refusal so to do </p>
<p>will seriously impede progress, or irrevocably fracture the Coalition. The question </p>
<p>remains more as to whether we can afford to take the risk of not doing so with the </p>
<p>concomitant chance of further deterioration, and failure to extract our forces in the </p>
<p>medium or long term.”</p>
<p><b>1000. </b> Gen Walker told Lt Gen Fry that his paper had been “v helpful in focusing minds </p>
<p>on this issue”.</p>
<p><b>1001. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting on 13 May to discuss security in Iraq.</p>
<p>566</p>
<p> Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>Mr John Prescott (the Deputy Prime Minister), Mr Scarlett, Gen Walker, Sir Michael Jay, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry, Mr Powell, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and other No.10 and Cabinet Office staff </p>
<p>were present. </p>
<p><b>1002. </b> Mr Scarlett explained that attacks against the Coalition (500 per week) were less </p>
<p>frequent than in April (when they had reached 800 per week) but significantly higher than </p>
<p>the position at the start of the year (200 per week). He said that:</p>
<p>“Fallujah was calm following the insertion of the Iraqi manned Fallujah Brigade … </p>
<p>Attacks on the oil terminals and pipelines posed a strategic threat, as did sustained </p>
<p>disruption of the main supply routes. In Najaf, Muqtada al-Sadr was isolated and </p>

<p>politically weak, and his activity was inspiring intra-Shia tension. The foreign fighters </p>
<p>under the leadership of al-Zarqawi … were planning big and widespread attacks in </p>
<p>the run up to the Transition, including against the Shia.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1003. </b> Mr Hoon observed that in Iraq violence was now being used for internal political </p>
<p>ends and not solely against the Coalition. </p>
<p><b>1004. </b> Mr Blair expressed a clear view there were two key issues in Iraq: the political </p>
<p>process and security, of which security was “fundamental”. In his view the solution was:</p>
<p>“… a better and quicker plan for building Iraqi capacity in the Police, Civil Defence </p>
<p>Corps, the Army and the Intelligence Service. Although the numbers were </p>
<p>increasing … Iraqi security forces were not equipped, trained or led to provide the </p>
<p>necessary capacity.” </p>
<p><b>1005. </b> After the transfer of sovereignty, Mr Blair felt that Iraqis would be reluctant to  </p>
<p>ask the Coalition to manage security for them and this “put a real premium  </p>
<p>on building capacity urgently”. He intended to meet Lt Gen Petraeus, and asked for  </p>
<p>“a detailed proposition to improve Iraqiisation” to inform a subsequent discussion  </p>
<p>with President Bush. </p>
<p><b>1006. </b> Mr Hoon suggested that it was possible for the UK to “demonstrate a good model </p>
<p>of how this should be done, as in southern Iraq”. Gen Walker indicated that “handing </p>
<p>over security to local control in the South would be under way in June”.</p>
<p><b>1007. </b> Mr Blair asked about the request to increase UK troops being considered by </p>
<p>the MOD. Gen Walker explained that a substantial reinforcement would take the </p>
<p>Armed Forces well beyond their planning guidelines. The Chiefs of Staff would make </p>
<p>recommendations the following week:</p>
<p>“… against three strategic yardsticks: solidarity with the Coalition; increased </p>
<p>influence over the Coalition campaign in Iraq; and enhanced control over the </p>
<p>handling of the Shia.” </p>
<p><b>1008. </b> Mr Blair concluded the meeting by commissioning from the MOD:</p>
<p>“… their best proposals for enhancing Iraqi security capability across the whole </p>
<p>country … cover[ing] the police, the ICDC, the army and the Intelligence Service.”</p>
<p><b>1009. </b> On the same day as Mr Blair’s meeting on security, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent </p>
<p>Dr Rice a paper written by the Cabinet Office on security structures in Iraq after the </p>
<p>handover of sovereignty.</p>
<p>567</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1010. </b> It proposed the creation of an ‘NSC+’ to bring together Iraqi ministers, the </p>

<p>Representative in a group chaired by the Iraqi Prime Minister. ‘NSC+’ would operate on </p>
<p>the principle that:</p>
<p>“Before taking actions that directly affect the operational activities or security of the </p>
<p>other force, they should undertake consultations and agree a way forward.”</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> A Military Co-ordination Committee would undertake “formal co-ordination”, </p>
<p>supported by liaison officers in each HQ. The Cabinet Office paper proposed that initially </p>
<p>Iraqi forces would be assigned to work with the MNF, and be under their operational </p>
<p>control. The arrangements would be described by an exchange of letters between the </p>
<p>Iraqi Defence Minister and the Commander of the MNF. </p>
<p><b>1012. </b> On 14 May, there was “intense fighting” outside al-Amara “in which around </p>
<p>20 members of the militia were killed and others detained”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> The following day the Chief of Police for Majar al-Kabir was shot dead.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1014. </b> In his book <i>Occupational Hazards</i>, Mr Rory Stewart, the CPA’s Deputy </p>
<p>Governorate Co-ordinator in Maysan, suggested there might have been a link between </p>
<p>the Chief of Police’s murder and the fighting of the previous day:</p>
<p>“The police chief of Majar, who was from Badr, met the Prince [Karim Mahmood </p>
<p>Hattab, brother of the Governor of Maysan] … The Prince accused the police chief </p>
<p>of warning the Coalition of the ambush and held the police chief responsible for </p>
<p>the deaths of these men, who were from the Prince’s tribe. There was a heated </p>
<p>argument … The police chief was shot dead. Many claimed Governor Riyadh </p>
<p>[the Governor of Maysan] had killed him.”</p>
<p><b>The Battle of Danny Boy</b></p>
<p>The incident outside al-Amara on 14 May became known as the “Battle of Danny Boy”.</p>
<p>570</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were subsequent allegations that, following the incident, UK soldiers unlawfully </p>
<p>killed and mistreated a number of detainees.</p>
<p>571</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Government announced on 25 November 2009 that it was establishing the  </p>
<p>Al Sweady Public Inquiry to look into these allegations. It published its conclusions on  </p>
<p>17 December 2014.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>374</p>
<p><b>1016. </b> On 17 May, the President of the GC for that month, Mr Ezzadine Salim, was killed </p>
<p>by a car bomb in Baghdad, along with five other Iraqi civilians.</p>
<p>573</p>
<p><b>1017. </b> On 18 May Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note from Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush, in advance of their regular video conference two days later.</p>
<p>574</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1018. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the coming few weeks were the last chance to move things </p>
<p>into place before the new Iraqi government took power. The key dilemma was the </p>
<p>tension between the political imperative to give the new government full sovereignty and </p>
<p>the security situation, which suggested a need for a robust international presence.  </p>
<p>In Mr Blair’s judgement the political imperative took precedence. Iraqi consent to the </p>
<p>continued presence of the MNF was a key issue for the new resolution. </p>
<p><b>1019. </b> Mr Blair proposed the following timetable:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Week commencing 24 May: Mr Brahimi announces the President, Vice </p>
<p>Presidents and Prime Minister. An Iraqi Electoral Commission is appointed. </p>
<p>The US and UK suggest the resolution is close to being agreed. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Brahimi convenes a round table from across Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Week commencing 31 May: Iraqi Prime Minister sets out his plan for Iraq in </p>
<p>New York. The new resolution is adopted. The US/UK and the Iraqi Prime </p>
<p>Minister publish a plan for Iraqiisation of security forces. </p>
<p><b>1020. </b> On Iraqi security forces, Mr Blair acknowledged that although numbers had </p>
<p>risen, quality needed to be addressed, including by supporting a cadre of Iraqi leaders. </p>
<p>In Mr Blair’s view there was no alternative to a discriminating rather than indiscriminate </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification policy. </p>
<p><b>1021. </b> Mr Blair’s Note also proposed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>better protection of oil and power installations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more help for al-Iraqiya (the Iraqi Government-sponsored broadcaster) and high </p>
<p>quality media support for the new Iraqi Prime Minister; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>replicating the basic concept of the Fallujah Brigade elsewhere; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the Coalition should produce at least an approximate figure of civilian </p>
<p>casualties, rather than leave figures being published by NGOs unchallenged. </p>
<p><b>1022. </b> Sir Nigel and Dr Rice spoke on the telephone during the evening of 18 May.</p>

<p>375</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> Dr Rice indicated US agreement with the sequence of events proposed by </p>
<p>the UK, including for the new resolution, on which Sir Nigel emphasised the need to </p>
<p>maintain momentum by sharing draft text (except on security arrangements). They </p>
<p>agreed to plan on the basis of an event in New York around 3 June, to be attended by </p>
<p>the new Iraqi Prime Minister, at which the resolution would be adopted. This fitted with </p>
<p>the proposal, supported by the French and others, to conclude the resolution before the </p>
<p>anniversary of the Normandy landings. </p>
<p><b>1024. </b> The following day Mr Crompton wrote to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary to say that </p>
<p>diplomatic reporting from Washington suggested Secretary Powell was not convinced </p>
<p>of the need to adopt the resolution in early June.</p>
<p>576</p>
<p> His preference was to await </p>
<p>Mr Brahimi’s conclusions on the make-up of the Interim Government, and incorporate </p>
<p>them into the resolution. </p>
<p><b>1025. </b> Sir David Manning had also reported from Washington that Ambassador </p>
<p>Negroponte was resisting the call to share text with other Security Council members </p>
<p>quickly, preferring to wait for complete agreement between US agencies on the text  </p>
<p>as a whole.</p>
<p>577</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1026. </b> Mr Crompton wrote that there was a “broad degree of consensus” between </p>
<p>Security Council members on the main points for the resolution, including that the detail </p>
<p>of security arrangements should be dealt with by exchange of letters.</p>
<p>578</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1027. </b> On the security arrangements:</p>
<p>“The major stumbling block is continued US insistence on a unified chain of </p>
<p>command. Politically, we see the need for an independent Iraqi chain of command </p>
<p>… Iraqis could voluntarily agree to assign troops to MNF for particular operations, </p>
<p>through agreed co-ordination mechanisms.” </p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Mr Crompton endorsed a recommendation from Sir David Manning that Mr Straw </p>
<p>should call Mr Powell to resolve the problem. If it proved intractable, he suggested that </p>
<p>consideration should be given to sharing the draft text as “UK alone”. </p>
<p><b>1029. </b> The fourth and final update to the UN by the UK and US took place on 19 May.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A Security Council press release quoted Ambassador James Cunningham, for the </p>
<p>US, saying that: “30 June would mark a vital step towards realizing the goal of an </p>
<p>independent and stable Iraq” and that he:</p>

<p>“… the last three months had seen many challenges, including attempts to deny </p>
<p>Iraqis the opportunity to rebuild their country. Despite the difficult circumstances on </p>

<p><b>1031. </b> On 19 May, the FCO Iraq Directorate wrote a paper entitled ‘Iraq: The Medium </p>
<p>Term’, attached to which were key messages and facts for use by Cabinet Ministers.</p>
<p>580</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Private Secretary sent it to the Private Secretaries of all members of the </p>
<p>Cabinet as an “information note”. </p>
<p><b>1032. </b> In the note, the UK’s strategic objective in Iraq was defined as “a democratic, </p>
<p>stable and prosperous Iraq, that poses no threat to its neighbours”. </p>
<p><b>1033. </b> Under the heading “Strategy” the Iraq Directorate listed what was needed to </p>
<p>overcome the obstacles to achieving the strategic objectives:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establishing the right security architecture after 30 June;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqiisation of the security forces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “more flexible approach towards co-operation with existing militias”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>minimising the profile of Coalition Forces;</p>

<p>ensuring “a sensible and sensitive US approach to military operations”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>possible UK reinforcement in southern Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining pressure on Iraq’s neighbours regarding border security; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued consultation with Coalition partners. </p>
<p><b>1034. </b> On the political process, the Iraq Directorate recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to support Mr Brahimi in establishing a fully sovereign Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring successful negotiation of a UN Security Council resolution; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring a constructive international conference later in 2004; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the UN to prepare for elections in January 2005. </p>

<p><b>1035. </b> The Iraq Directorate concluded “this is an intense agenda across a series of </p>
<p>complex inter-related problems, with security at their heart … The task is considerable; </p>
<p>the stakes are high; but it is imperative that we succeed.”</p>
<p><b>1036. </b> An FCO briefing for Cabinet, circulated on 19 May, cautioned that members </p>
<p>should not “under-estimate the present difficulties”.</p>
<p>581</p>
<p> There were signs of better </p>
<p>organisation by insurgents and a reservoir of popular support in both Sunni and Shia </p>
<p>areas in reaction to US military intervention in Fallujah and Najaf, with the fighting </p>
<p>spreading to MND(SE). These security difficulties were slowing reconstruction and </p>
<p>affecting Iraqi confidence in the Coalition.</p>
<p><b>1037. </b> The Chiefs of Staff considered the US request for additional UK military assets </p>
<p>to Iraq on 19 May.</p>
<p>582</p>
<p> Although they recognised there were risks and benefits in all the </p>
<p>possible options, they agreed that the “best military option” was the deployment of both </p>
<p>HQ ARRC to command both MND(CS) and MND(SE) and a Brigade to replace US </p>
<p>forces in the provinces of Najaf and Qadisiyah although Gen Walker stated that “there </p>
<p>was current doubt whether it could be delivered and sustained”. </p>
<p><b>1038. </b> On 20 May, Mr Blair told Cabinet that he was hopeful of getting “the right result” </p>
<p>from the UN, although time was short and the Russians and French may cause some </p>
<p>difficulties.</p>
<p>583</p>
<p> A UN blessing for the political process would give the new leaders more </p>

<p><b>1042. </b> The JIC judged that “the current level of violence threatens to de-rail Coalition </p>
<p>political objectives in Iraq after 30 June”. It assessed that:</p>
<p>“The immediate threat from Muqtada al-Sadr has been partly contained but not </p>
<p>resolved. Further flare-ups, on a potentially large scale, can be expected. Al-Sadr </p>
<p>remains a threat to Shia-Coalition relations: his death or capture could provoke </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>378</p>
<p><b>1043. </b> The JIC reported that Coalition Forces continued operations against Muqtada </p>
<p>al-Sadr’s forces in Karbala and Najaf throughout May, but had not yet gained control of </p>
<p>Najaf. Negotiations continued but were judged by the JIC to be “slow, opaque and so far </p>
<p>fruitless”. Growing local opposition was reported in Najaf. </p>
<p><b>1044. </b> On Fallujah, the Assessment said:</p>
<p>“The Fallujah Brigade is a local expedient. Unless integrated into the Iraqi national </p>
<p>forces’ structure, it risks entrenching sectarian division in the forces creating </p>
<p>problems downstream for the new Iraqi government and the Coalition.” </p>
<p><b>1045. </b> Maj Gen Stewart requested additional troops to provide both force protection and </p>
<p>a mobile reserve in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>586</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1046. </b> On 25 May, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft setting out the </p>
<p>rationale for the request. He wrote:</p>
<p>“Irrespective of the decisions we reach on the commitment of UK forces to Southern </p>
<p>Iraq as a whole … We should meet this request.” </p>
<p><b>1047. </b> Taken alongside the planned withdrawal of another battalion, Maj Gen Stewart’s </p>
<p>request amounted to a net increase of around 550 UK troops. The request was made </p>
<p>“against the background of the recent difficulties … particularly around al-Amara”. </p>
<p><b>1048. </b> The letter reported Mr Hoon’s view that this request should be separate from </p>
<p>consideration of the broader US request to take responsibility for additional provinces. </p>
<p><b>1049. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote a second letter to Mr Rycroft on 25 May, </p>
<p>explaining the advice of the Chiefs of Staff on the US request for additional UK troops.</p>
<p>587</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1050. </b> In view of the pressure that the additional deployment would put on the Armed </p>
<p>Forces, the Chiefs recommended staging the reinforcement, deploying first the HQ </p>
<p>ARRC and ensuring that there was a brigade ready to deploy if required, but holding it </p>
<p>back until absolutely necessary. </p>
<p><b>1051. </b> The letter also suggested that it could prove difficult to explain the additional </p>
<p>deployment, both to Parliament (which might doubt whether the numbers involved </p>
<p>were sufficient to achieve the strategic effort required) and to the Armed Forces more </p>
<p>widely, given “the starkly conflicting messages of an increase in commitment, alongside </p>
<p>the emergent view in the public domain of sizeable adjustments downwards in our </p>
<p>force structures”.</p>

<p><b>1052. </b> On 26 May, the JIC provided its assessment of the prospects for security in the </p>
<p>Centre South region, in light of the potential deployment of UK troops there.</p>
<p>588</p>
<p> Among its </p>
<p>Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I. Centre South is a more volatile region than the South East and a nexus of </p>
<p>intricate Shia politics. The security challenge is also more complex, and UK forces </p>
<p>deployed into Centre South could face a somewhat greater level of risk than </p>
<p>experienced in the South East …</p>
<p>II. Good relations with Shia leaders, principally the Hawza, are a key requirement for </p>
<p>maintaining Shia consent. A successful extension of British influence to the Centre </p>
<p>South could bring greater consistency of policy and therefore stability to the Shia </p>
<p>areas as a whole. </p>
<p>III. Al-Sadr’s political isolation appears to be deepening. But if he is killed or captured </p>
<p>by Coalition Forces further, potentially widespread, violence is likely. In any case, </p>
<p>some Mahdi Army militants will continue to attack the Coalition and represent a </p>
<p>long-term threat.”</p>
<p><b>1053. </b> The JIC considered that, in the short term, the Iraqi security forces would be </p>
<p>unable to cope with a determined armed challenge without the help of Coalition Forces. </p>
<p><b>1054. </b> On 26 May, Mr Richmond reported that JAM fighters seemed to be returning </p>
<p>to Baghdad, and had withdrawn from Karbala.</p>
<p>589</p>
<p> The Shia leadership had contacted </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr, who had offered to withdraw from Najaf and all government buildings, </p>
<p>allowing the Iraqi Security Forces to return. His condition was that the Coalition should </p>
<p>also withdraw from Najaf and put the legal case against him on hold until there was a </p>
<p>sovereign Iraqi government. </p>
<p><b>1055. </b> The CPA responded that efforts should be made to secure an undertaking that </p>
<p>JAM would disarm and dissolve as well as withdraw. </p>
<p><b>1056. </b> On 27 May, Mr Blair met Mr Hoon, Mr Straw, Mr Benn, Gen Walker and others to </p>
<p>discuss the Chiefs’ advice on the US request for additional UK troops.</p>
<p>590</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1057. </b> Mr Rycroft’s record of the meeting shows that Mr Blair agreed that Mr Hoon </p>
<p>should announce the uplift for MND(SE), and that:</p>
<p>“… there was a short discussion – but no decisions – on the options for a UK military </p>
<p>contribution to the wider South … The Prime Minister said that of course we must do </p>
<p>what was necessary for the success of the overall mission in Iraq. These operational </p>
<p>military judgements must take precedence over any political considerations.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>1058. </b> It was agreed that Ministers would discuss the question again on 3 June. Mr Blair </p>
<p>reiterated his request for a “full, detailed plan on Iraqi-isation of security forces” in time </p>
<p>for the meeting. </p>
<p><b>1059. </b> Mr Hoon told Cabinet on 27 May that the British divisional commander in Basra </p>
<p>had requested a “modest reinforcement”, consistent with the policy of keeping force </p>
<p>levels under review.</p>
<p>591</p>
<p> The reinforcement would involve about 600 additional troops. In </p>
<p>discussion, the point was made that consideration of a more substantial reinforcement in </p>
<p>Iraq was continuing. </p>
<p><b>1060. </b> Mr Hoon told Parliament later on 27 May that a further 370</p>
<p>592</p>
<p> troops would deploy </p>
<p>to Iraq in response to Maj Gen Stewart’s request for MND(SE), bringing “the total of UK </p>
<p>forces in Iraq to about 8,900”.</p>
<p>593</p>
<p><b>1061. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit was not present at Mr Blair’s meeting on 27 May, but when he </p>
<p>saw the record of the discussion he expressed concern that Ministers and their advisers </p>
<p>might have been talking at cross-purposes.</p>
<p>594</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1062. </b> In a minute to Mr Hoon he suggested that the record of the meeting:</p>
<p>“… read as if the Prime Minister was in danger of believing that the options </p>
<p>developed are based on operational military judgements of what is needed for </p>
<p>the success of the overall mission, when it can equally be argued that they are </p>
<p>operational military judgements of how best to proceed if Ministers decide there is </p>
<p>an overriding political need to do more.” </p>
<p><b>1063. </b> Sir Kevin argued that the 25 May letter to Mr Rycroft on the US request had </p>
<p>represented the Chiefs’ advice on what “could” be done if Ministers wished something </p>
<p>to be done, rather than what “needed” to be done for purely military purposes. His own </p>
<p>view was that no final decisions should be taken on additional UK deployments until </p>
<p>after agreement had been reached on the future role of Coalition troops in Iraq following </p>
<p>the transfer of sovereignty. He also took the view that no further military contribution </p>
<p>should be considered without a reassurance that the FCO and DFID could put their own </p>
<p>resources in as well “to help produce the broader security result”. </p>
<p><b>1064. </b> Mr Hoon annotated the minute “I agree with this – what would be the Chiefs’ </p>
<p>advice on what needs to be done?”</p>
<p><b>1065. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 26 May, Mr Blair supported an idea </p>
<p>from Mr Brahimi that Iraqi Ministers should present to the UN when the new resolution </p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 27 May 2004. </p>

<p>595</p>
<p> There were some shared concerns about French and Russian support </p>
<p>for the resolution. </p>
<p><b>1066. </b> Mr Blair also reported positively on moves to provide media support to the new </p>
<p>Iraqi Prime Minister, and suggested that more Iraqi voices speaking positively about </p>
<p>what the Coalition had achieved, and planned to achieve, were needed. </p>
<p><b>1067. </b> In the next video conference with President Bush, on 30 May, Mr Blair hoped that </p>
<p>the new resolution, which made clear that full sovereignty was being transferred, could </p>
<p>be tabled on 1 June, and voted on a day or two later.</p>
<p>596</p>
<p> The resolution should not include </p>
<p>the necessity for the sovereign Iraqi Government to ‘opt in’ to the continued presence </p>
<p>of the MNF after the election. Ideally, members of the Interim Government should be </p>
<p>present in New York as the resolution was discussed. </p>
<p><b>1068. </b> Mr Blair said that he intended to speak to Lt Gen Petraeus, as the Iraqiisation of </p>
<p>security was critical. </p>
<p><b>1069. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald called Dr Rice to follow up the discussion.</p>
<p>597</p>
<p> It was clear </p>
<p>that President Bush was pushing for the resolution to be tabled swiftly.They agreed to </p>
<p>suggest to Ambassador Bremer/Mr Richmond that the new Iraqi Prime Minister might be </p>
<p>prompted to call for a swift Security Council resolution soon after his appointment. </p>
<p><b>The Impact of events in spring 2004 </b></p>
<p>Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… spring of 2004, March, April, May, was one of the low points in managing Iraq </p>
<p>policy at the London end. We had … the crises in Fallujah first … We had the crisis in </p>
<p>Najaf. We had the Abu Ghraib facilities …</p>
<p>“I visited Iraq in early May and it was the gloomiest and most downbeat visit that I </p>
<p>paid … And I think it was then that we realised the scale of the task ahead of us and </p>
<p>the need to really put our heads down and be in it for the longer term, because the </p>
<p>insurgency and violence was clearly not at a peak and it was clearly going to get </p>
<p>worse at that stage. And the Abu Ghraib issues just added another nasty twist to the </p>
<p>difficulties that we faced.”</p>
<p>598</p>
<p>Sir John’s view of spring 2004 as a significant moment for the Coalition was shared by </p>
<p>Lord Turnbull, who told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“For me, the turning point in all this was the capture and the murder and the burning </p>
<p>of the American engineers [in Fallujah] and then their bodies are hung up on the</p>

<p> bridge. That – suddenly I thought, ‘This is really not going well’. You know, we have </p>
<p>really hit something very, very serious at this point …”</p>
<p>599</p>
<p>Mr Rycroft described April/May 2004 to the Inquiry as “an ongoing very difficult moment” </p>
<p>and recalled a sense of increasing “exasperation from the Prime Minister that even though </p>
<p>he felt he understood what needed to be done, it wasn’t being done”.</p>
<p>600</p>
<p>For the Civil Service, Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that Abu Ghraib prompted a feeling that </p>
<p>it was “kind of sullied, kind of disgraced”.</p>
<p>601</p>
<p>Mr Edward Chaplin told the Inquiry that it took a long time for the Coalition’s image to </p>
<p>recover from the Abu Ghraib scandal:</p>
<p>“… as regards opinion in the Arab world, which was probably the most critical </p>
<p>factor … the television images replayed again and again and I think did damage, </p>
<p>certainly”.</p>
<p>602</p>
<p>The impact of Abu Ghraib was also felt by the UK military. Lt Gen Figgures told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that as a result of the revelations:</p>
<p>“A major prop of a campaign, the winning of the consent of the Iraqi people, had been </p>
<p>given a savage knock …</p>
<p>“So it was a severe blow to our ability to prosecute the campaign.”</p>
<p>603</p>
<p>Maj Gen Andrew Stewart said “Abu Ghraib had a significant effect on us in terms of </p>
<p>people – the public turning against us.”</p>
<p>604</p>
<p>Mr Hoon told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… those kinds of revelations simply demonstrated that we were perceived by still </p>
<p>more of the population as being occupiers, as being foreign, as being the enemy, </p>
<p>and that necessarily made it harder to keep people on side in terms of hearts and </p>
<p>minds”.</p>
<p>605</p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he was “shocked and angry” after seeing photographs of the </p>
<p>conditions in Abu Ghraib for the first time.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> He judged that “these pictures and the abuse </p>
<p>of prisoners was going to be vital propaganda for our enemies”.</p>
<p>Sir David Omand told the Inquiry that Fallujah and Abu Ghraib “played directly into the </p>
<p>radical extremist propaganda” which increased the level of jihadist activity in the UK.</p>

<p><b>Appointing the Iraqi Interim Government </b></p>
<p>The RAND report describes Mr Brahimi, assisted by Ambassadors Bremer and Blackwill, </p>
<p>carrying out a large number of consultations with members of the GC and other notable </p>
<p>Iraqis, with the aim of securing agreement on the composition of an Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government.</p>
<p>608</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the first person he suggested for Prime Minister was rejected by the US, Mr Brahimi </p>
<p>then suggested Dr Ayad Allawi, who was enthusiastically received. Dr Allawi, a secular </p>
<p>Shia Muslim and leader of the Iraqi National Accord (INA), had been in exile in London </p>
<p>during most of Saddam Hussein’s regime. </p>
<p>Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that Mr Brahimi had made use of the knowledge </p>
<p>acquired by UK and US officials and had succeeded in:</p>
<p>“… widening the base of Iraqis with whom we worked, which was very important, </p>
<p>because we were trying to hand over to a representative government. We were </p>
<p>aware Iraqis with whom we were working were not really as representative as we </p>
<p>would have wished.”</p>
<p>609</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the choice of Prime Minister, Sir David described:</p>
<p>“…a meeting going on at which various candidates were being discussed and </p>
<p>Lakhdar Brahimi was essentially saying that his first choice, Shahristani, was not </p>
<p>going to fly for a variety of different reasons, and one or two other names were being </p>
<p>thrown around, all of them not apparently particularly suitable. </p>
<p>“So I sort of just asked the question had Sistani raised an objection to Ayad Allawi </p>
<p>and Brahimi said no. That came as a considerable surprise to everybody in the </p>
<p>room, except Lakhdar Brahimi. That was a godsend to me, to those who wanted to </p>
<p>see Ayad Allawi as Prime Minister. There was no objection from Najaf. I think within </p>
<p>48 hours he was consecrated Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>610</p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that Dr Allawi’s name had not been mentioned to </p>
<p>the UK all the way through the period of the formation of the Interim Government, but that </p>
<p>“from the moment we heard that he was going to be the Prime Minister, he was pretty </p>
<p>much welcome to us”.</p>
<p>611</p>

<p><b>1071. </b> A press conference was held in Baghdad by the Prime Minister, President and </p>
<p>Mr Brahimi to announce the new Government. </p>
<p><b>1072. </b> Almost two-thirds of the Interim Government’s Cabinet were new faces; just two </p>

<p>614</p>
<p> The Council of Ministers was composed largely of </p>

<p><b>1073. </b> Mr Blair telephoned Prime Minister Allawi on the day of his swearing in.</p>

<p> After </p>

<p>Council endorsement of the Interim Government, and sought comments on the draft text </p>
<p>of the proposed resolution. </p>
<p><b>1074. </b> Mr Blair encouraged Prime Minister Allawi to travel to New York alongside </p>
<p>Foreign Minister Zebari for the adoption of the resolution, and to make time to speak </p>
<p>to the Western media, which lacked a strong Iraqi voice. </p>
<p><b>1075. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush later the same day that Prime Minister Allawi </p>
<p>had come across well in their conversation, and that he should speak to the </p>

<p>again on 3 June.</p>
<p>617</p>
<p> Mr Hoon and Gen Walker explained that:</p>
<p>“With increasing Iraqiisation there should be a reduction, not increase, in the number </p>
<p>of troops. No more troops were required for the tasks currently assigned to the UK in </p>
<p>MND(SE). But if for other reasons (solidarity with the US, increased influence in Iraq, </p>
<p>increased likelihood of achieving strategic goal in Iraq) it was decided to go ahead, </p>
<p>the optimal military solution would be to provide both the ARRC as a three-star HQ </p>
<p>to command both MND(SE) and MND(CS) and a brigade of troops.”</p>
<p><b>1077. </b> After “a full discussion” that was not described in the record of the meeting, </p>
<p>Mr Blair concluded that “the issue should be kept under advisement for now … We should </p>
<p>only consider an increased commitment if the new Iraqi Government supported it.” </p>
<p><b>1078. </b> An MOD paper on Iraqiisation was considered and it was agreed that a UK team </p>
<p>should be deployed to Iraq to draft “the equivalent of a white paper on defence and </p>
<p>security”. Mr Blair asked for an update on “what is actually happening in MND(SE) in </p>
<p>terms of handing over responsibility for security to the Iraqis”. A further meeting was </p>
<p>planned for the middle of June.</p>

<p><b>1079. </b> On 7 June, Mr Brahimi briefed the Security Council that: </p>
<p>“… after a long, complicated and delicate process under less than optimal </p>
<p>conditions, Iraq had two institutions essential for the next phase – an Interim </p>
<p>Government and a National Independent Electoral Commission.”</p>
<p>618</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1080. </b> Mr Brahimi described the process of forming the Interim Government as </p>
<p>“imperfect and ambiguous” but that the result had been a “capable and reasonably </p>
<p>balanced” group ready to take power on 30 June. The challenges they faced were </p>
<p>considerable, and would take “years, not months, to overcome”. </p>
<p><b>1081. </b> Mr Brahimi reported that his team had consulted widely on how to select the </p>
<p>Interim Government. They had resolved on a process by which a forum made up of the </p>
<p>past, present and future Presidents of the GC, working together with the CPA and the </p>
<p>UN, decided on the criteria for determining who would be selected. Following further </p>
<p>wide consultation, a consensus emerged that Dr Ayad Allawi should be Prime Minister; </p>
<p>and that a three-person Presidency Council should be formed, supported by a Council of </p>
<p>Ministers, largely made up of technocrats. </p>
<p><b>1082. </b> The day after Mr Brahimi’s briefing, the Security Council adopted  </p>
<p>resolution 1546 (2004). </p>

<p><b>1086. </b> Annexed to the resolution was a letter from Prime Minister Allawi to the President </p>
<p>of the Security Council asking for support in providing security and stability against </p>
<p>forces opposed to Iraq’s transition to peace and democracy, until Iraq was able to </p>
<p>provide security for itself. </p>
<p><b>1087. </b> Dr Allawi proposed to establish the Ministerial Committee for National Security, </p>
<p>to which the Commander or Deputy Commander of the MNF would be invited as </p>
<p>appropriate. The Committee would discuss mechanisms for co-ordinating with the MNF. </p>
<p>Dr Allawi wrote that:</p>
<p>“We will be working closely with the MNF leadership in the coming week to ensure </p>
<p>we have such an agreed strategic framework.”</p>
<p><b>1088. </b> A letter from Secretary Powell to the President of the Security Council was also </p>
<p>annexed. He confirmed that the MNF was prepared to contribute to the maintenance </p>
<p>of security in Iraq, including by preventing and deterring terrorism and protecting the </p>
<p>territory of Iraq: </p>
<p>“The goal of the MNF will be to help the Iraqi people to complete the political </p>
<p>transition and will permit the United Nations and the international community to work </p>
<p>to facilitate Iraq’s reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>1089. </b> Secretary Powell wrote that the MNF stood:</p>

<p>maintenance of security and to ensure force protection. These include activities </p>
<p>necessary to counter ongoing security threats posed by forces seeking to influence </p>
<p>Iraq’s political future through violence … including combat operations against </p>
<p>members of these groups, internment where this is necessary for imperative reasons </p>
<p>of security, and the continued search for and securing of weapons that threaten </p>
<p>Iraq’s security.” </p>
<p><b>1090. </b> Reflecting on the resolution in a working breakfast with President Bush on 9 June, </p>
<p>Mr Blair welcomed its unanimous adoption and proposed that the next step should be </p>
<p>“to sort out the Iraqiisation of security forces”.</p>
<p>621</p>
<p> He recognised that would be a “huge </p>
<p>task” given the number of weapons in Iraq, and hoped that Prime Minister Allawi and </p>
<p>Lt Gen Petraeus would agree and publish a detailed plan. </p>
<p><b>1091. </b> Mr Hoon discussed the US request for additional UK troops with Lt Gen McColl, </p>
<p>during a visit to Iraq on 14 June.</p>
<p>622</p>
<p> Lt Gen McColl’s view was that: </p>
<p>“… the UK should deploy HQ ARRC and a further brigade to support the US who </p>
<p>in his view were ‘suffering’. General Abizaid had commented recently that he had </p>
<p>already asked for HQ ARRC six times.”</p>
<p><b>1092. </b> Asked by Mr Hoon what difference that additional deployment would make, </p>
<p>Lt Gen McColl commented:</p>
<p>“… a UK deployment would allow us to conduct operations in MND(CS) from a UK </p>
<p>perspective. </p>
<p>“… if we did not deploy additional troops there would be a higher level of risk to </p>
<p>troops in Iraq and a further risk to the strategic mission.” </p>
<p>He added that:</p>
<p>“… the issue of increasing UK influence on the US was becoming ‘embarrassing’. </p>
<p>The positions that the UK held in various HQs (and hence the influence) was </p>
<p>disproportionate to our overall troop deployment and financial contributions.”</p>
<p><b>1093. </b> On 14 June, the Cabinet Office circulated a discussion paper as background for </p>
<p>the next Ministerial meeting on the US request to deploy additional troops.</p>
<p>623</p>
<p> This set out </p>
<p>the advantages and disadvantages of three options:</p>

<p>the deployment of the ARRC with a brigade of troops “on stand-by at </p>
<p>high-readiness”; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the simultaneous deployment of both the ARRC and a brigade of troops.</p>
<p><b>1094. </b> The Cabinet Office observed that the US Administration remained interested </p>
<p>in securing the additional UK troops but, in view of the fact that they had been willing </p>
<p>to give the UK time to consider the request and had not sought to apply pressure, a </p>
<p>positive UK response was judged to be “desirable but not critical”. </p>
<p><b>1095. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote a minute for Mr Blair containing his advice for the </p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>624</p>
<p> Sir Nigel said that the ARRC should not be deployed “if it is just to alleviate </p>
<p>American overstretch, since we are under severe pressure too”. He urged Mr Blair to </p>
<p>“probe CDS [Gen Walker] who seems to be saying both that it [deployment of the ARRC] </p>
<p>would be significant and that the reasons for doing this are political not military”.</p>
<p><b>1096. </b> Both Sir Nigel and the Cabinet Office highlighted the difficulties inherent in </p>
<p>almost doubling UK forces in Iraq (if the ARRC and a brigade were deployed) whilst </p>
<p>simultaneously focusing on Iraqiisation and the transfer of sovereignty. </p>
<p><b>1097. </b> The same group of Ministers and officials who had met on 3 June, plus Mr Paul </p>
<p>Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, met on 15 June. Mr Rycroft recorded in a </p>
<p>letter to Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary that they had concluded that the UK: </p>
<p>“… should not close the door to the possibility of sending further UK troops. </p>
<p>We should keep the option open until around the time of the NATO Summit  </p>
<p>[28 and 29 June]. But there was no pressing military reason to send them, nor were </p>
<p>we coming under much pressure from the US to do so. We should not raise US </p>
<p>expectations by talking to them about the details of how the reinforcement might </p>
<p>take place.”</p>

<p><b>1098. </b> On 16 June, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note written by Mr Blair for </p>

<p>626</p>
<p> Looking ahead to several weeks containing “international meetings” </p>
<p>Mr Blair proposed a strategic plan, the objectives of which included “to show continued </p>
<p>Iraq ‘grip’” and “to deal with any WMD/intelligence issues” (see Section 4.4). </p>
<p><b>1099. </b> Mr Blair envisaged that the timetable and strategy in relation to Iraq would include </p>
<p>the IIG publishing an “action plan on Iraqiisation of Iraq’s security” in the week before </p>
<p>handover and an international conference in early September. Mr Blair wrote that the </p>
<p>problem on Iraqiisation was “obvious”:</p>
<p>“The numbers in the police are there. But not the quality or equipment, e.g. only </p>
<p>7,000 of the 80,000 police are Academy trained: 62,000 have no training; only </p>

<p>place. Apparently the logjam on resources and equipment is now broken. But it will </p>
<p>take time. And the Iraqi Army isn’t really started yet.</p>
<p>“All of this is now urgent.”</p>
<p><b>1100. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary suggested that he should discuss the plan outlined in </p>
<p>his Note to “draw together various key strands of work (Iraq, WMD, Afghanistan, MEPP) </p>
<p>into a coherent strategy with a clear timetable into the autumn” with President Bush on </p>
<p>22 June.</p>
<p>627</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1101. </b> In mid-June, the JIC assessed the threat posed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>628</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It concluded that:</p>
<p>“I. </p>
<p>Al-Zarqawi is now second only to Bin Laden as an inspirational figure in the </p>
<p>Islamist extremist world. His networks have proved resilient and if he is killed or </p>
<p>captured other leaders will emerge.</p>
<p>II. </p>
<p>Islamist terrorists have been responsible for a number of major suicide attacks in </p>
<p>Iraq, and al-Zarqawi has been behind many of them.</p>
<p>III. </p>
<p>Other significant but less well-publicised Islamist terrorist groups are conducting </p>
<p>similar attacks against similar targets. But his actions and words have given </p>
<p>al-Zarqawi an unrivalled prominence as the key jihadist leader in Iraq.</p>
<p>IV. </p>
<p>It is not clear whether al-Zarqawi is a member of Al Qaida. He has close links </p>
<p>with the leadership, but maintains his independence.</p>
<p>V. </p>
<p>His strategy in Iraq is to destabilise the country by fomenting civil war, and </p>
<p>eventually to establish a Sunni Islamist state – and a safe haven from which </p>
<p>Islamist terrorists can pursue the jihad. In pursuing this strategy he will seek to </p>
<p>intensify attacks in the lead up to the handover of power and beyond, targeting </p>
<p>Americans, British, Kurds, Shia and other Iraqis seen as supporting the Coalition </p>
<p>and the new Iraqi government.”</p>
<p><b>1102. </b> On 17 June, Mr Blair told Cabinet that the Iraqi people were beginning  </p>
<p>to realise that terrorist attacks were not against the Coalition, but rather against Iraq </p>
<p>and its people.</p>
<p>629</p>
<p> He suggested that this should result in a reduction in support for </p>
<p>terrorist activity. </p>
<p><b>1103. </b> Gen Walker told the AHMGIR on the same date that there had been a marginal </p>
<p>improvement in the security situation and that incidents in MND(SE) were down by </p>
<p>20 percent.</p>
<p>630</p>
<p> There continued to be targeted attacks by militants, using increasingly </p>
<p>sophisticated tactics. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>1104. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, who had recently visited Baghdad, judged that “while we were </p>
<p>not losing the security battle, we were entering a new and very dangerous phase”. </p>
<p><b>1105. </b> Mr Hoon commented that the security situation was very different in the South. </p>
<p>He noted the difficult situation faced by UK forces in Maysan, who were sustaining </p>
<p>22 percent casualties. That could not continue indefinitely, and root causes such as </p>
<p>unemployment needed to be examined. </p>
<p><b>1106. </b> On 18 June, Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director General Operational Policy, </p>
<p>submitted advice to Mr Hoon on the options for deploying the ARRC, intended to result </p>
<p>in a decision ahead of the forthcoming NATO summit, which was thought to be an ideal </p>
<p>opportunity to inform other countries and announce a deployment.</p>
<p>631</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1107. </b> The submission listed three options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployment to Afghanistan in 2006; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployment to Iraq; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remaining as part of the NATO Reaction Force. </p>
<p><b>1108. </b> Mr Howard did not recommend which option should be selected. He asked </p>
<p>Mr Hoon to agree that “if Ministers decide against deployment to Iraq … there are sound </p>
<p>military and political reasons for committing the ARRC to Afghanistan in mid-2006”. That </p>
<p>“would chime well with plans for strategic handoff in Iraq around mid-06”. </p>
<p><b>1109. </b> Mr Howard suggested that, while deployments to either Afghanistan or Iraq might </p>
<p>reinforce the ARRC’s operational credentials, deployment to Iraq could “undermine its </p>
<p>position as a reliable NATO asset”. He wrote:</p>
<p>“The obvious conclusion is that a decision in favour of Iraq would need to be </p>
<p>supported by a very strong political or military rationale, preferably both; stewardship </p>
<p>of the forthcoming elections, where HQ ARRC has the potential to have an effect </p>
<p>in creating the right security conditions, could be a factor in this respect. Overall, </p>
<p>however, the political rationale remains opaque with latest assessments of the </p>
<p>timelag in deployment weakening any obvious operational rationale.”</p>
<p><b>1110. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Mr Hoon on 21 June to say that he endorsed </p>
<p>Mr Howard’s submission, recommending that “we instead earmark the ARRC for </p>
<p>Afghanistan in 2006”.</p>
<p>632</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1111. </b> Sir Kevin had recently returned from a visit to Iraq and reported that the ARRC </p>
<p>deployment had been raised with him by two US Generals and by Ambassador Bremer, </p>
<p>who saw it as supporting the training of the Iraqi Armed Forces because:</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.2  |  23 May 2003 to June 2004 </p>
<p>391</p>
<p>“… only the US and UK had the professionalism, together with the readiness </p>
<p>to provide the guarantee of warfighting back-up, that would enable the Iraqis to </p>
<p>progressively take over responsibility for security.”</p>
<p><b>1112. </b> In Sir Kevin’s discussions, no-one had suggested the deployment made the </p>
<p>difference between strategic success or failure in Iraq. He advised:</p>
<p>“Were there to be a more serious risk of strategic failure, then there would be a need </p>
<p>perhaps to reconsider at least as far as troop numbers are concerned.”</p>
<p><b>1113. </b> The record of points on Iraq discussed at the video conference between Mr Blair </p>
<p>and President Bush on 22 June indicates that Mr Blair argued that Prime Minister </p>
<p>Allawi and Lt Gen Petraeus should keep working on a detailed plan for Iraqiisation, for </p>
<p>publication.</p>
<p>633</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that it appeared that the obstacles to that process were being </p>
<p>removed and that both the quantity and quality of the ISF were increasing. He suggested </p>
<p>that the NATO Summit in Istanbul should be the vehicle to get agreement from NATO to </p>
<p>support training in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1114. </b> The Chiefs of Staff meeting on 23 June was, according to Mr William Ehrman, </p>
<p>who attended on behalf of the FCO:</p>
<p>“… taken up by Afghanistan. There were no points of note on Iraq. Chiefs noted that </p>
<p>the Defence Secretary would write to the Prime Minister that day recommending that </p>
<p>the HQ ARRC be deployed to Afghanistan in 2006.”</p>
<p>634</p>
<p><b>1115. </b> On the same day, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary to explain that the case for deploying HQ ARRC to Iraq was receding.</p>
<p>635</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although it would have provided a visible expression of the UK commitment to success </p>
<p>in Iraq, and might have increased UK influence over the direction of the overall </p>
<p>campaign, any military effect would not be felt until the autumn. In any case, the security </p>
<p>concerns that had led to the US requesting additional UK forces had reduced. </p>
<p><b>1116. </b> Instead, Mr Hoon supported planning for a 2006 deployment of HQ ARRC to </p>
<p>Afghanistan. That would not preclude deployment to Iraq later in 2004 if the security </p>
<p>situation were to deteriorate dramatically. </p>
<p><b>1117. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that Ministers had decided not to deploy the </p>
<p>ARRC to Iraq because they did not think there was a sufficiently compelling case for </p>
<p>doing so, and because the ARRC “might be needed in the future should we move into a </p>
<p>more ambitious military role in Afghanistan”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>1118. </b> Sir Nigel also told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… there was no sense in the summer of 2004 that we were sort of making a </p>
<p>decision to make Afghanistan our main military effort. There’s no record that I have </p>
<p>seen which suggests that.”</p>
<p>637</p>
<p><b>1119. </b> As the transfer of sovereignty approached, on 23 June the Iraq Policy Unit </p>
<p>reported to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that FCO Legal Advisers had assessed all CPA </p>
<p>legislation against the UK’s legal obligations to see what risks arose.</p>
<p>638</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1120. </b> The advice said that: </p>
<p>“As the Secretary of State is aware, we have since the beginning of the Occupation </p>
<p>fought a series of policy and legal battles with the US over various CPA initiatives </p>
<p>or pieces of legislation. These have occurred in some cases over differences of </p>
<p>approach to policy, particularly given the US ambitious agenda to lay the foundations </p>
<p>for long-term reform of the Iraqi economy and society, and in some cases because </p>
<p>of an expansive US approach to the law of Occupation.” </p>
<p><b>1121. </b> In relation to resolution 1483, consultation with the Special Representative to the </p>
<p>UN Secretary General had not taken place, although the IPU noted that no one in the </p>
<p>UN had ever protested to the CPA or UK.</p>
<p><b>1122. </b> The advice identified three other potential risk areas, two of which raised potential </p>
<p>incompatibilities with the UK’s obligations under the European Convention on Human </p>
<p>Rights and one of which suggested that the UK might be jointly responsible for an action </p>
<p>which went beyond its powers in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1123. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote a note to Mr Crompton in manuscript to record </p>
<p>that the Foreign Secretary had “noted” the advice. </p>
<p><b>1124. </b> At Cabinet on 24 June, Mr Blair said that efforts to intimidate people not to join  </p>
<p>the ISF and to disrupt power and oil supplies were increasingly seen as contrary  </p>
<p>to the interests of the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>639</p>
<p> He told Cabinet that “this was a crucial </p>
<p>psychological shift”.</p>
<p><b>1125. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Secretary Rumsfeld on 25 June, explaining that the UK had </p>

<p><b>1127. </b> The Occupation of Iraq formally came to an end on 28 June, two days earlier than </p>
<p>had been originally planned in order to avoid disruption by insurgents. </p>
<p><b>1128. </b> Ambassador Bremer recorded that the idea for the early transfer reached him </p>
<p>through Dr Rice, who reported that “the President is interested in trying to ‘wrong foot’ </p>
<p>the opposition”.</p>
<p>642</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1129. </b> Power was transferred from the CPA and GC to the Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government (IIG).</p>
<p>643</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1130. </b> The IIG comprised a President, two Vice Presidents, a Prime Minister, a Deputy </p>
<p>Prime Minister, and 31 ministers. Six of the 31 ministers were women. </p>
<p><b>1131. </b> Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry that the representation of women was:</p>
<p>“… one of the minor success stories of the CPA … John Sawers and Jerry Bremer </p>
<p>when they were setting up the Iraqi Governing Council were very insistent there </p>
<p>should be women members. I think there were three at that stage. We said that the </p>
<p>Iraqi governing council had to choose the Ministers in that sort of first government </p>
<p>that was set up at the end of August-beginning of September 2003. There were </p>
<p>no women. </p>
<p>“So my conclusion was that left to their own devices I think there would have been </p>
<p>very few women involved in the process, but we learned from that lesson, and in </p>
<p>drafting the transitional administrative law, the TAL, which was in effect the interim </p>
<p>Constitution and the electoral process and representation in the assemblies and </p>
<p>so on, we insisted on a quota for women. There were also women in the interim </p>
<p>government we handed over to. Quite a lot of work was done by various people, </p>
<p>including some of the British secondees to try to set up women’s groups to </p>
<p>encourage their participation in the process.”</p>

<p>He judged that:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>394</p>
<p>“… it is hard to escape the conclusion that CPA policies and US military tactics made </p>
<p>the situation worse”.</p>
<p><b>1134. </b> After security, Mr Richmond suggested that “services have been the CPA’s main </p>
<p>failing. Baghdad presently has fewer than 12 hours per day of electricity – no different </p>
<p>from a year ago”.</p>
<p><b>1135. </b> Looking back on the Seven Step Plan devised by Ambassador Bremer, </p>
<p>Mr Richmond assessed it as:</p>
<p>“… no doubt overly ambitious … But, rightly, he [Ambassador Bremer] wanted </p>
<p>Governing Council buy in and by the time it was clear that they could not agree </p>
<p>and that Sistani’s opposition was an insurmountable obstacle, three months had </p>
<p>been wasted.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1136. </b> Mr Richmond said that a:</p>
<p>“… major political problem we faced was the lack of internal leadership, particularly </p>
<p>but not exclusively Sunni, as a result of Saddam’s policy of eliminating all potential </p>
<p>rivals. The CPA was forced to rely on exiles and political parties which were </p>
<p>organised on ethnic/sectarian lines. Their dominant presence on the Governing </p>
<p>Council and the absence of strong Sunni representation tended to reinforce a </p>
<p>feeling among the Sunni community that they were being excluded from the </p>
<p>political process.”</p>
<p>646</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1137. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir David Richmond whether the CPA could have done more to </p>
<p>encourage the election of political leaders who were more “indigenous”, in that they had </p>
<p>lived through the Saddam Hussein era and were less bound by ethnic sectarian lines. </p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>“I think quite a lot of effort was put into it but I admit that we did not succeed … the </p>
<p>distinction between exile and indigenous over time … disappeared but it was still a </p>
<p>factor up until June 2004 … Lakhdar Brahimi … was very determined, rightly, to try </p>
<p>to find some new Sunni individuals who could play a leadership role and he found </p>
<p>that extremely difficult. He didn’t find it any easier than the CPA had found it. </p>
<p>“So yes, we failed, but I think it was because of the circumstances I have described </p>
<p>there, the situation which we found ourselves in rather than a failure to recognise the </p>
<p>problem or to put sufficient effort in trying to remedy it.”</p>
<p>647</p>
<p><b>1138. </b> In his valedictory telegram Mr Richmond observed that Iraqis were glad to </p>
<p>be rid of Saddam Hussein and that much had been accomplished in the political </p>
<p>arena (including the TAL and the creation of the interim government and electoral </p>

<p>648</p>
<p> The new currency and independent Central Bank also counted as </p>
<p>positive, as did work to “re-establish the machinery of government”.</p>
<p><b>1139. </b> Although no immediate improvement in security was expected, and new </p>
<p>structures were “fragile”, Mr Richmond nonetheless saw grounds for optimism, as the </p>
<p>Iraqi people increasingly felt their future was in their own hands. </p>
<p><b>1140. </b> The final paragraph of Mr Richmond’s telegram paid tribute to the UK staff within </p>
<p>the CPA:</p>
<p>“Despite the risks, they got on with their work and in an organisation which repaid </p>
<p>initiative exercised influence out of all proportion to their numbers. Their courage and </p>
<p>fortitude were exemplary.”</p>
<p><b>1141. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush met in the margins of a NATO Summit in Istanbul on </p>
<p>the day that the handover took place in Iraq.</p>
<p>649</p>
<p> Mr Blair emphasised the need to support </p>
<p>the IIG with training and equipment it needed, and for the new Government to develop a </p>
<p>proper communications strategy. </p>
<p><b>1142. </b> Mr Blair suggested that if asked about the IIG imposing martial law, the response </p>
<p>should be that “the Iraqis should take tough security decisions in order to secure </p>
<p>democracy, but this was not the same as suspending human rights”. </p>
<p><b>1143. </b> On 29 June, at the same NATO Summit, Mr Blair announced that the ARRC </p>
<p>would deploy to Afghanistan in 2006.</p>
<p>650</p>
<p><b>1144. </b> The handover to the IIG led the UK to review the Rules of Engagement and the </p>
<p>Targeting Directive under which its operations were conducted, to reflect the fact that </p>
<p>there was no longer a state of armed conflict with Iraq.</p>
<p>651</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1145. </b> Instead of operations being governed by the Law of Armed Conflict, they would </p>
<p>instead be conducted under the domestic rules of self defence as they applied to </p>
<p>ordinary citizens in England and Wales (under section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967). </p>
<p>The degree of force used must be the minimum necessary to avert the risk of loss of life </p>
<p>and lethal force could only be used to prevent loss of life on the part of Coalition Forces </p>
<p>or Iraqi civilians. </p>
<p><b>1146. </b> Ms Vivien Rose, Head of the General and International Law Team in the MOD, </p>
<p>wrote to Ms Cathy Adams, Legal Counsellor to Lord Goldsmith, to seek Lord Goldsmith’s </p>
<p>endorsement of the new Directive. </p>
<p><b>1147. </b> The revised Targeting Directive contained a “dormant” section which said that, </p>

<p>the Joint Commander could seek Ministerial approval to conduct operations under </p>
<p>International Humanitarian Law. </p>
<p><b>1148. </b> On 30 June, the JIC issued an Assessment covering the overall security situation </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>652</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1149. </b> The JIC judged that “the recent spike of activity by anti-Government forces is a </p>
<p>deliberate attempt to undermine the political process”. The early handover may have </p>
<p>avoided the transfer “being marked by a surge of violence”. </p>
<p><b>1150. </b> On 24 June, there had been a series of attacks in Baqubah, Ramadi and Mosul </p>
<p>which the JIC assessed were “probably co-ordinated”. The JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“Al-Zarqawi had claimed responsibility for some … but the extent of his planning </p>
<p>and direction is unclear. If he was behind the attacks, the breadth and scale would </p>
<p>represent a step change.”</p>
<p><b>1151. </b> The JIC assessed that the threat from Muqtada al-Sadr was declining, with </p>
<p>indications of splits in JAM in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>1152. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“The level of violence will diminish if the Iraqi Interim Government is able visibly to </p>
<p>establish a credible degree of independence of action, deal with security, improve </p>
<p>economic and social conditions, so gaining popular support. But Islamist terrorist </p>
<p>attacks will remain a threat.”</p>
