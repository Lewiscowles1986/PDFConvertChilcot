<p>6.5  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, January to March 2003</p>
<p>309</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Sections 6.4 and 6.5 consider the UK’s planning and preparation for a post-Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein Iraq between late 2001 and March 2003. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> The two parts address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of UK post-conflict strategy and objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparation to implement those objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK civilian and military planning machinery;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK influence on US planning and preparation and the impact of US planning on </p>
<p>the UK; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Parliamentary interest in post-conflict planning and preparation. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> The two parts do not consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>military plans for the invasion, which are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence on weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or preparations for the </p>
<p>post-invasion search for WMD, addressed in Section 4;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the financial and human resources available for post-conflict administration and </p>
<p>reconstruction, addressed in Sections 13 and 15; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the outcome in post-conflict Iraq, which is addressed in Sections 9 and 10.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> This Section covers the 10 weeks between the decision to deploy UK forces and </p>
<p>the first post-invasion meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at Camp David </p>
<p>on 26 and 27 March 2003. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> The preceding period, from mid-2001 to Mr Blair’s decision on 17 January 2003 to </p>
<p>deploy UK forces to support US military preparations, is addressed in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Key findings for Sections 6.4 and 6.5 are listed at the start of Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions relating to both parts are at the end of this Section. </p>
<p><b>Second round of inter-agency talks, Washington, </b></p>
<p><b>22 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>8.  In the run-up to the second round of trilateral inter-agency talks on post-</b></p>
<p><b>conflict issues in Washington on 22 January 2003, UK officials focused on how to </b></p>
<p><b>influence US thinking on the post-conflict role of the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>9.  Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, predicted that discussion on the </b></p>
<p><b>role of the UN would be “hard going”. The US was wedded to a prolonged US </b></p>
<p><b>occupation and opposed to any substantial role for the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>10. </b> The first round of US/UK/Australia inter-agency talks on post-conflict issues took </p>
<p>place in Washington on 6 November 2002 and is described in Section 6.4.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>310</p>
<p><b>11. </b> By the first week of January 2003, no date had been set for the second round.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The FCO Iraq Morning Meeting on 7 January concluded that Sir David Manning, </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat (OD Sec), should ask Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National </p>
<p>Security Advisor, to “unblock” the talks if US officials were unable to clear the way for a </p>
<p>second round to take place in the week of 20 January.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Three days later, the FCO had arranged for the talks to take place on 22 January.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Ricketts visited Washington on 13 January. He reported to Mr Jack Straw, the </p>
<p>Foreign Secretary, that the US had done good work on humanitarian issues, but was </p>
<p>distrustful of the UN and “still clinging to … a wholly unrealistic expectation that they </p>
<p>[the US] will be welcomed in as liberators”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> Mr Ricketts suggested that the forthcoming </p>
<p>UK/US/Australia post-conflict talks in Washington and visits by Mr Straw and Mr Blair </p>
<p>later in the month were opportunities to influence official and Presidential thinking.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Ricketts’ report was copied to Sir David Manning.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Ricketts’ visit also exposed continuing differences between the UK and US on </p>
<p>the post-conflict role of Iraqi exiles. During talks with National Security Council (NSC) </p>
<p>officials about where to find suitable administrators for post-conflict Iraq, Mr Ricketts </p>
<p>advised: “Iraqi exiles were unlikely to come into this category or carry much credibility </p>
<p>in Iraq.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. </b> At the first FCO Iraq Morning Meeting after his return from Washington, Mr Ricketts </p>
<p>reported that:</p>
<p>“… the US show no sign of accepting our arguments on transitional administrations. </p>
<p>They are wedded to the idea of a prolonged US occupation, and opposed to any </p>
<p>substantial role for the UN. We are likely to find the 22 January day after talks hard </p>
<p>going in this respect.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>18. </b> On 13 January, US officials briefed the British and Australian Embassies in </p>
<p>Washington on US humanitarian planning. The British Embassy reported that the </p>
<p>US had “what appeared to be a well researched and internally co-ordinated planning </p>
<p>document”, focused on the provision of emergency relief by the US military until the </p>
<p>UN and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) could resume their activities. The </p>
<p>US military would set up a Civil-Military Operations Centre (CMOC) HQ and regional </p>
<p>branches. Each branch would incorporate a Disaster Assistance Response Team </p>
<p>(DART) and a US Agency for International Development (USAID) presence to facilitate </p>

<p>co-operation with the military. CMOC and DART recruitment was under way. The US </p>
<p>was co-ordinating closely with the UN and NGOs, had funded the UN High Commission </p>
<p>for Refugees (UNHCR) to pre-position emergency assistance and expected the World </p>
<p>Food Programme (WFP) to be a significant partner in the delivery of food. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The Embassy also reported that US officials had envisaged that the post-conflict </p>
<p>talks in Washington on 22 January would focus on emergency relief and reconstruction, </p>
<p>before accepting a UK and Australian suggestion that they also address future political </p>
<p>structures for Iraq.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The record of a restricted meeting of the cross-Whitehall Ad Hoc Group on Iraq </p>
<p>(AHGI) on 14 January stated that the UK and Australia were being given full access </p>
<p>to US aftermath planning.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> The MOD had established a team at the Permanent Joint </p>
<p>Headquarters (PJHQ) to examine aftermath issues. Relevant departments would be </p>
<p>involved in the team’s planning and the MOD would pass papers to the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>for wider distribution. The record stated, however, that “without a higher level political </p>
<p>and legal framework, MOD planning cannot advance very far”.</p>
<p><b>21.  On 14 January Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, announced publicly </b></p>
<p><b>that the UN had begun humanitarian contingency planning for Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>22. </b> In response to a question at a press conference on 14 January about the </p>
<p>humanitarian consequences of war, Mr Annan stated:</p>
<p>“We have been doing some contingency planning on that and we are extremely </p>
<p>worried about the fallout and consequences of any such military action. Obviously </p>
<p>we do not want to be caught unprepared. So we have gone ahead and made </p>
<p>contingency plans, and we are in touch with governments that can provide some </p>
<p>financial assistance for us to move our preparations to the next level. But we are </p>
<p>worried.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>23.  On 22 January, Mr Straw approved the briefing prepared for the UK delegation </b></p>
<p><b>to the US/UK/Australia inter-agency talks in Washington. </b></p>
<p><b>24.  The briefing material focused on unresolved differences between the UK and </b></p>
<p><b>US on the wider post-conflict role of the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>25.  It envisaged the Coalition military handing over to an interim, civilian </b></p>
<p><b>administration operating under UN auspices, “as soon as practically possible”.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>26.  The briefing listed strategic decisions needed “very soon so that planning can </b></p>
<p><b>proceed”:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>how to establish a secure environment;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>how to meet the basic needs of the Iraqi people;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the level of ambition for political reform;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the extent to which economic reform should be left to the International </b></p>
<p><b>Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the environmental clean-up plan.</b></p>
<p><b>27. </b> The follow-up to the 6 November US/UK/Australia post-conflict talks in Washington </p>
<p>took place on 22 January. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> In his record of the 17 January meeting of the AHGI, Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant </p>
<p>Head (Foreign Affairs) OD Sec, stated that preparations for the talks were on track and </p>
<p>that the UK had supplied a number of papers on the main issues.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The US had not, so </p>
<p>far, shared any papers with the UK. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Mr Drummond also stated that the MOD had started its own detailed aftermath </p>
<p>planning, “just in case UK forces ended up controlling a part of Iraq”. The questions </p>
<p>raised would be used “to give a practical edge to the Washington discussions”.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> On 17 January, Mr Dominick Chilcott, FCO Middle East Department (MED), </p>
<p>submitted an “Annotated agenda/overarching paper” to Mr Straw.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> In the covering minute, Mr Chilcott sought Mr Straw’s agreement that UK officials </p>
<p>should “argue for following a UN, rather than a unilateral, American-led, route on day-</p>
<p>after issues” and “make clear that we need broad agreement soon on these issues, so </p>
<p>that we can clarify the role which UK forces will play”. Mr Chilcott reported that MOD </p>
<p>officials were content with that approach.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Chilcott explained that the UK had shared a number of papers on post-conflict </p>
<p>issues with the US, but had received very little in return:</p>
<p>“We had hoped that by now US thinking would be beginning to converge. But </p>
<p>differences between departments remain as stark as before. At one end of the </p>
<p>spectrum, the Pentagon, who regard the UN as irredeemably incompetent, advocate </p>
<p>the US leading a day-after operation, co-opting willing allies for an extended period, </p>
<p>until a new Iraqi government is ready to take over. At the other end sit the State </p>
<p>Department who favour an internationalist approach with UN blessing. The NSC </p>
<p>are somewhere in the middle. CENTCOM [Central Command] have set up a large </p>
<p>military team to work up plans for taking over the government of Iraq. The risk is </p>

<p>313</p>
<p>that, in the absence of a consensus position on day-after, the CENTCOM plan will </p>
<p>be followed <i>faute de mieux</i>.</p>
<p>“We believe any unilateral US day-after plan would be seriously flawed. It would </p>
<p>lack international legitimacy, as the UN is unlikely to support it. We expect the Iraqis’ </p>
<p>euphoria at being liberated from Saddam to turn quickly into resentment and anger </p>
<p>at being subject to a foreign army of occupation, a sentiment which is likely to be </p>
<p>reflected more widely in the Arab world. In a hostile domestic and international </p>
<p>environment, it will be more difficult to embed lasting political and economic reforms </p>
<p>… All in all, a recipe for a mess, with Coalition forces obliged to stay on in Iraq </p>
<p>for years.</p>
<p>“The arguments for following the UN route look compelling and … would be very </p>
<p>much in US interests …</p>
<p>“As soon as practically possible, we envisage the Coalition military handing over to </p>
<p>an interim, civilian administration operating under UN auspices. With international </p>
<p>legitimacy, such an interim administration would be supported in the region and </p>
<p>probably tolerated in Iraq. Reforms conducted under its supervision would be more </p>
<p>likely to stick. And it would aim to oversee a sort of ‘Bonn process’</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> for Iraq, under </p>
<p>which the Iraqis themselves would create new political structures … Lasting reform </p>
<p>in Iraq will take a long time and the UN is more likely than Washington to have the </p>
<p>patience for the long haul.</p>
<p>“The Americans, not unreasonably, refuse to put their forces under UN control … </p>
<p>The answer may be a Kosovo model, where parallel security and civilian presences </p>
<p>co-exist, both blessed by the UN, with the security forces responsible for supporting </p>
<p>and co-ordinating closely with the civil presence but not under UN control.</p>
<p>“We are unlikely to persuade all the agencies in Washington to see it our way on </p>
<p>day-after in one session of talks on 22 January. But our aim remains to get an </p>
<p>agreed Coalition approach. Without it the legal basis on which our own forces would </p>
<p>act will be, at best, unclear and possibly unsafe. We also need broad agreement so </p>
<p>that we can plan in detail how UK forces should conduct themselves in the aftermath </p>
<p>of military action. The Secretary of State [Mr Straw] will arrive in Washington shortly </p>
<p>after our talks conclude. We will … recommend how he might follow up in his talks </p>
<p>with Colin Powell [US Secretary of State]. Day after issues should probably be on </p>
<p>the agenda for the Prime Minister’s meeting with President Bush on 31 January.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p>“The Australians, as the other troop contributing nation, have been invited to join </p>
<p>the day-after talks in Washington. We have spoken to their representatives here in </p>
<p>London and understand that they share our strong views on the desirability of action </p>
<p>through the UN.”</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Chilcott concluded:</p>
<p>“We have no intention of surfacing this work. But if it leaks, we shall emphasise that </p>
<p>it does not imply any change of the policy objectives and that it is simply prudent </p>
<p>contingency planning.”</p>
<p><b>34. </b> The ‘Annotated agenda/overarching paper’ attached to Mr Chilcott’s minute stated </p>
<p>that “strategic decisions on the issues in this paper are needed very soon so that </p>
<p>planning can proceed and a follow-up mechanism [be] agreed”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Issues were organised </p>
<p>under five headings:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>“An urgent task will be to <b>establish a secure environment</b> to facilitate humanitarian </p>
<p>operations and to provide the foundation for normal society to flourish and </p>
<p>self-sufficient development to begin … We shall need quickly to provide legitimate </p>
<p>and transparent law and order and the necessary civil structures, backed by the </p>
<p>Coalition military, to deliver it. Ideally, the ordinary Iraqi police should co-operate. </p>
<p>But will they? And what is the basis of the law to be enforced – is it Iraqi law or </p>
<p>something else?</p>
<p>“We shall also want to prevent internecine violence. Our handling of the defeated </p>
<p>Iraqi forces will be critical. We shall need a DDR [demobilisation, demilitarisation and </p>
<p>re-integration] plan for them, consistent with our vision for the future of Iraq’s armed </p>
<p>forces …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Relief and reconstruction</p>
<p>“The scale of the challenge will depend on the extent of damage and displacement </p>
<p>following conflict and the extent of disruption to oil production … The main </p>
<p>humanitarian issues are:</p>
<p><b>(a) </b></p>
<p><b>How will the basic needs of the Iraqi people – food, medicine, shelter, </b></p>
<p><b>power, emergency reconstruction and protection/personal security – be </b></p>
<p><b>met? …</b> Military action will disrupt the involvement of expats and NGOs in </p>
<p>the distributions systems … We assume other UN agencies … and the ICRC </p>
<p>[International Committee of the Red Cross] would be best placed to cope with </p>
<p>refugees, although there may be a period when they cannot get access to them. </p>

<p><b>36. </b> The annotated agenda made no reference to the UK’s specific responsibilities in </p>
<p>southern Iraq. Nor did it consider the possible contribution of different UK government </p>
<p>departments to the UK post-conflict effort.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, commented to </p>
<p>Mr Straw: “After 22 January we will need to raise the level of exchanges with the US, </p>
<p>in order to reach agreement on these key issues.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Straw approved Mr Chilcott’s recommendations and reported that Secretary </p>

<p>to note the intended scope of the meeting.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> Mr Pollard explained that, in the US:</p>
<p>“… much of the running is being made by CENTCOM, which has set up a large </p>
<p>military team to work up plans for Phase IV</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> of the campaign. The MOD are well </p>

<p>“… Unexpectedly, the FCO have just decided that they wish to seek the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary’s approval for the general line they wish to take in discussion … that we </p>
<p>should be pressing the US to follow a UN rather than a unilateral US-led route, in </p>
<p>dealing with day-after issues. The FCO take the line that any unilateral US plan </p>
<p>would lack international legitimacy, and that without an agreed Coalition approach </p>
<p>the legal basis on which our own forces might operate would be at best unclear and </p>
<p>possibly unsafe.”</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Mr Pollard stated that there was “some force” in the FCO argument and that </p>
<p>Mr Ian Lee, MOD Director General Operational Policy (DG OpPol), was content to </p>
<p>take part in the Washington talks on that basis. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> Mr Pollard advised that the FCO was likely to brief Mr Straw to follow up the talks </p>
<p>with Secretary Powell and was also expected to put post-conflict issues on the agenda </p>
<p>for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush on 31 January. The MOD would be closely </p>
<p>associated with the drafting of that advice. Mr Lee would advise on his return from </p>
<p>Washington whether Mr Hoon should raise the issue in his weekly telephone call to </p>
<p>Mr Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary (PUS),</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> commented separately </p>
<p>to Mr Hoon:</p>
<p>“My main observation on what is a good paper is that this rather underplays the </p>
<p>fissiparous tendencies within Iraq and the risk that groups are as likely to fight each </p>
<p>other as Coalition forces. More detailed work is needed in my view on how to keep </p>
<p>Kurds, Turkomans, Shia, Sunni and, perhaps Southern Marsh Shia together in one </p>
<p>national entity – and indeed to handle those other three groups – people bent on </p>
<p>revenge against S[addam] H[ussein]’s regime relics, and the outsiders/exiles who </p>
<p>may find themselves less welcome than they expect. All points to the need for a very </p>
<p>strong initial security presence, with a clear link to the political reform process. A still </p>
<p>stronger case in my view for the US to want a wider Coalition, made possible under </p>
<p>UN auspices.”</p>

<p><b>44. </b> Ms Carolyn Miller, DFID Director Middle East and North Africa and the DFID </p>
<p>member of the UK delegation, informed Ms Short that the annotated agenda had been </p>
<p>“put together rapidly”, but DFID had been able to feed in a number of points, including:</p>
<p>“… the importance of establishing a secure environment for humanitarian aid; </p>
<p>the need to factor in the risks of operating if CBW are used; the requirement for </p>
<p>affordable financing arrangements for relief and reconstruction especially if OFF </p>
<p>collapses; and the importance of moving from dependence on handouts to an </p>
<p>Iraq-led economic recovery”.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>45.  Separate MOD briefing for the Washington talks listed questions to which “we </b></p>
<p><b>must first have answers” before the UK assumed post-conflict responsibilities:</b></p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>when humanitarian agencies would take the lead in providing assistance.</b></p>
<p><b>46. </b> The briefing prepared for Mr Lee, the senior MOD member of the UK delegation </p>
<p>for Washington, included “baseline assumptions” for UK force contributions in four  </p>
<p>post-conflict phases. The briefing stated that, in the absence of a US decision on </p>
<p>timelines, the assumptions were only illustrative.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>47. </b> The suggested UK land force contribution under each phase was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US military administration (0-6 months): war-fighting forces (large scale);</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition administration (6-12 months): large scale reducing to medium scale;</p>

<p>25</p>
<p> and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>full Iraqi governance (24 months plus): small scale reducing to advisory teams.</p>
<p><b>48. </b> The briefing stated that the UK military would: “Take regional responsibility for AM </p>
<p>[aftermath] operations in our current War-fighting JOA [Joint Operational Area], at least </p>
<p>for the first six months.” Military tasks would include setting the conditions for successful </p>
<p>DDR/SSR (Security Sector Reform) programmes. The military would also support a civil/</p>

<p>to contribute along those lines:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What should be the future of the Iraqi military, police and local and regional </p>
<p>government, and at what level should the Coalition do business with them, “as </p>
<p>we will have to do”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What would be the legal basis for Coalition forces’ involvement in civil security?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Did the US envisage “sectorisation” as in Bosnia or “central locations and </p>
<p>force projection” as in Afghanistan as the model for Phase IV Coalition Force </p>
<p>structure? If sectorisation, would the US provide additional forces in the UK </p>
<p>sector to perform humanitarian tasks for which UK capacity was limited?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What role would the military have in managing oil production?</p>

<p>providing humanitarian assistance?</p>
<p><b>50. </b> On 20 January, Mr William Ehrman, FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence, </p>
<p>advised Mr Straw that clarity on US thinking would follow the talks in Washington on </p>
<p>22 January.</p>

<p> In the meantime, on a personal basis, he suggested: “we should start to </p>
<p>think internally about elements relating to aftermath that might need to go into a future </p>
<p>Security Council resolution … Such elements include: aftermath UN administration; oil </p>
<p>management; and the future of IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency]/UNMOVIC </p>

<p><b>55. </b> Mr Frank Miller, NSC Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control, who in </p>
<p>summer 2002 had been appointed to head the NSC Executive Steering Group on Iraq </p>
<p>in order to “jump-start” US post-war planning (see Section 6.4), recalled DoD officials </p>

<p>explained that Lieutenant General (retired) Jay Garner, Head of ORHA, faced a range </p>
<p>of challenges.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> They included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the practical tasks of staffing, housing and equipping the new organisation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of access to material produced by the earlier inter-agency planning process; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ambiguity in the division of responsibilities between ORHA and Joint </p>
<p>TaskForce 4 (JTF-4), the separate post-conflict planning unit embedded in </p>
<p>CENTCOM; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disagreement with General Tommy Franks, Commander-in-Chief CENTCOM, </p>
<p>over ORHA’s operational independence from CENTCOM.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Against that difficult background, Lt Gen Garner succeeded in organising ORHA </p>
<p>into three “pillars”: humanitarian assistance, civil administration and reconstruction. </p>
<p>The humanitarian pillar took on the food programme and disaster relief from the </p>
<p>NSC Humanitarian Working Group. The reconstruction pillar started using contracts </p>
<p>negotiated by USAID to engage technical experts. The civil administration pillar faced </p>
<p>the difficulty of finding credible information about public services and ministry functions </p>
<p>in Iraq and was the least well developed of the three.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Ms Short described the decision to make the Pentagon responsible for all post-</p>

<p>rest of the international system may be diminished.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Ms Short also said that:</p>
<p>“… all this enormous State Department planning, which included the danger of </p>
<p>chaos and sectarian fighting and so on, was thrown away. ORHA and the Pentagon </p>
<p>took over. They believed there wasn’t going to be any trouble and people would be </p>
<p>waving flowers at them, and off they went. They believed their own propaganda, and </p>
<p>the British Government’s capacity to think better … was just subverted and thrown </p>
<p>away, to our deep, eternal shame.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit described some of the consequences of the changes:</p>
<p>“I had numerous … meetings with very senior people in the Pentagon … where we </p>
<p>were trying to stress the importance of actually getting the right sort of planning in to </p>
<p>Phase IV for the aftermath … where … they had discarded the State Department’s </p>
<p>advice, and indeed people … and I could not get across to them the fact that … </p>
<p>the Coalition would not be seen as a liberation force where flowers would be stuck </p>
<p>at the end of rifles … [T]his was absolutely not accepted, and I think, as far as the </p>
<p>Pentagon was concerned … they just thought that Iraq would be fine on the day … </p>
<p>and everybody would be happy.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think the crucial problems [with post-conflict planning] arose from the late </p>
<p>decisions in the US to put a department and an organisation in charge which had not </p>
<p>been prepared for this role. I do think, if the careful State Department work had been </p>
<p>allowed to feed through into operational planning for the post-conflict phase, that </p>
<p>would have been more successful. I think it would have been easier for us to dock </p>
<p>with it, and the overall effect on the ground would … have been a stronger operation </p>
<p>from earlier on.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy from </p>
<p>2000 to 2003, told the Inquiry: “Assumptions were made about the State Department </p>
<p>planning.” He asserted that: “once we had realised … that the Pentagon appeared to be </p>
<p>taking the lead on almost every level … the Prime Minister was … rattling a lot of cages </p>
<p>within the British system and asking for an awful lot of things to be done”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>64.  In his evidence to the House of Commons Liaison Committee on 21 January, </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair emphasised the importance of the post-conflict phase:</b></p>
<p><b>“You do not engage in military conflict that may produce regime change </b></p>
<p><b>unless you are prepared to follow through and work in the aftermath of that </b></p>
<p><b>regime change to ensure the country is stable and the people are properly </b></p>
<p><b>looked after.”</b></p>
<p><b>65. </b> In his evidence to the House of Commons Liaison Committee on 21 January, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“It is a terrible responsibility ever to commit troops to action, but I believe we were </p>
<p>right to do it in both Kosovo and Afghanistan. When I say is it right and is it do-able, </p>
<p>is it do-able militarily but also is the aftermath something that you can handle as well, </p>
<p>because I think that is important too.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Asked about the risks of military action for stability in Iraq and the region, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“That is precisely why part of any preparations is to make clear, firstly that the </p>
<p>territorial integrity of Iraq is sacrosanct … and … why we must make sure that we </p>
<p>try and do everything we can to follow through. That is why I say military conflict, if </p>
<p>it comes to that, is not the end of the issue; there are humanitarian questions, there </p>
<p>are questions of what type of government, and all these things have got to be looked </p>
<p>at very carefully. We are obviously in detailed discussion with people about them.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>67. </b> Asked about the role of opposition groups in a reconstructed Iraq, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“I think it is important that we try to make sure that any potential successor </p>
<p>government has the requisite stability but, also, has as broad a representation as </p>
<p>possible … One of the things I am wary about at this point in time is saying ‘Look, </p>
<p>this is exactly what we believe should happen’ in circumstances where we have not </p>
<p>actually got to the point of saying we should have a conflict.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>68. </b> Sir George Young (Conservative) asked Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“Is it not the case that actually the more difficult stage is stage two [nation-building], </p>
<p>and that is the stage at which we might get more involved. To what extent are you </p>
<p>confident that the whole strategy will not be undermined because stage two does not </p>
<p>follow through the success of stage one [military action]?”</p>

<p><b>69. </b> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“You do not engage in military conflict that may produce regime change unless you </p>
<p>are prepared to follow through and work in the aftermath of that regime change to </p>
<p>ensure the country is stable and the people are properly looked after.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“I think that if stage one is successful, then you will find that the international </p>
<p>community wants to come behind that and make sure the Iraqi people are given the </p>
<p>chance to develop free from the repression of Saddam. I expect that there will be </p>
<p>considerable international support for that, and it is important that we do it … I think </p>
<p>it is extremely important that we do not take our eye off Afghanistan … Getting </p>
<p>rid of the Taliban was not the end, for me. The end is Afghanistan reconstituted </p>
<p>as a country that has got its own internal system working properly and does not </p>
<p>threaten the outside world. In exactly the same way in Iraq, if we come to changing </p>
<p>the regime … then I think it is extremely important that we make the most detailed </p>
<p>preparations and work within the international community as to what happens </p>
<p>afterwards.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> In his memoir, Lord Mandelson, who had resigned from the Government in January </p>
<p>2001, recalled that, in January 2003, he asked Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“‘What happens after you’ve won? … You can go in there, you can take out Saddam </p>
<p>but what do you do with Iraq? You’re going to have a country on your hands. I don’t </p>
<p>know what your plan is. I don’t know how you are going to do it. Who is going to </p>
<p>run the place?’ Tony replied: ‘That’s the Americans’ responsibility. It’s down to the </p>
<p>Americans.’”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether the assumption had been that the US would do most </p>
<p>of the post-conflict planning, Mr Blair stated that: </p>
<p>“… the Americans, of course, would have the primary responsibility, but let me be </p>
<p>absolutely clear I was most certainly not thinking it was to be left to the Americans. </p>
<p>The reason why we had done a lot of planning ourselves was precisely because we </p>
<p>knew we were going to be part of the aftermath …”</p>

<p>324</p>
<p><b>75.  UK participants commented on the small amount of time left to prepare </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict plans.</b></p>
<p><b>76. </b> On 22 January, Mr Chaplin led an FCO/MOD/DFID delegation to Washington for </p>
<p>talks on post-conflict planning with the NSC, State Department, DoD, USAID and an </p>
<p>Australian delegation. </p>
<p><b>77. </b> The British Embassy summarised the outcome: </p>
<p>“Some progress in persuading the Administration of the merits of a UN role – but </p>
<p>NSC advise that this will need Prime Minister/Bush discussions to resolve.</p>
<p>“Overall, US Day After planning is still lagging far behind military planning. But </p>
<p>they have agreed to two working groups: on the UN dimension; and on economic </p>
<p>reconstruction issues. Experts will stay in touch on humanitarian co-ordination, </p>
<p>bringing war criminals to justice, and the legality of any international presence </p>
<p>in Iraq.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>78. </b> The Embassy also reported “confusion” over how the decision to establish ORHA, </p>
<p>operating out of DoD alongside JTF-4, would work in practice.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> On de-Ba’athification, the Embassy reported that Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, </p>
<p>NSC Senior Director and Ambassador at large to the Iraqi Opposition, had stated that, </p>
<p>after Saddam Hussein’s departure, top officials in Iraqi ministries should be replaced by </p>
<p>“internationals”, who would rely as much as possible on remaining Iraqi personnel not </p>
<p>tainted by the former regime. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US from 1997 to 2003, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that, in January 2003, a contact in the NSC informed him:</p>
<p>“… we are going to have to get rid of the top people, Saddam’s henchmen, but we </p>
<p>can’t de-Ba’athify completely, otherwise there will be no administration in Iraq and no </p>
<p>school teachers and no nothing and we are going to need some of these people”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Mr Chaplin, Mr Lee and Ms Miller produced supplementary reports for their </p>
<p>respective Secretaries of State. </p>
<p><b>82. </b> Mr Chaplin informed Mr Straw that the talks had gone “better than expected”, but </p>
<p>had revealed that, “as we expected, apart from on humanitarian relief and immediate </p>
<p>post-conflict reconstruction, the US have not yet made much progress on a lot of the </p>
<p>day-after agenda. Most of the issues have not yet gone to principals.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> The US “seemed </p>
<p>very confident that Coalition forces would have the right in international law to occupy </p>
<p>and administer Iraq after a conflict”, which was not the view of FCO lawyers. </p>

<p><b>83. </b> Mr Chaplin reported that since “military action could start within a few weeks”, it had </p>
<p>been agreed to have the first meetings of the new working groups the following week, if </p>
<p>possible.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Lee reported to Mr Hoon that the US was beginning to take the aftermath </p>
<p>seriously and was willing to work with the UK and Australia in the various working </p>
<p>groups, but there was little time left.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> During his visit Mr Lee had arranged a call on </p>
<p>Lt Gen Garner at which he had said the UK was “keen to be involved” as ORHA took </p>
<p>shape. Lt Gen Garner had been grateful and suggested that the UK feed in ideas </p>
<p>rather than wait for him to make requests. </p>
<p><b>85. </b> Mr Lee recommended that Mr Hoon raise post-conflict planning in his next phone </p>
<p>conversation with Secretary Rumsfeld in terms that it was a vital issue that needed “to </p>
<p>be sorted now because it affects both the UK decision to commit to hostilities … and </p>
<p>also international support”, and that there was a need for clarity on “who is responsible </p>
<p>to whom for what on day after planning and then execution”. </p>
<p><b>86. </b> Ms Miller informed Ms Short that the talks had provided a useful opportunity </p>
<p>to deepen understanding between DFID and the MOD. Unlike the US participants, </p>

<p>She added that support from Australia on the role of the UN and humanitarian </p>

<p><b>87. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“By January 2003, though, as it turned out, that was rather late in the day, though </p>
<p>we hoped we would have more time, the Americans were at least listening … So we </p>
<p>bombarded the Americans with lots of good advice, we hoped, on the handling of the </p>
<p>aftermath and said it needed to be considered, which actually matched pretty well </p>
<p>with what the State Department had done.”</p>

<p>would stay, saying:</p>
<p>“… our assumption was that they would be around for quite a long time. We had </p>
<p>gone for the biggest of the three options we had considered … partly in order to help </p>
<p>with the occupation.”</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Before he had seen the record of the Washington talks, Mr Mike O’Brien, FCO </p>
<p>Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, set out his views on the creation of a </p>
<p>democratic federal Iraq in a note to Mr Straw.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> Mr O’Brien argued that US plans for </p>
<p>a post-conflict “military regime” would “go down badly in the Muslim world”. Instead, </p>
<p>the period between a second resolution and the start of military action should be used </p>
<p>to set out a programme for bringing about a democratic federal Iraq run by Iraqis. He </p>
<p>recommended “a major exercise” to bring together opposition groups to negotiate a </p>
<p>constitution, with Western assistance, as soon as possible. Mr O’Brien added that a </p>
<p>transitional authority “would need to rely on the recruitment of Iraqis from within the </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein administration as well as some of the diaspora opposition”.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Mr Chaplin commented:</p>
<p>“I have no problem in setting democracy as a goal for Iraq … But we have to be </p>
<p>careful how we present this. To most Arabs ‘democracy’ means imposing Western </p>
<p>style institutions on the Arab world, for our own benefit. It is wiser … to talk about the </p>
<p>application of universal principles such as democratic values, good governance, the </p>
<p>rule of law and so on …</p>
<p>“My only point of disagreement in Mike O’Brien’s analysis is that ‘we’ ie the Coalition </p>
<p>should negotiate a new constitution for Iraq with Iraqi opposition groups. Firstly … </p>
<p>a new constitution must be seen to be developed by the Iraqis themselves. What </p>
<p>we will be doing is holding the ring to allow that process to take place. Secondly </p>
<p>Iraqi opposition groups are a very disparate bunch. A few of them … represent a </p>
<p>constituency on the ground in Iraq. Most of them represent only themselves.”</p>

<p><b>94. </b> On 23 January, Mr Drummond allocated responsibility for following up the five </p>
<p>issues on which the participants in the Washington talks had agreed the need for further </p>
<p>co-ordination:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The role of the UN. The NSC would lead for the US; Mr Stephen Pattison, Head </p>
<p>of FCO United Nations Department (UND), for the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economic issues. State Department to lead for the US; FCO Economic Advisers </p>
<p>for the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humanitarian issues. DFID was already working with the NSC and USAID and </p>
<p>would continue to co-ordinate with the FCO, MOD and others.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>War crimes. The US appeared to favour a two-tier approach, with the Iraqi </p>
<p>legal system trying those suspected of war crimes against the Iraqi people and </p>
<p>a different system for war crimes against Coalition Forces, though this was </p>
<p>not agreed policy. US and UK lawyers and policy-makers on both sides would </p>
<p>discuss, with the FCO in the lead for the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Rights of the Occupying Power. FCO and MOD legal advisers would pursue with </p>
<p>US legal advisers.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Mr Drummond added that Brigadier William Rollo, MOD Director of Military </p>
<p>Operations, would take forward post-conflict military planning through the British </p>
<p>Embassy Washington and links into CENTCOM.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Mr Drummond emphasised that the work was urgent. The UK “should take the </p>
<p>initiative in arranging the work of the groups” and individual leads should report progress </p>
<p>to the Cabinet Office by 7 February.</p>
<p><b>97. </b> The first meeting of UK members of the UN group was held on 31 January and the </p>

<p><b>lack of clarity on medium- and long-term objectives.</b></p>
<p><b>100.  PJHQ proposed a “Common Document” that would be endorsed by the FCO </b></p>
<p><b>and DFID, to ensure the UK delivered the consistent message needed to influence </b></p>
<p><b>US post-conflict planning. </b></p>
<p><b>101. </b> On 20 January, a PJHQ official provided Major General Rob Fry, Deputy Chief of </p>
<p>Joint Operations (Operations), with “a proposed way forward on Phase IV work”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>official advised:</p>
<p>“The first issue that we have faced in doing this work is that many (senior) people </p>
<p>have been generating ideas to contribute to the Phase IV planning, but to date </p>
<p>without a conceptual framework … The result has been a sense of increasing </p>
<p>concern that the issue is not being adequately gripped (which in turn has prompted </p>
<p>further high level input). To address this and using a slightly modified version of </p>
<p>CENTCOM’s framework, we have formulated just such a framework and called it </p>
<p>‘the Common Document’ … The aspiration is that … we will be able to produce </p>
<p>a cross-Government agreed UK ‘manifesto’, from which we would be able to </p>
<p>guide subsequent engagement with the US. It also provides a mechanism for </p>
<p>systematically identifying issues that need to be resolved.</p>
<p>“… We also need to integrate any SPG [Strategic Planning Group] work that has </p>
<p>been done on this subject and cross-check it against UK peacekeeping doctrine … </p>
<p>[I]t is in the first instance intended as a planning tool, a mechanism for pooling UK </p>
<p>thinking on aftermath. We should not be in the business of doing the thinking, just </p>
<p>collecting it and making it coherent.</p>
<p>“… The Common Document has yet to be briefed outside the department, but will </p>
<p>need FCO and DFID input to be any use …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Unfortunately time is not on our side, however, and we have an increasing concern </p>
<p>about our ability to populate the framework in the time available … We recommend, </p>
<p>therefore, that we should hold a week long cross-government planning seminar to </p>
<p>help complete the document. Effectively this would be a single ‘big-push’ to pull </p>
<p>together all government thinking on aftermath …</p>
<p>“Overcoming the institutional resistance to such a proposal would also be a </p>
<p>challenge … To make it work, we would need active support (not just acquiescence) </p>
<p>from the top of MOD, the FCO and DFID (and probably the Cabinet Office). This </p>
<p>might take some effort … </p>

<p>“Nevertheless, I think the arguments for pursuing the idea are persuasive. First </p>
<p>and foremost is the fact that Iraq seems to be the Prime Minister’s Main Effort, and </p>
<p>aftermath his chief concern. So far we seem to have little to reassure him. Second, </p>
<p>time is not on our side … Third, because of the way this war is being planned in the </p>
<p>US, we risk missing a major trick if we do not give the UK components the policy </p>
<p>guidance they need to inform the US planning.”</p>
<p><b>102. </b> A joint MOD/PJHQ delegation attended a Phase IV planning conference convened </p>
<p>by the US Joint Staff at CENTCOM in Tampa on 23 and 24 January.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Participants </p>
<p>addressed Phase IV planning in more detail than at the Washington talks on 22 January. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> The PJHQ record stated that the conference “substantially enhances confidence </p>
<p>in US planning”, but that:</p>
<p>“Significant strategic issues [are] not yet resolved, including whether the level of </p>
<p>ambition evident in US planning will be matched by US political will, and therefore </p>
<p>by resources.</p>
<p>“… The strength of the US approach to Phase IV … is that their plan has been </p>
<p>prepared in isolation, on the basis that the US needed to be ready to go it </p>
<p>‘alone, unafraid and unilateral’. As a result it is clear that they have a detailed </p>
<p>operational model that broadly covers all the bases and makes sense. Conversely, </p>
<p>the weakness of the US approach is that the plan has been developed on the </p>
<p>assumption that it can be implemented without the acceptance of, or interference </p>
<p>from, the international community.”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>104. </b> The MOD participants endorsed the PJHQ assessment.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> They stated that, </p>
<p>although the UK delegation had left Tampa “enormously heartened” by the level of </p>
<p>detail in US planning:</p>
<p>“… US military (and other) planners have made a number of very big assumptions </p>
<p>(eg that they will remain welcome) in developing plans for delivering success in the </p>
<p>aftermath. The lack of clarity on how the medium- to long-term objectives will be </p>
<p>delivered, and how these will be conditioned by the short term, was our greatest </p>
<p>area of concern.”</p>

<p><b>106. </b> Lieutenant General John Reith, Chief of Joint Operations (CJO), proposed the </p>
<p>creation of a Common Document to “capture the UK’s position across the range of </p>
<p>Phase IV issues” in a paper for the Chiefs of Staff on 27 January.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Lt Gen Reith stated that US planning had developed rapidly. It was based on a </p>
<p>single unified plan for Iraq with which Coalition partners would be expected to comply. </p>
<p>The US distinction between humanitarian assistance and post-conflict reconstruction </p>
<p>remained. USAID/CENTCOM plans for the former were “relatively well advanced”, with </p>
<p>the “Humanitarian Assistance Plan” already endorsed by President Bush. Reconstruction </p>
<p>options were “well-formed on paper”, but waiting on key strategic decisions. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Lt Gen Reith argued that the UK needed immediate engagement, at the right </p>
<p>levels, with a consistent message, if it was to influence US plans. He proposed a </p>
<p>document, with DFID and FCO buy-in, that would mirror the terminology used in </p>
<p>US planning and set out UK aspirations and potential involvement against each of </p>
<p>the current US planning objectives. Without it, it would be “difficult to deliver to our </p>
<p>embedded liaison staffs the necessary guidance that they require to shape early US </p>
<p>thinking, or to ensure that UK policy guidance is met”. That was needed as soon as </p>
<p>possible. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Lt Gen Reith proposed a two day planning seminar the following week. It would </p>
<p>need to be more than a “talking shop”. Its aim should be to deliver “an authoritative </p>
<p>account of ‘UK policy’”, to be validated by senior staff from across government before </p>
<p>being put to Ministers.</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the proposal at their meeting on 29 January. They </p>
<p>concluded that “the Phase IV Common Document … would establish a framework </p>

<p><b>116. </b> Mr Giles Paxman, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Paris, had </p>
<p>discussed UK thinking on post-Saddam Hussein Iraq with two senior French officials on </p>
<p>16 October 2002.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> One official was reported to have commented that he: </p>
<p>“… feared that the removal of Saddam would lead to general anarchy in Iraq with </p>
<p>attacks on Ba’ath Party symbols, settling of accounts and widespread violence </p>
<p>as in Albania. It might need a relatively authoritarian regime to re-establish order. </p>
<p>We should not rule out the possibility that this might be done by the Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>organisation.” </p>
<p><b>117. </b> In December, Mr Simon Fraser, FCO Director for Strategy and Innovation, reported </p>
<p>that a French interlocutor had:</p>
<p>“… argued that we needed to think carefully about the potential for political </p>
<p>disintegration in Iraq after a war. There could be many unforeseen consequences </p>
<p>including political instability motivated by revenge. We should not let the optimistic </p>
<p>scenarios blind us to the potential problems. The same went for the wider regional </p>
<p>implications.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>118. </b> The purpose of Mr Chilcott’s visit on 29 January was to be “as transparent as </p>
<p>possible” to “prepare the ground in case we had to move quickly on the day after, not </p>
<p>least so that the EU should be engaged at that point”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> Mr Chilcott reported that he </p>
<p>was struck by how far UK and French views converged. The officials he had seen </p>
<p>were confident France would want to play “a proactive role” in any aftermath, even if </p>
<p>they did not participate in the military operation, but they would not want to “dive into </p>
<p>a quagmire”. </p>

<p><b>121. </b> On 22 January, Mr Bowen consulted Mr Lee, Mr Chaplin and Dr Nicola Brewer, </p>

<p>63</p>

<p>and a more general paper by the MOD Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS).</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> Dr Brewer </p>
<p>observed “signs … that MOD and the military are beginning to take more seriously the </p>
<p>humanitarian implications for military planning and of any conflict”. </p>
<p><b>123. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary from 2002 to 2008, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that, from January 2002, there were much better links between military and </p>
<p>DFID planners: “until that point we didn’t have much of an idea of what military planning </p>
<p>consisted of and how humanitarian assistance should link into that”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>124. </b> Mr Bowen requested written comments on a revised draft of the military campaign </p>
<p>objectives on 28 January.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>125. </b> Dr Brewer informed DFID colleagues that the revised objectives incorporated </p>
<p>the main points she had made at a meeting chaired by Mr Bowen to discuss the draft. </p>
<p>Those were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to highlight humanitarian consequences of military action earlier in the </p>
<p>draft;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to factor in “stabilisation” objectives from the start, not just during the </p>
<p>“aftermath”; and</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Blair also listed a number of potential advantages in delaying military action by </p>

<p>working up more coherent post-conflict plans. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that delay would have opened “all sorts </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>137.  Officials explained that operational planning was constrained by the </b></p>
<p><b>continuing absence of an overall framework for post-conflict Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>138. </b> Section 3.6 describes the range of advice prepared for Mr Blair’s meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush on 31 January. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> Advice on post-conflict issues was included in a number of documents prepared </p>
<p>separately by the FCO, the MOD, the Cabinet Office and DFID. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Briefing prepared by the FCO included in its list of objectives: “To convince </p>
<p>President Bush … the US needs to pay much more attention, quickly, to planning on </p>
<p>‘day after’ issues; and that the UN needs to be central to it.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> Key messages included:</p>
<p>“–  </p>
<p>Our officials … need agreement from us [Mr Blair and President Bush] on overall </p>
<p>framework to carry out operational planning.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Coalition needs an overall ‘winning concept’. Should embrace both military </p>
<p>action and ‘day-after’ administration in Iraq. Would be pointless and damaging </p>
<p>to win war and lose peace.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Would be irresponsible to abandon Iraq quickly after toppling Saddam. Risk of </p>
<p>civil war would be real. And Iraq’s neighbours would get dragged in, creating </p>
<p>instability in the whole region.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>We must leave Iraq and region better off after our intervention. As well as </p>
<p>disposing of Iraq’s WMD and its oppressive security forces that means presiding </p>
<p>over wide political and economic reforms. Will take time to introduce and take </p>
<p>root, and will go beyond a military occupation. So international community is in </p>
<p>for long haul.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>All the evidence from the region suggests that Coalition forces will not be seen </p>
<p>as liberators for long, if at all. Our motives are regarded with huge suspicion. </p>
<p>The Iraqis, including those in exile, (and the Arabs more generally) want us gone </p>
<p>quickly. Our occupation and administration of Iraq will become more unpopular </p>
<p>and its lawfulness more debatable, the longer it continues.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Blunt fact is that in those circumstances any reforms are unlikely to stick. </p>
<p>Iraqis will need legitimate international presence holding the ring while they </p>
<p>themselves set up new, Iraqi, structures. Can’t foist these on them. Iraqi </p>
<p>opposition groups can be involved but should not be parachuted into power.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>So we should plan to keep period of government by military Coalition as short as </p>
<p>possible, and introduce quickly an international administration with UN blessing.</p>

<p>335</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Our joint irritation at some aspects of the UN should not blind us to the </p>
<p>significant advantages it can bring in Iraq after the conflict.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Iraqis more likely to accept a UN-mandated transitional administration than a </p>
<p>Coalition or US one. Same goes for Arab world …</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>By reducing hostility to the Coalition UN route reduces risk that our actions </p>
<p>serve as a recruiting sergeant for Islamist terrorist organisations.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Makes sense for UN to be in charge of oil revenues to avoid accusations </p>
<p>that aim of military action was to get control of oil.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>UN provides best forum for managing humanitarian agencies …</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>UN will make it easier for other countries to support practically and politically, </p>
<p>reforms we want.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>By making burden sharing easier, UN provides the best prospect of a clean </p>
<p>exit strategy.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>UN has the stamina to stay in Iraq for a long time, which will be needed for </p>
<p>our ambitious reforms to stick.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>UN’s record on transitional administrations is not perfect. But getting better with </p>
<p>experience …</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Understand US concern to keep control of military and security issues. Agree </p>
<p>UN should not take this on – at least, not at first …</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>… Can get best of both worlds: UN legitimisation and freedom of action with </p>
<p>a UNSC [UN Security Council] mandate …</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>UNSG [UN Secretary-General] must appoint right Special Representative …</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Restoring oil production will be an immediate challenge. Oil sector will need </p>
<p>some technology and a lot of capital. We must encourage an open investment </p>
<p>regime and a level playing field for foreign companies.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Our media and Parliament have not yet focused on day-after questions. But it </p>
<p>would be very difficult to sustain a UK contribution to day-after if our occupation </p>
<p>of Iraq were opposed, in Iraq and in region. Don’t want a repeat of the 1920s.”</p>
<p><b>141. </b> The background note stated that US hostility to the UN:</p>
<p>“… should not be allowed to prejudice the Coalition against the crucial advantages </p>
<p>it brings. Putting the UN in the centre of reforming Iraq, after the Coalition topples </p>
<p>Saddam is as important as following the UN route to disarm Iraq.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>336</p>
<p>“The way to present the case is to focus on the practical advantages of involving the </p>
<p>UN. But there is also the question of international legitimacy. We shall need UNSC </p>
<p>authorisation for practical purposes eg any change to the sanctions regime and to </p>
<p>the Oil-for-Food arrangements, as well as for the far-reaching reforms we plan to </p>
<p>introduce to Iraq. The lawfulness of an occupation, post-conflict, will also be related </p>
<p>to the lawfulness of the military action itself.” </p>
<p><b>142. </b> The note stated that the US was “putting a huge effort into humanitarian relief </p>
<p>and immediate post-conflict reconstruction, which the military expect to control”, but US </p>
<p>thinking on the transition between Coalition military administration and the transfer of </p>
<p>power to a new Iraqi government was “bogged down in inter-agency disputes”. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> On Iraqi exiles, the background note stated that they “can join the debate on Iraq’s </p>
<p>future but will have to test their credibility with the Iraqi people, not be parachuted in by </p>
<p>the US/UK”.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> The background note concluded that Mr Blair’s visit was well timed to influence </p>
<p>US planning:</p>
<p>“Without agreement, which can only come from President Bush and the Prime </p>
<p>Minister, on the overall framework for day-after, operational planning will continue </p>
<p>to be handicapped.” </p>
<p><b>145. </b> The briefing provided by the MOD included a section on “aftermath”.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> Suggested </p>
<p>lines for Mr Blair to use with President Bush included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no doubt the Coalition could win the war, but it was “equally certain </p>
<p>that we face a risk of ‘losing the peace’”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any post-conflict honeymoon would be brief, if it occurred at all.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Strategic questions about future governance were not academic and needed </p>
<p>answering quickly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Choices made early in the campaign “can shape – often irrevocably – our </p>
<p>options months, even years later”.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> The short Cabinet Office paper from Mr Drummond offered a “few OD Sec points, </p>
<p>just in case they slip through the briefing”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of offering a clear public vision for the future of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to press for agreement on the post-conflict role of the UN;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The humanitarian situation – described as “the one area where US Day After </p>

<p>listing three key issues from a humanitarian and developmental perspective:</p>

<p>note from UND suggesting additional material for a second resolution, which </p>
<p>would affirm the Security Council’s willingness to take on the post-conflict </p>
<p>administration of Iraq.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>UN involvement in the aftermath, where the UK delegation had made “some </p>
<p>impact” in the talks on 22 January, but which was “only likely to make progress if </p>
<p>the US side gets a signal from the President to take it seriously”.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Mr Chaplin advised that, even if the US remained unwilling to endorse a UN </p>
<p>administration specifically in a second resolution, it might be possible to agree </p>
<p>compromise language, “including reaffirmation of commitment to Iraq’s sovereignty </p>
<p>and territorial integrity, the UN’s readiness to help facilitate a political process to </p>

<p><b>154. </b> Mr Blair was told that detailed planning on humanitarian issues was progressing </p>
<p>well, but a dilemma remained over how to handle the transition to civil administration and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>Official-level discussions with the US</b></p>
<p><b>166.  On 29 January the US asked whether the UK would be prepared to take the </b></p>
<p><b>lead on restoring Iraq’s judicial system and police force in the two months after </b></p>
<p><b>regime change. </b></p>
<p><b>167.  The US also requested that the UK help it “get to grips” with war crimes.</b></p>
<p><b>168.  Mr Straw instructed officials to help on judicial and police issues “as much </b></p>
<p><b>as possible”, but “on the basis of what is practical”.</b></p>
<p><b>169. </b> On 29 January, Mr Peter Gooderham, Political Counsellor at the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington, reported that the NSC had asked whether the UK, as one of the Occupying </p>
<p>Powers, would be willing to take lead responsibility for getting the Iraqi judicial system </p>
<p>and police “up and running within 60 days” of regime change, and whether someone </p>
<p>from the UK could spend a week in Washington to help “get to grips” with war crimes.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The US would want the Coalition to deal with war crimes committed by Iraqis during </p>
<p>hostilities, but questions remained about prosecution of crimes from previous conflicts. </p>
<p>The NSC had been given two weeks to come up with answers. </p>
<p><b>170. </b> FCO officials advised Mr Straw that two junior officials planned to visit Washington </p>
<p>the following week to develop a joint policy on war crimes with the US, but that taking </p>
<p>lead responsibility for the judicial system and the police would be:</p>
<p>“… a massive undertaking, with implications for the UK’s role as an ‘Occupying </p>
<p>Power’, that should more properly be an international effort, mandated by the UN. </p>
<p>So we shall avoid getting drawn on this request.”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The FCO advice was copied to the Cabinet Office, but not to any other department.</p>
<p><b>172. </b> On 3 February, Mr Straw instructed that the UK “should help the US on police and </p>
<p>judicial matters as much as possible”, but accepted that “this help has to be on the basis </p>
<p>of what is practical”.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> He requested further advice after the next round of US/UK talks on </p>
<p>post-conflict issues. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> UK support for SSR and judicial issues is addressed in Section 12. </p>
<p><b>174.  At the trilateral UK/US/Australia UN working group on 5 February, the US </b></p>

<p><b>175.  Dr Rice was firm: there could be no high-level UN administrator or UN </b></p>
<p><b>involvement in running even technical Iraqi ministries.</b></p>
<p><b>176. </b> At the meeting of the trilateral UN working group in Washington on 5 February, the </p>
<p>UK delegation, headed by Mr Pattison, shared preliminary UK thinking on the potential </p>
<p>scope and structure of UN involvement in a transitional civil administration with a US </p>
<p>inter-agency team led by Mr Abrams.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Pattison reiterated that the UK believed that UN involvement in post-conflict </p>
<p>administration would produce political and practical benefits including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>local support for an international reforming presence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the potential for burden sharing and “capturing expertise”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>better prospects for an exit strategy.</p>
<p><b>178. </b> The UK understood that the US would seek to maintain freedom of operations on </p>
<p>security, SSR and the pursuit of WMD and war criminals, but the UK believed that it was </p>
<p>possible to devise a “hybrid” structure that would meet UK and US concerns and achieve </p>
<p>a prosperous, stable and representative Iraq. Mr Pattison added that “UN involvement </p>
<p>in an international presence was a top priority for the UK as the Prime Minister had told </p>
<p>Bush”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> The UK presented elements of a draft Security Council resolution, emphasising </p>
<p>that these did not represent an agreed UK position. Key elements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Coalition security presence with a broad security mandate, headed by a </p>
<p>US general;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a civilian transitional administration with a defined reformist mandate and </p>
<p>monitoring function, headed by a UN executive administrator;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a separate political process involving a Special Representative of the </p>
<p>Secretary-General along the lines of the Bonn (Afghanistan) or Dayton </p>
<p>(Bosnia Herzegovina) models;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a consultative mechanism to involve the Iraqi people; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Joint Implementation Board (JIB) consisting of representatives of the </p>
<p>international security presence and international civilian presence.</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Abrams commented that the UK seemed to envisage a much larger role for </p>
<p>the UN than the US had been considering. The US continued to be cautious about </p>
<p>embracing a more extensive role for the UN and was sceptical about the UN’s ability </p>
<p>to deliver. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>342</p>
<p><b>181. </b> After the talks, Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington, explained to Mr Abrams that the UK “very much hoped” to be consulted </p>
<p>before the US took decisions on areas in which the UK had “a crucial interest”, including </p>
<p>the post-conflict role of the UN and governance of the Iraqi oil sector. Mr Abrams </p>
<p>suggested that Sir David Manning should ask Dr Rice to share emerging US thinking.</p>
<p><b>182. </b> The British Embassy reported the next day that Mr Abrams had discussed </p>
<p>the UN role with Dr Rice.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Her view was firm: the US agreed that some kind of UN </p>
<p>mandate should be sought as the basis for post-conflict Coalition activity, but there </p>
<p>was no question of any high-profile UN role in administering the country. UN agencies’ </p>
<p>contribution to humanitarian relief and reconstruction would be crucial, but there could </p>
<p>be no high-level UN administrator or UN involvement in running even technical Iraqi </p>
<p>ministries.</p>
<p><b>183.  After the first meeting of the trilateral economic working group, UK officials </b></p>
<p><b>reported that DoD had prepared detailed contingency plans for Iraq’s oil industry, </b></p>
<p><b>but that there was “a conspicuous disconnect” between those plans and civilian </b></p>
<p><b>planning for economic development and management.</b></p>
<p><b>184. </b> The UK delegation to the meeting of the trilateral economic working group in </p>
<p>Washington on 5 February included representatives of the FCO, DFID, the Treasury, </p>
<p>the British Embassy and the UK Delegation to the IMF/IBRD (International Bank of </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Development).</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> The US delegation included a team from the State </p>
<p>Department and representatives of DoD, USAID, the NSC and the US Treasury.</p>
<p><b>185. </b> The British Embassy reported that the working group had agreed to co-operate on </p>
<p>defining practical economic steps to be taken in the first three to six months of military </p>
<p>occupation. The UK would contribute its ideas by 14 February. </p>
<p><b>186. </b> US thinking on short-term reconstruction was reported to be at an early stage. </p>
<p>Little thought had been given to the financing gap that might arise if Iraqi oil output were </p>
<p>severely constrained. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> The Embassy reported that DoD had detailed contingency plans to protect </p>
<p>and restore the oil sector and was well aware of the importance of that sector for </p>
<p>reconstruction. In the best case (minimal damage, current levels of output restored </p>
<p>after two to three months) it estimated that the sector could make a net contribution </p>
<p>of US$12bn in the first year after any conflict; in the worst case it could be a net cost </p>
<p>of US$8bn.</p>

<p><b>188. </b> The Embassy also reported that US planning on longer-term external financing </p>
<p>had made little progress.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> The US recognised the difficult external financial challenges </p>
<p>that were facing Iraq in the longer term and agreed to the early informal involvement of </p>
<p>international financial institutions (IFIs). It favoured rescheduling rather than forgiveness </p>
<p>of Iraq’s Paris Club debt and inclined towards extending rather than cancelling </p>
<p>compensation payments for damage caused by the 1991 invasion of Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> The UK delegation stressed that early progress was important. Donors needed </p>
<p>some certainty about Iraqi liabilities before they would be prepared to commit substantial </p>
<p>new resources.</p>
<p><b>190. </b> The FCO member of the UK delegation, the Economic Adviser for the Middle East </p>
<p>and North Africa, reported separately to Mr Drummond that the UK participants had </p>
<p>stressed that a substantial UN role in the transitional post-conflict administration was </p>
<p>“not only politically important but crucial to hopes of effective financial burden-sharing </p>
<p>and key to the early attraction of investment in the oil sector”.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“DoD are ploughing ahead with detailed contingency planning for the oil sector in </p>
<p>the initial military administration phase. But – apart from USAID preparations on the </p>
<p>humanitarian side – there was a conspicuous disconnect between this and civilian </p>
<p>planning for economic management and policy development within Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>191. </b> The FCO delegate reported that it had also been agreed that the UK and US would </p>
<p>approach the IMF and IBRD separately to make clear there was a major role for both </p>
<p>organisations and to encourage them to step up their analysis and contingency planning. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p><b>Preparations by UN humanitarian agencies were as good as could </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>194. </b> On 30 January, Mrs Caroline Spelman, Opposition spokesperson for International </p>
<p>Development, introduced an Opposition Day debate in the House of Commons on </p>
<p>humanitarian contingency planning. She contrasted the Government’s “worrying silence” </p>
<p>on humanitarian aspects of war in Iraq with the numerous statements from Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>Mr Straw on the military build-up and diplomatic activity, and sought reassurances from </p>
<p>Ms Short that there were “comprehensive humanitarian contingency plans” in place.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>195. </b> In response, Ms Short stated:</p>
<p>“It is necessary to prepare to minimise harm if military action is taken and to make </p>
<p>arrangements for the reconstruction of the country as rapidly as possible. To </p>
<p>achieve that, we need to ensure that the UN takes the lead in the reconstruction, </p>
<p>as it did in Kosovo, East Timor and Afghanistan. That needs to be agreed across </p>
<p>the international community.”</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Ms Short explained that:</p>
<p>“All parties have recently been more willing to prepare for all contingencies, </p>
<p>including the military in the United States of America, but it has not been easy to </p>
<p>get discussions and analysis going across the international system to prepare for </p>
<p>all those. Anyone who pauses to reflect intelligently on the strains and tensions </p>
<p>across the international system because of the crisis would realise why that has </p>
<p>been difficult … but my department has been working for a considerable time on all </p>
<p>contingencies. That work is developing and we are getting more co-operation from </p>
<p>some of our international partners which was difficult to get before.” </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Ms Short reported that Iraq’s infrastructure was:</p>
<p>“… in chronic disrepair. Hospitals, clinics, sanitation facilities and water treatment </p>
<p>plants suffer from a terrible lack of maintenance. The result is that the Iraqi people’s </p>
<p>lives are perilously fragile. Their coping strategies have been worn away by years </p>
<p>of misrule. The public facilities to help them cope are run down, often to the point </p>
<p>of uselessness.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>198. </b> Preparations by UN humanitarian organisations and the UN Office for the </p>
<p>Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) were “as good as they can be”, but </p>
<p>given the number of risks and uncertainties, it was very difficult to prepare. </p>
<p><b>199. </b> Ms Short set out five humanitarian risks of military action: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “very serious risk” of “large-scale ethnic fighting”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to water and sanitation facilities as a result of attacks on electricity </p>
<p>supplies to Iraqi anti-aircraft facilities;</p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>disruption to OFF; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>use of CBW.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> Ms Short added that collaboration between military and humanitarian planners </p>
<p>needed to keep improving.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> She warned that the international humanitarian system was </p>
<p>“under considerable strain” with:</p>
<p>“… enormously complicated problems with drought and food shortages in southern </p>
<p>Africa, the horn of Africa and Angola. Every day five million people in Afghanistan </p>
<p>need food aid, and the humanitarian situation on the west bank and Gaza is very </p>
<p>serious and getting worse. My department’s resources and those of the international </p>
<p>humanitarian system are therefore strained.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> In response to a question from Mr Crispin Blunt (Conservative) about the resources </p>
<p>available to DFID, Ms Short explained that the UK contribution to any international </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis, as determined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and </p>
<p>Development (OECD), was just over 5 percent of the total. She cautioned that, faced </p>
<p>with demands elsewhere, the international humanitarian system and DFID’s own budget </p>
<p>were strained: “We will play our part in the international system, but the Department is </p>
<p>not flush with resources – I must frankly warn the House that they are short.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>202.  At the end of January, officials advised Ms Short that the UK might be </b></p>
<p><b>expected to make a contribution to humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>that was much larger than DFID’s contingency reserve. </b></p>
<p><b>203. </b> On 21 January, at Ms Short’s request, Mr Alistair Fernie, Head of DFID Middle </p>
<p>East and North Africa Department, advised “how to maximise the chances of securing </p>
<p>additional funding from the Treasury to cover the costs of [a] DFID humanitarian </p>
<p>response”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Fernie recommended that Ms Short should speak, rather than write, to </p>
<p>Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. A letter would invite a formal </p>
<p>response, and Treasury officials were likely to caution Mr Brown against providing any </p>
<p>broad assurance on funding and might recommend that DFID “unpick” its 2003/04 </p>
<p>spending plan, to be agreed shortly, in order to provide more funding for Iraq. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Fernie continued:</p>
<p>“Mr [Mark] Lowcock’s [DFID Director Finance and Corporate Performance] advice </p>
<p>is that the best time to extract maximum funds from the central Reserve is when </p>
<p>the political pressure is at its height. We might guess that such a time will come in </p>
<p>a month or so – by which time budgets for our existing programmes would be more </p>
<p>secure, with our 2003/04 framework finalised and on its way to publication.”</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Ms Short commented: “No – I don’t want to ring Ch X [the Chancellor of the </p>
<p>Exchequer] … I wanted to put humanitarian considerations into Gov[ernment] mind not </p>
<p>just to squeeze some money.”</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> Rather than write or speak to Mr Brown, she would </p>
<p>write to Mr Blair. That letter was sent on 5 February.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>207. </b> On 31 January, in response to a further request from Ms Short, a DFID official </p>
<p>provided advice on how much the UK might be expected to contribute to “humanitarian </p>
<p>relief/reconstruction” in Iraq.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Assuming the UK provided 5.6 percent of the total </p>
<p>humanitarian/reconstruction costs (in line with the UK’s share of OECD Gross National </p>
<p>Income), the UK’s contribution could reach US$640m (£400m) a year for the next </p>
<p>three years.</p>
<p><b>208. </b> The official added:</p>
<p>“It is important to consider that DFID ‘traditionally’ (Balkans/Afghanistan) contributes </p>
<p>between 8-10 percent for total relief/reconstruction costs … This would mean that </p>
<p>under a high case military scenario, with low oil revenues and where reparation/debt </p>
<p>claims are not reduced, <b>annual costs to HMG</b> [Her Majesty’s Government] <b>could </b></p>
<p><b>be in excess of US$1bn</b>.”</p>
<p><b>209. </b> The minutes of the 3 February FCO Iraq Morning Meeting recorded that DFID </p>
<p>was coming under pressure to step up its humanitarian planning after the House of </p>
<p>Commons debate on 30 January.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> Dr Brewer had explained to the meeting that there </p>
<p>were serious domestic and international financial constraints.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> DFID’s financial resources are addressed in more detail in Section 13.1.</p>
<p><b>211.  FCO lawyers advised UK participants in the post-Washington talks on the </b></p>

<p>thinking on the issue, but that he had not yet discussed the issue with DoD.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Mr Grainger’s paper stated:</p>
<p>“The rights of Coalition forces to occupy Iraq following a conflict would be closely </p>
<p>related to their rights under international law to use force. It is likely that those rights </p>
<p>will be based on the express or implicit authorisation of the United Nations Security </p>
<p>Council … to be interpreted within the overall objective of Iraqi compliance with </p>
<p>disarmament obligations imposed by the Security Council and the requirement for </p>
<p>restoring international peace and security in any area … As regards Occupation </p>
<p>post-conflict, the authorisation will again only justify such steps as are necessary </p>
<p>to achieve the above objectives.</p>
<p>“To the extent that Iraq came under Coalition control during the course of any conflict </p>
<p>the rights and obligations of the Coalition would be those of an Occupying Power, as </p>
<p>set out in detail in Articles 42 to 56 of the Regulations annexed to Hague Convention </p>
<p>IV of 1907, and in Geneva Convention IV … of 1949 … In general, the Occupying </p>
<p>Power must take all measures in its power to restore and ensure public safety by </p>
<p>respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the law in the occupied State … Detailed </p>
<p>provisions include limited rights to take possession of and use state property …; </p>
<p>to remove officials and judges …; and to amend the penal laws of the occupying </p>
<p>territory … The Geneva Convention also provides a comprehensive code on the </p>
<p>protection of the civilian population and internees.</p>
<p>“In these and other areas it is likely that aspects of reconstruction of institutions </p>
<p>and infrastructure post-conflict could fall outside the competencies of an Occupying </p>
<p>Power under international law. For these reasons it is important that a further </p>
<p>Security Council resolution be adopted under Chapter VII as soon as possible to </p>
<p>confer upon the Coalition and/or other States and international organisations as </p>
<p>appropriate the necessary powers … A United Nations administration would not be </p>

<p><b>Parliamentary discussion of post-conflict issues, 3 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>216.  In Parliament on 3 February, Mr Blair offered “absolute assurances” that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK would deal with any humanitarian consequences of conflict and undertook to </b></p>
<p><b>“try to ensure that we move in to help get Iraq back on its feet”. </b></p>
<p><b>217. </b> Mr Mandelson asked Mr Blair about preparations for recovery and reconstruction </p>
<p>in the House of Commons on 3 February: </p>
<p>“In addition to the need for political transition, the humanitarian and refugee </p>
<p>demands could be immense. Will he outline to the House what preparation is </p>
<p>being made for that at the United Nations and by key members of the international </p>
<p>community? What structure for reconstruction is being put in place? In terms of </p>
<p>donor funding, will Britain join America – and, I think Switzerland and Canada – in </p>
<p>making an early offer of resources for those purposes?”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr Blair replied: </p>
<p>“… we must deal with those vital points. We are in discussion with allies and the </p>
<p>United Nations about reconstruction. The Foreign Secretary and I have spoken </p>
<p>to the Secretary-General of the United Nations about that. If there is a conflict </p>
<p>and Saddam’s regime is removed, it is important to give absolute assurances </p>
<p>and undertakings to the people of Iraq that we shall deal with any humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences. In such circumstances, we must also try to ensure that we move </p>
<p>in to help get Iraq back on its feet as quickly as possible. This country is willing </p>
<p>to play its part in that with others.”</p>
<p><b>219. </b> In answer to a question from Mr Tony Baldry (Conservative) about the extent of </p>
<p>discussions taking place with UN agencies, Mr Blair replied that detailed discussions </p>
<p>were under way and that: “We are well aware that we must have a humanitarian plan </p>
<p>that is every bit as viable and well worked out as a military plan.”</p>
<p>107</p>

<p><b>220. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the worry at the time, was that there would be some kind of humanitarian </p>

<p>108</p>
<p><b>221.  In early February, Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw that the 22 January </b></p>
<p><b>Washington talks had made little progress on the principle of UN involvement in </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict administration, and that the US envisaged the UK being responsible </b></p>
<p><b>for administering one-fifth of Iraq. The UK risked being drawn into a “huge” and </b></p>
<p><b>“complex” commitment in Iraq for an uncertain period. </b></p>
<p><b>222.  Mr Ricketts recommended using a series of forthcoming Ministerial contacts </b></p>
<p><b>at Cabinet level, which he described as a moment of “maximum leverage” on the </b></p>
<p><b>US, to press the case for UN involvement. </b></p>
<p><b>223. </b> In his minute to Mr Straw on 7 February, copied to Mr O’Brien, Sir Michael Jay </p>
<p>(FCO PUS), and other FCO senior officials, Mr Ricketts stated:</p>
<p>“As we approach the critical phase on Iraq, I thought it would be useful to look ahead </p>
<p>to the decisions that will be needed on issues where the FCO is leading and set out </p>
<p>the work coming forward to the Foreign Secretary.”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Ricketts reported on the follow-up to the 22 January post-conflict talks in </p>
<p>Washington. He stated that Mr Pattison had led a team “to have another go at getting </p>
<p>into the US bloodstream the advantages of UN authorisation and involvement of the UN </p>
<p>and its agencies in the civil administration of Iraq. He made a bit of headway. But this is </p>
<p>water on a stone.” Meanwhile, the Pentagon was accelerating planning for a Pentagon-</p>
<p>run “aftermath organisation” under a US civil administrator alongside the continuing US </p>
<p>military presence. With the US envisaging the UK being responsible for administering </p>
<p>one-fifth of Iraq, “we risk being drawn into a huge commitment of UK resources for a </p>
<p>highly complex task of administration and law and order for an uncertain period”.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Ricketts continued:</p>
<p>“So we have a pressing interest in convincing the Americans to accept the benefits </p>
<p>of a model giving the UN the lead on civil administration. Coalition military forces </p>
<p>would then be responsible for carrying out security tasks, including dealing with </p>
<p>WMD, while a civilian transitional administration would be set up headed by a UN </p>
<p>executive administrator and drawing on the resources of the UN, IFIs and a broad </p>
<p>range of countries, as well as involving Iraqis themselves in the administration as </p>
<p>quickly as possible. This would not only be more realistic and sustainable, but also </p>
<p>be much more acceptable to Arab opinion than US/UK military-led occupation. (It is </p>
<p>also a further argument for getting a second resolution in advance of conflict, which </p>
<p>may be one reason for the allergic reaction in parts of the US system to a UN-led </p>
<p>administration.)</p>

<p>“This is a key issue with huge resource implications. Now is our moment of </p>

<p><b>226. </b> Mr Ricketts also informed Mr Straw that there was inter-departmental agreement </p>
<p>that “the FCO should lead policy work on planning for post-conflict Iraq”. The first task </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Mr Bowen explained to participants at the meeting that there was “a good deal </p>
<p>of uncertainty about American intentions in administering Iraq in the event of (and after) </p>
<p>hostilities to remove Saddam Hussein’s regime”. Meetings in Washington that week </p>
<p>should bring greater clarity but were unlikely to produce decisions. </p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Bowen reported that participants at the meeting had recognised that:</p>
<p>“… even if some of the big strategic issues remained unresolved, a lot of detailed </p>
<p>management issues were likely to arise. Much was likely to emanate from </p>
<p>CENTCOM, which had the prospectively imminent task of administering a country </p>
<p>whose leadership had been removed. With this in mind we agreed that we should </p>
<p>set up an Iraq Operational Policy Unit with contributions from the FCO, DFID </p>
<p>and MOD … My view was that we needed an integrated unit with high calibre </p>
<p>representation to work through the sort of issues that would confront the Coalition </p>
<p>on the ‘day after’. <b>Their initial remit would be to develop policy guidance to </b></p>
<p><b>enable the administration of Iraq pending the appointment of a transitional </b></p>
<p><b>civil administration, consistent as far as possible with the longer term vision </b></p>
<p><b>for the future of Iraq.</b> They would need to work their way, with the US, through </p>
<p>issues as diverse as humanitarian relief, policing, administration of justice, local </p>
<p>government and provision of utilities, environmental recovery and priorities for the </p>
<p>return to normality. The view we all reached was that this unit ought to be up and </p>
<p>running from Monday 10 February … It will need staff who think strategically and </p>
<p>operationally and have some background in state reconstruction from other cases </p>
<p>(in order to feed in the lessons of eg Kosovo and Afghanistan).”</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Bowen explained that the new unit would work alongside the FCO consular and </p>
<p>emergency units (described in more detail in the Box ‘The FCO Emergency Unit’ later in </p>
<p>this Section), and with the Defence Crisis Management Centre (DCMC) in MOD and the </p>
<p>Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) in DFID. </p>
<p><b>241. </b> The UK’s expectation was that:</p>
<p>“… General Franks of CENTCOM will be in overall charge of Iraq, with the military </p>
<p>chain of command operating, which would involve [Major] General [Robin] Brims </p>
<p>[General Officer Commanding 1st (UK) Armoured Division (GOC 1 (UK) Div)], being </p>
<p>in charge of a sector of Iraq. Brims would need civilian support in theatre (beyond an </p>
<p>MOD Polad [policy adviser]), but it was too early to judge at what level; it was clear </p>
<p>that there would need to be FCO and DFID input. The extent to which the US were </p>
<p>planning on providing civil support to a British sector was as yet unclear.”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Bowen reported that participants at the meeting had identified other possible </p>
<p>requirements, including “a British office in the UK sector, a special envoy and an </p>
<p>Ambassador”. The new unit was only the first step. </p>

<p>He asked Mr Ehrman, Ms Miller, Mr Pollard and Brig Rollo to take action to set up the </p>
<p>unit and reported that Sir David Manning supported the thrust of the proposed approach.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The Chiefs of Staff meeting on 5 February was informed that: “Output from the </p>
<p>FCO unit would feed US planning through the newly appointed Major General Tim </p>

<p>116</p>
<p> The unit would </p>
<p>be informed by the PJHQ seminar on post-conflict issues. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Ricketts explained to Mr Straw that the new unit would be headed by </p>
<p>Mr Chilcott, located in the FCO’s Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Directorate and </p>
<p>include participants from the MOD and DFID. It would be closely linked to the Cabinet </p>

<p><b>246. </b> The IPU, headed by Mr Chilcott, was established on 10 February.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>247. </b> On 11 February, Mr O’Brien chaired an internal FCO briefing on post-conflict </p>
<p>issues, at which he commissioned work from the IPU and “stressed the need to consider </p>
<p>how our work fitted into a managed exit strategy”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> Mr O’Brien suggested that other </p>
<p>Arab states’ contribution to the modernisation of Iraq “would assist in [the] process of </p>
<p>exiting and handover”.</p>
<p><b>248. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq Evening Meeting on 27 February stated that Mr Straw </p>
<p>had asked Mr O’Brien to focus on post-conflict issues.</p>

<p><b>249. </b> The Inquiry has seen no other evidence of that decision or explanation of the role </p>

<p>“The main purpose of the unit will be to provide policy guidance on the practical </p>

<p>and promotes the UK’s policy objectives on the future of Iraq. In doing so it will </p>

<p>“AHGI receives updates on military and intelligence issues, but these issues are </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>358</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Steers were needed for Maj Gen Brims and two UK officers in “key planning </p>
<p>positions”: Brigadier Albert Whitley (Senior British Land Adviser (SBLA) at </p>
<p>the Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC) in Kuwait) and </p>
<p>Maj Gen Cross,</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> working to Lt Gen Garner in ORHA.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq Morning Meeting on 6 February stated that: “PJHQ have </p>
<p>a large number of practical questions, on which they need urgent policy guidance.”</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Maj Gen Whitley told the Inquiry that US Lieutenant General David McKiernan, </p>
<p>Coalition Forces Land Component Commander, had initially asked him to lead on </p>
<p>planning for “post hostilities” and to be his “eyes and ears” on the subject with other </p>
<p>headquarters.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> With the creation of ORHA and the augmentation of CFLCC by </p>
<p>Combined Joint Task Force 7 (CJTF-7, the post-invasion military command), Lt Gen </p>
<p>McKiernan, who already had deputies for Operations and Support, had felt it essential </p>
<p>that the then Brigadier Whitley be given more authority. In mid-February 2003, with </p>
<p>the agreement of Lt Gen Reith, Lt Gen McKiernan appointed Brigadier Whitley Deputy </p>
<p>Commanding General (Post Hostilities), with the rank of (acting) Major General. </p>
<p><b>270. </b> Maj Gen Whitley told the Inquiry he was instructed to: “Do what you can, with what </p>
<p>we have and when we can. Produce a plan for CFLCC for Phase IV.” That plan came </p>
<p>to be known as Eclipse II and is described in the Box ‘Eclipse II – the CFLCC plan for </p>
<p>Phase IV’ later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>271. </b> MOD officials briefed Mr Hoon on the IPU and the Common Document on </p>
<p>12 February:</p>
<p>“In the UK officials have set about establishing a bespoke structure that will provide </p>
<p>policy guidance on aftermath issues – initially, principally to the UK military, but also </p>
<p>more widely …</p>
<p>“Central to this effort is the Iraq Policy Unit [sic] … Advising this in an expert capacity </p>
<p>is the Iraq Aftermath Strategic Planning Group in the MOD. The main effort of the </p>
<p>IPU is to populate a document (‘The Iraq Stage IV Subjects Document’) that is </p>
<p>essentially a structured list of questions with answers that will allow departments </p>
<p>to give policy guidance, and will form a ‘core script’ that will permit our various </p>
<p>personnel embedded in US structures to give a unified message on the UK vision </p>
<p>for post-conflict Iraq. Many of these are issues of detail, but they have real practical </p>
<p>import (for example – whether the US plans to dollarize the Iraqi economy will affect </p>
<p>the currency that is issued to 1 Div, who will need to pay contractors in their AO </p>
<p>[Area of Operations]).”</p>

<p><b>272. </b> A briefing note prepared for staff in the UK National Contingent Headquarters </p>
<p>(NCHQ) in Qatar referred to a revised version of the Common Document dated </p>
<p>11 February that has not been seen by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>273. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence that the IPU updated the Common Document </p>
<p>during preparations for the US inter-agency Rock Drill on post-conflict issues on 21 and </p>
<p>22 February.</p>
<p><b>274. </b> The Rock Drill is addressed in detail later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> On 20 February, Mr Chilcott updated Mr Straw on the first nine days of the IPU. </p>
<p>It had “a core staff (from FCO, MOD and DFID), a large room, and IT”. The Unit was </p>
<p>working well with other departments and UK military planners and had “successfully </p>
<p>contracted out a lot of work”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>276. </b> Mr Chilcott told Mr Straw that ORHA was emerging as the IPU’s key counterpart </p>
<p>in the US and that Maj Gen Cross and the IPU were “two sides of the same coin and </p>
<p>[would] work increasingly hand in glove”. </p>
<p><b>277. </b> Mr Chilcott told the Inquiry that, although numbers were small (“maybe only </p>
<p>six, eight, ten, for the first couple of weeks”), the IPU drew on expertise elsewhere in </p>
<p>Whitehall that allowed it to pull together a strategic view.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> While military planners and </p>
<p>PJHQ were planning what would be needed as troops occupied territory and became </p>
<p>“responsible … for the administration of where they were”, the IPU was “thinking about </p>
<p>the political process and the big issues about the development fund for Iraq or oil policy </p>
<p>or what to do about war criminals or the importance of legitimacy and legal questions”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Asked how influential the IPU had been, Mr Chilcott stated:</p>
<p>“… I don’t think our main issue was having to convince other parts of the </p>
<p>government machinery that they should be doing things that they didn’t want to do. </p>
<p>“I think we were really synthesising the views and expertise across government.</p>
<p>“Where we needed to have clout … was in influencing the United States, and I think, </p>
<p>there, we … had no more clout than a sort of body of middle to senior ranking British </p>
<p>officials would have had with their American counterparts.”</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>279. </b> On the relationship with ORHA, Mr Chilcott said that: “ORHA in some ways weren’t </p>
<p>really our counterparts because they were the sort of operational implementers … </p>
<p>as well as the drawers up of the plan, whereas we … were writing policy papers and </p>
<p>briefing and lines to take.”</p>

<p><b>280. </b> Mr Bowen told the Inquiry that one reason for establishing the IPU was to set up a </p>
<p>counterpart to ORHA: “as soon as we … understood where the centre of gravity was in </p>
<p>America … we set up … a centre of gravity that could interact with it”. At this early stage </p>
<p>in the relationship, before misgivings about ORHA had begun to emerge in Whitehall, </p>
<p>that seemed still to be the intention. </p>

<p><b>281.  On 3 February, Maj Gen Brims told UK military commanders that, in the event </b></p>

<p>in Operation (Op) TELIC</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> on 3 February.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> It stated: “We only win on successful </p>
<p>implementation of Phase IV”, and continued:</p>
<p>“The Phase IV requirements have yet to emerge. I am confident that our people </p>
<p>have the physical and mental agility to attend to it quickly, thoughtfully and effectively </p>
<p>… But two important points:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>There must be no triumphalism … we must restore, foster, Iraqi dignity in </p>
<p>our AO and work together as far as possible to achieve Phase IV for their </p>
<p>benefit.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>We shall probably be the first Coalition forces to implement Phase IV. We </p>
<p>can set the pace. The world media will be reporting our activities.”</p>

<p>humanitarian consequences of any conflict in Iraq are fully addressed”.</p>

<p><b>286. </b> Ms Short informed Mr Blair on 5 February that, “after a slow start”, DFID was </p>
<p>“getting real co-operation” from the MOD, FCO and Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> It was involved </p>
<p>in drafting military campaign objectives and was experiencing more co-operation from </p>
<p>UN agencies and the US. Ms Short reported that she had approved a limited number of </p>
<p>DFID secondments to UK and US military planning units. </p>
<p><b>287. </b> Ms Short stated that the main outstanding issue was the scale of the UK </p>
<p>contribution to the humanitarian and reconstruction effort in Iraq. A “fair share” would </p>
<p>be about 5.6 percent of the total, equivalent to the UK share of OECD gross national </p>
<p>income, and would amount to approximately £440m a year for three years. It was for </p>
<p>Mr Blair to decide whether he thought the UK should make a “modest” contribution along </p>
<p>those lines, or “aim higher”. If so, it would need to be an effort on behalf of the whole </p>
<p>government, not just DFID. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> Ms Short concluded:</p>
<p>“I think the way in which you could best help is to make clear across the system that </p>
<p>you want humanitarian considerations to be given more weight. In addition it would </p>
<p>help if we could settle the financial questions.” </p>
<p><b>289. </b> The same day, Mr Lee sent Mr Hoon a request from Ms Short to be briefed by </p>

<p>briefed “on similar lines” to Mr Straw and Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Lee debated whether the briefing should focus on post-conflict issues, but concluded: </p>
<p>“As full and frank a briefing within the constraints of operational security will be a key </p>
<p>element in achieving a joined up approach and help build on the good relationships </p>
<p>we have set up over the last few weeks.” He also advised that No.10 had asked to be </p>

<p>362</p>
<p><b>294. </b> At a press conference after the meeting of the Security Council on 5 February </p>
<p>(addressed in Section 3.7), Mr Annan stated that, after any conflict, “the UN always had </p>
<p>a role to play”.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> He added that the post-conflict role of the UN in Iraq:</p>
<p>“… has not been discussed. As you know, we are doing some contingency </p>
<p>planning on the humanitarian side. This is also something that we have given some </p>
<p>preliminary thought to, but we are not there at all.”</p>
<p><b>295.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 February that planning for the aftermath and </b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian relief needed “greater emphasis”. </b></p>

<p><b>297. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 February that “planning for the aftermath of military </p>

<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>298. </b> Mr Straw said that the aftermath was “being discussed intensively” with Ms Short </p>
<p>and Mr Hoon. </p>
<p><b>299. </b> Points made in discussion included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The word “aftermath” was “ill-chosen: it incorrectly implied that Iraq would be </p>
<p>utterly destroyed by military conflict whereas we should gear our thinking around </p>
<p>the future of the people of Iraq and their interests”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reconstruction and development of Iraq would “provide opportunities for </p>
<p>British companies to be involved”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The focus after hostilities “had to be on civil society which had suffered 35 years </p>
<p>of tyranny that had reduced the country to the point where 60 percent of the </p>
<p>population relied on United Nations food programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “essential” that the UN should be involved in Iraq’s redevelopment after </p>
<p>any military action “to avoid the military occupation being viewed as an army of </p>
<p>occupation”.</p>
<p><b>300. </b> On 6 February, Mr Blair held a meeting with Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and senior officials </p>
<p>from the MOD, the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), No.10 and the Cabinet Office </p>

<p><b>302. </b> The request appears to have been overtaken by a further Ministerial meeting on </p>
<p>humanitarian issues on 13 February at which DFID, the FCO and the MOD were asked </p>
<p>by Mr Blair to co-ordinate advice for him to use with President Bush.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>303. </b> In separate letters to Mr Blair on 10 February, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon endorsed </p>
<p>Ms Short’s views on improved co-operation between departments. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> Mr Straw told Mr Blair that DFID, the MOD and the Cabinet Office had been  </p>
<p>co-operating closely on humanitarian issues.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> Work on humanitarian and other  </p>
<p>long-term planning issues would be strengthened by the creation of the IPU. </p>
<p><b>305. </b> Mr Straw commented that humanitarian planning was the area of “long-term work” </p>
<p>where the UK probably had fewest differences with the US. It was an area, unlike some </p>
<p>others, where the US seemed to agree on the need for close UN involvement. The US </p>
<p>and UK Missions in New York were working on the fine-tuning of OFF arrangements to </p>
<p>make them better suited to the circumstances of post-conflict Iraq. In addition, the US </p>
<p>military was: </p>
<p>“… developing detailed plans for relief and reconstruction teams to follow in the </p>
<p>wake of advancing military forces in Iraq to begin immediately the urgent tasks of </p>
<p>restoring water and electricity supplies and repairing public buildings. The US are </p>
<p>clearly aware of the importance of delivering quick wins to show the Iraqi people and </p>
<p>the world the benefits of Coalition action.”</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Mr Straw explained that much work remained to be done on economic </p>
<p>reconstruction. An inter-departmental visit to Washington that week had revealed that, </p>
<p>although there were, “as always”, clear differences between US government agencies, </p>
<p>there did still seem to be an opportunity to influence their thinking. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> Mr Hoon responded to Ms Short’s question about the scale of the UK humanitarian </p>
<p>contribution.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> He accepted that, in the “very short term”, the UK military would play </p>
<p>“a very significant role”, but early thought would also need to be given to the timing of </p>
<p>transition to purely civil structures. The key issue was to resolve differences with the </p>
<p>US over the role of the UN.</p>
<p><b>308.  A JIC Assessment on 10 February warned of the possibility of terrorist </b></p>
<p><b>attacks against Coalition Forces in Iraq, during and after conflict.</b></p>
<p><b>309. </b> On 10 February, at the request of the MOD and the FCO, the JIC produced its </p>
<p>second Assessment on the potential terrorist threat in the event of conflict in Iraq.</p>

<p>364</p>
<p><b>311. </b> The “Key Judgements” in the February Assessment included:</p>
<p>“I. </p>
<p>The threat from Al Qaida will increase at the onset of any military action against </p>
<p>Iraq. They will target Coalition forces and other Western interests in the Middle </p>
<p>East. Attacks against Western interests elsewhere are also likely, especially in </p>
<p>the US and UK for maximum impact. The worldwide threat from other Islamist </p>
<p>terrorist groups and individuals will increase significantly.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>III. </p>
<p>Al Qaida associated terrorists in Iraq and in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone </p>
<p>in Northern Iraq could conduct attacks against Coalition forces and interests </p>
<p>during, or in the aftermath of, war with Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> An updated Assessment, produced on 12 March, judged that: “Senior Al Qaida </p>
<p>associated terrorists may have established sleeper cells in Iraq, to be activated during </p>
<p>a Coalition occupation.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>313.  Treasury briefing for Mr Brown on 11 February warned of the possibility </b></p>
<p><b>of substantial pressure on the UK to make a disproportionate contribution to </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>314. </b> On 11 February, Treasury officials invited Mr Brown’s views on their “preliminary </p>
<p>thinking” on the Treasury’s interests in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> The paper </p>
<p>drew on earlier Treasury work in September 2002 on the implications of war in Iraq </p>
<p>for the global, regional and Iraqi economies.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> Officials advised that the Treasury’s </p>
<p>main interest was to ensure Iraq’s prosperity and stability while sharing fairly the cost </p>
<p>of achieving that outcome. The cost was difficult to predict but “potentially massive”. </p>
<p>It comprised: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>peacekeeping costs; the peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia had numbered </p>
<p>40,000 at its peak, with the cost to the UK of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) reaching </p>
<p>£325m in 1999/2000. Iraq would probably need more troops, given its ethnic and </p>
<p>religious tensions, the likelihood of score-settling and its sheer size;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>humanitarian expenditure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>environmental costs arising, for example, from the use of WMD or oil fires;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“general reconstruction”, which could cost between US$1.5bn and US$8bn a </p>
<p>year (including humanitarian costs); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic stabilisation, through an IMF programme.</p>

<p><b>The UK was planning on a contingency basis for what the international </b></p>
<p><b>community should do if Saddam Hussein were removed.</b></p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>Timing of the three stage transition was uncertain.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq’s public administration could be expected to work “adequately” once </b></p>

<p><b>The role of the UN was still a matter of active debate.</b></p>
<p><b>320. </b> On 7 February, the FCO sent guidance on “day after” issues to all overseas </p>
<p>posts.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> The guidance stated that the UK’s goal was disarmament of Iraq’s WMD, not </p>
<p>regime change, but that, since military action could not be ruled out, it was “sensible to </p>
<p>plan on a contingency basis, for what the international community should do in Iraq” if </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime were removed from power. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p><b>321. </b> In the background material for posts, not to be used with external contacts, the </p>
<p>FCO explained that Coalition Forces would become the de facto government of Iraq as </p>
<p>soon as Saddam Hussein fell. The UK would aim to hand back power to the Iraqi people </p>
<p>as quickly as possible, but would want to see Iraq “radically reformed for the better” </p>
<p>before doing so. </p>
<p><b>322. </b> The FCO explained that the timing of the three stage transition was uncertain. </p>
<p>Coalition military rule was likely to last as long as it took to establish a civilian </p>
<p>transitional administration, “perhaps weeks, rather than many months”. The transitional </p>
<p>administration would last “rather longer”, as it would take time to agree political </p>
<p>structures to introduce reforms. </p>
<p><b>323. </b> The FCO stated that Iraq had “a relatively sophisticated public administration” and </p>
<p>expected that:</p>
<p>“… it will work adequately once the most senior old regime officials have been </p>
<p>removed. Iraq should not be like Kosovo, where ministries and public services had </p>
<p>to be created from scratch.”</p>
<p><b>324. </b> The FCO explained that the role of the UN was “still a matter of active debate” in </p>
<p>the US and between the US and UK. It concluded:</p>
<p>“We are in contact with a number of international players, including in particular </p>
<p>the US, about these sensitive matters. We are not making the content of these </p>
<p>contingency talks public. Nor should you.”</p>
<p><b>Maintaining pressure on the US</b></p>
<p><b>325.  The Chiefs of Staff were briefed on the three-phase US Phase IV Plan on </b></p>
<p><b>10 February. They were told:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>US planning was evolving slowly because of disputes in Washington about </b></p>
<p><b>the primacy of the different bodies involved.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Without a common approach to the underlying issues in the UK, it would </b></p>
<p><b>not be possible to exert influence on the US process. </b></p>
<p><b>326.  The Chiefs of Staff commented that there would be a significant requirement </b></p>
<p><b>for other countries to share the post-conflict burden. The FCO undertook to </b></p>
<p><b>explore the issue.</b></p>
<p><b>327. </b> Maj Gen Fry updated the Chiefs of Staff on US Phase IV planning on </p>
<p>10 February.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> The US had divided Phase IV into three stages: IVa – Stabilisation;  </p>
<p>IVb – Recovery; and IVc – Transition to Security. </p>

<p>367</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Maj Gen Fry invited the Chiefs to note that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US intended the immediate post-conflict stabilisation period to last between </p>
<p>three and six months: “By necessity and tactical imperative there is implicit UK </p>
<p>acceptance of this direction.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US thinking on the recovery phase, expected to last up to two years, was </p>
<p>evolving and could be shaped by the UK: “The UK has a comprehensive </p>
<p>network of embedded staff who need clear direction if they are to meet UK </p>
<p>intent.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not clear where the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) responsible for </p>
<p>security sector issues from the start of the recovery period would be found: </p>
<p>“A UK view on the potential role of HQ ARRC [Allied Rapid Reaction Corps] </p>
<p>is required.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Boundaries within Iraq would change with the transition from stabilisation to </p>
<p>recovery: “If the UK wish to retain Sector South East a clear message needs to </p>
<p>be sent to CFC [Coalition Forces Commander, Gen Franks].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US assumed continued UK two-star leadership and “prolonged </p>
<p>commitment” of a brigade. The duration of the UK’s commitment needed </p>
<p>clarification.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US needed to take critical decisions about UN involvement soon.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> Maj Gen Fry explained that US planning was evolving slowly because of </p>
<p>disagreement between DoD and the State Department over governance and the </p>
<p>primacy of CFLCC, JTF-4 and the “Iraq Office of Post-war Planning [ORHA]”. The UK </p>
<p>had a colonel and small team in CFLCC “with the lead on the stabilisation stage” and a </p>
<p>colonel with a small team in JTF-4 “with a focus on the recovery stage”. Maj Gen Cross </p>
<p>would deploy to ORHA with a small team shortly. To exert influence, there needed to be </p>
<p>a common UK approach to the issues, which was “currently lacking”. The IPU had been </p>
<p>tasked to take that work forward. </p>
<p><b>330. </b> Under existing US plans, once “post-hostility conditions” were achieved, CJTF </p>
<p>would take over from CFLCC as the military headquarters responsible for Phase IV, but </p>
<p>a decision was still needed on CJTF’s “parentage”. One option was to deploy the ARRC </p>
<p>to take over as CJTF Iraq, incorporating JTF-4. </p>
<p><b>331. </b> The paper described key tasks for the stabilisation phase, but offered no </p>
<p>assessment of troop numbers needed to perform them. </p>
<p><b>332. </b> The first detailed estimate of the type (but not the size) of force required to deliver </p>
<p>different tasks was in Lt Gen Reith’s draft Concept of Operations for Phase IV on </p>
<p>25 March. </p>

<p> They </p>
<p>observed that there would be a substantial requirement for other countries to share </p>
<p>the burden. The FCO undertook to explore the issue. </p>
<p><b>334. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, questioned whether the </p>
<p>potential role for the ARRC was for the UK AO or all of Iraq, and whether it was to </p>
<p>be used in its NATO or national role. </p>
<p><b>335. </b> The potential deployment of the ARRC is addressed in Section 6.2.</p>
<p><b>336.  MOD officials briefed Ms Short on the military campaign on 12 February.</b></p>
<p><b>337. </b> On 12 February, MOD officials explained to Ms Short the general shape of the </p>
<p>campaign, the policy on targeting and the approach to post-conflict operations.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>record stated she was: “reassured that MOD was ‘catching up with the reality’ … that </p>
<p>humanitarian operations need to be an integral part of … campaign planning”, but </p>
<p>“reiterated in the strongest possible terms” her belief that the practical benefits of a </p>
<p>second resolution were worth a delay until the autumn. Ms Short’s main interest was </p>
<p>mitigation of the impact of conflict on the Iraqi people, including in the event of CBW use. </p>
<p>Working with the military in any UK Area of Responsibility (AOR), she wanted the UK to </p>
<p>set “a benchmark standard for recovery and reconstruction”. </p>

<p>was “impressive on details”, but “riddled with holes at the political and strategic levels”.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the US divided on the merits of involving the UN, the key issue was the legal basis </p>
<p>for any continuing occupation of Iraq. The UK assessment was that a specific mandate </p>
<p>was needed. Without that the Coalition would “face both obligations and constraints </p>
<p>which will face us with a choice between illegality and ineffectiveness”. </p>
<p><b>341. </b> The briefing listed eight “Key Gaps/US-UK policy differences” on post-conflict </p>

<p>the long term? What level of compromise/co-operation with Iraqi officialdom will </p>

<p>included material on the importance of securing a UN mandate to legitimise international </p>
<p>rule, establishing a substantial UN role in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, engaging IFIs </p>
<p>to plan economic reconstruction, avoiding the perception of a UK/US “oil grab” and </p>
<p>securing “a level-playing field for UK business in oil and other areas”. </p>
<p><b>344. </b> The proposed message on dismantling the Iraqi regime was: </p>
<p>“Must detain senior leadership and leading members of Saddam’s security forces </p>
<p>and put them through proper legal process. But we will need Iraqi technocrats, who </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>370</p>
<p><b>346. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that on 12 February Mr Hoon raised </p>
<p>the issue of financing reconstruction from oil sales with Secretary Rumsfeld, who </p>
<p>agreed that oil proceeds were key and should not be misinterpreted as a reason for </p>
<p>the conflict.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> DoD would make it clear that oil proceeds should go to Iraq’s people. </p>
<p>OFF was a good basis on which to work. </p>
<p><b>347. </b> The Embassy also reported agreement during Mr Hoon’s talks with Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld and Dr Rice that “broad UN cover for day after management in Iraq would </p>
<p>bring political, financial and legal benefits. But this cover should not come with inefficient </p>
<p>micro-management by UN agencies.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> The Embassy commented that, although ORHA </p>
<p>remained “disputed turf” and Mr Hoon had heard conflicting accounts of its role while in </p>
<p>Washington, it would be the “key body in ruling and reconstructing a defeated Iraq”. The </p>
<p>UK was “slightly ahead of the game” in already having Maj Gen Cross there, but the US </p>
<p>would welcome more UK secondees.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> Neither the Embassy’s report of Mr Hoon’s meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld nor </p>
<p>the record written by Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, referred </p>
<p>to any discussion of de-Ba’athification.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>349. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that, at the meeting, he handed Secretary Rumsfeld </p>
<p>a paper which, while not using the word “de-Ba’athification”, had: </p>
<p>“… emphasised … that there would be people who had joined the Ba’ath Party … </p>
<p>not because they necessarily were enthusiastic supporters of Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>and we felt that there ought to be a distinction between those who were enthusiastic </p>
<p>supporters and those who simply joined the party in order to gain position … and </p>
<p>I think a similar argument arises in relation to the army”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>350. </b> The Inquiry has been unable to identify the paper handed over by Mr Hoon. </p>
<p><b>351. </b> During Mr Hoon’s meeting with Dr Rice she expressed concern that the existing </p>
<p>military campaign plan for the South of Iraq assumed local administrators would remain </p>
<p>in place. Her assessment was that those individuals, who were mainly Sunni in an </p>
<p>otherwise Shia area, would flee after the collapse of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>

<p><b>371. </b> In his advice to Mr Straw, Mr Chaplin had argued against avoiding all mention of </p>
<p>regime change: </p>
<p>“It seems to me unrealistic to expect that the Americans will sign up to a common </p>
<p>set of campaign objectives which does not include explicit mention of regime change </p>
<p>(put in the context of disarmament), especially once military action has begun. At </p>
<p>that point it would be very difficult to claim publicly that, although we were taking part </p>
<p>in military action, we did not intend or expect the regime to fall.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr O’Brien had proposed specific wording to Mr Straw that “should satisfy the </p>
<p>Americans but stop short of making regime change an explicit element of UK objectives” </p>
<p>by establishing more clearly that regime change was needed to secure long-term </p>
<p>disarmament:</p>
<p>“The UK’s overall objective for the military campaign is to create the conditions in </p>
<p>which Iraq disarms in accordance with its obligations under UNSCRs [UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions] and creates the circumstances in which Iraq remains disarmed </p>
<p>in the long-term.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Straw included that proposal in a letter to Mr Blair on 11 February, in which he </p>
<p>expressed “serious concerns” about the presentation of military campaign objectives:</p>
<p>“It is particularly important to explain carefully any reference to regime change. We </p>
<p>must underline that this is only necessary because Iraq has consistently refused </p>
<p>to comply with UN Security Council resolutions. Otherwise people here and in the </p>
<p>region will assume that we had been intent on regime change all along.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>375. </b> DFID had proposed the addition of references to:</p>

<p>the military campaign;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrating to the Iraqi people, rather than reassuring them, that their security </p>

<p> He explained that </p>
<p>the UK military campaign objectives were “compatible but not identical” to ‘Iraq: Goals, </p>
<p>Objectives, Strategy’ (the US document handed to Sir David by Dr Rice on 31 January). </p>
<p><b>385. </b> Sir David explained that the UK and US were committed to ridding Iraq of WMD </p>
<p>and recognised the need to remove the current Iraqi regime if military action proved </p>
<p>necessary, but the UK document avoided references to “liberation”. No firm decision had </p>
<p>been taken, but the likelihood was that the UK would publish its objectives if and when </p>
<p>military action was decided.</p>
<p><b>386. </b> A final version of the military campaign objectives, with changes to the introductory </p>

<p><b>388. </b> In a speech at the International Institute for Strategic Studies on 11 February, </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated that if military action did prove necessary, “huge efforts” would be </p>
<p>made “to ensure that the suffering of the Iraqi people” was “as limited as is possible”.</p>

<p>“<b>For how long do we want to run a geographical sector of Iraq?</b></p>
<p>“… it seems very likely that UK forces (under US command) will find themselves </p>

<p>…</p>
<p>“In practical terms, administration of a geographical sector will be very labour </p>

<p>“There is likely to be a hybrid model of both geographical sectors under different </p>

<p><b>399. </b> The No.10 briefing note for Mr Blair stated that the purpose of the meeting was </p>

<p>The UN must play a key role, both to reassure the NGOs and also for political </p>
<p>reasons, to avoid the impression of a US takeover of Iraq. He asked DFID, FCO </p>

<p>“The underlying theme of yesterday’s meeting was that all relevant government </p>
<p>departments need to contribute to what will be a major undertaking. The role of </p>
<p>pulling together the Whitehall line on this side of the Atlantic belongs naturally to </p>
<p>the FCO. Mr Hoon presumes that the FCO will now move quickly to pull together </p>
<p>the views of the relevant departments … Mr Hoon’s clear recollection is that all </p>
<p>three Secretaries of State concerned were asked to provide the Prime Minister with </p>
<p>co-ordinated advice on how the UK should structure its approach to post-conflict </p>
<p>planning and what level of contribution it should be prepared to make (not just the </p>
<p>narrow UN point …). I have spoken to No.10 and the Foreign Secretary’s Office </p>
<p>accordingly.</p>
<p>“Mr Hoon would be grateful if you would speak to your counterparts in the FCO and </p>
<p>DFID to ensure this work is being taken forward in the right lines.” </p>
<p><b>407. </b> In his statement of 14 January 2011, Mr Blair explained to the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… we broke down planning into three parts: humanitarian – the priority for DFID; </p>
<p>Military – with the MOD; and political with the FCO …</p>
<p>“Though the Iraq Planning Unit was formally established in February 2003, </p>
<p>some planning was already under way and co-ordinated by the ad hoc officials </p>
<p>group [AHGI] from October 2002 … but above all planning was under way within </p>
<p>departments … </p>
<p>“… [I]ndividual Secretaries of State were responsible for each separate stream. </p>
<p>The Cabinet was debating the issue and there was a constant process of exchange </p>
<p>at official level passed up to me and the Ministers. As we came to recognise … it </p>
<p>would have been better to have had more integrated planning at an earlier time; and </p>
<p>certainly there is a lesson there.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>408.  On 14 February, Ms Short advised Mr Blair of constraints on the UK’s ability </b></p>
<p><b>to perform an “exemplary” humanitarian role in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>409.  In response, Mr Blair restated the need to “get the US to accept the UN role”.</b></p>
<p><b>410. </b> Ms Short sent Mr Blair a letter on 14 February setting out “key humanitarian issues </p>
<p>and some thoughts on the UN’s role which we need to pursue with the US”.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> Ms Short </p>
<p>advised:</p>
<p>“The vulnerability of the Iraqi people to humanitarian catastrophe should not be </p>
<p>underestimated … Iraq should be an upper middle or high income country. Instead </p>
<p>its average earnings have plummeted in the last two decades, its population is </p>
<p>largely dependent on food handouts, its agricultural sector operating well below </p>
<p>capacity. Iraqi people’s lives are perilously fragile – their private coping strategies </p>
<p>worn away by years of misrule … The situation in the centre and south of Iraq is </p>
<p>much worse than in the north …”</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Ms Short also expanded on her comments on the UK’s ability to do an “exemplary” </p>
<p>job, made at Mr Blair’s meeting on 13 February. She told Mr Blair there was a “great </p>
<p>opportunity” for the UK to play “an exemplary humanitarian role” in a sector under </p>
<p>UK control, within an agreed international framework set out in a second resolution. </p>
<p>Such a resolution “should address the UN’s lead role after conflict and underline the </p>
<p>prioritisation of humanitarian considerations”. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> Ms Short also highlighted budgetary constraints. She could not:</p>
<p>“… take resources from other poor and needy people to assist post-conflict Iraq. </p>
<p>Without some understanding on finance, I cannot responsibly commit DFID to the </p>
<p>exemplary partnership with MOD which we discussed.”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> In her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Short focused on the resolution’s importance </p>
<p>to reconstruction, rather than humanitarian efforts:</p>
<p>“… we knew that if we didn’t get another UN resolution, we were in big trouble. We </p>
<p>could do humanitarian, but you can’t reconstruct the country, and that became an </p>
<p>absolute obsession of Whitehall.”</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Blair wrote on his copy of the letter: “We must get the US to accept the </p>
<p>UN role.”</p>

<p>Iraqis already dependent on international aid through OFF.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Ms Fréchette explained that the UN agencies had developed an integrated </p>
<p>humanitarian plan for Iraq, working with the six neighbouring countries, the ICRC and </p>
<p>NGOs. US$30.6m had already been pledged and the UN was preparing a request </p>
<p>for a further US$88.8m. Much more would be needed in the event of a “medium-case </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Mr Annan’s concerns were understandable, but “the US was doing a huge amount on </p>
<p>this, and the UK was contributing and planning also. DFID were active, and keen on UN </p>
<p>cover for an operation.” Mr Annan stated that all the humanitarian agencies also wanted </p>
<p>UN cover, including for the reconstruction effort. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>There were very clear indications the UN did not want the administration of Iraq to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>The absence of a “winning concept”</b></p>
<p><b>423.  In mid-February, officials expressed concern about two significant risks:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the potential “nightmare scenario” of no second resolution and, at best, </b></p>
<p><b>only a weak legal basis for military action; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the continuing absence of a coherent plan for the administration of Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>424.  Over the previous year, Ministers, the military and officials had identified </b></p>
<p><b>effective preparation for the post-conflict phase as a requirement for strategic </b></p>
<p><b>success. </b></p>
<p><b>425.  Mr Hoon had reminded Mr Blair as recently as 16 January that a satisfactory </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict plan was needed before a decision was taken to deploy UK forces </b></p>
<p><b>(see Section 6.4). </b></p>
<p><b>426.  As the extent of US opposition to a UN lead on civil administration became </b></p>
<p><b>clearer and the likely start date for military action approached, the Government </b></p>
<p><b>needed to reassess policy and prepare for the possibility that the US could not </b></p>
<p><b>be persuaded of the UK view. </b></p>
<p><b>427.  No reassessment of UK policy took place. </b></p>
<p><b>428. </b> Section 3.7 describes Mr Chaplin’s analysis of the prospects for a Ministerial-level </p>
<p>meeting of the Security Council on 14 February. On 13 February, he advised Mr Ricketts </p>
<p>that it was: </p>
<p>“… probably the last opportunity to reflect on whether we can extract … a better </p>
<p>outcome … than at present looks likely.</p>
<p>“… No SCR and a feeble, at best, legal basis for military action is a nightmare </p>
<p>scenario … A quick collapse of the Iraqi regime (quite likely); subsequent clear </p>
<p>proof, because we find the stuff, that we were right all along about the Iraqi WMD </p>
<p>threat (*questionable – what convinces the experts may not convince public opinion </p>
<p>unless it is pretty spectacular); and a smooth transfer to a democratic and stable </p>
<p>government (improbable, especially without UN cover) would reduce the damage. </p>
<p>But this is a high risk route.”</p>
<p>197</p>
<p><b>429.  On 14 February, officials advised No.10 of the critical importance of a </b></p>
<p><b>satisfactory post-conflict plan as part of an overall “winning concept” for Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>430.  A Cabinet Office paper on “winning the peace” gave a clear description of </b></p>
<p><b>the potential scale of the post-conflict task and the long list of issues still to be </b></p>
<p><b>resolved with the US. </b></p>

<p><b>431.  The paper warned that there was “no coherent plan of how Iraq will be </b></p>
<p><b>governed beyond the first 3 to 6 months”.</b></p>
<p><b>432. </b> On 14 February, in response to a request for a note on key messages for use with </p>
<p>the US, Mr Drummond sent Sir David Manning a paper on “winning the peace”, cleared </p>
<p>with the IPU.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>433. </b> Mr Drummond stated: “A satisfactory plan for post-conflict is critical to whether we </p>
<p>have a ‘winning concept’.” </p>
<p><b>434. </b> “Victorious Coalition forces” could expect to find an Iraq with certain “broad </p>
<p>characteristics”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the remains of a command state with “some sound technical institutions, which </p>
<p>should recover with Saddam’s influence removed”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “brutal security apparatus with the layers closest to Saddam requiring </p>
<p>disbandment and the rest substantial reform”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “dysfunctional judicial system”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>large numbers of displaced people;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the majority of the population hungry should the OFF programme collapse;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>health, education and other public services that had declined rapidly over the </p>
<p>last 20 years;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to key infrastructure, “perhaps less than other conflicts if the campaign </p>
<p>is quick”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an oil-dependent country with potential and the skills available to recover quickly </p>
<p>if well managed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a secular Islamic state “with potential for much greater fundamentalism”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tribal, sectarian and, especially, ethnic divisions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>neighbouring states “keen to press their interests” and a region “deeply nervous, </p>
<p>if not hostile, to a continuing US military presence in Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>435. </b> It was expected that any Iraqi welcome for the removal of Saddam Hussein would </p>
<p>be short lived:</p>
<p>“… liberation will quickly become occupation … So the Coalition must have a </p>
<p>clear public plan for restoring Iraqi representative government, for the use of oil </p>
<p>revenues for the benefit of all Iraqis, and the means to bring early benefits of change </p>
<p>to the Iraqi people. This will also help with the region and those members of the </p>
<p>international community who did not support military action.</p>
<p>“We must not underestimate the task. In recent years, we have had to remove </p>
<p>governments in Kosovo and East Timor and replace them with international </p>

<p>administrations, but they are much smaller both in size (Wales not France) and </p>
<p>population (2.5m in Kosovo, 25m in Iraq). In Afghanistan we have worked with </p>
<p>a local political process and administration. In Iraq we face having to replace a </p>
<p>government and remove a political party which has dominated Iraqi politics and </p>
<p>institutions for over 40 years. So some similarities to post-war Germany.”</p>
<p><b>436. </b> On post-conflict planning, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“The US has assumed for planning purposes that it will lead the government of Iraq </p>
<p>following military victory. It has consulted extensively with the Iraqi exile population, </p>
<p>many of whom are well informed about the situation in Iraq, but have their own </p>
<p>agenda. There has been extensive CENTCOM and DoD planning for the military </p>
<p>campaign and the first 60 to 90 days. PJHQ are plugged into this well, and have </p>
<p>helped to shape some aspects of it. There is also good progress in planning to follow </p>
<p>up the military advance with immediate humanitarian support for the Iraqi population. </p>
<p>But there is no serious US assessment of the consequence of CBW use on the </p>
<p>civilian population.</p>
<p>“PJHQ started their own detailed planning exercise as soon as it became clear </p>
<p>that UK forces might have control over the Basra area of southern Iraq (city </p>
<p>population 1.5m alone) from the very early stages of the campaign … Whitehall </p>
<p>inter-departmental teams have visited [the US] several times since last autumn to </p>
<p>discuss the issues. Some decisions cannot of course be made until the Coalition </p>
<p>can assess the situation post-conflict. But there is no coherent plan of how Iraq will </p>
<p>be governed beyond the first 3 to 6 months. This risks the continuation of a military </p>
<p>government becoming increasingly unpopular. This would be even more likely if the </p>
<p>US proceeded with a plan of dividing Iraq into three sectors for military government.</p>
<p>“The US envisages that there will be three phases post-conflict:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A military government led by a US general for the first 3 to 6 months to  </p>
<p>re-establish security and deal with the humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Then a civilian-led international government charged with rebuilding democracy </p>
<p>from the bottom up, restoring key services and increasing oil production. The </p>
<p>US hope this would last 12 to 18 months but accept it might take longer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Handover to an Iraqi representative government at which point Coalition forces </p>
<p>would withdraw. </p>
<p>“Our key concerns are to manage the task, by ensuring that we have legal cover, as </p>
<p>much support as possible within Iraq and internationally, and as much help in both </p>
<p>money and skills from the international community.” </p>
<p><b>437. </b> The paper stated that decisions needed to be reached with the US on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Legitimacy. The US had been told that the UK required the UN to legitimise the </p>
<p>post-conflict government of Iraq and to resolve legal problems around sanctions </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.5  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, January to March 2003</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>and OFF. “This would require a further resolution. It should be achievable if the </p>
<p>Security Council is satisfied with the extent of UN involvement in the transition … </p>
<p>Even Rumsfeld is beginning to accept the need for it. On current plans it would </p>
<p>not be presented until the end of the conflict.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN administration. This would make sense for “international acceptability and for </p>
<p>the skills, which the UN could bring … But the US is set against, because they </p>
<p>believe the UN has performed poorly elsewhere. We are therefore proposing </p>
<p>that the UN’s expertise should be used in technical areas such as education and </p>
<p>health. A UN Special Representative … will be required to pull the UN machinery </p>
<p>together locally … We have given the US proposals for UN involvement. </p>
<p>Mr Hoon pursued with Rumsfeld, and you will want to follow up with Condi Rice.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The political process. “We need urgently to pin down a process so that it can be </p>
<p>announced as soon as a decision is taken to remove Saddam by force … Again </p>
<p>we have given the US outline proposals, but should firm them up.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humanitarian issues. “Although the US has good plans to bring in humanitarian </p>
<p>relief behind the military it has not thought through how to encourage NGOs and </p>
<p>UN specialised agencies to engage. The international community also needs a </p>
<p>contingency financing plan …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The economy. A joint working group with the US was working on a plan for </p>
<p>transparent management of Iraq’s oil revenues, which needed “a political push in </p>
<p>the US”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction contracts. The US needed to be encouraged to create “a level </p>
<p>playing field”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security. The Pentagon wanted to withdraw units from Iraq as quickly as </p>
<p>possible. “We must prevent the UK bearing a disproportionate share of the </p>
<p>security burden at a time when military overstretch is causing problems with </p>
<p>meeting our other priorities. If we are not to replicate the problems seen in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, we will also need the US to agree early on to [a] single holistic plan </p>
<p>for Security Sector Reform. We have offered outline proposals for the security </p>
<p>sector. We should offer a plan.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Justice. The US had asked the UK to lead on the revival of the Iraqi justice </p>
<p>system. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sectorisation. The UK needed “urgently to understand the recent US suggestion </p>
<p>that Iraq be divided into three geographical sectors and that we should run one </p>
<p>of them (a much bigger area than the Basra Area of Operations) with enormous </p>
<p>personnel and financial implications”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The timeframe. “US plans are very ambitious. The reforms planned are </p>
<p>unlikely to be achieved within a two year period. We are likely to need longer </p>
<p>engagement in Iraq if we are to leave a durable legacy, but we should deliver the </p>
<p>latter stages under an Iraqi administration. The US will need to be persuaded of </p>
<p>this fact.” </p>

<p><b>444.  On 14 February, Secretary Rumsfeld identified lessons for Iraq from the </b></p>
<p><b>experience of nation-building in Afghanistan. The goal in Iraq was not to impose </b></p>
<p><b>a</b> <b>US template, but to create conditions for Iraqis to form their own government.</b></p>
<p><b>445.  Secretary Rumsfeld stated that a US-led Coalition in Iraq would stay as long </b></p>
<p><b>as necessary and leave as soon as possible.</b></p>
<p><b>446. </b> In a speech in New York on 14 February, Secretary Rumsfeld drew lessons for Iraq </p>
<p>from the US experience of nation-building in Afghanistan: </p>
<p>“Afghanistan belongs to the Afghans. The objective is not to engage in what some </p>
<p>call nation-building. Rather it is to help the Afghans so they can build their own </p>
<p>nation. This is an important distinction. In some nation-building exercises well-</p>
<p>intentioned foreigners … can create a dependency.”</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld stated that a US-led Coalition in Iraq would be guided by two </p>
<p>commitments, to “[s]tay as long as necessary and to leave as soon as possible”:</p>
<p>“We would work with our partners as we are doing in Afghanistan to help the Iraqi </p>
<p>people establish a new government …</p>
<p>“The goal would not be to impose an American-style template on Iraq, but rather to </p>
<p>create conditions where Iraqis can form a government in their own unique way, just </p>
<p>as the Afghans did with the Loya Jirga which produced a representative government </p>
<p>that is uniquely Afghan.</p>

<p>“This is not to underestimate the challenge that the Coalition would face. Iraq has </p>
<p>several advantages over Afghanistan. One is time. The effort in Afghanistan had </p>
<p>to be planned and executed in a matter of weeks after September 11th. With Iraq, </p>
<p>by contrast, there has been time to prepare. We have set up a Post War Planning </p>
<p>Office to think through problems and co-ordinate the efforts of Coalition countries </p>

<p>“A country that in 1978, the year before he [Saddam Hussein] seized power, was </p>
<p>richer than Malaysia or Portugal. A country where today, 135 out of every 1,000 Iraqi </p>
<p>children die before the age of five</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> – 70 percent of these deaths are from diarrhoea </p>
<p>and respiratory infections that are easily preventable. Where almost a third of </p>
<p>children born in the centre and south of Iraq have chronic malnutrition.</p>
<p>“Where 60 percent of the people depend on food aid.</p>
<p>“Where half the population of rural areas have no safe water.</p>
<p>“Where every year and now, as we speak, tens of thousands of political prisoners </p>
<p>languish in appalling conditions in Saddam’s jails and are routinely executed.</p>
<p>“Where in the past 15 years over 150,000 Shia Muslims in southern Iraq and Muslim </p>
<p>Kurds in northern Iraq have been butchered, with up to four million Iraqis in exile </p>
<p>round the world, including 350,000 now in Britain.”</p>

<p>Iraqi people. This cannot be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>“Remember Kosovo where we were told war would destabilise the whole of the </p>
<p>Balkans and that region now has the best chance of peace in over 100 years.</p>

<p><b>should deploy its limited resources and what balance to strike between planning </b></p>
<p><b>for an “exemplary role” in southern Iraq and supporting the UN and the wider </b></p>
<p><b>international effort throughout the country. </b></p>
<p><b>457.  Officials recommended certain actions to ensure that DFID was adequately </b></p>
<p><b>prepared for a range of roles.</b></p>
<p><b>458.  Ms Short rejected a number of her officials’ recommendations on the </b></p>
<p><b>grounds that they might imply that military action was a certainty or presupposed </b></p>
<p><b>a significant role for DFID to which it could not yet commit.</b></p>
<p><b>459.  Ms Short did so despite accepting that, as a consequence, DFID would </b></p>
<p><b>not be prepared for an immediate response in the event of military action </b></p>
<p><b>or</b> <b>a</b> <b>humanitarian crisis on the ground.</b></p>
<p><b>460.  Ms Short withdrew her objections by early March.</b></p>
<p><b>461. </b> On 17 February, DFID officials advised Ms Short on the implications of the </p>
<p>decisions taken at Mr Blair’s meeting on 13 February.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> DFID needed to balance the </p>
<p>decision that the UK should take the lead on humanitarian issues in southern Iraq with </p>
<p>its commitment to support the international system, in particular the UN, in humanitarian </p>
<p>work across Iraq and the region. DFID needed to prioritise its “scarce human and </p>
<p>financial resources” between those activities. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> DFID officials had discussed the idea of an “exemplary role” briefly with senior </p>
<p>UK military officers and the MOD, who were ready to contribute “in circumstances </p>
<p>where the military may be the only people able to deliver humanitarian assistance, or </p>
<p>they are needed to facilitate access by others”. The Chiefs of Staff would discuss the </p>
<p>humanitarian role of the UK military on 19 February. Officials recommended to Ms Short </p>
<p>that, at that meeting, DFID would need to give a clearer steer on the role it expected to </p>
<p>play and what it thought the military should do. </p>

<p>‘Iraq – Contingency Planning: Deployment Plan’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Officials recommended that:</p>
<p>“… we plan at this stage to do all four of these activities:</p>
<p>a) </p>
<p>Support humanitarian needs nationally and in the region, primarily through </p>
<p>the UN and Red Cross/Red Crescent movement</p>
<p>b) </p>
<p>Work alongside and influence humanitarian action by US DART teams</p>
<p>c) </p>
<p>Work alongside the UK military</p>
<p>d) </p>
<p>Undertake DFID bilateral humanitarian action.</p>
<p>“These activities are complementary and doing them all could maximise our impact </p>
<p>– working in an exemplary way in a part of the country under UK military control </p>
<p>(though activities b), c) and d) will have greater influence if we are co-operating </p>
<p>closely with the UN and US delivery of assistance elsewhere in the country (through </p>
<p>activities a) and b)).”</p>
<p><b>464. </b> Officials also recommended a number of “pre-deployment steps which we need </p>
<p>to initiate now to be adequately prepared to play these roles effectively”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establishing a forward base in Kuwait to allow DFID to build its capacity for </p>
<p>deployment into Iraq, potentially including a field presence in a UK military AOR </p>
<p>and/or Baghdad;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployment of a Humanitarian Adviser to Amman to liaise and work with </p>
<p>humanitarian partners;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regional assessment missions, including to Cyprus, Egypt, Turkey and Iran;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployment of a Civil-Military Humanitarian Adviser to 1 (UK) Div in Kuwait and </p>
<p>regular visits to CENTCOM in Qatar; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>secondments to support humanitarian co-ordination, initially to the UN </p>
<p>Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC) in Cyprus.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Officials warned Ms Short:</p>
<p>“If we do not have people and assets in place and ready in time, we will not be </p>
<p>able to respond quickly and as may be needed. Once conflict has begun logistical </p>
<p>constraints will make it extremely difficult to respond unless we have put the </p>
<p>preparations in place.”</p>
<p><b>466. </b> Officials advised that the US was planning to carry out humanitarian work across </p>
<p>Iraq, including in the South. If the UK did not agree with that approach, it would need </p>
<p>to convince the US at “very senior level” that it should change its plans and that the UK </p>
<p>was adequately resourced to play an exemplary role, which was not currently the case. </p>
<p>It might be more realistic to supplement and influence US efforts in a UK sector. Officials </p>
<p>recommended working alongside the US DART field office in Kuwait, “to protect and </p>
<p>supplement the proposed exemplary role for UK humanitarian action”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.5  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, January to March 2003</p>
<p>391</p>
<p><b>467. </b> On working alongside the UK military, the advice stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The military was considering how to revise plans to allocate resources to a </p>
<p>potentially significant humanitarian role, but that, given the military’s resource </p>
<p>constraints, it could be “highly advantageous” if Coalition military units could </p>
<p>supplement the UK effort with medical teams and NBC units, where it was </p>
<p>weakest.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID needed to retain flexibility to deal with the possibility that, initially, the UN </p>
<p>and other humanitarian organisations might not be able to operate in Iraq. In </p>
<p>those circumstances, “we would need to rely on military forces supported by </p>
<p>embedded DFID civil/military humanitarian advisers and/or a DFID operational </p>
<p>team”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Significant planning and preparation had been carried out, but some sectors </p>
<p>were poorly covered, including “fuel supply (supporting electricity generation and </p>
<p>distribution systems), water and sanitation and the power sectors”. The security </p>
<p>environment and the ability of humanitarian agencies to engage was a “principal </p>
<p>concern”. Past experience showed that “direct DFID/UK military humanitarian </p>
<p>action can save lives [and] alleviate suffering, and assists the process towards </p>
<p>recovery and stabilisation”.</p>
<p><b>468. </b> On DFID-led interventions, officials advised that the military might provide security </p>
<p>and logistics to support DFID “assessments” and:</p>
<p>“… depending on priority needs potentially including the maintenance and </p>
<p>management of key infrastructure including water and sanitation, transport </p>
<p>infrastructure and electricity generation and transmission infrastructure in an AOR. </p>
<p>Under these circumstances DFID would assist with technical programme support </p>
<p>directly or via specialist contractors retained internationally. However, it has to be </p>
<p>noted that our human resource capacity is limited (CHAD-OT [Operations Team] </p>
<p>can provide around 25 specialists, including recruiting additional experts) and the </p>
<p>scale of need could be immense and we may face … the threat of CBW. Therefore </p>
<p>we should concentrate on those tasks where our experience and expertise would </p>
<p>add most value. Working alongside Coalition military where necessary and with US </p>
<p>DART capacity where it would enhance humanitarian response.”</p>
<p><b>469. </b> The advice concluded with a section on resource constraints. Until DFID received </p>
<p>an indication from the Treasury or No.10 that further funds would be forthcoming, it was </p>
<p>planning on the basis that “a substantial share of DFID’s Contingency Reserve” would </p>
<p>supplement CHAD’s emergency funds and MENAD’s Iraq programme budget. If a total </p>
<p>of £60m were available from those sources in 2003/04, DFID would plan initially to </p>
<p>commit £35m for immediate relief. Exactly how to allocate that amount would depend </p>
<p>on the nature of the conflict and other factors, but an indicative allocation might be: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£20m to support the work of UN agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs across </p>
<p>Iraq;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£5m to fund UK military Quick Impact Projects (QIPs) to help generate stability </p>
<p>within communities; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£10m for DFID’s own rapid response capacity. </p>
<p><b>470. </b> The advice stated: </p>
<p>“Under many scenarios, £35m is unlikely to be perceived as an adequate UK </p>
<p>contribution to any immediate relief effort, particularly if OFF collapses. Leaving </p>
<p>£25m for further humanitarian need, medium-term rehabilitation and reconstruction </p>
<p>could also look very sparse. Action in response to the Secretary of State’s previous </p>
<p>two letters [Ms Short’s letters of 5 and 14 February] to the Prime Minister on this </p>
<p>rests with No.10.</p>
<p>“If the military is involved in the direct delivery of humanitarian assistance, there will </p>
<p>be an issue about who pays. MOD claim to be financially stretched and are keen for </p>
<p>DFID to pay …”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Ms Short held a meeting to discuss those recommendations on 18 February, </p>
<p>attended by Dr Brewer, Ms Miller, Mr Fernie and other DFID officials.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> Mr Chakrabarti </p>
<p>was not present, but was sent a copy of the record.</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Ms Short stated that she was unwilling, without a clear financial package, to plan </p>
<p>to do more than “support the UN, key international agencies, and perhaps provide some </p>
<p>financial assistance to the UK military for Quick Impact Projects”. She had repeatedly </p>
<p>made it clear in various forums (to Mr Blair in person and in writing, and in the House </p>
<p>of Commons) that DFID did not have the financial resources to play a major role. </p>
<p><b>473. </b> Within those constraints, Ms Short was content for officials:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to start discussions about possible support to NGOs not yet involved in Iraq that </p>
<p>had specific technical expertise in areas such as water and sanitation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to work closely with the US on a humanitarian response, but only if there was an </p>
<p>overarching UN mandate and financial cover; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“in principle”, to make money available to the UK military for QIPs, to be </p>
<p>re-examined if there was no UN mandate and the UK military was “working </p>
<p>under a US lead”.</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Ms Short did not agree to a forward base in Kuwait on the grounds that it would </p>
<p>imply that military action was a certainty. DFID could make scoping visits to the region </p>
<p>and arrange for vehicles to be ready for transportation, but the equipment should not </p>
<p>be pre-positioned in the region. Ms Short “accepted that this would mean that DFID </p>
<p>would not be prepared for an immediate response in the event of military action or a </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis on the ground”. She suggested that DFID consider providing more </p>

<p>393</p>
<p>funds to the ICRC, which was undertaking similar preparations to those recommended </p>
<p>by DFID officials. </p>
<p><b>475. </b> Ms Short also rejected the proposed deployments to Amman and the HIC in </p>
<p>Cyprus, on the grounds that it pre-supposed a significant role for DFID, which it was </p>
<p>as yet unable to promise.</p>
<p><b>476. </b> The meeting considered DFID’s response to three possible scenarios:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>US/UK bilateral action; no second Security Council resolution (SCR); US military </p>
<p>governor without UN mandate:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>DFID would work through whichever international agencies were willing </p>
<p>to engage: the UN, Red Cross, and others.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Second SCR but overall US lead:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>DFID would provide funding to UK military for QIPs; and work through the </p>
<p>UN, Red Cross and others. </p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>Second SCR with UN mandate: </p>
<p>– </p>
<p>DFID would wish to be positively engaged – exactly how would depend </p>
<p>on financial package available.”</p>
<p>DFID would need to consider each scenario, and variations on them, in the light of the </p>
<p>amount of finance made available.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Ms Short also asked officials to reconsider wording used in draft replies to </p>
<p>Parliamentary Questions that suggested DFID had “well-established systems for </p>
<p>responding to humanitarian crises”. Iraq was a very different case.</p>
<p><b>478. </b> Dr Brewer briefed the Chiefs of Staff on DFID’s approach to humanitarian planning </p>
<p>on 19 February.</p>
<p><b>479.  Ms Short’s meeting was a key exchange that defined DFID’s approach to the </b></p>
<p><b>immediate pre-conflict period:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>DFID would prioritise “humanitarian considerations” over wider </b></p>
<p><b>reconstruction.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>In the absence of further resources for humanitarian assistance and to </b></p>
<p><b>avoid suggesting that military action was a certainty, DFID:</b></p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p><b>would prioritise support for the UN and the wider international effort </b></p>
<p><b>throughout Iraq and the region;</b></p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p><b>would not prepare for contingencies that exceeded its current </b></p>
<p><b>resources; and</b></p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p><b>would not deploy its full humanitarian response capability to support </b></p>

<p>394</p>
<p><b>480.  Although Mr Chakrabarti did not attend the meeting on 18 February, by then </b></p>
<p><b>he should have been aware:</b></p>

<p><b>or in the weeks remaining before the invasion.</b></p>
<p><b>“Sectorisation”</b></p>
<p><b>483.  During February, UK officials became increasingly concerned about the risk </b></p>
<p><b>that the UK might agree to take responsibility for a geographical sector of Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>before the implications of doing so had been examined. </b></p>
<p><b>484.  A draft IPU paper on “sectorisation”, not yet agreed with the MOD, </b></p>
<p><b>recommended that the UK should make clear to the US that it was unwilling to </b></p>
<p><b>take responsibility for a sector for more than 60 days unless its presence was </b></p>
<p><b>authorised by the UN and there was to be an early move to a UN transitional </b></p>
<p><b>administration. </b></p>
<p><b>485.  IPU guidance for UK officials attending the US inter-agency Rock Drill on </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict issues on 21and 22 February stated that, in the very short term, the </b></p>
<p><b>UK would have to administer a small area, most likely around Basra, where its </b></p>
<p><b>troops were present at the end of hostilities.</b></p>
<p><b>486.  The UK would not make a commitment to administer a division-sized area </b></p>
<p><b>in</b> <b>the medium to long term.</b></p>
<p><b>487. </b> On 14 February, Mr Ehrman reported to Mr Ricketts that at a “[Sir David] Manning </p>
<p>meeting” on post-conflict issues, Sir David had “expressed strong concern that junior </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.5  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, January to March 2003</p>
<p>395</p>
<p>CENTCOM planners seemed to be dreaming up an ever larger area of Iraq for the UK </p>
<p>to administer”.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> The Chiefs of Staff had advised Mr Blair that it would be easier for </p>
<p>the UK to play a smaller post-conflict role if it was part of a Coalition fighting force; the </p>
<p>opposite now seemed to be the case. Sir David had said that:</p>
<p>“[Mr Richard] Armitage [US Deputy Secretary of State] was talking of military </p>
<p>administration for two years. The Pentagon seemed to be more sensible, talking </p>
<p>of six months. Did we [the UK] not need to reduce our 40,000 troops to around </p>
<p>5,000 by the end of six months? And who would pay for all this? Some on the US </p>
<p>side seemed to be saying: you pay for what you administer.”</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Ehrman had suggested to Sir David that if the UK were to take on a sector </p>
<p>it should be getting as many like-minded allies as possible to join it:</p>
<p>“We should use the Anglo-Italian and Anglo-Spanish summits for this. Simon </p>
<p>Webb wondered whether Spain and Italy would be able to contribute. They were </p>
<p>almost fully committed in Kosovo, and we were trying to line up Spain as the next </p>
<p>ISAF [International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan] lead. David Manning </p>
<p>however favoured using the summits for the purpose I suggested. He also said we </p>
<p>should look to involve Arab countries: Egypt, Jordan, UAE, and maybe also Malaysia </p>
<p>and Pakistan.”</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Mr Ehrman informed Mr Ricketts that Sir David Manning had asked the MOD:</p>
<p>“… to get the best information they could, at a senior level, on what size of sector </p>
<p>was really being proposed for the UK; and FCO, with MOD, then to let No.10 have </p>
<p>views on the issues which would be involved in its administration, and how we would </p>
<p>seek to deal with these”.</p>
<p><b>490. </b> Mr Ehrman said that the FCO would be setting up a meeting with the MOD at </p>

<p>UN interim administration, we should be prepared to be ‘lead nation’ for a sector. </p>
<p>It would be useful to discuss what this might mean in practice. A lead on security </p>
<p>and willingness to take a lead role in UN discussions?”</p>
<p><b>493. </b> The IPU explained that there was “a slight difference” between MOD and FCO </p>
<p>advice being prepared for No.10. The FCO proposed that the UK should take the lead </p>
<p>on security in a sector “only if there is a UN interim administration”. The MOD “appear </p>
<p>willing to contemplate taking on a rather greater burden in a sector so long as there </p>
<p>is a UN-authorised Coalition/US administration”. </p>
<p><b>494. </b> The two positions were reconciled in the joint briefing on post-conflict UN </p>
<p>involvement prepared by the IPU for Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush </p>
<p>on 19 February. </p>
<p><b>495. </b> In the paper on sectorisation, prepared with input from UND and FCO Legal </p>
<p>Advisers, the IPU assumed that under any military plan UK forces would secure </p>
<p>a “UK sector” in southern Iraq. Four questions then arose:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>how long should UK forces remain?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should other UK civilians/administrators be in Iraq?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what should be their task?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>which area should they be in?”</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Options ranged:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>from occupying as small an area as possible (initial plans were for around </p>
<p>1,600 sq km</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> around Basra and Umm Qasr) for as short a time as possible </p>
<p>(until we can hand over to someone else, or simply withdraw without leaving a </p>
<p>bloodbath)</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to occupying a large area of south-eastern Iraq and administering it as an </p>
<p>occupying power for perhaps 2-3 years, until an Iraqi administration takes over.”</p>
<p><b>497. </b> The paper listed four constraints on the UK approach to sectorisation:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>growing debate about the legality of occupation the longer Coalition Forces </p>
<p>remained in Iraq without a UN mandate;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK and US interpretations of their responsibilities under international law might </p>
<p>differ;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reduction in UK force numbers “must begin by July/August, to achieve reduction </p>
<p>to medium scale by October/November”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>financing: military costs alone would be £2.5bn. The paper asked: “MOD: is this </p>
<p>known to Treasury?” </p>
<p>211 </p>
<p>The figure of 1,600 sq km was used repeatedly in policy and briefing papers during January and </p>
<p>February 2003. This was mistaken. It should have been approximately 16,000 sq km.</p>

<p><b>498. </b> The IPU listed pros and cons of sectorisation:</p>
<p>“Pros</p>
<p>International Profile (though this could be negative).</p>
<p>Ability to make a real difference: exemplary administration of a sector, setting the </p>
<p>standard for others operating elsewhere. </p>
<p>Control: less dependent on others (US in particular). </p>
<p>Cons </p>
<p>Exposure: the former colonial power again administering Iraq. Possible resentment, </p>
<p>even resistance. Much would depend on the international environment. </p>
<p>Expense. Long-term commitment / military overstretch / drain on other human </p>
<p>resources (NHS staff, armed policemen). </p>
<p>We want a united (albeit federal) Iraq. Lengthy occupation of sectors by [a] different </p>
<p>power would mean different systems of administration, and make a united Iraq more </p>
<p>difficult to achieve. (? Bosnia)”</p>
<p><b>499. </b> The IPU offered a tentative conclusion, in which it square bracketed all references </p>
<p>to the possible duration of the UK’s responsibility for a sector. The IPU stated that “in </p>
<p>any foreseeable circumstances, the UK has the capacity to secure and occupy for [six] </p>
<p>months” the 1,600 sq km initially envisaged, “though we think it is in fact rather larger </p>
<p>than that”, and to “take on a wide range of tasks”. The larger the sector, the shorter the </p>
<p>time the UK could administer it for. On that basis, the IPU recommended:</p>
<p>“We need to make clear to the US that <b>we are unwilling to take responsibility for </b></p>
<p><b>a sector for more than [60 days] unless our presence is clearly and expressly </b></p>
<p><b>authorised by the UN, and there is to be an early move to a UN transitional </b></p>
<p><b>administration</b>. So we can operate as ‘lead nation’ (ensuring security) within a </p>
<p>UN transitional administration, but are not willing to take on a medium-term (two </p>
<p>year) administration on our own, under a US occupation of Iraq which lacks UN </p>
<p>authorisation. We should tell the US that, were we to find ourselves in that position, </p>
<p>we would want to hand over to them [at the end of 60 days]. And they would find it </p>
<p>extremely difficult to find anyone to share the burden.” </p>
<p><b>500. </b> The record of Mr Ricketts’ Iraq Evening Meeting on 18 February stated that “a </p>
<p>possible UK sector” had been one of the subjects discussed at post-conflict talks with </p>

<p><b>501. </b> The IPU paper’s broad assumption in favour of administration of a small sector </p>

<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>502. </b> The guidance, agreed by Mr Ehrman and Lt Gen Pigott, was submitted to Ministers </p>
<p>on 20 February.</p>

<p><b>503.  In the second half of February, Treasury officials expressed concern about </b></p>
<p><b>the resource implications of the UK taking on responsibility for a geographical </b></p>
<p><b>sector of Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>504.  They advised that the “emerging politics” of post-conflict Iraq pointed </b></p>
<p><b>to a much longer and larger commitment than initial MOD estimates suggested.</b></p>
<p><b>505.  Papers by No.10 and the Treasury on the financing of post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>reconstruction also emphasised the risk of a significantly higher cost to the UK </b></p>
<p><b>in the absence of a UN mandate. </b></p>
<p><b>506. </b> On 19 February, Treasury officials updated Mr Brown on post-conflict issues for </p>
<p>meetings with Mr John Snow, the US Secretary of the Treasury, and other G7 Finance </p>
<p>Ministers:</p>
<p>“Iraqi reconstruction may come up at this meeting. Even if Mr Snow does not raise it, </p>
<p>you may wish to. Our sense is that momentum on the issue is developing very fast, </p>
<p>and there is a risk that the financing agenda could be set by policy decisions taken </p>
<p>in Foreign and Defence Ministries. Sharing ideas with Mr Snow may be a useful way </p>
<p>to begin to redress this balance. An additional approach would be to write round </p>
<p>Whitehall colleagues sharing your concerns (for instance, about the economic and </p>
<p>financing implications of foreign and defence policy decisions).”</p>

<p>The implications of establishing administrative sectors in Iraq: “If the UK takes </p>
<p>on one, the cost – in terms of money and administrative burden – could rocket, </p>
<p>and our stay lengthen.” </p>
<p><b>508. </b> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“… we should learn and apply some generic post-conflict lessons including: ensuring </p>
<p>UN involvement does not stretch to running economic policy or co-ordinating </p>
<p>reconstruction; not committing resources until a needs assessment has been done; </p>
<p>and trying to prevent foreign ministries taking financing decisions (even by default).</p>
<p>“The momentum of this issue makes it difficult for us to influence decisions, as does </p>
<p>the concentration of decision-making in the US White House/NSC and Department </p>
<p>of Defense. But the UK is feeding into this at official level via a new Iraq Planning </p>
<p>Unit – we are leading an economic sub-group within this.”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr John Dodds, Head of the Treasury Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, </p>
<p>sent comments to Mr Brown the same day, focusing on sectorisation: </p>
<p>“… a key decision that will need to be taken very soon is whether … the country </p>
<p>should be split into sectors for administrative and peacekeeping purposes and </p>
<p>whether the UK should take responsibility for one of the sectors.</p>
<p>“This is a decision that will have substantial public expenditure implications. If </p>
<p>there were a UK sector we would find ourselves locked into the management of </p>
<p>the aftermath for a substantial period (perhaps as long as five years) rather than </p>
<p>allowing other countries – who will not have borne any costs of the conflict itself – </p>
<p>to<b> </b>make their contribution.”</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>510. </b> Mr Dodds added that the net additional cost to the UK “would certainly be </p>
<p>hundreds of millions of pounds a year”, more if there were no UN authorisation. The </p>
<p>US appeared to favour a sectoral approach, but the need to bring in expertise from the </p>
<p>widest possible range of sources and to avoid the perception that the UK was occupying </p>
<p>“part of the Arab world” argued for a more internationalist approach. Mr Dodds explained </p>
<p>that Treasury officials were taking every opportunity to stress to FCO and MOD </p>
<p>colleagues that Mr Brown would want to have an input to any decision on sectorisation, </p>
<p>but recommended that he underline the point himself with Mr Blair, Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Mr<b> </b>Hoon.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> The following day, a Treasury official provided further advice to Mr Brown and </p>
<p>Mr Paul Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury.</p>

<p>upper limit, based on what was feasible in military terms, was a two-year commitment </p>
<p>at<b> </b>a total cost of £1.6bn. The advice continued: </p>
<p>“The extent to which any of this is optional is unclear. We think that, because </p>
<p>of our Geneva convention obligations, it will be impossible to resist keeping a </p>
<p>substantial force in theatre for at least six months post the end of fighting … In </p>
<p>practice the emerging politics of a post-conflict Iraq point to a much more substantial </p>
<p>commitment both in terms of size and length of stay.” </p>
<p><b>512. </b> The official raised the need to take into account the cost of humanitarian and </p>
<p>reconstruction assistance. He did not expect that the Treasury’s insistence that </p>
<p>departments (mainly DFID) should meet those costs through budget reprioritisation </p>
<p>would hold. As a “worst case”, he anticipated £250m for humanitarian costs and £250m </p>
<p>for reconstruction costs in the UK financial year 2003/04 (with figures for future years to </p>
<p>be determined later). </p>
<p><b>513. </b> On 24 February, Mr Jeremy Heywood, Principal Private Secretary to Mr Blair, sent </p>
<p>Mr Mark Bowman, Mr Brown’s Principal Private Secretary, a paper on financing Iraqi </p>
<p>reconstruction prepared by the No.10 Policy Directorate. Mr Blair wanted to share the </p>
<p>paper with the US as soon as possible.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> The paper was also sent to the FCO, DFID, </p>
<p>DTI and the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p><b>514. </b> The No.10 paper stated that the cost of “reconstruction and nation-building” in Iraq </p>
<p>would be between US$30bn and US$105bn, excluding the direct cost of conflict and </p>
<p>post-conflict peacekeeping. Only an administration enjoying the legitimacy provided by </p>
<p>the UN would be free to engage with the financial markets to secure funding for Iraq’s </p>
<p>long-term future.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> Mr Bowman replied on 25 February, explaining that the Treasury “fully supports the </p>
<p>main message of the paper, that, in the absence of a UN mandate, the financing costs of </p>
<p>reconstructing Iraq will be significantly higher”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> Mr Bowman offered detailed comments </p>
<p>on the text and pointed out that the Treasury was already involved in complementary </p>
<p>work alongside the IPU and in liaison with the US and Australia. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office reinforced the message that work was already under </p>
<p>way elsewhere, adding that “interdepartmental discussion is needed to get the complex </p>
<p>issues touched on right”.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> It added that, while it was welcome that No.10 wanted to </p>
<p>share UK concerns and explore options with the US at a high level, the paper needed </p>
<p>improvement. If shared with the US in its current form it would undermine efforts to build </p>

<p>Pragmatically, however, aftermath operations would commence locally whenever </p>

<p>“The FCO view was that other nations should be involved as soon as possible and </p>

<p>“The UK line to take at the Rock Drill would be the commitment in principle to the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Dr Brewer set out DFID’s approach to humanitarian planning. The UK was “well </p>
<p>placed to play an exemplary role in humanitarian support in the UK AOR but saw UN </p>
<p>authorisation as essential to effective involvement”. DFID had identified four potentially </p>
<p>complementary routes for delivering support (through UN agencies, the US military, UK </p>
<p>military and DFID bilaterally), subject to five possible scenarios ranging from no UNSCR </p>
<p>to an “all embracing UN mandate”. At the two extremes, it would only be “politically </p>
<p>possible” to provide a small amount of assistance without a second resolution, while a </p>
<p>“full UN mandate” would require funding of £300m-£400m per year. Training for a small </p>
<p>number of DFID staff had begun, but their deployment would depend on progress at the </p>
<p>UN. Ms Short, while working for full commitment through the UN, would not be seeking </p>
<p>additional resources beyond DFID’s £100m contingency reserve.</p>
<p><b>525. </b> Dr Brewer restated DFID’s position in a letter to Mr Bowen on 24 February, which </p>
<p>was copied to the MOD, FCO and Treasury.</p>
<p><b>526. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed that humanitarian operations formed an essential part </p>
<p>of the overall campaign, not least as a force protection measure, and should therefore </p>
<p>attract Treasury contingency funding. Adm Boyce directed that humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>be covered in the joint FCO/MOD position paper on post-conflict issues for the Rock </p>
<p>Drill, which should make clear the potential for conflict and post-conflict phases to run </p>
<p>in<b> </b>parallel from an early stage.</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Adm Boyce summarised the key points of the discussion on post-conflict </p>
<p>preparations, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Rock Drill should be used “to secure maximum [UK] influence without early </p>
<p>commitment to detail”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “UN-approved international civilian administrator” would be required;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK Phase IV activity should centre on the region around Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK military commitment should be “scaled down from large to medium in the </p>
<p>autumn”.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>528. </b> On 20 February, Mr Chilcott sent Mr Straw an IPU guidance note for officials taking </p>
<p>part in the Rock Drill.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> It had been agreed with Mr Ehrman, the MOD and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office, but not DFID. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Mr Chilcott’s covering minute to Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“There is barely any mention of the UN in the CENTCOM plans we have seen for </p>
<p>Phase IV (post-conflict) to date. But there are gaps in the plan, which is still fluid and </p>
<p>which we have the opportunity to influence. We shall encourage the US players at </p>

<p><b>530. </b> The attached guidance note focused on the arguments participants should deploy </p>

<p><b>531. </b> The guidance note stated that the UK and US agreed that “there must be a phased </p>

<p>US referred to “stabilisation”, “recovery” and “transition to security”.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> On sectorisation, the guidance stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UK will have, in the very short term, to administer the area where its forces are </p>
<p>at the end of hostilities. No commitment to administer divisional size area in the </p>
<p>medium to longer term. More likely a small area around Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>535. </b> The UK would make no commitment on any “vertical” (functional) sector, but, in </p>

<p><b>542. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq Morning Meeting on 24 February stated that the </p>
<p>Rock Drill:</p>
<p>“… revealed a large gap between the US’s ambitious plans and their ability to </p>
<p>deliver. Our message, that they need the Coalition and, therefore, UN authorisation, </p>
<p>appeared to hit home.”</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>543. </b> On 25 February, Lt Gen Garner discussed the Rock Drill with Maj Gen Cross. </p>
<p>According to Maj Gen Cross, Lt Gen Garner was irritated at US colleagues’ lack of </p>
<p>understanding of the scale of the task ahead, but did not seem to have tackled the issue </p>
<p>with Secretary Rumsfeld. Maj Gen Cross added that Lt Gen Garner was being “run </p>
<p>pretty ragged briefing people” and had little time to lead ORHA.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Maj Gen Cross told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… [the IPU] was very small and at that stage I sensed that we had no thoughts of </p>
<p>our own post-war.</p>
<p>“So when Dominick [Chilcott] and the team came out to the Rock Drill … all that </p>
<p>happened was that people listened to this debate rather than saying, ‘This is what </p>
<p>we think we should be doing.’”</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>545. </b> Mr Chilcott told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“We saw ORHA for the first time in action at a Rock Drill in the United States on </p>
<p>21 and 22 February, and there, I think, we realised quite how undercooked ORHA </p>
<p>was as an operation …</p>
<p>“… [T]hey hadn’t been in place very long, and although Jay Garner … was a </p>
<p>thoughtful, reasonable man who had experience of Iraq … most of the people who </p>
<p>he had asked to join him were at that stage, you know, like him, former retired </p>
<p>military officers and one didn’t get a sense that this was drawing on the best </p>
<p>information and best knowledge that was available to the US administration … </p>
<p>“… And I remember at the Rock Drill thinking that the scale of the challenge that </p>
<p>they are taking on is absolutely enormous, and the time they have got to do it is very </p>
<p>short and the number of people they have got to do it who really know about how to </p>
<p>run these things is actually very small. </p>
<p>“… [I]t wasn’t an organisation or an event, the Rock Drill, that inspired, I think, any of </p>
<p>us with a great deal of confidence that this was going to go smoothly.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>406</p>
<p>“So we had misgivings about whether we should be too closely associated with what </p>
<p>ORHA was doing. We also had other reasons to hesitate about the day after, which </p>
<p>was to do with the legality of ORHA’s ambition. ORHA had quite a high degree of </p>
<p>ambition in the amount of reform and reconstruction it was proposing, and we felt </p>
<p>without specific Security Council authorisation this would go beyond what we were </p>
<p>allowed to do as Occupying Powers on the basis of the Geneva Convention and the </p>
<p>Hague Regulations. So we had a legal issue and we had a kind of policy issue about </p>
<p>whether this should be a DoD beast, that made us hesitant. We certainly reported </p>
<p>our views on the shortcomings of ORHA when we went back.”</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>546. </b> Asked what the reaction had been in London, Mr Chilcott explained:</p>
<p>“We doubled our efforts in our bilaterals with the Americans to try and swing them </p>
<p>back into a sort of concept of operations that we felt was more likely to bring </p>
<p>success. </p>
<p>“So the ORHA Rock Drill was on 21 and 22 February, the Prime Minister chaired a </p>
<p>Ministerial meeting on day after issues on 6 March, which … raised the high level of </p>
<p>Ministerial engagement on these issues, and Mike O’Brien … led discussions on day </p>
<p>after issues on 13 March, which I attended as well, and then there was the 16 March </p>
<p>Azores Summit. </p>
<p>“So there were a series of high level events where we were making our points to the </p>
<p>Americans.”</p>
<p><b>547. </b> Mr Chilcott added: </p>
<p>“I can’t remember the lack of sense of preparation on the American side for a clear </p>
<p>post-war plan ever being brought up as a reason for the UK not to be involved in </p>
<p>whatever operation might be coming, because at the same time we had much bigger </p>
<p>things to worry about. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“And this may seem difficult to believe, but even until quite late in the day, we were </p>
<p>not sure ourselves in the Foreign Office … whether the UK would be involved … we </p>
<p>were only absolutely sure a relatively few number of days before things kicked off </p>
<p>that we were going to be involved. </p>
<p>“And there was even that wobble … when Rumsfeld said on television that if the </p>
<p>UK wants to come with us that’s fine, but if they don’t, we understand and we will </p>
<p>go it alone [see Section 3.8]. And that, I think, reflected at the time genuine doubt, </p>
<p>certainly within the IPU and, I think, more widely in Whitehall, as to whether we were </p>
<p>really going to be engaged or not.”</p>

<p><b>548. </b> In his written evidence to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Whitley explained:</p>
<p>“A ‘Rock Drill’ is US parlance for a complete mission rehearsal which assumes there </p>
<p>is a plan – there was not. Instead this conference ranged across US departments </p>
<p>describing how they were going to rewrite children’s history books, form an Iraqi </p>
<p>Fanny Mae,</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> what training for personnel was needed for ORHA, what weapons </p>
<p>they would have and so on …</p>
<p>“I have no idea if there were any UK objectives for the aftermath at all. The </p>
<p>only US articulation of an end state was ‘A country within current borders with </p>
<p>a democratically elected government’. The only direction I am aware of from the </p>
<p>Prime Minister was that ‘the behaviour of British Forces is to be exemplary’. Both </p>
<p>inadequate …</p>
<p>“The appointment of Garner and the creation of ORHA provided very clear </p>
<p>indications that DoD would take control of the aftermath. This became very clear </p>
<p>during the Rock Drill during which the State Department was publicly sidelined … </p>
<p>I … repeated my misgivings but without any great belief there was anything [the] UK </p>
<p>could do even if it was prepared to get engaged …”</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>549.  After the Rock Drill, Mr Chilcott reported that the US military envisaged </b></p>
<p><b>seven sectors in post-conflict Iraq, while ORHA would organise into three.</b></p>
<p><b>550.  Mr Chilcott advised against accepting a likely US offer for the UK to head an </b></p>
<p><b>ORHA sector.</b></p>
<p><b>551. </b> Sectorisation remained unresolved after the Rock Drill. Mr Chilcott set out his </p>
<p>understanding of the latest position on 24 February:</p>
<p>“Sectors mean different things at different times in Phase IV. And the military and </p>
<p>ORHA have different sized sectors in mind …”</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Mr Chilcott explained that it was not yet possible to know how large the UK </p>
<p>Division’s AOR would be in Phase IVa, the stabilisation phase. In Phase IVb, the </p>
<p>recovery phase, CENTCOM planners envisaged Iraq being divided into seven sectors, </p>
<p>each headed by a two-star general. Whether a two-star general would have a division </p>
<p>under his command would depend on the availability of forces and the degree of </p>
<p>difficulty in maintaining stability:</p>
<p>“If there is organised resistance to the Coalition’s presence, the number of boots </p>
<p>needed on the ground could considerably outstrip the Coalition’s ability to provide </p>
<p>them. In Belfast, a city of 750,000, during the troubles, some 250 terrorists kept </p>

<p>16 battalions busy. Basra province (the most likely UK AOR) has a population of </p>
<p>about two million.”</p>
<p><b>553. </b> Mr Chilcott reported that (acting) Maj Gen Whitley needed guidance from London </p>
<p>on the size of the UK commitment to Phase IV. He added that, at the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>Committee on 19 February, Adm Boyce:</p>
<p>“… thought we should aim to reduce to a medium size (ie one brigade) within six </p>
<p>months and then stay at that level for as long as necessary.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> Provided we can </p>
<p>attract suitable partners to join us (and that would almost certainly depend on having </p>
<p>UNSCR authorisation for Phase IV), having a UK two-star in charge of one of the </p>
<p>sectors would be a reasonable outcome.” </p>
<p><b>554. </b> Mr Chilcott explained that ORHA would organise into three sectors – north, central </p>
<p>and south, aligned with military sectors containing “very large numbers of people”. For </p>
<p>as long as ORHA had no UN mandate, its work would be politically controversial and </p>
<p>was “likely to be very messy”. Mr Chilcott advised against accepting an expected offer </p>
<p>from Lt Gen Garner for Maj Gen Cross to lead one of the three sectors. </p>
<p><b>555. </b> It is not clear who saw Mr Chilcott’s paper, but some of the issues raised were </p>
<p>discussed at a meeting chaired by Mr Blair on 6 March.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the initial expectation was that we would be there for a while, without defining </p>
<p>exactly what it was. But we certainly weren’t expecting, the day after achieving </p>
<p>success, to start drawing down our numbers; we were expecting to be there for </p>
<p>a considerable period of time.”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Lord Boyce explained: “I thought we would be there for three or four years at least, </p>
<p>and said so at the time.” He added: </p>
<p>“The theoretical planning against the defence planning assumptions is you don’t </p>
<p>do this sort of operation for an extended period longer than about six months. But </p>
<p>it never seemed to me very likely that we would be out [of] there in six months.” </p>

<p><b>558.  Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush on the second resolution, sent on </b></p>

<p><b>559.  There is no indication that, when Mr Blair discussed Iraq with President Bush </b></p>
<p><b>on 19 February, he raised either post-conflict planning or the post-conflict role of </b></p>

<p><b>560. </b> On 18 February, in response to a request for advice for Mr Blair’s discussion with </p>
<p>President Bush the next day (see Section 3.7), Sir David Manning wrote that there would </p>
<p>be a much better chance of gaining support for the second resolution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>if it was clear that the UN would have a “key role” after any military action and </p>
<p>that a “massive humanitarian aid programme” would be instituted; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>by publishing and implementing the Road Map on Israel/Palestine before any </p>
<p>military action. </p>
<p>Sir David advised Mr Blair that both points would be a “tough sell” with President Bush, </p>
<p>but “both are very important in helping us to win the argument”.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush a six page Note on 19 February, reflecting the </p>
<p>seriousness of the UK’s concerns about the second resolution.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> The Note is addressed </p>
<p>in detail in Section 3.7. </p>
<p><b>562. </b> At the end of the Note, Mr Blair offered “two further thoughts”: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Publishing the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP) Road Map would have </p>
<p>“a massive impact”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “need to start firming up the humanitarian work for the aftermath </p>
<p>of the conflict … and show how we will protect and improve the lives of Iraqi </p>
<p>people”.</p>
<p><b>563. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by telephone on 19 February.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>564. </b> Before the call, the FCO submitted the advice on key messages for use with </p>
<p>President Bush commissioned at Mr Blair’s meeting on 13 February.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> The briefing </p>
<p>paper was prepared by the IPU in collaboration with the MOD, the Treasury, DFID and </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office, and listed reasons for moving quickly to a UN interim administration </p>
<p>operating alongside a “robust Coalition military presence to ensure security”. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“The greater the degree of UN involvement, the greater our ability to take part in </p>

<p><b>567. </b> There is no indication in the record that Mr Blair raised either post-conflict planning </p>

<p><b>568.  Mr Mandelson raised UK military concerns about post-conflict planning with </b></p>

<p>emailed Mr Blair and Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, about Iraq, </p>
<p>commenting that “people are more worried about what follows a war than winning it”.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Mandelson stated that:</p>
<p>“American occupation and rule will be highly de-stabilising and will, in my view, </p>
<p>radicalise opinion far more than the military action itself … At the moment, the </p>
<p>Arab League is well balanced … If post-Saddam Iraq goes wrong we can expect </p>
<p>mounting trouble. I should add here that Air Marshal Brian Burridge [UK National </p>
<p>Contingent Commander (NCC)] and [Major] General Peter Wall [Deputy Chief of </p>
<p>Operations] whom I saw at the US/British HQ outside Doha are also worried about </p>
<p>post-Saddam planning. I am not sure exactly what is worrying them so much but </p>
<p>they fear an FCO reluctance to ‘post plan’ too much, that we are not developing our </p>
<p>own independent views but following in the American train and that we will not have </p>
<p>sufficient strength on the ground to enforce our own judgements and will over the </p>
<p>best arrangements for Iraqi governance after the hostilities. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“They wonder whether the perceived lack of British pre-planning over the </p>
<p>humanitarian follow up is because Clare [Short] won’t accept the likelihood of war. </p>
<p>They emphasise the clear up – in different scenarios – will be huge. Are we all really </p>
<p>ready for it, they wonder.”</p>

<p>Assessment ‘Southern Iraq: What’s in Store?’.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Coalition forces will face large refugee flows, possibly compounded by </p>
<p>contamination and panic caused by CBW use. They may also face millions </p>
<p>of Iraqis needing food and clean water without an effective UN presence and </p>
<p>environmental disaster from burning oil wells.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iran does not have an agreed policy on Iraq beyond active neutrality. </p>
<p>Nevertheless Iran may support small-scale cross-border interventions by armed </p>
<p>groups to attack the Mujahideen e Khalq (MEK). The Islamic Revolutionary </p>
<p>Guards Corps (IRGC) will continue to meddle in southern Iraq. Iranian reactions </p>
<p>to a Coalition presence in southern Iraq remain unclear but are unlikely to be </p>
<p>aggressive.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Post-Saddam the security situation in the South will be unpredictable. There is </p>
<p>a high risk of revenge killings of former regime officials. Law and order may be </p>
<p>further undermined by settling of scores between armed tribal groups.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Popular support for any post-Saddam administration in the South will depend </p>
<p>on adequately involving the Shia in the government of Iraq as a whole as well as </p>
<p>engaging the remains of the state bureaucracy in the South, local tribal leaders </p>
<p>and Shia clerics in local government.”</p>
<p><b>573. </b> The JIC emphasised that intelligence on southern Iraq was limited. </p>
<p><b>574. </b> In addition to assessments of Iraqi military dispositions and the immediate Iraqi </p>
<p>and Shia responses to an attack, the JIC looked at Iranian policy and the post-Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein political and security landscape. </p>
<p><b>575. </b> The Assessment stated that Iran’s aims in response to a Coalition presence in Iraq </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preventing refugee flows into Iran;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring a leading role for its allies among the Iraqi Shia (the Supreme Council </p>
<p>for an Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and its armed wing the Badr Corps);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>minimising the size and duration of a US presence; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>destroying the MEK.</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Iran had interests throughout Iraq, but might consider that it had the greatest </p>
<p>influence to pursue them in the South, through armed Shia groups such as the Badr </p>
<p>Corps. The Badr Corps was estimated to be 3,000 to 5,000 strong, but “with the addition </p>
<p>of reservists this may increase up to 20,000”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>577. </b> The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“If the Coalition does not deal with the MEK, Iran may make limited cross-border </p>
<p>rocket attacks on them … [T]he Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) might </p>
<p>act to undermine any post-Saddam peace that did not take Iran’s concerns into </p>
<p>account … We judge that both Iranian conservatives and reformers are anxious to </p>
<p>avoid provoking a US-led attack on Iran. We therefore assess that <b>Iranian-inspired </b></p>
<p><b>terrorist attacks on Coalition forces are unlikely, unless the Iranians thought </b></p>
<p><b>the US had decided to attack them after an Iraq campaign</b>.”</p>
<p><b>578. </b> The JIC assessed that the Iranian regime was preoccupied with domestic concerns </p>
<p>and was not in a strong position to project its power into Iraq. </p>
<p><b>579. </b> Shia politics in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq were described as “highly </p>
<p>unpredictable”:</p>
<p>“Saddam’s regime has centralised power and stifled opposition. The only networks </p>
<p>of influence in the South that exist outside of the Ba’ath Party are the tribes and </p>
<p>the followers of some of the senior Shia clerics. Once the regime has collapsed, </p>
<p>Coalition forces will find the remains of the state’s bureaucratic structures, local tribal </p>
<p>sheiks and religious leaders. There will also be a number of fractious armed groups, </p>
<p>some strengthened by arms seized during the collapse of the regime. The external </p>
<p>opposition will attempt to assert authority, but only those with armed forces on the </p>
<p>ground or support from senior Shia clerics, such as SCIRI or Da’wa, another Shia </p>
<p>Islamist group, are likely to succeed to any extent …</p>
<p>“Given that the Shia in southern Iraq have borne the brunt of regime oppression </p>
<p>since 1991, there is a high probability of revenge killing of Ba’ath officials, both </p>
<p>Sunni and Shia. This could be particularly widespread and bloody … Beyond that </p>
<p>the extent of any further breakdown of law and order is difficult to predict. But there </p>
<p>will be large numbers of armed groups and some potential for tribal score-settling </p>
<p>… Overall there is a risk of a wider breakdown as the regime’s authority crumbles. </p>
<p>There are no indications, however, of Shia preparations for an all-out civil war </p>
<p>against Sunni Iraqis … Iraqis may not welcome Coalition military forces, despite </p>
<p>welcoming the overthrow of Saddam. <b>The establishment of popular support </b></p>
<p><b>for any post-Saddam administration cannot be taken for granted. </b>It could be </p>
<p>undermined by: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>damage to holy sites;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>major civilian casualties;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of a UNSCR authorising a new administration;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>failure to meet popular expectations over humanitarian aid and </p>

<p>regardless of whether there is a formal UK zone of control”.</p>
<p>248</p>

<p>which was not received in Whitehall until late on 24 February. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> Mr Cannon provided Mr Blair with a list of IPU activities, drawn from Mr Chilcott’s </p>

<p>particular attention to a paper in preparation “outlining our principles and ‘red lines’ for a </p>
<p>post-Saddam Iraq … for use initially by David Manning with Condi Rice and … possibly </p>
<p>by you with President Bush”.</p>
<p><b>584. </b> A set of IPU papers addressing those issues was sent to No.10 on 26 February.</p>

<p>environmental damage and the impact of CBW strikes.”</p>

<p><b>587. </b> Mr Blair’s views on pre-invasion analysis of post-conflict Iraq are addressed later </p>

<p><b>the potential for violence in a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>589.  The paper prompted Mr Blair to ask a number of questions about plans for </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict. </b></p>

<p><i>and Society in the Shadow of Regime Change</i>, published by the IISS.</p>
<p>252</p>

<p><b>591. </b> Several contributors to the Adelphi Paper warned of the potential for violent </p>
<p>disorder in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>592. </b> Dr Isam al Khafaji (International School of Humanities and Social Sciences, </p>
<p>University of Amsterdam) cautioned that “the horrendous task of overthrowing Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime may prove to be less painful than that of dealing with the interest groups that </p>
<p>have taken firm root in Iraqi society and owe varying forms and degrees of allegiance </p>
<p>to the power structure that has been in place since 1968”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> He considered that violence </p>
<p>was likely in the immediate aftermath of US military action but did not anticipate a civil </p>
<p>war along sectarian (Sunni versus Shia) lines. He also considered that a period of </p>
<p>foreign occupation was likely to be resented by the Iraqi population and become a cause </p>
<p>for violence.</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Looking at southern Iraq, Dr Faleh Jabar (Birkbeck College, London) cautioned </p>
<p>against assumptions that the Shia community was homogenous and likely to be </p>
<p>quiescent in the transition to a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p><b>599.  DFID explained that its humanitarian plan involved working primarily through </b></p>
<p><b>the UN. If additional resources were made available, it would consider a more </b></p>
<p><b>active bilateral role in any UK-controlled zone. The department also expressed </b></p>
<p><b>severe doubts about the adequacy of US humanitarian preparations.</b></p>
<p><b>600. </b> The FCO answered three of Mr Blair’s questions of 20 February about post-conflict </p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> On preventing a Shia uprising, it advised the key would be:</p>
<p>“… to assure the varied Shia communities that they will be fairly represented in </p>
<p>future Iraq … A majority would probably hope to see a secular government … Much </p>
<p>will also depend on the length of a Coalition ‘occupation’. If they see Western control </p>
<p>becoming quasi-permanent, this too may arouse opposition, probably encouraged </p>
<p>by neighbours like Iran.”</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, from autumn 2002:</p>
<p>“… we focused very much on what we would find and how we would deal with it. </p>
<p>Also … I raised this issue myself several times, you know, how would the Sunni/Shia </p>
<p>relationship work out?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“There was very much discussion of the Sunni/Shia issue, and we were well aware </p>
<p>of that … people did not believe that you would have Al Qaida coming in from </p>
<p>outside and … that you would end up in a situation where Iran … would then try </p>
<p>deliberately to destabilise the country.”</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>602. </b> On plans for a successor government, the FCO stated:</p>
<p>“We and the US envisage a three-stage process following the conflict.</p>
<p>“Immediately after military action, the effective ruler of Iraq will be General </p>
<p>McKiernan, the Coalition Land Forces Commander, reporting to General Franks </p>
<p>in the US.</p>
<p>“Once the country has been stabilised, the US intend to establish a civilian </p>
<p>administration in Iraq. To do this they have created … ORHA … We think this </p>
<p>part of the US plan is flawed. We have argued for a UN-led or UN-authorised civil </p>
<p>administration, and we do not think having a US General in charge is sensible.</p>
<p>“How long the [civilian] Transitional Administration would operate is anyone’s guess. </p>
<p>The US argue it will be 18 months – 2 years … Their level of ambition is very high </p>
<p>and not matched by their resources … They aim to help the Iraqis rewrite their </p>
<p>constitution and establish pluralist politics, to hold elections and to create a free </p>
<p>market economy.</p>

<p>“The first elections would be local. The goal of the Transitional Administration will be </p>
<p>to create an environment in which national elections are possible. After elections, </p>
<p>the Transitional Administration will be able to hand over to an elected national </p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>“We believe that, contrary to the assumptions sometimes made, the Transitional </p>
<p>Administration will be able to draw on a relatively competent Iraqi civil service. </p>
<p>The Iraqi civil service has continued to function through several regime changes,</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and we see no reason why it should not do so again, with changes at the highest </p>
<p>level only.” </p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, if there had been “even more focus” on planning, </p>
<p>the UK “would still have been focusing essentially on the humanitarian side, with an </p>
<p>assumption that we would inherit a functioning civil service infrastructure, and it was that </p>
<p>assumption that proved to be wrong”.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> The UK “didn’t plan for … the absence of this </p>
<p>properly functioning civil service infrastructure”.</p>
<p><b>604. </b> In response to Mr Blair’s question about the role of the UN in the new government, </p>
<p>the FCO stated that any Transitional Administration would require UN Security Council </p>
<p>authorisation. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> The FCO advised that UN involvement would also be needed to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide the legal mandate to reform and restructure Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>secure international and regional support; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>bring in the IMF and World Bank; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adapt the OFF and sanctions regimes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>verify WMD finds and destruction. </p>
<p><b>606. </b> The FCO added that the Coalition would still need to lead on security, and that </p>
<p>Security Council authorisation would be required for both civilian and security functions.</p>
<p><b>607. </b> DFID answered the fourth of Mr Blair’s questions, on humanitarian issues and the </p>
<p>UK plan to address them.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> The department advised that the scale of the humanitarian </p>
<p>crisis would depend on the nature of the conflict. A key priority was therefore to minimise </p>
<p>risks to civilians, infrastructure and, in order to protect Iraqi revenues, oil production. </p>
<p>DFID emphasised that:</p>
<p>“There is more scope to <b>refine the Coalition military options and minimise </b></p>
<p><b>these risks</b>. If this is not done, the consequences … are potentially too great for the </p>
<p>international humanitarian system to plan on current resources.”</p>

<p>418</p>
<p><b>608. </b> DFID also stated that the military would need adequate plans to deal with the </p>
<p>civilian impact of CBW use before the UN and NGOs arrived. More generally, the role </p>
<p>of UN agencies and NGOs would be determined by the extent of UN cover. There were </p>
<p>also “severe doubts about the adequacy of US humanitarian preparations”. </p>
<p><b>609. </b> Mr Blair’s question about the plan for addressing humanitarian issues was </p>
<p>answered in one sentence:</p>
<p>“DFID is planning to work primarily through UN agencies, unless extra financial </p>
<p>resources are available, in which case a more active bilateral role in any </p>
<p>UK-controlled zone could be considered.” </p>
<p><b>A UN “badge” for post-conflict Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>610.  Mr Blair raised the importance of a UN “badge” with Gen Franks on </b></p>
<p><b>25 February. </b></p>
<p><b>611.  He told Parliament later the same day that the UN must have a “key role” in </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict Iraq and that discussions were under way on exactly what that role </b></p>
<p><b>would be. </b></p>
<p><b>612.  Sir David Manning explained to Dr Rice that Mr Blair attached importance to </b></p>
<p><b>the UN’s role, but was clear that UN involvement must not be at the expense of </b></p>
<p><b>efficient administration and effective reconstruction.</b></p>
<p><b>613. </b> On 25 February, Mr Blair told Gen Franks that he “still hoped that the UN could be </p>
<p>brought on board” and that: “In any post-Saddam administration, the UN ‘badge’ would </p>
<p>help pull the international community, including the Arabs and European public opinion </p>
<p>back on board.”</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>614. </b> Mr Blair and Gen Franks also discussed the possibility that “an occupation could </p>
<p>work in several ways on a continuum from a US occupation of Japan model downwards” </p>
<p>and that “it was important to work on the details, to avoid any perception of a US </p>
<p>occupation”.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Mr Watkins informed Mr Hoon (who was due to meet Gen Franks in Qatar on </p>
<p>26 February) that, during a meeting earlier in the day, Gen Franks had told Adm Boyce </p>
<p>that Iraq would need to be under Coalition control for some time, during which there </p>
<p>would need to be discussion with the UN on establishing a UN mandate.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> Gen Franks </p>
<p>had added that, contrary to press speculation, the US was not seriously considering </p>
<p>anything along the lines of post-Second World War Germany or Japan. He had also </p>
<p>agreed with a comment from Mr Webb that, in order to convince regional opinion of its </p>
<p>intent, the US needed to start talking to the UN, but the US did not want to do anything </p>

<p>Mr Watkins recommended that Mr Hoon use that opening to pursue with Gen Franks </p>
<p>the UK’s preference for “a ‘transitional civilian administration’ under UN auspices”.</p>
<p><b>616. </b> Mr Hoon and AM Burridge met Gen Franks in Qatar on 26 February. The MOD </p>

<p>or a UN mandate.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> During an exchange on the build-up of Coalition Forces in the </p>

<p>decisions. It was important that the military robustly told the politicians when they </p>

<p><b>618. </b> In response to questions from Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, </p>
<p>about UN humanitarian contingency planning and “what contingencies the Government </p>
<p>have planned for a representative government in Iraq”, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“In relation to humanitarian considerations and what type of government might </p>

<p>with allies and the UN. I should like to emphasise that in my view if it comes to </p>

<p><b>The DIS Red Team</b></p>
<p>Between February and April 2003 the DIS Red Team produced five reports on post-conflict </p>
<p>issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘Regional Responses to Conflict in Iraq and the Aftermath’;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘Obtaining and Retaining the Support of the Iraqi People in the Aftermath of </p>
<p>Conflict’;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘What Will Happen in Baghdad?’;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘The Future Governance of Iraq’;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘The Strands of the Rope’ (an assessment of the steps needed to achieve </p>
<p>an effective Iraqi Interim Administration and hand over to a representative </p>
<p>government of Iraq).</p>
<p>The first two reports are addressed in this Section. The other three were issued in April, </p>
<p>after the start of the invasion, and are described in Section 10.1.</p>
<p>Four of the five reports were described as drawing on “a variety of sources inside the </p>
<p>Allied intelligence community and … a panel of regional experts assembled … by </p>
<p>Kings College, London”.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> Professor Sir Lawrence Freedman was listed as one of the </p>
<p>contributors to the first paper.</p>
<p>The fifth report, on Baghdad, “sought the perspectives of academic sources and members </p>
<p>of the Iraqi exile community in UK (military and civilian) to gain fresh insights, and to a </p>
<p>certain extent reflects their views”.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All five reports were copied widely within the MOD, to PJHQ (Lt Gen Reith), the JIC </p>
<p>(Mr Scarlett) and to the FCO/IPU (Mr Ehrman and Mr Chilcott). The last three were also </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>630. </b> The first Red Team report (‘Regional Responses to Conflict in Iraq and the </p>
<p>Aftermath’) was issued on 28 February.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> It described Iraq as “a very complex society” </p>
<p>and cautioned that “any attempt to analyse it in neat categories based on religion, </p>
<p>ethnicity or tribe will almost certainly be over simplistic”. The report advised that, by </p>
<p>comparison with the previous British mandate in Iraq, which had relied on advisers </p>
<p>like Gertrude Bell with an intimate knowledge of the country and its people, “our </p>
<p>understanding of Iraqi society today can be shallow”. </p>
<p><b>631. </b> The Red Team’s key judgements drew heavily on earlier JIC Assessments and </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for Coalition Forces to assume immediate responsibility for law and </p>
<p>order to avoid other forces stepping into an internal security vacuum;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that most Iraqis would initially view the Coalition as a liberating force, but support </p>
<p>was likely to erode rapidly if the interim administration was not acceptable to the </p>
<p>population and it could not see a road map towards a pluralist, representative </p>
<p>Iraqi-led administration;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the risk of creating fertile ground for Al Qaida, which could deliberately cause </p>
<p>civilian casualties to undermine the establishment of a representative Iraqi-led </p>
<p>administration. </p>
<p><b>632. </b> The report stated that Al Qaida:</p>
<p>“… seeks removal of Western presence/influence from the Gulf and wants to see the </p>
<p>US/UK operation go badly. AQ [Al Qaida] are currently in some disarray but will wish </p>
<p>to take the opportunity presented by the US/UK operation to re-establish credibility </p>
<p>and encourage widespread anti-Western activity in the region. However:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Initially AQ shares a common goal with the Coalition: regime change. Once </p>
<p>completed, goals will diverge rapidly and UK/US forces will present a rich </p>
<p>target for terrorist attack.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>AQ fears the establishment of a pluralist, representative Iraqi government </p>
<p>as it undermines their argument that Muslims can only achieve self-</p>
<p>determination in a unitary Islamic theocracy. They could deliberately cause </p>
<p>civilian casualties to undermine the Coalition’s position.” </p>

<p><b>634.  Ms Short was keen for DFID to support an exemplary humanitarian effort </b></p>
<p><b>in any UK-controlled sector, but DFID’s role would be constrained by:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the extent of the UN mandate; and </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the financial resources available (under most scenarios DFID would want </b></p>
<p><b>to allocate significant funding to UN agencies working throughout Iraq).</b></p>
<p><b>635.  DFID was doing scoping work on the role it might play if there were a </b></p>
<p><b>UN mandate, but the department did not have Ms Short’s authority to deploy </b></p>
<p><b>operationally or to make substantive plans to deploy “in an exemplary role”.</b></p>
<p><b>636.  Ms Short stated her position in Cabinet on 27 February.</b></p>
<p><b>637. </b> Ms Short held a meeting on Iraq with DFID officials, including Dr Brewer and </p>
<p>Mr Fernie, on 24 February.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> The record was copied to Mr Chakrabarti’s Private Office. </p>
<p><b>638. </b> The record stated that there was “increased recognition across Whitehall of the </p>
<p>likely scale of post-conflict activity, and the essential nature of UN involvement and </p>
<p>authority if this was to be effectively addressed”. Ms Short emphasised the importance </p>
<p>of a “substantive” second resolution that clearly justified any action taken under it. </p>
<p>She asked officials “to keep closely abreast of the debate on the legality of occupation </p>
<p>of Iraq without any UN mandate”.</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Officials reported that ORHA’s state of preparedness was “extremely worrying”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humanitarian plans were the most advanced, but ORHA did not yet have </p>
<p>sufficient funds, staff or capacity to deliver them. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction plans were “not nearly as well advanced as they should have </p>
<p>been at this point”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Civil administration plans were the least advanced, and ORHA “would not be </p>
<p>ready by the six week deadline they had been set”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Logistical support planning had only just begun. ORHA had “not even started on </p>
<p>such vital areas as telecommunications”. </p>
<p><b>640. </b> The record of the meeting stated that Ms Short would write to Mr Blair after </p>
<p>Dr Brewer’s forthcoming visit to New York, setting out the dangers this situation would </p>
<p>pose in the event of early military action that was not authorised by the UN and did not </p>
<p>enjoy wide international support.</p>
<p><b>641. </b> The meeting also considered financial issues. Although the MOD and FCO </p>
<p>“appeared to be more aware of the financial constraints, and the need for the widest </p>
<p>possible burden sharing within the international community, we [DFID] had as yet no </p>
<p>clear response to the issue of the limitation of DFID’s engagement imposed on it by our </p>

<p>financial situation”. Ms Short reported that Mr Brown “had indicated to her, in a private </p>
<p>conversation, that he ‘would do what he could to help’”. </p>
<p><b>642. </b> The same day, Dr Brewer sent Mr Bowen and senior officials in the MOD, FCO and </p>
<p>Treasury a letter setting out Ms Short’s position on what DFID could do following any </p>
<p>conflict.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> The letter reflected the conclusions of Ms Short’s meeting with DFID officials </p>
<p>on 18 February and Dr Brewer’s presentation to the Chiefs of Staff on 19 February.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>643. </b> Dr Brewer stated:</p>
<p>“Although she [Ms Short] would be keen for DFID to support an exemplary </p>
<p>humanitarian effort in any UK-controlled sector, our [DFID’s] role will be constrained </p>
<p>by the extent of the UN mandate and the financial resources available to us. </p>
<p>We have a strong commitment to the UN agencies, and would want to allocate </p>
<p>significant funding to them under most scenarios. Drawing heavily on our </p>
<p>contingency reserve and existing humanitarian aid and Iraq budget lines is unlikely </p>
<p>to release more than £60-70m for humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2003/04. Given </p>
<p>our predictions of the humanitarian needs, with this level of funding we would not be </p>
<p>able to play the exemplary role [in the South] the Prime Minister has asked for, and </p>
<p>it would be irresponsible of us to plan to do so.”</p>
<p><b>644. </b> On the UN mandate, Dr Brewer stated:</p>
<p>“The role which DFID can play in funding our usual humanitarian partners may be </p>
<p>further constrained by perceptions of the legality of any conflict and what happens </p>
<p>afterwards, and also by humanitarian principles of impartiality and independence. </p>
<p>UN mandates justifying not only military force but also a continuing international </p>
<p>presence afterwards are critical to ensuring the international community can engage </p>
<p>fully with the predicted enormous needs.”</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Dr Brewer described DFID’s potential role under four scenarios closely based on </p>
<p>those discussed at the DFID meeting on 18 February:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“No second UNSCR, no mandated UN humanitarian role.” DFID would fund </p>
<p>those international agencies willing to accept UK money and best placed to </p>
<p>respond.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Second UNSCR but no mandated UN humanitarian role (overall US lead).” </p>
<p>DFID would additionally fund UK military QIPs, although without additional </p>
<p>resources, the total was unlikely to exceed £5m. “We have doubts about how </p>
<p>much the UN would be able to do beyond immediate relief with only a thin </p>
<p>second SCR if a US-led Coalition assumed medium-term control of the country.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Second UNSCR and clear humanitarian mandate.” DFID would want to be </p>
<p>“positively engaged” with the UK military, US humanitarian effort and the UN. </p>
<p>It would also “consider bilateral operations in any UK sector”, but commitments </p>
<p>to UN agencies across Iraq and the region would “severely financially constrain </p>
<p>what we could do in a UK-controlled sector with the UK military and other </p>
<p>partners”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Second UNSCR, clear humanitarian mandate and additional resources.” </p>
<p>With adequate finances, DFID “would be able to play the exemplary role </p>
<p>suggested by the Prime Minister”. Without, DFID could discuss with the MOD </p>
<p>what the exemplary role might entail, but could not plan for it “without more </p>
<p>comfort on resources”.</p>
<p><b>646. </b> Dr Brewer stated that DFID staff were committed to advising the MOD and Armed </p>
<p>Forces in all circumstances and that MOD-DFID links were now strong. DFID was also </p>
<p>doing “scoping work” on the role it might play if there were a UN mandate:</p>
<p>“But we do not currently have political authority to deploy operationally, or to </p>
<p>make substantive plans to deploy in an exemplary role (eg commissioning or  </p>
<p>pre-positioning material). Our Secretary of State has made our financial position </p>
<p>clear in two letters to the Prime Minister.” </p>
<p><b>647.  Dr Brewer’s letter illustrated the absence of an agreed UK approach to the </b></p>
<p><b>provision of humanitarian relief, highlighting the gap between DFID’s focus on </b></p>
<p><b>supporting the UN, Red Cross and NGOs across Iraq and the UK military’s focus </b></p>
<p><b>on the humanitarian situation in its Area of Operations (AO) in the South. </b></p>

<p>concern to Mr Hoon’s Private Office about humanitarian assistance during the early </p>
<p>stages of military conflict.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> The MOD and DFID believed US plans for humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance were inadequate, in particular because they relied on delivery by NGOs, </p>
<p>which would not be there in numbers early on. The UK military would therefore need:</p>
<p>“… immediate access to sufficient expertise and resources to … make good the </p>
<p>deficiencies in the US plans. In particular … DFID experts deployed in theatre, who </p>
<p>can advise what is actually required … (as opposed to soldiers making it up as they </p>
<p>go along) … There are lead-times associated with this … Waiting till after a second </p>
<p>SCR is leaving it too late. We know DFID haven’t got any money. That is why they </p>
<p>need to ask for some, now.”</p>

<p> He suggested to </p>

<p>Ministers’ attention collectively”. </p>
<p><b>651. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, who saw Dr Brewer’s letter a few days later, commented on </p>
<p>7 March:</p>
<p>“The problem here is that DFID have a wrong view of what the Armed Forces can </p>
<p>or should do to administer humanitarian relief, as distinct from civil, UN and NGO </p>
<p>agencies – including DFID themselves.”</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>652.  Mr Blair told Cabinet on 27 February that humanitarian and reconstruction </b></p>
<p><b>planning needed to take “centre stage” and that he would raise the issue with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>653. </b> In Cabinet on 27 February, Mr Hoon reported on his meeting with General Franks </p>
<p>in Qatar the previous day (see Section 3.7).</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> Mr Hoon had discussed concerns with </p>
<p>General Franks that:</p>
<p>“Not enough planning had been done on the post-conflict phase of operations, </p>
<p>including humanitarian relief. British forces could find themselves in charge of a </p>
<p>portion of Iraq quite quickly if resistance to Coalition military action collapsed. It </p>
<p>would be helpful if experts from the Department for International Development could </p>
<p>work with military planners in the region and consider pre-positioning humanitarian </p>
<p>supplies so that there was no hiatus in the event that military action took place.”</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Ms Short told Cabinet that experts had been involved in talks in the Pentagon. </p>
<p>Preparations were “just beginning and needed to be expedited”. A UN legal mandate </p>
<p>was “essential” for the humanitarian and reconstruction tasks that lay ahead. Without </p>
<p>that, “proper preparation was impossible”. That matter “needed to become a priority </p>
<p>for the Coalition”. It would be “difficult” to accommodate action in Iraq within her </p>
<p>department’s contingency reserve: “Greater resources were likely to be needed.” </p>
<p><b>655.  The Inquiry considers that Ms Short’s reluctance to prepare for a wider UK </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict role, though not critical to the outcome, and consistent with DFID’s </b></p>
<p><b>statutory role, contributed to the Government’s failure to ensure that the UK was </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>662. </b> On 28 February, Mr Wood advised:</p>
<p>“The legal basis for the occupation of Iraq by Coalition forces in a post-conflict phase </p>
<p>would depend initially on the legal basis for the use of force. That legal basis is </p>
<p>likely to be Security Council authorisation for military action to enforce Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>obligations under SCRs. But the longer an occupation went on, and the further the </p>
<p>tasks undertaken departed from this objective, the more difficult it would become </p>
<p>to justify an occupation in legal terms.</p>
<p>“Without a Security Council mandate for the post-conflict phase, the status of the </p>
<p>occupying forces would be that of belligerent occupants, who would have the </p>
<p>rights and responsibilities laid down by international humanitarian law as set out in </p>
<p>particular in the Hague Regulations of 1907 and the Geneva Conventions of 1949. </p>
<p>The rights of belligerent occupants are quite limited … </p>
<p>“FCO Legal Advisers are closely involved in the establishment of our policy on </p>

<p><b>666. </b> FCO Legal Advisers had sent the IPU an overview of the legal framework for the </p>
<p>post-conflict administration of justice on 16 February.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> The paper, which was copied </p>
<p>to the MOD, explained that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With certain exceptions, the penal laws of the occupied territory would remain in </p>
<p>force (Geneva Convention IV, Article 64).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Again with certain exceptions, the administration of justice should remain in the </p>
<p>hands of the incumbent administration and courts (Geneva Convention IV, article </p>
<p>64; Hague Regulations, Article 43).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Where possible, existing personnel involved in the administration of justice </p>
<p>should remain in their positions (Geneva Convention IV, Article 54).</p>
<p><b>667. </b> The paper also listed some of the issues “it may be useful to consider … in </p>
<p>advance of a conflict”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identification of laws to be applied, amended, repealed or enacted by an </p>
<p>occupying force;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a scoping study of the current state of the criminal justice system;</p>

<p>maintenance of known crime sites; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>development of a public information and awareness campaign.</p>
<p><b>The legal framework for Occupation</b></p>
<p>As Occupying Powers, the UK and US were bound by international law on belligerent </p>
<p>occupation. Its rules are set out in the 1907 Hague Regulations (Articles 42 to 56), the </p>
<p>Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 </p>
<p>(Articles 27 to 34 and 47 to 78) and the 1977 First Protocol to the Geneva Conventions </p>
<p>of 1949 Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>Article 42 of the Hague Regulations defines an Occupation as follows: </p>
<p>“Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the </p>
<p>hostile army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has </p>
<p>been established and can be exercised.” </p>
<p>Article 43 of the Hague Regulations provides that the Occupying Power “shall take all the </p>
<p>measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety </p>
<p>while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country”. </p>

<p>Sir Michael Wood, the FCO Legal Adviser from 1999 to 2006, explained in his second </p>

<p>“While some changes to the legislative and administrative structure may be </p>
<p>permissible if they are necessary for public order and safety, more wide-reaching </p>
<p>reforms of governmental and administrative structures are not lawful. That includes </p>
<p>the imposition of major economic reforms.”</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Mr Straw commented on Mr Wood’s advice on 1 March:</p>
<p>“This is good advice: having UN authority for post-conflict Occupation makes sense </p>
<p>politically as well as legally. I’d be happy to receive further advice from Michael </p>
<p>Wood, or talk to him, about whether I should lobby C Powell on progress.”</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>669. </b> Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, sent those comments </p>

<p>293</p>
<p><b>670. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I was clear that under international law … we would be bound by the 1907 Hague </p>
<p>Regulations as well as the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. We would therefore </p>
<p>be considered an Occupying Power with responsibility for providing ‘public order </p>
<p>and safety, while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the </p>

<p>beyond these instruments.”</p>

<p>297</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“the flexibility to decide … the degree of co-operation with combatant military </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>676. </b> It is not clear whether that advice was seen by Ms Short.</p>
<p><b>677.  On 28 February, the MOD warned No.10 that the UK was “currently at risk </b></p>
<p><b>of taking on a very substantial commitment that we will have great difficulty in </b></p>
<p><b>sustaining beyond the immediate conclusion of conflict”. Specific concerns </b></p>
<p><b>included:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the extent of practical US support for UK humanitarian assistance;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the absence of an ORHA plan for administering Iraq;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the US expectation that the UK would take on an unsustainable </b></p>
<p><b>commitment in the South-East;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>US decision-making moving so fast that, even though the UK was trying to </b></p>
<p><b>influence US thinking, “UK policy will have largely to be about managing </b></p>
<p><b>the consequences of US decisions that are taken for us”;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the risk that the UK, as an Occupying Power, might be expected to make </b></p>
<p><b>up a significant part of any funding shortfall for reconstruction.</b></p>
<p><b>678.  Lt Gen Garner was reported to be attracted to the idea of abandoning the </b></p>
<p><b>plan to have three ORHA sectors in Iraq in favour of mirroring the seven proposed </b></p>
<p><b>military sectors.</b></p>
<p><b>679. </b> On 28 February, Mr Hoon’s Private Office sent Sir David Manning an update </p>
<p>on military planning.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> The paper was also sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Mr Brown, and to Mr Bowen, but not to DFID. </p>
<p><b>680. </b> Much of the section on post-conflict planning was devoted to US preparations. </p>
<p>The paper stated:</p>
<p>“For the immediate aftermath, most of the planning is now considered to be </p>
<p>complete, but there remains significant effort required to agree how those plans </p>
<p>should be implemented. There are significant outstanding policy issues which </p>
<p>require resolution before the beginning of operations. For the later stages of the </p>
<p>aftermath, planning is also gathering speed (meaning that important policy decisions </p>
<p>are being made now by the US that will dictate the course of the aftermath).”</p>
<p><b>681. </b> The paper stated that CFLCC and ORHA were taking forward planning, but that </p>
<p>there were “important issues of dispute between them”. The UK was “very heavily </p>
<p>engaged in military (CFLCC) planning at a senior level”, with (acting) Maj Gen Whitley </p>
<p>as Deputy Commanding General (Post Hostilities), and had “good visibility” of ORHA </p>
<p>thinking thanks to the embedded UK staff. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> The paper stated that orders for the initial aftermath would issue shortly, setting out </p>
<p>the responsibilities of an Occupying Power. There was also a “superficially impressive” </p>

<p>plan to manage early provision of humanitarian assistance, but “a distinct lack of </p>
<p>planning by the US” on local and national civil administration:</p>
<p>“An initial plan to divide the country in two (largely arbitrary) parts, with Baghdad as </p>
<p>a third entity, may not last the test of time … Garner has now seen the CFLCC ‘7 </p>
<p>sectors’ map and appears attracted to mirroring those for civil administration – but </p>
<p>there is still no concept of how to interact with either current Iraqi civil governance </p>
<p>structures … or the military divisions. This might be an area where [the] UK can </p>
<p>provide some useful guidance.”</p>
<p><b>683. </b> The paper listed several UK concerns:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Humanitarian Assistance/Stability Provision.” The UK plan was “to make </p>
<p>most use of the US humanitarian provision”, but DFID and the UK military had </p>
<p>concerns about the level of practical US support that would be available and </p>
<p>the likely initial absence of NGOs and international organisations. Because of </p>
<p>the block on the deployment of DFID advisers to Kuwait, UK military planning to </p>
<p>cover the gap was going ahead without guidance. The absence of funding was </p>
<p>even more pressing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Roll-out of regional administration.” ORHA had still not thought through the </p>
<p>detail of how it would administer Iraq. There was a risk of giving the impression </p>
<p>of a military occupation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Military lay-down.” It was “absolutely clear” that, of the seven military sectors, </p>
<p>the US expected the UK to take leadership of the South-East. Without Coalition </p>
<p>partners that would be beyond UK capabilities in the “medium term”. The UK </p>
<p>was “<b>currently at risk of taking on a very substantial commitment that we </b></p>
<p><b>will have great difficulty in sustaining beyond the immediate conclusion of </b></p>
<p><b>conflict</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Policy lacunae.” There were still many unresolved details in US planning. </p>
<p>The UK was seeking to influence US thinking, but US decision-making was </p>
<p>moving so fast that “UK policy will have largely to be about managing the </p>
<p>consequences of US decisions that are taken for us”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Funding.” This remained “a great unknown”. US planning assumed the rest </p>
<p>of the world would pick up 75 percent of the bill for reconstruction. That was </p>
<p>“possibly hopelessly optimistic”. As an Occupying Power, the UK would be at the </p>
<p>front of the queue of countries the US would approach to make up any deficit. </p>

<p>our bit.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>The Phase IV task is huge, comparable to the transformation of central </p>
<p>European countries after the fall of the Berlin Wall – beyond what even the </p>
<p>US can manage by itself. We shall need to build a broad coalition. We shall </p>
<p>need more countries to provide peacekeeping forces. We must involve the UN </p>
<p>agencies, other countries and international organisations in reconstructing the </p>

<p>… [I]n order to ease the passage of the second UN Security Council resolution </p>
<p>… there could be advantage in explaining our intention to go for a third </p>
<p>resolution for Phase IV.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>It will take some weeks and months, after securing UN authorisation, to </p>
<p>get a provisional civil administration ready to move to Iraq. So for the initial </p>
<p>post-conflict period, our Coalition forces, supported by Jay Garner’s Office of </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance, will be in charge of Iraq. The </p>
<p>choices we make in those first weeks and months will significantly shape </p>
<p>the future development of Iraq. Then we can hand over the task to the wider </p>
<p>international effort, mandated by the UN.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>We should be absolutely clear that Coalition military forces will remain under </p>
<p>General Frank’s command. </p>
<p>– </p>
<p>I am not starry-eyed about the UN’s management record. I do not propose </p>
<p>that the UN should take over the running of Iraq. But the Security Council’s </p>
<p>authorisation is crucial to building support internationally for our efforts.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>We need to identify a senior international figure (but not a Brit, American or </p>
<p>Australian) who could serve as the Head of Civil Administration.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Our officials have excellent links on the detailed planning for Phase IV. They </p>
<p>should continue to work closely together on the key issues. These include </p>
<p>… how to deal with those closest to Saddam’s regime … and rebutting the </p>
<p>accusation that this is a war about oil …</p>
<p>– </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Has given up its attachment to WMD</p>

<p>“That is a lot to achieve – similar in scale to the post-communist reforms of central </p>
<p>European countries. Success will require huge efforts from the Iraqis themselves </p>
<p>and from the wider international community. The support of countries in the region </p>
<p>will also be critical. We shall need to pull together a large coalition to provide the </p>

<p>Phase IV Alpha. Military administration by CFLCC, then, when conditions permit, </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>constraints placed on the military’s powers to administer Iraq by </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>working with existing Iraqi structures as far as was consistent with the </p>
<p>security of Coalition Forces and the objectives of military action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IV Bravo. In the UK’s view, this would begin as soon as there was a </p>
<p>UN mandated international civil transitional administration (CTA) in place, </p>
<p>supported by UN-mandated Coalition military:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>With a UN mandate it would be possible to increase the number </p>
<p>of countries contributing forces in what could still be an uncertain </p>
<p>environment.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The aim of Phase IV Bravo would be to transform Iraq “along the lines of </p>
<p>the vision”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The UK was still working with the US on possible elements for the CTA’s </p>
<p>composition: “The trick will be to make it sufficiently international and </p>
<p>UN friendly to win the support of the UNSC but not to put the UN in charge </p>
<p>of areas where it has a poor management track record”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The duration of Phase IV Bravo would be determined by the time taken to </p>
<p>draw up a new constitution and to elect a new government. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IV Charlie. Coalition Forces and the CTA would withdraw, but Iraq </p>
<p>would continue to need help restructuring its economy and possibly with public </p>
<p>administration more generally.</p>
<p><b>695. </b> The FCO letter to No.10 also enclosed an outline structure for the interim civil </p>
<p>administration during Phase IV Bravo, which had already been sent to Lt Gen Garner.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The outline stated:</p>
<p>“Once Iraq is stabilised and it becomes possible to move to Phase IVb (recovery), </p>
<p>it would be desirable to transition the Interim Civil Administrative structure to a </p>
<p>more broadly-based structure, authorised by a UN Security Council resolution. That </p>
<p>would enable wide international support, and could make the most of international </p>
<p>experience without hindering effective leadership.</p>
<p>“The structure would be headed by a ‘High Representative’ … ideally a Muslim figure </p>
<p>… Beneath him would be several co-ordinators heading up vertical pillars covering </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance, reconstruction, civil administration and ‘democratisation’. </p>
<p>To assist him in his task, and until such time as the ‘democratisation’ pillar delivered </p>
<p>appropriate constitutional reform and a broadly based, representative system, there </p>
<p>would be an Iraqi Consultative Council. Working alongside him would be a security </p>
<p>co-ordinator who would be responsible for security sector reform and liaison with the </p>
<p>Coalition military commander.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>438</p>
<p><b>696. </b> The thinking behind the vision was expressed most clearly in the draft letter from </p>
<p>Sir David Manning to Dr Rice, which stated that it would be helpful to be able to say </p>
<p>soon how the US and UK saw the government of Iraq after Saddam Hussein: </p>
<p>“Our starting point is that the humanitarian, reconstruction and civil administration </p>
<p>tasks are too complex and too resource intensive for the US and UK to undertake </p>
<p>alone … Most potential contributors … will only feel comfortable participating … if </p>
<p>there is a UN authorising mandate. They will not arrogate to themselves the right to </p>
<p>redesign Iraq, however desirable the end state. And nor would we. We shall need </p>
<p>Security Council authorisation for legal reasons too.”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>697. </b> The draft letter concluded:</p>
<p>“Handing Iraq’s reconstruction over to a UN-authorised CTA will allow us to reduce </p>
<p>our presence in Iraq and leave the country with honour. Indeed, unless we do so, </p>
<p>I am far from convinced that we can succeed in Phase IV.”</p>
<p><b>698. </b> The FCO explained that the draft letter did not refer to the outline for Phase IVb </p>
<p>that had been shared with Lt Gen Garner, “in case David Manning thought it was a </p>
<p>bridge too far, at this stage, to put to Condi Rice”.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>699. </b> The letter appears never to have been sent. When Sir David next wrote to Dr Rice, </p>
<p>on 10 March, it was in the context of work on a draft Security Council resolution.</p>
<p><b>700. </b> The FCO sent a separate draft ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ to No.10 on </p>
<p>28 February. </p>
<p><b>701.  President Bush described the US post-conflict commitment to Iraq in a </b></p>

<p><b>commitment from many nations, including our own: we will remain in Iraq as long </b></p>
<p><b>as necessary, and not a day more”. </b></p>
<p><b>702. </b> In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute on 26 February, described in more </p>
<p>detail in Section 3.7, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“If we must use force, the United States and our Coalition stand ready to help the </p>
<p>citizens of a liberated Iraq …</p>
<p>“We will provide security against those who try to spread chaos … We will seek to </p>
<p>protect Iraq’s natural resources from sabotage by a dying regime, and ensure those </p>
<p>resources are used for the benefit of the owners – the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>“The United States has no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq’s new </p>
<p>government … All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government, and all citizens </p>
<p>must have their rights protected.</p>

<p>our own: we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more. America </p>
<p>has made and kept this kind of commitment before – in the peace that followed a </p>

<p>“There was a time when many said that the cultures of Japan and Germany were </p>

<p><b>UK commercial interests</b></p>
<p><b>703.  UK oil firms had begun to express concern about access to post-Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein oil contracts in the second half of 2002 (see Section 6.4). </b></p>
<p><b>704.  By 27 February, officials were concerned that UK reticence in contacts with </b></p>
<p><b>the US was disadvantaging UK firms across a range of business sectors.</b></p>
<p><b>705. </b> In early 2003, UK companies in other sectors approached Trade Partners UK </p>
<p>(TPUK), the division of British Trade International (BTI) responsible for promoting </p>
<p>UK exports, for advice on business opportunities in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> A number of </p>
<p>companies expressed concern about a repeat of the situation in 1991, when UK firms </p>
<p>lost out heavily to US companies on reconstruction contracts in Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>706. </b> On 12 February Mr Bill Henderson, TPUK Director International Group 1, explained </p>
<p>to Baroness Symons, joint FCO/DTI Minister of State for International Trade and </p>
<p>Investment, that, until early February 2003, UK Government discussion of commercial </p>
<p>opportunities in Iraq had largely been restricted to officials in order “to avoid giving </p>
<p>undue prominence to the commercial aspects of HMG’s handling of the crisis”.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>707. </b> Mr Henderson reported that, on 12 February, he had chaired a meeting with </p>
<p>the FCO, the Export Credit Guarantee Department (ECGD) and, for the first time, a </p>
<p>representative of the British Consultants and Contractors Bureau (BCCB) to discuss </p>
<p>how best to provide assistance to UK companies outside the oil and gas sector. </p>
<p>Mr Henderson expressed concern that “the overall Whitehall agenda appears to attach </p>
<p>little importance to the commercial aspects and the interest of UK companies”. </p>
<p><b>708. </b> The need to secure “a level-playing field for UK business in oil and other areas” </p>
<p>was one of the key messages for the US on post-conflict Iraq, agreed on 11 February. </p>

<p>311</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recommended to Baroness Symons that she agree a “more open, pro-active </p>
<p>approach” to dealing with UK companies. </p>
<p><b>710. </b> Baroness Symons sent that advice to Mr Straw and Ms Patricia Hewitt, Secretary </p>
<p>of State for Trade and Industry, stating that:</p>
<p>“… the pressure from businesses is building and I fear that some of our business </p>
<p>community fear we are not engaged. Some think that the US and France are ahead </p>
<p>of the game already …”</p>

<p><b>712.  The UK ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’, written by the FCO in October </b></p>
<p><b>2002, was revised at the end of February 2003. </b></p>
<p><b>713.  Mr Straw saw its principal value as a means to reassure domestic and Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>public opinion of the UK’s intentions in Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>714.  The ‘Vision’ was a statement of aspirations that assumed a level of </b></p>
<p><b>agreement with the US that did not yet exist on plans for post-conflict Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>715.  The ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ was a separate document to the ‘UK </b></p>
<p><b>Vision for Phase IV’, which is addressed earlier in this Section.</b></p>
<p><b>716. </b> On 27 February, Mr Straw discussed the draft ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi </p>
<p>People’, originally prepared by FCO officials in October 2002 (see Section 6.4), with </p>
<p>Mr Campbell.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> The draft had been shown to the AHGI on 11 October 2002, when it had </p>
<p>been decided that the paper should “remain in reserve”.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>717. </b> Mr Straw believed that “public commitment on the lines of the draft could have </p>
<p>a powerful impact in Iraq and the region as well as on the British domestic debate”. </p>
<p>The ‘Vision’ should not be launched or trailed until the UN had voted on the second </p>
<p>resolution because of the risk that it would be presented as “discounting” the role of the </p>
<p>Security Council. Care would also be needed to avoid confusing the message that the </p>
<p>justification for military action rested firmly on disarmament of WMD.</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Mr Straw thought it essential that the UK, US and “other Coalition members” spoke </p>
<p>to a common script. That underlined the importance of making progress with the US on </p>

<p>with US policy” as set out in President Bush’s speech, “elements … go further than the </p>
<p>US has so far done in public or, on some issues including UN involvement, in private”.</p>
<p><b>719. </b> The FCO sent No.10 the latest draft of the ‘Vision’, which had been seen by </p>
<p>officials in the MOD, Cabinet Office, Treasury and DFID, explaining that work was </p>
<p>in hand to ensure coherence with military campaign objectives already agreed by </p>
<p>Ministers.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>720. </b> The new version expanded the criticism of Saddam Hussein, added a reference </p>
<p>to the military consequences should he refuse to co-operate with the UN and inserted </p>
<p>two references to “democratic government” in place of the previous version’s single </p>
<p>reference to “democratic principles”.</p>
<p><b>721. </b> The new description of overall aims explained that:</p>
<p>“Our aim is to disarm Saddam of his weapons of mass destruction, which threaten </p>
<p>his neighbours and his people. Our presence in Iraq if military action is required </p>
<p>to secure compliance with UN resolutions will be temporary. But our commitment </p>
<p>to support the people of Iraq will be for the long term. The Iraqi people deserve </p>
<p>to be lifted from tyranny and allowed to determine the future of their country for </p>
<p>themselves. We pledge to work with the international community to help the Iraqi </p>
<p>people restore their country to its proper dignity and place in the community of </p>
<p>nations, abiding by its international obligations and free from UN sanctions.”</p>
<p><b>722. </b> The five principal aims remained unchanged from the October paper:</p>

<p>“Freedom”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Good Government”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“International Respect”;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Prosperity”.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> The list of ways in which the UK/Coalition would help was also largely unchanged, </p>
<p>offering support with:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an early end to sanctions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s reintegration into the region;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>renewal of international education and cultural links; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>institutional and administrative reform.</p>
<p>There were three additions to the October 2002 list:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring the military campaign was as swift and carefully targeted as possible; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working with the UN and the international community to meet emergency </p>
<p>humanitarian needs; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enabling Iraqis “to establish their own democratic government as quickly as </p>
<p>possible” and encouraging UN involvement in the process.</p>
<p><b>724. </b> Mr Bowen commented on the draft on 4 March.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> He suggested that, in addition </p>
<p>to drawing on wording in the military campaign objectives, the draft could:</p>
<p>“… reflect more closely how we would wish post-Saddam Iraq to be governed … We </p>
<p>are also concerned about the extent to which the document implies responsibility for </p>
<p>Iraq’s future being largely the UK’s rather than that of the international community.” </p>
<p><b>725. </b> Specific recommendations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>replacing the reference to an “independent and democratic Iraq” with “an Iraq </p>
<p>with effective and representative government”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extensive redrafting of the section on UK/Coalition support in order to distinguish </p>
<p>between the Coalition contribution “in the immediate wake of conflict” and what </p>
<p>“we” and the international community, working with the Iraqi people, would do </p>
<p>within months of the conflict.</p>
<p><b>726. </b> Mr Hoon endorsed Mr Bowen’s proposed redraft, commenting that “it would be </p>
<p>useful in terms of credibility to be able to set out our vision in the more specific text … </p>
<p>recognising that this may add to the challenge of reaching agreement with the US”.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Both sets of comments were copied to No.10.</p>
<p><b>728. </b> A revised version of the ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ was sent to No.10 on </p>
<p>15 March, the day before the Azores Summit. It incorporated Mr Bowen’s proposal to </p>
<p>replace “democratic” with “effective and representative government”, but did not reflect </p>
<p>his broader recommendation for extensive redrafting. </p>
<p><b>729.  On 27 February, the British Embassy Washington reported that the US was </b></p>

<p><b>730. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported the outcome of a call on ORHA and the </p>
<p>NSC by Dr Brewer on 27 February. Thinking on the UN was evolving. The US accepted </p>
<p>it would need technical help with humanitarian and reconstruction work and was showing </p>
<p>growing acceptance of an international civilian administrator backed by a UN mandate, </p>
<p>but remained opposed to a direct reporting line to the UN.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>731. </b> Separately, the Embassy suggested giving more support to ORHA. It would </p>
<p>be vital to the long-term success of UK action in Iraq and any assistance would be </p>
<p>“gratefully received and effectively used”. So far three staff had been provided, including </p>
<p>Maj Gen Cross. That was “a drop in the bucket”. The Embassy suggested staff already </p>
<p>earmarked for posting to Baghdad might be one source.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>732. </b> The secondment of UK officials to ORHA is addressed in Section 15.</p>
<p><b>733. </b> Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell on 3 March (see Section 3.7). He reported </p>
<p>to No.10 that, in the context of a discussion about the lack of serious planning for </p>
<p>post-conflict, he had told Secretary Powell that, “whilst the US Administration had to be </p>
<p>the best judge of its long term interests”, he “thought it would reap a whirlwind if it failed </p>
<p>to secure legitimacy for what it was doing in respect of Iraq. We were not there yet.”</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>734.  By 4 March, senior members of the US Administration were said to have </b></p>
<p><b>accepted the need for a Security Council mandate, a role for the UN after the initial </b></p>
<p><b>military occupation and the need for a UN Special Co-ordinator.</b></p>
<p><b>735. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, reported </p>
<p>overnight on 3/4 March that senior members of the US Administration had accepted the </p>
<p>need for a Security Council mandate, a role for the UN after the initial military occupation </p>
<p>and the need for a UN Special Co-ordinator, although there were differing views over </p>
<p>how the UN figure would relate to an Iraqi Interim Council.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> The US hoped to organise </p>
<p>a “Bonn Conference” on the Afghan model, four to six weeks after the invasion, involving </p>
<p>external opposition figures and tribal leaders from inside Iraq. The conference would </p>
<p>produce an administrative council, which would gradually take on authority over a period </p>
<p>of months as it moved Iraq towards elections or a constituent assembly. Mr Brenton </p>
<p>reported that he had underlined to the US the UK’s wish to see a structure which brought </p>
<p>international legitimacy and buy-in, and had expressed “polite scepticism” about the </p>
<p>qualities of those members of the external opposition best known to the UK. </p>

<p>4 March.</p>

<p> In his covering minute to Lt Gen Reith, he explained that the Directive was </p>
<p>being issued in draft form for planning and guidance purposes only. It was to be read </p>
<p>on the clear understanding that no political decision had yet been taken on combat </p>
<p>operations, but “events could move very fast”. Lt Gen Reith’s focus would be to work </p>
<p>closely with US commanders “on all aspects of potential operations in support of </p>
<p>Phases III and IV”. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> The Directive itself was addressed to the Commander Joint Operations (Lt Gen </p>
<p>Reith) and listed three objectives “in Support of the UK’s Higher Political Intent:</p>
<p>(1)  Support efforts of humanitarian organisations to mitigate the consequences </p>
<p>of hostilities.</p>
<p>(2)  Facilitate international efforts for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p>(3)  Contribute to the preservation of the territorial integrity of Iraq and the wider </p>
<p>regional security …”</p>
<p>327</p>
<p><b>746. </b> A number of specific tasks were linked to those objectives, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Protect, and be prepared to secure, essential Iraqi political, administrative and </p>
<p>economic infrastructure from unnecessary destruction in order to reassure the </p>
<p>Iraqi people and facilitate rapid regeneration.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Deter opportunistic inter-ethnic and inter-communal conflict.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Within available resources, be prepared to support humanitarian efforts to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>446</p>
<p><b>748.  Lt Gen Reith presented two papers to the Chiefs of Staff on 4 March </b></p>
<p><b>advocating an expanded combat role for UK forces. He advised that the </b></p>
<p><b>implications for Phase IV should be a consideration. </b></p>
<p><b>749.  Mr Hoon and the Chiefs of Staff agreed that the UK should not actively seek </b></p>
<p><b>a wider role, but should be ready to consider any unsolicited US requests on </b></p>
<p><b>their merits. Implications for Phase IV operations would be one of a number of </b></p>
<p><b>considerations.</b></p>
<p><b>750. </b> On 4 March, Lt Gen Reith sent the Chiefs of Staff two papers setting out proposals </p>
<p>for employing UK land forces on combat missions with or without “a dedicated ‘UK </p>
<p>box’” based on “the agreed 1 (UK) Div AO”. The papers are described in more detail </p>
<p>in Section 6.2.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>751. </b> Lt Gen Reith explained that a UK box would “allow UK forces to move first in </p>
<p>a ground offensive and thereby set the conditions for the ‘exemplary performance’ </p>
<p>in Phase IV”, but US resistance to the creation of a UK box would “probably only </p>
<p>be overcome by high level intervention”. </p>
<p><b>752. </b> In the first of the two papers, Lt Gen Reith addressed the advantages and </p>
<p>disadvantages of “UK ownership of its full AO from the start”. Under the existing Base </p>
<p>Plan, the UK AO would expand into space vacated by US forces as they moved north </p>
<p>and UK forces would not be able to shape their own Phase IV AOR. Lt Gen Reith </p>
<p>explained that one of the contingency plans already worked up by the Land Component </p>
<p>Command (LCC) assumed full UK ownership of its AO from the start. There could be </p>
<p>“no doubt at all that this represents a far better option for UK forces than the Base Plan”. </p>
<p><b>753. </b> In the second paper, Lt Gen Reith explained that his forthcoming meetings </p>
<p>with Lt Gen McKiernan and others would “almost certainly be the last chance that </p>
<p>the operational commanders will have to discuss the plan face to face before ground </p>
<p>operations commence”. US commanders were likely to press him on UK land </p>
<p>contributions beyond the provisions in the Base Plan. </p>
<p><b>754. </b> Lt Gen Reith put forward two options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“National focus with limited operational exposure.” The Base Plan, involving </p>
<p>“operations within the AO as presently defined, concentrating on making </p>
<p>the early transition from Phase III to Phase IV, with an end state defined as </p>
<p>‘exemplary performance’ in Phase IV within Basra region”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Coalition focus with unconstrained operational exposure.” Among the </p>
<p>disadvantages of this approach was a reduction in the number of troops </p>

<p>to produce exemplary early effect during Phase IV”. </p>
<p><b>755. </b> Lt Gen Reith concluded:</p>
<p>“US commanders are likely to press on branch planning and UK land contributions </p>
<p>beyond the provisions of the Base Plan.</p>
<p>“The situation is changing: the potential for a UK box remains my aspiration but </p>
<p>is in practical terms receding …</p>
<p>“In discussing the campaign, and subject to their [the Chiefs of Staff] agreement, </p>
<p>CJO will balance the desire to husband our land forces for Phase IV in our own </p>
<p>AO, against the possible Coalition requirement to take a greater part of the Phase </p>
<p>III effort, with the risks this implies in terms of the ease with which we transition to </p>
<p>Phase IV.”</p>
<p><b>756. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the papers on 5 March.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> They rejected the proposal </p>
<p>for a UK box. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> In Lt Gen Reith’s absence, Maj Gen Fry sought guidance from the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on offering “UK ‘niche’ contributions beyond the provisions of the Base Plan” in the </p>
<p>context of the requirement to deliver an exemplary Phase IV. </p>
<p><b>758. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that delivering an exemplary Phase IV required “the </p>
<p>concomitant resources and OGD [other government department] commitment”. </p>
<p>Adm Boyce stressed that Phase IV could not be delivered by military activity alone.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> Adm Boyce directed Lt Gen Reith to “push for a ‘niche’ role for the UK … and </p>
<p>make it clear that the UK was ready to be asked to contribute further in order to exploit </p>
<p>any operational opportunities that arose during the campaign”, subject to US logistics </p>
<p>support and assurances that UK forces would be “relieved-in-place” as soon as possible </p>
<p>for Phase IV activities in the South. </p>
<p><b>760. </b> Mr Watkins informed Sir David Manning on 6 March that Mr Hoon and the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff judged that “it would not be wise at this late stage to seek a major revision to the </p>
<p>US plan”, but that the plan could make better use of some of the niche capabilities in </p>
<p>1 (UK) Division.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> Mr Hoon had agreed that the UK should encourage US commanders </p>
<p>to identify a niche role. The US was looking at a number of variations to its plan, </p>
<p>including involving 7 Armoured Brigade in “decisive manoeuvre operations beyond </p>
<p>south-eastern Iraq” and “possibly in a decisive phase around Baghdad”. That would </p>
<p>raise a number of issues, including for post-conflict operations.</p>

<p>Mr Rycroft informed the FCO that Mr Blair considered it important that there was </p>

<p><b>768. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet on 6 March that he had agreed with President Bush on the </p>

<p>333</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>769. </b> Points made in discussion included that the reconstruction of Iraq would require a </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting on post-conflict issues, 6 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>770.  Before Mr Blair’s meeting on humanitarian and other post-conflict issues </b></p>
<p><b>on</b> <b>6 March, the UK remained without an agreed approach to humanitarian relief. </b></p>
<p><b>771.  On 5 March, PJHQ warned the MOD that DFID had indicated that it would </b></p>
<p><b>focus its humanitarian effort on areas of Iraq with the greatest need and not </b></p>
<p><b>necessarily the UK’s AO. </b></p>
<p><b>772. </b> On 5 March, PJHQ alerted the MOD to its concerns about provision of </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance in a UK AO in the immediate aftermath of conflict.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> PJHQ </p>
<p>advised that it had planned to “piggy-back” on US arrangements, but it was now </p>
<p>apparent that the US plan depended heavily on the provision of funding to international </p>
<p>organisations (IOs) and NGOs. Those organisations were unlikely to be present in the </p>

<p>first weeks after any conflict. PJHQ had also assumed that DFID would be responsible </p>
<p>for providing humanitarian assistance. Dr Brewer’s letter of 24 February to Mr Bowen </p>
<p>suggested that DFID believed that the most effective way to distribute humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance was through IOs and NGOs, and that they would focus their resources </p>
<p>on areas of greatest need (rather than necessarily on the UK’s AO). PJHQ estimated </p>
<p>that between £30m and £50m a month for two months would be required to cover the </p>
<p>provision of humanitarian assistance in the UK AO in the immediate aftermath of any </p>
<p>conflict. </p>
<p><b>773.  Ms Short informed Mr Blair that, without resources greater than her </b></p>
<p><b>department’s entire contingency reserve, “it would be impossible for DFID to take </b></p>
<p><b>a leading role in humanitarian delivery in the South-East” of Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>774. </b> Ms Short held a meeting with DFID officials to discuss Iraq, and in particular the </p>
<p>legality of “reconstruction work” without a covering UN mandate, on 5 March.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> Ms Short </p>
<p>concluded that without a clear mandate for reconstruction, DFID could only legally fund </p>
<p>or undertake humanitarian work. The meeting agreed that:</p>
<p>“… under circumstances where DFID would be involved in humanitarian work </p>
<p>only, DFID’s contingency reserve could be drawn upon. This might provide around </p>
<p>£60-65m. In the event that a wider DFID role was possible, should we be asked by </p>
<p>No.10 or others how much funding DFID would need, we should mention an initial </p>
<p>sum of £100m.” </p>
<p><b>775. </b> Ms Short also agreed the need to:</p>
<p>“… move away from any expectation that DFID would undertake an ‘exemplary’ </p>
<p>role, or … focus exclusively on any one area. This decision was taken on the basis </p>
<p>that there would be substantial need elsewhere in Iraq other than simply in the </p>
<p>South East; that the extent of our involvement would not be clear for some time, </p>
<p>as the different variables affecting it fell into place; and that we needed to avoid </p>
<p>being so closely associated with one area that we were seen as the ‘donor of last </p>
<p>resort’, for all unfunded needs. However, we should make clear that, given the right </p>
<p>UN mandate and authority, we would aim to work alongside the UK military, as well </p>
<p>as elsewhere, with others, as appropriate.”</p>
<p><b>776. </b> Ms Short said that she would use Mr Blair’s meeting on 6 March to press him to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>examine carefully the legality of different post-conflict options for the UK;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>press the US on the need for “sufficient preparation” before any conflict began; </p>
<p>and</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>777. </b> Ms Short set out her views in a letter to Mr Blair before the meeting:</p>
<p>“… the reconstruction of Iraq without an explicit UN mandate would breach </p>
<p>international law. Without the UN mandate the Coalition would be an occupying </p>
<p>army with humanitarian duties under the Geneva Convention, but – like the Israelis </p>
<p>in the Occupied Territories – without any rights to change institutional arrangements. </p>
<p>The UN is clear that without the right mandate they could only respond to immediate </p>
<p>humanitarian needs. My understanding is that the US has not yet accepted all our </p>
<p>arguments on the UN role. Unless they do, DFID could do no more than support </p>
<p>UN humanitarian efforts, and few others would be willing to engage.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“You should be aware that the US and the international humanitarian community </p>
<p>are not properly prepared to deal with the immediate humanitarian issues. Visits </p>
<p>to Washington suggest that the newly created US Office for Reconstruction </p>
<p>and Humanitarian Assistance is well led but under-staffed, under-resourced and </p>
<p>under-prepared for the scale of the challenge …</p>
<p>“But the US is improving its humanitarian preparedness daily. A little more time </p>
<p>would make the US much better able to deal with some of the humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences of conflict. My department is doing what we can to advise the UK </p>
<p>military on preparations for delivering humanitarian assistance including in the </p>
<p>initial absence of the UN and most international NGOs. We too could also be better </p>
<p>prepared given more time. </p>
<p>“You must also be aware that without resources larger than my whole contingency </p>
<p>reserve – just under £100m – it would be impossible for DFID to take a leading role </p>
<p>in humanitarian delivery in the South-East …”</p>

<p><b>lines sought by the UK would be forthcoming, Mr Blair stated that planning for </b></p>

<p><b>786.  DFID and the MOD remained unable to agree a joint approach to UK </b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian operations in the area likely to be occupied by UK forces.</b></p>
<p><b>787. </b> After Cabinet on 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post-conflict issues </p>
<p>with Mr Brown, Mr Hoon, Ms Short, Baroness Symons, Sir Michael Jay and “other </p>
<p>officials”.</p>
<p>337</p>
<p><b>788. </b> The IPU prepared an annotated agenda in consultation with other departments.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>789. </b> With the invasion possibly only weeks away, the IPU explained that US and UK </p>
<p>planning assumed that, in the “medium term after the conflict”, Coalition Forces would </p>
<p>be “re-deployed into six or seven geographical sectors in order to provide a secure </p>
<p>environment for the civil transitional administration to conduct humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>and reconstruction work”. The US expected the UK Division in Iraq to be responsible for </p>
<p>a geographical sector (see Section 6.2), which would be very expensive and carry wider </p>
<p>resource implications. The UK Division would probably be based in or near Basra, with </p>
<p>the size of its AOR depending on a number of factors, including the permissiveness of </p>
<p>the environment and the size of the Division in relation to the rest of the Coalition. </p>
<p><b>790. </b> The annotated agenda stated: “Ministers need urgently to take a view on this </p>
<p>before the military planning assumptions become a fait accompli.” Ministers were asked: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether they agreed that the UK did not have the resources to make an </p>
<p>“exemplary” effort in providing for basic humanitarian needs in the area </p>
<p>controlled by a UK Division. The potential cost of making a “significant </p>
<p>difference” in a UK AO likely to contain 20 percent of Iraq’s population was </p>
<p>estimated at between US$400m and US$2.4bn for the first year, depending on </p>
<p>disruption to OFF and the extent of the damage caused by conflict. That was </p>
<p>“well beyond” the financial and implementing capacity of DFID and the MOD, </p>
<p>and could become a significant medium-term commitment if the local population </p>
<p>became dependent on UK assistance. The alternative to an “exemplary effort” </p>
<p>was to “give our assistance to UN agencies and NGOs”, supplemented by </p>
<p>support for QIPs in the UK’s area.</p>

<p>expected the UK to contribute forces “for the security of a geographic area … </p>
<p>over the medium term”. The IPU considered it “reasonable to assume that a </p>
<p>brigade should be able to manage a single, well-populated province” the size of </p>
<p>Basra, but there were four options available: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a brigade responsible for security in a single province; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a UK divisional headquarters could take responsibility for security, under </p>

<p>Whether to follow the US plan to administer Iraq as a whole and not seek </p>
<p>general UK responsibility for the administration of any geographic area in the </p>
<p>medium term. The US plan was to administer Iraq as a whole from Baghdad, </p>
<p>“which must be right”. In any area where the UK took responsibility for security, </p>
<p>it could, with a UN mandate, also take on wider responsibility for reconstruction </p>
<p>(including humanitarian assistance and aspects of civil administration), but </p>
<p>that would “very likely be beyond the resources of the UK alone and have </p>
<p>implications for domestic departments”.</p>

<p>objectives would be achieved when Iraq had been “radically changed for the </p>

<p>“… any UK involvement in the administration of post-conflict Iraq will necessarily </p>
<p>require a significant civilian administrative and specialist component; this component </p>

<p><b>The success of civil administration will be essential to Iraq’s long term future. </b></p>
<p><b>The UK military cannot do this on their own.</b></p>
<p>“… [T]he current defence planning assumption is that UK forces can only sustain </p>
<p>large scale operations for a period of six months without doing long term damage </p>
<p>to capability. This implies that UK forces reduce to a Medium Scale (i.e. roughly one </p>
<p>brigade) post-conflict TELIC commitment.</p>
<p>“… US planning is currently tending to assume UK involvement in Phase IV at a </p>
<p>level that is the maximum, if not higher than, that we can sustain. <b>If Ministers wish </b></p>
<p><b>to set limits on the UK’s Phase IV contribution they should be set now so that </b></p>
<p><b>US planning can be adjusted </b>…</p>
<p>“… [A]s US planning stands, the UK will need substantial support from other nations. </p>
<p>There are no arrangements yet in place formally to gather such support. Such </p>
<p>support will be largely contingent on a suitable second/third UNSCR and a UN </p>
<p>mandate for the occupation of Iraq. The FCO need to build on their recent ‘market </p>

<p><b>795. </b> Mirroring the urgency expressed in the IPU annotated agenda, the MOD warned </p>
<p>that, in the absence of settled UK policy on the scale or duration of the UK contribution </p>
<p>to post-conflict Iraq, that contribution risked being determined “by decisions being taken </p>
<p>by CENTCOM now”.</p>
<p><b>796. </b> The MOD identified a number of specific concerns, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US plans envisaged the UK having responsibility for security in one of seven </p>
<p>sectors. The UK had neither agreed formally nor challenged the US assumption. </p>
<p>Nor had other departments scoped what non-military UK contributions could be </p>
<p>sustained. The UK was “<b>currently at risk of taking on an unsustainable task </b></p>
<p><b>if there is no further Coalition contribution to the occupation of Iraq</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the UK did lead a military sector, there was a risk of the UK military </p>
<p>being “intimately involved” in the civil administration, “not a role they would </p>
<p>seek”. There was “<b>a pressing need to identify civil capacity across the </b></p>
<p><b>international civil admin effort, including to support civil administration in </b></p>
<p><b>a UK military sector</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was “<b>carrying some risk of early humanitarian assistance failures </b></p>
<p><b>in the UK AO</b>”.</p>
<p><b>797. </b> The policy considerations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the degree to which the UK wanted to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US, </p>
<p>“a fundamental political judgement … where are the UK’s red lines?”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s attitude to the future of Iraq. “Does the UK wish to become intimately </p>
<p>involved in reconstruction and civil administration? This is not a military task … </p>
<p>but it will both affect and be affected by the level of military engagement. It will </p>
<p>also have significant resource implications, across government.”</p>
<p><b>798. </b> The briefing concluded with a section on the worst case:</p>
<p>“Much of the above is predicated on best-case assumptions for the progress of a </p>
<p>conflict (swift, short and successful), the condition of Iraq post-conflict (infrastructure </p>
<p>not greatly damaged by fighting, limited internecine conflict) and the degree of </p>
<p>international buy-in with civil and military resources, including cash (considerable </p>
<p>and UN endorsed). The Secretary of State may wish to take the opportunity of this </p>
<p>meeting to remind his colleagues that there is at least a credible possibility that none </p>
<p>of these conditions will obtain.</p>

<p>456</p>
<p>“Even if there is a second (and possibly third) UNSCR this is no guarantee of </p>
<p>broad-based international buy-in into Phase IV … [T]here is a real possibility </p>
<p>of the UK (along with the US and a few forward leaning smaller military nations) </p>
<p>being committed to Phase IV engagement without international burden sharing </p>
<p>and without an immediate exit strategy. At its worst this could expose the UK to </p>
<p>an enduring Large Scale military commitment (20-30,000 in theatre) – <i>and</i> the </p>
<p>commensurate civil support required to contribute to the rebuilding of Iraq … The </p>
<p>potential consequences are severe … This is not the most likely risk, but it is one </p>
<p>that increases the further the outcome post-conflict is from a UN-mandated solution.”</p>
<p><b>799. </b> In a speaking note for Mr Hoon, officials highlighted concerns about the tendency </p>
<p>of discussion of the post-conflict phase, and the IPU annotated agenda, to focus on the </p>
<p>military contribution:</p>
<p>“A military presence will be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for success </p>
<p>in Iraq. <b>A large, organised and properly funded humanitarian assistance plan </b></p>
<p><b>(supported by DFID) is needed from the outset.</b></p>
<p>“… The UK should identify now what civil contribution it will make to rebuilding </p>
<p>in Iraq and consider the cross-Government resource consequences.</p>
<p>“We must not shy away from the fact that there remains a very credible worst case </p>
<p>scenario that we shall want to proceed without either a second UNSCR or wider </p>
<p>international practical support. The possible implications of this for the UK, across </p>
<p>the board, are severe …</p>
<p>“We should put in hand detailed work to consider these implications and ways </p>
<p>of mitigating possible effects.”</p>
<p><b>800.  The record of the meeting on 6 March shows that Mr Hoon raised the </b></p>
<p><b>question of DFID/MOD co-ordination. There is no indication that Ministers </b></p>
<p><b>discussed the wider issues raised by MOD officials.</b></p>
<p><b>801. </b> Mr Cannon told Mr Blair that Ministers needed to make progress on three </p>
<p>interlinked issues: the humanitarian response; the UN mandate; and whether the UK </p>
<p>should “take over control of” a geographical sector in Iraq.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> Mr Cannon explained:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Short’s demands for additional UN cover and funding had left the military </p>
<p>concerned that the job of securing Basra might be compromised by lack of </p>
<p>DFID advance planning. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reports from Washington indicated the US had “moved a long way” on the </p>
<p>UN mandate.</p>

<p><b>802. </b> At the meeting on 6 March, Ms Short repeated her concerns about the need for a </p>
<p>UN mandate.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> She also stated that DFID humanitarian advisers had been deployed </p>
<p>in support of UK forces and that the DFID contingency fund would prioritise Iraq. The </p>
<p>funding available to DFID would not, however, provide for an exercise on the scale of </p>
<p>Kosovo.</p>
<p><b>803. </b> Mr Brown commented that the military operation would be very costly. Estimates </p>
<p>for a major humanitarian operation were running at US$1.9bn to US$4bn. The burden </p>
<p>of reconstructing Iraq should not be borne by just the US and the UK; other countries </p>
<p>and the EU should contribute. In the long term, Iraq’s oil should fund the country’s </p>
<p>reconstruction. Mr Brown was particularly concerned that UK funds should not be used </p>
<p>to repay Iraq’s debts to Germany, France and Russia. </p>
<p><b>804. </b> Mr Hoon warned that a humanitarian crisis “could cause operational problems for </p>
<p>the military and expose us to public criticism”, underlining the need for joint DFID/MOD </p>
<p>planning.</p>
<p><b>805. </b> The record stated:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister concluded that:</p>
<p>(a)  DFID and MOD should draw up a plan for immediate humanitarian action in the </p>
<p>Area of Operations of British forces.</p>
<p>(b)  Planning for medium-term post-conflict action should continue on the </p>
<p>assumption that a UN mandate (the ‘third/fourth resolutions’) would be </p>
<p>forthcoming. The FCO should draft the necessary resolutions, which we should </p>
<p>share with the US. The FCO should prepare a Phase IV plan with other </p>
<p>departments, including the key decisions for Ministers to take.</p>
<p>(c)  The Chancellor should draw up a funding plan, including securing funding from </p>
<p>wider international sources …</p>
<p>(d)  The Prime Minister was prepared to pursue with President Bush our need for a </p>
<p>UN mandate for a post-conflict administration.”</p>
<p><b>806. </b> Mr Blair also stated that sectorisation would need to be addressed and should be </p>
<p>covered in the Phase IV plan.</p>

<p><b>809.  The plan stated that the US was leading on Phase IV planning and that UK </b></p>

<p><b>810.  It listed three sets of decisions that Ministers needed to take either </b></p>
<p><b>immediately, before the conflict began or very soon after the start of hostilities. </b></p>
<p><b>811.  The plan contained little detail on post-conflict tasks and no new material </b></p>
<p><b>on</b> <b>sectorisation, but warned:</b></p>
<p><b>“… we need to be clear that if we take on leadership of a military sector, </b></p>
<p><b>previous deployments of this type suggest that we are likely to inherit wider </b></p>
<p><b>responsibilities than purely security.”</b></p>
<p><b>812.  Officials recommended postponing decisions on the extent of the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict commitment until after the start of hostilities. </b></p>
<p><b>813. </b> The ‘UK overall plan for Phase IV’ was shown to Mr Blair on 7 March.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> Much of </p>
<p>the plan, prepared by the IPU, was drawn from the annotated agenda prepared for the </p>

<p><b>814. </b> A letter from Mr Straw’s Private Office stated that the plan was:</p>
<p>“… work in progress. A full plan could say quite a lot more about the shape of civilian </p>
<p>government, the treatment of war criminals and other matters, most of which we are </p>
<p>working on.”</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>815. </b> The IPU described Phase IV as “the military term for the part of the plan that takes </p>

<p>Coalition forces enter Iraq.”</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>816. </b> The plan stated: </p>
<p>“The US is leading on post-conflict or Phase IV planning. The military part in this is </p>
<p>being led by CENTCOM’s Land Component Headquarters, and the civil piece by its </p>
<p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA). We have military </p>
<p>officers and officials seconded to both. They are well placed to influence planning. </p>
<p>The UN is also carrying out contingency planning. We are tracking that as well. </p>

<p>And UK forces are likely to be the first to confront this.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Of equal urgency is the need <b>to ensure our humanitarian relief effort is </b></p>
<p><b>in place</b>. The scale of the UK effort for humanitarian operations depends on </p>
<p>assessed need and the expected contributions of others. <b>Ministers will need to </b></p>
<p><b>agree this</b>.” Issues of concern included: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the absence of detailed US plans for humanitarian operations;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the impact on UK planning of uncertainty about the legitimacy of military </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the dependence of some DFID plans on further financing decisions; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>UK forces’ lack of funding and capacity to fulfil their humanitarian </p>
<p>obligations in the absence of other providers.</p>
<p>The UK military needed resources for humanitarian assistance to reduce the risk of </p>
<p>humanitarian disaster. Ms Short and Mr Hoon needed “<b>to agree on the modalities</b>”. </p>
<p><b>818. </b> Before the conflict began, there needed to be agreement with the US on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Security Council resolution allowing OFF to continue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An “<b>authorising UNSCR for Phase IV</b>”. The agreement should be announced </p>
<p>“to encourage/galvanise the international community to advance their own </p>
<p>preparations”. US policy was “moving in our direction but still has some way to </p>
<p>go”. The UK needed to:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>work with the US to identify and define the role of the head of the interim </p>
<p>civilian administration; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“push US thinking” on an Iraqi consultative council towards arrangements </p>
<p>visibly inclusive of all segments of the population. Getting the right political </p>
<p>framework was “crucial” given that the initial period of Phase IV would be </p>
<p>perceived as a military occupation and that “the work done during the first </p>
<p>weeks and months will shape the mould for what follows”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Objectives for the day power was handed back to Iraq (as set out in the </p>
<p>annotated agenda of 5 March). </p>
<p><b>819. </b> Very soon after the start of hostilities the UK needed “<b>to agree what our </b></p>
<p><b>medium-term contribution to Iraq should be (say from the autumn onwards). </b></p>
<p><b>For this will shape our conduct in the short term.</b>” Sectorisation would be a key </p>

<p><b>829. </b> The IPU paper on oil policy had been shown to Mr Straw on 28 February.</p>

<p>Mr Chilcott described it as “preliminary, official-level thinking”, incorporating comments </p>
<p>from a range of departments. He explained to Mr Straw that the IPU intended to share </p>
<p>the paper with the US “in due course”. </p>
<p><b>830. </b> In the paper, the IPU judged that it would take “enormous investment over a </p>
<p>number of years” to overcome decades of underinvestment in Iraq’s oil infrastructure. </p>
<p>That work should be a major focus for the international administration, but much of </p>
<p>the initial work would fall to the interim administration. It would be important to ensure </p>
<p>any such moves by the interim administration were “clearly in the interests of the Iraqi </p>
<p>economy and people” and carried out transparently, and that production was “not </p>
<p>pushed beyond OPEC-type depletion rates, even though this could be in the interests </p>

<p><b>831. </b> The IPU saw no reason for a radical overhaul of an industry which was “relatively </p>
<p>well run given the circumstances”. The US had identified individuals in Iraq and the </p>
<p>diaspora who could take on key roles. The UK should do the same. “Winning hearts and </p>
<p>minds” among oil workers and making sure they were paid would be vital. The UK would </p>
<p>want to be seen to help get oil pumping while putting out “robust messages” that it had </p>
<p>no selfish interest in doing so. </p>
<p><b>832. </b> Four types of oil contract needed to be considered: OFF oil purchase contracts, </p>
<p>which should continue with minimal disruption; and new contracts for tackling fires, </p>
<p>investment in new fields and rehabilitation of infrastructure, all of which would need to </p>
<p>be transparent and open to UK firms. It was important to make sure the US kept the UK </p>
<p>Government in the picture.</p>
<p><b>833. </b> As next steps, the IPU recommended the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>convene a meeting with UK oil companies to make use of their expertise;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>obtain the US data on the Iraqi oil sector, including personnel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>carry out detailed research on key oil infrastructure in the UK sector;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hold preliminary discussions with UK firms to ensure they were well placed to </p>

<p><b>DFID update on humanitarian assistance</b></p>
<p><b>844.  A DFID update on humanitarian planning for No.10 on 7 March stated that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>In the event of conflict, DFID would assess the scale of the humanitarian </b></p>
<p><b>need, identify the UN agency best placed to respond and provide </b></p>
<p><b>immediate funding.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>DFID would also be advising the military, to whom immediate </b></p>
<p><b>responsibility for assistance would fall.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Reconstruction plans were less well advanced. DFID’s focus had been on </b></p>
<p><b>ensuring the international community and the US recognised the scale of </b></p>
<p><b>the task and the need for a UN mandate.</b></p>
<p><b>845.  DFID urged Mr Blair to press the case with the US immediately for a </b></p>
<p><b>resolution authorising reconstruction. UK participation in military action should </b></p>
<p><b>be made conditional on such a resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>846.  Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair to engage President Bush on the issue </b></p>
<p><b>the following week, but to focus first on the second resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>847. </b> Mr Blair received a DFID update on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction </p>
<p>planning on 7 March.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> The paper stated that the principle underlying DFID’s </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance was “to provide rapid support to whoever is best placed to meet </p>
<p>the immediate needs of the people”. There was now a DFID staff presence in ORHA and </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div in Kuwait, with further deployments to the region and UN agencies imminent. </p>
<p>£10m had been earmarked for UN and NGO contingency planning and supplies were in </p>
<p>place to provide shelter for up to 25,000 people. DFID would:</p>
<p>“… respond to the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people through supporting the </p>
<p>international humanitarian system, principally the UN, Red Cross/Crescent and key </p>
<p>NGOs to save lives and alleviate suffering. We would be able to allocate up to £65m </p>
<p>from our contingency reserve.”</p>
<p><b>848. </b> In the event of conflict, DFID would assess the scale of the humanitarian need, </p>
<p>identify the UN agency best placed to respond and provide immediate funding for it to </p>
<p>do so, although immediate responsibility for assistance would fall to the military, to whom </p>
<p>DFID would be giving advice.</p>
<p><b>849. </b> The paper stated that reconstruction plans were less well advanced. The focus of </p>
<p>DFID’s work, in collaboration with other government departments, had been “to ensure </p>
<p>the international community, especially the US, realises the enormous scale of the </p>
<p>task and the necessity of a UN mandate”. Uncertainty over that issue was holding up </p>
<p>planning, but DFID had held discussions with the World Bank and other partners. One of </p>

<p>the first tasks would be to put Iraq’s debt on an agreed international footing. DFID would </p>
<p>aim, with the Treasury, “to play a lead role in the IFIs in gaining such an agreement”. </p>
<p><b>850. </b> Dr Brewer sent Sir David Manning supplementary material for Mr Blair to use with </p>
<p>President Bush, which explained the need for a resolution to authorise reconstruction </p>
<p>activity and the financial advantage of having one.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> Dr Brewer explained that the draft </p>
<p>speaking note had been seen by Ms Short, Mr Chakrabarti, Mr Chilcott (in Mr Ricketts’ </p>
<p>absence) and Mr Bowen. She concluded:</p>
<p>“We judge that the time to press our case with the Americans is now: they need to </p>
<p>know how much this matters for us and for the prospects of others engaging in the </p>
<p>reconstruction effort.” </p>
<p><b>851. </b> The suggested points for Mr Blair to put to President Bush included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the constraints on occupying forces in the absence of a resolution expressly </p>
<p>authorising a continued international presence in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the negative impact the absence of a resolution was having on planning by large </p>
<p>parts of the international system.</p>
<p><b>852. </b> The DFID draft included the suggestion that Mr Blair conclude with the statement: </p>
<p>“That apart, I need this UN mandate before I can give the go-ahead.”</p>
<p><b>853. </b> Sir David Manning forwarded Dr Brewer’s letter to Mr Blair on 8 March, with the </p>
<p>comment:</p>
<p>“You will need to engage Bush on this soon – but my view is that we should </p>
<p>concentrate on 2nd Resolution this w/e [the weekend of 8 and 9 March] and start </p>
<p>on the UN heavy lifting on Monday/Tuesday [10 and 11 March].”</p>

<p><b>856.  The Red Team recommended that, if there was any doubt about the </b></p>

<p><b>857. </b> The aim of the second report from the DIS Red Team (‘Obtaining and Retaining </p>
<p>the Support of the Iraqi People in the Aftermath of Conflict’), issued on 7 March, was: </p>
<p>“To identify the optimum structure of the Immediate and Interim Administrations in Iraq </p>
<p>and other measures most likely to obtain and retain the support of the Iraqi people.”</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>858. </b> The Red Team listed six key judgements and three key considerations:</p>
<p><b>“Key judgements:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Internal Iraqi support is likely to be the single most important factor to the </p>
<p>success of the whole operation. After a ‘honeymoon period’, Iraqi support is </p>
<p>likely to become fragile and will depend on the way the early phases of the </p>
<p>military campaign were conducted and the effectiveness of the immediate  </p>
<p>post-conflict administration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Immediate Administration will be established as a ‘belligerent occupation’, </p>
<p>which will require Coalition forces to provide a wide range of administrative </p>
<p>support, as well as maintaining law and order.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The form of the Interim Administration is not yet clear, but in descending order </p>
<p>of acceptability is likely to be:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>UN Assistance Mission with strong US/UK civilian and military contributions.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>US-led civilian administration.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>‘Full blown’ UN administration – on the lines of UNMIK [UN Mission in </p>
<p>Kosovo] or UNTAET [UN Transitional Administration in East Timor].</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The critical success factor from the outset will be the engagement of local </p>
<p>representatives in advisory bodies at national, regional and local level. Iraqi </p>
<p>representation must not be restricted to Iraqi exile bodies.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Opportunities must be taken to hand over administrative responsibility to local </p>
<p>authorities as they become competent and are approved by advisory bodies.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Law and order, including the judicial process, will require special handling and </p>
<p>the retention of executive authority by the Interim Administration.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><b>“Key Considerations.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Fragility of Popular Support</b> … There is likely to be widespread support for </p>
<p>Coalition forces in the immediate aftermath, but it will be extremely fragile. </p>
<p>Retaining support will depend on:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The conduct of the early phases of the campaign …</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Providing food, water, medical assistance and shelter …</p>

<p>UK forces are also obliged to apply the standards of the European Convention </p>
<p>on Human Rights, whereas US forces are not. This could present complications </p>
<p>with respect to the removal of detainees from Iraq, for example.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>These responsibilities remain in force until the Occupation ceases.</p>

<p><b>859. </b> The section of the report on “Post-War Structures” stated that Iraq was “not a </p>
<p>‘failed state’”, nor was it recovering from a bloody civil war. The people were “proud” </p>
<p>and would “respond badly to condescension or perceived insults”. </p>
<p><b>860. </b> On law and order and the judicial system, the Red Team judged that:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>•</p>
<p> </p>
<p>[O]nce an assessment has been made of the effectiveness of local police forces </p>
<p>it should be increasingly possible to include them in military-led law and order </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi judicial system was “largely dysfunctional” and an “interim judicial </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The way the military campaign is run, and the early stages of post-war </p>

<p>as nations would wish to influence a given sector and military commanders would </p>
<p>want clear boundaries for operations and interaction with civil authorities …</p>
<p>“… I judge that, realistically, it will be some time before Coalition partners join US </p>
<p>and British forces in any real strength, if at all. I draw two conclusions from this: </p>
<p>first, that as much as possible of Iraq’s administrative and military structure should </p>
<p>be preserved; and second, that we should beware rapid US drawdown on the </p>
<p>American assumption that UK (perhaps through the ARRC) will form the focus for </p>
<p>an international force that in the event fails to materialise.</p>
<p>“… GOC 1 Div [Maj Gen Brims] made it clear to me that in clarifying his role in </p>
<p>Phase IV, he needed simply to know what his title was, to whom he would be </p>
<p>responsible, and how quickly a civil administrator would be appointed. While he </p>
<p>judges that Basra has adequate short-term food stocks, it will urgently need water, </p>
<p>electricity and medical supplies … Only the ICRC has humanitarian stocks in </p>
<p>position … there was little confidence within 1 Div that DFID has a coherent plan </p>
<p>in place. I support GOC 1 Div’s intent to manage Phase IV with as light a touch as </p>
<p>possible, but it will be important to establish the rule of law quickly – the question, </p>
<p>as in Kosovo, will be whose law? …”</p>
<p><b>867. </b> Gen Jackson concluded:</p>
<p>“We are ready not just to demonstrate solidarity with our Coalition partner, but to </p>
<p>contribute considerable and potentially decisive combat power to achieve rapid </p>
<p>success in Phase III. Rapid success will set the conditions for Phase IV, which </p>

<p>364</p>
<p> UK forces could find themselves in control of part of Iraq, </p>
<p>including Basra, before IOs and NGOs were willing to enter the country. Ms Short’s </p>
<p>agreement that DFID should take part in planning to manage the consequences of war </p>
<p>was welcome, but DFID’s likely plan was to distribute relief wherever there was a need, </p>
<p>not just in the UK AO. There was a danger that, even with DFID engagement, UK troops </p>
<p>would lack the resources to deal with the humanitarian difficulties they faced. Officials </p>
<p>recommended that the only way to be sure UK forces had access to the humanitarian </p>

<p>whether she thought Mr Blair had acted “recklessly”, Ms Short described the situation as </p>
<p>“extraordinarily reckless”. She continued:</p>
<p>“… what worries me is that we’ve got the old spin back and we have detailed </p>
<p>discussions either personally or in the Cabinet and then the spin the next day </p>
<p>is: ‘we’re ready for war’ …</p>
<p>“If it takes another month or so, that is fine … And I think you could get a world </p>
<p>where we see the UN in authority … proper care for the people of Iraq, because at </p>
<p>the moment the preparations to care for the humanitarian aftermath of any military </p>
<p>conflict are not properly in place.</p>
<p>“And there’s another major legal point – if there isn’t a UN mandate for the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>472</p>
<p>DIS REPORT: ‘BASRA: POST SADDAM GOVERNANCE’</p>
<p><b>881.  On 11 March, the DIS reported anecdotal evidence that Iraqi citizens were </b></p>
<p><b>arming themselves as protection against an anticipated breakdown in law and </b></p>
<p><b>order after the removal of Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>882.  The same report identified the Ba’ath Party as Basra’s most important </b></p>
<p><b>administrative institution.</b></p>
<p><b>883. </b> On 11 March, the DIS produced the paper ‘Basra: Post Saddam Governance’.</p>
<p>371</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was the first of a series of DIS reports on southern Iraq and came with the caveat that </p>
<p>much of the content was “necessarily speculative”. </p>
<p><b>884. </b> It is not clear who saw the DIS report, but it seems likely that it would have been </p>
<p>sent to all those, including senior officials in the MOD and the FCO, but not DFID, who </p>
<p>received copies of the Red Team reports. </p>
<p><b>885. </b> The report listed a range of possible local responses to military action, ranging </p>
<p>from reprisals against Ba’ath Party and Security Force personnel to the collapse of </p>
<p>law and order. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> The DIS described the Ba’ath Party as “Basra’s most important administrative </p>
<p>institution”. The local organisation mirrored that of the rest of the country: </p>
<p>“Most party members will have joined for reasons of professional and social </p>
<p>advancement. It can be assumed most prominent members of Basra’s professional </p>
<p>classes (eg senior port officials, heads of local government departments, University </p>
<p>Heads etc.) will be party members. They may however have little role in directing the </p>
<p>party or ensuring regime control.”</p>
<p><b>887. </b> The DIS stated that the “upper echelons … (Director level)” of most Basra </p>
<p>governorate departments, which covered the full range of local administrative functions, </p>
<p>would be members of the Ba’ath Party.</p>
<p><b>888. </b> The DIS advised that there was “very limited reporting on the organisation of Iraq’s </p>
<p>Civil Police. And we have no information specific to Basra.” It added that there was </p>
<p>anecdotal evidence from elsewhere in Iraq suggesting civilians were fearful of a general </p>
<p>breakdown in law and order and were arming themselves. Disarming them “might be </p>
<p>interpreted as running contrary to cultural norms and could be resisted by the civil </p>
<p>populace”.</p>
<p><b>889. </b> Those conclusions were broadly consistent with views expressed in US </p>
<p>intelligence briefings produced in January and March.</p>
<p>371 </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.5  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, January to March 2003</p>
<p>473</p>
<p><b>890. </b> In January 2003, a US National Intelligence Community Assessment had judged </p>
<p>that a post-Saddam Hussein authority in Iraq would face “a deeply divided society with a </p>
<p>significant chance that domestic groups would engage in violent conflict with each other </p>
<p>unless an occupying force prevented them from doing so”.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> The Assessment identified </p>
<p>three divisions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “principal division” between Sunni Arabs, the Shia and the Kurds. Based </p>
<p>on ethnicity and religion, it also had a geographical aspect, with the groups </p>
<p>concentrated in the central, southern and northern regions of Iraq respectively.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Divisions between “tribal identities”. Although 75 per cent of Iraqis identified </p>
<p>with a tribe, many of those would be urban residents who probably felt little </p>
<p>allegiance to their tribal leaders. Many Iraqi tribes were associated with Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein, although for most this was based on self-interest and they could be </p>
<p>expected to seek accommodation with any successor regime.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Divisions between those associated with Saddam Hussein’s regime and its </p>
<p>victims. </p>
<p><b>891. </b> A March 2003 CIA report on the Iraqi police and judiciary provided a general </p>
<p>description of both, but highlighted the lack of information held by the US on local level </p>
<p>officials, including their identities, loyalties and involvement in human rights abuses </p>
<p>under Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> The issue had been a lower intelligence collection </p>
<p>priority than Iraqi WMD, conventional military capabilities and leadership dynamics.</p>
<p>DFID’S HUMANITARIAN STRATEGY AND IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE PLAN</p>
<p><b>892.  DFID produced an outline ‘Humanitarian Strategy and Immediate Assistance </b></p>
<p><b>Plan’ for Iraq on 12 March.</b></p>
<p><b>893.  The paper, prepared for Ms Short, was a statement of DFID’s, rather than the </b></p>
<p><b>UK’s, priorities. It sought to retain “maximum operational flexibility” for DFID in </b></p>
<p><b>the face of continuing uncertainty and limited resources. </b></p>
<p><b>894. </b> On 12 March, DFID officials sent Ms Short DFID’s outline ‘Humanitarian Strategy </p>
<p>and Immediate Assistance Plan’ for Iraq.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> The covering minute explained that the </p>
<p>strategy aimed to address DFID’s key objectives of “saving lives and relieving the </p>
<p>suffering of the Iraqi people whilst adhering to our principles of impartial humanitarian </p>
<p>response. In view of the uncertainties and our limited resources, we are planning to </p>
<p>retain the maximum operational flexibility.” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>895. </b> Officials highlighted three issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK military had an obligation under international law to provide </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. DFID was helping the MOD to plan and prepare for </p>
<p>those responsibilities in the UK AOR, “making it clear that DFID and international </p>
<p>agencies will be focused on the Iraq-wide humanitarian needs”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Until there was a permissive security environment, CHAD-OT remained ready </p>
<p>to deploy, but not immediately to establish a forward base, which might affect </p>
<p>DFID’s ability to respond on the ground in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Planning was based on the assumption that £65m was available for “immediate </p>
<p>response needs”. Given the scale of potential need in Iraq, those funds would be </p>
<p>committed quickly and certainly within the first three months.</p>
<p><b>896. </b> The attached paper stated that the humanitarian strategy was “based on DFID’s </p>
<p>humanitarian principles, which includes seeking the best possible assessment of needs </p>
<p>and giving priority to the most urgent cases of distress”. It listed four aims:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to save lives and relieve suffering;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to respond to immediate humanitarian needs in Iraq and neighbouring countries;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to protect and restore livelihoods; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to support rapid transition from relief to recovery.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p><b>897. </b> The paper explained that policy development and operational planning were </p>
<p>constrained by six factors:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the uncertain military outcome;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the wide range of humanitarian scenarios;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>limited DFID human resources;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>uncertainty over financial resources;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to differentiate between support to Coalition Forces and support to </p>
<p>“traditional humanitarian partners”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a clear DFID security policy in response to the NBC threat.</p>
<p><b>898. </b> The humanitarian strategy would focus on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring co-ordination of the international effort;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working with the UN to maintain OFF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing assistance through the UN, Red Cross and NGOs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the UK military’s stabilisation and relief effort; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>designing humanitarian interventions that take account of longer-term recovery </p>
<p>and reconstruction issues.</p>

<p>“In view of DFID’s limited resources, we will retain <b>maximum flexibility to respond </b></p>
<p><b>to changing scenarios and needs</b>.” It listed seven actions that were planned or </p>
<p>under way:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Information Management”: CHAD-OT staff in Kuwait and Jordan were to collate, </p>
<p>analyse and disseminate field information. DFID was evaluating the need to </p>
<p>send staff to Turkey, Iran and Cyprus, and would retain a limited capacity to </p>
<p>deploy assessment teams to localised crisis points.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Humanitarian Advice/Funding”: CHAD advice in the field and in London to </p>
<p>inform policy and funding decisions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Direct Support to the UN”: secondment of specialists to support the </p>
<p>co-ordination and information activities of the UN’s Humanitarian Assistance </p>
<p>Centre (HIC) and Joint Logistic Centre (UNJLC).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Advice to the Military/Coalition”: two secondees advising 1 (UK) Div and one </p>
<p>official in ORHA, all contributing to DFID’s “information gathering system”, </p>
<p>and a further secondment to the National Component HQ in Qatar under </p>
<p>consideration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Material Support”: DFID’s stockpile of non-food items, vehicles and equipment </p>
<p>brought to immediate readiness, with some elements positioned in Kuwait and </p>
<p>elsewhere in the region.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Direct Implementation”: officials ready to assess and undertake limited relief </p>
<p>and immediate rehabilitation operations through supervised QIPs “implemented </p>
<p>by our traditional partners and possibly the UK military. This could include </p>
<p>building or repairing critical infrastructure required for the humanitarian effort.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Oil-for-Food Programme”: maintaining and protecting OFF or a variant </p>
<p>mandated by the UN.</p>

<p>to engage in detailed planning for humanitarian operations within the UK AO.</p>
<p>377</p>
<p> “As a </p>

<p>brought DFID’s stockpile of non-food items, vehicles and equipment “to immediate </p>
<p>readiness”, was procuring additional supplies and was positioning some of those stocks </p>
<p>in Kuwait and elsewhere in the region. </p>
<p><b>914. </b> Ms Short explained that she had decided to supplement the extra £3.5m </p>
<p>announced on 10 February</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> to support UN humanitarian contingency planning with a </p>
<p>further £6.5m, part of which would support a small number of NGOs in their contingency </p>
<p>preparations. That was in addition to DFID’s ongoing humanitarian programme for </p>
<p>Iraq, expected to amount to £8m in 2002/03, and its regular funding to the UN and </p>
<p>other humanitarian agencies, which included provision for emergency preparedness </p>
<p>worldwide.</p>
<p><b>915. </b> Ms Short announced:</p>
<p>“My Department is also considering the longer term reconstruction and reform </p>

<p><b>Extending the Oil-for-Food programme</b></p>
<p><b>921. </b> Dr Rice gave Sir David Manning an account of White House thinking on the </p>
<p>handling of Iraqi oil on 13 March. The OFF programme should be left in place, but </p>
<p>sanctions lifted to allow Iraq to use the proceeds as it chose. OFF should be phased </p>
<p>out when there was an Iraqi entity ready to take over revenues. The US also wanted </p>
<p>to make clear that military operations would not be paid for out of Iraqi oil money. In </p>
<p>response, No.10 asked the FCO to prepare a note on UK plans for Iraqi oil revenues </p>
<p>for Mr Blair to use in public.</p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>922. </b> On 14 March, the FCO instructed the UK Mission to the UN in New York to </p>
<p>start discussions with the US delegation on a possible resolution to modify the OFF </p>
<p>programme and sanctions regime should military action lead to the absence of an </p>
<p>effective Iraqi government.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>923. </b> The UK position was summarised in the FCO background papers for the Azores </p>
<p>Summit, sent to No.10 on 15 March:</p>
<p>“If the Iraqi regime falls, new arrangements will need to be put in place to enable the </p>
<p>OFF to keep functioning. Our current plan is to table a resolution soon after conflict </p>
<p>starts … We are seeking to amend some of the procedures to speed up the process </p>
<p>for humanitarian goods …</p>
<p>“We would hope that the Secretary-General would be able to transfer full control </p>
<p>over oil revenues to a properly representative Iraqi Government as soon as possible </p>
<p>(not as the US have suggested, an Iraqi ‘entity’, which could, particularly if US </p>
<p>appointed, fuel suggestions that the Coalition was seeking to control Iraqi oil).”</p>
<p>385</p>
<p><b>924. </b> Resolution 1472, adopted unanimously on 28 March, transferred authority for </p>
<p>administering the OFF programme to the UN Secretary-General for a period of 45 days, </p>
<p>with the possibility of further renewal by the Security Council. </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>that members of the external opposition “must have hands-on skills and/or real </p>

<p><b>928. </b> Mr Chaplin agreed with all but the last. He argued that:</p>
<p>“… external oppositionists of any stripe should be free to try their luck back in Iraq. </p>
<p>The Coalition can perhaps judge their skills, but not their political credibility. Only </p>
<p>Iraqis can do that.”</p>

<p><b>932.  On 10 March, the British Embassy Washington reported that the US had </b></p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a UN Special Co-ordinator responsible for UN agencies and reporting to the </p>

<p><b>Presidential approval of US post-conflict plans</b></p>
<p>Between 10 and 12 March, President Bush approved important elements of the US  </p>
<p>post-conflict plan:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a policy of “light” de-Ba’athification that would preserve Iraq’s administrative </p>
<p>capacity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>use of the Iraqi Army as a labour force for reconstruction, but not its </p>
<p>demobilisation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the transfer of governance authority to an Iraq Interim Authority (IIA) with Iraqi </p>
<p>exiles and Kurdish groups at its core, and the Coalition determining the pace at </p>
<p>which power was transferred. </p>
<p>On 10 March, Lieutenant General (retired) Jay Garner, Head of the Office of </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), briefed President Bush on ORHA’s </p>
<p>post-conflict plan, warning that: “a tremendous amount of work was still necessary </p>
<p>to make the inter-agency post-war plans operational”.</p>
<p>403</p>
<p> He identified three priorities: </p>
<p>funding for Iraq’s public service, police and army; the rapid deployment of “international </p>
<p>stability forces” after the fall of Saddam Hussein; and the need to use the Iraqi Army for </p>
<p>reconstruction. The President authorised Lt Gen Garner’s proposal to use the Iraqi Army </p>
<p>“to populate a large labor force for reconstruction efforts”. </p>
<p>The same day, Mr Frank Miller, NSC Senior Director for Defense Policy and Arms Control, </p>
<p>secured President Bush’s agreement to a policy of “light” de-Ba’athification in order to </p>
<p>preserve Iraq’s administrative capacity.</p>
<p>Two days later, on 12 March, Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, </p>
<p>briefed President Bush that the Iraqi Army would not be demobilised. He also proposed </p>
<p>the transfer of power “shortly after Saddam’s fall” to an IIA. Iraqi exiles and Kurdish groups </p>
<p>would become the core of the IIA, working in partnership with the Coalition’s transitional </p>
<p>authority so that Iraqi citizens would have some political control from the outset, with the </p>
<p>Coalition determining the pace at which power was transferred. </p>
<p>President Bush endorsed the plan. <i>Hard Lessons</i> observed that the plan assumed Iraqi </p>
<p>governmental institutions would emerge from the war reasonably intact and that the plan’s </p>
<p>implementation was therefore dependent on the course of the war.</p>
<p>The post-conflict demobilisation of the Iraqi Army is addressed in Section 12.1.</p>

<p>484</p>
<p><b>947. </b> Mr O’Brien and Mr Chilcott discussed post-conflict issues in Washington on </p>
<p>13 March.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> The British Embassy reported that US interlocutors accepted the need </p>
<p>for a “UN badge” for Phase IV and that there was “general agreement that the [UK] </p>
<p>draft [resolution] was 80 percent congruent with the [US] Administration’s position”, </p>
<p>but the US wanted to retain as light a UN touch as possible, with Coalition control over </p>
<p>a Transitional Civilian Administration (TCA) and the IIA. Finding the right UN Special </p>
<p>Co-ordinator would be key. </p>
<p><b>948. </b> The Embassy reported that Mr O’Brien’s US interlocutors had confirmed that the </p>
<p>administration of Iraq would be “uniform”. ORHA would not treat areas controlled by UK </p>
<p>forces differently and there was “no question of food distribution or public sector salaries </p>
<p>stopping at the borders of any British sector”. Although the Ba’ath Party would be </p>
<p>disestablished, “the vast majority of members would need to be left in place”. </p>
<p><b>949. </b> Mr Chilcott stayed in Washington for a second day of talks on 14 March.</p>
<p>405</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Embassy reported that US participants had stated that control over the TCA, and in </p>
<p>particular the IIA, could not be given to a UN Special Co-ordinator and that most of the </p>
<p>tasks the UK assigned to a UN Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) would be carried </p>
<p>out by the Coalition-led TCA. </p>
<p><b>950. </b> The AHGI discussed the UK/US consultations on the role of the UN on 14 March, </p>
<p>before officials in London had seen the report of Mr Chilcott’s second day of talks in </p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p>406</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>951. </b> On 17 March, Mr Dodd reported the AHGI discussion to Sir David Manning:</p>
<p>“There is ‘80 percent agreement’ with the US on the role of the UN. For example, </p>
<p>the US agrees that food distribution and civil service salaries should be organised </p>
<p>nationally. The remaining significant point of difference is whether the transitional </p>
<p>administration should be subordinate to a UN representative. The FCO believe it </p>
<p>unlikely that the UN Security Council will mandate the administration unless it is.”</p>
<p><b>952. </b> Mr Dodd also reported that the IPU was considering how best to approach other </p>
<p>donors for support on Phase IV.</p>
<p><b>953.  Concerns remained about UK companies’ access to reconstruction contracts </b></p>

<p><b>955. </b> On 10 March, Mr Brenton had reported that “a commercial contact” had passed </p>
<p>the British Embassy Washington a version of a USAID invitation to select US companies </p>
<p>to bid for a US$600m contract for infrastructure reconstruction.</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> USAID had confirmed </p>
<p>that the invitation had been issued on 12 February with a closing date of 27 February. </p>
<p>Mr Brenton had pressed for more transparency. </p>
<p><b>956. </b> Mr Brenton also reported that it was not clear how that USAID contract related to a </p>
<p>separate contract “allegedly being let by the US Army Corps of Engineers” and reported </p>
<p>in the UK press on 9 March.</p>
<p><b>957. </b> That contract, the US$7bn contract for “repair work on Iraq’s oil sector” awarded </p>
<p>to US engineering firm KBR, a subsidiary of Halliburton, by the US Army Corps of </p>
<p>Engineers on 8 March, later emerged as the single largest reconstruction contract </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>408</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>958. </b> On 13 March, during his visit to Washington, Mr O’Brien lobbied Mr Andrew </p>
<p>Natsios, USAID Administrator, for UK companies to be awarded reconstruction </p>
<p>contracts.</p>
<p>409</p>
<p> Mr Natsios advised that, for security reasons, USAID had invited only a few </p>
<p>US companies with the necessary clearances to bid for the 17 primary reconstruction </p>
<p>contracts. There were no such constraints on subcontracts, and he hoped that UK </p>
<p>companies and NGOs with the right expertise would be successful in securing those </p>
<p>contracts. In response to a question from Mr O’Brien, Mr Natsios said that it would </p>
<p>be possible for UK companies to acquire the necessary security clearances to bid </p>
<p>for primary contracts.</p>
<p><b>959. </b> Mr O’Brien also lobbied the European Directorate of the NSC on oil contracts.</p>
<p>410</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He accepted that it was reasonable for US companies to be the recipients of DoD money </p>
<p>for emergency contracts to repair damage to oil infrastructure, but the field should be </p>
<p>opened up “once Iraqi money came on stream”. The NSC official agreed.</p>

<p><b>961. </b> No.10 officials updated Mr Blair at his request on 15 March, following press and </p>
<p>Parliamentary interest in UK access to reconstruction contracts and the involvement </p>
<p>of Halliburton.</p>
<p>413</p>
<p> Mr Blair was informed that UK companies would be eligible for </p>
<p>subcontracted work under the US$600m USAID contract and that Mr O’Brien had </p>
<p>agreed to send USAID a list of “trustworthy UK companies”, including those with </p>
<p>experience of contracting for the MOD, which might acquire security clearance to bid for </p>
<p>primary contracts. The briefing note made no mention of the US$7bn oil repair contract.</p>
<p><b>962. </b> Government lobbying on behalf of UK companies and the involvement of UK </p>
<p>firms in post-conflict reconstruction is addressed in Section 10.3.</p>
<p><b>The UK military plan</b></p>
<p><b>963.  On 14 March, Mr Blair approved a proposal to extend the UK’s AO </b></p>
<p><b>northwards during Phase III if commanders on the ground judged it sensible.</b></p>
<p><b>964. </b> Lt Gen Reith sent the Chiefs of Staff an update on military planning options on </p>
<p>10 March (see Section 6.2).</p>
<p>414</p>
<p> The update reflected the Chiefs’ comments on Lt Gen </p>
<p>Reith’s two papers of 4 March and his discussions with senior US commanders between </p>
<p>5 and 7 March. </p>
<p><b>965. </b> Lt Gen Reith recommended that the Joint Command be authorised to operate </p>
<p>north of the current planned UK AO, no further than al-Amara, “on the understanding </p>
<p>that the Division will only exploit forward as far as security and transition to Phase IV </p>
<p>within the current AO allows”.</p>
<p><b>966. </b> Lt Gen Reith outlined the plan to extend the UK AO to the north at the Chiefs of </p>
<p>Staff meeting on 10 March.</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> He stated that the “current UK AO could potentially result </p>
<p>in enemy forces around Basra interfering with Phase IV operations”. There was “a clear </p>
<p>military task to ensure that enemy forces in the areas outside the current UK AO were </p>
<p>unable to interfere with the UK Main Effort”.</p>
<p><b>967. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were “concerned that extending the AO would overstretch </p>
<p>Phase III and Phase IV resources and potentially detract from the Main Effort in the </p>
<p>UK AO”. </p>
<p><b>968. </b> Adm Boyce directed Lt Gen Reith “to proceed with the main effort, of an </p>
<p>exemplary Phase IV, in the original AO (Southern AO) with operations in the Northern </p>
<p>AO as required to achieve a speedy and successful Phase III and to shape Phase IV”. </p>

<p>“Our overriding consideration was for the GOC [Maj Gen Brims] to condition his </p>

<p>circumstances [created by others] …”</p>
<p>416</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting with Mr John Prescott (the Deputy Prime Minister), </p>
<p>Mr Hoon, Lord Goldsmith, Adm Boyce, Sir Andrew Turnbull and No.10 staff on 11 March </p>
<p>to discuss legal and military issues.</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> Mr Straw attended part of the meeting. </p>
<p><b>971. </b> The meeting is addressed in more detail in Sections 3.8 and 6.2. </p>
<p><b>972. </b> The briefing note for Mr Blair stated that the “main purpose of the meeting” was </p>
<p>confirmation of the viability of the overall military plan.</p>
<p>418</p>
<p> Questions for Mr Blair to raise </p>
<p>included whether the US had a “winning concept” and what conditions UK forces should </p>
<p>expect in Basra. </p>
<p><b>973. </b> Adm Boyce told the meeting he was “confident that the battle plan would work”.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>974. </b> Asked about that statement and whether it included the aftermath, Lord Boyce told </p>
<p>the Inquiry: “No, not in that statement.”</p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>975. </b> After the meeting, Mr Watkins sent Sir David Manning an outline of the military </p>
<p>plan for Iraq and advice on decisions needed on the development of the UK’s role (see </p>
<p>Section 6.2).</p>
<p>421</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>976. </b> On the question of the expansion of the UK AO northwards, Mr Watkins explained:</p>
<p>“The US Land Component Commander has … developed a plan that would expand </p>
<p>the UK Area of Operations by up to 150km up to and beyond al-Amara [in Maysan </p>
<p>province] (but short of al-Kut [in Wasit province]) …</p>
<p>“The case for pushing a UK formation northwards will ultimately have to be judged </p>
<p>at the time. Clearly it will depend to some extent on what is happening in the </p>
<p>Basra area. It is also the case that an exemplary Phase IV operation depends on </p>
<p>a satisfactory conclusion to the conflict phase. The Defence Secretary therefore </p>
<p>judges that the senior UK operational commander (the Chief of Joint Operations) </p>
<p>should be authorised to expand the Phase III Area of Operations northwards if </p>
<p>that is required to achieve a satisfactory outcome to Phase III. The focus for the </p>
<p>UK in Phase IV should, however, remain the South-Eastern Area of Operations </p>
<p>as currently understood.”</p>

<p>488</p>
<p><b>977. </b> Mr Watkins reported that Mr Hoon judged that the UK should be “forward-leaning” </p>
<p>on the idea of extending the UK AO north during the conflict phase, “provided that UK </p>

<p><b>979. </b> Mr Blair approved the plan on 14 March.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>980.  The advice on which Mr Blair based his decision was incomplete. </b></p>
<p><b>981.  Mr Hoon stated in January 2003 that credible plans for the aftermath were </b></p>
<p><b>needed before it could be concluded that the overall US plan represented a </b></p>
<p><b>“winning concept”, and that further work was needed on a satisfactory plan for </b></p>
<p><b>the aftermath before the UK committed forces to military action, but he failed to </b></p>
<p><b>press the point further with Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>982.  Mr Hoon’s advice to Mr Blair on military options in October 2002, on the </b></p>
<p><b>shift to the South and the deployment of UK forces in January 2003, and on </b></p>
<p><b>the expansion of the UK’s AO and AOR in March 2003, while recognising the </b></p>
<p><b>significance of the post-conflict phase, offered little analysis of wider, non-military </b></p>
<p><b>implications.</b></p>
<p><b>983.  It was Sir Kevin Tebbit’s responsibility, as PUS, to ensure that military advice </b></p>
<p><b>from Adm Boyce to Mr Hoon was placed firmly in that wider context and reflected </b></p>
<p><b>broader analysis of the UK’s overall obligations, capabilities and strategic </b></p>
<p><b>objectives. </b></p>
<p><b>984. </b> Lt Gen Reith was emphatic about the strategic significance of Phase IV in a paper </p>
<p>on the UK response to the “legal, security and humanitarian assistance demands of </p>
<p>Phase IVa” sent to the Chiefs of Staff on 11 March.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>985. </b> In his covering minute, Lt Gen Reith informed the Chiefs of Staff that “legal </p>
<p>obligations placed on the UK as an Occupying Power will be extensive”. He advised:</p>
<p>“Phase IVa is likely to be the decisive phase of this campaign. This is recognised </p>
<p>by the US and considerable inter-agency planning effort has gone into creating </p>
<p>structures and providing resources to deal with anticipated security and </p>
<p>H[umanitarian] A[ssistance] issues; we can have confidence in these plans. </p>

<p>489</p>
<p><b>986. </b> The paper on the UK response to Phase IVa described Phase IV as “strategically </p>
<p>decisive” and highlighted a number of significant gaps in post-conflict planning: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of a detailed UK/US policy on the role of the military in maintaining </p>
<p>law and order and detaining civilians; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a risk that UK forces would face a humanitarian situation for which they were not </p>
<p>resourced unless there was early agreement that DFID would fund humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance through military channels; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the military was still waiting for the Treasury’s agreement to an initiative for £10m </p>
<p>to be made available to UK forces for QIPs; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of a decision on how or whether the UK would pay Iraqi public </p>
<p>sector salaries.</p>
<p><b>987. </b> The paper included, in full, US definitions of the end state for Phases IVa, b and c:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IVa: “a stable environment in which the territorial integrity of Iraq is </p>
<p>intact; civil order is maintained; repairs to damaged civil infrastructure are under </p>
<p>way; humanitarian assistance is provided by the civilian sector; and an interim </p>
<p>administration is in place”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IVb: “responsibility for stability and security passing from Coalition military </p>
<p>to responsible Iraqi institutions; rule of law is fully established; necessary civil </p>
<p>infrastructure is functioning and economic development is under way; lessening </p>
<p>dependence on humanitarian assistance; and a transitional civil administration is </p>
<p>in place with increasing Iraqi participation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Phase IVc: “a durable, secure and stable Iraq sustained by Iraqis, in which the </p>
<p>rule of law is well established and civil order is maintained by Iraqi authorities; </p>
<p>civil infrastructure is functioning and economic development continuing; </p>
<p>lessened dependence on humanitarian assistance; authority had been </p>
<p>transferred to an Iraqi national government”. </p>
<p><b>988. </b> In the paper, Lt Gen Reith explained that CFLCC had instructed all commanders </p>
<p>to:</p>
<p>“… liaise with and monitor local administrations within their area of responsibility </p>
<p>… but … only to directly intervene in the administrative process when necessary </p>
<p>to maintain public order and safety, or to prevent human suffering. Existing Iraqi </p>
<p>government organisations should be allowed and encouraged to function as normal </p>
<p>and no attempt should be made to reorganise or replace existing structures.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>490</p>
<p><b>Eclipse II – the CFLCC plan for Phase IV</b></p>
<p>The CFLCC plan for Phase IV, known as Eclipse II, was the product of the post-conflict </p>
<p>planning effort led by (acting) Major General Albert Whitley, CFLCC Deputy Commanding </p>
<p>General (Post Hostilities). Eclipse II had close links to CFLCC’s combat operations </p>
<p>planning, but not to broader Washington policy debates.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>After Saddam</i>, the 2008 RAND report for the US Army on US post-conflict planning, stated </p>
<p>that Eclipse II had been through 15 revisions by the middle of March 2003, with the final </p>
<p>draft released on 12 April.</p>
<p>425</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The RAND report concluded that CFLCC “was gaining a realistic appraisal of the </p>
<p>potential security challenges that would confront Coalition forces”, but failed to challenge </p>
<p>military planning assumptions, including the degree to which the remnants of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government would provide essential services and security.</p>
<p>In his written statement to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Whitley explained that Eclipse II was </p>
<p>named after the 1945 US plan for post-war Germany.</p>
<p>426</p>
<p> It was “an attempt to produce </p>
<p>some coherence for the military aspects of Post Hostilities and give subordinate </p>
<p>commands, responsibilities, direction and tasks”. The “tiny” planning team in ORHA </p>
<p>produced the civil mirror image. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Whitley judged that the plan had “some local practical effect”, but was </p>
<p>“inadequate”.</p>
<p><b>989.  On 11 March, at the height of the UK’s effort to secure Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>backing for a second resolution (see Section 3.8), Mr Straw advised Mr Blair of </b></p>
<p><b>the need for a “Plan B” for the military in the event that the Government failed to </b></p>
<p><b>secure a majority in the Parliamentary Labour Party for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>990.  Mr Straw’s Plan B envisaged the UK “taking responsibility for a sector </b></p>
<p><b>and for humanitarian and reconstruction work” in order to make “a major UK </b></p>
<p><b>contribution to the overall campaign” without being directly involved in the </b></p>
<p><b>invasion. </b></p>
<p><b>991.  At that stage, officials were still pressing, without success, for Ministers to </b></p>
<p><b>agree draft objectives for post-conflict Iraq and principles to guide short-term UK </b></p>
<p><b>involvement that could be shared with the US.</b></p>
<p><b>992.  It is not clear whether Mr Straw had discussed the feasibility of his idea with </b></p>
<p><b>others. </b></p>
<p><b>993. </b> On 11 March, Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that he should not go to Parliament </p>

<p>“I am aware of all the difficulties … But I understand that the US could if necessary </p>
<p>adjust their plan rapidly to cope without us. In these circumstances we could </p>
<p>nevertheless offer them a major UK contribution to the overall campaign. In addition </p>
<p>to staunch political support, this would include … as soon as combat operations </p>
<p>are over, full UK participation in the military and civilian tasks, including taking </p>
<p>responsibility for a sector and for humanitarian and reconstruction work. We </p>

<p><b>UK objectives for post-conflict Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>996.  The draft objectives and guiding principles for post-conflict Iraq were </b></p>

<p><b>999. </b> On 12 March, one week before the start of the invasion, Mr Cannon re-submitted to </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1000. </b> One item had been added to the objectives prepared for Mr Blair’s meeting on </p>

<p><b>1002. </b> On the principles, Mr Cannon stated:</p>
<p>“The <b>principles</b> are those which should guide our occupation, if only short-term, of </p>
<p>Iraqi territory. They are pretty uncontroversial. But our military commanders would </p>
<p>find this sort of guidance, endorsed by Ministers, very useful.”</p>
<p><b>1003. </b> Mr Cannon concluded:</p>
<p>“If you approve these objectives and principles, the next step would be for Iraq </p>
<p>Planning Unit to share them with the Americans. There is no reason to think that </p>
<p>they cut across American views in any way.” </p>
<p><b>1004. </b> The evidence seen by the Inquiry indicates that Mr Blair saw Mr Cannon’s minute, </p>

<p>429</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1005. </b> There is no indication that Mr Blair discussed the objectives and principles with </p>

<p><b>1010. </b> The paper was the first Treasury paper on post-conflict financing to be shared </p>

<p>for a transitional administration, Iraqi oil might only pay for a fraction of the total. </p>

<p>ensuring Iraqi revenues were not diverted into debt or compensation payments. By far </p>
<p>the most significant factor in making that happen would be political legitimacy conferred </p>
<p>by the UN. </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> The Treasury stated that OFF provided “an obvious way to pay for immediate </p>
<p>humanitarian needs”, by using the approximately US$4bn unspent in the UN OFF </p>
<p>account and restarting oil exports. That depended on oil production facilities surviving </p>
<p>the conflict relatively intact. In the most benign circumstances, with rapidly increasing </p>
<p>production and high oil prices, oil revenues “could make a very significant contribution” </p>
<p>to ongoing relief and reconstruction. Future oil revenues were another possible source </p>
<p>of funds, but, officials warned, Iraq had already accumulated “massive and probably </p>
<p>unsustainable debts” that way. </p>
<p><b>1014. </b> The Treasury concluded that, given fiscal constraints in the UK and US, total </p>
<p>resources for reconstruction would be “substantially smaller if the UN were not involved”. </p>
<p>That, combined with the likelihood that the IMF and World Bank would be unable to </p>
<p>engage in such circumstances, “could make it harder to put Iraq on a path to peace, </p>
<p>stability and democracy”.</p>

<p>and a resolution establishing the relationship between the occupying force and occupied </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p><b>1026.  At the Azores Summit, Mr Blair emphasised the presentational benefits of </b></p>

<p>that it would not be able to deal with communal violence.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> That would need to be </p>

<p>carefully:</p>

<p><b>1030. </b> The record of the discussion was to be shown only to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>their Principal Private Secretaries.</p>
<p><b>1031.  The Azores ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ incorporated many </b></p>
<p><b>elements of earlier UK drafts, but the wording on democracy, terrorism and the </b></p>

<p><b>1032. </b> The ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ issued by Mr Blair, President Bush </p>
<p>and Prime Minister Aznar at the Summit on 16 March is described in more detail in </p>
<p>Section 3.8. It adopted a more oratorical tone than the UK text, but shared much of the </p>
<p>substance.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> Key differences included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the omission of any explicit reference to oil;</p>

<p>rule of law as cornerstones of democracy”); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insertion of named references to Iraq’s constituent peoples (Iraq’s “rich mix </p>
<p>of Sunni and Shiite Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and all </p>
<p>others”). </p>
<p><b>1033. </b> On post-conflict reconstruction, the three leaders declared:</p>
<p>“We will work to prevent and repair damage by Saddam Hussein’s regime to the </p>

<p>for the Iraqi people. All Iraqis should share the wealth generated by their national </p>
<p>economy … </p>
<p>“In achieving this vision, we plan to work in close partnership with international </p>

<p>adoption, on an urgent basis, of new United Nations Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>that would affirm Iraq’s territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian </p>
<p>relief, and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq. We will also </p>
<p>propose that the Secretary-General be given authority, on an interim basis, to ensure </p>
<p>that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people continue to be met through the </p>

<p>to support the people of Iraq will be for the long term.”</p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Mr Blair commented further at the concluding press conference:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> Mr Huw Llewellyn, an FCO Legal Counsellor, wrote to the IPU on 13 March to </p>
<p>emphasise the need for concrete information about ORHA’s plans now that there were </p>
<p>UK secondees in the organisation. He stated:</p>
<p>“This is important because if UK forces are in control of the Basra area, the UK will </p>
<p>be the Occupying Power in that area and it will be the UK’s international obligations </p>
<p>which are engaged.”</p>
<p>441</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Mr Llewellyn wrote to the IPU again on 17 March to explain that he had </p>
<p>intended to comment in detail on an ORHA plan for “post-liberation” Iraq but that, </p>
<p>after meeting Maj Gen Cross, it had become clear that “ORHA plans in reality are </p>
<p>much more limited”.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> ORHA now appeared to intend to “do the minimum necessary </p>
<p>to allow Iraqi ministries to function” before handing over to a “UN Security Council </p>
<p>authorised administration after about ninety days”. Given Maj Gen Cross’s planned role, </p>
<p>Mr Llewellyn suggested that developments should be monitored and views fed in as </p>
<p>necessary through him.</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> The same day, Mr Llewellyn also advised the IPU on the compatibility of various </p>
<p>post-conflict activities with the rules of military occupation.</p>
<p>443</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1042. </b> Mr Llewellyn explained that Security Council authorisation was not required for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. The position was more complicated for “rehabilitation” and </p>
<p>“reconstruction”:</p>
<p>“Rehabilitation</p>
<p>“As I understand it, this means essential repair work, (for example to schools, </p>
<p>hospitals, government buildings, roads). It is closely connected with basic </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. </p>
<p>“… Article 55 of the Hague Regulations requires the Occupying Power to ‘safeguard’ </p>
<p>the capital of public buildings etc. Repair work would be consistent with that </p>
<p>obligation …</p>
<p>“Reconstruction</p>
<p>“You list under this heading matters such as reform of the judiciary, security sector </p>
<p>and police reform, demobilisation, reform of government and its institutions, the </p>
<p>education system, and the banking system … it might also include the building of </p>
<p>new roads and other structures to assist the regeneration of Iraq.</p>

<p>be permissible – where this is necessary for the relief effort or, for example for </p>

<p>that “sweeping” institutional and personnel changes would not be permitted.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1044.  The FCO informed No.10 that the UK continued to make progress </b></p>
<p><b>reconciling UK and US positions on the post-conflict role of the UN, but </b></p>
<p><b>significant differences remained. </b></p>
<p><b>1045.  The US accepted the need to internationalise Phase IV activity but wanted </b></p>
<p><b>to keep the “whip hand”, an approach that was “almost certainly not negotiable in </b></p>
<p><b>the UN Security Council”.</b></p>
<p><b>1046.  The FCO advised that the US must be held to the commitments made </b></p>

<p><b>international effort and the likelihood of a much less consensual environment in </b></p>

<p>445</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The US now accepted that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Phase IV reform and reconstruction task is much too big for the US/UK </p>
<p>to go it alone. All the traditional nation-builders will be required – the IFIs, the </p>
<p>UN, NGOs, and the big bilateral donors (eg the EU and Japan). We need wide </p>
<p>international support to allow us an exit strategy.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security Council authorisation would make it easier to secure international </p>
<p>support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The international community would need a new Security Council mandate to </p>
<p>have a legal basis for a reform programme which would go beyond what was </p>

<p><b>1049. </b> At the same time, some important differences remained. In particular, the US </p>
<p>wanted:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the resolution authorising Phase IV to identify the US-led civil transitional </p>
<p>authority as the main body leading reform and reconstruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UN Special Co-ordinator to be subordinate to the Coalition military </p>
<p>commander;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US to oversee the process leading to the creation of the IIA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the IIA to be managed closely by the Coalition rather than lightly supervised by </p>
<p>the UN Special Co-ordinator; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Coalition to continue to exercise control over IIA decisions in areas for which </p>
<p>the IIA had been given responsibility.</p>
<p><b>1050. </b> The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“… the US want the UN Security Council to authorise them to take charge of the </p>
<p>reform and reconstruction of Iraq. Although they accept the need to internationalise </p>
<p>activity in Phase IV, they want to keep the whip hand.</p>
<p>“The US approach is almost certainly not negotiable in the UN Security Council. And </p>
<p>the last thing we need is another prolonged and acrimonious wrangle in the Council </p>
<p>over the details of the day after arrangements …</p>
<p>“We made clear to the US last week, (and many times before that) our view on the </p>
<p>shortcomings of their Phase IV concept. President Bush’s public statement at the </p>
<p>Azores Summit and the US/UK/Spanish vision for Iraq provide good foundations on </p>
<p>which to build. We must keep the US to these commitments. The alternative would </p>
<p>be grim – no Security Council authorisation would mean no wide international effort, </p>
<p>and the likelihood of a much less consensual environment in which to operate: in </p>
<p>short, far from a recipe for mission success.</p>
<p>“The next procedural step is for the US to send us their version of the draft UNSCR </p>
<p>for Phase IV … Meanwhile, we should continue to offer our advice, as their best </p>
<p>friends, on what is and is not likely to work. </p>
<p>“The key to reconciling US and UK differences may lie in the personality of the figure </p>

<p>454</p>
<p> In the letter of 17 March, Mr Blair stated that he knew from the meeting in </p>

<p>which has a genuinely representative government and where there are greater human </p>

<p><b>1069. </b> During a meeting with Mr Blair at No.10 on 17 March, Dr Salih said that it would </p>
<p>be important to hand over quickly to the Iraqi people as much of the running of Iraq as </p>
<p>possible, but that he did not want the UK and US military to leave early.</p>
<p>455</p>
<p><b>1070.  Concerns about ORHA continued to grow as ORHA staff deployed from </b></p>
<p><b>Washington to Kuwait in the days immediately before the invasion. </b></p>

<p><b>working for an organisation that was expected to be responsible for the initial </b></p>

<p>456</p>
<p> The inter-agency tensions </p>
<p>that had hampered post-conflict planning in the US were soon compounded by new </p>
<p>logistical obstacles. Although Gen Franks had placed ORHA under the operational </p>
<p>command of Gen McKiernan’s CFLCC, when Lt Gen Garner’s advance party arrived at </p>
<p>CFLCC headquarters, there was no space available for them. Post-conflict planners in </p>

<p><b>1075. </b> In his written statement to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Cross said that while in London </p>
<p>he briefed Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“I was as honest about the position as I could be, essentially briefing that I did not </p>
<p>believe post-war planning was anywhere near ready. I told him that there was no </p>
<p>clarity on what was going to be needed after the military phase of the operation, </p>

<p>“He [Mr Blair] was engaged … So we had a very sensible conversation, and at the </p>

<p>this military campaign. I do not believe that we are ready for post-war Iraq …</p>

<p>I was saying.”</p>
<p>459</p>
<p><b>1077. </b> In his written statement, Maj Gen Cross explained that:</p>
<p>“… after all of the many briefings and conversations I had in the UK at that time, my </p>
<p>sense was that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Not everyone believed that there would actually be a war; if there was to be one, </p>
<p>then there was certainly no consensus that we (the UK) should be involved;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no coherent UK, pan-Whitehall, view of what post-war Iraq should </p>
<p>look like;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was serious reluctance to take on the US over their views;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If events did unfurl differently to ‘the plan’ – such as it was – there was an </p>
<p>underlying belief that the US would quickly be able to bring whatever was </p>
<p>necessary to bear;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was, therefore, some seriously wishful and woolly, and un-joined up, </p>
<p>thinking going on!”</p>

<p><b>1078. </b> Maj Gen Cross told the Inquiry he had found no single cross-Whitehall </p>

<p>462</p>
<p> ORHA would provide the initial civilian government of Iraq and it </p>

<p><b>would follow a short and successful military campaign, Mr Straw asked what </b></p>

<p><b>1084.  Mr Straw’s question was not put to officials and there is no indication that </b></p>

<p>464</p>
<p> The paper stated that:</p>
<p>“Much will depend on how the military campaign goes, the success of the post-war </p>
<p>settlement and whether we are able to provide useable evidence to the international </p>
<p>community that Saddam presented a real threat. <b>For the purposes of this paper, </b></p>
<p><b>we assume a positive outcome on all three.</b>”</p>
<p><b>1086. </b> The section on relations with the US recommended focusing on “a relatively </p>
<p>small number of deliverables” on Iraq, the MEPP, WMD proliferation, the World Trade </p>
<p>Organization (WTO) and climate change. On Iraq, the paper recommended:</p>
<p>“We should continue to argue strongly for US agreement to a genuine UN role in </p>

<p>… We should also seek to ensure that UK companies get a fair crack of the whip in </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>506</p>
<p><b>1089. </b> Asked why, given US opposition to a leading role for the UN in post-conflict Iraq, </p>
<p>the UK did not have a plan B, Mr Straw told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the only plan B … in the absence of a central role for the UN, was a central role </p>
<p>for the Occupiers, which were the US and the UK. Those were the two alternatives. </p>
<p>There was lots and lots of discussion with the United States system …</p>
<p>“… [I]t wasn’t for the want of trying that we ended up in the position we did, but this </p>
<p>was one of those absolute classics where the American decision making process </p>
<p>was opaque … you put all these things in and it just sort of flows around and one </p>
<p>day there is a decision.”</p>
<p>467</p>
<p><b>1090.  Mr Straw had been aware since January, when Mr Ricketts had likened the </b></p>
<p><b>process of changing US views to “water on a stone”, that it would be extremely </b></p>
<p><b>difficult to secure US support for the UK’s preferred option. </b></p>
<p><b>1091.  It was Mr Straw’s responsibility as Foreign Secretary to give due </b></p>
<p><b>consideration to the range of options available to the UK should that effort </b></p>
<p><b>fail. Those included making UK participation in military action conditional </b></p>
<p><b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>satisfactory post-conflict plan. </b></p>
<p><b>1092.  Section 6.4 states that Mr Straw did not do so in January 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>1093.  Nor did he address that gap between January and March.</b></p>
<p><b>1094.  FCO guidance on Phase IV sent to all UK diplomatic posts on 19 March </b></p>

<p><b>1096. </b> The same text was circulated to No.10 and key departments the next day.</p>

<p><b>1098. </b> Once most of Iraq had been stabilised, ORHA would take on supervision of the </p>

<p>hope that the vast majority of the Iraqi public sector will remain in place and be able to </p>
<p>carry on its work, albeit under ITCA’s overall direction.” In the first weeks, the Coalition’s </p>
<p>task would be to provide a secure environment for the delivery of humanitarian relief by </p>
<p>UN agencies and NGOs. </p>
<p><b>1099. </b> After “some weeks”, the UN should appoint a Special Co-ordinator for Iraq and </p>
<p>set out a mandate for the international community’s presence in the country, leading </p>
<p>to the establishment of an IIA under the “light supervision” of the Special Co-ordinator. </p>
<p>The IIA would establish a constituent assembly along the lines of the Bonn Conference </p>

<p>471</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“That is why what happens after any conflict in Iraq is of such critical significance. </p>
<p>Here again there is a chance to unify around the United Nations. There should </p>
<p>be a new United Nations resolution following any conflict providing not only for </p>
<p>humanitarian help, but for the administration and governance of Iraq. That must </p>
<p>be done under proper UN authorisation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The UN resolution that should provide for the proper governance of Iraq should also </p>
<p>protect totally the territorial integrity of Iraq. And this is also important: that the oil </p>
<p>revenues, which people falsely claim that we want to seize, should be put in a trust </p>
<p>fund for the Iraqi people administered through the UN.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Let the future Government of Iraq be given the chance to begin the process of </p>
<p>uniting the nation’s disparate groups, on a democratic basis …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The process must begin on a democratic basis, respecting human rights, as, </p>
<p>indeed, the fledgling democracy in northern Iraq – protected from Saddam for </p>
<p>12 years by British and American pilots in the No-Fly Zone – has done remarkably. </p>
<p>The moment that a new Government are in place, committed to disarming Iraq of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, is the point in time when sanctions should be lifted, </p>
<p>in their entirety for the people of Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>1107. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I have never put the justification for action as regime change. We have to act within </p>
<p>the terms set out in resolution 1441 – that is our legal base. But it is the reason why </p>
<p>I say frankly that if we do act we should do so with a clear conscience and a strong </p>
<p>heart … Iraq is a potentially wealthy country which in 1979, the year before Saddam </p>
<p>came to power, was richer than Portugal or Malaysia. Today it is impoverished, </p>

<p>with 60 percent of its population dependent on food aid. Thousands of children die </p>
<p>needlessly every year from lack of food and medicine. Four million people out of a </p>
<p>population of just over 20 million are living in exile.</p>
<p>“The brutality of the repression – the death and torture camps, the barbaric prisons </p>
<p>for political opponents … is well documented … We take our freedom for granted. </p>
<p>But imagine what it must be like not to be able to speak or discuss or debate or even </p>
<p>question the society you live in. To see friends and family taken away and never </p>
<p>daring to complain. To suffer the humility [sic] of failing courage in face of pitiless </p>
<p>terror. That is how the Iraqi people live. Leave Saddam in place, and the blunt truth </p>
<p>is that that is how they will continue to be forced to live.</p>
<p>“We must face the consequences of the actions that we advocate. For those … who </p>
<p>are opposed to this course, it means … that for the Iraqi people, whose only true </p>
<p>hope lies in the removal of Saddam, the darkness will simply close back over.”</p>

<p><b>1108. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair stated that the “moral case for action – never absent from </p>

<p>subconsciously the Chicago speech of 1999” (see Section 1.1).</p>
<p>473</p>
<p><b>1109.  A small number of MPs raised post-conflict issues in the debate that </b></p>
<p><b>followed Mr Blair’s speech.</b></p>
<p><b>1110. </b> In the debate that followed Mr Blair’s speech, Mr Duncan Smith stated that it </p>
<p>would be wrong not to acknowledge the consequences of military action:</p>
<p>“That is why the Opposition have constantly urged the Government to set out </p>
<p>their plans for humanitarian assistance. Our view of the lack of preparedness was </p>
<p>endorsed by the Select Committee on International Development …</p>
<p>“We welcome the written statement made last week by the Secretary of State for </p>
<p>International Development, but it did not explain what is being done to improve </p>
<p>co-ordination between the Ministry of Defence and DFID. It did not establish whether </p>
<p>DFID would set up a mechanism to co-ordinate the UK humanitarian response. </p>
<p>It did not set out what will replace the Oil-for-Food programme … It did not spell </p>
<p>out DFID’s plan in the event of Saddam Hussein unleashing any of his arsenal of </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons on his own people. Nor did it give details of how </p>
<p>to cope with the flight of refugees … The questions need to be answered.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>1111. </b> In response to an intervention from Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru) as to why he </p>
<p>was “so keen on going to war” if those preparations were so ill-advanced, Mr Duncan </p>
<p>Smith stated: </p>
<p>“The hon. Gentleman betrays a certain ignorance. The reality is that we need to deal </p>
<p>with Saddam Hussein regardless of those arrangements.” </p>
<p><b>1112. </b> Later in the debate, Mr Alex Salmond (Scottish National Party) asked: “Will the </p>
<p>nation-building work? The record of the United States on nation-building has not been </p>
<p>impressive.”</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1113. </b> Mr Tony Worthington (Labour) raised concerns about the scale of the challenge </p>
<p>in Iraq:</p>
<p>“What bothers my constituents – it is one of the reasons why the Prime Minister fails </p>
<p>to persuade them of the rightness of his approach – is that little or no attention is </p>
<p>being paid to the consequences of the action that we are about to take.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We are going to invade a country of Balkanesque complexity where occupying </p>
<p>forces will be unable easily to withdraw. We are rapidly in danger of becoming </p>
<p>piggy in the middle for every discontented ethnic or religious group in the area. </p>
<p>There seems little doubt of speedy, initial victory, but it is worth remembering that </p>
<p>the six-day war in the Middle East is still going strong after 35 years. This war has </p>
<p>similar potential.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We have to consider the scale of the humanitarian problem. Iraq is a huge country, </p>
<p>the size of France. We have to think about feeding 26 million people instantly. That </p>
<p>has to be done by the UN, not by the Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian </p>
<p>Assistance … I hope that the Minister will be absolutely clear in his winding-up </p>
<p>speech whether the UN or American generals will be in control …”</p>
<p>476</p>
<p><b>1114. </b> Mr John Baron (Conservative) stated that insufficient thought had been given </p>
<p>to the consequences of military action:</p>
<p>“Who and what will replace Saddam Hussein? What plans exist for humanitarian </p>
<p>relief? We know little about that. What effect will the action have on the stability </p>
<p>of neighbouring states?”</p>

<p><b>1115. </b> Mr Michael Ancram, Shadow Foreign Secretary, while expressing support </p>
<p>for military action, asked Mr Straw to explain what provision had been made for </p>
<p>humanitarian relief:</p>
<p>“We are told that all is in hand, but we have not yet heard what is in hand or how </p>
<p>it will be delivered … [I]n Yugoslavia we started but we did not finish. This time </p>
<p>we must finish.</p>
<p>“We must also ensure that what replaces Saddam Hussein’s brutal regime is a truly </p>
<p>representative government, accepted by the Iraqi people and, as Kofi Annan said </p>
<p>and the Azores meeting agreed, under the auspices of the United Nations … If the </p>
<p>administration are not representative – if they are not balanced – they will fail … </p>
<p>Above all we must preserve the territorial integrity of Iraq …”</p>
<p>478</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1116. </b> In his concluding remarks, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“As the Prime Minister, President Bush and Prime Minister Aznar agreed in the </p>
<p>Azores on Sunday … a new resolution will be put before the Security Council. </p>
<p>I hope very much that it will attract the fullest possible support … and that the United </p>
<p>Nations will be fully and actively involved in the reconstruction effort.”</p>
<p><b>1117. </b> In response to a question from Mr Salmond about the cost of reconstruction, </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“… Iraq is an astonishingly wealthy country. The oil is important to this extent: it </p>
<p>has the second largest oil reserves in the Middle East. One of the other agreements </p>
<p>clearly reached in the Azores, which must also be endorsed by a United Nations </p>
<p>Security Council resolution, which we shall propose, is that every single cent and </p>
<p>penny of those oil revenues are not plundered by Saddam Hussein and his friends, </p>
<p>but used for the benefit of the Iraqi people. I am quite clear that, when that happens, </p>
<p>the costs of reconstruction to the rest of the world will be remarkably insignificant. </p>
<p>I can also tell the hon. Gentleman that we have already provided funds for </p>
<p>contingency work to ensure the smooth passage of the reconstruction work.”</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>1118.  In the House of Lords, concerns were raised about the potential for ethnic </b></p>
<p><b>and political violence after Saddam Hussein’s departure. </b></p>
<p><b>1119. </b> In the House of Lords debate on Iraq, Lord Redesdale (Liberal Democrat) warned:</p>
<p>“Even with regime change, there will be no simple solution. We will not be able to </p>
<p>install a democratic government in the short term. Looking back to the previous Gulf </p>
<p>War, there was enormous letting of blood, settling of scores and political upheaval. </p>
<p>That will increase …</p>

<p>pieces in Iraq in the short to medium term.”</p>
<p>480</p>
<p><b>1120. </b> Lord Elton (Conservative) described the ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ </p>
<p>issued at the Azores Summit as “aspirational rather than inspirational”.</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> He asked </p>
<p>how the Vision would be achieved:</p>
<p>“… what is to be the cost, and under what government. It took the Americans </p>
<p>12 years to get out of Japan after the last world war, and it took us 50 years to unite </p>
<p>Germany. It troubles me that so little has been thought and said on this matter until </p>
<p>so late in the programme …</p>
<p>“… [W]e have to remember with compassion the people of Iraq who suffered horrors </p>
<p>under tyranny. We must ensure that they do not suffer horrors after a war due to </p>
<p>munitions left behind or through internecine strife …” </p>

<p><b>1122.  Proposals for the creation of a wider Ministerial group covering post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>issues were kept under review.</b></p>
<p><b>1123. </b> The first Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq, also known as the “War Cabinet”, took place </p>
<p>at 8.30am on 19 March.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1124. </b> The Ad Hoc Meeting took place daily from 19 March to 12 April, with the exception </p>
<p>of Sundays 30 March and 6 April, and was chaired by Mr Blair. Attendees included </p>
<p>Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Ms Short. </p>
<p><b>1125. </b> The remit of the Ad Hoc Meeting was to “cover … military and other updates and </p>
<p>the day’s events”, and “to focus on longer term policy decisions”, although the time for </p>
<p>that would be limited and would need to be “rationed carefully”.</p>
<p>483</p>
<p><b>1126. </b> When Sir Andrew Turnbull explained the new arrangements to Mr Heywood, </p>
<p>he proposed that:</p>
<p>“There might also be a case for having a weekly meeting of DOP [the Defence and </p>
<p>Overseas Policy Committee] … perhaps convening just before Cabinet. This would </p>
<p>provide an opportunity for wider Ministerial involvement, including on day after </p>

<p>486</p>
<p> He requested a meeting with Ms Short on 21 March, on </p>
<p>her return from discussions with Mr Annan and the US on preparations for humanitarian </p>
<p>relief and reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>1131. </b> At their meeting on 19 March, the Chiefs of Staff observed that the US appeared </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>514</p>
<p><b>1135. </b> At Prime Minister’s Questions on 19 March, Mr David Rendel (Liberal Democrat) </p>
<p>asked for assurances that sufficient funds for post-conflict reconstruction would be made </p>
<p>available quickly.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1136. </b> Mr Blair replied that the purpose of the reconstruction programme in Iraq </p>
<p>was not, primarily, to do with the consequences of conflict, “but is actually to do with </p>
<p>reconstructing the country after the years of Saddam Hussein and his rule”. Funds had </p>
<p>already been earmarked for the purpose and Ministers were doing all they could “to </p>
<p>make sure that we co-ordinate with American allies and also with other UN partners to </p>
<p>ensure that the funds are available and also that the programme is available, so that in </p>
<p>the post-conflict situation in Iraq the people of Iraq are given the future that they need”.</p>
<p><b>1137. </b> Mr Duncan Smith observed that, when he had asked in the past about the plans </p>
<p>for post-conflict Iraq, Mr Blair had been “quite legitimately and understandably, reluctant </p>
<p>to give full answers because he would not have wanted to give the impression that war </p>
<p>was inevitable”.</p>
<p>490</p>
<p> Would Mr Blair now explain what plans there were “to put in place a </p>
<p>civilian representative government in Iraq”?</p>
<p><b>1138. </b> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We are in discussion now with not just the United States, but other allies and </p>
<p>the United Nations. We want to ensure that any post-conflict authority in Iraq is </p>
<p>endorsed and authorised by a new United Nations resolution, and I think that will </p>
<p>be an important part of bringing the international community back together again.”</p>
<p>491</p>
<p><b>1139. </b> Mr Blair referred Mr Duncan Smith to the ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’. </p>
<p>He suggested that the principles of peace, prosperity, freedom and good government </p>
<p>included in the Vision “will go some way toward showing that if there is a conflict and </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein is removed, the future for the Iraqi people will be better as a result”. </p>

<p>515</p>
<p><b>1143. </b> During the debate, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that: “Whatever the present </p>
<p>divisions and resentments, we the Security Council, we the United Nations, have a </p>
<p>central role to play on Iraq and on the wider issues associated with it.” That included </p>
<p>rapid delivery of humanitarian relief and the earliest possible lifting of sanctions. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy hoped that, “with the active contribution of the Secretary-General”, rapid </p>
<p>progress could be made “on this crucial area”. Ms Short was in New York to discuss </p>
<p>humanitarian issues and the UK had already set aside “about US$110m for immediate </p>
<p>humanitarian provision if there is a conflict” and was likely to announce further funding. </p>
<p><b>1144. </b> Mr Annan said that the “plight of the Iraqi people” was now his “most immediate </p>
<p>concern”. In the short term, a conflict could “make things worse – perhaps much worse”. </p>
<p>The members of the Security Council should agree to “do everything we can to mitigate </p>
<p>this imminent disaster”. </p>
<p><b>1145. </b> Mr Annan stated that:</p>
<p>“Under international law, the responsibility for protecting civilians in conflict falls on </p>
<p>the ‘belligerents’. In any area under military occupation, responsibility for the welfare </p>
<p>of the population falls on the Occupying Power.</p>
<p>“Without in any way assuming or diminishing that ultimate responsibility, we in the </p>
<p>United Nations will do whatever we can to help.”</p>
<p><b>1146. </b> Mr Annan explained that there would be an appeal for additional funds to finance </p>
<p>relief operations and that decisions by the Council would be needed to adjust the Oil-for-</p>
<p>Food programme.</p>
<p><b>1147. </b> Mr Annan concluded by expressing the hope that:</p>
<p>“… the effort to relieve the sufferings of the Iraqi people and to rehabilitate their </p>
<p>society after so much destruction may yet be the task around which the unity of </p>
<p>the Council can be rebuilt.”</p>
<p><b>1148. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that, on 19 March, Mr Annan was reported to have </p>
<p>said he did not think there was a role for the UN in the circumstances of internationally </p>
<p>controversial military action.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p> Mr Straw said that Mr Annan’s remarks “made an </p>
<p>extensive role for the UN doubly difficult”. There had been “no prospect at that stage … </p>
<p>of a central role [for the UN]”.</p>
<p><b>Straw/Hoon joint minute to Mr Blair</b></p>

<p>516</p>
<p><b>1150.  On 19 March, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon informed Mr Blair that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the UK would not be expected to contribute resources to anything </b></p>
<p><b>other than security during the first phase of the US post-conflict plan </b></p>
<p><b>(a transitional administration headed by ORHA); </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>it would be premature to take a view on the merits of sectors for the </b></p>
<p><b>following phase; but </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>it would help the US and military planners to agree on the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>medium-term contribution.</b></p>
<p><b>1151.  The minute concluded with a warning that Coalition partners were thin on </b></p>
<p><b>the ground. If the campaign did not go well, there would not be many who would </b></p>
<p><b>be prepared or able to take part.</b></p>
<p><b>1152.  Mr Straw and Mr Hoon considered only the UK’s military presence in Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>They made no reference to the civilian contribution.</b></p>
<p><b>1153.  Sir Kevin Tebbit expressed concern about the transition from a primarily </b></p>
<p><b>military effort to longer-term civilian-led reconstruction. It would be necessary to </b></p>
<p><b>work hard to avoid dependence on the Armed Forces to carry out civilian tasks. </b></p>

<p>496</p>
<p><b>1157. </b> In the MOD, the draft was cleared by Adm Boyce and Sir Kevin Tebbit. </p>

<p>widely dispersed across Iraq, depending on how Phase III goes, because without </p>
<p>successful Phase III, Phase IV becomes harder, if not academic. The trick will be </p>
<p>to be able to regroup in a smaller area of SE Iraq once hostilities are ended.</p>
<p>“I also agree that we should be clear about our medium/long-term scale of military </p>

<p>ahead to stay broadly within … [<i>Strategic Defence Review</i> guidelines].</p>
<p>497</p>
<p>“What concerns me most is the process of transiting from a primarily military effort </p>
<p>to the civil-led longer-term humanitarian and reconstruction phase. Recent history </p>
<p>does not offer too much encouragement and we shall have to work hard to avoid </p>
<p>‘dependence culture’ on the armed forces to do things which should be for civil </p>
<p>departments – initially through aid, subsequently through Iraqi own efforts. The </p>
<p>politics of the issue do, I believe, point in the same direction. To meet the PM’s wish </p>
<p>for us to play an exemplary role, we shall need to remember that memories of the </p>
<p>UK in the region from the 1920s are not all positive, and we should make clear our </p>

<p>“(a)  The maximum size of task that UK forces would contribute to in the early days </p>
<p>should not exceed our overall military capability. A focus in the South-East of </p>
<p>Iraq would be reasonable.</p>
<p>(b)  The UK contribution to such a task in advance of a Security Council resolution </p>
<p>would be limited to the facilitation of humanitarian assistance and a secure </p>
<p>environment and the elimination of WMD.</p>
<p>(c)  We therefore need to agree urgently with the US a realistic authorising Security </p>
<p>Council resolution for post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>(d)  We should agree urgently a plan with the US to help us find military partners </p>
<p>to enable us to draw down and, in due course, design an exit strategy.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>518</p>
<p><b>1160. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon gave little detail of what UK forces would be required to do </p>
<p>immediately after the invasion: </p>
<p>“Much will depend on how the campaign develops, but in the first few weeks we </p>
<p>should expect Coalition forces to be spread across Iraq. The expectation is that UK </p>
<p>forces will end up in southern Iraq, loosely centred on Basra. However, we should </p>
<p>be prepared for elements of our forces to be dispersed fairly widely across Iraq …</p>
<p>“US military planning continues to be fluid. But it envisages Coalition forces </p>
<p>re-deploying into a more tailored security framework as soon as the situation </p>
<p>permits. The military task will be to facilitate a secure environment (including law </p>
<p>and order, deterring adventurism and a variety of military-technical tasks) to enable </p>
<p>immediate humanitarian relief to be conducted. To help UK forces win hearts and </p>
<p>minds, HMT have allocated them £30m for humanitarian purposes in the first </p>
<p>month as well as £10m for quick win projects. (Clare [Short] has allocated £20m for </p>
<p>UN agencies’ preparations and earmarked another £60m from DFID’s contingency </p>
<p>reserve for humanitarian operations. But this is a drop in the ocean; in the worse </p>
<p>case, if the Oil-for-Food programme ground to a halt, Iraq could need as much as a </p>
<p>billion dollars a month for humanitarian aid.)</p>
<p>“The expectation is that UK forces would be responsible for a task focused on Basra </p>
<p>and other key military objectives in the South-East of Iraq, which could include </p>
<p>20 percent of the Iraqi population. This task is broadly proportionate to the size of </p>
<p>the UK’s contribution to overall Coalition land forces …</p>
<p>“In parallel, and under the overall military command, the US plan to bring in a </p>
<p>transitional administration</p>
<p>500</p>
<p> to co-ordinate immediate civil relief and humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance. The transitional administration is making plans for allocating its limited </p>
<p>resources, including provision of public sector salaries, on a nation wide, Coalition </p>
<p>basis. There is no expectation that the UK would be asked to contribute any </p>
<p>resources to anything other than security. So there is no suggestion that the UK </p>
<p>would be left to foot the bill for the civil administration or the costs of humanitarian </p>
<p>relief and reconstruction in any area.” </p>
<p><b>1161. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon reported that US planning remained “sensibly flexible” </p>
<p>once the initial phase was over and “a major part of Iraq has been stabilised”. It advised </p>
<p>that US planning:</p>
<p>“… recognises that parts of Iraq will be more permissive than others and that </p>
<p>security could well be provided through something other than sectors. It would </p>
<p>be premature now to take a view on the merits of sectors for this stage. We are </p>
<p>well placed to influence US thinking with a number of military officers and officials </p>
<p>embedded within their military headquarters and in ITCA. <b>It would be helpful for </b></p>
<p>500 </p>
<p>A footnote explained: “The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) becomes the </p>
<p>transitional administration once it is established inside Iraq.”</p>

<p><b>them, and for military planners generally, to agree what our scale of effort </b></p>
<p><b>should be in our medium-term contribution to Iraq.</b>”</p>
<p><b>1162. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon advised that it would be necessary to reduce the UK </p>
<p>military contribution “to nearer a third by no later than the autumn in order to avoid </p>
<p>long-term damage to the Armed Forces” and to remain within current defence planning </p>
<p>assumptions: “If Ministers wanted us to, we would need decisions now so that we would </p>
<p>be able to recommend what would have to give elsewhere.” Scaling down to nearer a </p>
<p>third would limit the UK contribution thereafter to “a maximum of around one brigade, a </p>
<p>two-star headquarters and possibly a contribution to higher level command and control”. </p>
<p>They recommended telling the US now, for planning purposes, that this was the upper </p>
<p>limit of the UK contribution. </p>
<p><b>1163. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon also recorded that the ARRC featured in current </p>
<p>CENTCOM planning as a multinational headquarters that could play a role in </p>
<p>post-conflict Iraq, but would be the subject of a separate paper (see Section 9.1).</p>
<p><b>1164. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon ended with a section on “<b>Setting the conditions for </b></p>
<p><b>success</b>”. The conditions in which UK forces operated needed to be conducive to </p>
<p>success. There needed to be a resolution authorising international activity in the </p>
<p>post-conflict period and: “We should also let the US know the key importance of </p>
<p>internationalising the security arrangements now so that we can reduce our commitment </p>
<p>as set out above. And we would expect US support in building a wider Coalition to </p>
<p>operate alongside our forces, allow us to draw down and eventually to provide us with </p>
<p>an exit strategy.” </p>
<p><b>1165. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon concluded:</p>
<p>“We should be realistic about the limited prospects of our finding any genuine </p>
<p>military capability to help us take this task on. New … Coalition partners are thin on </p>
<p>the ground and, if the post-conflict phase does not go well, there will not be many </p>
<p>nations who will be prepared or able to take part.</p>
<p>“And finally, we shall need to return to this issue once we are clear how the </p>
<p>campaign is developing and look at our wider contribution in the round.”</p>
<p><b>1166.  The Cabinet Office took a different position on whether it would be </b></p>
<p><b>“premature” to take a view on the merits of sectors.</b></p>
<p><b>1167. </b> Before the joint minute from Mr Straw and Mr Hoon reached No.10, </p>
<p>Mr Drummond advised Mr Rycroft that “we need Ministers to decide on sectors”. The </p>
<p>joint minute and the question of sectors should be on the agenda for the Ad Hoc Meeting </p>
<p>on Iraq (the “War Cabinet”) on 20 March, with Ms Short given the chance to comment on </p>
<p>the minute on her return from the US on 21 March.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>520</p>
<p><b>1168. </b> Mr Drummond suggested that Ministers would want to agree the proposals in the </p>
<p>joint minute:</p>
<p>“… provided they are satisfied that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK Forces will be capable of providing security for an area around Basra </p>
<p>including about 20 percent of Iraq’s population.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How long will we have this responsibility, and what is the exit strategy </p>
<p>(benign security environment created, UK forces replaced by others). Will </p>
<p>we be able to limit ‘our area’ to say Basra by the autumn, when we want to </p>
<p>withdraw two-thirds of our troops?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the assertion that the transitional administration will handle civil </p>
<p>administration including humanitarian reconstruction issues is correct: This </p>
<p>is clearly the plan, but it must be doubtful that ORHA will have the capacity, </p>
<p>and therefore the troops on the ground may be called on to help. The UK </p>
<p>certainly doesn’t have civilian capacity to help govern 20 percent of Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>1169. </b> The joint minute was not discussed at the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq at 10am on </p>
<p>20 March, where Mr Blair stated that decisions on the minute were needed at the next </p>
<p>meeting on 21 March.</p>
<p>502</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1170. </b> Mr Rycroft showed the Straw/Hoon joint minute on the UK military contribution </p>
<p>to post-conflict Iraq to Mr Blair on 20 March. Mr Rycroft commented:</p>
<p>“For discussion at 1500 on Friday [21 March]. Do you agree? Key points to fix </p>
<p>are: size of our sector, length of time of commitment, exit strategy, proper UN </p>
<p>authorisation.”</p>
<p>503</p>
<p><b>1171.  On the eve of the invasion, there remained considerable uncertainty about </b></p>
<p><b>the three phase model for post-conflict Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>1172.  In the absence of UN authorisation for post-conflict activity or agreement </b></p>
<p><b>on</b> <b>a UN role, the model, as understood by the UK, remained as much aspiration </b></p>
<p><b>as plan.</b></p>
<p><b>1173. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether, on the eve of the invasion, there had been a </p>
<p>reasonably clear understanding of the UK’s military, political and diplomatic objectives </p>
<p>for Phase IV, Mr Chilcott replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, I think the UK view of it was well understood within the UK Government, </p>
<p>and I have no reason to think it wasn’t well understood in the UK military as well, </p>
<p>which was that we were working on broadly this three-phase model in our minds </p>
<p>that we would have a period of occupation, where we would be governed by, as </p>

<p>I said, the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Regulations, where we would be </p>
<p>responsible for the welfare of the people. And our main concern at that stage would </p>
<p>be establishing a secure environment and ensuring that humanitarian relief was able </p>
<p>to get through to those that needed it. </p>
<p>“But we wanted that period to be as short as possible, after which we would move </p>
<p>to some interim administration authorised by the UN Security Council. </p>
<p>“It was clear, I think, on the eve of the invasion that we weren’t going to have a </p>
<p>UN-run interim administration, but an interim administration authorised by the </p>
<p>Security Council was going to be good enough for us. And that would begin the </p>
<p>process of reform and reconstruction in Iraq and, at the same time, we would </p>
<p>have the UN involved in a political process in parallel that would lead to some </p>
<p>kind of convention or conference that would enable a new constitution to emerge </p>
<p>and elections on the basis of the new constitution, whereupon with a new Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, we could hand over power completely to the new Iraqi Government. </p>
<p>And that coalition security forces would be needed for as long as the new Iraqi </p>
<p>Government wanted them.”</p>

<p><b>The invasion</b></p>
<p><b>1174.  The transition from conflict (Phase III) to post-conflict (Phase IV) military </b></p>
<p><b>operations began immediately Coalition troops started to occupy Iraqi territory. </b></p>
<p><b>1175.  When that transition began the Government had not taken firm decisions </b></p>
<p><b>on the nature or duration of the UK’s military commitment in post-conflict Iraq or </b></p>
<p><b>on the extent of the UK AOR. There had been no systematic analysis of the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>military or civilian capacity to fulfil its likely obligations in the South in a range of </b></p>
<p><b>circumstances, including: </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>in the prolonged absence of an authorising resolution;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>in the absence of additional Coalition partners; </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>in a hostile security environment with low levels of Iraqi consent; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>over different timescales, in particular the medium and long term. </b></p>
<p><b>1176.  Each of those issues had been identified as a potential risk to UK strategic </b></p>
<p><b>objectives in Iraq, but no detailed contingency plans or preparations were in place </b></p>
<p><b>to mitigate those risks. </b></p>
<p><b>1177.  Ministers, officials and the military continued to assume that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>there would be early agreement on a post-conflict resolution;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>levels of consent would rise steadily across most of Iraq; and</b></p>

<p><b>would succeed in realising the Azores vision for the social, political and </b></p>
<p><b>economic transformation of Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>1178.  Above all, it was assumed that the US, even without a convincing </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict plan, could act as guarantor of the UK’s objectives in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>1179.  Those assumptions shaped continuing discussions about the nature, </b></p>
<p><b>duration and extent of the UK’s post-conflict military and civilian deployment. </b></p>
<p><b>1180.  Two days after the start of the invasion Mr Blair sought further advice from </b></p>

<p><b>1181. </b> The invasion of Iraq began overnight on 19/20 March 2003. Military operations </p>

<p>505</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1183. </b> Lt Gen Reith was directed to “assume the UK Phase IV AO will be centred on </p>
<p>Basra”. In line with the military plan approved by Mr Blair on 14 March, the Directive </p>
<p>set clear limits on the expansion of the UK AO during the conflict phase of military </p>
<p>occupations. It stated that, to “assist the Coalition in a timely and successful Phase III </p>
<p>and to help in shaping Phase IV conditions in the UK AO”, Lt Gen Reith should exploit </p>
<p>no further north than an east-west line running 90km south of al-Kut, ending at a point </p>
<p>50km north-east of al-Amara.</p>
<p><b>1184. </b> The Directive also stated that it was Adm Boyce’s “current intent … that the UK </p>
<p>should aim to draw down its deployed force to medium scale within four months of </p>

<p>campaign as:</p>
<p>“… to create the conditions in which Iraq disarms in accordance with its obligations </p>

<p>507</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1188. </b> In aiming to achieve the objective as swiftly as possible, the military was </p>
<p>required to make “every effort … to minimise civilian casualties and damage to </p>
<p>essential economic infrastructure, and to minimise and address adverse humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences”. </p>
<p><b>1189. </b> On post-conflict issues, the objectives stated that the UK would “work with the </p>
<p>United Nations to lift sanctions affecting the supply of humanitarian and reconstruction </p>
<p>goods, and to enable Iraq’s own resources, including oil, to be available to meet the </p>
<p>needs of the Iraqi people”, and “help create conditions for a future, stable and law-</p>

<p><b>1190. </b> The document stated that the “immediate military priorities” for the Coalition in the </p>

<p><b>1203. </b> On 21 March, Mr Cannon sent Mr Blair a background note for the Ministerial </p>
<p>meeting on post-conflict issues scheduled for that afternoon.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> Mr Cannon summarised </p>
<p>the Straw/Hoon position on the scale of the UK’s medium-term military effort: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the US be told now that drawdown of the UK military effort to around one-</p>
<p>third by the autumn represented the upper limit of the UK contribution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the UK would seek partners for Phase IV, but the MOD and FCO were not </p>
<p>optimistic about the prospects for success; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the US planned an Iraq-wide transitional administration and “the possibility </p>
<p>of our taking over civil administration in a ‘British sector’ has fallen away”.</p>
<p><b>1204. </b> Mr Cannon attached an FCO paper on areas of agreement and disagreement </p>
<p>with the US on a post-conflict resolution. He explained that:</p>
<p>“The Americans want the Coalition to set the IIA up: we think it would have more </p>
<p>legitimacy with the UN playing a lead role. The Americans have just shown us a </p>
<p>draft SCR enshrining their ideas: we doubt that it will run in the Security Council. The </p>
<p>attached FCO paper sets out where we agree and disagree with the Americans: to </p>
<p>close the gap it recommends initially that the Foreign Secretary write to Colin Powell </p>
<p>… and if necessary you talk through the basic principles with President Bush.”</p>
<p><b>1205. </b> Mr Cannon also reported that problems with DFID/MOD co-operation on </p>
<p>humanitarian operations “appear to be falling away”. </p>
<p><b>1206. </b> Post-conflict co-operation between DFID and the MOD, including reports of </p>
<p>friction between military and DFID personnel in the UK AO, is addressed in Section 10.1. </p>
<p><b>1207. </b> After the Ministerial meeting on post-conflict issues on 21 March, </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft informed the FCO and the MOD that Mr Blair agreed to the Straw/Hoon </p>

<p><b>1208. </b> Joint FCO/MOD advice followed on 25 March.</p>
<p><b>1209. </b> At the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 22 March, Mr Blair requested advice from </p>
<p>Mr Straw on the UK’s approach to reconstruction “and associated conferences”.</p>
<p>515</p>
<p><b>1210.  Mr Blair discussed the need for a UN “badge” for post-conflict activity with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush on 22 March. He suggested that there should be two separate </b></p>
<p><b>resolutions: one on OFF, which should proceed quickly; and a second on </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict administration to follow. </b></p>
<p><b>1211. </b> In a telephone call on 22 March, Mr Blair raised the UN’s role with President </p>
<p>Bush.</p>
<p>516</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that it was essential to get a UN “badge” for post-conflict efforts </p>
<p>and that, while the Coalition did not want to hand over the results of its efforts to the UN, </p>
<p>a Security Council resolution on post-conflict administration would help the Coalition get </p>
<p>access to UN funding, including from the IFIs. </p>
<p><b>1212. </b> Mr Blair proposed that different parts of the draft resolution should proceed </p>
<p>on different timescales; a resolution on OFF should move quickly, with one covering </p>
<p>administration after the conflict to follow.</p>
<p><b>1213.  On 23 March, Mr Blair reassured Ministers that UK and US positions on </b></p>
<p><b>the role of the UN were not far apart. He believed the US was misreading the </b></p>
<p><b>implications of UN authorisation.</b></p>
<p><b>1214. </b> On 23 March, Mr Blair told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq that, on the draft </p>
<p>resolution, “British and American positions were not so far apart”.</p>
<p>517</p>
<p> He believed that the </p>
<p>US was misreading the implications of what UN authorisation meant and added: “It was </p>
<p>more a matter of timing than substance.”</p>
<p><b>1215.  At the UN, Mr Annan told Sir Jeremy Greenstock that he would not want to </b></p>
<p><b>see an arrangement “subjugating UN activity to Coalition activity”. </b></p>
<p><b>1216.  Mr Annan also made it clear, in public, that during any occupation it was </b></p>
<p><b>the Occupying Power that was responsible for the welfare of the people. Without </b></p>
<p><b>detracting from those responsibilities, the UN would do whatever it could to help </b></p>
<p><b>the Iraqi population.</b></p>
<p><b>1217. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock discussed post-conflict Iraq with Mr Annan on 24 March, </p>
<p>in advance of a meeting between Mr Annan and Dr Rice later in the day.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>told Mr Annan that he “assumed that the UN would not want to run Iraq nor its security </p>
<p>sector”. Mr Annan told him that “Coalition respect for Iraqi sovereignty, territorial integrity </p>

<p><b>1218. </b> After meeting Mr Annan, Sir Jeremy spoke to Mr John Negroponte, US </p>
<p>Ambassador to the UN, who observed that the focus within the Security Council on </p>

<p>authorisation.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy reminded him that without a resolution there would be </p>
<p>no IFI or other international funding for reconstruction and it would be “hard to drum up </p>
<p>troop contributors to permit an exit strategy for US/UK forces”.</p>
<p><b>1219. </b> Mr Annan told the press:</p>
<p>“… the proposal before the [Security] Council is we would want to resume our </p>
<p>work as soon as possible. And whichever authority is seen in charge at the end </p>
<p>of the hostilities, we will work with them. We don’t know what – if it is Iraqis, if it’s </p>
<p>somebody else – we will need to find a way of working, but we will be working for </p>
<p>the Security Council, in accordance with Security Council resolutions covering the </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food …</p>
<p>“… I have made it clear in my discussion with the Council and publicly, that in times </p>
<p>of war, it is the belligerents who are responsible for the welfare and safety of the </p>
<p>people. I’ve also indicated that, in any situation under occupation, it is the Occupying </p>
<p>Power that has responsibility for the welfare of the people. Without detracting from </p>
<p>those responsibilities, the UN will do whatever it can to help the Iraqi population.”</p>
<p>520</p>
<p><b>1220. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that Mr Annan managed the tension within </p>
<p>the UN between a Secretariat “full of resentment” that the UN had been “bypassed” in </p>
<p>the decision to go to war, and Mr Annan’s own view and that of some others, that the </p>
<p>UN should not be “absent from its responsibilities” in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>528</p>
<p><b>1223. </b> Lt Gen Reith produced an update on Phase IV planning for the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 21 March.</p>
<p>523</p>
<p> He warned that Phase IV delivery remained subject to “uncertain </p>
<p>US dynamics at the pol/mil [politico-military] level”. US planning continued, but was </p>
<p>“primarily bottom-up”, and CFLCC was still seeking guidance on key issues including </p>
<p>governance, payment of salaries and “regeneration” of the military.</p>
<p><b>1224. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that there were already signs that previous assumptions </p>
<p>about the nature and duration of the conflict might have been wrong. Phase IV(a) </p>
<p>now looked likely to be far shorter than previously expected, while the arrival of other </p>
<p>Coalition partners and NGOs looked like taking longer. All this added pressure. The </p>
<p>paper listed a number of issues needing resolution, pointing out that some were already </p>
<p>well known. They included: the system of governance under Phase IV(b); how to </p>
<p>approach SSR; provision of salaries to Iraqis; and how to engage with the Iraqi military </p>
<p>and judiciary. </p>
<p><b>1225. </b> On “military realities”, Lt Gen Reith stated that: “The Coalition must be prepared </p>
<p>for high/medium/low consent and variations thereof in time and space, including </p>
<p>asymmetric attack and intra-factional violence.” “How to deal with non-compliance” was </p>
<p>listed as one of the “key issues requiring resolution”. </p>
<p><b>1226. </b> In a second paper, Lt Gen Reith updated the Chiefs of Staff on humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance.</p>
<p>524</p>
<p> USAID had led the development of the CMOC/DART structure to provide </p>
<p>immediate relief as Coalition forces advanced. UK forces would draw primarily on the </p>
<p>US DART, but had developed national contingency plans in case demand outstripped </p>
<p>supply, including funding for QIPs and DFID-funded medical supplies.</p>
<p><b>1227.  On 24 March, Treasury officials advised Mr Brown that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The Chiefs of Staff considered a medium scale deployment of 10,000-</b></p>
<p><b>15,000 to be the most the UK could sustain in the medium term without </b></p>
<p><b>lasting damage to the UK’s forces.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>It was unlikely, except in the most benign post-conflict scenario, that the </b></p>
<p><b>maximum envisaged UK force would be able to deal with all the challenges </b></p>
<p><b>on its own.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>No significant Coalition partners were likely to come forward without an </b></p>
<p><b>appropriate UN resolution.</b></p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>command without “the necessary guarantees”. </b></p>

<p><b>1228. </b> Mr Dodds sent advice on the Straw/Hoon joint minute to Mr Brown on </p>
<p>24 March.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1229. </b> Mr Dodds reported that the picture looked “rather different to that presented in </p>
<p>the correspondence”:</p>
<p>“The Defence Chiefs say that a ‘medium size’ deployment (ie 10,000-15,000) is the </p>
<p>most we could sustain in the medium term without lasting damage to our forces. </p>
<p>MOD officials tell us they had intended the submission [the joint minute] to pose the </p>
<p>question ‘do you want us to do as much as we can (ie this medium size deployment) </p>
<p>or as little as we can get away with (ie less)?’ The question is not posed in that form </p>
<p>and hence is not answered. <b>The choice is essentially political, but it is essential </b></p>
<p><b>to note that the cost of a deployment on this medium scale is about £1bn </b></p>
<p><b>a</b> <b>year.</b>”</p>
<p><b>1230. </b> Mr Dodds reported that the concept of sectors in US military planning had </p>
<p>moved on:</p>
<p>“The plan now appears to have four ‘two-star commands (ie divisions)’ outside of </p>
<p>Baghdad, focusing more flexibly on the tasks that need to be done, rather than being </p>
<p>tied down to specific narrow locations.</p>
<p>“The MOD ambition is to have a UK-led ‘two-star command’. However:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the scale of military effort needed will depend on the permissiveness of the </p>
<p>environment … and the relationship between the military and civil powers;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it is unlikely, except in the most benign scenario, that the maximum </p>
<p>envisaged size of UK force would be able to deal with all the challenges … </p>
<p>on its own;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>without an appropriate UN resolution to legitimise the aftermath, MOD </p>
<p>believe it unlikely that any significant Coalition partners will come forward to </p>
<p>share our burden …”</p>
<p><b>1231. </b> Mr Dodds commented that, in that context, Mr Blair’s questions of 21 March about </p>
<p>the size of the UK sector, the duration of the UK commitment and the exit strategy were </p>
<p>“excellent questions”, but could not be answered easily. More relevant was:</p>
<p>“… how to ensure a permissive environment as quickly as possible, and how to </p>
<p>maximise the number of militarily-capable Coalition partners to share our burden. </p>
<p>“And given past experience, while going all out for a suitable resolution, it would be </p>
<p>wise to ask what our Plan B would be if we couldn’t get one. MOD currently don’t </p>
<p>have an answer to that!” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>530</p>
<p><b>1232. </b> Mr Dodds recommended that the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should continue to emphasise to the US that a further UN resolution was vital;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should stress to the US that UK military capability was stretched to the limit; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should not be too ready to take on a two-star command in the aftermath without </p>
<p>“the necessary guarantees”. It carried the risk of costs “we cannot afford both </p>
<p>militarily and financially”. This was an issue on which the Treasury disagreed </p>
<p>with the MOD. Mr Brown’s input “could be invaluable”.</p>
<p><b>1233. </b> Mr Dodds advised that Mr Brown might have a view on “whether to press for a </p>
<p>smaller commitment than the £1bn ‘medium’ scale deployment that MOD/FCO have </p>
<p>offered”.</p>
<p><b>1234. </b> Mr Dodds explained that the Treasury was feeding those thoughts into FCO </p>
<p>papers for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Camp David on 26 and 27 March. </p>
<p>He concluded that it would be useful if Mr Brown could “make an input” at Cabinet (see </p>
<p>Section 10.1).</p>
<p><b>Draft UK post-conflict objectives</b></p>
<p><b>1235.  The FCO response to Mr Blair’s request of 21 March for further advice on </b></p>
<p><b>the narrow question of the UK military contribution to post-conflict Iraq continued </b></p>
<p><b>the pre-invasion pattern of analysis and advice that separated military from </b></p>
<p><b>civilian concerns.</b></p>
<p><b>1236.  The FCO advice, which reflected Treasury concerns and had been agreed </b></p>
<p><b>with the MOD, warned of the substantial risk that, without a resolution, the UK </b></p>
<p><b>“would become trapped” into a higher level of commitment than planned. </b></p>
<p><b>1237.  The FCO advised that it would not be possible to decide on the size of a </b></p>
<p><b>UK military sector before establishing the nature of the task and the scale of the </b></p>
<p><b>Coalition resources available.</b></p>
<p><b>1238.  The FCO did not address the relationship between the size of a military </b></p>
<p><b>sector and the wider contingent liabilities, including the impact on potential UK </b></p>
<p><b>civilian responsibility for administration and reconstruction.</b></p>
<p><b>1239. </b> On 25 March, the FCO sent its response to Mr Blair’s request for further advice </p>
<p>on the size of any UK sector, the duration of the UK commitment and the exit strategy.</p>
<p>526</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1240. </b> The FCO advice, agreed with the MOD and copied to DFID and the Treasury, </p>
<p>emphasised the risk of “serious long term damage to the Armed Forces” if the UK </p>
<p>commitment was not reduced to a third of existing levels by the autumn, but stated that it </p>

<p>6.5  |  Planning and preparation for a post-Saddam Hussein Iraq, January to March 2003</p>
<p>531</p>
<p>was not possible to answer Mr Blair’s questions definitively. Reducing troop numbers by </p>
<p>the autumn and devising an exit strategy depended on a number of factors: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the outcome of the military campaign;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the attitudes of the US and the Iraqi people;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>negotiation of an authorising resolution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ability to build a broader Coalition; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>success in achieving Coalition objectives for Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1241. </b> The FCO warned:</p>
<p>“There is therefore a substantial risk that if we fail to obtain a UNSCR, we will not be </p>
<p>able to build the Coalition under overall US leadership. We would become trapped </p>
<p>into maintaining a higher level of commitment for longer, with all that this would </p>
<p>mean in terms of cost and for the long-term health of the Armed Forces.”</p>
<p><b>1242. </b> On the size of the UK sector, the FCO expanded on the advice in the Straw/Hoon </p>
<p>joint minute:</p>
<p>“… we need to determine in the first instance the nature of the military task, and </p>
<p>make an assessment of the UK and other Coalition resources likely to be available. </p>
<p>Only then can we answer the question about geographical coverage. If the task is </p>
<p>to promote a secure environment, the size of the area will depend on the number of </p>
<p>troops that are available and the attitude of the Iraqis. The expectation is that Basra, </p>
<p>and the area around it, linked to existing administrative boundaries, should be the </p>
<p>focus. Plans need to remain flexible until we are able to define the task and confirm </p>
<p>the attitude of the population. US thinking appears to have moved away from too </p>
<p>early definition of ‘sectors’ for exactly the reasons explained above.”</p>

<p>“Our objective is to create conditions for a future Iraqi government which will act to </p>
<p>make this aspiration a reality. We will work with the Iraqi people, the UN and other </p>

<p>is that the Coalition is failing to engage them in the process of their liberation …</p>
<p>“Several people have made the point to me that we need to get Iraqis visibly </p>
<p>involved on the side of the Coalition, and in whatever way is possible establish a </p>
<p>sense of partnership between the Coalition and the Iraqi population. If we do not do </p>
<p>so, we may find that we are dealing not with a jubilant population but one that says, </p>
<p>‘OK, you’ve got rid of Saddam. Now what?’ …</p>
<p>“The sense of a lack of partnership is unfortunately strengthened by our own focus </p>
<p>on the humanitarian side – handing out food, bringing in ‘aid’. Iraqis are proud and </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush, Camp David, </b></p>
<p><b>26 and 27 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>1261. </b> In advance of the meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at Camp David </p>
<p>on 26 and 27 March, Mr Straw’s Private Office sent Mr Rycroft a negotiating brief for </p>
<p>what was to become resolution 1483, the resolution defining the roles of the UN and the </p>
<p>Coalition in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>531</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1262. </b> The negotiating brief, prepared by the IPU, described what was known about the </p>
<p>“first few weeks” after the combat phases of the military campaign: </p>
<p>“Immediately after the conflict, the Coalition will be in control of Iraq. </p>
<p>“As soon as it is safe to do so, Jay Garner and his Office of Reconstruction and </p>
<p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) will arrive behind the military and become a </p>
<p>transitional administration. Their aim will be to work with the existing Iraqi public </p>
<p>administration, so far as possible. Garner will then take forward the reconstruction </p>
<p>process. His people will be inserted into the top of the Iraqi ministries, with senior </p>
<p>US officials being assigned to each ministry as ‘shadow ministers’ … </p>
<p>“ORHA is understaffed and began preparing for its task only a few weeks ago. There </p>
<p>are now some ten or so UK secondees embedded in it. Garner would like to be out </p>
<p>of Iraq within 90-120 days. Whether ORHA will be able to get any reform programme </p>
<p>started in that time is moot. This period is likely to be dominated by humanitarian </p>
<p>and security concerns.”</p>
<p><b>1263. </b> The IPU advised that ORHA and the Coalition might enjoy a “brief honeymoon”, </p>
<p>but not if the Coalition seemed set on administering Iraq for more than a brief period. </p>
<p>It was therefore necessary to put in place interim arrangements for post-conflict </p>
<p>administration that would be accepted by the Iraqi people and the Arab and Islamic </p>
<p>world.</p>
<p><b>1264. </b> A resolution was required to authorise those interim arrangements, and to provide </p>
<p>a legal basis for “reconstruction and reform”: </p>
<p>“Without a UNSCR, other countries, international organisations, the IFIs, UN </p>
<p>agencies and NGOs will be comparatively limited in what they can do … That would </p>
<p>leave US/UK with no viable exit strategy from Iraq and a huge bill.”</p>

<p>535</p>
<p><b>1265. </b> The IPU stated that the task for Camp David was to build on five areas where </p>
<p>there was already agreement between the UK and US:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Coalition, through ORHA, would be responsible for the administration of Iraq </p>
<p>for the first few weeks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN should not be asked to run Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The objective should be Security Council authorisation or endorsement for an </p>
<p>international presence that would include the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition, not UN, troops would provide security on the ground.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As soon as possible, Iraq should govern itself. </p>
<p><b>1266. </b> The differences between the UK and US positions remained significant. The IPU </p>
<p>explained that the US approach amounted to:</p>
<p>“… asking the UNSC to endorse Coalition military control over Iraq’s transitional </p>
<p>administration, its representative institutions and its revenues until such time as a </p>
<p>fully-fledged Iraqi government is ready to take over. It would marginalise the role of </p>
<p>a UN Special Co-ordinator. These ideas are a non-starter for the Security Council, </p>
<p>would be denounced by the Iraqis and the wider Arab/Islamic world, and would not </p>
<p>provide the stability needed to develop the new Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>1267. </b> The brief stated that there was “still some distance to go if we are to agree a way </p>
<p>forward to avoid an inchoate start to Phase IV”.</p>
<p><b>1268. </b> The IPU set out a number of “propositions” which it hoped Mr Blair and President </p>
<p>Bush could agree. Those propositions and the progress of the negotiations on resolution </p>
<p>1483 are addressed in Section 9.1. </p>
<p><b>1269. </b> Mr Straw sent Mr Blair an FCO paper on Phase IV issues in advance of Camp </p>
<p>David.</p>
<p>532</p>
<p> Mr Straw said that he hoped Mr Blair would counter any tendency by President </p>
<p>Bush to conclude that the UN had failed over Iraq:</p>
<p>“… the US will need to go on working through the UN, both to authorise the post-</p>
<p>conflict work in Iraq so that a wide range of countries can join the peacekeeping and </p>
<p>reconstruction effort, and to provide an exit strategy for the US/UK and because the </p>
<p>UN itself and its agencies have important expertise to offer”.</p>
<p><b>1270. </b> The FCO paper on Phase IV issues stated that, in addition to US agreement on </p>
<p>a UN resolution, the UK needed US agreement on a number of other important political, </p>
<p>humanitarian and economic issues, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Baghdad conference. The US was still thinking of a Coalition conference with </p>
<p>the UN in a supporting role. That was the wrong way round for international </p>
<p>acceptability.</p>

<p>536</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The role of the IIA. An early statement of intent to hand over power to an IIA </p>
<p>while helping the Iraqi people to build a democratic future “should go down well”. </p>
<p>The UN Special Co-ordinator should have veto power over the IIA’s decisions. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humanitarian issues. UK and US efforts were substantial: “we should play them </p>
<p>up in the media”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economic issues. After several wars and 12 years of sanctions, Iraq’s oil </p>
<p>revenues alone would not meet the “very heavy” cost of reconstruction, </p>
<p>particularly in the short term. “We need to share the burden with other developed </p>
<p>countries … But contacts with them tell us they will make <b>their contribution </b></p>
<p><b>conditional on there being an authorising UNSC resolution for Phase IV</b>.” </p>
<p>The World Bank would need to prepare a rigorous needs assessment, but that </p>
<p>too would probably need UN cover.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1271. </b> On the UK’s bilateral effort, the paper stated that Ms Short was considering where </p>
<p>the UK might help with the longer-term contribution to “reform and reconstruction”. SSR </p>
<p>and reform of the public administration were two areas where the UK had a comparative </p>
<p>advantage. UK public finances were “tight”. If the UK was to keep armed forces in Iraq, </p>
<p>“the scope for a major effort on reform and reconstruction will be limited”. </p>
<p><b>1272. </b> The paper stated that the UK’s Armed Forces were fully stretched and would </p>
<p>need to scale down to about a third of current levels by the autumn. President Bush </p>
<p>would have similar concerns:</p>
<p>“So <b>we both need an exit strategy</b>. The key to that will be to get new Coalition </p>
<p>partners, <b>which needs an authorising UNSCR</b>. US/UK officials are working up a </p>
<p>lobbying strategy. But we must be realistic. The number of countries who have real </p>
<p>capability to offer is small.”</p>

<p><b>on 26 and 27 March. </b></p>

<p>Iraq. The question about what sort of resolution was needed for the administration and </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq should be parked. Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“The time to debate this would come when we had secured victory, and were in a </p>
<p>position of strength.”</p>
<p>534</p>
<p><b>1278. </b> Mr Blair raised Phase IV issues with President Bush the next day. They </p>
<p>discussed the need to push for a quick agreement on the resolution to continue the </p>
<p>OFF programme, and for a separate resolution that would free up financial and troop </p>
<p>contributions from other nations, secure World Bank and IMF involvement and put </p>
<p>reconstruction on the right footing.</p>
<p>535</p>
<p><b>1279. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair had identified the main issue as whether </p>
<p>the UN formed the future Iraqi government or whether the Coalition did so with UN </p>
<p>endorsement, but had said that “it was not helpful to expose this distinction yet”. </p>
<p><b>1280. </b> After returning to the UK, Mr Blair told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq that in relation </p>
<p>to the post-conflict administration of Iraq, “quiet and effective diplomacy” was the tactic </p>
<p>to achieve a new resolution.</p>
<p>536</p>
<p><b>1281. </b> The process leading to the adoption of resolution 1483 in May 2003 is addressed </p>

<p><b>responsibility for reconstruction in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>1283. </b> Ms Short held a meeting with key DFID officials on 26 March at which she stated: </p>
<p>“The important thing was for the world to know that a resolution for a UN mandate was </p>
<p>coming.”</p>
<p>537</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1284. </b> At the meeting, officials reported a sense in Whitehall that a resolution </p>
<p>on reconstruction might not be achieved. Ms Short made clear that “significant </p>
<p>engagement” on reconstruction would need a UN resolution. The Attorney General </p>
<p>had been clear at Mr Blair’s meeting that morning that, under the Geneva and Hague </p>
<p>Conventions, no changes could be made to the administration by the Occupying </p>
<p>Powers, except to keep systems working for civilians. Ms Short asked her office to </p>
<p>request that the Attorney General’s advice be committed to paper. </p>
<p><b>1285. </b> Ms Short reported that “the Prime Minister had given her responsibility for </p>

<p><b>1291. </b> Mr Fernie explained that the draft had been revised to take account of comments </p>
<p>from Ms Short on:</p>
<p>“… getting the multilateral system working to support Iraqi institutions, the </p>
<p>importance of sustainable debt and reparations strategy, and focusing on using and </p>
<p>developing Iraqi talent rather than bringing in too many international consultants”. </p>
<p><b>1292. </b> Comments had also been received from the FCO, The Treasury and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office. Those centred on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What we would do if there were no UNSCR authorising reconstruction.” </p>
<p>Mr Fernie advised that, with the Attorney General’s advice now in writing, </p>
<p>“we should stick to our position that without an SCR the UK can only support </p>
<p>humanitarian relief and basic civil administration reform to ensure public </p>

<p>reconstruction fitted with the UK’s overall approach to rebuilding Iraq and securing </p>

<p>Mubarak</p>

<p> who warned of unleashing 100 Bin Ladens. The combination of </p>
<p>an undefeated Ba’athist regime melting away and coming back as a gradually </p>
<p>more potent insurgency combined with the attractiveness of Iraq as a means for </p>
<p>international terrorists under the umbrella of Al Qaida to have a go at the Americans, </p>
<p>combined with Shia extremists supported from Iran, this combination creating the </p>
<p>level of violence, the onslaught of violence that I have mentioned, this was not </p>
<p>thought through by any observer. </p>
<p>“I think had we known the scale of violence, it might well have led to second </p>
<p>thoughts about the entire project. And we could certainly have mitigated some </p>
<p>aspects of it had we had a clearer appreciation of it in advance …</p>
<p>“But I don’t think it is reasonable to assume that we should have predicted all this </p>
<p>violence in advance, because very few people did actually do that. That wasn’t </p>
<p>the anticipated scenario that we were stepping into and it was an unprecedented </p>
<p>scenario that we found ourselves in.”</p>
<p>548</p>
<p><b>1307. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that a number of assumptions had been made about </p>
<p>the state of Iraq after the invasion, which, with the benefit of hindsight, were “probably </p>
<p>optimistic, to say the least”.</p>
<p>549</p>
<p> There had been: </p>
<p>“… an expectation that we would find more of a structure which was ready to step </p>
<p>into place than actually turned out to be the case in May [2003], even before the </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification and the disbandment of the Iraqi army …”</p>
<p><b>1308.  Mr Lee told the Inquiry that the Government had identified many of the </b></p>

<p><b>1309. </b> Mr Lee commented on the UK’s failure to build on its own analytical platform:</p>
<p>“I think there is a valid criticism that on the one hand we had identified an awful lot </p>
<p>of these problems, and had identified quite explicitly, as I recall, the question of the </p>
<p>aftermath as a crucial element of the campaign overall, and the whole concept of a </p>
<p>successful campaign and winning including a successful outcome to that … </p>
<p>“But we didn’t actually carry that through … into an analysis at the time of what </p>
<p>the post-conflict plans actually were on the level of uncertainty that remained, and </p>
<p>therefore the level of risk that remained, in the plan on those issues …”</p>

<p>543</p>
<p><b>1310. </b> Mr Lee told the Inquiry that the question of whether the post-conflict period </p>
<p>carried too much uncertainty to risk embarking on the conflict had never been asked </p>
<p>in those terms: </p>
<p>“… however much you intellectually or analytically describe the wider campaign, </p>
<p>psychologically the focus is on the conflict itself. A certain amount of … optimism, </p>
<p>hope, creeps in in respect of the aftermath. That will be sorted out, and there are too </p>
<p>many things unknown there to do too much more planning. Therefore you go ahead </p>
<p>and hope that you’ve got enough of a structure which can then be supplemented by </p>
<p>ad hoc arrangements afterwards, and therefore it will all be sorted out. </p>
<p>“I think, as we know, in practice it turned out to be a lot more difficult than we thought </p>
<p>at the time.”</p>
<p><b>1311.  Several witnesses highlighted the breakdown in US inter-agency </b></p>
<p><b>co-ordination as a significant obstacle to effective planning.</b></p>
<p><b>1312.  Mr Straw described it as “the fundamental problem”.</b></p>
<p><b>1313. </b> In his statement, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“There was interaction at every level between the UK and the US system. Some </p>
<p>of that, as evidence to the Inquiry makes clear, was unsatisfactory, due mainly </p>
<p>to inter-agency issues in the US. It is correct also that the shift from the State </p>
<p>Department to the Department of Defense in January 2003 made a difference. </p>
<p>The shortcomings of the US planning have been well documented and accepted. </p>
<p>Our own planning was complicated both by the difficulties of being fully inserted into </p>
<p>the US system and the fact that the planning was taking place against the backdrop </p>
<p>of fast-changing political and military plans.”</p>
<p>551</p>
<p><b>1314. </b> Mr Straw went further in directly attributing difficulties with UK planning to the </p>
<p>situation in the US. He told the Inquiry that “a significant number of the problems we </p>
<p>faced … could have been avoided by better planning and co-ordination, above all </p>
<p>in Washington”.</p>
<p>552</p>
<p> The UK “got caught up in internal administration politics”, but that </p>
<p>“didn’t become completely clear until after the invasion”.</p>
<p>553</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1315. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>

<p>544</p>
<p><b>1316. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry that the state of US planning had been “one of a </p>
<p>number of concerns as the peace process ended and the conflict loomed”.</p>
<p>555</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“I do think, if the careful State Department work had been allowed to feed through </p>
<p>into operational planning for the post-conflict phase, that would have been more </p>
<p>successful. I think it would have been easier for us to dock with it, and the overall </p>
<p>effect on the ground would … have been a stronger operation from earlier on.”</p>
<p>556</p>
<p><b>1317.  A number of witnesses to the Inquiry commented on the difficulty the UK </b></p>
<p><b>faced in trying to influence the US.</b></p>
<p><b>1318. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… was insistent throughout that a lot of thought needed to be given to what </p>
<p>happened on what has been called ‘the morning after’. He raised that with the </p>
<p>President. This was raised by, I think, most British interlocutors with their American </p>
<p>interlocutors. </p>
<p>“I don’t think I could say to you that that was a condition in the end when the UN </p>
<p>route failed for military action, but it was certainly something that was important </p>
<p>to him.”</p>
<p>557</p>
<p><b>1319. </b> Sir David also told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister throughout is very clear that there has to be a clever plan </p>
<p>afterwards, the UN have to be involved, and you can’t do this simply as a military </p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>“The second thing he is absolutely insistent … [on] is the Middle East peace </p>
<p>process. </p>
<p>“So I think he is very clear that it isn’t just a military operation, but getting the </p>
<p>American machine to respond to this proves to be enormously difficult.”</p>
<p>558</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1320. </b> Sir David added:</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether the Prime Minister discussed a blueprint for Iraq – I don’t </p>
<p>think he did, I don’t recall it – with the President. He might have done in his private </p>
<p>conversations. But insisting that they had to think about what came next, insisting </p>
<p>on the importance of having the UN in there, he was very clear about that. And </p>
<p>I suppose the fact that the Americans were doing a lot of planning for Iraq was a </p>
<p>reassurance to him.”</p>

<p>545</p>
<p><b>1321. </b> Asked at what stage the UK would have needed to exert its influence in </p>
<p>Washington for post-conflict planning to have been more effective, Sir Christopher Meyer </p>
<p>told the Inquiry: “if the Americans had their act together in September/October [2002], </p>
<p>and we did likewise, then you could have done it”.</p>
<p>560</p>
<p><b>1322. </b> Mr Chaplin stated that Ministers “constantly stressed to their American opposite </p>
<p>numbers the need for proper aftermath planning”, but the US was “obviously going to </p>
<p>be the greater partner of this enterprise and we were going to be the junior partner”.</p>
<p>561</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1323. </b> Mr Chaplin added:</p>
<p>“The message … we constantly got from the American side, particularly those that </p>
<p>were frustrated with the lack of planning, as they saw it, was, ‘Please, could we </p>
<p>make this clearer at a higher level in the US administration?’ Colin Powell didn’t </p>
<p>need to be convinced, but President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld did.”</p>
<p><b>1324. </b> Mr Chaplin explained that the UK response had been “to keep feeding in the </p>
<p>ideas of what we thought was the sensible way ahead on the issues” and to provide </p>
<p>“people to sit alongside the US opposite numbers, in particular, General Tim Cross”.</p>
<p><b>1325. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Cross suggested that UK efforts to exert </p>
<p>influence on US thinking achieved little: “I got no sense of UK pressure on the US; no </p>
<p>‘demands’ for clarity over the intended ‘End State’ or the planning to achieve it.”</p>
<p>562</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1326. </b> Maj Gen Cross provided an example of his own difficulties in influencing US </p>
<p>thinking during his time in Washington in February and March 2003.</p>
<p>563</p>
<p> At a lunch with </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld and others, he had challenged the assumption that the overthrow of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would be greeted with such relief in Iraq that the US would be able to </p>
<p>move on quickly: </p>
<p>“I argued that this was, perhaps, fine as a Plan ‘A’ – but what was desperately </p>
<p>needed was a Plan ‘B’ and a Plan ‘C’, and a recognition that what would probably </p>
<p>emerge would be an amalgam of the last two. It was made clear that my views were </p>
<p>not welcomed.”</p>
<p><b>1327. </b> Mr Chilcott told the Inquiry: “we could have any number of variations of our own </p>
<p>plan, but what mattered was influencing the American plan, and that was where our </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>546</p>
<p><b>1329. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether the FCO had been slow to recognise the inevitability </p>
<p>of conflict and whether, as a result, it had been too late to make full preparations for </p>
<p>what was going to happen, Lord Jay responded:</p>
<p>“I think there are two points there … There is, was it our judgment that, whatever </p>
<p>happened, the Americans were likely to go to war in Iraq and, secondly, if they did, </p>
<p>was it inevitable that we should join them?</p>
<p>“On the first point … I would not put it as inevitable. I think I would say it was … </p>
<p>certainly towards the end of 2002 quite difficult to see the scenario in which the </p>
<p>Americans would conclude that they would not try to seek Saddam Hussein by force. </p>
<p>I don’t think it was inevitable. It was always possible that Saddam Hussein could </p>
<p>go … That would clearly have been preferable. </p>
<p>“I would never say that conflict was inevitable. I would say that, from the end of </p>
<p>2002 onwards, it was probable. There was a separate question as to whether Britain </p>
<p>would take part in that. When one looks back on it now, with all that has been said </p>
<p>since then, the inevitability of Britain taking part seems much greater than it did at </p>
<p>the time. It did not seem clear at the end of 2002 and the beginning of 2003 … it did </p>
<p>not seem clear to us in the Foreign Office, that a British participation in the conflict </p>
<p>was inevitable. There was an option not to take part in it.”</p>
<p>565</p>
<p><b>1330. </b> Lord Jay suggested that it was “an extremely difficult thing to do in the minds of </p>
<p>the same people, to try to prevent something happening and to prepare for that failure </p>
<p>and I don’t think we had the structures available to us to do that”.</p>
<p><b>1331. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“All along, right through to the eve of the second resolution, I thought it was possible, </p>
<p>perhaps not likely, but possible, that Saddam Hussein would choose, rather than </p>
<p>face overwhelming military force, to co-operate and comply. So it was never for sure </p>
<p>that the UK would be part of military operations or even really that military operations </p>
<p>were inevitable. I always thought there was another option.”</p>
<p>566</p>
<p><b>1332. </b> On the role of the UN, Sir Peter stated:</p>
<p>“In Kosovo, we had had a UN-led transitional administration, building on existing </p>
<p>structures there. In Afghanistan, we had had a very strong UN presence led by </p>
<p>Mr Brahimi,</p>
<p>567</p>
<p> supporting a Loya Jirga, and then a domestic process, and so we </p>
<p>approached it in the same frame of mind, that the UN had real experience in dealing </p>

<p>with post-conflict situations, a unique legitimacy in doing so and that was our </p>
<p>preferred route.”</p>
<p>568</p>
<p><b>1333. </b> Sir Peter added that the FCO was:</p>
<p>“… very doubtful indeed about the neo-con assumption that international forces would </p>
<p>be welcomed as liberators and … that somehow very quickly Iraqi political life would </p>
<p>resume and the occupying forces would not carry these responsibilities … We warned </p>
<p>Ministers that this would be a long period of post-conflict work for the international </p>
<p>community, which is why we then said that we thought it was important that, if </p>
<p>possible, the UN should take on the lead.”</p>
<p>569</p>
<p><b>1334. </b> Mr Chilcott commented that, in the IPU:</p>
<p>“… because it was contingency planning, because right up until the last moment </p>
<p>we didn’t know for sure that we were going to be involved in the military action, that </p>
<p>maybe psychologically had an effect on us …”</p>
<p>570</p>
<p><b>1335.  Witnesses commented on the responsibilities and priorities of different </b></p>
<p><b>departments. </b></p>
<p><b>1336. </b> Ms Short stated that DFID “got down to planning against all eventualities within </p>
<p>the difficult atmosphere we had in Whitehall about communications”.</p>
<p>571</p>
<p> The principal </p>
<p>planning failure had been the UK and US military’s failure to plan for “catastrophic </p>
<p>success”.</p>
<p>572</p>
<p> Rapid military success followed by ethnic conflict had been foreseen </p>
<p>as a risk, but the military “didn’t prepare for their Geneva Convention obligations” of </p>
<p>keeping order and providing basic humanitarian relief.</p>

<p><b>1337. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti saw the FCO as the natural lead department for  </p>

<p>574</p>
<p> He commented that the FCO was “more focused on the </p>
<p>second resolution than planning for the day after … There was a vision for Iraq that </p>
<p>I think the Foreign Office put together … So there was thinking going on, but, yes, </p>
<p>second resolution was the main issue in their minds, no doubt.”</p>
<p><b>1338. </b> Lord Jay told the Inquiry that “the FCO and DFID were not on the same page </p>
<p>in the lead-up to the war … because … there were differences between our Ministers </p>
<p>on the desirability and the likelihood of war … What we were faced with … was not </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>548</p>
<p><b>1339. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that “the so-called comprehensive concept did </p>
<p>exist in Whitehall, the idea that we needed to have integrated planning to bring all the </p>
<p>instruments of government to bear on the issue … and we certainly had transparency”, </p>
<p>but argued that this was very difficult to achieve quickly across different departmental </p>
<p>cultures.</p>
<p>576</p>
<p><b>1340. </b> Sir Kevin added: “I always felt that we could not quite get other departments to </p>
<p>share the urgency that we felt in the Ministry of Defence in terms of their own planning </p>
<p>with us.”</p>
<p><b>1341. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that the MOD did not consider that it was its role to </p>
<p>take the lead on post-conflict issues: “It was something that possibly should have been </p>
<p>done by the Foreign Office or even DFID.”</p>
<p>577</p>
<p><b>1342.  Witnesses offered differing views on whether the Government’s </b></p>
<p><b>performance would have been improved by the appointment of a senior individual </b></p>
<p><b>responsible for directing post-conflict planning or the earlier introduction of better </b></p>
<p><b>planning machinery. </b></p>
<p><b>1343. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether UK planning could have been better, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“I do accept that, yes … If we were sitting down today, now, if we were in a situation </p>
<p>of nation-building again, I think there are changes in our approach that certainly </p>
<p>should be done …</p>
<p>“I think … the real issue is what you focus on less than the structure; in other words, </p>
<p>you could say that we should have had one Minister focusing on the pre-planning, </p>
<p>but I would debate that actually, but you may conclude that … The core of the </p>
<p>problem was the focus of what that planning was.”</p>
<p>578</p>
<p><b>1344. </b> Lord Turnbull shared Mr Blair’s view that the absence of Ministerial oversight was </p>
<p>not necessarily the “real issue”.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p> Asked about the absence of an individual or body </p>
<p>with overall responsibility for planning, he argued that, although there was no “single </p>
<p>controlling mind” and co-ordination should have been better, this was “not material to </p>
<p>the outcome”.</p>
<p><b>1345. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti took a different view. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… it would have been better to have had the IPU earlier, firstly, and, secondly, </p>

<p>and although we did begin serious thinking about the day after in the preceding </p>
<p>October … we could have created the IPU earlier. We could have had a greater </p>
<p>sense of the reality of what we were doing.”</p>
<p>582</p>
<p><b>1347.  A number of witnesses commented on the Government’s focus on </b></p>
<p><b>humanitarian preparations at the expense of other post-conflict issues. </b></p>
<p><b>1348. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The over-riding concern was the humanitarian fall-out from conflict, together with </p>
<p>the potential damage, from firing oil wells to the environment and WMD attacks.”</p>
<p>583</p>
<p><b>1349. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… we had anticipated the problem of a humanitarian crisis sufficiently well that, on </p>
<p>the whole, we were able to avoid that, which was good. What we had not anticipated </p>
<p>was the extent of the inefficacy of ORHA …”</p>
<p>584</p>
<p><b>1350. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that, although the UK prepared for the worst case on </p>
<p>the humanitarian front, it failed to anticipate the collapse of civil order: “The real problem </p>
<p>was security and we probably spent too much time on humanitarian … if we didn’t </p>
<p>establish security, nothing else counted for anything.”</p>
<p>585</p>
<p><b>1351. </b> Similarly, Lord Boyce stated:</p>
<p>“First of all, we recognised there could very well be a humanitarian problem … and </p>
<p>a lot of our focus was I think at the humanitarian level rather than the governance of </p>
<p>the country, in other words, picking up the point about law and order and so forth …</p>
<p>“I think that we probably took too narrow a view about what might be required in the </p>
<p>aftermath in terms of the governance aspects of life.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>550</p>
<p><b>1352.  Witnesses identified a number of lessons, including the need to:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>assume the worst;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>understand the underlying nature of the society;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>seek maximum legitimacy and maximum support; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>identify the resources needed.</b></p>
<p><b>1353. </b> In his additional statement to the Inquiry on planning lessons learned, </p>
<p>Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Where military action is to remove the regime of a corrupted and brutal state, </p>
<p>assume the worst about its capacity, its governing infrastructure and the integrity </p>
<p>of its Government systems. There will be nation-building and governance capacity </p>
<p>required to be established over a significant time period …</p>
<p>“… the challenge confronting any nation when a powerful, all encompassing grip </p>
<p>is taken away, is formidable. There are powerful, interacting religious and tribal </p>
<p>elements and influences. These are hard to manage. Everything we take for granted </p>
<p>in our countries in government, public services, institutions and even private sector </p>
<p>has to be built or at a minimum, substantially reformed. We simply do not have the </p>
<p>international capacity to do this. It needs to be grown …</p>
<p>“The planning for any aftermath should go deep into an analysis not only of </p>
<p>government and governing structures and the readily available information and data, </p>
<p>but into the underlying nature of the society, the impact particularly of the regime’s </p>
<p>brutality and corruption on the social and business capital of the country and any </p>
<p>cross currents to do with religious, tribal or other affiliation, as they have been </p>
<p>affected by the regime …</p>
<p>“The number and nature of forces required for the aftermath of regime change may </p>
<p>be radically different from those required for the removal of the regime, in scale, </p>
<p>in type of training, in force posture and deployment. These really are genuinely </p>
<p>separate missions and should be treated as such …”</p>
<p>587</p>
<p><b>1354. </b> Asked whether more effort should have been put into planning for different </p>
<p>post-conflict scenarios, Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It is always possible to say that one could do more. I think we needed a plan that </p>
<p>was sufficiently flexible to respond to any scenario that arose after the conflict.”</p>
<p>588</p>
<p><b>1355. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… the main lesson learned was you have to have a strategy and have a proper </p>
<p>plan. You do a lot more preparatory work than was done in this case … and crucial </p>

<p>therefore maximum support …</p>
<p>“When you have done all that … you need to identify the resources that are </p>
<p>necessary to carry that out.”</p>
<p>589</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>1356.  Clear warnings were given before the invasion of Iraq about the potential </b></p>
<p><b>for post-conflict political disintegration and extremist violence, the inadequacy </b></p>
<p><b>of US post-conflict planning and the risk that, in the absence of UN authorisation, </b></p>
<p><b>additional international support would not be forthcoming. </b></p>
<p><b>1357.  Despite those warnings, the Government failed to ensure that the UK </b></p>
<p><b>was adequately prepared for the range of circumstances it might encounter in </b></p>
<p><b>southern Iraq in the short, medium and long term.</b></p>
<p><b>1358.  The Inquiry does not conclude that better planning and preparation would </b></p>
<p><b>necessarily have prevented the events that unfolded in Iraq between 2003 and </b></p>
<p><b>2009, described in Sections 9 and 10, nor that it would have been possible to </b></p>
<p><b>prepare for every eventuality. Better plans and preparation, however, could have </b></p>
<p><b>mitigated some of the risks to which the UK and Iraq were exposed, and increased </b></p>
<p><b>the likelihood of achieving the outcomes desired by the UK and the Iraqi people.</b></p>
<p><b>1359.  The lessons identified by the Inquiry in relation to both the planning </b></p>
<p><b>and preparation for post-conflict operations and to post-conflict operations </b></p>
<p><b>themselves are set out in Section 10.4. </b></p>
<p><b>What was known on the eve of the invasion</b></p>
<p><b>1360.  The evidence described earlier in this Section shows that, although there </b></p>
<p><b>were large gaps in the information on Saddam Hussein’s Iraq available to the UK </b></p>
<p><b>Government before the invasion, much was known about the state of the country </b></p>
<p><b>and the possible impact of military action. </b></p>
<p><b>1361.  The degraded state of Iraq’s infrastructure was recognised by UK analysts </b></p>
<p><b>in January 2002 and was known to Mr Blair by the end of July 2002. </b></p>
<p><b>1362. </b> The most comprehensive pre-invasion report on the state of Iraq’s infrastructure </p>
<p>was the DIS paper of mid-January 2002, seen by Mr Blair at the end of July 2002.</p>
<p>590</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With the exception of road and rail transport, the situation described in the paper was </p>
<p>comprehensively bleak. The DIS assessed that Iraq’s theoretical power generation </p>
<p>capacity was about 10,000 megawatts (MW), but that the “practical limit” was about </p>
<p>5,000 MW, well below “even the most basic demand”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>552</p>
<p><b>1363. </b> The potential consequences of Iraq’s poor infrastructure for post-conflict </p>
<p>operations were identified in the 4 September edition of the SPG paper on military </p>
<p>strategic thinking, which stated: </p>
<p>“Given fractious nature of Iraqi politics, broad regional concern on nature of </p>
<p>new Iraqi government, and poor state of Iraqi infrastructure, delivery of stated  </p>
<p>post-conflict objectives will require lengthy engagement.”</p>
<p>591</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1364. </b> The 30 September edition of the SPG paper stated that Iraqi infrastructure was </p>
<p>“poorly maintained by the current regime with damage from the war of 1991 still not </p>
<p>repaired”.</p>
<p>592</p>
<p><b>1365. </b> The FCO paper ‘Models for Administering a Post-Saddam Iraq’, presented to the </p>
<p>AHGI on 11 October, stated that administering Iraq would involve restoration of critical </p>
<p>infrastructure.</p>
<p>593</p>
<p><b>1366. </b> The Cabinet Office paper on models for Iraq after Saddam Hussein, sent to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 1 November, listed priorities facing the transitional military </p>
<p>government to be established by the Coalition after the collapse of the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>594</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those included emergency work on infrastructure involving close co-ordination with </p>
<p>civilian development agencies.</p>
<p><b>1367.  The implications of the fragile state of Iraq’s infrastructure for the Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>people and for achieving post-conflict objectives were clearly stated in an </b></p>
<p><b>FCO paper for the AHGI in November 2002 and by Ms Short in Parliament on </b></p>
<p><b>30 January 2003. </b></p>
<p><b>1368. </b> The FCO paper on economic issues in Iraq, sent to AHGI members on </p>
<p>4 November 2002, described Iraq’s economy as “distorted and very badly damaged”.</p>
<p>595</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FCO stated:</p>
<p>“Even if a new conflict produces little additional damage, the combination of neglect </p>
<p>and war damage means that large investments in many areas and spread over </p>
<p>many years, are needed if infrastructure and services are to recover even to their </p>
<p>pre-1990 condition. Getting this process under way will be essential to economic </p>
<p>revival, to the alleviation of humanitarian problems and to popular support for a new </p>

<p><b>1369. </b> Ms Short told the House of Commons on 30 January 2003 that Iraq’s </p>
<p>infrastructure was:</p>
<p>“… in chronic disrepair. Hospitals, clinics, sanitation facilities and water treatment </p>
<p>plants suffer from a terrible lack of maintenance. The result is that the Iraqi people’s </p>
<p>lives are perilously fragile. Their coping strategies have worn away by years of </p>
<p>misrule. The public facilities to help them cope are run down, often to the point </p>
<p>of uselessness.”</p>
<p>596</p>
<p><b>1370.  Papers written in the weeks before the invasion and concerned with the </b></p>
<p><b>military objective of minimising further damage during conflict did not address </b></p>
<p><b>the risk to Coalition objectives represented by the underlying fragility of Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>infrastructure.</b></p>
<p><b>1371. </b> Mr Drummond’s paper on “winning the peace”, sent to Sir David Manning on </p>
<p>14 February 2003, stated that Coalition Forces could expect to find an Iraq with certain </p>
<p>“broad characteristics”, including damage to key infrastructure, but “perhaps less than </p>
<p>other conflicts if the campaign is quick”.</p>
<p>597</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1372. </b> The Military Campaign Objectives published on 20 March, stated that, in aiming </p>
<p>to achieve the objective as swiftly as possible, the military was required to make </p>
<p>“every effort … to minimise civilian casualties and damage to essential economic </p>
<p>infrastructure”.</p>
<p>598</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1373. </b> The seven immediate military priorities in the aftermath of hostilities listed in the </p>

<p><b>1374. </b> Section 6.2 addresses military planners’ efforts to minimise damage to Iraq’s </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>554</p>
<p><b>1378.  Because the Ba’ath Party was closely intertwined with Iraq’s bureaucracy, </b></p>
<p><b>the failure of the US and UK to agree an approach to de-Ba’athification </b></p>
<p><b>compounded uncertainty about how the bureaucracy might perform after </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein’s departure.</b></p>
<p><b>1379. </b> In January 2002, the DIS stated that the Ba’ath Party, the Iraqi civil bureaucracy </p>
<p>and the armed forces were intertwined: “any ‘regime insider’ succeeding Saddam </p>
<p>would find the functional roles of the Party indispensable in administering the state and </p>
<p>controlling the populace”.</p>
<p>600</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1380. </b> The DIS paper was included in Mr Blair’s summer reading pack at the end of July.</p>
<p><b>1381. </b> The DFID ‘Northern Iraq Desktop Review’, circulated within DFID on 8 August, </p>
<p>stated that many civil servants had resorted to alternative sources of income or left the </p>
<p>country in order to secure a stable income.</p>
<p>601</p>
<p><b>1382. </b> The FCO paper ‘Scenarios for the future of Iraq after Saddam’, sent to No.10 </p>
<p>on 26 September, stated that it was difficult to judge the extent to which government </p>
<p>structures would survive Saddam Hussein’s departure:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The national Ba’ath superstructure would almost certainly collapse if Saddam </p>
<p>fell as a result of military action, with the leadership seeking refuge. At lower </p>
<p>levels, Ba’ath structures might continue”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Local power lay with the Ba’ath Party leadership. The limited supporting </p>
<p>bureaucracy was unlikely to be able to take on a more extensive role “without a </p>
<p>radical overhaul”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein fell, particularly after US-led military action, “tribal, regional </p>
<p>and religious differences would probably come to the fore”.</p>
<p>602</p>
<p><b>1383. </b> The “aftermath” section of the 30 September edition of the SPG paper on UK </p>
<p>military strategic thinking raised concerns about the US approach to de-Ba’athification, </p>
<p>which could run counter to the need for basic governance and increase post-conflict </p>
<p>reliance on the external authority.</p>
<p>603</p>
<p><b>1384. </b> The FCO paper ‘International Administration for Iraq: what, who and how?’, sent </p>
<p>to the AHGI on 18 October, assessed that, if Saddam Hussein were overthrown quickly </p>
<p>or “the bulk of Ba’ath apparatchiks switched sides”, a “light” approach to international </p>
<p>administration might be possible, monitoring a local administration’s decisions against </p>

<p>principles set out in a mandate provided by the Security Council.</p>
<p>604</p>
<p> If the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>fought to the end or the damage to Iraq was extensive, the international administration </p>
<p>would need to assume control of key areas. </p>
<p><b>1385. </b> The importance of a “structural analysis of the Iraqi system and the need for </p>
<p>reform” was one of seven key judgements in the 6 November edition of the SPG paper </p>
<p>on strategic military thinking, which stated that current FCO and DFID papers had </p>
<p>revealed “key gaps in our knowledge”.</p>
<p>605</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1386. </b> The SPG stated that a “balance must be struck between the competing demands </p>
<p>for reform and removal of Ba’athist influence and the need for effective administration”. </p>
<p>There needed to be a “detailed structural analysis of the current regime, its instruments </p>
<p>of state power and its administration”.</p>
<p><b>1387. </b> Mr Drummond, a member of the UK delegation to the talks on post-conflict </p>
<p>issues in Washington on 6 November, made a similar point to Sir David Manning.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>reported that, where the UK assumed the Iraqi Government would need “radical reform”, </p>
<p>including removal of “the pervasive influence of the Ba’ath Party”, the US believed </p>
<p>“reasonably competent ministries” remained beneath permanent secretary level and </p>
<p>that, because the Ba’ath Party operated as a parallel structure to government below that </p>
<p>level, “less radical change is needed”. Mr Drummond suggested that both the UK and </p>
<p>US Governments would need to develop and test their thinking more thoroughly. </p>
<p><b>1388. </b> At Mr Blair’s seminar with academics on 19 November, points made in discussion </p>
<p>included that there would be difficult decisions on the extent of co-operation with existing </p>
<p>structures, including the Ba’ath Party. Views differed on whether the Ba’ath Party would </p>
<p>survive Saddam Hussein’s downfall.</p>
<p>607</p>
<p><b>1389. </b> The FCO paper on interim administrations, shared with the US on 12 December, </p>
<p>stated: </p>
<p>“… Iraq has a reputation for being one of the better-run Arab countries with a  </p>
<p>well-educated civil service. But we have little first hand evidence of how things </p>
<p>work nowadays. We need more information …”</p>
<p>608</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1390. </b> Officials were reported to be working with academics, the Iraqi exile community </p>
<p>and diplomatic posts to tackle a number of questions, including: “To what extent are </p>

<p> Many ministries might be turned </p>

<p><b>1392. </b> Briefing for Mr Hoon’s discussion of post-conflict issues with Dr Rice and </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld on 12 February listed eight “Key Gaps/US-UK policy differences” </p>
<p>on post-conflict planning, including on de-Ba’athification:</p>
<p>“Is it the US aim to de-Saddam, or de-Ba’ath Iraq? If the latter, how much of the </p>
<p>party structure do we wish to remove? In the short term, and in the long term? What </p>
<p>level of compromise/co-operation with Iraqi officialdom will be necessary and/or </p>
<p>acceptable in the early stages of Phase IV? Depending on the US intention, can they </p>
<p>provide UK forces with means of identifying particular officials for removal from office </p>
<p>or detention? How will the Coalition process those removed from office? … How will </p>

<p>610</p>
<p><b>1393. </b> The 19 February JIC Assessment ‘Southern Iraq: What’s in Store?’ stated that </p>
<p>the only networks of influence in the South outside the Ba’ath Party were the tribes and </p>

<p>611</p>
<p> The external opposition would try to assert </p>

<p> Iraq was held together by a strong security apparatus. It would require </p>
<p>considerable force to break the security structure, but when that happened the regime </p>
<p>would “shatter”. Among the military tasks for the first six months would be the provision </p>
<p>of external and internal security, and law and order, “to prevent any potential for </p>
<p>inter-ethnic violence”.</p>
<p><b>1403. </b> On 15 January 2003, Mr Blair told the Chiefs of Staff “the ‘Issue’ was aftermath – </p>
<p>the Coalition must prevent anarchy and internecine fighting breaking out”.</p>

<p> He asked </p>
<p>the MOD to look at the big “what ifs”, including internecine fighting, and to develop a </p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p><b>1404. </b> The annotated agenda for the second round of talks on post-conflict issues on </p>
<p>22 January stated that establishing a secure environment would be an urgent task and: </p>
<p>“We shall also want to prevent internecine violence. Our handling of the defeated Iraqi </p>
<p>forces will be critical.”</p>
<p><b>1405. </b> Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush on 24 January stated that the biggest risk they </p>
<p>faced was internecine fighting in Iraq when a military strike destabilised the regime.</p>
<p>617</p>
<p><b>1406. </b> The JIC Assessment of 19 February stated that there were “large numbers </p>

<p> It was “almost certain that political Islam would become more </p>

<p>“Success in the endgame – providing a secure environment for the remaking of the </p>

<p>560</p>
<p><b>1422. </b> In February 2002, Mr Sawers identified a number of questions that would need </p>
<p>asking of the US if the UK associated itself with a policy of regime change, including: </p>
<p>“How would we keep the Iranians from meddling?”</p>
<p> 628</p>
<p><b>1423. </b> On 5 August, the JIC assessed that, after a US attack began, “Iran would </p>
<p>probably boost its support for Shia groups working against Saddam”. The Islamic </p>
<p>Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) “would be likely to work directly to undermine </p>
<p>US influence, eg by manipulating Iraqi groups through propaganda and the selective </p>
<p>provision of money and arms, although it would not provoke anything that would provoke </p>
<p>US military retaliation”.</p>
<p>629</p>
<p><b>1424. </b> In September, Mr Chaplin wrote in an internal FCO minute that the job of </p>
<p>the Coalition would be to ensure stability, including “preventing interference from </p>
<p>neighbours, especially Iran”.</p>
<p>630</p>
<p><b>1425. </b> The FCO paper ‘Scenarios for the future of Iraq after Saddam’, sent to No.10 </p>
<p>on 26 September, judged that Iraq’s neighbours might find it difficult not to get sucked </p>
<p>in, and included an explicit reference to Iran as the neighbour most likely to become </p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p>631</p>
<p><b>1426. </b> Mr Hoon’s advice to Mr Blair on 16 January 2003 stated that the UK military plan </p>
<p>would need further development to address a number of specific challenges, including </p>
<p>“handling Iran”.</p>
<p>632</p>
<p><b>1427. </b> The 19 February JIC Assessment ‘Southern Iraq: What’s in Store?’ stated that </p>
<p>Iran might support small-scale cross-border interventions by armed groups and that </p>
<p>the IRGC would “continue to meddle in southern Iraq”. Iranian reactions to a Coalition </p>
<p>presence in southern Iraq were unclear, but “unlikely to be aggressive”.</p>
<p>633</p>
<p> Iran’s aims </p>
<p>in response to a Coalition presence in Iraq included ensuring a leading role for its allies </p>
<p>among the Iraqi Shia (the Supreme Council for an Islamic Revolution in Iraq (SCIRI) and </p>
<p>its armed wing the Badr Corps).</p>
<p><b>1428. </b> In response to a request from Mr Blair for advice on the implications of the JIC </p>
<p>Assessment and the Adelphi Paper, the FCO advised that the key to preventing a Shia </p>
<p>uprising would be:</p>
<p>“… to assure the varied Shia communities that they will be fairly represented in </p>
<p>future Iraq … Much will also depend on the length of a Coalition ‘occupation’. </p>

<p><b>1430.  It showed that, in order to achieve the UK’s desired end state, any </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict administration would need to:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>restore infrastructure that had deteriorated significantly in the decade </b></p>
<p><b>since 1991, to the point where it was not capable of meeting the needs of </b></p>
<p><b>the Iraqi people;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>administer a state where the upper echelons of a regime that had been in </b></p>
<p><b>power since 1968 had been abruptly removed and in which the capabilities </b></p>
<p><b>of the wider civil administration, many of whose employees were members </b></p>

<p><b> But when the invasion began, the UK Government </b></p>

<p><b>preparations made to meet known post-conflict challenges and risks in Iraq and </b></p>
<p><b>to mitigate the risk of strategic failure.</b></p>
<p><b>1432.  Throughout the planning process, the UK assumed that the US would be </b></p>

<p><b>be authorised by the UN Security Council, that agreement would be reached on a </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>562</p>
<p><b>1433.  On that basis, the UK planned to reduce its military contribution in Iraq to </b></p>
<p><b>medium scale within four months of the start of the invasion</b></p>
<p>636</p>
<p><b> and expected not </b></p>
<p><b>to have to make a substantial commitment to post-conflict administration.</b></p>
<p>637</p>
<p><b>1434.  Achieving that outcome depended on the UK’s ability to persuade the US </b></p>
<p><b>of the merits of a significant post-conflict role for the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>1435.  The UK could not be certain at any stage in the year before the invasion that </b></p>
<p><b>it would succeed in that aim.</b></p>
<p><b>1436.  In January 2003, the UK sought to persuade the US of the benefits of UN </b></p>
<p><b>leadership of Iraq’s interim post-conflict civil administration.</b></p>
<p>638</p>
<p><b> Officials warned </b></p>
<p><b>that, if the UK failed to persuade the US, it risked “being drawn into a huge </b></p>
<p><b>commitment of UK resources for a highly complex task of administration and </b></p>
<p><b>law and order for an uncertain period”. </b></p>
<p><b>1437.  By March 2003, having failed to persuade the US of the advantages </b></p>
<p><b>of a UN-led interim administration, the UK had set the less ambitious goal </b></p>
<p><b>of persuading the US to accept UN authorisation of a Coalition-led interim </b></p>
<p><b>administration and an international presence that would include the UN.</b></p>
<p>639</p>
<p><b>1438.  On 19 March, Mr Blair stated in Parliament that discussions were taking </b></p>
<p><b>place with the US, UN and others on the role of the UN and post-conflict issues.</b></p>
<p>640</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>1439.  Discussions continued, but, as the invasion began: </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The UK had not secured US agreement to a Security Council resolution </b></p>
<p><b>authorising post-conflict administration and could not be sure when, or on </b></p>
<p><b>what terms, agreement would be possible. </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>The extent of the UN’s preparations, which had been hindered by the </b></p>
<p><b>absence of agreement on post-conflict arrangements, remained uncertain. </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Annan emphasised to Ms Short the need for clarity on US thinking so </b></p>
<p><b>that UN planning could proceed</b></p>

<p><b>The planning process and decision-making</b></p>
<p><b>1441.  As a junior partner in the Coalition, the UK worked within a planning </b></p>
<p><b>framework established by the US. It had limited influence over a process </b></p>
<p><b>dominated increasingly by the US military.</b></p>
<p><b>1442.  The creation of the AHGI in September 2002 and the IPU in February 2003 </b></p>
<p><b>improved co-ordination across government at official level, but neither body </b></p>

<p><b>between military and civilian planners. </b></p>

<p><b>Iraq, and significant pieces of analysis, including the series of SPG papers </b></p>
<p><b>on military strategic thinking, were either not shared outside the originating </b></p>
<p><b>department, or, as appears to have been the case with the SPG papers, were not </b></p>
<p><b>routinely available to all those with a direct interest in the contents. </b></p>
<p><b>1444.  Some risks were identified, but departmental ownership of those risks, and </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>564</p>
<p><b>on 24 March,</b></p>
<p>650</p>
<p><b> there is no evidence that any department or individual assumed </b></p>
<p><b>ownership or was assigned responsibility for analysis or mitigation. No action </b></p>
<p><b>ensued. </b></p>
<p><b>1446.  In April 2003, Mr Blair set up the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>Rehabilitation (AHMGIR), chaired by Mr Straw, to oversee the UK contribution to </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict reconstruction (see Section 10.1).</b></p>
<p><b>1447.  Until the creation of the AHMGIR, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Ms Short remained </b></p>
<p><b>jointly responsible for directing post-conflict planning and preparation. </b></p>
<p><b>1448.  In the absence of a single person responsible for overseeing all aspects </b></p>
<p><b>of planning and preparation, departments pursued complementary, but separate, </b></p>
<p><b>objectives. Gaps in UK capabilities were overlooked. </b></p>
<p><b>1449.  The FCO, which focused on policy-making and negotiation, was not </b></p>
<p><b>equipped by past experience or practice, or by its limited human and financial </b></p>
<p><b>resources, to prepare for nation-building of the scale required in Iraq, and did </b></p>
<p><b>not expect to do so.</b></p>
<p><b>1450.  DFID’s focus on poverty reduction and the channelling of assistance </b></p>
<p><b>through multilateral institutions instilled a reluctance, before the invasion, to </b></p>
<p><b>engage on anything other than the immediate humanitarian response to conflict. </b></p>
<p><b>1451.  When military planners advised of the need to consider the civilian </b></p>
<p><b>component as an integral part of the UK’s post-conflict deployment, the </b></p>
<p><b>Government was not equipped to respond. Neither the FCO nor DFID took </b></p>
<p><b>responsibility for the issue.</b></p>
<p><b>1452.  The shortage of expertise in reconstruction and stabilisation was a </b></p>
<p><b>constraint on the planning process and on the contribution the UK was able </b></p>
<p><b>to make to the administration and reconstruction of post-conflict Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>1453.  The UK Government’s post-invasion response to the shortage of deployable </b></p>
<p><b>experts in stabilisation and post-conflict reconstruction is addressed in </b></p>
<p><b>Section 10.3.</b></p>
<p><b>1454.  Constraints on UK military capacity are addressed in Sections 6.1 and 6.2.</b></p>
<p><b>1455.  The UK contribution to the post-conflict humanitarian response is assessed </b></p>
<p><b>in Section 10.1.</b></p>
<p><b>1456.  At no stage did Ministers or senior officials commission the systematic </b></p>
<p><b>evaluation of different options, incorporating detailed analysis of risk and UK </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities, military and civilian, which should have been required before the UK </b></p>
<p><b>committed to any course of action in Iraq. </b></p>

<p><b>1457.  Where policy recommendations were supported by untested assumptions, </b></p>
<p><b>those assumptions were seldom challenged. When they were, the issue was not </b></p>
<p><b>always followed through.</b></p>
<p><b>1458.  It was the responsibility of officials to identify, analyse and advise on risk </b></p>
<p><b>and Ministers’ responsibility to ensure that measures to mitigate identifiable </b></p>
<p><b>risks, including a range of policy options, had been considered before significant </b></p>
<p><b>decisions were taken on the direction of UK policy. </b></p>
<p><b>1459.  Occasions when that would have been appropriate included:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>after Mr Blair’s meeting with Mr Hoon, Mr Straw and others on 23 July </b></p>
<p><b>2002;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>after the adoption of resolution 1441;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>before or immediately after the decision to deploy troops in January 2003; </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>after the Rock Drill in February 2003; and </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>after Mr Blair’s meeting on post-conflict issues on 6 March 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>1460.  There is no indication of formal risk analysis or formal consideration of </b></p>
<p><b>options associated with any of those events. </b></p>
<p><b>1461.  In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair said:</b></p>
<p><b>“… with hindsight, we now see that the military campaign to defeat Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>was relatively easy; it was the aftermath that was hard. At the time, of course, </b></p>
<p><b>we could not know that and a prime focus throughout was the military </b></p>
<p><b>campaign itself …”</b></p>
<p>651</p>
<p><b>1462.  The conclusions reached by Mr Blair after the invasion did not require the </b></p>
<p><b>benefit of hindsight. </b></p>
<p><b>1463.  Mr Blair’s long-standing conviction that successful international </b></p>
<p><b>intervention required long-term commitment had been clearly expressed in his </b></p>
<p><b>Chicago speech in 1999. </b></p>
<p><b>1464.  That conviction was echoed, in the context of Iraq, in frequent advice to </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair from Ministers and officials.</b></p>
<p><b>1465.  Between early 2002 and the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Mr Blair received </b></p>
<p><b>warnings about:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the significance of the post-conflict phase as the “strategically decisive” </b></p>

<p><b>1466.  Mr Blair told the Chiefs of Staff on 15 January 2003 that “the ‘Issue’ </b></p>
<p><b>was aftermath – the Coalition must prevent anarchy and internecine fighting </b></p>
<p><b>breaking out”.</b></p>
<p>660</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>1467.  In his evidence to the House of Commons Liaison Committee on 21 January </b></p>
<p><b>2003, Mr Blair emphasised the importance of the post-conflict phase:</b></p>
<p><b>“You do not engage in military conflict that may produce regime change </b></p>
<p><b>unless you are prepared to follow through and work in the aftermath of that </b></p>
<p><b>regime change to ensure the country is stable and the people are properly </b></p>
<p><b>looked after.”</b></p>
<p>661</p>
<p><b>1468.  On 24 January 2003, Mr Blair told President Bush that the biggest risk they </b></p>
<p><b>faced was internecine fighting, and that delay would allow time for working up </b></p>
<p><b>more coherent post-conflict plans.</b></p>
<p>662</p>
<p><b>1469.  Yet when Mr Blair set out the UK’s vision for the future of Iraq in the House </b></p>
<p><b>of Commons on 18 March 2003, no assessment had been made of whether that </b></p>
<p><b>vision was achievable, no agreement had been reached with the US on a workable </b></p>
<p><b>post-conflict plan, UN authorisation had not yet been secured, and there had been </b></p>
<p><b>no decision on the UN’s role in post-conflict Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>1470.  UK policy rested on the assumption that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the US would provide effective leadership of the immediate post-conflict </b></p>
<p><b>effort in Iraq;</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the conditions would soon be in place for UK military withdrawal;</b></p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p><b>substantial international support would follow UN authorisation; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>reconstruction and the political transition to Iraqi rule would proceed in a </b></p>
<p><b>secure environment. </b></p>
<p><b>1471.  Mr Blair was already aware that those assumptions concealed </b></p>
<p><b>significant risks:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>UK officials assessed that ORHA, the US body that would assume </b></p>
<p><b>responsibility for the immediate post-invasion administration of Iraq, was </b></p>
