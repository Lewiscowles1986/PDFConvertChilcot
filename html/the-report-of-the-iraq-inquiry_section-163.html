<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>Planning and preparing for fatalities</b></p>
<p><b>Estimates of UK military fatalities</b></p>
<p><b>8. </b> Sections 6.1 and 6.2 describe military planning for operations in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> In early September 2002, the MOD estimated that between 31 and 48 Service </p>
<p>Personnel would be killed in action during the initial combat phase of operations of an </p>
<p>attack on Iraq (and that between 157 and 241 Service Personnel would be admitted </p>
<p>to Role 3 hospitals).</p>
<p>2,3</p>
<p> Those figures excluded possible casualties from chemical and </p>
<p>biological warfare. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> The MOD regularly updated its casualty estimates as the military plan developed. </p>
<p>The estimates did not consider casualties beyond the initial combat phase of operations.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, wrote to Mr Blair on 16 January 2003, </p>
<p>recommending that the UK agree a US request to provide a large scale ground force  </p>
<p>for operations in southern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Hoon’s advice did not include the estimates of UK military casualties (including </p>
<p>fatalities) that had been developed.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>13. </b> Mr Blair agreed Mr Hoon’s recommendation the following day.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> On 3 February, the MOD produced a Casualty Estimate paper for the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>meeting later that week.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> The paper stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There could be between 30 and 50 fatalities in the Land Component.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There could be between 5 and 9 fatalities in the Air Component.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No simple estimate could be made of fatalities in the Maritime Component, given </p>
<p>the high impact/low probability nature of incidents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Fatalities from a “single small&#8209;scale but well executed” chemical attack could be </p>
<p>between 0 and 96 fatalities, depending on a range of factors including the target, </p>
<p>the chemical agent used, and the weather. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No useful estimate could be made of fatalities from a biological attack in the </p>
<p>absence of more specific information about the circumstances of any attack. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The Chiefs of Staff concluded on 5 February that the Casualty Estimate paper would </p>
<p>need to be shown to Ministers before any decision to commit UK troops was made.</p>
<p>7</p>

<p>16.3  |  Military fatalities and the bereaved</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>16. </b> On 20 February, in response to the publication of a paper, <i>Iraq at the Crossroads: </i></p>
<p><i>State and Society in the Shadow of the Regime,</i> by the International Institute of Strategic </p>
<p>Studies (IISS),</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> Mr Blair asked for advice on a number of questions, including: “What is </p>
<p>our military’s assessment of the likely consequences of an attack on Iraq; i.e. how many </p>
<p>casualties; how quickly the collapse?”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>17. </b> On 24 February, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advising that the </p>
<p>MOD estimated that there would be between 30 and 60 British and between 500 and </p>
<p>1,200 Iraqi “land battle” fatalities.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> Mr Watkins also advised that work to estimate Iraqi </p>
<p>civilian casualties continued. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Lord Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff from 2001 to April 2003, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>Ministers would have been informed of the MOD’s casualty estimates, as part of the </p>
<p>routine briefing process.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>19. </b> By 1 May, when President Bush declared that major combat operations in Iraq had </p>
<p>ended, 33 British Service Personnel had died serving on Op TELIC.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> Both Lord Boyce and Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary from 2001 </p>
<p>to 2005, told the Inquiry that the actual number of casualties had been fewer than the </p>
<p>MOD had estimated.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> Sir Kevin commented:</p>
<p>“… as far as casualties are concerned, the assessment was that they would not </p>
<p>be any higher than we faced in the Gulf war 12 years earlier. So the figures were </p>
<p>relatively ... modest. In the event, they were even lower than that. The uncertainty </p>
<p>was ... the possible use of chemical/biological weapons against us. I think the </p>
<p>original assessment was that Saddam was unlikely – but we couldn’t rule it out </p>
<p>militarily – unlikely to use them early ... but he might use them, and we expected  </p>
<p>him to use them, as a matter of last resort, which, of course, informed the nature  </p>
<p>of military planning.”</p>
<p><b>Repatriation policy</b></p>
<p><b>21. </b> Until the Falklands Conflict in 1982, Service Personnel who died on major </p>
<p>operations were normally buried in theatre.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> After the Falklands Conflict, all bereaved families were offered the opportunity to </p>
<p>have the bodies of their relatives returned to the UK, largely because of the difficulty </p>

<p>Paper DCDS(Pers), 14 March 2003, ‘UK Forces: Repatriation of the Dead’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>of travelling to the Falkland Islands to visit their graves. In subsequent operations, </p>
<p>it became MOD policy to repatriate bodies to the UK in all but the most exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> The MOD’s policy on the repatriation of the dead was set out in a paper produced </p>
<p>by Lieutenant General Anthony Palmer, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel) </p>
<p>(DCDS(Personnel)), on 14 March 2003:</p>
<p>“Repatriation to UK of the dead is to take place wherever possible and as soon  </p>
<p>as practicable.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>24. </b> If fatalities were suspected to have been caused by Chemical Biological </p>
<p>Radiological Nuclear (CBRN) agents, then repatriation should only proceed once the </p>
<p>presence of a CBRN agent had been confirmed or ruled out, and then on the basis of  </p>
<p>a risk assessment. In certain circumstances, repatriation might require mitigating actions </p>
<p>(such as decontamination or special isolation of the body), or the body might need to  </p>
<p>be officially cremated in theatre with the ashes repatriated. In exceptional circumstances, </p>
<p>the body might need to be cremated and permanently buried in theatre.</p>
<p><b>Preparing to hold civilian inquests</b></p>
<p><b>The legal frameworks for inquests</b></p>
<p>Coroners are independent judicial officers. They are appointed and paid for by the  </p>
<p>relevant local authority and their officers and staff are employed by the local authority  </p>
<p>and/or the police. </p>
<p>Coroners in England and Wales had a statutory duty, under Section 8 of the 1988 </p>
<p>Coroners Act, to investigate deaths which are reported to them when the body is lying in </p>
<p>their district and there is reason to believe that the death was violent or unnatural, or was </p>
<p>a sudden death of unknown cause, or in some other circumstances.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> That duty applied </p>
<p>“whether the cause of death arose in his district or not”. </p>
<p>Section 14 of the 1988 Coroners Act provided that, if it appeared to the coroner for the </p>
<p>district where a body was lying that the inquest ought to be held by another coroner,  </p>
<p>then he may request that coroner to assume jurisdiction. </p>
<p>The position in Scotland and Northern Ireland was different. </p>
<p>In Scotland, the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 required </p>
<p>the appropriate procurator fiscal to investigate (through a Fatal Accident Inquiry)  </p>
<p>any death which occurred within Scotland in the course of an individual’s employment, </p>
<p>or in legal custody.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> The Act also provided for the Lord Advocate to instruct a procurator </p>
<p>fiscal to investigate a death if it appeared to him that an investigation would be in the </p>
<p>public interest. </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Paper DCDS(Pers), 14 March 2003, ‘UK Forces: Repatriation of the Dead’. </p>
<p>16 </p>
<p>Coroners Act 1988. The Act was replaced by the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. </p>

<p>Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths (Scotland) Act 1976.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.3  |  Military fatalities and the bereaved</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>The Coroners Act (Northern Ireland) 1959 provided that coroners in Northern Ireland </p>
<p>within whose district a dead body was found, or an unexpected or unexplained death or </p>
<p>a death in suspicious and certain other circumstances occurred, “may” hold an inquest.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Act also provided for the Advocate General for Northern Ireland to direct that an </p>
<p>inquest should be held in other circumstances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the case of military deaths overseas, civilian inquests usually took place after<i> </i>the </p>
<p>internal military investigation had concluded, although this was not formally required.  </p>
<p>The military investigation could provide evidence that would be extremely difficult for  </p>
<p>a coroner to source elsewhere. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> An MOD official wrote to Mr Nicholas Gardiner, the Coroner for Oxfordshire, </p>
<p>on 17 January 2003 to advise him that the Services were currently considering the </p>
<p>administration for “potential mass casualties in the event of war”, and that the majority </p>
<p>of fatalities might be repatriated to RAF Brize Norton, which fell within his area of </p>
<p>responsibility.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> The official asked whether “normal peacetime rules” would apply and </p>
<p>specifically whether, if there were a large number of fatalities, he would expect to hold  </p>
<p>an inquest into each case. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr Gardiner replied on 20 January, confirming that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the cause of death appeared unnatural, then there would be an inquest.  </p>
<p>This would normally be held in public. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Normal practice where there was a single death was to transfer responsibility for </p>
<p>the inquest to the “home town coroner”. Where there were a number of deaths </p>
<p>in the same incident it was “clearly sensible” for the same coroner to hold those </p>
<p>inquests; that would commonly be the coroner for the point of entry.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Gardiner and officials in the Home Office (the Department which was then </p>
<p>responsible for coronial policy) and the MOD worked together during February and </p>
<p>March to refine the arrangements for receiving UK fatalities.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Mr Gardiner advised a Home Office official on 20 February that he understood  </p>
<p>that in “contamination cases”, the bodies of deceased Service Personnel would not  </p>
<p>be returned to the UK.</p>

<p>21 </p>
<p>Letter Gardiner to Home Office [junior official], 20 February 2003, ‘Service Deaths Overseas’. </p>
<p>Mr Gardiner’s letter provides no further details on the nature of those “contamination cases”. The Inquiry </p>
<p>believes that Mr Gardiner was referring to casualties from chemical and biological weapons. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Mr Gardiner wrote to a Home Office official on 18 March, the day before military </p>
<p>operations against Iraq began:</p>
<p>“There are a few matters outstanding but, generally, I think we are reasonably well </p>
<p>prepared, although there are bound to be things we have not thought of.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The Home Office issued guidance to all coroners on handling deaths arising from </p>
<p>hostilities in Iraq on 26 March.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> The guidance stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD had advised that, while hostilities lasted, it would not be possible to </p>
<p>provide evidence of the incidents on the battlefield which led to injury. In those </p>
<p>circumstances, the Home Office recommended that coroners should adjourn </p>
<p>inquests pending the conclusion of hostilities. Coroners “could expect to receive </p>
<p>in due course advice on when it might be appropriate to consider the resumption </p>
<p>of such inquests”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coroners should notify the Home Office “if the numbers of adjourned cases in </p>
<p>their jurisdiction seem likely to cause problems in terms of workload”.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> A Home Office official wrote to Mr Gardiner on 2 April to advise that, while the </p>
<p>Home Office appreciated Mr Gardiner’s “willingness to undertake the handling of all </p>
<p>these cases”, the extra costs involved would fall to Oxfordshire County Council and they </p>
<p>should be invited to agree the commitment that Mr Gardiner was taking on.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>32. </b> The official went on to suggest that, “wherever appropriate, it would be better for the </p>
<p>substantive inquests to be held by coroners local to the family concerned, as with any </p>
<p>other deaths overseas”. While that approach had not been adopted for the inquests into </p>
<p>the deaths caused by the 9/11 attack and the Bali bombing, in those cases the deaths all </p>
<p>arose from a single incident:</p>
<p>“In the case of Iraq, the deaths are occurring in different places, at different times </p>
<p>and in different circumstances. It seems to me, that unless there is good reason </p>
<p>to the contrary, single deaths, and multiple deaths arising from the same incident </p>
<p>and involving personnel from broadly the same place in England and Wales, ought </p>
<p>to be subject to local inquests where the family or families involved can attend </p>
<p>conveniently. Inquests into multiple deaths involving individuals from different </p>
<p>parts of the country might properly be undertaken by you, unless there seems to </p>
<p>be a more appropriate local coroner (e.g. if the deceased were all from the same </p>
<p>military base).”</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Gardiner replied on 4 April, agreeing that it was certainly appropriate for some </p>
<p>inquests to be transferred to other coroners.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> Those would generally be single deaths, </p>

<p>83</p>
<p>and multiple deaths where there was a “significant common factor” indicating that an </p>
<p>inquest outside of Oxfordshire would be appropriate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Mr Gardiner also agreed that there were “significant financial implications” for his </p>
<p>office, and advised that he was copying the exchange to Oxfordshire County Council. </p>
<p><b>Support for bereaved families</b></p>
<p><b>The Casualty Notification Officer and Visiting Officer</b></p>
<p><b>35. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Alistair Irwin, the Adjutant General from 2003 to 2005, </p>
<p>described the role of a Casualty Notification Officer (CNO) for the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“It is the hope and expectation that those involved [CNOs] will be from the unit but </p>
<p>sometimes, particularly if it was an individual based elsewhere, it had to be done by </p>
<p>somebody else ... The general principle was that it should be based on the family </p>
<p>entity, the military family entity.</p>
<p>“Once the casualty has been identified beyond peradventure and all the details </p>
<p>are correct ... the CNO ... has the unenviable task of knocking on the door and </p>
<p>presenting the bad news.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Vice Admiral (VAdm) Peter Wilkinson, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel) </p>
<p>(DCDS(Personnel)) from 2007, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“... it is the very first official contact that a bereaved family has with the MOD or the </p>
<p>Armed Services that determines how the journey will go from there. If that official </p>
<p>notification is carried out appropriately from all sides, then there is a chance that we </p>
<p>may be able to help the family as they go through the grieving and bereavement </p>

<p>CNOs and VOs were briefed to try to identify any issues that might affect </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Notification was to take place at any time of day or night, to avoid families </p>

<p>would extend benefits to unmarried partners on a “case&#8209;by&#8209;case” basis. </p>

<p>benefits should be extended to unmarried partners for deaths attributable to service. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> On 20 March, Dr Lewis Moonie, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for </p>

<p>and formal identification – would be recovered from her benefits.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>48. </b> The bereaved spouse also felt that the AFPAA was pressuring her to leave her </p>

<p><b>49. </b> The MOD’s policy at that time was to allow spouses of deceased Service Personnel </p>
<p>to remain in SFA for up to six months.</p>

<p> That period could be extended in some </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Lt Gen Palmer wrote to Mr Hoon’s Private Office on 17 April, confirming that work </p>
<p>was already in hand to conduct that comprehensive review (an initial report would be </p>
<p>available by 16 May), and reporting the “immediate remedial action” that had been taken </p>
<p>in response to the individual’s experience:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lt Gen Palmer had “declared” that all except one of the Op TELIC fatalities </p>
<p>to date were attributable to service. That declaration meant that the usual </p>
<p>assessment of attributability would not be required, and that families could </p>
<p>be notified now that the higher benefits associated with deaths attributable </p>
<p>to service would be paid.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The letters used by the AFPAA were not appropriate. As of 16 April, all letters </p>
<p>dealing with Op TELIC had been “personally vetted” by the AFPAA’s Chief </p>
<p>Executive and checked by the appropriate Service Casualty Co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>Centre.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Families of Service Personnel were now able to stay in their service </p>
<p>accommodation for “as long as they feel they need to in order to assess their </p>
<p>longer&#8209;term housing requirements”. If pressed, VOs should “talk in terms of </p>
<p>nine months although stressing that each case will be examined on its merits”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD had asked the deceased insurer’s to accelerate their procedures.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Lt Gen Palmer was advised on the same day that the MOD was facing a new </p>
<p>challenge: “Policy ... changing ‘on the hoof’”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Lt Gen Palmer provided his first report to Mr Hoon on bereavement procedures </p>
<p>on 16 May.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> It identified six recent, specific lapses in the MOD’s handling of </p>
<p>bereaved families (two of which pre&#8209;dated Op TELIC), and three broader areas where </p>
<p>improvement was necessary: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the volume, timing and style of correspondence between multiple MOD </p>
<p>organisations and bereaved families;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of clarity over the sources of specialist advice available to bereaved </p>
<p>families; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “training/education” of CNOs and VOs. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> Lt Gen Palmer reported the actions that had already been taken to prevent a </p>
<p>recurrence of those specific lapses, and restated the decisions of the previous month </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>He had directed that all MOD correspondence should be routed through the </p>
<p>deceased’s unit and the VO, and all MOD visits to bereaved families should  </p>
<p>be co&#8209;ordinated by the VO. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further work would be done to develop “simple and readable” guidance, to </p>
<p>improve the tone of correspondence, and to develop a comprehensive guide </p>
<p>to the sources of advice and support available.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further work would be done to assess the selection, training and education  </p>
<p>of CNOs and VOs. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> In March 2004, the MOD concluded a study to identify improvements to their </p>
<p>investigative and Board of Inquiry (BOI) processes.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> While the study focused on the </p>
<p>investigative and BOI processes themselves, it recommended that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Commands should establish a senior focal point with responsibility for </p>
<p>pro&#8209;actively monitoring all investigations and BOIs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>all communication with families should be routed through a “single established </p>
<p>and known contact”, who could explain the context of any correspondence and </p>
<p>“head&#8209;off any infelicitous or insensitive drafting”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “knowledgeable and consistent” officer should regularly brief families on the </p>
<p>detail and progress of the entire investigation and BOI process. </p>
<p><b>59. </b> On 24 June, Lt Gen Palmer reported to Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Sir Anthony </p>
<p>Bagnall, Vice Chief of Defence Staff (VCDS), that each Service had now appointed a </p>
<p>“Senior Co&#8209;ordinator” to act as a focal point for monitoring investigations and Inquiries.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lt Gen Palmer also gave ACM Bagnall the “specific reassurance” that he had requested </p>
<p>that each Service had undertaken to provide regular briefings to next of kin on process </p>
<p>and progress. All communication with the next of kin would be routed through a single </p>
<p>contact (normally the VO) who would “act as a sift” to filter out any insensitive or </p>
<p>inconsistent drafting. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised ACM Bagnall that a study into Services’ bereavement </p>
<p>support procedures, including the training provided to CNOs and VOs, had now </p>
<p>reported. The study had concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>“slightly different” approaches given their differing geographical spread, unit </p>
<p>organisations and ethos.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With the exception of the Royal Navy, which generally used qualified welfare </p>
<p>workers, “bereavement support personnel” were appointed on an ad hoc basis </p>
<p>from the junior officer cadre. While bespoke training for the entire cadre was </p>
<p>neither cost&#8209;effective nor deliverable, it should be possible to provide “awareness </p>
<p>briefings” during general staff training, supplemented by “thorough briefings” by </p>
<p>specialist personnel when an individual was appointed to be a VO.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised ACM Bagnall that he supported those findings, but </p>
<p>commented that ACM Bagnall might wish to “revisit” the conclusion that it would not </p>
<p>be financially or practically viable to develop a bespoke training course for individuals </p>
<p>involved in bereavement support.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>62. </b> ACM Bagnall accepted the findings, but commented that existing single&#8209;Service or </p>
<p>tri&#8209;Service courses could include some coverage of bereavement support procedures.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>63. </b> On 30 June, Lt Gen Palmer provided Mr Hoon with an update on work to improve </p>
<p>the BOI process.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> The update also covered progress on improving communications </p>
<p>with families. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised Mr Hoon that it was “clear that we are failing to meet </p>
<p>some families’ expectations in respect of the quality and quantity of information we are </p>
<p>providing to them”. A key step in improving communications between families and the </p>
<p>MOD would be the appointment of a Senior Co&#8209;ordinator in each of the Services to </p>
<p>ensure that families were briefed, through their VOs, on the progress of investigations </p>
<p>and BOIs; the role of the Senior Co&#8209;ordinator, and progress in improving the BOI </p>
<p>process, is described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> Lt Gen Palmer recalled the steps that had been taken to improve the tone and </p>
<p>accuracy of the MOD’s correspondence with bereaved families and advised that,  </p>
<p>as far as practicable, all routine correspondence now followed standard templates.  </p>
<p>The production of a joint casualty procedures manual</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> and the formation of a </p>
<p>Joint Casualty Co&#8209;ordination Cell (JCCC) by January 2005 would further improve </p>
<p>communication with families. As a “final filter”, all communication with families was  </p>

<p><b>66. </b> Lt Gen Palmer reported that the review of training for personnel involved in </p>
<p>bereavement support had concluded that a bespoke training course would be neither </p>
<p>“financially nor practically viable”, but had identified a number of ways in which they </p>
<p>would be better supported. The “problems of picking VOs from a necessarily ad hoc </p>
<p>pool” could be overcome by including VO duties in general staff training, ensuring </p>
<p>that specialist advice was available when needed, and ensuring that the “often </p>
<p>junior” VO was properly briefed and supervised. Lt Gen Palmer expected that senior </p>
<p>commanders would take a close and personal interest in ensuring that this was </p>
<p>done properly. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> In April 2005, Lt Gen Palmer recommended that the MOD’s policy on the occupation </p>
<p>of Service Family Accommodation by bereaved spouses should be changed to be </p>
<p>“less prescriptive”:</p>
<p>“... while bereaved spouses should be offered retention of SFA for two years we </p>
<p>should acknowledge that there might be some ... who seek to retain their SFA for  </p>
<p>an indefinite period thereafter.”</p>

<p><b>68. </b> Mr Hoon agreed that recommendation, subject to a number of amendments, </p>

<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>69. </b> Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed Forces from 2001 to 2007, </p>
<p>recalled the exchange in his evidence to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“... the view [in the MOD] was, ‘Well, this is going to dislocate all the other </p>
<p>arrangements, if you let this widow stay in the house’, and Geoff Hoon just said </p>
<p>‘So what? Fix it’, and it was fixed. I think, to the best of my recollection, we didn’t </p>
<p>have a deluge of demand in that area. It may have been beneath the surface, but  </p>

<p>to 2007, told the Inquiry that in 2004:</p>
<p>“... there was clear dissatisfaction with the notification procedures because ... it was </p>
<p>a single&#8209;service responsibility and we were required very quickly to set up a Joint </p>
<p>Casualty and Compassionate Cell ... and that took over getting the information from </p>

<p>52</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Lt Gen Irwin told the Inquiry that during his time as Adjutant General (from 2003 </p>
<p>to 2005):</p>
<p>“... I think [there were] 57 Army casualties ... and I would think, looking back on </p>
<p>it, that I may have heard about issues in the notification process, and by ‘issues’ </p>
<p>I mean either delays in doing it or calling on the wrong person, or the wrong sort of </p>
<p>words being said at the wrong sort of time, I think maybe I had cases of that kind </p>
<p>maybe between six and ten, so something of that order.”</p>
<p>“... as an individual, that family, there was nothing in the world was more significant. </p>
<p>So we had to keep asking ourselves, ‘Are we doing this right?’ </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“So as each issue developed, we tried to close it off, but even after all this time and </p>
<p>even with the establishment of the new joint system, with the new central training, </p>
<p>even then, I am afraid I can guarantee that, in the future, there will be people who </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>78. </b> Lieutenant General Mark Mans, the Deputy Adjutant General, wrote to senior </p>

<p>of selecting appropriate and experienced individuals to be VOs:</p>
<p>“Although the majority do an excellent job, from time to time the wrong person </p>
<p>is nominated and invariably significant difficulties follow. This happened again </p>
<p>recently ...</p>
<p>“The training of both Casualty Notification Officers (CNOs) and VOs is also most </p>
<p>important and although JSP [751] says ‘if possible ... should have received some </p>
<p>training’, it should be exceptional for them not to have attended some sort of </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>79. </b> Lt Gen Mans advised that a centralised training package based on an interactive </p>

<p>all future training (divisions and brigades currently ran their own training). Training would </p>
<p>become mandatory when this package issued. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Lt Gen Mans told the Inquiry that VOs had:</p>

<p>if you are a Visiting Officer, you can have a pretty traumatic time. Throughout a </p>

<p>59</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>82. </b> MOD Ministers returned to the issue of the training and support provided to Visiting </p>
<p>Officers in 2008. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> In February 2008, Sir Bill Jeffrey, the MOD’s Permanent Under Secretary, provided </p>
<p>detailed advice to Mr Bob Ainsworth, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, on how the </p>
<p>BOI process could be improved and how the existing process could be accelerated.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Bill’s advice did not consider the role of the VO.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Ainsworth held a meeting on 11 April to discuss that advice.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> The record of the </p>
<p>meeting reported:</p>
<p>“The Minister raised the issue of interface with families. He recognised that the </p>
<p>Visiting Officer role was very difficult ... He also recognised the clear single Service </p>
<p>lead in this area ... He, nevertheless, felt that more could be done in terms of the </p>
<p>resourcing and training of Visiting Officers. He felt that the cell [the Defence Inquests </p>
<p>Unit] should play a role in this area, focusing on ensuring the right training and </p>
<p>guidance is provided, sharing best practice between the Services and monitoring </p>
<p>performance.” </p>
<p><b>The experience of bereaved families</b></p>
<p><b>85. </b> The experiences that family members have shared with the Inquiry suggest that </p>
<p>there was considerable variation in the quality of the notification process. Some family </p>
<p>members spoke positively about the sensitive and prompt way in which the news was </p>
<p>delivered. A smaller number reported negative experiences, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insensitive delivery;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an impression that details were being withheld (particularly in ‘friendly fire’ </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>use of archive footage by the media which featured the deceased as though </p>
<p>they were still alive, causing confusion about what was the truth.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The experiences shared with the Inquiry suggest that the creation of the JCCC led </p>
<p>to an improvement in the quality of the notification process. </p>
<p><b>87. </b> There was also considerable variation in families’ experience of the support </p>
<p>provided by Visiting Officers (VOs). In some cases, an enduring and positive relationship </p>
<p>resulted. In others:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The VO was changed without warning, in some instances more than once.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The VO was badly briefed and lacked knowledge of procedures. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Insensitive language and behaviour caused distress.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Contact was sporadic.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> The Inquiry also heard about a number of distressing incidents which, although  </p>
<p>they do not form part of a wider pattern, are illustrative of how a lack of care can have  </p>
<p>a significant impact. They were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following an air crash in which several Service Personnel died, a number </p>
<p>of body parts remained unidentified. Families of those who had died were </p>
<p>not told about the existence of those unidentified body parts, and many had </p>
<p>already held funerals by the time identification was complete, making a second </p>
<p>ceremony necessary. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>One family discovered that photographs of their son’s body had been used, </p>
<p>without permission being sought, in a training seminar. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>One family member accepted military advice not to view their son’s body based </p>
<p>on the impact of the injuries suffered. But facial reconstruction had taken place </p>
<p>and there had already been a viewing for another family member. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> Anyone serving in the Armed Forces is asked to designate one person as their </p>
<p>official next of kin. When a fatality occurs, the CNO contacts the next of kin, and they  </p>
<p>are the ongoing point of contact for a VO. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> Parents who lost children in Op TELIC told the Inquiry that one consequence of </p>
<p>this arrangement was a disparity between the information and support provided to the </p>
<p>partner of the deceased, usually the person named as next of kin, and to parents.  </p>
<p>As one father told the Inquiry, being a bereaved parent can be a very lonely business.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The need for greater support to a wider family than just the next of kin was </p>
<p>recognised by the Government in July 2008:</p>
<p>“We recognise that the loss of a Service person affects the whole of the bereaved </p>
<p>family, not just the next of kin or nominated emergency contacts, on whom we </p>

<p>94</p>
<p>traditionally tend to focus our contact and support. We will review our procedures to </p>
<p>ensure that in future sufficient account is taken of the needs of the wider family.”</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>Early concerns about military investigations</b></p>
<p><b>92. </b> The MOD had a wide range of internal investigations that could be carried out </p>
<p>following a fatality or other serious incident occurring on operations.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Land Accident Investigation Team (LAIT) investigations. The LAIT could </p>
<p>respond to incidents at very short notice and would normally report within </p>
<p>30 days. It sought to determine the cause of an accident and make timely </p>
<p>recommendations to prevent reoccurrence. It did not apportion blame. A LAIT </p>
<p>report could inform a Board of Inquiry/Service Inquiry, or substitute for it where </p>
<p>the facts of the case were sufficiently clear. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Service Police investigations. Each Service has its own Service Police force; </p>
<p>for the Army, that is the Royal Military Police (RMP). The Special Investigation </p>
<p>Branch (SIB) of each Service Police force investigates the most serious </p>
<p>cases. The MOD told the Inquiry: “While the need for a prompt investigation is </p>
<p>important, and may be vital, there are no specific deadlines for the completion  </p>
<p>of Service Police investigations.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Boards of Inquiry (BOIs). The purpose of a BOI was to establish the facts about </p>
<p>an event, to make recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence, and to inform </p>
<p>any decision on whether other action, such as administrative or disciplinary </p>
<p>action, should be initiated.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> BOIs would not generally attribute blame. </p>

<p><b>94. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office responded on 30 June, expressing Mr Hoon’s </p>
<p>concern that the individual’s next of kin had not yet been informed of the result of the </p>
<p>post&#8209;mortem, in particular as the media might release that information. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> Mr Hoon’s Office also asked for an update on all the BOIs and other investigations </p>

<p>95</p>
<p><b>96. </b> On 4 July, Mr Ian Gibson, MOD Deputy Director Service Personnel, sent an update </p>
<p>on progress on BOIs and investigations to Mr Hoon’s Office.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> The update detailed </p>
<p>43 fatalities resulting from 21 incidents. Only one BOI, into the loss of a Sea King </p>
<p>helicopter with six UK Service Personnel on board on 22 March, had so far reported. </p>
<p>A date for the inquest had not yet been set. </p>
<p><b>97. </b> Later that month, Mr Gibson sent Mr Hoon’s Office a paper describing military </p>
<p>investigative and BOI processes, which highlighted the different approaches taken </p>
<p>by the Services.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The Royal Navy and RAF would generally launch a BOI as soon </p>
<p>as an incident occurred, at the same time as they deployed a criminal investigative </p>
<p>team (if they thought that one was required). In contrast, the Army would only launch </p>
<p>a BOI after an investigative team had reported. The MOD was considering the scope </p>
<p>for harmonising the Services’ approaches to BOIs as part of the Tri&#8209;Service Armed </p>
<p>Forces Act.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr Ingram’s Private Secretary wrote to ACM Bagnall on 15 September:</p>
<p>“Minister (AF) [Mr Ingram] is concerned about the increasing perception amongst </p>
<p>next of kin (and as a consequence Parliamentarians) that investigations into the </p>
<p>deaths of personnel in Iraq lack focus and are taking too long. Families also have </p>
<p>the impression that they are not kept informed of progress, however modest.  </p>
<p>These are admittedly perceptions, but most investigations seem slow.”</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>99. </b> While Mr Ingram understood the complications arising from the roulement of </p>
<p>formations and the operational situation:</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, he feels that we need to strengthen our ‘grip’ on these sensitive </p>
<p>issues, to ensure that corporate memory is preserved, that investigations are </p>
<p>prosecuted as vigorously as possible, and that the flow of information to NOK  </p>
<p>[next of kin] is actively managed. This may best be done through the DCMO </p>
<p>[Defence Crisis Management Organisation].” </p>
<p><b>100. </b> Mr Ingram’s Private Secretary asked for advice on how that “central management” </p>
<p>of the process might be achieved. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> ACM Bagnall received advice in September and October on how the MOD’s </p>
<p>investigative processes might be improved. </p>

<p>should be deployed to assist with Op TELIC investigations.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>103. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised ACM Bagnall on 17 October that the Army’s policy of </p>
<p>investigating all deaths, while “cautious and prudent”, placed a heavy burden on RMP/</p>
<p>SIB resources.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> There was scope for the Services to consider a common policy on </p>
<p>when it was necessary for Service Police to investigate an incident, and when a BOI  </p>
<p>or LAIT investigation would suffice.</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Lt Gen Palmer also advised that, notwithstanding the Army’s policy, the main </p>
<p>reason for delays to investigations on Op TELIC was the difficult working environment  </p>
<p>in Iraq (including the need for force protection for Service Police and a potentially hostile </p>
<p>population). The MOD was now deploying “SIB qualified” Reservists to Iraq, but the </p>
<p>RMP “remain swamped with the volume of investigative work”. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> In early 2004, ACM Bagnall and Lt Gen Palmer commissioned an internal study  </p>
<p>to identify improvements that could be made to the MOD’s investigative processes, and </p>
<p>in particular the scope for harmonising procedures across the three Services.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>106. </b> The study reported in late March 2004. It concluded that the core BOI process </p>
<p>ran “reasonably well” once triggered. The more significant problems related to how </p>
<p>and when BOIs were convened, how they linked to other investigations, and how their </p>
<p>findings were processed. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> The study highlighted the “considerable delay” to Army BOIs that could be caused </p>
<p>by a LAIT investigation and by the Army’s practice of undertaking a full RMP/SIB </p>
<p>investigation into all sudden deaths:</p>
<p>“LAIT TOR [Terms of Reference] define four weeks for issue of report after return </p>
<p>from investigation, and HQLAND BOI Standing Orders define another 14 weeks </p>
<p>after issue of final LAIT and SIB Reports before the BOI first sits. In other words,  </p>
<p>the target for the BOI to start is some five months after the incident, if everything </p>
<p>goes to plan ... five months seems too long for a routine target.”</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The study also reported that, while existing guidance emphasised that </p>
<p>investigations and inquiries should be opened and concluded as quickly as possible, </p>
<p>“the words and figures do not match, and it has to be said that the Army’s target </p>
<p>timescale of some 10 to 11 months after incident [to the conclusion of the BOI] looks </p>
<p>somewhat excessive, particularly when only two months of that is the BOI itself sitting”. </p>
<p>The majority of that 10&#8209;11 month period was allocated to “waiting for any successive </p>
<p>comments” from advisers and senior officers to complete the BOI report. </p>

<p><b>109. </b> The study made 15 recommendations, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Commands should establish a senior focal point with responsibility for </p>
<p>pro&#8209;actively monitoring all investigations and BOIs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a presumption across all three Services that a BOI President </p>
<p>should be appointed promptly. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A BOI President should be required to exercise grip and co&#8209;ordination over all </p>
<p>Service investigative bodies, and liaise with non&#8209;Service bodies. Presidents </p>
<p>should be released from other duties. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a “renewed emphasis ... upon early commencement and </p>
<p>conclusion of all phases and maximum concurrent activity”. The standard target </p>
<p>timescales for all phases of the investigative and inquiry processes should be </p>
<p>reviewed and tightened. The time allowed for advisers and senior officers to </p>
<p>comment should be limited to six weeks. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All communication with families should be routed through a “single established </p>
<p>and known contact”, who could explain the context of any correspondence and </p>
<p>“head&#8209;off any infelicitous or insensitive drafting”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “knowledgeable and consistent” officer should regularly brief families on the </p>
<p>detail and progress of the entire investigation and BOI process. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> The study also reported that there was a significant increase in public </p>
<p>expectations that there should be a BOI into every incident, and that its conclusions </p>
<p>should be disclosed. That imposed a “heavy workload” on all three Services but </p>
<p>especially the Army. </p>
<p><b>111. </b> Lt Gen Palmer wrote to Mr Ingram on 6 April, advising that all the recommendations </p>
<p>in the study had been agreed by the Services; the “main recommendations” would </p>
<p>be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> The “main advance” from the existing process was </p>
<p>that the presumption that a BOI should be convened promptly, with a BOI President </p>
<p>appointed within 48 hours of the incident, would now be extended to the Army (it was </p>
<p>already standard practice in the Royal Navy and RAF). The President would normally be </p>
<p>released from other duties and would “play a wider role in determining and co&#8209;ordinating </p>
<p>the activities of any other necessary investigations, notwithstanding that he might decide </p>
<p>not to convene his own Board immediately”. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> Lt Gen Palmer set out how communication with the next of kin would be improved. </p>
<p>All communications would be routed through a single “personal contact point”. The next </p>
<p>of kin would be “briefed clearly, comprehensively and regularly” on the investigation </p>
<p>and BOI process. Information that would not compromise the BOI could be released </p>
<p>to the next of kin before the final report issued; a clear disclosure policy consistent with </p>

<p> </p>
<p>They expressed concern about the Services’ investigative processes in general and in </p>
<p>particular the quality and frequency of communication from the MOD, and said that they </p>
<p>lacked confidence in the BOI and investigative processes. Their concerns triggered a </p>
<p>review of Service Police investigations, which is described later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Mr Hoon received the first progress report on investigations and BOIs on 14 June.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Mr Hoon’s Assistant Private Secretary responded to the progress report on </p>
<p>18 June, stating that the MOD now had, for the first time, visibility of the extent and </p>
<p>progress of all current investigations.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> The Assistant Private Secretary reported that </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had:</p>
<p>“... noted that the submission has confirmed a number of weaknesses, in particular </p>
<p>the length of time it has taken to complete many of the investigations and the </p>
<p>apparent lack of communication with some of the families on the more protracted </p>
<p>investigations. The Secretary of State [Mr Hoon] will expect to see improvement </p>
<p>in these and the other areas as the Board of Inquiry study recommendations are </p>
<p>implemented. He will also wish to see early results in the work commissioned by </p>
<p>VCDS into the procedural aspects of SIB investigations. It is important that these </p>
<p>workstrands are linked: how many BOIs are delayed because of SIB work? He </p>
<p>will also wish to see progress in the next report on bringing the more protracted </p>

<p>through a single contact (normally the Visiting Officer) who would “act as a sift” </p>
<p>to filter out any insensitive or inconsistent drafting.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Lt Gen Palmer also reported that he had carefully considered a suggestion from </p>
<p>Mr Hoon that the BOI process should include “an individual who is independent of both </p>
<p>MOD and the bereaved family ... who would give a view of whether or not the BOI had </p>
<p>completed its job successfully, before the report was published”, but had concluded that:</p>
<p>“... the purpose for which BOIs are established and the perceived presentational </p>
<p>need to prove to external parties that they carry out their work successfully cannot </p>
<p>sensibly be reconciled.”</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised that including an independent element would delay the BOI </p>
<p>process, “yet bring no guarantee of adding value, credibility or acceptability of a Board’s </p>
<p>findings”. Families’ concerns could largely be met by the “administrative arrangements – </p>
<p>including better communications – already put in place”. </p>
<p><b>122. </b> Ministers returned to the question of whether there should be an independent </p>
<p>member on a BOI in 2007. </p>
<p><b>123. </b> On 30 June, Lt Gen Palmer sent Mr Hoon a progress report on work to improve </p>
<p>the BOI process.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Lt Gen Palmer wrote that it was “clear that we are failing to meet </p>
<p>some families’ expectations in respect of the quality and quantity of information we are </p>
<p>providing to them”. The key to improving the flow of information to families would be </p>
<p>the new Senior Co&#8209;ordinators, who would ensure that BOIs proceeded quickly and that </p>
<p>families were briefed on progress. </p>
<p><b>124. </b> Lt Gen Palmer reflected on the role and impact of the Senior Co&#8209;ordinator in his </p>
<p>evidence to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“... he was responsible for the progress of Boards of Inquiry. If there were delays, </p>
<p>why there were delays and what should be done about it, and keeping, importantly, </p>
<p>the families informed through the visiting officers as to what was going on. </p>

<p>Service Police in Basra were “operating at full stretch and had a considerable </p>
<p>backlog”. A key constraint was that relatively few Service Police investigators </p>
<p>were qualified to Level 3 (able to carry out the investigations into the most </p>

<p>“There can be both avoidable and unavoidable delays, but complex investigations </p>
<p>and the post&#8209;investigative processes do take time and speed must not be at the </p>
<p>expense of quality. That said, some trimming may be possible in respect of the </p>
<p>timescales for some steps in the process.”</p>
<p><b>133. </b> The review recommended that the timescales for the individual steps of the </p>
<p>post&#8209;investigative process should be revalidated. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> The review also identified the practical difficulties in undertaking investigations in  </p>
<p>a non&#8209;permissive environment such as Iraq, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A number of Service Police personnel had been tasked to train the Iraqi Police </p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Service Police needed force protection, which was not always available. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Access to the crime scene and to witnesses could be difficult, and could cause </p>
<p>further tension.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Lt Gen Irwin told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“... as the operation [in Iraq] developed, it began to be something that came to </p>
<p>my attention and, therefore, could be regarded as a possible problem, that the </p>
<p>Royal Military Police were not there in sufficient numbers to do everything that was </p>
<p>required of them in a completely timely fashion.</p>
<p>“Now, of course, when you are trying to investigate incidents when there is shooting </p>
<p>going on, there is always going to be a delay that would not occur in the normal </p>
<p>circumstance, but nevertheless I began to get a feeling that maybe there were not </p>
<p>enough military police in Iraq and maybe also that, extrapolating from that, there </p>
<p>were not enough military policemen ... in the British Army.</p>
<p>“So I spent – I would not say every day, but quite regularly I used to speak to the </p>
<p>Provost Marshal (Army) and ask him the direct question, looking at him in the eye, </p>
<p>‘Have we got an issue here? Are your people bearing up to the strain? Are they </p>

<p>Russell Aston, Corporal Paul Long, Corporal Simon Miller, Lance Corporal Benjamin </p>
<p>Hyde, and Lance Corporal Thomas Keys – were killed at Majarr al Kabir in Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Hoon informed the House of Commons on 17 November 2004 that a BOI into that </p>
<p>incident had now completed its work.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> Because of the “wider parliamentary and public </p>
<p>interest”, the MOD had taken the unusual step of providing a summary of the BOI’s </p>
<p>findings to Parliament and to the media. The families of those who died would be briefed </p>
<p>by the President of the BOI, and would subsequently meet Mr Hoon to discuss the BOI’s </p>
<p>findings and any concerns they might have.</p>
<p>Continued criminal investigation prevented the BOI from considering the events that were </p>
<p>the direct cause of the six deaths, but Mr Hoon informed the House:</p>
<p>“The Board found that the incident at Al Majarr Al Kabir was a surprise attack, which </p>
<p>could not reasonably have been predicted. The Board also found that a number of </p>
<p>factors may potentially have had a bearing on the deaths of the six soldiers, including </p>
<p>issues relating to ammunition, communications and command relationships within </p>
<p>the battle group to which the Royal Military Police platoon was attached. The Board </p>
<p>was not, however, able to state that any of these factors, either in isolation or in </p>
<p>combination directly determined the six soldiers’ fate.”</p>
<p>Mr Hoon went on to acknowledge:</p>
<p>“I am aware that some of the families have been critical of the Army’s response </p>
<p>to the deaths of the six soldiers. I hope they recognise the Board’s work for the </p>
<p>thorough and detailed review that it is. I hope, too, that they now have a much better </p>
<p>understanding of the events leading up to the death of their loved ones and the wider </p>
<p>context in which the events occurred, and can take some comfort from this.”</p>

<p><b>137. </b> The 2005 review stated that, in relation to investigations on operations, “delay  </p>

<p>the Service Police. </p>

<p><b>Changes to MOD processes</b></p>
<p><b>140. </b> AM Pocock wrote to Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, on 17 August </p>
<p>2006 proposing that the timeline for conducting BOIs should be increased from 14 to </p>
<p>27 weeks.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> The MOD was operating at “maximum efficiency, within resources” but, </p>
<p>for the Army in particular, experience since the current timeline was introduced in June </p>
<p>2004 had shown that it was “not achievable”. No Army BOI had met the current 14&#8209;week </p>
<p>timeline. The Royal Navy and RAF did not have a problem with the current timeline but </p>
<p>“saw merit” in extending it. </p>
<p><b>141. </b> AM Pocock summarised the problems in meeting the current timelines:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not possible to produce a Convening Order and Terms of Reference </p>
<p>(TORs) for a BOI within 48 hours (as the current timeline required). TORs were </p>
<p>often dependent on Service Police or LAIT reports, which could take “several </p>
<p>months” to produce. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not possible to “staff” a BOI report (secure comments from advisers and </p>
<p>senior officers) within six weeks. </p>
<p><b>142. </b> AM Pocock advised that underlying those problems was a resource issue.  </p>
<p>The Army was currently required to convene up to 20 BOIs a month (compared with </p>
<p>one or two for the Royal Navy and RAF). It took time to identify and nominate suitable </p>
<p>experienced and available Presidents, to confirm the Terms of Reference, and for </p>
<p>officers to consider a BOI report. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> AM Pocock closed his advice:</p>
<p>“Delays in completing BOIs have been linked in the media to delays in Coroners’ </p>
<p>inquests. Some families ... have also been critical of the time it takes to complete </p>
<p>BOIs. It is, however, unlikely that extending the BOI timeline will attract significant </p>
<p>media coverage.”</p>
<p><b>144. </b> In an annex to his minute, AM Pocock analysed the reasons for delays in </p>
<p>completing BOIs. It concluded that progress had been made since 2004 but that, </p>

<p>104</p>
<p>against a background of an increasing number of incidents, “the rate of closure has now </p>
<p>remained more or less constant since January 2005”. </p>
<p><b>Creation of the Army Inquest Cell</b></p>
<p><b>145. </b> In February 2007, in response to Ministerial concerns over the MOD’s support </p>
<p>for the inquests into the deaths of Sergeant Steven Roberts and Lance Corporal of </p>
<p>Horse Matthew “Matty” Hull, the Army established a small Army Inquest Cell with a </p>
<p>remit to, “through more effective handling of documents and stakeholders ... provide a </p>
<p>better co&#8209;ordinated service to the Department [MOD], the coroner, and to the bereaved </p>
<p>families”.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> Mr Ingram was advised that the Army’s existing arrangements had been </p>
<p>unable to manage the volume of work associated with inquests. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> An MOD official advised Mr Ingram in March that good progress was being made </p>
<p>in clearing the “backlog” of Army BOIs.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> The Army Inquest Cell had “now assumed the </p>
<p>role of managing of the Inquest process”, allowing the Army Inquiries and Aftercare </p>
<p>Support Cell (AIASC) to revert to its primary role of supporting bereaved families. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> In June, Mr Ingram informed the House of Commons that the Army was planning  </p>
<p>to appoint permanent Presidents for BOIs, in order to deliver a more consistent </p>
<p>approach and avoid delays.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>148. </b> In January 2008, Mr Giles Ahern, MOD Deputy Director Personnel with </p>
<p>responsibility for the Army Inquest Cell, advised General Sir Richard Dannatt, Chief of </p>
<p>the General Staff, that the team had made “significant progress” in reducing the time </p>
<p>taken to hold an inquest.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Ahern advised that, despite this progress, Ministers remained “very concerned” </p>
<p>about the MOD’s performance. The Army Inquest Cell was focusing on: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The provision of information to families. In the past, families had received little </p>
<p>formal information before the inquest about how their relative had died. AIASC </p>
<p>now provided a “Record of Events” based on SIB findings, but that might only </p>
<p>reach the family just before the inquest. The Cell was developing an “Initial </p>
<p>Account” containing “some basic information”, which could be passed to families </p>
<p>about one month after a death. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Timely completion of SIB and BOI reports. In a number of cases, completion </p>
<p>of SIB and BOI reports was “judged to have taken longer than necessary”. </p>
<p>The Cell was trying to “expedite” completion and sign&#8209;off of reports by the </p>
<p>chain of command. </p>

<p><b>Reducing the number of redactions in BOI reports released to families</b></p>
<p><b>150. </b> The MOD released redacted versions of BOI reports to the next of kin and </p>
<p>coroners. The version released to the next of kin was redacted to remove personal </p>
<p>information relating to third parties, and security and operationally sensitive information. </p>
<p>The version released to the coroner was redacted to remove certain security and </p>
<p>operationally sensitive information only, with a request that the report was not introduced </p>
<p>into court.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>151. </b> The inclusion of the names of third parties in the version of the BOI released to the </p>
<p>coroner allowed the coroner to identity potential witnesses for the inquest. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> In November 2006, Ms Selena Lynch, Deputy Assistant Coroner for Oxfordshire, </p>
<p>directed the MOD to provide a “full set of papers” to a bereaved family’s legal team and </p>
<p>indicated that she might consider a legal challenge if the MOD did not comply.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Chris Baker, MOD Director General Service Personnel, advised Mr Ingram on </p>
<p>22 January 2007: </p>
<p>“It is evident that the manner in which some of the BOI reports have been redacted, </p>
<p>by blocking out the names and text ... renders them unintelligible. Families and their </p>
<p>respective Counsel claim that because they are unable to follow the narrative of </p>
<p>the BOI it is difficult to consider whether to request the coroner to invite additional </p>
<p>witnesses.”</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr Baker stated that the MOD’s position was that the redaction of the names of </p>
<p>third parties was necessary “to comply with both our responsibilities in accordance with </p>
<p>the Data Protection Act 1998, and in common law, as an employer to protect the identity </p>
<p>of current and former employees”. </p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Baker concluded that to meet the concerns of families and the coroner, the </p>
<p>MOD would replace the names of third parties with unique identifiers (such as Person </p>
<p>AA and Officer BB), which would enable families to follow the narrative of the BOI report </p>
<p>more easily while still protecting individual identities.</p>

<p><b>156. </b> The MOD issued revised instructions for the disclosure of BOI reports in May.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The instructions advised that following the full implementation of the FOI Act on </p>
<p>1 January 2005, the current policy (of limited release of BOI reports outside the MOD) </p>
<p>was no longer sustainable; the underlying principle of the FOI Act was that information </p>
<p>should be available to members of the public on request unless it had an absolute </p>
<p>exemption or there was an overriding public interest in withholding it. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> The way in which BOIs were conducted would not change, but the reports should </p>
<p>now be prepared in two parts:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Part 1, which would be generally known as the “BOI Report”, should include the </p>
<p>convening order, terms of reference, findings, recommendations, and comments </p>
<p>from senior officers. It should be carefully structured to ensure that it contained </p>
<p>no exempt material or, if that was not possible, suitably redacted. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Part 2 would include all other supporting documentation including witness </p>
<p>statements and police and investigative reports. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> There would also be a separate master “Schedule of Proceedings”, listing </p>
<p>everything that constituted the full BOI Report. </p>
<p><b>159. </b> Part 1 of the full BOI Report would be proactively published by the MOD under </p>
<p>their Publication Scheme. Requests for further information would be considered under </p>
<p>the FOI Act in the normal way. Applicants could be provided with the Schedule of </p>
<p>Proceedings to help them refine their request. </p>
<p><b>160. </b> Next of kin should, in the first instance, be given only Part 1 of a BOI Report. </p>
<p>Requests for information from Part 2 would be treated in the same way as other FOI </p>
<p>requests (although it would normally be inappropriate to redact non&#8209;sensitive personal </p>
<p>information about the family member). The instructions stated:</p>
<p>“Although this may be seen as restricting what is given to next of kin, it should </p>
<p>be borne in mind that Part 1 ... will be a synthesis of all the relevant information </p>
<p>presented to the Board. Although the next of kin should always be treated in a </p>
<p>sympathetic and helpful manner, the provisions of the FOI Act and DPA98 and  </p>
<p>other relevant legislation and common law must be observed.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Coroners would “continue to be provided with the full unredacted copy of the report </p>
<p>(Parts 1 and 2)”, on the understanding that the report contained only information owned </p>
<p>by the UK and was not quoted from or admitted into evidence without further reference </p>
<p>to the MOD. </p>

<p>that she had stated that the inquest had been delayed by the MOD’s failure to provide </p>
<p>documents and their policy of redacting names from the documents that were provided.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>165. </b> Sir Bill Jeffrey advised Mr Ainsworth in February 2008, in the context of a paper on </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Ingram subsequently met Mr Baker and other MOD officials to discuss work </p>
<p>already in hand to improve the BOI process.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Mr Ingram’s Private Secretary recorded </p>
<p>that Mr Ingram: </p>
<p>“... postulated that there might be a need to consider a more radical approach;  </p>
<p>that rather than working to make the current system work better, we might need  </p>
<p>to consider adopting a different system.” </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Baker said that he had already discussed the possibility of a more radical </p>
<p>approach with the Services, and concluded that “there was no realistic alternative to </p>
<p>the BOI process”. The MOD needed a thorough process of examination in order to </p>
<p>learn lessons, and needed to be able to ensure that it could be undertaken quickly and </p>
<p>address all the relevant issues. Mr Baker advised that the arguments for continuing with </p>
<p>the BOI process would be set out in a submission. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> An MOD official working in Mr Baker’s Directorate sent Mr Ingram’s Private Office </p>
<p>advice on the “rationale for continuing with the BOI process” on 2 March.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The official identified three alternative mechanisms for establishing the facts </p>
<p>surrounding an incident – Learning Accounts, Service Police investigations, and inquests </p>
<p>– and concluded that none of them met the MOD’s requirements.</p>
<p><b>175. </b> The official concluded that the current BOI system played a “valuable role” in </p>
<p>“establishing the full details of the circumstances surrounding an incident and in learning </p>
<p>the lessons to prevent a recurrence”. Particular advantages were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>BOIs enabled the MOD to fulfil its duty of care and health and safety obligations </p>
<p>towards its employees. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Investigations into sensitive matters could be carried out “within the Service </p>
<p>environment and by the relevant subject matter experts”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As BOIs did not seek to apportion blame, and evidence given to a BOI could not </p>
<p>be used in a Service court, witnesses might be more candid than in another type </p>
<p>of investigation. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>BOIs were “tried and tested and worked well”.</p>
<p>The official also described the work under way to improve the BOI process. </p>
<p><b>176. </b> The BOI report into the loss of Nimrod XV230 in September 2006 (in Afghanistan) </p>
<p>was published on 4 December 2007. Mr Browne told the House of Commons on the </p>
<p>same day:</p>
<p>“By its nature, the Board was not in a position to go into the history of those </p>
<p>arrangements [for assessing the airworthiness of Nimrod aircraft] or to assess </p>
<p>where responsibility lies for failures ... Flying will never be risk&#8209;free. But I do believe </p>

<p>109</p>
<p>that the families of those who died are due more of an explanation of the history </p>

<p>put in place a review of the arrangements for assuring the airworthiness and safe </p>
<p>operation of the Nimrod aircraft over its service life; to assess where responsibility </p>
<p>lies for any failures; to assess more broadly the process for compiling safety cases, </p>
<p>taking account of best practice in the civilian and military world; and to make </p>
<p>recommendations.”</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Browne discussed the BOI into the loss of Nimrod XV230 with MOD Ministerial </p>
<p>colleagues the following day.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> He said that the MOD would shortly announce the name </p>
<p>of the Queen’s Counsel who would lead the independent review. It would be important </p>
<p>for the families to be able to feed their questions into that process. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> During the meeting, MOD Ministers concluded that the Nimrod BOI was “a further </p>
<p>example of the [BOI] process not necessarily being suited to the requirements of the </p>
<p>MOD, the individuals and families involved and, crucially, public expectation”. Mr Browne </p>
<p>suggested that there might be merit in a new process comprising:</p>
<p>“... a short, focused Learning Account style review ... conducted in a matter of a </p>
<p>few months followed, as required, by a further review to look beyond the immediate </p>
<p>circumstances and which was empowered to engage with individuals and the </p>
<p>families affected by the incident, had an independent element and could draw </p>
<p>from the advice of those who were well&#8209;practiced in preparing for evidence&#8209;based </p>
<p>reviews”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary asked Mr Bill Jeffrey, the MOD’s Permanent Under </p>

<p> to provide “advice on the scope and options for improving the BOI process” </p>
<p>by the end of January. </p>

<p>reporting Mr Browne’s concern that recent good progress in clearing the backlog of </p>
<p>inquests would not be sustained as the military investigation/BOI process was moving </p>
<p>too slowly.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> Particular concerns included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The significant number of cases (13) over six months that were still awaiting </p>
<p>completion of a BOI or RMP investigation, or even a decision on whether a BOI </p>
<p>was required. In one case, a decision on whether to hold a BOI was still awaited </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Browne asked Mr Ainsworth to look into the backlog of incomplete BOIs and </p>
<p>“investigate what further action should be taken to speed up this process, including </p>
<p>whether additional staff resource is needed in theatre”.</p>
<p><b>182. </b> On 28 February, Mr Ainsworth and Ms Bridget Prentice (Parliamentary </p>
<p>Under&#8209;Secretary of State for the Ministry of Justice), met Mr Andrew Walker </p>
<p>(Assistant Deputy Coroner for Oxfordshire) and Mr David Masters (Coroner for </p>
<p>Wiltshire &amp; Swindon), at Mr Ainsworth’s request, to discuss what could be done </p>
<p>to accelerate the inquest process.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Ms Prentice’s Assistant Private Secretary recorded that Mr Walker had welcomed </p>
<p>the new Army Inquest Cell, which had had “a profound effect” on the conduct of inquests </p>
<p>into the deaths of Army Personnel. Working with the Cell, he had trialed a number of </p>
<p>proposals to improve and streamline the inquest process.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Walker described how that new partnership had worked in a recent inquest: </p>
<p>“Despite the fact that there was extremely sensitive intelligence involved, the inquest </p>
<p>was completed within 12 months from the date of the incident. The key difference </p>
<p>was that he [Mr Walker] had been in contact with the Board of Inquiry (BOI) team </p>
<p>from the beginning of their investigation and was kept informed throughout, enabling </p>
<p>him sufficient time to build up the technical knowledge required to adequately </p>
<p>conduct the inquest. Crucially, this early involvement avoided the complicated ‘cold’ </p>
<p>handover from the BOI to the inquest.”</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Both coroners felt that the new arrangement enabled them to update families more </p>
<p>effectively on progress and to respond to their needs.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Both coroners contrasted that positive experience, with their experiences with </p>
<p>the Royal Navy and RAF. In one case, they said that they had had to wait four months </p>
<p>“for a signature on a piece of paper”. In four cases, it was alleged to have taken over </p>
<p>a year to reach a decision on whether or not to hold a BOI. The coroners felt that the </p>
<p>establishment of a tri&#8209;Service Inquest Cell based on the Army model would be a “very </p>
<p>positive step”. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> The MOD team confirmed that the idea of a tri&#8209;Service Inquest Cell was being </p>
<p>considered, and highlighted the greater complexity often associated with Royal Navy </p>
<p>and RAF BOIs.</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Ainsworth told the Inquiry that he had considered the end&#8209;to&#8209;end process of </p>
<p>investigating fatalities and had taken the unusual step of meeting both Mr Walker and </p>
<p>Mr Masters to discuss ways in which the MOD could help.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> He recalled some anxiety </p>
<p>that a meeting might be seen as interfering with the coroners’ independence, but he </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.3  |  Military fatalities and the bereaved</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>believed that it was possible both to respect that independence and to seek  </p>
<p>to understand “how the system is working for them from their point of view”.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Sir Bill Jeffrey responded to the requests for advice on how the BOI process  </p>
<p>could be improved and how the existing process could be accelerated in a minute  </p>
<p>to Mr Ainsworth at the end of February 2008.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Sir Bill advised that, in response to Mr Browne’s question, it would be possible to </p>
<p>hold a relatively short fact&#8209;finding exercise followed by a “fuller inquiry into the whole </p>
<p>course of events”. While the Nimrod XV230 BOI included a careful investigation of the </p>
<p>incident itself, its remit did not extend into the history and safety record of the Nimrod; </p>
<p>that question was now being examined by Mr Charles Haddon&#8209;Cave. Where there was </p>
<p>“a need to capture the broader departmental perspective, and where there is high public </p>
<p>interest in the case”, the remit of the BOI could be broadened or a “further reaching </p>
<p>independent inquiry”, running concurrently with the BOI, could be held. </p>
<p><b>191. </b> Sir Bill also advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A new direction should be issued to the chain of command, that families should </p>
<p>always be briefed as soon as practicable after an incident and kept regularly </p>
<p>informed thereafter.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A new joint Secretariat should be established, building on the Army’s Inquest </p>
<p>Cell, to co&#8209;ordinate all three Services’ management of inquests, the relationship </p>
<p>with coroners and joint reports to Ministers. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> The Army had appointed Permanent Presidents to lead high&#8209;profile Army BOIs;  </p>
<p>the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force were taking steps to establish “pools of expertise” </p>
<p>from which Presidents could be selected. </p>
<p><b>193. </b> There were currently 100 open inquests. That was “below last summer’s </p>
<p>peak of 132, but still well above the backlog of 80 inquests that was judged to be </p>
<p>unacceptable in Spring 2006”. The use of pre&#8209;inquest hearings, while a valuable </p>
<p>contribution to the inquest process, could introduce delays into the process. Coroners </p>
<p>often waited for access to the MOD’s reports, including BOI reports, before undertaking </p>
<p>an inquest. Sir Bill commented: “We must show coroners that we treat our investigations </p>
<p>as matters of urgency so that we might expect them to do the same.” </p>
<p><b>194. </b> On 9 April, Mr Ainsworth met senior officials and military officers to discuss Sir Bill’s </p>
<p>advice.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> Mr Ainsworth stated that he and Mr Browne remained of the view that there </p>
<p>needed to be a “step change in the way in which the BOI and inquest process was </p>
<p>handled, end&#8209;to&#8209;end”. He had already discussed the advice with Sir Bill, and agreed that </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>it formed “a good basis for further discussion”. The key proposal was the establishment </p>
<p>of a “single inquest cell”. </p>
<p><b>195. </b> The meeting agreed that a single inquest cell should be established as a matter  </p>
<p>of urgency. Key responsibilities would be to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>professionally manage the MOD’s relationship with coroners;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>chase progress on BOIs in order to “drive down” the time between incident and </p>
<p>inquest; it would need sufficient “authority and clout” to do that;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identify weaknesses in policy and ensure they were addressed, and ensure that </p>
<p>existing policy and best practice was adhered to; the lead for developing policy </p>
<p>would often sit outside the cell; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure the right training and guidance was provided to VOs. </p>
<p><b>196. </b> The cell would not carry out BOIs (which would continue to be the responsibility for </p>
<p>the Services). </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Ainsworth’s Private Secretary recorded that, although the other proposals made </p>
<p>by Sir Bill had not been discussed in any detail at the meeting, Mr Ainsworth would like </p>
<p>them “taken forward in the context of the establishment of the new cell”. </p>
<p><b>198. </b> The Defence Inquests Unit (DIU) was created in May 2008 to act as the focal point </p>
<p>for all coroners’ inquests into the deaths of Service and MOD civilian personnel.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>199. </b> The Army Inquest Cell was disbanded on the creation of the DIU, and its posts </p>
<p>moved into the DIU.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>200. </b> Mr Ainsworth told the Inquiry that the role of the DIU was not just to ensure that the </p>
<p>MOD was providing the support that coroners required:</p>
<p>“… my motives were more than just helping the bereaved, they were about the MOD </p>
<p>getting better at learning some of the lessons that flowed from inquests … some </p>
<p>of our systems were, from time to time, exposed pretty badly by coroners’ inquests </p>
<p>and, you know, they were a mine of information … if you were prepared to really </p>
<p>embrace the findings …”</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Mike Venables, Head of the DIU from 2009 to 2012, described the DIU’s role </p>
<p>as supporting bereaved families by making sure that coroners had everything they </p>
<p>needed.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> This included:</p>

<p><b>202. </b> Mr Venables also indicated that the creation of the DIU served to change the </p>

<p><b>Introduction of Service Inquiries</b></p>
<p><b>203. </b> Section 343 of the Armed Forces Act 2006 (AFA 2006), which came into force on </p>
<p>1 October 2008, provided for the establishment of a single form of statutory inquiry – the </p>
<p>Service Inquiry (SI) – for all the Services.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>204. </b> The Royal Navy, Army and RAF had previously held inquiries under the </p>
<p>Prerogative, Army Act 1955 and Air Force Act 1955 respectively. </p>
<p><b>205. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the AFA 2006 represented the first complete </p>
<p>overhaul of the Service justice system in 50 years, harmonising practices and </p>
<p>procedures across the Services to provide a single system of Service law. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> The MOD also told the Inquiry that SIs had the same purpose as BOIs (subject </p>
<p>to its terms of reference, to establish the facts of a particular matter and make </p>
<p>recommendations to prevent recurrence). </p>

<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Don Touhig, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Defence, told </p>
<p>the House of Commons in early June 2005 that the decision to provide support to </p>

<p>the deaths of Service Personnel.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>212. </b> A June 2007 DCA briefing assessed that that support had “little effect” on the </p>
<p>backlog.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> The main constraint was the time that Mr Gardiner himself was able to </p>
<p>devote to considering case papers in preparation for inquests. </p>
<p><b>213. </b> On 6 February 2006, Ms Harriet Harman, Minister of State for the DCA, informed </p>
<p>the House of Commons that she intended to bring forward legislation to reform the </p>

<p><b>“</b>Under the current coroner service, families frequently get overlooked during the </p>

<p>is not accountable ... Standards are not uniformly good; everything rests too much </p>
<p>on the personal qualities and abilities of individuals within the system. The legal </p>

<p><b>216. </b> Ms Harman wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The DCA had been endeavouring to get a full picture of the extent of the delays, </p>
<p>working with MOD officials and Mr Gardiner’s Office, and had compiled a grid </p>
<p>showing the number of inquests yet to be undertaken. That analysis indicated </p>
<p>that there were 39 military deaths and 5 civilian deaths relating to Iraq in the </p>
<p>“inquest queue”, excluding cases where Mr Gardiner was waiting for evidential </p>
<p>material from the MOD. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The first military deaths in that queue related to the loss of a Sea King helicopter </p>
<p>on 22 March 2003.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> The first deaths on which Mr Gardiner had not yet </p>
<p>received material from the MOD related to the loss of a CH46 helicopter on </p>
<p>21 March 2003. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Gardiner estimated that to clear the backlog, he would need an additional </p>
<p>Assistant Deputy Coroner and continued funding for the additional Coroner’s </p>
<p>Officer, at a cost of £125,000 a year for two years. DCA officials had not yet </p>
<p>assessed whether that estimate was realistic. The DCA was “poorly placed” to </p>
<p>provide that funding. If those resources could not be found, the current position </p>
<p>that most inquests were held in Oxfordshire (rather than in the home area of  </p>
<p>the deceased) would need to be reconsidered. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> Ms Harman, Mr Browne and Mr Ingram met on 24 May.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> Ms Harman advised </p>
<p>that further work by DCA officials suggested that £250,000 would be required over six </p>
<p>months in order to list or complete all cases by the end of the year. </p>
<p><b>218. </b> A record of the meeting by Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary, which </p>
<p>was circulated only within the MOD, reported that Mr Browne had agreed that if </p>
<p>there was a “practical plan” to reduce the backlog and there was no possibility of </p>
<p>securing funding from the Reserve, then he was “prepared in principle to put in </p>
<p>£125,000 for the first year”.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> An informal record of the meeting by a DCA official reported that Mr Browne had </p>
<p>agreed to provide £125,000, and to hold a further £125,000 “in reserve” which could be </p>
<p>made available depending on progress.</p>

<p>117</p>
<p>The discussions between the DCA, the MOD, and the Treasury from July 2006 to </p>
<p>February 2007 on that issue are described below. </p>
<p><b>230. </b> The DCA bore the costs that were being incurred by the Oxfordshire Coroner’s </p>
<p>office while those discussions continued.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DISCUSSIONS ON FUNDING</p>
<p><b>231. </b> On 22 May 2006, Mr Alex Allan, Permanent Secretary at the DCA, and Mr Ian </p>
<p>Andrews, 2nd Permanent Under Secretary at the MOD, discussed how the additional </p>
<p>funding required by the Oxfordshire Coroner might be found.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> Mr Allan’s Assistant </p>
<p>Private Secretary reported that Mr Allan had stated that neither the local authority </p>
<p>nor the DCA could provide that additional funding. Mr Andrews said that the Treasury </p>
<p>met the MOD’s “operational costs”, and indicated that the funding for the Oxfordshire </p>
<p>Coroner should be included within that arrangement.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> That would be for the MOD to </p>
<p>explore with the Treasury. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> On 20 July, Ms Harman sent Mr Browne an update on progress on clearing the </p>
<p>backlog of inquests, and concluded that she “hoped that we can clarify the amount  </p>
<p>of money you will pay”.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>233. </b> On the same day, Ms Harman wrote to Lord Falconer of Thoroton, the Secretary </p>
<p>of State for Constitutional Affairs and Lord Chancellor, asking if he would speak </p>
<p>to Mr Browne to ensure that Mr Browne’s decision to provide £250,000 would be </p>
<p>communicated to MOD finance officials.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Browne replied to Ms Harman on 14 August stating that, as he had previously </p>
<p>indicated, given that the inquests were a result of operational commitments, his </p>
<p>preference would be for the additional funding to be sought through a call against the </p>
<p>Reserve.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> He stood ready to support a request to the Treasury. If funding could not </p>
<p>be secured from the Reserve, he was “in principle willing to provide a contribution of </p>
<p>£125,000 for the first year towards the financial costs of the additional resources, subject </p>
<p>to Accounting Officer and Treasury approval”.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Lord Falconer wrote to Mr Browne later that month, stating that £125,000 was </p>
<p>insufficient to cover the costs involved and that, while DCA officials would look at the </p>
<p>suggestion of making a bid on the Reserve, “given that the backlog is driven by the </p>

<p>MOD’s policy to repatriate Iraq fatalities to RAF Brize Norton in Oxfordshire” it would  </p>
<p>not be appropriate for the DCA to make that bid.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>236. </b> Mr Browne replied on 10 September, stating that while there was a strong case  </p>
<p>for funding the additional costs from the Reserve, the Treasury would expect the bid  </p>
<p>to come from the Department responsible for coronial policy.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Lord Falconer replied on 6 October, advising that while the DCA held policy </p>
<p>responsibility for coroners, operational responsibility rested with the relevant local </p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> In this case, it would normally be for Oxfordshire County Council to meet  </p>
<p>the costs of the inquests. He continued: </p>
<p>“The Cabinet Office Ministerial Code of Conduct (paragraph 6.10) clearly sets out </p>
<p>the principle that Departments responsible for initiating policy are required to take </p>
<p>into account the effect their proposals have on other departments. It is MOD policy </p>
<p>to repatriate bodies to RAF Brize Norton rather than Lyneham, Fairford or elsewhere </p>
<p>and it is a direct result of this decision that the backlog of cases has occurred. If </p>
<p>fatalities were shared amongst a number of coroners this problem would have </p>
<p>been avoided.</p>
<p>“It is for this reason that I consider that it is your Department’s responsibility to </p>
<p>shoulder the costs arising from the Iraq inquest backlog ... If you are unable to fund </p>
<p>the additional resources from your existing budget then it is for your Department,  </p>
<p>not mine, to approach the Treasury for a Reserve claim.”</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Officials from the MOD, the DCA and the Department for Communities and Local </p>
<p>Government (DCLG) met on 8 November to discuss funding options.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>239. </b> A DCA official reported to DCA colleagues only that all three departments had </p>
<p>difficulties in providing funding from within their existing budgets. The MOD had argued, </p>
<p>for the first time, that it would be inappropriate for the MOD to be seen to be funding </p>
<p>the inquest process when it had a clear interest in the cases involved. The meeting </p>
<p>had agreed that DCA officials should approach the Treasury informally to see whether </p>
<p>funding from the Reserve could be made available and, if not, whether they could </p>
<p>suggest an alternative solution. </p>
<p><b>240. </b> A DCA official advised Ms Harman on 13 December that the Treasury had “not </p>
<p>replied positively” to that approach.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> The DCA had subsequently written to the MOD, </p>
<p>asking it to confirm that it would provide the necessary funding. </p>

<p>16.3  |  Military fatalities and the bereaved</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>241. </b> On 7 January 2007, Mr Lee McCauley, MOD Assistant Director of Defence </p>
<p>Resources and Plans, wrote to a Treasury official to advise him that the MOD had </p>
<p>“reluctantly concluded” that all additional costs related to the Oxfordshire Coroner should </p>
<p>be “funded this year through Defence”.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> There were several arguments against doing </p>
<p>so, but Ministers wanted the issue to be resolved. Treasury approval would be required, </p>
<p>as the MOD did not have authority to meet costs that fell to other parts of Government. </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr McCauley proposed that the MOD treat the costs as part of the Net </p>
<p>Additional Cost of Military Operations (NACMO), and claim them from the Treasury  </p>
<p>in the normal way. If that was not possible, the MOD would need to find the funds within </p>
<p>its core settlement. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> On 13 February 2007, Mr Browne wrote to Ms Harman: </p>
<p>“My officials have explored at length with the Treasury the possibility of making a </p>
<p>claim against the Reserve. The Treasury have refused on the principle that such </p>
<p>costs should lie where they fall and this is not a legitimate charge to Defence for </p>
<p>the additional costs of operations. In light of this, I cannot accept an argument </p>
<p>that the backlog stems solely from MOD policy: there are sound practical reasons </p>
<p>for repatriation of bodies to RAF Brize Norton but there are also, as the current </p>
<p>initiative</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> shows, ways in which the burden may be shared with other coroners.”</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Browne concluded by confirming that he held to his earlier offer to contribute </p>
<p>£125,000 towards the additional costs of the Oxfordshire Coroner during 2006/07.  </p>
<p>That contribution should not be seen as setting a precedent for MOD funding to address </p>
<p>“future inquest backlogs, should they arise”. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> Ms Harman replied on 27 March, expressing her disappointment with that </p>
<p>contribution but confirming that she would accept it.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> She would expect the MOD  </p>
<p>to contribute if further backlogs emerged.</p>

<p><b>253. </b> A DCA official advised Ms Harman on 6 October that Mr Gardiner’s office was now </p>
<p>receiving a significant number of fatalities from Afghanistan, as well as from Iraq.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>additional resources announced on 5 June only covered inquests that were outstanding </p>
<p>at that date. The DCA had “serious doubts” that Mr Gardiner’s office could handle the </p>
<p>new (post&#8209;June 2006) cases, once the pre&#8209;June backlog was cleared and staffing levels </p>
<p>returned to normal. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> The official commented that it was not helpful that the MOD continued to repatriate </p>
<p>bodies to RAF Brize Norton: DCA and MOD officials were meeting shortly to discuss </p>
<p>that issue. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> MOD and DCA officials met on 18 October to reconsider the policy of repatriating </p>
<p>the bodies of deceased Service Personnel via RAF Brize Norton.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> Points made in the </p>
<p>discussion included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Gardiner was “considering transferring cases to other jurisdictions, but in </p>
<p>limited circumstances”. That was in line with established policy. Mr Gardiner </p>
<p>would not be transferring cases where there were multiple deaths in a single </p>
<p>incident, and all transfers required the agreement of the receiving coroner. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Arrangements for inquests relating to incidents in 2003 and 2004 were “well in </p>
<p>hand”, but there were still “serious delays” to later inquests and the number of </p>
<p>bodies repatriated to RAF Brize Norton was increasing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>One unavoidable factor behind those delays was the need to wait for a BOI  </p>
<p>to conclude before beginning an inquest. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was crucial to keep families informed of progress.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD officials felt that Mr Gardiner and his officers provided effective support  </p>
<p>to families through the inquest process. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DCA officials considered that Mr Gardiner’s office would be unable to cope with </p>
<p>the workload once the additional resources provided by the Government were </p>
<p>removed. </p>

<p><b>256. </b> The meeting considered a number of options, and agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD should continue to use RAF Brize Norton.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD policy should be amended, so that when a death occurred (and before the </p>
<p>body was repatriated), the appropriate local coroner would be alerted that the </p>
<p>body of the deceased would be coming into their district. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The body would be taken to the local coroner immediately after the repatriation </p>
<p>ceremony. Such a policy “would avoid the need to involve the Oxfordshire </p>
<p>Coroner at all”. </p>
<p><b>257. </b> Ms Harman wrote to Mr Gardiner on 17 November, following up on discussions </p>
<p>between Mr Gardiner and DCA officials, to seek his views on that approach.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>258. </b> Mr Gardiner replied on 21 November, recalling that the Coroner’s Act required </p>
<p>him to hold an inquest if he was informed that a body was within his jurisdiction and the </p>
<p>death appeared violent or unnatural, and advised:</p>
<p>“In practice it is inevitable that I will be informed, either directly or through my </p>
<p>Officers, of any bodies in my jurisdiction. Indeed ... I would be failing in my duties  </p>
<p>if I had not over the years established appropriate lines of communication.”</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>259. </b> Mr Gardiner also advised that he had had informal discussions with a number of </p>
<p>coroners, and most of them had indicated that they would accept transfers from him </p>
<p>under Section 14 of the Coroners Act. Since he had alerted coroners to the likelihood </p>
<p>that he would be transferring more cases (in early September), he had transferred  </p>
<p>three cases.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> On 4 December, Ms Harman met relatives of Service Personnel killed in Iraq to </p>
<p>discuss their experience of the investigation and inquest process and the coroners’ </p>
<p>service.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> The meeting, which was facilitated by an external organisation called Opinion </p>
<p>Leader, was attended by 17 relatives from 12 families. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> A record of the meeting by a DCA official highlighted relatives’ concern over the </p>
<p>distance they had to travel to inquests (there was a “particular difficulty” with Scottish </p>
<p>fatalities as there was no discretion to hold a Fatal Accident Inquiry in Scotland where </p>
<p>the death occurred overseas), and the perceived failure of the MOD to provide them </p>
<p>with all documentation before the inquest.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> The official commented that the Oxfordshire </p>
<p>Coroner had been encouraged to transfer cases to other coroners. The DCA was also </p>
<p>exploring ways to transfer a body directly to a local coroner. </p>

<p>123</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Discussions on whether a Fatal Accident Inquiry could be held for all Scottish </p>
<p>fatalities are addressed later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> On 13 December, a DCA official advised Ms Harman that the Oxfordshire </p>
<p>Coroner’s office continued to receive a significant number of fatalities from Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan (15 and 33 respectively, since June).</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> The DCA continued to have serious </p>
<p>doubts about whether it could cope with that workload. The Coroner’s office had “raised </p>
<p>the possibility” of extending the additional staff until all inquests (pre&#8209; and post&#8209;June </p>
<p>2006) had been cleared, but the DCA had advised them that that would be a matter  </p>
<p>for Oxfordshire County Council.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Ms Harman told the House of Commons on 18 December that, following the </p>
<p>4 December meeting, the DCA was “working on providing families with better information </p>
<p>about the inquest system, how we can help families to have access to all material </p>
<p>relevant to the inquest, and holding inquests closer to where the relatives live”.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Ms Harman wrote to Mr Browne on the same day, highlighting five areas identified </p>
<p>at the 4 December meeting where changes might improve a family’s experience: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Holding the inquest closer to the family’s home, rather than in Oxford. The DCA </p>
<p>was encouraging Mr Gardiner to transfer cases to other coroners as a way of </p>
<p>reducing his backlog. Another possibility would be to repatriate the bodies of </p>
<p>deceased Service Personnel directly to the family’s local coroner without any </p>
<p>involvement by the Oxfordshire Coroner.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Creating an information pack for families of deceased Service Personnel which </p>
<p>described what to expect from an inquest and where to go for further support. </p>
<p>Ms Harman suggested that DCA and MOD officials should discuss the contents </p>
<p>of the pack.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establishing a “victims’ advocate service” for families, similar to the Coroner’s </p>
<p>Court Support Service but tailored to address the particular problems of families </p>
<p>of those killed abroad and in conflict. The service could build on the support </p>
<p>already provided by Visiting Officers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ensuring earlier and more complete advance disclosure of documents and key </p>
<p>facts to families. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ending the practice of charging families for access to documents, including </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>266. </b> The Opinion Leader record of the 4 December meeting, which issued in January </p>
<p>2007, reported that the Coroner’s service had not sufficiently met the needs of most </p>
<p>families.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> It identified six main issues: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the time between incident and inquest (more than three years in some cases);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insufficient notification of an inquest, leaving little opportunity to prepare;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not having access to key information;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>specific problems with the running of the inquest (including key witnesses not </p>
<p>being present, factual errors, and not having the opportunity to ask questions); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of sensitivity in the treatment of families; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cost and logistical issues (including being asked to pay for documents and the </p>
<p>difficulty faced by some families in paying for legal representation).</p>
<p><b>267. </b> The report advised that families had also raised concerns relating to their treatment </p>
<p>by the media and the Army’s investigative processes. </p>
<p><b>268. </b> On 22 January 2007, Mr David Cameron, the MP for Witney, in whose constituency </p>
<p>RAF Brize Norton was located, wrote to Lord Falconer stating that it was “patently unfair” </p>
<p>that Oxfordshire County Council should have to provide funding to clear post&#8209;June 2006 </p>
<p>inquests.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> The Council estimated that the Coroner’s office would require an additional </p>
<p>£100,000.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> On 13 February, Mr Browne replied to Ms Harman’s letter of 18 December:</p>
<p>“... I understand that your officials have confirmed with the Oxfordshire Coroner </p>
<p>that provided the body is not formally reported to him he would be content for the </p>
<p>repatriated body to be transferred directly from Brize Norton after the ceremonial  </p>
<p>to the area of the ‘home’ coroner.”</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Mr Browne commented that this was a welcome development, provided that </p>
<p>flexibility was retained; there would be occasions when the Oxfordshire Coroner, with the </p>
<p>pathology services available to him, would be able to release a body to the family more </p>
<p>quickly than a local coroner. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> On 27 March, a DCA official advised Ms Harman that the DCA’s line that </p>
<p>Oxfordshire County Council should provide funding was “becoming harder to </p>
<p>maintain”.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> It was important that Mr Walker was retained to deal with the post&#8209;June </p>
<p>2006 backlog. The DCA would look to the MOD to provide funding, but it was certain </p>
<p>to resist. </p>

<p>125</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Ms Harman informed the House of Commons on 29 March that the Government </p>
<p>had made further resources available to the Oxfordshire Coroner office’s to enable </p>
<p>Mr Walker to remain as Assistant Deputy Coroner and to enable one Coroner’s Officer  </p>
<p>to be retained, to handle the new (post&#8209;June 2006) backlog of inquests.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>273. </b> Ms Harman advised Mr Browne at the end of March that, since the Oxfordshire </p>
<p>Coroner was now routinely transferring inquests to the appropriate local coroner, there </p>
<p>had been no need to repatriate bodies directly to a local coroner without any involvement </p>
<p>by the Oxfordshire Coroner.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> Ms Harman understood that the practice of transferring </p>
<p>single death inquests would be followed by the Swindon and Wiltshire Coroner (when </p>
<p>fatalities began to be repatriated through RAF Lyneham from 1 April). </p>
<p><b>Support for the Swindon and Wiltshire Coroner</b></p>
<p><b>274. </b> From 1 April 2007, due to essential repair work at RAF Brize Norton, ceremonial </p>
<p>repatriations took place through RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> In May, the DCA took on certain responsibilities from the Home Office and was </p>
<p>renamed the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). Ms Harman retained Ministerial responsibility  </p>
<p>for coronial policy.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> Mr David Masters, the Coroner for Wiltshire &amp; Swindon, wrote to the Ministry of </p>
<p>Justice on 21 May, requesting additional resources for his office to enable it to deal with </p>
<p>the bodies of Service Personnel killed in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>277. </b> An MOJ official advised Ms Harman that she should resist providing additional </p>
<p>funding, but offer Mr Masters a meeting with MOJ and MOD officials to discuss his </p>
<p>workload and possible options. There was a risk that without additional funding </p>
<p>a backlog could develop (as it had in Oxfordshire), but there was also a case for </p>
<p>challenging the argument that Mr Masters could not cope without it. </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Ms Harman replied to Mr Masters on those lines.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Subsequently, against a background of Parliamentary concern over the possibility </p>
<p>that the backlog of inquests was increasing, she agreed with Mr Jack Straw, Secretary  </p>
<p>of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor, that he should meet Mr Masters. </p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Straw and Ms Prentice met Mr Masters on 23 July.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> Mr Masters said that </p>
<p>he had transferred 17 cases relating to single deaths to other coroners, but retained </p>

<p>that request. </p>

<p> and in October that their </p>
<p>Departments should share the cost equally.</p>
<p>179</p>

<p>contributing to delays in inquests” into the deaths of British Service Personnel in Iraq.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>285. </b> The inquest into the death of Mr Terry Lloyd, an Independent Television News  </p>

<p>was conducted by Mr Andrew Walker, the Assistant Deputy Coroner for Oxfordshire,  </p>
<p>in October 2006. Mr Walker found that Mr Lloyd had been unlawfully killed. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> In early August, as part of the preparations for that inquest, MOD and FCO officials </p>
<p>met US Embassy staff on behalf of Mr Walker, to try to secure US authority to use a US </p>

<p><b>289. </b> Ms Harman wrote to Mr Johnson again on 6 November, to advise him that </p>
<p>difficulties in securing US co&#8209;operation remained.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> It appeared that US Service </p>
<p>Personnel did not regard themselves as being required to attend inquests, despite being </p>
<p>requested to do so. Mr Walker had told her that the inquest into the death of Mr Lloyd </p>
<p>would have benefited considerably from the presence of US witnesses who could be </p>
<p>questioned by him and the next of kin. Reading out the witnesses’ statements (with the </p>
<p>names of the witnesses redacted) “was no substitute”.</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Ms Harman reassured Mr Johnson that an inquest was not a criminal trial, and </p>
<p>there was no reason for US Service Personnel not to attend. She suggested that they </p>

<p><b>291. </b> Ms Harman met Mr Johnson on 20 November.</p>

<p>a US inquest (or equivalent).</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>293. </b> The MOD advised that there was: </p>
<p>“... no formal process ... to facilitate such attendance. Attendance would have to be </p>
<p>assessed on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis and the MOD would have to carefully consider </p>
<p>the rights of the individual under different legal/constitutional systems”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>294. </b> At the meeting, Mr Johnson said that the US had provided redacted copies of US </p>
<p>reports into incidents for a number of inquests; he was disappointed that Mr Walker had </p>
<p>“rejected” that material.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> Ms Harman suggested that the key issue was the ability of </p>
<p>the coroner and families to question the material. Mr Johnson asked whether individuals </p>
<p>who had been closely involved with the investigation of an incident could attend the </p>
<p>inquest, instead of individuals who had been involved in it. Ms Harman agreed that that </p>
<p>option should be explored, but said that it was for the coroner to decide who should </p>
<p>give evidence. </p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Johnson asked if UK Service Personnel were obliged to attend US or other </p>

<p><b>302. </b> Mr Johnson advised that the US Government had concluded that it would not </p>
<p>be possible for US witnesses to an incident to participate in the inquest. It was now </p>
<p>considering whether it could provide someone who could speak authoritatively to a </p>
<p>US report. </p>
<p><b>303. </b> On 1 February 2007, Mr Walker stated that he wished to play in open court a </p>
<p>video&#8209;recording taken by one of the A&#8209;10 aircraft showing the attack on L Cpl Hull’s </p>
<p>convoy.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> That recording had been provided to the MOD by the US for use in the BOI </p>
<p>into the incident, and had subsequently been shown to the coroner by the MOD on the </p>
<p>mistaken premise that it was UK&#8209;owned material. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> The following day, the MOD sought and received an adjournment to the inquest  </p>
<p>to allow time to consult the US on disclosure of the recording. </p>
<p><b>305. </b> These events attracted a great deal of media attention, focusing on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>claims that the family of L Cpl Hull had previously been informed by the MOD </p>
<p>that no video&#8209;recording of the incident existed; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD’s decision to seek an adjournment, thus delaying the inquest; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US Government’s position that US witnesses to an incident should not </p>
<p>participate in any subsequent UK inquest. </p>
<p><b>306. </b> On 4 February,<i> The Observer</i> newspaper quoted Ms Harman’s view: </p>
<p>“My letters haven’t proved successful, phone calls haven’t proved successful, </p>
<p>requests from the coroners haven’t. It’s just not fair on the relatives to sit in on  </p>
<p>an inquest and to know that they can’t ask questions. They’re entitled to know the </p>
<p>truth from our allies.”</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>307. </b> The recording was leaked to the press on 6 February.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>308. </b> Later that day, the US told the Government that the recording could be viewed  </p>
<p>by the coroner, an MOD representative and L Cpl Hull’s family only.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>309. </b> On 19 February, prompted by concerns arising from the MOD’s support for the </p>

<p> A DCA official </p>
<p>recalled Mr Walker’s requests for an unredacted copy of the US report on the attack on </p>
<p>L Cpl Hull’s convoy and for a US representative to speak to the report. Ms Harman said:</p>
<p>“... although it is difficult for the US to do what the coroner is asking, it is worse for </p>
<p>the US not to ... providing no document and no representative at the inquest would </p>
<p>be unacceptable.”</p>

<p>discussions between the US and UK military would take place later that week. </p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Bill Jeffrey and Mr Gordon England, the US Deputy Defense Secretary, </p>
<p>discussed the issue two days later.</p>

<p> Mr England advised that, while the US aimed to be </p>
<p>as co&#8209;operative as possible:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>They could not provide an unredacted version of the US report to Mr Walker, </p>
<p>could not agree that he should contact the A&#8209;10 pilots directly, and could not </p>
<p>provide an official to answer questions on the training of A&#8209;10 pilots.</p>

<p>They could not agree to the in principle release of classified US information  </p>
<p>to coroners in future cases.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>They could not agree to provide “third&#8209;party US officials” to attend inquests.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Jeffrey asked Mr England to reconsider the provision of third&#8209;party US officials; </p>
<p>Mr England agreed that he would. </p>

<p>199</p>
<p> Legal aid could be provided in exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances by the Lord Chancellor, provided that the Legal Services Commission </p>

<p>200</p>
<p> He concluded that the participation of </p>
<p>the family of the deceased in an inquest was desirable, and that their participation was </p>
<p>assisted by “having experienced legal professionals to advise them whether there are </p>
<p>reasons for concern, and how they can be properly addressed”. He also concluded that, </p>
<p>in some circumstances, it was “invidious for the Army to be legally represented at such </p>
<p>an inquest at public expense whilst the family is not”. </p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Blake recommended:</p>
<p>“As part of the military covenant with the soldier, the MOD should ensure that the </p>
<p>family of a deceased soldier have access to legal advice and, where appropriate, </p>
<p>legal representation prior to, and during, the inquest or FAI [Fatal Accidents Inquiry].” </p>
<p><b>319. </b> The Government’s formal response to the Deepcut Review was issued in June, </p>
<p>and stated:</p>
<p>“An inquest is an inquisitorial, non&#8209;adversarial fact finding process of limited </p>
<p>scope which does not make findings of civil or criminal liability. It is the general </p>
<p>presumption that legal representation is not necessary, and it is quite appropriate </p>
<p>for those deemed interested persons by the Coroner to ask questions of witnesses </p>
<p>at an inquest without legal assistance. Government provision of legal aid ... is </p>
<p>not therefore normally available ... However, under the Access to Justice Act </p>
<p>1999 allocation may be made to the Legal Services Commission for exceptional </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>322. </b> On 13 December, during Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Roger Gale asked </p>
<p>Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“When inquests are held into the deaths of Service Personnel whose bodies are </p>
<p>returned to the UK, the Government are represented by the Treasury Solicitor, who </p>
<p>has access to effectively unlimited taxpayers’ funds for QCs, witnesses and support </p>
<p>investigations. In contrast, families of the bereaved attending the same inquest have </p>
<p>to pay out of their own pockets. Is it right that the dice should be loaded against the </p>
<p>bereaved?”</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Mr Blair replied that Ms Harman was looking at the arrangements for inquests, </p>
<p>adding that “it is of course important to make sure that bereaved families are given every </p>
<p>possible facility”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Mr Gale continued to press the Government to provide funding routinely for legal </p>
<p>representation for bereaved families at inquests into the deaths of Service Personnel.</p>
<p><b>325. </b> On 17 January 2007, a DCA official advised Ms Vera Baird, Parliamentary Under </p>
<p>Secretary of State for the DCA, that Ms Harman had received representations on the </p>
<p>issue during a consultation meeting on the draft Coroners Bill and at her 4 December </p>
<p>meeting with the families of Service Personnel who had died in Iraq.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> Ms Harman </p>
<p>was concerned that there was a “real or perceived inequality” when a public authority </p>
<p>was legally represented at an inquest but the family of the deceased was not. She </p>
<p>had therefore asked officials to explore options for providing (non&#8209;legal aid) funding for </p>
<p>families at inquests where public authorities had legal representatives. That work was </p>
<p>still at a very early stage. </p>
<p><b>326. </b> A DCA official detailed Ms Harman’s position and that work on 22 February: </p>
<p>“Harriet [Ms Harman] was clear that it is of fundamental importance that there should </p>
<p>be equality of arms between the families and MOD and something needs to be done </p>
<p>to achieve this urgently ... Her view is that if it is not possible for families to be given </p>
<p>legal support over and above the legal aid provisions then she would propose that </p>
<p>equality of arms is met by there being no MOD lawyers present at the inquests in </p>
<p>which they have an interest.”</p>
<p>207</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Work was under way to: </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>329. </b> On 9 March, a DCA official advised Ms Harman that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD had had legal representation at eight of the 45 inquests (into 63 deaths </p>
<p>in Iraq and Afghanistan) that had been completed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>at five of those eight inquests, the family had also had legal representation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>at three other inquests the family had had legal representation and the MOD </p>
<p>had not.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The official advised that the DCA had been able to confirm only two cases </p>
<p>where families had received legal aid for an inquest relating to Iraq (at a total cost of </p>
<p>some £38,000). </p>
<p><b>331. </b> The official recalled the Government’s response to the Deepcut Review and </p>
<p>commented:</p>
<p>“If the MOD maintain the line that inquests are not adversarial ... so that families  </p>
<p>do not need to be represented, this begs the question as to why MOD needs to  </p>
<p>be represented.” </p>
<p><b>332. </b> Ms Harman wrote to Mr Browne on 14 March: </p>
<p>“I am becoming increasingly concerned about the lack of legal representation for </p>

<p>“One solution to the problem might be for neither the military nor the family to </p>

<p>211</p>
<p> Ms Harman said that there were two distinct areas to consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“logistical and moral” support and advice for families; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>legal advice and representation.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr Ingram and Ms Harman both stated that their departments did not have the </p>
<p>resources to fund legal representation. They agreed that:</p>
<p>“... the increased support for families from the MOD and the increased support for </p>
<p>coroners as well as the work on greater disclosure of information would go a long </p>
<p>way to providing families with the support they want at inquests.” </p>
<p><b>336. </b> They also agreed to set out that increased support in a Written Ministerial </p>
<p>Statement. </p>
<p><b>337. </b> Mr Ingram undertook to ensure that families had an MOD representative with them </p>
<p>at the inquest “to provide explanations and support”. </p>
<p><b>338. </b> Mr Ingram made a Written Ministerial Statement on 7 June on improved support </p>
<p>to bereaved families.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> The Statement did not cover legal representation for bereaved </p>
<p>families at inquests. </p>
<p><b>339. </b> The Royal British Legion’s “Honour the Covenant” campaign, which was launched </p>
<p>in September 2007, highlighted the distress caused to families by delays to and the lack </p>
<p>of legal representation during inquests, and called for legal advice, representation and </p>
<p>advocacy to be provided to all families at public expense.</p>

<p><b>342. </b> Ms Prentice continued:</p>
<p>“I would also say that when I met representatives of the War Widows Association </p>
<p>recently, they did not feel that legal representation at inquests was necessary, if the </p>

<p><b>343. </b> On 13 March 2008, in response to a further question from Mr Gale, Ms Harman </p>
<p>(Leader of the House of Commons) said: </p>
<p>“I agree with the hon. Gentleman that if bereaved relatives with no legal </p>
<p>representation turn up on the steps of a coroner’s court and find that the Ministry </p>
<p>of Defence and the Army have a great battery of solicitors and QCs, they cannot </p>
<p>help but feel that the position is unfair. The MOD is very concerned about the issue, </p>
<p>which will be considered during debate on the Coroners Bill. We need to give </p>

<p><b>344. </b> A January 2009 briefing on the Coroners and Justice Bill advised that it would </p>
<p>contain a number of measures to ensure that any future backlogs of inquests could be </p>
<p>addressed more easily: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would create a new national head of the coronial system, the Chief Coroner, </p>
<p>who would be able to reallocate work between coroners and request the </p>
<p>Lord Chief Justice to appoint judges to act as coroners in complex cases.  </p>
<p>The wishes of the bereaved family would be taken into account in determining </p>
<p>the location of the inquest. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coroners would have new powers to obtain information to help their </p>
<p>investigations. “Rigid restrictions” on where inquests and post&#8209;mortems could be </p>
<p>held would be relaxed and the power to transfer cases to prevent delays would </p>
<p>be enhanced.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>345. </b> The Bill would also give the Lord Chancellor powers to issue statutory guidance on </p>
<p>how the coroners’ system should operate, in particular with respect to bereaved families. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>347. </b> On 21 October 2009, during a debate on the Bill in the House of Lords, </p>
<p>Lord Thomas of Gresford moved an amendment which would have the effect of bringing </p>
<p>inquests into deaths in State custody or while on active military service within the scope </p>
<p>of legal aid.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Lord Bach, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the MOJ, agreed to </p>
<p>consider that amendment, adding:</p>
<p>“Obviously I cannot give any guarantees that I will be able to bring forward a suitable </p>
<p>amendment ... but I shall certainly do my best.”</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>349. </b> An MOJ official provided advice to Lord Bach on 23 October on the form and cost </p>
<p>of such an amendment.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> The official identified a number of risks, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD was trying to reduce how often it chose to be legally represented at </p>
<p>inquests “to tackle the perception that they have the advantage over families”.  </p>
<p>If bringing military inquests into the scope of the legal aid scheme meant </p>
<p>that most families had legal representation, then the MOD would also want </p>
<p>representation. The MOD had chosen to be represented at “only” 45 percent  </p>
<p>of inquests in 2008.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bringing military inquests into the scope of the legal aid scheme meant that </p>
<p>decisions on whether to provide legal aid would be made by the Legal Services </p>
<p>Commission (LSC) without reference to Ministers. That might lead to military </p>
<p>inquests being refused legal aid, particularly where the LSC did not waive the </p>
<p>financial eligibility limits. The official recalled that all 17 of the applications for </p>
<p>exceptional funding in relation to military inquests which had so far been made </p>
<p>by the LSC had been granted by the MOJ. </p>
<p><b>350. </b> When the Bill reached its Third Reading in the House of Lords on 5 November, </p>
<p>the Government tabled an amendment which made specific provision for legal </p>
<p>representation at an inquest into the death of British Service Personnel on active service </p>
<p>to be publicly funded.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> A means test applied. </p>
<p><b>351. </b> The Bill became the Coroners and Justice Act in November 2009, with the </p>
<p>amendment included as Section 51. That Section was not brought into force </p>
<p>immediately. </p>
<p><b>352. </b> Section 51 was repealed by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of </p>
<p>Offenders Act 2012.</p>

<p>137</p>
<p>in November 2010, proposed that as inquests were non&#8209;adversarial in nature, legal aid </p>
<p>could not be justified. </p>
<p><b>353. </b> Following the 2010 UK general election, the incoming Government first announced </p>
<p>that the Office of the Chief Coroner would be abolished, because of the costs involved, </p>
<p>and then proposed to leave the Office on the statute book but to transfer some (but not </p>
<p>all) of the functions to other posts and institutions.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>354. </b> In November 2011, following criticism in Parliament and from concerned </p>
<p>organisations, the Government announced that it would establish the Office of the </p>
<p>Chief Coroner. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> The first post&#8209;holder, His Honour Judge Peter Thornton, took up the post in </p>
<p>September 2012.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Fatal Accident Inquiries in Scotland</b></p>
<p><b>356. </b> The Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1976 provided for </p>
<p>the Lord Advocate to instruct a procurator fiscal to investigate a death if it appeared to </p>
<p>the Lord Advocate that an investigation would be in the public interest. This contrasted </p>
<p>with the position in England and Wales, where coroners had a statutory duty, under the </p>
<p>1988 Coroners Act, to investigate deaths which were reported to them when the body </p>
<p>was lying in their district and there was reason to believe that the death was violent or </p>
<p>unnatural, or was a sudden death of unknown cause, or in some other circumstances.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That duty applied “whether the cause of death arose in his district or not”. </p>
<p><b>357. </b> On 2 April 2003, two weeks after the start of military operations against Iraq, a </p>
<p>Home Office official wrote to Mr Nicholas Gardiner, the Oxfordshire Coroner, proposing </p>
<p>guidelines for transferring cases to other coroners:</p>
<p>“An aspect of this we had not yet addressed is the handling of fatalities where they </p>
<p>are to be transferred to Scotland or Northern Ireland. I have had a brief word with my </p>
<p>Northern Ireland and Scottish counterparts. In neither territory would there normally </p>
<p>be inquests or other inquiries into deaths abroad. It would therefore seem inevitable </p>
<p>for you to accept jurisdiction for inquests in such cases ...”</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Gardiner agreed with that assessment.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>359. </b> There are no indications that the issue was considered again until 2006. </p>

<p>138</p>
<p><b>360. </b> The Deepcut Review into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four </p>
<p>soldiers at the Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut reported in March 2006.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> The Review </p>
<p>recommended: “There should always be an inquest, or, in Scotland, a Fatal Accidents </p>
<p>Inquiry, into a sudden death of a solider, wherever the death has occurred.”</p>
<p><b>361. </b> The Government’s formal response to the Review, which issued in June, stated that </p>
<p>discussions were continuing between the MOD and the DCA, with a view to responding </p>
<p>to the recommendation in the context of the Coroners Bill.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> Responsibility for legislation </p>
<p>on inquiries into deaths in Scotland was delegated to the Scottish administration; any </p>
<p>proposals would therefore need to be discussed with the Scottish Executive. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> On 4 December, Ms Harman met relatives of Service Personnel killed in Iraq, to </p>
<p>discuss their experience of the investigation and inquest process.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> The record of the </p>
<p>meeting reported that there was consensus that inquests should be held “more locally, </p>
<p>including in Scotland”. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Ms Harman wrote to Mr Browne later that month summarising the conclusions  </p>
<p>of the meeting, including:</p>
<p>“There is a particular issue about Scottish fatalities which are repatriated to England </p>
<p>and Wales ... unless there is an inquest in England there will be no inquiry at all </p>
<p>in Scotland. It was suggested [at the meeting] that until such time as the Scottish </p>
<p>Executive’s position changes, a coroner in the north of England might be able to </p>
<p>take on inquests for Scottish families, and my officials are looking into this possibility. </p>
<p>I am also going to discuss with the Scottish Executive the issue of extending the </p>
<p>scope of the Fatal Accident Inquiry to cover Service deaths abroad.”</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>364. </b> In April 2007, Ms Harman met Mr Ingram to discuss legal representation for </p>
<p>families at inquests.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> Mr Ingram asked whether there was scope to transfer the inquest </p>
<p>into the loss of Nimrod XV230 to Scotland. Ms Harman said that she had discussed the </p>
<p>issue with the Scottish Lord Advocate and relevant Scottish Executive Minister, who </p>
<p>had both confirmed that there was no scope in Scotland for an inquest or Fatal Accident </p>
<p>Inquiry (FAI) into the incident. </p>
<p><b>365. </b> Nimrod XV230 had crashed in Afghanistan on 2 September 2006, with the loss of </p>
<p>14 crew.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> The aircraft was based at RAF Kinloss in Scotland. </p>

<p>139</p>
<p><b>366. </b> During Defence Questions in the House of Commons on 14 May 2007, Mr Angus </p>
<p>Robertson asked:</p>
<p><b>“</b>Will the Ministry of Defence work with the incoming Scottish Executive to ensure </p>
<p>that inquiries [into the deaths of Service Personnel] can take place under Scots law? </p>
<p>After all, that would help to reduce the backlog and to ease the inconvenience to  </p>
<p>the families.”</p>
<p>235</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Ingram replied:</p>
<p>“The answer to that is yes ... My understanding is that there would need to be  </p>
<p>a change to primary legislation. We need to look into that, but if there is a will  </p>
<p>to change in Scotland, let us hear the propositions.”</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Ingram subsequently discussed with MOD officials how he could respond  </p>
<p>to Mr Robertson’s call.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>369. </b> On 2 June, Mr Ingram wrote to Mr Kenny MacAskill, Cabinet Secretary for Justice </p>
<p>at the Scottish Executive, to open a discussion on the issue: </p>
<p>“Ensuring that they [inquests] are conducted in a family&#8209;friendly manner remains </p>
<p>a priority for us and, where practical, we are allocating them to ‘home’ coroners in </p>
<p>England and Wales. We share your concern that it has not been possible to hold </p>
<p>them in Scotland. </p>
<p>“The fact that we have, so far, repatriated the bodies of Scottish Service Personnel </p>
<p>to England ensures that there can be an inquest, albeit under the Coroner’s Court </p>
<p>arrangements for England and Wales. </p>
<p>“We would favour moving towards a position where, if appropriate, Inquiries into  </p>
<p>the deaths of Service Personnel can take place in Scotland. We would be happy  </p>
<p>to work with you to achieve this. However, we believe it will require a change of law </p>
<p>in Scotland ...”</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>370. </b> Ms Prentice wrote to Mr MacAskill on 25 October, asking if there had been any </p>
<p>developments since Mr Ingram’s letter.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> In the absence of an appropriate process </p>
<p>in Scotland, the bodies of Scottish Service Personnel were repatriated to England “to </p>
<p>ensure that there can be an inquest”. This meant that families had to travel considerable </p>
<p>distances from their homes in Scotland to attend inquests.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Officials from the MOD, MOJ and Scottish Executive met on 14 December to </p>
<p>consider the possibility of transferring responsibility for inquiries into the deaths of </p>
<p>“Scottish&#8209;based” Service Personnel who were killed overseas from the coroners’ service </p>
<p>to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS),</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> “with a view to FAIs being </p>
<p>held rather than coroners’ inquests”.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> The meeting concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The way forward might be an order under Section 30 of the Scotland Act </p>
<p>1998.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> That possibility would be explored by the Scottish Government Legal </p>
<p>Directorate and the Office of the Solicitor to the Advocate General (OSAG).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There did not appear to be any “fundamental obstacles” to the proposed </p>
<p>transfer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The discretionary nature of the FAI system would need to be addressed. </p>
<p><b>372. </b> On 27 March 2008, in response to a letter from Mr MacAskill, Mr Browne wrote:</p>
<p>“Addressing these issues is ... a matter for Scottish Ministers. The answer is for </p>
<p>you to make a commitment to amend Scots law in a way that can guarantee that </p>
<p>Scottish&#8209;based Service families can be assured of mandatory inquiries into overseas </p>
<p>operational deaths. If that were to happen then it would be entirely appropriate to </p>
<p>repatriate deceased Service Personnel to Scottish bases once the law has been </p>
<p>changed. You will understand, however, that I cannot contemplate changes without </p>
<p>your commitment to mandatory investigations.”</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Browne’s letter was copied to all Members of the Scottish Parliament, in order </p>
<p>to inform the debate on the planned review of FAIs which would be held in the Scottish </p>
<p>Parliament later that day. </p>
<p><b>374. </b> The issue of enabling inquiries to be held in Scotland into the deaths of Service </p>
<p>Personnel normally domiciled in Scotland featured heavily in the debate.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Closing the debate, Mr MacAskill stated that an amendment to the Scotland Act </p>
<p>1998 would be necessary before Scotland could act:</p>
<p>“If Des Browne agrees to the making of a section 30 order, we can begin to make </p>
<p>progress; without a section 30 order, it would be ultra vires for us to proceed – the </p>
<p>Parliament simply could not take such action.”</p>

<p>Orders made under Section 30(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 allow for modifications to be made to </p>
<p>Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act, which lists those matters that are reserved to the UK Parliament, and  </p>
<p>as such defines the competence of the Scottish Parliament. The order&#8209;making power allows the Scottish </p>

<p><b>376. </b> The following day, an MOJ official advised Ms Prentice that the 14 December 2007 </p>
<p>meeting of officials, and subsequent exchanges, had identified “no simple solution”.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were plans for officials to meet again.</p>
<p><b>377. </b> On 4 November, Mr Bob Ainsworth, successor to Mr Ingram as Minister of State </p>
<p>for the Armed Forces, informed the House of Commons that: “No reply [to Mr Browne’s </p>
<p>letter of 27 March] has yet been received from the Scottish Executive.”</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>378. </b> That exchange prompted Mr Ainsworth to ask MOD officials how momentum could </p>
<p>be regained on the FAI issue.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>379. </b> An official advised Mr Ainsworth on 11 November that the Scottish Executive had </p>
<p>given “considerable thought” to how inquiries could be held in Scotland without changing </p>
<p>the devolution settlement, but Scottish Ministers did not appear to have come to a </p>
<p>conclusion. The official was not sure that work was now being actively pursued. It was </p>
<p>not satisfactory to let the issue drift. </p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Ainsworth wrote to Ms Prentice the following day, proposing that Ministers and </p>

<p>“Repatriation to UK of the dead is to take place wherever possible and as soon  </p>
<p>as practicable.”</p>

<p><b>386. </b> Before Op TELIC, repatriations were conducted with very little or no formal </p>

<p>255</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>387. </b> The MOD put in place a unique arrangement for the repatriation of Service </p>
<p>Personnel who died during Op TELIC, known as Operation KEIR. The repatriation </p>
<p>ceremony under Op KEIR was designed to “demonstrate the highest level of respect”, </p>
<p>and included attendance by members of the Royal Family (or their representatives) and </p>
<p>Ministers, military pall&#8209;bearers and a military band. </p>
<p><b>388. </b> In his autobiography, General Sir Mike Jackson described attending a repatriation </p>
<p>ceremony in his capacity as Chief of the General Staff:</p>
<p>“We gathered before the aircraft landed, and were seated on the edge of the apron </p>
<p>outside the terminal building to watch the C&#8209;17 aircraft land and taxi into position, </p>
<p>coming to a rest with the nose of the aircraft facing diagonally away from the </p>
<p>mourners. Then the ramp was lowered. A bearer party of six soldiers in parade dress </p>
<p>advanced and marched up the ramp to take the first coffin. As they came into view </p>
<p>down the ramp carrying the coffin, a band began playing and everyone stood. We all </p>
<p>saluted as the bearers marched past in slow time, carrying the coffin to the waiting </p>
<p>hearse. This simple, but profoundly moving, ceremony was repeated for each coffin </p>
<p>on board the aircraft.”</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Lt Gen Mans told the Inquiry that a repatriation ceremony could “help the bereaved </p>
<p>family to start closure on the whole process of losing a loved one”.</p>

<p>operations in Iraq, the MOD should “rationalise” the repatriation process.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> The MOD </p>
<p>would adopt three levels of repatriation:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for non&#8209;battle deaths, where repatriation would mirror the pre&#8209;Op TELIC model;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for Service Personnel killed in action or who had died of their wounds, where </p>
<p>repatriation would include a “degree of ceremony” including military pall&#8209;bearers; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for exceptional circumstances where it was appropriate to demonstrate the </p>
<p>highest level of respect, where Op KEIR would be used. It would be for Mr Hoon </p>
<p>to determine whether to invoke Op KEIR, taking into account factors including </p>
<p>the circumstances surrounding the incident. </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that the issue of who should attend a repatriation </p>
<p>ceremony quickly became “a big issue”:</p>
<p>“Everybody wanted to be there, to show support.</p>
<p>“I think what we realised early on was that this was going to be ongoing. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, casualties were going to keep coming. We could not have everybody </p>
<p>rushing to [RAF] Brize Norton, as it was then, [RAF] Lyneham, as it is now, every </p>
<p>time there was a casualty. So we developed, I think, an extremely good policy, which </p>
<p>I think has worked very well, about how repatriations are done.”</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>392. </b> Lt Gen Palmer added that, in planning and conducting repatriation ceremonies:</p>
<p>“... with Ministers and everybody in the MOD the absolute key thing was to try to be </p>
<p>as responsive and sensitive to the families as we possibly could at this enormously </p>
<p>difficult moment for them.”</p>
<p><b>393. </b> In September 2007, a fourth level of repatriation was added, covering repatriations </p>
<p>in the event of a mass fatality incident (defined as between 15 and 35 fatalities).</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>394. </b> In April 2009, the MOD amended its policy so that all deaths on operations </p>
<p>(including non&#8209;battle deaths) received a formal repatriation ceremony, in the light of the </p>
<p>difficulty in drawing a distinction between an individual killed by direct enemy fire and </p>
<p>one killed in an accident in direct support of operations, and given public and familial </p>
<p>expectations that individuals who died on operations should be honoured.</p>

<p>ROYAL WOOTTON BASSETT</p>
<p><b>395. </b> From April 2007, due to essential repair work at RAF Brize Norton, ceremonial </p>
<p>repatriations took place through RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire. </p>
<p><b>396. </b> Corteges departing RAF Lyneham passed through Wootton Bassett. The Royal </p>
<p>British Legion reported in June 2011 how the town had responded:</p>
<p>“The first [repatriation] was acknowledged by a few members of the public which </p>
<p>included members of the Royal British Legion ... </p>
<p>“Over the past four years the number of people has increased and where we were </p>
<p>once paying tribute on a more personal basis we have now come to represent the </p>
<p>country. </p>
<p>“The repatriation tributes were never and are still not organised – things just happen, </p>
<p>such as the Church Bell which started when a bell&#8209;ringing practise was taking place </p>
<p>just before the repatriation was due, and as a mark of respect the one bell was tolled </p>
<p>on that occasion.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“When the cortege is about to leave Lyneham, the police alert us here in Wootton </p>
<p>Bassett. The Standard Bearers form an orderly line, spacing themselves at equal </p>
<p>distances down the opposite side of the road to the War memorial ... When the </p>
<p>cortege reaches the edge of town the bell&#8209;ringer is notified and the Church Bell </p>
<p>starts to toll and the town falls silent. Shopkeepers close their premises and join  </p>
<p>the crowds and there is not a sound to be heard.”</p>

<p>145</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Ms Elizabeth McLoughlin, the Director General of Service Personnel Policy, </p>
<p>responded in September, having consulted the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> Existing practice was </p>
<p>that, apart from letters written by those serving with the individual who had been killed,  </p>
<p>a senior officer would write one letter of condolence “on behalf of both the Sovereign </p>
<p>and the Service”. While the Services appreciated the wish to provide additional comfort </p>
<p>to the families of personnel killed on operations, they were concerned that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be very difficult for any letter, unless written locally by the unit </p>
<p>commander, to be other than “bland and impersonal”. Experience had </p>
<p>shown that it was not helpful for families to receive a large number of official </p>
<p>condolence letters based on generic information. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Services (and the Chief of Defence Staff in particular) did not want to </p>
<p>distinguish, for this purpose, between individuals killed on operations and </p>
<p>those who died “as a result of the normal rigours of Service life”. They did not </p>
<p>believe that the circumstances of a death made the next of kin any more or less </p>
<p>deserving of sympathy. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was also a question of whether the next of kin of Reservists and MOD </p>
<p>civilians should be included. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of mass casualties, writing to the next of kin might be difficult.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Ms McLoughlin concluded that the existing practice should continue, although </p>
<p>the Prime Minister or the Secretary of State might in addition send a personal note in </p>
<p>“exceptional cases where it is felt that families would benefit”. That would need to be </p>
<p>assessed on a case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis. </p>
<p><b>402. </b> In late March 2003, No.10 asked the MOD for advice on how Mr Blair should </p>
<p>honour UK Service Personnel killed on Op TELIC, and especially whether he should </p>
<p>write letters of condolence to the families of Service Personnel killed on operations </p>
<p>and whether there should be a ceremony or function to commemorate deceased </p>
<p>Service Personnel.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office responded to Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary on </p>
<p>27 March, advising that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the current policy (whereby a senior officer wrote a single letter of condolence) </p>
<p>remained sound; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it would be appropriate for a ceremony to be held after the conflict had </p>
<p>concluded.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>404. </b> On 7 April, Mr Blair wrote to a bereaved spouse who had lost her husband </p>
<p>on Op TELIC, to respond to her concerns about the way she was being treated by </p>
<p>the MOD.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>405. </b> On 9 May, in response to a further request for advice from No.10 on whether </p>
<p>Mr Blair should write letters of condolence to the families of Service Personnel killed </p>
<p>on operations, Mr Hoon’s Private Office repeated the advice that the current policy </p>
<p>(whereby a senior officer wrote a single letter of condolence) remained sound.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s Private Office added that the MOD was reviewing its policy on writing letters </p>
<p>of condolence “in the light of the specific circumstances of the operation in Iraq”, but was </p>
<p>unlikely to change it. </p>
<p><b>406. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office advised No.10 on 16 May that the review had concluded </p>
<p>that the MOD’s policy should not change: </p>
<p>“... you [No.10] asked if our experience during operations in Iraq had caused </p>
<p>us to alter our position ... It has not ... The Prime Minister wrote in exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances and in response to correspondence.”</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>407. </b> The MOD looked again at the policy at the end of June, following a meeting </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, during </p>
<p>which Mr Blair expressed a personal desire to write.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised Mr Hoon on 30 June that, while the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>considered that the policy remained sound, given Mr Blair’s desire to write and the fact </p>
<p>that he was already corresponding with some families, their preferred option was that </p>
<p>Mr Blair should write only to the next of kin of “those who die on Op TELIC”.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to No.10 later that day, to confirm that it “could be </p>
<p>appropriate” for Mr Blair to write to the next of kin of those killed on Op TELIC (including </p>
<p>civilians and those killed in circumstances other than in direct action with the enemy).</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>410. </b> On 1 August, Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, </p>
<p>advised Mr Blair that the MOD had, again, reviewed its policy and that Mr Hoon would </p>
<p>now write to the next of kin of individuals who had died “while in an operational area”.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft recommended that Mr Blair should now write only to the next of kin of </p>
<p>individuals who had been killed in action. </p>

<p><b>Commemoration in Parliament</b></p>
<p><b>412. </b> It has become established practice for the Prime Minister and Leader of the </p>

<p>Questions (PMQs). The Inquiry has considered the origins and evolution of this public </p>
<p>commemoration. </p>
<p><b>413. </b> The first time a Prime Minister offered condolences for the deaths of Service </p>
<p>Personnel in Iraq at PMQs was 2 April 2003. On that day, Mr Blair said he was “sure that </p>
<p>the whole House will want to pass on its sympathies to the families of British Servicemen </p>
<p>who have tragically been killed in the service of their country in the past week. Again, we </p>
<p>pay tribute to their courage and dignity and we pass on our condolences and sympathy </p>
<p>to their families and their friends.”</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>414. </b> The practice was repeated a week later, when Mr Blair offered condolences to the </p>
<p>families of all those who had lost their lives in the intervening seven days.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>415. </b> On 25 June, he paid tribute to (but did not name) the Royal Military Police (RMP) </p>
<p>officers who had lost their lives and been injured at Majarr al Kabir the previous day.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>416. </b> On 10 September, as Parliament returned from the summer recess, Mr Blair paid </p>
<p>tribute to the British Servicemen who had lost their lives during the recess.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>417. </b> On 5 November, Mr Blair paid tribute to Corporal Ian Plank of the Royal Marines </p>
<p>who had lost his life the previous week.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> That was the first time a Service person </p>
<p>had been mentioned by name. It is not clear why the decision was taken to name </p>
<p>Corporal Plank. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> Over the next two years, Mr Blair regularly paid tribute at the beginning of PMQs  </p>
<p>to British Servicemen who had lost their lives, but only from April 2006 did the practice  </p>
<p>of naming individuals and their regiments become usual. </p>
<p><b>419. </b> In June 2007, during his last PMQs, Mr Blair described those tributes as “the </p>
<p>saddest of duties”.</p>

<p> The MOD intended that the </p>

<p><b>Armed Forces Memorial</b></p>
<p><b>427. </b> Mr Hoon advised the House of Commons in November 2000:</p>
<p>“I have given careful consideration to a number of ways in which the recognition </p>
<p>of members of the Armed Forces who give their lives in the service of their </p>
<p>country might be enhanced. In the light of discussion, I have concluded that the </p>
<p>most appropriate would be the erection in central London of a memorial bearing </p>
<p>the names of all those killed on duty and by terrorist attack since the end of </p>
<p>the Second World War. In accordance with the long established custom for the </p>
<p>erection of memorials, I would expect funds to be raised by public subscription. </p>
<p>Further consultation will now take place with ex&#8209;Service organisations and other </p>
<p>interested bodies.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Hoon advised the House of Commons in March 2002 that, following that </p>
<p>consultation and research into suitable sites, the Armed Forces Memorial (AFM) would </p>
<p>be sited at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>429. </b> On 30 June 2006, following an assessment by officials that there was a significant </p>
<p>risk that fundraising for the Memorial would not reach the total required, Mr Des Browne, </p>
<p>the Defence Secretary, directed Mr Jeffrey that the MOD should underwrite the Memorial </p>
<p>project “in the sum of £3.3m which represents the balance the AFM Trustees require to </p>
<p>fully fund the project”.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>430. </b> In October 2007, the Armed Forces Memorial was formally dedicated in </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>431. </b> Ministers were advised in early 2008 that the total cost of the Memorial was </p>
<p>expected to be £7.3m.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> The AFM Trustees had raised £6.7m, including £1.5m from </p>
<p>the sale of Trafalgar Coins (announced by Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the </p>
<p>Exchequer, in February 2006), £2.417m from the Millennium Commission (agreed in </p>
<p>November 2006), with the balance from public subscriptions. There was no realistic </p>
<p>prospect of significant further public contributions. Trustees had therefore asked the </p>
<p>MOD to provide £500,000 to complete the project.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>432. </b> AM Pocock told the Inquiry that the process of securing funding for the Memorial </p>
<p>illustrated the difficulty of translating intent into action: </p>
<p>“Although the political intent was perfectly clear, we were also told there was going </p>
<p>to be no public money for it. We were hoping to get some money from the Lottery. </p>
<p>We did eventually, after some strong support from newspapers caused the Lottery  </p>
<p>to change the rules. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>“We had the designs, it was in The Queen’s diary to come and open it. We actually </p>
<p>had to let the contract but we didn’t have the money, and it wasn’t from lack of effort </p>

<p>but the money just wasn’t forthcoming.</p>
<p>“The difficulty we had in getting the guarantee from the department [the MOD] was </p>
<p>immense. We eventually did. We were able to build it.”</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>433. </b> Both AM Pocock and VAdm Wilkinson felt that the Memorial provided a strong </p>
<p>focus for remembrance. VAdm Wilkinson told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“The focus for recognition and remembrance that it [the Memorial] has provided and </p>
<p>the source of comfort to a number of bereaved families, it really is quite remarkable, </p>
<p>perhaps, that, as a nation, we didn’t have one before 2007.”</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>434. </b> The Memorial also provides a home for the Basra Memorial Wall. The wall was </p>
<p>originally built in 2006 outside the headquarters of Multi&#8209;National Division (South East) in </p>
<p>Basra by members of 37 Armoured Engineer Squadron to commemorate those who died </p>
<p>in or as a result of action in Iraq.</p>

<p>when UK forces left Basra.</p>

<p><b>The Elizabeth Cross</b></p>
<p><b>437. </b> On 10 June 2008, Mr Browne announced the inauguration of a new award.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>438. </b> The award itself had been proposed by the Chiefs of Staff, who concluded that the </p>
<p>time was right to recognise the “families of those personnel who die on operations, or as </p>
<p>a result of terrorist action whilst on duty”. Mr Browne confirmed that the recommendation </p>
<p>had been welcomed by Ministers and approved by Her Majesty The Queen. Paying </p>
<p>tribute to the bravery and courage shown by the families of all serving personnel, he </p>
<p>hoped that the new award would “provide a more visible form of recognition from the </p>
<p>nation for those who pay the ultimate sacrifice in the name of their country”. </p>
<p><b>439. </b> VAdm Wilkinson told the Inquiry that there was “unanimity” among the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff “that it was appropriate to recognise the sacrifice that bereaved families had </p>
<p>made”.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> The proposal reflected consultation with serving personnel and with bereaved </p>
<p>families, as well as consideration of what other nations do to recognise the sacrifice that </p>
<p>Service families make.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Ainsworth, Mr Browne’s successor as Defence Secretary, set out further  </p>
<p>detail about the award and the circumstances in which it would be given in July 2009.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He confirmed that The Queen had agreed that the award should be known as the </p>
<p>Elizabeth Cross, the first new honour to take the name of a serving monarch since the </p>
<p>creation of the George Cross in 1940.</p>
<p><b>441. </b> It would commemorate the lives of those who had died on operations or as a result </p>
<p>of terrorism from 1948 onwards (or from 1945 in the case of service in Palestine), in </p>
<p>order to fit with the end of the period in which deaths are officially attributed to service </p>
<p>in World War II. He reminded Parliament that “this is not a posthumous medal for the </p>
<p>fallen but national recognition for the family for their loss”. The award would consist of </p>
<p>the Elizabeth Cross itself – awarded to the named next of kin – and a Memorial Scroll, </p>
<p>copies of which could be presented to certain additional members of the deceased’s </p>
<p>close family. Both the Cross and the Scroll would be awarded on application, as contact </p>
<p>details for the several thousand eligible families were unlikely to be up to date. </p>
<p><b>442. </b> The first presentation of the Elizabeth Cross, made by The Queen, took place </p>
<p>in Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, on 12 September 2009.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> Those receiving the </p>
<p>awards included five families of soldiers killed in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>443. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions and lessons on the preparations made for repatriating </p>
<p>the bodies of those who lost their lives serving on Operation TELIC, how their deaths </p>
<p>were investigated, and the support provided for bereaved families are set out in </p>
<p>Section 16.4.</p>
