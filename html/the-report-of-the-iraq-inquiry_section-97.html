<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the conclusion of negotiations on the status of UK forces in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decisions on the drawdown and withdrawal of UK troops;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s objectives for its ongoing relationship with Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assessments of the UK’s legacy, particularly in Basra and the South. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and reform of its security sector, </p>
<p>which are covered in Sections 10 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>May 2008</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> On 1 May, at the request of the MOD, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) </p>
<p>assessed the strength of those groups and networks which had historically posed an </p>
<p>immediate threat to Iraq’s stability, and the extent to which the Iraqi Special Forces were </p>
<p>ready to tackle those threats.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5. </b> The JIC judged that nationalist Sunni insurgents no longer represented an immediate </p>
<p>threat to Iraq’s overall stability. Sectarian violence had subsided and, since the middle </p>
<p>of 2007, many Sunni insurgents had refrained from attacking the Iraqi Security Forces </p>
<p>(ISF) and the Multi-National Force (MNF) in favour of working with them to resist </p>
<p>Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I). </p>
<p><b>6. </b> The JIC assessed that 70,000 Sunnis had joined MNF-sponsored security forces, </p>
<p>known as “Sons of Iraq”. The JIC judged that their motivation for doing so was “partly </p>
<p>financial and partly born of a growing sense that AQ-I represents their most immediate </p>
<p>threat – plus recognition that MNF cannot be defeated and will eventually leave Iraq </p>
<p>anyway”.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“Iranian-backed Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) Special Groups are likely to remain an </p>
<p>immediate threat to the MNF. They are increasingly fragmented and are unlikely to </p>
<p>have a strategic impact on stability in Iraq without the support of mainstream JAM. </p>
<p>Unless faced with a common threat from ISF, the GoI or MNF, as recently in Basra </p>
<p>and Baghdad, such support is unlikely.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>8. </b> In relation to AQ-I, the JIC assessed that it was failing to maintain its strategic impact </p>
<p>and no longer represented the most immediate threat to Iraq’s security, although it was </p>
<p>“unlikely to be eradicated” and could re-generate without sustained military pressure. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The JIC assessed that the international threat from Iraqi Shia militias was </p>
<p>“negligible”. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> In terms of tackling the threat, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“ISF as a whole are in a much better position than a year ago. But their ability to </p>
<p>defeat AQ-I and JAM Special Groups will depend heavily on their Special Forces, </p>
<p>which will rely on MNF support for aviation, airborne surveillance and operational </p>
<p>planning for some years.”</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Recent operations in Basra led the JIC to conclude that “significant problems” </p>
<p>remained in the ISF’s ability to tackle determined opposition alone:</p>
<p>“We assess their ability to successfully manage security outside Baghdad by the end </p>
<p>of 2008, without MNF ground support will continue to be patchy and depend heavily </p>
<p>on progress being made on national reconciliation and the maintenance of MNF-led </p>
<p>security gains.”</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Brown, Mr David Miliband (the Foreign Secretary), Mr Douglas Alexander </p>
<p>(the International Development Secretary) and Mr Des Browne (the Defence Secretary), </p>
<p>plus Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup (the Chief of the Defence Staff), Mr Christopher </p>
<p>Prentice (British Ambassador to Iraq), Mr Simon McDonald (Mr Brown’s Foreign Policy </p>
<p>Adviser) and Mr Matt Cavanagh (Mr Brown’s Special Adviser) met General David </p>
<p>Petraeus (Commanding General Multi-National Force – Iraq) and Ambassador Ryan </p>
<p>Crocker (US Ambassador to Iraq) on 1 May.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>13. </b> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs reported that Gen Petraeus had </p>
<p>emphasised the political dynamic in Iraq as increasingly more important than the military. </p>
<p>Mr Miliband explained that the challenge for the UK was to make the transition from </p>
<p>a military strategy in the South to a political strategy for the whole of Iraq. In his view, </p>
<p>provincial elections were the next key step. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> The discussion moved to the Charge of the Knights (see Section 9.6), during which </p>
<p>“swift US/UK action” had ensured the right outcomes, leaving JAM and other local militia </p>
<p>on the back foot. Gen Petraeus considered that the next priority was support for Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki’s plan for Sadr City. ACM Stirrup described key planned UK actions in </p>
<p>Basra and Gen Petraeus agreed that a clear division of labour existed. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Alexander reported that the recent investment event in Basra (see Section 10.2) </p>
<p>had been a success. Ambassador Crocker commented that there needed to be greater </p>
<p>synergy between the Iraqi reconstruction fund and the Basra Development Commission. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>384</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Brown said that the central UK focus would be </p>
<p>accelerated training of the 14th Division, preparations for provincial elections, progress </p>
<p>on handing control of Basra Airport to Iraqi control and economic reconstruction. </p>
<p>Decisions on troop numbers would be taken in the context of completion of these tasks.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr McDonald produced a note on troop levels in Iraq for Mr Brown on 2 May.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He advised that the UK would need to retain around 4,100 troops in southern Iraq for the </p>
<p>next six months to complete the key tasks it had agreed. Since these were higher force </p>
<p>levels than originally planned, the job of training the 14th Division should be completed </p>
<p>a few months sooner than planned, in January 2009. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr McDonald wrote:</p>
<p>“We’ll need to think about how we assess 14 Div’s readiness; we do not want </p>
<p>to leave this solely to the US; they may be tempted to use that responsibility to </p>
<p>delay us.”</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Mr McDonald advised that it should be possible to begin drawing down forces from </p>
<p>January 2009 onwards. The MOD had identified 3,500 as the critical mass of troops, </p>
<p>below which they could not provide force protection for themselves. The MOD did not </p>
<p>favour handing over tasks piecemeal to the US before achieving key objectives, both </p>
<p>because “this would look like the UK admitting it couldn’t get the key tasks done” and </p>
<p>because the US had indicated that it would not have the capacity to take on additional </p>
<p>tasks before the end of the year. Consequently:</p>
<p>“We should therefore aim for a rapid drawdown of combat forces in southern Iraq </p>
<p>from 4,100 to a much smaller niche contribution over the first six months of 2009.”</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr McDonald recommended a further statement to Parliament on force levels in </p>
<p>Iraq before the summer Recess, without going into specific timescales or numbers. </p>
<p>In the meantime, he would discuss the proposals with Mr Stephen Hadley, US National </p>
<p>Security Advisor, as part of the process of “sensitising” the US to the UK’s plans.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> In an email covering Mr McDonald’s advice, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary explained </p>
<p>that Mr Cavanagh was “also doing some work to see whether the numbers can be </p>
<p>pushed any further”.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Lieutenant General John Cooper, Senior British Military Representative – Iraq </p>
<p>(SBMR-I), reported on 5 May that Gen Petraeus had returned to Iraq “content in that </p>
<p>he has no difficulty with the UK national position and appreciates the reasons behind </p>
<p>it”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> He would look to the UK to “deliver on its commitment on MiTTing 14 IA Div [see </p>
<p>Section 12.1], the BOC [Basra Operational Command] and on the economic line”. </p>
<p>To achieve the last of these, Lt Gen Cooper suggested that the time had come for a </p>
<p>“properly staffed Basra Office in Baghdad”. </p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>385</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Lt Gen Cooper also reported that Prime Minister Maliki had told Gen Petraeus and </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker that “he had to remove JAM/SG [Special Groups] from Sadr City </p>
<p>now”. Lt Gen Cooper considered that the Charge of the Knights had created an inflated </p>
<p>view of the effectiveness of the ISF and that consequently Prime Minister Maliki “may yet </p>
<p>ignore further advice that mounting a major operation in Sadr City is not a good idea at </p>
<p>this time”.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> On 6 May, the British Embassy Office Basra reported that Charge of the Knights </p>
<p>Phase VI had been completed, and Charge of the Knights VII had begun, focused on </p>
<p>three districts of Basra, one of which had been a launch area for indirect fire.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> The British </p>
<p>Embassy Office commented:</p>
<p>“The GoI continues to extend its writ over Basra, and there is a sense of nervous </p>
<p>optimism in the city. But the Basrawis will have high expectations of immediate </p>
<p>improvements in their daily lives to follow on from the improved security </p>
<p>environment. The risk otherwise is that sections of the population will return to </p>
<p>support for the militia. Former militia stronghold areas … are faced with particular </p>
<p>problems, like poor sanitation, resulting from years of little or no investment. </p>
<p>The next few months will be critical in delivering this change – but it is hard to see </p>
<p>how the Provincial Council will be able to respond adequately to the city’s needs.”</p>
<p><b>25. </b> On 7 May, the British Embassy Office Basra reported taking part in the opening </p>
<p>ceremony of the Jameat market in Basra, built on the site of the Serious Crime Unit HQ </p>
<p>destroyed on Christmas Day 2006 (see Section 9.5).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>26. </b> The British Embassy Office wrote:</p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>this (so far as collective memory serves) is the first time in over a year that a </p>
<p>UK diplomat has gone into the city;</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>nobody can remember when we last visited the Jameat, hitherto a JAM </p>
<p>stronghold; </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>this is the first visible UK/Iraqi project to be opened in the city since at least last </p>
<p>summer.”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> After Gen Petraeus’ return to Iraq, Major General Barney White-Spunner, General </p>
<p>Officer Commanding Multi-National Division South-East (GOC MND(SE)), briefed </p>
<p>Lieutenant General Lloyd Austin, Commanding General Multi-National Corps – Iraq </p>
<p>(MNC-I), on how MND(SE) intended to deliver the required tasks.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> He reported “genuine </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>386</p>
<p>US commitment” to help with police reform and training, but the issue of who manned </p>
<p>the border with Iran remained a difficult one:</p>
<p>“Our appreciation of the border is that we need to have a permanent presence on </p>
<p>the main crossings, as unless these are controlled they will still offer the easiest </p>
<p>passage for lethal aid … that means we should man Shalamcheh and Sheeb, </p>
<p>which we do not have enough people for.”</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner anticipated that Lt Gen Austin would accept that the </p>
<p>UK could not be responsible for Maysan and that the US would provide the guard </p>
<p>force at Sheeb. In return, they would look to the UK to provide a temporary cover </p>
<p>at Shalamcheh, at least until the US construction work to create a more permanent </p>
<p>base there was complete. Maj Gen White-Spunner commented: </p>
<p>“This will be painful, but I am inclined to agree to it as otherwise we will face an open </p>
<p>border which is not in our interests, as it will allow an ingress of rockets from Iran </p>
<p>which could negate much of what has been achieved in Basra and end up being </p>
<p>fired at us here in the COB [Contingency Operating Base]. It is also very much in </p>
<p>our interest to have responsibility for the Maysan border removed from us, as it is </p>
<p>potentially much the most difficult to police.”</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner’s report also described “the end of large scale manoeuvre </p>
<p>operations by ISF to clear Basra of militia”. Phase VII of Charge of the Knights met </p>
<p>“limited resistance and low cache finds”, suggesting that the militias had fled. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Planning was also under way to “clear and search” the town of Al Qurnah, </p>
<p>70km north of Basra, to which many of the Basra JAM leaders were believed to </p>
<p>have fled.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> On 12 May, Lt Gen Cooper reported that in relation to Sadr City, Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki “was dissuaded by Petraeus and Crocker from launching a premature major </p>
<p>ground offensive”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> Following negotiations between the Iraqi authorities and the Office </p>
<p>of the Martyr Sadr (OMS), a peace deal was announced on 10 May, to come into effect </p>
<p>the following day. The terms of the deal included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the right of the ISF to enter Sadr City (without coalition MiTTs in support);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM producing maps and locations of Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the right of the Iraqi Government to conduct raids and arrests under warrant </p>
<p>in pursuit of weapons; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a cessation of IDF attacks on the International Zone; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>easier access into the area for emergency aid; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an acknowledgement that only the Iraqi Government and its security forces </p>
<p>had the right to bear arms. </p>

<p>Minute Cooper to CDS, 12 May 2008, ‘SBMR-I’s Weekly Report (300) 12 May 08’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported that it was not clear to what extent the Special Groups had </p>
<p>bought into the deal.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> On 12 May, Mr Browne wrote to Mr Brown to report his visit to Basra the previous </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> He agreed with the assessment in Mr Miliband’s letter of 29 April (see Section 9.6) </p>
<p>that the Charge of the Knights had “created the platform for transition we were hoping </p>
<p>for from General Mohan’s operations later in the year”. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> To capitalise on the opportunity presented, Mr Browne considered that the UK must:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>help ensure that the “still fragile” security on the ground in Basra continued </p>
<p>to improve; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>finalise agreement with the US over the division of military effort in MND(SE) </p>
<p>over the next six months; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“agree a narrative of what happened and why, and get it into circulation quickly – </p>
<p>not only here but in the US, where our reputation is undoubtedly tarnished”. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> The medium term was “more complicated”. Military advice was that it would </p>
<p>be difficult to fulfil the commitments agreed with the US – in particular mentoring </p>
<p>14 Division – while also making significant force level reductions before November. </p>
<p>While Mr Browne agreed with Mr Miliband that the UK should aim to transfer the two-star </p>
<p>command sooner rather than later:</p>
<p>“Our discussions so far with General Petraeus will have engendered a US </p>
<p>assumption that we have agreed to retain command of MND(SE) at least for the </p>
<p>next six months.”</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Mr Browne continued:</p>
<p>“The key question implied by David [Miliband] is whether we intend to leave Basra </p>
<p>this year, by mid 2009 or by the end of next year. We have prepared Washington </p>
<p>for a significant further troop reduction after their elections but not, explicitly, for </p>
<p>withdrawal … we have the opportunity to be out by May 2009 … if we are prepared </p>
<p>to inform the President elect of our decision in November. Alternatively, we could </p>
<p>negotiate an exit with the new Administration and … be out at the end of 2009. Both </p>
<p>risk compromising our relations with the incoming President but the former runs less </p>
<p>chance of our being entangled in longer term commitments …”</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Mr Browne’s letter concluded by mentioning the need to resolve the future legal </p>
<p>status of UK forces in Iraq after resolution 1790 (2007) expired, something about which </p>
<p>he “remained concerned”. This had a direct bearing on the question of troop numbers </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>and role. In his view, it would be sensible for Ministers to confirm now that transition </p>
<p>in 2008 was not an option: </p>
<p>“To do so would simplify military planning, allow us to concentrate on meeting our </p>
<p>objectives in Basra, ease our relations with the US and remove the risk of being </p>
<p>accused of misleading domestic audiences without prejudging when and how we </p>
<p>make the transition in 2009.” </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Browne recommended that the Committee on National Security, International </p>
<p>Relations and Defence (NSID) should commission the Iraq Strategy Group to produce </p>
<p>a refined set of options for consideration the following month, together with a draft </p>
<p>Parliamentary statement announcing the strategy to November and giving an indication </p>
<p>of future possibilities.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> In an Assessment dated 14 May, at the request of the FCO the JIC examined </p>
<p>the impact of ISF operations against the JAM in Basra on Prime Minister Maliki, his </p>
<p>government and the Sadrists.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. Prime Minister Maliki is enjoying broad political support following the success </p>
<p>of Iraqi security forces’ (ISF) operations against the Jaysh al-Mahdi in Basra (the </p>
<p>Charge of the Knights). Enthusiasm for dialogue on vital legislative issues has </p>
<p>increased.</p>
<p>“II. Maliki … still has many critics …</p>
<p>“III. The Charge has significantly weakened JAM in Basra. Its disparate factions </p>
<p>are unlikely to recover their dominance of Basra’s streets any time soon …</p>
<p>“IV. … Expectations in Basra are high. Maliki will need to deliver improvements in </p>
<p>public services and job creation in weeks … The same will apply in other places </p>
<p>where the ISF take on JAM.”</p>
<p><b>40. </b> In relation to the operation itself, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“Strong JAM resistance in the initial phases of the Charge exposed enduring </p>
<p>weaknesses in the largely untested local ISF, though co-ordination improved as the </p>
<p>operation progressed and more experienced Iraqi units from elsewhere performed </p>
<p>significantly better. Targeted and sophisticated Multi-National Forces air support </p>
<p>and assistance in command and control was also key to the eventual success of </p>
<p>the Charge …”</p>
<p><b>41. </b> On 16 May, Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that the Deputy Commanding </p>
<p>General of MNC-I, who had deployed to Basra during the Charge of the Knights, had left </p>
<p>MND(SE), leaving behind a “strong detachment” of US forces.</p>

<p>commented that his presence in the South had been valuable, and that MND(SE) was </p>
<p>already seeing the benefit of him being back in Corps headquarters, where he was </p>
<p>helpfully ensuring that the MND(SE) perspective was better understood. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> Having a substantial US presence in MND(SE) had helped UK forces to understand </p>
<p>how to work with the US Corps system, but Maj Gen White-Spunner thought that </p>
<p>MND(SE) was still not articulating its requirements as fluently as other divisions, and </p>
<p>still failed to feature in many of the Corps daily statistics, which had a direct bearing on </p>
<p>the allocation of resources. He commented: “We are all learning enthusiastically how </p>
<p>to speak American, although the military dialect does take time to master.”</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that the operation to clear Al Qurnah had begun, </p>
<p>but that many of the Special Groups they had hoped to detain had moved on. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> A scene-setting telegram from the British Embassy Office Basra on 18 May, prior </p>
<p>to a visit by Mr Browne, assessed the city’s prospects as “on a knife-edge” and judged:</p>
<p>“The Charge of the Knights has to be consolidated. That will require an energised </p>
<p>civil society, with effective local government structures. It will need to be Iraqi-led … </p>
<p>If momentum can be maintained, and the militias kept out, Basra might just make it.”</p>

<p><b>45. </b> On 19 May, Lt Gen Cooper reported that the cease-fire agreed on 10 May appeared </p>
<p>to be generally holding; it was not clear what the long-term impact would be on the </p>
<p>Sadrist movement.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The militias were in difficulty in Sadr City in Basra and had </p>
<p>diminished in Maysan and the other southern Provinces. But the cease-fire was seen </p>
<p>as being on the Government’s terms, and there was widespread criticism of Muqtada </p>
<p>al-Sadr’s leadership. Lt Gen Cooper speculated that the Iraqi Government was in </p>
<p>dialogue with representatives of the Special Groups (“the lack of IDF in recent days is </p>
<p>an indicator of this”).</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Lt Gen Cooper observed that as Prime Minister Maliki’s confidence and control </p>
<p>grew, so the influence of the coalition waned. He added:</p>
<p>“How we use our remaining capital will be more and more important as the </p>
<p>coalition’s room for manoeuvre is increasingly constrained, and Maliki continues </p>
<p>to build a position very like that of the traditional Iraqi strong-man.”</p>
<p><b>47. </b> On 22 May, Iraqi Security Forces entered Sadr City at first light and met almost no </p>

<p><b>48. </b> Lt Gen Cooper commented that the key question was “what, or where, next?”. </p>
<p>Both the MNF and Iraqi Government were turning their attention to Maysan, in an </p>
<p>attempt to disrupt Iranian operations and address militia infiltration of the police.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On 23 May, Mr McDonald wrote a report for Mr Brown of his meeting with Mr Hadley </p>
<p>and his team in Washington two days previously to discuss troop levels.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> Mr McDonald </p>
<p>described the meeting as “hard pounding” and reported that the US had been concerned </p>
<p>about how UK troop reductions would be described and about reports that the UK was </p>
<p>planning to reduce rapidly to 1,000 or fewer. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> Mr McDonald explained UK military advice that “there was no sustainable </p>
<p>combat deployment between 3,350 and zero”, which Mr Hadley suggested should be </p>
<p>re-examined in light of the improved security situation in Basra, and that key tasks would </p>
<p>be complete by year end. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Mr McDonald said that: “The British Parliament and public were expecting British </p>
<p>troop numbers to fall to 2,500 this year.” He asked whether US forces would be able </p>
<p>to take on any tasks that would allow UK numbers to fall to that level. General Doug </p>
<p>Lute (“the US War Czar”) said that the US would look at that. They agreed to continue </p>
<p>discussions in advance of President Bush’s visit to the UK from 15 to 16 June.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Mr Brown and President Bush discussed Iraq briefly by video conference on </p>
<p>30 May.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> Mr Brown reported that Mr Browne had returned from his recent visit to Basra </p>
<p>feeling more optimistic and said that the UK must focus more clearly on its tasks for the </p>
<p>remainder of 2008. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mr Brown also confirmed that his “rough objective” was to draw down to 2,500 UK </p>
<p>troops by the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> In his weekly report on 30 May, Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that the people </p>
<p>of Basra “remain firmly behind” the ISF and Iraqi Government, as their quality of life </p>
<p>had significantly improved following the end of militia dominance.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> MND(SE)’s weekly </p>
<p>security assessment of the city showed that all but one of the districts was stable or </p>
<p>improving. Basra’s night-life was returning, illustrated by restaurants opening again at </p>
<p>night, the return of music to the streets and even the selling of alcohol. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Food and fuel prices, which had increased sharply during the early stages of the </p>
<p>Charge of the Knights, had returned to normal. However, the militias continued low-level </p>
<p>attacks against the Iraqi Police Service and soft targets (such as music shops or </p>
<p>weddings) and the Special Groups continued to target the MNF. Phase XI of the Charge </p>
<p>of the Knights, targeted at Abu Al Khasib and the al-Faw Peninsula, was due to begin </p>

<p><b>56. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group focused on economic developments at its meeting on </p>
<p>2 June (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Ms Margaret Aldred, Deputy Head of the Overseas and </p>
<p>Defence Secretariat, stressed that economic deliverables would form a core part of the </p>
<p>narrative that Mr Browne had asked for following his visit to Basra and asked DFID to </p>
<p>lead on compiling it. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> Mr Jon Day, MOD Director General Operational Policy, explained that that request </p>
<p>had followed a briefing by the PRT highlighting the lack of capacity within the UK system </p>
<p>to give an evidence-based account of what had been achieved in Basra. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr McDonald noted that Mr Brown would want to announce economic progress – </p>
<p>or, at the very least, a Basra economic plan – in his planned Parliamentary statement </p>
<p>in July.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Frank Baker, FCO Head of Iraq Group, updated the Group on progress towards </p>
<p>provincial elections. If the provincial elections law was passed by the end of June, </p>
<p>the elections could take place on 1 October, although December was more likely. </p>
<p>Some technical work remained to be done. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq briefly, on his way to Afghanistan, at the end of May, where </p>
<p>he “realised a personal ambition by having a cup of tea downtown”, the result of </p>
<p>“a remarkable transformation of the security situation”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>61. </b> In a report of his visit sent to Mr Brown on 4 June, Mr Browne wrote that he had </p>
<p>found UK troops “enthused about their new role, working alongside the resurgent Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces”, adding: </p>
<p>“Everyone I spoke to sensed a real prospect now to leave behind us in Basra a </p>
<p>positive legacy. As one officer put it to me, we are now in a similar position to 2003, </p>
<p>but with the benefit this time of a security environment which has a predominantly </p>
<p>Iraqi face. If we are to avoid the same pitfalls this time round, rapid investment is </p>
<p>needed in Joint Security Stations for the Iraqi Army and Police in Basra, and in </p>
<p>eye-catching short-term regeneration initiatives and medium term employment </p>
<p>schemes. This needn’t be UK money – the Government of Iraq is revelling in the </p>
<p>hike in oil prices … – but perhaps we should consider across government, as we </p>
<p>approach the final stages of Op TELIC, what value we would put upon some flagship </p>
<p>projects that we can point to as part of a positive UK legacy in southern Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Mr Browne explained that discussions with Lt Gen Cooper and </p>
<p>Maj Gen White-Spunner had confirmed that it would not be possible to go much below </p>
<p>the current troop level of 4,100 and still perform a useful mentoring and training role </p>
<p>without the substitution of US troops in some of the UK’s current tasks. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Browne considered that it should be possible to conclude the training of </p>
<p>14 Division by the end of 2008 and thereafter, should the UK so decide, to declare an </p>
<p>end to Op TELIC and a move to a longer-term bilateral relationship with Iraq, requiring </p>
<p>hundreds rather than thousands of troops. The timing of such a shift would fit with both </p>
<p>provincial elections and the expiry of resolution 1790. Even before UK troops departed, </p>
<p>Mr Browne pointed out that by October the US would have three times as much combat </p>
<p>power as the UK in MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>64. </b> In conclusion, Mr Browne said that he would work with Mr Miliband and </p>
<p>Mr Alexander “as a matter of urgency on the narrative that will put in context our </p>
<p>withdrawal of combat troops, and explain what we have achieved since 2003”.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> At the start of June, Australian and Czech troops left MND(SE).</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> Maj Gen White-</p>
<p>Spunner observed that, with the imminent departure of the Romanians: </p>
<p>“Our Multi-National Division is now not as multi-national as it once was, being … </p>
<p>essentially UK and US – not forgetting the two Romanians and one Lithuanian in </p>
<p>this headquarters.” </p>
<p><b>66. </b> On 7 June, Mr Prentice reported to the FCO on a briefing from Ambassador David </p>
<p>Satterfield, State Department Co-ordinator for Iraq, covering developments in negotiating </p>
<p>the US/Iraq Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) and Strategic Framework Agreement </p>
<p>(SFA).</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> The US aimed to have both signed by 31 July, coming into effect at the start </p>
<p>of 2009, and had almost reached agreement on the SFA. The SOFA had been set aside </p>
<p>in favour of a new “Implementing Arrangement” in the form of a protocol to the SFA. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> Mr Prentice reported that the US were “now settling for a degree of operational and </p>
<p>legal risk and there will be no chance of us being able to negotiate legally watertight </p>
<p>authorities or privileges and immunities which go beyond what the US accept”. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> Uncertainty remained over whether any eventual UK/Iraqi agreement would be </p>
<p>subject to separate Iraqi Government and/or Council of Representative approval. </p>
<p>Mr Prentice observed that the more the UK sought distinct arrangements, the more </p>
<p>risk there would be of particular political attention:</p>
<p>“There may also be some temptation to ‘go after’ the junior coalition partner; </p>
<p>post-Basra, there are still anti-British rumours in the corridors …”</p>
<p><b>69. </b> In his weekly report on 9 June, Lt Gen Cooper wrote that:</p>
<p>“The key political issue this week has been the bursting into print and speech by </p>
<p>many observers and politicians on the SFA/SOFA. Earlier in the week, most parties </p>
<p>declared some form of opposition to the SFA or very qualified and conditional </p>
<p>support based on significant caveats … As the week wore on, several senior </p>

<p>government spokesmen and officials began to ameliorate comment and produce </p>
<p>greater objectivity.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Public statements by the US Embassy and the MNF-I stressed “that any agreement </p>
<p>would be transparent, that there was no desire to have permanent US bases and that </p>
<p>there is no intent to use Iraq as a base from which to conduct offensive operations </p>
<p>against third parties”.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> In the same note, Lt Gen Cooper reflected on the remaining tasks for the UK in the </p>
<p>South of Iraq:</p>
<p>“… it is worth considering what is achievable between now and the end of 2008 and </p>
<p>the first half of 2009. I have already commented on the need to have metrics that are </p>
<p>measurable and understandable to non-military audiences in relation to completing </p>
<p>the training of 14 IA Div … And if we can get 14 Div right, I am confident that we will </p>
<p>have set the conditions for the successful delivery of Provincial elections in Basra.”</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported that Gen Petraeus had concluded on the basis of UK </p>
<p>statements that there would remain a UK brigade in place in 2009, probably focused </p>
<p>on Basra alone. Lt Gen Cooper cautioned that there had not yet been a political decision </p>
<p>on future deployments. He told ACM Stirrup that:</p>
<p>“It is difficult in Baghdad to discuss the issue substantively in the absence of a </p>
<p>confirmed political decision. Given the impending PM-POTUS meeting, I would </p>
<p>expect Petraeus’ expectation to be briefed to President Bush.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> On 9 June, a Current Intelligence Group (CIG) considered Basra city’s economy, the </p>

<p>23</p>
<p> The CIG’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. The recent Iraqi Government security operation in Basra City had largely driven </p>
<p>the Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) from the streets and brought a degree of stability. While </p>
<p>this lasts, there is a window of opportunity to create the conditions for economic </p>
<p>growth. However, insecurity, institutional incapacity, corruption, legislation, </p>
<p>competing political agendas, crime and smuggling will remain impediments to </p>
<p>reconstruction and development for the next twelve months.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“V. Militia violence and intimidation, which specifically targeted middle class </p>
<p>Basrawis, prompted many to leave, leaving a shortage of capable local </p>
<p>entrepreneurs, which is likely to persist beyond 2008.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>74. </b> The JIC examined the state of Sunni politics in Iraq in an Assessment of 11 June.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It confirmed a December 2007 judgement that, despite having worked together to oust </p>
<p>AQ-I, there was little sign the Sunni community had rallied to a single political party </p>
<p>or cause. </p>
<p><b>75. </b> The JIC judged that Sunni participation in the forthcoming provincial elections was </p>
<p>likely to be:</p>
<p>“… considerably higher than in 2005. Sunni expectations are high and are unlikely </p>
<p>to be met by the opportunities that political participation offers. Alienation will grow </p>
<p>unless Prime Minister Maliki’s government addresses their concerns.”</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The JIC judged that Sunni politicians commanded little support from “the Sunni </p>
<p>street” and that “established Sunni parties’ low credibility and growing competition </p>
<p>for votes will probably render them less dominant in national Sunni politics”. </p>
<p><b>77. </b> The JIC judged that “Iraq’s Arab neighbours are not driving Iraqi Sunni politics”.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> The JIC assessed that immediate Sunni concerns were focused on seeing security </p>
<p>gains translate into more jobs and better public services. Other common goals included </p>
<p>increased representation in the ISF and in the government; the release of Sunni </p>
<p>detainees; revision of the de-Ba’athification laws; constitutional review; a timetable for </p>
<p>the withdrawal of the MNF; and resisting Shia and Kurdish moves towards federalism. </p>
<p><b>79. </b> The JIC assessed that Sunni insurgent groups were increasingly interested in </p>
<p>the potential gains from political engagement, but saw such engagement “as additional </p>
<p>to, not instead of, armed resistance”. There was no sign that any such group had a </p>
<p>coherent or realistic set of national political objectives. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> On 11 June, Sir Mark Lyall-Grant, FCO Director General Political, circulated to </p>
<p>members of the FCO Board a paper on ‘Preparing for the End-Game in Basra’.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper set out an analysis of the impact of the Charge of the Knights:</p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>Maliki’s failure to consult us, and his well-publicised refusal to receive British </p>
<p>officers during the first week when things were going badly for the ISF, made </p>
<p>it hard for us to sustain our claims that we were co-operating closely with the </p>
<p>GoI on Basra, and that our military overwatch role was welcomed and valued </p>
<p>by the Iraqis.</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>the increased MNC-I (ie the US military) presence on the ground created a </p>
<p>mistaken but widespread perception in the US, and in the international media, </p>
<p>that we had abdicated to the US our post-PIC [Provisional Iraqi Control] </p>
<p>responsibilities for providing <i>in extremis</i> support for the ISF.</p>

<p>– </p>
<p>the fact that Maliki felt moved to intervene so precipitously in Basra, along with </p>
<p>the ISF’s lack of success in the first week of the operation, led to a renewal of </p>
<p>unfavourable comment from the US, GoI and the media about the state of Basra </p>
<p>when we handed it over to Iraqi control; our failure to deal effectively with the </p>
<p>militias; and the readiness of the Iraqi Security Forces we had trained.”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The paper also said that the UK’s relationship with Prime Minister Maliki had been:</p>
<p>“… severely tested by the events of late March: he believed that we had done deals </p>
<p>to allow JAM control of Basra, and that we were consequently unwilling to support </p>
<p>the GoI and ISF … we cannot be confident that he values or appreciates the UK </p>
<p>military role in the South, or that he would be particularly concerned by the timing </p>
<p>of our departure.”</p>
<p><b>82. </b> On 13 June, Maj Gen White-Spunner sent Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, </p>
<p>Chief of Joint Operations, an overview of MND(SE) prior to his visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“The overall mood across Iraq is positive, with attacks at a low level. The success </p>
<p>of the GoI’s initiatives in Sadr City and Mosul, together with the perception that AQ </p>
<p>and the Sunni insurgency are nearing defeat, have, of course, contributed to this, </p>
<p>but from a Basrawi perspective the improvement started with Charge of the Knights </p>
<p>in Basra, being Maliki’s first sign of willingness to act against the militias and criminal </p>
<p>gangs … a new confidence has emerged in the city, with people openly speaking </p>
<p>of life being better than it has been for years and a mood of optimism equal to that </p>
<p>experienced in 2003.” </p>
<p><b>83. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner commented: “There is a sense that the city is just waking </p>
<p>from a nightmare and rubbing its eyes as it contemplates what could turn out to be a </p>
<p>fine day, although it is too early to be sure.”</p>
<p><b>84. </b> On 13 June, Muqtada al-Sadr declared that JAM would be re-organised from </p>
<p>a militia into a primarily civilian, religious, social and cultural organisation, called </p>
<p>‘Mumahiidun’ (Showing the Way), and its members would be banned from carrying </p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> He added that a minority of JAM would be retained to resist the occupation.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> On 13 June, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs emailed Mr Brown </p>
<p>advice from Mr McDonald, explaining as he did that: “We asked Simon [McDonald] to </p>
<p>have another go at the Iraq numbers.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>86. </b> Mr McDonald advised that it would be possible to reduce UK troop numbers to </p>
<p>2,000 by the end of 2008 if the US assumed a number of the current key UK roles, </p>
<p>specifically either the training of 14 Division or the provision of enabling support.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>396</p>
<p><b>87. </b> However, military advice was that leaving Iraq before the key tasks had been </p>
<p>completed would damage the morale and reputation of the UK Armed Forces. ACM </p>
<p>Stirrup strongly opposed the idea of the US taking over the training of 14 Division, which </p>
<p>would leave the UK troops in a “low value-added supporting role of limited benefit”. </p>
<p>The US was thought likely to resent taking on “British tasks” when already stretched. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> Consequently, Mr McDonald recommended that Mr Brown should “decide that UK </p>
<p>forces complete training 14 Division, and then prepare to leave Basra”. Completing the </p>
<p>training “could make the difference to whether we can end our six-year engagement in </p>
<p>Iraq as success or failure”. Departure from Basra could begin before the end of 2008, </p>
<p>making the troop rotation that ended in May 2009 the last of Op TELIC. He advised </p>
<p>that Mr Brown should agree the policy with President Bush and then with Presidential </p>
<p>Candidates Mr Barack Obama and Mr John McCain, before being announced in July. </p>
<p>Mr McDonald also recommended that Mr Brown visit Iraq after the announcement to </p>
<p>highlight the UK’s economic and security achievements.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> On 15 June, during a Presidential visit to London, Mr Brown hosted a dinner for </p>
<p>President Bush and the two men had an hour-long one-to-one the following day.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>was no discussion of troop numbers in Iraq. Mr Brown said that it was right for the UK to </p>
<p>focus on the four key tasks in MND(SE): training 14 Division, provincial elections before </p>
<p>the end of November, economic reconstruction, and preparation of the port and airport </p>
<p>for civilian control.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> On 16 June, Lt Gen Cooper reported that Muqtada al-Sadr’s statement about the </p>
<p>re-organisation of JAM left both OMS and JAM “in limbo”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> He reported that some </p>
<p>commentators wondered whether it was a precursor to disbanding JAM. Muqtada </p>
<p>al-Sadr had repeated that OMS would not participate in the provincial elections and </p>
<p>the movement remained unregistered with the electoral authorities.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Lt Gen Cooper also reported that “stoppage in the SFA/SOFA negotiations is now </p>
<p>well trailed in the local and international media. We await details of any new discussions </p>
<p>to emerge.”</p>
<p><b>92. </b> On 20 June, Maj Gen White-Spunner’s weekly report from Basra contained “some </p>
<p>metrics which show what life is like for Basrawis”, based on a survey conducted for the </p>

<p>the majority of the time. This is in stark contrast to March when only 60 percent </p>
<p>considered that they had enough to live on and only 25 percent thought they </p>
<p>had enough food. We are also seeing an upward trend in support for the ISF. </p>
<p>The perception that the ISF are defeating the Militias increased by 11 percent </p>
<p>in May to 59 percent with similar trends reported for general confidence in the </p>
<p>security situation, now at 75 percent, and increase of 18 percent over the previous </p>
<p>month, and in confidence in the ISF’s ability to protect the population increasing </p>
<p>by 10 percent to 70 percent overall. Finally, 74 percent of those polled consider </p>
<p>the environment safe enough to report crimes to the ISF, which is an increase </p>
<p>of 6 percent over last month.”</p>
<p><b>94. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner also reported that Operation Charge of the Knights XIV had </p>
<p>begun on 18 June, covering “the continuous maintenance of security and control by the </p>
<p>ISF throughout Basra Province … and, secondly, support to ISF operations in Maysan”. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra reported on 23 June that Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights XIV was targeting insurgents returning to the city, and had generated “further </p>
<p>weapons finds and detentions” as well as an increase in attacks against the MNF </p>
<p>and ISF, albeit “single rather than multiple rocket attacks which suggests a reduced </p>
<p>capability”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> There appeared to be public support for ISF action. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> In the same report, the British Embassy Office recorded “the first visit in ten months </p>
<p>by UK CivPol [civilian police] to the Joint Police Command Centre (JPCC) in Basra”. </p>
<p>The report said:</p>
<p>“The success of the initial visit to the PJCC cannot be over-emphasised. It will </p>
<p>enable, as the security situation allows, future opportunities for the CivPol team to </p>
<p>engage close[ly] with the IPS as part of the continuing strategy to support, develop </p>
<p>and assess policing standards.”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> On 23 June Lt Gen Cooper advised ACM Stirrup of the importance of engaging </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government “sooner rather than later on the nature of our long term strategic </p>
<p>relationship with them … we need to see through Iraqi eyes … rather than risk taking </p>
<p>the future for granted”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>98. </b> The same report stated that Charge of the Knights XIV had been “well-co-ordinated” </p>
<p>and “executed to plan”. Lt Gen Cooper reported:</p>
<p>“A vignette that brings to life the burgeoning sense of confidence within the ISF is </p>
<p>that a departing JAM member had painted the graffiti comment ‘<i>We’ll be back</i>’ on the </p>
<p>Yugoslav bridge in Amara to which an Iraqi soldier had added ‘<i>We’ll be waiting</i>’.”</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Qadisiyah and Anbar provinces were scheduled for transfer to Provincial Iraqi </p>
<p>Control (PIC) at the end of June, and Lt Gen Cooper commented that Gen Petraeus </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>“went further than he had hitherto in commenting that he now had a sense of momentum </p>
<p>about the future”. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> On 30 June, Gen Petraeus was reported to have “accepted as likely .. that a </p>
<p>bridging arrangement will be adopted and that a final SOFA will not emerge in 2008”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>101. </b> Lt Gen Cooper judged that Iraqi desire to assert sovereignty was increasing, and </p>
<p>was having a significant impact on the SOFA negotiations. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> General Sir Richard Dannatt, Chief of the General Staff, visited Basra at the end of </p>
<p>June, and reported a “very positive mood within MND(SE) and a real sense that we may </p>
<p>actually be able to deliver success, although within a realistic timeframe”.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> He believed </p>
<p>it was important to be “absolutely focused on delivering success – in terms of the </p>
<p>objectives that we have already set – rather than be too directed by any understandable </p>
<p>desire for early delivery”. However, he remained “unconvinced that the PRT in Basra is </p>
<p>demonstrating enough energy, purpose and drive to be able to deliver meaningful results </p>
<p>in the timeframe we require”.</p>

<p><b>103. </b> On 3 July, Mr Day told the Iraq Strategy Group that negotiations between the US </p>
<p>and Iraq on legal arrangements for the presence of US forces were going badly.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>SOFA was now “on the back burner” and the US was pursuing an Interim Protocol to </p>
<p>span the gap between the end of the Security Council resolution and the completion of </p>
<p>a SOFA. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Day thought the most likely outcome was a six month rollover of the Chapter VII </p>
<p>mandate contained in the resolution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr McDonald said that solution would be </p>
<p>acceptable to the UK. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> The UK would require an additional bilateral amendment, in light of its obligations </p>
<p>under the European Convention on Human Rights. Mr McDonald noted that Mr Brown </p>
<p>had previously stated that UK forces were in Iraq under a UN mandate and at the </p>
<p>invitation of the Iraqi Government; it would be necessary to continue that cover </p>
<p>into 2009.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Day told the Iraq Strategy Group that the MOD was developing a paper on the </p>
<p>long term UK military role in Iraq which would map the route to a normal bilateral military </p>
<p>relationship. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Prentice called on Ambassador Crocker on 4 July to discuss the SFA and </p>

<p>Mr Prentice described “clear signs that some in Maliki’s circle … saw no need to give the </p>
<p>UK and other non-US forces a role beyond 2008”. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Ambassador Crocker told Mr Prentice that, in his opinion, those views were based </p>
<p>on “ignorance of the breadth of the present UK role and on overconfidence in the </p>
<p>capabilities of the ISF”. He did not think that Prime Minister Maliki had a clear position </p>
<p>yet on an agreement with the UK. Mr Prentice considered that the US and UK should </p>
<p>avoid closing off any options. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Prentice also described plans for Mr Day to visit Iraq with “a non-paper which </p>
<p>set out what we would require in terms of legal cover for UK forces post Chapter VII and </p>
<p>asked a number of open-ended questions” to discuss with the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> On 8 July, the British Embassy Office Basra reported that the operational phase </p>
<p>of Charge of the Knights had ended.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> Phase XV, an influence/information campaign, </p>
<p>was in the initial planning stage. </p>
<p><b>111. </b> On 9 July a CIG provided a “sitrep on the electoral process”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>112. </b> The CIG judged that for provincial elections to be held before the end of 2008, the </p>
<p>relevant legislation needed to be passed by the end of July. The key issues still being </p>
<p>debated were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the elections would run on an open list (allowing voters to back </p>
<p>individual candidates) or a closed one (limiting choices to political parties); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the elections should be held simultaneously across all 18 provinces.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Parties that stood to lose out in the elections had been privately lobbying for a </p>
<p>closed list, or a hybrid between the two systems, but the Iraqi Government favoured </p>
<p>an open list system. Prime Minister Maliki favoured staggered elections, while the </p>
<p>Independent High Electoral Commission, whose job it was to oversee and manage </p>
<p>the elections, favoured a simultaneous approach.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> The CIG considered that the elections had the potential to support the national </p>
<p>reconciliation process by providing those who had been excluded from power with </p>
<p>a means of entering the political process. Greater participation from OMS (which </p>
<p>had boycotted the last elections), new Sunni political parties, the Sunni Arab Tribal </p>
<p>“awakening” groups and a range of independent candidates was expected to improve </p>
<p>the representativeness of local councils.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> The CIG reported that OMS had not registered as a political party, on the grounds </p>
<p>that Muqtada al-Sadr believed that participation would be tantamount to support for the </p>
<p>“occupation”. However, the media had reported that OMS would field “independent” </p>
<p>Sadrist candidates on other parties’ lists. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>400</p>
<p><b>116. </b> The CIG assessed that any Sadrist gains were likely to come at the expense of the </p>
<p>“smaller independent parties, Fadilah and, to a lesser extent, ISCI and Dawa”. The Note </p>
<p>concluded:</p>
<p>“Newly registered parties to look out for include the Iraqi People’s Assembly </p>
<p>(a possibly proxy for JAM Special Groups), First Iraqi Gathering (formerly the </p>
<p>Sadrists splinter Iraqi National Gathering), the Independence and Rising Movement </p>
<p>(affiliated to Jaysh al-Islami) and the Iraqi Awakening Conference (formerly Sahawa </p>
<p>al-Iraq). Not all will win seats …”</p>
<p><b>117. </b> On 14 July, following a visit to Iraq, Mr Day told the Iraq Strategy Group that US </p>
<p>negotiations on the SFA/SOFA were making little progress.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> Iraqi officials and ministers </p>
<p>had told him that Prime Minister Maliki wanted UK/Iraq talks on a future legal agreement, </p>
<p>separate and parallel to the US negotiations. But Mr Day told the Iraq Strategy Group:</p>
<p>“… the Iraqis wanted the UK combat role to end by mid-2009 at the latest. They </p>
<p>would want any residual military relationship to be far smaller and on a different </p>
<p>legal basis.”</p>
<p><b>118. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group agreed that, if NSID agreed, the UK should pursue </p>
<p>bilateral talks with the objective of reaching agreement in October.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Day also reported that there was “strong Iraqi interest” in an arrangement </p>
<p>“regularising the bilateral relationship”, perhaps through a Memorandum of </p>
<p>Understanding or Exchange of Letters, with the military relationship as a small </p>
<p>component. The Iraq Strategy Group agreed that it would be helpful to begin discussions </p>
<p>on future relations, but should not discuss a written agreement until after Mr Brown’s </p>
<p>visit to Iraq or before the UK had clarified its own strategic objectives. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported to ACM Stirrup that “as is clear from Jon Day’s meetings </p>
<p>during his recent visit, there are differing views from various members of the GoI”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He concluded “there is a possibility that Maliki may adopt one of several positions when </p>
<p>he meets the PM: receptive to our suggestions, hostile and indicating that he sees </p>
<p>no need for UK presence or uncommitted either way”.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that for Prime Minister Maliki “the leitmotif from the start </p>
<p>was: when are we going to get out of chapter VII”.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>122. </b> On 15 July, Mr Prentice called again on Ambassador Crocker, who told him that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Executive Council had agreed the previous day to proceed with negotiations with </p>
<p>the US, firstly on the SFA, then the short-term bridging Protocol and finally on the longer </p>
<p>term SOFA.</p>

<p><b>123. </b> Ambassador Crocker and Mr Prentice agreed that the UK negotiations could run in </p>
<p>parallel with the US ones, but would be “shaped by them” and were unlikely to conclude </p>
<p>until after the US/Iraqi negotiations had ended. Mr Prentice explained that the UK’s </p>
<p>deadline for concluding talks was mid-October, both to ensure there was time to finalise </p>
<p>the UK arrangements after the US arrangements were in place but also to allow time </p>
<p>for the necessary Parliamentary procedures in London.</p>
<p><b>124. </b> The Overseas and Defence Sub-Committee of NSID met on 15 July to discuss </p>
<p>a paper prepared by Cabinet Office officials on UK strategy in Iraq 2008/2009.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The officials recommended that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s key tasks in Iraq for 2008/2009 should be:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>training and mentoring the Iraqi Army’s 14 Division, until it was capable of </p>
<p>independent operations with minimal coalition support (expected in about </p>
<p>April 2009);</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>supporting provincial elections, due by the end of 2008; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>supporting economic development in Basra, based on Mr Wareing’s outline </p>
<p>Economic Development Strategy (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>4,000 UK troops would be required in southern Iraq until 14 Division was trained </p>
<p>but after that UK forces should move to a significantly different future role, </p>
<p>requiring fewer troops.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Brown should set out this policy in a statement on 22 July.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Officials should continue to pursue legal cover for a continued UK mission, </p>
<p>through either a resolution rollover (seen as “increasingly likely”) or bilateral </p>
<p>relations with Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should continue to press for passage of the Hydrocarbons Law. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Once drawdown plans were clearer, NSID(OD) should agree UK strategic </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq and the resources needed to pursue them.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> At the meeting, Mr Browne described his recent discussions in Washington with </p>
<p>Mr Hadley and General Lute.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Mr Browne reported that the US was likely to agree to Iraqi demands for an </p>
<p>indicative timetable for troop withdrawals and would welcome a UK policy statement </p>
<p>which “could set out the conditions for a move from combat operations (ending </p>
<p>Operation TELIC) to a long-term relationship” and “could say we expected to meet </p>
<p>conditions in early 2009, and could then reduce troop numbers significantly”.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> ACM Stirrup reported that the UK could expect to complete its current military </p>
<p>tasks in 2009, allowing transition to a normal bilateral relationship. In discussion, </p>
<p>it was suggested that the “remaining military tasks” beyond April 2009 were continued </p>

<p>“small scale” mentoring of 14 Division’s HQ, training the Iraqi Navy and supporting </p>
<p>officer training. These would “resemble normal defence co-operation”.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Mr Miliband warned that provincial elections might be postponed until April 2009, </p>
<p>or to coincide with Iraqi Parliamentary elections the following autumn. </p>
<p><b>129. </b> Mr Alexander reported on Mr Wareing’s draft economic strategy (this is addressed </p>
<p>in Section 10.2). </p>
<p><b>130. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Brown welcomed the opportunity that his 22 July </p>
<p>statement would provide to set out UK policy publicly, given the risk that the next US </p>
<p>President might ask the UK to “hold further changes”. He summed up that the UK’s </p>
<p>key goals for the year ahead should be to push for early provincial elections; hand over </p>
<p>Basra Airport by the end of 2008; produce an economic plan shortly; and complete </p>
<p>training of 14 Division by the end of May 2009.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> On 15 July, the Assessments Staff reviewed recent intelligence on foreign fighters </p>
<p>in Iraq against an earlier JIC judgement</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> that the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan were </p>
<p>“creating a new supply of battle-hardened jihadists that will add resilience to the wider </p>
<p>AQ campaign”.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>132. </b> The update stated:</p>
<p>“Since 2003, we estimate that several thousand foreign fighters … have travelled </p>
<p>to Iraq to undertake jihad. We judge that the majority of these joined Al Qaida in </p>
<p>Iraq (AQ-I) and became either suicide bombers or were killed in other action. But </p>
<p>a proportion have left Iraq as experienced and competent jihadist fighters …</p>
<p>“The total number of foreign fighters who have left Iraq since 2003 remains unclear </p>
<p>… We are aware of only a handful of individuals who have come to the UK after </p>
<p>fighting in Iraq, and have seen no intelligence to suggest that these individuals are </p>
<p>currently involved in attack planning.</p>
<p>“The impact of the return from Iraq of foreign fighters has, so far, been less than the </p>
<p>JIC predicted.”</p>
<p><b>133. </b> On 17 July, Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that MND(SE) was an entirely UK/US </p>
<p>organisation, apart from one Australian “handling their loose ends”. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner also reported that he had discussed with Lt Gen Austin </p>
<p>the transfer of the UK’s remaining responsibilities in Maysan, Muthanna and Dhi Qar </p>

<p>sense but Lt Gen Austin thought that Gen Petraeus might take the view that it would be </p>
<p>presentationally difficult for the US. </p>
<p><b>135. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner commented that if the transfer did not go ahead, “it will not </p>
<p>make much practical difference to us as MND(C) are already dealing with governance </p>
<p>and economic reconstruction”.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> On 18 July, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs informed Mr Brown </p>
<p>that Prime Minister Maliki had told Mr Prentice that he wanted to end the coalition </p>
<p>presence in Iraq as soon as possible.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> Prime Minister Maliki did not want to agree </p>
<p>to the continuation of any coalition forces other than the US beyond the end of 2008. </p>
<p>US officials were concerned by this proposal and by the wording of Mr Brown’s </p>
<p>statement which declared an end to Op TELIC and withdrawal of all UK combat troops </p>
<p>in early 2009. </p>
<p><b>137. </b> On the same day, <i>BBC News</i> reported a White House announcement that:</p>
<p>“Improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation </p>
<p>to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals – such as the </p>
<p>resumption of Iraqi security control in their cities and provinces and the further </p>
<p>reduction of US combat forces from Iraq.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>138. </b> According to the report, the announcement was prompted by Prime Minister Maliki, </p>
<p>raising the prospect of setting a timetable for the withdrawal of US troops as part of </p>
<p>negotiations of a new security agreement. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> Mr Brown visited Iraq on 19 July, during which he held a bilateral meeting with </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Brown underlined to Prime Minister Maliki the UK’s wish to help on key issues, </p>
<p>including Basra port, oil and the steel industry as well as the training of 14 Division. </p>
<p>He commented that the Iraqi police and army were “increasingly ready” and capable of </p>
<p>taking over their responsibilities. </p>
<p><b>141. </b> Prime Minister Maliki agreed that it was in the interests of both countries to have </p>
<p>long-term co-operation in all fields, including training the military. The Iraqi people’s </p>
<p>desire for the departure of all foreign forces did not necessarily mean that they were </p>
<p>ungrateful for the help that had been provided, but they wanted to be a sovereign nation </p>
<p>and he did not feel that there was a need for such a large number of foreign forces to </p>
<p>be present.</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Brown explained that UK forces would not stay longer than was necessary </p>

<p>Airport operational and supporting provincial elections. That would take until mid 2009. </p>
<p>Negotiations could begin immediately, in advance of a further meeting in October. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Brown concluded that:</p>
<p>“… in principle they had agreed to negotiate until October this year; that the tasks </p>
<p>the UK was undertaking would be complete by mid-2009; and that Maliki supported </p>
<p>a further training role for the British Army while we finished our current tasks. It was </p>
<p>essential that the GOI [Government of Iraq] understood that by the end of December </p>
<p>2009, we should have an MOU giving our forces a legal basis. He and Maliki should </p>
<p>speak monthly to avoid misunderstandings.”</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Later the same day, Mr Brown met Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He told them that after meeting Prime Minister Maliki he felt that there was agreement to </p>
<p>a transition process. Although Prime Minister Maliki had said he wanted an agreement </p>
<p>with the UK, Mr Brown felt that he was “unclear about what he wanted in it”. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Ambassador Crocker explained that the White House statement the previous day </p>
<p>did not mean a change in US policy: the “time horizons” were “aspirational” and did not </p>
<p>have fixed dates. The Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi Government had so </p>
<p>far “made good progress”. In response to a question from Mr McDonald, Ambassador </p>
<p>Crocker said that he thought rolling over the UN Security Council resolution once again </p>
<p>would be politically impossible for Prime Minister Maliki. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> Following Mr Brown’s visit, on 21 July Lt Gen Cooper reported that the UK </p>
<p>appeared to have a way forward to secure an agreement with Iraq in terms of future </p>
<p>UK military contribution.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> But he cautioned against an assumption that the Iraqi </p>
<p>position would remain unchanged and urged “it will be essential for London to be very </p>
<p>closely engaged with this office, in order to be fully informed on the current Baghdad </p>
<p>atmospherics”.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Lt Gen Cooper also reported “a week of notable milestones” in Iraq. They </p>
<p>included the return of Tawafuq to the Government, following approval by the Council </p>
<p>of Representatives of a ministerial slate that appointed six Tawafuq ministers, and oil </p>
<p>production exceeding pre-war levels for the first time. The provincial elections law was </p>
<p>scheduled to pass through the Council of Representatives, giving a possible election </p>
<p>date of 22 December, but there was “no overwhelming sense that it will actually happen”. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> On 22 July, Mr Brown told Cabinet that he would be making a statement to the </p>
<p>House of Commons later that day.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Brown explained that UK force levels in Iraq had reduced to 4,100. A planned </p>
<p>further reduction to 2,500 had been suspended in March when the Iraqi Government </p>

<p>had decided to take action in Basra. UK troops had taken on a more active training </p>
<p>and mentoring role, with around 1,000 UK personnel currently embedded in Iraqi units. </p>
<p>Levels of violence had reduced significantly and life in Basra was returning to normal. </p>
<p>The UK was pursuing four key functions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces had moved from a combat to an overwatch role. UK troops’ primary </p>
<p>role was training and mentoring Iraqi forces, with a last resort intervention </p>
<p>capability, although that was also gradually being taken over by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pursuing economic development, which was showing some evidence of </p>
<p>success, providing Iraqi citizens with work and a stake in their future.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Local government elections, which would give former members of the militia </p>
<p>the opportunity to engage in democratic politics. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working to transfer Basra Airport from military to civilian control. </p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Brown said that the Basra Development Commission would produce an </p>
<p>economic plan in the autumn and he hoped that local elections and the handover of </p>
<p>Basra Airport would take place by the end of the year. Training of 14 Division should </p>
<p>also be completed by the end of the year, with additional training of headquarters and </p>
<p>specialist functions required in early 2009. Mr Brown “expected that we would be able </p>
<p>to make substantial reduction in the number of British forces next year, but that would </p>
<p>depend on circumstances. He was not going to make an estimate of the numbers now.”</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Finally, Mr Brown told Cabinet that the UK would be working to sign “a new </p>
<p>agreement” with the Iraqi Government, and he would tell the House of Commons that </p>
<p>the UK would be “ready to move to a new relationship in the first half of next year”.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Summing up, Mr Brown concluded that whilst some militia activity in Iraq was </p>
<p>“inevitable”, in general “security had significantly improved”. A new agreement with </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government would require “significant negotiation” and the Armed Forces </p>
<p>would need a legal basis for operations post-December. If the UK had left Iraq a few </p>
<p>months ago, the job would not have been finished; with the improvements in security, </p>
<p>momentum for economic development and a move towards local democracy once the </p>
<p>elections were held, the Iraqi people now felt that they had a stake in the future.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee published a report into UK operations </p>
<p>in Iraq on 22 June, before Mr Brown made his statement.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>154. </b> The report concluded that following the Charge of the Knights, a high degree </p>
<p>of security had been restored to Basra and “the preconditions are in place for political </p>
<p>progress and economic recovery”. However, “the UK Government must ensure that </p>
<p>it continues to provide support to the ISF to ensure that the progress which has been </p>
<p>made is not lost and that Basra does not slip back into instability”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>406</p>
<p><b>155. </b> The Defence Committee considered that military training offered “an opportunity to </p>
<p>maintain a substantial position of influence for the common good in southern Iraq, if we </p>
<p>can commit the military capacity to do so”. </p>
<p><b>156. </b> On the afternoon of 22 July, Mr Brown made a statement “to update the House </p>
<p>on the latest developments in Iraq”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> He reiterated the objective he had described in </p>
<p>October 2007 for “an independent, prosperous, democratic Iraq that is free of terrorist </p>
<p>violence, secure within its borders and a stable presence in the region”. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Brown told the House of Commons:</p>
<p>“In recent months, conditions in Basra have shown a marked improvement. Incidents </p>
<p>of indirect fire against British troops in the Basra air station have fallen from </p>
<p>200 a month at their peak last summer to an average of fewer than five a month </p>
<p>since April this year. As the all-party House of Commons Defence Committee … </p>
<p>says in its report today, the security situation in Basra has been ‘transformed’.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The most important development is that the improvements that we have seen </p>
<p>have been increasingly Iraqi-led. Security responsibility for 10 of 18 provinces has </p>
<p>now transferred to Iraqi control, including all four provinces in Britain’s areas of </p>
<p>operations …” </p>
<p><b>158. </b> Mr Brown continued:</p>
<p>“The improved security situation has provided a platform for further, essential </p>
<p>progress on reconciliation. We have seen not only increased co-operation between </p>
<p>Sunni communities and the Iraqi Government … and the return of the Tawafuq Sunni </p>
<p>party to the Government, but the passage of key legislation that is helping to embed </p>
<p>democracy … The next stage will be Provincial elections … Our message to the </p>
<p>leaders of all Iraq’s communities … is that they must continue to make these right </p>
<p>long-term decisions to achieve a sustainable peace …</p>
<p>“We will also continue to focus on helping the Iraqi Government to rebuild their </p>
<p>economy and ensuring that the Iraqi people all have a stake in the future.” </p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Brown went on to describe the UK’s changing role:</p>
<p>“Nine months ago, I set out the key elements of our strategy for handing over </p>
<p>security in Basra to the Iraqis and set out the stages for completing the tasks </p>
<p>that we have set ourselves. We completed the initial phase on target, handing </p>
<p>over Basra to Provincial Iraqi Control in December. This allowed us to reduce </p>
<p>troop numbers in southern Iraq from 5,500 in September to 4,500. After the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government launched Operation Charge of the Knights to enforce the rule of law in </p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>407</p>
<p>Basra against the militias … the military advice was that we should pause the further </p>
<p>planned reduction …</p>
<p>“Since then, we have responded to changing needs and embedded more </p>
<p>than 800 UK personnel within the Iraqi command structure … The focus of the </p>
<p>4,100 forces still in southern Iraq is now on completing the task of training and </p>
<p>mentoring the 14th division of the Iraqi army in Basra … Other remaining military </p>
<p>tasks … include finalising the preparation of Basra Airport for civilian control, and </p>
<p>continuing to develop the capacity of the Iraqi navy and marines …</p>
<p>“It is now right to complete the tasks we have set ourselves …</p>
<p>“As we complete these tasks and as progress continues in these different areas, </p>
<p>we will continue to reduce the number of British troops in Iraq. Of course, future </p>
<p>decisions will, as always, be based on the advice of our military commanders on the </p>
<p>ground, but I can tell the House today that, just as last year we moved from combat </p>
<p>to overwatch, we expect a further fundamental change of mission in the first months </p>
<p>of 2009, as we make the transition to a long-term bilateral relationship with Iraq, </p>
<p>similar to the normal relationships that our military forces have with other important </p>
<p>countries in the region.”</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Concluding his statement, Mr Brown explained that Mr Browne and military </p>
<p>commanders would work with the Iraqi Government to agree the details of the long term </p>
<p>UK/Iraq relationship, including “its necessary legal basis”, and report to the House in </p>
<p>the autumn. </p>
<p><b>161. </b> On 26 July, Mr Brown met Senator Obama.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary for </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs reported that: </p>
<p>“… the Prime Minister explained why he had taken his decisions on timelines and </p>
<p>overwatch.” </p>
<p><b>162. </b> On 28 July, Lt Gen Cooper reported to ACM Stirrup that the US military were </p>
<p>discussing agreeing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>instead of a Status of Forces Agreement.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> An MOU would “look very similar” to a </p>
<p>SOFA but would “avoid the political emotion that the term creates”. At the heart of the </p>
<p>arrangement would be the formation of a joint committee that agreed operations.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Lt Gen Cooper also reported that the Council of Representatives had passed the </p>
<p>Provincial Election Law, but the Presidential Council had rejected it. If issues were not </p>
<p>resolved and the law re-passed before the Council of Representatives rose on 30 July, </p>
<p>then elections were likely to be delayed into 2009, with possible implications for UK </p>
<p>transition plans. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>408</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Baker briefed the Iraq Strategy Group on 28 July that the “sticking point” on </p>
<p>the Electoral Law “was how Kirkuk would be governed until 2010” and “prospects for </p>
<p>agreement were poor”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> Mr McDonald emphasised the importance to Mr Brown of </p>
<p>elections taking place on time. The Group agreed to keep up pressure for the Electoral </p>
<p>Law to be adopted before 30 July, including through conversations with US interlocutors.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Mr Baker also reported that FCO and MOD lawyers were working towards </p>
<p>agreeing the UK’s internal position on the legal arrangements for British forces in Iraq, to </p>
<p>enable negotiations to start in early September, subject to Iraqi agreement. He observed </p>
<p>that the FCO and the MOD “would require a judgement by the Attorney General about </p>
<p>use of force, given that the Iraqis would not want us to declare that an internal armed </p>
<p>conflict existed in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>166. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group judged that the US negotiations, which were close </p>
<p>to agreement, were unlikely to complicate the UK’s, although “we may face a tough </p>
<p>negotiation if the US agreement did not include elements which we will want included </p>
<p>in our own agreement”.</p>
<p><b>August 2008</b></p>
<p><b>167. </b> On 7 August, the JIC reviewed security prospects for the Kurdish north of Iraq, at </p>
<p>the request of the MOD and the FCO.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>168. </b> The JIC judged that the Kurdistan Region was still the most stable part of Iraq, </p>
<p>continuing to outpace the rest of the country in terms of trade, reconstruction, investment </p>
<p>and economic growth. By contrast, the other northern provinces – Ninawa and Ta’min </p>
<p>(formerly Kirkuk), which were administered by the Government of Iraq – accounted </p>
<p>for more than 80 percent of insurgent attacks recorded across Iraq. Unlike central </p>
<p>and southern Iraq, much of the violence there was ethnically motivated. Criminality, </p>
<p>especially extortion and intimidation by insurgents, was a serious problem.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgments included:</p>
<p>“III. The Arab/Kurd dispute over control of Kirkuk and other territories is likely to </p>
<p>intensify in the next few months as the UN makes its recommendations on their </p>
<p>future administration. Street fighting and displacement of local communities could </p>
<p>occur with little warning, and solidify ethnic divisions in local ISF.</p>
<p>“IV. Intensified coalition and ISF operations have failed to eradicate Al Qaida in </p>
<p>Iraq (AQ-I) in Mosul. But they have greatly limited its operational effectiveness and </p>
<p>access to funding. AQ-I is nevertheless likely to be capable of occasional surges in </p>
<p>activity including high profile attacks in Iraq’s major cities for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>“V. Against any determined and competent opponents in the north, ISF will still </p>
<p>need help for at least the next few years with airborne surveillance, heavy fire </p>
<p>power (including from the air) and embedded coalition training teams. The Kurds’ </p>
<p>Peshmerga forces in the Kurdistan Region face fewer challenges.”</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Considering longer-term trends, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“In the longer term, we assess that the balance of power is gradually changing: </p>
<p>as the Baghdad government becomes more confident and assertive, it is likely to </p>
<p>be less willing to accommodate Kurdish intransigence, and the risk of confrontations </p>
<p>will rise, especially over disputed oil revenue sharing. KRG political unity is not </p>
<p>assured. Power sharing between the two main political parties, the PUK and KDP, is </p>
<p>working well. But tensions following their civil war in 1995-1998 remain. We assess </p>
<p>that the process of who succeeds PUK leader Talabani (now 75) … will test stability.”</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Brown wrote to Prime Minister Maliki on 11 August, attaching a copy of his </p>
<p>22 July statement to the House of Commons.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> In the covering letter he explained </p>
<p>that the UK did not want to retain combat troops inside Iraq once their current tasks </p>
<p>(particularly the training and mentoring of the 14th Division of the Iraqi Army in Basra) </p>
<p>had been completed. He expected that, subject to conditions on the ground, it would be </p>
<p>possible to complete training of 14 Division in 2009 and start to reduce the number of </p>
<p>UK troops in southern Iraq. He explained that in order to complete the training, the UK </p>
<p>would require a firm legal basis for the presence of personnel in Iraq beyond the end </p>
<p>of 2008. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Brown continued by addressing a concern expressed by Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>about the detention of Iraqi citizens by UK forces in Basra. He explained that the UK </p>
<p>held only two criminal detainees, on remand awaiting transfer to the Iraqi criminal justice </p>
<p>system to be tried for involvement in the murders of two British servicemen. Mr Brown </p>
<p>explained that only nine individuals had been interned in Basra in 2008, but “the UK </p>
<p>is not at present holding any security internees”. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> During a meeting with Mr Prentice on 17 August, Prime Minister Maliki agreed </p>
<p>to open discussions on a UK SOFA in late August or early September.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Mr Prentice </p>
<p>reported that the equivalent US/Iraqi negotiations were at a delicate stage, with no </p>
<p>guarantee of a result.</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Mr Prentice attended the Iraqi National Security Council on 24 August, and </p>
<p>reported that Iraqi Ministers had requested advice on how long it would take for Iraq </p>
<p>to be able to handle its own security needs without outside help, to inform political </p>
<p>decisions on how long an MNF-I presence was required.</p>

<p><b>175. </b> On 27 August, Mr Day wrote to Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary with an </p>
<p>update on the legal framework for UK troops.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> He reported that since Mr Prentice’s </p>
<p>meeting with Prime Minister Maliki, “US/Iraq negotiations have become increasingly </p>
<p>difficult and seem to have reached an impasse”. Prime Minister Maliki was reported </p>
<p>to have “fundamental concerns over Iraqi sovereignty”. </p>
<p><b>176. </b> The key outstanding issues were jurisdiction over MNF service personnel and </p>
<p>timelines for the withdrawal of combat forces. Mr Day said that UK officials and lawyers </p>
<p>had been undertaking the technical work to prepare for negotiations with the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, but it was not possible to make substantive progress on the drafting of a </p>
<p>UK/Iraq framework before the final outcome of the US/Iraq process. That was unlikely </p>
<p>before the middle of September. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Day considered that once US/Iraq agreement had been reached, it should </p>
<p>be “reasonably straightforward” to complete a draft UK/Iraq agreement as a basis for </p>
<p>discussion. The aim remained to reach agreement on text by the middle of October, </p>
<p>in advance of Prime Minister Maliki’s proposed visit to London.</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Day also reported that “If the US does not succeed it will focus on trying to </p>
<p>renew the current Chapter VII Security Council mandate”. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> On 29 August, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Brown’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary for Foreign Affairs with an update on the US proposals for military transition </p>
<p>in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> Reports from Iraq suggested that “the US military has become </p>
<p>reconciled to the departure of UK ground troops from Basra by the end of May 2009” </p>
<p>and was working to generate the forces they believed were needed as replacements. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Browne had agreed that “planning on the basis of the US proposals </p>
<p>represented a good opportunity both to meet the Prime Minister’s intent of moving to </p>
<p>a fundamental change of mission in the first half of 2009 and to maintain our strategic </p>
<p>relationship with the US”. Transition at the end of May would enable completion of the </p>
<p>training of 14 Division and the handover of Basra Airport. The MOD would look to make </p>
<p>reductions in force levels before the end of May, but military advice was that it was </p>
<p>unlikely to be possible to make significant reductions before “we are able to relinquish </p>
<p>core functions to the US Brigade”. </p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary also reported that contingency planning was under </p>
<p>way in case agreement could not be reached on a legal basis for UK operations in Iraq, </p>
<p>and forces had to be withdrawn sooner. </p>

<p>411</p>
<p><b>September 2008</b></p>
<p><b>182. </b> At the start of September, Mr Prentice sent the FCO a “snapshot of what has gone </p>
<p>well and badly over the summer break” and an assessment of prospects for the autumn </p>
<p>and into 2009 as “background to work starting in Whitehall on a ‘whole Iraq’ strategy </p>
<p>and UK transition in 2009”.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> Mr Prentice summarised the content of his advice as </p>
<p>“arguments for sustaining our investment in the ‘New Iraq’”, but wrote that the prospects </p>
<p>were “more clouded” than when he arrived in Iraq the year before. </p>
<p><b>183. </b> Under the heading “What went well”, Mr Prentice recorded that the security </p>
<p>situation across Iraq had continued to improve throughout the summer. Casualty </p>
<p>statistics were at a four-year low and, despite occasional major incidents, the trends </p>
<p>remained downward. The declaration of transition to PIC in Anbar on 1 September had </p>
<p>been a “highly symbolic success”, as was Tawafuq’s return to government. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> “What went badly” included the stalling of Iraqi Army operations in Mosul because </p>
<p>of a lack of manpower. There had been a deterioration in relations between Governor </p>
<p>Wa’ili and the local Iraqi Army command in Basra. Clashes had narrowly been averted </p>
<p>between the ISF and the Peshmerga in Diyala, exacerbating Arab-Kurd tensions. </p>
<p>The US/Iraq SOFA negotiations had become deadlocked and were suspended until </p>
<p>mid-September. Reconstruction activity “showed little result” and service provision </p>
<p>across the country remained problematic. </p>
<p><b>185. </b> In Mr Prentice’s view, Iraq had not yet settled a national vision: although the </p>
<p>Council of Representatives had begun to enact some of the laws needed to frame the </p>
<p>national political and constitutional settlement, they had postponed the most difficult </p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> The Council of Representatives would now need to tackle a series of tough </p>
<p>legislative challenges including the passage of a SOFA, the Elections Law, the </p>
<p>Hydrocarbons Law and the 2009 Budget, in addition to the ongoing review of the </p>
<p>Constitution, all of which provided “ample scope for … political deadlock”. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Prentice concluded:</p>
<p>“It is against this background that work in Whitehall and here (Baghdad, Basra and </p>
<p>Erbil) will shortly be coming together on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our opening position for bilateral negotiations with the GoI [Government of </p>
<p>Iraq] on a legal base for our forces to stay in Iraq beyond 2008 to complete </p>
<p>their present tasks. I have advised already that this should be the least </p>
<p>challenging and demanding bid we can make.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>A longer term ‘Iraq Strategy’, setting out the rationale for the broad-based </p>
<p>relationship with the whole of Iraq, for which we are aiming post-transition. </p>
<p>There is strong appetite for this form of UK connection among many Iraqis, </p>
<p>in contrast to the (inevitable) irritations which have become associated with </p>
<p>our/the coalition’s long military presence. Iraq will be an enormously wealthy </p>
<p>country with huge needs and long-suppressed demand. The opportunities </p>
<p>for UK engagement in so many sectors – education, health, energy, services </p>
<p>– will be mouth-watering. And beyond the bilateral interest, there is the </p>
<p>strategic interest that the ‘New Iraq’ should develop as a pro-Western, </p>
<p>broadly democratic and secular regional power, exercising its influence </p>
<p>helpfully in world energy markets and acting as a link from Europe through </p>
<p>Turkey to the Gulf and not from revolutionary Iran through Syria to Hizballah.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We will also need to plan and fund the right long-term platform for HMG </p>
<p>in Iraq to take best advantage of these opportunities …”</p>
<p><b>188. </b> On 10 September, at the request of the FCO and the MOD, the JIC examined the </p>
<p>threat from the evolution of JAM.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>189. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. The surrender by Jaysh al-Mahdi of its strongholds in Basra, Sadr City and </p>
<p>al-Amara and damage to its reputation have left it in greater disarray and weaker </p>
<p>than at any time since 2003. </p>
<p>“II. The extent to which Muqtada al-Sadr will succeed in his attempt to transform </p>
<p>JAM into a primarily ‘cultural’ organisation is unclear. It will not mean a transition to </p>
<p>exclusively peaceful activity – Sadr’s model is Lebanese Hizballah and there is a risk </p>
<p>of at least some continuing intimidation to enforce strict Islamic codes.”</p>
<p><b>190. </b> The JIC considered that, although popular support for Muqtada al-Sadr and his </p>
<p>championship of the Shia poor remained strong, JAM’s standing had been undermined </p>
<p>in the past year by its involvement in criminality, Shia on Shia violence, collateral </p>
<p>damage to Karbala’s holy sites and mounting evidence of Iranian support. Its claim to </p>
<p>be a “defender of the Shia” was increasingly vulnerable, particularly following the severe </p>
<p>degradation of AQ-I.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“III. The majority of JAM members will continue to lie low and will not overtly </p>
<p>challenge Iraqi Security Force (ISF) control in the short term. Whether Sadr’s new </p>
<p>minority armed wing resumes attacks on Multi-National Forces (MNF) is likely to </p>

<p>413</p>
<p>depend on whether the coalition issues a timetable for withdrawal. A small minority </p>
<p>of other hard-liners will continue such attacks in any case …</p>
<p>“IV. In the longer term, JAM members are likely to remain a source of instability </p>
<p>through their recovery of criminal power and malign influence over Shia </p>
<p>communities, unless military pressure is maintained. There is also potential for </p>
<p>violence between the Sadrists and their Shia political rivals, especially as provincial </p>
<p>elections approach.</p>
<p>“V. Prime Minister Maliki … is likely to remain uncompromising towards any attempt </p>
<p>by JAM or the Special Groups to continue as a militia, and will repeat the recent </p>
<p>crackdown should they try to challenge his security gains.”</p>
<p><b>192. </b> The JIC assessed that Iran was adopting a “more discriminating approach” to the </p>
<p>provision of lethal aid to Shia militias, which it was likely to sustain at least until the MNF </p>
<p>had left Iraq.</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Lieutenant General Peter Wall, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), </p>
<p>updated the Iraq Strategy Group on 11 September on the emerging plan for UK military </p>
<p>drawdown and transition to US command in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> In summary, he said that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the end of November 2008, command of Maysan, Muthanna and Dhi Qar </p>
<p>provinces would transfer to an expanded MND(C), under US command.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the end of March 2009, command of Basra would transfer to a new </p>
<p>Basra based US division, MND(South), bringing UK forces there under </p>
<p>US command.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the start of May 2009, US forces would begin to deploy to Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By the end of June 2009, the UK’s departure would be complete.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr McDonald emphasised the need to protect this planning, particularly in the lead </p>
<p>up to the US elections, and highlighted the presentational problem if the US assumed </p>
<p>tasks that the UK was currently undertaking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>195. </b> Lt Gen Wall and Mr Day advised that “the US presence in the South would </p>
<p>probably not be engaged in the same tasks that we had been doing”. The US was likely </p>
<p>to focus more on border security and on protecting their main supply lines. </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr McDonald told the Group that no further statement by Mr Brown was planned </p>
<p>for 2008, although he would like to make one in early 2009. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>198. </b> On 12 September, an official from the FCO Iraq Group reported to Mr Miliband’s </p>
<p>Private Secretary that Ambassador Satterfield had visited London two days earlier and </p>
<p>provided UK officials in the FCO, the MOD and the Cabinet Office with an update on the </p>
<p>negotiation of the US/Iraq SOFA.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> Ambassador Satterfield had advised Washington that </p>
<p>agreement would not be possible without US compromise on three points: jurisdiction, </p>
<p>detention and timelines. To resolve those issues, he proposed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US military and non-diplomatic civilian personnel would be subject to Iraqi </p>
<p>jurisdiction if they committed a serious crime while off base and not on duty; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US forces would, in principle, hand over any detainees to the Iraqi authorities </p>
<p>within 24 hours.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Ambassador Satterfield reported that both the US and the Iraq governments had </p>
<p>agreed to a reference in the SOFA that US forces should withdraw from Iraq by 2011, </p>
<p>but the Iraqi Government was keen to have a more concrete commitment. </p>
<p><b>200. </b> The Iraq Group official advised Mr Miliband that Mr Browne shared US concerns </p>
<p>about jurisdiction. If the US compromised on this, the UK was unlikely to “get a better </p>
<p>deal”. One possible “fix” was to declare all UK forces “on duty” for the duration of their </p>
<p>deployment to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>201. </b> From 15 to 16 September, ACM Stirrup visited Iraq and Kuwait.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> He asked </p>
<p>General Raymond Odierno, Commanding General Multi-National Force – Iraq, whether </p>
<p>he was content with the plans for MND(SE) transition, reporting that Gen Odierno had </p>
<p>been “encouraged” and “comfortable” with the outline proposal though he had yet to see </p>
<p>the detailed timeline. ACM Stirrup “underlined his need to bolster enablers in Afghanistan </p>
<p>as soon as possible” though made clear that any Iraqi transition plan would need to </p>
<p>meet “mutual timeline requirements”.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Browne met the Chiefs of Staff and Sir Bill Jeffrey, MOD </p>
<p>Permanent Under Secretary, on 18 September.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> ACM Stirrup reported that “remarkable </p>
<p>progress” had been made in Iraq over the past 18 months, although it was “fragile and </p>
<p>reversible”. In the South, the biggest risk was stalled economic progress. ACM Stirrup </p>
<p>reported that the US commanders had high regard for the UK contribution in Basra and </p>
<p>elsewhere in Iraq and were “bought in” to a timetable that would see “two-star UK/US </p>
<p>handover in March and one-star in May”. SOFA negotiations were “stalled”. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> Mr Brown said that it would be important to have projects that helped with </p>

<p>climate. He would raise again with President Bush UK concerns about the SOFA, </p>
<p>including “the real risk we would run out of time”.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> On 18 September, at the request of the MOD and PJHQ, the JIC circulated its </p>
<p>Assessment of the prospects for security across southern Iraq into 2009.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>205. </b> The JIC judged that overall security had improved significantly since the Charge of </p>
<p>the Knights operation against JAM in March. The authority of the Iraqi Government now </p>
<p>extended into previously “no-go” areas. There were reports of improved perceptions of </p>
<p>general security among Basrawis, and instances of violent criminality and score-settling </p>
<p>were reported to have fallen. There had only been three attacks on the MNF at Basra Air </p>
<p>Base in the previous six weeks. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> The JIC assessed that security gains in Maysan had been more limited in scope </p>
<p>and restricted to al-Amara. Security in Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces remained </p>
<p>“less of a challenge for local security forces”.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The JIC had recently assessed that JAM was “in greater disarray and weaker than </p>
<p>at any time since 2003”, but a threat remained:</p>
<p>“II. … Whether Sadr’s planned small armed wing resumes attacks on Multi-National </p>
<p>Forces (MNF) is likely to depend on whether the coalition agrees a timetable for </p>
<p>withdrawal … A few other hard-liners will continue such attacks in any case. In the </p>
<p>longer term, violent criminality, murders, kidnappings, score-settling and intimidation </p>
<p>may gradually increase again.</p>
<p>“III. The Iranian-backed Special Groups … are likely to be better trained and </p>
<p>equipped and focused on attacking US forces as they return from Iran. They and </p>
<p>a number of smaller Shia militias will probably also see attacks on withdrawing UK </p>
<p>forces as an opportunity to claim victory over the coalition (albeit that US forces will </p>
<p>take their place). But anti-MNF attacks are unlikely to reach anywhere near the peak </p>
<p>seen in 2007.”</p>
<p><b>208. </b> Looking to the future, JIC continued:</p>
<p>“IV. Locally raised army units in the South will continue to need coalition mentors </p>
<p>and to operate alongside more experienced Iraqi forces to manage security for the </p>
<p>rest of this year. By early 2009, provided JAM remains quiescent, they will be able </p>
<p>to cope with only limited MNF mentoring. Intra-Shia clashes are likely to intensify </p>
<p>as provincial elections approach …</p>
<p>“V. Further growth in the local economy is probable in 2009. But significant </p>
<p>economic improvement depends on security, sustained political support and a major </p>
<p>improvement in government ability to implement reconstruction and development </p>
<p>projects. All are likely to remain uncertain for some years …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p><b>209. </b> On 21 September, Major General Andrew Salmon, who had succeeded </p>
<p>Maj Gen White-Spunner as GOC MND(SE) in August, reported that Gen Odierno </p>
<p>had assumed command of MNF-I “with a clear focus on putting ISF into the lead”.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gen Odierno had informed Prime Minister Maliki that the US would be “positioning </p>
<p>elements in Basra next year”.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Maj Gen Salmon also reported that MND(SE) had been:</p>
<p>“… considering what being without a SOFA on 1 Jan means, either because we </p>
<p>won’t get one, or because one hasn’t quite been finalised and we’re in limbo. There </p>
<p>are probably various legal interpretations as to where we will stand in the latter case, </p>
<p>so it might be useful to have some policy views in due course on the limbo scenario.”</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Brown met President Bush at the White House on 26 September.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> In a report </p>
<p>of the meeting, Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary recorded that a formula had </p>
<p>been developed for the SOFA to cover when US service personnel would be subject to </p>
<p>Iraqi jurisdiction. It meant that “in practice it was extremely unlikely that these conditions </p>
<p>would ever be met”. Mr Brown emphasised that a SOFA needed to be agreed by the </p>
<p>end of December. He told President Bush that in July Prime Minister Maliki had said he </p>
<p>wanted the UK out of Iraq. Mr Brown had responded that the UK would stay. </p>
<p><b>212. </b> An MOD note in the No.10 files entitled “Southern Iraq Force Levels”, dating from </p>
<p>late September 2008, set out “as requested” the options “to reduce the overall size of </p>
<p>the force to c.1,900 as part of the November 2008 rotation”.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>213. </b> The note explained that under current plans there would be 4,148 UK ground </p>
<p>troops in southern Iraq until November. In October, it was expected that the number of </p>
<p>support roles (engineers) could be reduced by 200, bringing the total to around 3,950. </p>
<p><b>214. </b> The note continued:</p>
<p>“Our analysis shows that we could not achieve the required level of reduction </p>
<p>through pro rata cuts across the force.”</p>
<p>As a consequence:</p>
<p>“The only alternative is to give up some of the tasks we currently undertake. </p>
<p>In practice, that means transferring responsibilities to the US. We have identified </p>
<p>two options for achieving a reduction to around 1900 posts. Both would make us </p>
<p>very much the junior partner in MND(SE) and in these circumstances we assume </p>
<p>that the US would take over command of the division … The options are (a) transfer </p>

<p>“Both options carry major disadvantages. Neither would be at all attractive to the US. </p>
<p>We would be asking them to make a substantial additional investment in southern </p>
<p>Iraq … We could not present a coherent military rationale for either alternative …”</p>
<p><b>215. </b> The author advised that the longer term damage to the UK’s military, defence and </p>
<p>security reputation and interests in the US would be “considerable” because:</p>
<p>“Both Washington and General Petraeus believe they have a commitment from us </p>
<p>that we will stay the course until 14 Division has been fully trained. These options </p>
<p>require the US to share the burden and will be seen as the UK reneging on a deal …</p>
<p>“There would be similar reputational consequences in Iraq and regionally. </p>
<p>Domestically we could not present a credible military case for the reduction nor </p>
<p>argue that it is conditions-based. Our contribution would be portrayed as a token sop </p>
<p>and would be especially difficult to explain if we began to take casualties. We should </p>
<p>expect an adverse and long-lasting impact on morale across Defence. Option (b), </p>
<p>which would involve UK forces withdrawing into the COB while US troops took over </p>
<p>our tasks in Basra, would be especially toxic to the Army’s morale and reputation.”</p>

<p>Mr Brown stressed the importance of ensuring that Gen Petraeus understood that the </p>
<p>UK’s plans for drawdown in Iraq had Mr Brown’s backing, and were not just contingent </p>
<p>military planning. It was equally important that Gen Petraeus realised that “UK drawdown </p>
<p>in Iraq will not translate to a scaling-up in Afghanistan”. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> In their discussion, Gen Petraeus paid tribute to UK forces in Iraq: work to </p>
<p>capitalise on operations in Basra, Baghdad and mentoring the Iraqi headquarters had </p>
<p>all been “superb”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>418</p>
<p>warned that if the legal basis for their presence was not resolved by the end of the year, </p>
<p>British troops would have to leave. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> The “accommodation” reached with JAM was, in Prime Minister Maliki’s view, a </p>
<p>“disaster”. <i>The Times</i> observed that “Iraq’s Prime Minister appears to have decided that, </p>
<p>at a critical juncture, British Forces put their own security ahead of Basra’s”. </p>
<p><b>220. </b> Mr Ian Forber, Head of the MOD Iraq Policy Team, briefed the Iraq Strategy Group </p>
<p>on 15 October that the US had given its SOFA text to Prime Minister Maliki, “who had </p>
<p>apparently agreed it”.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> The next steps were for the Council of Ministers and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Parliament to consider it. The MOD and FCO view was that the US text would be </p>
<p>sufficient for the UK’s needs. MOD officials would advise the Defence Secretary that the </p>
<p>UK should pursue its own legal arrangements based closely on the US text, and that he </p>
<p>should tell Prime Minister Maliki that when visiting Baghdad on 19 October. </p>
<p><b>221. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group also discussed alternative scenarios in case the UK did </p>
<p>not conclude its own legal agreement. Contingency planning for withdrawal was in place </p>
<p>and it could be done within three months. Mr Forber told the Group that there was legal </p>
<p>provision under Coalition Provisional Authority Order No.17 which was still in force. If </p>
<p>withdrawal did happen, early discussions would be needed with the US to give them </p>
<p>“time to back-fill”. </p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr McDonald commented that the option of a further resolution had not been ruled </p>
<p>out, though would be difficult. The Group tasked the MOD and the FCO to produce a </p>
<p>negotiating timetable and a public and diplomatic handling plan. </p>
<p><b>223. </b> Mr Forber and his deputy also updated the Group on planning for transition, </p>
<p>which was taking place against a range of scenarios. Plans had been co-ordinated with </p>
<p>the US:</p>
<p>“In particular, including their plans to backfill us as we drawdown and, if we were </p>
<p>forced to withdraw earlier, a plan for them to backfill more rapidly, also covering what </p>
<p>assistance we would need from the US to withdraw.”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> A day later, Mr Prentice reported from Baghdad that negotiations on a US/Iraq </p>
<p>SOFA had entered their “endgame”, meaning that the UK could “finally launch our </p>
<p>own bid for a bilateral agreement”.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> Although the UK’s objective of a broader bilateral </p>
<p>relationship was consistent with Prime Minister Maliki’s own aims, Mr Prentice observed </p>
<p>that “he remains deeply suspicious of us and feels politically besieged”. Those factors, </p>
<p>plus a tight deadline, made the UK/Iraq agreement “a difficult trick to take”. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>226. </b> In mid-October, a Cabinet Office official wrote to Mr Brown’s Private Secretary for </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs with advice on a visit to Iraq, potentially including downtown Basra, being </p>
<p>contemplated by Mr Brown.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> He advised that such a visit “would present a number of </p>
<p>difficult security issues, with presentational implications”. The official continued:</p>
<p>“The security situation in Basra has improved considerably over the past 12 months. </p>
<p>But it is far from being inherently safe. Members of the JAM Special Groups are </p>
<p>returning to Iraq from Iran and Syria and there are continuing reports of a return </p>
<p>to violence, including assassination. And although the operating environment for </p>
<p>militants and terrorists in Basra is difficult, it is by no means impossible … Moreover, </p>
<p>there remain corrupt elements in the Iraqi police, many affiliated to JAM, for whom </p>
<p>the Prime Minister would be an attractive target …</p>
<p>“<b>Against this background, we advise against any visit by the Prime Minister to </b></p>
<p><b>downtown Basra at this stage</b>. If such a visit was to be contemplated there would </p>
<p>need to be a significant security operation to ensure the Prime Minister’s safety. </p>
<p>This in turn would raise presentational difficulties as the security precautions that </p>
<p>would be necessary would not be consistent with a return to normality.”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary advised Mr Brown that:</p>
<p>“Whilst there is progress, there is no new policy announcement to add to your </p>
<p>July statement … A timetable and numbers for drawdown would be new and MOD </p>
<p>have planning figures – but (a) any plans depend on an agreed SOFA or UNSCR </p>
<p>rollover first (b) there may be a spike in violence after the elections (c) MOD </p>
<p>have operational security concerns about releasing our timetable – they argue </p>
<p>it encourages increasing attacks on UK troops so that militias can claim success </p>
<p>for driving UK out.”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>228. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary further advised that visiting Basra before the </p>
<p>US elections in early November risked annoying Prime Minister Maliki at a time when </p>
<p>the UK SOFA was still being negotiated. </p>
<p><b>229. </b> Although Mr Brown deferred his proposed visit, Mr John Hutton, who had </p>
<p>succeeded Mr Browne as Defence Secretary on 3 October, visited Iraq in mid October.</p>

<p>In a letter reporting his visit, Mr Hutton told Mr Brown that in Basra he had: </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>230. </b> Behind this optimism sat a “confident and capable” Iraqi Army with “complete </p>
<p>freedom of movement throughout the city”, meaning that “we will soon have reached the </p>
<p>point where we can say with confidence that we have fulfilled our training mission for </p>
<p>14 Division”. </p>
<p><b>231. </b> During his visit, Mr Hutton confirmed with Gen Odierno that he was fully content </p>
<p>with plans to draw down the vast majority of UK troops by mid 2009, adding that: </p>
<p>“The phased movement south of additional US forces will help to ensure that the </p>
<p>withdrawal of our own combat troops is as seamless as possible. He [Gen Odierno] </p>
<p>is alive to the presentational risks and will, I am sure, speak positively about our </p>
<p>contribution.”</p>
<p><b>232. </b> Mr Hutton reported that Prime Minister Maliki had told him that he wanted to </p>
<p>build a strong, broad-based relationship with the UK and was keen to start bilateral </p>
<p>discussions on the UK SOFA as soon as possible to ensure that an agreement was in </p>
<p>place by the end of the year. </p>
<p><b>233. </b> Ambassador Crocker and Ambassador Satterfield were more downbeat, and </p>
<p>saw significant difficulties ahead. Mr Hutton explained that the UK had decided that </p>
<p>before pursuing the UK SOFA he would await formal agreement from the Council of </p>
<p>Representatives of the US/Iraq SOFA, on which it was largely based. </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Hutton concluded:</p>
<p>“Should the UK fail to secure a SOFA or a UNSCR extension, the operational </p>
<p>and presentational risks associated with a hasty exit would be severe indeed … </p>
<p>We will need to watch this very closely, and to use any and all diplomatic means </p>
<p>at our disposal to reach an agreement as early as possible.”</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The MND(SE) weekly letter on 26 October said that Gen Mohammed and </p>
<p>Governor Wa’ili had agreed to meet for the first time (having previously refused to </p>
<p>do so), paving the way for co-operation on security issues ahead of the forthcoming </p>
<p>provincial elections.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The letter also described a visit by the MNF-I Joint Campaign Plan Assessment </p>
<p>Team, “not one but two multi-disciplinary teams” headed by a retired General and a </p>
<p>former Ambassador and featuring “a broad cross-section of diplomats, academics </p>
<p>and advisors”. Gen Odierno had tasked the team “to make an independent campaign </p>
<p>assessment to inform the rewrite of the Joint Campaign Plan”.</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Hutton reported to Cabinet on 28 October that the security situation in Iraq had </p>
<p>been “completely transformed and continued to improve”.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> The MNF had had significant </p>
<p>successes in disrupting and destroying AQ-I leadership. The UK would hand over Basra </p>

<p>International Airport by the end of the year and was “on track” for a fundamental change </p>
<p>of mission next year. The US had submitted the final text of its proposed SOFA though </p>
<p>it was unclear whether or not the Iraqi Government would agree it. </p>
<p><b>238. </b> Mr Hutton added that UKTI was about to establish a presence in Baghdad, but </p>
<p>there was a need to consider what more could be done. Some commentators were </p>
<p>suggesting that Basra had more potential for development as a regional centre, yet there </p>
<p>were no British companies active in southern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>239. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Brown said that further consideration would need </p>
<p>to be given to building economic links with Iraq.</p>

<p>On 4 November, Mr Barack Obama was elected as the 44th President of the United </p>

<p>89</p>
<p> Mr Brown spoke of the strength of US/UK </p>
<p>common purpose in Iraq – success would not be achieved by military means alone.</p>
<p><b>240. </b> In an Assessment issued on 6 November, the JIC examined the impact of the </p>
<p>centralisation of power under Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“Though [Prime Minister Maliki] continues to operate broadly within a constitutional </p>
<p>democratic framework, he has brought about greater centralisation of power.</p>
<p>“Maliki’s … approach is driven by … suspicion of political rivals and his perception </p>
<p>that centralising power is essential to getting things done in stabilising Iraq …</p>
<p>“Constraints on Maliki … include the judiciary; the Shia religious authorities; </p>
<p>parliament; his desire to share responsibility as broadly as possible for more </p>
<p>controversial decisions …</p>
<p>“… Maliki’s political rivals remain unwilling and probably unable at this stage to </p>
<p>unseat him … </p>
<p>“Maliki remains highly suspicious of HMG’s intentions in Iraq. He wants to restrict the </p>
<p>future UK military presence to no more than a small number of training staff beyond </p>
<p>the end of this year. Maliki will continue trying to maintain relationships with Iran and </p>
<p>the US, but the influence of both over him will decline further throughout 2009.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>241. </b> The Iraq Senior Officials Group met on 7 November.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> Mr Forber and Mr Baker </p>
<p>gave updates on the Status of Forces Agreement negotiations and the parallel US </p>
<p>negotiation. Ms Aldred emphasised the importance of recommendations to Ministers </p>
<p>being placed in the current political context, in particular what the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>wanted and the information in the recent JIC Assessment. The Cabinet Office would </p>
<p>draft an overarching context paper for NSID(OD). </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Forber reported that the Iraqi Government said that it was willing to agree </p>
<p>a SOFA with the UK “providing it did not include combat elements”; it was not clear </p>
<p>whether that was a firm position or a negotiating tactic. The MOD and the FCO argued </p>
<p>for an increase in pressure on the Iraqi Government to persuade them to accept that </p>
<p>the UK needed combat troops for a short while into 2009. US support would be crucial. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Ms Aldred reported a discussion with Gen Lute about the agreement between </p>
<p>President Bush and Mr Brown on the timetable for UK drawdown, and the possible need </p>
<p>for US help to agree a SOFA.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The Iraq Senior Officials Group also discussed a draft post-drawdown strategy, </p>
<p>particularly the UK’s energy and commercial objectives and the proposed FCO, DFID, </p>
<p>MOD and military presence. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> On energy, the Group agreed that the Department for Energy and Climate Change </p>
<p>and the FCO should develop a “coherent and detailed” strategy for Iraq, including what </p>
<p>sort of presence would be needed to deliver it. DFID were to consider further:</p>
<p>“… whether a presence only in Baghdad supported by a communications strategy </p>
<p>and programme funding in the South, would be sufficient to sustain our legacy there, </p>
<p>protect our reputation and ensure the US did not win credit for progress that we had </p>
<p>engineered.”</p>
<p><b>246. </b> On 12 November, Mr Prentice reported a “highly successful” visit to Iraq by </p>
<p>Mr Alexander the previous week.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Mr Alexander met Prime Minister Maliki and </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker and attended the launch of the Basra Investment Commission </p>
<p>(see Section 10.2). </p>
<p><b>247. </b> Prime Minister Maliki “continued to insist that the UK had done little for Basra” but </p>
<p>he welcomed Mr Alexander’s assurances that the UK wanted to move towards a more </p>
<p>normalised bilateral relationship, including closer economic, cultural and educational </p>
<p>links. They discussed the SOFA, “the success of which would be a fundamental first step </p>
<p>in the transition both governments were looking for”.</p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>423</p>
<p><b>248. </b> In an update on Iraq for Mr Brown on 14 November, Cabinet Office officials </p>
<p>reported that Prime Minister Maliki remained reluctant to agree to the continuing UK </p>
<p>combat role that the MOD judged essential for training 14 Division.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Although the US SOFA text had reportedly been agreed between Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki and President Bush, it had yet to be approved by the Iraqi Parliament, suggesting </p>
<p>that: “By December, the US may still be trying to get its SOFA while warming-up the UN </p>
<p>Security Council Resolution track.” US lobbying on the UK’s behalf was unlikely while its </p>
<p>own negotiations remained difficult. </p>
<p><b>250. </b> More positively, the security situation remained “promising”, 14 Division was </p>
<p>“operating increasingly independently”, Basra Airport would be ready to hand over </p>
<p>“within weeks”, the Iraqi Electoral Commission had announced that provincial elections </p>
<p>would be held on 31 January 2009 and Mr Alexander had announced the Basra </p>
<p>Investment Commission ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><b>251. </b> The update also said that, although AQ-I continued to pose a threat in Iraq, Basra </p>
<p>remained calm, with no attacks on the UK Base for more than 40 days. That was “the </p>
<p>longest unbroken period of calm since January 2006”. </p>
<p><b>252. </b> On 16 November, the BBC reported that the Iraqi Cabinet had approved a “security </p>
<p>pact” with the US, under which its troops would withdraw from the streets of Iraqi towns </p>
<p>in 2009 and leave Iraq by the end of 2011.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> An Iraqi Government spokesman also said </p>
<p>that the agreement placed US forces under the authority of the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>that they would need its permission, and that of a Judge, to raid homes. US forces would </p>
<p>also hand over their bases to Iraq during 2009. </p>
<p><b>253. </b> In a televised statement on the agreement, Prime Minister Maliki explained that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government had “reservations” about the agreement, but saw it as “a solid prelude </p>
<p>to the restoration of Iraq’s full sovereignty in three years’ time”.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>254. </b> Maj Gen Salmon reported on 23 November that a call by Muqtada al Sadr at Friday </p>
<p>prayers for “increased opposition” to the SOFA had been “ignored”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> There had instead </p>
<p>been a “pro-SOFA demonstration”.</p>
<p><b>255. </b> In Baghdad, however, the BBC reported that “thousands of people” had responded </p>
<p>to al-Sadr’s call and protested in Firdous Square.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>256. </b> On 24 November, Lt Gen Cooper reported to ACM Stirrup that the “only political </p>
<p>game in Baghdad at the moment is that surrounding the US SOFA”.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> The progress </p>
<p>of the SOFA through the Council of Representatives had been “colourful” but it would </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>424</p>
<p>be put to the vote on 26 November. If unsuccessful, the US was expected to press </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki to take forward renewal of the Security Council resolution. </p>
<p><b>257. </b> Lt Gen Cooper had recently discussed the UK SOFA with Gen Odierno, who had </p>
<p>agreed to raise the UK agreement with Prime Minister Maliki if the US equivalent was </p>
<p>agreed by Parliament. This was “a one shot weapon” and Lt Gen Cooper advised that </p>
<p>“we need to hold our nerve and let him judge the moment”. </p>
<p><b>258. </b> On 28 November, Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary wrote to Mr McDonald </p>
<p>to record a discussion with Mr Brown on the UK/Iraq SOFA two days previously.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> In the </p>
<p>discussion, those present had “noted that the US SOFA was being considered by the </p>
<p>Council of Representatives”. Before the note was circulated, the US SOFA had passed. </p>
<p>Attention was now expected to turn to the UK SOFA. </p>
<p><b>259. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary reported that Mr Brown said he had been clear </p>
<p>with Prime Minister Maliki that the UK would not leave until the job was done, but he </p>
<p>thought that Prime Minister Maliki wanted a fixed end point in the SOFA. Mr Brown </p>
<p>directed that Mr McDonald should visit Prime Minister Maliki on his behalf and “negotiate </p>
<p>a SOFA with combat authorities – initially offering May, but with a fall-back to March if </p>
<p>necessary”.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> In an update on Afghanistan and Iraq on 28 November, Cabinet Office officials told </p>
<p>Mr Brown that the Iraqi Parliament had approved the US SOFA the previous day, but had </p>
<p>also ordered a referendum on it by the end of July 2009.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> If the Agreement was voted </p>
<p>down, the US would have 12 months to leave Iraq. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> It was looking increasingly unlikely that the UK SOFA would be agreed before </p>
<p>the Iraqi Parliament rose on 22 December. That left a risk that the UK would need </p>
<p>to suspend combat operations from the end of 2008 until a SOFA was approved. </p>
<p>Mr McDonald was scheduled to meet Prime Minister Maliki on 1 or 2 December. </p>
<p><b>262. </b> The update also recorded that “Basra remains calm and stable, with no attacks </p>
<p>on UK forces for seven weeks”. </p>
<p><b>December 2008</b></p>
<p><b>263. </b> On 1 December, Lt Gen Cooper reported to ACM Stirrup that he had spoken once </p>
<p>again to Gen Odierno about the UK SOFA.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> Gen Odierno planned to raise the issue </p>
<p>with Prime Minister Maliki that evening if the moment was right. Mr McDonald would </p>
<p>meet Gen Odierno beforehand, and then see Prime Minister Maliki the following day. </p>

<p><b>264. </b> Mr Brown met ACM Stirrup on 4 December for a “personal and confidential” </p>
<p>discussion.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> On Iraq, Mr Brown said that it looked as though Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>would accept a legal agreement that included fixed dates for the withdrawal of UK </p>
<p>troops. It would be important for the UK to show that the withdrawal was happening </p>
<p>because the UK had completed all the tasks it had set out. A “last push” on economic </p>
<p>development was needed, along with a communications plan for the next few weeks. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> ACM Stirrup said that he hoped there would be cross-party support for a message </p>
<p>of UK success. Although it was “never the intention to have transformed Basra”, </p>
<p>nonetheless “we would have got it to the starting point”. UK troop numbers would </p>
<p>reduce significantly in June, with the US brigade combat team arriving in May to “do their </p>
<p>own tasks”. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> Reporting his visit to Iraq to the Iraq; Strategy Group on 5 December, Mr McDonald </p>
<p>said that Prime Minster Maliki had agreed combat authorisations to enable UK forces </p>
<p>to complete the training of 14 Division and to continue naval operations in the northern </p>
<p>Gulf.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> Rather than putting a legal agreement to the Council of Representatives, there </p>
<p>would be an exchange of letters between the two Governments. He added that:</p>
<p>“The imminent declaration by the Attorney General that a state of Internal Armed </p>
<p>Conflict in Iraq continued to exist would be necessary to underpin the legal basis.”</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Mr McDonald described three possible scenarios, all of which NSID(OD) would </p>
<p>need to consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An exchange of letters with the Iraqi Government, providing a legal basis for </p>
<p>combat operations, but not as robust as a full SOFA. Ministers would need to </p>
<p>decide if they were content with this. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Political agreement with the Iraqi Government, with an uncertain legal basis. </p>
<p>The UK would have to consider what it could still do, relying on the right to </p>
<p>self defence. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No agreement reached, meaning transition to a “normal bilateral relationship” </p>
<p>from January 2009. </p>
<p><b>268. </b> NSID(OD) discussed Iraq on 9 December 2008.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>269. </b> Papers provided for the meeting included ‘Iraq: Arrangements for Transition’.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The paper recounted Mr McDonald’s scenarios and Ministers were invited to consider </p>
<p>“the implications of the three scenarios for the UK’s reputation, and what the Armed </p>
<p>Forces would be able to do in each”. If no legal agreement was achieved, Ministers were </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>asked to consider whether a political agreement would be sufficient or whether the UK </p>
<p>should move on 1 January 2009 to a “normal” bilateral relationship with Iraq.</p>
<p><b>270. </b> The implications of the second scenario (a political agreement) were that the UK </p>
<p>would have to “adjust” its force posture and halt activities supporting combat operations. </p>
<p>Since UK forces would only be able to carry out advisory tasks, “the US would have to </p>
<p>complete much of our mission in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> If no agreement was secured (the third scenario), UK forces would have to “leave </p>
<p>as quickly as possible”, causing reputational damage for the Army in particular. </p>
<p><b>272. </b> Since Mr McDonald’s discussion with Prime Minister Maliki, the paper explained </p>
<p>that continued negotiations had produced a proposal for:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a short draft law to the CoR [Council of Representatives] with: authorisation for </p>
<p>UK (and Australian) forces to remain in Iraq until 31 July 2009 and exemption </p>
<p>from Iraqi jurisdiction for those forces; and a statement that Maliki shall set the </p>
<p>necessary arrangements for the tasks and missions of these forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>complement this law with a (non-legally binding) EoL [Exchange of Letters] </p>
<p>between governments enshrining the tasks.”</p>
<p><b>273. </b> This proposal looked “acceptable from a legal perspective” but carried “some </p>
<p>political risk”, specifically that Prime Minister Maliki might leave the legislation “to its own </p>
<p>fate” in the Iraqi Council of Representatives. </p>
<p><b>274. </b> An annex to the paper suggested that the key elements of future relations with Iraq </p>
<p>should be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>diplomatic and political activity – lobbying and influencing in support of the full </p>
<p>range of UK activities, encouraging Iraq’s political development and the usual </p>
<p>migration and consular activities conducted by an Embassy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic development – influencing Iraqi economic policy and supporting </p>
<p>further capacity building on public finance management, investment, trade and </p>
<p>higher education;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>defence – continued support for the coalition Naval Training Team, capacity </p>
<p>building within the Iraqi Ministry of Defence, and Royal Naval and Royal Air </p>
<p>Force participation in coalition maritime and air operations in Iraq and in the </p>
<p>Northern Arabian Gulf;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>energy – ensuring the security of Iraq’s oil supply and long-term increase in </p>
<p>oil output;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>commercial – support for trade missions, UK investor visits and political lobbying </p>
<p>to ensure a level playing field for UK exporters and investors; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>education – increased collaboration with Iraqi educational institutions, civil </p>
<p>society, student exchanges and English language training.</p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>427</p>
<p><b>275. </b> The paper invited Ministers to agree that Mr Miliband should circulate detailed </p>
<p>proposals on the UK’s future relations with Iraq, for agreement in writing.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> At the NSID(OD) meeting, Mr Brown outlined “strong progress” on the UK’s four </p>
<p>key tasks (training the Iraqi Army, promoting economic development, readying Basra </p>
<p>Airport for transfer to Iraqi control and preparing for provincial elections).</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> He told those </p>
<p>present that he would visit Iraq on 17 December. </p>
<p><b>277. </b> In discussion of the future legal basis for military activity in Iraq, it was observed </p>
<p>that it was vital to avoid any risk of UK troops facing Iraqi jurisdiction; without a legally </p>
<p>binding agreement the UK would not be able to complete its tasks. </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Brown concluded that the UK should keep up the </p>
<p>pressure on Prime Minister Maliki and his advisers to “see the proposed agreement </p>
<p>through” before his visit. Planning should proceed on the current proposed timescale, </p>
<p>for now. If a legal agreement looked unlikely before the Prime Minister’s planned visit </p>
<p>“we should re-consider our options then”. </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Brown also concluded that more should be done to improve economic </p>
<p>development and prospects for investment, including with Ministries in Baghdad, </p>
<p>and that it was also important to make progress on the Hydrocarbons Law (see </p>
<p>Section 10.3).</p>
<p><b>280. </b> Ministers agreed that sign off for the UK’s long term strategy for Iraq would be </p>
<p>sought out of committee.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> The following day, Mr Prentice wrote to Prime Minister Maliki’s Adviser on Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs, attaching “a draft of the Exchange of Letters recording the tasks to be completed </p>
<p>by the UK forces and the timeframe agreed with Prime Minister Maliki last week for their </p>
<p>withdrawal from Iraq”.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> The letters assumed that the Iraqi Government would submit </p>
<p>a “short law” to the Council of Representatives on 16 December, to give UK forces </p>
<p>“the necessary jurisdictional protections”. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Gen Dannatt visited Iraq from 13 to 15 December and reported to ACM Stirrup that </p>
<p>Basra was:</p>
<p>“… marked by a sense of great optimism: attacks are now the exception rather </p>
<p>than the rule; the Iraqi security forces are demonstrating impressive, albeit nascent, </p>
<p>ability. And there are early signs of a bustling city attempting to return to normality.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>283. </b> However, that positive assessment was tempered by concern about the state of </p>
<p>the economy:</p>
<p>“… scratch the surface and the scale of the challenges that lie ahead becomes </p>
<p>apparent … the issues raised by the locals I spoke to cause me some concern: </p>
<p>jobs, electricity, rubbish and jobs again – I see only limited progress in any of </p>
<p>these areas. We must do all that we can to generate employment and encourage </p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours to invest in the potentially rich South. We must not over-sell the </p>
<p>outstanding work that has been done.”</p>
<p><b>284. </b> Looking to the longer term, Gen Dannatt reported that he did not support any </p>
<p>residual Army commitment in the South of Iraq once UK troops had been extracted. </p>
<p>Rather, the Army should plan to provide the lead for the NATO training mission in </p>
<p>Baghdad, “though I am not convinced we fully understand the potential totality of this </p>
<p>task, particularly in terms of FP [force protection] and life support”. </p>
<p><b>285. </b> Gen Odierno had been “generous enough to suggest” that, once the US merged </p>
<p>the MNF-I, MNC-I and MNSTC-I commands in early 2010, the UK should provide one </p>
<p>of the three-star Deputy Commander posts. Gen Dannatt’s view, given the UK’s overall </p>
<p>commitment and the focus of the training mission, was that a two-star post would be </p>
<p>more appropriate. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> Mr Brown told Cabinet on 16 December that, following delicate discussions, the </p>
<p>UK had agreed with Prime Minister Maliki arrangements that would give legal protection </p>
<p>for UK troops in Iraq after the expiry of resolution 1790 at the end of the year.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> The law </p>
<p>would be put to the Council of Representatives shortly. </p>
<p><b>287. </b> Mr Brown noted progress on the four key tasks – training Iraqi forces, restoring </p>
<p>local government, handing over Basra international airport and economic development. </p>
<p>He urged further efforts over the next few months to complete these tasks and allow the </p>
<p>drawdown of troops to begin in May, a timetable agreed with the Iraqi Government that </p>
<p>suited UK forces. The UK would leave Iraq “with pride, having successfully completed </p>
<p>our tasks”. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> In discussion, members of Cabinet observed that although negotiations were not </p>
<p>complete, the “risk of premature departure” was reduced. ACM Stirrup had advised that </p>
<p>the outcome was “acceptable, if not perfect”. </p>
<p><b>289. </b> Mr Hutton wrote to Mr Brown on 16 December to report that the MOD and FCO </p>
<p>team in Baghdad had finalised negotiations with its Iraqi counterparts on a draft law </p>
<p>providing UK forces with the necessary jurisdictional immunities, and was nearing </p>
<p>agreement on a Government to Government Exchange of Letters.</p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>429</p>
<p><b>290. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were content that these provisions “but no less” were sufficient </p>
<p>to allow the UK military to complete its tasks. Mr Hutton and ACM Stirrup therefore </p>
<p>recommended that Mr Brown agree with Prime Minister Maliki that UK forces should </p>
<p>complete their mission in Iraq on that basis. The MOD would need to review the position </p>
<p>if the text of the draft law changed as it proceeded through the Iraqi Parliament.</p>
<p><b>291. </b> The draft law on immunities meant that UK forces were exempt from Iraqi </p>
<p>justice unless they committed a crime “off-base and with intent or as a result of gross </p>
<p>negligence”. Anyone captured by this would remain in UK custody. This was:</p>
<p>“… less than the US have secured through their Status of Forces Agreement, but </p>
<p>UK forces are not doing the same range of tasks, are far fewer in number and, on </p>
<p>current plans, will complete our key tasks and withdraw the vast majority of troops </p>
<p>by 31 July 2009.”</p>
<p><b>292. </b> The accompanying Exchange of Letters constituted an “invitation” from the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq to complete the UK tasks.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> The two main remaining risks were that the Iraqi Parliament amended or failed to </p>
<p>pass the law, or that it was not ratified by 1 January 2009. However, Mr Hutton wrote </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“… the Iraqi Council of Ministers voted today to agree the legal text and have </p>
<p>passed it to the Council of Representatives … The draft law is expected to have its </p>
<p>first reading on 17 December. There is still a chance therefore, if there are no further </p>
<p>delays, that it will pass its third Reading on 22 December and be ratified by the </p>
<p>Presidency Council no later than 10 days afterwards.”</p>
<p><b>294. </b> Mr Brown spoke by telephone to President Bush on 16 December.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> He explained </p>
<p>that the UK had almost agreed the legal arrangements for a continued UK military </p>
<p>presence in Iraq in 2009 and that he was grateful for US support.</p>
<p><b>295. </b> At its 17 December meeting, the JIC assessed the performance of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>296. </b> The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“I. Major security decisions are driven by Prime Minister Maliki … But his </p>
<p>circumvention of over-bureaucratic processes has furthered rather than hampered </p>
<p>the overall improvement in security.”</p>
<p><b>297. </b> The JIC judged that the ISF would be “much better placed to manage internal </p>
<p>security in 2009, including during elections, but will be unable wholly to prevent </p>

<p>intimidation of the electorate or political assassinations”. The ISF’s ability to maintain </p>
<p>security after the MNF’s departure would depend on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued improvements in capabilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>loyalty to the state;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>299. </b> Mr Brown visited Baghdad and Basra on 17 December accompanied by ACM </p>
<p>Stirrup.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> During the trip Mr Peter Watkins, MOD Director General Operational Policy, </p>
<p>briefed Mr Brown on the latest security agreement developments. ACM Stirrup’s Military </p>
<p>Adviser reported that he had been “clear that the final text had to ensure that ‘our people </p>
<p>must not be subject to legal proceedings in Iraq’” and was “<i>adamant</i> that ‘we must have </p>
<p>written legal confirmation for the spectrum of … operations’”. Mr Watkins was fairly </p>
<p>confident that the law would complete its third reading by 30 December. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Brown met Prime Minister Maliki in Baghdad on 17 December.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> He confirmed </p>
<p>that the UK wanted to “finish the tasks we had set” and to “see Iraq in full control”. </p>
<p>It would be important to ensure that the public in the UK and Iraq knew about the </p>
<p>successes that had been achieved. Mr Brown said that he intended to tell Parliament </p>
<p>that UK forces would conclude their mission by 31 May and withdraw by 31 July. </p>
<p><b>301. </b> Prime Minister Maliki said he was grateful for what the UK had achieved. Thanks </p>
<p>to military co-operation, terrorism had been confronted in Iraq. The UK and Iraq would </p>
<p>need to work together on the basis for the future involvement of UK forces in Iraq. His </p>
<p>preference was for an MOU or exchange of letters, although he understood that this </p>
<p>would not be legally binding. Once the arrangements had been agreed, it would be </p>
<p>important to move to a broader bilateral relationship between the two countries.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> On 18 December, Mr Brown made a statement in the House of Commons on </p>
<p>“the future of British troops in Iraq, the timetables, our legal agreements and our force </p>
<p>numbers”.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Mr Brown set out progress against the key tasks he had described in his statement </p>
<p>on 22 July and told MPs:</p>
<p>“Yesterday in Baghdad, I told Prime Minister Maliki, and he agreed, that British </p>
<p>forces in Iraq should have time to finish the missions I have just outlined.” </p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>431</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Working with the Government of Iraq, the UK had defined:</p>
<p>“… first, the tasks that need to [be] completed; secondly, the authorisations needed </p>
<p>to complete them; and thirdly, a way to provide a firm legal basis for our forces.”</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Mr Brown explained that he expected the process of securing a legal basis for </p>
<p>UK forces to be completed before resolution 1790 expired, but:</p>
<p>“In the event of the process not being complete, the Iraqis have told us that Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Authority Order 17, which confers protection on coalition troops, will </p>
<p>remain in place. Our troops will therefore have the legal basis that they need for </p>
<p>the future.”</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Once the agreed tasks were complete, “the fundamental change of mission that </p>
<p>I described in the House last summer will take place by 31 May 2009 at the latest”. </p>
<p>Thereafter a “rapid withdrawal” of troops would begin, taking the total from around </p>
<p>4,100 to under 400 by the end of July. Most of the remaining troops would be dedicated </p>
<p>to naval training. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> After withdrawal had taken place, the future Iraq/UK relationship would be “one of </p>
<p>partnership”, focused on “economic, commercial, cultural and educational relationships”. </p>
<p><b>308. </b> The Council of Representatives rejected the law covering UK operations in Iraq </p>
<p>on 20 December, by six votes.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary told Mr Brown </p>
<p>that there had been a dispute over whether the correct procedures had been followed </p>
<p>in debating the proposal within the Council of Representatives. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> Iraqi politicians told Mr Prentice that they were objecting to the process rather than </p>
<p>the content of the law; Prime Minister Maliki was clear that he still wanted to ensure that </p>
<p>the arrangements were put in place. </p>
<p><b>310. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary advised Mr Brown that the UK was pursuing three </p>
<p>options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>discussing with Mr Maliki’s legal adviser whether it would be possible to reach </p>
<p>agreement on a Government to Government basis, without formal ratification </p>
<p>by the Parliaments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a letter from the Iraqi Chief Justice confirming that a Government to Government </p>
<p>agreement could rest on CPA Order No.17; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making cosmetic changes to the law, which would then be resubmitted to the </p>
<p>Council of Representatives.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that after further discussion with the Iraqi authorities, </p>
<p>it was agreed that rather than proceed with the law as previously planned, the best way </p>
<p>to achieve the outcome needed in the time available would be to ask the Council of </p>
<p>Representatives to pass a legally binding resolution (rather than legislation) that would </p>
<p>authorise the Council of Ministers to enter into the necessary MOUs with all the non-US </p>
<p>coalition members.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>313. </b> On 21 December, Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary emailed him to say that </p>
<p>“the way forward is crystallising around a resolution of the Iraqi Parliament (one vote </p>
<p>rather than three readings)”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> A vote was expected the following day. </p>
<p><b>314. </b> Mr Prentice reported progress to the FCO on 24 December.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> He explained that </p>
<p>for Iraqi MPs, resolving the legal basis for coalition forces had been a “side show … </p>
<p>as they focused on how to remove their Speaker” after he made a series of insulting </p>
<p>statements in the chamber. </p>
<p><b>315. </b> Following Speaker Mashhadani’s resignation – accepted “in an almost unanimous </p>
<p>vote” – on 23 December, the Deputy Speaker read out a resolution which authorised </p>
<p>the Council of Ministers to “take all necessary measures to regulate the presence and </p>
<p>activities of the forces of the UK, Australia, Estonia, Romania, El Salvador and NATO </p>
<p>from 1 January until 31 July 2009” which was then approved by “a clear majority”. </p>
<p><b>316. </b> Mr Prentice recorded: “The approval of the Resolution took three minutes from </p>
<p>start to finish.” </p>
<p><b>317. </b> Mr Prentice commented that Prime Minister Maliki and his allies in the Council of </p>
<p>Representatives had been instrumental in ensuring that the resolution passed, reflecting </p>
<p>that he was in a “completely different (and much better) place” regarding the UK: </p>
<p>“We now have the opportunity to build on this better relationship in the transition we </p>
<p>see to a wider ‘normalised’ relationship with Iraq, as it recovers its full sovereignty </p>
<p>from 01/01/09. First we need to achieve ‘closure’ through the completion of our </p>
<p>remaining military tasks and the drawdown of our forces with proper pride in </p>
<p>their achievements. Thereafter, we should take care to retain due focus on Iraq’s </p>
<p>continuing strategic importance to our interests and the opportunities which will </p>
<p>progressively open to us here.”</p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Watkins advised Mr Hutton on 28 December that the resolution had been </p>
<p>ratified by the Presidency Council the previous day.</p>

<p>and regulating other matters such as the use of bases, freedom of movement etc” was </p>
<p>still required, and had run into difficulties. </p>
<p><b>319. </b> Drafts had been prepared in early December, but discussions were put on </p>
<p>hold while passage of the law was in progress. After the resolution was passed on </p>
<p>23 December, Iraqi officials did not appear willing to re-engage on the letters. </p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr Prentice and Mr Watkins met their key contact on 28 December and were told </p>
<p>that it remained the Iraqi Government’s intention to complete the authorisation process </p>
<p>in time for the letters to be signed on 31 December, but the indications were that there </p>
<p>would be further delays within the Iraqi system. Mr Watkins commented:</p>
<p>“This is an unwelcome turn of events, although we had not expected the finalisation </p>
<p>of the EoL [Exchange of Letters] to be straightforward … Subject to developments </p>
<p>tomorrow, there is a risk that the CoM [Council of Ministers] on Tuesday will (at </p>
<p>Maliki’s behest) circumscribe the authorisation of our tasks in a way that effectively </p>
<p>gives us a ‘training only’ mission in 2009 (which, the cynic might suspect, was his </p>
<p>aim all along). We will have two options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Conclude the EoL on this basis (and inform the US that we will have to cease </p>
<p>‘operational’ MITTing – and so induce an accelerated deployment of US forces </p>
<p>into Basra …)</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Push for combat authorisations and accept delay in the signature of the EoL </p>
<p>beyond 31 December, leading to another operational ‘pause’ …”</p>
<p><b>321. </b> Just over 24 hours before the expiry of resolution 1790, at 2230 on 30 December </p>
<p>Mr Prentice signed an MOU with the Iraqi Minister of Defence on behalf of the UK </p>
<p>and Iraqi Governments.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> The Australians signed their own MOU the same day; other </p>
<p>coalition partners were continuing their negotiations, supported by the US. Mr Prentice </p>
<p>reported to the FCO that:</p>
<p>“A further UK-Iraq agreement is planned, to cover non-operational training tasks </p>
<p>which will continue beyond 31 May. This may also need to be put to the CoR </p>
<p>[Council of Representatives] in due course.”</p>
<p><b>322. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lt Gen Cooper commented that the terms of the </p>
<p>UK’s MOU had not been as strong as the Status of Forces Agreement that the Iraqis had </p>
<p>negotiated with the US, but it was sufficient for the tasks that UK forces were conducting </p>
<p>at the time.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Asked by the Inquiry why the UK had settled for an MOU rather than pushing for a </p>
<p>Status of Forces Agreement like the US, Mr Prentice explained that, by this stage, there </p>
<p>was “exhaustion in the Iraqi body politic with the idea of international agreements” and, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>434</p>
<p>with several other coalition partners in addition to the UK, there “just wasn’t the capacity </p>
<p>or the political will” to go through the process of negotiating another Status of Forces </p>
<p>Agreement, having just agreed the US one.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> So, on Iraqi advice, the UK went for an </p>
<p>authorising law in Parliament. </p>
<p><b>324. </b> On the Iraqi political dynamics surrounding the MOU, Mr Prentice told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The whole issue was … a symptom and also a sort of football, kicked around </p>
<p>amongst the political actors who were trying to manoeuvre each other into a position </p>
<p>of appearing to be the advocate of continued international occupation of Iraq.”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>January 2009</b></p>
<p><b>325. </b> On 13 January, Mr Miliband’s Private Secretary circulated a draft strategy for </p>
<p>“UK policy towards and relations with Iraq following military drawdown” to members </p>
<p>of NSID.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> It had been agreed by officials from all interested departments and by </p>
<p>Mr Miliband and concluded that:</p>
<p>“… the UK will retain an important strategic interest in the emergence of a </p>
<p>stable, unitary and broadly democratic Iraq, with a functioning economy, which </p>
<p>can contribute to regional stability and prosperity and to global and European </p>
<p>energy security.”</p>
<p><b>326. </b> To retain influence on bilateral interests in the areas of trade, immigration and </p>
<p>counter-terrorism, it was necessary that “the Iraqis believe we take the relationship </p>
<p>seriously”. Both the UK’s bilateral objectives and the “wish to draw Iraq into a </p>
<p>pro-Western ‘arc of stability’ reaching from Turkey to the Gulf States” would require </p>
<p>“a high degree of engagement”. Mr Miliband had decided to maintain the Embassy </p>
<p>in Baghdad as the “focal point” for that engagement, with an office in Erbil to support </p>
<p>“commercial and other relationship building activity” but in Basra representation would </p>
<p>be reduced to a “mini-mission” of three or four staff. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> The strategy paper explained in more detail that the UK had:</p>
<p>“… a strategic national interest in a strong, stable and non-hostile Iraq that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>acts in accordance with international law and does not threaten its neighbours;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provides a counterweight against Iran, ideally as a pro-Western state …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>is able to deny AQ-I and other terrorist groups a safe haven in its national </p>
<p>territory;</p>

<p>9.7  |  May 2008 to October 2009</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contributes positively to stable world energy markets by maximising its potential </p>
<p>as a producer and exporter of oil and gas, and increases EU energy security </p>
<p>through developing new supply routes.”</p>
<p><b>328. </b> In order to achieve these objectives, the paper suggested that it was essential that </p>
<p>Iraq should remain a single entity; be capable of representing and serving the interests </p>
<p>of all its communities effectively; be able to defend its own borders and maintain internal </p>
<p>and external security; and have a functioning economy, which would require agreement </p>
<p>on the Hydrocarbons Law. </p>
<p><b>329. </b> It was also highly desirable that Iraq should be “a broadly democratic state”, should </p>
<p>address critical humanitarian issues (in particular the large number of refugees and </p>
<p>displaced people) and should develop a strong and open market economy. </p>
<p><b>330. </b> The main strategic risk identified was “the inability of the Iraqi leadership and </p>
<p>parties to rise above sectarian or partisan motivations and work in the interest of the </p>
<p>whole of Iraq”. The main operational risk was the security situation, which remained </p>
<p>“inimical to normal civilian operations”, so keeping the cost of operating in Iraq high.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> An annex to the main paper described further “problem areas”, including:</p>
<p>“Fundamental questions about Iraq’s future have not yet been settled. There is </p>
<p>still no broad agreement between a critical mass of Iraqi actors on the extent </p>
<p>of centralism versus devolution (both economic and political); the nature of the </p>
<p>relationships between Sunni and Shia, and between Arabs and Kurd … In addition, </p>
<p>serious doubts remain about the willingness and ability of Iraqi leaders to effect </p>
<p>reconciliation between Iraq’s main communities and encourage an inclusive and fair </p>
<p>political process.”</p>
<p><b>332. </b> The strategy paper set out the elements of the future relationship, in broadly </p>
<p>similar terms to those identified in the Cabinet Office paper for NSID. The main </p>
<p>difference was the specific addition of counter-terrorism and the processing of voluntary </p>
<p>and compulsory returns of migrants to Iraq, including the Kurdish Region. The paper </p>
<p>stated that:</p>
<p>“The UK … are no longer in a position to dictate political, economic and security </p>
<p>outcomes in Iraq … however, we have a clear interest in these outcomes insofar as </p>
<p>they affect Iraq’s security, stability, prosperity and governance. We therefore need </p>

<p>“IV. The threat from Al Qaida in Iraq has reduced significantly. It will continue to </p>

<p>they were the leading party with 37 percent and 16 percent respectively. In the </p>

<p>his own man as governor. But the initiative encouraged by us last year to bring </p>
<p>the parties together under a unity and justice heading, has paid dividends in </p>
<p>encouraging political co-operation.</p>
<p>“This unity argues well for the next Provincial Council. Which is as well, as it will face </p>
<p>many challenges … I have talked through potential for investment and assistance </p>
<p>with the political leadership who responded enthusiastically to the thought of UK </p>
<p>help. But they have little ideas of their own and their views on service delivery and </p>
<p>investment came across as naive.</p>
<p>“I therefore discussed with the team in Basra ways in which we should be looking to </p>
<p>help over the next few months and especially as we begin to draw down militarily. </p>
<p>We have begun the investment work … and we are well advanced on capacity </p>

<p><b>345. </b> Mr Baker reported that security in Basra continued to improve, and observed that </p>
<p>the city was “increasingly reminiscent of Erbil: a good thing”. He added:</p>
<p>“While it is true that the key enabler for recent progress was Charge of the Knights, </p>
<p>it was our reaction to those events which was critical. It would have been easy to </p>
<p>have taken that opportunity to disengage with Basra. Instead, we recognised that </p>

<p>“… the last year in Basra has been a model of co-operation between the GOC, </p>

<p><b>353. </b> He continued:</p>
<p>“Overall we have an increasingly strong story to present about Basra … The clear </p>
<p>view of the US … in Baghdad is that the key stage of the military transition will be </p>
<p>… on 31 March. They want to help us to make the most of that and to co-operate </p>
<p>in presenting our key messages on what has been achieved in Basra … </p>
<p>“In my view, a proper ceremony to mark the TOA [Transfer of Authority] on 31 March </p>
<p>will be essential to our campaign to ‘end well’ in Basra. In June-July, after the US </p>
<p>have been in command in the South for some months, it will be harder to distinguish </p>
<p>between UK and US achievements.”</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Miliband described a number of obstacles to the development of a broader </p>
<p>Iraq/UK relationship, most of which stemmed from “Iraq’s own continuing internal </p>
<p>challenges”:</p>
<p>“Security had improved hugely but conditions for business visitors are still far from </p>
<p>normal. Political and parliamentary dispute had replaced the clash of militias but the </p>
<p>government does not yet have a monopoly of arms in society. Tensions, particularly </p>
<p>between the Arabs and Kurds, could still flare into clashes along the Green Line. And </p>
<p>Iraq’s economy is also facing its version of the global recession with the collapse of </p>
<p>government revenues after the fall in the oil price. Corruption needs to be checked.” </p>

<p>of the nations in the region”, including Iran and Syria.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>362. </b> The need for a “comprehensive approach” was the reason the US was “refocusing </p>

<p>American power to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon; and actively seeking </p>
<p>lasting peace between Israel and the Arab world”. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> President Obama had said that the US would work to promote a “just, </p>
<p>representative and accountable” Iraqi Government but cautioned that the US could not </p>
<p>“let the pursuit of the perfect stand in the way of achievable goals”. He recognised that </p>
<p>it would not be possible to rid Iraq of all who opposed the US or sympathised with its </p>
<p>enemies, but a new US Ambassador, Christopher Hill, would lead a new strategy of </p>
<p>“sustained diplomacy”.</p>

<p> In his end of tour report Lt Gen Cooper wrote that:</p>
<p>“… 2008-09 was a very significant year in the Iraq campaign. It built on previous </p>
<p>events in security terms but perhaps the key event was the assertiveness of Maliki in </p>
<p>dealing with Shia militias that then gave him the credibility and authority to establish </p>
<p>the writ of government across Iraq … Notwithstanding the risks and fault lines that </p>
<p>remain in Iraq and the weakness of the economic position, the glass is half full, with </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>444</p>
<p><b>369. </b> In political terms, Lt Gen Cooper judged that:</p>
<p>“Despite frequent and frustrating in-fighting, a good deal of positive progress was </p>
<p>made politically in the last year. The political parties cobbled together a mini ‘grand </p>
<p>bargain’ to pass the 2008 budget and the amnesty and provincial powers law; the … </p>
<p>[Council of Representatives] passed the provincial elections law and brought down </p>
<p>their powerful Speaker; and the GoI pushed the US back over successive red lines </p>
<p>before concluding the Security Agreement. In many ways, the political class came </p>
<p>of age …”</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Lt Gen Cooper attributed campaign progress in Iraq to a range of factors, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The clear focus maintained by the US on its declared aim of defeating </p>
<p>extremism and allowing democracy to develop. That led to a continued </p>
<p>commitment to win, despite very evident pressures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The effectiveness of the US and Iraqi surges.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Sunni Awakening movement, and the Sunni reconciliation initiative started </p>
<p>by Lt Gen Lamb (see Section 9.5): “one of the key factors why Reconciliation </p>
<p>with the Sunni worked, was that it was initiated, negotiated and delivered from </p>
<p>a position of strength … Against that background, the MND(SE) Reconciliation/</p>
<p>Accommodation with JAM in Basra in 2007 may be perceived to have been </p>
<p>completed from a position of relative weakness.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JAM national cease-fire which had allowed political and security strength </p>
<p>and legitimacy to accrue, over time, to the Iraqi Government and ISF.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The scale of the resources committed (in particular the US contribution).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Time, because: “<i>All COIN</i> [counter-insurgency] <i>campaigns take time.</i>”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Strong leadership on both the civilian and military sides of the coalition and </p>
<p>within the Iraqi government and security forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US development of counter-insurgency doctrine, and its understanding of the </p>
<p>nature of the conflict, which had been “hugely impressive”: “Meanwhile, in 2009, </p>
<p>the UK has yet to update and publish its own doctrine on COIN operations – </p>
<p>a serious omission.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Co-ordination across the various lines of operation within the US system: </p>
<p>“There are powerful lessons here for the UK cross-Government approach to </p>
<p>future campaigns and post-conflict reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Lt Gen Cooper observed that relations between the UK and Iraq had “warmed a </p>
<p>little in the past four months” though he was frustrated that the UK had yet to confirm the </p>
<p>nature, scale and resource of its long-term military relationship with Iraq, particularly with </p>
<p>the Iraqi armed forces. The Iraqi MOD was very keen to establish links. Lt Gen Cooper </p>
<p>wrote: “Thus far we have promised something but not yet delivered it.” </p>

<p>445</p>
<p><b>372. </b> In relation to relationships with the US, Lt Gen Cooper commented:</p>
<p>“2008 was a difficult year in Iraq for the UK-US relationship, but it has recovered to </p>
<p>a degree since then. A degree of certainty in our position in MND(SE) has helped. </p>
<p>Whilst it is true that many US officers would have wished us to stay with them until </p>
<p>the end of their mission here, the fact that we now have a defined end date to which </p>
<p>both parties are working has allowed harmony in planning to be maintained.”</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Prentice reported on 5 March that President Obama’s announcement had </p>
<p>received “blanket media coverage” in Iraq.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> Given his campaign pledge to withdraw </p>
<p>troops within 16 months of taking office, the announcement had come as little surprise. </p>
<p>But the Iraqi Government had welcomed the statement and, although some were </p>
<p>nervous about the implications, public opinion in Iraq appeared to be mostly positive.</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Mr Prentice commented that the “phantom elephant in the room” was the promised </p>
<p>referendum on the US Security Agreement, described in the law that ratified the US </p>
<p>SOFA. The US and the MNF were working on the basis that there would not be a </p>
<p>referendum.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> On 9 March, a CIG considered the implications of Iraq’s provincial elections, at </p>
<p>the request of the FCO.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> The CIG noted that the average turnout was 51 percent and </p>
<p>that the formerly dominant parties all performed poorly. Overall, Prime Minister Maliki’s </p>
<p>“Rule of Law” coalition and secular Sunni parties were the winners at the expense of the </p>
<p>Kurds and Islamist parties. Sadrists won “a handful of seats” on all southern councils </p>
<p>and in Baghdad. </p>

<p>“the increasing readiness of Iraqis to pursue their objectives through politics instead </p>
<p>of violence”.</p>
<p><b>377. </b> The CIG judged that Prime Minister Maliki viewed his coalition’s success as </p>
<p>a personal victory. It had increased his standing but his power to achieve specific </p>
<p>objectives would still vary with the issue. A successful challenge to his position was </p>
<p>now unlikely before national elections, expected in early 2010.</p>
<p><b>378. </b> The CIG assessed that the election results represented an endorsement of strong </p>
<p>central government and a setback for federalism. It judged that Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>would use his success to push for greater centralisation.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> On 9 March, the Assessments Staff issued a Current Assessment Note that looked </p>
<p>at the prospects for the ongoing reconciliation efforts between the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>the Sadrist movement.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Maliki has sought reconciliation with the Sadrist movement since he </p>
<p>launched successful security operations against its Jaysh al-Mahdi militia in 2008. </p>
<p>Progress has been slow … but we judge that the prospects are now improving … </p>
<p>“We assess that Maliki’s relationship with the Sadrists is changing and that the pace </p>
<p>of this change is increasing. But achieving reconciliation and political alliance will </p>
<p>take months. The reconciliation process allows Maliki to control the Sadrists without </p>
<p>needing to give much in return. The Sadrists remain fragmented with no clear </p>
<p>direction or strategy, and have few levers.”</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Cabinet Office officials provided Mr Brown with an update on Afghanistan and Iraq </p>
<p>on 13 March.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> They reported that levels of violence across Iraq were at a six-year low, </p>
<p>a 90 percent decrease since the US surge began in 2007. Violence in Basra remained </p>
<p>low, with no UK or US casualties although a Pakistani civilian contractor had been killed.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> UK military mentors and trainers embedded with the Iraqi Army had begun to </p>
<p>disengage, and would have withdrawn completely by 31 March. </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Discussions on an MOU for the UK’s “future (normal) military relationship with Iraq” </p>
<p>had started and should have concluded by the time of Prime Minister Maliki’s visit for the </p>

<p><b>383. </b> The Council of Representatives had agreed the US$59bn Iraqi Budget, but it </p>

<p>were “strong signs of economic growth”. He considered it “vital that we continue to assist </p>
<p>the Basrawis with their economic revival”. He concluded his report to Ministers and </p>
<p>senior staff within the MOD with some reflections on the lessons that had been learned </p>
<p>in Iraq:</p>
<p>“As our operations come to an end in Iraq we must be conscious that it has at times </p>
<p>been a difficult and bumpy ride. We will not be universally praised for what we have </p>
<p>achieved and some will be overtly critical but we have achieved what we set out to </p>
<p>do and we leave Basra in good shape, secure and confident about the future. But </p>
<p>it is also essential that we learn the lessons from this campaign and transfer them </p>
<p>effectively to Afghanistan to ensure success there. Tactical military lessons have </p>
<p>been learned and it is the higher level political-military issues that we must now </p>
<p>focus on; whilst the Theatres may be different, political ambition and constraint will </p>
<p>continue to influence military operation and we must not make the same mistakes </p>
<p>in Afghanistan that we have made in Iraq. We must do what is right militarily in a </p>
<p>dynamic and complex environment and must not allow long term political aspiration </p>
<p>to drive what we do – to do so invites failure. We would do well to conduct a formal </p>
<p>and open appraisal of the operational and strategic lessons we have identified </p>
<p>across government – this should not be seen as a means to apportion blame for </p>
<p>what did not go well but rather as an opportunity to ensure success in Afghanistan </p>
<p>and thereafter.”</p>

<p>“UK looked to establish a positive and long term military relationship with Iraq based </p>

<p><b>387. </b> ACM Stirrup’s Principal Staff Officer observed that “In an otherwise very upbeat </p>

<p><b>April 2009</b></p>
<p><b>388. </b> A CIG Current Assessment Note issued on 1 April stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s increased sovereignty and security are giving it the confidence to become </p>
<p>more assertive towards Iran. The Iraqi-US Security Agreement was the clearest </p>
<p>example of Iraq putting its interests first.”</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>389. </b> The note reported an apparent increase in Iraqi popular criticism of Iran. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, the CIG judged that Prime Minister Maliki was not yet likely to risk </p>
<p>antagonising Iran. </p>
<p><b>390. </b> Lord Mandelson visited Basra on 6 April, accompanied by a UK business </p>
<p>delegation and Mr Wareing, to attend an investment conference at Basra Airport.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Nigel Haywood, British Consul General in Basra, reported the event to the FCO </p>
<p>and commented that it had been “timed perfectly” so that the UK could “demonstrate that </p>
<p>whilst the military were drawing down, the UK’s commitment to Basra continued”. The </p>
<p>event is addressed in more detail in Section 10.2.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> On 19 April, the Council of Representatives elected Tawafuq MP Mr Iyad </p>
<p>al-Samarri’e as its new Speaker, filling the vacancy left by Dr Mashhadani’s resignation </p>

<p> Mr Hutton </p>
<p>wrote that:</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Maliki’s visit and the London Conference are the next key milestones </p>

<p><b>395. </b> On 24 April 2009, the Military Adviser to Lt Gen Wall provided him with briefing </p>
<p>about the negotiations with JAM1 (see Section 9.6), to enable him to brief Mr Hutton </p>
<p>“following his query to DG Sec Pol”.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> The briefing set out the background to the </p>
<p>operation and described its objectives as:</p>
<p>“<b>GOC MND(SE).</b> The objective as seen by GOC MND(SE) was to split JAM into pro </p>
<p>and anti-Iranian elements to place into a majority those viewing Iran (rather than the </p>
<p>coalition) as the root cause of violence and instability in Basra).</p>
<p>“<b>SofS</b>. At the strategic level, the perspective was slightly different. 2006 saw a </p>
<p>steady increase in the number of UK fatalities; by 2007, on average, three UK </p>
<p>Service Personnel were being killed each month. The focus was on reducing these </p>
<p>attacks. Further, at the end of 2006, there was a realistic prospect of 2007 being </p>
<p>the last year in which our presence in Iraq would be authorised by a UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolution from which coalition forces drew their authority to hold detainees. </p>
<p>In Jan 06, there were 117 detainees held in the UK run facility in MND(SE). Given </p>
<p>that the vast majority of these detainees would have to be released anyway, the </p>
<p>then Secretary of State agreed that we should make a virtue out of necessity by </p>
<p>negotiating with Basra JAM to use the releases to persuade them to stop attacks </p>
<p>on coalition forces.”</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The advice also reported how the negotiations were likely to be treated by an Iraq </p>
<p>Inquiry, if one were to be commissioned:</p>
<p>“The extent to which [NAME OF OPERATION] would form part of an Iraq enquiry </p>
<p>[sic] would depend on the ToRs of the enquiry (public, private, dates covered). It is, </p>
<p>however, reasonable to assume at this stage that the operation would be admissible. </p>
<p>In any event, most elements of the operation are in the public domain; this would </p>
<p>be unlikely to stop the issue becoming one of a few high profile headlines in an </p>
<p>enquiry.”</p>

<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>401. </b> The discussion also covered the need for an agreement on the legal basis for the </p>

<p>unclear legally whether there was a need to seek the approval of the Iraqi Parliament, </p>
<p>he would do so. He assured Mr Brown that he would do so by the end of May. </p>
<p><b>402. </b> In a letter to Mr Hutton’s Private Secretary, Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>405. </b> The CIG’s Assessment recalled that the Iraqi Kurds had played a leading role </p>
<p>in the 2003-2005 state-building process and had established territorial, political and </p>
<p>financial power unique to their community. They enshrined the powers and territorial </p>
<p>claims of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) in the Constitution, extended their </p>
<p>political and military influence beyond the KRG into disputed territories, gained control </p>
<p>of Iraq’s northern oil fields and secured 17 percent of the federal budget, and central </p>
<p>funding for their Peshmerga militia. The CIG judged that the Kurds wanted to protect </p>
<p>these gains and to extend them by bringing Kirkuk into the KRG.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Although the Kurds were allied with Arab parties within the Iraqi Government, </p>
<p>disagreements over budget allocation, Peshmerga funding, the oil industry, disputed </p>

<p><b>411. </b> Mr Prentice updated the Iraq Strategy Group on 21 May on negotiations with the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government regarding the future of the UK military presence in Iraq.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>412. </b> So far, UK lobbying “had not yet got traction”. A meeting of the Council of Ministers </p>
<p>on 26 May was expected to be critical. In the absence of an agreement, Lt Gen Wall told </p>
<p>the Group that remaining UK personnel (naval trainers, a ship, personnel embedded in </p>
<p>the MNF and at the military academy) would need to be withdrawn. </p>
<p><b>413. </b> Mr McDonald told the Group that it should consider whether failure to secure </p>
<p>an agreement was damaging in substance, or in presentational terms. Mr Watkins </p>
<p>felt that “on balance staying with an agreement would benefit the UK”. The Group </p>
<p>considered whether offering a reduced UK package might be helpful. Mr Prentice </p>
<p>was given “delegated authority on whether and how to offer Maliki different options </p>
<p>on the UK package”. Lt Gen Wall and Mr Watkins agreed to consider this further and </p>
<p>offer guidance. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr McDonald told the Iraq Strategy Group that he saw “two conflicting objectives”: </p>
<p>firstly that the UK should not devote increasing effort to a diminishing presence and </p>
<p>secondly that it should not end its military presence in Iraq on “a sour note, having </p>
<p>successfully withdrawn from Basra”. Mr McDonald concluded that the UK should make </p>
<p>a final major effort before the 26 May meeting of the Council of Ministers, including </p>
<p>reminding them of the commitment Prime Minister Maliki made to Mr Brown in April. </p>
<p>If that failed, the UK should be ready to leave and should develop a handling strategy. </p>
<p>Mr Brown should be informed. </p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Prentice confirmed that Ambassador Hill and Gen Odierno were clear that if the </p>

<p><b>417. </b> FCO and MOD officials in Baghdad were engaged in a final round of lobbying but </p>
<p>Mr Hutton cautioned that Ministers might “need to make a decision shortly on whether </p>
<p>to withdraw all remaining UK forces from Iraq”. To do so by 31 July, as the December </p>

<p>by 15 June. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> The key disagreement was about jurisdictional immunities for UK troops, which </p>

<p>“the level of political exposure is too great for the limited reward which 400 troops and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Mr Brown said that the UK was not asking for any more troops than he and </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki had already discussed: 400 troops plus ships. It would be possible </p>
<p>to discuss a reduction in troop numbers but the UK could not weaken jurisdictional </p>
<p>immunities. </p>
<p><b>426. </b> Prime Minister Maliki said that Iraq had three concerns:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of locations for troops in Iraq was unspecified.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Immunities were being requested even inside Iraqi installations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Troop tasks were not limited to training and naval support but also involved </p>
<p>participation in command chains.</p>
<p><b>427. </b> Prime Minister Maliki suggested that the British Embassy should recommence </p>
<p>negotiations with the Iraqi MOD. Mr Brown said that he hoped that rapid progress could </p>
<p>be made during the course of the day and would call again later; Mr Maliki said that Iraq </p>
<p>could move quickly but would require the UK to be flexible.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Later that day Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary reported that there remained </p>
<p>no agreement in Baghdad.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>429. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary advised that the MOD and the Embassy wanted </p>
<p>to “throw in the towel” but Mr McDonald, Mr Cavanagh and he disagreed and thought </p>
<p>that agreement could be reached on a new package, for example offering places at </p>
<p>Sandhurst plus the naval operation. Mr McDonald would go to Baghdad as Mr Brown’s </p>
<p>personal envoy after visiting Washington the following day. </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Hutton’s Private Secretary on 28 May </p>
<p>to say that Mr Brown had asked Mr McDonald to visit Baghdad early the following week </p>
<p>to seek agreement on a package comprising:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an offer to withdraw the remaining 400 troops, and re-badge UK training </p>
<p>assistance under the NATO training mission;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enhanced training opportunities in the UK, including a substantial number of </p>
<p>officer training places at Sandhurst; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing with the UK’s naval operations, especially to protect oil platforms.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr McDonald told the Inquiry that it had been “quite easy” agreeing with Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki that Iraq had a training need to give the navy extra capabilities and the </p>

<p>UK was well placed to assist.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> But it was less easy agreeing the legal basis for that </p>
<p>to happen:</p>
<p>“… as I had been involved in it in December 2008, I went back to Iraq in the spring </p>
<p>of 2009, saw Prime Minister Maliki’s key advisers, saw Prime Minister Maliki himself, </p>
<p>and agreed a package, which eventually became Iraqi law.” </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that he saw this agreement as “meeting Iraqi needs, </p>
<p>expressed needs, and also being a natural part of a full bilateral relationship with a </p>
<p>country with whom we have historical ties with their military”.</p>
<p>178</p>

<p><b>June 2009</b></p>
<p><b>433. </b> Mr Brown reshuffled his Cabinet on 6 June and appointed Mr Bob Ainsworth, </p>
<p>formerly Minister for the Armed Forces, as Defence Secretary. Mr Miliband and </p>
<p>Mr Alexander remained in their posts as Foreign Secretary and International </p>
<p>Development Secretary.</p>
<p><b>434. </b> On 12 June, Mr Brown told Cabinet that since the withdrawal of British troops </p>
<p>was nearly complete, “the time was right to announce an Inquiry into the war in Iraq”.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It would be an inquiry by Privy Counsellors, following the model of the Franks Inquiry </p>
<p>into the Falklands War.</p>
<p><b>435. </b> On 15 June, Mr Brown made a statement to the House of Commons on the UK’s </p>
<p>future involvement in Iraq.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“Our troops first went into Iraq in March 2003 and now they are coming home. In </p>
<p>total, 120,000 men and women have served in Iraq during the last six years, so it </p>
<p>is fitting that I should now come to the House to talk of their achievements through </p>
<p>difficult times; to chart the new relationship we are building with Iraq; and to set out </p>
<p>our plans for an inquiry into the conflict.</p>
<p>“In my statement to the House last December, I set out the remaining tasks in </p>
<p>southern Iraq for our mission … I can report that those three objectives are being </p>
<p>achieved …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Significant challenges remain, including that of finding a fair and sustainable </p>
<p>solution to the sharing of Iraq’s oil reserves, but Iraq’s future is now in its own hands, </p>
<p>in the hands of its people and its politicians. We must pay tribute to the endurance of </p>
<p>the Iraqi people; we pledge to them our continuing support … As the House knows, </p>

<p>456</p>
<p>today, there are fewer than 500 British troops in Iraq, with more returning home </p>
<p>each week.”</p>
<p><b>436. </b> On the UK’s continued military presence in Iraq, Mr Brown told the House of </p>
<p>Commons that: </p>
<p>“At the request of the Iraqi Government, a small number of British Navy personnel – </p>
<p>no more than 100 – will remain in Iraq for long-term training of the Iraqi Army. Royal </p>
<p>Navy ships will continue to protect the oil platforms on which Iraq’s exports depend, </p>
<p>and we will continue to offer training to the Iraqi army as part of a wider NATO </p>
<p>mission. We will also offer training opportunities at Sandhurst and elsewhere in the </p>
<p>United Kingdom for Iraqi officers of high potential. At the core of our new relationship </p>
<p>however will be the diplomatic, trading and cultural links that we are building with the </p>
<p>Iraqi people, supporting British and other foreign investors who want to play a role in </p>
<p>the reconstruction of southern Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Mr Brown also announced the establishment of the Iraq Inquiry, with a “primary </p>
<p>objective … to identify lessons learned”. </p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 28 June, Mr Prentice attended his final meeting of the Iraqi National Security </p>
<p>Council.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> As previously agreed with the US Embassy, at the end of the meeting he </p>
<p>made a statement announcing that the UK would not attend in future (and he believed </p>
<p>that it was also the US intention to withdraw). He told the Iraqi ministers present that:</p>
<p>“We had greatly appreciated the privilege of being part of the NSC over the </p>
<p>previous five years. Now on the eve of a further major demonstration of Iraqi lead </p>
<p>responsibility through the withdrawal of US troops from cities and towns, it was the </p>
<p>right time for us to bow out. The Iraqi Government was showing its ability to deal </p>
<p>with the tough security issues and should be allowed to continue their discussions </p>
<p>in the NSC without any external presence.”</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Although the announcement came as a surprise to the Iraqis, it was welcomed. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki thanked the UK and US for their support over many years, </p>
<p>emphasising that there should still be a means to discuss security issues bilaterally or </p>
<p>as a group. Other NSC members welcomed the announcement and afterwards thanked </p>
<p>Mr Prentice for the UK’s role.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Following the meeting, Mr Prentice, Ambassador Hill and Gen Odierno sent a joint </p>
<p>letter to Prime Minister Maliki, thanking him for the opportunity to take part in the NSC, </p>
<p>confirming US and UK withdrawal, underlining the progress the NSC had made and </p>
<p>emphasising their readiness to provide support or advice in the future.</p>

<p><b>441. </b> A few days later, Mr Prentice reported that, on 30 June, US troops completed the </p>
<p>transfer of responsibility for all urban areas to the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>442. </b> The Iraqi Government had declared the day a national holiday, with the title </p>
<p>National Sovereignty Day or the Day of Dignity. Despite increased violence in the </p>
<p>run-up to the transfer, the arrangements on the day were “broadly successful” with </p>
<p>the exception of a car bomb in Kirkuk which killed 33 people. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> Mr Prentice reported that Prime Minister Maliki compared the day to the Arab </p>
<p>Revolt against the British in 1920 (see Annex 1). President Talabani thanked the </p>
<p>coalition for its commitment and sacrifice, although “noticeable by its absence was any </p>
<p>statement of thanks to coalition forces from the Prime Minister”. Mr Prentice reported </p>
<p>that the public mood was “a mixture of pride and apprehension” and judged that “the </p>
<p>GoI is now unequivocally in the lead and the Iraqi people are watching to see whether it </p>
<p>can deliver”. </p>
<p><b>July 2009</b></p>
<p><b>444. </b> At its meeting on 8 July, the JIC examined the likely political and security trends </p>
<p>in Iraq over the next six months.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. Maliki is determined to secure a second term as Prime Minister in the 2010 </p>
<p>national elections. This influences all of his political decisions and relationships.</p>
<p>“II. The current fluidity of Iraqi politics makes predictions difficult. But Maliki will </p>
<p>probably be able to assemble a cross-sectarian nationalist coalition if he can attract </p>
<p>a Sunni partner. Given the Iraqi government’s continuing commitment to the success </p>
<p>of the Sons of Iraq initiative, his best chance probably lies with the Awakening </p>
<p>movement, though will retreat towards a Shia alliance if he doubts the stability </p>
<p>or popularity of a cross-sectarian nationalist alliance.</p>
<p>“III. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) will probably seek to join Maliki </p>
<p>in any type of coalition; it is less clear whether Maliki will accept an alliance with </p>
<p>ISCI, given its reputation as a sectarian party influenced by Iran. The Sadrists are </p>
<p>preparing to participate fully in the elections and want to be part of a nationalist </p>
<p>alliance, but Maliki and Sadr will not commit to an alliance until polling is complete.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“V. Violence across Iraq will probably remain around the current level during 2009 </p>
<p>– an average of about 130 attacks per week compared with nearly 1,600 attacks </p>
<p>per week in mid 2007. The progressive shift from violence to politics will continue, </p>

<p>“VI. A spike in attacks and especially casualties over the coming months, following </p>
<p>withdrawal of Multi-National Forces from the cities, might lead to perceptions that </p>
<p>security gains are eroding. But this would not indicate that violent groups are </p>

<p><b>445. </b> On 21 July, at the request of DFID, a CIG considered the impact of corruption </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>446. </b> The CIG judged that corruption “has a significant impact on the economy and </p>
<p>governance” in Iraq, with cost estimates ranging from 3.5 to 10 percent of GDP. </p>
<p><b>447. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“In 2008 the global anti-corruption society Transparency International (TI) designated </p>
<p>Iraq the third most corrupt country in the world, behind Somalia and Burma. </p>
<p>TI’s Global Corruption Barometer 2009 reported that 44 percent of Iraqis had paid </p>
<p>some form of bribe in the last 12 months, compared to 3 percent in the UK and a </p>
<p>worldwide average of 11 percent. 42 percent of Iraqis polled in TI’s survey felt that </p>
<p>corruption was most prevalent in the public sector and civil service, while 27 percent </p>
<p>considered political parties most tainted. The survey suggested that public trust in </p>
<p>the judiciary and news media was much higher.”</p>
<p><b>448. </b> The CIG judged that government ministries were “riddled with” corruption and </p>
<p>recorded that: </p>
<p>“Iraq’s Commission on Integrity (CI) has identified the Ministries for Oil and Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs as prominent embezzlers …”</p>
<p><b>449. </b> The CIG reported that, in 2006, Mr Stuart Bowen, the US Special Inspector </p>
<p>General for Iraq Reconstruction had referred to a “virtual pandemic” of corruption costing </p>
<p>Iraq US$4 billion a year (equivalent to approximately 3.5 percent of GDP). The CIG </p>
<p>assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Later estimates suggest the cost of corruption in the South alone could be as </p>
<p>high as $12bn pa. This range of cost estimates suggests corruption at a level </p>
<p>which is significantly hindering macroeconomic recovery, as well as damaging </p>
<p>local economics. In March 2007, Rhadi Hamza al-Rhadi, CI Chairman, claimed </p>
<p>that corruption was worse than under Saddam’s regime. CI had brought corruption </p>
<p>charges against eight Ministers and forty Directors-General, but all had fled </p>

<p>but by September 2007 al-Rhadi had resigned following repeated death threats, </p>
<p>and subsequently sought asylum in the US. Bowen called the corruption problem </p>
<p>‘the second insurgency’ for its destabilising effects on Iraq. We judge that the </p>
<p>US draw-down will have an impact on oversight, making international scrutiny </p>
<p>of institutional corruption more difficult.”</p>
<p><b>450. </b> The CIG assessed that corruption was “driven both by a desire for personal </p>
<p>enrichment and by political considerations” and that “the practice of soliciting bribes at </p>
<p>checkpoints was commonplace”. Shia militias had “exploited their control of economic </p>
<p>assets for political gain”.</p>
<p><b>451. </b> The CIG judged that “the Iraqi public is more tolerant of certain kinds of corruption </p>
<p>such as nepotism than in the West, but is growing tired of political graft”. That had “led to </p>
<p>an increase in anti-corruption rhetoric, but little change in behaviour”. The Assessment </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“In May [2009] CI announced that 97 officials were under investigation for graft, </p>
<p>including 53 ranked as Directors-General or higher, and that 120 Iraqis had been </p>
<p>arrested for corruption in April and May. On 30 May former Trade Minister Sudani </p>
<p>was arrested on charges of embezzlement and corruption regarding food imports </p>
<p>and rations under the Public Distribution System, which was established in 1995 </p>
<p>as part of the UN Oil-for-Food Programme following the 1991 Gulf War.”</p>
<p><b>452. </b> The CIG reported that, in mid-June, the son of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani had </p>
<p>urged Prime Minister Maliki to lead the fight against political corruption, believing that </p>
<p>corruption and the provision of public services would be the public’s fundamental </p>
<p>preoccupations in the forthcoming elections. </p>
<p><b>453. </b> The CIG judged that nepotism and cronyism were “widespread” in Kurdistan, </p>
<p>where: </p>
<p>“Lucrative construction contracts are regularly awarded to families of party or </p>
<p>regional government officials. Corruption has become a prominent issue in the run </p>
<p>up to the KRG parliamentary elections …” </p>
<p><b>454. </b> The CIG assessed that corruption also affected governance at regional and local </p>
<p>levels. Endemic public sector corruption in Basra had prevented the delivery of social </p>
<p>security payments, and health and education services. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> The CIG also assessed that:</p>
<p>“The lack of effective anti money-laundering and counter-terrorism finance regimes </p>
<p>deters foreign financial institutions from doing business with their Iraqi counterparts, </p>
<p>and severely cramps the development of the Iraqi financial sector.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>460</p>
<p><b>456. </b> In the oil sector:</p>
<p>“Corruption within the Oil Ministry acts as a deterrent to some foreign investment. </p>
<p>Despite attempts to make bidding processes more transparent, foreign oil </p>
<p>companies willing to pay bribes are likely to receive preferential treatment.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> The assessment concluded, under the heading “Outlook”, that:</p>
<p>“Corruption is strongly associated with the slow pace of development and </p>
<p>reconstruction. These issues resonate with voters. As the January 2010 national </p>
<p>elections approach, we judge that Maliki is likely to intensify his policy focus </p>
<p>on corruption as a vehicle for popular appeal and as a tool with which to attack </p>
<p>political opponents.”</p>
<p><b>458. </b> On 23 July, a letter from Mr Ainsworth’s Private Secretary to Mr Brown’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary for Foreign Affairs explained that further delays in the Iraqi Parliament meant </p>
<p>that it was very unlikely that the UK/Iraq defence agreement would be ratified before late </p>
<p>September.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> The Chiefs of Staff had agreed that the UK should begin the temporary </p>
<p>withdrawal of the remaining UK military personnel to Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>459. </b> In parallel the UK would make clear that it was prepared to resume activity ahead </p>
<p>of the formal ratification provided that the Iraqi Government issued a clear invitation to </p>
<p>the UK for this purpose and explicitly recognise that the UK’s legally binding jurisdictional </p>
<p>immunities continued beyond 31 July.</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Ainsworth’s Private Secretary explained:</p>
<p>“The government-to-government agreement we signed on 6 June has … been </p>
<p>proceeding through the Iraqi parliament and passed its second reading (of three </p>
<p>needed) on 7 July. Unfortunately, despite broad support from the main Iraqi political </p>
<p>blocs, walk-outs from the Sadrists (who oppose the presence of any foreign troops </p>
<p>on Iraqi soil) prevented the agreement from being put to a third reading and vote </p>
<p>as planned on 11 and 13 July … It failed again on 21 July … because the Iraqi </p>
<p>parliament did not reach it before finishing for the day.”</p>
<p><b>461. </b> The FCO Iraq Policy Team advised Mr Miliband’s Private Secretary that in </p>
<p>Baghdad the “Embassy has lobbied key figures to support the agreement throughout, </p>
<p>and aside from the Sadrists there is no major organised opposition inside the CoR”.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The British Embassy Washington was preparing to lobby Prime Minister Maliki during </p>
<p>his visit to the US. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Jon Wilks, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Baghdad, called on Prime </p>

<p>personnel were withdrawing from Iraq to Kuwait for two weeks, after which point they </p>
<p>would go on to the UK. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr Wilks identified two options until the Council of Representatives returned in late </p>
<p>September and could again be asked to ratify the agreement:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a letter from the Iraqi Government extending the UK’s previous security </p>
<p>agreement for two months; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a letter from the Iraqi Government creating a new temporary agreement, for the </p>
<p>UK naval training team. </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief of Staff recommended writing to Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>with these proposals. </p>
<p><b>465. </b> A Cabinet Office official discussed the options with Mr McDonald on the same </p>
<p>day, who considered that an extension of the current agreement was the best interim </p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> He asked that no decision on permanent withdrawal of UK staff be taken </p>
<p>before the situation was reviewed at the end of September. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Wilks, “emphasising the PM’s interest in reaching an interim agreement”, </p>
<p>delivered a letter proposing the two interim options to Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief of </p>
<p>Staff on 29 July.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> He asked whether the UK would consider bringing its training under </p>
<p>the agreement signed between the Iraqi Government and NATO. Mr Wilks explained </p>
<p>that it would not be feasible to re-open the NATO agreement.</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Wilks also provided the Cabinet Office with an assessment of the chances for </p>
<p>a successful vote in the Council of Representatives in the autumn. He suggested that </p>
<p>the prospects looked good – there were indications that a majority of MPs supported </p>
<p>the agreement, though also that opponents were consolidating their support. There was </p>
<p>a risk that:</p>
<p>“… as negotiations on electoral alliances continue over Ramadan, the Sadrists will </p>
<p>make opposition to our agreement a pre-condition for their joining an alliance. This </p>
<p>could tip the balance among MPs against our agreement if the Sadrists were to join </p>
<p>a large alliance.”</p>

<p><b>469. </b> Mr Forber advised Mr Hutton’s Private Secretary on the way ahead for the defence </p>
<p>agreement on 31 July.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> In addition to the two options put forward by Mr Wilks, he </p>
<p>identified a third:</p>
<p>“The Government of Iraq and NATO agree that the UK maritime training activity </p>
<p>should in future come under the NATO mission.”</p>
<p><b>470. </b> Mr Forber assessed that this option would:</p>
<p>“… not allow for protection of Iraqi oil platforms/territorial waters, it would meet all </p>
<p>our requirements for training of the Iraqi navy including jurisdictional immunities – </p>
<p>the NATO agreement has slightly better immunities than the UK agreement as we </p>
<p>ensured it explicitly included Umm Qasr as a potential location to cover just such </p>
<p>an eventuality.”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> On 31 July, Mr McDonald called Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief of Staff to press for </p>
<p>rapid progress on an interim agreement.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> He observed that “UK media was portraying </p>
<p>this as a problem in our bilateral relationship”. Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief of Staff said </p>
<p>that the Iraq Government would “continue to work on trying to find appropriate ways </p>
<p>forward”. </p>

<p><b>472. </b> On 5 August, the JIC again considered Iranian influence in Iraq, and Iraq’s reaction </p>
<p>to it.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“Iraq can stand up to Iranian political interference and will begin to reject it as </p>
<p>it exercises its sovereignty with increasing confidence. Iraq can also withstand </p>
<p>Iranian military interference through its strategic defence agreement with the US, </p>
<p>improvement of its armed forces and political accommodation with the Shia militants </p>
<p>that Iran supports …</p>
<p>“In the longer term, Iran’s increasing trade and investment are laying the foundations </p>
<p>for ‘soft power’ by establishing dependency in areas where Iraqi and Iranian </p>
<p>interests coincide. The planned withdrawal of large numbers of US forces in 2011 </p>
<p>will be a particularly testing time for the Iraqi Government and armed forces …</p>
<p>“Iraqis, even most Shia, consider Iran to be their biggest strategic threat, but many </p>
<p>also see Iranian money and investment as an opportunity for personal gain and </p>
<p>national economic well-being. Friction between the two countries is inevitable, but </p>

<p>to the Iranian regime.”</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Mr McDonald called Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief Political Adviser on 6 August, </p>
<p>and asked whether the Iraqi Government could provide an answer on whether they </p>
<p>would extend the former security agreement.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> Prime Minister Maliki’s Political Adviser </p>
<p>said that legal advice was that the Council of Ministers could not do so; the Council of </p>
<p>Representatives must agree. </p>
<p><b>474. </b> In the absence of an agreement, Mr McDonald proposed that four naval trainers </p>
<p>and one naval operational commander should be appointed as naval attachés to the </p>
<p>British Embassy. Their names had already been submitted through the normal process. </p>
<p>Mr McDonald “emphasised this was a key point for us, this matter was entirely in GoI </p>
<p>hands, and the signal sent by this would be serious in our eyes”. </p>
<p><b>475. </b> On 18 August, Mr Hutton’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Brown’s Assistant Private </p>
<p>Secretary with an update on the defence agreement.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> He explained that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government had made it clear they were not prepared to offer an interim agreement and </p>
<p>that all military personnel except five liaison officers in Kuwait had returned to the UK. </p>
<p>US teams would take over the UK tasks in approximately late September, but would step </p>
<p>aside if the UK/Iraq agreement was signed in October. </p>
<p><b>476. </b> Mr Prentice had discussed bringing UK activity at Umm Qasr under NATO </p>
<p>auspices with the US commander, who was enthusiastic provided it did not breach the </p>
<p>300-person ceiling allowed by the NATO-Iraq agreement. As a result:</p>
<p>“We are now working with the US to identify the minimum number of UK personnel </p>
<p>required to do the training task. If the UK/Iraq defence agreement fails to have its </p>
<p>third reading by mid-October, US commanders will then go to the Iraqi Defence </p>
<p>Minister and invite him to decide whether to incorporate the Umm Qasr activity </p>
<p>permanently under NATO (using UK trainers) and accept compensating reductions </p>
<p>elsewhere in the NATO establishment.”</p>
<p><b>477. </b> The Private Secretary added: “Defence Secretary is content with this approach </p>
<p>provided that the Government of Iraq explicitly agree and that other NATO allies are </p>
<p>also content.” </p>
<p><b>478. </b> Mr Brown spoke to Prime Minister Maliki on 23 August, and said that the defence </p>
<p>agreement was “unfinished business which we trusted could be resolved”.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki indicated his support, but suggested that the Iraqi Parliament’s actions </p>

<p><b>September/October 2009</b></p>
<p><b>479. </b> In early September, Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief of Staff informed Mr Wilks that </p>
<p>diplomatic status for the five-man naval team had been approved.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>480. </b> On 15 October, Mr Prentice reported to the FCO in London that the UK-Iraq </p>
<p>“training and maritime support agreement” had completed its third and final reading </p>
<p>in the Council of Representatives.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> It passed with 99 votes in favour and 40 against </p>
<p>or abstaining. </p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Prentice wrote:</p>
<p>“All the elements of our broad-based relationship are now in place. Symbolically, the </p>
<p>ratification by the Iraqi parliament of this agreement confirms the will of a majority of </p>
<p>Iraqi political groups to continue a special relationship with the UK, including in the </p>
<p>security field.”</p>
<p><b>482. </b> He concluded:</p>
<p>“We are well-placed to be a prime partner for Iraq, as overall security improvements </p>
<p>and Iraq’s slowly growing political and economic capacity enable it for the first time </p>
<p>in the last six years to begin to fulfil its vast potential.”</p>
