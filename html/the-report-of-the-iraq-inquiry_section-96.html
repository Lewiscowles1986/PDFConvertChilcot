<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision to withdraw UK forces from Basra Palace, including the </p>
<p>development of the negotiations to ensure a safe exit and UK plans for the </p>
<p>future deployment of its troops;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s role in the transition to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC) in Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s relationship with the Iraqi Government, including steps to safeguard the </p>
<p>legal status of UK forces, and responses to the Charge of the Knights in Basra. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and reform of its security sector, </p>
<p>covered in Sections 10 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>June 2007: The Brown Government</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> Mr Gordon Brown succeeded Mr Blair as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007. In his </p>
<p>new Cabinet he appointed Mr David Miliband as Foreign Secretary and Mr Douglas </p>
<p>Alexander as International Development Secretary. Mr Des Browne remained in post as </p>
<p>Defence Secretary. Baroness Scotland became the Attorney General.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> Mr Brown also reorganised the structure of Cabinet Committees, as is usually the </p>
<p>case when a new Prime Minister takes office. Iraq fell within the remit of the Committee </p>
<p>on National Security, International Relations and Defence (NSID), and specifically its </p>
<p>Overseas and Defence Sub-Committee (NSID(OD)). </p>
<p><b>6. </b> Mr Brown spoke to President Bush on the telephone shortly after he arrived at </p>
<p>No.10.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Mr Brown said that he believed there were a number of ways forward in Iraq </p>
<p>and looked forward to further discussions with the President, including by continuing </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s practice of holding regular video conferences. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that he had talked to President Bush both before and </p>
<p>after becoming Prime Minister about the UK’s future plans for Iraq, making clear the </p>
<p>commitment to “finish the job” in Basra: </p>
<p>“Over time we would be reducing the number of troops but only as the Iraqis were </p>
<p>capable of taking control of law and order … And he was perfectly satisfied with what </p>
<p>we were doing … We had a series of phone calls as well during the summer of 2007 </p>
<p>as we developed this new strategy …”</p>

<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>8. </b> On 27 June, at the request of the MOD, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) </p>
<p>considered the state of the Iraqi Security Forces (see Section 12.1 for more detail on </p>
<p>Security Sector Reform).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. Work is under way in Prime Minister Maliki’s government to develop a national </p>
<p>security strategy, but it is unlikely to make a difference to Iraq’s security as long </p>
<p>as the government remains factionalised and fails to make progress on national </p>
<p>reconciliation … </p>
<p>“II. Policy incoherence is exacerbated by a plethora of competing and ineffectual </p>
<p>committees operating with little central co-ordination …</p>
<p>“III. The army continues to develop slowly … [Quality] varies markedly between units </p>
<p>and there are still serious systemic problems: leadership is weak; under-manning </p>
<p>remains common; logistic support is poor; many units lack key items of equipment.</p>
<p>“IV. The local Iraqi Police Service is at best ineffective. In many areas the police are </p>
<p>synonymous with militia or insurgents … Corruption is endemic. Many police are </p>
<p>probably unreformable.”</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The JIC also considered that in the “likely event of serious intra-Shia fighting the </p>
<p>police would probably take sides … and the army would try to remain on the sidelines”. </p>
<p>In Anbar, locally-raised Sunni tribal units had been successful in reducing violence, but </p>
<p>it was “unrelenting” in Baghdad, Diyala and other mixed provinces around the capital. </p>
<p><b>11. </b> The JIC assessed that: “In the absence of a significant reduction in the threat, </p>
<p>the Iraqi security forces will be unable to cope” without combat support from the </p>
<p>Multi-National Force (MNF) well beyond February 2008.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> On 29 June, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary provided him with an update on Iraq.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Attached to it was a note described as:</p>
<p>“… draft new language, which you may want to use at PMQs [Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>Questions] … which aims to strike a realistic, more downbeat, tone on the situation </p>
<p>in Iraq and to put the onus for positive change firmly on the Iraqi Government.” </p>
<p><b>13. </b> The update characterised Iraqi politics as “tense and obstructed” and complicated </p>
<p>by tensions between the Sunni and other groups. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> In the South, the note said, the situation remained “difficult” but the appointment </p>
<p>of a new police chief, Major General Jalil, and a new head of the Basra Operations </p>
<p>Command, General Mohan, was good news. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The Private Secretary reported concern within the military “that the UK Battlegroup </p>
<p>deployed in Maysan province, primarily to cover the huge border with Iran, is not </p>
<p>achieving any military effect”. Officials were working on a paper “on the issues </p>
<p>around (and implications of) moving out of the Basra Palace site, and security </p>
<p>transition in the South”.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> At Cabinet on 29 June, Mr Browne described three separate incidents involving </p>
<p>British forces in Basra the previous day and observed that British forces were facing </p>
<p>the brunt of violence in South-East Iraq.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Cabinet expressed sympathy for the soldiers </p>
<p>and their families. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Dominic Asquith, British Ambassador to Iraq, reported on 29 June that Sunni </p>
<p>distrust of the political process was becoming increasingly focused on Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki personally.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> Despite this “atmosphere of mistrust”, discussions were continuing </p>
<p>among the parties on restructuring the government around an Executive Council </p>
<p>(consisting of the President, two Vice Presidents and the Prime Minister) and a </p>
<p>moderate front involving five partners.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Asquith noted that there was a disconnect between the US and Iraqi approaches </p>
<p>to the political process. Iraqis were arguing that the parties needed time to build trust </p>
<p>while the US saw that process halting progress towards achieving their most pressing </p>
<p>benchmarks: political agreement to the draft Hydrocarbons Law</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> and revenue sharing </p>
<p>arrangements. Mr Asquith commented:</p>
<p>“Managing this disconnect will require maintaining the focus on discrete elements of </p>
<p>the programme that might be salvageable:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the benchmark legislation, including a return to the de-Ba’athification draft, </p>
<p>which I shall be discussing further with the Americans;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the constitutional review, on which we are in discussion with the CRC </p>
<p>[Constitutional Review Committee] chairs …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing the schedule of Executive Council meetings with the aim of </p>
<p>securing agreement at least on how it will operate;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>proceeding with preparations for provincial elections.”</p>

<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>

<p><b>Terrorist incidents in London and Glasgow</b></p>
<p>On 29 June 2007, two cars containing gas canisters, explosives and nails were found in </p>
<p>central London, one outside a busy nightclub on Haymarket.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The following day, two men drove a blazing car into the main terminal building at Glasgow </p>
<p>airport.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> The airport was evacuated and flights suspended. </p>
<p>After a meeting of COBR, the Government’s emergency committee, Mr Brown raised the </p>
<p>UK threat level for international terrorism to ‘Critical’, its highest level. </p>
<p>SIS5 told the Inquiry that one threat to the UK came from people, from a range of </p>
<p>backgrounds, who had been radicalised and motivated by what they had seen reported </p>
<p>about Iraq.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> In SIS5’s view, the attacks in London and Glasgow in June 2007 fell into </p>
<p>that category. </p>
<p><b>July 2007</b></p>
<p><b>19. </b> The security situation in Baghdad remained a cause for concern. On 1 July, </p>
<p>Mr Asquith observed that, while the number of some events (for example, suicide </p>
<p>attacks) had gone down, “public perceptions from polls and our own informal </p>
<p>soundings … remains sharply negative”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> Lieutenant General Graeme Lamb, the Senior British Military Representative – Iraq </p>
<p>(SBMR-I) reported that there was “much relief” that a planned march, organised by </p>
<p>supporters of Muqtada al-Sadr, had been called off.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> Lt Gen Lamb considered that, had </p>
<p>the march gone ahead, there would have been a “major sectarian clash” the impact of </p>
<p>which might have been a “terminal challenge” to the Iraqi Government and to “the ability </p>
<p>of the coalition forces to affect the outcome”. Work was in hand to “understand exactly </p>
<p>how and whose political pressure was brought to bear” in calling off the march.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Jon Day, MOD Director General Operational Policy from August 2007 to </p>
<p>October 2008, told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“… there were contacts between the UK and the Sadrists in Basra from the spring of </p>
<p>2007, and that as a result of this continuing dialogue, a series of – I think I prefer to </p>
<p>use the word “understandings” were reached with core elements of the Sadrist JAM </p>
<p>[Jaysh a-Mahdi] militias in Basra. These understandings ran from mid-June 2007 </p>
<p>and they therefore pre-dated and were separate from the national JAM cease-fire in </p>
<p>late August.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Mr Day considered that the UK had a number of motives for entering into a dialogue </p>
<p>with JAM:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to contribute to the coalition’s overall outreach effort to groups involved in </p>
<p>violence, in line with what was happening with Sunni groups further north;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage mainstream JAM (who it was believed were “looking for a way out </p>
<p>of violence”) to move towards a commitment to democracy, particularly with the </p>
<p>provincial elections expected in 2008;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to drive a wedge between the mainstream JAM core (who were nationalists and </p>
<p>believed to be “reconcilable”) and the largely Iranian-sponsored JAM Special </p>
<p>Groups (who were following an Iranian agenda);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage a reduction in the level of violence, to make time for the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army to develop its capability to enable it to confront the unreconciled militias </p>
<p>successfully; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to reduce the threat to UK and other coalition forces.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The process of seeking Ministerial agreement for continued dialogue with </p>
<p>an individual (JAM1) was interrupted by the formation of the new government </p>
<p>(see Section 9.5), and had to be re-started in early July. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> On 2 July, an official working closely with the military reported:</p>
<p>“HMA [the British Ambassador to Iraq] and SBMR-I … judge that US and GoI </p>
<p>[Government of Iraq] will reject the deal. </p>
<p>“To summarise a lengthy and detailed discussion: SBMR-I repeated that he could </p>
<p>see some of the opportunities offered by [JAM1]. As such he would like to be able </p>
<p>to write supportive comments on a submission. But as the submission currently </p>
<p>stood – he would have to comment that he did not believe that either the GoI nor US </p>
<p>would support the proposal. He was concerned that this would lead to Ministers not </p>
<p>agreeing the submission, and would like to avoid this if possible.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Although he could see the benefits of reducing indirect fire (IDF) and allowing </p>
<p>transition to PIC to happen, US views reportedly remained a major concern for </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lamb because:</p>
<p>“… such a deal in the South would represent an about-turn of the policy that had </p>
<p>only months ago convinced them to establish [another operational body]. In short the </p>
<p>suggestion of a no-strike agreement in the South was at loggerheads with the active </p>
<p>targeting policy conducted against Iranian proxies by MNF-I [Multi-National Force – </p>
<p>Iraq] and MNC-I [Multi-National Corps – Iraq] elsewhere in Iraq.” </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Minute official working closely with the military, 2 July 2007, ‘New [NAME OF OPERATION] </p>
<p>Submission: […]’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Lt Gen Lamb was reported to be concerned that “we might be giving up broader </p>
<p>strategic interests for the future of Basra” and that this would be seen as “a hollow </p>
<p>victory, gained for fixed British rather than strategic interests”. He therefore suggested </p>
<p>either holding the submission back and continuing discussions with JAM1 to better </p>
<p>define the options, or re-writing it to focus on broaching the issue with the US and Iraqi </p>
<p>Government as an initial objective. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> The official concluded:</p>
<p>“In sum, both HMA and SBMR-I believe the deal struck needs to be tougher; that </p>
<p>it is not clear to them to what extent control of Basra will be handed over to JAM; </p>
<p>that there will be serious reservations over the release of ‘red’ detainees without a </p>
<p>better deal being struck, and that neither [General David] PETRAEUS [Commanding </p>
<p>General MNF-I] or the GoI will agree to the proposal as it currently stands.”</p>
<p><b>28. </b> On 3 July, Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Brown’s Foreign Policy Adviser, spoke to </p>
<p>Mr Stephen Hadley, the US National Security Advisor, by telephone.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> Mr McDonald said </p>
<p>that Mr Brown’s “analysis of the situation on the ground would be tough; he was likely to </p>
<p>stress the importance of Maliki and his government improving their performance”. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Air Marshal Stuart Peach, Chief of Defence Intelligence, briefed the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 3 July that it was “unlikely that ISF [Iraqi Security Forces] would have sufficient </p>
<p>capacity to assume responsibility for security across Iraq by February 2008, in </p>
<p>accordance with current plans”.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary advised the Iraq Senior Officials Group on 3 July </p>
<p>that he had “indicated that he would stick broadly to the strategy outlined by Mr Blair </p>
<p>in February”, but was keen that there should not be a significant gap between the </p>
<p>handover of Basra Palace and transition to PIC.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Mr Brown was currently occupied with </p>
<p>domestic and counter-terrorism issues but would address strategies for both Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan soon. </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that his focus was on the area of Iraq for which the UK </p>
<p>was responsible: </p>
<p>“… my determination was that we created the context in which Iraqis, that is the </p>
<p>people of Basra, had more control over their own affairs. So we had to build up the </p>
<p>training of the Iraqi forces and the training of the Iraqi police, and we did that …</p>
<p>“Then we had to make sure that local government elections took place, so that </p>
<p>there was some stability … And then we had to do something about economic </p>
<p>development … So through … 2007 … we were planning what we called </p>
<p>‘overwatch’, where we would move from what was called ‘tactical overwatch’, </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>where we were there as the forces but Iraqis were involved in the maintenance of </p>
<p>stability and law and order; and then we would move to what we called ‘operational </p>
<p>overwatch’, which gave the Iraqis far more control themselves of their own affairs; </p>
<p>and we moved then to ‘strategic overwatch’, which is what we eventually did, </p>
<p>where we stood back, the Iraqis had control of their own security but we had a </p>
<p>re-intervention capability if it was at all necessary.”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, visited Baghdad and </p>
<p>Basra from 1 to 3 July.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> In Basra, Major General Jonathan Shaw, General Officer </p>
<p>Commanding Multi-National Division (South-East) (MND(SE)), told ACM Stirrup that </p>
<p>he was confident the conditions set for PIC had been met; there was little military </p>
<p>advantage in retaining a presence at Basra Palace with the exception of retaining a base </p>
<p>for strike operations and for situational awareness. Maj Gen Shaw therefore advocated </p>
<p>relocating to Basra Air Station at “the earliest practicable point”. ACM Stirrup agreed, </p>
<p>observing that only “in extremis” would UK forces then re-enter the city, and then only </p>
<p>in support of the Iraqi Army. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker, US Ambassador to Iraq, remained </p>
<p>“circumspect” on the timing of PIC in Basra. They considered that there remained </p>
<p>“significant problems” associated with “unstable politics” and “JAM infiltration” and </p>
<p>advocated the need for “a few ‘wins’” before formal transfer. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> ACM Stirrup told them that the violence in Basra was “all about money and power, </p>
<p>rather than sectarianism” and he considered that UK forces vacating the city centre </p>
<p>could undermine the level of Iranian influence in the city. He argued that:</p>
<p>“PIC represented a catch 22 situation in which it was difficult to demonstrate the </p>
<p>ability of the provincial authorities to assume responsibility for security without </p>
<p>having handed over responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Robert Tinline, Deputy British Consul General in Basra, briefed ACM Stirrup that </p>
<p>the UK had “done as much as we can in Basra” and reported that although General </p>
<p>Mohan wanted UK forces out of Basra City he did not want full PIC. </p>
<p><b>36. </b> Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, Chief of Joint Operations, briefed the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff on 3 July that General Mohan:</p>
<p>“… appeared to have formed a clear, objective and accurate assessment of the </p>
<p>security and social situation in Basra, which chimed with the UK’s position. He </p>
<p>believed that the MNF-I presence distorted the loyalties of Basrawis and supported </p>
<p>Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC) as a precursor to turning Iraqi nationalism against </p>
<p>malign Iranian influence.”</p>

<p>189</p>
<p><b>37. </b> In his weekly update on 5 July, Maj Gen Shaw reported on the meeting between </p>
<p>General Mohan and ACM Stirrup, who had concluded that “this was an individual with </p>
<p>a plan” and that it was mainly coherent and well considered.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Maj Gen Shaw explained:</p>
<p>“Mohan’s vision regarding Shia reconciliation cites MNF as a distorting factor for </p>
<p>Iraqi nationalist loyalties … Mohan is quite resolute in what he believes is the </p>
<p>solution: MNF to adopt a <i>de facto</i> PIC overwatch posture, moving out of the city but </p>
<p>able to provide support and training as required. This will allow him to harness the </p>
<p>motivation and mindset of the fundamentally nationalist population, a violent minority </p>
<p>of which is currently distracted by the MNF ‘occupiers’ and mark those who work for </p>
<p>MNF as collaborators. Mohan recognises that security in Basra cannot be achieved </p>
<p>by military means alone and wishes to focus on Shia reconciliation with an aspiration </p>
<p>to utilise Shia Iraqi Nationalism to drive a wedge between mainstream/nationalist </p>
<p>JAM and militant JAM, exposing its Iranian proxies and tackling the longer term </p>
<p>Iranian threat … his focus on the will of the people is one I fully support …”</p>
<p><b>39. </b> But Maj Gen Shaw cautioned:</p>
<p>“What is unclear is how … we will retain situational awareness should we, as he </p>
<p>suggests, leave the city. Until PIC our <i>de jure</i> responsibility for security remains; </p>
<p>keeping ISF as the first line of response is compatible with moving out of Basra </p>
<p>Palace, and we have, as directed since February, successfully de-linked PIC and </p>
<p>BP [Basra Palace] in the US and GOI planning, the UK driver being strategic </p>
<p>sustainment. To re-link PIC and BP on the basis of the tactical advantages of a </p>
<p>BP presence risks compromising our stated strategic position and might provide </p>
<p>a US hook for our posture that we might regret … The PJCC [Provincial Joint </p>
<p>Co-ordination Centre] however provides us with situation awareness … of the city, </p>
<p>something I am loathe to give up as long as <i>de jure</i> PIC responsibility remains. </p>
<p>Nonetheless today my preference is to move from the PJCC and BP at the same </p>
<p>time. But this is fluid … This whole Basra posture is a bargaining chip to get Mohan </p>
<p>to support Basra PIC in August. For wider reasons I am prepared to accept the </p>
<p>risk of security responsibility for Basra without troops in BP/PJCC for two months. </p>
<p>Longer than that and the risk of my successor being exposed rises; in this case, </p>
<p>strategic top cover might be required to protect our reputation with the US …”</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported his assessment that for the past month Basra had met the </p>
<p>conditions for PIC set by Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, Commander MNC-I. </p>
<p>He considered that this argued strongly for Basra being granted PIC in July, though he </p>
<p>had picked up some US and Iraqi concern about this timeline:</p>
<p>“The Iraqis, having finally taken Basra security seriously, may wish to see new </p>
<p>security structures … For the US, I sense that a reluctance to take risk, and a desire </p>

<p><b>41. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that:</p>

<p>didn’t own the turf … We owned the troop levels, and I was still trying to hang on </p>
<p>to that. The Iraqis suddenly owned Basra Palace, and then it was the Iraqis and </p>

<p>“Clearance to proceed is sought urgently, as the opportunity for negotiations with </p>
<p>JAM will not remain open indefinitely.”</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The advice was not explicit about what would constitute “satisfactory terms” for such </p>
<p>an agreement, but recorded that JAM1 had “insisted” on the release of two detainees </p>
<p>at the start of the month and asked for suspension of MND(SE) strike operations for the </p>
<p>duration. He was likely to seek the release of two further detainees at the end of the </p>
<p>month but would be given “no guarantee on these releases at the outset”. The advice did </p>
<p>not say what level of reduction in JAM violence would be considered to be satisfactory. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> The senior official recommended that the discussions should proceed. He reiterated </p>
<p>the background information provided by a colleague on 20 June about the trial cease-fire </p>
<p>and subsequent discussions (Section 9.5), and reported views from UK officials in Iraq:</p>
<p>“From the local perspective, GOC MND(SE) and HMCG [the British Consul General] </p>
<p>Basra strongly support moving to the next phase (i.e. the release of the two ‘orange’ </p>
<p>detainees and initiation of a further, month-long mutual reduction in violence). </p>
<p>HMA and SBMR-I, from their Baghdad perspective, understand the attractions of </p>
<p>engagement with JAM1 but believe that these negotiations need to be considered </p>
<p>in the wider coalition and Iraq context. In particular, they are concerned that the </p>
<p>GoI could be suspicious, and that General Petraeus would want to consider how to </p>
<p>integrate this proposal with wider coalition efforts at engagement, which have been </p>
<p>directed mainly at Sunni elements but include Shia parties and groups. SBMR-I </p>
<p>states that any suspension of strike activity in Basra Province and the release of </p>
<p>the two ‘red’ detainees would require General Petraeus’ consent (since US forces </p>
<p>in reality operate independently in MND(SE)). SBMR-I warns that General Petraeus </p>
<p>would be unlikely to agree to suspend US strike operations in MND(SE). SBMR-I </p>
<p>and HMA also suggest … drive a harder bargain with JAM1, limiting the cease-fire to </p>
<p>Basra City (rather than the whole Province), and insisting he take responsibility for </p>
<p>stopping EFP [Explosively Formed Projectile] attacks as well as mortar and rocket </p>
<p>attacks (which otherwise would require MND(SE) strike action in response).”</p>
<p><b>47. </b> The senior official explained that if Mr Miliband agreed, Lt Gen Lamb would brief </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus and the Iraqi Government. Subject to their views, and “further negotiation” </p>
<p>with JAM1 on terms, the two “orange” detainees would be released to trigger the </p>
<p>month-long reduction of violence. During that month there would be discussion of further </p>
<p>detainee releases. The senior official wrote that conduct of the discussion would be </p>
<p>agreed be between GOC MND(SE), SBMR-I, the British Consul General in Basra and </p>
<p>the British Ambassador to Iraq, and that Mr Richmond, Mr Bowen and VAdm Style in </p>
<p>London would consult Ministers as appropriate. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Risks of the proposal were that the Iraqi Government would reject and react badly to </p>
<p>it (judged to be “significant”); that Gen Petraeus would reject it; that divisions within JAM </p>
<p>could be used as an excuse for continued attacks in Basra; that the talks would prompt </p>
<p>attacks from other groups, who saw them as a threat to their position in Basra; and that </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>the media might find out and present the arrangements as a symptom of weakness </p>
<p>in MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>49. </b> The senior official reported that Mr Asquith had commented:</p>
<p>“The political context for securing GoI and US agreement to this proposal is </p>
<p>unhelpful. Maliki’s relationship with Muqtada and JAM is at an all time low … </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tawafuq’s suspension of participation in cabinet threatens the end to </p>
<p>Maliki’s government, though this may take time to unravel.</p>
<p>“As for the US side, they remain convinced we are looking for a quick exit from </p>
<p>Basra. They expect us to respect the conditionality required for PIC but will be likely </p>
<p>to see this proposal as an attempt by us to create ‘security stability’, for just enough </p>
<p>time to justify withdrawal.</p>
<p>“In the case of Anbar/Sunni tribal engagement, Petraeus wants MORE than cease-</p>
<p>fires … He is looking for evidence of a commitment to support the political process. </p>
<p>Moreover he would not see the deal with [JAM1] as being analogous to Anbar, </p>
<p>where the locals are actively collaborating with the US against the ‘bad guys’. </p>
<p>He will be very aware, also, of the risk that the [JAM1] releases will merely move </p>
<p>out of MND(SE) AOR [Area of Responsibility] to attack US forces elsewhere.</p>
<p>“That is why I will continue to argue for tougher conditions in the proposed deal </p>
<p>with [JAM1]:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>The coalition should additionally make clear that strike operations will </p>
<p>continue against JAM where evidence exists that individuals are about to/</p>
<p>planning to commit IDF and EFP attacks. </p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>We should be very careful to avoid giving [JAM1] any grounds to expect the </p>
<p>release of the ‘red’ detainees as an inevitable part of this deal. We should </p>
<p>therefore say that in circumstances in which attacks halt against coalition </p>
<p>forces chances of releases obviously significantly improve.”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Lt Gen Lamb was reported to have said:</p>
<p>“I support the continuation of an engagement dialogue with [JAM1], with a view </p>
<p>to exploring opportunities to reduce the level of violence in Basra, and indirect </p>
<p>attacks in particular. The proposal as it stands seeks a level of support from GOI </p>
<p>and MNF-I which should not be assumed at this early stage, however; furthermore </p>
<p>it suggests a level of commitment to [JAM1] which is unreasonable, I believe, </p>
<p>given the uncertainty of [JAM1]’s authority across a most complicated and multi-</p>
<p>militia environment … The Iranian influence, interference and control are cause for </p>
<p>continued concern; thus a restriction on manoeuvre and strike operations at tactical, </p>
<p>operational and strategic levels would be unwelcome at this stage.”</p>

<p>But you would only be authorising discussion at this stage (and MOD officials </p>

<p>28</p>
<p> He welcomed the recent </p>

<p>progress towards transition to Iraqi control of security. Mr Brown said that he would like </p>
<p>to discuss the scope for economic initiatives (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Prime Minister Maliki said that he hoped it would be possible to reduce the burden </p>
<p>on UK forces and for Iraqi forces to take the lead within three months. He hoped that UK </p>
<p>forces would support this and not seek to take the lead themselves. It was important for </p>
<p>the new Iraqi military commander in Basra to establish his authority, not least because </p>
<p>Iraqi forces would soon have to take action against “troublemakers” there. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> The weekly Iraq update for Mr Brown on 6 July set out the range of views on </p>
<p>transition to PIC in Basra:</p>
<p>“Maliki seemed content with a target date of September, which would allow greater </p>
<p>progress on Iraqi Security Forces’ readiness. US Ambassador Crocker and General </p>
<p>Petraeus were very negative about early transition to PIC, without a significant effort </p>
<p>to embed new Iraqi security strictures and visible political progress.</p>
<p>“Both General Mohan and … Mowaffaq Al-Rubaie [Iraqi National Security Adviser] </p>
<p>focused on the advantages of early handover.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>56. </b> The update also said:</p>
<p>“There have been some signs … of a ‘cease-fire’ in Basra. But this can be overdone. </p>

<p><b>57. </b> On 8 July, Lt Gen Lamb reported that there were increasing signs of progress in </p>
<p>Anbar province, where the Sunni “Awakening” was gaining momentum, and slowly </p>
<p>shifting the security situation against Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> Lt Gen Lamb commented </p>
<p>that the engagement was significant, but there remained risks for each of the four </p>
<p>partners engaged in the process:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For the Iraqi Government, there were concerns about being able to control </p>
<p>locally-employed security forces, of which a large proportion were Sunni; the </p>
<p>question of whether, and how, to integrate the “Awakening” movement within </p>
<p>the Iraqi Security Forces was to remain a matter of debate in the months ahead </p>
<p>(see Section 12.1).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The tribes and former Sunni insurgents wanted to be sure that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government would support them and that the MNF would remain in Iraq long </p>
<p>enough to reduce the threat from AQ-I, at least to a point that AQ would be </p>
<p>unable to return in any strength. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a risk for the MNC-I of being fixated by short-term gains and failing to </p>
<p>manage the longer-term expectations of the tribal forces being raised.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More widely for the coalition, there was concern that the developments in Anbar </p>
<p>might lead to federalism or too great a degree of provincial independence, </p>
<p>creating a risk that Iraq would fragment.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> On 8 July, Mr Asquith reported that he had raised the renewal of the UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolution governing the coalition’s activity in Iraq with Mr Hoshyar Zebari, Iraqi </p>
<p>Foreign Minister, and Vice President Adel Abdul Mehdi.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Zebari said the Iraqi Government would want to include in that resolution “a </p>
<p>commitment to the start of a coalition drawdown and the perspective of long-term </p>
<p>security arrangements with the coalition”. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> Vice President Mehdi said the problem with resolution 1723 (2006) was “the limits </p>
<p>it imposed on GoI authority and Iraqi sovereignty”. Another way would have to be found </p>
<p>of giving coalition forces cover for operations in Iraq. </p>

<p><b>62. </b> Mr Brown discussed Iraq with President Bush by video link on 9 July.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> Mr Brown </p>
<p>commented that the Iraqi Government was making slow progress. Faster action was </p>
<p>needed on the Hydrocarbons Law and on “democratisation”. Mr Brown indicated his </p>
<p>intention to talk to Prime Minister Maliki regularly, and that he hoped to persuade him to </p>
<p>work with the Executive Group. </p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr McDonald told the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) on 9 July that contacts with the </p>

<p>33</p>
<p> Mr Brown’s </p>
<p>instincts were reported to be “to keep close to the US”.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> The ISG also discussed a paper on leaving Basra Palace. The question of when </p>
<p>departure should happen was not resolved, but the Group concluded that “ideally, there </p>
<p>should not be a large gap between leaving Basra Palace and moving to PIC”. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr McDonald told the ISG that NSID(OD) was provisionally scheduled to meet for </p>

<p>34</p>
<p> Although IDF was the most prevalent form of attack, the </p>

<p>was more dangerous and caused the most casualties. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that Maj Gen Shaw:</p>

<p>awareness, reducing our ability to conduct strike operations or intervene to provide </p>
<p>security. However, such contingencies were to be conducted only <i>in extremis</i>. A </p>
<p>successful withdrawal from Basra was predicated on the engagement of Iraqis, </p>

<p> He attributed the UK’s early failures </p>
<p>in Iraq to insufficient resources being applied to help with economic reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> In advance of the NSID(OD) meeting planned for 19 July, Mr Bowen advised </p>
<p>Mr Browne that there were indications that No.10 was keen to use it to reach a </p>
<p>decision in principle on the UK’s longer-term engagement in Iraq. An announcement </p>
<p>would then be timed for late September, after the report to Congress by Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>and Ambassador Crocker.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>70. </b> Mr Bowen reported that it had also been suggested that the withdrawal from </p>
<p>Basra Palace should be delayed to the same timescale, and be wrapped up in a single </p>
<p>announcement. Mr Bowen recognised that this was a “seductive picture” but there were </p>
<p>“substantial risks” that Mr Browne would want to weigh:</p>
<p>“To begin with, there could be real problems in linking the Basra Palace decision to a </p>
<p>much bigger decision on the UK presence as a whole. First … keeping a substantial </p>
<p>presence in the Palace longer than is militarily necessary could, and probably would, </p>
<p>cost lives and injuries. Second, leaving it until after the Crocker/Petraeus report will </p>
<p>not necessarily make it any easier to handle with the US … </p>
<p>“The bigger problem is how we handle the very significant political fall-out that would </p>
<p>follow a decision and announcement of UK terms for MND(SE). There is a serious </p>
<p>risk of major damage to US/UK relations across a range of security issues … </p>
<p>Moreover, we run the risk of undermining our trustworthiness as a close ally with the </p>
<p>permanent organs of the US state and armed forces in a way which would do lasting </p>
<p>damage to our security … interests.</p>
<p>“Ironically enough, it could easily be that by the autumn, the US political picture </p>
<p>could have changed sufficiently to make it less difficult for us to make such </p>
<p>a decision/announcement by doing it in a way which goes with the grain of  </p>
<p>US/coalition planning. The problem with reaching a decision next week is that:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>it is difficult to see how the PM could not tell the President …</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>although we might plan to delay any announcement … there is a strong </p>

<p>“IV. Sadr’s relationship with other Shia political figures is equally fraught. Rivalry </p>
<p>is particularly intense with ISCI [Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq], reinforced by </p>
<p>a long standing dynastic feud. But neither side appears willing yet to risk Shia </p>
<p>unity by forming an alternative alliance. ISCI and others in the Shia United Iraqi </p>
<p>Alliance (UIA) are also nervous of Sadr’s ability to mobilise mass support to general </p>
<p>widespread disorder. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“VI. Sadr uses violence as a political tool. He probably also has to accept some </p>
<p>JAM violence to maintain its cohesion and his popular support. However, Sadr will </p>
<p>try to calibrate anti-coalition attacks and prevent any return to large-scale sectarian </p>
<p>conflict. To date he has intervened quickly to prevent intra-Shia violence from </p>
<p>escalating: if he cannot prevent it, he will try to exploit it.”</p>
<p><b>74. </b> The JIC judged that al-Sadr’s relationship with Iran was “complex”, he had “spent </p>
<p>much of this year in hiding in Iran”, but he and the Iranians were “likely to remain </p>
<p>uncomfortable partners”. </p>
<p><b>75. </b> The JIC assessed that al-Sadr was also motivated by “a genuine desire to see </p>
<p>improvements in the quality of life for his core constituency among Iraq’s Shia poor”. </p>
<p>Popular appeal would make the Sadrists well placed to take seats on local councils in </p>
<p>future provincial elections, in which they would be participating for the first time. The JIC </p>
<p>assessed that JAM would be used to intimidate the Sadrists’ rivals and the electorate.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Members of the House of Commons Defence Select Committee visited Iraq from </p>
<p>8 to 11 July, focusing particularly on the UK military role in Basra, transition timing, the </p>
<p>consequences of UK withdrawal and the readiness of the ISF.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>77. </b> Mr Asquith reported that during a visit to Basra the Committee had asked their </p>
<p>Basrawi interlocutors about the current security situation in the city and the likely </p>
<p>consequences of a UK withdrawal within 12 months:</p>
<p>“The Basrawis were clear: services and reconstruction were improving but the </p>
<p>main problem was that the ISF were under-funded, unqualified and security was </p>
<p>deteriorating. The British Government had promised a lot when it liberated Iraq, </p>
<p>but had not delivered. Militias were more of a concern than criminal gangs. The </p>
<p>provincial authorities were not able to confront the militias because the security </p>
<p>forces owed their loyalty to political parties rather than the State … Pulling no </p>
<p>punches, they said a British withdrawal would ‘be followed by chaos sweeping the </p>
<p>province like a hurricane’.”</p>
<p><b>78. </b> The Committee asked Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus about whether </p>
<p>UK forces had a continuing role in Basra. They both made clear that conditions should </p>
<p>determine the force numbers, not timelines. The continued presence of UK forces was </p>
<p>necessary for security stabilisation, capacity building with the ISF and to allow the </p>
<p>political situation with the Governor to be resolved. This should allow Basra to make the </p>
<p>transition to PIC by the end of the year and, as bases were closed or handed over, UK </p>
<p>troop numbers could fall. It was essential that Basra Palace was handed over without it </p>
<p>becoming a JAM Party HQ, to demonstrate that Basra was stable enough for PIC.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Asquith reported that Prime Minister Maliki had told the Committee that Basra </p>
<p>would be ready for PIC in August or September. He did not think that UK military support </p>
<p>would be required for much longer, and considered that there would be no effect from </p>
<p>UK withdrawal in 12 months.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> In advance of the NSID(OD) meeting planned for 19 July, FCO and MOD officials </p>
<p>produced a joint paper setting out the latest “assessments and plans on security </p>
<p>transition and the associated re-posturing and drawdown of UK troops in Basra”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>81. </b> The paper had been discussed, in draft, at the ISG on 9 July, which considered that </p>
<p>there should not be a large gap between leaving Basra Palace and moving to PIC.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The paper set out a series of key judgements: </p>
<p>“</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It is likely that debate in Washington about the results of the ‘surge’ </p>
<p>[see Section 9.5] will result in an announcement this autumn that US troop </p>
<p>draw down will begin either late in 2007, or in early 2008;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The best way forward for us remains sticking to the transition strategy we have </p>
<p>consistently followed, and handing over the fourth and last province in our </p>
<p>sector, Basra, to Iraqi security control this autumn;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The final decision on when Basra should be transferred to lead Iraqi security </p>
<p>control lies in Iraqi and US hands. The actual handover will take place at the </p>
<p>earliest in September; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Thereafter, our engagement in Southern Iraq will move into a distinct new phase. </p>
<p>Our effort is already reaping diminishing returns. This trend will accelerate once </p>
<p>we move into ‘Overwatch’ mode in Basra. The threats we face will remain. Our </p>
<p>ability to deliver military and civilian effect will be limited both by the security </p>
<p>environment and Iraqi appetite for UK support. We therefore believe that we </p>
<p>should see the period of ‘Overwatch’ lasting for a matter of months, not longer;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sustaining our presence at Basra Palace and the Provincial Joint Co-ordination </p>
<p>Centre is already putting our forces at very high risk. The strong military </p>
<p>recommendation is that we do not remain at these sites for any longer than is </p>
<p>necessary. But before we leave Basra Palace, a robust Iraqi security force must </p>
<p>be in place to prevent looting;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When we leave Basra Palace, we will need to leave the Provincial Joint </p>
<p>Co-ordination Centre too (meaning no UK presence in the city).”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>83. </b> The paper provided an assessment of progress against the UK’s objectives in Iraq:</p>
<p>“Four years on … we have achieved only some of our objectives. Iraq has the forms </p>
<p>of democracy: a new Constitution … a freely elected Parliament … a Government </p>
<p>of National Unity … On paper, Iraq has the machinery of Government in place, and </p>
<p>security forces over 350,000 strong (Police 160,000, Army 157,000).</p>
<p>“But behind these outward signs of progress lie deep-seated problems. The </p>
<p>constituent parts of the Iraqi Government are not working together in pursuit of a </p>
<p>genuine national unity agenda. Lip service is paid to the need for reconciliation </p>
<p>between Iraq’s main communities, notably between Shia and Sunni Arabs …</p>
<p>“There has been little progress on the major political issues that have divided Iraqis </p>
<p>since 2003: the Constitution (in particular the degree to which Iraq should be a </p>
<p>federal state); the management of the oil &amp; gas sector and how its proceeds should </p>
<p>be distributed; the extent to which former members of the Ba’ath Party should be </p>
<p>excluded from public life. </p>

<p>Paper FCO and MOD, 12 July 2007, ‘Iraq: Transition in Basra’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>“… The loyalties of key institutions to the Iraqi state is mixed at best. Some </p>
<p>40 percent of the Iraqi Police Service is thought to owe loyalty to militias linked to </p>
<p>political parties. Other security bodies … have become personal militias for Ministers </p>
<p>or Provincial Governors.”</p>
<p><b>84. </b> In relation to the impact of the US surge, the paper said it had:</p>
<p>“… so far delivered mixed results. The US military has been taking the fight </p>
<p>to AQ-I … US troops are getting into areas … they have not been in for some time. </p>
<p>But US commanders are worried that the Iraqi Security Forces are not up to the </p>
<p>job of holding onto the ground they have won – suggesting that the security gains </p>
<p>from the surge may prove unsustainable when US troop levels begin to reduce.”</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The paper also explained:</p>
<p>“One consequence of the surge and benchmarks has been that the earlier shared </p>
<p>US/UK emphasis on transferring security responsibility to the Iraqis has been </p>
<p>sidelined in favour of a short-term focus on improving security.</p>
<p>“General Petraeus … and his staff now believe transition was happening too quickly </p>
<p>in 2006 – indeed that the previous coalition strategy represented a ‘rush to failure’.”</p>
<p><b>86. </b> As a result, the context in which transition in Basra was being considered had </p>
<p>changed:</p>
<p>“The US are more, not less risk-averse. They are intensely nervous about transition </p>
<p>in Basra. They believe the local Iraqi Security Forces are not robust enough to </p>
<p>handle security without our direct support. They see pervasive, malign Iranian </p>
<p>influence. And even the Iraqi Government, who had earlier been pressing for </p>
<p>transition, has recently been more ambivalent.</p>
<p>“The US fear that the handover of the last province in the UK sector will signal a </p>
<p>UK decision to withdraw entirely from Iraq in the near future, precipitating similar </p>
<p>moves by other coalition members. And they fear that doing this in August would </p>
<p>pose significant risks for the credibility of their attempt in September to persuade </p>
<p>Congress to extend the surge.”</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The paper explained the process and conditions that needed to be met to achieve </p>
<p>PIC, and said:</p>
<p>“One further important consideration has informed our (but not US) thinking about </p>
<p>the timing of PIC … is about the balance of risk in retaining or handing over security </p>
<p>responsibility. Do we assess that we have reached the stage where the benefits </p>
<p>of retaining security responsibility are outweighed by the downsides? It there any </p>
<p>prospect that by holding on, we can hope either to effect further positive change, </p>
<p>or to provide the time needed by the Iraqis to meet the challenges themselves?”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>88. </b> The paper reported that Maj Gen Shaw considered that Basra was ready for PIC </p>
<p>and had made that recommendation to the MNF command. Lt Gen Odierno had turned </p>
<p>down the proposal, arguing that the new Basra security and leadership structures </p>
<p>needed time to demonstrate positive progress; he thought PIC in October might be </p>
<p>achievable, based on a decision in September. The paper said: </p>
<p>“… we will need to continue to hold Iraqi and US feet to the fire if we wish to achieve </p>
<p>PIC in the autumn … </p>
<p>“The risk … remains that if we try to force a positive decision in the teeth of US </p>
<p>opposition and lukewarm Iraqi attitudes, we will reinforce the American belief that we </p>
<p>are doing so for political reasons, driven by our desire to reduce UK troop levels.”</p>
<p><b>89. </b> The paper explained that the next key decision for Ministers was the timing of the </p>
<p>withdrawal from Basra Palace, the “most heavily mortared and rocketed place in Iraq”. </p>
<p>That was complicated because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Withdrawing from Basra Palace “will mark <i>de facto</i> handover of responsibility” </p>
<p>to the ISF; re-intervention by UK forces from the Air Station would happen only </p>
<p>in extremis. A gap of a month or two between withdrawal and PIC “should be </p>
<p>manageable” but a “significantly longer gap would put UK forces in a difficult </p>
<p>position: responsible for security in Basra City, but unable to deliver it except at </p>
<p>high risk”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The potential for an upsurge in violence surrounding the withdrawal, and the </p>
<p>impact that might have in Washington in the run-up to Gen Petraeus and </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker’s Congress hearing in September.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risk of looting – “it would be disastrous for our reputation if our departure </p>
<p>were followed by the sort of looting at Basra Palace which happened at bases </p>
<p>in Muthanna and Maysan provinces after we handed them to the Iraqis”. It was </p>
<p>therefore essential that a credible ISF guard force was in place before the UK </p>
<p>could withdraw.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The impact on the UK’s Security Sector Reform (SSR) effort in Basra, currently </p>
<p>co-ordinated from the PJCC, where 100 UK troops and seven UK police </p>
<p>advisers were based. The threat to these staff if there were no significant </p>
<p>MND(SE) presence at Basra Palace would be impossibly high because “there </p>
<p>would be no quick way to get reinforcements to the site or to evacuate UK </p>
<p>personnel in an emergency”. As a result, the paper concluded that a withdrawal </p>
<p>from Basra Palace would mean closing the UK base at PJCC, and so halting </p>
<p>SSR work and losing “situational intelligence within Basra City”. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> Considering the scope for the UK to make a contribution to Basra’s development </p>
<p>in the period beyond PIC, the paper observed that the situation was likely to remain </p>
<p>challenging. UK activity within Basra was “already heavily circumscribed” by both the </p>
<p>security situation and the willingness of the population to engage with UK personnel. </p>
<p>This was likely to increase after PIC. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The paper said that there was “no coalition-agreed blueprint” for how long the </p>
<p>post-PIC “overwatch” phase should last, observing: “The US has not addressed this in </p>
<p>earnest, in part because they see themselves maintaining a significant military presence </p>
<p>in Iraq for years to come (and tend to assume we will do likewise).” </p>
<p><b>92. </b> The paper continued:</p>
<p>“But … we already face a clear trend toward diminishing returns from our efforts in </p>
<p>Southern Iraq across the board. This is bound to accelerate when we withdraw from </p>
<p>Basra City … </p>
<p>“So we do not believe the ‘overwatch’ period in Southern Iraq should be envisaged </p>
<p>as lasting more than a matter of months from the date of PIC in Basra …</p>
<p>“Our planning should assume that the UK civilian presence in Basra will have to </p>
<p>be wound up shortly before the removal of the UK military envelope which enables </p>
<p>it to operate (though if the US were to decide to move a military presence of their </p>
<p>own to Basra Air Station, and to retain a US civilian presence, we could expect US </p>
<p>pressure for us to maintain some sort of ongoing commitment to the Basra Provincial </p>
<p>Reconstruction Team).”</p>
<p><b>93. </b> The paper recommended early engagement with the US on a renewed political </p>
<p>strategy, including a “change of Iraqi Government” and setting a date for coalition troop </p>
<p>withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> In the longer term, the FCO and the MOD suggested that the UK would need to </p>
<p>examine its “core interests in Iraq … the assets at our disposal, and the likely major </p>
<p>ongoing US commitment”. Those core interests were likely to be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preventing AQ from establishing a base in Iraq from which to attack UK interests;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining Iraq’s territorial integrity and deterring intervention by its neighbours; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preserving the stability of the region, and preventing disruption to energy </p>
<p>supplies.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The paper argued for “a long-term UK commitment in Iraq”, which might include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>niche contributions to the US-led fight against AQ-I or in conducting air strike </p>
<p>operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the Iraqi Navy in ensuring the security of the Northern Gulf and the </p>
<p>protection of key Iraqi oil infrastructure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>influencing the Iraqi Government and supporting the long-term development of </p>
<p>its capacity, in particular through the provision of advice to central government </p>
<p>Ministries in Baghdad; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>developing a bilateral defence relationship with the Iraqi Government.</p>

<p><b>96. </b> In his weekly update on 13 July, Maj Gen Shaw reported that:</p>
<p>“Gen PETRAEUS considers himself to be the approval authority for PIC in Basra, </p>
<p>he will personally make the decision when the conditions are right, and currently he </p>
<p>does not consider that we are even close.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Gen Petraeus was reported to be nervous about the readiness of the ISF to assume </p>
<p>full security responsibilities. As a consequence:</p>
<p>“Given that the ISF are unlikely on their own to be sufficient to deliver security </p>
<p>in Basra, the onus will be on the GoI to develop its confidence in its full suite </p>
<p>of governmental/Shia levers and then to over-ride US advice and seize PIC as </p>
<p>is their right.”</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Maj Gen Shaw felt that the Iraqi Government would need “encouragement” to do </p>
<p>so as “no shift in US attitude is expected before September, and one is not certain </p>
<p>even then”.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Maj Gen Shaw took the opportunity to discuss prospects for PIC in Basra with </p>
<p>Lt Gen Odierno and Gen Petraeus during the Corps Conference on 14 July.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>reported that Lt Gen Odierno had been “upbeat” and saw the South as “an area in which </p>
<p>risk should be taken”. On PIC, Lt Gen Odierno considered that it would be important </p>
<p>to give the new structures time to bed in before transferring security to them, to give </p>
<p>the Iraqis the best chance of success. Gen Petraeus was clearly focused on how his </p>
<p>September “Honest Assessment” to Congress would be received and relayed US </p>
<p>political concerns about possible UK announcements on troop numbers beforehand. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw commented:</p>
<p>“What came across strongly from both Gen Petraeus and Lt Gen Odierno was an </p>
<p>acceptance of our respective force level and political constraints; but no acceptance </p>
<p>yet of the limitations of the utility of MNF, and the differences in the utility of our </p>
<p>respective forces, derived from the difference in the challenges we face. There is </p>
<p>still no agreed coalition prognosis of the future … Persuading MNC-I and MNF-I that </p>
<p>our projected force plans are justified by the conditions on the ground represents a </p>
<p>major challenge … it remains a hard sell.”</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported that Gen Mohan presented his initial report on the </p>
<p>security situation in Basra to the Iraqi Ministerial Committee on National Security </p>
<p>(MCNS). He painted a bleak picture: insufficient manning and equipment in the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army, a corrupt police force, 24 heavily armed militias backed by Iran and organised </p>
<p>Mafia-style criminality. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported that Gen Mohan had “stated categorically … that the </p>

<p>motivation for the current Sadrist attacks. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported that he had commissioned a piece of work from the </p>
<p>Southern Iraq Steering Group on what the South might look like after the MNF left. </p>
<p>The conclusions were, in his view, optimistic for the long term; “the macro drivers are </p>
<p>positive, but the micro issues will be messy in resolution”. He sent a copy to MNC-I and </p>
<p>MNF-I headquarters and to the Permanent Joint Headquarters as a contribution to what </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw hoped would be a piece of JIC work on the same subject, to enable </p>
<p>political judgements to be taken on the basis of a fully informed assessment.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> On 15 July, Lt Gen Lamb reported that Gen Mohan and Maj Gen Jalil’s focus on </p>
<p>Basra had brought a degree of “much needed clarity to the situation”.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> He suspected </p>
<p>that a recent IED attack on Maj Gen Jalil had been the work of an Iranian-backed JAM </p>
<p>Special Group, “wishing to stop what they see as an unwelcome interference in their </p>
<p>affairs down in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted, at their meeting on 17 July, that “it was clear from </p>
<p>discussion at the MCNS that Iraqi priorities would lie in establishing security for </p>
<p>Baghdad and Diyala; security to enable PIC for Basra would need to compete with </p>
<p>these higher priorities”.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>105. </b> On 17 July, the Iraq Policy Unit sent a minute to Mr Miliband, in preparation for the </p>
<p>NSID(OD) meeting on 19 July.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> It said that there were arguments for sticking with the </p>
<p>plan to hand over in August:</p>
<p>“Chiefs of Staff are clear that the cost in casualties of maintaining a presence at the </p>
<p>Palace far outweighs the operational effect. The troop reductions … are also needed </p>
<p>in order to ensure the sustainability of our deployments in Afghanistan.” </p>
<p><b>106. </b> However, because of the difficulties in intervening within the city of Basra from the </p>
<p>Air Station, the IPU recognised that: </p>
<p>“… reposturing from the Palace would represent <i>de facto </i>PIC. The prospect of </p>
<p>this taking place several months ahead of <i>de jure</i> PIC is uncomfortable. We would </p>
<p>continue to be formally responsible for security, while in reality having very little </p>
<p>control.”</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Although the US Administration was likely to be “nervous” about the prospect of </p>
<p>the UK leaving Basra Palace, and the consequent reduction in troops, the FCO’s view </p>

<p>the US was: </p>
<p>“… likely to expect ‘overwatch’ in the South to be delivered through a long-term (one </p>
<p>year plus), substantive UK military commitment … This is at odds with much UK </p>
<p>military thinking … The military does not want an open-ended commitment, with our </p>
<p>forces at BAS [Basra Air Station] confined to carrying out a limited range of training </p>
<p>tasks for the ISF while exposed to continuing high levels of rocket and mortar fire. </p>
<p>They believe we should enter overwatch with a clear plan for its nature and duration: </p>
<p>effectively, a timetable for withdrawal.”</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The IPU reported that the impact on civilian activity in Basra City would be </p>

<p>47</p>
<p> They reported that “the </p>

<p>Iraqi population in a new role. The US was not simply going to ‘stay the course’.”</p>
<p><b>110. </b> Mr McDonald told his US interlocutors that:</p>
<p>“… the UK objective was not to change its posture in Iraq until September. </p>
<p>There was no difference between the approach of Gordon Brown and that of his </p>
<p>predecessor. But the Government was under huge pressure to move after that, </p>
<p>and to get ahead of the US. We needed to manage our own transition in a way that </p>
<p>worked for Iraq, and worked for Transatlantic relations.”</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Reflecting on the report of Mr McDonald’s visit, Maj Gen Shaw observed that </p>

<p>hesitated: the situation was too delicate to predict; a spike in unrest in Basra would </p>
<p>be most unwelcome … Hadley said he hoped there would be no announcement </p>
<p>about departure before the Prime Minister and President discussed Iraq when they </p>
<p>met at the end of the month.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>113. </b> On 17 July, Mr McDonald sent a minute to Mr Brown in advance of the planned </p>
<p>NSID(OD) meeting on 19 July.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> He explained that when Ministers agreed in February </p>
<p>that in principle the military should withdraw from Basra Palace, it had been assumed </p>
<p>that a residual presence would be retained at the Warren site to maintain situational </p>
<p>awareness and to continue training and mentoring. As the FCO and MOD paper </p>
<p>explained, the deteriorating security situation meant that it would no longer be possible </p>
<p>to do that. Accordingly, the UK’s ability to re-intervene successfully if required would be </p>
<p>“greatly diminished”. </p>
<p><b>114. </b> Although the previous planning assumption had been for a significant UK presence </p>
<p>in MND(SE) for most of 2008, Mr McDonald wrote:</p>
<p>“… given the serious questions about our ability to deliver either security or </p>
<p>significant training or mentoring programmes post-PIC in Basra, those assumptions </p>
<p>now look unrealistic. And the significant risks to our forces are likely to outweigh the </p>
<p>security or other benefits derived from keeping them in Iraq. In these circumstances, </p>
<p>there is a case for planning for the withdrawal of the majority of British troops from </p>
<p>Southern Iraq to a much more rapid timetable.”</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Mr McDonald argued that if the UK withdrew from Basra City in August as planned, </p>
<p>very shortly afterwards there would be a need to explain to the US that UK would be </p>
<p>withdrawing from MND(SE) altogether in spring 2008, meaning that “we would hit the US </p>
<p>with unwelcome news twice at a politically sensitive time”. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Alternatively, if the UK were to delay withdrawal until September, it would be </p>
<p>possible to present both “unwelcome message[s]” to the US simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>119. </b> Dr Rubaie asked Gen Mohan to pull together all his requirements into a formal </p>
<p>plan, “copied to MOD and MOI [Ministry of the Interior] to enable them to attempt to </p>
<p>resource it”. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> On 19 July, the Assessments Staff reported to Mr McDonald on the probability </p>
<p>that JAM in Basra would consider the coming UK withdrawal from Basra Palace as a </p>
<p>significant victory and use it to intensify attacks until UK forces were driven out of Iraq.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p>JAM appeared confident of being able to take control of Basra City soon and felt no </p>
<p>need to negotiate with Iraqi or UK authorities. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr McDonald prepared further advice on transition for Mr Brown on 20 July.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He advised that the overwatch phase, conducted from Basra Air Station, should be </p>
<p>time-limited from the outset. He estimated that withdrawing the majority of UK forces </p>
<p>and moving to a purely training mission in Basra would take around six months. </p>
<p><b>122. </b> Once withdrawal from the Air Station was complete, the UK “would have to </p>
<p>persuade the Americans to house and protect our training forces”, possibly in Dhi Qar </p>
<p>province, where Australian and Romanian training teams were already operating from </p>
<p>a US base. Mr McDonald proposed that the UK should continue its other contributions </p>
<p>to the wider Iraq theatre (a “niche contribution” to action against AQ-I in Balad, a naval </p>
<p>deployment in the Gulf and a contribution to air strike operations). </p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr McDonald said that his proposals had not been discussed with government </p>
<p>departments but he judged the military would support them “because they are keen </p>
<p>to get out of Basra and MND(SE) but see the importance for alliance reasons of </p>
<p>maintaining a presence in 2008”. President Bush was unlikely to be pleased but the rest </p>
<p>of the US Administration “see that things are changing”. Mr McDonald judged:</p>
<p>“Only the Iraqis can fulfil the key task of political reconciliation. It seems that they </p>
<p>won’t feel the necessary pressure to get on with the job until the coalition begins </p>
<p>to leave; and, as they try to do that job, they will need continued training and </p>
<p>mentoring. This plan would be compatible with that.”</p>
<p><b>124. </b> The weekly Iraq update for Mr Brown on 20 July said that in Basra “a downbeat </p>
<p>assessment of the security situation means that Provincial Iraqi Control is unlikely before </p>
<p>October/November”.</p>

<p><b>125. </b> Maj Gen Shaw and government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 </p>

<p> At the meeting JAM1 noted the success of the trial cease-fire from 15 to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>cost him credibility with JAM, making additional detainee releases essential to enable </p>
<p>him to re-assert control. As well as the two “orange” detainees whose release he had </p>
<p>previously requested, he therefore asked for two “red” detainees to be released and said </p>
<p>that this was a pre-condition for the start of the month-long cease-fire. </p>
<p><b>126. </b> A senior government official reported that: “Despite this hardening of his position </p>
<p>[JAM1] maintained he was still committed to a negotiated de-escalation of violence with </p>
<p>MNF-I in Basra Province.” He wrote that all of the detainees held by MND(SE) would </p>
<p>have to be released at some point, meaning that: “Obtaining a quid pro quo for detainee </p>
<p>releases while we still have detainees to release is a factor in the equation.”</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that in this conversation with JAM1 it was interesting </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“… his motivations entirely agreed with mine. He wanted the place to prosper. </p>
<p>He was a strong Iraqi nationalist.”</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>128. </b> A government official who worked closely with the military told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>JAM1’s “motivations were, of course, wholly different” from the UK’s.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>129. </b> On 25 July, at the request of the FCO, the JIC assessed AQ-I’s external ambitions, </p>
<p>its relationship with AQ core and other groups, and the threat it posed to the UK.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. The relationship between the Pakistan-based Al Qaida (AQ) senior leadership </p>
<p>(‘AQ core’) and Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I) remains complex: AQ core can exert </p>
<p>influence but has not succeeded in controlling AQ-I. AQ core and AQ-I view Iraq </p>
<p>as the major theatre for jihad, presenting a realistic opportunity to gain control of </p>
<p>ungoverned space; their intent remains to use this space to launch terrorist attacks </p>
<p>elsewhere in the region and beyond.</p>
<p>“II. Significant pressure from intensified Multi-National Force (MNF) activity, the </p>
<p>success of the Sunni tribal groups against AQ-I, the death of AQ-I leader Zarqawi </p>
<p>and the adverse publicity for AQ-I’s Amman bombing may all have helped deter AQ-I </p>
<p>from mounting the sustained campaign of external attacks envisaged by AQ core: </p>
<p>it has not launched an attack from Iraq since November 2005. AQ core now wants </p>
<p>AQ-I to concentrate firmly on Iraq as the immediate strategic priority.”</p>
<p><b>130. </b> The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“The investigation into the attempted bomb attacks in London and Glasgow last </p>
<p>month has revealed … links between the two attackers – Bilal Abdullah and Kafeel </p>
<p>Ahmed – and known Iraq-based extremists … At this stage there are no indications </p>

<p>that Iraq-based extremists played any role in the direction or planning of the </p>
<p>attacks. But the war in Iraq may have been a factor in the radicalisation of the </p>
<p>two attackers …”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Under the heading “Prospects”, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“For the immediate future AQ-I will continue to focus their attentions on Iraq: we </p>
<p>judge they will attempt to intensify operations in the lead up to the September </p>
<p>Congressional report in the US. AQ-I will aspire to conduct external operations – </p>
<p>including in the UK – if an opportunity arises; we judge, at least in the short term, </p>
<p>they will look for AQ core endorsement of any major plans outside of Iraq. We </p>
<p>judge AQ-I will be able to resist pressure from the MNF and the Iraqis into 2008. </p>
<p>As the MNF presence diminishes, AQ-I will seek to regain lost ground, establishing </p>
<p>firm bases in Sunni areas and using them increasingly to reinvigorate its external </p>
<p>attack capabilities.”</p>
<p><b>132. </b> On 25 July, Lieutenant General William Rollo, who had succeeded Lt Gen Lamb as </p>
<p>SBMR-I, sent a minute to ACM Stirrup recording his first impressions “after spending a </p>
<p>month getting my head round this vast and multi-faceted operation”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>133. </b> Lt Gen Rollo identified the key challenge as “to convert tactical into operational and </p>
<p>strategic success”. The inability of Prime Minister Maliki to pass critical legislation and </p>
<p>to spend money in provinces where Government control had been limited both raised a </p>
<p>“risk of reversal”. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> Lt Gen Rollo continued:</p>
<p>“The South, conversely, and in marked contrast to the situation three years ago, </p>
<p>looks more problematic. Shia infighting between JAM and Badr, ineffective and </p>
<p>corrupt governors, divided loyalties within the ISF, and infiltration/proxy war by IRGC </p>
<p>[Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps] have all degraded governance and the GOI’s </p>
<p>view had changed over the last eight months from disinterest and complacency … </p>
<p>to concern, particularly over Basra.”</p>
<p><b>135. </b> In relation to timing of the handover of Basra Palace and subsequently of transition </p>
<p>to PIC, Lt Gen Rollo did not detect “untoward concerns”, but observed that “we need to </p>
<p>have plans robust enough to cope with whatever events unfold”. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> Officials specialising in the Middle East sent briefing on Iraq for Mr Brown to No.10 </p>
<p>on 26 July.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> The briefing said that recent reporting suggested that JAM viewed UK plans </p>
<p>to withdraw from Basra as a victory and believed that they were on the verge of taking </p>
<p>control of Basra. The brief recorded that JAM intended to continue attacks on Basra Air </p>
<p>Station until UK forces had completely left Iraq. </p>

<p>210</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Under the heading “National Reconciliation”, the brief reported that government </p>
<p>officials working closely with the military were continuing to work on initiatives to split </p>
<p>and isolate Iranian special groups from criminal and nationalist elements of JAM, in </p>
<p>an attempt to reduce attacks on MND(SE) and counter Iranian influence in Iraq. It was </p>
<p>suggested that “elements of JAM are encouraged by recent detainee releases and </p>
<p>would consider negotiating a cease-fire”. </p>
<p><b>138. </b> In his weekly update on 26 July, Maj Gen Shaw commented that the US </p>
<p>suggestion that the UK should retain a presence in Basra Palace in order to avoid giving </p>
<p>the impression that JAM and Iran had triumphed was “both risk averse but also a recipe </p>
<p>for UK remaining in its current posture and force levels”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>139. </b> Maj Gen Shaw argued that such an approach would preclude “the middle ground </p>
<p>of harnessing latent Iraqi nationalism, allowing the Shia Iraqis to sort their internal </p>
<p>problems out for themselves”. There was no news from the US commanders in Iraq </p>
<p>about whether or not they would agree to UK withdrawal from Basra Palace in the </p>
<p>timescale proposed, beyond Gen Petraeus making clear that the decision on the </p>
<p>readiness of the Palace Protection Force was for him to take.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Maj Gen Shaw cautioned against assuming that silence from the US indicated </p>
<p>assent.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> The Assessments Staff reported to Mr McDonald on 26 July that the number </p>
<p>of attacks had remained steady at just over 900 in the preceding week.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Indirect fire </p>
<p>attacks by Shia militias had continued against Basra Air Station and Basra Palace, </p>

<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They agreed that Mr Brown’s line to take at a forthcoming press conference should be </p>
<p>that the final decision had not yet been taken but that the UK would not leave Basra </p>
<p>Palace until military commanders were satisfied that the necessary conditions for </p>
<p>departure had been met. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> Those conditions were that the Iraqi forces were able to protect the compound and </p>

<p><b>145. </b> Pressed by Mr McDonald on the size of the UK’s training contribution, ACM Stirrup </p>
<p>characterised it as “whatever is necessary to carry out whatever tasks are decided”. </p>
<p>But those troops would need to rely on US life support as there would be no UK force </p>
<p>protection. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> ACM Stirrup had suggested that Mr Brown should tell President Bush that the UK </p>
<p>was “prepared to provide some hundreds, provided the tasks are there”. Mr McDonald </p>
<p>observed that ACM Stirrup “was clearly reluctant to provide over 500”.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Mr Brown discussed Iraq with President Bush at Camp David on 30 July.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>meeting note drafted by Mr Brown’s Private Secretary recorded only that Mr Brown </p>
<p>welcomed the common ground between himself and President Bush on Iraq and had </p>
<p>outlined the UK’s proposals for a “development agency” in Basra. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> During the visit, Mr Brown and President Bush also met privately over dinner and </p>
<p>breakfast. Over dinner they “discussed the progress in the provinces overseen by the </p>
<p>UK now moving to overwatch” but the content of the discussion was not recorded. </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr McDonald provided Mr Brown with a substantial ‘Steering Brief’ on Iraq for the </p>
<p>Camp David meeting.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> In it he wrote that, on the Iraqi political process:</p>
<p>“Bush is habitually optimistic about the prospects. But in reality, the picture is </p>
<p>bleak. The political process is not delivering even gradual progress, as we hoped </p>
<p>it would …”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr McDonald wrote that the US surge had delivered mixed results, and that doubts </p>
<p>over ISF capability raised concerns about the sustainability of the gains which had </p>
<p>been made. In Basra, it was important that PIC should happen before November, when </p>
<p>the next roulement of troops would take place, but Gen Petraeus was believed to be </p>
<p>sceptical about the ability of the local ISF to handle the city’s security. </p>
<p><b>151. </b> In a press conference after the meeting on 30 July, President Bush told reporters </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“There is no doubt in my mind that Gordon Brown understands that failure in Iraq </p>
<p>would be a disaster for the security of our own countries, that failure in Iraq would </p>
<p>embolden extremist movements throughout the Middle East, that failure in Iraq </p>
<p>would basically say to you know people sitting on the fence around the region that al </p>

<p><b>153. </b> At the end of July, Lt Gen Rollo commented to ACM Stirrup that Lt Gen Lamb’s </p>
<p>“energy and initiative acted as a catalyst for a marked change in the coalition </p>
<p>approach”.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Lt Gen Rollo saw the various strands of work (including engagement with Iraqi </p>
<p>tribes, with those close to the Sunni insurgency and with Shia militias) developing at </p>
<p>different speeds but the rate at which the Sunni were joining the fight against AQ-I </p>
<p>continued to accelerate and showed no sign of abating. The challenge, in Lt Gen Rollo’s </p>
<p>view, was “no longer how to inspire such ‘awakenings’ outside Anbar, but how to manage </p>
<p>the flood”. He commented: </p>
<p>“The future is all about turning engagement into reconciliation. Much effort is going </p>
<p>into the reintroduction of governance and economic assistance in Al Anbar, as a </p>
<p>way of further emphasising the advantages of returning to the GoI fold … This is </p>
<p>essential to limit the chances of regression, but will only probably go so far without </p>

<p>Mr Asquith whether the UK was ready to continue to provide operational support for the </p>

<p>withdrawal from the government. </p>
<p><b>161. </b> On 2 August, Mr Asquith reported a “political crisis” in Iraq and that “real progress </p>
<p>[is] only possible if Maliki addresses Sunni security concerns – and that means ceding </p>
<p>some authority in an area he views as his sole preserve”.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>162. </b> Following the resignations by Tawafuq Ministers a “leadership summit” was </p>
<p>planned, covering “legislation, government business (including shared decision making, </p>
<p>reform of the security institutions, militias, detainees and human rights), national </p>
<p>reconciliation (including some form of amnesty …) and establishing a political front”.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Asquith again advised senior Iraqi politicians that “the time for statements of </p>
<p>principles had now passed” and that action was needed, focused on key Sunni concerns </p>
<p>(human rights abuses, detainees and the protection of Sunni areas in Baghdad). </p>
<p>He concluded: </p>
<p>“The prospect is a period of floundering and activity – largely for its own sake – in </p>
<p>the hope that a way will be found to bring Tawafuq back into … government … It </p>
<p>might just work if the effort is directed at taking action on Sunni concerns. But those </p>
<p>are all essentially in the security field …”</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Priorities and timescales following Mr Brown’s visit to the US were discussed </p>
<p>at the Iraq Strategy Group on 2 August.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Mr McDonald reported that Mr Brown had </p>
<p>told President Bush that the UK was planning to leave Basra Palace by 31 August </p>
<p>if Gen Petraeus was content. The key issue would be Iraqi capability to continue to </p>
<p>protect the site.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Mr McDonald told attendees that Mr Brown had stressed the successful transfer </p>
<p>from combat to overwatch in three provinces in his public comments, but had made clear </p>
<p>that there would be no announcement of any further changes to the UK’s posture or </p>
<p>presence in Iraq before Parliament returned from its summer recess on 7 October. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>166. </b> After recess, Mr Brown would want to make a statement setting out “the way ahead </p>
<p>for overwatch and thereafter, this should focus not just on our military engagement but </p>
<p>look at the shape of our overall relationship with Iraq, covering the diplomatic, economic </p>
<p>and development aspects”. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> To do so would require detailed work, but Mr McDonald “stressed the sensitivity of </p>
<p>any discussions, including with the US, in advance of the Petraeus/Crocker testimony” </p>
<p>and instructed that departments “should not actively take forward any work on our </p>
<p>post-PIC military presence” other than exploring “economic deliverables”. </p>
<p><b>168. </b> Officials in the MOD provided advice to Mr Browne on 3 August, setting out the </p>
<p>same background and proposals as in the submission to Mr Richmond and Mr Miliband </p>
<p>on 4 July.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> They said that an early meeting with Gen Petraeus had indicated the </p>
<p>proposal would be a “hard sell” to the US. Gen Petraeus had asked for the views of </p>
<p>Lt Gen Odierno before reaching a view on the proposal himself. The MOD judged that </p>
<p>“Gen Petraeus will need to be persuaded that this initiative will contribute to the longer </p>
<p>term security of Basra rather than being a short-term fix”. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> The advice said that in return for the cease-fire, JAM1 wanted four higher </p>
<p>risk detainees (two of whom were suspected of involvement in the deaths of British </p>
<p>personnel) released, plus a suspension of strike operations against JAM in MND(SE). </p>
<p>Officials asked Mr Browne to agree that MND(SE) should continue to pursue </p>
<p>this initiative, the first stage of which would be to raise the matter with senior US </p>
<p>commanders and Iraqi Government Ministers in Baghdad, with the aim of obtaining </p>
<p>their agreement:</p>
<p>“If US commanders and the Iraqi Government agree in principle, further advice will </p>
<p>be submitted to ministers before any releases take place.”</p>
<p><b>170. </b> On 4 August, Mr Browne gave his agreement over the telephone and two days </p>
<p>later his Private Secretary confirmed it in writing, noting that further advice would be </p>
<p>submitted before any releases took place.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The MCNS discussed Basra briefly on 5 August.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> Mr Abdul Qader, the Iraqi </p>
<p>Defence Minister, gave Prime Minister Maliki a detailed report of his visit to Basra the </p>
<p>previous week. He had been impressed by good co-ordination between Gen Mohan and </p>
<p>Maj Gen Jalil, who were making a positive impact on the security situation and who were </p>
<p>“enforcing law and order on the streets”. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Gen Petraeus’s brief for the MCNS meeting was reported to have predicted a date </p>
<p>in November for transition to PIC in Basra. Governor Waili remained the “sticking point”. </p>

<p><b>173. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported to ACM Stirrup that the security situation in MND(SE) had </p>
<p>been discussed at the MNF Commanders’ Conference on 5 August where Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>described Basra as “complex and difficult”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> Maj Gen Shaw’s “injection of an alternative </p>
<p>view of the Shia south” had prompted “genuine debate”. His view that only MNF </p>
<p>withdrawal would allow the Iraqis to sort themselves out, had drawn:</p>
<p>“… a range of views – not overtly unsympathetic but querying some of the logic </p>
<p>of execution. Petraeus’s own comments were that no-one disputed the wisdom of </p>
<p>drawing down forces in Basra, but how it was done was very important. Fleet St </p>
<p>would not have our nuanced understanding of the situation and it could be presented </p>
<p>as a defeat. We had to make sure that the ISF are adequate, that the Palace was </p>
<p>not taken over and ransacked, that Mohan’s plans were coherent and, thinking more </p>
<p>long-term, that a Hizballah-type organisation did not take over the South.”</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Ambassador Crocker told the Conference that he was:</p>
<p>“… concerned over a failure of governance in Basra in the short term, and wanted </p>
<p>to explore further the potential for the GoI to re-establish itself while we gained </p>
<p>understanding of our own limited control and influence.”</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented:</p>
<p>“Both responses are legitimate and we need to shape both the message and the </p>
<p>substance of our actions.</p>
<p>“We also need to be careful not to seize on aspects of these comments that favour </p>
<p>our own interpretation of potential events. In the short term our ability to hand over </p>
<p>Basra Palace is likely to be assessed by Petraeus and the GOI not only on the state </p>
<p>of the Palace Guard Force but on the overall security situation in Basra. This during </p>
<p>August, which, even without the added potential dynamics of the possible forcible </p>
<p>removal (by the Iraqis) of the Governor or our own withdrawal from the City, is </p>
<p>always a volatile month. In the medium term PIC should be possible in the autumn, </p>
<p>with careful co-ordination with both the Iraqis and MNF(I), better politics in Basra, </p>
<p>including hopefully a new governor, a steady build up of Iraqi security forces and the </p>
<p>isolation and reduction in influence of criminal and Iranian backed JAM. Conversely </p>
<p>a Basra in which JAM have free rein and are busily settling scores with anyone who </p>
<p>either co-operated with us or stands in the way of their own criminal purposes will </p>
<p>provide a much less attractive backdrop to PIC for both the MNF(I) and the GOI. </p>
<p>I mention this not in any way to play Cassandra but because I want to convey a </p>
<p>sense of the range of events that we may have to contend with.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Maj Gen Shaw’s account of the discussion said that Gen Petraeus’ key concern </p>
<p>was the timing and method of withdrawal from Basra Palace, commenting “it must </p>
<p>go well”.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Maj Gen Shaw’s judgement was that the threat to the Palace was low and the </p>
<p>Palace Protection Force would be ready to take over responsibility at the end of the </p>
<p>month. He continued:</p>
<p>“But I detect an increasing chorus of demands for certainty, for an absence of risk. </p>
<p>Let me be explicit – there is no risk-free option. If we go as planned at the end of </p>
<p>the month, we are dependent upon Iraqis both within friendly and enemy forces for </p>
<p>success – they have a vote. This is battle space and it is impossible to prove the </p>
<p>negative that nothing will go wrong if we hand over. And if we stay, there will be the </p>
<p>risk of more deaths. I am working to, and my successor will execute, the plan to </p>
<p>leave by the end of the month.”</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Maj Gen Shaw also reported that the projected date for PIC in Basra had been </p>
<p>deferred again, to a likely announcement in October followed by PIC in November. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw observed that this had implications for the proposed Parliamentary </p>
<p>statement by Mr Brown in early October, which would be much easier if it followed an </p>
<p>announcement about PIC. He reported, “General Petraeus acknowledges that in the end </p>
<p>politics will overcome conditionality”. </p>
<p><b>179. </b> On 9 August, an official in the MOD asked Mr Browne to agree that the release of </p>
<p>the four detainees identified by JAM1 could proceed.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> They explained that after “some </p>
<p>initial reluctance” Gen Petraeus had agreed, as did Gen Mohan and Dr Rubaie. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> The advice said:</p>
<p>“As this is the only currently available plan to try and trigger a step change in the </p>
<p>security dynamics in Basra, there is a good case for proceeding: there is no way </p>
<p>radically to change the position on the ground without accepting some risks.”</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary responded the following day to say that Mr Browne </p>

<p>On 11 August, the Governor and the Provincial Director of Police in Diwaniyah were </p>

<p>81</p>
<p> Lt Gen Rollo commented that the attacks were “unexpected” and </p>
<p>that there was increasing evidence that JAM, using Iranian supplied weapons, was </p>
<p>responsible. The motive for the attacks was unclear. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> A senior government official specialising in the Middle East (1) wrote to the </p>
<p>FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence on 20 August with an update on the </p>
<p>negotiations with JAM1.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> He reported that on 11 August, government officials working </p>
<p>closely with the military met JAM1 “to establish that a deal was still on the table”. JAM1 </p>
<p>confirmed that it was, provided the four nominated detainees were released in advance. </p>
<p>Government officials working closely with the military confirmed that this had been </p>
<p>approved. The senior official recorded that MOD Ministers had given their agreement to </p>
<p>the releases and that they had been discussed in advance with the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>and with Gen Petraeus. </p>
<p><b>185. </b> Another meeting had followed on 12 August, at which JAM1 sought to reassure </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw that the deal would work, although it would take some time to impose </p>
<p>a full cease-fire. Maj Gen Shaw noted that there was widespread scepticism within the </p>
<p>UK, US and Iraqi systems over JAM1’s ability to deliver and his motives. The success of </p>
<p>the initiative would be measured by a significant reduction in IDF and attacks on supply </p>
<p>convoys; and by respect for the ISF’s occupation of Basra Palace. What constituted a </p>
<p>“significant reduction” was not defined. JAM1 warned that there were attacks planned </p>
<p>against the convoys withdrawing from Basra Palace and it would take him 10 to 15 days </p>
<p>to call them off.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> In his own record of the discussion Maj Gen Shaw wrote:</p>
<p>“The meeting exceeded my expectations and left me more optimistic about his intent </p>
<p>and the potential scope of the success this proposal might engender.”</p>

<p>218</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Maj Gen Shaw wrote that he had presented three tests “by which the viability of the </p>
<p>deal might be judged”:</p>
<p>“–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>IDF attacks on COB [Contingency Operating Base] and BP [Basra Palace].</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the safety of convoys from a week’s time re-posturing from BP.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>the safety of BP once it became a GoI property.</p>
<p>“The more he succeeded against these tests, the more he would show that he can </p>
<p>deliver, that this deal works to the advantage of MNF and is no threat, indeed is </p>
<p>supportive of GoI. All of which would give my successor confidence to continue with </p>
<p>the deal.” </p>
<p><b>188. </b> The senior government official reported that JAM1 had made clear that, when </p>
<p>violence reduced, additional detainee releases would be his priority; he would need </p>
<p>releases from across the Basra political and militia spectrum to avoid other groups </p>
<p>disrupting the process.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> He hoped for releases at a rate of 10 to 20 a month. The </p>
<p>transfer of any detainees to US custody would end the initiative: this was a red line. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> The senior official commented that while JAM1’s recognition of the wider political </p>
<p>context in Basra was encouraging, it was tangible improvement on the ground that </p>
<p>would matter. Maj Gen Shaw had established a working group in Basra, to be chaired by </p>
<p>his successor, Maj Gen Binns. The group would meet regularly to review progress and </p>
<p>the talks with JAM1, producing a report to be sent up the MNF-I chain of command to </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus and to Lt Gen Rollo, Mr Christopher Prentice (who would be succeeding </p>
<p>Mr Asquith as British Ambassador to Iraq), the MOD and the FCO. MND(SE) would keep </p>
<p>Gen Mohan informed; Lt Gen Rollo and Mr Prentice would brief the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>“as appropriate”.</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Having seen the update, Lt Gen Rollo was reported to have commented: “I note </p>
<p>the contrast between these negotiations and the situation elsewhere in Iraq where US </p>
<p>policy towards JAM ill-behaviour is one of prompt retribution (while avoiding outright </p>
<p>conflict). This may be mitigated by clear evidence that the process is contributing to </p>
<p>overall stability in Basra.” </p>
<p><b>191. </b> The account of the meeting produced by government officials on the ground </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… the cease-fire for a month on 13 August worked straight away. There was </p>
<p>an immediate falling away of attacks, and it then carried on. It went beyond the </p>

<p>specialising in the Middle East (1) in November 2007, said that the reduction in violence:</p>
<p>“… began on 13 August, on the following terms:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM in Basra would suspend their attacks on the coalition. [JAM1] would </p>
<p>work to bring the Secret Cells under his control and in particular guarantee </p>
<p>a peaceful withdrawal from Basra Palace. MND(SE) would suspend their </p>
<p>detention campaign but would retain the right to strike anyone targeting </p>
<p>coalition forces and to interdict weapons smugglers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MND(SE) released four JAM detainees as requested by [JAM1] to begin the </p>
<p>process of de-escalation. If violence remained low, [JAM1] and MND(SE) </p>
<p>would negotiate a timetable for the eventual release of all MND(SE) </p>
<p>detainees, including [JAM1] himself. Discussions would continue on the </p>
<p>political and development themes, with the aim of JAM and the Sadrists’ </p>
<p>full participation in the political process in Basra. GOC MND(SE) formed a </p>

<p><b>196. </b> On 13 August, a government official working closely with the military commented </p>

<p>how – once the month’s cease-fire period comes to an end. We sense that timing </p>
<p>will be crucial at the end of this period so we will want to be prepared and not waste </p>

<p>which might be lost if it was necessary to try and seek the views of all stakeholders at </p>
<p>each stage:</p>
<p>“[We also need to] consider what next steps we will propose. Part of this will be </p>
<p>giving thought to which of [JAM1]’s 16 detainees we would consider releasing and </p>
<p>which not. If [JAM1] delivers and we see a significant decrease in IDF, it will be </p>
<p>important that we are able to deliver a suitable reward/incentive to him in the form </p>
<p>of further releases … Similarly, if [JAM1] is less-than-successful in delivering a </p>
<p>cease-fire and requests more detainee releases, how will we tweak our proposals </p>
<p>accordingly?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>198. </b> The day after they were released, government officials working closely with the </p>
<p>military reported that two of the former detainees gave radio interviews in Basra.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One interview was believed to have been fairly “banal” but in the other the individual </p>
<p>suggested that releases were part of a cease-fire agreement. </p>
<p><b>199. </b> On 15 August, the same officials sent a note to JAM1 saying that they considered </p>
<p>it unwise for the released individuals to be adopting a media profile and asking “please </p>
<p>could they tone it down a bit”. A telephone conversation with JAM1 followed, in which </p>
<p>he agreed that media appearances were not helpful and would advise “that they should </p>
<p>exercise discretion”. The officials told JAM1 that there had been one IDF attack on Basra </p>
<p>Palace the previous night, to which MND(SE) had responded. JAM1 was surprised at </p>

<p>92</p>
<p> After this point, JAM became “leaderless” and went into 40 days’ </p>

<p>“The enforced lull on both MNF and JAM coincided with the arrival of an Iraqi </p>

<p>Sadr]/JAM who shared our vision of how to resolve the Basra security problem: </p>
<p>re-task nationalist JAM violence away from MNF towards Iran. This political dynamic </p>
<p>has set the context for … operations which have continued … to buy Mohan space </p>
<p>to work on nationalist JAM. Our predicted move from BP by the end of the month … </p>
<p>is consistent with Mohan’s drive to clarify Iraqi nationalist loyalty. This sets the scene </p>

<p><b>201. </b> But the cost had been high:</p>
<p>“With 41 UK deaths so far this year, my command has overseen just shy of one </p>
<p>quarter of the deaths incurred during the entirety of Op TELIC, including the war-</p>
<p>fighting phase. A further 400+ have been injured, of which about half will not return </p>
<p>to service.” </p>
<p><b>202. </b> Maj Gen Shaw wrote that there continued to be uncertainty over whether the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army 10th Division or the Palace Protection Force (PPF) would take over responsibility </p>
<p>for Basra Palace when MND(SE) vacated it.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus favoured the PPF, which </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw considered to be “on track to being capable of taking over by the end </p>
<p>of the month”. Reports indicated that that OMS/JAM had no intent to attack the Palace </p>
<p>once it became Iraqi Government property. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> In his formal end of tour report to Lt Gen Houghton, Maj Gen Shaw reflected on the </p>
<p>possibilities for and constraints on achieving strategic “success” in Iraq:</p>
<p>“The issue of ‘success’ has centred on the unspoken question: Iraqi success or </p>
<p>coalition (US/UK) success? The gap between the coalition’s goals for Iraq and </p>
<p>where we are now has been a constant source of tensions, not just with the press </p>
<p>but in judgements about risk …”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>204. </b> On resources, Maj Gen Shaw reported:</p>
<p>“We have been hamstrung for resources throughout the tour, driven by the </p>
<p>rising strategic significance of the Afghan deployment. The lack of clear Main </p>
<p>Effort between the two theatres made a perpetual struggle of the bidding war for </p>
<p>resources. This tour has reinforced my prior judgement that Iraq has more strategic </p>
<p>significance than Afghanistan although our projected posture in the South is </p>
<p>increasingly questionable.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Despite these constraints, Maj Gen Shaw remained optimistic about the future of </p>
<p>southern Iraq, concluding:</p>
<p>“… Shia unity makes violence in the South self-limiting; Iraqi nationalism will triumph </p>
<p>over Iranian influence; the parties and factions, attracted by financial gain, will </p>
<p>reach an accommodation in the South in a way that allows all to prosper from a </p>
<p>functioning entity.”</p>
<p><b>206. </b> On 16 August, the Iraq Senior Officials Group was told by an MOD official that </p>
<p>handover of Basra Palace and the PJCC were both planned for 31 August, but a delay </p>
<p>of a few days was possible to ensure that the PPF was properly equipped.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The MOD official explained that:</p>
<p>“The current plan envisaged our withdrawal from the PJCC four days before the </p>
<p>handover of the Palace site; but we would leave the PJCC by 31 August whatever </p>
<p>the state of play over the Palace.”</p>
<p><b>208. </b> On 19 August Maj Gen Binns would give his assessment of readiness to </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus, who “continued to take a rational approach” to the UK plans. </p>
<p>Mr Asquith’s farewell calls in Baghdad also suggested Iraqi Government support for </p>
<p>the handover. </p>
<p><b>209. </b> The MOD official wrote that the leadership summit had not yet taken place, </p>
<p>although “all the main players were in town and engaging in bilateral discussions”.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Lt Gen Rollo hoped that it would convene that week.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> He also reported that </p>
<p>there were well-developed plans for Baghdad to take further offensive action against </p>
<p>insurgents in the run-up to the autumn: “Provided the politics can come right, or even not </p>
<p>go badly wrong, there is a clear way ahead.”</p>
<p><b>211. </b> On 16 August, Mr Asquith wrote a valedictory letter to Mr Miliband which </p>
<p>characterised Iraq as “still wracked by the culture of fear, distrust and prejudice, </p>
<p>obstructing political compromise”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>212. </b> Mr Asquith considered that:</p>
<p>“The surge has failed to create the space for politics to work because the military </p>
<p>(tactical) successes (local sectarian security structures loyal to the MNF) conflict </p>
<p>directly with the political objective (inclusive and integrated national Iraqi authority).” </p>
<p><b>213. </b> The letter gave two reasons why each success was accompanied by “further </p>
<p>complications”. First, “knowledge of what is happening on the ground is shockingly thin, </p>
<p>particularly in Baghdad where the theatre policy is decided” which made analysing the </p>
<p>significance of what was known “fragile”. Mr Asquith revealed that: “The [Multi-National] </p>
<p>Force’s statistics on security – or even basic services – differ wildly from what our LE </p>
<p>[locally engaged] staff (and the Iraqi media) report.” </p>
<p><b>214. </b> Secondly, Mr Asquith wrote: “Domestic politics (and media coverage) have </p>
<p>coloured the approach of the whole coalition, producing an ambivalence that has been </p>
<p>corrosive.”</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Asquith considered that the benchmarks set by Congress were unlikely to </p>
<p>reveal anything significant about Iraq because: “The timeframe … has placed impossible </p>
<p>demands on the Iraqi Government and coalition … The lessons of the Constitution have </p>
<p>been forgotten.” </p>

<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Looking to the future, Mr Asquith considered that the coalition would need to </p>
<p>continue to work with the Iraqi Government to increase Sunni engagement in the political </p>
<p>process. The Executive Council was a useful start, but there was also need to address </p>
<p>immediate Sunni concerns about security and human rights issues. This would include </p>
<p>the need to “address much more systematically sectarianism in the ISF … establishing </p>
<p>proper data on abuses and infiltration and ensuring that action is taken”. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> Friction would be reduced as Basra was handed over to PIC, allowing the UK to </p>
<p>make a difference through:</p>
<p>“The high regard Iraqis have for our advice … We also fulfil for them something of </p>
<p>the role of the psychiatrist’s couch, helping them to face their problems. And they </p>
<p>look on us as a key influencer of the US.” </p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr Asquith continued:</p>
<p>“But we will still need to commit resources. I remain of the small school that believes </p>
<p>we should continue to have a reduced military component (beyond some important </p>
<p>niche areas), grouped with other coalition allies in a southern base other than Basra </p>
<p>able to provide rapidly deployable forces to carry out operations at the sharp end.</p>
<p>“Outside the military contribution, our favoured route has been through providing </p>
<p>expertise. That will remain necessary, but insufficient.” </p>
<p><b>219. </b> On the UK’s ability to influence the wider effort in Iraq, Mr Asquith reminded </p>
<p>Mr Miliband that after the UK had handed back Basra:</p>
<p>“The US will still be fighting a war … The test of its and others’ action is how much </p>
<p>they contribute to that war effort … The degree to which we continue to contribute </p>
<p>to that war effort will determine the influence we can bring to bear on US policy on </p>
<p>Iraq. If it concludes we are merely hiding behind its effort and military losses, it will </p>
<p>ignore … our advice … </p>
<p>“Stepping away I do not see as an option.”</p>
<p><b>220. </b> An update sent to Ms Aldred by Mr Tim Dowse, the Chief of the Assessments </p>
<p>Staff, on 16 August said that, overall, the level of violence across Iraq remained </p>
<p>unchanged.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> It was judged that Muqtada al-Sadr had effectively lost control of JAM. </p>
<p>The Assessments Staff considered that this was a reminder that “whatever the interests </p>
<p>of the Sadrists national political leadership, JAM behaviour (including in Basra) is likely </p>
<p>to be determined as much if not more by local factors.”</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 again on </p>
<p>17 August to follow up a letter he had sent.</p>

<p> JAM1 complained that he had been </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>allowed only 10 minutes to speak to the four detainees immediately prior to their release, </p>
<p>rather than the agreed one to two hours. A longer meeting would have allowed him to </p>
<p>emphasise that this was an agreement for the benefit of all the detainees. </p>
<p><b>222. </b> JAM1 said that this was a dangerous period, and there was plenty of potential for </p>
<p>things to go wrong. He had asked his contacts to monitor those whom he suspected of </p>
<p>being active in the Special Groups in order to curtail their attacks.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> The officials reported their meeting with JAM1 to the Steering Group for </p>
<p>the operation, now renamed the Mohan Initiative Group (MIG) and chaired by </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns, later that day. In their report back to London, the officials explained: </p>
<p>“We then discussed the substance of further agreement between MND(SE) and </p>
<p>[JAM1]. We opined that this would come down to the number of detainees to be </p>
<p>released. We would need to release more than four (because [JAM1] would be </p>
<p>looking for progress); he would want us to release as many as possible … GOC </p>
<p>was admirably focused on the timelines for securing all-party sign up to Phase II </p>
<p>(Phase III?) of the [NAME OF OPERATION] agreement. Working backwards, this </p>
<p>looks like this: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>13 Sep – second (third?) tranche of releases</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>12 Sep – final date for sign-off on agreement to releases/DIRC [Divisional </p>
<p>Internment Review Committee]</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>7 Sep – agreement of SOSDEF [the Defence Secretary] secured</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1 Sep – submission goes to SOSDEF</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>28 Aug – submission goes to PJHQ, with US assent</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>21 Aug – GOC travels to Baghdad to meet Odierno and Petraeus.”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry that part of his mindset on arriving in post was:</p>
<p>“I thought – and this was before I knew about reconciliation – that only by engaging </p>
<p>and seeking to reconcile leaders and organisations that possess some degree </p>
<p>of credibility would there be any chance of a solution and that solution would be </p>
<p>political and we would find it and we would meet it in Iraq.”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>225. </b> Having arrived in Iraq, Maj Gen Binns observed that:</p>
<p>“… almost every time we resupplied, the price just to deliver the bread and water </p>
<p>there was a death, and that our impact outside the immediate confines of our bases </p>
<p>was limited and we had become focused on force protection and trying to break the </p>
<p>bones of this amoeba that was called JAM was difficult, if not impossible. I thought </p>
<p>that the Iraqi army and police were standing by and watching us get killed, I thought </p>
<p>that the rate of casualties was amongst the highest in Iraq and that self-protection </p>
<p>and administration was consuming us. I thought the time for the UK was running out. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>I thought, in any counter-insurgency, patience is key and I thought that the UK in Iraq </p>
<p>had lost its patience with Iraq and we were turning to other things like Afghanistan, </p>
<p>so I thought I was running out of time.” </p>
<p><b>226. </b> After being briefed on the negotiations that were under way, Maj Gen Binns told </p>
<p>the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“I had no better idea – set against all the background I’ve just explained, I couldn’t </p>
<p>think of a better idea. So I stepped into it rather than stepped back from it and </p>
<p>I thought it was precisely the right thing to do.”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> On 20 August, Lt Gen Rollo reported that:</p>
<p>“The Presidency Council eventually sat this week amidst huge US frustration at the </p>
<p>alliance between the Kurds and Dawa/ISCI, which appears to have given Maliki a </p>
<p>reason not to compromise.”</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>228. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported that security within population centres was clearly improving </p>
<p>across Iraq, cutting down Al Qaida’s freedom of movement. However, as bomb attacks </p>
<p>in Ninawa against the rural Yazidi population had demonstrated, “it is still all too possible </p>
<p>for terrorists to find poorly policed small towns … which remain intensely vulnerable”. </p>
<p><b>229. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported that “Shia strategy and reconciliation” remained the subject </p>
<p>of “fierce debate” within Baghdad. The Iraqi Government’s committee on reconciliation </p>
<p>had begun to generate proposals for tribal outreach, amnesty and the beginnings of </p>
<p>ideas for an approach to OMS and JAM. Lt Gen Rollo commented: </p>
<p>“Whether these ideas will come to anything, and whether they will do so before </p>
<p>open hostility between Badr and JAM occurs, is wide open to question, but it is </p>
<p>nonetheless of note that they are Iraqi ideas …”</p>
<p><b>230. </b> In Baghdad, Lt Gen Rollo reported that concerns about the situation in Basra had </p>
<p>been “less loudly expressed this week” but that Gen Mohan had been visiting to lobby </p>
<p>for additional resources to ensure that his forces were fully equipped when UK forces left </p>
<p>Basra City. Lt Gen Rollo commented:</p>
<p>“Looking ahead, the British handover of the Palace offers the opportunity to refocus </p>
<p>effort both within an evolving coalition concept of operations and a dynamic and </p>
<p>constantly shifting Shia political outlook. Our aim should remain to leave Basra in the </p>
<p>best possible nick that we can, but there might – and I emphasise might – be more </p>
<p>room for manoeuvre than we had previously feared.”</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Mr McDonald gave Mr Brown a verbal update on progress towards transition </p>
<p>in Basra on the same day, based on an update note prepared by a Cabinet Office </p>

<p>226</p>
<p>official.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> That note said that Maj Gen Binns was still expecting to be able to hand </p>
<p>over responsibility for Basra Palace on 29 August, having written to Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>with his assessment of the PPF’s readiness. Equipment and fuel remained the key </p>
<p>risks to handover. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> On 20 August, at the request of the FCO, a Current Intelligence Group (CIG) </p>
<p>examined the influence of the Iraqi Ba’ath Party on the insurgency and Iraqi politics.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>233. </b> The CIG’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. The influence of the Iraqi Ba’ath Party on the Sunni Arab insurgency is marginal. </p>
<p>The party is fractured with little political relevance or popular support in Iraq; this is </p>
<p>highly unlikely to change.</p>
<p>“II. Iraqi Shia politicans’ fears of a Ba’athist resurgence, however exaggerated, are </p>
<p>genuinely held. They will limit the Shia appetite for reconciliation with the Sunni more </p>
<p>broadly.” </p>
<p><b>234. </b> The CIG judged that many former leaders of the Iraqi Ba’ath Party had been killed </p>
<p>or captured in 2003; others had fled to neighbouring countries:</p>
<p>“Outlawed by the Coalition Provisional Authority, much of the Ba’ath Party’s senior </p>
<p>Sunni cadre (most of the rank and file were Shia) went underground, while the </p>
<p>party’s system of patronage collapsed.”</p>
<p><b>235. </b> In Syria, two former senior Ba’athists (Muhammad Yunis al-Ahmad and </p>
<p>Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri) had established the New Regional Command, loyal to </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein’s execution in December 2006 had exacerbated </p>
<p>rivalry between al-Ahmad and al-Duri, leading to the emergence of two factions </p>
<p>competing for primacy. Those in both factions wanted to see the full restoration of the </p>
<p>party – and themselves – to power in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The CIG judged that few Ba’athists still identified with their original Arab socialist </p>
<p>roots. Although most Ba’athists were fundamentally secular and ideologically opposed to </p>
<p>AQ-I, they were willing to co-operate with Sunni Islamists to attack the coalition and what </p>
<p>they saw as a Shia-dominated Iranian-backed Iraqi government.</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Although much of the insurgency involved former regime officials and members of </p>
<p>the security forces, the CIG judged that most had abandoned Ba’athism. </p>
<p><b>238. </b> Politically, the CIG judged that the Ba’ath Party was “a spent force” which had </p>
<p>little political relevance or popular support in Iraq beyond pockets in former regime </p>
<p>strongholds such as Tikrit: that was “highly unlikely to change”. Nevertheless, many Iraqi </p>

<p>Shia politicians, including Prime Minister Maliki, typically labelled Sunni oppositionists </p>
<p>and insurgents as Ba’athists. </p>
<p><b>239. </b> The CIG judged:</p>
<p>“Shia fears of a Ba’athist resurgence, however exaggerated, are genuinely held </p>
<p>(and are shared, to a limited extent, by the Kurds). We judge they will limit the Shia </p>
<p>appetite for reconciliation with the Sunni more broadly.”</p>
<p><b>Assassination of the Governor of Muthanna</b></p>
<p>On 20 August, Mr Mohammed al-Hasani, Governor of Muthanna province and a Shia, was </p>
<p>killed when a roadside bomb exploded next to his car in Samawah.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>BBC News</i> reported that Mr al-Hasani was a “key figure” in the Badr organisation, which </p>
<p>had “clashed frequently with the Mehdi army militia loyal to Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr for </p>
<p>control of areas in the south of Iraq”. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns reported a couple of days after the killing that “all indications are that </p>
<p>the Iraqis believe JAM to be responsible, although Muqtada al-Sadr has gone on record </p>
<p>condemning both this and the previous assassination of the Governor of Qadisiyah”.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Brown’s Private Secretary on 21 August </p>
<p>about the handover of Basra Palace.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> The letter said:</p>
<p>“Handover on 29 August is of course not without risk, which predominantly revolves </p>
<p>around equipment matters. Mitigating measures are, however, in place, following </p>
<p>direction from General Petraeus … In presentational terms, our communications </p>
<p>posture for the handover of Basra Palace will be low key. This is set against the </p>
<p>context of the broader process leading towards Provincial Iraqi Control and the run-</p>
<p>up to the US reports on Iraq in mid-September. With specific regard to Basra Palace, </p>
<p>officials in Baghdad are actively engaged with the Iraqi authorities to develop a </p>
<p>media handling plan that matches our intent and portrays the handover as an </p>
<p>Iraqi-led process … </p>
<p>“There will be no ceremony or media event at Basra Palace itself for the handover, </p>
<p>but a facility for Iraqi media at the Contingency Operating Base (COB) is planned </p>
<p>where our aim will be to emphasise the effective training and support provided by </p>
<p>MND(SE) forces to the PPF which has made handover possible.”</p>
<p><b>241. </b> The letter confirmed that the combined handover of the PJCC and Basra Palace </p>
<p>would mean “no Multi-National Force presence in Basra City”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary added a covering note explaining that Mr McDonald </p>
<p>and Ms Aldred had discussed the issue with General Douglas Lute, President Bush’s </p>
<p>adviser on Iraq, who had confirmed that on balance the US was content with </p>
<p>the UK plan.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Ms Aldred’s advice was that it would be important to “keep a careful eye on how </p>
<p>things develop between now and handover” and to “establish clear and consistent media </p>
<p>messages”. Further advice was awaited from the MOD on operational handling between </p>
<p>now and PIC, including the part the UK would play in the event of any intra-Shia or </p>
<p>sectarian violence.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 again on </p>
<p>21 August.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> They suggested that it was important not to be too fixated on detainee </p>
<p>releases; the cessation of hostilities was, at least from the UK side, every bit as </p>
<p>important. In their report back to London, the officials advised that the “MOD POLAD </p>
<p>[Political Adviser] here is preparing a submission that will seek transfer of future authority </p>
<p>for releases at the end of each month’s period (should the process survive) from </p>
<p>SoS Defence to GOC”. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> Maj Gen Binns was reported to be “emphatically supportive” of the negotiations: </p>
<p>“So far.”</p>
<p><b>246. </b> A further long meeting took place on 23 August, described by government officials </p>
<p>working closely with the military as “difficult”.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> A large part of the meeting was spent </p>
<p>debating further releases. JAM1 insisted that “there must be 15 releases on 30 August; </p>
<p>otherwise our agreement was off”. Without the releases there would be huge problems; </p>
<p>Basra would become “another Fallujah”. The slow pace of releases was damaging </p>
<p>JAM1’s credibility. </p>
<p><b>247. </b> The officials explained that “we had a deal and must stick to it” – the month of </p>
<p>cease-fire ended on 13 September. If the violence continued to reduce there “should be </p>
<p>substantial releases” then, but nothing could be promised yet. </p>

<p>Gen Keane’s comments were described by <i>The Guardian</i> as “the latest in a series of </p>
<p>critical comments made by US officials, many anonymously, about Britain’s commitment </p>

<p> He felt that:</p>
<p>“We have a robust plan engaging in capacity building/SSR with the ISF and </p>

<p><b>250. </b> Having briefed Maj Gen Binns that Mr Brown “wants to be assured that decisions </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>252. </b> On 28 August, MOD officials sought approval from Mr Adam Ingram, the MOD’s </p>
<p>Duty Minister that day, for Maj Gen Binns “to conclude the next stage of discussions </p>
<p>with JAM”.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>253. </b> The submission proposed that, in exchange for a “further one month cease-fire on </p>
<p>UK forces”, MND(SE) would continue their limitation on strike operations and, provided </p>
<p>all the conditions were met, would release a further 11 internees on 13 September. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> The proposal had been approved by Gen Petraeus, Gen Mohan and Dr Rubaie. </p>
<p>The advice explained:</p>
<p>“It is intended that the GOC will develop a longer term plan for taking forward these </p>
<p>discussions post-September. Given the uncertainty about how long UK forces will </p>
<p>remain in the COB, we are naturally keen to ensure that we do not give up our </p>
<p>negotiating leverage before we have an enduring agreement in place …</p>
<p>“This remains a presentationally risky line of activity. The risks that the negotiations </p>
<p>will get into the public domain are increasing. This is for a number of reasons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is becoming increasingly obvious that there has been a step change in the </p>
<p>security environment at the COB.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We publish details of the number of internees being held, and it will become </p>
<p>apparent that this number is falling;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Rumours that a cease-fire deal has been reached are apparently circulating </p>
<p>on the streets of Basra and these are being picked up by Arabic media </p>
<p>outlets, some of whom have posed questions to the MND(SE) press </p>
<p>office …</p>
<p>“All internees released in future will be given a clear instruction by [JAM1] that </p>
<p>they are not to publicise the terms of their release. For the moment a fairly neutral </p>
<p>defensive line is holding in the face of inquiries from local media outlets.”</p>
<p><b>255. </b> Mr Ingram’s Military Adviser responded on 28 August that Mr Ingram agreed </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns should now conclude negotiations with JAM1 along the lines proposed, </p>
<p>“noting that Ministers will be informed in advance of the precise timing of the release of </p>
<p>the internees and if there are any significant changes to the plan”.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>256. </b> In his weekly report on 28 August, Maj Gen Rollo reported Prime Minister Maliki’s </p>
<p>“evident concern” about security in Basra, which</p>
<p> </p>
<p>was helping General Mohan to “make </p>
<p>progress” with his proposals to reinforce Basra.</p>

<p><b>257. </b> Lt Gen Rollo also reported a conversation with Gen Petraeus in the wake of the </p>
<p>media stories:</p>
<p>“Unsurprisingly, he remains clear that there are a range of tasks based on a </p>
<p>starred HQ to be done, albeit at potentially reduced force levels. These include key </p>
<p>leadership engagement, training support to ISF, ISTAR [Intelligence, Surveillance, </p>
<p>Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance] and support for ISOF [Iraqi Special </p>
<p>Operations Forces], support for the PRTs [Provincial Reconstruction Teams] and </p>
<p>in Basra the consulates, in addition to the provision of an intervention capability. </p>
<p>At the tactical level General Odierno intends to formulate his position on the UK </p>
<p>requirements post PIC … When it appears this should provide helpful definition on </p>
<p>what the US is asking for.” </p>
<p><b>258. </b> When Mr Brown met C (Sir John Scarlett) on 29 August, part of their discussion </p>
<p>covered Iraq.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> As a No.10 record of this meeting cannot be found, the Inquiry has used </p>
<p>a record of it made by C. </p>
<p><b>259. </b> Mr Brown was reported to be “currently very focused on Basra Palace and worried </p>
<p>about US reactions to withdrawal, which he knows is due in the next few days”. Sir John </p>
<p>and Mr Brown discussed the potential importance of the negotiation with JAM1. </p>
<p><b>260. </b> At the end of August, government officials specialising in the Middle East were </p>
<p>preparing two separate letters to the FCO on the negotiations and Basra: one updating </p>
<p>Whitehall readers not in the MOD chain of command on the latest discussions with </p>
<p>JAM1 and focused on the issue of Basra Palace and JAM1’s “guarantee” that JAM </p>
<p>would not loot it, and a second “seeking to set the [NAME OF OPERATION] talks in </p>
<p>context and to examine the implications of an accommodation with JAM for the future </p>
<p>stability of Basra”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>261. </b> The second letter was intended to explain that “we may still be able to engineer a </p>
<p>tolerable (no better) outcome in Basra if we accept the realities of militia politics”.</p>
<p><b>262. </b> On 29 August, Mr Ahmad al-Shaybani, a senior JAM commander, announced </p>
<p>that the activities of JAM would be suspended for six months.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> The suspension of </p>
<p>activity, including against “occupiers”, was to allow some “restructuring” within JAM. The </p>
<p>following day, he announced that he had been misquoted and that anti-MNF activities </p>
<p>were not suspended. A Cabinet Office official advised Mr Brown that the cease-fire was </p>
<p>likely to be an attempt by Muqtada al-Sadr to reassert control over JAM, and there was a </p>
<p>“high risk” that some would not respect his call. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Lt Gen Wall reported to the Iraq Strategy Group on 29 August that there had been </p>

<p>the possible collusion or acquiescence of the Iraqi Police Service.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> As a result, General </p>
<p>Mohan had deployed his entire reserve battalion to the site. For this reason, and the late </p>
<p>arrival of some equipment, the withdrawal from Basra Palace had been delayed. </p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr McDonald asked whether a delay would be likely to have any negative impact </p>
<p>on the JAM cease-fire. The FCO felt that the risk was low and that there were “some </p>
<p>indications” though no guarantee that Basra Palace would not be targeted. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> US officials in Baghdad had established a working group to discuss arrangements </p>
<p>for the renewal of the UN Security Council resolution which provided the MNF with its </p>
<p>mandate in Iraq. Mr Nigel Casey reported to the Iraq Strategy Group that engagement </p>
<p>with UK officials “to agree a joint strategy for handling the Iraqis” would begin after </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker had given evidence to Congress. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> Reflecting on the events that occurred after the UK had vacated the PJCC, </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns wrote:</p>
<p>“Whilst the events that unfolded within the PJCC after we vacated were unfortunate, </p>
<p>there is much good that can be taken from them. Mohan quickly got to grips with the </p>
<p>situation … regaining control of the building … The fact that the PJCC shift was back </p>
<p>in the next morning … is testimony to an Iraqi solution to an Iraqi problem and bodes </p>
<p>well for the future … I for one see the positives that came out of these events.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>267. </b> On 30 August, a government official working closely with the military reported </p>
<p>that he had sent a copy of the letter on Basra Palace to colleagues in Whitehall.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recorded the “excellent news” that Mr Ingram had signed off the MOD’s advice. </p>
<p><b>268. </b> A paper by the Assessments Staff on 30 August stated that an announcement that </p>
<p>JAM would be “restructured” was “almost certainly prompted by the growing frustration </p>
<p>of Muqtada al-Sadr and other senior Sadrist leaders over their lack of control over </p>
<p>the movement”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>269. </b> The Assessments Staff also considered that what was meant by “freezing” JAM </p>
<p>activity was unclear and recorded that they doubted the ability of the Sadrist leadership </p>
<p>to deliver a cease-fire.</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Lt Gen Rollo told the Inquiry that JAM had “overplayed their hand” in August, in </p>
<p>the area immediately south of Baghdad, by assassinating several chiefs of police and </p>
<p>governors.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> This led to a “fairly major push against them” by the ISF, which put them </p>
<p>under pressure, resulting in the cease-fire. </p>

<p><b>271. </b> SIS3 told the Inquiry that Muqtada al-Sadr was “following events, rather than </p>
<p>driving events from his bolthole in Iran”.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Maj Gen Binns reported on 30 August that UK forces had handed over the PJCC </p>
<p>four days previously, ahead of schedule and without incident.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> He was disappointed </p>
<p>by Gen Mohan’s assessment that the PPF was unable to undertake security at </p>
<p>Basra Palace yet. He judged this to be “brinksmanship with Baghdad”, that was </p>
<p>being used to push for the resources needed for other security aspirations, rather </p>
<p>than for Basra Palace. </p>
<p><b>273. </b> Commenting from Baghdad, Major General Gerald Berragan, Deputy Commanding </p>
<p>General (Operations) Multi-National Corps – Iraq, reported concerns that some of the </p>
<p>additional resources that were being deployed to Basra at Gen Mohan’s request were </p>
<p>not yet fully trained or equipped.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>274. </b> One of the (all Shia) National Police units had a reputation in Baghdad “for its </p>
<p>seemingly active role in ethnic cleansing of Sunni districts” and for “turning a blind eye – </p>
<p>or worse – to JAM activities”. He cautioned that “reinforcements from Baghdad may </p>
<p>bring other complications to the Basra security scene, and these units will clearly require </p>
<p>some serious support and mentoring if they are to be successful”.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> Maj Gen Binns, Gen Mohan and Lt Gen Odierno agreed on 30 August that the </p>
<p>conditions were set for handover of Basra Palace on the night of 2/3 September.</p>

<p><b>276. </b> On the evening of 31 August, Mr Browne told Mr Brown that the handover </p>

<p>“… following the handover of Basra Palace and our other Basra City bases, we </p>
<p>will de facto be at PIC with the Iraqi Security Forces leading on security in Basra </p>
<p>City. While our move out of Basra Palace has never been linked to PIC, it was not </p>
<p>envisaged that the gap between the two events would be as large as it is now likely </p>
<p>to be. Set against the background of the UK technically retaining responsibility for </p>
<p>security in the province until PIC, this will entail a period of greater operational risk </p>
<p>and, although UK commanders judge this to be acceptable, we should aim to keep </p>
<p>this gap as short as possible.”</p>

<p>234</p>
<p><b>278. </b> On 31 August, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary provided No.10 with an update </p>
<p>on the security situation in Basra and ongoing discussions with JAM.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> In the letter, </p>
<p>he recapped negotiations with JAM1 and actions to date and explained:</p>
<p>“This arrangement has to date been very successful. Rocket and mortar attacks on </p>
<p>Basra Air Station have effectively ceased and those on Basra Palace much reduced. </p>
<p>The UK forces withdrawing from the Permanent Joint Co-ordination Centre on </p>
<p>27 August did so almost without incident. And resupply convoys to and from Basra </p>
<p>Palace have also proceeded with significantly fewer incidents than would previously </p>
<p>have been anticipated. As part of these discussions, we have also secured </p>
<p>assurances that the handover of Basra Palace will proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>“The cease-fire period is due to expire on 13 September: the next stage of the </p>
<p>discussions is aimed at ensuring a smooth continuance of these arrangements </p>
<p>beyond that point. It is due to involve the release of 11 internees and a further </p>
<p>month-long cease-fire period. We are also working up plans to try and ensure that </p>
<p>a more permanent arrangement is put in place.”</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Although the operation had “undoubtedly saved lives”, presentational risks </p>
<p>remained:</p>
<p>“Some of those involved in the release process are potentially linked, on the basis </p>
<p>of intelligence information, to attacks against UK personnel (although in no cases </p>
<p>do we have sufficient evidence to initiate legal proceedings through the Iraqi justice </p>
<p>system and indeed many would likely have been released in the near future through </p>
<p>our standard procedures for managing our internee population). And we face risks </p>
<p>of accusations that we have done deals with terrorists, which may reinforce some of </p>
<p>the negative comments emerging from the US in recent weeks alleging that we are </p>
<p>not in control of events in South-East Iraq and are seeking an early exit.”</p>
<p><b>280. </b> The update also recorded media coverage alleging the UK had negotiated a </p>
<p>cease-fire with JAM but “these have been inaccurate on the detail and have not yet been </p>
<p>more widely followed up”:</p>
<p>“But it does seem likely that it is a matter of when, not if, the story will break. We </p>
<p>will consider whether there is scope to be more proactive in media handling of this </p>
<p>process in the aftermath of the reports to Congress by Petraeus and Crocker. In the </p>
<p>meantime we do not intend to comment on any negotiations that we may have held </p>
<p>with JAM or other militia groups.”</p>
<p><b>281. </b> On 31 August, an article by Mr Miliband and Mr Browne entitled ‘Still on Track in </p>
<p>Basra’ appeared in the <i>Washington Post</i>.</p>

<p>were “real, wide-ranging and deep-seated”, Mr Miliband and Mr Browne described </p>
<p>expectations that transition to PIC would be achieved within months, after a judgement </p>
<p>“based on the conditions on the ground”. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> The article continued:</p>
<p>“To recognise that such challenges remain is not to accept that our mission in </p>
<p>southern Iraq is failing. Our goal was to bring Iraqi forces and institutions to a level </p>
<p>where they could take on responsibility for their communities. It could not create in </p>
<p>four years in Iraq the democracy, governance and security that it took Great Britain </p>
<p>and the United States centuries to establish.”</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry that, in August 2007, the UK considered it had </p>
<p>surged – “we believed that SINBAD was a surge of sorts” – and that “we had done what </p>
<p>we could in Basra at the time”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> This left two alternatives:</p>
<p>“We could have stood and fought. We could have continued to do strike operations </p>
<p>at the rate that 19 Brigade were doing them, we could have done that. We would </p>
<p>have just had to endure, so we could have endured, we could have hunkered down </p>
<p>and we could have just taken it and waited for some form of Iraq-wide impact of the </p>
<p>surge that the Americans were conducting.”</p>

<p><b>284. </b> A few days later two senior former UK military officers, General Sir Mike Jackson </p>
<p>and Major General Tim Cross, were also quoted in the media.</p>

<p> The roles they held in </p>

<p><b>285. </b> Gen Jackson characterised US post-invasion policy as “intellectually bankrupt”, </p>
<p>Maj Gen Cross considered it “fatally flawed”. Maj Gen Cross alleged that his warnings </p>
<p>about the possible descent of Iraq into chaos had been ignored by Mr Donald Rumsfeld, </p>
<p>US Secretary of Defense. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> On 3 September, the longer letter on Basra’s future was sent by a senior </p>
<p>government official specialising in the Middle East to Mr Mark Lyall Grant, FCO Director </p>
<p>General Political.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> He reported that, at least for the moment, JAM1 appeared to have </p>
<p>the backing of the majority of JAM in Basra and its leadership in Najaf. Although the </p>
<p>negotiations on detainees were proving hard going, the senior official judged that JAM1 </p>
<p>had invested too much of his personal capital in the process to withdraw, though he </p>

<p>236</p>
<p><b>287. </b> The other Basra militia were aware of the negotiations and remained suspicious </p>
<p>that the deal would marginalise them. JAM1 had given an undertaking that JAM would </p>
<p>respect the Iraqi Government’s takeover of Basra Palace and would not loot it, provided </p>
<p>that there was an effective guard force in place.</p>
<p><b>288. </b> The senior official concluded: </p>
<p>“This initiative has already delivered significant results but the negotiations remain </p>
<p>fragile, uncertain and vulnerable to outside interference. This applies especially to </p>

<p>Basra Palace signalled that the UK was pulling out of Iraq, Mr Brown said that this </p>
<p>was a “pre-planned and … organised move” and that the UK would “discharge all our </p>
<p>responsibilities to the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> The UK was moving from a combat role towards </p>

<p>perceptible effort from them on the political track.”</p>
<p><b>292. </b> In a report to Maj Gen Binns and the MIG the following day, a government official </p>
<p>working closely with the military explained:</p>
<p>“It was with some difficulty that I focused [JAM1] on the issue of what happens after </p>
<p>13 September (fortuitously more or less the start of Ramadan) following proposed </p>
<p>release of eleven more detainees. [JAM1]’s main request was that to delay the next </p>
<p>batch of releases until ‘Id al-Fitr would try the patience of his comrades: would it </p>
<p>not be possible to release a few each week or so? I replied that I hoped that such </p>
<p>flexibility would be feasible, but I could make no promises at this stage … I said that, </p>
<p>in return for these Ramadan releases, we would be looking for [JAM1] to persevere </p>
<p>in his efforts to rein in the violence. [JAM1] was almost dismissive, implying that this </p>
<p>was a given. He then expounded at length why our agreement had to be about more </p>
<p>than just security.”</p>
<p>139</p>
<p><b>293. </b> The official and JAM1 then discussed “what the end-state of the agreement might </p>
<p>be”. JAM1 suggested that it was unlikely that resolution 1723 would be extended and </p>
<p>that the UK would have to release all its detainees anyway. If they were released the </p>
<p>UK would not appear to be a military occupying force but a social and economic one, so </p>
<p>most of the current points of friction between the people of Basra and MND(SE) would </p>
<p>fall away. JAM1 also considered it worth seeking to extend the agreement to al-Amara </p>
<p>and Nasiriyah. The record of the meeting concluded: </p>
<p>“A difficult meeting in which the importance of the development agenda to [JAM1] </p>
<p>became apparent. It seems clear that if we wish to gain the maximum benefit from </p>
<p>this agreement we need to accelerate the process for delivering some tangible </p>
<p>projects on the ground.”</p>
<p><b>294. </b> In his weekly report on 3 September, Lt Gen Rollo wrote that he had suggested to </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus that he would need to focus on three issues when he visited London in </p>
<p>mid-September:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what capabilities were required in Basra post-PIC until around April 2008;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how this might evolve over summer 2008, including the potential for US troops </p>
<p>to reinforce Basra in the event of the Iraqis being overwhelmed; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>295. </b> Lt Gen Rollo also wrote that it was important to be clear with the US about UK </p>
<p>intentions: </p>
<p>“US slides continue to show a brigade in Basra bedecked with the Union Jack </p>
<p>when coalition/US force levels have reduced to only five brigades. If this is not </p>
<p>our policy then we should say so, and agree an event or time at which we step </p>
<p>out of their plan.”</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Lt Gen Rollo predicted that in his report to Congress Gen Petraeus would </p>
<p>“acknowledge the need to drawdown, but will wish to maintain the present policy of </p>
<p>securing the population while simultaneously transitioning steadily to the ISF”. </p>
<p><b>297. </b> Neither Mr Browne nor Mr Miliband attended Cabinet on 4 September.</p>

<p>Iraq and Afghanistan; he would ask them to report to a future Cabinet.</p>
<p><b>298. </b> On the same day Maj Gen Wall briefed the Chiefs of Staff that the security situation </p>
<p>across Iraq “remained positive”, with civilian casualties at their lowest level since the </p>
<p>beginning of 2006; “prospects currently appeared positive” for the effectiveness of the </p>
<p>six-month JAM cease-fire; but there was a recognised risk of a significant AQ-I attack in </p>
<p>the run-up to the Gen Petraeus/Ambassador Crocker statement to Congress.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>299. </b> The Chiefs of Staff observed that “it was important that a period of stability elapsed </p>
<p>before the handover could be considered a complete success. The pressure to achieve </p>
<p>PIC needed to be maintained …” The remaining potential barriers to PIC were the </p>
<p>removal of Governor Waili (still legally challenging his dismissal) and the continuance of </p>
<p>Gen Mohan and Gen Jalil in post until PIC. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> A CIG assessed Iraq’s relations with its neighbours on 4 September.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“Iran wants Multi-National Forces (MNF) to leave Iraq and is actively working to </p>
<p>make life as difficult as possible for them. Iran will tolerate short-term instability to </p>
<p>force a humiliating MNF withdrawal. Iranian support for Shia extremists continues </p>
<p>unabated.</p>
<p>“Syria also wants MNF to leave Iraq … Syria continues to provide safe haven to </p>
<p>some Sunni groups supporting insurgent activity in Iraq, particularly those linked to </p>
<p>the Iraqi Ba’ath party …</p>
<p>“As the prospect of MNF drawdown looms larger, Iraq’s Sunni neighbours are </p>
<p>increasingly fearful of a descent into civil war, an emerging Al Qaida safe-haven, </p>
<p>or an Iranian-dominated Shia state … So long as Iranian influence is seen to be </p>
<p>increasing, regional tensions will continue to rise.”</p>

<p>239</p>
<p><b>301. </b> At the request of the MOD and FCO, on 6 September the JIC assessed progress </p>
<p>of the Baghdad Security Plan (known in Arabic as Fardh al-Qanoon (FAQ)) which had </p>
<p>begun in February, and its future prospects.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>302. </b> The JIC judged that: </p>
<p>“I. Under the current Baghdad Security Plan, intensified Multi-National Force (MNF) </p>
<p>and Iraqi security force (ISF) operations have improved security for Iraqis in general </p>
<p>in Baghdad. Civilian, ISF and MNF casualties have reduced. Attacks on the MNF </p>
<p>have fallen off since June, and are now at the lowest level since June 2006.”</p>
<p><b>303. </b> The JIC assessed that MNF operations focused on the AQ-I threat and other Sunni </p>
<p>Islamist extremists had had an effect. The number of high-profile suicide attacks against </p>
<p>Shia targets had fallen.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Outside Baghdad, overall attack levels had fallen sharply after record highs in </p>
<p>June. The JIC assessed it was “too early to say whether this trend will be sustained”.</p>
<p><b>305. </b> The JIC judged that: “The Iraqis have taken no political advantage of the improved </p>
<p>security to pursue national reconciliation or reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>306. </b> The JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Government committees established to deal with economic regeneration </p>
<p>and communal reconciliation have achieved little of substance. Electricity and fuel </p>
<p>shortages remain more acute in Baghdad than elsewhere in Iraq and are the cause </p>
<p>of widespread disillusionment, undermining the government’s credibility.”</p>
<p><b>307. </b> In relation to performance of the ISF, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“The initial higher level Iraqi management of and engagement with the complexities </p>
<p>of FAQ was encouraging. From the start, Maliki took a ‘hands on’ approach, chairing </p>
<p>FAQ’s Executive Steering Committee and co-ordinating security operations … But </p>
<p>in recent months his enthusiasm has worn off. Continuing high profile attacks in </p>
<p>Baghdad (together with Shia nervousness over programmes to support armed Sunni </p>
<p>tribes) have strained Maliki’s relations with senior MNF commanders. We judge Iraqi </p>
<p>confidence, both among Ministers and more generally, has been damaged by the </p>
<p>popular perception that security has not significantly improved.”</p>
<p><b>308. </b> The JIC considered that key Iraqi structures established to manage FAQ were still </p>
<p>“overwhelmingly Shia”. The government had taken some steps to address human rights </p>
<p>abuses, including sacking 23 senior National Police commanders and disbanding an </p>
<p>entire battalion accused of complicity in sectarian acts. But other individuals accused of </p>
<p>sectarian abuses remained in positions of responsibility. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>309. </b> The JIC Assessment ended with a section entitled ‘Outlook’, which said:</p>
<p>“Iraqi politics are paralysed. Despite upbeat claims following the recent leadership </p>
<p>conference, we see no prospect of Maliki’s government making real progress on </p>
<p>key legislation … We continue to judge that any new leader would face similar </p>
<p>challenges to Maliki: early significant improvements in government performance </p>
<p>would be unlikely.</p>
<p>“We judge the levels of violence in Baghdad and across Iraq may continue to </p>
<p>fall, but only as long as the US troop surge can be sustained: the ISF, even with </p>
<p>tribal support, are not capable of maintaining the tempo or effect of current MNF </p>
<p>operations … The additional US surge can only be maintained until March 2008 … </p>
<p>When it reduces, we judge that Sunni extremists and Shia militias will try to reassert </p>
<p>control on the ground.”</p>
<p><b>310. </b> In his weekly update on 6 September, Maj Gen Binns described the withdrawal </p>
<p>of UK troops from Basra Palace on 2 and 3 September as “extremely successful”.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although one of the convoys was hit by an IED, there were no serious injuries and </p>
<p>it arrived back in the COB “largely unscathed” – something that would have been </p>
<p>“impossible” a month earlier. </p>
<p><b>311. </b> The media coverage in Iraq and in the UK had been “largely positive”, with the </p>
<p>only real criticism that the UK was leaving a security gap in the South coming from </p>
<p>the US media. </p>
<p><b>312. </b> Maj Gen Binns commented that Dr Rubaie’s decision to speak to the media </p>
<p>(“in English, so none of the message was lost in translation”) was “further affirmation that </p>
<p>the decision to hand over control of the Palace to the ISF had the full support of the GoI”.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Less positively, Maj Gen Binns reported:</p>
<p>“Whilst senior US Commanders recognise and understand the reasoning for our </p>
<p>departure from the Palace … it has become apparent that this understanding is not </p>
<p>shared by junior and mid-ranking US personnel. My staffs … detect at least a slight </p>
<p>discomfort at the UK position … at the working level, with a feeling that our return </p>
<p>to the COB will leave Southern Iraq open to malign Iranian influence and the flow </p>
<p>of EFPs. These feelings are no doubt buoyed by the address by POTUS [President </p>
<p>Bush] to military personnel in Anbar; at a tactical level, the rallying call ‘if we let our </p>
<p>enemies back us out of Iraq, we will be more likely to face them in America’ at a time </p>
<p>when our own Government is announcing a reduction in troop numbers (regardless </p>
<p>of how long this has been planned) further demonstrates the perception of a division </p>
<p>between UK and US foreign policies towards Iraq.”</p>

<p><b>314. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that withdrawing from Basra Palace – </p>
<p>“a major exposed operation” – without a single casualty had been a “really important </p>
<p>achievement”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Colonel Peter Mansoor, executive officer to Gen Petraeus in 2007, wrote in his </p>
<p>book <i>Surge</i>:</p>
<p>“By withdrawing their forces from Basra and consolidating them on a single base at </p>
<p>the city outskirts, British political and military leaders had abdicated responsibility for </p>
<p>the city’s security. Shi’a militia leaders had contested control of the city and outlasted </p>
<p>the British will to continue the fight.”</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Mr Dowse told the Inquiry that, although there was a policy statement to the effect </p>
<p>that even after withdrawal from Basra Palace UK forces retained the ability to re-engage </p>
<p>if required, his view and that of the intelligence community more generally had been that </p>
<p>that was not true “in any meaningful sense”: </p>
<p>“The idea that we could have gone back into Basra and reoccupied in the event </p>
<p>of a crisis … was extremely optimistic, to say the least. We never actually were </p>
<p>in a position where we wrote that in an assessment. I recall going to a couple of </p>
<p>meetings where I asked the MOD representatives how confident they were of the </p>
<p>assertion of re-engagement and was told … ‘We recognise we are carrying a risk.’ </p>
<p>Actually, it was never really tested.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Asked whether the UK had the capacity to re-intervene if the agreement with JAM </p>
<p>in Basra had broken down, Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry that he “didn’t really define </p>
<p>what ‘re-intervention’ meant, because it implies that we were intervening in the first place </p>
<p>in 2007 and we weren’t”. Maj Gen Binns added:</p>
<p>“Did I have the capacity to go back and reoccupy the Palace? Yes, at a stretch, but it </p>
<p>never really crossed my mind because I was so glad to get out of it.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>The impact of negotiations with JAM1</b></p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that he thought it likely that without the cease-fire, </p>
<p>withdrawing from Basra Palace might have become “the totemic humiliation of the British </p>
<p>forces shot out of Basra”.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw subsequently added the following detail: “Indeed, subsequent </p>

<p>the reposturing that attacks on it [Basra Palace] had been in the offing but were halted by </p>
<p>the ‘deal’.”</p>
<p>However, references to the process as a “deal” had been unhelpful and Maj Gen Shaw </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“I should have packaged it better like the American Anbar uprising, which was broadly </p>
<p>the same thing.”</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns told that Inquiry that in his view:</p>
<p>“… the accommodation got us to the stage where the Iraqis took responsibility for the </p>
<p>security of Basra and they wouldn’t have done that if the violence had still been at an </p>
<p>unacceptable level.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>He thought that:</p>
<p>“… back here in London there were people who were deeply uncomfortable with this </p>
<p>and the further you got away from Basra, the more uncomfortable people got with the </p>
<p>nature of the deal.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although Maj Gen Binns was confident that Mr Browne was aware of and comfortable with </p>
<p>the risk associated with negotiations, he told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think, you know, I think there were people in outer offices who wanted – not </p>
<p>unreasonably, they wanted to mitigate that risk.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns also told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“…in retrospect, I said, ‘Well, look, we’ve done this before, surely, negotiated with </p>
<p>terrorists, surely somebody could give me some advice on negotiations’, and I didn’t </p>
<p>get any, so we were thinking on our feet about this process of negotiation. We were </p>
<p>just trying to come up with a policy.”</p>
<p>Mr Dowse told the Inquiry that the departure of UK troops from Basra City did affect the </p>
<p>quantity, quality and reliability of the information he was receiving.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>SIS3 told the Inquiry that the agreement reached had:</p>
<p>“… reserved the right for HMG to respond militarily to any individual or groups </p>
<p>planning attacks, that we would interdict any weaponry moving in, and, furthermore, </p>
<p>that we would reserve the right to intervene when the Iraqi Government requested us </p>
<p>to, if they did. So, in other words, we were circumscribing our military activity to some </p>
<p>extent, but I think with no risk to our overall posture.”</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He also considered that events in Basra had a wider effect across JAM: </p>
<p>“Muqtada al-Sadr, who of course is the rather idiosyncratic, not to say incoherent </p>
<p>leader of JAM, sitting in Iran I think then made a virtue out of necessity by </p>

<p>rather felt that that was him following events, rather than driving events from his </p>

<p>SIS6 told the Inquiry that the understanding reached provided a six-month window for the </p>
<p>UK to pull out of Basra safely and re-locate to the Air Station.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Asked about the impact on security in Basra City, SIS6 explained that he did not know, </p>
<p>because the UK was not on the ground there.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A government official who worked closely with the military told the Inquiry he recalled that </p>
<p>the negotiations had been described as “a treatment of the symptoms” which had not </p>
<p>“brought about a cure” but was rather intended to “buy time and … space”.</p>

<p>would only be sustainable “if we now begin to deliver some results on the ground in </p>
<p>terms of reconstruction and development”. He cautioned:</p>
<p>“We probably now have a very narrow window of opportunity to reinforce the </p>
<p>success that has been achieved on the ground, but we must not become the victims </p>
<p>of that success by believing that because it is quiet that we have done all we can – </p>
<p>the emphasis must now shift away from the military line of operation … Perhaps it is </p>
<p>even time to consider whether we should be pushing the FCO or DFID into a more </p>
<p>leading role?”</p>
<p><b>325. </b> In relation to the UK’s ability to re-intervene in Basra, Gen Dannatt wrote:</p>
<p>“I sense that there is the potential for great confusion about what we actually </p>
<p>mean by this widely used term. I believe that it is unrealistic to think that we could </p>
<p>re-intervene in Basra without considerable cost, indeed to do so would be a massive </p>
<p>retrograde step in campaign terms. The focus should be perhaps to enable ISF </p>
<p>re-intervention in the city with the coalition enabling this task.”</p>
<p><b>326. </b> If the ISF were unable to re-intervene successfully, the Corps Reserve brigade </p>
<p>might be called on. The UK’s “residual focus for a time-limited period” would be on </p>
<p>capacity-building with the ISF and in the Basra economy. If that was to be the case, </p>
<p>Gen Dannatt saw the UK deployment as between 1,000 and 1,500 troops. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> Gen Dannatt concluded his report:</p>
<p>“In summary, I found a campaign that is at a major crossroads and facing a narrow </p>
<p>window of opportunity. The opportunities are time sensitive – we must be seen to be </p>
<p>reducing our forces, we must be prepared to engage with all parties and we must </p>
<p>follow up military operations with effective political and economic development. </p>
<p>We must base our thinking on the fact that we only have a limited amount of time </p>
<p>to change tack before … we out stay our welcome once more … I am conscious </p>
<p>that we have not yet received any political direction, but from an Army viewpoint I </p>
<p>can see a definite way forward on the ground in Iraq, consistent with any plans for </p>
<p>greater investment in Afghanistan and in a modest return to contingency.”</p>

<p><b>The credit crunch </b></p>
<p>From September 2007, the global financial crisis became a major focus for the UK </p>
<p>Government. Key events as the crisis intensified are described below. </p>
<p>On 9 August 2007, French bank BNP Paribas told investors that they would be unable to </p>
<p>withdraw money from two of its funds because it could not value the assets in them owing </p>
<p>to a “complete evaporation of liquidity” in the market. This triggered a sharp rise in the cost </p>
<p>of credit, and alerted the world to the start of the credit crunch.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 13 September, BBC News reported that Northern Rock had been granted emergency </p>
<p>financial support by the Bank of England. The following day, customers of the bank </p>
<p>withdrew £1bn, the biggest run on a British bank for more than a century.</p>
<p>On 21 April 2008, the Bank of England announced a £50bn plan to help banks by allowing </p>
<p>them to swap high risk mortgage debts for secure government bonds.</p>
<p>At the end of the month, the first annual fall in UK house prices for 12 years was recorded </p>
<p>by Nationwide.</p>
<p>On 7 September, US mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were taken </p>
<p>over by the US Government. Together they had lost approximately US$14bn over the </p>
<p>previous year.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The management of both companies was to be replaced, and they were to be given </p>
<p>access to additional funding. Both were to be administered by the Federal Housing </p>
<p>Finance Agency until their long-term future was decided. </p>
<p>President Bush said: “Putting these companies on a sound financial footing, and reforming </p>
<p>their business practices, is critical to the health of our financial system.”</p>
<p>On 16 September, Lehman Brothers – a major US investment bank – filed for chapter 11 </p>
<p>bankruptcy protection, which gives a company time to devise a pan to re-pay its </p>
<p>creditors.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> The BBC reported:</p>
<p>“Unwinding Lehman’s complex deals will take months if not years. During that time </p>
<p>the global financial system will be snarled up. Many banks won’t know for sure how </p>
<p>much they are exposed to Lehman, and will have difficulty freeing up the money in </p>
<p>those deals. </p>
<p>“This in turn is likely to intensify the credit crunch, with potentially dire consequences </p>
<p>for businesses and consumers.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>On 3 October, the US House of Representatives passed a US$700bn plan to rescue the </p>
<p>US financial sector.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Mr Prentice attended his first meeting of the Iraqi Ministerial Committee on National </p>
<p>Security (MCNS) on 9 September. It was confirmed that the national JAM cease-fire was </p>
<p>intended to include suspension of all attacks on the MNF.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>329. </b> After visiting Basra for the formal exchange of letters concerning the handover of </p>
<p>Basra Palace, Dr Rubaie reported to the MCNS that he had agreed with Gen Mohan that </p>
<p>the Iraqi Army would remain in the Palace in the short term, but that longer term it should </p>
<p>be renovated and used by the Government.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Lt Gen Rollo told the MCNS that the MNF had reduced its anti-JAM operations </p>
<p>by 50 percent nationally after the cease-fire was announced, but EFP attacks on MNF </p>
<p>had risen and indirect fire continued unchanged. Prime Minister Maliki agreed with </p>
<p>Dr Rubaie that this should not deflect the efforts of the reconciliation committee: if a </p>
<p>political solution could be found, it should be pursued. He would take two steps towards </p>
<p>peace for every step the militants took. </p>
<p><b>331. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented in his weekly report on 10 September that Muqtada al-</p>
<p>Sadr’s cease-fire announcement had “prompted considerable debate and action geared </p>
<p>at capitalising on the situation, regardless of what it might mean in the longer term”.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>332. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported that the handover of Basra Palace had “generated little </p>
<p>interest” in Baghdad, with “nothing but positive noises coming from my US colleagues”. </p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>“The reality of the situation in Basra more generally is also accepted, I believe, and </p>
<p>fears of premature withdrawal or less than supportive behaviour from the British </p>
<p>appear to be decreasing. CGS’s visit provided a useful opportunity to test the </p>
<p>acceptability of a transition from current force levels to a significantly smaller force </p>
<p>next Spring, focused on assistance and development …”</p>
<p><b>333. </b> On 10 September, Mr Browne spoke to Secretary Gates shortly before he reported </p>
<p>to Congress.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> Secretary Gates indicated that he expected Gen Petraeus would </p>
<p>recommend that while troops should remain in Iraq as long as possible, there were </p>
<p>opportunities to draw down where the security situation allowed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Browne observed </p>
<p>that the UK strategy for MND(SE) was consistent with this approach; the UK could </p>
<p>re-intervene in the South if required. </p>
<p><b>334. </b> Secretary Gates confirmed that the US was content with the UK position. The US </p>
<p>concern was whether a significant UK troop reduction would jeopardise the mission and </p>
<p>impact on the commitment of other coalition partners. He encouraged Mr Browne to </p>
<p>discuss the matter with Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Eric Edelman, Under Secretary </p>
<p>of Defense, when they were in London the following week.</p>

<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr Browne shared plans for a Prime Ministerial statement on Iraq in early October, </p>
<p>and said that it would be very difficult not to refer to PIC. The two agreed to speak again </p>
<p>following Gen Petraeus’ visit. </p>
<p><b>336. </b> On 10 and 11 September, Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testified to </p>
<p>Congress on security and political progress in Iraq, and on the impact of the US surge.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>337. </b> Ambassador Crocker focused on political, economic and diplomatic developments </p>
<p>in Iraq. He assessed that a “secure, stable democratic Iraq at peace with its neighbours” </p>
<p>was “attainable” but warned that Iraq was, and would remain, “a traumatised society”. </p>
<p>In terms of progress he said:</p>
<p>“In my judgement, the cumulative trajectory of political, economic, and diplomatic </p>
<p>developments in Iraq is upwards, although the line is not steep. The process will not </p>
<p>be quick, it will be uneven, punctuated by setbacks as well as achievements, and it </p>
<p>will require substantial US resolve and commitment. There will be no single moment </p>
<p>at which we can claim victory; any turning point will likely only be recognised in </p>
<p>retrospect …</p>
<p>“2007 has brought improvement. Enormous challenges remain. Iraqis still struggle </p>
<p>with fundamental questions about how to share power, accept their differences and </p>
<p>overcome their past. The changes to our strategy last January – the surge – have </p>
<p>helped change the dynamics in Iraq for the better. Our increased presence made </p>
<p>besieged communities feel that they could defeat Al Qaida by working with us … </p>
<p>We have given Iraqis the time and space to reflect on what sort of country they want. </p>
<p>Most Iraqis genuinely accept Iraq as a multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian society – it is the </p>
<p>balance of power that has yet to be sorted out.”</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Gen Petraeus focused on security. He stated that the military objectives of the </p>
<p>surge were being met in large measure with coalition and Iraqi forces dealing “significant </p>
<p>blows” to Al Qaeda in Iraq and disrupting Shia militia.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> He highlighted the decline in </p>
<p>civilian deaths during the period but recognised that the numbers were still at “troubling </p>
<p>levels”. Additionally, he described the “tribal rejection of Al Qaida” spreading out from </p>
<p>Anbar province as potentially the “most significant development of the past eight </p>
<p>months”. As a consequence of the progress made, Gen Petraeus suggested that it </p>
<p>would be possible to reduce troop numbers to pre-surge levels in summer 2008 although </p>
<p>he warned of the dangers of handing over to Iraqi Security Forces too early.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>339. </b> During the two days of testimony, Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus were </p>
<p>questioned on the UK’s approach in Basra. A briefing paper on key points from those </p>
<p>exchanges recorded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asked whether he agreed with the British drawdown and withdrawal from Basra </p>
<p>City, Gen Petraeus said he did.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asked whether the British had lost Basra, Gen Petraeus said: “The British did </p>
<p>a good hand-off to a force that was trained and equipped and certified to hand </p>
<p>off the palace … There’s no question but that there is a competition down there </p>
<p>between the Fadhila Party, the Supreme Council, the Badr Corps, and certainly </p>
<p>Sadr’s party and militia. Interestingly, there have been deals there recently, and </p>
<p>the violence level has just flat plummeted. It’s included some release of some </p>
<p>Jaysh al-Mahdi figures – again accommodations between all of them. Again for </p>
<p>the Shia south, that’s probably ok.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asked why the British had a force protection mission whereas the US had a </p>
<p>population protection mission, Gen Petraeus said that this was due to the lack of </p>
<p>sectarian violence in Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asked whether he could foresee a situation where US troops may have to be </p>
<p>committed to Basra, Gen Petraeus said: “I don’t think that we need to put US </p>
<p>forces in southern provinces, other than, say, some special forces teams or </p>
<p>occasionally sending something down to help out.”</p>
<p>172</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>340. </b> A few days after the testimony, Mr Prentice reported that it had “not been the </p>
<p>climactic political event here which many were expecting a few weeks ago” but now </p>
<p>that it was over “the Iraqi political class know better where the US stand and what is </p>
<p>expected of them”.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Mr Brown spoke to President Bush by video conference on 10 September.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>342. </b> The briefing provided for the conversation suggested he emphasise that no </p>
<p>decisions had been taken on a radical drawdown of UK troops and that the UK remained </p>
<p>committed both to the coalition and to supporting Iraq’s stability and development.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>343. </b> Officials assessed that President Bush was unlikely to make any fundamental </p>
<p>changes to US policy in the medium term; rather, his focus would be on short-term </p>
<p>management of the surge. The briefing said:</p>
<p>“Although US commanders in Iraq did sign off on the Palace move [in Basra], </p>

<p>in both Baghdad and Washington about UK plans in the South. Their concerns are </p>
<p>centred on the tension between (what they assume will be) further UK withdrawals in </p>
<p>the South, and the US military surge in Baghdad and its surrounding provinces.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> During the video conference, Mr Brown said that the departure from Basra </p>
<p>Palace had been smooth; he told President Bush that “elements of the media had </p>
<p>misrepresented our strategy, and our long-term objectives”.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> The next steps, including </p>
<p>transition to PIC in Basra, had to be based on a military assessment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Brown </p>
<p>explained that he intended to make a Parliamentary statement on Iraq in early October </p>
<p>but there would be no “hasty decisions” in the meantime.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> At Cabinet on 11 September, Mr Browne commented that Gen Petraeus’ evidence </p>
<p>had been less dramatic than billed: security in Baghdad had increased, and large scale </p>
<p>sectarian violence in Iraq had decreased.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> The US would wish to sustain its forces at </p>
<p>a higher level until 2008, to provide opportunities for political progress, although overall </p>
<p>numbers would reduce. By July 2008 the total would be 130,000; the pre-surge level. </p>
<p>Mr Browne told Cabinet that the US was essentially adopting the same approach the </p>
<p>UK had taken in the South; making reductions where security could be handed over </p>
<p>to the Iraqis. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Mr Browne reported that the transfer of Basra Palace on 3 September had </p>
<p>taken place without incident and the city was calm. British forces were now focused </p>
<p>on mentoring and training, although they would retain a capability to re-intervene if </p>
<p>necessary. Force levels would reduce to around 5,000 in November, with PIC expected </p>
<p>at around the same time, conditions permitting. Future plans would, in part, depend on </p>
<p>US decisions. </p>
<p><b>347. </b> Mr Miliband observed that the UK’s focus had, inevitably, been on Basra for the </p>
<p>last two to three years, but it was important now to think about the nature of the UK’s </p>
<p>overall relationship with Iraq, in the context of the wider international community. He </p>
<p>believed that there was a chance to persuade the European Union to develop serious </p>
<p>economic and social relationships with Iraq. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Mr Brown concluded the discussion by saying that, over the next few weeks, the </p>
<p>Government would need to look at security, reconciliation (where the emphasis was </p>
<p>moving from the national to the local level) and the “stake in the future” initiative. Cabinet </p>
<p>would have a further opportunity to discuss the issue at an appropriate time as matters </p>
<p>became clearer.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>349. </b> At their meeting on 11 September, the Chiefs of Staff noted that:</p>
<p>“The Gen Petraeus/Amb Crocker statement to Congress had been encouragingly </p>
<p>realistic but had not comprehensively articulated the future political intentions and </p>
<p>progress of PM Maliki.”</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>350. </b> Uncertainty remained about the direction Shia groups in Basra would take in the </p>
<p>coming months. As a result:</p>
<p>“The current nature of the UK mission in Iraq had potential to change, given the </p>
<p>security situation in MND(SE). It was important that the current security situation </p>
<p>did not cause a premature shift in strategic direction. Potential future UK missions </p>
<p>needed to be considered in a coalition context.”</p>
<p><b>351. </b> Major General John Rose, MOD Director General Intelligence Collection, briefed </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff that the freeze on JAM activity was welcome but its details remained </p>
<p>unclear. The lack of Sadrist cohesion meant that “recalcitrant JAM members” were likely </p>
<p>to continue to pursue Badr, MNF-I and their opponents within JAM on an opportunist </p>
<p>basis, and there therefore remained a “potent threat of further violence”. </p>
<p><b>352. </b> Iranian support to Badr/ISCI and some elements of JAM was believed to be </p>
<p>continuing with the goal of influencing the security strategy in southern Iraq. The Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff noted that there would always be an element within JAM which would pursue </p>
<p>violent ends. Iranian involvement was an important factor, although the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>felt that Iran had no interest in promoting an intra-Shia struggle. The important question </p>
<p>that remained unanswered was “the route that the Shia groupings in Basra would follow </p>
<p>over the coming months: accommodation or confrontation?”</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Government officials working closely with the military had a further meeting with </p>
<p>JAM1 on 11 September to discuss detainee releases and development issues.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> They </p>
<p>reported that the release of a further 11 detainees would take place the following day </p>
<p>and suggested that JAM1 and MND(SE) should: </p>
<p>“… be using the period of our agreement to demonstrate to both the Iraqi </p>
<p>government/Provincial Council and coalition development officials that there were </p>
<p>new opportunities … But we should be looking further than a few individual isolated </p>
<p>projects, towards accelerating and unblocking the projects which have already </p>
<p>been drawn up and approved … [JAM1] had brought a list of ideas for development </p>
<p>projects … [that] ranged from the relatively straightforward (street lighting, drinking </p>
<p>water) to the much more ambitious (building a new hospital).”</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Following the meeting, a government official working closely with the military </p>
<p>reported to colleagues in London that they had been trying to assess the thinking </p>

<p>of interested parties on “where we are going with [NAME OF OPERATION]”. The </p>
<p>responses were summarised as “we do not want merely to be buying JAM quiescence </p>
<p>with releases; we do not want to be seen to be appeasing terrorists; we do not want to </p>
<p>enter into an open-ended pork-barrel process; we do not want to be seen to be favouring </p>
<p>one political trend over another”. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> Mr Day sent Ms Aldred a “first cut” of options for future UK force levels in southern </p>
<p>Iraq on 11 September.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> While emphasising that the analysis remained provisional and </p>
<p>needed further work, he outlined four options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A minimal contribution of 250-750 personnel, embedded within mainly US units </p>
<p>to provide niche training or support to the Iraqis and/or the coalition. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A 1,500-strong battlegroup or equivalent, plus logistic support, embedded within </p>
<p>a US formation, primarily to continue SSR but with a limited combat capability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A one- or two-star HQ plus two battlegroups and limited logistic and enabling </p>
<p>capabilities, totalling around 2,500 personnel, to form the framework of a </p>
<p>multi-national brigade.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A 500-strong framework brigade with a one- or two-star HQ, two battle groups </p>
<p>and full logistic and enabling support capabilities, able to operate without US </p>
<p>support.</p>
<p><b>356. </b> The initial MOD view was that the third of these was the minimum contribution </p>
<p>necessary to retain the UK’s lead nation and principal ally status in MND(SE), but that </p>
<p>would need to be tested with the US. All options except the final one would require </p>
<p>significant US logistic and enabling support.</p>
<p><b>357. </b> MOD officials advised Mr Browne’s Private Secretary on 11 September that, as </p>
<p>previously agreed, 11 internees would be released the following day and noted that </p>
<p>advice on the long-term future of the operation would follow shortly.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> Referring to a </p>
<p>“step reduction” in attacks on coalition forces since the start of the process, the advice </p>
<p>said that there was “merit in pursuing this process”. </p>
<p><b>358. </b> The advice included a substantial section on presentation, referring to articles in </p>
<p><i>The Sunday Times</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>. There had been some follow-up interest and </p>
<p>Parliamentary interest was anticipated. As a result:</p>
<p>“We have reflected on whether and how we should adjust our presentational </p>
<p>approach to this issue. At some point, some aspects of the overall strategy need </p>
<p>to be explained to the public and Parliament and also to the families of service </p>
<p>personnel who have been killed in Iraq. The best means of doing so might be as </p>
<p>part of a wider piece on Iraq strategy … rather than a media event focusing solely </p>
<p>on [NAME OF OPERATION] issues. If the Secretary of State agrees, we will develop </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>some text describing our approach to reconciliation in the context of developments </p>
<p>in South East Iraq accordingly. In the meantime we will continue to avoid comment </p>
<p>on specific cases, confirm that we have been and continue to be, engaged in </p>
<p>dialogue with all relevant parties in our area, that this is in line with and supports </p>
<p>Iraqi Government initiatives and that individual detainee releases occur only when </p>
<p>they are no longer judged to be an imperative threat to security.</p>
<p>“In all this, we need to be particularly mindful of the families of UK personnel killed, </p>
<p>either potentially as a result of the activities of those currently interned or in the </p>
<p>course of capturing them … </p>
<p>“Having reviewed the position, we believe that we should now routinely provide </p>
<p>parallel notification to the families involved when detainees potentially linked to the </p>
<p>death of UK service personnel leave the UK detention facility either being transferred </p>
<p>to Iraqi control or being released.”</p>
<p><b>359. </b> Mr Browne’s office replied on 13 September to confirm that he had noted the </p>
<p>imminent release and that further advice would be put forward shortly on the long-term </p>
<p>sustainability of the operation.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> Mr Browne was reported to be “particularly keen that </p>
<p>any further releases are in the context of a strategy for a more enduring political/security </p>
<p>solution for the South.” Presentational advice was also agreed, including the intention to </p>
<p>inform bereaved families.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> Senior officials discussed Mr Day’s note of 11 September to Ms Aldred at the Iraq </p>
<p>Strategy Group on 13 September, and concluded that further work would be needed </p>
<p>before NSID(OD) considered the options in early October.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> The Group identified a </p>
<p>need for “inter-departmental discussion of the political and military objectives for the </p>
<p>UK’s continuing engagement in Iraq”. The Group also identified the need for discussion </p>
<p>with the US about enabling support and their own plans, and the need for work on the </p>
<p>location of a future UK military and civilian presence. </p>
<p><b>361. </b> Mr McDonald also told the Group that Mr Brown would make a short statement </p>
<p>the following day, confirming the UK’s commitment to Iraq. He still intended to make a </p>
<p>substantive statement when Parliament returned, which would focus on PIC in Basra. </p>
<p>By this stage, ideally a date would have been agreed and announced. While he did not </p>
<p>favour artificial timetables and remained committed to a conditions-based approach to </p>
<p>PIC, Mr Brown wanted to say as much as possible about the tasks and numbers of UK </p>
<p>troops that would be required after PIC and give an indication of roughly when each </p>
<p>phase of overwatch would be reached. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> Lt Gen Wall noted that there would need to be some engagement with the US </p>
<p>on the substance before Mr Brown made his statement: current US military thinking </p>

<p>envisaged a process for Basra PIC beginning in late October, with an announcement </p>
<p>in November. Mr McDonald said that officials would need to lobby the US about the </p>
<p>timetable in advance of the statement.</p>
<p><b>363. </b> In advance of Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker’s visit to London, </p>
<p>Mr Prentice sent some “thoughts” to the FCO on what the issues at stake were in Iraq, </p>
<p>what was expected of the UK by the US and Iraqi governments and what roles the UK </p>
<p>could and should continue to perform in order to meet or manage those expectations.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The advice had been discussed with Lt Gen Rollo, who was reported to be “in broad </p>
<p>agreement”. </p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Prentice’s summary assessment was that the best means to win agreement to </p>
<p>PIC in Basra in November would be a “UK re-commitment now to a convincing range of </p>
<p>longer-term tasks, including in the South”. One of his first impressions was that:</p>
<p>“Uncertainty and therefore anxiety over UK long-term intentions is widespread, </p>
<p>among both senior Iraqis and senior US contacts. And public perceptions, fed by the </p>
<p>media, continue to misinterpret our strategy for Basra province.”</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Prentice wrote that Iraq was important to UK interests both for reputational </p>
<p>reasons and because Iraq’s future was still in the balance; the risk of it descending into </p>
<p>chaos and division, rather having a powerful positive influence in the region, was one </p>
<p>that needed to be tackled:</p>
<p>“Whether they were at the beginning or not, our global CT [counter-terrorism] </p>
<p>interests are certainly now closely engaged in the Iraq theatre.” </p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Prentice acknowledged that the UK’s strategy in southern Iraq had been fully </p>
<p>discussed and agreed by both the US and the Iraqi Government and that no decisions </p>
<p>had yet been taken on medium- and long-term engagement, but also that public </p>
<p>interpretation remained that “we are set on full military withdrawal in the shortest order </p>
<p>possible”. Although he and Lt Gen Rollo and their predecessors had sought to reassure </p>
<p>the US that that was not so, “their confidence in us is becoming more fragile. The </p>
<p>reputational risks in this for the UK are clear.”</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Prentice said that US concerns were understood to centre on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UK would maintain a Divisional Command in MND(SE);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuity for the Basra PRT;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>protection for the US Regional Embassy Office, which had just relocated from </p>
<p>Basra Palace to the COB in order to fit in with UK strategy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing specialist military support for the ISF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued training and mentoring of the ISF;</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ability effectively to counter Iranian influence, including handling the borders; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>protecting the main MNF supply routes through southern Iraq.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Prentice continued:</p>
<p>“We have invested heavily since 2003 in the South, in treasure, blood and </p>
<p>reputation. We should be careful at this late stage not to waste that investment. </p>
<p>We are not currently planning further infrastructure development projects but the </p>
<p>successful programmes in local government capacity building and police leadership </p>
<p>training and mentoring need to continue if they are to achieve sustainable results.”</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Prentice advised that the options for future UK roles and deployments would </p>
<p>need to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reflect UK regional and strategic interests;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>address US expectations; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>take account of UK domestic political requirements;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“satisfy UKMOD force generation constraints and the needs of the Afghanistan </p>
<p>theatre”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide a secure platform in the South for non-military tasks.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> On Basra, Mr Prentice wrote that the formal transfer of responsibility for security </p>
<p>would “have a more psychological than real effect” given that the UK’s re-posturing </p>
<p>to Basra Air Station was, in effect, “de facto PIC”. He understood that US officials </p>
<p>suspected that the idea of de facto PIC was: </p>
<p>“… a device to slide past proper analysis of the conditions for PIC. These suspicions </p>
<p>about PIC are fuelled by their continued uncertainty about our longer term intentions. </p>
<p>The best means to win US support for PIC in Basra on our preferred timing will </p>
<p>therefore be to calm their anxieties about our plans for the South and our continued </p>
<p>military and non-military contribution to building Iraq’s future.”</p>
<p><b>371. </b> On 13 September, Maj Gen Binns reported that Basra remained quiet.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>had been no attacks on the COB in the preceding week and a “decrease in collateral </p>
<p>casualties, especially around Basra Palace”. While the situation remained fragile, there </p>
<p>were positive indications to suggest that the militias had increased their contacts with the </p>
<p>ISF and were moving towards a political accommodation. </p>
<p><b>372. </b> Gen Mohan had attended a meeting of the “Basra Security Forum”, facilitated </p>
<p>by OMS, and reported that it had been well attended by all the major parties except </p>
<p>Fadilah. Maj Gen Binns observed that this was the first time that there had been </p>

<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>major cross-party discussion in Basra, something that would have been inconceivable </p>
<p>a month earlier. </p>
<p><b>373. </b> Maj Gen Binns also reported that he had received Lt Gen Odierno’s response to </p>
<p>his recommendations for PIC. Lt Gen Odierno agreed that Basra continued to make </p>
<p>progress and projected that Basra would transition in November, with an announcement </p>
<p>the preceding month. Maj Gen Binns reported: </p>
<p>“The sting in the tail is that this is not a recommendation; he considers that more </p>
<p>time is needed to further assess the impact of Mohan and Jalil (in particular the </p>
<p>effect the deployment of the National Police assets that Jalil has been provided </p>
<p>has upon the security situation), cites the uncertainty over the fate of Waili … </p>
<p>and has concerns regarding … reports of militia influence with the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces (ISF).”</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Maj Gen Binns judged: </p>
<p>“None of these really give me cause for concern. The ISF has no more militia </p>
<p>influence in Basra than anywhere else in the country … Mohan and Jalil have </p>
<p>already proved themselves: a week on Basra is not burning and both Mohan and </p>
<p>Jalil have delivered on their promises of more resources.”</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Looking ahead to 2008, Maj Gen Binns warned:</p>
<p>“… we are in danger of being seduced by the current lull in attacks against MNF. </p>
<p>The crux is the need to move away from what is seen by the Iraqis as the offensive </p>
<p>capability of an occupying force, to one that is focused on Military Assistance and </p>
<p>Redevelopment. This progression will increase Iraqi self reliance and develop </p>
<p>the economic and political environment necessary to secure external commercial </p>
<p>investment. Seeing the political and economic Lines Of Operation undertaken by </p>
<p>the FCO and DFID move to the forefront, with the military footprint reducing to </p>
<p>provide the force protection and an enhanced BMATT [British Military Advisory and </p>
<p>Training Team] role. We are reasonably confident that our engagement with the Shia </p>
<p>polity proves this is the way ahead, although, inevitably, as this is Iraq, there will be </p>
<p>difficult moments.”</p>
<p><b>376. </b> In a Current Assessment Note on Iranian support to JAM Special Groups, issued </p>
<p>on 13 September, a CIG assessed that the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds </p>
<p>Force (IRGC QF) was continuing to provide “<b>training, financial support and weaponry </b></p>
<p><b>to Shia militants attacking Multi-National Forces (MNF) across Iraq</b>”.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> JAM Special </p>
<p>Groups were receiving significant help. </p>

<p>Special Groups’.  </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>377. </b> The CIG judged that it was unclear how the Special Groups would respond to </p>
<p>the recent “freeze” on JAM activity by Muqtada al-Sadr, but doubted that it would affect </p>
<p>Iran’s influence.</p>
<p><b>378. </b> The Assessment Note continued:</p>
<p>“… we judge that <b>IRGC QF control over these special groups is far from total</b>. </p>
<p>The special groups are using Iranian weaponry to target Shia rivals against Iranian </p>
<p>wishes … And … there is increasing division between leaders of some of the special </p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>“In many areas the distinction between special groups and more militant elements of </p>
<p>mainstream JAM is becoming increasingly blurred as Muqtada al-Sadr’s control of </p>
<p>the latter ebbs, leaving them more open to Iranian influence …”</p>
<p><b>379. </b> On 13 September, President Bush made a speech on Iraq.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> Describing the </p>
<p>challenge there as “formidable”, he nonetheless pointed to the successes of the surge in </p>
<p>Baghdad and Anbar. He said:</p>
<p>“Because of this success, General Petraeus believes we have now reached </p>
<p>the point where we can maintain our gains with fewer American forces. He has </p>
<p>recommended that we not replace about 2,200 Marines scheduled to leave Anbar </p>
<p>province later this month. In addition, he says it will be possible to bring home an </p>
<p>Army combat brigade, for a total force reduction of 5,700 troops by Christmas. </p>
<p>And he expects that by July, we will be able to reduce our troop levels in Iraq from </p>
<p>20 combat brigades to 15.”</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Having consulted with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, other members of his national </p>
<p>security team, Iraqi officials and leaders of both parties in Congress, President Bush </p>
<p>announced that he had accepted Gen Petraeus’ recommendations. President Bush </p>
<p>directed that Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker report again to Congress in </p>
<p>March 2008 with “a fresh assessment of the situation in Iraq and of the troop levels and </p>
<p>resources we need to meet our national security objectives”. </p>
<p><b>381. </b> Mr Prentice reported to the FCO on 13 September that it looked likely agreement </p>
<p>would be reached to renew resolution 1723, on the understanding that it would be the </p>
<p>last time and that a new bilateral US/Iraq security arrangement would be put in place by </p>
<p>the end of 2008.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Mr Prentice commented that there was a new US team in Baghdad, which had no </p>
<p>corporate experience of the negotiations that led to resolution 1723. Those officials had </p>
<p>told him that their interpretation was that a long-term partnership should include coalition </p>
<p>partners. Mr Prentice had explained to them why moving to a security relationship </p>

<p>without a UN resolution would be problematic for the UK, but suggested that this would </p>
<p>be an important point to reinforce with other US interlocutors. </p>
<p><b>383. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that, despite this concern, he had felt “absolutely joined </p>
<p>at the hip” with his US colleagues, who had invited him to sit in on their negotiations </p>
<p>with the Iraqis on the text of a new resolution in order to ensure that the UK’s legal </p>
<p>requirements were satisfied in the resulting text.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>384. </b> On 14 September, Mr Brown said publicly that the UK would meet its </p>
<p>responsibilities and honour its obligations in Iraq.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> Decisions on the strength of </p>
<p>UK forces would “continue to depend on conditions on the ground” but would be </p>
<p>a UK choice. </p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Prentice discussed Basra in his introductory meeting with Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>on 15 September.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> Prime Minister Maliki agreed that Gen Mohan and Maj Gen Jalil </p>
<p>had done an excellent job in Basra. He had authorised extra resources to sustain </p>
<p>the momentum. He was optimistic that a solution could be found that would result in </p>
<p>the replacement of Governor Waili so that Basra would be ready for PIC within the </p>
<p>next two months, and that arrangements would be “well under way” by Mr Brown’s </p>
<p>October statement. </p>
<p><b>386. </b> Prime Minister Maliki emphasised that, despite the ISF’s readiness to take on </p>
<p>security responsibility, the UK should be certain about its capacity to fulfil its agreed </p>
<p>future roles for the next phase. Mr Prentice assured him that was the case.</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Mr Prentice also discussed the likelihood of renewing resolution 1723 during his </p>
<p>introductory call with Prime Minister Maliki and also with Dr Rubaie.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> He reported </p>
<p>that Prime Minister Maliki believed some change in the MNF mandate was inevitable, </p>
<p>reflecting the changed situation in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>388. </b> Dr Rubaie confirmed that negotiations on the resolution should begin formally in </p>
<p>October, at the same time as talks on the content of a future US/Iraqi bilateral security </p>
<p>agreement. He wanted that bilateral agreement to be in place by January 2009 and </p>
<p>asked whether the UK would be interested in a similar relationship which would </p>
<p>encompass political and economic development as well as security. </p>
<p><b>389. </b> Mr Prentice said that the UK would still need a firm legal basis for its continued </p>
<p>presence in Iraq and would need to know more about the thinking about a bilateral/</p>
<p>trilateral security relationship before committing. Obviously the UK could not be bound </p>
<p>by any US/Iraqi negotiations to which it had not been party. Dr Rubaie agreed with </p>

<p>his suggestion that the UK should join the US/Iraqi negotiation group (the High Level </p>
<p>Working Group).</p>
<p><b>390. </b> On 15 September, the Sadrists withdrew from the UIA grouping in protest at </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government’s failure to meet their demands for an unbiased investigation </p>
<p>into the clashes between JAM and Badr forces during the holy pilgrimage to Karbala </p>
<p>in August.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Their action, together with the withdrawal of Fadhila in March, left the UIA (which </p>
<p>had originally held 128 of the 275 seats in the Council of Representatives) with only </p>
<p>81 seats. Attempts to join forces with the Sunni Islamic Party and to encourage Fadhila </p>
<p>to rejoin the Alliance had failed, leaving Prime Minister Maliki vulnerable to attempts from </p>
<p>others to oust him (former Prime Minister Ja’afari had been making moves to do so), </p>
<p>creating a wider destabilising effect on the Baghdad political scene. </p>
<p><b>392. </b> Mr Prentice commented:</p>
<p>“Our interest, and the higher Iraqi interest, remains the emergence of a competent, </p>
<p>inclusive administration able to command a majority in the CoR [Council of </p>
<p>Representatives] for its programme. Maliki is leaching parliamentary strength but is </p>
<p>far from finished … The better result would still be Hashemi and Tawafuq’s return to </p>
<p>government and the CoR’s endorsement of a Maliki-led Cabinet refreshed with new </p>
<p>technocrat recruits.”</p>
<p><b>393. </b> The leader of the Anbar “Awakening”, Sheikh Sittar, was murdered in mid-</p>
<p>September. AQ-I claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> In his weekly report, Lt Gen Rollo described </p>
<p>Sheikh Sittar’s death as “most unwelcome news”, commenting that it was “too early to </p>
<p>tell how Sittar’s death will affect the security environment in Anbar – in the short term the </p>
<p>province has remained calm, with tribal leaders vowing to continue his work”. </p>
<p><b>394. </b> Lt Gen Rollo also reported that a feared spike of violence in Iraq around the time </p>
<p>of Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus’ testimony to Congress, which was also the </p>
<p>week before Ramadan, had not materialised. Lt Gen Rollo contrasted the attack rate in </p>
<p>the week before Ramadan in 2006 (986 attacks, averaging 140 per day) with the figures </p>
<p>for 2007 (569, averaging 81 per day).</p>

<p><b>396. </b> Maj Gen Binns explained that he needed to be able to approve a deal at short </p>
<p>notice in order to “keep the process alive”. </p>
<p><b>397. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 again on </p>
<p>18 September and said that “If the peace held there would be further releases in 23 days </p>
<p>or so.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> JAM1 said that “it was time for us, the British, to establish proper plans to </p>
<p>exploit this period of reduction in hostilities. There should be three clear headings: </p>
<p>Security, Economics, Politics, each to be followed by an agreed plan.”</p>
<p><b>398. </b> Reporting to London following the meeting, the officials explained that hopes of </p>
<p>demonstrable development work in Basra attributed to the British had been dashed by </p>
<p>the PRT, whose “key themes are empowerment and mentoring – nothing that smacks </p>
<p>either of MNF direction or dictation”.</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Browne reported to Cabinet on 18 September that there had been little change </p>
<p>in Iraq over the past week: Basra was still calm and the level of attacks on UK forces at </p>
<p>Basra Air Station had reduced to “a very low level”.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> This was primarily “a reflection of </p>
<p>political developments within the various factions of Jaysh al-Mahdi, with some wanting </p>
<p>to participate in the political process and others … who were inclined to violence”. </p>
<p>Both he and Mr Brown would be meeting Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker </p>
<p>that afternoon with a view to establishing US thinking on the medium to longer term, </p>
<p>including expectations of the UK. </p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr Brown said that there would need to be a discussion on Iraq in Cabinet in the </p>
<p>next few weeks. </p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Miliband, accompanied by ACM Stirrup and officials, met </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker on 18 September.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> Mr Brown underlined how </p>
<p>successful the handover of Basra Palace had been. Gen Petraeus agreed and said that </p>
<p>a decision on PIC could be possible later that year, but there were issues to be resolved, </p>
<p>including the status of the Governor. Nevertheless:</p>
<p>“By the time of the Prime Minister’s statement in October, it might be possible to give </p>
<p>a sense of the timeframes, with November/December as a possible PIC target.” </p>
<p><b>402. </b> Gen Petraeus added that he considered it would be important to retain a divisional </p>
<p>HQ in Basra, given its political and economic significance. </p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Brown said that economic development of the South remained a major UK </p>
<p>priority (see Section 10.2). Gen Petraeus said there were a number of initiatives on </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>260</p>
<p>which the UK should engage, including clearance of the port, the contract for which was </p>
<p>out to tender. </p>
<p><b>404. </b> At the end of the discussion Mr Brown highlighted three areas for follow-up:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further discussion, including with the Iraqis, of the timeframe for Basra PIC;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an enhanced UK effort on economic development, including the port; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further US/UK discussion of long-term force requirements.</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Brown asked Mr McDonald to take forward work on these three strands of </p>
<p>activity during his visit to Washington the following week.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> On 19 September, MOD officials sought Mr Browne’s agreement for Maj Gen Binns </p>
<p>to release up to 10 further internees in two groups of five, if necessary, “as a bridging </p>
<p>measure pending negotiation of a longer-term agreement”.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> The minute explained:</p>
<p>“… GOC MND(SE) is concerned that the discussions have hit an awkward patch </p>
<p>and that the already fragile security and political dynamics may unravel, causing </p>
<p>a breakdown in the cessation of violence. There are already some initial signs </p>
<p>that JAM Secret Cells are stepping up efforts to resume attacks on the COB … an </p>
<p>MND(SE) response to these attacks may trigger a wider escalation of violence.</p>
<p>“… we wish to give the GOC the flexibility to manage these discussions in the short-</p>
<p>term, pending agreement to a longer term negotiating strategy. The GOC believes </p>
<p>that it may be necessary to release one or possibly even two further batches of </p>
<p>five internees in order to prevent a breakdown in the discussions. The GOC judges </p>
<p>that a release of up to ten people over Ramadan would be enough to buy sufficient </p>
<p>time properly to consider with our interlocutors how to align our other activities to </p>
<p>deliver our desired long term objectives. If we do not have this flexibility, and delay </p>
<p>any further releases until we have agreed a longer term plan, there is serious risk </p>
<p>that the Secret Cells will gain sufficient authority within JAM to resume their attacks </p>
<p>against the coalition.”</p>
<p><b>407. </b> The advice reported that only one of those proposed for release by JAM1 had </p>
<p>previously been judged to be high risk, and MOD officials had informed MND(SE) that </p>
<p>he should only be released if “absolutely essential”. Advice on long-term strategy would </p>
<p>be accompanied by advice on presentation, following a request by Mr Browne in light of </p>
<p>comments made by Gen Petraeus in his testimony to Congress. </p>
<p><b>408. </b> On 20 September, Mr Browne marked the advice “agreed”.</p>

<p><b>409. </b> Mr Richard Jones, British Consul General in Basra, wrote to Mr Frank Baker, FCO </p>

<p>not clear to what extent Mr Baker had been kept informed.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>410. </b> After describing the process of negotiation and detainee releases, and the </p>
<p>accompanying reduction in IDF, Mr Jones concluded: “This is the context of optimism </p>
<p>within which the military have drawn up their options for a future posture in southeastern </p>
<p>Iraq, which are far more forward-leaning than they would have been before the </p>
<p>summer break.” </p>
<p><b>411. </b> Mr Jones described maintaining the relationship with JAM1 and keeping “the plates </p>
<p>spinning in the complex relationship between JAM/OMS, Badr/ISCI, Fadhila and  </p>
<p>Mohan/the ISF/the GoI” as “the sine qua non for sustained quiet in the province”. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> Maj Gen Binns reported to Lt Gen Houghton on 20 September that, after returning </p>
<p>to Iraq, Gen Petraeus had guided his staff towards a goal of transition to PIC in Basra in </p>
<p>mid-December.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>413. </b> Maj Gen Binns also wrote that information from multiple sources indicated that the </p>
<p>security situation in Basra was improving and the Iraqi Police and Army were conducting </p>
<p>joint military/police patrols within the city. Basrawis seemed “reassured” by this, though </p>
<p>they remained concerned that the militias were using the cease-fire period to reorganise </p>
<p>and resupply. Criminality and gangsterism continued to be “endemic”. Maj Gen Binns </p>
<p>considered that the security situation was best summed up as “bad, but a lot better now”.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> AM Peach told the Chiefs of Staff on 20 September that the Iraqi Government had </p>
<p>“welcomed” the Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testimony and that:</p>
<p>“PM Maliki was reportedly buoyed by the report and had interpreted the lack of direct </p>
<p>personal criticism towards him as a sign of international support.”</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>415. </b> The Chiefs of Staff observed that the next review of progress in Iraq commissioned </p>
<p>from Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in March 2008 “had the potential to create </p>
<p>a further strategic pause, which could make longer term UK planning problematic”. </p>
<p><b>416. </b> The MIG met on 22 September.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> According to an account of the meeting by a </p>
<p>government official working closely with the military who had attended it, Maj Gen Binns </p>
<p>wanted to use the time bought by the next detainee releases “to turn the [NAME OF </p>
<p>OPERATION] cease-fire into a genuine peace process”. The key aim was to bind JAM </p>
<p>into the process so that it continued when there were no more detainees to release. </p>
<p>A Basra political conference outside Iraq or a development conference in the city itself </p>
<p>were possible means for doing so. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>417. </b> The official continued:</p>
<p>“Basra City remains a difficult place with JAM carrying arms on the streets with </p>
<p>impunity … But JAM would have been worse if they had unambiguously bombed </p>
<p>coalition forces out of the city …</p>
<p>“The risk is the further weakening of already-weak Iraqi state control in these </p>
<p>southern provinces. HMCG [the British Consul General in Basra] is at sea because </p>
<p>his instructions to promote and develop the democratic structures of the new Iraqi </p>
<p>state are out of touch with what is happening on the ground. The aim of any Basra </p>
<p>political conference has to be to bridge the gap between the necessary deals done </p>
<p>with the militias and the ineffectual provincial council, to say nothing of the governor. </p>
<p>Everyone has a sense that this process should culminate with fresh elections, which </p>
<p>would be when the militias such as JAM would theoretically swap their military power </p>
<p>for political power, as Muqtada al-Sadr now appears to want. But it remains unclear </p>
<p>how we will reach this point. In such circumstances, we view the idea of a political </p>
<p>conference as a sensible stopgap.” </p>
<p><b>418. </b> In his weekly report on 23 September, Lt Gen Rollo wrote that after returning to </p>
<p>Iraq Gen Petraeus told him that he thought his visit to London had been: </p>
<p>“… a great success: the mood was quite different from February. Everyone was </p>
<p>on side; there was a commitment to Iraq, and a common view on tasks over </p>
<p>the winter.”</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>419. </b> The MNF-I had formed a working group to look at the conditions for PIC and the </p>
<p>tasks for the UK military beyond that. Lt Gen Rollo’s view was that the UK’s planning </p>
<p>focus should be on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarifying the mission and tasks anticipated for next summer in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>producing force packages to carry out these tasks, with and without US support, </p>
<p>recognising that the US would have also substantially reduced numbers by next </p>
<p>summer;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>thinking through the implications of events going better or worse than </p>
<p>anticipated; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>thinking through the end-game and agreeing it with the US.</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 again on </p>

<p><b>421. </b> The report included the comment: </p>
<p>“This might be a straw in the wind. Or it might represent a significant opportunity to </p>
<p>stretch out for a much larger prize …”</p>
<p><b>422. </b> Sir John Scarlett and Mr McDonald met on 24 September to discuss Iraq.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> </p>
<p>According to his record of the meeting, during the discussion Sir John observed that </p>
<p>decisions about the pace of the UK’s drawdown in Basra needed to be taken “with a </p>
<p>clear eye to the current cease-fire”. It was important that the JIC reached a judgement </p>
<p>on the robustness of the cease-fire and what was keeping it going. </p>
<p><b>423. </b> Sir John considered that creating a “long-term calm” in Basra would require </p>
<p>“energetic” reconstruction and political action.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> The MCNS discussed Basra at length at its 25 September meeting.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> The Minister </p>
<p>of State for National Security, Mr Sherna al-Wa’ili, reported, based on his recent visit </p>
<p>to Basra, that it was “not as bad as portrayed”. During the visit he met Gen Mohan </p>
<p>and Gen Jalil, who had claimed the problems were due to foreign interference and the </p>
<p>many political groups struggling for power. He considered that Gen Mohan was doing </p>
<p>a good job, but needed additional support from Baghdad and more forces. Gen Jalil </p>
<p>also needed additional forces plus support in retraining 6,000 police officers and more </p>
<p>materiel support, including fuel and equipment.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh said that he had met 12 cross-party Basrawi </p>
<p>MPs at their request. Their assessment was that the situation was bad and they </p>
<p>expected it to get worse. The numbers of assassinations and attacks were rising and </p>
<p>there had been only one arrest. The MPs were critical of both Gen Mohan and Gen Jalil </p>
<p>and argued that it was necessary to bring in forces from outside the local area. </p>
<p><b>426. </b> Deputy Prime Minister Saleh said that it would be important to ensure that </p>
<p>politicking between the main political parties in the Council of Representatives did not </p>
<p>adversely affect the situation in Basra. He concluded that Baghdad-based Basrawi </p>
<p>politicians should be encouraged to keep their local representatives in line.</p>
<p><b>427. </b> Mr Prentice commented:</p>
<p>“The discussion on Basra reflects the continued unease in the Iraqi system about the </p>
<p>situation there. We are not going to overcome this in the coming weeks as we move </p>
<p>towards a decision on PIC. But we will continue to address it with all interlocutors, </p>
<p>including the incessantly gloomy (and self-interested) MPs: taking them through </p>
<p>all the work we have done to improve Basra’s security and economic situation; </p>
<p>underlining that we will continue to provide support post-PIC; but emphasising that </p>
<p>the GoI and others in positions of influence must also play their part in working </p>

<p>the US – whose REO [Regional Embassy Office] persists in sending out downbeat </p>
<p>reports, contributing to US disquiet over Basra, most recently predicting a rise in </p>
<p>Shia on Shia and other Islamic violence.</p>
<p>“Overall it is welcome that the centre is finally paying attention to Basra and Basra’s </p>
<p>needs: their worries reflect a growing sense of ownership, which we have long </p>
<p>wished to see.”</p>
<p><b>428. </b> On 26 September, Maj Gen Binns wrote to Lt Gen Houghton, observing that he </p>
<p>had not received a formal response to his minute of 16 September, which asked for </p>
<p>authority to negotiate the best deal possible without seeking further clearance.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>minute had instead resulted in a request from PJHQ for a campaign plan. Having seen </p>
<p>an early draft of one, Maj Gen Binns concluded that “the work would be nugatory. The </p>
<p>operation is too dynamic.” He believed that enthusiasm for the negotiations was waning </p>
<p>in London, and asked Lt Gen Houghton for instructions. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Maj Gen Binns asked Lt Gen Houghton to agree that “end state” should be </p>
<p>“enduring security which facilitates and preserves a political climate suitable for </p>
<p>development”. He wrote:</p>
<p>“I am operating with current headroom to release two further tranches of five </p>
<p>internees on 28 September and 5 Oct. I need more headroom; another five for </p>
<p>release on 12 Oct and then a further 15 to be released between 13 Oct and 3 Nov </p>
<p>in order to keep the process alive.”</p>
<p><b>430. </b> In his weekly update on 27 September, Maj Gen Binns commented that the UK </p>
<p>should be seeking to:</p>
<p>“… marshal its available and not inconsiderable resources to convince the US </p>
<p>hierarchy that PIC is doable so that we can get past PIC and work on the post-PIC </p>
<p>mission. The key point is to trust the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own destiny, </p>
<p>having given them the tools to do so.”</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>431. </b> The MNF-I had established a working group to review the situation and </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns intended to use the forthcoming visit to Basra by its leader, </p>
<p>US Major General Roberson, to “take the initiative and enlist his aid to get Basra to PIC”.</p>
<p><b>432. </b> In the same report, Maj Gen Binns reported that a car bomb attack at a police </p>
<p>station in Basra on 25 September had killed three and wounded 17 others. He wrote that </p>
<p>car bomb attacks were a “relative rarity” in MND(SE). Locally, the attack was believed to </p>
<p>have been carried out by AQ. </p>

<p>265</p>
<p><b>433. </b> A separate explosion at a Sunni mosque near Basra the following day, which </p>
<p>killed five people, looked to have been a sectarian retaliation fuelled by this belief. </p>
<p>MNF considered that the earlier attack could well have been intra-Shia violence.</p>
<p><b>434. </b> On 28 September, government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 </p>
<p>again. The day before the meeting JAM1 had telephoned to warn that JAM elements </p>
<p>had identified British soldiers deployed to the north of Basra, and were preparing an </p>
<p>attack.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> The officials alerted MND(SE) and the troops were extracted immediately.</p>
<p><b>435. </b> The previous day’s incident was not discussed during the meeting which began </p>
<p>by focusing on an IDF attack on Basra Air Station that morning. The officials reported </p>
<p>that Maj Gen Binns had been talked out of cancelling the release of five detainees due </p>
<p>that day as a result, adding “some still have not quite got the concept that we are buying </p>
<p>[JAM1’s] support and influence to advance peace, not peace itself”. </p>
<p><b>436. </b> The officials then asked JAM1 what JAM members were doing while they were </p>
<p>not fighting – was there a risk that redundancy would inspire boredom and restlessness </p>
<p>and increase the chances of further violence? JAM1 agreed that people needed work. </p>
<p>Possibilities might include the Army, the Police Force, manual work on reconstruction or </p>
<p>learning new skills. </p>
<p><b>437. </b> Mr McDonald discussed future plans for Iraq with Mr Hadley in Washington on </p>
<p>27 September.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> Reporting on their meeting to the MOD, Mr McDonald said he had </p>
<p>explained the UK assumption that PIC would happen in November or December 2007, </p>
<p>after which point the UK would retain a similar military presence until March 2008 </p>
<p>(5,000 troops, 4,500 of which would be based at Basra Air Station). </p>
<p><b>438. </b> Beyond March 2008 the UK aspired to reduce troop numbers in stages </p>
<p>over the spring and summer, to around 1,500. That would require “significant US </p>
<p>support in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>439. </b> Mr Hadley’s staff expressed concern about the numbers after March 2008. They </p>
<p>indicated that the US had hoped that the UK would retain the lead in Basra throughout </p>
<p>2008; the US had not planned to deploy to Basra in large numbers. Gen Petraeus had </p>
<p>already set out the tasks that he wanted the UK to fulfil in MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>440. </b> In response, Mr McDonald said that the UK was already unable to perform </p>
<p>some of those tasks: the UK had therefore “considered the list as a high opening bid”. </p>
<p>Mr McDonald reported that they had discussed “the bare bones of a compromise”: the </p>
<p>UK would retain 4,500 troops in Basra until March 2008 (the “tactical overwatch” period); </p>
<p>between March and November (“operational overwatch”) the UK would reduce its troops </p>
<p>to 2,000-2,500, focused on training and mentoring but retaining some intervention </p>
<p>capacity. In extremis, they would need to rely on “over-the-horizon US support”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>441. </b> After November 2008, it might be possible to move to “strategic overwatch”, with </p>
<p>re-intervention capacity based elsewhere in Iraq and in Kuwait. Mr McDonald and </p>
<p>Mr Hadley agreed that “it was now important for our senior military personnel to discuss </p>
<p>the relative merits of the plans”.</p>
<p><b>442. </b> Once Mr McDonald had returned to the UK he briefed Mr Brown on the discussion. </p>
<p>When Mr Brown and President Bush spoke by video conference on 28 September, </p>
<p>the President said he had also been briefed on the meeting and was comfortable </p>
<p>with UK plans. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> Basra “took top billing” again at the 30 September MCNS meeting.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> With the </p>
<p>exception of Dr Safa al-Safi (the Acting Minister of Justice), the Committee agreed that </p>
<p>Gen Mohan had performed well in bringing Basra under control and that his tenure </p>
<p>should be extended. </p>
<p><b>444. </b> Mr Prentice commented that the “general tone of Iraqi debate on Basra seems to </p>
<p>be improving. General Petraeus was especially supportive.” </p>

<p><b>445. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 on the morning of </p>
<p>1 October.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> In order to mitigate his personal risk, JAM1 asked for future negotiations </p>
<p>to be conducted through his lawyer. Under pressure from senior Sadrists, JAM1 also </p>
<p>stressed the importance of his interlocutors having broader contacts with JAM, to protect </p>
<p>the agreement that had been reached if anything should happen to him. </p>
<p><b>446. </b> One of the officials commented:</p>
<p>“Seen from here, these latest developments emphasise the need for a rapid </p>
<p>broadening of political engagement with the Sadrists in Basra.”</p>
<p><b>447. </b> On 1 October, at the request of the FCO and the MOD, the JIC examined the </p>
<p>prospects for political stability in Basra and the threat to UK forces up to spring 2008.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>448. </b> The Assessment included graphs showing the recent reduction in attacks on MNF </p>
<p>bases in Basra, from a high of 226 attacks in July to nine in September. </p>
<p><b>449. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I. No single political party dominates politics in Basra. Politicians use their positions </p>
<p>primarily to pursue personal power and wealth. Most are supported by Shia militias </p>

<p>267</p>
<p>who are in de facto control over many districts of Basra City. Baghdad’s ability to </p>
<p>determine events is very limited.</p>
<p>“II. The primary reason for the recent reduction in attacks against the Multi-National </p>
<p>Forces (MNF) in Basra is the negotiation between MND(SE) and [JAM1]. It is </p>
<p>unclear how long this can be sustained when or if all JAM personnel have been </p>
<p>released … in the absence of continuing visible momentum towards full departure of </p>
<p>UK forces we judge that the point would eventually be reached when JAM sees the </p>
<p>balance of advantage in resuming their campaign against the MNF. Sporadic attacks </p>
<p>will continue in any case.</p>
<p>“III. As the MNF presence reduces and provincial elections approach, intra-Shia </p>
<p>violence is likely to intensify. We cannot predict the scale. Concern to avoid </p>
<p>provoking US intervention, pressure from national Shia political leader, Grand </p>
<p>Ayatollah al-Sistani and probably the Iranians, and a desire among at least some </p>
<p>of Basra’s political leaders and security officials to reach local accommodations will </p>
<p>all help restrain the militias. If street fighting did break out, it is likely to be of short </p>
<p>duration, but in the worst case could surpass the small-scale skirmishes in other </p>
<p>provinces that have transitioned to Iraqi control.</p>
<p>“IV. The Iraqis would only call for MNF re-intervention in Basra as a last resort, in the </p>
<p>event of violence over an extended period beyond the capacity of the Iraqi army and </p>
<p>police. Locally-raised army units are unlikely to be willing or able to cope in the event </p>
<p>of serious and sustained intra-Shia clashes, but new units are being deployed which </p>
<p>are loyal to the central government and are likely to be more effective in dealing with </p>
<p>low level violence. The largely ineffective local police are heavily infiltrated by militias </p>
<p>and would take sides in any fighting.</p>
<p>“V. Iran’s aim is to speed the withdrawal of coalition forces while making their life </p>
<p>as difficult as possible so long as they remain: the Iranians will continue providing </p>
<p>training, weaponry and encouragement for Shia extremists to attack the MNF. Iran’s </p>
<p>ability to determine political outcomes or ease intra-Shia tensions is limited: it is </p>
<p>unlikely to want to take sides in the event of clashes between rival Shia factions.”</p>
<p><b>450. </b> The JIC assessed that Muqtada al-Sadr’s public call for a cessation of JAM </p>
<p>violence might also have been a factor in the reduced number of attacks against the </p>
<p>MNF. Other possible factors included a positive reaction by the militias and their political </p>
<p>sponsors to the withdrawal of UK forces from Basra City and efforts by Gen Mohan and </p>
<p>Gen Jalil to improve the performance of the ISF. </p>
<p><b>451. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“It is unclear how long the lull can be sustained. Its success to date suggests that … </p>
<p>has the backing of the majority of mainstream JAM in Basra for his tactics, despite </p>
<p>initial reporting showing that some local commanders were sceptical … personal </p>
<p>ambitions are unclear … suggested that JAM’s aim following withdrawal of UK </p>

<p>216</p>
<p> He met Prime Minister Maliki, </p>
<p>Vice President Hashemi, Deputy Prime Minister Saleh, Gen Petraeus and </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker in Baghdad, and Maj Gen Binns and Mr Jones in Basra. </p>
<p><b>453. </b> The objectives for the trip were to underline:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK commitment to Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of building on security progress by making a decision soon to </p>
<p>transfer to PIC;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for progress on reconciliation; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that economic progress was necessary as a strategic priority.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Brown was provided with a briefing note on negotiations with JAM1 that </p>
<p>had taken place “over the last year”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> It said that JAM had been pushed towards an </p>
<p>accommodation with the MNF by a combination of:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>resolute British military action in the first half of 2007;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a growing sense that Iranian tactical support was leading to Iranian infiltration </p>
<p>of the Sadrist movement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a realisation that the UK really did plan to leave Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the risk that British forces might be replaced by US troops;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM activists in MND(SE) detention feared that a continued insurgency might </p>
<p>leave them marginalised.”</p>
<p><b>455. </b> The briefing note said that the challenge was to broaden the existing cease-fire </p>
<p>into a political process with backing from a wider range of Iraqi groups and the central </p>
<p>government. Ideally this would transform Iraqi perceptions of UK forces as an army of </p>
<p>occupation into acceptance of, and support for, a continuing UK military assistance and </p>
<p>development mission, and would expand the process beyond MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>456. </b> JAM1 was reported to want increased and visible UK development assistance for </p>
<p>Basra province as well as more detainee releases. Until the process included political </p>
<p>and economic elements, the cease-fire would “remain fragile and possibly short-term”.</p>
<p><b>457. </b> A manuscript note on the briefing note by Mr Brown’s Private Secretary recorded </p>
<p>that Mr Brown was grateful for the briefing and for the actions it explained. He would be </p>

<p>269</p>
<p><b>458. </b> In their 45-minute bilateral meeting, Prime Minister Maliki told Mr Brown that 2008 </p>
<p>would be the “year of reconstruction”.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> The Iraqi Government was working towards </p>
<p>PIC in Basra on 21 November, and hoped to announce that on 1 November. Mr Brown </p>
<p>welcomed this progress and emphasised the importance of following up transition with </p>
<p>progress on political reconciliation.</p>
<p><b>459. </b> An account of Mr Brown’s visit to Basra Air Station by government officials working </p>
<p>closely with the military reported that Maj Gen Binns said “the situation that he would </p>
<p>brief was wholly dependent on … [NAME OF OPERATION] without which the picture </p>
<p>would be utterly different”.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>460. </b> The officials judged that the FCO briefing attended by Mr Brown had been “thin” </p>
<p>and considered it:</p>
<p>“… dispiriting to hear eager questions about the number of policemen trained </p>
<p>from McDonald and references to the ‘dividends of Op SINBAD’ [see Section 9.5]. </p>
<p>Clearly JIC papers are not going where they should. The impression given of a </p>
<p>Basra growing to stability and majority through the wise tutelage of HMG in its </p>
<p>various forms was fundamentally mendacious. But less grotesquely so than in the </p>
<p>post-SINBAD days.”</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Brown was briefed on the negotiations with JAM1, which made “no secret of </p>
<p>the fragility of the process”. Mr McDonald argued that the reduction in hostilities was a </p>
<p>result of the UK departure from Basra Palace. The officials believed that their graphics </p>
<p>“elegantly disproved this assertion”. The wider JAM cease-fire called by Muqtada al-Sadr </p>
<p>had “camouflaged and perhaps subsidised” the Basra agreement. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Brown told journalists in Baghdad that he believed:</p>
<p>“… within the next two months we can move to Provincial Iraqi Control, and that is </p>
<p>the Iraqis taking responsibility for their own security in the whole of Basra … And I </p>
<p>believe that by the end of the year … a thousand of our troops can be brought back </p>
<p>to the United Kingdom …”</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>463. </b> After returning from Iraq, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary commissioned advice from </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how best to support a Basra Investment Forum;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>greater UK resources for the effort on reconstruction and economic </p>
<p>development;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UK should do more to support the clear up of Umm Qasr port;</p>

<p>how the UK could offer troops in theatre greater access to the internet.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>464. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1’s lawyer </p>
<p>on 3 October, who told them that Muqtada al-Sadr had told JAM1 not to advance </p>
<p>negotiations with the UK any further.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>465. </b> The lawyer argued that JAM1 himself should be released so that he could </p>
<p>convince al-Sadr in person of the need to continue. This request was not repeated by </p>
<p>JAM1 who met the officials later the same day. He indicated that he would send a letter </p>
<p>setting out the case for the negotiations to al-Sadr, whose instruction did not yet reflect </p>
<p>a final decision. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Sir John Scarlett discussed Iraq with Mr McDonald on 3 October.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> Mr McDonald </p>
<p>said that he and Mr Brown were aware of the fragility of the situation in Basra. They did </p>
<p>not necessarily think this affected PIC: that was a political decision and the timing had </p>
<p>been in view for several months, since before negotiations with JAM1 began. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> On 4 October, a government official specialising in the Middle East reported on a </p>
<p>meeting chaired by Mr Day originally intended to discuss a negotiating framework but </p>
<p>which had been extended to cover immediate threats to the deal.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> The official’s report </p>
<p>of the discussion said:</p>
<p>“… there was a general complacency that the cease-fire was in the bag for as long </p>
<p>as we had detainees to release. Emerging British policy in Basra was based on the </p>
<p>firm fact of the cease-fire.”</p>
<p><b>468. </b> If the cease-fire were to collapse, the official reported that Mr Day’s concerns were </p>
<p>casualties, presentational difficulties for the Prime Minister, and difficulty in getting PIC </p>
<p>approved: the “overriding aim of HMG’s policy in MND(SE)”. </p>
<p><b>469. </b> The immediate aim of negotiation therefore “had to be to sustain the cease-fire </p>
<p>until we got to PIC”. A submission, a draft of which was already circulating, would be put </p>
<p>to Ministers setting out the short-term challenge and the potential risks of linking the UK </p>
<p>Government’s success in Basra to JAM. Negotiations would be likely to confer a degree </p>
<p>of legitimacy on JAM1, the long-term implications of which were not obvious. </p>

<p>271</p>
<p><b>470. </b> The note continued:</p>
<p>“We pointed out that just because we engaged in talks, we did not necessarily have </p>
<p>to come to any sort of agreement with JAM, beyond the exchange of detainees for a </p>
<p>lack of IDF. But the aim of such talks was to tie JAM into a political accommodation, </p>
<p>before all of our detainee chips were played and before we had to release [JAM1] </p>
<p>himself. We also commented that we would have little influence over what happened </p>
<p>in Basra after PIC. JAM would be a force whether we liked it or not …”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> The official who was leading on drafting the submission commented after the </p>
<p>meeting that:</p>
<p>“Jon [Day]’s concern (which is shared by SofS) is that we need to be careful we </p>
<p>are not seen to be taking sides in the politics of Basra … he would be much more </p>
<p>comfortable therefore to focus discussion on the security and development axes and </p>
<p>leave the politics to the FCO … after his release.”</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Mr Brown on 5 October setting out his proposals for the UK </p>
<p>military commitment to Iraq during 2008.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> He reported that the MOD had agreed a </p>
<p>revised set of tasks with Gen Petraeus which would be achievable within the force levels </p>
<p>suggested. Mr Browne proposed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>retaining current troops levels (4,500 in Basra plus 500 elsewhere) until </p>
<p>March 2008; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing down to around 2,500 troops from March 2008, focused on training and </p>
<p>mentoring the ISF with “only a limited <i>in extremis</i> re-intervention capability”.</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Mr Browne assessed that this deployment would not require significant US support </p>
<p>in southern Iraq. The estimate of costs from May 2008 was £650m per year. Possible </p>
<p>options beyond November 2008 had not yet been considered. </p>
<p><b>474. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported on 7 October that Basra continued to attract the attention of </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki and the MCNS: “in itself an entirely healthy indication of increasing </p>
<p>acceptance that Basra is their responsibility”.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>475. </b> A recent MOD/MOI delegation to Basra had returned with a list of </p>
<p>recommendations, including on the need to “tighten up border and post security and to </p>
<p>clear selected areas of the town of militias”.</p>
<p><b>476. </b> Lt Gen Rollo also reported that in the margins of Mr Brown’s visit Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>had queried the UK’s long-term intentions in 2009 and had pursued the matter again </p>
<p>with Lt Gen Rollo subsequently. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Gen Petraeus had:</p>
<p>“… asserted that our [the UK’s] line had always been ‘in together, out together’ – </p>
<p>quoting PM Blair as his authority. My response was that we had defined strategic </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq which, when met, would see our departure … While 2009 seems </p>
<p>light years away at present, and retaining flexibility against uncertain future events </p>
<p>will always offer advantages, some further definition on the nature of both our long </p>

<p>be helpful as bilateral arrangements to succeed the proposed Dec 08 UNSCR start </p>
<p>to be discussed.”</p>
<p><b>478. </b> NSID(OD) met for the first time on 8 October.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> The main aim of the meeting, </p>
<p>according to the Cabinet Office steering brief for Mr Brown, was for him to “inform </p>
<p>colleagues of the content of your statement on Iraq, focusing on the military plans and </p>
<p>economic initiative”. </p>
<p><b>479. </b> Ahead of the meeting, Mr Prentice reported that political progress in Baghdad </p>
<p>remained slow.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> Key legislation remained stalled, with the Kurdish parties refusing to </p>
<p>concede ground on revenue sharing and hydrocarbons legislation. Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>still lacked a majority to complete his Cabinet and drive through legislation. The UK </p>
<p>continued to work for the reconvening of the Executive Group but this seemed unlikely </p>
<p>until after Eid, which began the following week.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> At the meeting on 8 October, Mr Brown informed his colleagues that he would be </p>
<p>making a statement on Iraq in Parliament that afternoon, which would reflect the three </p>
<p>key elements he had focused on during his recent visit to Iraq: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>political reconciliation; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic reconstruction; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the security situation.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>481. </b> There had been little progress on political reconciliation but economic </p>
<p>reconstruction in Basra was making better progress, largely as a result of the improved </p>
<p>security environment. The security situation had improved in recent weeks, making </p>
<p>possible the handover of Basra Palace to the Iraqis in September and raising the </p>
<p>possibility of PIC in December. If the current trend continued, it should be possible to </p>
<p>reduce UK forces to around 2,500 by spring 2008. </p>
<p><b>482. </b> In discussion, it was noted that progress on the security situation had been due </p>
<p>to a number of factors, not least of which was the JAM cease-fire. That cease-fire </p>

<p>calm to continue.</p>
<p><b>483. </b> According to Sir John Scarlett’s own account of the meeting, Mr Brown:</p>
<p>“… spoke very strongly on the cease-fire in Basra and the dramatic improvement </p>
<p>in the security situation. This represented a huge opportunity.”</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Brown expressed thanks and admiration for the work on that initiative. </p>
<p><b>485. </b> Sir John recorded that “CDS [ACM Stirrup] argued that we must take the </p>
<p>opportunity to push forward events while the tide was running in our favour”. Mr Brown </p>
<p>endorsed the point that the cease-fire was not simply about prisoner releases; the UK </p>
<p>had to show progress on the political and economic front, on which JAM1 was also </p>
<p>focused. </p>
<p><b>486. </b> In a covering comment, Sir John added that the Prime Minister had:</p>
<p>“… personally … acknowledged the importance of [NAME OF OPERATION] … </p>
<p>He also understands that the effort has to move into the political and economic </p>
<p>sphere and not just the security issue. So there are signs of traction at the top of </p>

<p><b>487. </b> Mr Prentice shared key points from an advance copy of Mr Brown’s statement to </p>
<p>Parliament with Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker, and shared its full text shortly </p>
<p>before Mr Brown began to speak in Parliament. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Prentice reported that Gen Petraeus had been “complimentary” about the </p>
<p>statement, describing it as the culmination of “a good process of consultation altogether” </p>
<p>which has worked out “a sensible way ahead” on UK force levels.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>489. </b> Both Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker repeated the US concern that the </p>
<p>UK presence should be centred on Basra, not elsewhere in southern Iraq. Mr Prentice </p>
<p>assured both that this was not in doubt: the geographical description “Southern Iraq” </p>
<p>was simply used to distinguish UK forces from those elsewhere in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>490. </b> Gen Petraeus also emphasised the need to be cautious about the stability of </p>
<p>improved conditions in Basra: the underlying factors behind it were fragile and the UK </p>
<p>should be ready to respond if conditions required it.</p>
<p><b>491. </b> On 8 October, Lt Gen Odierno recommended to Gen Petraeus that Basra </p>
<p>should move to PIC in December.</p>

<p>militia influence within the Basra ISF. Maj Gen Binns commented: “Not a ringing </p>
<p>endorsement, but a positive step and an endorsement we’ve been trying to achieve </p>
<p>since April this year.” </p>
<p><b>492. </b> On the afternoon of 8 October, Mr Brown told the House of Commons that the UK </p>
<p>expected to establish PIC in Basra in the next two months and that:</p>
<p>“As part of the process of putting the Iraqi forces in the lead in Basra, we have just </p>
<p>gone through a demanding operation which involved consolidating our forces at </p>
<p>Basra airport. That was successfully completed, as planned, last month. The next </p>
<p>important stage in delivering our strategy to hand over security to the Iraqis is a </p>
<p>move from a combat role in the rest of Basra province to overwatch, which will </p>
<p>itself have two distinct stages. In the first, the British forces that remain in Iraq will </p>
<p>have the following tasks: training and mentoring the Iraqi army and police force; </p>
<p>securing supply routes and policing the Iran-Iraq border; and the ability to come to </p>
<p>the assistance of the Iraqi security forces when called upon. Then in the spring of </p>
<p>next year – and guided as always by the advice of our military commanders – we </p>
<p>plan to move to a second stage of overwatch where the coalition would maintain a </p>
<p>more limited re-intervention capacity and where the main focus will be on training </p>
<p>and mentoring.</p>
<p>“… after detailed discussions with our military commanders, a meeting of the </p>
<p>national security committee, discussions with the Iraqi Government and our allies </p>
<p>and, subject, of course, to conditions on the ground – we plan from next spring </p>
<p>to reduce force numbers in southern Iraq to a figure of 2,500 … In both stages of </p>
<p>overwatch, around 500 logistics and support personnel will be based outside Iraq </p>
<p>but elsewhere in the region. At all times … we will be honouring our obligations to </p>
<p>the Iraqi people and their security, and ensuring the safety of our forces.”</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Mr Brown also announced a new policy on resettlement support for locally </p>
<p>employed staff (see Section 15.1) and emphasised the importance of economic </p>
<p>reconstruction “to ensure that ordinary Iraqis have a stake in the future”. </p>
<p><b>494. </b> In the Parliamentary debate that followed, Mr Brown was asked whether he was </p>
<p>satisfied that the Iraqi Security Forces were capable of maintaining the security of </p>
<p>southern Iraq without UK support, whether the numbers of troops being retained was </p>
<p>sufficient to ensure that the troops could protect themselves adequately and whether </p>
<p>there was continuing value in retaining any military presence in Iraq.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>495. </b> In response, Mr Brown explained that he was acting on the advice of his military </p>

<p>their assistance. Asked whether the move from Basra Palace to the air base had shown </p>
<p>that the UK presence was part of the problem, Mr Brown commented:</p>
<p>“… it was before our troops withdrew from Basra Palace that the security situation in </p>
<p>that area became a great deal calmer. Because we are training up the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces, they are in a position to police and provide security to that area. Far from </p>
<p>moving quickly out of Iraq … our presence to train and mentor [the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces] is an important element in bringing about a calm, or calmer, security </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>to al-Sadr about the positive effect of the agreement. JAM1 told the officials that “our </p>
<p>agreement with him was safe” but broadening and deepening it would be difficult and </p>
<p>would need to be dealt with via a third party (his lawyer) for the time being.</p>
<p><b>502. </b> The officials also met JAM1’s lawyer separately on 11 October, who reiterated his </p>
<p>request for JAM1 to be released. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> In an email reporting the meeting, officials reported surprise at the extent to which </p>
<p>the Secret Cells had acquiesced in the cease-fire and commented:</p>
<p>“But this good news presents us with more thinking to do. Specifically: is it </p>
<p>appropriate that we ask [JAM1] to police Basra not just through policing of his own </p>
<p>ranks but also those of other organisations? Does this, perhaps, leads [sic] us too </p>
<p>quickly down the uncertain road of vigilantism?” </p>
<p><b>504. </b> In the weekly update for Mr Brown on 12 October, a Cabinet Office official reported </p>
<p>that his statement had “played well in Baghdad and coalition capitals, especially in </p>
<p>Washington where the Administration was pleased at the prior levels of co-ordination </p>
<p>which had taken place, as well as the content of the statement itself”.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>505. </b> Although Gen Petraeus had welcomed the statement, he had been “quick to query </p>
<p>the UK’s longer term intentions in Iraq, for 2009 and beyond”, making it likely that US-UK </p>
<p>planning discussions would now shift to that timeframe. </p>
<p><b>506. </b> The Cabinet Office official told Mr Brown that the security situation in Basra </p>
<p>remained “relatively calm”. Governor Waili’s appeal against his dismissal from post had </p>
<p>been successful, and the UK planned to “resume low-key co-operation with him in the </p>
<p>interests of moving beyond the political stand-off in Basra” whilst the Iraq Government </p>
<p>took other steps towards his dismissal. </p>
<p><b>507. </b> An MOD official provided advice to Mr Browne on 12 October, seeking his </p>

<p>asked. We will seek proactively to promote the fairly successful MNF efforts to </p>
<p>facilitate Iraqi reconciliation in other parts of the country. We will also provide some </p>

<p>achieve greater political accommodation in the South.”</p>
<p><b>510. </b> The advice also asked for Mr Browne’s agreement on proposed lines to take. </p>
<p>In answer to the question “are you negotiating with JAM?”, the suggested reply was:</p>
<p>“Yes – we talk to JAM and other militia groups in our area of operations as part </p>
<p>of the strategy of political engagement and reconciliation we and our coalition </p>
<p>partners have long pursued – JAM and similar groups clearly have an interest in </p>
<p>and an influence over Basra and the rest of Iraq, and an outright refusal to engage </p>
<p>in dialogue with them would not be in Iraq’s, or Basra’s, best interests. Moreover </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government and the US are aware of, and support, these discussions, </p>
<p>which form part of the wider reconciliation initiatives being pursued through Iraq. </p>
<p>And through the newly-appointed Iraqi Commander of the Basra Operations Centre </p>
<p>(BOC), General Mohan, the Iraqis are also engaging with JAM and other groups with </p>
<p>a view to reducing the violence perpetrated against MNF and Iraqi civilians. We and </p>
<p>the Iraqis will engage with any groups who are interested in joining Iraq’s democratic </p>
<p>process and reducing violence – it is the right thing to do. We fully support General </p>
<p>Mohan in these efforts …”</p>
<p><b>511. </b> In response to the question<b> </b>“Has the violence decreased in Basra since you began </p>
<p>talking to these groups?”, the suggested reply was:</p>
<p>“Talking to these groups is nothing new and so we wouldn’t expect to see a sudden </p>
<p>decrease in violence. The security situation in Basra remains stable with only a very </p>
<p>small proportion of attacks in Iraq happening there. Indeed much of the violence </p>
<p>in Basra was directed at the MNF and this has decreased recently. Where security </p>
<p>incidents have occurred, the Iraqi security forces have demonstrated their ability to </p>
<p>deal with them.”</p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Browne marked the submission “noted and agreed” on 13 October. </p>
<p><b>513. </b> Maj Gen Rose advised the Chiefs of Staff on 16 October that a number of splinter </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>514. </b> One group, Fayha al-Sadr, focused on Basra and Dhi Qar provinces, was thought </p>

<p>created a “more permissive environment”.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that work to determine the future UK force structure </p>
<p>requirements for MND(SE) beyond March 2008 was being conducted, using a figure of </p>
<p>3,000 personnel as the planning baseline. It would be important to bear in mind the size </p>
<p>and nature of the UK’s commitment in Baghdad, particularly the senior officers based </p>
<p>there, as part of that work.</p>
<p><b>516. </b> Government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 on 16 October.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> </p>
<p>During the meeting, the compound was hit by indirect fire, which JAM1 described as “the </p>
<p>work of wreckers”. The officials said that the attack and JAM1’s reaction to it had helped </p>
<p>them to get the point across to MND(SE) that not all indirect fire was a contravention of </p>
<p>the agreement reached. </p>
<p><b>517. </b> The officials raised the prospect of political engagement, explaining that the UK </p>
<p>was working with all the Basra parties to achieve political rapprochement and prepare for </p>
<p>next year’s elections – except the Sadrists: “It was difficult for us to defend the Sadrists’ </p>
<p>rightful place at the political table if they declined to work with other political entities to </p>
<p>prepare the meal.” JAM1 explained that Muqtada al-Sadr was clear that foreign troops </p>
<p>were “occupiers” and should not be dealt with:</p>
<p>“But this straight bat stuff out of the way, a more nuanced and positive picture </p>
<p>emerged: there might actually be two OMS-affiliated parties standing, one of which </p>
<p>was ‘pure’ OMS and the other more prepared to broker with minor parties. And OMS </p>
<p>was preparing … a group of leaders in Basra who would deal with other parties and, </p>
<p>under the table, with MNF…”</p>
<p><b>518. </b> The note continued:</p>
<p>“Furthermore, an interlocutor … would be coming down to Basra from Baghdad … </p>
<p>and would visit [JAM1] in the DIF [Divisional Internment Facility]. This was a senior </p>
<p>man, not of the OMS but a Sadrist, who would be seeking to broker a much wider </p>
<p>deal which would embrace all the Sadrists on one side and all of MNF on the </p>
<p>other … To that end [JAM1] had already sent us a list of ten Basrawis in American </p>
<p>custody whose release would endorse British credentials as the potential deal-</p>
<p>makers for all of Iraq … JAM1 noted that Basrawis still feared that the Americans </p>
<p>would, sooner or later, occupy Basra. This would be a disaster, the end of all things. </p>
<p>But Sadrists now recognised that the Americans were not beyond negotiation and </p>
<p>believed that we offered the most trustworthy point of contact.”</p>

<p>247</p>
<p> Although the </p>

<p>in December.</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Dr Zebari told Mr Prentice on 18 October that the Iraqi Government would be </p>

<p>Government and the coalition on a long-term strategic security partnership.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>521. </b> The US and Iraqi Governments would issue a joint declaration in the next few </p>

<p>be shown the text in advance and that “US/GoI positions on the declaration and on the </p>

<p>JAM1 accepted. The officials said that any such meeting would be useful at present, as </p>
<p>there was still too much violence in Basra.</p>
<p><b>527. </b> On releases, JAM1 said that his new plan was that five prisoners should be </p>
<p>released on 10 November, with a steady stream of releases for the next two months. </p>
<p>JAM1 asked that his own release should form part of the 10 November batch. </p>
<p><b>528. </b> The officials concluded: </p>
<p>“… [JAM1]’s assurance that hostilities are not about to resume … and [JAM1]’s </p>
<p>claim that the Secret Cells are signed up (we have some scanty collateral for that) </p>
<p>are all positives although all such assurances should be treated with circumspection </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>“But [JAM1]’s request for his own release will be hard to play. He has proved </p>
<p>relentless on releases to date and we sense that, however much we seek to draw </p>
<p>it into the light, JAM’s feral instincts also remain fixed on the subject. It may be that, </p>
<p>at heart, [JAM1] still fears transfer to American custody … But whilst we might score </p>
<p>negotiating points and perhaps even achieve concessions down the road we should </p>
<p>be in no doubt that both [JAM1] and his JAM supporters will take this one to the </p>
<p>wire. We sense that they, particularly [JAM1] have more to lose than we now. But </p>
<p>they might not think so and the next set of negotiations will be hard.”</p>
<p><b>529. </b> On 23 October, Mr Browne told the House of Commons Select Committee on </p>
<p>Defence that:</p>
<p>“The security situation in Basra, in our assessment and in the assessment of the </p>
<p>Iraqis themselves who are of course important assessors of this, is that it remains </p>
<p>stable … Attacks on Multi-National Forces decreased by 90 percent in September </p>
<p>and the overall figure is 19 compared to August when it was 190 … The other aspect </p>
<p>of course of violence is crime against Iraqis themselves … it has remained at similar </p>
<p>levels to those seen in August prior to the handover of Basra Palace.”</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>530. </b> On 23 October, AM Peach briefed the Chiefs of Staff that tension between the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government and the MNF-I had increased.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> Among the contributing factors were an </p>
<p>incident on 16 September in which a private military security company had its operating </p>
<p>licence revoked after being accused of excessive force in a convoy protection incident, </p>
<p>a number of Iraqi civilian deaths in Sadr City on 21 October caused by the MNF-I, </p>
<p>increased use of airstrikes and a belief that the MNF-I had been arming the Sunni bloc. </p>
<p>In his view, these tensions might lead to changes to the draft resolution, and so delay it. </p>
<p><b>531. </b> The Chiefs of Staff observed that “legal advice would be required to establish </p>
<p>the status of UK forces should the current UNSCR lapse without replacement by </p>
<p>31 December 2007”.</p>

<p>281</p>
<p><b>532. </b> AM Peach also told the Chiefs of Staff: “Contrary to recent US assessments that </p>
<p>AQ-I had been defeated, the UK view remained that AQ-I, whilst severely damaged, </p>
<p>retained the ability to be resurgent, particularly if the current pressure were to be </p>
<p>released.” </p>
<p><b>533. </b> In a message to the FCO on 23 October, Mr Prentice urged that it should “start </p>
<p>planning how the UK will meet these commitments [in Mr Brown’s 8 October statement] </p>
<p>and best protect our wider strategic interests in the medium term – from the end of 2008 </p>
<p>and beyond”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> The urgency arose from the ongoing debate between Iraq and the US </p>
<p>on the legal basis for a continued coalition presence in 2009 and beyond. </p>
<p><b>534. </b> The Iraqi Government was insisting that there could be no extension of a </p>
<p>Chapter VII resolution into 2009. Even renewal of the existing resolution for another </p>
<p>year looked set to be “a struggle”. To secure what was needed from that continuing </p>
<p>debate, Mr Prentice argued that the UK would need “to clarify now what role we </p>
<p>see ourselves playing in Iraq beyond 2008 and what legal authorities we will require </p>
<p>to enable us to do that”.</p>
<p><b>535. </b> Mr Prentice continued:</p>
<p>“… to ensure that we do justice to the scale and cost of the UK’s commitment to the </p>
<p>Iraq project over the last 4-5 years and secure our national interests for the period </p>
<p>ahead, we need to accept now that we are in this for some years to come”. </p>
<p><b>536. </b> Mr Prentice thought the UK role in Iraq in 2009 and beyond ought to include:</p>

<p>capacity-building in the judiciary and police at the centre;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training and mentoring of the Basra ISF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the Basra development initiatives because: “We will be judged by </p>
<p>the progress Basra makes following PIC … There is also a case for us to be </p>
<p>planning a last high profile project as visible proof for Basrawis of our continuing </p>
<p>support and as a lasting UK legacy”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-establishing a UK Trade and Industry presence in Basra “to pursue the huge </p>
<p>commercial opportunities there will eventually be there”;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>“We need an approach that is ambitious in its vision, but remains flexible in its </p>
<p>implementation:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must continue to remain engaged on the ground, both militarily and in a </p>
<p>civilian capacity in Baghdad, Basra and Erbil.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Even as that engagement shifts from being primarily military … the security </p>
<p>situation will still require us to provide protection to those engaged in our </p>
<p>civilian efforts.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must not underestimate the scale of the task of helping to rebuild Iraq, </p>
<p>nor the time it will take to achieve conditions when we can revert to a normal </p>
<p>relationship with Iraq …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Our effort will need to continue to draw on the contributions of a wide range </p>
<p>of government departments – including, but not only, FCO, DFID, MOD </p>

<p>“Given our best assessment of the prospects for security and our operating </p>

<p><b>538. </b> On 24 October, a splinter group – the Iraq National Gathering (ING) – announced </p>
<p>that it was breaking away from the main Sadrist movement.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> Maj Gen Binns reported </p>
<p>that the announcement led to a “flurry of speculation that this may be the ‘next big </p>
<p>thing’” because its leadership appeared to involve individuals closely associated </p>

<p><b>541. </b> The negotiating plan said that it should be borne in mind that the ISF were not yet </p>
<p>in a fit state to take on JAM. It considered that the UK wished to avoid: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A resumption of the IDF/IED campaign that would send our policy in southern </p>
<p>Iraq back to the unhealthy state it was in last May/June.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Conflict between JAM and the ISF in Basra, particularly if it reaches the level </p>
<p>where it demands our re-intervention”.</p>
<p><b>542. </b> The plan went on to suggest that the UK’s position should be that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the increased tempo of demands had put “all in doubt”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>if the negotiation process broke down and attacks resumed, the UK would </p>
<p>reinforce a “vigorous ISF campaign” against illegal activity by JAM and releases </p>
<p>would cease;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the release of JAM1 should mark the formal end of “all hostilities” in Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the agreements needed to underpin the end of hostilities should be in place by </p>
<p>mid-January. </p>
<p><b>543. </b> Those agreements should be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a demonstration of intent – a period of 20 days in which there were no kidnaps </p>
<p>or crimes or attacks in Basra by JAM;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a public declaration that JAM would subscribe to the rule of law and cease all </p>
<p>military operations against the MNF and the ISF in Basra province and that OMS </p>
<p>will look only to the political route;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a public declaration that JAM would cease all attacks upon, or intimidation of, </p>
<p>current and former Iraqi employees and contractors of MNF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the delivery of all mortar tubes, rounds and rockets, illegally held in Basra, to </p>
<p>MNF or ISF; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a public commitment to free and fair provincial elections in Basra province.</p>
<p><b>544. </b> On 26 October, government officials working closely with the military met JAM1 </p>
<p>once again and put to him, as agreed by the RSG, that his own release should not take </p>
<p>place until the structures were in place to ensure that hostilities could not break out </p>
<p>again. The officials told JAM1 that some concrete proposals were being prepared for </p>
<p>discussion. JAM1 was reported to have reacted calmly. The officials concluded:</p>
<p>“This went better than we might have expected … This may simply because [sic] we </p>
<p>did not, at this stage, say: ‘you are not being released on 10 November’. Equally he </p>
<p>did not react poorly to our lines about agreements and declarations because he had </p>
<p>yet to see how draconian and, in their original form, unpalatable, they might be.”</p>
<p><b>545. </b> At a subsequent meeting with JAM1 on 30 October, government officials working </p>
<p>closely with the military put forward the list of agreements needed to signal an end to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>hostilities, as agreed by the RSG.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> JAM1 responded that it would take time to find </p>
<p>a real solution on handing in heavy weaponry and the protection of the MNF’s Iraqi </p>
<p>employees, who were widely considered to be British spies. </p>
<p><b>546. </b> JAM1 requested that a translation of the proposals be provided to his lawyer as </p>
<p>a representative of the OMS, the ultimate signatory of any agreement. In their report to </p>
<p>London, the officials concluded that “even genuinely determined attempts to engage </p>
<p>with the OMS … could take us up to mid-January and beyond. This would definitely </p>
<p>not wash.”</p>
<p><b>547. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Iraq between 26 and 29 October.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> Reporting the visit </p>
<p>to Mr Browne’s Private Secretary, ACM Stirrup’s Military Adviser recorded that </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns remained confident of achieving PIC in Basra in December 2007, </p>
<p>although he was doubtful that the ISF had the ability to counter JAM if the cease-fire </p>
<p>broke. </p>
<p><b>548. </b> ACM Stirrup confirmed that the desired end state was “an enduring security which </p>
<p>facilitates a political climate suitable for development”. The ongoing JAM reconciliation </p>
<p>process and the continued strengthening of the Iraqi Army and the police were all </p>
<p>encouraging but: “the biggest lever for JAM to continue reconciliation was the fear of US </p>
<p>intervention in Basra, if conditions deteriorated”. </p>
<p><b>549. </b> Lt Gen Odierno told ACM Stirrup that he had initially been wary about the UK’s </p>
<p>proposed withdrawal from Basra Palace but that his fears had been unfounded. He was </p>
<p>“more than comfortable” with the prospect of PIC in Basra in December.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Mr Brown and President Bush spoke by video conference on 29 October. In a short </p>
<p>discussion on Iraq, Mr Brown regretted that there had not been further Iraqi progress on </p>
<p>reconciliation.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> He explained that the UK was focused on consolidating the security and </p>
<p>economic situation in the south, and emphasised the importance of securing provincial </p>
<p>elections to promote a “solid democratic message”. </p>
<p><b>551. </b> Sir John Sawers, UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, wrote to </p>
<p>Sir Peter Ricketts, FCO Permanent Under Secretary, at the end of October to express </p>
<p>his concerns about the approach to the new resolution.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> Sir John understood that the </p>
<p>intention was that the new resolution would contain a formal commitment that it would </p>
<p>be the last and that the future presence of the MNF would be governed by one or more </p>

<p>Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs). Sir John outlined four potential risks to UK </p>
<p>interests in doing so:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Building in an implicit acceptance of a long-term US presence in Iraq would </p>
<p>complicate the rollover of the UN mandate for 2008.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK options for a military presence post-2008 would be limited and dependent </p>
<p>on negotiating a SOFA with the Iraqi Government. If that could not be achieved </p>
<p>“the absence of such an agreement could prove to be the basis on which our </p>
<p>presence in Iraq is terminated … it would be hard to argue that our decision was </p>
<p>based on prevailing security conditions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The nature of the international presence in Iraq would change, narrowing the </p>
<p>coalition and setting back the efforts the UK had made to “internationalise” the </p>
<p>effort in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK arguments that a Chapter VII mandate was required for similar operations </p>
<p>(for example, in Darfur) would be weakened.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Sir John concluded his letter by asking that Mr Miliband be made aware of these </p>
<p>risks. He wrote:</p>
<p>“I accept fully that there are other factors at play. Purely in terms of UN handling </p>
<p>and sustaining the UN’s role in Iraq, I would prefer us to keep open the prospect </p>
<p>of further renewals of the UN mandate and to stick as far as we can to last year’s </p>
<p>US-Iraq exchange of letters.”</p>
<p><b>553. </b> On 31 October, a government official working closely with the UK military briefed </p>
<p>the US military on the negotiations with JAM1 and explored the possibility of Basrawi </p>
<p>detainees in US custody being transferred to MND(SE)’s detention facility “to bolster our </p>
<p>dwindling numbers in an effort to prolong the detainee release programme”.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>554. </b> Around 300 detainees in US custody were thought to be of interest to the UK. With </p>
<p>the exception of “A Category insurgents” they could be released when needed. The </p>
<p>official noted that there were legal issues to be discussed regarding any transfer to UK </p>
<p>detention. US and UK military officers would discuss the practicalities.</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq between 29 October and 2 November.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> In a letter reporting </p>
<p>his observations to Mr Brown he described it as “markedly the most encouraging of my </p>
<p>seven visits to Basra”. He continued:</p>
<p>“So progress there has been, but, as you well know, the space we have achieved </p>
<p>is fragile and temporary. We have a window of opportunity in Basra and it is vital </p>
<p>that both we and the Iraqis apply political and economic leadership to make the </p>
<p>most of it.” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Mr Browne had impressed upon everyone he met in Iraq the need to announce </p>
<p>“a detailed economic plan for Basra” to coincide with PIC in December. He observed that </p>
<p>“If we are to deliver, and we must, this will need dedicated and energetic UK resource in </p>
<p>London, Basra and Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>557. </b> During his stay in Baghdad, Mr Browne reported that Gen Petraeus described </p>
<p>progress on reconciling the disaffected as “quite extraordinary”. He considered that: </p>
<p>“The phenomenon that began amongst the Sunni in the Al Anbar but which is now </p>
<p>reaching out to the Shia too, is now of sufficient magnitude that the Government of Iraq </p>
<p>has no choice but to embrace it.”</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Mr Browne raised the UK’s concerns about the renewal of resolution 1723 with </p>
<p>both Prime Minister Maliki and Gen Petraeus. The latter’s view was that the strategic </p>
<p>context had now changed and that in order to secure its passage Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>would have to be able to tell the Council of Representatives that it would be the final </p>
<p>resolution. Mr Browne “left him in little doubt about the legal constraint that the UK would </p>
<p>face in the absence of the UNSCR”.</p>
<p><b>559. </b> On 31 October, at the MOD’s request, the JIC examined the sustainability of </p>
<p>the recent down-turn in JAM attacks on MNF-I in Basra.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> It assessed that a range </p>
<p>of factors – including the withdrawal from the city centre, a number of development </p>
<p>initiatives coming on stream, Gen Mohan and Gen Jalil’s efforts to improve ISF </p>
<p>performance in the city – had “created an environment in which the evolving negotiation </p>
<p>between MND(SE) and [JAM1] was able to progress to a formal cease-fire agreement in </p>
<p>early August, which is still being observed”. </p>
<p><b>560. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“The agreement with [JAM1] is fragile. It has hitherto focused on linking a reduction </p>
<p>in attacks on MNF to prisoner releases. Pressure for a more broadly-based </p>
<p>negotiation including economic and political elements is likely to grow rapidly …”</p>
<p><b>561. </b> The JIC assessed that the reduction in violence that had been negotiated with </p>
<p>JAM1 could be upset “by a number of players with potentially conflicting interests”. </p>
<p>The JIC considered that:</p>
<p>“… the fractious nature of the Sadrist movement means we see a high risk that … </p>
<p>[the] initiative could become a pawn of infighting in Najaf.</p>
<p>“The attitude of <b>Muqtada al-Sadr</b> is important, in public he had made a point of </p>
<p>consistently opposing any contacts with ‘occupation forces’ and the Najaf leadership </p>
<p>would be unlikely to challenge an order from him …”</p>
<p><b>562. </b> The JIC judged that al-Sadr was trying to move his movement towards a more </p>
<p>conventional role in Iraqi politics and might therefore see advantage in “an initiative </p>
<p>263 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 31 October 2007, ‘Iraq: Risks to the Negotiation with JAM in Basra’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>287</p>
<p>which positions them more strongly is Basra”. However, “al-Sadr is notoriously volatile </p>
<p>and it would be unwise to count on his indefinite support for any deal”. </p>
<p><b>563. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Maliki is briefed on MND(SE)’s negotiation with [JAM1] and has </p>
<p>raised no objection. Maliki places a high premium on stability in Basra. However, </p>
<p>he probably has reservations about any deals with JAM and there is a risk that </p>
<p>he could miscalculate: an order for ISF to confront JAM directly in Basra could upset </p>
<p>the negotiation.” </p>
<p><b>564. </b> Under the heading “Prospects”, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“The attitude of the Sadrist leadership … is also likely to be coloured by their </p>
<p>perception of the prospects for some lasting political gain, at least until provincial </p>
<p>elections take place next year. But we judge that JAM views locally and nationally </p>
<p>are also likely to be coloured by their perception of MNF intentions in the longer </p>
<p>term … If JAM conclude that momentum towards complete withdrawal has stalled, </p>
<p>we judge they might well resume such attacks. They would almost certainly have </p>
<p>Iranian support in doing so.”</p>
<p><b>November 2007</b></p>
<p><b>565. </b> Mr Browne’s visit to Basra prompted Maj Gen Binns to evaluate progress made </p>
<p>since the summer.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> On 1 November he wrote:</p>
<p>“We are now subject to far fewer attacks, are constructively engaged with the </p>
<p>Governor … and the Provincial Council, we transit through Basra in force … without </p>
<p>opposition (although there is always a quantifiable threat) and are looking to make </p>
<p>more of the large amount of reconstruction work we are responsible for (through US </p>
<p>resources) in Basra … We are still subject to attack (and the danger is significant), </p>
<p>but these attacks are, we believe, from rogue elements (possibly sponsored by Iran). </p>
<p>The mainstream militias are for the most part quiet – unless provoked, as we saw </p>
<p>on 23 October.</p>
<p>“Discussions are taking place in Basra, without our involvement, between political </p>
<p>parties and JAM. We are also encouraging constructive engagement between the </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces and the Provincial Council. I am in no doubt that encouraging, </p>
<p>cajoling and supporting the various parties in Basra towards a peaceful resolution </p>
<p>to their differences will lay the foundations for Basra’s future prosperity and success </p>
<p>for the MND(SE) mission … But we should be in no doubt that this progress is </p>
<p>not yet irreversible and, should there be any backsliding by local parties, we must </p>
<p>hold our nerve as the groundswell of Iraqi opinion is moving towards reconciliation </p>

<p>in order to achieve peace and prosperity. The result will not be pretty, and will no </p>
<p>doubt have distasteful people in power … but to be sustainable the solution must </p>
<p>be an Iraqi one.”</p>
<p><b>566. </b> In his weekly report of 4 November, Lt Gen Rollo agreed that “concrete action” </p>
<p>would be necessary to make good on the commitments to accelerate economic </p>
<p>development in Basra.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> The work would require “dedicated cells in London </p>
<p>and Basra with clear accountability and an aggressive timeline” in order to be able </p>
<p>“to clout not dribble”. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented that Mr Browne’s visit had prompted useful US debate </p>
<p>about the UK’s requirement for a Security Council resolution because:</p>
<p>“The effect of the lack of UNSCR cover for our operations had not been fully </p>
<p>appreciated here, although it had been discussed in Washington.” </p>
<p><b>568. </b> When the Iraq Strategy Group discussed renewal of the resolution on 5 November, </p>
<p>the FCO position was described by Mr Baker as “to keep options open for 2009 in case </p>
<p>a further resolution were required.”</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> Mr McDonald told the Iraq Strategy Group that:</p>
<p>“… the Prime Minister was content that the next SCR would be the last, and given </p>
<p>our stated plan for next year, it would send the wrong message if we appeared to </p>
<p>be pushing far more than the US to keep our options open. If the US did not agree </p>
<p>to our latest suggested amendments therefore, we should accept that as the last </p>
<p>word. We should ensure, however, that all parts of the US system were aware of the </p>
<p>consequences for the UK commitment of not having a SCR mandate.”</p>
<p><b>569. </b> Mr McDonald also told the Iraq Strategy Group that there would be a review of </p>
<p>the UK’s civilian and military posture in Iraq in spring 2008, when Ministers might take </p>
<p>decisions on future plans for 2009 and beyond. He cautioned that it was too early to </p>
<p>make assumptions about what the future posture might be, and that it should not be </p>
<p>discussed with the US or Iraqis, but the long-term objective was “strategic overwatch </p>
<p>in Iraq”. Papers were commissioned from the FCO and MOD for discussion by the Iraq </p>
<p>Strategy Group, and eventually for Ministers’ Christmas red boxes.</p>
<p><b>570. </b> On 5 November, in an account of a further meeting with JAM1, a government </p>
<p>official working closely with the military recorded that a formal request for releases from </p>
<p>US detention was with Lt Gen Odierno for consideration.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p><b>571. </b> In the meeting itself, JAM1 had not, as expected, pushed for himself to be one of </p>
<p>those released on 10 November but officials had been prompted to consider whether it </p>

<p>In particular, the official wondered, “how will it look presentationally if we keep him </p>
<p>past PIC?” </p>
<p><b>572. </b> Mr Day wrote to Lt Gen Wall on 5 November with an account of discussions </p>
<p>between Maj Gen Binns and Mr Browne on JAM1 during Mr Browne’s visit to Basra.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Day suggested that the key points were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent to which a long term deal is embedded in – and, indeed, fundamental </p>
<p>to – thinking in theatre on political engagement and shifting the gunmen into </p>
<p>politics;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>[officials’] caution about the prospects for success;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the fragility of our hold on [JAM1] after his release – the levers listed in previous </p>
<p>draft papers are in my view inadequate to constrain him once out of our hands.”</p>
<p><b>573. </b> Mr Day considered that it was important to recognise that: </p>
<p>“… negotiating a long term relationship with [JAM1] is tantamount to taking a punt at </p>
<p>long odds. But the alternatives may well be even less attractive. Having discussed </p>
<p>the pros and cons with SofS and Graham Binns, I think the key questions on which </p>
<p>we need to provide advice are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What are the legal implications/commitment of the kind of political and </p>
<p>economic ‘deals’ we are considering – in particular on providing intelligence </p>
<p>to [JAM1] and transferring internees from US custody?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How do we engage the key Iraqi players (presumably Maliki, Mohan and </p>
<p>Jalil) and do they have a say or a veto?”</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Mr Day concluded:</p>
<p>“This is essentially a political judgement call so we need to expose all of the factors </p>
<p>for SofS. In the shorter term, I have confirmed with SofS’s office that they have no </p>
<p>record of SofS agreeing that theatre can release further internees without consulting </p>
<p>MOD. That was certainly my understanding, at least as until we have a long term </p>
<p>policy in place.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>577. </b> One of the accounts reported the purpose of the meeting as looking at the </p>
<p>prospects for developing the negotiations from a tactical deal into a process that </p>
<p>delivered strategic effect in MND(SE) and perhaps beyond.</p>
<p><b>578. </b> One of the attendees reported internally on broad agreement that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should aim to preserve the reduction in violence for as long as possible, </p>
<p>because even after PIC a return to violence would make sustaining UK presence </p>
<p>in MND(SE) difficult.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The cease-fire would probably not survive JAM1’s release as part of the last </p>
<p>tranche of prisoners unless he had first been bound into a broader process.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be necessary to wrap the UK’s relationship with JAM1 into a broader </p>
<p>process so as to avoid the political risks of directly backing a JAM leader.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were potentially strategic gains to be made from such a process, including </p>
<p>countering malign Iranian influence and bringing the Sadrists and JAM more fully </p>
<p>within Iraqi politics.</p>
<p><b>579. </b> The attendee’s account said that the FCO had agreed to take responsibility for </p>
<p>developing a strategic plan, while the MOD would take forward the “tactical deal”. DFID </p>
<p>protested against short-term development projects initiated as part of the agreements </p>
<p>reached, which could undermine structural reforms agreed with the Provincial </p>
<p>Council. It was agreed unanimously that no reporting on cease-fire violators would be </p>
<p>passed to JAM1. </p>
<p><b>580. </b> Mr Day wrote to Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary on 7 November with an </p>
<p>account of agreements reached at the meeting on the previous day.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> He said that the </p>
<p>discussion had “resolved most of the outstanding issues” on longer-term aims and the </p>
<p>negotiating strategy. He reported that it had been agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the current process of negotiation should continue with the aim of minimising </p>
<p>the IDF threat to the COB and “stringing out the deal for as long as possible” </p>
<p>into 2008;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>subject to any legal constraints, the UK should be prepared to act as a conduit </p>
<p>for the releases of internees in US hands, if the US agreed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Browne should continue to approve the release of detainees, up to but not </p>
<p>including JAM1. </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Mr Day wrote that it had been agreed that the FCO would lead on developing a </p>
<p>strategy for wider political engagement in Basra, taking into account US and Iraqi views, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>586. </b> The report concluded with a “note of warning” which indicated that they were </p>
<p>unclear about the extent to which JAM1 was aware of the activities of JAM death </p>
<p>squads, which were believed to be assassinating their enemies. </p>
<p><b>587. </b> On 9 November, a senior official specialising in the Middle East (1) provided </p>
<p>Mr Lyall Grant with advice on negotiations with JAM in Basra, intended to provide </p>
<p>background for policy makers as they considered “the advantages and risks of moving </p>
<p>ahead”.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> The advice was copied to Mr McDonald, as well as others in the MOD, the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office and the FCO. </p>
<p><b>588. </b> The advice opened by stating that negotiations with JAM in Basra had led to “a </p>
<p>striking reduction in violence” and that there was an opportunity to “transform a tactical </p>
<p>deal based on detainee releases into a process designed to achieve a strategic shift </p>
<p>in JAM’s relationship with MND(SE) and possibly with the US and the Government of </p>
<p>Iraq”. The senior official anticipated that this would be the subject of an FCO submission. </p>
<p>There was “some urgency” to this as by the end of the year MND(SE) would have run </p>
<p>out of significant detainees to release, meaning that the current arrangements could </p>
<p>collapse, unless “developed into a wider longer term dispensation”. </p>
<p><b>589. </b> The advice explained the background to the “initiative” in Basra and its impact </p>
<p>to date. Around 50 detainees had been released already, with 31 still in detention. </p>
<p>If releases continued at the same rate, all detainees were likely to have been released </p>
<p>by the middle of January 2008. </p>
<p><b>590. </b> The senior official advised that: </p>
<p>“The best date for [JAM1’s] release will depend on exactly how the … process </p>
<p>develops but Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC) and Eid al-Adha on or around </p>
<p>20 December represent symbolic milestones. Fixing a date now for [JAM1’s] release </p>
<p>might take the sting out of further demands for immediate release and focus minds </p>
<p>on all sides on how to sustain the process.</p>
<p>“[JAM1] has said he does not want all the detainees released immediately to allow </p>
<p>time for the transformation of the relationship with the UK. Nonetheless, despite his </p>
<p>strong interest in development and politics, his roots in militia violence are never </p>
<p>far from the surface and he is very responsive to pressure from JAM in Basra for a </p>
<p>quicker pace of releases. Although the atmospherics of the talks are generally good, </p>
<p>he remains at times a difficult and unpredictable interlocutor. He wants the cease-fire </p>
<p>to work but his instincts are to discipline his own people … He particularly distrusts </p>
<p>Basra security supremo, General Mohan … Getting him to work with Mohan or a </p>
<p>replacement will be difficult but … [reports suggest] that [JAM1] is beginning to </p>
<p>recognise the necessity of security co-ordination with the Iraqi state.”</p>

<p><b>591. </b> On the attitudes of others to the negotiations, the senior official reported:</p>
<p>“Mohan’s own attitude to JAM remains ambivalent. He talks of tough steps if JAM </p>
<p>does not comply with his demands but he has also been keen to associate himself </p>
<p>with the [NAME OF OPERATION] detainee releases. Some around PM Maliki seem </p>
<p>to fear the UK might empower or even arm JAM, drawing parallels with US actions </p>
<p>with Sunnis in al-Anbar …</p>
<p>“Although there was considerable US suspicion of the [NAME OF OPERATION] </p>
<p>process as a means to UK drawdown, there is strong US interest in the progress of </p>
<p>the talks and especially the impact on Iran.” </p>
<p><b>592. </b> On 9 November, Mr McDonald sent a minute to Mr Brown on the renewal of the </p>
<p>Security Council resolution describing the MNF mandate in Iraq.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> He reported that </p>
<p>Mr Miliband had decided, on advice from the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New </p>
<p>York, that the UK should propose new language for the US draft making clear that a </p>
<p>decision on a resolution for 2009 should be conditions-based. It was expected that the </p>
<p>US would reject that language. Mr McDonald continued:</p>
<p>“… we should not be seen to be leading the demands for a post-2008 resolution, </p>
<p>as this may send the wrong message about the level of our likely commitment in </p>
<p>Iraq from 2009 and beyond. I have therefore agreed in Whitehall that if the US does </p>
<p>indeed reject our proposal we will accept their position. </p>
<p>“It is a fact, though, that the absence of a UNSCR will have greater implications for </p>
<p>the level and scope of the UK commitment than it will for the US, given our obligation </p>
<p>to comply with the European Convention on Human Rights. The US are aware of </p>
<p>this … Petraeus recognised that the absence of a UNSCR … would significantly </p>
<p>constrain our freedoms and may prejudice the tasks he wants us to perform … </p>
<p>Nevertheless, his view was that the strategic context had changed and that, to </p>
<p>secure the passage of the next resolution, Maliki would need to present it internally </p>
<p>as the last.”</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Mr McDonald recommended that the UK should accept that the next resolution </p>
<p>would be the last and should start to look at what would be necessary to replace it </p>
<p>in 2009, which was likely to be some form of Status of Forces Agreement.</p>
<p><b>594. </b> In his 11 November weekly report, Lt Gen Rollo reported that a group of mid- to </p>
<p>senior-level Sadrists – the Mid Euphrates Awakening – had made contact with the </p>

<p>western Baghdad.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>engagement with the Sadrist movement in recent weeks. He observed that, together, </p>
<p>these initiatives represented an opportunity for the Iraqi Government (if not directly for </p>
<p>the MNF). </p>
<p><b>596. </b> The impact on the UK was likely to be “increased Iraqi and coalition interest in our </p>
<p>engagement with JAM in Basra, which will need a degree of careful management”. In </p>
<p>particular, the US and Iraqi desire to regain control of the port from JAM would “need to </p>
<p>be thought through in the context of wider political and security relationships” there.</p>
<p><b>597. </b> On 13 November, Lt Gen Houghton briefed the Chiefs of Staff that the JAM cease-</p>
<p>fire in Basra continued, “largely as a result of engagement, political accommodation and </p>
<p>self-limiting violence”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> Nonetheless, five variables had been identified that could put it </p>
<p>at risk:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki’s continued pressure for General Mohan to act against </p>
<p>militants in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iranian sponsorship of militant activity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM special groups intent on breaking the Sadrist freeze on military activity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the formation of JAM splinter groups undermining mainstream JAM elements; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “exhaustion of current security accommodations in Basra”.</p>
<p><b>598. </b> It was reported on 14 November that Mr Alexander had suggested that Ministers </p>
<p>should be briefed orally on the negotiations with JAM1 and that Mr Brown had agreed.</p>

<p><b>602. </b> On 17 November, <i>The Guardian</i> reported a press conference by Maj Gen Binns in </p>
<p>Baghdad in which he:</p>
<p>“… confirmed … that UK officials have been holding talks with supporters of the </p>
<p>Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army in the hope they would be drawn into the </p>
<p>political process.”</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Maj Gen Binns was reported to have said that not everyone in the Mahdi Army </p>
<p>supported the talks, and that its main rival, the Badr brigade, was too weak to mount a </p>
<p>challenge. <i>The Guardian</i> reported that:</p>
<p>“British officials last night were keen to emphasise that the talks with the militia </p>
<p>were being held with the full support and, at times, participation of Major General </p>
<p>Abdul Jalil Khalaff and General Mohan … The talks have been accompanied by the </p>
<p>release, by British forces, of Mahdi Army fighters detained in connection with attacks </p>
<p>on British troops.”</p>
<p><b>604. </b> On 18 November, Lt Gen Rollo reported that if Governor Waili remained in </p>
<p>post, then the UK might be faced with “a difficult decision on whether to accept an </p>
<p>unsatisfactory solution on 17 December or to hold out for one which will really set the </p>
<p>conditions for next year”.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> The Iraqi Government’s solution was “for the Prime Minister </p>
<p>to accept the security file and delegate it to General Mohan”. The coalition view was </p>
<p>that this was “bad in law, bad politically at home, and bad in practice in Basra, where we </p>
<p>want a solid triumvirate, including the Governor, alongside the BOC Commander and </p>
<p>the Chief of Police.”</p>
<p><b>605. </b> Mr Prentice reported on 19 November that Dr Rubaie said that he had submitted a </p>
<p>“favourable” memo to Prime Minister Maliki on UK recommendations for the handling of </p>
<p>Basra PIC, but had yet to receive a response.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>606. </b> On 19 November, a junior official from the FCO Iraq Group provided advice to </p>

<p>of 6 November.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>607. </b> The issue discussed in the submission was described as “To maintain a dialogue </p>
<p>with … [JAM1] once all detainees have been released, to ensure the recent political </p>
<p>and security gains in Basra are expanded.” The preferred option was that Mr Miliband </p>
<p>agreed to broaden the scope of negotiations with JAM1 to include “the integration </p>
<p>of the Sadr-ists into Basra’s formal political process, including Sadrist participation in </p>
<p>provincial elections”. </p>

<p><b>608. </b> The junior FCO official also described an alternative option, which was “to </p>
<p>continue to limit the basis of our accommodation with JAM to detainee release”. </p>
<p>If this option was to be selected, it was unlikely that “calm” in Basra would be </p>
<p>sustained beyond the release of the last detainee.</p>
<p><b>609. </b> In contrast to advice provided to Mr Browne a few days earlier, the junior FCO </p>
<p>official proposed that discussions with JAM1 should be kept as low key as possible </p>
<p>because “media attention would likely portray these as a tacit acknowledgement of </p>
<p>defeat for the UK in southern Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>610. </b> The junior FCO official wrote that negotiations with JAM1 had always included </p>
<p>a political element, but that the “continuation and formalisation” of these talks was </p>
<p>intended to bind JAM1 and the Sadrists into political reconciliation before JAM1’s </p>
<p>release. The specific objectives of talks would be to secure commitments from JAM1 on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>free and fair elections in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for the Iraqi authorities to limit crime and violence in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ending hostilities; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ending attacks on MNF current or former employees; and </p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>611. </b> The junior FCO official recorded that Maj Gen Binns was recommending to </p>
<p>Mr Browne that JAM1 was released earlier than planned if “significant progress” </p>
<p>was made against these objectives. </p>
<p><b>612. </b> The greatest risk was a described as “a failure of an accommodation with </p>
<p>[JAM1]”, which was likely to mean a return to a high level of attacks against the MNF. </p>
<p>The main threats to the dialogue were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM1 concluding that he could better advance his political interests </p>
<p>through violence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM1 being killed after release; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM1 losing control of JAM in Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>JAM being drawn into large-scale fighting with the MNF.</p>
<p><b>613. </b> The junior FCO official also described the risk of negative reactions from the US </p>
<p>and from the Iraqi Government, and of losing traction with other parties in Basra by </p>
<p>expanding the scope of engagement with JAM. </p>

<p><b>615. </b> NSID(OD) met on 20 November to take stock of the situation in Basra.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Cabinet Office officials briefed Mr Brown, the Chair, that the main aim of the meeting </p>
<p>was “to ensure that the transfer to Iraqi control in Basra, scheduled for 17 December </p>
<p>is not delayed” and that the meeting would need to assess the security situation in </p>
<p>Basra and look at how to sustain the present reduction in violence, including through </p>
<p>possible political or economic measures. </p>
<p><b>616. </b> At the meeting, Mr Miliband reported that the security situation was “encouraging”, </p>
<p>putting the UK “on track” for the transfer to Iraqi control to take place, on schedule, </p>
<p>on 17 December.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p> Risk came from the uncertainty over Governor Waili’s position. </p>
<p>Mr Miliband reported that the inter-departmental work on contacts with local militias </p>
<p>had been good, but it would be important in future to ensure that negotiations with local </p>
<p>militia leaders did not favour any one person but were inclusive – the UK should support </p>
<p>the process, not an individual. </p>
<p><b>617. </b> Mr Alexander reported that Mr Michael Wareing, the International CEO of KPMG, </p>
<p>had agreed to help drive forward the work of the Basra Development Commission </p>
<p>(BDC). Several of the projects included within the BDC’s 2007 plan had been </p>
<p>requested by local militia leaders, which would help “lock them into the economic and </p>
<p>political process”. </p>
<p><b>618. </b> Mr Browne observed that, from a force protection perspective, it would be </p>
<p>important to keep local militia leaders engaged and bring them into the wider political </p>
<p>and economic process as much as possible. Sir John Scarlett agreed that it would be </p>
<p>important to find ways of broadening the dialogue to address a wider range of political </p>
<p>and economic issues. </p>
<p><b>619. </b> Summing up the meeting, Mr Brown said that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK should “press ahead” for the transfer of security responsibility to Iraqi </p>
<p>control on 17 December;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic projects should be agreed through proper discussion with local </p>
<p>representatives, rather than favouring any faction or individual, though that “did </p>
<p>not preclude using a coincidence of interest to draw local militia leaders into the </p>
<p>wider political process”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Alexander should write with plans for the launch of the BDC; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>298</p>
<p><b>620. </b> After the meeting (at which Mr Alexander’s request for a briefing on discussions </p>
<p>with JAM1 was to be answered), Sir John Scarlett’s Private Secretary produced a </p>
<p>summary of his account of the meeting.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>621. </b> According to the summary, Mr Miliband said that:</p>
<p>“… there was a need to send clear political instructions about the parameters within </p>
<p>which negotiations could be conducted, but he offered nothing concrete on FCO </p>
<p>action in relation to broadening the process”. </p>
<p><b>622. </b> Mr Alexander had expressed concerns about development projects agreed with </p>
<p>JAM1 drawing resources and expertise away from existing projects. There was general </p>
<p>support for resource decisions to be taken in theatre where conflicts arose between </p>
<p>priorities. </p>
<p><b>623. </b> The account recorded Sir John’s sense that:</p>
<p>“… there was a general consensus that [Mr Miliband] should approve the [NAME OF </p>
<p>OPERATION] submission and that MOD should press ahead with a mid-December </p>
<p>release date for [JAM1]. But the shortening of the meeting meant that there was not </p>
<p>time to agree a detailed plan of action.”</p>
<p>However, there had been “clear interest and support from the PM” which would help in </p>
<p>agreeing a detailed plan.</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Mr Brown “touched very briefly” on Iraq during a telephone conversation with </p>
<p>President Bush on 20 November.</p>

<p>its political and economic priorities in the South and still hoped to move to PIC in Basra </p>

<p> As agreed by the Reconciliation Steering Group, their objectives </p>

<p>weeks, subject to agreement that they no longer posed a serious threat. Approval was </p>

<p> Lt Gen Rollo wrote that, </p>
<p>while no-one discounted the hard work still required on the security line of operations, </p>
<p>the main debate focused on how to make more progress on politics and economics in a </p>
<p>way that would contain and gradually reduce the inter-communal tensions that continued </p>
<p>to dominate Iraq. </p>
<p><b>631. </b> There was a significant debate about anti-corruption and terrorist financing, </p>
<p>including the problems of militia infiltration and intimidation of the MOI and MOD. </p>
<p>This mattered not only because of the need to starve AQ and the Special Groups </p>
<p>of funds but because any dysfunctionality in those ministries undermined the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government more generally. Lt Gen Rollo reported that there had been unanimity that </p>
<p>economic development and employment were critical to the success of the next </p>
<p>stage of the campaign.</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Lt Gen Rollo also reported that the Supreme Court had found in favour of </p>

<p><b>633. </b> Mr Baker told the Iraq Strategy Group that it appeared the ruling would be </p>

<p>for PIC.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> The MCNS would take the final decision on 9 December. </p>
<p><b>634. </b> In relation to the renewal of resolution 1732, Mr Baker confirmed to the Iraq </p>
<p>Strategy Group that “the US were aware of the implications for us of this being the </p>
<p>last resolution”. </p>
<p><b>635. </b> Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary replied to MOD officials on 26 November </p>
<p>to record his agreement to the releases requested on 22 November, subject to it being </p>
<p>assessed that they no longer posed an “imperative threat” to security.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>636. </b> A senior government official specialising in the Middle East (2), accompanied by </p>
<p>colleagues, met JAM1 again on 27 November.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> The purpose of the meeting was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to show JAM1 a draft of a possible Basra Agreement/Declaration that would </p>
<p>precede his release; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to discuss the progress of other OMS reconciliation talks, particularly with Gen </p>
<p>Mohan; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to resolve difficulties over specific releases; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to discuss post-release contact with JAM1.</p>
<p><b>637. </b> JAM1’s reaction to the draft agreement was “neutral” and he agreed to reflect on </p>
<p>it. His immediate concern remained one of process: who would organise the agreement </p>
<p>and who would sign up as the leaders of Basra?</p>
<p><b>638. </b> The officials visited JAM1 again two days later on 29 November in order to hear </p>
<p>his reaction to the draft Declaration, which was positive. The RSG had also directed </p>
<p>that the officials should secure endorsement for MND(SE)’s training/development role </p>
<p>and draw on that to reach a fuller agreement to future contact. JAM1 considered that </p>
<p>70-80 percent of the Najaf leadership would sign up to the sort of MNF deployment </p>
<p>envisaged.</p>
<p><b>639. </b> The record of the meeting concluded:</p>
<p>“[JAM1]’s position is, of course, inconsistent, even schizophrenic. He has supported </p>
<p>our development and training agenda by deed as well as word; he says the right </p>
<p>things about development and governance; he draws a distinction between the view </p>
<p>of the ‘old men’ in Najaf: reactionary, anti-development, anti-MNF in any form, and </p>

<p>his own far more positive and constructive views. Some of this, particularly the last </p>
<p>bit, is clearly heartfelt. But much of it may also be linked to the issue of releases, </p>
<p>which is the subject that, until the threat to JAM in Basra, was the one that inspired </p>
<p>most heat and emotion in our meetings. On the other hand he still talks bitterly about </p>
<p>the ‘occupation’ and did not yet seem completely free of the dread inspired by the </p>
<p>prospect of Najaf’s disfavour.”</p>
<p><b>640. </b> On 29 November, Mr Prentice reported that a US/Iraqi bilateral Statement of </p>
<p>Intent about a long-term military, security and economic relationship had been signed </p>
<p>by President Bush and Prime Minister Maliki on 26 November.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> This included a firm </p>
<p>US commitment to the Iraqi Government that the next resolution would be the final one </p>
<p>under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Mr Prentice advised that the next step would be negotiation of the resolution and </p>
<p>the accompanying letter from the Iraqi Government formally requesting the extension </p>
<p>of the MNF-I mandate. Mr Zebari had already said publicly that the letter would be </p>
<p>submitted to the Iraqi Council of Representatives for approval. On the basis of the length </p>
<p>of time it had taken to negotiate the US/Iraqi Statement of Intent, Mr Prentice considered </p>
<p>it likely that negotiations would go “to the wire”.</p>
<p><b>642. </b> The timeframe for negotiating long-term security agreements was a longer one </p>
<p>and Mr Prentice thought it unlikely that talks would begin before the New Year. He </p>
<p>commented that the UK would soon need to decide how best to frame the “new legal </p>
<p>base for UK forces’ presence and activity in Iraq post-2008” and also whether the UK </p>
<p>preferred its interests to be covered in relevant parts of the US-Iraq agreement or to </p>
<p>negotiate its own agreement. </p>
<p><b>643. </b> Several senior Iraqi politicians had already expressed the hope that the UK would </p>
<p>want to build on the “positive and much appreciated” role it had played in founding the </p>
<p>new Iraq, and that it would be natural for the new relationship to be expressed in a </p>
<p>UK-Iraq bilateral agreement.</p>

<p>to Iraq to lead negotiations on the new resolution.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> Mr Prentice stressed the need for </p>
<p>transparency and consultation on both the resolution and the accompanying letters.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>302</p>
<p>add a number of principles “unacceptable to both the US and ourselves” to the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government’s letter to the Security Council. They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the right of the Iraqi Government to assume full command and control of the ISF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the recruitment, training and equipping of the ISF should be the </p>
<p>responsibility of the Iraqi Government; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that all coalition detentions should be governed by Iraqi law.</p>
<p><b>646. </b> In discussions with the US, Mr Prentice emphasised that the UK was keen for </p>
<p>a smooth roll-over, but had concerns that the language in the letter could undermine </p>
<p>the effect of the Chapter VII resolution. He wanted to ensure that UK legal advisers </p>
<p>had an opportunity to clear the language and that any differences between the US and </p>
<p>UK interpretations could be ironed out before the US responded formally to the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government and before the texts were sent to New York. </p>
<p><b>647. </b> Ambassador Satterfield agreed to share the text of the Iraqi Government’s letter </p>
<p>as soon as he received it.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported on 3 December that the US was focused on the new </p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> Although there remained “the possibility of political ambush on the subject </p>
<p>of US military freedom of action”, US attention was beginning to turn to the Long Term </p>
<p>Security Arrangement (LTSA) that would succeed it. </p>
<p><b>649. </b> Gen Petraeus had directed his staff to help lay the groundwork for a UK equivalent </p>
<p>of the LTSA or a Chapter VI resolution that would provide adequate protection for UK </p>
<p>(and EU) involvement in Iraq. Lt Gen Rollo wrote that the UK would need to take an </p>
<p>early view on the level of protection it required and whether it was obtainable without a </p>
<p>Chapter VII resolution.</p>
<p><b>650. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented that, despite being “relatively innocuous” in itself, the </p>
<p>US/Iraqi bilateral Statement of Intent had “acted as a lightning rod for Iraqi frustration </p>
<p>over a number of sovereignty issues”, an indication of the friction that the debate on the </p>
<p>successor resolution was likely to prompt. </p>
<p><b>651. </b> On 3 December, the House of Commons Defence Committee published a report </p>
<p>entitled <i>UK land operations in Iraq 2007</i>, based in part on its visit to Iraq in July.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>652. </b> The Defence Committee said:</p>
<p>“In South-Eastern Iraq, there has been a dramatic decrease in the number of attacks </p>
<p>against UK and coalition forces since the decision was taken to withdraw from Basra </p>
<p>Palace, but there has been no corresponding reduction in the number of attacks </p>
<p>against the civilian population of Basra.”</p>

<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>303</p>
<p><b>653. </b> The Defence Committee considered that there had been significant progress in the </p>
<p>training, equipping and mentoring of the Iraqi Army in the past year but:</p>
<p>“There remain murderous, corrupt and militia-infiltrated elements within the Police </p>
<p>which must be rooted out as a matter of priority. The UK continues to play an </p>
<p>important role in training and mentoring the Iraqi Army and Police. It is unclear how </p>
<p>its trainers will be supported once UK forces levels are reduced further in the spring.”</p>
<p><b>654. </b> In relation to plans to reduce UK forces levels to 2,500 in spring 2008, the </p>
<p>Committee wrote:</p>
<p>“Important questions remain about the sustainability of a force of this size. If there is </p>
<p>still a role for UK Forces in Iraq, those Forces must be capable of doing more than </p>
<p>just protecting themselves at Basra Air Station. If the reduction in numbers means </p>
<p>they cannot do more than this, the entire UK presence in South-Eastern Iraq will be </p>
<p>open to question.”</p>
<p><b>655. </b> In a Current Assessment Note issued on 4 December, a CIG considered the </p>
<p>significance to JAM and the Sadrists of the Iraqi National Gathering (ING) splinter </p>
<p>group.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>656. </b> The CIG assessed that those close to Muqtada al-Sadr were concerned that </p>
<p>the ING’s establishment might lead to a significant number of defections from the </p>
<p>mainstream Sadrist movement, but judged that those who might consider defecting were </p>
<p>likely to wait to see the impact of the ING before joining the new movement. </p>
<p><b>657. </b> The note continued:</p>
<p>“Sadr probably views the ING as a direct attack on his authority. He does not appear </p>
<p>willing to make any concessions … </p>
<p>“As former JAM special group commanders, the ING members have links to the </p>
<p>Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force and Lebanese Hizballah. However, </p>
<p>we have no intelligence to suggest that either is supporting the ING.”</p>
<p><b>658. </b> On 4 December, a video was released of one of the five British hostages </p>
<p>kidnapped from the Ministry of Finance in Baghdad on 29 May by men dressed in Iraqi </p>
<p>Police uniforms.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> In it, the kidnappers threatened to kill a hostage if the UK did not </p>
<p>leave Iraq by 13 December. </p>
<p><b>659. </b> Prime Minister Maliki and Governor Waili met on 5 December and “cleared the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>660. </b> When Mr Brown and President Bush spoke on the telephone on 6 December, </p>
<p>Mr Brown reported that he was looking forward to the move to PIC in Basra on </p>
<p>16 December and the UK was planning to launch the Basra Investment Forum.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported “continued good progress” on security and economic reconstruction </p>
<p>in the South. </p>
<p><b>661. </b> On 7 December, government officials working closely with the military reported </p>
<p>to London on a “difficult meeting” with JAM1 the previous day.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>662. </b> The officials also reported that detainee releases were now in the gift of </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns rather than requiring sign-off in Whitehall. The release of JAM1 was </p>
<p>an exception to this rule, and was to be delegated to Mr Prentice. </p>
<p><b>663. </b> FCO officials advised Mr Miliband on 7 December that representatives of all the </p>
<p>parties in Basra signed “a statement … in which they agreed to support the security </p>
<p>services in their efforts to maintain security and work for stability and growth in Basra”.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although there had been similar declarations in the past, the FCO considered this </p>
<p>statement to be more significant because of the broad political support it had attracted, </p>
<p>in particular from OMS. FCO officials described the statement as the work of Sayyid </p>
<p>Abdul Ali al-Musawi, a prominent Shia cleric, and Sheikh Amr al-Faiz, a tribal leader.</p>
<p><b>664. </b> Also on 7 December, officials in the FCO submitted advice to Mr Miliband on the </p>
<p>strategy for negotiations leading to the release of JAM1.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> MOD officials sent a copy </p>
<p>of that advice to Mr Browne, under separate cover, on the same day. </p>
<p><b>665. </b> A junior official from the FCO Iraq Group advised Mr Miliband that the key issue </p>
<p>was ensuring that the UK obtained “maximum benefit from the timing of the release </p>
<p>of [JAM1]”.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> The advice explained that negotiations had always been based on </p>
<p>the understanding that JAM1 would be released eventually, and recommended that </p>
<p>Mr Miliband should delegate the decision on the precise timing of JAM1’s release to </p>
<p>Mr Prentice, who would consult Maj Gen Binns, Mr Jones and “other interested parties </p>
<p>on the ground”. </p>
<p><b>666. </b> The junior official advised that JAM1’s release could attract media attention, </p>
<p>in response to which the FCO’s message would be that “the process was part of the </p>
<p>coalition’s and GOI’s wider strategy of reconciliation with armed groups in Iraq”. </p>

<p><b>667. </b> The junior official repeated the risks set out in his 19 November submission, </p>
<p>concluding that “It is impossible to predict before the event how these risks will play in </p>
<p>detail” and that choosing the best timing for JAM1’s release would mitigate them to some </p>
<p>extent. On timing, the official explained that the final detainee releases were expected </p>
<p>in early to mid-January, and “depending on developments on the ground, it might be </p>
<p>tactically wise to release [JAM1] somewhat earlier, although we would not expect to do </p>
<p>so before Basra has achieved Provincial Iraqi Control.”</p>
<p><b>668. </b> The following day, the junior FCO official sent Mr Miliband’s office some additional </p>
<p>text supplied by Mr Prentice “as further clarification” of his submission. It said: </p>
<p>“Whilst delegating the decision to us is fine, this is not just a sovereign issue. </p>
<p>As GOC MND(SE) comes under MNF-I and Petraeus’ command, they would have </p>
<p>to be consulted. And we would have to inform the GoI (Maliki) of our plans as such </p>
<p>a decision would play into the broader Shia reconciliation strategy.”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>669. </b> Mr Day’s parallel submission to Mr Browne explained that the FCO was taking </p>
<p>responsibility for JAM1’s release. The submission reflected advice from theatre that </p>
<p>delegated authority was needed because of the speed with which the position on the </p>
<p>ground was developing.</p>

<p>whom the submission was copied, wrote on the advice on 11 December that although </p>
<p>Mr Browne had already “noted the submission” she had concerns about whether the </p>
<p>decision should be delegated because:</p>
<p>“The implications of his release are strategic and I think the decision ought to be </p>
<p>taken here, away from tactical considerations.”</p>

<p>not be delegated.”</p>

<p>security terms, with no major incidents in Anbar, Baghdad or the South.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> There were </p>
<p>some “interesting dynamics” in the South, with “Maliki’s Iraqi led operations” in Karbala </p>
<p>and Diwaniyah, together with “rumours of a major offensive in Basra”. They were “having </p>
<p>an effect on JAM” but the freeze was holding. In Basra, “despite much talk of defensive </p>
<p>preparation, JAM, backed up by OMS from Najaf, have come to the table and appear to </p>
<p>be willing to sign up to some if not all of Mohan’s demands”.</p>
<p><b>676. </b> At the local political level, Lt Gen Rollo reported that Governor Waili was </p>
<p>“reconciled to Maliki”. Lt Gen Rollo considered that this cleared the way for the Basra </p>
<p>Development Forum meeting on 12 December and for transition to PIC on 16 December. </p>
<p>It also meant that the way was clear to:</p>
<p>“… focus hard on how the promises to be made at the Forum will be kept … </p>
<p>General Petraeus’s challenge, reiterated to each UK visitor, to fulfil our Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s intent has been very clear. Barham Saleh underlined this point when he </p>
<p>spoke to the MOD and FCO Permanent Secretaries who visited this week along </p>
<p>with the DFID Director covering the Middle East. He said that while long term </p>
<p>capacity building remained essential, ‘jump starting’ was now necessary … That </p>
<p>should give us our lead. The way that money has been poured into Anbar, by both </p>
<p>the US and the GOI, to reinforce success is also setting the standard; recognising </p>
<p>that in counter-insurgency operations, all the lines of operation must be properly </p>
<p>supported.”</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Mr Brown reported on his visit to Iraq at Cabinet on 11 December.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> He said that </p>
<p>British troops would be transferring responsibility for the security of Basra to PIC on </p>
<p>16 December as planned. The number of violent incidents targeted at British forces </p>

<p>transition would enable force levels to reduce from 4,500 to 2,500 by March 2008, at </p>
<p>which point the future position would be reviewed.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Foreign Policy Adviser to Mr Blair until June 2007 and </p>
<p>subsequently British Ambassador to the US, told the Inquiry that “we deliberately chose </p>
<p>as a government to accept that as we left Basra it wouldn’t be perfect; it was going to be </p>
<p>rough and ready and difficult. We developed deliberately this doctrine of sufficiency.”</p>
<p>315</p>
<p><b>679. </b> On 12 December, a junior official from the FCO Iraq Group sent further advice to </p>
<p>Mr Miliband, apparently in response to his request for “more detail on the criteria which </p>
<p>we would use to inform a decision to release the detained JAM leader [JAM1]”.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>680. </b> The junior official advised that “it is not possible to provide a comprehensive </p>
<p>checklist of things which would have to happen (or not happen) before we decided to </p>
<p>release [JAM1]”. Since the negotiations had always been based on the understanding </p>
<p>that JAM1 would be released at some stage, the question was when to release, not </p>
<p>whether to release.</p>
<p><b>681. </b> The junior official went on to explain that: </p>
<p>“… our main aim is to sustain the JAM cease-fire against us, and to secure … a </p>
<p>clear commitment to certain principles. These would centre on undertakings to end </p>
<p>violence and intimidation against MNF, the ISF, other political parties, our LE [locally </p>
<p>engaged] staff and others, and to respect the democratic process …</p>
<p>“We will, as far as possible, seek to secure such a commitment from [JAM1] before </p>
<p>he is released. But the time to do so is limited. In addition, it may be tactically </p>
<p>preferable to release [JAM1] even if he has not given all of the commitments which </p>
<p>we are seeking, either as a mark of our good faith or to increase his ability to deliver </p>
<p>his JAM colleagues.” </p>
<p><b>682. </b> At the MOD’s request, on 12 December the JIC examined the strength, cohesion </p>
<p>and prospects for the Sunni insurgency in Iraq.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>683. </b> The JIC judged that the decreasing levels of violence in Iraq were due in significant </p>
<p>part to a “shift in the priorities of some Sunni insurgents who had reduced attacks on the </p>
<p>MNF in favour of working with it to resist AQ-I as part of the US-sponsored ‘Concerned </p>
<p>Local Citizens’ groups (CLCs)” (see Section 12.1).</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>308</p>
<p>together in some areas as recognition of the political benefits of unity is slowly </p>
<p>emerging. The formation of new alliances and willingness of some groups to </p>
<p>negotiate at a tactical level with the MNF shows that engagement is possible – </p>
<p>albeit locally.</p>
<p>“III. The combination of Sunni resistance and pressure from MNF and Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces is limiting AQ-I’s freedom to operate. It is struggling and no longer driving </p>
<p>sectarian violence. But AQ-I remains capable of undermining stability in Iraq: it can </p>
<p>still hit strategic targets. Without sustained military pressure and less sectarian </p>
<p>politics, it could regenerate and reinvigorate sectarian violence.”</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Looking ahead, the JIC concluded:</p>
<p>“We see no sign that the Sunni insurgency will recover its momentum at least as </p>
<p>long as the US ‘surge’ and coalition support for CLCs lasts …</p>
<p>“If the anti-AQ-I movement continues throughout 2008, we would expect Iraq to </p>
<p>become a less attractive destination for those wishing to join AQ-I and fight the </p>
<p>global jihad. Some Iraqis might abandon AQ-I for other insurgent groups of CLCs. </p>
<p>However, we judge the Sunni community’s continued rejection of AQ-I and tolerance </p>
<p>of the MNF will be fragile so long as Sunni grievances are not being addressed </p>
<p>quickly enough. CLC members expect financial and political rewards … Recently </p>
<p>announced Iraqi and US plans to release about 15,000 (mainly Sunni) detainees by </p>
<p>the end of 2008 might temporarily appease some more Sunnis, if implemented. But </p>
<p>we judge there is still a high risk that the current security gains will fade after the US </p>
<p>‘surge’ ends in April unless Maliki’s government visibly improves public services in </p>
<p>Sunni areas, provides lasting employment, allows for early provincial elections and </p>
<p>reverses its policy on de-Ba’athification.”</p>
<p><b>686. </b> On 12 December, Prime Minister Maliki and Governor Waili jointly hosted a </p>

<p>318</p>
<p> Mr Alexander </p>
<p>attended to represent the UK and was joined by a number of Iraqi ministers, including </p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Saleh. The work of the Basra Development Forum is addressed </p>
<p>in Section 10.2.</p>
<p><b>687. </b> Mr Prentice described it as a “hugely successful event” which struck “an optimistic </p>
<p>note on the governance and economic agenda to complement the security handover” </p>
<p>which was due to take place four days later. He reported to the FCO that the event had </p>
<p>helped to bridge the divide between Basra and Baghdad, through the first visit by Prime </p>

<p>colleagues had “many hours of amusement” discussing with their military colleagues </p>
<p>in the preceding months how developments relating to the economy, which had been </p>
<p>identified as “the crucial thing” in helping to keep Basra stable to allow for PIC, could </p>
<p>support progress on security.</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Lt Gen Rollo recorded that Prime Minister Maliki had made a strong speech </p>
<p>in response to which Governor Waili promised that Basra would be disarmed and </p>
<p>corruption rooted out.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>690. </b> Maj Gen Binns observed that relations between Prime Minister Maliki and </p>
<p>Governor Waili were clearly much improved as they sat together.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> He reported that </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki described 2008 as “the year of redevelopment and reconstruction”. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> Maj Gen Binns wrote that, despite the operations MND(SE) had been conducting </p>
<p>on the border in Maysan and Basra, the US chain of command appeared still to have </p>
<p>concerns. They were proposing to build forward operating bases at border crossings </p>
<p>in Basra and Maysan, and to deploy a US artillery battalion there from March 2008. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns explained:</p>
<p>“I have made the point that I believe that militarily this is not necessary, but have </p>
<p>also conceded that if MNC-I want to do this then we should be seen to support them. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly Gen Mohan and Gen Abbas are supportive of the proposal. My chief </p>
<p>concern has been the potential impact on reconciliation and Basra dynamics and the </p>
<p>level of support expected from MND(SE).” </p>
<p><b>692. </b> On 13 December, Mr McDonald updated the Iraq Strategy Group on Mr Brown’s </p>
<p>visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> He said that:</p>
<p>“Despite some views expressed in theatre, the Prime Minister was clear that we </p>
<p>should continue on our path of Iraqiisation set out in his October statement, which </p>
<p>should entail a significant reduction in our force levels from November 2008.”</p>
<p><b>693. </b> SIS6 told the Iraq Strategy Group that “influence with local leaders was likely to </p>
<p>reduce in the near future, and that might lead to a deterioration in the security situation”. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group also discussed a draft FCO strategy paper for 2008-2009 </p>
<p>and concluded that it would not be ready for Ministers to read over Christmas as had </p>
<p>been intended.</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Mr McDonald commissioned the MOD to produce a paper setting out two </p>

<p><b>696. </b> On 14 December, a Private Secretary confirmed that Mr Miliband was content to </p>
<p>delegate authority to Mr Prentice to take the decision about when to release JAM1.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said that Mr Miliband believed that the negotiations had “proven their worth” and </p>

<p> Mr Miliband attended the handover ceremony for the UK, and </p>
<p>Dr Rubaie for the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p><b>698. </b> After the transition in Basra, all of the four provinces within MND(SE) were under </p>
<p>Iraqi control, with “overwatch” support from UK and other coalition forces. </p>
<p><b>699. </b> In total, nine Iraqi provinces had made the transition to PIC, half of the total.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>700. </b> After the ceremony, Mr Miliband remained in Iraq to visit Baghdad and Erbil.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Prentice reported that Mr Miliband told “Zebari and Maliki that PIC in Basra would </p>
<p>not mean any diminution of our effort or commitment but did mark a new stage in </p>
<p>our relationship”. Mr Miliband also “urged on all … the need for political leadership to </p>
<p>unblock vital legislation and make progress on political reconciliation”.</p>
<p><b>701. </b> In his visit report to Mr Brown, Mr Miliband said that “Iraqi press coverage [of the </p>

<p>But he warned that the improvement would not be sustained without political progress:</p>
<p>“There is a general lack of political drive and leadership. No one in government </p>
<p>is willing to accept responsibility for delivery of legislation through the Council of </p>
<p>Representatives.”</p>
<p><b>704. </b> The UK’s challenge, in Mr Miliband’s view, was “to decide what more it is that we </p>
<p>can realistically do to help the country maintain forward momentum”. The work under </p>
<p>way across Whitehall to review UK strategy would assist, but:</p>
<p>“My own initial view is that we should neither start with a numbers game in terms </p>
<p>of troops, nor an open ended security commitment driven by commitment on </p>
<p>economic development. Instead we need to build on the points of consensus: that </p>
<p>Iraq depends on local political leadership supported by the international community, </p>
<p>that we have distinctive sunk costs in Iraq but also distinctive assets to deploy …; </p>
<p>that there are real foreign policy arguments for continued engagement; but these </p>
<p>need to be justified by a clear, coherent and agreed plan for Iraq supported by the </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>706. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Browne whether there was a sense that the UK had rushed </p>
<p>the pace of transfer to Iraqi control.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> Mr Browne considered that, in fact, the reverse </p>
<p>had often been true: the Iraqis were keen to speed up the process of transfer but the UK </p>
<p>needed, at times, to slow the pace down a bit.</p>
<p><b>707. </b> In his book <i>Surge</i>, Colonel Peter Mansoor (Gen Petraeus’ executive officer in </p>
<p>2007), wrote that after transition to PIC: </p>
<p>“The Jaysh al-Mahdi assumed control of large sections of Basra, inflicting on its </p>
<p>residents a severe brand of Shari’a law that forced women to wear the <i>jihab</i> [sic] </p>
<p>on pain of death, closed barber shops and music stores, and generally made life </p>
<p>miserable for city residents. The situation proved yet again that without control </p>
<p>or protection of the population, counter-insurgency efforts would fail and the Iraqi </p>
<p>people would suffer. For his part, Muqtada al-Sadr took credit for forcing the British </p>
<p>out of Iraq.”</p>

<p>not wanted to go to war with the British, but they had “occupied his country and attacked </p>
<p>his groups”. Now it was time for a fresh page and for reconstruction and reconciliation. </p>
<p>He wished that the process of negotiation had begun in 2004 or 2005 but it had been </p>
<p>impossible to find British interlocutors to take it on. He hoped that the process would </p>
<p>now be a model for the rest of Iraq to follow. There should be no further animosity </p>
<p>against the British Military and he hoped that British soldiers would get home safely. It </p>
<p>was agreed that JAM1’s release should be brought forward by a few hours, because of </p>
<p>security concerns. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>719. </b> A senior government official specialising in the Middle East (2) wrote to </p>
<p>Dr John Jenkins, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, on 21 December to take </p>
<p>stock following JAM1’s release and to offer views on next steps for JAM and Shia </p>
<p>engagement.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> He wrote that “The key task for HMG is to preserve the relative peace </p>
<p>in Basra” in order to protect what had been achieved already and “to try to bring the </p>
<p>Sadrist movement nationally to the kind of strategic tipping point achieved with the </p>
<p>Sunnis in Anbar”. The objective was a “fractured, but not atomised, JAM”. He wrote that </p>
<p>Shia engagement would remain a “strategic priority in Iraq” with the aim of deepening </p>
<p>dialogue with a range of Sadrist interlocutors. But only the US would have the “breadth </p>
<p>and depth” for Shia engagement across Iraq, so the challenge was “to support and </p>
<p>influence this effort not to go it alone”. </p>
<p><b>720. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Mr Brown on 22 December with an update on force levels </p>
<p>from spring 2008, reflecting “further work” since Mr Brown’s statement to Parliament </p>
<p>on 8 October.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>721. </b> Mr Browne wrote that the latest military advice, endorsed by the Chiefs of </p>
<p>Staff and incorporating direction from Gen Petraeus, was that the UK should deploy </p>
<p>2,750 personnel in southern Iraq, supported by 800 in Kuwait. That was 550 higher than </p>
<p>Mr Brown had announced on 8 October. The reason for the increase was a decision by </p>
<p>the Czech government to withdraw its Basra contingent in 2008 and the need to have a </p>
<p>slightly larger headquarters to provide for effective understanding of the situation on the </p>
<p>ground and to ensure effective engagement with key Iraqi leaders. </p>
<p><b>722. </b> Mr Browne advised:</p>
<p>“… I believe we can present these figures as broadly consistent with the aspirations </p>
<p>you outlined to Parliament in October, and further that we can make a positive </p>
<p>case for a small potential increase in our planning figures, as a demonstration of </p>
<p>how decisions on force levels will be guided by advice from military commanders </p>
<p>and an assessment of conditions on the ground – a point you and I have always </p>
<p>emphasised.”</p>
<p><b>723. </b> On 24 December, Lt Gen Rollo reported a “startling sequel” to the handover </p>
<p>ceremony in Basra.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> Gen Mohan and Governor Waili held a press conference </p>
<p>alongside an OMS delegation from Najaf, live on Al Iraqiya television. The OMS </p>

<p><b>724. </b> Lt Gen Rollo also reported that Mr Kevin Rudd, newly elected Prime Minister of </p>
<p>Australia, had visited Basra and announced the withdrawal of the Australian battlegroup </p>
<p>and training contingent from Dhi Qar and Muthanna in June 2008, leaving only </p>
<p>embedded staff. </p>
<p><b>725. </b> On 31 December, Lt Gen Rollo sent ACM Stirrup a paper considering the main </p>
<p>areas of coalition effort for 2008, and issues for the UK to address.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>726. </b> In his introduction, Lt Gen Rollo wrote that Iraq was “in a much better condition </p>
<p>than it was a year ago”. The “viciously destabilising sectarian conflict” was now largely </p>
<p>absent; AQ-I had been driven out of most of Anbar and Baghdad and was gradually </p>
<p>being driven into the North; the Sadrists were maintaining their freeze and were riven </p>
<p>with internal conflict; and the ISF were rapidly increasing in number and capability. </p>
<p>But significant sections of the country remained insecure and violence remained at an </p>
<p>unacceptably high level, meaning that “we do not yet have ‘irreversible momentum’”.</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Given the dynamic nature of the campaign, Lt Gen Rollo reported that </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus would not make recommendations beyond the end of 2008 when </p>
<p>he reported to Congress in March. The main themes of the coalition effort for 2008 </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The pursuit of AQ-I, which was already badly damaged, and now able to operate </p>
<p>effectively only in areas where there are inadequate security forces and where </p>
<p>the population felt threatened, for example by local militias.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “reshaping of JAM/OMS”. The movement was splitting, its future direction </p>
<p>unclear; the coalition and the Iraqi Government would continue to support the </p>
<p>freeze, and would not go after any JAM members who respected it, but would </p>
<p>pursue others (including the Special Groups) who continue to conduct criminal </p>
<p>actions, seeking to separate the reconcilables from the irreconcilables and bind </p>
<p>them into the political process.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working with neighbouring countries to reduce the flow of foreign fighters </p>
<p>into Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Opening up the economy and increasing employment. The immediate concern </p>
<p>for the MNF was the need to help the tens of thousands of Sunni Arabs who </p>
<p>had participated in the Anbar Awakening to find jobs, reducing their “economic </p>
<p>motivation to take up arms against the Iraqi Government or MNF”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Building governance capacity at all levels.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Developing future bilateral security relationships, to form the basis for coalition </p>
<p>engagement in Iraq when resolution 1790 expired in December 2008. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>728. </b> As a consequence, Lt Gen Rollo considered that there were four main issues for </p>
<p>the UK to engage with in 2008:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working out where the UK military contribution in Iraq sat within the wider </p>
<p>strategic relationship with the US: “I fully appreciate that there are wider factors </p>
<p>at play, but it may nevertheless be helpful to make the obvious point that the US </p>
<p>military main effort (with 15 brigades deployed here, even in July 2008, against </p>
<p>two in Afghanistan) unquestionably remains Iraq, that this will still be the case in </p>
<p>2009, and that General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker consistently express </p>
<p>their wish for us to remain.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Determining the role, size and duration of the UK’s national effort in Basra: </p>
<p>“Our military effort … should be focused on support to the ISF. Our national </p>
<p>effort should be focused on political and economic development in the area. </p>
<p>But of course the two are inextricably related … This will need national effort and </p>
<p>needs to be properly resourced … In the long run Basra should be a success, </p>
<p>but without coalition support (which Petraeus and Crocker clearly believe should </p>
<p>be British led) we risk it going backwards in the short to medium term.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working out the extent to which the UK wished to support the ISF more broadly </p>
<p>in the future.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Engaging with the US on the restructuring of MNF-I, MNC-I and MNSTC-I, both </p>
<p>in terms of headquarters and basing.</p>
<p><b>729. </b> Lt Gen Rollo concluded:</p>
<p>“To say that the next six months in Iraq will be critical is a truism. What is clear is that </p>
<p>the Iraqis, and their allies, have been given a chance to move decisively in the right </p>
<p>direction, which if squandered is [not] likely to be reproduced.”</p>
<p><b>January 2008</b></p>
<p><b>730. </b> On 3 January, Mr Brown met Prime Minister Maliki in the UK and urged him to </p>
<p>make progress on the Hydrocarbons Law and on local elections as well as to appoint </p>
<p>Iraqi staff to support the Basra Development Forum.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> He also encouraged Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki to convene a further meeting of the “3 plus 1” Executive Group and to </p>
<p>re-appoint Gen Mohan and Gen Jalil for another term. Prime Minister Maliki agreed </p>
<p>to the re-appointments, and said he would increase Basra’s budget.</p>
<p><b>731. </b> One of Maj Gen Binns’ senior officers met Gen Mohan on 4 January to discuss </p>
<p>MND(SE) proposals for future support to the ISF (a “scalable support package”).</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gen Mohan suggested that an MOU would be required to formalise the arrangement </p>
<p>and guarantee the support. Maj Gen Binns commented that an MOU “would not be </p>

<p>helpful as it would require us to make some significant commitments and, potentially, </p>
<p>make it difficult for us to meet expectations” so he suggested that they should look at </p>
<p>“alternative confidence building measures” instead.</p>
<p><b>732. </b> In a letter to Mr Browne’s Private Secretary on 7 January, Mr Brown’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary said that the Prime Minister preferred to defer decisions and announcements </p>
<p>on force levels in Iraq until after the final review had taken place at the end of </p>
<p>February.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> The decision would need to be taken “in the light of advice from military </p>
<p>commanders, a full assessment of conditions on the ground, a further effort to </p>
<p>internationalise Iraq-handling … and a review of the progress of the Kuwait Support </p>
<p>Facility”.</p>
<p><b>733. </b> The same Private Secretary also wrote to Mr Miliband’s Private Secretary, with </p>
<p>Mr Brown’s response to the report of Mr Miliband’s visit.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>734. </b> Mr Brown agreed with Mr Miliband’s conclusions on the 2008 Iraq strategy and </p>
<p>was content for him to proceed as outlined. In particular, he was “keen to work hard to </p>
<p>persuade the US of the need to support early provincial elections” and agreed strongly </p>
<p>on the importance of “further internationalising the effort”. </p>
<p><b>735. </b> On 7 January, Mr McDonald and Ms Aldred met members of the US Administration </p>
<p>and explored US thinking on future force levels in Iraq.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> Mr McDonald explained that </p>
<p>the UK was continuing to plan on the basis of a reduction in UK troops in March or April, </p>
<p>but that the latest military advice was that the reduction should be to around 2,700 to </p>
<p>2,800; not 2,500 as previously envisaged. Options for beyond November 2008 were </p>
<p>under consideration but the UK would be constrained once the resolution expired. </p>
<p><b>736. </b> Mr McDonald and Ms Aldred were told that the US had not ruled out a further </p>
<p>resolution completely, only that there would not be another under Chapter VII. </p>
<p><b>737. </b> Lt Gen Houghton told the Chiefs of Staff at their 8 January meeting that HQ </p>
<p>MND(SE) had assessed that the impact of the Australian withdrawal on UK forces </p>
<p>would be “minimal”.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> Around 105 embedded personnel would remain. Danish troops </p>
<p>had already withdrawn, and Czech forces were due to do so in June, leaving Romanian </p>
<p>forces alongside those of the UK. </p>
<p><b>738. </b> Gen Dannatt visited Basra and Baghdad between 13 and 15 January and had an </p>
<p>“extremely useful” meeting with Gen Petraeus, who outlined options to use US forces to </p>
<p>backfill into Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces once the Australian forces withdrew.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>739. </b> Two options were being considered; either extending the boundary of a combined </p>
<p>MND (Centre South) and MND (Centre) to encompass Muthanna and Dhi Qar or placing </p>
<p>US troops under UK command in MND(SE). Gen Dannatt wrote to the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>and senior officials in the MOD:</p>
<p>“It may be that we wish to volunteer early to take the US forces under command, in </p>
<p>order to shape the direction of our future engagement in Iraq rather than reduce to a </p>
<p>two-star controlling a single province.”</p>
<p><b>740. </b> Gen Dannatt also described experiencing in Baghdad and Basra a “palpable sense </p>
<p>of optimism … that has to be balanced against the growing realisation that unless we will </p>
<p>build on the successes of 2007, we will miss the opportunities that 2008 presents”. </p>
<p><b>741. </b> In his weekly report on 14 January, Lt Gen Rollo commented that although the final </p>
<p>days of 2007 had “very much the feel of a boat without wind”, there was “a very different </p>
<p>feel” to Baghdad at the start of 2008.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> He wrote: “The emphasis is on politics, and there </p>
<p>are clear signs of movement.” </p>
<p><b>742. </b> Efforts to counter AQ continued, with a series of MNF operations against </p>
<p>AQ strongholds in Baghdad and Diyala. Discussions continued in Baghdad on the </p>
<p>commercial plans for the development of Umm Qasr port in Basra. Lt Gen Rollo </p>
<p>commented: </p>
<p>“This offers a real opportunity for Basra and the South-East and we need to ensure </p>
<p>that contracts are let as quickly as possible … This will require co-ordination in </p>
<p>Baghdad, and with the Ministries and the Japan Bank of International Co-operation. </p>
<p>My team will continue to track this, but I remain of the view that the real answer is a </p>
<p>Basra Development Office in Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>743. </b> Lt Gen Rollo recorded that US work on the long term US-Iraqi bilateral Status of </p>
<p>Forces Agreement (SOFA) had begun in earnest, with a negotiating team due to arrive in </p>
<p>Iraq in February. </p>
<p><b>744. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported that there was provision in the US thinking for coalition </p>
<p>partners either to be covered by their agreement, or to adopt its language, or to </p>
<p>negotiate their own agreement. He believed that the US was aware that the European </p>
<p>Convention on Human Rights imposed particular demands on UK forces and was keen </p>
<p>to know what the UK would need in such an agreement. Maj Gen Rollo wrote that the </p>
<p>SOFA would cover all aspects of the MNF presence in Iraq and one would be necessary </p>
<p>regardless of the size of the UK’s commitment. He felt that: “A clear view on how we plan </p>
<p>to engage is overdue.”</p>

<p><b>745. </b> Mr Prentice reported that the “3+1” group had a “positive and productive meeting” </p>
<p>on 14 January, and formally agreed to rename themselves the Executive Council.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his view the atmosphere had clearly been different. Mr Prentice also reported that </p>
<p>“re-energising the 3+1 has coincided with the first step forward on key legislation we </p>
<p>have seen for some time”. </p>
<p><b>746. </b> On 14 January, in response to a Parliamentary Question from Lady Hermon, </p>
<p>Mr Browne said that the number of established military posts in Iraq had reduced by 100 </p>
<p>in October 2007 and 600 in November.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> Mr Browne added that by the end of January </p>
<p>he aimed to have reduced the number of posts by a further 350, and that work continued </p>
<p>to plan for future reductions to around 2,500 in southern Iraq from spring 2008. </p>
<p><b>747. </b> Maj Gen Binns’ weekly report of 17 January recorded that the Iraqi Department of </p>
<p>Border Enforcement had arrested eight individuals on the al-Faw Peninsula, in “an area </p>
<p>notorious for smuggling”, on 11 January.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>748. </b> Initial investigation revealed that four of the men were Iranian consular officials </p>
<p>from Basra, and the other four were Iraqis working as their personal security. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Binns commented that it was possible that the individuals were engaged </p>
<p>in smuggling lethal aid</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> or in the reconnaissance of potential routes for doing so. </p>
<p>The four Iranians were released two days later. </p>
<p><b>749. </b> The day after the Iranians were arrested, the ISF in Nasiriyah detained a </p>
<p>mainstream JAM figure who was believed to be the sponsor or leader of a splinter group </p>
<p>operating in contravention of the freeze on activity.</p>
<p><b>750. </b> On 18 January, a CIG considered foreign fighters entering Iraq via Syria.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The CIG assessed that the majority of foreign fighters joined AQ-I to become suicide </p>
<p>bombers. The main route for entry into Iraq was through Syria, using well-established </p>
<p>extremist facilitation networks and professional smugglers. </p>
<p><b>751. </b> The CIG judged that, although foreign fighters would undoubtedly find alternative </p>
<p>routes into Iraq, tougher action by the Syrians against facilitation networks would </p>
<p>restrict – at least temporarily – the supply of foreign suicide bombers and funds and help </p>
<p>maintain pressure on AQ-I.</p>
<p><b>752. </b> On 18 and 19 January, there was unrest in Basra and Nasiriyah during the Shia </p>

<p><b>753. </b> Clashes between the ISF and a Shia group called the Soldiers of Heaven resulted </p>
<p>in “dozens” of deaths.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>754. </b> Maj Gen Binns observed that the ISF had handled both situations effectively, </p>
<p>demonstrating evidence of enhanced capability and strength of resolve. MNF support </p>
<p>to the ISF in both cities was “measured, successful and appreciated by the ISF”.</p>
<p>360</p>

<p>JAM distanced themselves from the uprising and, Maj Gen Binns reported, “in some </p>
<p>cases moved actively to assist the IPS restoring order in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>755. </b> On 20 January, Lt Gen Rollo included “two initial observations … to help frame the </p>
<p>debate” about the future of the UK’s role in MND(SE) in his weekly report:</p>
<p>“First, before we go too far down the road of developing bilateral relations, we </p>
<p>should not forget that we still have to help the Iraqi Government establish law and </p>
<p>order in their country (in the face of a significant continuing threat from, amongst </p>
<p>others, AQ-I, insurgent Sunni terrorist groups and various Shia militias. Second, </p>
<p>as the campaign develops the route to success will increasingly be along the non-</p>
<p>military lines of operation – especially the economic one. If we choose we could let </p>
<p>the US take most of that burden, but in the South at least, they will be looking to us </p>
<p>to drive it. And therefore, our reputation with the US (as well as the Iraqis) will be </p>
<p>informed as much by our non-military contribution as our force numbers. And our </p>
<p>contribution in 2008 will set the conditions for what we can achieve there in future </p>
<p>years. As the Iraq Strategy work moves forward we would do well to keep this in the </p>
<p>forefront of our minds.”</p>

<p>363</p>
<p> They agreed that </p>
<p>it was right for MND(SE) to be a command in support of the Iraqi Government, ISF, FCO </p>
<p>and PRT. Lt Gen Odierno confirmed that Maysan remained an ongoing concern. Maj </p>
<p>Gen Binns judged that:</p>
<p>“… the US command in Iraq are seriously concerned about the lack of MNF </p>
<p>presence/control in Dhi Qar and Maysan. We may employ the argument that the </p>
<p>provinces have been PIC’d and that we MND(SE) are in strategic overwatch, but this </p>
<p>doesn’t convince US Commanders.”</p>
<p><b>759. </b> Maj Gen Binns told Lt Gen Houghton:</p>
<p>“I should therefore be grateful for your direction on what the UK position is regarding </p>
<p>the potential transfer of Dhi Qar, Maysan and Muthanna provinces to another MND’s </p>
<p>area of responsibility and the line I should take in discussions …”</p>

<p><i>The Aitken Report</i> summarised what had happened in Iraq, and steps taken since 2003 to </p>
<p>prevent similar events recurring. It concluded: </p>
<p>“The fact that these measures were not introduced in advance of the invasion of Iraq </p>
<p>may suggest a lack of awareness of the operational context by those responsible for </p>
<p>preparing our people for that operation, and thus a failing. At one level, the paucity of </p>
<p>planning for nation-rebuilding after the invasion (a consequence, in part, of the need </p>
<p>to give last-minute diplomacy a chance of success) was certainly a factor. Uncertainty </p>

<p>changed to insurgency.”</p>
<p><i>The Aitken Report</i> recommended that:</p>
<p>“We need to ensure that lessons learned from the disciplinary and administrative </p>
<p>processes (police investigations, legal advice and trials) are better collated as part </p>
<p>of the Army’s formal Lessons Learned process, so that trends in criminal behaviour </p>
<p>or professional shortcomings can be quickly identified and remedied. We need to </p>
<p>ensure that a better understanding of the Army’s Core Values, and their application, </p>
<p>is inculcated into all ranks, and especially commanders …”</p>
<p>Announcing the report’s publication in Parliament, Mr Browne said he was “proud </p>
<p>to acknowledge that the vast majority … who have served in Iraq have conducted </p>
<p>themselves to the highest standards of behaviour” and that he was “satisfied that the Army </p>
<p>is doing everything possible to ensure that its personnel do not repeat the appalling acts </p>
<p>that were perpetrated in these cases”.</p>

<p>In May 2008 Mr Browne announced a Public Inquiry into the death of Mr Baha Mousa.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Its report was published on 8 September 2011.</p>

<p>369</p>
<p> When the Provincial </p>
<p>Chief of Police visited the site the next morning, he was killed by a suicide bomber. </p>
<p><b>762. </b> As a consequence, Prime Minister Maliki had announced the “final battle” in the </p>
<p>struggle against AQ-I, following this up with what Lt Gen Rollo judged to be a “purposeful </p>
<p>performance” at the MCNS, arguing for the reinforcement of Ninawa. </p>
<p><b>763. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented: “This is not a question of changing strategic priorities – </p>
<p>reinforcements, predominantly Iraqi, have already been despatched to Mosul as part </p>
<p>of the overall operation, with more on the way – but it is a reflection of the political </p>
<p>requirement to be seen to be responding to a part of the country in need.”</p>
<p><b>764. </b> Gen Mohan and Gen Jalil conducted a review of the Ashura disturbances and </p>
<p>were reported by Maj Gen Binns on 31 January to be “pleased with the outcome of the </p>

<p><b>766. </b> Maj Gen Binns discussed the attacks with Governor Waili and said that while UK </p>

<p>Governor Waili undertook to develop a plan to deal with the problem as a priority.</p>
<p><b>767. </b> Government officials working closely with the military in Basra also reported rising </p>
<p>levels of IDF, including an attack on 31 January that was the heaviest ever experienced </p>
<p>by Basra Air Station.</p>

<p> JAM1 claimed that the attacks were the work of a splinter group </p>
<p>and not of his supporters, a claim which the officials considered to be justified. </p>

<p><b>768. </b> On 1 February, bombs exploded at two popular Baghdad markets in what </p>
<p>appeared to have been co-ordinated attacks.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> Mr Prentice reported that the local media </p>
<p>believed there to be at least 70 dead and more than 120 injured, though MNF estimates </p>
<p>were lower. Mr Prentice commented that these were the deadliest attacks in Baghdad </p>
<p>since the surge began the previous summer. He wrote:</p>
<p>“Initial reporting was that these attacks had been carried out by female suicide </p>
<p>bombers, with Al Qaida (AQ-I) being the prime suspect. However, eyewitness </p>
<p>reports state that the two women wearing the bombs were mentally ill … [and] </p>
<p>regularly frequented the markets.” </p>
<p>That led to speculation that the bombs had been detonated by remote control. </p>
<p><b>769. </b> Mr Prentice reported that there had been an increase in the use of female suicide </p>
<p>bombers; they were actively recruited by AQ-I as they were unlikely to be searched by </p>
<p>men at checkpoints. He commented:</p>
<p>“It may never be known for sure who was behind these attacks. But, if it is confirmed </p>
<p>that two mentally ill women were used as ‘mules’, a new low in bestial criminal </p>
<p>activity in Iraq will have been set.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>324</p>
<p><b>771. </b> Ahead of the arrival of the US SOFA negotiating team in Baghdad in mid-February, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Rollo reported that MNF-I was focused on retaining four key authorities within </p>
<p>Iraq: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ability to train and equip the ISF; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contractor immunities and privileges;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the power to detain; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“full spectrum operations”.</p>
<p><b>772. </b> All four of these were seen as “essential to mission success”. Lt Gen Rollo </p>
<p>reported acceptance that the SOFA might need to be wrapped into a wider political and </p>
<p>economic agreement. </p>
<p><b>773. </b> On 3 February, officials produced a discussion paper for MND(SE) entitled </p>
<p>‘Maintaining the Accommodation, Reducing IDF’.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> They explained that, compared with </p>
<p>early 2007, the attack figures remained “very modest” but that the upward trend required </p>
<p>attention, and possibly a “tuning” of strategy and tactics. </p>
<p><b>774. </b> A number of “carrots and sticks” were proposed in the paper, including releases </p>
<p>from US detention, supplying intelligence on attackers to the ISF, political engagement, </p>
<p>interdiction, a show of force, persuading Muqtada al-Sadr to extend his cease-fire, </p>
<p>reducing Iranian influence and visible development activity. </p>
<p><b>775. </b> The paper concluded: “It may well be that … a confrontation between JAM and </p>
<p>the ISF is inevitable. But our sense is that the longer the majority of JAM fighters can </p>
<p>be persuaded to go without the stimulus and status of regular combat, the weaker the </p>
<p>force will be.”</p>
<p><b>776. </b> On 4 February, Sir John Scarlett wrote to Mr Miliband with an “update from the </p>
<p>ground” following a recent visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> It included the situation in the South. Although </p>
<p>there had been some interest in re-creating the effect elsewhere in Iraq, the US was:</p>
<p>“… suspicious of our Shia engagement in the South, which, despite its parallels to </p>
<p>the CLC programme, they see as allowing Iranian influence to expand.”</p>
<p><b>777. </b> Sir John wrote:</p>
<p>“Although Basra province is relatively quiet, the political and military situation is still </p>
<p>fragile and the risk of significant further conflict remains … [JAM1] appears to be </p>
<p>exerting a positive influence in Basra. But some Sadrist hardline militants, probably </p>
<p>no more than 2-300 strong, continue to defy the accommodation and attack UK </p>
<p>Forces. IDF into the COB is showing a spike. If it ramps up significantly HMG has </p>
<p>few levers of influence. Development and economic projects might improve the </p>

<p>committed hardliners from attacks …”</p>
<p><b>778. </b> Sir John observed that, as UK forces were concentrated in Basra Air Station:</p>
<p>“… HMG now has less situational awareness and ground truth on what is going on </p>
<p>in Basra on a day to day basis …”</p>
<p><b>779. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether the relocation had reduced the ability of UK forces </p>
<p>to intervene in support of the ISF, Mr Day said: “No, I don’t think it did … We retained </p>
<p>the ability to re-engage, if asked to do so by the Iraqis, or if the threat to the airport </p>
<p>required it.”</p>
<p>376</p>
<p><b>780. </b> On 6 February, a senior government official specialising in the Middle East (2) </p>
<p>wrote to Mr Jenkins with an update on the Shia engagement strategy, in advance </p>
<p>of a planned discussion of Shia engagement at the Cabinet Office on 8 February.</p>
<p>377</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He outlined a proposal “to continue to work towards the broad strategy indicated in my </p>
<p>letter of 21 December”. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> On Iranian influence, the senior official explained:</p>
<p>“As illustrated by the changes in the Secret Cells, for the time being Iran’s main </p>
<p>focus seems to be on building political influence. Just as [HMG] is seeking to pull </p>
<p>Iran’s proxies out of an Iranian orbit, the Iranians are reaching out to the new Sadrist </p>
<p>groups such as Adnan Al-Shahmani’s Iraqi National Gathering (ING) and Fadilah, to </p>
<p>ensure continuing lines of Iranian influence across Shia politics in Iraq. Meanwhile, </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr remains marginalised.”</p>
<p><b>782. </b> On 7 February, at the request of the MOD and the FCO, the JIC assessed changes </p>
<p>in the Sadrist Trend, led by Muqtada al-Sadr, and their implications for violence and </p>
<p>political reconciliation.</p>
<p>378</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>783. </b> It judged:</p>
<p>“I. The Office of the Martyr Sadr (OMS) is marginalised, in disarray and much </p>
<p>weaker politically than at any time since 2003. Muqtada al-Sadr’s goals are largely </p>
<p>unchanged. How he intends to achieve them and his own future role are less clear, </p>
<p>including to him.</p>
<p>“II. Sadr’s lineage means he will almost certainly remain a key ideological influence </p>
<p>for the Sadrist Trend. But his ability to exert political authority over the senior cadre </p>
<p>of OMS officials is now weak. He may relinquish his position altogether …</p>

<p>326</p>
<p>“III. Whether Sadr’s political rivals, including those in the JAM Special Groups and </p>
<p>the new Iraqi National Gathering, gain traction with the grassroots Sadrist movement </p>
<p>will probably depend more on Sadr’s next moves than on what they can deliver for </p>
<p>the Shia …</p>
<p>“IV. The Iranians for now probably place more weight on overt political support </p>
<p>to their traditional allies in ISCI/Badr than on military support for JAM. In areas of </p>
<p>the South where the coalition’s footprint has diminished, ‘Iranian Intelligence’ may </p>
<p>have started to replace the coalition as the focus of JAM’s campaign to get rid of </p>
<p>foreign influence.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“VII. Sadr will almost certainly extend the ‘freeze’ on JAM activities beyond this </p>
<p>month. But it will remain fragile and could give way in some areas at any time … </p>
<p>A large proportion of JAM will remain engaged in often violent criminality.”</p>
<p><b>784. </b> The JIC assessed that fierce competition for the Shia vote between ISCI/Badr and </p>
<p>OMS/JAM was likely to result in further clashes as the provincial elections approached </p>
<p>(not expected until late 2008 at the earliest). However, under pressure from the Shia </p>
<p>religious authorities, both sides had established joint committees to avert clashes, but </p>
<p>the JIC judged that “some local Badr commanders are using the cover of ISF to exploit </p>
<p>the JAM freeze and irreversibly weaken their chief rival”.</p>
<p><b>Kidnap of Mr Richard Butler</b></p>
<p>On 9 February 2008, Mr Richard Butler, a British journalist working with CBS, was </p>
<p>kidnapped along with his Iraqi interpreter in Basra.</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> The interpreter was freed three days </p>
<p>later. Mr Butler was eventually freed on 14 April during a raid by members of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army, who were believed to have been looking for a weapons cache. </p>
<p><b>785. </b> On 11 February, Lt Gen Rollo reported having discussed the MND(SE) boundary </p>
<p>with Gen Petraeus, who was keen that the UK two-star commander had a proper role, </p>
<p>and did not regard the tactical command and control advantages of a single nation </p>
<p>covering an area of operations as decisive.</p>
<p>380</p>
<p> Gen Petraeus also thought that the MNF </p>
<p>divisional boundaries should mirror those of the Iraqi Army, which was likely to have a </p>
<p>headquarters responsible for both 10th Division (Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan) and </p>
<p>14th Division (Basra). </p>

<p><b>786. </b> In addition, Lt Gen Rollo reported that Gen Petraeus had suggested:</p>
<p>“… political sensitivities over ground-holding responsibilities worked both ways, </p>
<p>and that Washington might also be sensitive to an apparent extension of US </p>
<p>responsibilities as allies departed … The debate therefore remains open.”</p>
<p><b>787. </b> Maj Gen Binns left MND(SE) on 12 February and was succeeded by </p>
<p>Major General Barney White-Spunner.</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>788. </b> Reflecting on the progress made during the previous six months in his last weekly </p>
<p>report, Maj Gen Binns commented:</p>
<p>“It has taken me six months to develop an understanding of the Economic and </p>
<p>Political Lines of Operation. I have learned to measure economic redevelopment </p>
<p>in decades, to be patient, to listen to, and take the advice of, specialists in the </p>
<p>PRT, some of whom have been in Iraq for more than three years. We should stop </p>
<p>beating up on DFID; those, like me initially, who talk of ‘windows of opportunity’ and </p>
<p>‘economic surges’ are misguided. Iraq is awash with money. The Iraqis need help in </p>
<p>spending it and overcoming corruption through good governance, which is exactly </p>
<p>the approach taken by our PRT. Of course we will continue to use CERPs money </p>
<p>to buy consent for military operations, but let us not pretend that this is sustainable </p>
<p>development, because on some occasions it is the reverse. In 10 years time </p>
<p>Basrawis will remember that the US Army Corps of Engineers built their Children’s </p>
<p>Cancer Hospital; they will probably have forgotten Operation SINBAD.”</p>
<p><b>789. </b> In his formal end of tour report, Maj Gen Binns wrote:</p>
<p>“The Consul General was hugely agile in getting politics moving and the PRT used </p>
<p>the headroom created by improvements to the security situation to re-engage … </p>
<p>Inter Departmental co-operation in theatre is superb …”</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Maj Gen Binns wrote that negotiations with JAM were “more successful than we </p>
<p>dared imagine”. Although JAM remained capable of renewing hostilities, there was now </p>
<p>“clear daylight” between the mainstream and the Iranian-backed cells. As a result of the </p>
<p>negotiations “we now talk of how to stay, not when to leave”. He judged that:</p>
<p>“The reconciliation process was dynamic, and our key interlocutor was prone </p>
<p>to inconsistency. The situation was complicated by the failure of some wholly to </p>
<p>appreciate that we were negotiating with a potentially unstable force. So trying </p>
<p>to apply reason to his argument and, in particular, to his negotiating position </p>
<p>imposed an unrealistic constraint on our freedom of negotiation. I found it hugely </p>
<p>frustrating that I was not trusted with delegated authority. By the time we worked up </p>

<p>two battlegroup equivalents and integral force protection, enabling and logistic support) </p>
<p>to complete withdrawal. </p>
<p><b>795. </b> Retaining 2,800 troops would require no increase to the US presence in Basra </p>
<p>and would meet what the UK understood to be the US aspirations for a UK contribution. </p>
<p>Mr Day judged that “in the absence of an entirely benign security environment, </p>
<p>1,000-1,500 is likely to be the minimum force level to support a national presence </p>
<p>in the COB”. Although it was assumed that at some stage the COB would be handed </p>
<p>over to the US, doing so would be “potentially destabilising”. </p>
<p><b>796. </b> On 13 February, the Iraqi Council of Representatives passed three major pieces of </p>
<p>legislation: the 2008 Budget Law, the Provincial Powers Law and the Amnesty Law.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> An </p>
<p>official in the FCO Iraq Group judged that:</p>
<p>“Passage of these long awaited laws is welcomed, not least because it should help </p>

<p>these issues are resolved it does represent a significant step which might boost </p>
<p>reconciliation efforts …”</p>
<p><b>797. </b> Mr Prentice commented that the political atmosphere in the run up to the votes was </p>
<p>“poisonous but gave way to relief and pride when all three Bills were passed and the </p>
<p>CoR went back on holiday”.</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>798. </b> The passing of the 2008 Budget (60 trillion Iraqi Dinars, then equivalent to </p>
<p>US$50bn) followed a protracted battle between a Dawa-led Arab nationalist faction </p>
<p>and the Kurdish alliance, in which the two main sticking points were the funding of the </p>
<p>Peshmerga and the Kurdish Regional Government’s (KRG) share of revenues. A further </p>
<p>postponement of a decision on funding the Peshmerga and agreement that the KRG </p>
<p>should retain its existing 17 percent revenue share, with a census conducted later in the </p>
<p>year, allowed the Budget to pass. </p>
<p><b>799. </b> Mr Miliband issued a statement welcoming the approval of the legislation, as “three </p>
<p>important and positive steps for Iraq” which would release “record resources for services </p>
<p>and reconstruction”, lay “the foundation for greater Sunni reintegration” and move Iraq </p>
<p>closer towards a new round of provincial elections.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p> The statement continued:</p>
<p>“There is now a clear desire on the part of Iraq’s political leaders to reach out to </p>
<p>each other in a spirit of compromise, and use the space created by the improved </p>
<p>security environment to make real progress on reconciliation. I hope this positive </p>
<p>atmosphere continues. Political reconciliation is key to Iraq’s development as a </p>
<p>secure and stable country.” </p>
<p><b>800. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group discussed “the strategy paper” again on 14 February.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr McDonald underlined that the paper was “too ambitious, not UK-centric enough, and </p>
<p>too long” and that it should not presume engagement beyond spring 2009. More work </p>
<p>was needed before it could be put to Ministers. It was agreed to split the paper into two: </p>
<p>one which dealt with the medium term (to spring 2009) and another dealing with the </p>
<p>longer term, including future legal arrangements. </p>
<p><b>801. </b> Those papers would be discussed again at the ISG and then by a Ministerial </p>
<p>trilateral meeting on 4 March and NSID(OD) in early April, which would also consider </p>
<p>force level options. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a mid-level option (between about 1,800 and 2,200); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>zero forces in southern Iraq.</p>
<p><b>803. </b> Lt Gen Wall told the ISG that any drawdown below a critical mass of 2,800 should </p>
<p>only be a short-term interim measure on the way to zero in order to reduce the period </p>
<p>of high vulnerability for personnel. From a military perspective, he observed that a </p>
<p>decision on post-November 2008 force levels did not need to be taken until the summer. </p>
<p>Mr McDonald acknowledged this, but also noted that the way ahead would need </p>
<p>to be clear by late March in order to inform Ministerial decisions on Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>804. </b> On 18 February, Lt Gen Rollo reported that the Provincial Powers Law set out the </p>
<p>balance between the central and provincial authorities that would apply following the </p>
<p>next provincial election.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“The key differences to the current arrangement are the strengthening of Governors’ </p>
<p>control over provincial security forces and the arrangements for dismissing a </p>
<p>Governor (making it easier for a Provincial Council to do so, but also giving the </p>
<p>Prime Minister and the Council of Representatives a potential role in the process). </p>
<p>Whether this will be sufficient to see off a push for greater federalism when the </p>
<p>Regions law takes effect in April remains to be seen.”</p>
<p><b>805. </b> The Provincial Powers Law directed that an Elections Law be passed within </p>
<p>90 days and provincial elections be held not later than 1 October. Lt Gen Rollo observed </p>
<p>that this would be “challenging” but that the UN’s view was that “the date should be </p>
<p>technically possible”.</p>
<p><b>806. </b> Lt Gen Rollo recorded that the Amnesty Law was likely to allow a significant </p>
<p>number of those convicted of less serious offences, or who had never been charged, </p>
<p>to be released from detention. Those convicted of serious crimes were excluded. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Rollo observed that the law was a “positive move”, though much would depend </p>
<p>on how it was administered, and in particular on the reintegration of former detainees.</p>
<p><b>807. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented it was: </p>
<p>“… difficult to overestimate the importance of this week’s political events. It commits </p>
<p>Iraq to provincial elections in the autumn, offering the prospect of bringing in both </p>
<p>Sunni and Shia groups who failed to vote in 2005, and decisively turning Iraq’s </p>
<p>struggle for power onto a political path. Conversely, it also offers the prospect of </p>
<p>increased instability if the armed wings of political parties compete to influence </p>
<p>results … These events are also, of course, the context for decisions on the timing </p>
<p>and pace of future troop drawdown.”</p>
<p><b>808. </b> Mr Miliband sent a personal message of congratulations to Speaker Mahmoud </p>
<p>Mashhadani of the Iraqi Council of Representatives, which was delivered in person by </p>

<p>Mr Prentice.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p> Mr Prentice reported that the Speaker had been grateful for the message, </p>
<p>as he had been for President Bush’s personal telephone call: it was encouraging that </p>
<p>friends of Iraq and the major powers paid close attention to developments in the Council </p>
<p>of Representatives and showed support for their achievements. </p>
<p><b>809. </b> Speaker Mashhadani told Mr Prentice that once the Council had returned from its </p>
<p>break there were three more key subjects to be addressed: oil, elections and Kirkuk. </p>
<p>Mr Prentice observed that “the next three political challenges are even more politically </p>
<p>charged than the last”. Implementing the three new laws was also “key” in the Speaker’s </p>
<p>eyes. For the Amnesty Law in particular there was “a real danger of heightened </p>
<p>expectations, particularly among the Sunni community, being let down by the limited </p>
<p>scope of the legislation”.</p>
<p><b>810. </b> On 15 February, the<i> Financial Times</i> published an article reporting the details of a </p>
<p>witness statement made by Mr Hilal al-Jedda.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p> Mr al-Jedda, a former British detainee, </p>
<p>was reported to have said that “British military officers agreed on a schedule to release </p>
<p>all detainees in return for a pledge by the militia to cease attacks on British forces”. The </p>
<p>article reported that the negotiations had involved Maj Gen Shaw and “members of a </p>
<p>Shia milita associated with the radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr’s Mahdi Army”. He also </p>
<p>reported that a Defence Advisory Notice (often referred to as a D-Notice) had been </p>
<p>issued, requesting that the identities of Iraqi negotiators and the reason why Mr al-Jedda </p>
<p>might have been privy to details of the talks should be withheld. </p>
<p><b>811. </b> On 17 February, Mr Adnan al-Asadi, the Iraqi Deputy Interior Minister, briefed </p>
<p>the MCNS that the Ministry of the Interior had formed a committee to look at issues </p>
<p>surrounding election security.</p>
<p>392</p>
<p> Protection of election materials, officials and offices </p>
<p>would be paramount, and MNF and MOD help would be required. He considered that </p>
<p>clashes were likely in the South.</p>
<p><b>812. </b> In his 21 February weekly report to Lt Gen Houghton, Maj Gen White-Spunner </p>
<p>concluded that “everyone, for the time being, is doing the right tasks and doing them </p>
<p>well” but that “we now need to think about the spring and summer very carefully … we </p>
<p>could, depending on whether or not Sadr continues his freeze, be in a more difficult </p>
<p>period here”.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that the increases in indirect fire reported by </p>

<p>my efforts, but I hope that this may prove to be a momentary aberration through </p>

<p><b>814. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary commented in the margins of Mr Browne’s </p>

<p>part of a military operation to deal with a terrorist threat to Turkey.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> The incident raised </p>
<p>tension between Turkey and Iraq and also placed a strain on the relationship between </p>
<p>the Kurdish Regional Government and the central Iraqi Government in Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>816. </b> On 23 February, Mr Prentice discussed the security situation in Basra with </p>
<p>Dr Rubaie, who confirmed that an order replacing Gen Mohan had already been signed </p>
<p>by Prime Minister Maliki based on a report that a “non-interference pact” had been </p>
<p>signed with JAM.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> Mr Prentice commented that the UK had some understanding of </p>
<p>the balance that Gen Mohan and Gen Jalil had to strike in handling the militias and </p>
<p>that “It was probably wise not to seek a confrontation with JAM, while the army and </p>
<p>police were still building their strength.” Dr Rubaie observed that there was a difference </p>
<p>between calming the situation and fearing to confront it.</p>
<p><b>817. </b> The day before the 26 February deadline for ratification of the three new laws by </p>

<p>have no role in dismissing Provincial Governors.</p>
<p>397</p>
<p> Mr Prentice wrote that if the veto was </p>

<p>“… the Law passes back to the CoR, which is in recess until c.18 March but unlikely </p>
<p>to do much until after the Kurdish New Year later in March. The CoR can then </p>

<p>398</p>
<p><b>819. </b> On the same day, the Chiefs of Staff were told by Lt Gen Houghton that:</p>
<p>“The increase in attacks in MND(SE), together with the uncertain future intelligence </p>
<p>picture meant that it might not be possible to make bold decisions with reference </p>
<p>to operational transition in Iraq. It was felt that some troop reductions would be </p>
<p>justifiable in terms of risk in order to demonstrate further progress and to ensure </p>
<p>the ISF continued to take increasing responsibility for security in MND(SE). Any </p>
<p>future troop reductions would have complex presentational aspects for UK … The </p>
<p>recommendations for future UK troop numbers in Iraq would be forwarded to COS </p>
<p>by 28 Feb 08.”</p>
<p>399</p>
<p><b>820. </b> Lt Gen Houghton told the Chiefs of Staff that Prime Minister Maliki had become </p>
<p>increasingly concerned about General Mohan’s “accommodations” with JAM elements </p>
<p>in Basra. From a UK perspective, Lt Gen Houghton hoped that Gen Mohan would not </p>
<p>be transferred from Basra, where he was “a known quantity” and was understood to be </p>
<p>making use of the extended JAM freeze to isolate and eliminate the JAM Special Groups </p>
<p>and splinter groups.</p>
<p><b>821. </b> At PJHQ’s request, on 27 February the JIC examined the prospects for security, </p>
<p>political, and economic stability across southern Iraq during 2008.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>“I. Mutually reinforcing factors are helping to keep attacks against the Multi-National </p>
<p>Forces (MNF) in MND(SE) at a low level [JAM1] remains active in preserving </p>
<p>a cease-fire – though his influence may be reducing. Work by Basra’s Security </p>
<p>Co-ordinator and Provincial Director of Police, and the continuation of Muqtada </p>
<p>al-Sadr’s ‘freeze’ on JAM activity are also key. The situation is fragile and could </p>
<p>quickly deteriorate.</p>
<p>“II. Iran’s attitude to anti-MNF-violence in Iraq is linked to its wider national agenda, </p>
<p>particularly its relationship with the US. A more aggressive US posture in the South </p>
<p>might prompt the IRGC QF to sponsor more anti-MNF attacks in response. Iran will </p>
<p>continue its efforts to build political and economic influence and defuse intra-Shia </p>
<p>rivalries in southern Iraq, driven by a desire to ensure that its influence pervades </p>
<p>Shia politics more widely.</p>
<p>“III. Intra-Shia clashes will intensify as provincial elections approach. Assassinations </p>
<p>of politicians and violent intimidation of the electorate are likely. In the worst case, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>there could be outbreaks of street fighting on a large scale … Delays to the elections </p>
<p>might also provoke violence and civil unrest.</p>
<p>“IV. Economic initiatives such as job creation schemes and reconstruction projects </p>
<p>have the potential to reinforce Iraq’s security gains and promote reconciliation. But </p>
<p>there is little prospect of change in the South in 2008. Perceptions that conditions </p>
<p>are not improving fast enough could erode popular consent for local and national </p>
<p>authority.</p>
<p>“V. The Iraqi security forces’ (ISF) ability and willingness to maintain security in the </p>
<p>south remains patchy and dependent on MNF training, logistic and specialist air </p>
<p>support. Radical improvements in police effectiveness are unlikely. The army will </p>
<p>remain at the forefront in providing security … The Iraqis would only call for MNF </p>
<p>troop re-intervention as a last resort.</p>
<p>“VI. Violent criminality, murders, kidnappings, score-settling and intimidation will </p>
<p>remain part of life in southern Iraq. Pressure from national Shia political and religious </p>
<p>leaders … may limit the scope of unrest. But local ISF action, accommodations </p>
<p>between the ISF and elements of JAM, and the perception of MNF willingness to </p>
<p>intervene will also remain crucial tools for managing instability.”</p>
<p><b>822. </b> The JIC reported that although reliable data for attacks against non-MNF targets </p>
<p>was lacking, in Basra City alone there had been about 80 murders and 40 kidnappings. </p>
<p>Accounts in the media suggested that Shia milita were increasingly punishing and </p>
<p>sometimes killing women for “contravening strict interpretations of Islamic mores”. </p>
<p>Around 10 women were reportedly murdered each month in Basra City. </p>
<p><b>823. </b> Mr Brown discussed Iraq with President Bush on 28 February and observed that </p>

<p><b>825. </b> Mr Brown explained that the UK would “in time” be reviewing troop numbers, but </p>
<p>would await the next report by Gen Petraeus in April before taking decisions.</p>
<p><b>826. </b> In his weekly report on 29 February, Maj Gen White-Spunner considered that </p>
<p>the impact of an extension to the freeze on JAM operations was likely to be a further </p>
<p>splintering of JAM.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p> There were reports of a new hardline commander of JAM in Basra, </p>
<p>who was expected to take an aggressive stance towards confronting the ISF, though he </p>

<p><b>827. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary commented that this “presumably shows that JAM </p>
<p>want the South for themselves and see us as yesterday’s news and the ISF as the real </p>
<p>threat to their hegemony”.</p>
<p>403</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that at the MNF-I Commanders Conference on </p>
<p>23 February, Gen Petraeus had been upbeat about progress across Iraq.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> While Mosul </p>
<p>and the North remained the focus, combating Shia militias and Iranian influence were </p>
<p>the long-term challenges. For MND(SE), this would mean an increase in US attention on </p>
<p>the South, particularly the borders with Iran in Maysan.</p>
<p><b>829. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that US planning for drawdown was progressing </p>
<p>at great speed, and the redrawing of command boundaries would form part of this </p>
<p>work. While he believed that the US and UK were “thinking the same on Dhi Qar and </p>
<p>Muthanna” it would be important to engage the US soon in relation to Maysan if the UK </p>
<p>considered that the right approach view was to focus its effort on Basra alone.</p>
<p><b>March 2008</b></p>
<p><b>830. </b> In his 3 March weekly report, Lt Gen Rollo wrote that he sensed MNF and Iraqi </p>
<p>eyes were increasingly turning to the South and Basra.</p>
<p>405</p>
<p> It was important for the UK to </p>
<p>understand the implications for future UK responsibilities there and to “force the pace so </p>
<p>that we can more accurately gauge our own contribution to it”. The size of the area for </p>
<p>which the UK would be militarily responsible remained a key issue. </p>
<p><b>831. </b> A second key issue was “what we do while we are there”. Lt Gen Rollo saw two </p>
<p>aspects: the scale of the contribution and the relationship with the UK’s Iraqi partners. </p>
<p>On the scale of contribution he wrote:</p>
<p>“From a Baghdad perspective I have only three points. The first is that the force </p>
<p>structure should be able to carry out the tasks agreed between CJO and General </p>
<p>Petraeus. The second is that the continued use of force level reductions as the </p>
<p>principal metric of success seems increasingly at odds with the reality of Iraq today. </p>
<p>The third is that our willingness and ability to deliver genuine non-military effect will </p>
<p>also be a factor in US thinking …</p>
<p>“For most of the last four years, Basra has been, understandably, an economy of </p>
<p>force operation. However, with the Iraq Strategy nearing completion, I hope that it </p>
<p>will look at our plans for 2008/09 in the context of the wider campaign. I have no </p>
<p>doubt that our longer term military focus ought to be on a BMATT [British Military </p>
<p>Advisory and Training Team] … but in the short term we need to get Basra right. If </p>
<p>there is unfinished business in Basra, and there is, it is clearly Iraqi business to do </p>

<p>continue to require and want our help seems the only sensible course of action.”</p>
<p><b>832. </b> Maj Gen Rollo also reported that Gen Mohan had visited Baghdad in early March </p>
<p>to present his security strategy for Basra to Ministers and to Gen Petraeus. Gen </p>
<p>Petraeus had established a committee, chaired by the commander of MNSTC-I, to look </p>
<p>at how this plan might best be supported by MNF. Lt Gen Rollo commented that it would </p>
<p>continue to be in the UK’s interests to support Gen Mohan or his successor. </p>

<p><b>834. </b> Lt Gen Rollo commented that, in the short term, the visit had presented another </p>
<p>handling challenge for Prime Minister Maliki as Iranian training and funding of terrorist </p>
<p>groups was widely known and resented, particularly by the Sunni community.</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> The visit </p>
<p>resulted in seven co-operation agreements between Iran and Iraq on trade, transport, </p>

<p> Officials reported </p>
<p>the following day that Maj Gen White-Spunner had raised the issue with Gen Petraeus, </p>
<p>explaining that the UK had difficulty with JAM1’s detention, to which Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>replied “Release him now.”</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Lt Gen Houghton briefed the Chiefs of Staff on 4 March that an Iraqi Vice President </p>
<p>had vetoed the Provincial Powers Law “on constitutional grounds” and that “the </p>

<p><b>837. </b> Reporting on the detail of General Mohan’s security strategy on 6 March, </p>
<p>Maj Gen White-Spunner commented that although MND(SE) supported the bid for </p>
<p>extra resources for Basra in order to “over face” JAM:</p>
<p>“We would not support Mohan developing this strategy into the prosecution of a </p>
<p>major urban battle for which he would need more IA troops than are likely to be </p>

<p>extension of the JAM cease-fire was positive while it lasted, but provincial elections were </p>
<p>essential. Training of the Iraqi Navy would take at least until 2010.</p>
<p><b>839. </b> On 7 March, Mr Day provided advice to Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary </p>
<p>on media handling of the “accommodation” with JAM, specifically whether the MOD </p>
<p>should brief the media proactively.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p> He explained that the advice had been requested </p>
<p>by Mr Browne following a <i>Financial Times</i> article in February. </p>
<p><b>840. </b> Mr Day recommended that Mr Browne should agree that the concerns of PJHQ </p>
<p>and others were “sufficiently compelling” to justify maintaining “our present defensive </p>
<p>posture on this issue”.</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Mr Day wrote that there was a risk that further details of the story would emerge </p>
<p>and suggested that the advantage of a proactive briefing would be to allow the UK:</p>
<p>“… to explain the rationale and benefits to the UK of the accommodation and set </p>
<p>out the facts of the case accurately rather than allowing stories based on between-</p>
<p>cell whispers to stand unchallenged. Most journalists regard the basic principle of </p>
<p>reconciliation as nothing new and any ‘deal’ that has been struck as a sensible step.”</p>
<p><b>842. </b> On the other hand, there was a concern about the risk to JAM1 personally, and </p>
<p>“that disclosure would pose a risk to the accommodation itself, including the political </p>
<p>process in Basra, and could lead to increased IDF attacks”. They were therefore </p>
<p>opposed to “proactive briefing of any kind in current circumstances”:</p>
<p>“Presentationally, there is a risk that the recent rise in IDF attacks on the COB, and </p>
<p>last weekend’s fatality, would call into question the long-term benefit to the UK of </p>
<p>the accommodation, and generate unhelpful debate over the partial truce at a time </p>
<p>when the political situation in Basra remains finely balanced … It is also possible, </p>
<p>given that we invoked DA [Defence Advisory] Notice procedures with the FT, that we </p>
<p>could be accused of publicising those details that suit us while suppressing those </p>
<p>that do not.”</p>
<p><b>843. </b> Mr Day concluded: </p>
<p>“It will come out in more detail eventually, and we will need at that stage to put </p>
<p>our case quickly and strongly. I have asked PJHQ and DJC [Directorate of Joint </p>
<p>Commitments] to review our lines accordingly. SofS may also wish to consider </p>
<p>briefing the Opposition on Privy Council terms.”</p>
<p><b>844. </b> Lieutenant General Lloyd Austin, who had succeeded Lt Gen Odierno as </p>

<p>338</p>
<p><b>845. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner observed that Gen Mohan had “laid it on thick </p>
<p>when he presented his plan in Baghdad, so I had to explain to Lt Gen Austin that </p>
<p>Mohan was feeding an Iraqi political demand when he talked about the forthcoming </p>
<p>‘battle for Basra’.” </p>
<p><b>846. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner explained that MND(SE)’s objective was to assist in </p>
<p>building up the Iraqi Army so that they could win a psychological and political battle </p>
<p>without the need for violence. Lt Gen Austin was reported to be reassured and said that </p>
<p>he did not have the troops to open up a second front in the South while still dealing with </p>
<p>the North.</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Lt Gen Rollo discussed the US SOFA plans with Ambassador Satterfield on </p>
<p>9 March.</p>
<p>414</p>
<p> He reported that the US had shared drafts of the Strategic Framework </p>
<p>Agreement/Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi Government and, as a result, </p>
<p>recognised that compromises would be needed. Drafts would be shown to the UK the </p>
<p>following week, and the UK would be consulted on emerging US thinking on possible </p>
<p>compromises, although Ambassador Satterfield recognised that the UK had not yet </p>
<p>settled its legal position “and he observed that that would be driven by our political </p>
<p>position”. </p>
<p><b>848. </b> On 11 March, Lt Gen Houghton briefed the Chiefs of Staff that Gen Mohan’s plan:</p>
<p>“… included three phases, with the first (preparation) involving the building of further </p>
<p>ISF capability in terms of personnel numbers and equipment in Basra. Phase 2 </p>
<p>(disarmament) would require PM to declare Basra as a ‘weapons free zone’ with </p>
<p>incentives being provided for a voluntary handover of weapons: this phase would </p>
<p>have a specific end date (possibly 1 June 08) after which Phase 3 (confrontation) </p>
<p>would be entered. Phase 3 would consist of search and strike missions aimed at </p>
<p>confronting those who were not reconciled.”</p>

<p><b>849. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Iraq from 14 to 17 March, travelling to both Baghdad and </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> ACM Stirrup underlined to Maj Gen Binns, that “both a fully functioning </p>
<p>airport and a capable and credible 14 (IA) Div [14th Division of the Iraqi Army] were </p>
<p>pre-requisites for a UK withdrawal”. They agreed that both were achievable by </p>
<p>the end of 2008.</p>
<p><b>850. </b> ACM Stirrup and Mr Jones agreed that “the continuing military presence in the </p>
<p>COB would hinder local economic development and perpetuate attacks”. In discussion </p>
<p>with senior members of the US military, ACM Stirrup “noted with disquiet the current US </p>
<p>plan earmarks the UK remaining in Tactical Overwatch in perpetuity”. This expectation </p>
<p>would need to be “realigned and managed as potentially divergent UK plans unfold”. </p>

<p><b>851. </b> Reporting on the visit, Lt Gen Rollo recorded that Gen Petraeus confirmed that </p>
<p>he had given direction that the MND boundaries should remain as they were, and </p>
<p>made clear that he had no difficulty with a US brigade coming under the command </p>
<p>of MND(SE).</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>852. </b> In Basra, ACM Stirrup and Gen Petraeus had agreed that once Gen Mohan had </p>
<p>committed to his plan “he must not be allowed to fail”.</p>
<p><b>853. </b> Lt Gen Rollo observed that, “2009 was barely discussed in any of the discussions </p>
<p>over the last week”. He continued:</p>
<p>“… it is becoming increasingly apparent to me that there are risks in not taking </p>
<p>decisions … on our posture in Basra. Quite apart from the potential to confuse our </p>
<p>allies, getting things done in Iraq requires commitment, which is harder to deliver </p>
<p>in an atmosphere of unsettling uncertainty. There remains plenty to do. So while I </p>
<p>accept that it might be necessary to defer decisions for a while, the opportunity cost </p>
<p>of that approach needs to be clearly understood.”</p>
<p><b>854. </b> In mid-March, Mr Browne visited Iraq with Mr Wareing.</p>
<p>418</p>
<p> After returning to the UK, </p>
<p>Mr Browne wrote that:</p>
<p>“The overall mood in Iraq is optimistic, reflecting the improved security situation, </p>
<p>political progress and the new focus on economic regeneration to which Michael </p>
<p>[Wareing] is contributing. Inevitably in Iraq, the pace of change is lower than we </p>
<p>would wish and no-one believes it is irreversible, but we have an opportunity over </p>
<p>the next year or so to contribute to a step-change in the country’s economy and </p>
<p>to put our bilateral relationship onto a sustainable long-term footing. That does, </p>
<p>however, mean we need to redouble our efforts now … to exploit the progress we </p>
<p>have already made.”</p>
<p><b>855. </b> Mr Browne reported that Gen Mohan’s plans to “confront and face down Basra’s </p>
<p>militia later in the year” were supported by the Iraqi Government and Gen Petraeus. The </p>
<p>visit had also confirmed Mr Browne’s view that “the rate of reduction [of troop numbers] </p>
<p>should be slower than we envisaged last autumn, to deal with current threats and to </p>
<p>support this [sic] Iraqis through until after the elections”.</p>
<p><b>856. </b> In Baghdad, Mr Browne judged the main focus of activity to be negotiation of the </p>
<p>Long Term Security Agreement. He observed:</p>
<p>“Given our different legal systems, the LTSA may not be sufficient for our </p>
<p>requirements and, despite our best efforts, the US chose to table their draft with the </p>
<p>Iraqis before discussing it with us … I intend to send a team of our own to Baghdad </p>

<p><b>857. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported on 20 March that Basra had been “quite </p>
<p>tense” that week, with “spasmodic violence between the ISF and JAM, including </p>
<p>the assassination of senior police officers”.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> He considered that JAM knew that </p>
<p>Gen Mohan’s plan was gaining acceptance, and might be starting to act while </p>
<p>they felt they still had the initiative. MND(SE) was focusing its efforts on developing </p>
<p>Gen Mohan’s plans with him and “ensuring they are workable, not unduly kinetic”. </p>
<p><b>858. </b> Brigadier Julian Free, Commander of the 4th</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mechanised Brigade and Deputy </p>
<p>Commander Operations, attended the first meeting of the joint MNF/Iraqi Government </p>
<p>committee in Baghdad that was considering how best to support Gen Mohan’s security </p>
<p>plan for Basra. Maj Gen White-Spunner described it as “a useful first meeting that has </p>
<p>set the parameters and identified who was responsible for informing the key decisions </p>
<p>that would determine how fast General Mohan’s plan can be enacted”. </p>
<p><b>859. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that he had briefed Gen Keane in similar terms </p>
<p>as Lt Gen Austin when he visited on 17 March, “emphasising that we believe General </p>
<p>Mohan does not want to open up a major kinetic front in Basra”.</p>
<p><b>860. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that Prime Minister Maliki had been:</p>
<p>“… hearing exaggerated reports in early 2008 about the deterioration in local </p>
<p>security. There were some assassinations of people of consequence to him … if he </p>
<p>had a long-term vision it was that his political pitch in any national elections would </p>
<p>have to be based on him having asserted the strong hand of government.”</p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>861. </b> As a result, Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that when Prime Minister Maliki was briefed </p>
<p>on Gen Mohan’s plan “he said ‘it’s too slow, too late’” as he “clearly wanted to have </p>
<p>asserted his authority across the South in time for the provincial elections”.</p>
<p>421</p>
<p><b>862. </b> Lieutenant General John Cooper, who had succeeded Lt Gen Rollo as SBMR-I </p>
<p>on 23 March, reported two days into his tour that:</p>
<p>“The week’s most notable development … has been Prime Minister Maliki’s trip </p>
<p>down to Basra and his apparent replacement of Mohan as the commander of Basra </p>
<p>Operations Command. Exactly what prompted this remains subject to speculation. </p>
<p>I am told Maliki has for some time had concerns about … [the Basra ISF’s] alleged </p>

<p>“Even on Friday evening when I listened to Mohan brief his Basra plan to Petraeus </p>
<p>and Iraqi Ministers and senior officers, it was assumed that he would be the one </p>
<p>to implement it … By Saturday, however, Maliki was suggesting that the situation </p>
<p>in Basra had degenerated to such an extent that he would need to go there with </p>
<p>additional forces; by MCNS on Sunday he was talking of taking two IA battalions … </p>
<p>and a brigade of National Police … with him. In the margins of the meeting it was </p>
<p>being suggested that Major General Aziz (Deputy Commander of 11th IA Div) would </p>
<p>replace Mohan …”</p>

<p><b>863. </b> Lt Gen Cooper also reported that Vice President Mehdi lifted his veto of </p>
<p>the Provincial Powers Law following “considerable US pressure, including from </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney”. </p>
<p><b>864. </b> Government officials working closely with the military reported on 24 March that </p>
<p>the OMS was considering breaking off the truce in Basra in 24 hours’ time as a reaction </p>
<p>to Prime Minister Maliki’s presence in Basra.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p><b>865. </b> On Tuesday 25 March, Prime Minister Maliki began his operation in Basra.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p><b>866. </b> It triggered heavy fighting between the ISF and militias in Basra and outbreaks of </p>
<p>violence elsewhere in Iraq.</p>
<p>425</p>
<p><b>867. </b> On Wednesday 26 March, Prime Minister Maliki offered the militias a 72-hour </p>

<p>By the following day, the UK assessed that there had been almost no take-up.</p>
<p><b>868. </b> Mr Prentice reported to the FCO in London on 27 March that Ambassador Crocker </p>

<p>342</p>
<p><b>870. </b> In a speech at the National Museum of the US Air Force in Ohio on 27 March, </p>
<p>President Bush said:</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Maliki’s bold decision – and it was a bold decision – to go after the </p>
<p>illegal groups in Basra shows his leadership, and his commitment to enforce the law </p>
<p>in an even-handed manner.”</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>871. </b> On 27 March, Brig Free reported to Lt Gen Houghton on an “unexpectedly busy </p>
<p>week” in Basra.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> Gen Mohan had returned to Baghdad to present his three-phase </p>
<p>security plan for Basra to the Basra Planning Conference, chaired by Dr Rubaie and </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus, on 22 March. The following day, the plan was presented to Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki at the MCNS, and he decided, “based on a separate assessment of the security </p>
<p>situation, that pre-emptive action was necessary and directed that additional troops </p>
<p>should deploy to Basra immediately”. </p>
<p><b>872. </b> Lt Gen Cooper told the Inquiry that Prime Minister Maliki “got up and flew to Basra </p>
<p>the next day, and then Charge of the Knights emerged”.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p><b>873. </b> Mr Prentice reported that Prime Minister Maliki was taking a “tough line” with the </p>
<p>Sadrists, refusing to speak directly to Muqtada al-Sadr and delegating contact to his </p>
<p>advisers.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> The Iraqi Government’s message to the Sadrists was:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Surrender weapons (within 72 hours).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Step aside and allow the ISF to take out/arrest the ‘outlaws’/Special Groups.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Respect the law and stick to politics.”</p>
<p><b>874. </b> Mr Prentice reported that “so far, the Sadrist response has been uncompromising”. </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr had demanded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ISF stop all operations against JAM in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those detained so far should be released;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki leave Basra to meet him; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an apology be issued for the Basra operation.</p>

<p>Iraqi authorities had entered into discussions with the militia groups but Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki was reportedly “determined not to do a deal”. </p>
<p><b>878. </b> Reports suggested that the majority of the local population supported the efforts </p>
<p>by the Iraqi Government to assert its authority over the city, although “it remains to be </p>
<p>seen how long this will endure if the fighting continues”. The two particular areas of </p>
<p>concern for MND(SE) were the announcement by the UN Refugee Agency that it was </p>
<p>suspending activities in southern Iraq; and secondly, the fact that the number of locally </p>
<p>employed civilian staff turning up to work at Basra Air Station had, understandably, been </p>
<p>reduced dramatically.</p>
<p><b>879. </b> The briefing note reported that the UK had “given considerable support to the </p>
<p>Iraqis” including air support, food, medical and logistical support. But “kinetic” support </p>
<p>had “necessarily been limited on occasion as requests have fallen beyond what our </p>
<p>rules of engagement allow”. The Iraqis were reported to be frustrated at this “lukewarm” </p>
<p>support, and the US was concerned:</p>
<p>“General Petraeus is reportedly of the view that the UK has not been sufficiently </p>
<p>positive in supporting the Iraqi operation in the media. Moreover, it has also been </p>
<p>reported that Washington has been briefed that the UK has refused to provide </p>
<p>ground support of the Iraqis (when as far as we can judge the only two requests </p>
<p>for such support were rejected by General Austin). We believe this perception has </p>
<p>largely been corrected, but the fact that it seems to have got to a very high level in </p>
<p>the US system very quickly perhaps reflects the degree of concern in the US system </p>
<p>at the way events are unfolding.”</p>

<p><b>881. </b> Lt Gen Austin asked him to sit out of the meeting “as things were a little sensitive </p>
<p>between the PM [Maliki] and the UK”. Brig Free was clear that that was the right call: </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki had made it “abundantly clear that he will not meet with a British </p>
<p>officer … he sees us as responsible for releasing the very criminals responsible for </p>
<p>destabilising Basra, the ones he is now having to deal with”. </p>
<p><b>882. </b> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary gave him an update on developments on 28 March, </p>
<p>reporting that neither side had yet achieved a decisive advantage and it was looking </p>
<p>increasingly likely that a stalemate would develop.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> The deadline for Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki’s disarmament ultimatum had been extended to 8 April, but the best outcome was </p>
<p>likely to be “some form of fudge through which both sides can claim victory”. Publicly, </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki remained committed to defeating JAM. </p>
<p><b>883. </b> The Private Secretary told Mr Brown that the next step was for him to speak to </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki “to register our concern at lack of consultation in advance of the </p>
<p>operation; and to offer further UK assistance”. Mr Browne would update Parliament </p>
<p>following the outcome of NSID’s discussion of troop levels. </p>
<p><b>884. </b> A report from the British Embassy Office Basra on 28 March suggested that </p>
<p>“the current assessment is that the fighting is likely to be protracted”.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> The perception </p>
<p>remained that the operation was targeted against JAM in general and not the criminal </p>
<p>elements, which was “causing militia groups and Basra JAM to unite”. </p>
<p><b>885. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner returned to Basra on Friday 28 March and spoke by </p>
<p>telephone to Governor Waili who reported that he had been present at a meeting that </p>
<p>included Prime Minister Maliki and OMS representatives.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> Prime Minister Maliki had </p>
<p>been persuaded to attend only on the basis that “he would not negotiate but only listen </p>
<p>to what OMS had to say”. OMS agreed to consider the Iraqi Government’s suggestions </p>
<p>that militia should hand over medium/heavy weapons and that senior leaders should </p>
<p>hand themselves in. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> Prime Minister Maliki made a statement on Iraqi television on 29 March. He said </p>
<p>that he was trying to build a state governed by law and order and accused ex-Ba’athists </p>
<p>and people with “influences from across the border” of not wishing stability for Iraq. He </p>
<p>said that he had come to Basra to remove “gangs and thugs” – as long as such people </p>
<p>were around there could be no future – and reiterated his intention to stay in Basra “until </p>
<p>all had subjected themselves to the rule of law”.</p>
<p><b>887. </b> There were reports in the Iraqi media that more than 100 police officers had been </p>

<p><b>888. </b> By 1300 on 29 March, the Director of Joint Commitments (DJC) reported to </p>
<p>Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary that he considered “little tangible success has </p>
<p>been achieved by either side, and sustained conflict looks set to continue”.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> There had </p>
<p>been a 24-hour relative lull in activity, possibly due to Friday prayers and a pause in </p>
<p>ISF operations. </p>
<p><b>889. </b> The DJC’s report said that a Deputy Commanding General of MNC-I, plus a </p>
<p>Command and Control cell, planners, analytical support and intelligence capability had </p>
<p>arrived at the COB, from which seven US Apache helicopters were also operating. </p>
<p>More US forces, including a tactical HQ and an infantry company were on their way and </p>
<p>US Central Command had “instructed planning to examine the feasibility of diverting </p>
<p>additional US troops to MND(SE) should there be a requirement”.</p>
<p><b>890. </b> MND(SE)’s planning “focused on the requirement for UK military effort to enhance </p>
<p>the capacity of the ISF, whilst attempting to provide a ‘Bridging Concept’ for Basra </p>
<p>from the current confrontation to the Mohan’s [sic] original, more-considered Basra </p>
<p>Security Plan.” </p>
<p><b>891. </b> On 29 March, Mr Prentice reported that, in an emergency meeting of the </p>
<p>Executive Steering Committee (ESC) (usually focused on supporting Fardh al-Qanoon), </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus described the situation in Basra as “confused and quite difficult”.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>military objectives that the Iraqi Government had set itself were more expansive than the </p>
<p>MNF had expected and Gen Petraeus warned that they “would not be able to achieve </p>
<p>their wider publicly stated objectives of gaining total control of Basra”.</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Mr Prentice reported that Ambassador Crocker had described Basra to the ESC </p>
<p>as critical for the Iraqi Government and for the future of Iraq: it was important that all </p>
<p>Iraqis came together. He also raised the idea of an “economic initiative for Basra”. The </p>
<p>proposal, as Mr Prentice understood it, was less of an economic initiative and more a </p>
<p>disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration exercise. Mr Prentice reported that DFID </p>
<p>had some concerns about the proposals and he could not see how it would be feasible </p>
<p>in the absence of a political settlement in Basra. He commented:</p>
<p>“If the idea becomes unstoppable, some obvious challenges to implementing it </p>
<p>successfully will be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring Basra has the capacity to manage this level of resources …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>managing the fiduciary risk, and trying to ensure the scheme achieves long </p>
<p>term impact and sustainability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring that the initiative adheres to the ‘do no harm’ principle, </p>
<p>safeguarding the advances made in provincial authority planning and </p>
<p>delivery capacity.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>893. </b> In the margins of the ESC, Mr Prentice spoke to Dr Rubaie who told him that </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki “had been led by others around him into an exaggerated sense of </p>
<p>the urgency and a radical underestimation of the challenges” in Basra.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>894. </b> In response to an email providing an account of discussions in the margins of the </p>
<p>ESC, Mr Brown commented early on the morning of 30 March:</p>
<p>“Need to be clear of</p>
<p>(a)  build up of local military and police strength – how big is it and how will it </p>
<p>grow?</p>
<p>(b)  conditions in which we would intervene.”</p>
<p>440</p>
<p><b>895. </b> Mr Brown’s Private Secretary replied that “a kinetic action would be triggered by </p>
<p>a request from the Iraqis or Petraeus. Commanders on the ground have delegated </p>
<p>authority to take realtime decisions”.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> The most likely scenario would be for UK forces </p>
<p>to support Iraqi units with a Quick Reaction Force, which ACM Stirrup had authorised for </p>
<p>use if needed. The Private Secretary undertook to pass on to Mr Browne the message </p>
<p>that there should be no specific announcements about UK troop numbers, given the </p>
<p>current situation in Basra. </p>
<p><b>896. </b> The same Private Secretary provided a further update on the situation in Basra to </p>
<p>Mr Brown later that morning.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>897. </b> In response, Mr Brown asked the Private Secretary to “summarise options now </p>
<p>available to us”.</p>
<p>443</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>898. </b> The Private Secretary replied, “the short version is that our options are limited” and </p>
<p>commented that Mr Miliband and Mr Browne were likely to conclude:</p>
<p>“… that it makes it more important that we accelerate drawdown of UK troops once </p>
<p>we are through the current crisis. The challenge for the next month is to judge how </p>
<p>to pitch this to Bush, how to create the conditions to show that it is from a position </p>
<p>of strength, and how to manage the presentation in a way that does not make the </p>
<p>wider US effort more difficult.”</p>
<p>444</p>
<p><b>899. </b> On Sunday 30 March, the British Embassy Office Basra reported that the overall </p>
<p>situation in Basra was unchanged.</p>
<p>445</p>
<p> Neither the militia nor the ISF had made gains but </p>
<p>“ISF continue to show no sign of coherent planning, and troop morale remains low”. </p>

<p>347</p>
<p><b>900. </b> The following day, the British Embassy Baghdad reported that Muqtada al-Sadr </p>
<p>had issued a statement calling for a cease-fire, which:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>called for an end to armed demonstrations and to “illegal arrests” and for the </p>
<p>return of those who were displaced because of the violence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>appealed to the Iraqi Government to give a general pardon to and to release all </p>
<p>those held in detention, particularly those from the Sadrist Trend;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disowned all who owned weapons and used them to target government </p>
<p>buildings and institutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirmed that the Sadrist Trend did not possess heavy weapons; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>made a commitment to co-operation with the Iraqi Government and institutions </p>
<p>in establishing law and order and working to restore public services.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p><b>901. </b> The Embassy reported that the Iraqi Government had welcomed al-Sadr’s </p>
<p>statement and reiterated that it was not attacking any specific group or party, but only </p>
<p>those who were breaking the law. Prime Minister Maliki had told Dr Rubaie that he </p>
<p>intended to remain in Basra for a further two or three days to complete “cleansing </p>
<p>operations” there. There would be two further unspecified security operations: </p>
<p>one in a port area and the other in a district in Basra. </p>
<p><b>902. </b> Questions were asked at the MCNS meeting that evening about the reports </p>
<p>of police desertions in Baghdad and allegations of poor co-operation between the </p>
<p>police and army. The representative of the Ministry of Interior told the Council that </p>
<p>“only 10 percent of the national Police had proven ineffective” and that more than </p>
<p>400 police had been dismissed in Basra in recent days for “disloyalty”.</p>
<p><b>903. </b> Mr Prentice commented to the FCO:</p>
<p>“If the JAM cease-fire proves to be real, the GoI will need to move quickly in lifting </p>
<p>the curfew and returning life … [in] Baghdad … to normal asap … The response of </p>
<p>the Special Groups to both MaS’ [Muqtada al-Sadr’s] public cease-fire and Iran’s </p>
<p>encouragement for some kind of truce, will be important in allowing normality to </p>
<p>return quickly … There is still a long way to go in Basra, both in shaping a workable </p>
<p>military plan and framing the political settlement.”</p>
<p><b>904. </b> In a telegram to London issued late on 30 March, Mr Prentice considered the </p>
<p>possible outcomes to the situation in Basra, their likely result and options for the UK’s </p>
<p>response.</p>
<p>447</p>
<p> In his view, the worst case scenario would involve the ISF collapsing in </p>
<p>Basra and the MNF being forced to come to their assistance. JAM would see this as a </p>
<p>victory and Prime Minister Maliki’s credibility would be damaged. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>905. </b> In the best case scenario, the ISF would be able to achieve its military and security </p>
<p>objectives in Basra (possibly with MNF help), allowing Prime Minister Maliki to return to </p>
<p>Baghdad with a “success” and able to act in a way that was seen by others (particularly </p>
<p>the Sunni) as inclusive. </p>
<p><b>906. </b> Mr Prentice thought that neither of these extreme scenarios was likely – and the </p>
<p>most likely outcome would be something in between. He continued:</p>
<p>“The new Iraq has survived since 2003 through expediency. Their politicians and </p>
<p>criminals are all capable of moving from violence to dialogue and back again with </p>
<p>little pause. In this case, despite Maliki’s … rhetoric about fighting JAM to the bitter </p>
<p>end, there will be a limit to Shia tolerance for such internecine strife. Already … a </p>
<p>compromise seems to be emerging.</p>
<p>“Other politicians have had a major scare and, including even the Sadrist </p>
<p>mainstream, will have had an object lesson in why all factions need to put aside </p>
<p>their criminal wings. The tectonic plates of central Iraqi politics have shifted and all </p>
<p>factions are assessing the opportunities they may have after the immediate security </p>
<p>crisis passes. Until now, Maliki has not been aware of the weakness of his position. </p>
<p>The rude awakening … which he will receive on return to Baghdad may prompt </p>
<p>him to be more inclusive (and therefore more successful) as PM. There is also a </p>
<p>real possibility that the UIA will splinter as a result of the pressure his operation has </p>
<p>produced and as elections approach across the South. It is too early to draw up the </p>
<p>order of winners and losers but the prospect is of complex politicking and a range of </p>
<p>pragmatic compromises.</p>
<p>“We should hope that Sadrist and other politicians will see opportunity in exploiting </p>
<p>the aftermath to return to government. In the case of the Sadrists, this will require </p>
<p>them getting the message convincingly from other factions that they recognise </p>
<p>Sadrism as an essential constituent of Iraqi politics. To achieve this, the compromise </p>
<p>yet to be worked out over Basra will have to have some plausible element of </p>
<p>discipline by the Sadrists on their violent fringe. The compromise cannot be a thinly </p>
<p>disguised climb-down in the face of JAM violence.”</p>
<p><b>907. </b> Considering how the UK could best support the outcome, Mr Prentice suggested </p>
<p>that the main areas for UK activity should be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging Prime Minister Maliki to “draw the right lessons”, seeking to </p>
<p>persuade him that (contrary to his historic suspicions about the UK) the UK had </p>
<p>always supported him and wanted to “put this chapter behind us”; helping him </p>
<p>realise that he had been the victim of “catastrophic advice and false intelligence” </p>
<p>which nearly led to his humiliation; and persuading him that the success of his </p>
<p>government required dismissal of those responsible;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging the Iraqi Government to act against all militias, not just JAM;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>emphasising to the Sadrists that a choice finally had to be made between </p>
<p>building state institutions and pursuing factional influence through criminality;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to underline with political contacts the importance of supporting </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuading the US to temper their public message to avoid giving fuel to the </p>
<p>Sadrists’ public accusations that Prime Minister Maliki was a US lackey.</p>
<p><b>908. </b> Mr Prentice concluded:</p>
<p>“Despite the fevered talk … that the State is in peril, state institutions are not about </p>
<p>to disappear, even in the worst case. We are not about to see JAM in the palace …</p>
<p>“The political deal in Basra will be a precedent for the rest of the South. Whatever </p>
<p>the scale of concessions to JAM inherent in the eventual political compromise </p>
<p>reached in Basra with the Sadrists, it will set the standard for handling the JAM </p>
<p>challenge in other provinces. The wider public will also draw lessons about the </p>
<p>risk of standing out locally against the militia … Our aim must be to settle the </p>
<p>country back into the recent slow grind of normal Iraqi politics. Some of the new </p>
<p>dynamics released by events in Basra may in the end prove positive and help to </p>
<p>build on recent political progress. But, immediately, there are still serious challenges </p>
<p>in Basra.”</p>
<p><b>909. </b> On the evening of 31 March, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary told him that:</p>
<p>“The US agree that the most likely outcome in Basra is stalemate. The Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces can’t muster what is needed for a clear and hold operation. Maliki will be </p>
<p>weakened.”</p>
<p>448</p>
<p><b>910. </b> The same Private Secretary also reported that Muqtada al-Sadr had made a </p>
<p>further statement calling for an end to arrests, detainee releases, a pardon for JAM </p>
<p>members, the punishment of those responsible for the death of Sadrists and for Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki to leave Basra province. He added:</p>
<p>“Given the improvement on the ground, it may make most sense to focus tomorrow’s </p>
<p>meeting on the longer term strategy, while drawing lessons from the last few days …”</p>
<p><b>911. </b> In his second weekly report as SBMR-I, Lt Gen Cooper reflected on the impact that </p>

<p>he saw of MND(SE) when he visited …</p>
<p>“The UK-Iraqi relationship is damaged. Various … reports have highlighted </p>

<p>and a poor command performance, but what is clear is that post this event, UK-Iraqi </p>

<p><b>912. </b> In preparation for a meeting of NSID(OD) on 1 April, to consider the UK’s </p>

<p>450</p>

<p>They were a short-term strategy paper, a draft of a planned statement to Parliament </p>
<p>by Mr Browne and a letter from Mr Alexander on economic progress. </p>
<p><b>913. </b> A Cabinet Office ‘Chair’s Brief’ for Mr Brown identified five objectives for the </p>

<p>agreeing the terms of Mr Browne’s statement to Parliament that afternoon;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>beginning discussions – to be continued once the situation in Basra was </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>if the UK was likely to have a military presence in Iraq in 2009, officials should </p>
<p>insert themselves into US negotiations with the Iraqis to secure adequate legal </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>notwithstanding the plans for a military drawdown, the UK should maintain areas </p>
<p>of political and economic engagement “where we could continue to add value in </p>
<p>order to maintain our reputation and relations with the Government of Iraq, as </p>
<p>well as with the US”.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p><b>915. </b> The FCO short-term strategy paper looked at the options for drawing down UK </p>
<p>troops in Iraq; the civilian and military tasks that the UK could continue to undertake; and </p>
<p>assessed the impact of a diminishing UK contribution on the UK’s reputation.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FCO identified options for military withdrawal as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Withdraw by May 2009: “do the benefits of leaving early (less risk to life, </p>
<p>cutting our losses in an environment where it is proving difficult to achieve </p>
<p>objectives) balance the risk of serious damage to our global reputation (including </p>
<p>accusations that after five years in Iraq the UK mission had failed) and to our </p>
<p>relationship with the new US President?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Withdraw in late 2009, but no announcement of a decision until the new </p>
<p>US Administration was in office: “should we maintain the costs of staying </p>
<p>(financially/in asset resource terms, risk to life, political risk (including over </p>
<p>legal basis), risks posed by increasing insecurity in Basra) into 2009 in order to </p>
<p>protect the UK’s reputation and relationship with the new US Administration?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Withdraw in late 2009, but release Basra Air Station for economic development </p>
<p>by the Iraqis earlier and move a “smaller transitional force” to the Iraqi Army </p>
<p>base at Shaibah: “does reconfiguring our forces in this way enable us to </p>
<p>withdraw forces from Iraq by the end of 09 in a more effective way? Can civilian </p>
<p>effect, including delivery on the Prime Minister’s Economic Initiatives, be </p>
<p>delivered during 09 if UK forces reconfigure in this way? Would the extra costs </p>
<p>of developing Shaibah [Logistics Base] be justified?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Stay on indefinitely, with around 3,000 troops at Basra Air Station, in order </p>
<p>to provide continued support for the ISF, a secure platform for political and </p>
<p>economic work and “to protect the UK’s relationship with the new US President”: </p>
<p>“do the costs of remaining (financially/in asset resource terms, risk to life, </p>
<p>political risk) without a timeframe for withdrawal balance the benefits we would </p>
<p>gain from a continued presence (possible political, security, economic progress; </p>
<p>reputational (staying the course); better relations with the new President)?”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>916. </b> Beyond comments about how to evaluate each option – as set out above – the </p>
<p>paper made no recommendation on troop withdrawals. It set out a number of areas </p>
<p>in which the UK could continue to contribute in the absence of a significant military </p>
<p>presence in Basra, evaluating the importance and the likely impact of UK involvement. </p>
<p>They were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Progressing politics, top down: continuing the intensive diplomatic efforts in </p>
<p>Baghdad and with the Kurds in Erbil, focusing particularly on resolving the </p>
<p>Hydrocarbons Law and securing provincial elections and progress on Kirkuk and </p>
<p>the constitutional review. This was assessed as high importance (“This process </p>
<p>is slow and iterative, but without it the spectre of civil war looms large”) but only </p>
<p>medium impact.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Progressing politics, bottom up: continuing the reconciliation and outreach </p>
<p>efforts led by the UK military in Baghdad and building on the links with JAM </p>
<p>established in Basra. This was assessed as high importance and high potential </p>
<p>UK impact.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economics: continuing to make an important contribution to Iraqi-led growth and </p>
<p>economic reform, both in Baghdad and in Basra, where Mr Wareing’s leadership </p>
<p>as co-chair of the Basra Development Commission was “making real progress” </p>
<p>(see Section 10.2). This was assessed as of high importance, but low to medium </p>
<p>UK impact, because of the contrast with the “massive US effort”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security: primarily military SSR and support for ISF on operations. </p>
<p>No assessment of importance or potential UK impact was given.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Governance and security/justice sectors: continuing capacity-building projects </p>
<p>in Baghdad (not Basra), focused on security and justice sector reform. This was </p>
<p>assessed as of medium importance and medium impact. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pressing for more substantive multilateral and regional engagement by the UN, </p>
<p>International Monetary Fund and World Bank, assessed as high importance and </p>
<p>high UK impact (“We have more leverage with the EU, UN and World Bank than </p>
<p>the US”).</p>
<p><b>917. </b> FCO officials concluded the paper with a consideration on the reputational risk to </p>
<p>the UK of withdrawing from Iraq:</p>
<p>“Reducing UK effort in Iraq risks accusations that we are drawing down or leaving </p>
<p>prematurely and before the job is done, whenever we do it. The risk is more acute </p>
<p>if we make significant further reductions this year, leaving the ISF to deal with any </p>
<p>spikes in violence around the provincial/Presidential elections, and if the US backfill. </p>
<p>Next year the risk will be (somewhat) mitigated by reductions in the US’s own force </p>
<p>levels, if the security situation continues to improve, and if the US can be persuaded </p>
<p>not to backfill.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>353</p>
<p>“Either way, we will need to work up a strong public script, setting out the positive </p>
<p>aspects of the work we have done in Basra since 2003, and why the situation on the </p>
<p>ground justifies Ministers’ decisions on UK drawdown/withdrawal.”</p>
<p><b>918. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald, British Ambassador to the US, wrote to Mr McDonald on </p>
<p>31 March to express concern that the analysis of the options did not fully take into </p>
<p>account the risk to the UK’s relationship with the US, particularly in the run-up to </p>
<p>a Presidential election.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> He argued that it was essential to allow recent events in </p>
<p>Basra to: </p>
<p>“… shake down before we can sensibly take firm decisions on the right presence </p>
<p>and approach over the coming 12-18 months, decisions which are going to have a </p>
<p>major impact, not just on our Iraq policy but also our relations with the US and our </p>
<p>international reputation.</p>
<p>“Over the past five years we have repeatedly said that we will draw down our </p>
<p>troops as fast as conditions and Iraqi capabilities allow. It would be difficult, in the </p>
<p>US and elsewhere, to justify a draw down under present conditions in these terms. </p>
<p>If anything, the recent deterioration would suggest that we consider the reverse …”</p>
<p><b>919. </b> Sir Nigel commented that the Washington media were already picking up </p>
<p>“mutterings of dissatisfaction” about the UK’s contribution in Basra from some lower level </p>
<p>US military sources. Any suggestion that the UK was considering earlier withdrawal was </p>
<p>likely to stir up much greater criticism:</p>
<p>“… our reputation in the US will be significantly damaged if we are seen to leave </p>
<p>Basra in chaos or if UK forces have to be backfilled by US troops.”</p>
<p><b>920. </b> Sir Nigel thought that the US continued to believe that the UK military had a valid </p>
<p>continuing role in MND(SE): training and mentoring the ISF, protecting supply routes and </p>
<p>providing a re-intervention capacity. But he cautioned that, once the situation in Basra </p>
<p>had settled down, it would be necessary to reconsider the UK’s military posture there, </p>
<p>because the “major gaps” in UK situational awareness in Basra City “directly affects our </p>
<p>credibility here [in Washington]”. He therefore hoped that serious consideration would be </p>
<p>given to embedding UK troops with ISF units “as the US already do and as we ourselves </p>
<p>do in Afghanistan”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>922. </b> The role of UK forces had developed during the operation, initially providing </p>
<p>reconnaissance, medical and logistic support but expanding to include a Quick Reaction </p>
<p>Force deployed to the outskirts of Basra to help extract the ISF. This was “wholly </p>
<p>consistent” with overwatch. Mr Browne would tell the House of Commons that afternoon </p>
<p>that there would be a pause in troop reductions until the position clarified. </p>
<p><b>923. </b> Mr Browne observed that it would be some time before the full implications of the </p>
<p>operation were clear. It could have positive effects, including the direct engagement of </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr in politics.</p>
<p><b>924. </b> Mr Brown said that Ministers would have a further discussion of the implications </p>
<p>of recent events at NSID(OD), but the events in Basra had demonstrated the perennial </p>
<p>difficulties in Iraq. By acting early and without adequate planning, the Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights had exposed weaknesses in the ISF. </p>
<p><b>925. </b> When NSID(OD) met later that day, Mr Brown recognised that it was difficult to </p>
<p>take firm decisions on longer term options until there was a clearer assessment of </p>
<p>events in Basra.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p> It was good that the Iraqi Army had sought to take control, but the </p>
<p>way in which it had done so threatened to have a negative impact on political and </p>
<p>economic progress, as well as the security gains achieved by UK forces. The UK “could </p>
<p>not afford to be perceived to be irrelevant to the situation in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>926. </b> Mr Browne observed that there were now US forces involved in Basra, and they </p>
<p>were unlikely to leave. It was becoming clear that JAM1 was “a spent force”. The UK’s </p>
<p>relations with Prime Minister Maliki had deteriorated severely and would need to be </p>
<p>repaired. </p>
<p><b>927. </b> ACM Stirrup reported that present events in Basra did not affect the expectation </p>
<p>that the UK could complete its residual military mission in Basra by the end of the year. </p>
<p><b>928. </b> Ministers agreed that troop levels should remain at 4,100 until the situation became </p>
<p>clearer and that no decision on longer-term military commitment should be taken at </p>
<p>present. Departments were commissioned to produce an assessment of current events </p>
<p>in Basra before Mr Brown’s visit to Washington.</p>
<p><b>929. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Brown said that hopes for political and economic </p>
<p>stability to take hold in Basra had been “set back”. The UK needed to wait and assess </p>
<p>the implications of events “but work to bring our political and economic objectives back </p>
<p>on line”. </p>
<p><b>930. </b> Lt Gen Houghton briefed the Chiefs of Staff on 1 April that the violence across Iraq </p>
<p>that had erupted in the wake of the Charge of the Knights had been the worst seen since </p>
<p>June 2007.</p>

<p>than 15 percent of the strength of the ISF had been deployed to Basra. Mosul, and the </p>
<p>campaign to defeat AQ-I, remained the main focus for MNF-I attention.</p>
<p><b>931. </b> On the afternoon of 1 April, Mr Browne made a statement to Parliament about </p>
<p>the security situation in Basra.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p> He told MPs that UK forces continued to have a role </p>
<p>supporting ISF but:</p>
<p>“As the Iraqi Government have made clear, the main problems in Basra are </p>
<p>criminality and militia elements that act outside the law … While UK and coalition </p>
<p>forces have done much to deliver broad levels of security, over the longer term only </p>
<p>the Iraqis can tackle successfully criminal activity and political violence, which are </p>
<p>often linked to social and economic factors. The events of the last week should be </p>
<p>seen in that context.”</p>
<p><b>932. </b> Mr Browne went on to describe the sequence of events leading to the Charge of </p>
<p>the Knights:</p>
<p>“When I visited Iraq three weeks ago, I was briefed in detail about the Iraqi plan </p>
<p>for improving security in Basra by General Mohan … General Mohan then visited </p>
<p>Baghdad the following week to present the same plan to the Government of Iraq for </p>
<p>endorsement. Prime Minister Maliki formally announced his intention to accelerate </p>
<p>the implementation of the plan at a meeting on Sunday 23 March, where both the </p>
<p>US and the UK were represented at a very senior level.</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: what we have seen over the last week is action being taken by the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq to fulfil their responsibilities for security in a province that has </p>
<p>transferred to Iraqi control …”</p>
<p><b>933. </b> Mr Browne continued:</p>
<p>“It is too early to give a definitive or detailed assessment of how the operation has </p>
<p>gone overall … The situation remains fluid, although levels of fighting in Basra have </p>
<p>reduced since the weekend …</p>
<p>“We and our coalition partners are providing support to the Iraqis in line with </p>
<p>our commitments under overwatch and in accordance with our usual rules of </p>
<p>engagement. Requests for support are being made through the coalition, and I can </p>
<p>confirm that UK forces have continued to meet all their obligations as part of the </p>
<p>multi-national corps.” </p>
<p><b>934. </b> On UK force levels, Mr Browne told Parliament:</p>
<p>“In October, we announced our plan for drawing down UK troops from southern </p>
<p>Iraq, from 5,000 at the time of the announcement to around 2,500 by the spring, </p>
<p>dependent on conditions on the ground and military advice. At the end of the year, </p>
<p>458 </p>
<p>House of Commons, <i>Official Report</i>, 1 April 2008, columns 628-629.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>356</p>
<p>when UK forces moved into overwatch in the last province of Basra, we reduced </p>
<p>force numbers to around 4,500. Since then, numbers have been reduced further, </p>
<p>to their current level of around 4,000.</p>
<p>“Before the events of the last week, the emerging military advice … was that the </p>
<p>further reductions might not be possible at the rate envisaged in the October </p>
<p>announcement, although it remains our clear direction of travel and our plan. </p>
<p>In the light of the last week’s events, however, it is prudent that we pause further </p>
<p>reductions while the current situation is unfolding.”</p>
<p>459</p>
<p><b>935. </b> In the debate that followed his statement, Mr Browne was asked by Mr Adam Price </p>
<p>whether ISF action was disproportionately targeting JAM over other militia and whether </p>
<p>UK forces were therefore being drawn into taking sides in a civil war. Mr Browne said </p>
<p>that the available information suggested that the Iraqi Security Forces were taking on a </p>
<p>“complex mixture of criminal elements and gangs”, including JAM.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p> JAM had attracted </p>
<p>particular attention because Muqtada al-Sadr was a “significant player” in the Iraqi </p>
<p>political process. However, to “suggest that the Iraqi security forces had been taking </p>
<p>on only one element of the militia and criminal gang elements in Basra would be to </p>
<p>misrepresent what they have been doing”.</p>
<p><b>936. </b> Mr Browne also told MPs that it was well known that Iranian elements had been </p>
<p>“interfering substantially” in southern Iraq in a number of ways.</p>
<p>461</p>
<p> He had no evidence to </p>
<p>suggest malign involvement by Iran over the past week but there was “no question but </p>
<p>that some of those people have been trained and equipped by Iran”.</p>
<p>462</p>
<p><b>937. </b> On 1 April, Prime Minister Maliki announced that he was going to supplement the </p>
<p>ISF with 10,000 Basra citizens in a “Sons of Iraq” programme that he had developed </p>
<p>with the local tribes.</p>
<p>463</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>938. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner commented that a sufficiently robust governance </p>
<p>structure would be required to prevent this group turning into another armed militia and </p>
<p>a considered approach would be needed to prevent them becoming a new target set </p>
<p>for JAM. Whilst the establishment of such a programme in MND(SE) was something </p>
<p>that the UK had sought to avoid and continued to oppose, he observed that “our voice </p>
<p>carries little weight and there is little that we can and ought to do other than support the </p>
<p>MNC-I in developing recommendations”.</p>
<p><b>939. </b> Mr Brown spoke to President Bush on the afternoon of 1 April.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p> His Private </p>
<p>Secretary’s record of the conversation indicates that they did not discuss Iraq but looked </p>

<p><b>940. </b> On the same day, Mr Prentice met Vice President Hashemi in Baghdad, who </p>
<p>attributed the cease-fire in Basra “entirely to the ‘role of Iran’”.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> Mr Prentice and Vice </p>
<p>President Hashemi agreed that action in Basra was correctly targeting JAM first since </p>
<p>they were “the most active group”.</p>
<p><b>941. </b> Vice President Hashemi told Mr Prentice that he was urging Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>to return to Bagdad and call for a Political Committee for National Security. He believed </p>
<p>there was wide support for such a committee focused on Basra. </p>
<p><b>942. </b> On 2 April, the British Embassy Office Basra reported that Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>had left Basra for Baghdad on the previous day.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p><b>943. </b> On 3 April, Maj Gen White-Spunner briefed Lt Gen Houghton that the situation </p>
<p>on the ground in Basra City had changed dramatically.</p>
<p>467</p>
<p> JAM appeared to be abiding </p>
<p>by Muqtada al-Sadr’s call to stay off the streets; the curfew had been lifted during the </p>
<p>day and the streets seemed mostly calm and quiet. The resulting impact on MND(SE) </p>
<p>freedom of manoeuvre in the city and on the threat against the COB had been </p>
<p>significant. </p>
<p><b>944. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that MNC-I had re-ordered its priorities so that </p>
<p>Basra now sat above Mosul and was second only to Baghdad. Significant US forces had </p>
<p>been deployed to Basra to support the ISF operation:</p>
<p>“With this influx, the US have recognised that MND(SE)’s current size and structure </p>
<p>is insufficient to deliver a result in Basra at the pace they require and have asked </p>
<p>[for] it to be reviewed. We should expect nothing less from a MNC-I Main Effort. The </p>
<p>PM’s initiative, whilst not what we had planned for, does now pose a real opportunity </p>
<p>that we must enable the Iraqis to capitalise on. A coalition-led, but Iraqi-faced surge </p>
<p>over the coming month would build on the Basrawi consent and optimism and has </p>
<p>the potential to dramatically reshape the security environment.”</p>
<p><b>945. </b> US troops were expected to remain in MND(SE) for at least a month. The Deputy </p>
<p>Commanding General MNC-I and Maj Gen White-Spunner had decided to integrate </p>
<p>their staff into a joint headquarters in order to maximise the coherence of their efforts. </p>
<p>Maj Gen White-Spunner wrote that:</p>
<p>“For the next month we are jointly focused on delivering the very best for Basra that </p>
<p>we can and our approach is very much that the Iraqi operation offers an opportunity. </p>
<p>We could, possibly, end up with a more peaceful and secure city in the coming </p>
<p>weeks … Whilst we are getting on with this, I suspect that the UK needs to answer </p>
<p>some fairly fundamental questions. To preserve the level of effort the US feels </p>
<p>is required in Basra will require substantial resources, certainly beyond what is </p>
<p>currently available to MND(SE). If we are to provide these then we should expect to </p>

<p>do so for a sustained period. Alternatively, the demonstrable lead that the ISF have </p>
<p>taken could be argued to have opened a window of opportunity for us to reassess </p>
<p>the mission. MNC-I think that the events of the last two weeks have advanced the </p>
<p>campaign in Iraq by eight months and we have to accept, albeit painfully, that we </p>
<p>have become somewhat irrelevant to the Iraqis now that they have access to US </p>
<p>resources. We suggested to you last month the need to change the mission here to </p>
<p>a training and economic mission … and we would argue that the time has come to </p>
<p>decide to do so and to fit that mission into a broader US structure in southern Iraq … </p>
<p>Whatever, we’re beyond a ‘patch up’ to preserve a Union Jack in Basra just to look </p>
<p>good. We will most definitely not look good if we can’t preserve whatever may have </p>
<p>been achieved in Basra and it slips back. We must only take on those tasks that we </p>
<p>have the resources to deliver.”</p>
<p><b>946. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that, through the Charge of the Knights, </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki had asserted central government authority over Basra and </p>
<p>turned around the perception of Iraq drifting into renewed sectarian conflict.</p>
<p>468</p>
<p> It </p>
<p>had also served to reprioritise Basra within the MNF campaign. Until Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki launched his initiative, Basra had never been the main effort for either the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government or the Americans. The impact of that shift in priorities was, in Mr Prentice’s </p>
<p>view, a key turning point.</p>
<p><b>947. </b> In an update on 3 April, the British Embassy Office Basra commented that it was </p>
<p>“clear that the US … feels that we moved to PIC in Basra too early”.</p>
<p>469</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>948. </b> A Cabinet Office minute containing briefing for a telephone call between Mr Brown </p>
<p>and Prime Minister Maliki on 3 April described one deliverable for the call as “our </p>
<p>relationship with Maliki starts to rebuild, and he feels he still has the UK’s support”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>949. </b> Cabinet Office officials explained that Prime Minister Maliki had given the UK </p>
<p>and US “minimal notice of his intention to travel to Basra, and did not consult at all on </p>
<p>his plan to launch a major Iraqi-led offensive”. He had then blamed the UK for lack </p>
<p>of support when the ISF got into difficulties and excluded UK officers from planning </p>
<p>meetings at his headquarters in Basra Palace. The brief suggested that Mr Brown </p>
<p>should point out that “if UK planning staff had been involved from an earlier stage, </p>
<p>we could have done more – and more effectively”. </p>
<p><b>950. </b> The minute said that the coalition had turned down a number of “ill-thought-</p>
<p>through Iraqi requests for combat support” but “with the full knowledge and support </p>
<p>of General Austin (Commander, Multi-National Corps)”. As the operation continued, </p>
<p>MND(SE) had expanded its involvement, providing air, surveillance, medical and </p>
<p>logistical support to the ISF, as well as limited direct and indirect fire support.</p>

<p><b>951. </b> Mr Brown and Prime Minister Maliki spoke by telephone on 3 April.</p>
<p>471</p>
<p> The latter </p>
<p>explained that events in Basra had been difficult but they had been a good opportunity </p>
<p>to test the readiness of Iraqi Security Forces, which had undertaken their tasks with only </p>
<p>limited logistic support from the MNF. </p>
<p><b>952. </b> Mr Brown explained that all the UK’s actions had been intended to support </p>
<p>the restoration of law and order in Basra and the authority of the Iraqi Government; </p>
<p>4,000 UK troops continued to risk their lives to ensure that Iraq was stable and peaceful. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki expressed his gratitude, but observed that the Iraqis had not been </p>
<p>informed about the agreement between the UK and JAM, which JAM had exploited. </p>
<p>Commanders in Basra had told Prime Minister Maliki that there had been insufficient </p>
<p>support for the Charge of the Knights from UK troops. In order to preserve the close </p>
<p>working relationship between Iraq and the UK, better co-ordination and communication </p>
<p>needed to be agreed. </p>
<p><b>953. </b> Mr Brown “regretted that a misunderstanding had arisen over the UK role” and said </p>
<p>that the UK “had offered full logistical support to the operations”. He expressed concern </p>
<p>that the UK had not been consulted in advance about Prime Minister Maliki’s operations </p>
<p>in Basra. Given the role and exposure of UK forces, it was important to ensure that this </p>
<p>did not happen again. Mr Prentice would be instructed to meet Prime Minister Maliki and </p>
<p>Dr Rubaie to go over the issues in more detail. </p>
<p><b>954. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“We were not doing what Maliki … accused us of doing, which is taking ourselves </p>
<p>out of the fight and essentially giving free rein to the militias in Basra, which is what </p>
<p>he came to see as the role.”</p>
<p>472</p>
<p><b>955. </b> The day after Mr Brown’s telephone call, a senior government official specialising </p>
<p>in the Middle East (2) wrote to Mr Jenkins to say that Prime Minister Maliki’s complaint </p>
<p>was unfounded.</p>
<p>473</p>
<p> His advisers – Dr Rubaie, and Mr Tariq Abdullah – had been briefed </p>
<p>on the negotiations “at the outset and at various stages”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>had been “instinctively suspicious”, it did not oppose negotiations because they made an </p>
<p>early British withdrawal from the centre of Basra more likely. </p>
<p><b>956. </b> The senior official told Mr Jenkins that he was unaware of any former detainees </p>
<p>having returned to violence before the start of the Charge of the Knights. Attacks on </p>
<p>the COB had been largely the work of “splinter groups”. Information suggested that the </p>
<p>releases had in fact “encouraged JAM towards pragmatism rather than radicalism”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>957. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that the job of discussing the accommodation </p>
<p>with the Iraqi Government fell to Maj Gen Rollo, who “took it to the Government of Iraq </p>
<p>through Rubaie, the security adviser, and got the clearance”. The reaction was “positive”. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw had also been told that “Maliki had been appraised of the situation </p>
<p>and agreed”.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>958. </b> On 4 April, a Cabinet Office official updated Mr Brown that the situation in Basra </p>
<p>had “calmed considerably” but remained “fragile”.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> Operations continued, with both </p>
<p>US and UK “Military Training Teams” now in support of Iraqi forces. Both Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki and the Sadrists were claiming victory and relations between them were at a low </p>
<p>point, both nationally and in Basra, which would be “a set back for reconciliation and the </p>
<p>legislative programme”. Rebuilding UK-Iraq relations was likely to be “an uphill struggle”. </p>
<p><b>959. </b> As a result of the Charge of the Knights the US now had troops on the ground in </p>
<p>Basra (around 700 at the COB and more than 400 embedded with the ISF) and was </p>
<p>proposing a joint UK-US headquarters since “a return to the status quo ante” was not </p>
<p>an option. The UK’s “supposed red line for Basra’s militias has therefore already been </p>
<p>crossed, with US troops already on the streets”. Indications were that the US intended to </p>
<p>maintain an enhanced presence in Basra for the longer term, and there could be some </p>
<p>additional short-term increases. </p>
<p><b>960. </b> The Cabinet Office official also updated Mr Brown on Gen Petraeus and </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker’s forthcoming appearance before Congress. They were “likely to </p>
<p>present the Basra operation as a sharp spike in violence with repercussions still to play </p>
<p>out, but highlighting some positives in the operation.” It was possible they would “major </p>
<p>on the role of Iran” and the overall assessment was likely to prompt President Bush to </p>
<p>“agree the case for a cautious approach to future troop reductions”.</p>
<p><b>961. </b> Attached to the update was a letter from Mr Day to Ms Aldred containing advice </p>
<p>on “how US and UK military planning was proceeding in Basra”.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> Mr Day wrote that </p>
<p>short-term increases in US troop numbers were possible, to help the ISF “establish </p>
<p>the security conditions on the ground that will allow consent-winning economic effect </p>
<p>to be delivered”. Their activity might include “targeted strike operations, an information </p>
<p>campaign, ground patrols and the establishment of ISF strong-points in the city”, but </p>
<p>since Gen Petraeus had said there were no plans to send significant numbers of US </p>
<p>troops to MND(SE) then “the responsibility for any reinforcement in Basra itself could fall </p>
<p>to UK forces”.</p>

<p><b>962. </b> Mr Day considered it too early to say how the UK ought to respond politically and </p>
<p>strategically to new circumstances in Basra:</p>
<p>“At best, we could find the city stabilises and improves, which could ease a decision </p>
<p>on our longer term commitment. At worst, we could find ourselves confronted </p>
<p>with very difficult choices about how to respond to renewed violence, and a much </p>
<p>more complicated background to our long term strategic direction. Initial analysis </p>
<p>suggests that options might include our retaining control of MND(SE), with the </p>
<p>expectation that this would require us to deploy extra resources to meet the new </p>
<p>US plans; negotiating with the US to define a role in their plan that we could meet </p>
<p>within existing resources, either retaining command of MND(SE) or operating </p>
<p>under a US 2*; and using the changed circumstances as the catalyst for ending our </p>
<p>mission in Basra.”</p>
<p><b>963. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported to ACM Stirrup on 6 April that Basra had been “relatively </p>
<p>calm” in the week following the cease-fire.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> From Baghdad to Basra an “awkward </p>
<p>faceoff seems to have developed, with the Government having to balance its (legitimate) </p>
<p>determination to continue operations in support of the Rule of Law with the threat of the </p>
<p>Sadrists to break their Freeze again”. Lt Gen Cooper described Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>as “in control and emboldened” and outlined positive moves by the Iraqi Government to </p>
<p>kick-start the economy in Basra “driven by a welcome recognition of the economic basis </p>
<p>of criminality and militia-membership”. </p>
<p><b>964. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported having discussed Basra with Gen Petraeus and </p>
<p>concluded: “I am confident that the driver behind the current reinforcement of MND(SE) </p>
<p>is a theatre-specific desire to exploit an opportunity. He also confirmed that he had </p>
<p>no intention of asking the UK to reinforce in Basra”. But Lt Gen Cooper believed that </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus’ rejection of proposals to change the boundaries of MND(SE) was </p>
<p>calculated to “tie in a UK two star officer to Southern Iraq for the foreseeable future”. </p>
<p><b>965. </b> Lt Gen Cooper continued:</p>
<p>“We have to be honest about US perceptions. They see Basra as they found it </p>
<p>as ungoverned space. They are determined that it will not revert. While Petraeus </p>
<p>has told me that he sees no requirement for the UK to reinforce MND(SE), he also </p>
<p>believes the MNF-I build up was the right thing to do. He was pleased with the </p>
<p>results of action against JAM there … as he has made clear, he believes economic </p>
<p>progress is fundamental to underpinning the security line of operation. If the UK </p>
<p>will not leverage Iraqi money to deliver rapid progress, the US will use their own </p>
<p>expertise, links to Baghdad and manpower.</p>
<p>“The US view Southern Iraq through the prism of Iran. Events of the past week in </p>
<p>Basra and Baghdad have reinforced perceptions … It also explains why, sooner or </p>
<p>later, MNF-I will move into Maysan in order to control better the Iranian border. Any </p>

<p>362</p>
<p>UK future posture that can be perceived as leaving Iran in a stronger position will not </p>
<p>be welcomed.”</p>
<p><b>966. </b> On 6 April, Mr Prentice attended the MCNS, which was told that in Basra the </p>
<p>situation was “stable with the ISF fully able to control the situation”.</p>
<p>478</p>
<p> The main priority </p>
<p>now was finding civilian employment for 25,000 unemployed. Acting Justice Minister </p>
<p>Dr Safa al-Safi had been appointed to co-ordinate the Iraqi Government’s economic </p>
<p>efforts in Basra. </p>
<p><b>967. </b> The main concern on the horizon was the protest in Baghdad planned by </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr for later in the week. </p>
<p><b>968. </b> Dr Rubaie believed that agreement had been reached to confine the demonstration </p>
<p>to Sadr City and to ensure that it would have no “inappropriate slogans/banners”. The </p>
<p>ISF would work hard to protect the crowds from attack but also to control any violence </p>
<p>from within the crowds. In the event, Muqtada al-Sadr called off the protest.</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>969. </b> On 7 April, a government official working closely with the military in Basra sent a </p>
<p>“snapshot” of the area to London. The official reported that the “Basra landscape has, in </p>
<p>the space of two weeks, changed dramatically.”</p>
<p>480</p>
<p> Prime Minister Maliki was reported to </p>
<p>have “loudly blamed the British for treating with the JAM ‘criminals’ and, hence, handing </p>
<p>Basra over to them”. </p>
<p><b>970. </b> The official argued that the “unsatisfactory” performance of the ISF in the initial </p>
<p>offensive of the Charge of the Knights was a “vindication” of the objective to negotiate </p>
<p>reduced levels of violence: </p>
<p>“Within four days the Al-Maliki offensive had brutally exposed the inadequacies of </p>
<p>the ISF, united the Sadrist militias that we strove for so long to divide, and restored </p>
<p>JAM military prowess and morale … to excellent health.” </p>
<p><b>971. </b> A meeting attended only by UK staff had discussed the future of the </p>
<p>accommodation negotiated with JAM1. The official reported that they told the meeting </p>
<p>it had “been a child of its time”:</p>
<p>“It was not dead (indeed JAM seemed keen to keep it alive and had sent warm </p>
<p>greetings … that morning) but its influence over British operational policy should </p>
<p>be proportional to its fundamental usefulness. [JAM1] was on the run and the </p>
<p>ISF, backed by MNF, were back at war with JAM. But – it was still both a potential </p>
<p>weapon and an insurance policy. Essentially we should exploit it but not be </p>
<p>restricted by it.”</p>

<p><b>972. </b> Mr Day told the Inquiry that the understanding reached with JAM1 did not in any </p>
<p>way limit the ability of UK forces to assist with the Charge of the Knights, and that by </p>
<p>the time it happened “that aspect of our dialogue with the Sadrists in Basra had come </p>
<p>to an end”.</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>973. </b> Mr Prentice met Mr Abdullah, Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief of Staff, on 7 April to </p>
<p>discuss the phone call between Mr Brown and Prime Minister Maliki on 3 April and to </p>

<p>and nefarious deals between the UK and JAM”.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>974. </b> Mr Prentice expressed his surprise that the tone of the phone call had not been </p>
<p>positive as he had discussed the issues with Mr Abdullah shortly beforehand. During </p>
<p>the course of the conversation “a number of points had arisen that PM Brown had found </p>
<p>difficult to accept”. </p>
<p><b>975. </b> Mr Prentice added that allegations of a conspiracy between the UK and JAM were </p>
<p>“very damaging, unfounded and not understood in London”. The UK had been open with </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus and Dr Rubaie about its interaction with JAM. UK military commanders </p>
<p>also recalled that, two years previously, when they had proposed operations against </p>
<p>targeted JAM leaders in Basra (Operation SALAMANCA – see Section 9.5), Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki’s office had blocked them. In light of that, it was difficult to accept </p>
<p>accusations of malign intention and blame for JAM’s residual capacity. The fundamental </p>
<p>problem was Iranian assistance. </p>
<p><b>976. </b> Mr Abdullah agreed and acknowledged that the Prime Minister’s Office had been </p>
<p>kept in the picture about the UK’s dealings with JAM.</p>
<p><b>977. </b> Comments about lack of UK assistance during the Charge of the Knights were also </p>
<p>surprising; Mr Prentice provided Mr Abdullah with a list of “non-kinetic support provided </p>
<p>to ISF while Maliki had been present in Basra” and assured him that the UK “remained </p>
<p>fully committed to helping in its post-PIC role in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>978. </b> Mr Prentice asked Mr Abdullah to clarify the UK position with Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>before he and Mr Brown spoke again, in order “to move the relationship forward” in </p>
<p>advance of a planned visit to Washington by Mr Brown on 16 April. </p>
<p><b>979. </b> Mr Prentice also called on Dr Rubaie the following day, and explored “how best to </p>
<p>correct PM Maliki’s misapprehensions about the UK’s relations with JAM in Basra and </p>
<p>the support that MND(SE) had given during the recent operations”.</p>
<p>483</p>
<p> He emphasised </p>
<p>the “delicate political atmosphere in the UK over Iraq” and that important decisions </p>
<p>over Iraq policy were pending. Perceptions that the UK contribution and role were </p>
<p>not appreciated at the top levels of the Iraqi Government were damaging and could </p>
<p>“undermine political will to maintain UK engagement”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>364</p>
<p><b>980. </b> Dr Rubaie expressed his personal regard for the UK and the UK role in Iraq over </p>
<p>the previous five years. But Prime Minister Maliki had received information about the </p>
<p>relationship between the UK and JAM which had undermined his confidence in UK </p>
<p>forces in Basra, leading him to tell Gen Petraeus that he did not want UK forces involved </p>
<p>in the operation.</p>
<p><b>981. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were told on 8 April that it had “now become clear that the US </p>
<p>had always considered Basra to be ‘ungoverned space’ which MNC-I had planned to </p>
<p>address towards the end of 2008”.</p>
<p>484</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>982. </b> The Charge of the Knights had simply accelerated US intervention in Basra, which </p>
<p>had now been designated by MNC-I as the second priority after Baghdad, “resulting </p>
<p>(significantly) in the provision of continuous ISTAR coverage over the city which, </p>
<p>combined with the deployment of US and UK Military Transition Teams (MiTTs), had </p>
<p>dramatically improved situational awareness”.</p>
<p><b>983. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that the current situation in Basra: </p>
<p>“… placed the UK in an uncomfortable position though it was important not to miss </p>
<p>the current potential window of opportunity, alongside the US, to deliver tangible </p>
<p>progress on development. The UK’s longer term strategic objectives in Iraq would </p>
<p>need consideration alongside both national and military reputation. The Iraqi and US </p>
<p>position with regard to JAM needed clarity in the light of the recent ISF operations in </p>
<p>Basra; it was possible that the US might be forced to adopt a more robust position </p>
<p>against JAM if it continued to support Prime Minister Maliki. This would have </p>
<p>consequences for the current operational design in MND(SE).”</p>
<p><b>984. </b> A message from the British Embassy Office Basra on 9 April said that, at Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki’s request, a tribal committee had been established whose “broad plan is </p>
<p>to establish dialogue with OMS; support ISF and police in the search for weapons, and </p>
<p>support the process of handing in weapons”.</p>
<p>485</p>
<p> The committee had divided the city into </p>
<p>areas, within which a sub-committee would work to persuade militia members to hand </p>
<p>over their weapons. </p>

<p><b>986. </b> Ambassador Crocker said:</p>
<p>“Immense challenges remain and progress is uneven and often frustratingly slow; </p>
<p>but there is progress. Sustaining that progress will require continuing US resolve </p>
<p>and commitment. What has been achieved is substantial, but it is also reversible.”</p>

<p><b>987. </b> Ambassador Crocker described newly passed laws as “not perfect and much </p>
<p>depends on their implementation, but they are important steps”. He pointed to the </p>
<p>importance of the Council of Representatives as a functioning institution and also </p>
<p>highlighted the “intangibles” – the attitudes among the population and the conversations </p>
<p>occurring among Iraqi leaders – stating: “The security improvements of the past months </p>
<p>have diminished the atmosphere of suspicion and allowed for acts of humanity that </p>
<p>transcend sectarian identities.” </p>
<p><b>988. </b> Ambassador Crocker concluded:</p>
<p>“… almost everything about Iraq is difficult. It will continue to be difficult as Iraqis </p>
<p>struggle with the damage and trauma inflicted by 35 years of totalitarian Ba’athist </p>
<p>rule. But hard does not mean hopeless, and the political and economic process of </p>
<p>the past few months is significant. I must underscore, however, that these gains </p>
<p>are fragile, and they are reversible. Americans have invested a great deal in Iraq, </p>
<p>in blood as well as treasure, and they have the right to ask whether this is worth it, </p>
<p>whether it is now time to walk away and let the Iraqis fend for themselves. Iraq has </p>
<p>the potential to develop into a stable, secure multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian democracy </p>
<p>under the rule of law. Whether it realizes that potential is ultimately up to the Iraqi </p>
<p>people. Our support, however, will continue to be critical. I said in September that </p>
<p>I cannot guarantee success in Iraq. That is still the case, although I think we are </p>
<p>now closer. I remain convinced that a major departure from our current engagement </p>
<p>would bring failure, and we have to be clear with ourselves about what failure </p>
<p>would mean.”</p>
<p><b>989. </b> Gen Petraeus described “significant but uneven security progress” since the </p>
<p>previous Congressional hearing in September 2007. He highlighted that levels of </p>
<p>violence and civilian deaths had been reduced substantially, that extremist elements had </p>
<p>been “dealt serious blows” and that the capability of Iraqi Security Forces had grown. </p>
<p>Like Ambassador Crocker, he warned:</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, the situation in certain areas is still unsatisfactory and innumerable </p>
<p>challenges remain. Moreover, as events in the past two weeks [the Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights] have reminded us and I have repeatedly cautioned, the progress made </p>
<p>since last spring is fragile and reversible.”</p>
<p><b>990. </b> Both Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus referred to the situation in Basra. </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker stated:</p>
<p>“News from Iraq in recent weeks has been dominated by the situation in Basra. </p>
<p>Taken as a snapshot, with scenes of increasing violence, and masked gunmen in the </p>
<p>streets, it is hard to see how this situation supports a narrative of progress in Iraq. </p>
<p>There is still very much to be done to bring full government control to the streets of </p>
<p>Basra and eliminate entrenched extremist, criminal, and militia groups. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>“When viewed with a broader lens, the Iraqi decision to combat these groups in </p>
<p>Basra has major significance. First, a Shia majority government, led by Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki, has demonstrated its commitment to taking on criminals and </p>
<p>extremists regardless of sectarian identity. Second, Iraqi Security Forces led these </p>
<p>operations, in Basra, and in towns and cities throughout the South. British and </p>

<p>freedom of movement on Basra’s main routes and in the centre and east but less so in </p>
<p>the north and west where effective IED attacks against their patrols continued and small </p>
<p>arms fire incidents were commonplace.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p> The militia strongholds of Qibla, Hayaniyah </p>
<p>and Five Mile Market remained under JAM control. The city was increasingly tense, with </p>
<p>people anticipating the second phase of ISF operations. </p>
<p><b>992. </b> The weapons amnesty had ended on 8 April, but a lack of publicity meant that it </p>
<p>had had limited success. The ISF planned to launch a series of clearance operations </p>
<p>to find and confiscate medium to heavy weapons in key areas, although this phase of </p>
<p>operations had been delayed twice.</p>
<p><b>993. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner concluded:</p>
<p>“We continue to believe that the events of the past two weeks, although unexpected </p>
<p>and open to misinterpretation, are a real opportunity for Basra and hence our </p>
<p>involvement here. The time for any recrimination over lack of Iraqi consultation and </p>
<p>rumours of possible complicity by others in Baghdad is behind us; we now have a </p>
<p>better chance than we have arguably had for two years to achieve better security </p>
<p>and some initial development goals in the city. We will not have long to do so, given </p>
<p>that the run up to the October elections will inevitably lead to polarisation and a </p>
<p>possible recurrence of factional violence. The next two-three months are therefore </p>
<p>critical and if the next phase of the ISF security operation is successful then we must </p>
<p>be prepared to exploit that success more quickly.”</p>
<p><b>994. </b> On 11 April, Dr Christian Turner, Deputy Director Middle East, North Africa </p>
<p>and North America in the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat, </p>
<p>advised Mr Brown that he should use his forthcoming visit to Washington to press </p>
<p>President Bush for UK involvement in planning for Basra.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> He explained:</p>
<p>“At present we have little insight into their [US] thinking, and its effect on us. A key </p>
<p>deliverable for your meeting with [President] Bush is to secure our involvement in </p>
<p>planning: if we are to stay in the South, we need agreed plans …</p>

<p>“The main … question is what are US plans for the MNF Mission in the South? At a </p>
<p>high level they want to help the Iraqis counter the militias, disrupt Iranian influence </p>
<p>and extend Iraqi Government control. But we will need to be clear what we are </p>
<p>getting in to, and guard against two strategic risks:</p>
<p>(a)  That MNF gets dragged into intra-Shia rivalries …</p>
<p>(b)  That we become embroiled in an escalating Iranian confrontation. Events </p>
<p>in Basra have greatly increased Iraqi perceptions of the threat posed by </p>
<p>Iran’s sponsorship of JAM … We are less convinced … that the Iranians </p>
<p>can control JAM, and … judge that Iran’s role in the crisis was primarily </p>
<p>one of observer and mediator. We judge that Iran is trying to limit intra-Shia </p>
<p>violence …</p>
<p>“Whatever the plan, we will see a more active US role, and renegotiation of UK tasks </p>
<p>in MND(SE). We have three broad military options:</p>
<p>(i)   Step-up: seek to take full responsibility for delivering emerging plans for </p>
<p>MND(SE), reversing our troop drawdown.</p>
<p>(ii)  Steady state: remain with existing force levels and negotiate a new set of </p>
<p>tasks with the US …</p>
<p>(iii)  Withdrawal: take the opportunity provided by the changed circumstance to </p>
<p>accelerate our withdrawal from Basra before November.</p>
<p>“Much depends on US attitudes, which are conditional on whether the situation in </p>
<p>Basra stabilises …</p>
<p>“A US team will arrive in Basra in the next few days to step up reconstruction efforts. </p>
<p>Presentationally, the US effort risks overshadowing UK economic initiatives … </p>
<p>“We will need to ensure our projects are co-ordinated and complementary. </p>
<p>Experience over the past five years in such projects is that they provide short term </p>
<p>benefits, but are often not sustainable … Our message to the US will need to be that </p>
<p>such work takes time.”</p>
<p><b>995. </b> Dr Turner provided Mr Brown with “a narrative stressing what we have achieved – </p>
<p>and still hope to achieve – on military training, political reconciliation and economic </p>
<p>reconstruction”. He advised:</p>
<p>“Publicly we will need to reinforce the principles of your 8 October statement: </p>
<p>we will fulfil our obligations in Iraq as long as we are there at the invitation of the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq and the international community … </p>

<p>House and commented:</p>
<p>“They know we are irritated, but ‘a lot of people here think the UK has failed in </p>
<p>Basra’. I told Bush’s people that … your priorities were Iraq … [and] you would have </p>
<p>positive public messages on the three part plan for Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>997. </b> On 11 April, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10 with “a note on the </p>

<p>490</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>998. </b> The letter explained that current planning was conditions-based but rested on </p>
<p>the assumption that the UK would not leave Basra until the training of the Iraqi Army’s </p>
<p>14th Division had been completed and Basra Airport had been transferred to Iraqi </p>
<p>control. Both were expected during the latter part of 2008, though the Charge of the </p>
<p>Knights had set back progress. </p>
<p><b>999. </b> Although there was no cross-Whitehall “template” for the UK’s relationship with </p>
<p>Iraq, and no detailed planning had been done “on whether a 1,750 figure made sense </p>
<p>militarily”, the main military contribution could include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training the Iraqi Navy; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping to run the military staff college and junior officer training;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued MiTTing activity; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>some niche capabilities – including ships in the northern Gulf and fast jets – </p>
<p>provided an appropriate legal basis could be agreed once resolution 1790 </p>
<p>expired at the end of the year. </p>
<p><b>1000. </b> The Private Secretary wrote, “early planning suggests that it should be possible to </p>
<p>meet all of these tasks with rather fewer than 1,750 people in Iraq and Kuwait”.</p>
<p><b>1001. </b> The letter continued:</p>
<p>“Moving from our current presence in Basra (c[irca].4,100 personnel) to this new </p>
<p>model would be a complex and demanding operation … Our provisional assumption </p>
<p>… is that we would need around six months to plan and implement withdrawal </p>
<p>from the Basra COB … Our preparations would become apparent very quickly to </p>
<p>the Americans but a shorter timescale would carry major operational, morale and </p>
<p>presentational consequences.</p>
<p>“The broader implications would need to be worked through. Our initial sense is </p>
<p>that even with a significant residual commitment it would have an inevitable impact </p>

<p>two districts of Basra which “met little resistance and netted two significant weapons </p>
<p>caches, an IED factory and at least 15 militiamen arrested”. However, it was “still not </p>
<p>clear whether the failure of JAM to confront the army is a tactical move or indicates a </p>
<p>significant breakdown of leadership and morale in mainstream JAM”.</p>
<p><b>1004. </b> Mr Prentice met Prime Minister Maliki for half an hour on 12 April and for an hour </p>
<p>and a half on the following day to discuss the UK military’s role in Basra and the alleged </p>
<p>deals with JAM.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> A record of the discussions by a member of the Embassy’s Chancery </p>
<p>section said that they were “frank and open discussions without a hint of animosity”. </p>
<p>During the first meeting, Prime Minister Maliki explained that his concerns were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>information alluding to deals between JAM and UK forces in Basra, in particular </p>
<p>allegations that UK forces had provided assurances that they would not </p>
<p>intervene and that JAM detainees had been released without informing the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of UK support to the ISF in Basra – Gen Mohan believed that UK forces had </p>
<p>provided “no training and no equipment”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of intelligence support on JAM’s capabilities from the UK;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK negligence in allowing JAM to re-arm and regroup during the “freeze”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the error of withdrawing from Basra Palace without proper consultation which </p>
<p>had allowed JAM to take control; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the UK had prevented US helicopters flying from Basra in support of the </p>
<p>Charge of the Knights. </p>
<p><b>1005. </b> Mr Prentice explained the support that UK forces had provided in Basra while </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki had been there.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p> The allegations that the UK had not provided </p>

<p>used violence and to interdict, where possible, operations to smuggle weapons. </p>
<p><b>1006. </b> Prime Minister Maliki expressed surprise at the amount and variety of weapons </p>
<p>in JAM’s possession. Mr Prentice explained that “Iran alone” was responsible for the </p>
<p>weapons in JAM’s hands. It was not possible to stem the flow of smuggled weapons </p>
<p>either to Basra or to Sadr City completely.</p>
<p><b>1007. </b> On the issue of helicopter support, Mr Prentice explained that both US and UK </p>
<p>Rules of Engagement had prevented flights initially but that the US had altered theirs </p>
<p>and so were able to conduct selected operations. </p>
<p><b>1008. </b> Prime Minister Maliki concluded by thanking the UK for the support offered. He </p>
<p>would be meeting the Minister of Defence on 18 April and would communicate the true </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1010. </b> A CIG assessed the performance of the Iraqi Security Forces during the Charge </p>
<p>of the Knights in a note issued on 14 April.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p> The CIG judged that:</p>
<p>“… on their own, the ISF underperformed against JAM in Basra, Maysan and Dhi </p>
<p>Qar … In Basra they relied heavily on MNF supplies (i.e. ammunition and rations), </p>
<p>air strikes and eventually MNF mentoring … Military reporting suggested little sign of </p>
<p>a detailed operational plan or evidence of precision targeting of JAM Special Groups </p>
<p>… until the arrival of MNF training teams from 1 April …</p>
<p>“Basra’s Chief of Police reportedly believes that hundreds of local police melted </p>
<p>away within the first 24 hours of fighting – others joined JAM’s ranks … Many of the </p>
<p>National Police units drafted in from Baghdad, with superior arms and armour, fared </p>
<p>much better. The affiliation of many to ISCI/Badr probably strengthened their resolve </p>
<p>to try and weaken their chief rival (JAM).</p>
<p>“… even with reinforcements … the Iraqi Army lost most tactical engagements </p>
<p>against JAM … prior to JAM’s stand down on 31st March. However, neither did they </p>
<p>cede ground, and specific successes … [have] emboldened them. Iraqi Special </p>
<p>Forces were ineffective until their US mentors were re-inserted.”</p>

<p>Iranian influence.</p>
<p>496</p>
<p> More than ever, he added, senior Iraqi officials were beginning to </p>
<p>ask the same questions.</p>
<p><b>1012. </b> Lt Gen Cooper considered that the fact that Gen Petraeus saw the South as the </p>
<p>front line in the battle against Iranian influence in Iraq meant that he was likely to focus </p>
<p>on Basra as soon as he returned from Washington after his testimony. US forces were </p>
<p>expected to remain in MND(SE) for some time. Lt Gen Cooper commented:</p>
<p>“… there seems little doubt that MND(SE) has changed for good. I think there is also </p>
<p>an increasing consensus around the UK’s options to respond to this – probably best </p>
<p>described as ‘lead’, ‘follow’ or ‘get out of the way’ …</p>
<p>“It is clear from my discussions here that the US view of the current HQ MND(SE) is </p>
<p>that it is not a proper two star HQ. That is why they reinforced … in order to achieve </p>
<p>greater situational awareness and an enhanced planning and fires capability. They </p>
<p>will wish to ensure that these capabilities remain in the future in order to have </p>
<p>the desired effect in Basra. The question will be whether the US or UK supplies </p>
<p>those capabilities and in what balance. This may demand a re-enlargement </p>
<p>of HQ MND(SE) in terms of UK staff and capability, but it should not require </p>
<p>additional units … </p>
<p>“I think we should be looking at the current position as an opportunity rather than </p>
<p>a threat. It is hard to escape the view that the current situation in Basra is not that </p>
<p>which we would wish. If we want to depart leaving a sound and robust legacy, with </p>
<p>our reputation intact, Basra will need an improved Iraqi Army, a reformed IPS and a </p>
<p>sound expectation for long term economic regeneration. We are now better placed </p>
<p>to move more quickly to our desired endstate than we have been for some time, </p>
<p>but this will require close and vigorous [effort] … Taking this opportunity for the UK </p>
<p>to lead this will be important for our collective self-esteem. As Ambassador Crocker </p>
<p>said in his testimony this week ‘We will be judged on how we depart not on how </p>
<p>we arrived’.”</p>
<p><b>1013. </b> On 14 April, Mr Prentice reported to the FCO his view that Iranian influence had </p>
<p>been central to Muqtada al-Sadr’s decision to call a cease-fire at the end of March.</p>
<p>497</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki’s Charge of the Knights had unsettled the Iranians and caused </p>
<p>them to reassess their 100 percent support for him. Mr Prentice commented:</p>
<p>“These events have once again shown the extent of Iranian influence in Iraq: </p>
<p>having been a major contributor to the problem, Iran then became central to </p>
<p>delivering the cease-fire. But many in the GoI … have been shocked and angered </p>
<p>by Iran’s behaviour and their continued brazen support for JAM Special Groups </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>372</p>
<p>“Iran’s malign influence in Iraq is deep-rooted and extends across the political and </p>
<p>sectarian spectrum. Their influence is supported by bribery, supply of lethal aid and </p>
<p>an active and direct IRGC presence in Iraq. But it is only as effective as the GoI and </p>
<p>the Iraqi people allow it to be. And in the end, only the GoI and the Iraqi people will </p>
<p>be able to contain Iran’s malign influence in their country … Our best strategy for </p>
<p>helping the GoI contain malign Iranian influence remains: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to continue exposing nefarious Iranian activity when we have evidence of it;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to support the US in thumping Iran’s proxies when they are involved in </p>
<p>violence; and in parallel</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage US-Iranian-Iraqi dialogue over security in Iraq.</p>
<p>“We should also continue to acknowledge the legitimacy of benign Iranian activity – </p>
<p>particularly in the South. Senior Iraqis often (rightly) remind us that they cannot </p>
<p>change the map. Strong, mutually beneficial Iran-Iraq relations are in everyone’s </p>
<p>interest.”</p>
<p><b>1014. </b> Mr Prentice anticipated that, having being drawn into Basra by Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki, the US was likely to want to take the opportunity to address negative Iranian </p>
<p>activity in southern Iraq. Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus had set up a cross-</p>
<p>departmental team to draw up a strategy on how to combat Iranian influence.</p>
<p><b>1015. </b> On 16 April, the JIC looked again at the extent and nature of Iranian influence in </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>498</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“In pursuit of its aims for Iraq, Iran backs all of the main Iraqi Shia groups – both </p>
<p>those in Nuri Al-Maliki’s government and those in opposition. In relation to the </p>
<p>West, Iraqi Shia militias offer Iran a means to exert pressure – albeit with adverse </p>
<p>consequences for Shia political unity.</p>
<p>“Iran sees Al-Maliki as the best available Prime Minister … But Iranian support for </p>
<p>Al-Maliki is not a given …</p>
<p>“Al-Maliki’s decision to take on the JAM in Basra in March was primarily to address </p>
<p>internal Iraqi issues, including local crime and suppressing a rival political group …”</p>

<p>499</p>
<p> If successful, any operation was likely to drive </p>
<p>the remaining JAM elements further north into Maysan, specifically al-Amara, which </p>
<p>was both a haven for those fleeing south from Sadr City and also the major hub for the </p>

<p>374</p>
<p>Museum in Boston.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p> In it he said that “global problems required global solutions” and </p>
<p>called for new international rules and institutions to assist. One force of globalisation, </p>
<p>he said, was: </p>
<p>“… the sobering reality … that we are exposed – unpredictably but directly – to the </p>
<p>risk of violence originating in failed and rogue states around the world. Once we </p>
<p>feared rival nations becoming too strong; now the worst threats come from states </p>
<p>that are too weak.”</p>
<p><b>1024. </b> Phase III of the Charge of the Knights – an operation in the JAM stronghold in </p>
<p>the Hayaniyah district of Basra – was launched on 19 April.</p>
<p>505</p>
<p> Although MND(SE) had </p>
<p>expected the operation to be problematic, it went “remarkably smoothly, largely due </p>
<p>to some very thorough joint planning and an insistence on unity of command and fire </p>
<p>control measures which were welcomed by the Iraqi Army”. </p>
<p><b>1025. </b> During the course of the operation, over 35 large weapons caches were </p>
<p>found, containing 1,000 mortar rounds (some marked IRAN 2008), over 500 rockets, </p>
<p>450 rocket-propelled grenades and a large number of IEDs, EFPs and small arms. </p>
<p>The most notable finds were four man-portable air defence missile systems.</p>
<p><b>1026. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported that on the same day that Phase III launched, </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr issued a threat “to declare war” if the Iraqi Government did not back </p>
<p>off continued targeted operations such as those in Basra.</p>
<p>506</p>
<p> The threat was being taken </p>
<p>seriously but the Iraqi Government was not going to be forced into negotiation,  </p>
<p>“OMS/JAM will need to be de-escalatory in advance of any further talks”.</p>
<p><b>1027. </b> Lt Gen Cooper also reported to ACM Stirrup that the “US view of the Bush/Brown </p>
<p>discussion on Iraq is that it confirmed the move towards a shared venture in MND(SE)”. </p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Gen Dannatt visited Basra during Phase III and “found everyone in the Division </p>
<p>in an extremely positive, but cautious mood about the potential for delivering success on </p>
<p>the ground”.</p>
<p>507</p>
<p> At the end of his visit, Gen Dannatt reported that he:</p>
<p>“… came away from Iraq confident that we have <i>another</i> opportunity to be </p>
<p>successful in Basra – we must not let this one go. In order to do that we must ensure </p>
<p>that we are giving GOC MND(SE) the resources that he requires, not just in terms </p>
<p>of numbers but in the capabilities. Most crucially, however, we must ensure that our </p>
<p>message is proactive, aggressive and co-ordinated.”</p>

<p><b>1029. </b> Mr Prentice reported that at the 20 April meeting of MCNS, Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>praised the significant progress that the ISF had made in Basra in recent weeks.</p>
<p>508</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The challenge, Gen Petraeus said, would be to sustain it. He advised that the sustained </p>
<p>campaign needed to secure lasting success meant that the ISF had to start planning </p>
<p>future troop rotations so that they could stay on the offensive.</p>
<p><b>1030. </b> ACM Stirrup spoke to Gen Petraeus by telephone on 21 April.</p>
<p>509</p>
<p> They agreed that </p>
<p>given the recent events in Basra the enterprise in South-East Iraq “now represented a </p>
<p>‘joint endeavour’”. Whilst the UK was content to retain the lead in the South-East for the </p>
<p>moment, this would need to be addressed in the longer term.</p>
<p><b>1031. </b> ACM Stirrup made clear that the UK had to remain within current force </p>
<p>levels, accepting that there would need to be some restructuring to meet the new </p>
<p>circumstances and that, “for political reasons”, the UK would need to deliver some </p>
<p>further force reductions by the end of the year. They agreed that Lt Gen Houghton </p>
<p>should discuss proposals in more detail with Gen Petraeus so that ACM Stirrup could </p>
<p>give “some early thoughts” to Mr Brown.</p>
<p><b>1032. </b> On the same day, Lt Gen Cooper reported his own discussion with Gen Petraeus, </p>
<p>who said that he could accept a drop in UK combat force elements in return for an </p>
<p>increase in HQ staff capability. This reflected expected resource pressure that the MNF </p>
<p>would face when the Polish HQ in Multi-National Division (Centre-South) withdrew </p>
<p>in October.</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> Lt Gen Cooper reported that “the overall picture shows a return to pre-22 March </p>
<p>attack levels (which were in turn similar to 2005 levels)”. A trio of AQ-I attacks in Mosul, </p>
<p>Baquabah and Ramadi were a significant cause, along with “the continued constant </p>
<p>dribble” of fatalities and injuries from JAM or Special Group attacks. Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki’s attention was turning to “a new expedition” in Mosul. </p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Lt Gen Cooper awaited the outcome of Phase III in Basra, but indications were </p>
<p>that the JAM leadership had moved out of Hayaniyah. The key was to ensure they could </p>
<p>not return. </p>
<p><b>1035. </b> Phase IV of the Charge of the Knights was launched on 24 April, in the Five </p>
<p>Mile Market area of Basra, focused on “isolation and clearance, providing the security </p>
<p>required to conduct a detailed search”.</p>
<p>511</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1036. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported indications that Maysan province was becoming </p>
<p>a refuge for JAM militants – both Special Groups and mainstream – driven out of Basra </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>376</p>
<p>by the Charge of the Knights. In the short term, he did not think that the increased JAM </p>
<p>presence would destabilise Maysan: </p>
<p>“… as it is already under de facto ‘Sadr’ control from Governor Maliki downwards </p>
<p>and the local ISF are unlikely to take any action against them. Of more concern </p>
<p>is the likelihood they are using this period to discuss their future strategy for JAM </p>
<p>co-operation in Iraq. In the event of an ISF-MNF operation to secure al-Amara, it </p>
<p>is likely that the majority of key leaders will attempt to cross the border into Iran. </p>
<p>In due course they will try to return to Basra, an eventuality we must take care to </p>
<p>guard against.”</p>
<p><b>1037. </b> In Basra, there was a continuing “anti-British sentiment” in Basra Palace, where </p>
<p>the presence of UK personnel was still not welcomed. </p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that, at the MNF-I Conference in Baghdad, </p>
<p>Ambassador Crocker had described the action in Basra as “a defining moment in the </p>
<p>Iraqi mission showing an assertion of Iraqi sovereignty by the GoI previously not seen”.</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> Lt Gen Houghton visited Iraq on 25 April, to “talk through the options for the </p>
<p>UK’s operational commitment to southern Iraq during the remainder of 2008” with </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus, as ACM Stirrup had agreed he would.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> Reporting the meeting to </p>
<p>ACM Stirrup, he explained that he had set out the UK position as:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>That the UK should retain two-star Command of the four southern provinces for </p>
<p>the immediate future.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>That the UK could only commit to tasks within a force level ceiling of </p>
<p>4,100 troops.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>That this force level ceiling only allowed the UK to effectively meet the following </p>
<p>tasks:</p>
<p>(1)  Provision of an integrated Division/Brigade composite Headquarters;</p>
<p>(2)  MiTTing the BOC [Basra Operational Command].</p>
<p>(3)  MiTTing of 14 IA Div with supporting QRFs [Quick Reaction Forces]</p>
<p>(4)  Security of Umm Qasr;</p>
<p>(5)  NaTT [Navy Training Team];</p>
<p>(6)  BIA [Basra International Airport] Commercialisation.</p>
<p>(7)  Force Protection.</p>
<p>(8)  Force Support.”</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Lt Gen Houghton went on to explain that if the coalition was going to be able to </p>
<p>exploit the opportunities now offered in Basra and not allow the situation to be reversed, </p>
<p>512 </p>
<p>Minute Houghton to PSO/CDS, 26 April 2008, ‘CJO – Gen Petraeus Meeting 25 Apr 08’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>377</p>
<p>“the US would have to take on certain additional tasks and resource commitments”, </p>
<p>specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment of around 50 staff to the composite headquarters;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MiTTing of 10 Division;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>border security; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reform and retraining of the Iraqi Police Service; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a package of enablers amounting to around 750 US personnel.</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> Lt Gen Houghton reported that Gen Petraeus “readily understood the UK policy </p>
<p>context and was content with the scale of the continued UK commitment and the </p>
<p>potential division of tasks”. More detailed work was needed but “in principle we had </p>
<p>an agreement”. </p>
<p><b>1042. </b> Gen Petraeus visited Basra and gave an upbeat account of his visit at the </p>
<p>meeting of the MCNS on 27 April.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> He congratulated the Iraqi Government on a job well </p>
<p>done. The situation was transformed, but the ISF would need to stay focused and not </p>
<p>relapse into static routine. Operations in the Five Mile Market area had been successful </p>
<p>and the ISF were now moving on al-Qurnah. </p>
<p><b>1043. </b> In his weekly report, Lt Gen Cooper recorded that Gen Petraeus had commented </p>
<p>twice during the meeting “I can live with this”, but also observed that the situation was </p>
<p>“not optimal”.</p>
<p>514</p>
<p> Lt Gen Cooper commented:</p>
<p>“The bill of manpower that the UK equity leaves the US (and specifically MND-C </p>
<p>[Multi-National Division (Centre)]) to find will be possible, but will create some local </p>
<p>pain and include a degree of reprioritising. We should not underestimate the pain </p>
<p>that will fall to Lt Gen Lloyd Austin’s MNC-I, but I am confident that he will learn to </p>
<p>live with it.”</p>
<p><b>1044. </b> Mr Prentice told the Inquiry that Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker:</p>
<p>“… definitively wished to preserve our participation in the coalition. They sensed … </p>
<p>a wish in London to draw a line under Iraq and to get our forces out as soon as </p>
<p>possible, and they suspected somewhat a rush to draw down … [They] understood </p>
<p>the political realities for us, and also they had their understanding of the rising </p>
<p>demands from Afghanistan and other theatres.”</p>

<p><b>1045. </b> Mr McDonald updated the Iraq Strategy Group on Mr Brown’s visit to Washington </p>

<p>intention to resume a downward trajectory” after pausing at current levels and “would </p>
<p>therefore need a clear script on this for his meeting with Petraeus on 1 May”. </p>
<p><b>1046. </b> President Bush had “understood our sensitivities regarding the conduct of the </p>
<p>recent ISF operation in Basra” but added that “the US had been operating under the </p>
<p>same constraints, and believed the security situation in Basra had improved as a result”. </p>
<p><b>1047. </b> Mr McDonald told the Iraq Strategy Group:</p>
<p>“It was now clear that there was a shared UK/US operation in the South, and that </p>
<p>we would need to decide on their tasks and the division of labour. We needed to </p>
<p>focus on our remaining political, economic and military tasks. The first two required </p>
<p>provincial elections to take place, and tangible outcomes from the work of Michael </p>
<p>Wareing and the Basra Development Commission. The third would require a focus </p>
<p>on training and mentoring 14 Div, and might involve an accelerated push to achieve </p>
<p>effect earlier, so that we could draw down combat forces more quickly in 2009. </p>
<p>Our residual tasks should require no more than a few hundred troops.” </p>
<p><b>1048. </b> Lt Gen Wall reported to the Group that attack levels – including IEDs and </p>
<p>IDF – were lower in Basra since the Charge of the Knights, and JAM resistance to ISF </p>
<p>operations was waning. The challenge would be to prevent JAM’s re-infiltration, but it </p>
<p>was likely that the ISF would stay in the South in large numbers and therefore act as </p>
<p>a deterrent. He reported also a “risk” that 14th Division might be moved into Maysan, </p>
<p>“which would have implications for our MiTTs”.</p>
<p><b>1049. </b> Lt Gen Houghton’s visit to Baghdad had “gone as planned” and although </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus would prefer a “gentle glide path rather than rapid drawdown” once </p>
<p>14th Division was fully trained, he had “reluctantly agreed” to the UK’s proposals.</p>
<p><b>1050. </b> The next likely focus for ISF operations would be Mosul, which would have </p>
<p>implications for US resources in Basra, as would any uplift in Sadr City. Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>remained concerned about the lack of capacity on the border and had urged the UK </p>
<p>to consider greater use of private military companies (for example to provide airport </p>
<p>security, which might free up 200-300 troops). Lt Gen Wall observed that the UK was </p>
<p>“doing very little with the police, now that Jalil had departed”.</p>
<p><b>1051. </b> Mr Miliband visited Baghdad and Erbil in mid-April.</p>
<p>517</p>
<p> On 29 April, he wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Brown:</p>
<p>“However unfortunate its genesis, Maliki’s operation in Basra has created an </p>
<p>opportunity to reshape our approach there and set a new direction towards </p>
<p>transition. 2009 is the year we will need to move from a Basra military strategy to </p>
<p>an Iraq political and economic strategy. If we get the strategy right I believe we can </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.6  |  27 June 2007 to April 2008</p>
<p>379</p>
<p>emerge from Iraq with our military and political reputation intact and our relationship </p>
<p>with the US protected.”</p>
<p><b>1052. </b> Mr Miliband commented that the Iraqi Government was “for the first time since </p>
<p>2003” giving full attention to Basra. In support of that, the US had committed, “again </p>
<p>for the first time since 2003, serious assets from the Multi-National Corps to bolster </p>
<p>MND(SE)”. He believed that combined US, UK and Iraqi resources “will be able to </p>
<p>accelerate the rate of positive change in Basra”, paving the way for a “proper and </p>
<p>respectable end to our role as lead partner in the coalition” in the course of 2009 and the </p>
<p>start of “a broad-based and natural relationship with the new Iraq, the ‘whole Iraq policy’ </p>
<p>which we have long wanted”. </p>
<p><b>1053. </b> To make the transition “in good order”, Mr Miliband advised that it should be clear </p>
<p>to the US that the UK had properly completed the remaining military tasks to which it </p>
<p>was committed. That had implications for the ongoing negotiations with the US over the </p>
<p>“rebalancing” of US and UK efforts in MND(SE). Mr Miliband expressed concern that </p>
<p>the UK should “not be locked into tasks or roles which either cannot be easily justified or </p>
<p>presented domestically in the UK; or which have no discernable end and so risk locking </p>
<p>us into an open-ended commitment”. He also proposed that agreement should be </p>
<p>reached “sooner rather than later” on handing over the two-star Command of MND(SE) </p>
<p>to the US. </p>
<p><b>1054. </b> Concluding his letter, Mr Miliband wrote that:</p>
<p>“The opportunity in Iraq also cuts both ways. Iraq is discernibly shaping to be an </p>
<p>important and assertive regional power. We have a strong interest in establishing a </p>
<p>productive and full-scope bilateral relationship with that renascent Iraq. We will best </p>
<p>do so on the basis of a positive conclusion to our military engagement within the </p>
<p>coalition in MND(SE).”</p>
<p><b>1055. </b> During his visit, Mr Miliband met Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> Mr Baker reported to </p>
<p>the Iraq Strategy Group that this conversation “had been held in a bad atmosphere, with </p>
<p>Maliki blaming us for all of Basra’s shortcomings, and criticising our dealings with JAM.”</p>
<p><b>1056. </b> Charge of the Knights Phase V took place in the Jumariyah district of Basra on </p>

<p>519</p>
<p> On 1 May, Maj Gen White-Spunner reported that:</p>
<p>“What is becoming increasingly evident, as our situational awareness improves, is </p>
