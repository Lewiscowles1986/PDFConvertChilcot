<p>3.3  |  Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the development of UK policy on Iraq following Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>meeting with President Bush at Crawford on 5 and 6 April 2002, at which Mr Blair </p>
<p>proposed a partnership between the US and UK urgently to deal with the threat posed </p>
<p>by Saddam Hussein’s regime, including Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush at the end of </p>
<p>July proposing that the US and UK should use the UN to build a coalition for action.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of a dossier setting out the publishable evidence on Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction (WMD), the history of weapons inspections and </p>
<p>Iraq’s human rights abuses, which is addressed in Section 4.1; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD work on possible options for a UK contribution to a future military </p>
<p>operation, which is addressed in Section 6.1.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The roles and responsibilities of key individuals and bodies are described in </p>
<p>Section 2.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By July 2002, the UK Government had concluded that President Bush was impatient </p>
<p>to move on Iraq and that the US might take military action in circumstances that </p>
<p>would be difficult for the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July sought to persuade President Bush to </p>
<p>use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership with the US and </p>
<p>setting out a framework for action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair told President Bush that the UN was the simplest way to encapsulate a </p>
<p>“casus belli” in some defining way, with an ultimatum to Iraq once military forces </p>
<p>started to build up in October. That might be backed by a UN resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Note, which had not been discussed or agreed with his colleagues, </p>
<p>set the UK on a path leading to diplomatic activity in the UN and the possibility of </p>
<p>participation in military action in a way that would make it very difficult for the UK </p>
<p>subsequently to withdraw its support for the US.</p>
<p><b>Development of UK policy, April to June 2002</b></p>
<p><b>A UK contribution to US-led military action</b></p>
<p><b>4.  After Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Crawford, the MOD began </b></p>
<p><b>seriously to consider what UK military contribution might be made to any </b></p>
<p><b>US-led military action and the need for a plausible military plan for the overthrow </b></p>
<p><b>of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> In his letter to Mr Blair of 22 March 2002 (see Section 3.2), Mr Geoff Hoon, the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary, had cautioned that, “before any decision to commit British forces, </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>we ought to know that the US has a militarily plausible plan with a reasonable prospect </p>
<p>of success compared to the risks and within the framework of international law”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>6. </b> Mr Hoon had also suggested UK involvement in US planning would “improve” the </p>
<p>US process and enable Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS) </p>
<p>to either “reassure you that there is a sound military plan or give you a basis to hold </p>
<p>back if the US cannot find a sensible scheme”. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Much of the discussion at Crawford took place privately between the two leaders.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Overseas and </p>
<p>Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), recorded that the meeting on Saturday morning was </p>
<p>informed of a number of points, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no war plan for Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Thinking so far had been on a broad, conceptual level. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A very small cell in Central Command (CENTCOM) in Florida had recently been </p>
<p>set up to do some planning and to think through the various options. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When the US had done that, US and UK planners would be able to sit down </p>
<p>together to examine the options. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK would work through the issues together. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> Sir David Manning also recorded that Mr Blair had concluded President Bush </p>
<p>probably wanted to build a coalition. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> Mr Hoon discussed Iraq with Adm Boyce and Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent </p>
<p>Under Secretary (PUS), on 8 April (see Section 6.1). He commissioned work on military </p>
<p>options as a “precaution against the possibility that military action might have to be taken </p>
<p>at some point in the future”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>10. </b> On 12 April, Mr Simon Webb, MOD Policy Director, sent Mr Hoon a “think piece” </p>
<p>to give context to the work on Iraq.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> Mr Webb explored potential end states for military action in Iraq in the context of </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s “commitment to regime change (‘if necessary and justified’)” in his speech </p>
<p>at College Station on 7 April. Mr Webb added that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Commitment on timing has been avoided and an expectation has developed </p>
<p>that no significant operation will be mounted while major violence continues in </p>
<p>Israel/Palestine.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Both Crawford and contacts with the Pentagon confirm that US thinking has not </p>
<p>identified either a successor or a constitutional restructuring to provide a more </p>

<p>5</p>
<p>representational regime: Various ideas for replacements have been aired over </p>
<p>the years and none so far look convincing …”</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Webb’s view was that “the prospects for finding a stable political solution” </p>
<p>were “poor in the short term”. The US had “sufficient forces to undertake a military </p>
<p>operation … without anyone else’s help”; but to “achieve a successful regime change, </p>
<p>the UK would need to be actively involved (one might also argue that the Prime Minister </p>
<p>has effectively committed us)”. </p>
<p><b>13. </b> Mr Webb set out the MOD’s thinking on military issues. On the way forward, he </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“Despite the massive scale of commitment, there are arguments that preventing the </p>
<p>spread of WMD should be given the highest priority in coming years … [I]t remains </p>
<p>the greatest risk to Middle East and international stability in the medium-term; and in </p>
<p>the long-term countries like Iraq and Iran are on course to threaten Europe and UK </p>
<p>direct. It is arguable that preventing this spread by making an example of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would do more for long-term stability than all the displaced [military] </p>
<p>activities combined …</p>
<p>“By demonstrating our capacity for high intensity warfare at large scale [the </p>
<p>deployment of a division] the UK would also send a powerful deterrence message </p>
<p>to other potential WMD proliferators and adversaries.</p>
<p>“… There would come a point at which preparations could apply some valuable </p>
<p>pressure on Saddam; or be seen as a natural reaction to prevarication over </p>
<p>inspections. In general … until that point … we should keep a low profile …”</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Webb concluded:</p>
<p>“Even these preparatory steps would properly need a Cabinet Committee decision, </p>
<p>based on a minute from the Defence Secretary …” </p>
<p><b>15. </b> In April the MOD established “a small group of senior officials and military </p>
<p>planners to think about the issues that would be involved in any military operation in </p>
<p>Iraq, as the basis for initial contingency planning in the MOD”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> That body, which was </p>
<p>chaired by Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments) (DCDS(C) and was known as the Pigott Group, considered issues </p>
<p>related to UK participation in a US-led ground offensive in Iraq.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Participants included </p>
<p>the FCO, the Cabinet Office and the intelligence Agencies. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> The work of the Group is addressed in more detail in Sections 6.1 and 6.4. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 19 April 2002</b></p>
<p><b>17.  The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) judged on 19 April that it would be </b></p>
<p><b>politically impossible for Arab states to support military action against Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>18.  Regional states would prefer UN inspections or covert operations to topple </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein to a US-led attack, but US determination and a willingness to </b></p>
<p><b>deploy overwhelming force could help bolster regional support.</b></p>
<p><b>19.  There was consensus amongst Iraq’s neighbours that its territorial integrity </b></p>
<p><b>must be preserved. </b></p>
<p><b>20. </b> At the request of the JIC, an Assessment of “Iraq’s relations with its neighbours … </p>
<p>what influence Iraq has over them and how it is trying to improve its position; where </p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours’ concerns and interests lie” and an evaluation of “the regional reactions </p>
<p>so far to the prospects of a US-led attack on Iraq” was produced on 19 April.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>21. </b> During the discussion of the draft, the JIC had been told that Israel’s attack on Jenin </p>
<p>in the Occupied Territories had produced a “seismic shift” and there were “few, if any, </p>
<p>Arab countries who would support a strike against Iraq”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The JIC asked for the position of Iran and Saudi Arabia to be brought out more </p>
<p>clearly in the final Assessment. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The current Israel/ Palestinian crisis makes <b>Arab support for an attack on </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq politically impossible at present</b>. There is no sign that strong anti-US </p>
<p>sentiment will dissipate quickly, even if there is progress towards an equitable </p>
<p>resolution of the Palestinian issue.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq exerts considerable economic leverage over Jordan and Syria. Iraqi </p>
<p>propaganda successfully plays up Iraq’s suffering under sanctions. And Iraq </p>
<p>uses its support for the Palestinians to gain popularity in the Arab street.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>But Iraq has no real allies</b>. Iran, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia remain concerned </p>
<p>by Iraq’s conventional military capabilities. Iran is also concerned by its </p>
<p>development of WMD.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Turkey</b> would probably be willing to provide basing for a US-led attack on </p>
<p>Iraq … <b>Saudi Arabia</b> is very unlikely to provide basing for an attack, though it </p>
<p>might permit overflights. A strong case for action would need to be made. US </p>
<p>determination and willingness to deploy overwhelming force could help bolster </p>
<p>regional support. However, all would strongly prefer covert operations to topple </p>
<p>Saddam rather than a full-scale attack.”</p>

<p>7 </p>
<p>Minutes, 17 April 2002, JIC meeting. </p>

<p>3.3  |  Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Regional states would prefer UN inspections to a US-led attack on Iraq. Such </p>
<p>an attack would provoke large-scale protests across the Arab world. Jordan </p>
<p>would be particularly exposed to internal instability, but the Gulf States would </p>
<p>also be nervous. None of Iraq’s neighbours would regret Saddam’s overthrow </p>
<p>and none would provide practical … support for Iraq against a US-led attack.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There is consensus among Iraq’s neighbours that its territorial integrity must be </p>
<p>preserved, but there are great mutual suspicions and differences over the place </p>
<p>of the Kurds and the Shia in any new Iraqi regime, the regime’s nature and its </p>
<p>relationship with the West.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>24. </b> Key points from the Assessment are set out in the Box below. </p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 19 April 2002: ‘Iraq: Regional Attitudes’</b></p>
<p>The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Arab attitudes towards Iraq, and particularly towards any prospective US-led attack, </p>
<p>are inextricably linked to bilateral relations with the US, events on the ground in the </p>
<p>Occupied Territories and perceived Western ‘double standards’ in favour of Israel </p>
<p>… We judge that, <b>in the present circumstances, even the most pro-Western </b></p>
<p><b>Gulf States […] would find it politically impossible to support a US-led attack </b></p>
<p><b>on Iraq</b>. We judge it <b>unlikely that the current strong anti-US sentiment will </b></p>
<p><b>dissipate quickly</b>. Only significant progress towards what the Arab world would see </p>
<p>as an equitable resolution of the Palestinian issue would mitigate this. Even if this </p>
<p>is achieved, recent events in the West Bank will make it harder in the medium-term </p>
<p>to win regional support for military action against Iraq.”</p>
<p>Iraq-related concerns had “dropped significantly down the Arab agenda” and Iraq was </p>
<p>“rarely perceived as the greatest security threat within the region”. The Gulf States saw </p>
<p>“Iran as the greater long-term threat and want an Iran-Iraq balance”.</p>
<p>The “conjunction of the threat of US military action and the pressure in the UN to permit </p>
<p>the return of weapons inspectors” had “led Iraq to pursue a revitalised foreign policy”. </p>
<p>That had included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>talks with the UN Secretary-General;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>several attempts to win over its neighbours;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an Iraqi declaration at the Arab League Summit on 27 March 2002 that it </p>
<p>recognised Kuwait’s sovereignty and independence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a marked decline in the number of militant attacks on Iran which suggested that </p>
<p>Iraq had “at least temporarily restrained the MEK [Mujahideen e Khalq]”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an Arab League resolution that its members would not support an outside attack </p>
<p>on any other member.</p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours remained “suspicious of its intentions” and were “focused on </p>
<p>economic gains”. </p>
<p>8 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 19 April 2002, ‘Iraq: Regional Attitudes’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Addressing the longer term, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“… given real progress on Israel/Palestine, it might be possible to rebuild support for </p>
<p>action against Iraq …”</p>
<p>“… <b>Saudi Arabia</b> … has said it opposes an attack … <b>Turkey</b>, as a NATO ally, would </p>
<p>probably provide basing if asked, despite its reservations […].” </p>
<p>Regional attitudes to an attack would “remain tentative” until US plans were “closer to </p>
<p>completion and military preparations begin”, but “a number of themes” were “already </p>
<p>discernible”. These included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[G]overnments in the region would want any military campaign to be short and </p>
<p>decisive.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[<b>M</b>]<b>utual suspicions among Iraq’s neighbours</b>” meant regional co-operation </p>
<p>was “likely to be minimal.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iran wanted “a greater role for the Iraqi Shia in a new regime, but any pro-Iran </p>
<p>Shia regime, though unlikely would be anathema to the Gulf Arabs”. Iran and </p>
<p>Turkey were “keen not to set a precedent for their own Kurdish regions, […] </p>
<p>A power vacuum could cause particular problems and might tempt Iran and/or </p>
<p>Turkey to intervene.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Gulf Monarchies might be “willing to support a representational Government, but </p>
<p>would equate democracy with Shia rule”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iran’s “sense of encirclement would be heightened by the presence of US forces, </p>
<p>particularly if they remained in Iraq for an extended period”.</p>
<p>In a concluding section entitled “<b>Making the case</b>”,<b> </b>the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“<b>For governments expected to support a US-led attack, the justification and </b></p>
<p><b>evidence will be crucial in managing their public expectation</b>. Given that we </p>
<p>judge Iraq had no responsibility for … the 11 September terrorist attacks, Iraq’s </p>
<p>neighbours are likely to demand stronger proof of Iraq’s development of WMD … </p>
<p>using Saddam’s brutal and repressive regime alone as a justification would not attract </p>
<p>much support. A UN Security Council resolution authorising force would reduce </p>
<p>regional governments’ objections to an attack. <b>Partly because their populations </b></p>
<p><b>will not be persuaded by any likely justification for a military option, Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>neighbours, except for perhaps Kuwait, would prefer UN inspections to a </b></p>
<p><b>US-led attack</b>. […] Equally, it is possible that by offering to allow inspectors back into </p>
<p>Iraq (even if he obstructed them) and making some new but limited concessions to </p>
<p>the disarmament process, Saddam could strengthen his regional political position, </p>
<p>at least in the short term.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s interview on <i>BBC Breakfast</i> <i>with Frost</i>, 21 April 2002</b></p>
<p><b>25. </b> In an interview on <i>BBC Breakfast with Frost</i> on 21 April, primarily about the Budget, </p>
<p>Mr David Frost asked Mr Blair how close action was on Iraq.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“We have not taken any decisions on Iraq at all … we have identified weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction as a crucial issue … Saddam Hussein is a threat, the world would </p>
<p>be better off without Saddam Hussein in power, but … we will not take decision ’til </p>
<p>we have looked at all the options …”</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr Blair added that Saddam Hussein should allow the weapons inspectors to return. </p>
<p>That was what the United Nations had told him to do. Saddam Hussein was in breach </p>
<p>of UN resolutions and needed to fulfil those obligations.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Asked whether there were differences between him and Mr Gordon Brown, </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Blair said: </p>
<p>“… all we have decided … is that weapons of mass destruction have to be dealt with </p>
<p>… how we deal with it, however, is an open question.”</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Mr Blair’s comments on Iraq’s WMD capability and the timetable for the publication </p>
<p>of the “dossier” on those capabilities are set out in Section 4.1.</p>
<p><b>Resolution 1409 (2002)</b></p>
<p><b>29.  Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, was advised that there was little </b></p>
<p><b>prospect of agreement in the Security Council to any language demanding the </b></p>
<p><b>return of weapons inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>30.  A resolution implementing the “smart sanctions” regime was agreed on  </b></p>
<p><b>14 May, but compromises were necessary to secure Russian support and tougher </b></p>
<p><b>measures on tackling cross border smuggling were not included.</b></p>
<p><b>31. </b> Since the adoption of resolution 1382 in November 2001, the UK had continued </p>
<p>to pursue agreement on a new resolution introducing a smart sanctions regime.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Following Mr Blair’s discussions with President Bush at Crawford, Mr Straw advised </p>
<p>Mr Blair on 9 April that the shift in focus to the re-admission of weapons inspectors drew </p>
<p>the UK “inexorably into the question of cover in international law” for military action in the </p>
<p>event that, as Mr Straw suspected, Iraq failed to comply (see Section 3.2).</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>whether the May resolution giving effect to the Goods Review List (GRL) </p>
<p>agreed in November 2001 (resolution 1382) might “repeat in stronger terms </p>
<p>the Council’s demands for the unconditional return of the inspectors”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Mr Gray advised that he did “not think there was any prospect in foreseeable </p>
<p>circumstances” of getting a resolution “explicitly authorising military action”; and it was </p>
<p>“conceivable” that this might lead to “severe pressure, to the point of facing a draft </p>
<p>resolution forcing us to back away from this option altogether”. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Gray also advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Officials were “strongly inclined not to jeopardise” the GRL resolution “by </p>
<p>attempting to include military action language in its implementing resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The prospects for inserting language into the resolution “rolling over the </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food programme” at the end of May “might be better”, but UK actions </p>
<p>on Iraq were “now subject to minute scrutiny in the Council”. Russia and Syria </p>
<p>would “quickly detect language which smacked of easing the justification for </p>
<p>military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It might be possible to insert a demand for the return of inspectors into the </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food resolution but success would depend on the demands of other </p>
<p>members. If the talks between Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, and </p>
<p>Iraq made progress, the UK might seek a separate resolution calling for the </p>
<p>return of inspectors; but the difficulties involved would be “considerable”.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Towards the end of 2001, the Russians signalled to us that they might be more </p>
<p>amenable to a smart sanctions regime … in February or so of 2002, the US … </p>
<p>Secretary [of State] Colin Powell went serious on getting the smart sanctions regime </p>
<p>and there was a series of bilateral negotiations between Washington and Moscow </p>
<p>which was out of sight of the Security Council … The UK had no part in those </p>
<p>negotiations.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Cabinet was informed on 9 May that a revised system of sanctions was likely to be </p>
<p>adopted by the UN.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The Security Council adopted resolution 1409 on Iraq on 14 May. It introduced </p>
<p>a new sanctions regime, with a revised GRL and new procedures for applications for </p>
<p>licences to trade with Iraq, with effect from 30 May. Trade in commodities or products, </p>

<p>still had to be scrutinised by the Office of the Iraq Programme, the UN Monitoring, </p>
<p>Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy </p>
<p>Agency (IAEA), and the 661 Committee; and exporters would still be paid through the </p>
<p>UN escrow account established by resolution 986 (1995) only after verification by UN </p>
<p>agents that items had arrived in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> Although the resolution was adopted unanimously, Syria made a statement arguing </p>
<p>that it was time to lift sanctions against Iraq; it was unreasonable to impose sanctions </p>
<p>for an unlimited period of time; and the Council had lost credibility by compelling some </p>
<p>countries, and not others, to implement its resolutions. Syria rejected the “double </p>
<p>standards … whereby Israel carried out its policy of blatant aggression against the </p>
<p>Palestinian people, despite the statements of United Nations representatives concerning </p>
<p>the war crimes that it [Israel] committed in Jenin”.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> There was no reference in either the resolution or any statements in the Security </p>
<p>Council to the need for clarification of resolution 1284 (1999) as requested by Iraq in its </p>
<p>meeting with Mr Annan. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> Nor was there discussion of a renewed call for Iraq to permit weapons inspectors to </p>
<p>return to Iraq. That remained the subject of continuing talks between Iraq and Mr Annan </p>
<p>and debate between the five Permanent Members (P5) of the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Mr Straw informed Cabinet on 16 May that resolution 1409 had been adopted, </p>
<p>and that the provision to limit scrutiny by the UN sanctions committee to applications </p>
<p>to export military and dual-use equipment was a significant step forward in ensuring </p>
<p>that the sanctions regime could not legitimately be blamed for causing humanitarian </p>
<p>problems in Iraq.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>43. </b> There was no further discussion of the policy. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> In his written statement to the Inquiry, Mr Carne Ross, First Secretary responsible </p>
<p>for the Middle East at the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York, stated that the </p>
<p>UK’s position on Iraq was under “unceasing pressure, mainly from Iraq’s allies” in the </p>
<p>Security Council:</p>
<p>“… for sanctions to be eased to reward Iraq for past progress in disarming itself … </p>
<p>and to incentivise Iraq to co-operate once more with the weapons inspectors. </p>
<p>There was also significant concern over the humanitarian impact of sanctions … </p>
<p>There was also a broader complaint, particularly in the Arab world, that the US/UK </p>
<p>practised double standards in demanding the full implementation of resolutions on </p>

<p>the occupied Palestinian territories.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Other points made by Mr Ross in his statement included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… it was not our view in New York that containment was collapsing either </p>
<p>through the ineffectiveness of sanctions or the deterioration of international </p>
<p>support. While there were serious sanctions breaches, it was not the UK </p>
<p>judgement that these permitted significant rearmament, which was our major </p>
<p>concern …”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… the collapse of effective sanctions was not a foregone conclusion, as some </p>
<p>witnesses have misleadingly suggested … we undertook … sustained and </p>
<p>detailed work … to end Iraq’s manipulation of the official price of its oil exports, </p>
<p>so that it could extract an illegal ‘surcharge’ …”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… the UK never made any co-ordinated and sustained attempt to address </p>
<p>sanctions busting.”</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Ross subsequently told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It [containment] was a continuing state, and … to maintain containment you </p>
<p>had to constantly adjust it.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… It is astonishing to me … that neither the US nor the UK did anything about </p>
<p>Saddam’s illegal bank accounts which we knew to exist in Jordan.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Nobody questioned at all in the Security Council that the arms embargo should </p>
<p>be lifted. I don’t think there was a single country that said at any point we should </p>
<p>let Iraq import arms again. I think the question was: what kind of controls, short </p>
<p>of that, do we really need to make sure that Iraq’s WMD is controlled …”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>47. </b> Asked about pursuing resolution 1409 while the Bush Administration was planning </p>
<p>regime change, Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It was entirely natural to me that we should try and maximise containment of Iraq </p>
<p>because I didn’t see an alternative … So it was very welcome that we had a smart </p>
<p>sanctions regime in [resolution] 1409, although that didn’t mean … that there weren’t </p>
<p>other aspects of policy on Iraq that needed to be followed up.</p>
<p>“We needed to curtail smuggling, which was increasing through Jordan, Syria and </p>
<p>Turkey, and which Secretary Powell had not expended a huge amount of effort on </p>
<p>behalf of his Administration to close from early 2001 onwards, which surprised me.”</p>

<p><b>48. </b> Subsequently, Sir Jeremy added:</p>
<p>“Somehow, the need to stop smuggling through Syria got caught up with the need </p>
<p>not to offend or to make too expensive the Turkish and Jordanian angles to this </p>
<p>… I regarded it as a pity that more pressure was not put on all three because the </p>
<p>business of smuggling was more important than the business of maintaining that </p>
<p>part of the relationship with those three countries … I understood that was the </p>
<p>choice of the United States, not to expend capital on stopping the smuggling … </p>
<p>there were equivocal views within the US Administration about how much effort and </p>
<p>energy and capital to expend on maintaining sanctions and a containment regime </p>
<p>that might, anyway, not do the trick.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the fact that the provisions to tighten the borders could </p>
<p>not be agreed with Russia was important, and that, while the sanctions framework </p>
<p>agreed in the resolution might have been successful, it was “at least as persuasive </p>
<p>an argument that it wouldn’t have been”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>50. </b> Asked whether containment was still the policy of Government, Lord Wilson of </p>
<p>Dinton, Cabinet Secretary from January 1998 to September 2002, responded: </p>
<p>“… Containment was the status quo … No-one questioned it. No-one said, ‘… </p>
<p>Let’s discontinue that as a policy.’ It was noted as a success … After that [Cabinet </p>
<p>discussion on 16 May 2002] there was no further discussion of containment … for </p>
<p>it to end you would need to have a discussion about it. There was no discussion </p>
<p>about it.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Lord Wilson stated that Mr Blair had been disappointed that concessions had been </p>
<p>made to secure Russian support for the resolution, and regarded it as a significant </p>
<p>weakness.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Lord Wilson, told the Inquiry that the “Americans had got engaged in getting it </p>

<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>53. </b> In his memoir, published in 2012, Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“… resolution 1409 was inadequate and stood no chance of plugging the gaping </p>
<p>holes in the sanctions framework. This failure to get comprehensive and robust </p>
<p>‘smart sanctions’ effectively marked the end of the ‘containment’ policy, especially </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>54. </b> In early May 2002, the international effort to resolve the India/Pakistan crisis was </p>
<p>the FCO’s principal foreign policy concern and the major preoccupation for Mr Straw, </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), and Mr Peter Ricketts, </p>
<p>FCO Political Director. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… The main thing in April, May, into June … was India, Pakistan. Can I impress </p>
<p>on this Committee that was far more important than Iraq. The Middle East Peace </p>
<p>Process was far more important than Iraq … Iraq was not the major thing in those </p>
<p>months. The Queen Mother had died; Alastair Campbell was involved in a row with </p>
<p>Black Rod; street crime … There were all sorts of issues around which engaged </p>
<p>attention. </p>
<p>“If you had said to me ‘Where are we on Iraq?’ I would have said: ‘Things are going </p>
<p>on, No.10 has started talking to Washington.’ But nothing major.”</p>

<p><b>Discussions with the US and France</b></p>
<p><b>56.  In discussions with the US, Mr Straw and Sir David Manning confirmed </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s position that the UK would support the US if President Bush decided </b></p>
<p><b>on military action.</b></p>
<p><b>57.  In a meeting with Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National Security </b></p>
<p><b>Advisor, on 17 May, Sir David set out what he described as the conditions </b></p>
<p><b>“stipulated” by Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Blair had a meeting on Iraq with Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce on 2 May </p>
<p>but there is no record of the discussion.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Iraq was not discussed at Cabinet that day.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> In a discussion on 8 May, Mr Straw told Mr Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, </p>
<p>that Mr Blair “had always taken the view that if in the end President Bush decided on </p>
<p>military action, the UK had a duty to support him”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Mr Straw wrote that:</p>
<p>“… the rhetoric (in the US) might get beyond what was possible. Powell agreed this </p>
<p>was a considerable danger. I had rather gathered that the more military options were </p>

<p>15</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Sir David Manning was in Washington on 17 May, for discussions on a range of </p>
<p>issues including India and Pakistan and the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP).</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>63. </b> In preparation for Sir David Manning’s visit to Washington, Sir Christopher Meyer </p>
<p>reported in a personal letter that he had been told by a senior official in the State </p>
<p>Department that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The timeframe discussed between the Prime Minister and Bush was still valid: </p>
<p>the first quarter of next year was “realistic” for action against Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CENTCOM was hearing from British military sources that we were </p>
<p>contemplating contributing an armoured division.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>This was serious stuff which was leading Administration hawks to forget the </p>
<p>“but” in our “yes, but …”</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Sir Christopher also recorded that it was doubtful that much work had been done </p>
<p>on handling the UN and getting the weapons inspectors back in and that the nightmare </p>
<p>would be if Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, judged that the Iraqis were </p>
<p>co-operating and the US did not.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Sir Christopher advised that the UK had “been drawn into a fierce inter-agency </p>
<p>battle on the Middle East and Iraq”. That was “unavoidable if we are to retain a handle </p>
<p>on what is going on [in] areas of vital importance to our national interest. But it does </p>
<p>mean that we have to tread with the greatest care”. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> Sir Christopher told the Inquiry, that he had been told by a senior American official </p>
<p>“shortly after Crawford” that there were problems with the UK’s “yes, but” approach: </p>
<p>“the ‘yes’ was greedily devoured by the American Administration, but the ‘buts’ had kind </p>
<p>of faded away”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>67. </b> In discussions with Dr Rice on Iraq, Sir David told her that the UK’s “offer of military </p>
<p>support for a campaign against Saddam was firm. But we must go the UN inspectors </p>
<p>route first; we must stabilise Arab/Israel … and we must prepare public opinion.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He was assured that the UK would be brought into the planning process at a very </p>
<p>early stage, once such planning got under way. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> In a separate report to Mr Blair, Sir David warned that, in the light of the US </p>

<p> Sir David reported that he </p>
<p>had twice made very clear to Dr Rice that:</p>
<p>“… before we would commit to military action, we must exhaust the UN inspectors </p>
<p>route; there must be progress in stabilising Arab/Israel; and there must be a </p>
<p>campaign to explain the Saddam menace to domestic and international public </p>

<p><b>69. </b> In a meeting with Mr Richard Armitage, the US Deputy Secretary of State, Sir David </p>
<p>Manning had been told that “a UK officer at Tampa had said that the UK would provide </p>
<p>an armoured division”. That had been “dropped into the conversation” of the most senior </p>
<p>US policy-makers.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>70. </b> Asked about that meeting and the fact that Mr Armitage had been told that Mr Blair </p>
<p>had discussed the question of a British armoured division taking part in the invasion </p>
<p>with President Bush at Crawford, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry: “Yes I didn’t </p>
<p>know that.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Sir David subsequently stated:</p>
<p>“I think the message that he [Mr Blair] wanted to be with the Americans in the broad </p>
<p>sense would be correct … throughout the crisis he felt if push came to shove, the </p>
<p>Americans should not be left to do this on their own. But I think at this stage still </p>
<p>he believes there may be a better way to do this, and I think his willingness to </p>
<p>stay engaged will also have been a calculation that that would have improved the </p>
<p>chances of persuading the Americans to go back to the UN.</p>
<p>“So I don’t myself think … in April or May … he had made his mind up he was going </p>
<p>to send troops. I think he was always ready to do it, but always hoped he wouldn’t </p>
<p>have to.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>72. </b> Asked, in the context of an offer of a division, whether the military planners were </p>
<p>getting ahead of the policy, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he was:</p>
<p>“… surprised they had said that because certainly later … when there is a request </p>
<p>from the MOD to the Prime Minister to give an indication of what he would be willing </p>
<p>to sign up for, he refuses. So it doesn’t seem logical to me.”</p>
<p>38</p>

<p>17</p>
<p><b>74.  In a meeting with French officials, Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle </b></p>
<p><b>East and North Africa, stated that a continuing threat of US action was needed </b></p>
<p><b>to influence Iraqi behaviour, whatever some might think of the consequences </b></p>
<p><b>of the threat.</b></p>
<p><b>75. </b> Following a visit to Paris by Mr Chaplin, the British Embassy Paris reported that </p>
<p>officials in the French Foreign Ministry:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>did not expect much movement in Iraq’s third meeting with Mr Annan in Vienna, </p>
<p>which was best described as a dialogue not a negotiation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>were looking to see how to raise the dialogue with Iraq to persuade it to agree </p>
<p>the return of inspectors but were sceptical about whether Iraq would agree a </p>
<p>regime similar to that which had applied until 1998;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>took the firm position that Iraq had to make clear its willingness to agree the </p>
<p>return of inspectors before talks on clarification of resolution 1284 (1999) could </p>
<p>start; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>were less convinced than before that US military action was inevitable; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>saw the return of inspectors as the best way to avoid military action and would </p>
<p>want to maintain the unity of the P5 as the means to deliver it.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>76. </b> In relation to UN authority for military action, a French official stated:</p>
<p>“… past precedent demonstrated that formal authorisation by the UN was not </p>
<p>an absolute requirement for military action. What would be indispensable, as a </p>
<p>minimum, would be a statement by the Security Council (not necessarily in the form </p>
<p>of a SCR [Security Council resolution]) that Iraq was in breach of its obligations, </p>
<p>and a warning making clear to Iraq what the consequences of a continued violation </p>
<p>would be. The Quai had given this advice to Chirac [Mr Jacques Chirac, President of </p>
<p>France] for his meeting with Bush.” </p>
<p><b>77. </b> Another French official stated that the US had no answer to the question of what </p>
<p>would happen “the day after”. The Kurds and Shia were ready to come in behind the </p>
<p>US, but would not go out ahead of them. The greatest fear of ordinary Iraqis was what </p>
<p>would come after Saddam Hussein “with or without US intervention”. The Shia were in </p>
<p>a majority, but there was no question of the leadership being anything other than Sunni. </p>
<p>It was far from clear that the Republican Guard would be able to keep control if there </p>
<p>was a change of regime.</p>

<p><b>79. </b> A French official agreed, adding:</p>

<p><b>Definition of the UK’s objective</b></p>
<p><b>82.  Mr Hoon advised Mr Blair on 31 May that he and Mr Straw had agreed a </b></p>
<p><b>preliminary UK objective to guide planning which, rather than calling directly for </b></p>
<p><b>the elimination of Iraq’s WMD capability, called on Iraq to abide by its international </b></p>
<p><b>obligations on WMD. </b></p>
<p><b>83. </b> The first meeting of the Pigott Group in late April considered how to define the </p>
<p>objective, or “end state” of a military operation.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“As we found in the run-up to the Afghanistan operation, defining the objective of an </p>
<p>operation is crucial … The MOD had tried their hand at a definition of the ‘end-state’ </p>
<p>which was discussed at length, and I undertook to produce a further version.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I have now done so … it would be helpful to know whether the Foreign Secretary </p>
<p>thinks we are on the right lines. At this stage, it is only to inform MOD contingency </p>
<p>planning: at the right point, these issues would have to be negotiated carefully and </p>
<p>at a high level with the Americans, who will have their own priorities. My proposal </p>
<p>is as follows:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>‘A stable and law-abiding Iraq, within its present borders, co-operating with the </p>
<p>international community, no longer posing a threat to global security or to its </p>
<p>neighbours, and abiding by its international obligations on control of its WMD.’”</p>

<p><b>84. </b> Mr Ricketts added that three issues had been debated in the Pigott Group:</p>
<p>“… should there be specific reference to regime change, e.g. ‘no longer governed by </p>
<p>its current leadership’? My own view is that regime change would be a by-product </p>
<p>of a military operation not its objective (indeed, I believe such an objective would </p>
<p>be illegal);</p>
<p>“… should the ‘end state’ be stated more explicitly as the removal of Iraqi WMD </p>
<p>or (more achievable) the removal of the threat posed by Iraqi WMD? There is a </p>
<p>serious issue here of the credibility of any objective we declare for a campaign, </p>
<p>since any likely future Iraqi regime would presumably feel the same national security </p>
<p>imperatives for pursuing WMD programmes as the current regime, given potential </p>
<p>threats from Iran. My formula above concentrates on Iraq abiding by its UNSCR </p>
<p>[UN Security Council resolution] undertakings. But as an alternative I think it would </p>
<p>be credible to aim at an ‘end state’ in which the threat posed by Iraqi WMD was </p>
<p>removed (i.e. behaviour change if not regime change);</p>
<p>“… should there be anything more explicit about a future regime abiding by </p>
<p>international norms on the treatment of its own population? I have got ‘law abiding’ </p>
<p>which is designed to capture that. There is a risk of overloading a definition of the </p>
<p>‘end state’ with desirable outcomes which cannot be achieved by military means.”</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Mr Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser, responded: </p>
<p>“In the event of military action, we should need to be satisfied that there was a </p>
<p>proper legal basis, and what we say publicly would need to be consistent with that </p>
<p>legal basis.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>86. </b> Mr Wood agreed that regime change could not of itself be a lawful objective of </p>
<p>military action. He also warned that: </p>
<p>“Some of the elements in your proposed objective or ‘end state’ would not justify </p>
<p>military action … The mere possession of nuclear weapons, or indeed a general risk </p>
<p>that they may be used, does not bring into play the right of self-defence … If, on the </p>
<p>other hand, the legal basis were to be authorisation by the Security Council, any </p>
<p>action would need to be within the four corners of that authorisation. The Security </p>
<p>Council has not authorised the use of force to establish ‘a stable and law abiding </p>
<p>Iraq … cooperating with the international community’ or ‘regime change’. It follows </p>
<p>from the above that the language you propose in … your minute could not serve as </p>
<p>the public aim of any military action.” </p>

<p><b>87. </b> On 3 May, Mr Ricketts sent a very slightly amended definition of the end state, </p>
<p>agreed by Mr Straw, to Mr Webb: </p>
<p>“A stable and law-abiding Iraq, within its present borders, co-operating with </p>
<p>the international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or to </p>
<p>international security, and abiding by its international obligations on control of </p>
<p>its WMD.”</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>The previous reference to “global security” was replaced by “international security”. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> Mr Ricketts added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the end state were to be used “as a public justification for military action”, </p>
<p>it would be “necessary to add whatever legal base was approved by the </p>
<p>Attorney General”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“For the record, the Foreign Secretary was strongly against any specific </p>
<p>reference to ‘regime change’.” </p>
<p><b>89. </b> Mr Webb’s response of 10 May recorded that there was some discussion in the </p>
<p>Pigott Group about the language on WMD on the grounds that a follow-on regime </p>
<p>might only be happy if it retained some WMD as long as its neighbours continued to </p>
<p>do the same.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> He suggested that the end state should be amended to “abiding by its </p>
<p>international obligations on WMD”.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> On the question of legal justification, Mr Webb noted Mr Straw’s caution but added: </p>
<p>“I presume … we are all still working to the line in the Prime Minister’s Crawford </p>
<p>speech that it might become justified and necessary. Consistent with that we see </p>
<p>it as a likely – though not certain – way point in a campaign to secure the strategic </p>
<p>objective. Following the meeting we have proposed to the Defence Secretary we </p>
<p>take forward rapidly two distinct pieces of work, one on military <i>contingency planning</i> </p>
<p>… and the other on <i>coalition options</i> which will need to factor in legal considerations. </p>
<p>Rather than submitting our Ministers’ conclusions to the Attorney General for his </p>
<p>approval, we should prefer the usual approach of his putting advice to colleagues </p>
<p>as part of a collective decision.” </p>

<p>The elimination of WMD by Iraq should be a firm objective. The view that an Iraq </p>

<p>The US “understood – and even seemed to accept – the Foreign Secretary’s </p>
<p>point that regime change should not be an objective in its own right but a point </p>
<p>on a path to a stable Iraq”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Department of Defense (DoD) official said that “no one in Washington now </p>
<p>thought that replacement of Saddam by another military strong man now </p>
<p>made sense: the US would end up being responsible for his actions even </p>
<p>if he went wrong on them”. The official was looking more to a government </p>
<p>which “represented a wide range of tribal groups”, while acknowledging that </p>
<p>democracy would be unlikely. Mr Webb commented that this “does not … chime” </p>
<p>with the views of others in the US. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US “clearly envisage remaining in Iraq for some time” but had taken </p>
<p>Mr Webb’s point that “permanent basing would create an adverse reaction in </p>
<p>the region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Momentum in Washington had “flagged” since his last conversations in February; </p>

<p><b>99.  Mr Blair decided that the UK should not expose the constraints it faced to </b></p>
<p><b>Secretary Rumsfeld. </b></p>
<p><b>100. </b> In advance of a visit by Secretary Rumsfeld, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 31 May </p>
<p>with an update on the military contingency planning on Iraq.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>101. </b> The minute was also sent to Mr Brown, Mr Straw and Sir Richard Wilson, </p>
<p>Cabinet Secretary. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> Mr Hoon advised Mr Blair that the MOD had been taking forward contingency </p>
<p>planning in the absence of discussions with the US, but: “To make further progress we </p>
<p>now need greater clarity on US thinking.” </p>
<p><b>103. </b> Detailed work showed that the UK would not be able significantly to contribute </p>
<p>offensive operations before the end of November 2002 because of the constraints of </p>
<p>operations in Afghanistan on air transport. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the key message from the contingency planning exercise </p>
<p>was that:</p>
<p>“… if we wish to contribute meaningfully to any operation our Armed Forces would </p>
<p>need plenty of warning time … We are clear that, for the UK to have influence on </p>
<p>detailed planning, the US would require a significant contribution to any large scale </p>
<p>operation. Our own analysis indicates that this would have to be at division level </p>
<p>for land forces …” </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Hoon also stated that, to plan properly, the UK needed to know:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what outcome the US was seeking;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>when the US might wish to take action; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how long the US saw itself remaining in Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Hoon added that the UK needed to clarify the policy basis and legal justification </p>
<p>for any action. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Hoon identified that the UK faced a dilemma:</p>
<p>“On the one hand, if we discuss the detail and timescales of a potential UK military </p>
<p>contribution to a US-led coalition, it could send a misleading signal that we have </p>
<p>decided to support a specific line of military action. (Such a signal could be used </p>
<p>in Washington by the supporters of military action to promote their cause.) Equally </p>
<p>if we are not clear with the US at this stage about our military constraints, we face </p>
<p>the danger of our not being able to bring anything meaningful to the table at the </p>
<p>right time and the consequent loss of influence that would bring. Finally it could be </p>

<p>precisely our readiness to participate that would allow you to counsel the President </p>
<p>against proceeding if no convincing plan were to emerge.”</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Reflecting on the approach the UK should adopt with Secretary Rumsfeld, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon recommended: </p>
<p>“… there would be more mileage in raising practicalities. I would make clear that our </p>
<p>conditions for involvement in military action remain as you have set them out: public </p>
<p>opinion would need to be prepared; the UN inspectors would need to be given every </p>
<p>chance of success; and there would have to be an adequate degree of stability in </p>
<p>the Arab/Israel conflict.”</p>
<p><b>108. </b> Mr Hoon added: </p>
<p>“Further, by raising in general terms, that our contingency planning has shown </p>
<p>we need plenty of warning in order to be able to contribute to military action </p>
<p>I would reinforce the need for the UK to be exposed fully to US thinking as soon </p>
<p>as possible.” </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Blair wrote alongside the last point: “No. That will send a wobbly message.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>110.  Mr Blair’s decision on the tactics to be adopted demonstrated he did not </b></p>
<p><b>intend to set “conditions” for UK support for the US. He was focusing on the </b></p>

<p><b>111.  Mr Blair told Secretary Rumsfeld that the UK would be with the US in any </b></p>

<p><b>112. </b> Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, advised </p>

<p>24</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Hoon met Secretary Rumsfeld on 5 June.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> The record of the </p>
<p>discussion on Iraq confirmed that the US would begin discussions with the UK at the </p>
<p>military level.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Mr Blair commented that “removing Saddam would be excellent for the Iraqi </p>
<p>people and for the Middle East region”, and that “The UK would be with the US in any </p>
<p>military action.” That would best be done “by ensuring a broad coalition of support and </p>
<p>acquiescence” and avoiding “unintended consequences” which might arise “if military </p>
<p>action occurred while the Arab world were hostile”. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Regional countries would want the territorial integrity of Iraq maintained and to </p>
<p>know what the long-term plan for Iraq would be. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> Mr Blair expected Saddam Hussein to “play this cleverly, trying to draw us into </p>
<p>a debate about UN weapons inspectors etc”. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr Blair told Mr Rumsfeld that he had “not yet decided about public handling”. </p>
<p>The UN inspectors would be “important for European opinion”. In Mr Blair’s view: </p>
<p>“Some would say that a further UNSCR would be required, but in the end they might … </p>
<p>accept a final demand for unconditional access for the inspectors. We had to avoid a </p>
<p>negotiation with Saddam … we would probably be in a better position with an ultimatum </p>
<p>that Saddam refused than with no ultimatum.” In his view “the WMD threat provided </p>
<p>a sufficient reason for action against Saddam” but building up “a public picture of the </p>
<p>history of the regime” would help convince European opinion of the need for action </p>
<p>against Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Washington, </p>
<p>reported on 7 June that Mr Blair’s message at College Station to Saddam Hussein on </p>
<p>the weapons inspectors had “heavily influenced” the US views on the UK’s approach </p>
<p>towards inspections, “particularly in the NSC [National Security Council] and OSD [Office </p>

<p>one, though it did not significantly add to our knowledge of the US position.” </p>

<p>.</p>
<p> The MOD say </p>

<p>other hand, the need to be able to assure the US that we will not face insuperable </p>

<p>asked Mr Blair: “We were not finding ourselves getting involved in some strange military </p>
<p>action by the United States, were we? There is not something happening here?” Mr Blair </p>

<p><b>Development of UK policy, July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>137.  Sir David Manning asked Mr Hoon for further advice on the steps which </b></p>
<p><b>would be necessary to keep open the option of a deploying a large scale force </b></p>
<p><b>by the end of the year.</b></p>
<p><b>138.  Sir David also asked that military planners should make the conditions for </b></p>
<p><b>UK involvement in military operations clear to their US counterparts.</b></p>
<p><b>139. </b> Sir David Manning wrote to Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private </p>
<p>Secretary, on 25 June stating that, in response to Mr Hoon’s minute of 31 May, </p>
<p>Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… asked for further advice on precisely what steps would have to be taken now, </p>
<p>including financial commitments … to keep open the possibility of deploying a </p>
<p>large scale force by the end of this year – bearing in mind that we might not get </p>
<p>six months’ warning.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Sir David wrote that it was “encouraging that following the Rumsfeld visit, our </p>
<p>military planners have now been invited to discussions with the US” (see Section 6.1). </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“It will be important, as the Defence Secretary acknowledged in his minute, </p>
<p>to make clear the conditions for UK involvement in military action set out by the </p>
<p>Prime Minister. Public opinion needs to be prepared, the UN inspectors’ route needs </p>
<p>to be given every chance of success and there must be progress in tackling the </p>
<p>Arab/Israel crisis.”</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning on 26 June reporting that the US was </p>
<p>understood to be seeking:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the removal of the Hussein regime;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the neutralisation of WMD within Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the elimination of a safe haven for terrorists;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an acceptable new government.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Watkins stated that the US goals:</p>
<p>“… broadly align with the objective previously agreed by the Foreign and Defence </p>
<p>Secretaries … although Mr Hoon understands that Mr Straw, rightly, sees removal </p>
<p>of Saddam as a way point – if necessary and justified – to the final outcome rather </p>
<p>than an objective in its own right.” </p>

<p><b>143. </b> A small MOD team would be going to Washington and the CENTCOM HQ in </p>
<p>Tampa, Florida “immediately”. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> The letter concluded that Mr Hoon believed Ministers would need clarity on:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the Prime Minister’s conditions are likely to be met;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the viability of the proposed military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the policy and legal framework in which military action is justified;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>overall, whether the prospective outcome looked worth the risks, costs </p>
<p>and losses.”</p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon asks for a collective discussion on Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>145.  The MOD advised that military planning in the US was taking place in a </b></p>
<p><b>policy void and President Bush would be briefed on an updated plan in August. </b></p>
<p><b>CENTCOM would be in a position to activate that plan.</b></p>
<p><b>146.  Mr Hoon was concerned about the US approach. He suggested Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>should call an early meeting of Ministers to consider how best to get the US </b></p>
<p><b>to address the strategic, as opposed to the narrowly military, dimension.</b></p>
<p><b>147. </b> On 2 July, Mr Watkins reported to Sir David Manning that “US military thinking is </p>
<p>quite well advanced”, but US planners were assuming offensive operations to overthrow </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “in a policy void”.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The US “end state to be achieved after conflict” </p>
<p>had not been identified, and there seemed to be no “overarching campaign strategy for </p>
<p>dealing with Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> An updated plan would be briefed to President Bush in August, and the US </p>
<p>planning was designed “to put CENTCOM in a position to be able to activate their plan </p>
<p>from August 2002 onwards”. A “de facto invitation to the UK and Australia to participate” </p>
<p>was “now on the table”. The plan would require availability of bases and support from </p>
<p>Kuwait, Jordan and Turkey. </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Watkins reported that Mr Hoon intended to respond positively to the </p>
<p>invitation for a small number of British planners to join US planning teams; that was </p>
<p>“essential in helping to inform the MOD’s own thinking” so that Mr Hoon could make </p>
<p>recommendations. But Mr Hoon was: </p>
<p>“… very conscious that decisions about a military contribution cannot be made in </p>
<p>the absence of a coherent and integrated strategic framework. An agreed strategy </p>
<p>will be key to taking matters forward, not simply to provide justification for military </p>
<p>action, but to clarify timelines; to incorporate the Prime Minister’s conditions for </p>
<p>UK participation; and to establish the framework for an information campaign. </p>
<p>The draft public document, which you are currently considering, would ultimately </p>

<p>29</p>
<p>form an important part of that campaign. He suggests that the Prime Minister </p>
<p>may like to call an early meeting of a small group of colleagues to consider how </p>
<p>best to get the US to address the strategic, as opposed to the narrowly military, </p>
<p>dimension. The freestanding military option is not a viable political proposition.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, officials from the MOD, FCO and Cabinet Office should do some more </p>
<p>homework urgently to put the Prime Minister and you in a better position to influence </p>
<p>the President’s and Condi Rice’s thinking … before the updated CENTCOM plan </p>
<p>is briefed to the President in the course of August. Mr Hoon will also review the </p>
<p>possibilities for contact with the US Defense Secretary.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Watkins’ letter was paraphrased in a briefing note for Mr Blair from </p>
<p>Sir David Manning, which drew attention to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the comment on the policy void in which military planning had taken place;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the scale and cost of the US plans;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the fragility of the logistic concept;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US ignorance of Iraqi WMD locations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of clarity about what the US might ask the UK to do;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for basing in the region; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the use of British bases in Diego Garcia and Cyprus.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>151. </b> Sir David also reported Mr Hoon’s suggestion for an early meeting and advised </p>
<p>that funding and legal issues would need to be considered “before we go much </p>
<p>further”. He proposed Mr Brown, Mr Straw, Sir Richard Wilson, Sir Richard Dearlove, </p>
<p>Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), Mr John Scarlett, Chairman of the JIC, </p>
<p>and Lord Goldsmith should attend. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> Manuscript notes on the minute by Mr Powell suggested to Mr Blair that Mr Brown </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Asked why Mr Brown and Ms Short had not been invited to the meeting, which </p>
<p>took place on 23 July, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We were discussing then what was likely to happen in relation to the politics and </p>
<p>the diplomacy, particularly in relation to the military …</p>
<p>“We were also discussing this at Cabinet level too, and obviously we were in close </p>

<p><b>Sir Kevin Tebbit’s advice, 3 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>154.  Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Mr Hoon on 3 July setting out his concerns about </b></p>
<p><b>the absence of a strategic framework for the military plan and the dilemma for </b></p>
<p><b>the UK that being drawn into US planning potentially posed. </b></p>
<p><b>155.  Sir Kevin concluded that the UK could not count on a military campaign </b></p>
<p><b>being unlikely or, if the US went ahead, that the UK could avoid being linked to </b></p>
<p><b>the campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>156.  Sir Kevin advised that a “credible political plan”, which addressed the </b></p>
<p><b>conditions for UK participation and moved American planning into acceptable </b></p>
<p><b>channels and slowed it down, was needed.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>157. </b> Having seen a draft of Mr Watkins’ letter to No.10, Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Hoon on 3 July setting out a number of concerns.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>158. </b> Sir Kevin advised:</p>
<p>“While I have no objection to … the course of action proposed I think we should be </p>
<p>under no illusions about the extent of the stakes as presented, or the need to raise </p>
<p>our Whitehall game, politically, diplomatically, financially as well as militarily if we </p>
<p>are to proceed further. This is not to say that I do not support the idea of engaging in </p>
<p>planning … nor even that we should not agree to participate in an operation against </p>
<p>Iraq if the conditions are acceptable, but the task ahead is formidable.</p>
<p>“… The picture … is of a military plan being worked up in a policy vacuum, with </p>
<p>no strategic framework which paves the way; in terms of rationale, preparation of </p>
<p>public opinion through threat assessments, WMD risks and the like, or creation of </p>
<p>the legal base; and no clearly defined end state, in terms of successor government </p>
<p>and relations with the Arab world. There will, I suspect, be a natural tendency for </p>
<p>Ministerial colleagues … to run a mile from what may appear at first (and second) </p>
<p>sight to be a harebrained scheme with all sorts of costs and risks attached.</p>
<p>“Ministers will need to be helped over that hump. It may be that an Iraq campaign </p>
<p>is unlikely to happen, given the problems … But we certainly cannot count on that </p>
<p>or that we could avoid being linked to a US military campaign if it did happen … </p>
<p>I do not think it is a responsible option for us to let matters run without greater active </p>
<p>engagement designed seriously to influence US conceptual as well as operational </p>
<p>thinking, albeit at the risk that we could end up converting an unviable plan into </p>
<p>a credible one.</p>

<p>31</p>
<p>“Secondly there is the difficulty of confronting the US Administration itself about </p>
<p>the need to produce a credible political plan … (and without which the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s conditions for UK participation could not be met) … we need to move </p>
<p>with considerably more urgency to seek to move American planning into acceptable </p>
<p>channels and basically I would judge, to slow it down. This is particularly the case </p>
<p>when a major element in the strategic preparation we would want to see is concerted </p>
<p>diplomatic effort to secure agreement to resumed WMD inspections by the UN both </p>
<p>for its own sake and to ease the problems of public opinion and legal base. This [is] </p>
<p>in addition to the need for prior progress on Arab/Israel and, perhaps, getting further </p>
<p>on the road to success in Afghanistan …”</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Sir Kevin concluded that the UK needed “some early careful engagement with </p>
<p>the US policy machine, rather than just with the Pentagon”. He would be “visiting </p>
<p>Washington on 17-19 July and could carry messages but that would, of course, depend </p>
<p>on prior Ministerial guidance”.</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit’s minute was sent after Mr Watkins’ letter to Sir David Manning </p>

<p>views of Secretary Powell or Dr Rice; and there was a risk “that the PM’s conditions will </p>
<p>be simply sidelined”.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that getting involved in US planning had posed </p>
<p>a dilemma because:</p>
<p>“… it was clear … even at that stage, if one begins discussions with the United </p>
<p>States on the military track, albeit without commitment, it becomes increasingly </p>
<p>difficult to keep options open absolutely completely … [W]e made it clear to them </p>
<p>that our participation … was purely to inform British Government thinking …</p>
<p>“On the one hand, if one is drawn into discussion of timescales and details, we might </p>
<p>give misleading signals of support for military action that was not present at that </p>
<p>stage.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, if we continued to stand aside, it might be too late for us to </p>
<p>influence events or meet the political requirement which might be placed on us.”</p>

<p>32</p>
<p><b>164.  The JIC judged that disintegration of the regime would be most likely if Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>ground forces were being comprehensively defeated; if top military officers could </b></p>
<p><b>be persuaded that their fate was not irrevocably tied to that of Saddam Hussein; </b></p>
<p><b>or if Saddam Hussein were to be killed.</b></p>
<p><b>165. </b> The JIC assessed on 27 February 2002 (see Section 3.2) that the Iraqi opposition </p>
<p>would be unable to overthrow Saddam Hussein’s regime without direct intervention on </p>
<p>the ground.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment of “how cohesion of the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime is maintained and how the regime would fare under pressure or attack” on </p>
<p>4 July.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>167. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion of the draft paper described it as:</p>
<p>“… an important paper with a specific focus. It would be of interest to Ministers more </p>
<p>because of its context, with decisions yet to be taken about what to do with Iraq, </p>
<p>than because of its analysis, which was familiar rather than novel. </p>
<p>“Its key message was that although Saddam Hussein’s regime was remarkably </p>
<p>resilient to pressure … the demonstration of a real and overwhelming international </p>
<p>determination and ability to remove the regime through military force was the likeliest </p>
<p>way to bring it down … </p>
<p>“Experience in Afghanistan had shown that generating expectations and influencing </p>
<p>people’s perceptions of what might happen had considerable capacity to effect real </p>
<p>and rapid change … </p>
<p>“… the paper needed to analyse … in more detail the nature of Saddam’s support … </p>
<p>The motives for each set of supporters were different … These mattered because </p>
<p>under pressure the different groups would behave differently. </p>
<p>“UK policy makers, and military planners, would be keen before too long to identify </p>
<p>the point at which self-interested loyalty for Saddam might turn into disillusionment, </p>
<p>fragility and fragmentation.”</p>

<p>3.3  |  Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The clear prospect of a major attack would put the regime under unprecedented </p>
<p>pressure. But regime cohesion is unlikely to collapse in the absence of a large scale </p>
<p>invasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam relies on a mixture of patronage and extreme fear to retain power and </p>
<p>contain opposition. Real loyalty and support for his regime is confined to the top </p>
<p>of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Republican Guard (SRG) and the Republican Guard Forces Command </p>
<p>(RGFC) are more reliable than the Regular Army (RA). All would initially fight a </p>
<p>US-led attack. Once the regime was perceived as doomed the military’s will to fight </p>
<p>on would be sorely tested.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regime disintegration would be most likely if Iraqi ground forces were being </p>
<p>comprehensively defeated; if top military officers could be persuaded that their fate </p>
<p>was not irrevocably tied to that of Saddam; or if Saddam himself were to be killed. </p>
<p>Military units are more likely to suffer mass desertions than revolt as coherent units.” </p>
<p><b>169. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>“Saddam and his regime have proved durable …</p>
<p>“The Iraqi military are aware of their vulnerability to air power, probably their greatest </p>
<p>weakness; their main way of mitigating this is through dispersal, including into </p>
<p>urban areas […] We have only fragmentary intelligence indicating how the regime </p>
<p>might deal with an all-out attack including ground forces. <b>But we assess that only </b></p>
<p><b>massive military force could be guaranteed to topple Saddam</b>.” </p>
<p><b>170. </b> Addressing the policy implications of the Assessment, the JIC stated: “Saddam </p>
<p>and his regime must be convinced that any move to topple him is serious and likely </p>
<p>to succeed before they begin to feel the pressure.” </p>
<p><b>The Treasury’s concerns</b></p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Hoon’s proposal prompted Mr William Nye, Head of the Treasury Defence, </p>
<p>Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, to advise Mr Brown that he should write to the MOD </p>
<p>proposing that all options for UK participation in military operations (including smaller </p>
<p>and more specialised options) should be costed.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> This would enable the Government </p>
<p>to assess how much it wished to devote to securing a degree of influence over US policy </p>
<p>and operations, in terms of risk to UK troops, the opportunity cost of withdrawing from </p>
<p>other operations, and the financial cost. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Treasury officials estimated the total military costs of the operation as US$70bn; </p>
<p>and that UK participation on a large scale could cost £2bn or more in the financial year </p>

<p>“We are all agreed that we must act to remove the threat posed by Iraqi WMD. </p>
<p>If the US decide that to do so requires military action then the UK will want to support </p>

<p>of the lacunae in their plan, notably:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… no strategic concept for the military plan and, in particular, no thought </p>
<p>apparently given to ‘day after’ scenarios … US military planning so far has </p>
<p>taken place in a vacuum;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>weak intelligence analysis and a quite unrealistic assumption that Iraqi WMD </p>
<p>would be easy to identify and destroy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an assumption that Kuwait would host a large scale US military effort for </p>
<p>the 1-2 years probably necessary, that other Gulf states would provide </p>
<p>necessary support, and that Syria and Iran would sit quietly on the sidelines;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>no mention of your three conditions for UK involvement, nor of the </p>

<p><b>179. </b> Mr Straw commented:</p>
<p>“Much of what is required is covered by your three conditions for UK involvement </p>
<p>(preparation of public opinion, UN route exhausted, and some MEPP improvement). </p>
<p>Regional states in particular will want assurance that the US has thought through the </p>
<p>‘day after’ questions before giving even tacit support. The support even of key allies </p>

<p>“The fact that the US plan apparently ignores these conditions causes me particular </p>
<p>concern. Are they determined to go ahead regardless? Does the omission signal a </p>
<p>weakening of US commitment to work for progress in these areas before deciding </p>
<p>to launch military action? None of them is getting any easier: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in the Middle East (and elsewhere) public opinion remains deeply hostile </p>
<p>to military action. An aggressive public opinion campaign, demonstrating – </p>
<p>truthfully – that we had exhausted all other options and making the most of </p>
<p>what limited new WMD evidence we have would be needed to reduce this.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>on the UN route, the UN Secretary-General’s dialogue with Iraq has so far </p>
<p>made no concrete progress …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush’s speech has not improved the prospects of moving the </p>
<p>Israel/Palestinian conflict into calmer waters.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the prospects for constructing a legal basis for military action are uncertain </p>
<p>at best.” </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“The key point is how to get through to the Americans that the success of any </p>
<p>military operation against Iraq – and protection of our fundamental interests in the </p>
<p>region – depends on devising in advance a coherent strategy which assesses the </p>
<p>political and economic as well as military implications. They must also understand </p>
<p>that we are serious about our conditions for UK involvement.” </p>

<p><b>Sir Christopher Meyer’s advice, 9 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>182. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer reported speculation in the US media and a number of </p>
<p>recent discussions in Washington on 9 July.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>183. </b> In a press conference on 8 July, President Bush had not attempted to challenge </p>
<p>the veracity of a story about leaked military plans. Sir Christopher’s contacts suggested </p>
<p>that the aim was to have a reworked military plan on President Bush’s desk before he </p>
<p>went on holiday in August. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> Sir Christopher reported that, following a meeting between the UN and Iraq </p>
<p>the previous week, Mr Annan was perceived to have little interest in further meetings. </p>
<p>The US view was that there was little point in further “technical contacts” although </p>
<p>they would wait to see what was proposed at the next meeting of the Security Council. </p>
<p>Iraq “hoped to pin the blame for the failure of the process on the US, UK and UN by </p>
<p>co-operating on the marginal issues but doing little on the core questions”. There was </p>
<p>concern about the lack of knowledge about Iraq amongst the non-P5 members of the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s request for information</b></p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr David Brummell, the Legal Secretary to the Law Officers, wrote to the FCO and </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office on 11 July seeking clarification of the precise position regarding plans </p>
<p>for any future action by the US or the UK in relation to Iraq.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>186. </b> Mr McKane replied on 12 July that there were no plans for military action by </p>
<p>the UK. As for the US, he understood that “military contingency planning” was under </p>
<p>way, but that “no decisions have yet been taken on whether to embark on a military </p>
<p>operation”. He repeated that, as had been agreed in earlier exchanges, it would be </p>
<p>important to ensure that Lord Goldsmith was engaged as the Government’s thinking </p>
<p>developed on the subject.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Brummell replied that Lord Goldsmith had “noted the contents” of Mr McKane’s </p>
<p>letter and was “grateful” for his confirmation of the position.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Lord Goldsmith was invited to the meeting held by Mr Blair on 23 July.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Asked about his awareness of discussions about the use of force against Iraq in </p>
<p>the first half of 2002, Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he was not really aware beyond </p>
<p>what he had read in the press about what was being said by President Bush:</p>
<p>“I’m not aware of the detail of discussions. I would presume there were discussions </p>
<p>taking place. I wasn’t a part of them. I didn’t attend Cabinet. This was a practice </p>
<p>which had grown up over quite a long period of time that the Attorney General didn’t </p>
<p>attend Cabinet unless apparently legal advice was called for.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>190. </b> As early as March 2002, Lord Goldsmith had “wanted to be in a position to engage </p>
<p>constructively” so that his “advice could be factored into the development of different </p>
<p>options” in relation to the use of force in Iraq.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> His Office had explicitly told the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office that “It would not be helpful” if Lord Goldsmith was “presented at the last moment </p>
<p>with a request for a ‘yes or no’ answer”. Lord Goldsmith was “always available to discuss </p>
<p>these matters with Ministerial colleagues”.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Lord Goldsmith had warned Mr Straw and Mr Hoon on 28 March that he had not </p>
<p>been asked for an opinion on the legality of possible military action, but that he would </p>
<p>be “happy to discuss the matter” with them “at any time”.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>192. </b> Asked why Lord Goldsmith was not involved until later, Mr McKane told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that he could not recall why Lord Goldsmith was not brought into discussions after the </p>

<p>Officers over the following months.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that the main consideration in deciding when to engage </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith was the difficulty in seeking formal advice when there wasn’t a specific </p>
<p>proposition to put before him.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Asked about Lord Goldsmith’s request to be involved in Ministerial thinking about </p>
<p>Iraq policy as it developed rather than at the last minute, Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>there had been no need to involve the Attorney General as no decisions needed to be </p>
<p>taken. He offered the view that Lord Goldsmith might have written to the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>because previous incidents had taught him the importance and difficulty of the issues </p>
<p>involved in military action, and the importance of being involved early.</p>

<p><b>Liaison Committee, 16 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>195.  Mr Blair told the Liaison Committee on 16 July that he believed weapons </b></p>
<p><b>of mass destruction posed an enormous threat to the world. </b></p>
<p><b>196.  There was no doubt that Iraq posed a threat in respect of weapons of </b></p>

<p><b>197.  Mr Blair was not seeking to influence the US but to work in partnership.</b></p>
<p><b>198. </b> The question of military action in Iraq was raised during Oral Questions to the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary on 15 July. Mr Hoon assured Mrs Alice Mahon (Labour) that: </p>
<p>“Absolutely no decisions have been taken by the British Government in relation to </p>
<p>operations in Iraq or anywhere near Iraq … I can assure the House that any such </p>
<p>decision would be properly reported to the House.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>199. </b> In response to a subsequent question from Mr Bernard Jenkin (Conservative) </p>
<p>about links between Al Qaida and the Iraqi regime, Mr Hoon replied that there was no </p>
<p>evidence of any direct links and any new information would be investigated.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> He added: </p>
<p>“Let us not be in any doubt about Iraq. We cannot ignore the threat it poses to the </p>
<p>international community. We have always made it clear that the world would be </p>
<p>a much better and safer place without Saddam Hussein.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>200. </b> President Bush telephoned Mr Blair on 15 July.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> In relation to issues like Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Blair told President Bush that it was “absolutely right that the US and UK should </p>
<p>stand together”.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Campbell recorded that President Bush had telephoned to say that he </p>
<p>understood Mr Blair “was taking a fair bit of stick for being supportive, and he was </p>
<p>grateful”.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> That is confirmed by the record of the telephone call.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> At the hearing of the Liaison Committee on 16 July, Mr Blair was questioned about </p>
<p>Iraq by Mr Donald Anderson, Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC).</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>203. </b> Asked if the UK’s policy on Iraq had evolved in the same way as the “sea change” </p>
<p>in US policy under President Bush, Mr Blair observed that President Clinton “had also </p>
<p>had a policy of regime change but how you pursue the policy is another matter”. It was </p>
<p>“true … that the issue of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction is on the agenda in a </p>
<p>different way”. </p>
<p><b>204. </b> Referring to his statement to Parliament on 14 September 2001 (see Section 3.1), </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that he believed weapons of mass destruction:</p>
<p>“… posed an enormous threat to the world. How we deal with that however, is an </p>
<p>open question. That is why I say constantly … there are no decisions which have </p>
<p>been made in relation to Iraq at all, but there is no doubt that Iraq poses a threat in </p>
<p>respect of weapons of mass destruction and there is no doubt that this is an issue </p>
<p>which should be dealt with. The one thing we have learnt post-11 September is that </p>
<p>to take action in respect of a threat that is coming may be more sensible than to wait </p>
<p>for the threat to materialise and then take action.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Asked if the UK was “preparing for possible military action against Iraq”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied: </p>
<p>“No, there are no decisions which have been taken about military action.”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Asked if the recent “deployment” of troops from Kosovo and Afghanistan should </p>
<p>be interpreted as preparation, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“No … That is not to say it is not important that we look at all the various options that </p>
<p>we may have … and if the situation changes in any serious or dramatic way we will </p>
<p>tell them.”</p>

<p>3.3  |  Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>207. </b> Asked whether the UK should only take action in accordance with international law, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, certainly I agree we should act, as I hope this country always does, in </p>
<p>accordance with international law.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>208. </b> Asked whether there was any evidence linking Saddam Hussein with Al Qaida, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied that “as far as he was aware there was no evidence linking Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein to the actual attack on 11 September”; there were “various rough linkages” </p>
<p>to Al Qaida. The issue (on Iraq) was “weapons of mass destruction. It is not what </p>
<p>happened on 11 September or the Al Qaida terrorist network.”</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>209. </b> Asked what had changed since President Bush took office, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… First … it is clear that Saddam Hussein is still trying to develop weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction. Secondly … weapons inspectors where he is still refusing to </p>
<p>abide by the UN resolutions … as more negotiations go on and he fails to comply </p>
<p>and you know that he is developing these weapons of mass destruction, then over </p>
<p>a period of time you are entitled to draw the conclusion that this threat is growing </p>
<p>not diminishing. In addition … our pilots are in action virtually every day over Iraq … </p>
<p>fourth on 11 September you can say either ‘this is a one off event …’ or you can say, </p>
<p>as I would, ‘there are lessons which should be learned from it’ … What we should </p>
<p>learn … is that if there is a gathering threat or danger let us deal with it before it </p>
<p>materialises rather than afterwards … people can get the idea that all the decisions </p>
<p>have been taken … They have not been but there is a threat … The options are </p>
<p>open but we do have to deal with it …”</p>
<p>99</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Blair also told Mr Anderson that there would be documentation setting out the </p>
<p>nature of the WMD threat and that: </p>
<p>“The only reason we have not published some of this documentation before is that </p>
<p>you have got to choose your time … otherwise you send something rocketing up the </p>
<p>agenda when it is not necessarily there. Certainly if we do move into a new phase, </p>
<p>yes, of course, we will publish.”</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>211. </b> Asked whether Parliament would be consulted before British troops were deployed, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied: “… we will keep up detailed consultations with Parliament … We will </p>
<p>keep the House very, very closely involved indeed.” </p>
<p><b>212. </b> Mr Anderson stated that “the special relationship with the US is clearly the key part </p>
<p>of our security policy and the closeness, the unwillingness to criticise is justified by the </p>

<p>fact that we have special influence on the US Administration”. Asked if he could give </p>
<p>examples of where that influence had changed or modified US policy, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“I never like to approach it that way because it suggests almost as if you go along </p>
<p>as a supplicant … you make a case and if you are lucky you win a verdict on </p>
<p>points. It is just not like that. The truth is that we are very interlocked in our strategic </p>
<p>relationship and we discuss and deal with issues the whole time together … I do </p>
<p>not put it like ‘an influence on them’ … post-11 September … the strategic details of </p>
<p>the Afghan campaign … the new NATO-Russia relationship … we worked terribly </p>
<p>closely with the United States … I prefer to look at it as a partnership.”</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>213. </b> Commenting on the impact of Mr Blair’s evidence, Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“… got back for a meeting with Tom McKane, David Manning and Jonathan re Iraq </p>
<p>and when to do the documents. TB had raised the temperature another gear by </p>
<p>making clear publicly we intended to do something and also saying that Saddam </p>
<p>had to be dealt with. We agreed not to go for it yet, because it would look like we </p>
<p>were going to go to war if we did, TB having made it clear that it would be the start </p>
<p>of another phase.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>214. </b> Asked whether it would have been reasonable or expedient to have explained </p>
<p>publicly much earlier that, while the UK hoped for a peaceful outcome, it was also </p>
<p>preparing for all eventualities including military action, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We had not decided we would take military action at that point. On the other hand </p>
<p>you couldn’t say it wasn’t a possibility … I chose the words quite carefully … the </p>
<p>trouble was people kept writing, ‘They have decided. They are off on a military </p>
<p>campaign and nothing is going to stop them.’</p>
<p>“… had I said – and maybe, in retrospect, it is better just to say it … ‘Yes, we are </p>
<p>doing military planning, our fear was people would push you into a position where </p>
<p>you appeared to be on a kind of irreversible path to military action, and this wasn’t </p>
<p>our position …”</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>Cabinet Office paper, 19 July 2002: ‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’</b></p>
<p><b>215. </b> From October 2001 onwards, Mr Blair and others had made statements on </p>
<p>several occasions about issues that would need to be addressed before the UK and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The need for a public information campaign explaining the nature of Saddam </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Any military action would need to be within the framework of international law.</p>

<p>Success in Afghanistan would reinforce the benefits of regime change. </p>
<p><b>216. </b> In his discussions with President Bush at Crawford in April 2002, Mr Blair set out </p>
<p>a number of key elements for a successful strategy towards Iraq which would secure </p>
<p>international support for any military action.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> In numerous references in documents written between April and July 2002 to </p>
<p>“conditions”, these were described in different ways by different people at different times.</p>
<p><b>218. </b> As is clear from his response to Mr Hoon’s minute of 31 May, Mr Blair considered </p>
<p>that he was seeking to influence US policy by describing key elements for a successful </p>
<p>strategy to secure international support for any military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>219.  FCO officials identified high risks which might arise from military action and </b></p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr Chaplin wrote that, as Mr Straw’s minute to Mr Blair of 8 July had noted, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>223. </b> The key risks identified by Mr Chaplin were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“immediate risks of retaliation against UK interests (ranging from political and </p>
<p>economic retaliation against UK interests to … terrorist attack)”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“chronic instability in Iraq” in the medium term;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a repeat of the Suez debacle” in the longer term, “which apart from its short-</p>
<p>term effects (eg sweeping away the Hashemite regime in Iraq) changed Arab </p>
<p>popular opinion towards Britain for a generation”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“serious implications for the success of the global counter-terrorism campaign”.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Chaplin advised:</p>
<p>“These risks can be reduced significantly by careful preparation. The three </p>
<p>conditions spelled out to the Americans by the Prime Minister are interrelated. </p>
<p>To build a coalition for military action and get domestic and international opinion </p>
<p>on side we need:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clear and publicly usable evidence that the Iraq WMD threat is real …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear effort to exhaust all other avenues, principally the UN route. This is </p>
<p>likely to be necessary for us to establish a legal base for military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>visible improvement in the Israel/Palestine situation to give us some </p>
<p>protection against the arguments of double standards.</p>
<p>“These … will … increase the chances of Saddam Hussein finally backing down on </p>
<p>inspections, which I believe is possible once he sees no alternative.”</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Chaplin concluded:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister has promised President Bush UK support for military action if </p>
<p>these conditions are met. There is no commitment yet to UK participation in military </p>
<p>action, nor any collective Ministerial discussion of this yet. As well as urging the US </p>
<p>to do their political homework … we need to re-emphasise at the highest levels that </p>

<p><b>about creating those conditions.</b></p>

<p>19 July to those who would attend the meeting chaired by Mr Blair on 23 July.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Ministers were invited to note the latest position on US military planning, the </p>
<p>timescales for possible action, and to agree:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The objective for any military action should be, as set out in Mr Hoon’s minute </p>
<p>to Mr Blair of 31 May, “a stable and law-abiding Iraq within the present borders, </p>
<p>co-operating with the international community, no longer posing a threat to </p>
<p>its neighbours or to international security, and abiding by its international </p>
<p>obligations on WMD”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To “engage the US on the need to set military plans within a realistic political </p>
<p>strategy”, which included “identifying the succession to Saddam Hussein and </p>
<p>creating the conditions necessary to justify government military action, which </p>
<p>might include an ultimatum for the return of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq. </p>
<p>This should include a call from the Prime Minister to President Bush ahead </p>
<p>of the briefing of US military plans to the President on 4 August.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The establishment of a Cabinet Office-led ad hoc group of officials to consider </p>
<p>the development of an information campaign to be agreed with the US.</p>
<p><b>232. </b> The paper stated that US military planning for action against Iraq was “proceeding </p>
<p>apace” but it lacked a political framework: “In particular, little thought has been given to </p>
<p>creating the political conditions for military action, or the aftermath and how to shape it.” </p>
<p><b>233. </b> It seemed “unlikely” that the UK’s objective could be achieved while Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime remained in power. The US objective was “unambiguously” the </p>
<p>“removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime, followed by elimination of Iraqi WMD”. The view </p>
<p>of UK officials was that it was by “no means certain” that one would follow from the </p>
<p>other: even if regime change was “a necessary condition for controlling Iraq’s WMD”, </p>
<p>it was “certainly not a sufficient one”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>234. </b> The Cabinet Office stated that Mr Blair had discussed Iraq with President Bush at </p>
<p>Crawford in April, and Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… said that the UK would support military action to bring about regime change, </p>
<p>provided that certain conditions were met: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>efforts had been made to construct a coalition/shape public opinion,</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Israel-Palestine Crisis was quiescent, and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the options for action to eliminate Iraq’s WMD through the UN weapons </p>
<p>inspectors had been exhausted.” </p>
<p><b>235. </b> The UK now needed to reinforce Mr Blair’s message and encourage the US to </p>
<p>put its planning into a political framework. This was “particularly important for the UK” </p>
<p>because of the need “to create the conditions” in which it could: “legally support military </p>
<p>action”. Otherwise, there was the “real danger” that the US would commit themselves </p>
<p>to a course of action which the UK “would find very difficult to support”. </p>
<p><b>236. </b> The paper also stated that “certain preparations would need to be made, and other </p>
<p>considerations taken into account” to “fulfil the conditions” set out by Mr Blair “for UK </p>
<p>support for military action”. The paper set them out in a form which could be adapted </p>
<p>for use with the US Government. </p>
<p><b>237. </b> The paper contained a series of sections addressing the conditions which would </p>
<p>be “necessary for military action and UK participation”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a viable military plan”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“justification/legal base”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“an international coalition”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a quiescent Israel/Palestine”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a positive risk/benefit assessment”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the preparation of domestic opinion”.</p>
<p><b>238.  The Chiefs of Staff were not yet able to assess whether the military plans </b></p>
<p><b>were “sound”; although a “decision in principle” might be needed “soon”. </b></p>
<p><b>239.  Ministers were invited to “note” the potentially long lead times for equipping </b></p>
<p><b>UK forces to undertake operations in Iraq, and asked to agree that the MOD could </b></p>
<p><b>bring forward proposals for procurement of equipment.</b></p>
<p><b>240. </b> The Chiefs of Staff advised that there were a number of questions which </p>
<p>would need to be answered before US military plans could be assessed as “sound”. </p>
<p>Those included the realism of a “Running Start”; the willingness of Iraqi forces to fight; </p>
<p>and the potential impact of Iraqi attacks using chemical or biological weapons.</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Without an overt military build-up, a “Running Start” military action could begin as </p>
<p>early as November, with air strikes and support for opposition groups and small scale </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.3  |  Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>land operations while further ground forces built up to overwhelm Iraqi forces; “leading </p>
<p>to the collapse of the Iraqi regime”. A “Generated Start” following a military build-up </p>
<p>could begin as early as January 2003. This was also judged to be the latest date for the </p>
<p>start of military operations unless action was “deferred until the following autumn”. </p>
<p><b>242. </b> The “UK’s ability to contribute forces depended on the details of US military </p>
<p>planning and the time available to prepare and deploy them”. The MOD was “examining </p>
<p>how the UK might contribute to US-led action”. Options ranging from deployment of a </p>
<p>division to making bases available had been identified. US plans assumed the use of </p>
<p>British bases in Cyprus and Diego Garcia. Unless “publicly visible” decisions were taken </p>
<p>“very soon” the UK would not be able to send a division in time for an operation in Iraq </p>
<p>in January 2003. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> A “decision in principle” might be “needed soon on whether and in what form the </p>
<p>UK takes part in military action”.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Ministers were invited to “note the potentially long lead times involved in equipping </p>
<p>UK Armed Forces to undertake operations in the Iraqi theatre”; and to “agree that MOD </p>
<p>should bring forward proposals for the procurement of Urgent Operational Requirements </p>
<p>[UORs] under cover of the lessons learned from Afghanistan” and the “outcome” of the </p>
<p>2002 Spending Review. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> The planning and preparations for equipping UK forces are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 6.3.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr McKane advised Sir David Manning separately that the Cabinet Office paper </p>
<p>covered US military plans “only in headline form” on the grounds that Mr Blair would </p>
<p>“wish to receive a short oral brief from CDS”.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>247.  Regime change was “not a proper basis for international action” but it could </b></p>
<p><b>“result from action which is otherwise lawful”. </b></p>
<p><b>248.  The UN and the international community needed to be persuaded to “set a </b></p>
<p><b>deadline, leading to an ultimatum”. </b></p>
<p><b>249.  Reflecting the JIC Assessment of 27 February, the paper stated that Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein was “likely to admit weapons inspectors as a means of forestalling” </b></p>
<p><b>military action.</b></p>
<p><b>250.  It would take “at least six months” after entering Iraq for the inspectors </b></p>
<p><b>to establish a monitoring and verification system. </b></p>
<p><b>251. </b> Addressing the basis on which military action might be justified, the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>paper explained that the US and UK views of international law varied. While “regime </p>

<p>change per se” was “not a proper basis for international action”, it could “result from </p>
<p>action which is otherwise lawful”.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>252. </b> The UK would regard the use of force as lawful if it was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>exercised in the right of individual or collective self-defence; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>carried out to avert an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>authorised by the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> The legal position on the use of force in Iraq would “depend on the precise </p>
<p>circumstances at the time”. A legal base for an invasion of Iraq was “in principle </p>
<p>conceivable” in relation both to self-defence or a humanitarian catastrophe, but it </p>
<p>would be “difficult to establish because of, for example, the tests of immediacy and </p>
<p>proportionality”. Further legal advice would be needed on that point. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> That left “the route under the UNSC resolutions on weapons inspections”. </p>
<p>There had been “no substantive progress” in the three rounds of talks held by the </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General with Iraq to persuade them to admit the inspectors. The Iraqis </p>
<p>were “deliberately obfuscating”. The Cabinet Office paper stated that Mr Annan had </p>
<p>“downgraded the dialogue” but more “pointless talks” were possible. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> The UN and the international community needed to be persuaded that the </p>
<p>situation could not be “allowed to continue ad infinitum”; and “to set a deadline, leading </p>
<p>to an ultimatum”. It would be “preferable” to obtain the “backing” of a Security Council </p>
<p>resolution for the ultimatum. Early work would be necessary to explore the scope for </p>
<p>achieving that. </p>
<p><b>256. </b> The paper stated that “in practice”, Saddam Hussein was “likely to admit weapons </p>
<p>inspectors as a means of forestalling” military action, but “once admitted he would not </p>
<p>allow them to operate freely”. </p>
<p><b>257. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated that, under the provisions of resolution 1284 </p>
<p>(1999) it would take UNMOVIC:</p>
<p>“… at least six months after entering Iraq to establish the monitoring and verification </p>
<p>system … necessary to assess whether Iraq is meeting its obligations. Hence, even </p>
<p>if UN inspectors gained access today, by January 2003 they would at best only just </p>
<p>be completing setting up. It is possible that they will encounter Iraqi obstruction </p>
<p>during this period, but this [is] more likely when they are fully operational.” </p>
<p><b>258. </b> An earlier draft of the paper had been more explicit about the timetable for </p>
<p>inspections set out in resolution 1284 and more cautious about the consequences, </p>

<p>concluding that there would be difficulties in using that route as the means to establish </p>
<p>a legal base for action in spring 2003. It had concluded:</p>
<p>“So either we need to conclude that military action will be deferred until winter </p>
<p>2003/4 or we need to establish a justification/legal base which does not rely on </p>
<p>the return of the weapons inspectors.”</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>259. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated:</p>
<p>“It was just possible that an ultimatum could be cast in terms which Saddam would </p>
<p>reject (because he is unwilling to accept unfettered access) and which would not </p>
<p>be regarded as unreasonable by the international community … failing that (or an </p>
<p>Iraqi attack) we would be most unlikely to achieve a legal base for military action </p>
<p>by January 2003.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>260. </b> The detailed consideration of legal issues prepared by FCO Legal Advisers and </p>
<p>issued with the Cabinet Office paper of 8 March was circulated again as an Annex to </p>
<p>the 19 July paper.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>261.  Mr McKane advised that the legal basis for military action had deliberately </b></p>
<p><b>been left open.</b></p>
<p><b>262. </b> In a separate minute on the same day, Mr McKane advised Sir David Manning:</p>
<p>“The paper is rather thin in its treatment of the legal base. This is because a </p>
<p>fuller treatment would have resulted in options being closed off – in particular the </p>
<p>justification based on self defence – by legal advisers.”</p>
<p>113</p>

<p><b>263.  An international coalition would be necessary to provide a military platform </b></p>
<p><b>and would be desirable for political purposes.</b></p>

<p>necessary to provide a military platform and would be desirable for political purposes.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The “greater the international support, the greater the prospects of success”.</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Military forces would need agreement to use bases in the region. Without UN </p>
<p>authorisation, there would be problems securing the support of NATO and EU partners, </p>
<p>although Australia “would be likely to participate on the same basis as the UK”. France </p>
<p>“might be prepared to take part if she saw military action as inevitable”. Russia and </p>

<p>and the US was likely to “restrain Israel from taking part in military action”. </p>

<p><b>267. </b> Real progress towards a Palestinian state would reduce Arab antipathy to military </p>
<p>action.<b> </b>Both the UK and the US were pursuing some initiatives aimed at progress </p>
<p>towards a viable Palestinian state, but “another upsurge of Palestinian/Israeli violence” </p>
<p>was “highly likely” and Saddam Hussein “would use continuing violence to bolster </p>
<p>popular Arab support for his regime”.</p>
<p><b>268.  There would be a need to address whether the benefits of military action </b></p>
<p><b>would outweigh the risks.</b></p>
<p><b>269. </b> The Cabinet Office paper stated that the UK would need to ensure that the </p>
<p>benefits of military action outweighed the risks. It stated that a “post-war occupation of </p>
<p>Iraq could lead to a protracted and costly nation building exercise” and that US military </p>
<p>plans were “virtually silent” on that point. Washington could look to the UK to “share </p>
<p>a disproportionate share of the burden”. Further work was required on what form of </p>
<p>government might replace Saddam Hussein’s regime and the timescale which would </p>
<p>be required to identify a successor. </p>
<p><b>270. </b> The UK would also need to consider “in greater detail” the impact of military action </p>
<p>on the UK’s other interests in the region. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> The planning and preparation for a post-conflict Iraq are addressed in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>272.  An information campaign would be required to persuade opinion in the UK </b></p>
<p><b>and overseas that it was necessary to take military action. </b></p>
<p><b>273. </b> The Cabinet Office paper identified the need for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>time “to prepare public opinion in the UK that it was necessary to take military </p>
<p>action”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “substantial effort to secure support of Parliament”. </p>
<p><b>274. </b> Closely related domestic and overseas information campaigns would be needed </p>
<p>giving “full coverage to the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, including his WMD and the </p>
<p>legal justification for action”. The overseas information campaign would be “designed to </p>
<p>influence Saddam Hussein, the Islamic World and the wider international community”. </p>
<p><b>275.  The Cabinet Office paper was written in order to support a Ministerial </b></p>
<p><b>discussion about the approach the UK should take to the US on Iraq. It identified </b></p>
<p><b>the issues the UK should be trying to get the US to address before embarking on </b></p>

<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the potential conflict between the timetable for inspections envisaged </b></p>
<p><b>in resolution 1284 and what the UK understood about US thinking on a </b></p>

<p><b>284.  The elements of Mr Powell’s “road map” were similar to the proposals in </b></p>

<p>“I think we need a road map to getting rid of Saddam, drawing parallels as far as </p>
<p>possible with his [President Bush’s] success in Afghanistan, including the following </p>
<p>elements:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>We will be there when the US takes the decision to act, but …</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>We need to set an ultimatum as we did to the Taliban in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>At a certain point we need to make it clear that unless Saddam agrees to </p>
<p>inspectors on our terms – anyone, any time, anywhere – by a certain date </p>
<p>we will act.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>We need to establish a legal basis. More difficult for us than for them. </p>
<p>It needs to be based on WMD rather than terrorism or regime change.</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p>We need at least neutrality in the region before we can act … If we want to </p>
<p>base our troops in the region this will mean a real effort on the MEPP … </p>
<p>e. </p>
<p>We need to make the case. We need a plan and a timetable for releasing </p>
<p>the papers we have prepared on human rights abuses, WMD etc. We need </p>
<p>to have the sort of Rolls Royce information campaign we had at the end of </p>
<p>Afghanistan before we start in Iraq.</p>
<p>f. </p>
<p>We need a convincing military plan. What we know about so far is not </p>
<p>convincing …</p>
<p>g. </p>
<p>And we need a plan for the day after … We need to be working on this </p>
<p>now …</p>
<p>“Lastly, we should not rush this. We must do it right. If we are not ready in January </p>
<p>2003 then we may need to wait for autumn 2003. Of course Saddam may give us </p>
<p>a break before then that we can exploit, but slow deliberate planning like your father </p>

<p><b>288. </b> Mr Blair responded to Mr Powell: “I agree with this entirely”.</p>

<p><b>Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s advice to Mr Straw</b></p>
<p><b>289.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock warned of likely difficulties with the US and others </b></p>
<p><b>in the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>290. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that Mr Ricketts had asked for advice on prospects </p>
<p>for Iraq at the UN, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At what point do you think that the Americans will begin to say publicly that the </p>
<p>effort to get UN inspectors back into Iraq is dead? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Will we/other members of the Council be able to prolong the efforts beyond that </p>
<p>with any credibility?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Are there any prospects for getting the Council to declare some sort of ultimatum </p>
<p>that unless Saddam lets the Inspectors in by X, the Council will conclude Iraq </p>
<p>has no intention of complying with its obligations (or some other formula well </p>
<p>short of an authorisation)?</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>291. </b> In his response of 19 July, Sir Jeremy Greenstock set out the “broad dynamics” </p>
<p>in New York to provide context:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a lack of “vocal support … even on the lighter issues such as </p>
<p>sanctions machinery” for the UK policy of maintaining rigorous sanctions and </p>
<p>the return of weapons inspectors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia and China were opposed to unilateral military action and insisted on the </p>
<p>UN route but questioned the claims about Iraq’s holdings of WMD and pushed </p>
<p>for “more carrots” to be offered to Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been some movement in the French position over the previous year </p>
<p>but it was still some distance from the UK’s.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Non-permanent members of the Security Council would “go along with the </p>
<p>emerging majority”; most favoured continued political dialogue through the UN, </p>
<p>opposed military action, and were sceptical of the UK’s WMD claims.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> Addressing Mr Ricketts’ questions, Sir Jeremy advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US already planned to say that it saw “no value in talks at any level”, and </p>
<p>that scepticism would increasingly become public. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Annan was “likely to conclude” that he “should keep the way open for further </p>
<p>technical contacts” with Iraq, but there “should be no further talks at his level </p>
<p>until Iraq showed some flexibility”. The UK “could not credibly argue for further </p>
<p>political talks ourselves” as that would “pitch us directly against the Americans”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If and when” there was Iraqi movement, which would “presumably only be </p>
<p>under the pressure of US military preparations, the dynamics of the Council </p>
<p>would mean that efforts to restart political talks would quickly resume”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not “clear that the US would allow … an ultimatum to be put forward”. </p>
<p>They had rejected such an approach over Iraq in 1998 and Kosovo in 1999.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia and China would “definitely” reject an ultimatum; they knew “full well that </p>
<p>it could be used to justify military action which they do not support”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy did not “entirely discount bringing the Council round if we played our </p>
<p>cards cleverly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The prospects for getting Russia, China and others on board “would be </p>
<p>dramatically strengthened if we could catch the Iraqis with their pants down in </p>
<p>some dramatic way”. The “main obstacle … might actually be the Americans, </p>
<p>who will not wish to be caught even asking the question”.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that there was “a lot to be said for considering additional UN </p>
<p>routes to put pressure on Iraq”. These could include revisiting the idea of a travel ban for </p>
<p>senior Iraqis or proposing new measures to screen Iraq’s borders. Such proposals were </p>
<p>“likely to fail” but would “help us demonstrate that we have tried to use the UN route. </p>
<p>And in the event that such proposals do succeed, we benefit from increased pressure </p>
<p>on the Iraqi regime. We would also buy time.” </p>
<p><b>294. </b> The UK would also need:</p>
<p>“… to do more to convince Security Council colleagues and others that Saddam </p>
<p>represents a clear and present danger. More WMD briefings at capitals is one way </p>
<p>forward. I know we have been through this countless times, but we never seem to </p>
<p>be able to hit the point of real conviction.”</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Finally, Sir Jeremy emphasised that the legality of military action was “one of the </p>
<p>most difficult questions we are asked”. The UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New </p>
<p>York could “avoid such questions” when military action was “theoretical”:</p>
<p>“But taking military action against Iraq when our claims to legality are rejected by </p>
<p>a large percentage of UN members is going to damage our multilateral image, our </p>
<p>CT [counter terrorism] credentials and our own electability in the UN system quite </p>
<p>severely”.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Sir Jeremy’s letter was intended to inform the discussion on 23 July, and copies </p>
<p>were sent by Mr Ricketts to the Cabinet Office and the MOD. </p>
<p><b>297. </b> The letter was also seen by Lord Goldsmith.</p>

<p>53</p>
<p><b>The mood in Washington</b></p>
<p><b>298.  Following his minute of 3 July and a visit to Washington on 18 and 19 July, </b></p>
<p><b>Sir Kevin Tebbit advised that the US Administration as a whole was increasingly </b></p>
<p><b>united in the view that military action would be taken against Iraq to bring about </b></p>
<p><b>regime change and remove WMD risks.</b></p>
<p><b>299.  Sir Kevin reported that he had been left with an air of unreality given the </b></p>
<p><b>enormity of what was envisaged and the absence of a policy framework and </b></p>
<p><b>detailed planning. </b></p>
<p><b>300.  Sir Kevin also commented that the UK’s conditions were “listened to politely, </b></p>
<p><b>but without enthusiasm or full agreement”. The US preparations for a potential </b></p>
<p><b>invasion did not yet meet the UK’s conditions for success.</b></p>
<p><b>301. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit visited Washington on 18 to 19 July. The telegram from </p>
<p>Washington reporting the visit described:</p>
<p>“A harder-edged, more deliberative US view on regime change – though they </p>
<p>acknowledge the scale of the challenge. They appear intent on building a strategic </p>
<p>rationale for removing Saddam, and show scant interest in pursuing further the </p>
<p>UN [inspections] track. Tebbit explains the need to build a solid case first, to ensure </p>
<p>that the UN route has been exhausted, and to think through the implications for </p>
<p>‘the day after’ …”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>302. </b> No one had disputed the need to make a strong international case first. </p>
<p>Some senior Americans had argued that the case needed to be presented in “strategic </p>
<p>non-Iraq specific terms – the US (and … others) having concluded that the existential </p>
<p>threat of WMD necessitated – and justified – military action to remove it. Once set in </p>
<p>this framework, the need for pre-emptive action against Iraq ought to be understood </p>
<p>and accepted.” </p>
<p><b>303. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit also wrote to Sir David Manning before the Ministerial discussion </p>
<p>on 23 July. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> Sir Kevin reported: “The principal conclusion to be drawn is that the Administration </p>
<p>as a whole is increasingly united in the view that military action will be taken against </p>
<p>Iraq to bring about regime change and remove WMD risks.” That included the State </p>
<p>Department “notwithstanding its views on the difficulties”. The UK’s “points about </p>
<p>shaping public opinion, constructing coalitions, easing the Israel/Palestine crisis and </p>
<p>exhausting the UN inspectorate route were listened to politely, but without enthusiasm </p>
<p>or full agreement”. There was “no clear indication about timing” but one American had </p>
<p>said that the betting was for an operation in early 2003. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Sir Kevin concluded:</p>
<p>“One is still left with an air of unreality, given the enormity of what is envisaged and </p>
<p>the absence of planning detail or policy framework to credibly make it happen. Part </p>
<p>of the difficulty may be in the dysfunctional nature of the Washington bureaucracy </p>
<p>under which nothing is brought together except and until it reaches the ultimate </p>
<p>level (and Rumsfeld otherwise operates autonomously with his Commanders-in-</p>
<p>Chief). But on the basis of the visit we still have a job on our hands to persuade the </p>
<p>Administration to prepare for this in a way which would meet the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>conditions for participation and, indeed for overall success.”</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>306. </b> The letter was sent to Mr Straw’s Private Office and to the Cabinet Office, </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove, and Mr Brummell. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> The letter was seen by Mr Blair</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> and Lord Goldsmith.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that, at that stage, he and “a lot of other officials” </p>
<p>were concerned to ensure that the UK’s conditions “were … seriously being pursued”, </p>
<p>rather than (the UK) simply being invited to participate in detailed military planning albeit </p>
<p>as a contingency.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Sir Kevin stated that the first reason for the visit “was to be absolutely clear </p>
<p>whether they [the US] were determined to proceed on a military track. It was not clear </p>
<p>at that point.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> The second was to understand the thinking of the different groups in </p>
<p>Washington.</p>
<p><b>310.  Sir Richard Dearlove reported that the US had already taken a decision on </b></p>
<p><b>action, the question was how and when; and that he had been told it intended to </b></p>
<p><b>set the threshold on weapons inspections so high Iraq would not be able to hold </b></p>
<p><b>up US policy.</b></p>
<p><b>311. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove discussed policy towards Iraq in a meeting with Dr Rice in </p>
<p>Washington on 19 July.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>312. </b> The report of the discussion stated that the US view was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “growing evidence of the construction of CBW production and links </p>
<p>to terrorists [in Iraq] stoking fears of a repeat 9/11 with WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a strong strategic case for removing Saddam Hussein. Continued </p>
<p>development of WMD was not in doubt.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “casus belli” already existed.</p>

<p><b>313. </b> Sir Richard reported that he was told a US “decision had already been taken – </p>
<p>the question was only how and when”.</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Sir Richard also reported that, in a separate discussion with a senior US official, </p>
<p>he had been told that the US Administration’s intention was to set the threshold on UN </p>
<p>weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be able to hold up US policy.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Sir David Manning drew Mr Blair’s attention to a report of Sir Richard Dearlove’s </p>
<p>meetings in Washington, commenting:</p>
<p>“Not much doubt here that the Administration is bent on action soon, and convincing </p>
<p>itself that it has strong strategic, as well as a historical duty to act.</p>
<p>“Our views on links between Iraq, terrorism and development of WMD are different </p>
<p>from Condi’s: not proven at best … </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“C [Sir Richard Dearlove] will be able to give the full picture tomorrow.”</p>

<p><b>MOD advice to Mr Hoon</b></p>
<p><b>317.  MOD officials privately expressed strong reservations about military action </b></p>
<p><b>to Mr Hoon, stating that there was no objective justification for a pre-emptive </b></p>
<p><b>attack either now or in the immediate future.</b></p>
<p><b>318.  Mr Hoon was advised that the legal framework could constrain the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>ability to support US action. </b></p>
<p><b>319. </b> In preparation for the meeting on 23 July, Mr Desmond Bowen, MOD Director </p>
<p>General Operational Policy, advised Mr Hoon that the meeting would discuss the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office paper of 19 July, and the agenda was expected to cover:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US planning and timescales;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the objectives of any military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the strategic policy framework;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the potential UK contribution; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an information campaign.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr Bowen advised that it was “still too early to be definitive” about whether the US </p>
<p>had a winning military concept; but that it was “likely” that the answer to that question </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>would be “‘yes’ with certain conditions”. The key point for Mr Blair to note was that US </p>
<p>action could take place “very quickly, as early as November”.</p>
<p><b>321. </b> Agreeing the objective for military action would be “useful”, but it begged the </p>
<p>question of the “<i>strategic policy framework</i> in which to take military action in pursuit of </p>
<p>that objective”. “In particular a framework” was “required to set the conditions for military </p>
<p>action including the necessary justification in international law”. That was “important </p>
<p>because it may well constrain our ability to support US action”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>322. </b> Adm Boyce had directed that UK planning should concentrate on two “packages”: </p>
<p>a supporting/enabling package, including basing, maritime and air assets, in which “the </p>
<p>only land contribution would be SF [Special Forces]”; and a discrete land contribution of </p>
<p>a division (minus) for operations in northern Iraq. They had been chosen because they </p>
<p>effectively represented “the maximum practical UK contribution to US-led operations for </p>
<p>either early or later action”. </p>
<p><b>323. </b> Mr Bowen advised that the “indications from the US” were that it did “not expect a </p>
<p>ground force contribution from the UK for operations out of Kuwait”; and that “providing </p>
<p>land forces to integrate with the US main effort in the South” had “been discounted </p>
<p>because of the severe difficulties we would face due to interoperability; deployment time </p>
<p>and geographic constraints affecting logistics in particular”. </p>
<p><b>324. </b> The “Line to Take” offered to Mr Hoon included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “too early to judge” if the US military plan was a winning concept and the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff were “not yet convinced”. The question of whether the US had </p>
<p>a winning concept could be answered as planning developed. The UK view was </p>
<p>that pressure should be “applied from south, west and north”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US would like to establish the scale of UK involvement. Subject to the legal </p>
<p>framework, the US expected Diego Garcia, Cyprus, air enablers, maritime force </p>
<p>and Special Forces as a minimum. There was a “Developing expectation” of a </p>
<p>“division size force in the North with Turkey and other allies”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Decisions were “needed urgently” if UK forces were to be involved “this winter”. </p>
<p>A large land force contribution needed “preparatory action immediately” and </p>
<p>would not be complete until “March/April”. </p>
<p><b>325. </b> A small number of additional details from this advice are set out in Section 6.1. </p>
<p><b>326. </b> Mr Watkins also offered Mr Hoon a “Private Office distillation of where we think </p>
<p>most of your key advisers – Chiefs, PUS etc (with possible exception of Simon Webb) – </p>
<p>are coming from”.</p>

<p>3.3  |  Development of UK strategy and options, April to July 2002</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>327. </b> In relation to the “<b>threat</b>” posed by Iraq, Mr Hoon was advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam has previously attacked his neighbours; he is developing weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction (WMD).”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But he is not currently threatening his neighbours and his WMD programme </p>
<p>is less advanced than, say, Iran’s or Libya’s. There is no proven link between </p>
<p>Saddam and AQ [Al Qaida].” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam is being contained. There is no objective justification for a pre-emptive </p>
<p>attack on Iraq now or in the immediate future.”</p>
<p><b>328. </b> In relation to the “<b>geo-political implications</b>” of military action, the points included:</p>
<p>“International community […] poor at handling more than one crisis simultaneously. </p>
<p>Attack on Iraq would provoke an additional crisis – increasing the risk that other </p>
<p>flashpoints … would be allowed to ignite/spin out of control.”</p>
<p><b>329. </b> On US “<b>War Plans</b>” and “<b>UK involvement</b>” the points included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“US plans are bold and imaginative. Superior capabilities should ensure rapid </p>
<p>defeat of Iraqi formations.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But success is not assured … Iraqis could use CBW.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Possibility of significant numbers of casualties” could not be excluded.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Significant UK engagement (ie ground forces) could conceivably allow us to </p>
<p>influence US plans and would earn us huge kudos in Washington with potential </p>
<p>paybacks elsewhere. Refusal to provide any support would … severely damage </p>
<p>relationship.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In practice, US plans are more likely to be driven by internal US factors – </p>
<p>especially if things start to go wrong.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UK’s standing with key Gulf states that are negative … or agnostic … about </p>
<p>the attack would suffer: they will see that there is no longer any discernable </p>
<p>difference between US and UK policy.”</p>
<p><b>330. </b> In relation to “<b>UK opinion</b>”, Mr Hoon was advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There is widespread unease about WMD. UK involvement in a successful </p>
<p>campaign could be immensely popular …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But there is widespread scepticism about the justification for a pre-emptive </p>
<p>attack (Saddam is not seen as posing an imminent threat) and cynicism about </p>
<p>US motives.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Public support … would be lukewarm and brittle.”</p>
<p><b>331. </b> The advice concluded: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The case for attacking Iraq now or in the immediate future is deeply flawed. </p>
<p>The absence of a legal justification is not in itself a reason for doing nothing. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>But an attack could have unforeseen geo-political reverberations and is not </p>
<p>assured of rapid, complete success. If Saddam forced the US to undertake a </p>
<p>lengthy and destructive ‘siege’ of Baghdad … the chief beneficiaries would be </p>
<p>AQ and other terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We must try to persuade the US that they need to do a lot more work to clear </p>
<p>the way for an attack on Iraq … We might also try to persuade them that other </p>
<p>aspects of the campaign against terrorism/WMD should have higher priority …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If the US persist with planning for an early attack on Iraq, the UK should offer </p>
<p>that level of support which the US might reasonably expect of a good Ally </p>
<p>(i.e. basing in DG [Diego Garcia] and Cyprus; niche capabilities). There is </p>
<p>no objective case for offering more.”</p>

<p>Mr Scarlett to set the scene with a “very brief summary” of the intelligence on the </p>

<p>had returned from Washington “convinced that the Administration have moved </p>
<p>up a gear”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce to describe current US military planning for a campaign against Iraq. </p>
<p><b>335. </b> Sir David suggested that those presentations would “throw up a number of key </p>

<p>“In the light of this discussion, you might call Bush and prepare a note for him before </p>

<p><b>342. </b> Mr Rycroft’s record of the meeting noted that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett summarised the intelligence and latest (4 July) JIC Assessment: </p>
<p>“Saddam’s regime was tough and based on extreme fear. The only way to </p>
<p>overthrow it was likely to be by massive military action.” Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“worried and expected an attack”, but he was “not convinced” that an attack </p>
<p>would be “immediate or overwhelming”. Real support for Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was “probably narrowly based”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove reported that there was “a perceptible shift in attitude” </p>
<p>in Washington: “Military action was now seen as inevitable.” President Bush </p>
<p>“wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction </p>

<p>of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around </p>
<p>the policy. The NSC had no patience with the UN route and no enthusiasm for </p>
<p>publishing material on the Iraqi regime’s record.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce reported that Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush would be </p>
<p>briefed by CENTCOM planners in early August. The US was examining two </p>
<p>military options, and saw the “UK (and Kuwait) as essential”. The three main </p>
<p>options for UK involvement were:</p>
<p>“(i) </p>
<p>Basing in Diego Garcia and Cyprus plus […] SF squadrons.</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>As above, with maritime and air assets in addition.</p>
<p>(iii)  As above, plus a land contribution of up to 40,000 perhaps with a discrete </p>
<p>role in northern Iraq entering from Turkey, tying down two Iraqi divisions.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon said that the US had already begun “spikes of activity” to put pressure </p>
<p>on the regime. In his view, January was the most likely timing for military action. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated that it “seemed clear” that President Bush had “made up his </p>
<p>mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case </p>
<p>was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability </p>
<p>was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran.” The UK “should work up a plan </p>
<p>for an ultimatum to Saddam” to allow the UN weapons inspectors back in to Iraq. </p>
<p>That would “help with the legal justification for the use of force”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith warned that the desire for regime change was not a legal basis </p>
<p>for military action. Self-defence and humanitarian intervention could not be the </p>
<p>basis for military action in this case. Relying on resolution 1205 (1998) for UN </p>
<p>authorisation “would be difficult”. The situation “might of course change”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated: “it would make a big difference politically and legally if Saddam </p>
<p>refused to allow in the UN inspectors. Regime change and WMD were linked </p>
<p>in the sense that it was the regime that was producing the WMD. There were </p>
<p>different strategies for dealing with Libya and Iran. If the political context were </p>
<p>right, people would support regime change.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair added: “The two key issues were whether the military plan worked and </p>
<p>whether we had the political strategy to give the military plan the space to work.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce did not yet know if the US battleplan was “workable”. There were </p>
<p>“lots of questions”, for example “the consequences if Saddam Hussein used </p>
<p>WMD on day one, or if Baghdad did not collapse and urban warfighting began”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw “thought the US would not go ahead with a military plan unless </p>
<p>convinced it was the winning strategy”, but there “could be US/UK differences” </p>
<p>on the political strategy. The ultimatum should be “discreetly” explored, despite </p>
<p>US resistance. Saddam Hussein would “continue to play hard-ball with the UN”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett assessed that “Saddam would allow the inspectors back in only </p>
<p>when he thought the threat of military action was real”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon stated that, if Mr Blair wanted UK military involvement, an early </p>
<p>decision would be required. Mr Hoon cautioned that “many in the US did not </p>

<p>think it was worth going down the ultimatum route”. It would be important for </p>
<p>Mr Blair “to set out the political context” to President Bush. </p>
<p><b>343. </b> Mr Rycroft wrote that the meeting concluded:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military </p>
<p>action. But we needed a fuller picture of US planning before we could take </p>
<p>any firm decisions. CDS [Adm Boyce] should tell the US military that we were </p>
<p>considering a range of options.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Prime Minister would revert on the question of whether funds could be spent </p>
<p>in preparation for this operation.</p>

<p>campaign and possible UK contributions by the end of the week.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>UN inspections and discreetly work up the ultimatum to Saddam …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>John Scarlett would send the Prime Minister a full intelligence update.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We must not ignore the legal issues: the Attorney General would consider legal </p>
<p>advice with FCO/MOD legal advisers.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Mr Rycroft’s detailed record of the meeting was sent to the participants only.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Rycroft sent a separate letter to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary on 23 July, which </p>
<p>very briefly summarised the action points for the FCO, MOD and Cabinet Office.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>They were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw to provide advice on the positions of countries in the region, the </p>

<p>Saddam Hussein. These were requested by 30 July.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce to tell the US military that the UK was considering a range of options </p>
<p>for any UK involvement in any military operation. He was also to send Mr Blair </p>
<p>full details of the proposed military campaign, and options for a UK contribution, </p>
<p>by 30 July or earlier if they were available. </p>

<p>“Jack set out the political difficulties. He said it was all being driven by DOD and the </p>
<p>NSC, and [Secretary] Powell and the State Department was not fully involved …</p>
<p>“TB said he did not want any discussions with any other departments at this stage </p>
<p>and did not want any of this ‘swimming round the system’. He meant the Treasury …</p>
<p>“Jack said of the four powers posing a potential threat with WMD … Iraq would be </p>
<p>fourth. He does not have nukes, he has some offensive WMD capability. The tough </p>
<p>question is whether this is just regime change or is the issue WMD. </p>
<p>“TB was pretty clear that we had to be with the Americans. He said at one point, </p>
<p>‘It’s worse than you think, I actually believe in doing this.’ He was acutely conscious </p>
<p>how difficult it would be both with the PLP and the public, but when Jack raised </p>
<p>the prospect of not going in with the US, TB said that would be the biggest shift </p>
<p>in foreign policy for fifty years and I’m not sure it’s very wise. </p>
<p>“On the tactical level, he felt maximum closeness publicly was the way to maximise </p>
<p>influence privately …</p>
<p>“TB said he needed to be convinced first of the workability of the military plan, and </p>
<p>second of an equally workable political strategy. Jack said we could probably get the </p>
<p>votes for a UN ultimatum, but the Americans may not want to go down that route. </p>
<p>TB saw regime change as the route to dealing with WMD.”</p>

<p><b>347. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair recorded that Adm Boyce had made it pretty clear at the </p>
<p>meeting that “he thought the US had decided on it [military action], bar a real change </p>

<p>there was a relationship between Iraq and al-Qa’ida. Dearlove’s strongly held view </p>
<p>based on his own Service’s reporting, which had been shared with the CIA, was </p>
<p>that any contacts that had taken place had come to nothing and that there was no </p>
<p>formal relationship … He believed that the crowd around the Vice President was </p>
<p>playing fast and loose with the evidence. In his view, it was never about ‘fixing’ the </p>
<p>intelligence itself but rather about the undisciplined manner in which the intelligence </p>
<p>was being used.”</p>
<p><b>350. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry that, during his visit to Washington in July </p>
<p>2002, he had had “quite contentious and difficult conversations” with Mr Libby as well </p>
<p>as discussions with Mr Tenet, Dr Rice and Mr Stephen Hadley, US Deputy National </p>
<p>Security Advisor.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> He had returned from Washington “deeply concerned that there </p>
<p>was momentum in parts of the [US] Administration”, and he had warned Mr Blair about </p>
<p>that momentum.</p>
<p><b>351. </b> In relation to his “alleged comment” about the intelligence being fixed around the </p>
<p>policy, Sir Richard told the Inquiry that this was really a reference to the attempts “to join </p>
<p>up terrorism and Iraq” with which he “radically disagreed”.</p>
<p><b>352. </b> Asked if Mr Blair had taken the conjunction between terrorism and WMD seriously, </p>
<p>Sir Richard replied:</p>
<p>“… I don’t think the Prime Minister ever accepted the link between Iraq and </p>
<p>terrorism. I think it would be fair to say that the Prime Minister was very worried </p>
<p>about the possible conjunction of terrorism and WMD, but not specifically in relation </p>
<p>to Iraq … [I] think, one could say this is one of his primary national security concerns </p>
<p>given the nature of Al Qaida.”</p>

<p><b>353. </b> Sir Richard added that he sought an amendment to Mr Rycroft’s record of the </p>

<p><b>354. </b> The Inquiry has seen that document. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> In response to subsequent questioning, referring to a manuscript note made by </p>

<p>but he did not recall it as a key meeting, rather it was part of an “iterative process”.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Hoon subsequently wrote that there was “a very full discussion of the relevant </p>
<p>issues” at the meeting, and that:</p>
<p>“Arguments both for and against UK involvement as well as relevant legal opinions </p>
<p>were set out and recorded in the minutes of the meeting. All of the reservations set </p>
<p>out in the summary prepared by my Private Office were fully debated in the meeting. </p>
<p>At such a meeting I would not have thought it necessary to repeat arguments </p>
<p>already made by others … unless there was some specific benefit in doing so.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>359. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that he didn’t think the meeting on 23 July had </p>
<p>“decided on much”. It had been a “taking stock” meeting, but what had struck him “was </p>
<p>that some of the language used implied that we were closer to military action than I had </p>
<p>imagined that we were”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>360. </b> Lord Wilson told the Inquiry that two elements of the meeting stood out in his </p>
<p>memory: First, there was “an underlying tension … between the Prime Minister and his </p>
<p>Foreign Secretary”. Mr Straw was “very much in the business of saying: ‘The crucial </p>
<p>thing is to get all this to the United Nations. That’s the way we are going to play it. </p>
<p>We are nowhere near military action at the minute. All the military things the military </p>
<p>are saying need to be seen in the political context.’” Mr Straw had been “pleading quite </p>
<p>strongly for the political nuances”; and that he was “working very hard to keep the </p>
<p>Prime Minister … focused on the United Nations and away from getting too … gung ho </p>
<p>about military action”.</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Second, Lord Wilson remembered “quite vividly” that Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… gave his legal advice … which was you would need the authorisation of a United </p>
<p>Nations Security Council resolution if you were going to specifically undertake </p>
<p>military action and if you didn’t do that, his strong advice was that it was illegal to </p>
<p>take military action. The Prime Minister simply said ‘Well…’ and that’s it. I remember </p>
<p>thinking ‘There is an unresolved issue there’.”</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>362. </b> Lord Wilson, who remained the Cabinet Secretary until the beginning of September </p>
<p>2002, told the Inquiry that he had still been on duty during August 2002 and had taken </p>
<p>papers, but he could recall none on Iraq.</p>

<p><b>363. </b> In response to a specific question about whether, following the meeting on 23 July, </p>
<p>he thought that the Government’s strategy on Iraq had coalesced by the beginning of </p>
<p>September, Lord Wilson replied:</p>
<p>“I thought they were in the thick of it … ‘If you asked whether as a matter of proper </p>
<p>Cabinet government the Cabinet had endorsed a course that was likely to lead to </p>
<p>military action, I would tell you emphatically not’ … If you had said to me ‘Is the </p>
<p>Prime Minister … serious about military action?’ I would have said ‘There is a gleam </p>
<p>in his eye which worries me.’ I think I used that phrase at the time.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Lord Wilson stated: </p>
<p>“I think the Prime Minister was torn over Iraq … Torn between all his instincts which </p>
<p>were to be alongside the Americans, whatever that means, on the one hand and </p>
<p>his knowledge that a lot of people in his Cabinet and in public opinion and people </p>
<p>in Parliament would be unhappy with that. I would guess … that in the summer </p>

<p><b>365. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that he:</p>
<p>“… ran through the four countries that posed a potential threat to world peace </p>

<p>Korea, Iran, Libya, and Iraq. I thought it important to raise the issue as to whether </p>
<p>we should contemplate not joining the US in any American military effort against </p>
<p>Iraq. I was concerned that the case against Iraq (why did it merit the most severe </p>
<p>action? what differentiated it from the other three?) had not at that stage been made: </p>

<p><b>368. </b> Sir David wrote that he had “therefore, asked John Scarlett to review all the </p>
<p>intelligence on Saddam’s military capabilities and intentions, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What military equipment do we think Saddam possesses, and in what state </p>
<p>of effectiveness?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In particular, does he [Saddam] have chemical and biological agents; and if so, </p>
<p>can he weaponise them? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If he can weaponise them, do we believe he can deliver them by missile or </p>
<p>aircraft?” </p>
<p><b>369. </b> Sir David pointed out that Iraq had not used chemical or biological agents during </p>
<p>the 1991 Gulf Conflict, but he was unsure whether that was because Iraq did not have </p>
<p>the capability or for other reasons. He was:</p>
<p>“… anyway left very uneasy by Mike Boyce’s suggestion that the Americans </p>
<p>believe that Saddam would only use CBW as a last resort. If this is the American </p>
<p>assessment, it strikes me as alarmingly complacent. Saddam will know that once </p>
<p>the US launches an attack, the game is up. From his point of view, it will be last </p>
<p>resort time from the moment the first Marines hit the beach. And with all the wisdom </p>
<p>of the armchair strategist, it seems to me that the temptation to let fly at the Kuwait </p>
<p>bottleneck, with everything in his armoury, could be very strong indeed.” </p>
<p><b>370. </b> These questions were addressed in the JIC Assessment of 9 September </p>
<p>(see Section 4.2).</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Mr Scarlett was also asked to “do more work on regime cohesion” in the light of </p>
<p>what Sir David described as “a risk of American wishful thinking”. Sir David commented:</p>
<p>“Perhaps the Saddam tyranny will collapse like a pack of cards as they hope. But we </p>
<p>should not count on it. We need as much intelligence as we can get on the popular </p>
<p>mood, and the attitude of Saddam’s entourage, before making assumptions that </p>
<p>determine military planning.” </p>

<p>the UK would be with them. This would not be easy for the Prime Minister politically.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Sir Christopher had been asked about a speech that Dr Henry Kissinger, the </p>
<p>former US Secretary of State, had made the previous week, emphasising the need </p>
<p>for pre-emption in the post-9/11 world. Dr Kissinger had argued three conditions had </p>
<p>to be met if there were to be military action in Iraq:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… a rapid and successful conclusion – a prolonged war would be very </p>
<p>dangerous …; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the US ‘got the diplomacy right’ …; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the US arrived in Baghdad with a clear plan for who and what should </p>
<p>replace Saddam …”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>378. </b> Sir Christopher had said that those views “were not a million miles” from the UK’s; </p>
<p>and that it was “very important to be able to build a public case for attacking Saddam; </p>
<p>exhausting UN processes on inspections; and unwinding violence between the Israelis </p>
<p>and Palestinians were part of this strategy”. </p>
<p><b>379. </b> Sir Christopher warned again that, as Sir Kevin Tebbit had picked up during </p>
<p>his visit earlier in July 2002, the “buts” in the UK’s “yes, but …” approach had “less </p>
<p>traction in Washington than a couple of months ago”. It seemed a given “across the </p>
<p>[US] Administration that efforts to get UNMOVIC into Iraq have run their course … </p>
<p>and that, with Israel/Palestine, the process … is enough to keep the lid on during an </p>
<p>Iraqi campaign”.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Sir Christopher reported that General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief </p>
<p>CENTCOM, would give President Bush his plans in early August. If the President </p>
<p>was happy, visible preparations would probably begin in the autumn or early winter. </p>
<p>The US expected to secure sufficient co-operation from neighbouring countries for </p>
<p>military action. </p>
<p><b>381. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair that these were: “Further signs that </p>
<p>Bush is impatient to move. Little reassurance on the political context.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>384.  Mr Blair continued to reserve his position about whether a new Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council resolution would be required to authorise military action.</b></p>
<p><b>385. </b> During Prime Minister’s Questions (PMQs) on 24 July, Mr Blair was asked by </p>
<p>Mr Peter Kilfoyle (Labour) whether, in the event of the US commencing military action </p>
<p>during the Recess, Mr Blair would recall Parliament before any British forces were </p>
<p>committed. Mr Blair replied that “we have not yet got to the stage of military action”; </p>
<p>if that stage was reached “at any point”, Parliament would be “properly consulted”.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>386. </b> In his press conference on 25 July, Mr Blair repeated the line that he had taken </p>
<p>at the Liaison Committee on 16 July that Iraq’s position on WMD was an issue.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He emphasised that no decision had been taken about how to deal with it and the need </p>
<p>to avoid “getting ahead of ourselves”. He was not prepared to speculate about an area </p>
<p>of such “tremendous sensitivity”. </p>
<p><b>387. </b> Asked why he had refused to pledge a vote in the House of Commons before any </p>
<p>military activity, Mr Blair said that the House of Commons would be consulted but it was </p>
<p>important to follow the precedents and there was no point in speculating at that point </p>
<p>about the right way to consult the House. He was not going to pin himself down to any </p>
<p>specific form of consultation. </p>
<p><b>388. </b> Asked why the promised dossier laying out the evidence against Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had not appeared, Mr Blair stated that it would be published when he judged it to be the </p>
<p>right moment.</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Asked whether the UK would actively be encouraging the US Administration to </p>
<p>seek a new UN Security Council resolution as a pre-requisite for military action, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“What is important is that whatever action we take, should we take action, it is done </p>
<p>in accordance with international law. I don’t think we can judge the issue of UN </p>
<p>resolutions at this present moment … the most important thing is to go back to … </p>
<p>the UN resolutions that we have … I haven’t fully caught up on the exact state of the </p>
<p>negotiations between the UN Secretary-General and the Iraqis, but the omens don’t </p>
<p>look very good frankly for Iraq.</p>
<p>“… the issue is, is there any point in reviving those negotiations … because it seems </p>
<p>somewhat unlikely that the Iraqis intend to comply.”</p>

<p><b>resolution incorporating an ultimatum without convincing evidence of a greatly </b></p>
<p><b>increased threat from Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>391.  It would not be easy to persuade the US to support an ultimatum given the </b></p>
<p><b>US concerns to avoid a resolution which would constrain its freedom.</b></p>
<p><b>392.  An ultimatum issued by the US/UK might have presentational utility but </b></p>
<p><b>it would have no legal force.</b></p>
<p><b>393. </b> Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, responded to </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft on 26 July with advice on “how to get the Security Council to issue some sort </p>
<p>of ultimatum ahead of any military action”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>394. </b> The letter reflected advice from the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York </p>
<p>and the British Embassy Washington and a list of elements which might be incorporated </p>
<p>in a new resolution was enclosed with the letter. It was envisaged that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s failure to co-operate would be condemned as a “flagrant violation” of </p>
<p>its obligations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ultimatum would take the form of a demand for UNMOVIC and the IAEA to </p>
<p>be allowed “immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the resolution would declare that, if Iraq did not comply, it would be clear that </p>
<p>it had “no intention of complying with its obligations”. </p>
<p><b>395. </b> The letter stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To carry conviction an ultimatum would have to be “couched as a Chapter VII </p>
<p>Security Council resolution” deciding that Iraq is in “flagrant violation of SCR </p>
<p>687 and other relevant resolutions” and calling on Iraq to allow “immediate, </p>
<p>unconditional, and unrestricted access to any and all areas”, as specified in </p>
<p>resolution 1284 (1999), by a given date.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “likely to be formidable obstacles to overcome” to secure a </p>
<p>resolution “unless there was convincing evidence of a greatly increased threat </p>
<p>from the Iraqis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US “vigorously asserted the right of individual Member States to determine </p>
<p>whether Iraq has breached the cease-fire” set out in resolution 687 (1991), </p>
<p>“irrespective of whether the Council” had “made such an assessment”. The </p>
<p>US would “argue against establishing an ultimatum which they would see as </p>
<p>interfering with that right”. The US would “also argue that faced with a credible </p>
<p>ultimatum Iraq would make a show of co-operation to secure a delay, muddy the </p>
<p>waters and split the Council”; and that Iraq would restrict the inspectors’ access </p>
<p>to facilities. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>If the US accepted the idea, Russia and China would reject it: “They would </p>
<p>see it as a precursor to military action. The US might be able to win over the </p>
<p>Russians … The Chinese might then follow.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France would still need “to be brought on board”. It would be “highly suspicious  </p>
<p>if they thought the purpose of an ultimatum was to legitimise military action rather </p>
<p>than get the inspectors in”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the US “refused outright to countenance” a resolution with an ultimatum, or </p>
<p>the US and UK “failed to persuade” other Permanent Members, “there might be </p>
<p>merit … in a bilateral US/UK ultimatum on the model used before the start of </p>
<p>hostilities in Afghanistan”. That “might be a useful manifesto of our aims … with </p>
<p>sceptical governments and public opinion. But it would have no legal force.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were risks. Opponents might table a resolution condemning an ultimatum, </p>
<p>arguing that as the US and UK would not be “<i>claiming</i> to be acting in self-</p>
<p>defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter (as we were in Afghanistan)”, an </p>
<p>ultimatum “would amount to a threat of a use of force, breaching Article 2(4), </p>
<p>which prohibits this”. The UK might find itself “having to veto [such a resolution], </p>
<p>leaving us worse off than if we had not tried this route at all”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An “essential first step would be to sound out the Americans” on which the FCO </p>
<p>was “now putting action in hand”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>396. </b> The letter stated that the FCO was reconsidering additional UN routes to put </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq – travel bans, new measures to screen Iraq’s borders. While such </p>
<p>proposals were “likely to fail”, they would “help us demonstrate that we have tried to </p>
<p>use the UN route … if they succeeded, we would benefit from increased pressure on the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime. We would also buy time.” </p>
<p><b>397. </b> The FCO was “giving further thought to what more we might be able to do to </p>
<p>convince the Security Council, European Union and other governments that Saddam </p>
<p>represents a clear and present danger. The Cabinet Office paper [the draft ‘dossier’ </p>
<p>on Iraq] when the right time comes for its release, will clearly be an important element </p>
<p>of this.” </p>
<p><b>398. </b> A copy of the FCO letter was sent to the Private Offices of Mr Hoon and the </p>

<p><b>402.  Mr Blair recognised the difficulties but commented that it was hard to see </b></p>
<p><b>a way through unless “we just don’t do it”; and he thought it was right to take </b></p>
<p><b>action.</b></p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell on 26 July to seek a one-to one discussion </p>
<p>on Iraq in late August.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>404. </b> Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that meetings in the US “the week after next” </p>
<p>would “become ‘much more serious’ but would not necessarily accelerate the timing </p>
<p>of any action”. </p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Straw stated that Iraq was “an increasingly big issue in the UK”. As well as </p>
<p>planning military action, there was a need “to make the case in public for such action”. </p>
<p>There was also a need for a process, as had happened in relation to Afghanistan, for </p>
<p>“getting as many people on board internationally as possible”. </p>
<p><b>406. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed the papers prepared for publication on </p>
<p>Iraq and whether they set out the case against Iraq in strong enough terms. Secretary </p>
<p>Powell said that Mr Tenet was looking at a paper for possible publication. Mr Straw </p>
<p>“rehearsed the history” of the UK paper (see Section 4.1) and said: “Objectively, the </p>
<p>case against Iraq was third or fourth strongest; Iraq was not in a top priority category </p>
<p>of its own.” </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that serious people were writing to Mr Blair </p>
<p>questioning “how was Iraq different from North Korea Libya or Iran” and “why was action </p>
<p>necessary now”. Sir Michael Quinlan, a former Permanent Under Secretary of the </p>
<p>MOD, had asked what had changed in the last year, and whether there was really any </p>
<p>evidence that Saddam Hussein was about to use WMD. Sir Michael had concluded that </p>
<p>not much had changed. </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he “knew that some issues were difficult </p>
<p>in Washington – weapons inspectors and issuing an ultimatum – but they still had to </p>
<p>be faced”.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Straw’s view was that Saddam Hussein was “evil but not insane”. </p>
<p>Secretary Powell referred to the warning about the use of WMD the US had issued </p>
<p>to Saddam Hussein in 1991.</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell also discussed the consequences of military action; </p>
<p>and that the only way to ensure a strong central government would be for the US and </p>
<p>UK to stay on. That might require “an army of occupation for years to come”. </p>
<p><b>411. </b> As well as the formal record of the discussion, Mr Straw sent Mr Blair a handwritten </p>
<p>letter rehearsing doubts about the strength of the case for military action against Iraq.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Straw wrote that it could be argued that “deterrence and containment had </p>
<p>worked up to now: what was the case that argued they would not work in future?” </p>
<p>He also pointed out that the regional reactions were “All too clear, I fear, unless a </p>
<p>stronger case is better made.” Mr Straw added his own concern about “the survival of </p>
<p>your government” because of unease in both the Cabinet and the PLP; and the desire </p>
<p>for “a case which has yet to be made”. Without that, Mr Straw advised “the most serious </p>
<p>divisions would open up”. </p>
<p><b>413. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that the letter had “set out the hazards ahead if our </p>
<p>handling of Iraq went wrong” and that it had ended: “And you know where some (not so </p>
<p>loyal) are on all this. Licking their lips at the possibility of regime change nearer home.”</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Blair commented to officials in No.10:</p>
<p>“I entirely agree with all this. But it is hard to see the way through, unless we just </p>
<p>don’t do it. But I think it’s right to do it.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush, 28 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush a “Note on Iraq” on 28 July.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>416. </b> The Note began:</p>
<p>“I will be with you, whatever. But this is the moment to assess bluntly the difficulties. </p>
<p>The planning on this and the strategy are the toughest yet. This is not Kosovo. </p>
<p>This is not Afghanistan. It is not even the Gulf War. </p>
<p>“The military part of this is hazardous but I will concentrate mainly on the political </p>
<p>context for success.” </p>
<p><b>417. </b> Mr Blair stated that getting rid of Saddam Hussein was:</p>
<p>“… the right thing to do. He is a potential threat. He could be contained. </p>
<p>But containment … is always risky. His departure would free up the region.  </p>
<p>And his regime is … brutal and inhumane …”</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the first question was whether the US wanted or needed a </p>
<p>coalition. He stated that the US “could do it alone, with UK support”, but drew attention </p>
<p>to the dangers of “unintended consequences”, writing:</p>
<p>“Suppose it got militarily tricky. Suppose Iraq suffered unexpected civilian casualties. </p>
<p>Suppose the Arab street finally erupted eg in […] Suppose Saddam felt sufficiently </p>
<p>politically strong, if militarily weak in conventional terms, to let off WMD. Suppose </p>

<p>real Iraqis … decide to offer resistance. Suppose … that any difficulties, without a </p>
<p>coalition, are magnified and seized on by a hostile international opinion. If we win </p>
<p>quickly, everyone will be our friend. If we don’t … recriminations will start fast.</p>
<p>“None of these things might happen. But they might … And there is one other point. </p>
<p>We will need to commit to Iraq for the long term. Bedding down a new regime will </p>
<p>take time. So, without support, the possibility of unintended consequences will </p>
<p>persist through and beyond the military phase.” </p>
<p><b>419. </b> Mr Blair stated that he was “keen on a coalition, not necessarily military but </p>
<p>politically”. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> Addressing the nature of a coalition, Mr Blair wrote that he was “a little alarmed” </p>
<p>about the reports he had been given of US optimism about support from Arab nations </p>
<p>and Europe. That was not his reading, and: </p>
<p>“The trouble is, everyone says: they will support action, but they add a rider … </p>
<p>[which] is not always sufficiently heard or spoken.” </p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Blair identified three key areas where, in his view, changes would be needed </p>
<p>before there would be support for action on Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Middle East Peace Process would need to be in a different place;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>specific UN authority; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>public opinion in the UK, Europe and the Arab world was “quite simply on </p>
<p>a different planet” from opinion in the US. </p>
<p><b>422. </b> Mr Blair added that “right now”, he “couldn’t be sure of support from Parliament, </p>
<p>Party, public or even some of the Cabinet”; and that, “oddly”, Russia might be their </p>
<p>“best ally”.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Blair set out six elements for “A Strategy for Achieving a Coalition”.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Addressing “<b>The UN</b>”, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“We don’t want to be mucked around by Saddam … and the danger is he drags us </p>
<p>into negotiation. But we need, as with Afghanistan and the ultimatum to the Taliban, </p>
<p>to encapsulate our casus belli in some defining way. This is certainly the simplest. </p>
<p>We could, in October as the build up starts, state that he must let the inspectors </p>
<p>back in unconditionally and do so now, ie set a 7-day deadline. It might be backed by </p>
<p>a UNSCR or not, depending on what support there was (and I am not sure anyone, </p>
<p>at present, would veto it if Russia was on board). There would be no negotiation. </p>
<p>There would be no new talks with Annan. It would be: take it or leave it.”</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Mr Blair added that he knew there would be “reluctance” to that approach:</p>
<p>“But it would neutralise opposition … If he did say yes, we continue the build-up and </p>
<p>we send teams over and the moment he obstructs, we say: he’s back to his games. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>That’s it. In any event, he probably would screw it up and not meet the deadline, </p>
<p>and if he came forward after the deadline, we could just refuse to deal.”</p>
<p><b>426. </b> “<b>The Evidence</b>”: Mr Blair wrote that he had been told that the US thought evidence </p>
<p>was unnecessary but his view was “we still need to make the case”. He suggested:</p>
<p>“If we recapitulate all the WMD evidence; add his attempts to secure nuclear </p>
<p>capability; and, as seems possible, add on the Al Qaida link, it will be hugely </p>
<p>persuasive over here. Plus … the abhorrent nature of the regime. It could be done </p>
<p>simultaneously with the deadline.”</p>
<p><b>427. </b> “<b>MEPP</b>”: Mr Blair wrote that it would be “essential” for Arab support for negotiation </p>
<p>to have started “in earnest”. It was “worth a real effort to get a proper negotiation going”, </p>
<p>and that wouldn’t start unless someone took charge of the detail. </p>
<p><b>428. </b> Addressing Iraq<b> </b>“<b>Post Saddam</b>”, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Suppose we were able to say … Regime change is vital and, in the first instance, it </p>
<p>must be one that protects Iraq’s territorial integrity and provides stability; and hence </p>
<p>might involve another key military figure. But it should lead in time to a democratic </p>
<p>Iraq governed by the people. This would be very powerful. I need advice on whether </p>
<p>it’s feasible. But just swapping one dictator for another seems inconsistent with </p>
<p>our values.” </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Blair suggested that some in the “<b>Arab/Moslem World</b>”<b> </b>would “fall into line”, </p>
<p>but others would not; and Syria and Iran “might be actively hostile or use it as a means </p>
<p>to support terrorism in Israel”. A “dedicated effort” was needed “to woo the Arab world”, </p>
<p>and “to offer hardliners a very hard-headed partnership or put them on the ‘axis of evil’ </p>
<p>list”. </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Blair wrote that “<b>Afghanistan</b>” had to be “going right, not wrong”. It was “our </p>
<p>one act of regime change so far, so it had better be a good advertisement”, and his </p>
<p>“hunch” was that it needed “renewed focus and effort”.</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Blair wrote that both Turkey and the Kurds would “need to be OK”. They might </p>
<p>be the “easiest” [members of a coalition]: “They both want our help badly and will play </p>
<p>ball if offered enough.” </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that he would be “happy to try to pull this [the strategy] </p>
<p>together; ie to dedicate myself to getting all these [six] elements … sorted, including </p>
<p>involving myself in the MEPP”. But it would need “a huge commitment in time and </p>
<p>energy”, and was “only really worth doing if we are all on the same page”.</p>
<p><b>433. </b> In a final section on “<b>The Military Plan</b>”, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Finally, obviously, we must have a workable military plan. I don’t know the details </p>
<p>yet, so this is first blush.</p>

<p>support. The idea would be to catch the regime off balance, strike hard and quickly </p>
<p>and get it to collapse. The obvious danger is [that] it doesn’t collapse. And there is </p>
<p>the risk of CW being used.</p>
<p>“For that reason, a generated start seems better. It could always be translated into </p>
<p>a more immediate option, should Saddam do something stupid. Also, the build-up of </p>
<p>forces in such numbers will be a big signal of serious intent to the region and help to </p>
<p>pull people towards us and demoralise the Iraqis. This option allows us to hammer </p>
<p>his air defences and infrastructure; to invade from the South and take the oilfields; </p>
<p>to secure the North and protect/stabilise the Kurds. Then effectively with huge force </p>
<p>we go on to Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>434. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“We would support in any way we can.</p>
<p>“On timing, we could start building up after the break. A strike date could be Jan/Feb </p>
<p>next year. But the crucial issue is not when, but how.”</p>
<p><b>435.  Mr Powell told the Inquiry that Mr Blair was seeking a partnership with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush and seeking to persuade him to move in a particular direction </b></p>
<p><b>by providing a framework for action. </b></p>
<p><b>436. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that the Note was “a very important one … trying to </p>
<p>make it clear the basis on which we thought it would be sensible to go ahead”, and the </p>
<p>basis on which the US should go to the UN. Mr Blair was “talking about … the danger </p>
<p>of unintended consequences”.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>437. </b> Addressing what was meant by the reference to unintended consequences, </p>
<p>Mr Powell stated that the Iraqis would “feel ambivalent about being invaded. If we </p>
<p>win quickly everyone will be our friend. If we don’t, and they haven’t been bound in </p>
<p>beforehand, the recriminations will start fast.” Mr Blair was “arguing to put this [action </p>
<p>against Iraq] in a political context and to do it in a way that would win support of a wide </p>
<p>coalition as with Afghanistan”. </p>
<p><b>438. </b> Asked if Mr Blair was trying to offer Britain’s support in return for influence over </p>
<p>the means for taking action, Mr Powell replied:</p>
<p>“Obviously, there is a trade-off between convincing someone that you are with them, </p>
<p>that you believe what they are trying to do and you are going to try to help them and </p>

<p>getting some influence. If you just go to someone and say, ‘You’re completely wrong. </p>
<p>Forget it’, the amount of influence you are likely to have … is less.</p>
<p>“So … there is a trade-off between indicating you are with someone and then </p>
<p>persuading them to move down a particular route.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>439. </b> Asked whether the elements that would be essential for success were red lines </p>
<p>for the UK and absolutely essential or whether they were things that would be nice to </p>
<p>have but the UK would go along with the policy whatever happened, Mr Powell said that </p>
<p>Mr Blair was not setting conditions for UK participation in military action:</p>
<p>“The point of these Notes is to try and set out the right way to do it … [T]hinking of </p>
<p>them in terms of conditions is the wrong way to look at it. We weren’t trying to say </p>
<p>‘If you tick off all these boxes, then we will be with you’. We were saying ‘We are with </p>
<p>you in terms of what you are trying to do, but this is the sensible way to do it. We are </p>
<p>offering you a partnership to try to get to a wide coalition’. </p>
<p>“But being with the Americans didn’t necessarily mean going to war. The Prime </p>
<p>Minister said repeatedly to President Bush that if Saddam complied with the UN </p>
<p>Resolutions, then there would not be any invasion and President Bush agreed with </p>
<p>him on that.</p>
<p>“… So the Prime Minister was saying, ‘We are with you. We need to go down the </p>
<p>UN route, but that does not necessarily mean war. It may well be that Saddam could </p>
<p>comply well short of war.’”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Powell emphasised that telling the US there were “pre-conditions” would have </p>
<p>been a mistake; the UK was “setting out a framework” and “trying to persuade them to </p>
<p>move in a particular direction”.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>441.  Sir David Manning confirmed that Mr Blair himself had written the Note he </b></p>
<p><b>sent to President Bush on 28 July. </b></p>
<p><b>442. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that Mr Blair had drafted the Note to President </p>
<p>Bush himself. Sir David had tried to take the first sentence out because it was “too </p>
<p>sweeping”, it seemed to him “to close off options”, and he did not think that that was </p>
<p>“a sensible place to be”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>443. </b> Asked who else had seen the Note in draft, Sir David Manning stated: </p>
<p>“The only other person I’m aware of who saw the Note in draft was Jonathan Powell </p>
<p>… I went to Jonathan and said, ‘The Prime Minister should not say this’, and we </p>
<p>went up to the flat. We talked through with him [Mr Blair], and I said that the first </p>

<p>sentence should come out and Jonathan agreed, but the Prime Minister decided to </p>
<p>leave it.</p>
<p>“I have always assumed, incidentally, because he saw it as a rhetorical flourish, </p>
<p>not because at that stage he was thinking anything in terms of what the scale of </p>
<p>commitments might be. But it was a sort of emotional statement, I think. But it </p>
<p>seemed to me that it went further than we should have gone.”</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Asked if he thought it “was heard” in the sense Mr Blair intended, Sir David replied:</p>
<p>“… I just don’t know. I thought there was a risk it would be taken at face value. </p>
<p>I can’t tell you whether it actually was …” </p>
<p><b>445. </b> Asked how often his advice was declined on a matter like this, Sir David replied </p>
<p>that there were:</p>
<p>“… not many such moments … he [Mr Blair] was willing to listen to advice, but he </p>
<p>was absolutely happy to pursue his own course … he was elected and it was [for] </p>
<p>him to decide.</p>
<p>“But the Prime Minister had strong views about things. He was absolutely open to </p>
<p>debate, but on a lot of things, if he’d made up his mind, he’d made up his mind.”</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>446.  In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Blair offered further insights into his </b></p>
<p><b>thinking.</b></p>
<p><b>447. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote: </p>
<p>“So it’s impossible not to read the accounts of the meetings during that time without </p>
<p>an assumption of a decision already taken.</p>
<p>“But here is the difference between everyone else and the final decision taker. </p>
<p>Everyone can debate and assume; only one person decides. I knew at that moment </p>
<p>that George had not decided. He had … a conceptual framework in which the pivotal </p>
<p>concept was that Saddam had to come fully into compliance and disarm but he had </p>
<p>taken no final decision on the way to make him.</p>
<p>“In late July, I sent George another personal, private note …”</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>448. </b> Mr Blair described the Note to President Bush as “setting the case for going the UN </p>
<p>route; and stressing again the Middle East Peace Process”. Following the Note he had:</p>
<p>“… reflected with the closest team on the different strands of the challenge. If it </p>
<p>came to war, how did we do it with [the] least bloodshed? That was the military </p>
<p>question. On the basis that we did it, how did we maximise the coalition? That was </p>

<p>the UN question. And how did we do it without provoking uproar across the Middle </p>
<p>East? That was the Arab question.”</p>
<p><b>449. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair to address in a written statement how the US </p>
<p>Administration would have interpreted the opening sentence of his Note and whether </p>
<p>that corresponded with the degree of the commitment he wanted to give.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Mr Blair did not respond directly. In the context of a section of his statement </p>
<p>addressing the fact that the US had no need of a further UN resolution before acting, </p>
<p>Mr Blair wrote that the Note had:</p>
<p>“… set out … the strong reason why, politically, I thought a UN resolution was </p>
<p>necessary, primarily to build a broad coalition against Saddam and to show we </p>
<p>were prepared to disarm him peacefully.”</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Mr Blair also wrote:</p>
<p>“I could not and did not offer some kind of ‘blank cheque’ in how we accomplished </p>
<p>our shared objectives.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Asked subsequently to tell the Inquiry what was in the Note, Mr Blair said that </p>
<p>he thought he had amended the opening sentence and commented: “Frankly I think </p>
<p>he [Sir David Manning] would have preferred me not to have given any undertaking </p>
<p>at all.”</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“What I was saying to President Bush was very clear and simple. It is: You can count </p>
<p>on us. We are going to be with you in tackling this, but here are the difficulties.”</p>
<p><b>454. </b> The Note had been “about all the issues and difficulties”. In Mr Blair’s view, there </p>
<p>was “a very clear and simple decision to take”. America was “going to tackle this issue”. </p>
<p>His first question for President Bush was “do we want it to be a coalition?” His “belief </p>
<p>was it was extremely important for the international community to hold together at this </p>
<p>point”. He did not see 11 September “as an attack on America”. It was “an attack on us </p>
<p>… the West”.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>455. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“America could do it unilaterally. Of course they could, but I would prefer them to do </p>
<p>it multilaterally. So in a sense what I was saying to America was … ‘Whatever the </p>

<p>going to back out because the going gets tough. On the other hand, here are the </p>
<p>difficulties and this is why I think the UN route is the right way to go’.”</p>
<p><b>456. </b> Mr Blair was “absolutely sure” that was how President Bush had interpreted the </p>
<p>Note.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Asked whether the language he had used in his Note was wholly consistent with </p>
<p>his statement for the Inquiry, in which he had written that he had not offered the US </p>
<p>a blank cheque, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he “did not think the Americans were </p>
<p>in any doubt at all about what was being said”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> He could not recall all the precise </p>
<p>conversations, but “this [the Note] was entirely consistent also” with what he was </p>
<p>saying publicly. </p>
<p><b>458. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he was:</p>
<p>“… trying to get them very substantially to change their position. Their position had </p>
<p>been ‘we are going to do it’. Then their position had been because I had asked them </p>
<p>‘Okay with an ultimatum.’ Now their position with huge opposition within his system </p>
<p>was going to be ‘We are going to put this back in the lap of the United Nations’.</p>
<p>“Some of the people in his Administration were saying ‘You are crazy. You are going </p>
<p>to put it back into the bureaucracy of the UN they will swallow it up. You will be back </p>
<p>to all this playing around. In the meantime you have this guy doing what he is doing, </p>
<p>sitting there and nothing happening.’</p>
<p>“So I was having to persuade him to take a view radically different from any of the </p>
<p>people in his Administration so what I was saying to him is ‘I am going to be with you </p>
<p>in handling it this way. I am not going to push you down this path and then back out </p>
<p>when it gets too hot politically, because it is going to get hot for me politically, very, </p>
<p>very much so.’</p>
<p>“I did this because I believed in it. I thought it was the right thing to do … frankly, </p>
<p>whatever phrasing I used, I accept entirely I was saying ‘I am going to be with </p>
<p>America in handling this. However, we should handle it this way’. That was in the </p>
<p>end what they agreed to do. The single thing that is most important over anything </p>
<p>else in this whole business … is that [resolution] 1441 [agreed in November </p>
<p>2002] represented a huge compromise on his part and a huge opportunity for the </p>
<p>international community to get its act together.”</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MANNING’S VISIT TO WASHINGTON</p>
<p><b>459. </b> Before his visit to Washington, Mr Scarlett provided Sir David with a list of points </p>
<p>where more information was needed about Iraq and its intentions, for his “back pocket”, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s CBW and ballistic missile capability …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s ‘red lines’ which would provoke him to use CBW against coalition </p>
<p>forces or his neighbours.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What Saddam plans to do if there is a credible military force being prepared … </p>
<p>Does he [Saddam] consider pre-emption a possibility?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Will he fully accept inspectors if the US threat seems imminent? If he does </p>
<p>accept (likely …), how open is he willing to be?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The cohesion of key military and security organisations … At what point will they </p>
<p>desert/stop doing their duty?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Who might act against Saddam and would they act before Baghdad is occupied </p>
<p>by coalition forces?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The prospects for an uprising of the civil populace in Shia cities and what the </p>
<p>[Iraqi] security forces’ response would be.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The likely popular attitude to a US invasion and the arrival of US or allied troops </p>
<p>on their territory.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What would be the Israeli response to an Iraqi CBW attack?”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>460. </b> Sir David Manning had a “pre-meeting” with Mr Armitage.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Rycroft’s record of the meeting stated that Sir David and Mr Armitage discussed </p>
<p>the US and UK positions.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>462. </b> The US focus was on the disarmament of Iraq, not the re-admittance of inspectors. </p>
<p>Sir David had raised questions about Saddam Hussein’s capabilities and intentions and </p>
<p>the importance of the UN route with an ultimatum for political and “optical” reasons, </p>
<p>not just legal reasons, to change the international context. It would have to be a tough </p>
<p>ultimatum with a short timeframe and no wriggle-room which shifted the onus onto </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Sir David told the Inquiry that he had raised a number of detailed points with </p>
<p>Mr Armitage:</p>

<p>and that: “It was better to be right than to hurry.”</p>

<p><b>465.  During his visit to Washington, Sir David Manning told President Bush that </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair agreed Saddam Hussein had to go, but it would be impossible for the </b></p>
<p><b>UK to take part in any action against Iraq unless it went through the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>466.  Sir David reported that President Bush had been “very struck” by Mr Blair’s </b></p>
<p><b>emphasis on an ultimatum; and that he had not yet made up his mind. Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>should push the need for action through the UN and an ultimatum “very hard” </b></p>
<p><b>in his telephone call with President Bush on 31 July. </b></p>
<p><b>467. </b> Sir David Manning delivered the Note from Mr Blair to President Bush to Dr Rice </p>
<p>on 29 July.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> Sir David told the Inquiry that he and Dr Rice had discussed the Note </p>
<p>during dinner. He had told her that, as the Note made clear: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Britain could only take part in any policy if it was part of a coalition which went </p>
<p>through the United Nations.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Middle East Peace Process was absolutely critical”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[S]o was the effort … to explain why Iraq was an issue and why we felt we had </p>
<p>to tackle it.”</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Sir David told the Inquiry that he had also set out the questions he had raised with </p>
<p>Mr Armitage. </p>
<p><b>469. </b> Sir David Manning’s record of his discussion with Dr Rice for Mr Blair advised that </p>
<p>he had indicated that the Note was sent personally to the President and not intended </p>
<p>for wider circulation.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> Sir David had concluded President Bush wanted the UK to be </p>
<p>involved. There was some reluctance in the US Administration (to involve the UN), but </p>
<p>Mr Blair “just might persuade” President Bush. If he did, that would “transform the public </p>
<p>relations campaign and make action much easier to manage”. </p>
<p><b>470. </b> A meeting in early September had also been discussed which would allow </p>
<p>President Bush to hear “directly” what Mr Blair had to say. </p>

<p>Dr Rice and others in the NSC the following morning.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> To his surprise, he was instead </p>
<p>invited to meet President Bush, and he and Dr Rice had a discussion with President </p>
<p>Bush which lasted 30 or 40 minutes. President Bush had been briefed on the discussion </p>
<p>the previous evening and had “clearly read and studied the Prime Minister’s Note”. </p>
<p>Sir David had been asked to “go over [it] again”; and he had “repeated that it was </p>
<p>impossible for the United Kingdom to take part in any action against Iraq unless it were </p>
<p>through the United Nations. This was our preference but it was also the political reality.” </p>
<p><b>473. </b> In his record of the discussion with President Bush, Sir David Manning wrote that </p>
<p>he had said that Mr Blair agreed Saddam Hussein had to go:</p>
<p>“There was no difference about ends [regime change], but means was an issue. </p>
<p>Iraq was politically very difficult … We were not bidding for a role. We knew that </p>
<p>the US could do the job alone. That would be fine by you if that was the President’s </p>
<p>preference, in which case we would lend moral support. But if he wanted more … </p>
<p>from us, he had to understand the politics from your perspective.”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Sir David Manning reported that President Bush had been “struck by your </p>
<p>[Mr Blair’s] emphasis on the need for an ultimatum” which the Administration would </p>
<p>need to think through. </p>
<p><b>475. </b> Sir David told President Bush that if he:</p>
<p>“… preferred to work with a coalition, the UN route was the way to construct it. </p>
<p>A tough, time-bound, ultimatum to Saddam at the end of the process would put </p>
<p>him at a serious disadvantage while rallying the International community for action </p>
<p>… I thought you had no difficulty with the idea of pre-emption … It was entirely </p>
<p>understandable that we should try to pre-empt him. But it was vital to make the </p>
<p>public case … Awkward and time-consuming though it might be, this was the route </p>
<p>calculated to help European leaders bring their publics and parliaments in support … </p>
<p>[President] Bush should be trying to catch all our fingers in the UN mangle.” </p>
<p><b>476. </b> Sir David reported that President Bush had understood the point and the “issue </p>
<p>he had to reflect on now was ‘how to set the stage’ so that we could pursue the goal </p>
<p>together of getting rid of Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Sir David’s report concluded that President Bush was keen to discuss the Note </p>
<p>with Mr Blair on the telephone on 31 July; and that Mr Blair should go to Washington in </p>
<p>September. Sir David advised: “I do not think this [the UN and an ultimatum] is yet a lost </p>

<p><b>479. </b> Sir David discussed the record of his conversation with President Bush with </p>
<p>Mr Blair at Chequers on 31 July. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I saw the Prime Minister … at Chequers, and I said to him that I did not think </p>
<p>a return to the UN route was a lost cause and it was worth his while to continue </p>
<p>to press the President to go down the UN route. Provisionally an agreement was </p>
<p>reached … for the Prime Minister to go and see the President as soon as the </p>
<p>summer holidays were over, and this is what indeed he did.”</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>480.  Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he felt his meetings with Dr Rice and </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush in Washington at the end of July, when he delivered Mr Blair’s </b></p>
<p><b>Note, had reopened a debate in the US that might have been closed.</b></p>
<p><b>481. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I was quite clear, when I was sent to Washington at the end of July to talk about </p>
<p>the state of the debate in America, that … the United States could take military </p>
<p>action if it wished to, but we could not do so unless the United States decided to go </p>
<p>back to the United Nations.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Subsequently, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he had thought “at the end </p>
<p>of July” that “[President] Bush had probably made up his mind he was just going to go </p>
<p>and attack Iraq at some point over the next few months … and that he had probably </p>
<p>subscribed … to the view that the UN was a distraction”.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> President Bush had asked to </p>
<p>see him because of the point he had made to Dr Rice that the UK could not participate </p>
<p>without going back to the UN. While he was “wary about making this claim”, he had </p>
<p>returned from Washington “feeling that it had reopened a debate that might have been </p>

<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s minute, 30 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>485.  Lord Goldsmith advised Mr Blair on 30 July that military action would be </b></p>
<p><b>unlawful without a new determination by the Security Council of a material and </b></p>
<p><b>flagrant breach by Iraq of its obligations. A new Security Council resolution </b></p>
<p><b>explicitly authorising the use of force would be the most secure and preferred </b></p>
<p><b>legal basis for the use of force.</b></p>
<p><b>486. </b> A report that Mr Blair had been told “by the Government’s lawyers that British </p>
<p>participation in an invasion of Iraq would be illegal” appeared in <i>The Independent</i> on </p>
<p>29 July.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> The article also stated that senior government sources had said that Mr Blair </p>
<p>had “also received conflicting legal opinion from law officers that current UN resolutions </p>
<p>could offer sufficient cover for any military action”. </p>
<p><b>487. </b> Lord Goldsmith sent Mr Blair a 16-paragraph minute on 30 July.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> He wrote that, </p>
<p>as the record of the 23 July meeting set out his views “only in summary form”, and “given </p>
<p>the importance of this matter”, he had thought he should set out his advice “more fully”. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> Lord Goldsmith recapitulated the advice he had given at the 23 July meeting </p>
<p>and stated:</p>
<p>“A new Security Council resolution explicitly authorising the use of force under </p>
<p>Chapter VII would plainly be the most secure, and preferred, legal basis for military </p>
<p>action in the current situation. The question is whether anything less than this would </p>
<p>make military action lawful.”</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Addressing that question, Lord Goldsmith quoted the advice provided by </p>
<p>Mr John Morris (Attorney General 1997 to 1999), supported by Lord Falconer (as </p>
<p>Solicitor General), to Mr Blair in November 1997:</p>
<p>“Charles [Lord Falconer] and I remain of the view that, in the circumstances </p>
<p>presently prevailing, an essential precondition of the renewed use of force to </p>
<p>compel compliance with the cease-fire conditions is that the Security Council has, </p>
<p>in whatever language – whether expressly or impliedly – stated that there has been </p>
<p>a breach of the cease-fire conditions and that the Council considers the breach </p>
<p>sufficiently grave to undermine the basis or effective operation of the cease-fire.”</p>
<p><b>490. </b> Lord Goldsmith advised that reliance on the “revival” of the authorisation for the </p>
<p>use of force in resolution 678 (1990) had been controversial when it was invoked by the </p>

<p>UK in 1998 (Operation Desert Fox), because resolution 1205 (1998) did not itself contain </p>
<p>any explicit authority to use force. </p>
<p><b>491. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote: “I believe that it is essential to show at least some </p>
<p>determination by the Security Council itself that there has been a sufficiently significant </p>
<p>violation of the cease-fire conditions.” Given the time that had elapsed and the impact of </p>
<p>events, he did not “consider it legally possible to rely today on resolution 1205”. </p>
<p><b>492. </b> Lord Goldsmith concluded:</p>
<p>“My view therefore is that in the absence of a fresh resolution by the Security </p>
<p>Council which would at least involve a new determination of a material and flagrant </p>
<p>breach [by Iraq of its obligations], military action would be unlawful. Even if there </p>
<p>were such a resolution, but one which did not explicitly authorise the use of force, </p>
<p>it would remain highly debatable whether it legitimised military action – but without </p>
<p>it the position is, in my view, clear.</p>
<p>“The issuing of an ultimatum to Iraq may be helpful in delivering a clear political </p>
<p>message to Iraq and ensuring that all possible steps have been taken to ensure Iraqi </p>
<p>compliance before force is used. However an ultimatum, whether issued unilaterally </p>
<p>or by the Security Council, would not in itself provide a separate legal base for the </p>
<p>use of force.” </p>
<p><b>493. </b> Copies of Lord Goldsmith’s minute were sent to Mr Straw and Mr Hoon. </p>
<p><b>494.  Mr Powell recorded that Mr Blair and Lord Goldsmith would “discuss further” </b></p>
<p><b>in September.</b></p>
<p><b>495. </b> A note for the No.10 file written by Mr Powell on 31 July recorded that the:</p>
<p>“PM has seen [Lord Goldsmith’s minute], as has David Manning. </p>
<p>“I phoned Private Offices in FCO and MOD on 30/7, at the request of the AG </p>
<p>[Attorney General] (and in his presence) to ask them to destroy their copies to avoid </p>
<p>further leaks. PM to discuss further with AG in September.”</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>496.  Mr Blair told the Inquiry that Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 30 July had </b></p>
<p><b>convinced him that a new resolution was necessary, and that it needed to be the </b></p>
<p><b>right resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>497. </b> Addressing the reference in his minute to reliance on previous resolutions, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the revival argument depends on two things. It depends … on the fact that </p>
<p>resolution 678 authorised the use of force and that resolution 687 suspended it </p>
<p>on conditions, but didn’t, in fact, cancel it … </p>

<p>“… the second requirement that someone has to make a determination of material </p>
<p>breach. In 1998 a determination had been made by the Security Council in </p>
<p>resolution 1205, actually not that there was a material breach, but that there was </p>
<p>a flagrant violation. It sounds worse, actually it is not a legal term at all, and so it </p>
<p>creates confusion … in any event, there was a question whether … in 2002 [you </p>
<p>could], rely upon the fact that, in 1998, the Security Council had said that Iraq was </p>
<p>in flagrant violation? </p>
<p>“My view was … no, you couldn’t, because a lot had happened since then and the </p>
<p>Security Council might take a different view today.</p>
<p>“… you couldn’t rely on 1205 in my judgement in 2002, and you would therefore </p>
<p>need to have at least a new determination by the Security Council … that there was </p>
<p>a material breach.”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>498. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he had sent his minute of 30 July because he </p>
<p>did not want Mr Blair to be in any doubt that he could not agree with President Bush to </p>
<p>use force without going back to the United Nations:</p>
<p>“I wasn’t asked for it. I don’t, frankly, think it was terribly welcome. I do believe that </p>
<p>it may well have been one of the contributing factors to the Prime Minister, to his </p>
<p>great credit, persuading President Bush that he must go down the United Nations </p>
<p>route.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Mr Blair acknowledged that Lord Goldsmith’s advice had had an effect: </p>
<p>“… one of the things that was most important in us going down the UN route was </p>
<p>precisely the legal advice we got.”</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>500. </b> Mr Blair stated: </p>
<p>“… what I took from the advice … was that we needed a fresh resolution. I do point </p>
<p>out that – because this was why at a later stage, I became concerned as to what the </p>
<p>legal problem was, because, of course, we got a further resolution.”</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>501. </b> Asked whether Lord Goldsmith’s advice had been unwelcome, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that it was not particularly welcome … I was dealing with what was already </p>
<p>a difficult situation, and now I became aware we had to take a whole new dimension </p>
<p>into account.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, 31 July 2002</b></p>

<p><b>casus belli” and the need for further work on the optimal route to achieve that, </b></p>
<p><b>was discussed.</b></p>
<p><b>504.  Mr Blair said that he wanted to explore whether the UN was the right route </b></p>
<p><b>to set an ultimatum or whether it would be an obstacle.</b></p>
<p><b>505.  Mr Blair did not tell President Bush that he had been advised that the UK </b></p>

<p><b>506. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 31 July.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> Mr Rycroft’s letter recording </p>
<p>the conversation stated that it had become clear during Sir David Manning’s visit to </p>
<p>Washington that the US was not about to take imminent action in Iraq and was focusing </p>
<p>on the political context. </p>
<p><b>507. </b> In his conversation with President Bush, Mr Blair had made clear that there was </p>
<p>“no doubt that the UK would be with the US on Iraq”. He wanted to explore whether the </p>
<p>UN route was the right way of setting an ultimatum or whether it would be an obstacle </p>
<p>and further work on whether we should go for a UNSCR to address “how we could </p>
<p>ensure that Saddam did not play us around”. There were many parts of Iraq into which </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein could not allow the inspectors. It could be possible to construct a quick </p>
<p>and neat ultimatum but, “If this route were not to produce the right result, we should not </p>
<p>go down it.”</p>
<p><b>508. </b> Mr Blair added that he had an “open mind”:</p>
<p>“If the ultimatum were too difficult or if it complicated the task, we should not do it. </p>
<p>But, if we could, it would be the simplest way of building the coalition and weakening </p>
<p>the opposition to military action. Focusing on the end-state of a democratic Iraq </p>
<p>would give us the moral high ground.” </p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Blair had also discussed the importance of moving forward the MEPP, </p>
<p>including to secure the support of Arab leaders, and the possibility of a visit to the US in </p>

<p><b>calling on Iraq to permit the return of inspectors or face the consequences to </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush at Crawford, by mid-July 2002 little progress had been made. </b></p>
<p><b>525.  By July, the UK Government had concluded that President Bush was </b></p>
<p><b>impatient to move on Iraq. It was concerned that the US Administration was </b></p>
<p><b>contemplating military action in circumstances where it would be very difficult </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>526.  Mr Blair continued to offer the US support for its goal of regime change in </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq but was concerned about the impact of unilateral US military action on the </b></p>
<p><b>UK’s strategic interests across a wide range of issues.</b></p>
<p><b>527.  Mr Blair’s meeting with Ministerial colleagues on 23 July was not seen by </b></p>
<p><b>those involved as having taken decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>528.  Further advice and background material was commissioned, including on </b></p>
<p><b>the possibility of a UN ultimatum to Iraq and the legal basis for action, on the </b></p>
<p><b>assumption that the UK would take part in any military action. </b></p>
<p><b>529.  Mr Blair was advised that there would be “formidable obstacles” to securing </b></p>
<p><b>a new UN resolution incorporating an ultimatum without convincing evidence of </b></p>
<p><b>a greatly increased threat from Iraq. A great deal more work would be needed to </b></p>
<p><b>clarify what the UK was seeking and how that objective might best be achieved.</b></p>
<p><b>530.  Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July sought to persuade President </b></p>
<p><b>Bush to use the UN to build a coalition for action by seeking a partnership with </b></p>
<p><b>the US and setting out a framework for action.</b></p>
<p><b>531.  Mr Blair told President Bush that the UN was the simplest way to encapsulate </b></p>
<p><b>a “casus belli” in some defining way, with an ultimatum to Iraq once military </b></p>
<p><b>forces started to build up in October. That might be backed by a UN resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>532.  Mr Blair thought it unlikely that Saddam Hussein intended to allow </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors to return. If he did, the JIC had advised that Iraq would obstruct the </b></p>
<p><b>work of the inspectors. That could result in a material breach of the obligations </b></p>
<p><b>imposed by the UN.</b></p>
<p><b>533.  The Note reflected Mr Blair’s own views. The proposals had not been </b></p>
<p><b>discussed or agreed with his colleagues.</b></p>
<p><b>534.  Sir David Manning told President Bush that Mr Blair agreed Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>had to go, but it would be impossible for the UK to take part in any action against </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq unless it went through the UN. </b></p>
<p><b>535.  Mr Blair’s initiative had the effect of setting the UK on a path leading to </b></p>
<p><b>diplomatic activity in the UN and the possibility of participation in military action </b></p>
<p><b>in a way that would make it very difficult for the UK subsequently to withdraw its </b></p>
<p><b>support for the US.</b></p>
