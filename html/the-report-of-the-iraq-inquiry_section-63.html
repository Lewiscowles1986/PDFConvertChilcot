<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the arrangements made to provide equipment to forces deploying for operations </p>
<p>in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>difficulties in the provision of Combat Identification (Combat ID), ammunition, </p>
<p>Enhanced Combat Body Armour (ECBA), desert clothing, and equipment to </p>
<p>protect against a chemical or biological attack; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asset tracking.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s military planning for the invasion of Iraq, which is addressed in Sections </p>
<p>6.1 and 6.2;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the background to decisions made by the Treasury on equipment and Urgent </p>
<p>Operational Requirement (UOR) funding, which is described in Section 13.1; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assessments of Iraq’s capabilities and intent. Intelligence assessments relevant </p>
<p>to military planning are addressed in Section 6.2 and the UK’s assessment of </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD programmes in Sections 4.1 to 4.4.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decisions taken between mid-December 2002 and mid-January 2003 to increase </p>
<p>combat forces and bring forward the date on which UK forces might participate in </p>
<p>combat operations compressed the timescales available for preparation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The achievements made in preparing the forces in the time available were very </p>
<p>considerable, but the deployment of forces more quickly than anticipated in the </p>
<p>Defence Planning Assumptions meant that there were some serious equipment </p>
<p>shortfalls when conflict began.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those shortfalls were exacerbated by the lack of an effective asset tracking system, </p>
<p>a lesson from previous operations and exercises that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) </p>
<p>had identified but not adequately addressed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ministers were not fully aware of the risks inherent in the decisions and the MOD and </p>
<p>Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) were not fully aware of the situation on the </p>
<p>ground during the conflict.</p>
<p><b>Planning and readiness for expeditionary operations</b></p>
<p><b>3.  The Armed Forces’ capacity to deploy and sustain expeditionary operations </b></p>
<p><b>was determined by decisions in the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review </i>(SDR).</b></p>
<p><b>4.  The SDR identified a major regional crisis, including in the Gulf, as the most </b></p>
<p><b>demanding scenario against which the UK should plan for military operations.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.3  |  Military equipment (pre-conflict)</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The SDR set out the UK’s “defence requirements in the period to 2015”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>included the UK’s defence priorities, the scenarios in which the Government envisaged </p>
<p>deploying military forces, and what this meant for the UK’s military force structure.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The SDR explained that, “in the post Cold War world”, there was a greater need for </p>
<p>the Armed Forces to build an expeditionary capability because “we must be prepared to </p>
<p>go to the crisis, rather than have the crisis come to us”.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> A supporting essay to the SDR about future military capabilities listed those it </p>
<p>considered “increasingly important”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>command, control, communications and computers and Intelligence, </p>
<p>Surveillance, Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>transport or lift capabilities because of “the trend towards force projections </p>
<p>operations, for which we may need to deploy very rapidly in order to be </p>
<p>successful”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>combat service support (logistics, equipment and medical support), which was </p>
<p>“key to sustaining deployed operations, particularly those of significant duration”; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“protection against chemical and biological weapons” which was described </p>
<p>as critically important in some of the regions in which we are likely to have to </p>
<p>operate, such as the Gulf”.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The SDR was explicit in envisaging the UK operating in a number of areas, including </p>
<p>the Gulf region. It stated:</p>
<p>“We have particularly important national interests and close friendships in the Gulf </p>
<p>… There are already significant sources of instability in these regions – including the </p>
<p>continuing threat represented by Saddam Hussein’s Iraq … These dangers seem </p>
<p>unlikely to diminish and may grow. Many of our Allies and Partners have similar </p>
<p>important interests and friendships in these areas. We would therefore expect to </p>
<p>work with them in responding to any future crises.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The SDR continued:</p>
<p>“Outside Europe, the greatest risks to our national economic and political interest – </p>
<p>and probably to international stability – will remain in the Gulf … this Mission may </p>
<p>involve major combat operations … Such operations also impose demanding </p>
<p>requirements, for example, in relation to strategic transport for deployment and </p>
<p>supply, and to command and control … In operational terms, the most demanding </p>
<p>individual scenario against which we must now plan is no longer all-out war in </p>

<p>Europe but a major regional crisis involving our national interest, perhaps on NATO’s </p>
<p>periphery or in the Gulf.”</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The SDR acknowledged that “major equipments take years to develop”.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> While the SDR identified no definitive timescales for its proposed changes, the MOD </p>
<p>did publish a series of targets in December 1998 as part of its Public Service Agreement </p>
<p>for 1999 to 2002.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> Targets included achieving a “Full Joint Rapid Reaction Forces </p>
<p>Capability by October 2001” and to “achieve reductions in book value of stocks of non-</p>
<p>munitions of £2.2bn by April 2001”.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The Public Service Agreement recognised that the plans set out in the SDR </p>
<p>would “require substantial investment to improve inherited areas of weakness </p>
<p>measured against future operational needs and to fund a continuing major equipment </p>
<p>modernisation programme”. The resources necessary to achieve this would be found </p>
<p>“from making savings from rationalisation in other areas, a continuing programme of </p>
<p>efficiency improvements and smarter procurement”.</p>
<p><b>13.  Decisions on the allocation of resources to the MOD, and within the MOD, </b></p>
<p><b>were underpinned by a set of Defence Planning Assumptions (DPAs) about the </b></p>
<p><b>totality of the commitments that the MOD would expect to meet and sustain at any </b></p>
<p><b>one time and the time needed to prepare for operations.</b></p>
<p><b>14. </b> The ability of the UK to deploy and sustain forces on operations was determined by </p>
<p>the size of the Armed Forces and the readiness of units within the force structure. That </p>
<p>is still the case today.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Decisions on those issues and the allocation of resources to and within the MOD </p>
<p>were based on the DPAs. DPAs were developed by the MOD to convert policy into </p>
<p>detailed guidance that could be used by military planners.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> The DPAs outlined the levels </p>
<p>of activity the Armed Forces were expected to be able to undertake, and the contexts in </p>
<p>which they were expected to operate. They were (and are) used to identify and resource </p>
<p>the planned force structure, capabilities and equipment of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The SDR “set some broad benchmarks for the scale of our planning” and said that </p>
<p>the UK should be able to:</p>
<p>“ – respond to a major international crisis which might require a military effort and </p>
<p>combat operations of a similar scale and duration to the Gulf War when we deployed </p>
<p>an armoured division, 26 major warships and over 80 combat aircraft.</p>
<p>“or</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.3  |  Military equipment (pre-conflict)</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>“ – undertake a more extended deployment on a lesser scale (as over the last </p>
<p>few years in Bosnia) while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial </p>
<p>deployment – which might involve a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air </p>
<p>forces – if this were made necessary by a second crisis. We would not, however, </p>
<p>expect both deployments to involve war-fighting or to maintain them simultaneously </p>
<p>for longer than six months.”</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The DPAs are addressed in more detail in Section 6.1.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> The ‘Defence Strategic Plan’ was a confidential MOD document which included </p>
<p>greater detail than was published in the SDR report.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> The Plan identified some specific </p>
<p>readiness criteria in relation to regional conflict outside NATO:</p>
<p>“… we need to maintain the ability to respond within short warning times to an Iraqi </p>
<p>threat, and to build up forces thereafter. This again requires us to hold capabilities </p>
<p>needed to mount a medium scale deployment at high readiness (30 days) … For a </p>
<p>large scale deployment we need to plan on a framework division being ready within </p>
<p>90 days.”</p>
<p><b>Scales of military operation</b></p>
<p>To inform the DPAs, the scales of military effort, over and above those required for </p>
<p>day-to-day commitments, were defined in the SDR as:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>small scale</b>: “a deployment of battalion size or equivalent”;</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>medium scale</b>: “deployments of brigade size or equivalent”, such as the UK’s </p>
<p>contribution to Bosnia in the mid-1990s;</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>large scale</b>: “deployments of division size or equivalent”, such as the UK’s </p>
<p>contribution to the 1991 Gulf Conflict; and</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>very large scale and full scale</b>: forces needed “to meet significant aggression </p>
<p>against an Ally”, the difference between the two reflected the time available for </p>
<p>preparation – “warning time” – and the size of the threat.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Other factors to be considered included:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>endurance</b> – the likely duration of any operation and the potential need to </p>
<p>sustain a deployment for an indefinite period; and</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>concurrency </b>– the number of operations of a given scale of effort and duration </p>
<p>that could be sustained by the force structure.</p>
<p>More detail on the planning assumptions for the scales of military operation is provided </p>
<p>in Section 6.1.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>Testing the UK’s expeditionary capability: lessons learned?</b></p>
<p><b>19.  The first Gulf Conflict had highlighted inadequacies in the UK’s asset tracking </b></p>
<p><b>and Combat ID equipment.</b></p>
<p><b>20. </b> The UK deployed an armoured division during the Gulf Conflict in 1991, Operation </p>
<p>GRANBY, comprising two combat brigades: 4 Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The MOD identified a number of lessons relating to equipment following the </p>
<p>1991 Gulf Conflict in its <i>Statement on the Defence Estimates</i> in 1992.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> It found that </p>
<p>deficiencies in the reliability of older equipment had “considerable implications” for the </p>
<p>UK’s operational capability, and were “only overcome by a disproportionate application </p>
<p>of maintenance effort and deployment of spares”.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The MOD also found that the volume of stores and equipment that had to be moved </p>
<p>to theatre, and the compressed timescales involved, led to problems with the visibility </p>
<p>of stockholdings and items in transit.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> A temporary system was devised for tracking </p>
<p>operationally vital items but the MOD was examining “improved arrangements for the </p>
<p>future”. The system for allocating priorities in the movement of freight was “overloaded </p>
<p>by the volume of high priority items” and a review had been commissioned to learn the </p>
<p>lessons from the operation.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> A secure and effective battlefield electronic identification system, which later </p>
<p>became known as Combat ID,</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> “did not exist” during Op GRANBY. While practical </p>
<p>steps were taken to avoid engagements between Coalition Forces, a number of </p>
<p>incidents occurred.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The MOD stated that the UK was working with the US “to identify technical and </p>
<p>operational options” to minimise the risk of further incidents. The Defence Research </p>
<p>Agency was “also undertaking a research programme aimed at assessing both short </p>
<p>term solutions and options for the longer term”.</p>
<p><b>25.  Concerns about progress on asset tracking systems were raised in Public </b></p>
<p><b>Accounts Committee reports in 1993, 1997 and 2000.</b></p>
<p><b>26. </b> A Public Accounts Committee report in 1993 on the first Gulf Conflict stated that it </p>
<p>was “concerned the Department did not have a sound system for tracking freight”.</p>

<p>Combat ID enables military forces to distinguish friend from foe during operations, minimising the risk of </p>
<p>accidental destruction of friendly or allied forces, otherwise known as fratricide or Blue-on-Blue incidents. </p>
<p>The systems and procedures in place must be interoperable with those used by allied forces.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.3  |  Military equipment (pre-conflict)</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The Public Accounts Committee stated:</p>
<p>“We consider it unacceptable that the lack of elementary tracking led to some </p>
<p>operationally critical items being ‘lost to view’, and note that 228 aircraft pallets worth </p>
<p>£680,000 went missing completely during GRANBY. The failure to be able to locate </p>
<p>some equipment also led to some duplicate requisitioning.</p>
<p>“We stress the importance of the Department taking urgent action to improve their </p>
<p>management information systems relating to movements … we recommend that the </p>
<p>Department have regard to the best systems in operation in the commercial sector, </p>
<p>in particular those used for keeping track of assets.”</p>
<p><b>28. </b> In 1997, the Public Accounts Committee report on the UK’s operations in the former </p>
<p>Yugoslavia found that it was “unsatisfactory” that asset tracking had “again proved to be </p>
<p>a problem”, despite assurances given by the MOD following the first Gulf Conflict.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The Committee added:</p>
<p>“We suggest that some of the problems with the Department’s asset tracking </p>
<p>systems, particularly the strain on communications systems and the large volumes </p>
<p>of data, could be regarded as foreseeable consequences of an operational </p>
<p>environment. We note that the Department are considering what systems might be </p>
<p>appropriate for the future. We recommend that, in doing this, they give particular </p>
<p>attention to ensuring that they have systems robust enough to deal with operational </p>
<p>conditions; it is at such times that large quantities of equipment and stores tend to </p>
<p>be moving around, and it becomes easy to lose sight of them.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The Public Accounts Committee reported on operations in the former Yugoslavia </p>
<p>again in 2000 and found that:</p>
<p>“The Department has little capacity to monitor the supply chain’s performance in </p>
<p>theatre, nor the condition and reliability of equipments in theatre. The Department </p>
<p>do not expect to have IT systems fully operating to provide such information until </p>
<p>2003 …”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>31.  A military exercise in 2001 found that British equipment did not work well in </b></p>
<p><b>hot and dusty conditions and needed to be improved, given the UK’s focus on </b></p>
<p><b>expeditionary operations.</b></p>
<p><b>32.  The exercise also identified difficulties with clothing, boots and asset </b></p>
<p><b>tracking.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>33. </b> In October 2001, the MOD conducted Exercise Saif Sareea II in Oman.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>exercise, which involved around 22,500 British Armed Forces personnel from all three </p>
<p>services, aimed to test the Armed Forces’ ability to conduct a medium scale operation </p>
<p>over long distances, in the post-SDR expeditionary force structure. It tested the </p>
<p>principle that the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces should be ready to conduct expeditionary </p>
<p>operations in any area of the world at short notice.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> In August 2002, the National Audit Office (NAO) published a report into the exercise, </p>
<p>which included a number of recommendations and identified a number of problems to </p>
<p>be addressed.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Much equipment performed well, including Warrior Armoured Fighting Vehicles </p>
<p>(AFVs) and the C17 strategic lift aircraft.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> As a result of pre-exercise reconnaissance, 4 Armoured Brigade had made a </p>
<p>number of recommendations for the modification of equipment, including ‘desertisation’</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>of Challenger 2 tanks. Despite the recommendation, the Permanent Joint Headquarters </p>
<p>(PJHQ) directed that the modifications would not be required given the predicted climatic </p>
<p>conditions in Oman.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> During the exercise, a number of Challenger 2 tanks experienced difficulties relating </p>
<p>to the hot and dusty conditions. As a result, a much larger quantity of spare parts was </p>
<p>required and equipment availability was lower than expected.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Sand filters were fitted to the engines of Lynx and Chinook helicopters, as a result of </p>
<p>lessons learned from the 1991 Gulf Conflict. Overall helicopter availability, however, was </p>
<p>55 percent.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> The MOD had insufficient desert combat suits and desert boots for all personnel. As </p>
<p>a result, desert-specific clothing was issued only to personnel who would be in theatre </p>
<p>for an extended period. Standard issue boots were unsuitable for the task; 4 Armoured </p>
<p>Brigade’s post-exercise report cited melting boots and foot rot as “a major issue”.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> The NAO reported that asset tracking systems remained weak. The Visibility In </p>
<p>Transit Asset Logging (VITAL) system, introduced as a result of NAO recommendations </p>
<p>following the first Gulf Conflict, had been operating “at 500 percent of its originally </p>
<p>planned capacity” by 2001. It was slow during the exercise, taking 15 minutes to find the </p>
<p>contents of a single ISO container. As VITAL was not available at the point of exiting the </p>
<p>UK, there was no visibility of an item until it arrived in theatre.</p>

<p>Modifications to equipment that enable it to operate in desert conditions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.3  |  Military equipment (pre-conflict)</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>41. </b> On learning lessons, the NAO report stated:</p>
<p>“Some lessons identified during previous operations were re-learned, which </p>
<p>illustrated the tendency that skills learned on medium size operations such as the </p>
<p>Gulf War dissipate over time as people move on. There is a strong argument that </p>
<p>exercises of the size of Saif Sareea need to be conducted regularly in order to keep </p>
<p>skills and experience up to date and to check that lessons previously identified have </p>
<p>been implemented.”</p>
<p><b>42.  In March 2002, the NAO considered the MOD’s progress in implementing </b></p>
<p><b>a Combat ID strategy following the 1998 SDR.</b></p>
<p><b>43. </b> A report by the NAO on 7 March 2002 acknowledged the complexities surrounding </p>
<p>Combat ID and recognised that the MOD had developed a clear strategy for finding a </p>
<p>solution.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>44. </b> The NAO did find, however, that there was more that could be done to move the </p>
<p>issue forward. Amongst the projects it identified as a way of enhancing Combat ID work </p>
<p>was Battlefield Target Identification (BTID). The NAO wrote that the MOD had spent £7m </p>
<p>over the last 10 years on researching land solutions to Combat ID and there had been a </p>
<p>successful trial of a BTID prototype in September 2001. Despite that, a proposal to fit an </p>
<p>armoured brigade with BTID had not passed an Initial Gate Business Case.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The MOD was confident that it would have integrated BTID equipment ready to </p>
<p>participate in a US-led NATO demonstration in September 2005. That would provide an </p>
<p>opportunity to show if its solution was compliant with the relevant NATO Standardisation </p>
<p>Agreement. The MOD was confident that its solution was “already compliant”.</p>
<p><b>46.  A meeting in May 2002 highlighted concerns about whether the readiness </b></p>
<p><b>levels specified in the SDR could be met.</b></p>
<p><b>47. </b> On 21 May, Mr Blair attended a meeting with the Chiefs of Staff, Mr Geoff Hoon, </p>
<p>Defence Secretary, and Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Secretary, to discuss current </p>

<p>Defence Staff (CDS), said that the Armed Forces had “been under-resourced since </p>
<p>the SDR” and they “could not continue to make do”. From “each operation there was a </p>
<p>lengthening list of inadequacies”. In August the MOD “would reach a cliff edge, having </p>

<p><b>49. </b> Adm Boyce also said that SDR readiness levels were not being met:</p>
<p>“For instance, a division should be capable of being produced in 90 days</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> but </p>
<p>it would now be difficult to produce two thirds of a division in 6 months, with </p>
<p>consequences on Iraq (US lead time by contrast would be 3 months).”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> In addition, “resources were needed for new investment to secure information-</p>
<p>dominance for the war on terrorism/asymmetric threats”.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Mr Hoon described the three levels of funding that were required:</p>
<p>“(1) to deliver the SDR assumptions;</p>
<p>(2) to modernise equipment/training to deliver a modern Armed Forces; and</p>
<p>(3) to get the capabilities right post-11 September.”</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Sir Kevin “said the priority was filling gaps in capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>53.  In July 2002, the MOD published a follow-up to the 1998 SDR which confirmed </b></p>
<p><b>that the shift towards expeditionary operations was likely to become more </b></p>
<p><b>pronounced.</b></p>
<p><b>54. </b> In July 2002, the MOD published <i>The Strategic Defence Review: A New Chapter</i>; </p>
<p>an update on the SDR’s progress and a consideration of the “UK’s defence posture and </p>
<p>plans” in light of the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The MOD stated it was likely that the trend towards expeditionary operations </p>
<p>would “become even more pronounced”. While the core regions identified in the SDR – </p>
<p>Europe, the Gulf and the Mediterranean – were likely to remain “the primary focus” of </p>
<p>UK interests, it was “increasingly clear that a coherent and effective campaign against </p>
<p>international terrorism – and indeed other contingencies – may require engagement </p>
<p>further afield more often than perhaps we had previously assumed”.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> On the Armed Forces’ ability to conduct multiple, simultaneous operations, </p>
<p>the MOD wrote:</p>
<p>“The capability of our forces is strained not just by the scale of operations, but by </p>
<p>the number of simultaneous or near-simultaneous operations. Since the SDR we </p>
<p>have assumed that we should plan to be able to undertake either a single major </p>
<p>operation (of a similar scale and duration to our contribution to the Gulf War in </p>
<p>1990-91), or undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as </p>
<p>in the mid-1990s in Bosnia), while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial </p>
<p>deployment – which might involve a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air </p>
<p>21 </p>
<p>This text reflects what is recorded in the note but is not what the SDR stated; it specified that a </p>
<p>framework division should be ready within 90 days.</p>

<p>forces – if this were made necessary by a second crisis. We would not, however, </p>
<p>expect both deployments to involve war-fighting or to maintain them simultaneously </p>
<p>for longer than 6 months.”</p>
<p><b>57. </b> The MOD had “analysed a set of plausible and realistic scenarios” to assess </p>
<p>the demands potentially faced by the UK overseas. That work had taken account of </p>
<p>lessons learned from operations, including in Afghanistan. The MOD recognised that the </p>
<p>particular scenarios it had envisaged might not be “replicated precisely in real life”, but </p>
<p>they did allow the MOD to “draw general conclusions about the capabilities that may be </p>
<p>particularly important”.</p>
<p><b>The UK’s expeditionary capability by 2002</b></p>
<p><b>58.  By 2002, UK forces had not yet acquired the equipment envisaged by the SDR.</b></p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Hoon’s evidence to the Inquiry suggested that the time needed to deliver the </p>
<p>changes envisaged by the SDR and the <i>New Chapter</i> was appreciated:</p>
<p>“[We] were moving the emphasis of the Ministry of Defence away from the kind </p>
<p>of static territorial defence of the Cold War period to a much more flexible … </p>
<p>expeditionary capability. But that sounds quite straightforward to describe. It actually </p>
<p>… requires massive adjustments in capabilities.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Asked if the SDR had “worked itself through satisfactorily” by the time of the </p>
<p>invasion, Lord Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff from May 2003 to April 2006 said </p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> Asked to expand on that, Lord Walker stated that continuously operating outside </p>
<p>the DPAs, and a shortfall in funding, were key reasons.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Equipment </p>
<p>Capability) (DCDS(EC)) from April 2002 to May 2003, told the Inquiry that some </p>
<p>progress towards delivering the capabilities to support this expeditionary capability had </p>
<p>been made by 2002 but the process was not complete: “We had moved some way, but </p>
<p>we still had a fair distance to go.”</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that the SDR contained “big challenges for the </p>
<p>Armed Forces and there were such a large number of actions for implementation for the </p>
<p>SDR that it was inevitably going to take time to work through”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fulton, who succeeded ACM Stirrup as DCDS(EC), </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“My take on it would be that we went to Iraq with our Cold War capability, that there </p>
<p>simply was not time between 1998 and 2002 to re-orientate a Capital Equipment </p>
<p>Programme that stretched for 20 years.”</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Lt Gen Fulton added:</p>
<p>“… it was not possible in the time that I saw it from the time I was first engaged in </p>
<p>the equipment area to be able to turn a Cold War-equipped military into a flexible, </p>
<p>deployable, sustainable military within the life of the equipment plan.”</p>

<p><b>Equipment preparations for the invasion (2002 to 2003)</b></p>
<p><b>Planning begins</b></p>
<p><b>65.  The MOD’s initial thinking on options for military operations in Iraq focused on </b></p>
<p><b>the deployment of an Army division. That would require a minimum of six months’ </b></p>
<p><b>lead time and ideally longer.</b></p>
<p><b>66. </b> Consideration of the UK’s options in the event of a US-led military invasion of Iraq </p>
<p>began at the end of February 2002. That is addressed in detail in Section 6.1.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> This Section considers the arrangements made for providing equipment to forces as </p>
<p>part of the planning process for potential operations in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> On 6 March 2002, the Chiefs of Staff were informed that Iraq was “sliding rapidly up </p>
<p>the scale of interest and a degree of strategic planning was essential at some point in </p>
<p>the near future, given the lead times necessary to shape pol/mil thinking effectively”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>69. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed that Air Chief Marshal Sir Anthony Bagnall, Vice Chief of </p>
<p>the Defence Staff, who was chairing the meeting in CDS’ absence, should “refresh” work </p>
<p>on Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs)</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> to ensure that it was not left “too late”.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> On 3 April, Sir Kevin Tebbit asked Mr Trevor Woolley, MOD Director General </p>
<p>Resources and Plans (DGRP), “just by way of prudent contingency planning you </p>
<p>understand … what a deployment to Iraq of a Division minus (25-30,000 with enablers) </p>
<p>would do to our SDR force structure and concurrency assumptions, assuming all other </p>

<p>13</p>
<p><b>71. </b> On 8 April, following Mr Blair’s talks with President Bush at Crawford, Texas (see </p>
<p>Section 3.2), Mr Hoon instructed the MOD to undertake work on “the specific equipment </p>
<p>requirements (UORs)” necessary to deliver the military options being considered as part </p>
<p>of the initial discussions about possible UK participation in military action against Iraq.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was because “equipment – rather than personnel – was likely to be on the critical </p>
<p>path in terms of deployment timelines”.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Following consultation with Sir Kevin Tebbit and Adm Boyce, Mr Simon Webb, MOD </p>
<p>Policy Director, sent Mr Hoon a think piece entitled ‘Bush and the War on Terrorism’ on </p>
<p>12 April.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> Mr Webb’s minute provided formal advice on the possible scale of any UK </p>
<p>military contribution and included a draft letter to Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Setting out the MOD’s thinking on military issues, Mr Webb wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The fundamental building block for a major US ground force operation is a </p>
<p>division. Only on that scale (requiring 3 brigades as our planning base) would </p>
<p>UK have significant influence over how the operation was developed and </p>
<p>conducted: an independent brigade does not fit into the US structure and would </p>
<p>in any case need substantial divisional scale enablers in order to be safe for high </p>
<p>intensity operations …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Such a deployment would be at the extreme end of the UK’s capacity after the </p>
<p>SDR: it was the scenario against which the ‘large’ option was scaled.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “should seek only to make a respectable large contribution that we can </p>
<p>sustain properly …”</p>
<p><b>74. </b> On 9 May, Sir Kevin Tebbit was sent the first assessment of equipment lead times </p>
<p>for potential operations in Iraq in response to his 3 April request.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> The assessment </p>
<p>noted that a minimum of six months lead time was “necessary to fill essential capability </p>
<p>gaps before we could launch a Gulf War scale operation against Iraq”. It also noted </p>
<p>that the six months lead time was measured from “the point at which an unambiguous </p>
<p>authorisation to spend the necessary money is given”.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> The MOD’s assessment identified several “showstopping” equipment capability </p>
<p>deficiencies with “the timelines for rectifying them”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The desert environment modifications to the Challenger 2 tank would take six </p>
<p>months, with a further three if air filtration was added.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chemical protection measures would require six months and biological </p>
<p>protection measures would require between nine and 12 months.</p>

<p>Support helicopters were identified as “a clear pinch point”. The eight Chinook </p>

<p>two years (see Box, ‘The eight modified Chinooks’, in Section 14.1).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had only enough tented accommodation for “some 2,500 personnel”. </p>
<p>The remainder of the stock was in use on other operations in Afghanistan, the </p>
<p>Balkans and Oman. Acquiring more was identified as a high priority.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The assessment was sent to Adm Boyce and a limited number of senior MOD </p>
<p>officials and military officers.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Adm Boyce instructed that the advice should be circulated to the Single Service </p>

<p><b>79. </b> Shortly afterwards, Sir Kevin Tebbit’s Private Secretary sent a minute to Mr Webb </p>
<p>and Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments) (DCDS(C)), proposing a limited core distribution list for Iraq contingency </p>

<p>37</p>
<p> He wrote: “There may be occasions when you (or indeed the Spending </p>

<p>this would not be frequent.”</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The list did not include the Defence Logistics Organisation (DLO) or the Defence </p>

<p> Lt Gen Pigott </p>

<p><b>84. </b> General Sir Michael Walker was Chief of the General Staff (CGS) from 2000 to </p>
<p>February 2003. His Private Office wrote to the Chiefs of Staff Secretariat on 13 June, </p>
<p>referring to the 9 May advice on equipment lead times.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> He stated that the advice </p>
<p>highlighted “just a few of several areas where key deficiencies exist” if a medium or large </p>
<p>scale operation were to be undertaken. Other areas included battlefield helicopters, </p>
<p>the issue of stocks and the supply of items such as ammunition. Gen Walker would </p>
<p>elaborate on these other areas at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 18 June.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The minutes from the weekly Chiefs of Staff meeting do not record any reference </p>
<p>to a discussion on equipment planning for Iraq.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>86.  As work on military options in the MOD progressed, it was recognised that, </b></p>
<p><b>if a large scale option was pursued, not all of the essential UOR equipment </b></p>
<p><b>required for operations in the Gulf could be procured and fitted within six months.</b></p>
<p><b>87. </b> A paper produced by the SPG on 24 May, ‘Contingency Thinking: Force Generation </p>
<p>and Deployment for the Gulf’, was sent to the Chiefs of Staff and a limited number of </p>
<p>named MOD addressees.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>88. </b> The SPG identified a number of key assumptions that included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Operations would not commence before autumn 2002.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Decisions would not be taken incrementally because that would “add to timelines </p>
<p>by making force generation increasingly complex and costly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Enhancements would be needed to enable units to operate in the Gulf. That </p>
<p>would expose preparations from an early stage given the significant number of </p>
<p>contracts that would be required with industry.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Three broad levels of effort in line with the MOD’s planning assumptions were </p>
<p>examined:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the maximum the UK could provide (a large scale contribution);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “credible” medium scale package; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a small scale package.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Reflecting the UK’s existing military commitments and the most recent MOD </p>

<p>16</p>
<p>“maximum contribution … at the lower end of large scale … medium scale (minus) for </p>
<p>maritime (about 10 major warships), and medium scale for air (about 60 fast jets)”.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The force mix might not be evenly balanced (in terms of scale of effort) across the </p>
<p>sea, land and air environments; but the UK would “always seek to achieve strategic </p>
<p>influence across the three environments such that UK influence is in place throughout </p>
<p>the joint environment”.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> Lt Gen Pigott presented the findings from the SPG analysis to Mr Hoon on 24 May.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He advised that “until there is greater visibility and clarity of US intent our work on </p>
<p>potential approaches to an Iraq campaign remains speculative; this work is advancing </p>
<p>but will lack definition until we engage with the US”.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> Three broad options (“force packages”) had been identified, which were “illustrative </p>
<p>of the maximum potential … contribution” that the UK might be able to make available </p>
<p>for any offensive operations within given time periods:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p> <b>Three months’ warning:</b> Deployment of medium scale joint force – 10 warships </p>
<p>including a carrier, an armoured brigade, about 60 fast jets and associated support. </p>
<p>That was described as at risk of being a “token contribution”. The cost, including </p>
<p>“essential” UORs for equipping the force was estimated at £500m to £800m.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p> <b>Six months’ warning:</b> Deployment of a large scale, war-fighting force in addition </p>
<p>to the medium scale maritime and air components, which would be “comparable </p>
<p>to the 1990/1991 conflict” and “confer significant influence on the control of the </p>
<p>campaign”. Though the land element would be “capable of limited independent </p>
<p>war-fighting”, there would be sustainability issues. Large numbers of vehicles </p>
<p>could become “unserviceable” and there would be reliance on others to supply </p>
<p>ammunition and other stock. There would not be enough time for “the procurement </p>
<p>and fitting of <i>all</i> UOR equipment considered to be essential for operations in the </p>
<p>Gulf (such as the desertisation of all armoured vehicles)”, which would generate </p>
<p>further operational risks and result in the degradation of the “credibility of the UK’s </p>
<p>contribution as [the] campaign unfolded”. That option would require the call out of </p>
<p>5,000-10,000 Reservists and cost £800m to £1.1bn. A decision would need to be </p>
<p>taken immediately for operations to begin in December 2002.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p> <b>Nine months’ warning:</b> The force package would be the same as (b) but would </p>
<p>be better prepared and carry fewer risks, as a result of additional training and </p>
<p>equipment. The package would have “enough capability and sustainability to </p>
<p>be a credible contribution to any coalition”. The cost would be £100m higher </p>
<p>because of a greater volume of UORs.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> The deployment and campaign costs would be additional to the costs identified for </p>
<p>each option.</p>

<p><b>95. </b> Lt Gen Pigott explained that current commitments in Afghanistan</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> and subsequent </p>
<p>recovery and deployment times would “limit the UK’s ability to contribute significantly to </p>
<p>any offensive operations in the region until November at the earliest”.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> If it was “likely that the UK would wish to contribute” to US action “when the call </p>
<p>came”, there was a “need to consider what action” was needed “now to reduce risks </p>
<p>and as far as possible readiness times”.</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Mr Hoon was asked to agree further work to refine contingency planning, to be </p>

<p>involvement in the MOD and discreet approaches to industry.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 31 May, explaining that UK contingency planning </p>
<p>had concluded that, for the UK to have influence on US planning, a significant military </p>
<p>contribution would be needed. That was defined as at “division level” for land forces.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Hoon suggested raising “in general terms, that our contingency planning has </p>
<p>shown we need plenty of warning in order to be able to contribute to military action”.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> The SPG produced a paper in preparation for a “Strategic Think Tank on Iraq”, </p>

<p>46</p>
<p><b>101. </b> While the paper was not designed to consider equipment in detail, a section on </p>
<p>“UK enablers” briefly considered force capability requirements. It reiterated the analysis </p>
<p>of 24 May about what would be possible with either three, six or nine months warning. </p>

<p><b>105. </b> Mr McKane recommended that Sir David should reply to Mr Hoon’s letter of </p>
<p>31 May seeking “further and better particulars on the timelines and precisely what </p>
<p>decisions incurring significant expenditure would be required now in order to keep open </p>
<p>the possibility of a large scale deployment in six months time”.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Sir David commented to Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff: “We </p>
<p>certainly need much greater precision from MOD.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Powell replied that he believed there was “a danger of getting ahead of </p>
<p>ourselves here unless this is absolutely necessary to get us into detailed military </p>
<p>planning with the US”.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> He recommended discussing the issue with Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> Sir David Manning asked Mr McKane to “confirm that it is now absolutely </p>
<p>necessary to get into the detailed planning with the US”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> He added: “I suspect it is </p>
<p>if we are to have a voice.”</p>
<p><b>109. </b> On 25 June, Sir David wrote to Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private </p>
<p>Secretary, referring to Mr Hoon’s letter of 31 May.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“… the Prime Minister has asked for further advice on precisely what steps would </p>
<p>have to be taken now, including financial commitments, in order to keep open the </p>
<p>possibility of deploying a large scale force by the end of this year – bearing in mind </p>
<p>we may not get six months warning …”</p>
<p><b>110. </b> Mr Watkins replied on 26 June with an update on the MOD’s understanding of US </p>
<p>plans.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> He wrote that a small MOD team would be going to Washington and Tampa </p>
<p>“immediately” and that would inform whether the UK could “secure adequate influence </p>
<p>for a large scale contribution”. That would determine the need to commit resources, on </p>
<p>which Mr Hoon would provide “specific advice” shortly.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Lt Gen Pigott, Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence, and </p>

<p>A “running start”, with extra forces being deployed as the initial attacks were </p>
<p>under way, which would have the advantage of surprise and allow for operations </p>
<p>as early as October 2002.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “generated start”, allowing full deployment before the beginning of operations, </p>
<p>which was expected to require three months longer.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Maj Gen Fry wrote that the “running start” option carried considerably more risk </p>
<p>and would be “much more manoeuvrist” than the type of operations which had been </p>
<p>conducted in 1991. A number of issues for the UK were identified including: the role and </p>
<p>timing for a UK contribution; the need for very early decision making; how to integrate </p>
<p>into a complex US plan; levels of risk; UK participation in US exercises; and the likely </p>
<p>US expectations that would result from UK involvement in the planning process.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> On 2 July, Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning with the outcome of the US </p>
<p>visit.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> While a “de facto invitation to the UK and Australia to participate” was “now on </p>
<p>the table”, the extent of the desired UK contribution was “unclear”.</p>
<p><b>115.  In July, the Chiefs of Staff were informed that some stocks were sufficient to </b></p>
<p><b>protect only a medium scale UK deployment from biological attack.</b></p>
<p><b>116. </b> A revised version of the SPG paper ‘UK Military Strategic Thinking on Iraq’</p>
<p> </p>
<p>was </p>
<p>produced on 11 July for a “Strategic Think Tank” on Iraq the following week.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>117. </b> The section on NBC force protection had been expanded to explain that the </p>
<p>UK possessed “sufficient stocks” of Individual Protective Equipment for a large scale </p>
<p>deployment. Taking UOR action (“in 3 months or less”) could address “a number of </p>
<p>shortfalls” but the “main shortfall” was in protection against a Biological Warfare (BW) </p>
<p>attack, for which manufacturing time was needed for additional equipment. There were </p>
<p>limited medical countermeasures to respond to a BW attack and the UK had “adequate </p>
<p>stocks” only to support medium scale UK deployments.</p>
<p><b>118. </b> The sustainment of operations beyond the level set out in the DPAs had “not been </p>
<p>factored into calculations to date”.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> The key risks for UK capabilities included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparation times for the desertisation of vehicles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not knowing whether there was sufficient industrial capacity available to satisfy </p>
<p>the “likely UOR/preparation requirements” (and this could not be resolved until </p>
<p>clearance had been given to engage industry); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>BW medical countermeasures being restricted to a medium scale force package.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Lt Gen Pigott briefed Adm Boyce on 17 July that his view was that the UK should </p>
<p>encourage thinking to move towards action in 2003 to 2004 rather than in 2002 to 2003, </p>
<p>which “had a better chance of success” given the challenges “including political red </p>
<p>cards”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> That was: “Not a recipe for delay, indeed quite the reverse.” It would be difficult </p>
<p>for the UK to send land forces to participate in a “running start” but the UK thinking was </p>
<p>“taking us towards a ‘distinctive’ (Package 3) role”. For any significant contribution, force </p>
<p>preparation would need to start “now”.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> The advice from Lt Gen Pigott and the SPG was discussed in a restricted Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff meeting on 17 July.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>122. </b> In </p>
<p>preparation for a meeting to be held on 18 July, Mr Bowen outlined the MOD’s </p>
<p>thinking in a minute to Mr Hoon on 17 July.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> He drew attention to the US concepts of </p>
<p>“running” and “generated” starts. He advised that the indications were that the US favoured </p>
<p>the “running start” option (which could see US operations beginning during 2002).</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr Bowen suggested that:</p>
<p>“In the meantime, as we begin to explore possible UK contributions we need </p>
<p>to identify what preparation – such as procurement for <b>urgent operational </b></p>
<p><b>requirements</b> – could usefully begin now … ”</p>
<p><b>124.  In mid-July, a Cabinet Office paper invited Ministers to “note” the potentially </b></p>
<p><b>long lead times for equipping UK forces to undertake operations in Iraq and </b></p>
<p><b>sought agreement that the MOD could bring forward proposals for procurement </b></p>
<p><b>of equipment.</b></p>
<p><b>125.  Although it was agreed that the UK should proceed on the assumption that </b></p>
<p><b>the UK would participate in any military action, there was no decision on whether </b></p>
<p><b>funds could be spent on preparations.</b></p>
<p><b>126. </b> The Cabinet Office paper ‘Iraq: Conditions for Military Action’ was issued on </p>
<p>19 July to those attending a meeting to be chaired by Mr Blair on 23 July.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> That meeting </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 3.3.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Ministers were invited to “note the potentially long lead times involved in equipping </p>
<p>UK Armed Forces to undertake operations in the Iraqi theatre”; and to “agree that MOD </p>
<p>should bring forward proposals for the procurement of Urgent Operational Requirements </p>
<p>under cover of the lessons learned from Afghanistan” and the “outcome” of the 2002 </p>

<p><b>128. </b> In preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting, Mr Bowen advised Mr Hoon that Adm Boyce </p>
<p>had directed that UK planning should concentrate on two packages:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a supporting/enabling package, including basing, maritime and air assets, in </p>
<p>which the “the only land contribution would be Special Forces”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a discrete land contribution of a division (minus) for operations in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Mr Bowen wrote that:</p>
<p>“Other options, such as providing land forces to integrate with the US main effort </p>
<p>in the south have been discounted because [sic] the severe difficulties we would </p>
<p>face due to interoperability, deployment time and geographic constraints affecting </p>
<p>logistics in particular.”</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Mr Bowen provided “schematic timelines” showing decision dates and readiness </p>
<p>which could be achieved.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Commenting on Mr Bowen’s advice, Mr Watkins wrote that a division (minus) </p>
<p>option “would require immediate action on UORs etc and early decisions (October) on </p>
<p>reserves”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> The latter would “definitely be visible”.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Separate advice from Lt Gen Pigott to Adm Boyce stated that one of the issues </p>
<p>to be covered in the “way forward” was that it should be agreed to implement “invisible” </p>
<p>UORs now, and to be prepared to advise Ministers later on visible UORs.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>133. </b> A record of the meeting on 23 July stated that Mr Hoon advised Mr Blair that, if he </p>
<p>wanted UK military involvement, Mr Blair “would need to decide this early”.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>134. </b> The meeting concluded that work should proceed on the assumption that the UK </p>
<p>would participate in any military action. Adm Boyce was to tell the US military that “we </p>
<p>were considering a range of options”.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Mr Blair stated that he would “revert on the question of whether funds could be </p>
<p>spent on preparation for this operation”.</p>
<p><b>136.  The MOD identified three possible options for a UK contribution on 26 July </b></p>
<p><b>but no recommendation was made about which option should be selected. The </b></p>
<p><b>largest option comprised the deployment of a division but the MOD was also </b></p>
<p><b>examining the possibility of deploying an additional light brigade and providing </b></p>
<p><b>the framework for a UK-led Corps headquarters.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>137.  Mr Hoon expressed caution about both the timescales required for a UK </b></p>
<p><b>deployment and the impact of potential industrial action by the Fire Brigades </b></p>
<p><b>Union in the autumn.</b></p>
<p><b>138.  Mr Blair was advised that no decision was needed at that stage.</b></p>
<p><b>139. </b> Following the 23 July meeting, No.10 asked the MOD to provide details of the </p>
<p>proposed military campaign, and options for a UK contribution.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Bowen sent Mr Hoon a fuller analysis of the options for a UK contribution on </p>
<p>25 July.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> He advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would take another couple of months to increase forces to medium scale.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“To meet probable US timescales” it would “not be possible to deploy a fully </p>
<p>prepared, fully sustainable armoured division for war-fighting”. A fully prepared </p>
<p>and sustained armoured division (one which could fight a significant Iraqi force) </p>
<p>would take 10 months.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deployment of an armoured division (minus) would only be possible “within </p>
<p>six months of a decision to deploy”, and would have “limited sustainment </p>
<p>and reach”.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> On 26 July, further MOD advice on options for a UK contribution to US-led military </p>
<p>operations in Iraq was provided in a letter from Mr Watkins to Mr Matthew Rycroft, </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Adm Boyce had recommended three options:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 1</b> – an “in-place support package” using forces already in the region.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 2</b> – an “enhanced support package” comprising Package 1 with </p>
<p>additional air and maritime forces. While no conventional land forces could meet </p>
<p>the timescales for the deployment of maritime and air forces: “Special Forces </p>
<p>could be deployed very rapidly to match US timescales and priorities. This is </p>
<p>likely to be very attractive to US planners, and their contribution to success </p>
<p>would be significant …”</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 3</b> – a “discrete UK package” based on deployment of an armoured </p>
<p>division which the MOD envisaged would be used in northern Iraq, in addition to </p>
<p>the forces in Package 2. The UK might consider providing an armoured division </p>
<p>either as part of a US-led Corps or as part of a larger coalition force possibly </p>
<p>led by the UK using the framework of the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps </p>
<p>[ARRC].”</p>

<p><b>143. </b> Mr Watkins stated “it would take <b>six months</b> for the whole division to be in place </p>
<p>and then with limited sustainment and reach”.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Mr Watkins cautioned that:</p>
<p>“… the timescales indicated are the best planning estimates we can make at </p>
<p>this stage … they assume that, as soon as a decision in principle is reached to </p>
<p>participate, funding will be available to improve sustainability … and implement </p>
<p>urgent operational requirements … The ability of industry to respond to our demands </p>
<p>can only be estimated at this stage.”</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Hoon had:</p>
<p>“… commissioned more work in respect of sustainability and UORs with a view to </p>
<p>expediting what would need to be done once a decision in principle was taken, with </p>
<p>what visibility to the public eye and with what cost … It will involve widening the net </p>
<p>of knowledge about this contingency planning within the MOD, although we will not </p>
<p>yet contact industry who will have to be involved at some stage to determine actual </p>
<p>lead times for procurement of UORs.”</p>
<p><b>146. </b> The advice was sent to Mr Blair on 31 July, as one of several “background papers” </p>
<p>he had commissioned at his meeting on 23 July “for summer reading”.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“The military are not yet ready to make a recommendation on which if any of the </p>
<p>three options to go for. Nor can they yet judge whether the US have a winning </p>
<p>concept. They are continuing to work with the US military. You do not need to take </p>
<p>decisions yet.”</p>
<p><b>148.  The MOD advised Mr Hoon on 30 July that there was a shortfall in “essential” </b></p>
<p><b>equipment enhancements for all three packages in respect of protection against </b></p>
<p><b>an Iraqi biological attack. It had “low confidence” that those shortfalls could be </b></p>
<p><b>addressed within six months.</b></p>
<p><b>149.  The MOD sought approval to engage more widely to refine its work on lead </b></p>
<p><b>times but Mr Hoon decided that would be premature.</b></p>
<p><b>150. </b> On 30 July, an MOD official provided Mr Hoon with a “best estimate” of the </p>
<p>equipment enhancements that might be necessary in order to deliver the potential UK </p>
<p>force packages.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>151. </b> In an attached annex, the enhancements had been categorised as either “essential </p>
<p>now”, “full operational capability enhancers”, or “follow-on enhancements”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>152. </b> The shortfall of essential items for Packages 1 and 2 was for NBC equipment that </p>
<p>would be required to treat casualties in the event of an Iraqi biological attack. The MOD </p>
<p>had “low confidence” that it could be obtained within six months. It could take “up to nine </p>
<p>months” to procure certain stocks from industry but further work was needed to identify </p>
<p>other possible sources.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> For enhancements required to achieve full operational capability, the MOD had “a high </p>
<p>degree of confidence” that work could be completed “within six months” for Packages 1 </p>
<p>and 2. For those packages, “none of the enhancement items appear to be a showstopper”.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> For Package 3, the MOD had “lower confidence” in the ability to deliver </p>
<p>desertisation for tanks “for the fully sustained war-fighting role”, which it judged </p>
<p>“would take around ten months”. There would also be a shortfall in NBC protection </p>
<p>and biological detectors if Package 3 were to be adopted. Further work was </p>
<p>being done to see how quickly this could be acquired.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> The purchase of ammunition and spares for land forces and support helicopters </p>
<p>was listed in the annex of equipment which was “essential now” to sustain operations </p>
<p>if Package 3 were to be adopted.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> The official wrote that “the earlier decisions are taken to start Urgent Operational </p>
<p>Requirements (UOR) and sustainability acquisition, the greater the UK’s preparedness </p>
<p>and choice”.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> The MOD official requested approval to engage the Front Line Commands, the </p>
<p>DPA and the DLO to “refine” the MOD’s work on lead times. This was “most pressing” </p>
<p>where the MOD had “low confidence that activity or procurement deemed essential to </p>
<p>the UK force packages” could be achieved within six months.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> The official would seek further approval before the MOD made “any contact with </p>
<p>industry to determine the actual lead-times” for procuring equipment.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> On funding, Mr Hoon was advised that, as any UORs for a campaign in Iraq would </p>
<p>fall outside the MOD’s budget, it would need agreement from the Treasury to call on the </p>
<p>Reserve and to secure funding for the UOR equipment and enhancement measures.</p>
<p><b>160. </b> The Reserve is a fund held by the Treasury intended for genuinely unforeseen </p>
<p>contingencies which departments cannot manage from their own resources and was </p>
<p>used to pay for the net additional costs of military operations (NACMO). The NACMO </p>
<p>included both UOR and non-UOR expenditure associated with operations in Iraq. The </p>
<p>process behind this is explained in Section 13.1, where MOD’s negotiations with the </p>
<p>Treasury are also examined.</p>

<p><b>161. </b> Mr Watkins replied on 31 July, explaining that Mr Hoon had decided “it would be </p>
<p>premature to widen the net of knowledge”; and that:</p>
<p>“… no costs should be incurred on UORs and sustainability enhancements for the </p>
<p>purposes of a campaign in Iraq … No estimates should be submitted to Treasury </p>
<p>Officials.”</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Mr Bowen wrote to Mr Watkins on 1 August, acknowledging Mr Hoon’s clear </p>
<p>directions but pressing “urgently” to take forward work on antitoxin</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> by widening the </p>
<p>MOD planning circle.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> Antitoxin was identified as an “essential” element in all three </p>
<p>packages under consideration, “about whose potential availability we do not know nearly </p>
<p>enough at present”. Mr Bowen wrote:</p>
<p>“In the event of any deployment, the proper preparations to enable British Forces </p>
<p>to deal with the possible biological and chemical release would be essential … It </p>
<p>seems likely that decisions on the acquisition of antitoxin, when they come to be </p>
<p>made, will be on the critical path for the deployment of a war fighting capability.”</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Bowen recommended “strongly” that Mr Hoon should agree that “on a very </p>

<p>26</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Air Vice Marshal Clive Loader, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations), </p>
<p>told Mr Bowen on 16 August that he had been directed to “drill down” on equipment </p>
<p>issues in the planning phase and was setting up an Equipment and Sustainability </p>
<p>Working Group.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> Draft Terms of Reference for the Group were attached.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> AVM Loader wrote that, in accordance with directions from Mr Hoon’s Private </p>
<p>Office, consultation would “be strictly limited to those on the Centurion and Warrior lists”.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> The Terms of Reference described the Working Group’s purpose as “taking </p>
<p>forward the analysis of equipment and sustainability issues” with a “particular emphasis” </p>
<p>on equipment availability and support. Work would be based on all three possible </p>
<p>packages. The Working Group would gather “all internal data” to place itself “in the best </p>
<p>position to take these issues forward” when clearance was granted.</p>
<p><b>170. </b> The Working Group’s scope would be “medical equipment and sustainability </p>
<p>issues”, including the issue of antitoxins. Consultation would be limited to the Centurion </p>
<p>Group, “though outsiders may be approached for specific detail in response to specific </p>
<p>questions where no connection to specific planning for operations against Iraq within </p>
<p>a defined timescale is inferred”.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The Working Group would consider which force elements could be delivered in either </p>
<p>two or four months, aligning to “potential key dates on the US timescale”, from September </p>
<p>2002. Where it was not possible to deliver the force element, the Working Group would </p>
<p>consider the implications upon force packages. That would “allow those firming up the </p>
<p>package” to identify what the UK could provide and where any shortfalls lay.</p>
<p><b>172. </b> “Single Service sustainability work” would be checked by the DLO to ensure that </p>
<p>centrally provided commodities, such as fuel and rations, were included for the entire </p>
<p>force package.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> The Terms of Reference categorised equipment under the same headings provided </p>
<p>in the MOD advice to Mr Hoon on 30 July. Those were defined as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Essential now”: items “without which the force cannot deploy – they are </p>
<p>showstoppers”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Full operational capability enhancers”: required to give the force “a fully </p>
<p>generated operational capability for up to 30 days of combat”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Follow-on enhancements”: items beyond the minimum required for up to </p>
<p>30 days of combat and those that would “achieve a substantial measure of risk </p>
<p>reduction”.</p>

<p>quantities, enhancements for particular geographical locations and an </p>
<p>understanding of priorities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the justification for it – such as what would “the operational penalties” be for not </p>

<p><b>176. </b> On 5 September, Mr Hoon requested detailed advice from Mr Ian Lee, who had </p>
<p>replaced Mr Bowen as MOD Director General Operational Policy, on the UORs assumed </p>
<p>within the “preparation cost figures” for the three packages, “covering the ‘what’, ‘why’ </p>
<p>and ‘when’ for each UOR”.</p>

<p><b>177.  Mr Blair and Mr Hoon agreed on 8 September that the UK should plan </b></p>

<p>described in Section 3.4. Before the meeting, Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning on </p>
<p>6 September with an update on US military planning and “the factors informing decisions </p>
<p>on any UK military contribution”.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> For Package 2, he wrote that “some” UORs would </p>
<p>need to be raised at additional cost to the Reserve.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> For Package 3, Mr Watkins stated that “even were [Operation] FRESCO</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> to end </p>
<p>soon, we could not provide a self-standing division within US timescales”. He continued:</p>
<p>“There would simply not be enough time to carry out the preparations we would </p>
<p>need to make. We would not have enough time to engage industry in order to </p>
<p>improve sustainability (ammunition, etc) and implement UORs to optimise forces </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>180. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were considering what the “maximum effort” UK contribution </p>
<p>could be for a UK ground force operating as part of a larger US force in northern Iraq. </p>
<p>The “illustrative” force package consisted of a divisional HQ, an armoured brigade, an air </p>
<p>assault brigade and a logistics brigade. A decision to commit all those elements would </p>
<p>comprise some 40,000 personnel (including up to 10,000 Reservists).</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to Mr Lee on 9 September, reporting that Mr Hoon </p>
<p>had spoken to Mr Blair on the evening of 8 September following Mr Blair’s return from </p>
<p>Camp David:</p>
<p>“It was agreed that a full UK Divisional contribution was impracticable and the UK </p>
<p>should play down our ability to take on an overall leadership role in the North. The </p>
<p>UK should, however, remain involved, developing the enhanced support package </p>
<p>with the addition of a land medium scale contribution.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Hoon requested that planning should continue. His Private Office added: “For </p>
<p>now actions must remain invisible … and this situation is likely to last for about a month.”</p>
<p><b>183.  MOD officials continued to push for agreement to discuss UORs with a wider </b></p>
<p><b>set of colleagues and the Treasury.</b></p>
<p><b>184.  The MOD sought approval from Mr Hoon to progress 16 “showstoppers” but </b></p>
<p><b>highlighted that there was also a number of urgent UORs that were necessary to </b></p>
<p><b>bring a UK force up to full operational capacity.</b></p>
<p><b>185. </b> On 4 September, in advance of a planned meeting with Mr Hoon, Mr William Nye, </p>
<p>Head of the Treasury Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, briefed Mr Gordon </p>
<p>Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, that MOD officials had done little work to refine </p>
<p>the cost estimates for preparing a medium and large scale force, as they were under </p>
<p>no pressure from Ministers to do so.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> Neither had the MOD done any work to assess </p>
<p>the cost of the campaign itself. Mr Nye said that it would be useful for Mr Brown to </p>
<p>emphasise that the Treasury needed to be involved in some of the discussions on </p>
<p>military planning, to enable it “to be kept informed of the context of financial and </p>
<p>strategic decisions”.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> The Treasury informed the Inquiry that the meeting between Mr Brown and </p>

<p>29</p>
<p>Mr Hoon had “again” run through the three options and “alerted Mr Brown to the likely </p>
<p>broad order costs of Package 2”.</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Hoon and Mr Brown had also agreed to “meet periodically thereafter so that </p>
<p>Mr Hoon could keep Mr Brown in touch with our emerging thinking on the options for </p>
<p>UK involvement in any military action and the implications for UORs”.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>189. </b> On 13 September, Dr Simon Cholerton, a junior official in Secretariat (Overseas) </p>
<p>(Sec(O)), advised Mr Hoon on “the need to take forward essential UOR work” for </p>
<p>potential operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> Mr Hoon was asked to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Note “that we have got as far as we can in defining urgent equipment and </p>
<p>sustainability measures without consulting more widely” and the “very limited </p>
<p>nature of our consultation and the broad scope of the packages on the table” </p>
<p>meant that “we cannot have high confidence in the judgements we have made”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Agree that the MOD should take forward “a limited package of ‘ambiguous’ </p>
<p>tasks on 16 essential UORs” aimed at remaining “invisible” but with enough </p>
<p>information to approach the Treasury.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Note that “these tasks do not cover the full range of capability shortfalls which </p>
<p>have been identified” and work was needed on a wider set of UORs “as soon as </p>
<p>the ‘invisibility’ constraint was lifted” to inform the Treasury. It would require “a </p>
<p>limited expansion” of the Centurion Group.</p>
<p><b>190. </b> The 16 essential UOR “showstoppers” covered all three packages. That included </p>
<p>NBC protection where there was a requirement to “improve” Individual Protective </p>
<p>Equipment, Collective Protection (COLPRO) and NBC detection. Dr Cholerton explained </p>
<p>that, for all three Services, the issue was “not so much that we do not hold equipment </p>
<p>(capability exists), but whether we hold sufficient in the face of the risk”.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Dr Cholerton wrote that six measures were essential for the land component, </p>
<p>notwithstanding the uncertainty over which package would be adopted. That included </p>
<p>desertisation of armoured vehicles and the procurement of additional Enhanced Combat </p>
<p>Body Armour (ECBA), of which only 13,345 sets were available against a potential </p>
<p>deployment of 47,000 personnel. Existing ECBA stocks would be sufficient to equip only </p>
<p>the front line fighting troops. That would “leave support staff – who will nevertheless </p>
<p>potentially face a high risk environment – less well protected”.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 16 September, Mr Hoon received advice on preparatory work to take forward </p>
<p>“a small number of time-critical” UORs for Special Forces.</p>

<p>30</p>
<p><b>193. </b> The MOD suggested it could use the cover of operations in Afghanistan “to handle </p>
<p>these UORs in a discreet fashion”, with costs being attributed to the same “ticket”. </p>
<p>Alternatively, there could be “some reprioritisation” of in-year resources: “Costs would </p>
<p>then be claimed back retrospectively once a more general agreement has been reached </p>
<p>with the Treasury on how to deal with the additional costs of any Iraq operations.”</p>
<p><b>194. </b> On 18 September, Mr McKane, now MOD DGRP, wrote he was “distinctly uneasy” </p>
<p>about both options.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> He proposed to either:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>urgently press for agreement to open up a dialogue with Treasury officials so </p>
<p>that the funding of Iraq-related UORs was put “on to a sound footing”; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>if AM Stirrup deemed the Special Forces’ UORs “to be of such a high priority that </p>
<p>he can re-prioritise the Equipment Plan, then he should do so”. The Defence </p>
<p>budget would have to absorb the costs.</p>
<p><b>195. </b> On 19 September, Sir Kevin Tebbit’s Private Office replied, agreeing with </p>
<p>Mr McKane’s advice that it would be “improper” to use the Afghanistan budget for Iraq </p>
<p>and that it would, “in any case, be evident to Treasury in view of the ‘item by item’ </p>
<p>requirement for scrutiny”.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Sir Kevin did not, however, agree Mr McKane’s suggestion that the UORs could </p>
<p>be met from the equipment budget through re-prioritisation “in view of the precedent </p>
<p>this could set”. Sir Kevin advised Mr Hoon to discuss the issue with Mr Brown “as soon </p>
<p>as possible”, which would be at their meeting scheduled for 23 September. Once that </p>
<p>agreement was in place, the MOD could proceed, “either invisibly or otherwise”.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office decided not to show him the note from 16 September as </p>
<p>a result of the comments from Mr McKane and Sir Kevin.</p>

<p>Squire, Chief of the Air Staff, wrote to Adm Boyce on 16 September.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> He believed that </p>
<p>the situation had changed “considerably” since the Chiefs of Staff last discussed UORs. </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“Political statements from both London and Washington have confirmed that a UN </p>
<p>resolution will, in the first instance be pursued but that, if this fails military action will </p>
<p>follow. Under these circumstances, contingency action to prepare for the eventuality </p>
<p>that the UN resolution is not effective would seem entirely appropriate.”</p>

<p>significant enhancement to operational capability”.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> In response to ACM Squire’s minute, Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Adm Boyce that he </p>
<p>fully understood “the difficulty of possible timelines for military action, as long as the ban </p>
<p>on overt preparations, including for UORs, has to remain in place”.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Sir Kevin added:</p>
<p>“I do not think the political situation has yet evolved sufficiently to be able to </p>
<p>recommend to the Secretary of State that visible steps for contingency work or </p>
<p>procurement action can go forward.”</p>
<p><b>202. </b> Sir Kevin concluded:</p>
<p>“I fear for the time being that we are still in a position of preparing and developing </p>
<p>our UOR cases in readiness for detailed engagement with the Treasury, but stopping </p>
<p>short of visible measures, or indeed, implementation, pending the political decision </p>

<p> Mr Hoon was </p>
<p>content for work to “proceed on some of the UORs” identified in Dr Cholerton’s minute, </p>
<p>but “the potential profile of the remainder would be problematic at the present time”. </p>
<p>Mr Hoon would, “however, be willing to accept further advice in due course”. In the </p>
<p>meantime, “no funds should be committed to Iraq-related UORs” until the Treasury’s </p>
<p>agreement was secured.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> An annex stated that Mr Hoon was content for MOD officials to proceed with </p>
<p>12 of Dr Cholerton’s UORs, but the remaining four required further advice, including </p>
<p>the desertisation of armoured vehicles and ECBA.</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Hoon was content for the Centurion Group to be expanded as requested, which </p>

<p><b>214. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Hoon met separately on 23 September to agree the process for </p>
<p>funding UORs.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> Mr Brown agreed the MOD’s proposal to adopt a similar approach for </p>
<p>managing Iraq UORs to that already in place for Afghanistan UORs, with an initial ceiling </p>
<p>of £150m.</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Hoon undertook to provide “a broad breakdown of this sum”, which he set out </p>
<p>in a letter to Mr Brown on 25 September.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> While he highlighted that “requirements and </p>
<p>priorities may of course change” as US planning developed, Mr Hoon wrote that the first </p>
<p>tranche of measures might include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strategic and theatre communications (approximately £25m to £35m);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Special Forces, including communications and air support (approximately </p>
<p>£40m to £60m);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>force protection measures, including items such as defensive aids for aircraft </p>
<p>and NBC equipment (approximately £20m to £40m); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>initial logistic support, campaign infrastructure and spares (£50m to £100m).</p>
<p><b>216. </b>  MOD and Treasury officials were tasked to work out the detailed arrangements. </p>
<p>Mr Brown would write to Mr Hoon with proposals for handling UORs above the </p>
<p>£150m ceiling.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> On 26 September, Mr McKane met Mr Jonathan Stephens, Treasury Director </p>
<p>Public Services, “to follow up” the meeting between Mr Hoon and Mr Brown.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr McKane explained that the total volume of UORs was likely to cost more than </p>
<p>£150m but the MOD was not yet in a position to say by how much.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Mr McKane also explained that the MOD might wish to use the £150m for “items </p>
<p>that were not strictly speaking UORs” such as force generation costs.</p>
<p><b>220. </b> The Treasury “did not demur” on either point.</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Mr McKane reported that the Treasury asked when Mr Hoon:</p>
<p>“ … was likely to come forward with a firm recommendation on the overall scale of </p>
<p>the British contribution. I said that this was likely to be within the next few weeks </p>
<p>and that obviously the financial cost of the options would be one of the factors to </p>
<p>be weighed in the balance.”</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr David Williams, MOD Director, Directorate Capabilities, Resources and Scrutiny </p>

<p>34</p>
<p><b>223. </b> On 4 October, Mr Williams advised Mr Hoon that the MOD had reached agreement </p>
<p>with the Treasury on the UOR arrangements.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> Work was “in hand” to prioritise the list </p>
<p>of UORs, and to produce business cases for a range of “showstopper” UORs. He sought </p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s agreement for work to “now begin” on a wider range of UORs, “including </p>
<p>discreet consultation with industry”, and for resources to be committed as business </p>
<p>cases were approved.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Williams explained that Ministers were “not normally invited to approve </p>
<p>individual UORs” unless project costs exceeded £400m; all UORs in this instance would </p>
<p>cost less than £100m and fall “well within” the approval authority delegated to one-star </p>
<p>officials.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> Officials would, however, consult Mr Hoon separately where UORs could not </p>
<p>be covered by the ambiguity of operations in Afghanistan, and on the four items where </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had requested further advice in his 17 September note.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Mr Hoon’s Assistant Private Secretary wrote a summary of the points on the </p>
<p>minute, stating: “I believe this is now practical and appropriate. OK?”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Mr Hoon replied: “I would like to see all of them first.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office replied to Mr Williams on 7 October:</p>
<p>“Before agreeing to the implementation process described in your minute … </p>
<p>Mr Hoon wishes to see the UOR priority lists following consideration by the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>228.  As work on UORs progressed, the capability shortfalls identified by </b></p>
<p><b>Dr Cholerton on 13 September proved problematic.</b></p>
<p><b>229. </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 8 October, Lt Gen Pigott prepared an update on the progress of UORs for the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff to consider the following day.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> It separated UORs into two tranches:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tranche 1 to “be implemented forthwith”, funded from the first £150m agreed by </p>
<p>the Treasury; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tranche 2, which would “continue to be updated”.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> Lt Gen Pigott explained that the prioritisation had been governed by:</p>

<p>“the requirement to achieve maximum military effect at the strategic, operational </p>
<p>and tactical levels”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>costs – including a consideration of whether the relative capability of a small </p>
<p>number of more expensive enhancements was more valuable than a larger </p>
<p>number of cheaper ones; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>equipment lead times – those with long lead times had been given priority.</p>
<p><b>231. </b> The difficulties of planning covertly and without wider consultation were reiterated. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Pigott said that meant that there were “a number of particularly problematic </p>
<p>capabilities” which were being addressed urgently by the MOD but “need to be drawn </p>
<p>to the attention of COS and in some cases would benefit from higher level direction”. </p>
<p>Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>NBC COLPRO – the majority of in-service equipment had been purchased </p>
<p>for the 1991 Gulf Conflict but had not been fully taken into service, nor had its </p>
<p>support been fully funded “so its effectiveness for future operations” was still to </p>
<p>be determined.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Antitoxin – work to address the current shortfall was “unlikely to meet the </p>
<p>requirement in less than 6 to 8 months”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ECBA – there were “about 20,000 complete sets of ECBA in-service which </p>
<p>would be “sufficient to equip the Fighting Echelon of the Land Component, but </p>
<p>not the whole Joint Force”. The time taken to produce the shortfall could not be </p>
<p>determined until industry was consulted but their current judgement was that “it </p>
<p>may be very difficult to manufacture the amount of Kevlar armour plates in the </p>
<p>amount required in time”.</p>
<p><b>232. </b> On visibility, Lt Gen Pigott wrote:</p>
<p>“… there will come a point where the presentational challenge will be not so much to </p>
<p>ensure that UOR work remains veiled, but rather to demonstrate that we are taking </p>
<p>action to address perceived capability shortfalls.”</p>
<p><b>233. </b> Lt Gen Pigott wrote that would include issues highlighted in recent NAO reports</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p>on desertisation of armoured vehicles, Combat ID and Saif Sareea II.</p>
<p><b>234. </b> When the Chiefs of Staff discussed the list of UORs on 9 October, it was advised </p>
<p>that the Directorates of Equipment Capability (DECs) and Front Line Commands “were </p>
<p>now engaged in the staffing of UORs”.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The minutes do not record any reference to specific UORs or equipment </p>
<p>capabilities raised by Lt Gen Pigott.</p>
<p>110 </p>
<p>Looking at the NAO publications around this period, it appears that Lt Gen Pigott was referring to one </p>
<p>report: the Saif Sareea report published on 1 August 2002 that dealt with all of the points to which he </p>
<p>refers and that is detailed earlier in this Section.</p>

<p><b>236. </b> Mr Williams wrote to Mr Hoon on the same day, informing him that the Chiefs </p>

<p>112</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>attached the list and asked Mr Hoon to agree that work should now be taken forward </p>
<p>as recommended in his minute of 4 October.</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Williams added that Treasury officials had confirmed that the MOD’s </p>
<p>interpretation of access to the Reserve was shared by Mr Brown and they were ready </p>
<p>to agree the commitment of resources.</p>
<p><b>238. </b>  The list of UORs covered all three Packages and included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>communications equipment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>force protection measures, including NBC equipment and defensive aid suites; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>desertisation measures including clothing, hydration systems and sand filters.</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office commented:</p>
<p>“I suggest we have a system whereby we see the papers in parallel and draw any </p>
<p>dodgy looking ones to your attention.”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Before agreeing Mr Williams’ advice, Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning on 11 October with an update on the UOR process, explaining the approvals </p>
<p>process and that wider consultation was necessary to ensure that cost information was </p>
<p>“soundly based”:</p>
<p>“This consultation will be carefully controlled but will inevitably increase the risk of </p>
<p>wider disclosure. In the majority of cases, this is unlikely to excite public interest. </p>
<p>But the nature of the work involved with some of the essential requirements … will </p>
<p>inevitably lead to comment and speculation that they are linked to preparation for </p>
<p>Iraq. The Defence Secretary judges nevertheless that it is necessary to initiate this </p>
<p>work now to meet likely timescales and has therefore authorised it to proceed”.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>241. </b> On 15 October, Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to Mr Williams, agreeing that the </p>
<p>necessary work should now be undertaken to progress the full range of the prioritised </p>
<p>(Tranche 1) UORs.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> Mr Hoon had asked for a copy of all approvals paperwork so that </p>
<p>he could “maintain an awareness of progress, and be forewarned of any particularly </p>
<p>contentious items”. It would also be useful for Mr Williams to provide “the weekly </p>

<p><b>242. </b> Lt Gen Pigott produced an update on UORs for the Chiefs of Staff on 21 October.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Tranche 1 UORs were being implemented: two UORs had been approved so far and a </p>

<p><b>243. </b> Lt Gen Pigott wrote that a working group had been established to inform the Chiefs </p>
<p>on the risks associated of operating in a CBRN environment. The provision of COLPRO </p>
<p>was being reviewed but detailed checks on armoured vehicle NBC filter packs was not </p>
<p>possible under the current visibility guidelines. Routine appraisals were being carried out </p>
<p>and checks were being incorporated into those.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Where there was no ambiguity about the purpose of the requirement, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>was to be consulted before industry was approached. The measures that fell into this </p>
<p>category included:</p>

<p><b>251. </b> On 30 October, Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to a DCRS official with a query </p>
<p>raised by Mr Hoon while reading the UOR for Challenger 2 modifications:</p>
<p>“He noted that the business case used a latest acceptable in-service date of April </p>

<p>121</p>
<p> He stated that the Challenger 2 </p>
<p>In Service Date (ISD) was “used with 90% confidence” and would “almost certainly be </p>
<p>brought forward”. His understanding was that modifications would “be complete by early </p>
<p>March” and did not require the vehicles to be returned to the factory; the modifications </p>
<p>could be carried out in theatre “if necessary”.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> The official added that it was “not easy to align equipment ISDs with an operation, </p>
<p>when the timing of the latter is moving constantly” but “rough timeframes” were </p>
<p>necessary to negotiate delivery times and costs with industry, with the caveat that they </p>
<p>were liable to change.</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Adm Boyce’s office added:</p>
<p>“While this could add further flexibility to the time required for modifications, we </p>

<p>It was “well recognised” that weapon systems could be “degraded in hot </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Ammunition storage was difficult and high risk.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Most” land vehicles required UOR action “to enable them to operate effectively </p>

<p>18 November.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> The time needed to procure additional COLPRO under UOR action </p>
<p>was “directly related to the amount of equipment required” and it was possible that the </p>
<p>quantity which could be procured and fielded against “the most demanding timeframe </p>
<p>may be insufficient to meet the full requirement”. That could have an impact upon the </p>
<p>UK’s concept of operations (CONOPS). Options would be presented to the Chiefs of </p>

<p><b>263. </b> Lt Gen Pigott reported that 20 UORs had been approved to date, and a further </p>
<p>137 USURs endorsed. The latest ISD being used to gauge the delivery of UORs was </p>
<p>the end of February for Packages 1 and 2 and the end of March for Package 3.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> There were some key equipment gaps “that may not be fully addressed by the </p>

<p>required”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ECBA – “ … it is possible we may not be able to procure sufficient numbers </p>
<p>within the timeframe; this may necessitate differential levels of force protection”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Desert clothing and boots – “It is likely that the numbers required will exceed </p>
<p>the UK’s manufacturing capability. There are operational, force health and </p>
<p>presentational implications in not providing troops with appropriate clothing.”</p>

<p>131</p>
<p> Those included desert clothing, AS90 environmental </p>

<p>to commence discussions with industry on the procurement of desert clothing, ECBA, </p>
<p>water and fuel distribution and medical equipment.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> The official explained that, </p>
<p>although Mr Hoon had already given that permission on 13 November:</p>
<p>“… there is a perception in other areas (including the DLO) that restrictions on </p>
<p>consulting industry remain in place and the uncertainty needs to be removed.”</p>
<p><b>271. </b> The areas where “some concern had been expressed” included the build-up of </p>
<p>sustainability commodities related to land forces and COLPRO.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office replied on 2 December, agreeing that the MOD could </p>
<p>discuss “any items of equipment relating to operations in Iraq” with industry “at the </p>
<p>appropriate stage in the UOR process”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> That was “on the understanding that </p>
<p>appropriate confidentiality will be observed”.</p>
<p><b>273.  In December 2002, the MOD and the Treasury agreed how the MOD would </b></p>
<p><b>claim the cost of military operations against Iraq from the Reserve.</b></p>
<p><b>274. </b> On 28 November, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Brown to request an increase in the UOR </p>

<p>capture all non-UOR additional costs, with a view to repayment from the Reserve in due </p>
<p>course.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> He stated that the current UOR process was “working well”.</p>

<p>42</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Mr Brown agreed on the same day to increase the ceiling for UORs and that the </p>
<p>MOD should begin to capture NACMO, but said that all such costs should be contained </p>
<p>within the UOR ceiling “until any operation is initiated”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>278. </b> On 11 December, Mr Rycroft confirmed that Mr Blair was “content that military </p>

<p>136</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Brown on 13 December, warning him that Mr Blair’s decision </p>
<p>on 9 December would increase the rate at which the MOD incurred additional costs.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>280. </b> The recently agreed £150m tranche was “likely to be exhausted by 20 December”. </p>
<p>Mr Hoon requested an additional £200m for UORs, bringing the UOR total to £500m.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Paul Boateng, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, agreed the request on </p>
<p>23 December.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>282. </b> The discussions leading up to that decision are set out in greater detail in </p>
<p>Section 13.1 which shows that the arrangement for reclaiming the NACMO worked as </p>
<p>intended and did not constrain the military’s ability to conduct operations against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>283.  There was no delay or obstruction on the part of the Treasury that stifled the </b></p>
<p><b>progress of UORs.</b></p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr McKane told the Inquiry that there had been no major obstacles to the </p>
<p>preparations with the Treasury, although the need to return to the Treasury to increase </p>
<p>the tranches of money available had been frustrating to some:</p>
<p>“Inevitably in these kind of circumstances there is an anxiety and a concern on the </p>
<p>part of the Ministry of Defence to get on with things and the – and it did take a month </p>
<p>or so after my first engagement in this for the agreements to be reached to start </p>
<p>to commit money to these Urgent Operational Requirements. But thereafter, the </p>
<p>process operated smoothly. There were some, I think, who were probably frustrated </p>
<p>at the fact that … we were given tranches of money … and I can remember that </p>
<p>we would get quite quickly to the point where we had exhausted the first tranche </p>
<p>and were then involved in the preparation of ministerial correspondence to secure </p>
<p>the release of the next tranche, but I think … that was understandable in the </p>
<p>circumstances.”</p>

<p>balance. Early indications suggested “an initial delivery date of late Feb/Mar 03” </p>
<p>although there may be a longer lead time for some components. As its delivery </p>
<p>could affect the UK’s ability to “field the required capability in the anticipated </p>
<p>timescale”, options for the prioritisation of the available equipment would </p>
<p>continue to be refined.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ECBA – contracts for an additional 37,400 ECBA plates were to be let the </p>

<p>requirement would be “met in full by the end of March”.</p>

<p>and ready in Kuwait by the beginning of March and 7 Armoured Brigade by mid-March. </p>
<p>For the northern option, the UK had been planning for ground combat operations </p>
<p>beginning in mid-April.</p>
<p><b>301.  The implications for equipping three combat brigades and the plans for </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>308. </b> On 21 January, Gen Walker was advised that the delivery times for UORs had </p>
<p>been refined to reflect the compressed timeframes and there were risks associated with </p>
<p>the inability to deliver some key UORs within those.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> Allowance had now been made </p>
<p>to integrate UORs but no allowance had been made for any additional training required, </p>
<p>or any delays in loading or transit to theatre. The tactical implications of the delivery </p>
<p>shortfalls were “not yet well understood”.</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Gen Walker was advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US commitment to loan Combat ID capability had so far proved inconclusive </p>
<p>and there would be “<b>no guarantee of US support</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The DEC was “increasingly optimistic” they would have “full Target ID capability”, </p>
<p>but the necessary measures would have to be fitted in theatre.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Confidence in the delivery of NBC protection was decreasing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The full capability of the Challenger 2 tank’s dust mitigation and AS90’s </p>
<p>environmental enhancement were unlikely to be available until after 31 March </p>
<p>and would have to be fitted in theatre.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fitting of ballistic protection enhancements for Combat Vehicle </p>
<p>Reconnaissance (Tracked) vehicles</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> “may have to take place in theatre”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “little visibility” of the amount of desert clothing “in the hands of </p>
<p>soldiers” and the allocation of clothing had already been reduced from three </p>
<p>sets per man to two sets per man to “try and prevent a shortfall at the start of </p>
<p>operations”. It was necessary to airlift clothing into theatre to meet operational </p>
<p>timelines and “to have a favourable delivery of sizes”. If both of these were </p>
<p>achieved, it was “possible that all troops will have desert clothing and boots in </p>
<p>time for the start of operations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>75 percent of the required unhardened COLPRO would be ready by the start of </p>
<p>March, with the full requirement being met in theatre by 31 March.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “insufficient stock” of COLPRO seals for Armoured Fighting Vehicles </p>
<p>(AFVs) and more could not be procured in time. The lead time to procure seals </p>
<p>was 12 to 36 months.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The situation had improved “markedly” on ECBA, and Gen Walker could “be </p>
<p>confident” that it would be delivered “to all troops in time for the committal of any </p>
<p>ground troops”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The full requirement for battlefield ambulances, however, would not be upgraded </p>
<p>in time for the anticipated start of operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The availability of sand filters for Lynx helicopters was driving the number of </p>

<p>149</p>
<p> That was </p>

<p>required timeframe; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent to which outstanding areas of concern about equipment capabilities </p>
<p>were assessed as being “incapable of resolution” in the required timeframe.</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Lord Bach agreed that the first step was to hold a meeting with key stakeholders </p>
<p>to take stock of the position across all packages but he listed areas that were likely to </p>
<p>be of particular concern, including desertisation of armoured vehicles, Combat ID, NBC </p>
<p>capabilities and clothing and personal equipment. A short paper setting out the “key </p>
<p>areas of shortfall or predicted risk” to assist discussions was requested.</p>
<p><b>312. </b> The minutes from the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 22 January recorded that </p>
<p>“unhelpful media coverage had exposed a UOR problem and it was clear that shortfalls </p>
<p>would mean that FOC [Full Operating Capability] by some UK troops might not be </p>
<p>achieved until 31 March”.</p>

<p><b>313. </b> Adm Boyce directed that “immediate action” should be taken and for commands </p>

<p>officials in order to look at progress of UORs that had already been agreed between </p>
<p>MOD and HMT. I played no part in determining what UORs should or should not be </p>
<p>proceeded with. Those decisions were taken at a stage well before their progress </p>
<p>was looked at by the Committee I chaired. I had played no role before the request in </p>
<p>Jan 2003, nor should I have. UORs were not the responsibility of Min DP: they and </p>
<p>the Defence Logistics Organisation were in the portfolio of Min AF [Mr Ingram].”</p>

<p><b>317. </b> Following his statement to the House of Lords on 20 January, Lord Bach was </p>
<p>advised on 22 January by Mr Williams that there was “not only no need for him to clarify </p>
<p>the statement made earlier this week about ‘desertisation’ but actual disadvantage in </p>
<p>seeking to do so”.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Williams confirmed that only one, “relatively minor”, modification would be </p>
<p>completed before the vehicles deployed. He stated:</p>
<p>“On that basis, if by ‘deployed’ the Minister meant the formal point at which units </p>
<p>begin to leave their main bases and embark for the Gulf, then his statement on </p>
<p>Monday would be misleading. I suspect, however, that Lord Bach meant the point </p>
<p>at which UK forces were likely to become engaged on offensive operations. Given </p>
<p>the context of the question and the fact that many Lords/MPs would not pick up on </p>
<p>the formal military interpretation of the term ‘deployed’, that is probably a reasonable </p>
<p>position to take. If that is the case, I do not judge that a public clarification of the use </p>
<p>of the word ‘deployed’ is either necessary or would add much value.”</p>

<p><b>319. </b> In describing the modifications that the Challenger 2 was undergoing for Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Williams wrote that Lord Bach’s comments were “reasonable: although the full </p>
<p>planned upgrade may not be completed in time, Challenger 2s’ desert performance </p>
<p>should have been enhanced to a useful degree in the right timeframe”.</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr Williams added that, more generally, it was also “important to try and dampen </p>
<p>down speculation” on when equipment modifications were likely to be completed </p>
<p>because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD’s “general line” was that decisions about military action had “not yet </p>
<p>been taken”, and providing indications that it was “working to a hard and fast </p>
<p>deadline” would “undermine that overall public position on the timing of possible </p>
<p>action”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the timeframes for delivery from industry were subject to change; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD’s own assumptions about the timeframe “may again change”.</p>
<p><b>321. </b> Mr Williams suggested that should be considered in light of the broader advice </p>
<p>Lord Bach was expecting later that week.</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Lord Bach received the advice, submitted on behalf of AM Stirrup, on </p>
<p>24 January.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> He was invited to note that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>137 equipment UORs and 108 sustainability UORs had been approved, </p>
<p>the “vast majority” of which remained “on track to deliver to the Front Line </p>
<p>Commands in accordance with planned ISDs”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The compression of timescales for the Land Component, coupled with the </p>
<p>late addition of 16 AA Bde [16 Air Assault Brigade] and the increase in the </p>
<p>Amphibious Task Group to a Brigade(-) has meant that a number of UORs will </p>
<p>not be delivered in full prior to the potential start date of operations.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“None of the shortfalls is deemed to be a ‘showstopper’ and solutions for </p>
<p>mitigating the potential operational risks involved are being developed by PJHQ </p>
<p>and Front Line Commands.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Heavy pressure” would be placed on the supply and equipment support chains </p>
<p>and advanced deployment dates had “added to the weight of UOR items which </p>
<p>were always intended to be fitted in theatre”.</p>
<p><b>323. </b> The advice explained that the majority of UOR shortfalls affected ground forces. </p>
<p>The key areas of concerns were the Challenger 2 desertisation, Combat ID and </p>
<p>in-service stock items that could not be procured through UOR action, such as </p>
<p>COLPRO filters for AFVs.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Lord Bach was advised:</p>
<p>“Whilst there are no showstoppers it should be understood that lack of some UOR </p>
<p>capabilities … could require Commanders to make choices they might not otherwise </p>
<p>have to make and could reduce operational effectiveness. Equally, delivery of the </p>
<p>UOR capability cannot remove risks completely. The overall operational impact may </p>
<p>be to constrain commanders’ options, reduce the tempo of operations and risk the </p>
<p>ability to operate in close conjunction with US forces.”</p>
<p><b>325. </b> In response to the high level of media and Parliamentary interest in the availability </p>
<p>of equipment, as a general guideline, one of the points to emphasise was that:</p>
<p>“Our forces will have the equipment they need to undertake any tasks assigned </p>
<p>to them as part of possible operations. The safety and well-being of our Service </p>
<p>personnel are of paramount importance. Where appropriate, we should look to </p>
<p>compare capabilities to those available in the 1991 Gulf War.”</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Details of the key shortfalls were provided in an annex, which largely reflected the </p>
<p>advice to Gen Walker of 21 January. Additional information included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As 3 Commando Brigade and deploying RAF personnel had been fully equipped </p>
<p>with desert clothing, there were “no remaining stocks”. An additional 32,500 sets </p>
<p>would be delivered on 7 March and the full requirement would be available on </p>
<p>28 March. It would need to be airlifted into theatre.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sufficient ECBA plates would be available “to equip the entire force” by 7 March </p>
<p>and there was confidence that “the full ECBA capability” could be delivered </p>
<p>“before the committal of any ground troops”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The unavailability of COLPRO for AFVs remained the same, although the </p>
<p>Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) had provided advice that </p>
<p>reduced the number of filter changes required “while maintaining sufficient </p>
<p>protection for the crew”. Even the reduced number could not be resourced and </p>
<p>“the limited in-service stocks” would “therefore require prioritisation”.</p>
<p><b>327. </b>  On the same day, as instructed at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 22 January, </p>
<p>Air Chief Marshal Sir Malcolm Pledger, Chief of Defence Logistics (CDL), wrote to </p>
<p>Adm Boyce about which capability and sustainability UORs were unavailable within </p>
<p>current timelines.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> Those were listed in an annex which was consistent with other </p>
<p>briefings on the shortfalls.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Referring to the inability to approach industry earlier and the constraint placed </p>
<p>upon funds while arrangements were agreed with the Treasury, ACM Pledger stated </p>
<p>that Adm Boyce should be aware of “the relative success” that had been achieved by </p>

<p>“No strategic issues, that would deny UK the option to conduct a military campaign, </p>
<p>arose within the UOR/Operational Sustainability staffing, hence it has not been </p>
<p>raised at COS(O) by CDL or DCDS(EC). However, regular briefing has occurred </p>
<p>through the established DCMO [Defence Crisis Management Organisation] process </p>
<p>(Iraq Stocktakes and through SPG); PJHQ briefings (both at CJO’s Jt Comd’s </p>
<p>Seminars and through the range of staff level planning meetings, which includes </p>
<p>FLC representation). These briefings repeatedly flagged the consequences of </p>
<p>defining force packages without the full knowledge of the impact of the associated </p>
<p>logistic and capability enhancements on the basic plan.”</p>
<p><b>330. </b> ACM Pledger added that Adm Boyce “should feel assured” that the DLO was </p>
<p>“wholly focused” on its delivery of UORs and would “continue to make every effort to </p>
<p>synchronise the delivery of these equipments to theatre in a timely manner”.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> Lord Bach chaired his first meeting about UORs on 27 January.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> The points </p>
<p>recorded from the introductory discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Given that “authority fully to engage industry had only been received on </p>
<p>2nd December, the time scales were challenging.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The high priority requirements for Packages 0-2 were “capable of being met by </p>
<p>28th February”. The “key risks” were now the UK’s ability to “deliver, fit and train </p>
<p>on UOR equipment whilst the force was deploying to or in theatre”. In respect to </p>
<p>Packages 0-2, these risks were considered “manageable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The compression of timescales and expansion of Package 3 meant an </p>
<p>“increased risk that package 3 UORs would not be delivered before operations </p>
<p>commenced”. None of the resultant shortfalls were assessed as being a </p>
<p>“showstopper” but “we would only be clear of the operational implications once </p>
<p>detailed plans had been worked up”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[W]hatever the operational significance of delays in delivering UORs”, it was </p>
<p>expected that media would focus on “equipment shortcomings”; being well </p>
<p>prepared to win the “presentational argument was vital”. That was not just </p>
<p>to preserve the MOD’s reputation, but was “a key aspect of securing and </p>
<p>preserving public support for the whole enterprise”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “key question for the future” was why the forces “were not better prepared for </p>
<p>the kind of operations now in prospect”, given the conclusions of the SDR about </p>
<p>the likelihood of operations in the Middle East. The UK “needed to be more </p>
<p>intelligent” about its holdings of certain long-term lead items such as desert </p>
<p>clothing, NBC filters and COLPRO, and about “the extent to which equipment </p>
<p>was capable of operating at a range of environmental conditions”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>332. </b> The meeting discussed particular shortfalls, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need to “find a better way of explaining the improvements” being </p>
<p>made to Challenger 2 tanks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was still no assurance that the US would loan Combat ID assets – Lt Gen </p>
<p>Reith was being briefed “to raise this personally” with General Tommy Franks, </p>
<p>Commander US Central Command (CENTCOM).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ …[I]nnovative measures were in place to acquire sufficient stocks of desert </p>
<p>clothing and boots for at least two sets to be provided to all personnel in </p>
<p>theatre by mid-March” and Lord Bach asked officials to review with industry the </p>
<p>practicality of extending the number of personnel issued with three sets to cover </p>
<p>all those deploying.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There remained concerns about NBC capabilities – Lord Bach requested further </p>
<p>advice on the operational risk within three days.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> On 28 January, Mr Hoon asked Adm Boyce for “a clear recommendation from </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff” as to whether UK forces could “participate in the operational plan </p>
<p>as currently understood, particularly the potential start of major ground operations on </p>
<p>3 March”.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p><b>334. </b> If this was not possible, Adm Boyce was asked on what date land forces could </p>
<p>participate and what date would be the “implied start of initial combat operations”. </p>
<p>The advice was requested by 3pm the following day.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> ACM Bagnall’s Private Office replied on 29 January, stating:</p>
<p>“There are, in absolute terms, no showstoppers. In the case of maritime forces, all </p>
<p>UORs should be in place by 28 February. Some contractual risk remains, but the </p>
<p>systems involved carry a low operational risk. In the air environment, the force will </p>
<p>be ready for operation by 28 February …</p>
<p>“The land environment carries the greatest risk in two areas: Challenger 2 and </p>
<p>Combat Identification.”</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>336. </b> The work in hand for Challenger 2 vehicles suggested that their availability and </p>
<p>serviceability would “improve significantly” by 18 March when certain modifications were </p>
<p>due to be completed. The situation would improve again after 7 April when new filters </p>
<p>were fitted.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> For Combat ID, systems to improve situational awareness within the UK and US </p>
<p>forces were currently being evaluated in Germany. It was “not yet clear” whether they </p>
<p>could “be integrated into a UK vehicle in the time available” but early indications were </p>
<p>that the work was “proceeding well”.</p>

<p><b>338. </b> ACM Bagnall’s Private Office concluded:</p>
<p>“In sum, if the start date for land operations is delayed, there will be greater time </p>
<p>to embody the required land UORs. However, as I have noted earlier, there are </p>
<p>no showstoppers.”</p>
<p><b>339. </b> The minutes of the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 29 January recorded that the </p>
<p>“focus had shifted to what equipment was being delivered rather than what was being </p>
<p>procured”.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> It was important that “all measures were taken” to ensure that equipment </p>
<p>was fitted and not just made available. A “coherent plan was required with clear guidance </p>
<p>on the division of responsibilities for ensuring equipment was available to units in theatre”.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> There was “a concern over the availability of desertised Challenger 2s” and, </p>
<p>although the Land Component Commander was content with the current position, </p>
<p>Adm Boyce “noted that it would clearly be better if availability was improved as a result </p>
<p>of any slip in campaign timelines that allowed extra UOR work to be completed”.</p>

<p> He continued:</p>
<p>“I understand that we are currently awaiting the formulation of coherent US policy </p>
<p>… I am conscious that significant effort has been made at various levels to press </p>

<p><b>347. </b> Mr Watkins wrote on Mr Hoon’s copy of the note: “He is right to focus on the </p>

<p>165</p>
<p><b>348. </b> On 7 January 2003, Mr Hoon was asked in the House of Commons what lessons </p>
<p>had been learned from the past to ensure that British forces were equipped against the </p>

<p>166</p>
<p> He replied:</p>
<p>“… we are engaged in a process of ensuring that combat identification is dealt with </p>

<p><b>350. </b> On Iraq, the officer stated that the Combat ID UOR was “still being scoped” and </p>
<p>summarised what the requirement was likely to encompass.</p>
<p><b>351. </b> A UOR was being developed to mirror “ad-hoc” US measures being considered </p>
<p>for forthcoming operations:</p>
<p>“The UK has been anything but dilatory in developing a technological Combat ID </p>
<p>capability. We have actually been a leading light in this area. That no solution is </p>
<p>yet available anywhere in the world reflects merely the complexity of achieving </p>

<p>“To meet the requirement in the short term, current UOR action will give the UK an </p>
<p>identical Combat ID solution to that deployed by the US. In the circumstances, this </p>
<p>is as close to the ideal as we could have hoped to achieve.”</p>
<p><b>352. </b> AVM Loader provided a summary note of work in progress on Combat ID for ACM </p>
<p>Bagnall, recording that, “contrary to press speculation, progress continues to be made </p>
<p>since the conflict in the Gulf”, but that “notwithstanding any measures taken or currently </p>
<p>under consideration, fratricide will always remain a real risk in the heat of conflict”.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>353. </b> AVM Loader explained that work continued but progress had been slow because </p>
<p>measures could not be developed in isolation. The alignment of UK measures with those </p>
<p>in the US had “been hampered by the lack of a coherent policy” but, to ensure that some </p>
<p>capability could be delivered in time, UORs had been based upon assumptions agreed </p>
<p>with key stakeholders and US Department of Defense and Army staff.</p>

<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He replied:</p>
<p>“… we take combat identification and the risk of friendly fire extremely seriously </p>
<p>… Lives depend on it. We believe that our combat identification procedures are </p>
<p>effective. We have deployed successfully as a country on many operations since the </p>
<p>tragedies in this field during the Gulf conflict. There have been no reported incidents </p>
<p>of fratricide, or blue on blue, involving UK forces. I say that with caution because </p>
<p>whatever technology one puts in, and however sophisticated it may be, these things </p>
<p>sometimes happen.</p>
<p>“In the event of military action, British troops will be fully interoperable with United </p>
<p>States troops for combat identification. That capability, including new equipment </p>
<p>options, are [sic] currently being procured.”</p>
<p><b>356. </b> One of the questions put to Mr Hoon by Mr Jenkin in the House of Commons on </p>
<p>20 January (referred to earlier in this Section) was whether British troops would have </p>
<p>access to electronic identification equipment, already fitted to US tanks and armour, </p>
<p>to prevent the risk of fratricide.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> Mr Hoon replied:</p>

<p>171</p>
<p> When asked by Mr Mates whether he was “happy” </p>
<p>that British soldiers were most likely to be killed by “our own people rather than the </p>

<p>“We are looking at everything we can do for combat identification. I think the </p>

<p><b>364. </b> Lord Bach chaired a second UOR meeting on 3 February.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> In addition to the </p>
<p>points in the 31 January update, the record of the meeting stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Bach asked for the pressure on industry “to be kept up” on the delivery of </p>
<p>desert clothing and had “stressed the need to work hard to rebut the idea” that </p>
<p>troops were “ill-equipped” for the environmental conditions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risk assessment for the shortfall of COLPRO filters “against the worst </p>
<p>case requirement” was ongoing and expected by the end of the week; Lord </p>
<p>Bach “<b>would be grateful for urgent sight of the headlines from this work, </b></p>
<p><b>together with advice on the operational penalties”</b>.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Based upon the current shipping plan of filters, a “two fold increase in the </p>
<p>capability” of all deployed Challenger 2 tanks was expected by 18 March and a </p>
<p>“four fold increase” by 7 April. Lord Bach sought confirmation that that remained </p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concerns remained about “the ability of AS90 to operate in hot and dusty </p>
<p>conditions”. The necessary modifications were not expected to be delivered into </p>
<p>theatre until the end of March and “would each take 63 man-hours to fit”. Lord </p>
<p>Bach asked for industry “to be pressed again on whether they cannot work faster </p>
<p>to meet the requirement” and welcomed advice on the operational implications.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US was “being helpful” and the loan of Combat ID systems had been </p>
<p>agreed with “the issue now being how they will be deployed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Aside from the timing of completing outstanding UORs (“which was tight”), the </p>
<p>“key residual concerns related to Combat ID and NBC protection”.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> On 7 February, AM Stirrup advised Lord Bach that 156 business cases for </p>
<p>equipment UORs and 108 sustainability UORs had been approved.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>366. </b> AM Stirrup wrote that the operational risk associated with the lack of NBC filters </p>
<p>for AFVs had been assessed as “minimal”. The Directorate of Joint Warfare (DJW) </p>
<p>had assessed the probability of a CW attack on all deployed AFVs as “low” and that </p>
<p>filters could therefore “be managed on a theatre-wide basis”. The UK’s NBC capability </p>
<p>would be “initially fragile” but would become “more robust by mid-March” as UORs were </p>
<p>delivered, in-service equipment was refurbished and surge training completed.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> There were “no major concerns” regarding the availability of desertisation filters </p>

<p>delivery of measures for the AS90. The level of operational risk would be determined by </p>
<p>weather conditions but was “not deemed to be significant”.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> The Senior British Liaison Officer in theatre was examining when Combat </p>
<p>ID systems would become available and was in discussions with the US. An initial </p>
<p>operating capability for light forces was expected by late February, with a full operating </p>
<p>capability “available not later than 18 March”.</p>
<p><b>369. </b> On the same day, Lt Gen Reith received a letter from Sir Robert Walmsley, the </p>
<p>Chief of Defence Procurement, about the challenges created by an increase in the </p>
<p>quantities of equipment to be delivered by air and sea as a result of the compressed </p>
<p>timescales before military action.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> He believed the DPA could deliver what was required </p>
<p>and that those capabilities would reach the front line. He added:</p>
<p>“We continue to press Industry whom I am confident are doing all that they can to </p>
<p>achieve early delivery. Industry is, however, now working to capacity and I would not </p>
<p>anticipate any significant improvement in the currently projected delivery profiles.”</p>
<p><b>370. </b> In discussing AM Stirrup’s update, Lord Bach’s meeting on 10 February noted that </p>
<p>while the UK’s NBC capability was judged to be fragile:</p>
<p>“ … all that could be done to improve NBC protection capabilities was being done </p>
<p>… The bottom line was if the Iraqis launched repeated mass attacks, operational </p>
<p>effectiveness would be impaired; but we did not believe that they could do so.”</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>371. </b> The record of the meeting also stated:</p>
<p>“… it was noteworthy that a number of deficiencies with which we were currently </p>
<p>grappling (Combat ID, DAS [Defensive Aid Suites] for transport aircraft, equipment </p>
<p>readiness, desertisation) had been identified in post-GRANBY lessons learned </p>
<p>reports …”</p>
<p><b>Reporting equipment issues from theatre</b></p>
<p>On 11 February 2003, Lord Bach requested advice by the end of that week on whether a </p>
<p>direct link from theatre for reporting equipment issues should be established, and how the </p>
<p>reporting might work.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>The advice had not been received by 17 February.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> The record of the meeting stated:</p>
<p>“The Minister attached real importance to this and would like advice on what </p>

<p>ACM Bagnall replied on 21 February:</p>
<p>“… there is a need to avoid cutting across established and well understood command </p>
<p>chains from theatre, through CJO, to CDS. Beyond that, given the large number of </p>
<p>people who are at geographically remote locations in theatre – some of whom are still </p>
<p>en route and many are in the process of acclimatisation and preparation for possible </p>
<p>operations – it would be very difficult for an agent outside the command chain to keep </p>
<p>an eye on the many equipment issues which may arise.”</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>ACM Bagnall acknowledged “fully” the need for “a rapid and timely information flow” that </p>
<p>could quickly alert Ministers to potential equipment issues and facilitate a swift response. </p>
<p>He wrote that Lt Gen Reith had “taken steps to alert DCDS(EC) as a matter of urgency to </p>
<p>any matters which require his attention” and similar arrangements were in place in terms </p>
<p>of the interface with the DLO.</p>
<p>A handwritten note on ACM Bagnall’s minute from Lord Bach’s Private Office stated:</p>
<p>“Minister the predictable answer: VCDS agreed with Jock [Stirrup] but the COS </p>
<p>wouldn’t wear it. So I think we’ll have to live with this.”</p>

<p>There were “currently no major concerns regarding the availability of desert </p>

<p><b>377.  In mid-February, the MOD told Mr Blair that British troops would be </b></p>

<p><b>378. </b> A Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessment on 19 February judged that </p>
<p>southern Iraq was “the most likely area for the first use of CBW against both Coalition </p>

<p>186</p>
<p> It did not </p>
<p>address the likelihood of a CBW attack.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> On 20 February, Mr Blair asked the MOD for advice on a number of detailed </p>
<p>questions following the publication of a report on Iraq by the International Institute of </p>
<p>Strategic Studies.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> That paper is addressed in detail in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> One question asked by Mr Blair was: “What is the prospect of a pre-emptive BW or </p>
<p>CW attack on our troops in Kuwait, and are we certain we are adequately prepared and </p>
<p>our troops protected?”</p>
<p><b>381. </b> The MOD replied that Iraq retained the capability “(through a variety of means) to </p>
<p>pre-emptively deliver CBW against Coalition Forces in Kuwait”.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> The question was “one </p>
<p>of intent”. In the MOD’s view it remained “highly unlikely whilst Saddam believes war </p>
<p>can be averted”. If he was convinced that war was “inevitable and imminent” that “might </p>
<p>make a pre-emptive move more attractive” but it was “more likely that Saddam would </p>
<p>deploy CBW after the onset of the campaign”.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> The planned levels of NBC defence equipment “should enable all troops to </p>
<p>withstand initial BW or CW attack”.</p>
<p><b>383. </b> The UOR update on 21 February informed Lord Bach that 167 business cases had </p>

<p>Further to ACM Bagnall’s note earlier that day, PJHQ had set up a </p>

<p>theatre” once delivery dates were known by industry.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There was a shortfall of 15,000 ComboPens out of a total requirement for </p>
<p>135,000, but “every effort” was being made to procure more and “re-life existing </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>390. </b> On “CBRN Risks”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “most significant issue” was that the majority of RVDs had been found </p>
<p>to be unserviceable, but that a “workaround” solution had been found. It had </p>
<p>been agreed with DJW and PJHQ that this was “not a showstopper” although </p>
<p>it would “impose a degree of operational degradation” which would increase as </p>
<p>temperatures in theatre rose.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>New respirators were being procured and it was expected that this delivery </p>
<p>would “enable 99.5% of personnel” to have a respirator that would fit them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further investigation had revealed there were sufficient stocks of ComboPens.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further briefing would be provided to the Chiefs of Staff the following week.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> An attached annex on the overall sustainability assessment of equipment stated </p>
<p>that helicopter support remained fragile, despite a reduction in flying hours. That was </p>
<p>attributed to long lead times for spare parts, and “historic levels of STP [Short Term Plan] </p>
<p>funding”.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> On 3 March, Adm Boyce was advised by Lt Gen Reith that equipment procured </p>
<p>through UORs was being prioritised for fitting and being carefully monitored, but it was </p>
<p>“probable” that some equipment would not be in service as the UK crossed “the line of </p>
<p>departure”.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p> The “some” was referenced with a footnote stating: “The original RDD </p>
<p>[Required Delivery Date] for the UORs was 31 March 03.”</p>
<p><b>393. </b> Priorities had been set by PJHQ based on four categories:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Priority 1: “UORs with the potential to delay the start of operations”, including </p>
<p>Combat ID, Challenger 2 desertisation measures, NBC equipment and </p>
<p>battlefield ambulances.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Priority 2: UORs that enhance combat operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Priority 3: “enablers” for aftermath operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Priority 4: “Others”.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> Lt Gen Reith wrote that the late delivery of some UORs meant that deployment and </p>
<p>prioritisation issues would become “more acute” as the date for operations approached. </p>
<p>He added: “Any decision not to fit a UOR will be based on operational advice by theatre </p>
<p>and recorded.”</p>
<p><b>395. </b> The record of Lord Bach’s meeting on 3 March stated:</p>
<p>“… the major remaining area of concern was in NBC. Although things were not as </p>
<p>bad as had been feared, with the respirator and ComboPen issues – for the time </p>
<p>being – resolved, there were still outstanding concerns about some aspects of our </p>

<p>NAIADs would not be available before April, RVDs should be delivered into theatre by </p>
<p>14 March and “industry was working flat out” to try and overcome the problem of water </p>
<p>bottle tops. The Chiefs of Staff would discuss NBC at their next meeting.</p>
<p><b>397. </b> The meeting also noted that the sustainability of helicopters was “a concern, </p>
<p>including sand filters for Lynx” aircraft.</p>
<p><b>398. </b> A ‘CBRN Risk Overview’ was circulated to the Chiefs of Staff on 3 March.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It stated:</p>
<p>“For operations launched at 15th March 03 we believe that our overall CBRN </p>
<p>defence remains fragile against a sustained CBRN attack … Against the more likely </p>
<p>scenario of occasional limited short range attacks our defences are less fragile. The </p>
<p>fragile assessment is based on a combination of the quality and quantity of some </p>
<p>key equipment, the lack of priority to deploy equipment via AT [Air Transport] (PJHQ </p>
<p>assessment is that these items are low priority assets) to front line personnel and on </p>
<p>the estimated CBRN training state. Further equipment improvements will be limited </p>
<p>even as at 15th April.”</p>
<p><b>399. </b> On 4 March, Lord Bach and Dr Lewis Moonie, Parliamentary Under Secretary of </p>
<p>State for Defence and Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, received a briefing about “a number </p>
<p>of CBRN issues currently running” in the media.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> It stated that, “given the WMD context </p>
<p>of our case for confronting Saddam Hussein”, it was important to “first emphasise our </p>
<p>overall confidence in our NBC defence against any perceived threat”.</p>
<p><b>400. </b> If the UK’s assessment that CBRN defences were fragile became more widely </p>
<p>known, Ministers should adopt the line that they were not prepared to comment and that </p>
<p>“the protection of our people is our top priority”.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Internally, it was “imperative” that personnel had confidence in the CBRN protective </p>
<p>measures in place and an “open and honest dialogue” about any shortfalls should be </p>
<p>adopted, reassuring them about “the robustness of the overall system”. The areas where </p>
<p>progress had been made should be stressed.</p>
<p><b>402. </b> A separate annex provided lines to take against each of the NBC equipment items </p>
<p>that could raise concerns.</p>
<p><b>403. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 5 March, Rear Admiral Charles Style, Capability </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Adm Boyce stated that “the provision of correctly fitted respirators continued to </p>
<p>cause him considerable concern”.</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Maj Gen Fry reported that “there would be as few as 200 personnel who could not </p>
<p>satisfactorily be protected through existing arrangements”. Relocating those individuals </p>
<p>“could ameliorate the problem, but there was a presentational issue”.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> ACM Bagnall was directed to lead on the issues and to ensure that Mr Tony </p>
<p>Pawson, MOD Director General Corporate Communications, was engaged.</p>
<p><b>407. </b> RAdm Style wrote to ACM Bagnall later that day reporting:</p>
<p>“Sufficient equipment (the Respirator Test System and additional Respirators) and </p>
<p>necessary support are available … DCJO(Ops) has reported that he anticipates the </p>
<p>majority of testing to be complete by about 10 March. I shall seek confirmation of </p>
<p>their arrival and the expected testing timetable in time for Friday’s Ministerial brief.”</p>
<p>197</p>
<p><b>408. </b> ACM Bagnall wrote to the Directorate of Operational Capability (DOC), explaining </p>
<p>that he was progressing the respirator issues as “a matter of urgency” but there was </p>
<p>also a need to note the CBRN shortfalls in the wider Operation TELIC lesson process </p>
<p>to “be clear about why we have got into this situation”.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> He raised several questions to </p>
<p>illustrate his point including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“who is responsible for what aspects of the CBRN defence spectrum”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“who is responsible for ensuring that individual units, ships etc are in date and </p>
<p>properly equipped to operate in an NBC environment?”</p>
<p><b>409. </b> A paper was circulated to the Chiefs of Staff on 7 March about respirator fit testing </p>
<p>by the DJW, highlighting that it had raised issues “both in policy terms and dealing with </p>
<p>the impact on the individual as the results are exposed”.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>410. </b> The DJW recommended the Chiefs of Staff agree that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Individuals who did not attain an optimum fit after testing were provided with the </p>
<p>respirator that afforded “the best attainable level of protection, i.e. <i>‘best fit’</i>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Solutions for the residual 0.5 percent of individuals were being pursued: </p>
<p>“At this stage it is impossible to predict whether a solution will be found in the </p>
<p>time available.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Advice to the Combined Joint Task Force should be “that individuals who cannot </p>
<p>achieve an optimum fit should, where possible, only be deployed in areas where </p>
<p>the NBC risk is assessed as lower”.</p>

<p><b>411. </b> The UOR update for Lord Bach on 7 March highlighted:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>176 business cases for equipment capability UORs had been approved at a cost </p>
<p>of “some £488m”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The list of UORs for the post-conflict phase, Phase IV, continued to be “urgently </p>
<p>developed in parallel with the ongoing work” to develop more detailed planning </p>
<p>guidance and CONOPS. It was likely to focus on potential shortfalls relating </p>
<p>to force protection, infrastructure requirements and Intelligence, Surveillance, </p>
<p>Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Agreement was being sought from the Treasury to increase the total UOR </p>
<p>funding for Phase III by a further £60m. The funding for Phase IV had been </p>
<p>discussed at official level.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>412. </b> The update stated that the Integrated Project Team (IPT)</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> was “actively </p>
<p>assessing” another source to assist in the production of desert pattern NBC suits. </p>
<p>There was a requirement for 94,000 suits, but the contracted supplier could only produce </p>
<p>1,000 a week from the beginning of April (when the cloth to make the suits became </p>
<p>available), and 4,000 plus a week by mid-June.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> The DLO had issued sufficient ComboPens for the number of personnel deployed </p>
<p>but “the precise location in theatre of approximately 4,000 [wa]s unconfirmed”. Stocks </p>
<p>had been withdrawn from UK-based warships to mitigate the risk. There would be </p>
<p>sufficient water bottle tops to satisfy all demands by 10 March “and leave a reserve”.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Two UOR sets of sand filters for Lynx helicopters would be delivered by 21 March </p>
<p>with a further three refurbished sets. Further spares would be available from 31 March </p>
<p>and the supplier was producing an additional four sets “at risk” which would be available </p>
<p>from mid-April at a rate of one every two weeks. The MOD was not yet committed to a </p>
<p>contract for these sets but the requirement was likely to be a “high priority” for Phase IV.</p>
<p><b>415. </b>  At a Chiefs of Staff meeting on 10 March, Lt Gen Reith reported that:</p>
<p>“A full check of in-theatre NBC equipment and redistribution had been completed, </p>
<p>but respirator fitting had been slower than anticipated and was now expected to </p>
<p>complete on 18 Mar.”</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>416. </b> The record of Lord Bach’s meeting on 10 March stated:</p>
<p>“CBRN was in a better position than thought last week … by 17 March all personnel </p>
<p>would have their optimum fit of respirator. The testing was the most advanced in the </p>
<p>world – <i>all </i>personnel had successfully been through the CS gas chamber in their </p>
<p>respirator – we were now providing better still protection. The Commander in theatre </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>would have to decide how best to employ the 0.5% who did not have a perfect fit … </p>
<p>NBC clothing and canisters were also no longer problem areas, although desert </p>
<p>camouflage NBC suits were not yet available (but this was only a matter of their </p>
<p>colour, not the materials). COLPRO was not being raised in theatre as a significant </p>
<p>problem. The only outstanding issue on ComboPens was providing 600 to the </p>
<p>BBC …”</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>417. </b> An updated paper on NBC respirator policy was sent to the Chiefs of Staff on </p>
<p>11 March.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> It stated that alternative solutions to the fitting problem and the expected </p>
<p>0.5 percent of individuals who failed to achieve an optimum fit had been, and continued </p>
<p>to be, “vigorously pursued” with DSTL and industry. Three possible solutions had </p>
<p>emerged but it was impossible to predict whether or when these could be fielded, </p>
<p>“but certainly not before 17th March”.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> The DJW intended to provide “a field commander’s risk guide” to Lt Gen Reith </p>
<p>by 13 March on deploying individuals who could not achieve an optimum fit.</p>
<p><b>419. </b> The guide was circulated on 12 March.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>420. </b> In his report following a visit to see the forces preparing for operations in Kuwait, </p>
<p>General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff from February 2003 to August </p>
<p>2006, wrote on 10 March:</p>
<p>“The one area of the media feeding frenzy that has some justification lies in the </p>
<p>readiness of stocks for expeditionary operations. The introduction of resource </p>
<p>accounting has created an imperative to drive down stockholdings. As a result, in </p>
<p>the name of accounting orthodoxy we lack basic items such as desert clothing. I am </p>
<p>unsure whether the cost of storing such items would really have been more than the </p>
<p>inflated price we have no doubt paid by procurement under UOR action, but I am </p>
<p>certain of the negative impact on the moral component that failure to provide these </p>
<p>items has had.”</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Gen Jackson wrote that the root of the problem was “partly financial, but also </p>
<p>systemic” and there was no mechanism “within the Central Staff to safeguard the </p>
<p>operational logistic interest”. This had led to “a consistent lack of visibility” of the state </p>
<p>of UK holdings.</p>
<p><b>The situation in the week before the invasion</b></p>

<p>67</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting to discuss the military plan and timetable with Mr John </p>
<p>Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>Adm Boyce on 13 March.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> At the meeting, Adm Boyce “assured the Prime Minister that </p>
<p>the Armed Forces faced no serious equipment problems”.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>424. </b> On 14 March, RAdm Style reported to Lord Bach that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>178 equipment UOR business cases had now been approved at a cost of “some </p>
<p>£494m”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>9 UORs had been accepted into service over the previous week;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the manufacturer of desert NBC suits had revealed that production for the suits </p>
<p>could not start “as early as we had hoped and will not deliver the first items until </p>
<p>mid-April, a delay of 2 weeks”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the delivery of RVD tickets to theatre had been delayed, and was expected to be </p>
<p>complete by 19 March; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>while the DLO was confident that sufficient ComboPens had been delivered </p>
<p>to theatre, this could not be confirmed until the re-allocation exercise currently </p>
<p>under way had been completed.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>425. </b> On desert clothing, RAdm Style wrote:</p>
<p>“Sufficient desert clothing for the entire force was ordered in Dec 02 with an ISD of </p>
<p>31 March 03, with a small in-service reserve being available as a result of 3 Cdo Bde </p>
<p>and 16 Air Asslt Bde personnel retaining their clothing from Op JACANA. Although </p>
<p>pressed to advance their production and delivery schedules, few contractors have </p>
<p>been successful … Across the desert clothing range, at least 70% of all deliveries </p>
<p>are complete and in theatre, broadly equivalent to 2 sets per man, not counting </p>
<p>those personnel already equipped before deployment. Providing contractor delivery </p>
<p>profiles are met, we expect all outstanding demands to reach depots by 19 March </p>
<p>and to be with personnel by the end of the month. There are some exceptions; </p>
<p>desert helmet covers … and floppy hats … will not be delivered to depots until </p>
<p>nearer the end of the month.”</p>
<p><b>426. </b> Lt Gen Reith provided Adm Boyce with an update on the redistribution of NBC </p>
<p>equipment in theatre on the same day.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> He wrote that “sufficient” NBC Individual </p>
<p>Protective Equipment had been deployed, but “some stocks required redistribution to </p>
<p>ensure that all personnel had their initial allocation of 3 suits”. The redistribution of the </p>
<p>maritime component was 100 percent complete, the land contingent 97 percent, and the </p>
<p>air contingent 70 percent complete.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>427. </b> As part of the final battle preparations, the contingent was completing NBC </p>
<p>respirator testing but, because 1 (UK) Div needed to move forward to assembly areas, </p>
<p>its General Officer Commanding (GOC), Major General Robin Brims, had decided </p>
<p>to suspend that process. Lt Gen Reith “strongly” supported this decision from an </p>
<p>operational perspective and said he could restart the process of testing “if time allows”. </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“In terms of risk, his manoeuvre units would prove difficult targets, once battle </p>
<p>begins. However the more static units in the Divisional Support Group and Joint </p>
<p>Force Logistic Component would be at greater risk and thus I have directed that </p>
<p>testing should continue for them. The Maritime and Air contingents will also complete </p>
<p>the process.”</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Lt Gen Reith added: “Clearly Ministers will need to be informed.”</p>
<p><b>429. </b> In the record of Lord Bach’s meeting on 17 March, the key points included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>other than “the ongoing work on Phase IV”, there were “no major outstanding </p>
<p>UOR issues”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a flexible approach was needed on whether to continue with undelivered UORs </p>
<p>“as circumstances develop”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was “a 100 tonne backlog of equipment” waiting to be delivered to theatre;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there were now “no significant outstanding NBC issues except on delivery of </p>
<p>RVD tickets into theatre”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“notwithstanding helmet covers and floppy hats, which were taking slightly </p>
<p>longer than hoped for, 80% of clothing and boots ordered had been delivered </p>
<p>and prioritised in theatre. The overall figure of ‘desertised personnel’ was </p>
<p>higher, as it included those who had already been issued with desert kit for </p>
<p>Op JACANA.”</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>430. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 19 March, it was reported that only 3 percent of </p>
<p>the land component’s respirators had been checked, “the work having been overtaken </p>
<p>by other events in-theatre”.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>431. </b> On 21 March, AM Stirrup reported to Lord Bach that 183 business cases for UORs </p>
<p>had been approved at a cost of £497m.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Desertisation measures for the Challenger 2 vehicles had been delivered to theatre </p>
<p>in the past week (the fitting process of which was ongoing), along with Combat ID </p>
<p>equipment for all vehicles and ECBA, meaning that all unit demands for the latter had </p>
<p>been met.</p>

<p><b>433. </b> AM Stirrup also reported that “a problem with packaging” had led to a “small delay” </p>
<p>in the provision of new books of RVD tickets. The last 450 were received on 20 March </p>
<p>and should arrive in theatre that day.</p>
<p><b>Issues that emerged post-invasion</b></p>
<p><b>434.  After the invasion began, it became clear that some personnel had not been </b></p>
<p><b>equipped with desert clothing and body armour, there were difficulties with NBC </b></p>
<p><b>equipment, and there were shortages of ammunition.</b></p>
<p><b>435.  Lord Bach complained that he did not have visibility of equipment issues </b></p>
<p><b>at the front line.</b></p>
<p><b>436.  The reasons for the problems were not identified until 9 May.</b></p>
<p><b>437. </b> On 4 April, Lt Gen Reith wrote to ACM Bagnall:</p>
<p>“I can assure DCDS(EC) that the chain of command is working well and that an </p>
<p>embedded DPA LO [Liaison Officer] in theatre would have made no difference to </p>
<p>the current situation. My staff monitor equipment availability on a daily basis and the </p>
<p>DLO LO embedded in my Headquarters liaises regularly with relevant IPTs and other </p>
<p>agencies concerning the flow of UORs from industry into theatre.”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 8 April, Lord Bach’s Private Office wrote to Brigadier Derek Jeffrey, MOD </p>
<p>Director of Logistics Operations,</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> seeking clarity on the reliability of AFVs following </p>
<p>a negative press article.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>439. </b> The article had also suggested that there was a shortage of desert clothing and </p>
<p>boots which sat “a little oddly with the assurances that the Minister has repeatedly been </p>
<p>given about the availability of clothing and the arrangements for distributing it in theatre”.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Lord Bach’s Private Office wrote:</p>
<p>“The fact that there are continued rumblings about such basic requirements as this </p>
<p>begs a wider question: are there other items that have been delivered by industry to </p>
<p>the department but have yet to be distributed to all those that need them in theatre? </p>
<p>Lord Bach has been briefed over recent weeks on the acceptance into service of a </p>
<p>range of UORs. But he has very little visibility of the extent to which such items have </p>
<p>actually reached the front line.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>442. </b> Lord Bach was informed that there were “some unsatisfied demands due to sizing </p>
<p>issues but new stock from contractors should clear these in the very near future”. The </p>
<p>full requirement for boots was “the greatest concern and may not be fully met until the </p>
<p>end of April”.</p>
<p><b>443. </b> Brig Jeffrey added:</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding that sufficient clothing is now in theatre to meet demands … some </p>
<p>individuals have not received any clothing. There are a number of reasons for this </p>
<p>ranging from unit ordering errors to consignments being mis-located or being pushed </p>
<p>down the priority list in theatre. The DLO in the UK and the JFLogC [Joint Force </p>
<p>Logistic Component] in theatre are urgently carrying out an audit and progressively </p>
<p>the problem is being ameliorated.”</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Brig Jeffrey wrote that the DLO, DPA, PJHQ, and National Contingent </p>
<p>Headquarters (NCHQ) did “not have good visibility of the fast moving situation in the </p>
<p>Division with regards to UOR fitting”. That had meant “information on exactly what UORs </p>
<p>had been fully fitted was not always available, nor was it prudent to press the Divisional </p>
<p>staffs for this information at the height of battle”.</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Lord Bach’s Private Office replied on 11 April, acknowledging the points raised </p>
<p>and adding:</p>
<p>“But I think he [Lord Bach] will be interested to understand exactly which of the </p>
<p>UORs on which he has been briefed over recent months were not in the event fitted </p>
<p>despite having been available in theatre.”</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>446. </b>  The record of Lord Bach’s meeting on 14 April highlighted his concern that he did </p>
<p>not have “the visibility of equipment issues at the front line that he expected (and which </p>
<p>he was reassured would be provided through the chain of command)”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> His Private </p>
<p>Office wrote:</p>
<p>“An example of the ad hoc nature of this reporting is on Combat ID: the first time </p>
<p>Minister(DP) was made aware that CR2s [Challenger 2s] without it were being </p>
<p>used operationally was following the blue on blue incident on 25 March. The </p>
<p>presentational and moral repercussions had the CR2s in question not been fitted </p>
<p>with Combat ID cannot be overstated.”</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Lord Bach sought advice on:</p>
<p><b>“(i) the extent to which shortfalls of key items (such as desert clothing) remain </b></p>
<p><b>in theatre and what action is planned to ameliorate them; (ii) which UORs have </b></p>

<p><b>be improved so that in future Ministers receive timely and accurate advice on </b></p>
<p><b>these issues.”</b></p>
<p><b>448. </b>  On 17 April, Maj Gen Fry replied to Lord Bach’s request, on behalf of Lt Gen Reith, </p>
<p>reporting that “other than the continuing saga of desert combat clothing, there [we]re no </p>
<p>other key equipment shortfalls” in theatre.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> As of 13 April, the “shortfall amounted to </p>
<p>18,300 suits and 12,500 boots”. Additional clothing would arrive in theatre by 18 April, </p>
<p>meeting the requirement for boots, and reducing the shortfall of suits to 3,275.</p>
<p><b>449. </b> Maj Gen Fry confirmed that all UORs delivered to theatre were “forwarded to the </p>
<p>front line”. On Combat ID, he wrote that whilst its delivery into theatre was aligned with </p>
<p>Challenger 2, “not all of it could be fitted within the compressed timeline before D-Day” </p>
<p>because eight Challenger sets in a container “were temporarily misplaced within Kuwait”. </p>
<p>Maj Gen Fry stated that the decision to proceed without the full range of Combat ID </p>
<p>fitted in some Challengers was the GOC’s and implied that was necessary because of </p>
<p>US timings.</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Addressing the issues raised about the flow of information, Maj Gen Fry wrote that </p>
<p>the weekly updates on UORs were “a significant staff burden” and that producing them </p>
<p>“at any greater frequency would prove counter productive”.</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Commenting on the note to Lord Bach, his Private Office wrote:</p>
<p>“This is, frankly, pretty dismissive of your concerns … [It] offers no explanation </p>
<p>of why the ‘desert clothing saga’ arose and no guidance on how and when the </p>
<p>shortfalls will be addressed … [It] contradicts the earlier advice from the DLO that </p>
<p>some UORs had been delivered to theatre but not on to the front line.”</p>

<p><b>452. </b> At his meeting on 28 April, Lord Bach noted that no more UORs for the invasion </p>
<p>phase had been raised in the last fortnight, no more were expected, and all were </p>
<p>expected to be delivered by 1 May.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> He therefore agreed that the monitoring of Phase </p>
<p>III UOR implementation should cease but perceived a continuing requirement, “for the </p>
<p>time being at least”, to keep track of the Phase IV UORs.</p>
<p><b>453. </b> The “bulk of the discussion” focused on “the continuing difficulty experienced by </p>
<p>the DLO, DPA and ECC in securing reliable information from theatre about equipment </p>
<p>matters” and how best to present publicly what was understood to be “the generally </p>
<p>positive news on this front”. Lord Bach remained concerned about the flow of information </p>
<p>on equipment matters.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>454. </b> The record of the meeting stated that Lord Bach believed work should be set </p>
<p>in hand urgently “to develop a better handle on the facts of equipment performance </p>
<p>(including the extent to which UORs reached users). Identifying and being able to </p>
<p>account for potential vulnerabilities would be “vital” to address Parliamentary Questions </p>
<p>(PQs) and reports of shortages in desert clothing, boots, ECBA and Combat ID </p>
<p>equipment:</p>
<p>“Ministers will need chapter and verse on these issues, and on any others yet to </p>
<p>come to their attention; and they will need it whatever the conclusions of the lessons </p>
<p>learned process.”</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Specific questions on desert clothing, boots and UOR delivery were set out in </p>
<p>an Annex, including why the desert clothing “saga” came to light “so late in the day”, </p>
<p>given the attention it received in the run up to operations, and asking for clarification on </p>
<p>whether all UORs delivered to theatre were fitted. Lord Bach also sought confirmation </p>
<p>that all UORs had been received by the end user for whom they were intended. If not, he </p>
<p>requested a list of those that had not been received, with an explanation in each case.</p>
<p><b>456. </b> The record stated:</p>
<p>“As I have tried to articulate previously, Minister(DP) is not seeking here to second </p>
<p>guess decisions made by commanders in theatre, which he accepts will have </p>
<p>been made for very good operational reasons. He simply wants to understand, </p>
<p>and be able to defend as required, the facts and the arguments pertaining to </p>
<p>these judgements.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Lord Bach also wanted to proactively “get the message across” publicly that, in </p>
<p>general, equipment performance had “been impressive”. He accepted that the MOD </p>
<p>should be prepared to acknowledge that “not everything went exactly according to plan </p>
<p>and that lessons are, of course, being learnt” but that this should not deter the MOD </p>
<p>from highlighting positive news.</p>
<p><b>458. </b>  Mr Paul Flaherty, Head of Civilian Secretariat, PJHQ, replied on 9 May that </p>
<p>Op TELIC had been “a great success both in terms of performance of equipment and </p>
<p>the successful delivery of an enormous amount of equipment in a very short space of </p>
<p>time”.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“… it is also becoming clear that there were problems in theatre, of which we were </p>
<p>not aware, in relation to the fitting of UORs and the delivery of kit. At this stage </p>
<p>contributory factors appear to include the sheer speed and scale of the deployment, </p>
<p>the large number of UOR equipment, the significant advance of G day,</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> and the </p>
<p>absence of an in theatre asset-tracking system with the consequent mismatch of </p>
<p>people and equipment.”</p>

<p><b>459. </b> On the delivery of UORs to theatre Mr Flaherty wrote:</p>
<p>“The processes currently in place for tracking UORs only tracks them until they </p>
<p>arrive to the original consignee in Theatre. There is therefore no means of tracking </p>
<p>whether UORs reached the end user for whom they were intended. Work has </p>
<p>been set in train to establish this and separate advice is being submitted by CJO </p>
<p>to VCDS.”</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Flaherty also covered the issues of desert clothing and Combat ID in separate </p>
<p>annexes which are detailed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>461. </b> On Lord Bach’s copy of the minute, his Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“This is – at last – a serious attempt to respond to your concerns about equipment </p>
<p>delivery/supply … and acknowledges the importance of providing Ministers with </p>
<p>proper advice. The story it tells … about the flow of information from theatre which </p>
<p>has obviously been lamentable – is pretty depressing.”</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Flaherty’s note was discussed at Lord Bach’s meeting on 12 May.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> Lord Bach </p>
<p>believed the note went “a long way to addressing some of the issues he raised about </p>
<p>the availability of equipment at the front line”. He accepted “the proffered explanation for </p>
<p>this” but was “disappointed that a variety of factors” appeared to have undermined the </p>
<p>efforts to equip troops as well as possible.</p>
<p><b>463. </b> The note of the meeting recorded that Lord Bach:</p>
<p>“… regrets that – aside from the very practical consequence for our people, a </p>
<p>number of whom might be expected to complain about having been sent into battle </p>
<p>without relatively basic articles of key equipment – an unfortunate side effect has </p>
<p>been that the advice provided to Ministers, albeit on the basis of advice from theatre, </p>
<p>has turned out in retrospect to be less than wholly accurate. He agrees that these </p>
<p>issues, particularly the lack of an effective asset tracking system, will need carefully </p>
<p>to be examined during the lessons learned process.”</p>
<p><b>464. </b> In addition to ECBA, desert clothing and Combat ID kit, Lord Bach had heard at </p>
<p>a meeting that morning that concerns had been expressed by commanders in theatre </p>
<p>about shortages of morphine and NBC equipment. He sought advice on those points by </p>
<p>the end of the week.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>466. </b> Lt Gen Reith provided specific briefing that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Combat availability of both Challenger 2 and AS90 tanks was “very high” and </p>
<p>the desertisation and protection measures for Challenger 2 were fitted before </p>
<p>war-fighting. The AS90 desertisation measure was not completed until 4 May </p>
<p>“but was not required for war-fighting, although it would have been if hostilities </p>
<p>had continued as had been expected”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The supply of Combat ID was “over-taut” but 1 (UK) Div reported that “there was </p>
<p>just enough for equipment in the direct fire zone”. The late arrival was due to </p>
<p>distribution problems but, where it was supplied, it had been effective.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been a shortfall of ComboPens that was addressed by the issue of </p>
<p>“out-of-date pens” as a “last resort”. The shortfall was “traceable to enduring </p>
<p>manufacturing difficulties, acknowledged in early 02”. Alternative provision was </p>
<p>being considered but was proving problematic.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The respirator testing kits had arrived in theatre between 24 February and </p>
<p>7 March “but were subject to a delay in distribution because of the large </p>
<p>amounts of higher priority stores, such as CR2 [Challenger 2] and Combat ID </p>
<p>UOR equipment”.</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Lt Gen Reith wrote:</p>
<p>“I draw two valuable lessons from this work:</p>
<p>“(a) In future, we should try to be less reliant on UORs for operations; fitting these in </p>
<p>the time available and in austere conditions further stretches an already over-loaded </p>
<p>logistic organisation. Thus, there is a strong case for better resourcing and I hope </p>
<p>this point now will be accepted where it perhaps has not been in the past.</p>
<p>“(b) ‘Just enough just in time’ is probably a flawed policy for military operations. </p>
<p>SDR directed that the DLO should only hold that which could not be procured </p>
<p>within readiness and preparation time. However, the stock levels held speak </p>
<p>for themselves.”</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Lt Gen Reith added that both points had been “exacerbated by the understandable </p>
<p>reluctance of Ministers to go early to industry … before formal committal to the </p>
<p>operation”. He also wrote that the military’s commitment was, “as often happens, </p>
<p>at a scale beyond that envisaged in the DPAs and thus not fully resourced”.</p>
<p><b>469. </b> Lt Gen Reith reiterated those points on 16 May when he produced a “Top 10 </p>
<p>Lessons Identified” document for the DOC.</p>

<p>75</p>
<p><b>470. </b> On deployment processes, Lt Gen Reith wrote that it “went well” but “we should </p>
<p>caution against too much reliance on chartered air and shipping assets”. He stated:</p>
<p>“There were considerable challenges in tracking equipment, UORs, and stores </p>
<p>particularly in theatre, because of inadequacies in the management of the deployed </p>
<p>inventory systems, especially an ‘end to end’ tracking capability. This is an old </p>
<p>chestnut which requires addressing urgently.”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Lt Gen Reith continued:</p>
<p>“Stockholdings were inadequate for this scale of operation. Understandably </p>
<p>Ministers will be reluctant to commit to operations until very late in the day, which </p>
<p>means we cannot approach industry early and we will also often be required to do </p>
<p>more than envisaged in defence planning assumptions. Thus, the policy of ‘just </p>
<p>enough just in time’ needs urgent review.”</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Brigadier Shaun Cowlam, Commander of 102 Logistics Brigade, wrote in his post </p>
<p>operational report in May 2003 that:</p>
<p>“Despite the success in getting the force into theatre in half the time taken for </p>
<p>Op GRANBY, it was clear that poor personnel and equipment readiness across the </p>
<p>force added significantly to both logistic and, subsequently, operational risk. Many </p>
<p>personnel (particularly augmentees and Reservists) were poorly equipped and </p>
<p>briefed for deployment, some arriving in theatre with no combat clothing, respirators, </p>
<p>weapons or sleeping systems, and others not knowing which unit or location they </p>
<p>were destined for … The lesson is that units should be equipped on deployment </p>
<p>to the necessary scales. The argument that in many cases, broken readiness and </p>
<p>preparation times explain the shortcomings, ignores the reality that readiness </p>
<p>is simply an assumption. Op TELIC has shown that our current assumptions </p>
<p>do not reflect operational reality and we are taking unseen risks that we are </p>
<p>not managing.”</p>
<p>229</p>
<p><b>473. </b> On 27 May, ACM Bagnall advised Lord Bach that he was “keen to establish the </p>
<p>facts (rather than early anecdotal views) relating to UORs and equipment issues”.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“Work on the lessons is well underway and I have taken steps to ensure that specific </p>
<p>issues relating to UORs and equipment matters are properly captured. For now it </p>
<p>is clear that the tight timeline from the decision to activate the UOR process; the </p>
<p>need to properly balance the logistic push from the UK versus the Commander’s pull </p>
<p>requirement in theatre; asset tracking … will all feature prominently …”</p>

<p><b>483. </b> Clothing issued to 3 Commando and 16 Air Assault Brigades was deteriorating, so </p>
<p>they would require an additional 10,000 replacement suits. Those would be dispatched </p>
<p>to theatre at the beginning of May. Other formations would also require maintenance </p>
<p>stocks.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Adm Boyce was advised that 12 months was “a realistic minimum lead time to </p>
<p>allow for normal contracting processes” for desert clothing. Advice had been provided in </p>
<p>September 2002 that the decision point for ordering clothing was 1 October with the “risk </p>
<p>of shortages increasing thereafter”. That risk had been “deemed to be acceptable” and </p>
<p>permission was not given to approach industry until 4 December.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> In Mr Flaherty’s note to Lord Bach on 9 May addressing equipment performance, </p>
<p>he summarised the position on desert clothing and boots as:</p>
<p>“The shortage of desert clothing was caused primarily by the fact that the stocks </p>
<p>held were insufficient for the speed and size of this deployment. The inability to </p>
<p>equip even all fighting formations prior to the start of combat operations was caused </p>
<p>by in theatre supply priorities. The weakness of the asset tracking system meant </p>
<p>there was limited visibility outside theatre of these problems. During decisive combat </p>
<p>operation the shortage of desert combats was not flagged up since it was not seen </p>
<p>to have a serious operational impact. Sufficient desert combats have now been </p>
<p>dispatched to theatre to meet previously declared shortfalls.”</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Mr Flaherty added that after combat operations ended, the shortage of clothing </p>
<p>was having “a negative impact on morale” and had therefore been flagged as a concern. </p>
<p>He wrote that “excess stocks” were “now held centrally in theatre” and units could call on </p>
<p>these stocks “as required to top up holdings”.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Following the invasion, Brig Cowlam wrote:</p>

<p>“The issue of the availability of desert clothing and boots during Operation TELIC </p>
<p>has been both a confusing and worrying story … MOD clearly underestimated the </p>
<p>impact on morale of failing to provide service personnel with the clothing and boots </p>
<p>which they required and expected. We find it unacceptable that some two weeks </p>

<p>“In the case of this operation, the numbers deployed were significantly higher, and </p>
<p>whilst most materials were sent out in time, difficulties with in-theatre tracking meant </p>

<p><b>493. </b> The Inquiry asked the MOD for a statement on planned stockholdings of desert </p>

<p>confirmed the planned stockholdings of desert clothing was 9,000 sets.</p>

<p> “Some stock” </p>
<p>was being consumed by operations in Afghanistan over that period “but levels were </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>495. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“Desert combats were part of the UORs and I know some of the soldiers resented </p>
<p>having to wear their green combats rather than their desert combats.”</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Mr Hoon later added: “Some soldiers, I’m sure, did not have the right boots.”</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>497. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry that extra time “would certainly have made a </p>
<p>difference” to the provision of desert clothing and boots.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> Although pressure on the </p>
<p>manufacturers had delivered “just about sufficient sets”, that was not enough in an </p>
<p>operational environment where “a critical issue” was to get it to the right place on time.</p>
<p><b>498. </b> Major General Graham Binns, Commander of 7 Armoured Brigade during the </p>
<p>invasion, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“There were soldiers who didn’t have desert combats, you know, we were asking </p>
<p>them to go to war incorrectly dressed.”</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Mr Ingram told the Inquiry that part of the reason behind Ministerial visits to Iraq </p>
<p>during the operations was to investigate what he called the “urban myths” that were </p>
<p>being reported in the media about equipment shortages.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> He gave an example:</p>
<p>“ … I had one of my own constituents, a mother, on behalf of her son, complaining </p>
<p>about the fact that her boy didn’t have size 11 boots, and this went on for weeks and </p>
<p>weeks, until the point I said, ‘Well, is he running around barefoot?’ to her. Of course </p>
<p>he wasn’t. He had bought his own boots, but she was annoyed that he – she was </p>
<p>saying that he had not been issued with the size 11, and he had been.”</p>
<p><b>Enhanced Combat Body Armour</b></p>
<p><b>500.  Enough body armour was procured to equip only British fighting formations; </b></p>
<p><b>that was insufficient to equip all British troops deployed.</b></p>
<p><b>501.  Poor asset tracking meant that even fighting formations were not fully </b></p>
<p><b>equipped, resulting in an urgent redistribution programme to the front line.</b></p>

<p><b>503. </b> On 2 April, Lt Gen Fry advised Adm Boyce on the availability of ECBA:</p>
<p>“Despite the allocation of an increased baggage allowance, some units that had </p>
<p>already been issued ECBA in the UK decided to load the plates in unit freight for </p>
<p>surface shipping. Due to poor marking some of these containers were slow in </p>
<p>being delivered to units, resulting [in] personnel crossing the LD [line of departure] </p>
<p>without plates.”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Lt Gen Fry wrote that that was “mitigated by an urgent redistribution programme </p>
<p>that ensured that forward troops were equipped at the expense of those in the rear”. </p>
<p>Following that programme, and subsequent deliveries, the NCHQ estimated that </p>
<p>60 percent of 1(UK) Div had been fitted with ECBA.</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Following his requests, Mr Flaherty provided Lord Bach with further advice on the </p>
<p>supply and distribution of ECBA on 16 May.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> He wrote that “the majority of troops in </p>
<p>the fighting formations had full combat body armour at the start of combat operations” </p>
<p>but there were “some shortages of ceramic plates which meant that some elements of </p>
<p>7 Armoured Brigade and up to 50% of the Joint Force Logistics did not have ceramic </p>
<p>plates at the outset of hostilities”.</p>
<p><b>506. </b> Mr Flaherty wrote that shortages were “exacerbated” by the fact that only </p>
<p>ECBA sufficient to “equip the wartime establishment of units” had been procured. He </p>
<p>estimated that “approximately 3,500 personnel, the majority of which were not in fighting </p>
<p>formations, were affected by the shortage. About 500 sets of ECBA were withdrawn from </p>
<p>rear units and redistributed to the front line”.</p>
<p><b>507. </b>  The DOC’s 17 October 2003 report stated that, before the invasion, the DLO </p>
<p>“were not mandated to hold stocks of ECBA sufficient to meet the requirements of this </p>
<p>operation”.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> It stated that 36,000 sets of ECBA were deployed to theatre which were </p>
<p>“sufficient” to meet the total requirement but “late delivery, coupled with difficulties in </p>
<p>consignment tracking and poor unit level control, led to localised shortfalls”.</p>
<p><b>508. </b> The Inquiry asked the MOD for a statement on planned stockholdings for ECBA </p>
<p>and the actual levels of stockholdings between July and September 2002. The MOD </p>
<p>advised that, on 1 July 2002, it had 25,754 plates in stock and by 30 September this </p>
<p>figure was 30,482.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p><b>509. </b> The MOD’s <i>Lessons for the Future</i> report in December 2003 stated:</p>

<p><b>510. </b> The NAO’s December 2003 report on Op TELIC stated:</p>
<p>“ … 21,759 [desert pattern] covers and 32,581 pairs of plates were issued into </p>
<p>the supply chain by 24 March 2003. However, the Department’s Defence Clothing </p>
<p>Integrated Project Team estimated that approximately 200,000 sets had been issued </p>
<p>since the Kosovo campaign in 1999, greatly exceeding the theoretical requirement, </p>
<p>but these seem to have disappeared. The Team questioned whether items should, </p>
<p>therefore, be issued as part of an individual’s personal entitlement for which they </p>
<p>would be held accountable.”</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>511. </b> The NAO also reported that “insufficient numbers [of body armour] were distributed </p>
<p>in theatre, largely as a result of difficulties with asset tracking and distribution.”</p>
<p><b>512. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee concluded that:</p>
<p>“Body armour is another example of where MOD’s in-theatre distribution and </p>
<p>tracking led to shortages in critical equipment … MOD should identify and implement </p>

<p><b>515. </b> On 18 December 2006, Mr Andrew Walker, Oxfordshire Assistant Deputy Coroner, </p>
<p>delivered a narrative verdict:</p>
<p>“Sgt Roberts’ death was as a result of delay and serious failures in the acquisition </p>
<p>and support chain that resulted in a significant shortage within his fighting unit of </p>
<p>enhanced combat body armour, none being available for him to wear.”</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>516. </b> Lieutenant General Robin Brims told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was fully aware that there was a problem with the body armour and I ordered a </p>
<p>redistribution of body armour to those people most in need, and similarly some other </p>
<p>forms of equipment.”</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>517. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… just before the start of operation, the clear message that we were receiving in </p>
<p>the Ministry of Defence was that all unit demands for enhanced combat body armour </p>
<p>had been met, but quite clearly not everybody who needed it in theatre got it when </p>
<p>they needed it, and had it been – had that been two months earlier, then those sorts </p>
<p>of issues I think could have been untangled.”</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>518. </b> ACM Stirrup added:</p>
<p>“I think the area where we could have done better is in terms of enhanced combat </p>
<p>body armour. We didn’t have enough of that in theatre at the time, and I think, in part </p>
<p>… the issue was it was all being done so rapidly at the last minute no one was quite </p>
<p>sure who had what.”</p>
<p><b>519. </b> The process behind the prioritisation of the redistribution of body armour was </p>
<p>described by Maj Gen Binns:</p>
<p>“We had insufficient body armour to equip all those who were likely to be coming into </p>
<p>immediate contact with the fighting companies and squadrons and I took a decision </p>
<p>to reallocate based on mitigating the risks to those who were most vulnerable to the </p>
<p>dismounted troops and those who sat behind 70 tonnes of armour I was prepared to </p>
<p>take a risk with …”</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>520. </b> ACM Bagnall told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was not aware that, in some cases, all personnel did not have access to Enhanced </p>
<p>Body Armour at the start of operations. That said, I heard anecdotal evidence of </p>

<p> The MOD added:</p>
<p>“Other shortfalls were due to poor stock maintenance – for example the inspection </p>
<p>regime for Residual Vapour Detectors had not been followed, leading to uncertainty </p>
<p>over serviceability. Nevertheless, through a combination of purchasing spare parts </p>
<p>and rigorous re-testing of the equipment, the operational requirement was met.”</p>

<p><b>525. </b> On 6 June, Mr Flaherty provided advice on the supply and delivery of NBC </p>
<p>equipment to Lord Bach.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“Although the UOR system did produce some NBC equipment, the issues in this </p>
<p>case relate more to the proper maintenance of existing stocks and the ability of our </p>
<p>systems to cope with the delivery of very large surge requirements to personnel who </p>
<p>are unfamiliar with the equipment in question, and may not easily be able to track its </p>
<p>onward movement.</p>
<p>“Although commanders will – rightly – place their priority on the out-load and delivery </p>
<p>of battle-winning capability, and although the perceived NBC threat diminished with </p>
<p>the collapse of the regime, there were occasions when our personnel perceived they </p>
<p>were at high risk, due to the lack of NBC equipment.”</p>
<p><b>526. </b> On NBC suits, Mr Flaherty wrote that:</p>
<p>“There were initially insufficient NBC suits in theatre to supply all personnel with </p>
<p>three each at the outset of hostilities. In order to ensure all personnel had two suits </p>
<p>each … suits were re-distributed … An additional 96,000 suits arrived from the UK </p>
<p>on 19 March meaning there were sufficient suits in theatre to supply all personnel </p>
<p>with four each. However due to a mismatch between the sizes of the suits and </p>
<p>individuals a small number of troops crossed the Line of Departure with only one </p>
<p>properly fitting suit …</p>
<p>“Commanders assessed that the risk posed to the Force by these shortages was low </p>
<p>… The effect on morale was judged to be more serious than the practical impact.”</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Mr Flaherty wrote that in order to alleviate shortages in NBC detectors, equipment </p>
<p>held by 3 Commando Brigade and 16 Air Assault Brigade was redistributed, leaving </p>
<p>them with “less than 50% of the required capability”. All available NBC detection </p>
<p>equipment, ancillaries and consumables were then flown out, “giving theatre a 50% </p>
<p>capability by 13 March”.</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Mr Flaherty stated: “The shortage of NBC detection was assessed to pose a high </p>
<p>risk to UK troops.” This was “not fundamentally a ‘UOR’ issue but one of maintenance </p>
<p>and supply of in-service equipment” exacerbated by the delayed in-service introduction </p>
<p>of a new form of equipment.</p>
<p><b>529. </b> There had also been a shortage of batteries for the NBC detection sets and for </p>
<p>their remote alarms, “aggravated by the fact that some NAIAD arrived from stores </p>
<p>without batteries or batteries for the remote”. Commanders had assessed that this </p>
<p>shortage “posed a high risk to UK Forces”; 1 (UK) Div had been ordered to turn off NBC </p>
<p>detectors while in dispersal areas to preserve the batteries and to “only turn them back </p>
<p>on if there were signs of an attack”.</p>

<p>268</p>
<p><b>531. </b> On the front page of Mr Flaherty’s advice, Lord Bach’s Private Office wrote:</p>
<p>“This was not flagged up through the chain of command, despite (numerous) </p>
<p>assurances that it would be, and it runs counter to the public lines Ministers were </p>
<p>given. These were effectively – although there are some shortfalls (because NAIAD </p>
<p>is no longer manufactured) – we have confidence in our NBC defence against any </p>
<p>threat posed by Saddam. In fact, the point contradicts this and has, rather fittingly </p>
<p>in my view, been described as ‘playing Russian roulette with people’s lives.’”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> On 3 July, Lord Bach’s Private Office replied to Mr Flaherty expressing alarm that </p>
<p>there were occasions when personnel were assessed to be at high risk due to a lack of </p>
<p>NBC equipment:</p>
<p>“[Lord Bach] recalls the assessments provided before the campaign that our NBC </p>
<p>defence was ‘fragile’ but that nevertheless there was complete confidence in the </p>
<p>NBC posture of UK forces – as reflected in Lord Bach’s weekly UOR meetings and </p>
<p>the Department’s public line. In particular, whilst Lord Bach fully appreciates the right </p>
<p>of Commanders to make decisions on the ground, he is concerned that Ministers </p>
<p>were not made aware of this fact until it came to light through media questions.”</p>

<p>Strategic Audit and Guidance for the 2004 Equipment Programme’ had suggested that </p>

<p><b>537. </b>  Mr Ingram’s Private Office replied on 26 March that Mr Ingram’s view was:</p>
<p>“… given the prominence of the NBC threat in the run up to Op TELIC and the </p>

<p>subsequently, his view is that a worrying picture is beginning to emerge. His </p>

<p>“If the brigade had been subjected to a CBW attack we would at best have been </p>
<p>‘fighting to survive’ rather than ‘surviving to fight’ … Inadequate stocks of the NBC </p>
<p>consumables caused concern and uncertainty.”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>544. </b> In his post-operation tour report, Brig Cowlam wrote that the lack of NBC kit was “a </p>
<p>major concern” and “unacceptable”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>545. </b> The NAO’s December 2003 Op TELIC report stated:</p>
<p>“Although overall protection against chemical agents was good, there was a </p>
<p>‘significant shortfall’ (some 40 percent) of Nerve Agent Immobilised Alarm and </p>
<p>Detector units … and a severe shortfall in Residual Vapour Detector kit availability … </p>
<p>While these shortfalls could be partially mitigated … it made detection and therefore </p>
<p>response to an attack inefficient.</p>
<p>“There were difficulties in providing Nuclear, Biological and Chemical protective suits </p>
<p>for certain sizes in sufficient numbers. In addition … some respirators did not fit as </p>
<p>well as had been presumed …</p>
<p>“A number of units reported shortages of necessary consumable items required </p>
<p>for the effective operation of chemical agent detector systems … The lack of these </p>
<p>items prevented units from turning on these systems in order to preserve some </p>
<p>reserve capability, amounting in some cases to between six and 24 hours worth of </p>
<p>operation.</p>
<p>“ … On Operation TELIC, the war reserve of filters was issued from central holdings </p>
<p>and dispatched to theatre. However, we found that these vehicle filters (for both </p>
<p>Challenger 2 and other armoured vehicles) had not been delivered to the frontline </p>

<p><b>546. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee concluded:</p>
<p>“Given the potential threat posed by Iraqi armed forces, sufficient chemical warfare </p>
<p>detection and protection were particularly important for this operation. However, </p>
<p>there were serious shortcomings in the supply and distribution system and the </p>
<p>required levels of detection and protection were not always available to everyone. </p>
<p>Indeed, while MOD ideally would have liked each serviceman and woman to have </p>
<p>had four suits available, only one suit per person was available, which MOD judged </p>
<p>to be sufficient for this operation. Furthermore it is essential that personnel have </p>
<p>confidence in the effectiveness of the equipment with which they are provided. It </p>
<p>was fortuitous that service personnel did not suffer as a consequence, but had the </p>
<p>Iraqis used chemical weapons systematically, as employed in the Iran-Iraq war, the </p>
<p>operational consequences would have been severe. The lack of armoured vehicle </p>
<p>filters seems to us to be a matter of the utmost seriousness. The lessons identified </p>
<p>need to be implemented as a matter of urgency to ensure that servicemen and </p>
<p>women serving on operations have complete and justified confidence that chemical </p>
<p>warfare attacks will be detected in time, that their individual protection equipment will </p>
<p>save their lives and that operational success will not be imperilled. This is particularly </p>
<p>important given that UK service personnel are more likely to be operating in such </p>
<p>environments in the future.”</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>547. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry: “I have to say I have not come across anything specific </p>
<p>to suggest that NBC protection was not available to every soldier who needed it.”</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>548. </b> When questioned about concerns that out-of-date kit had been issued, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“… I don’t recall any suggestion that any of this kit was ineffective … I don’t know </p>
<p>whether there was a sell-by date on the kit. There may well have been but as far as </p>
<p>I am aware, whenever this was tested, this equipment was fit for its purpose.”</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Lord Bach told the Inquiry in his witness statement that he was not aware of the </p>
<p>level of respirator testing that was reported to the Chiefs of Staff on 19 March 2003:</p>
<p> “… we did not receive information that the Chiefs of Staff Committee apparently </p>
<p>received on the eve of the invasion.”</p>

<p>ACM Bagnall told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I do not recognise the figure of 3 percent in relation to respirator fitting. I understood </p>
<p>that all ground force personnel had been tested through what was described as the </p>

<p>0.5 percent of personnel had not been tested.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The one area of equipment which did give me concern was our ability to cope with </p>
<p>any biological or chemical threat and therefore the right kit for that, which is basically </p>
<p>the suit you wear, the protection equipment you wear, and also a gas mask. That’s </p>
<p>something which did trouble me. That was our sort of worst case scenario – once we </p>
<p>went over the line, of having chemical or biological weapons thrown at us; and a lot </p>
<p>of effort was put into making sure those who would be going in the leading echelons </p>
<p>did have the right IPE [Individual Protective Equipment], the right sort of protective </p>
<p>equipment, and everybody had their gas mask checked which at the time I went out </p>
<p>was a shortfall.”</p>
<p><b>553. </b> Lord Boyce added that, by 19-20 March, he thought “we had a satisfactory level of </p>
<p>kitting out of gas masks and IPE”.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>554. </b> The Inquiry asked the MOD for further information regarding the level of stock </p>
<p>holdings and provision of NBC clothing and equipment before the invasion and the lead </p>
<p>times for providing additional provisions. The MOD responded:</p>
<p>“Sufficient stock of NBC suits and respirators were sent to theatre before the start of </p>
<p>combat operations to provide two per person. Further deliveries to theatre increased </p>
<p>this to four per person from 19 March 2003.”</p>

<p><b>556.  The problem was exacerbated by poor asset tracking.</b></p>
<p><b>557. </b> In analysing the options for a possible UK contribution, Mr Hoon had been advised </p>

<p>“Small arms ammunition was in such short supply that 1 DWR [Duke of Wellington’s </p>
<p>Regiment] had only 10% of its requirement until after G-day, and some Royal </p>
<p>Engineers started the operation with only 10 rounds per man.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>559. </b> In his post-operation report Brig Binns wrote: “Ammunition was a constant cause </p>
<p>of concern throughout the deployment.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>560. </b> The NAO’s December 2003 Op TELIC report stated:</p>
<p>“Lack of consignment tracking led to inefficiencies … There were difficulties in </p>
<p>scheduling the delivery of some supplies due to mis-prioritisation of loading of </p>
<p>stocks for transport. For example, the majority of the force’s flat racks (required </p>
<p>for the movement of ammunition by specialist vehicles) were on the penultimate </p>
<p>deployment ship, arriving in Kuwait in 17 March. This significantly limited the ability </p>
<p>of logistic units to move ammunition to the frontline and exacerbated a perception </p>
<p>among troops that there were ammunition shortages.”</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Brig Cowlam told the House of Commons Defence Select Committee that all units </p>
<p>had been issued ammunition</p>
<p> </p>

<p>very limited.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>562. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee concluded:</p>
<p>“Our examination suggests that there were problems with the supply of ammunition </p>
<p>when the fighting echelon began operations. MOD accepts that in the very early </p>
<p>stages there were some problems and not all service personnel had the right </p>
<p>amount. We expect MOD to establish the scale of the problem, to investigate any </p>
<p>specific cases identified, in particular the tragic incident involving the six Royal </p>

<p>92</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry that “there were some serious shortfalls” which were </p>
<p>eventually “helped by a redistribution of ammunition across the division”.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> He described </p>
<p>a particular problem with ammunition for Warrior vehicles:</p>
<p>“We couldn’t find the operational ammunition for the Warrior. We knew that it had </p>
<p>left Bicester and there was evidence that it had arrived in Kuwait, and there was a </p>
<p>risk, a real risk, that ammunition was in such short supply that we may have fired </p>
<p>it in training. And because the ammunition had just been taken to the range, they </p>
<p>naturally assumed that that was the ammunition, and I thought we had fired it. So </p>
<p>there was a risk over ammunition.”</p>
<p><b>565. </b> With only four months’ preparation, equipment had, in a number of cases, arrived </p>
<p>a month or two after the operation started.</p>
<p><b>Combat ID</b></p>
<p><b>566.  Despite the public assurances given prior to the invasion that previously </b></p>
<p><b>identified problems had been resolved, Combat ID equipment was not fitted to all </b></p>
<p><b>vehicles before the start of operations.</b></p>
<p><b>567. </b> Nine blue-on-blue incidents, four of which resulted in the death</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> or injury of UK </p>
<p>personnel, were reported during the combat phase of Op TELIC.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>568. </b> At Lord Bach’s UOR meeting on 1 April 2003, it was reported that “the story overall </p>
<p>on equipment was positive” but despite having the same equipment as the US, “we were </p>
<p>going to ‘come in for a schlocking’ on Combat ID”.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> The record of the meeting did not </p>
<p>explain why.</p>
<p><b>569. </b> A note from Maj Gen Fry to Adm Boyce on 2 April stated that only 1,861 sets of </p>

<p>298</p>
<p> </p>
<p>By the date of the invasion, all vehicles had been fitted for the equipment, but “due to the </p>
<p>mal-location of two containers two Squadrons were not fitted with the equipment”. The </p>
<p>containers “were subsequently found and sent forward so that units could be fitted with </p>
<p>Combat ID when an appropriate moment occurred”.</p>
<p><b>570. </b> The minute from Mr Flaherty on 9 May detailed the extent of the problem:</p>
<p>“Three ISO containers of Combat ID were temporarily misplaced in theatre meaning </p>
<p>32 Challenger 2s were not fitted with combat identification prior to the start of </p>

<p>299</p>
<p><b>571. </b> The MOD’s <i>First Reflections</i> report in July 2003 stated:</p>
<p>“By the start of operations, MOD had deployed 1,861 vehicle-mounted and 5,000 </p>
<p>dismounted Combat ID sets. This was sufficient to meet the full requirement, </p>
<p>although the scale of equipment modifications required in theatre meant that some </p>
<p>formations were still being fitted as the first units crossed the line of departure.”</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>572. </b> The 17 October 2003 DOC report stated that training packages, which were </p>
<p>created to aid recognition of Coalition vehicles, arrived “too late and in too small a </p>
<p>quantity to be made widely available” and that the packages were “inadequate for </p>
<p>aircrew training”.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>573. </b> The DOC found that there were not enough Thermal ID and Combat ID panels, </p>
<p>which formed part of the UK’s Combat ID capability for all vehicles, and that they were </p>
<p>not robust and proved to be inadequate aids for Coalition aircrew.</p>
<p><b>574. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee concluded that:</p>
<p>“We expect MOD to implement the lessons from Operation TELIC on Combat ID. </p>
<p>MOD should push forward with the work with its allies to agree on a single system … </p>
<p>We note MOD’s view that the opportunities for fratricide in an increasingly complex </p>
<p>battle space are likely to increase, but look to MOD to identify the required action </p>
<p>and make the necessary investment to ensure that such incidents are reduced to </p>
<p>a minimum.”</p>

<p><b>576. </b> Until January 2003, the UK military plan was to enter Iraq through Turkey. The US, </p>
<p>which was to manage the entry route, stipulated that UK forces should have an asset </p>

<p>303</p>
<p> As a result, the </p>
<p>MOD approved a UOR for the purchase of a US asset tracking system, known as Total </p>
<p>Asset Visibility (TAV). The new system was not in place until the end of February 2003; </p>
<p>too late to be used in the early stages of the deployment.</p>

<p>94</p>
<p><b>577. </b> On 31 January, Lt Gen Reith wrote to Adm Boyce that one of the areas that “may </p>
<p>cause difficulty” as Op TELIC developed was asset tracking.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“All that can be achieved in the time available is being progressed. The integration </p>
<p>of the current system (VITAL … ) and UOR provision of TAV (Total Asset Visibility, a </p>
<p>US System) offers considerable improvement, but is nonetheless a ‘quick fix’ which </p>
<p>does not fully address the capability gap. Medium term work by DLO is in hand.”</p>
<p><b>578. </b> In his post-operation report, Brig Binns stated:</p>
<p>“An inability to track items … all contributed to a serious impact upon the morale of </p>
<p>soldiers about to conduct operations.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>579. </b> When Maj Gen Fry was interviewed by the NAO on 7 August, the report of the </p>
<p>interview sent to Mr Lee stated he had cited poor asset tracking as a “negative aspect” </p>
<p>of Op TELIC.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> It “compounded the lack of availability of certain scarce resources” and </p>
<p>was quoted as saying “we had it but couldn’t find it!”</p>
<p><b>580. </b> The MOD DOC report on 17 October 2003 stated:</p>
<p>“During Operation TELIC, the flow of logistic information up and down the supply </p>
<p>chain and between all stakeholders was poor. For example it was difficult to track </p>
<p>UORs through to the end user in order to match the equipment with relevant training </p>
<p>packages …”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>581. </b> On asset tracking it stated:</p>
<p>“Large amounts of equipment, stores and supplies were reportedly ‘lost’ in theatre, </p>
<p>including ammunition, ECBA &amp; NBC Defence equipment … It was not possible </p>
<p>to track down high priority equipment that was arriving simultaneously with the </p>
<p>sustainment flow. As a result UORs and other priority equipment could not be </p>
<p>targeted for rapid processing. This inability to identify the exact location of equipment </p>
<p>resulted in the degradation of operational capability.”</p>
<p><b>582. </b> In its <i>Lessons for the Future</i> report in December 2003, the MOD stated:</p>
<p>“… the flow of logistics information between theatre and the UK was poor, </p>
<p>particularly affecting the tracking of UORs into theatre. It was difficult to monitor the </p>
<p>rates at which supplies were consumed, making it hard to determine when re-supply </p>
<p>would be required. The lack of available information also reduced commanders’ </p>

<p>and re-order equipment already en route. This added to the burden on the already </p>
<p>over-stretched system.”</p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>583. </b> The MOD stated that “these problems were caused by the continuing lack of </p>
<p>a robust tri-Service inventory system, the ability to track equipment into and through </p>
<p>theatre, and an information system capable of supporting this technology.”</p>
<p><b>584. </b> The NAO recommended in December 2003 that:</p>
<p>“The Department should, as a matter of urgency, continue to work to develop </p>
<p>appropriate logistics systems to track materiel to theatre and ensure its timely </p>
<p>delivery to frontline units.”</p>
<p>309</p>
<p><b>585. </b> On 30 January 2004, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10 with a summary </p>
<p>of lessons learned from Op TELIC, drawing “heavily” on the lines Mr Hoon intended to </p>
<p>use before the House of Commons Defence Committee the following week.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“We have consistently acknowledged that some things did not go as well as we </p>
<p>would have wished. In evidence to HCDC last May Mr Hoon acknowledged that </p>
<p>there were bound to be some problems in a logistics operation of this size, and </p>
<p>that some of our personnel may have experienced shortages of equipment. Our </p>
<p>subsequent work and that of the NAO has shown that these shortages were more </p>
<p>widespread and in some respects more serious than we believed to be the case at </p>
<p>that time.</p>
<p>“In general this was not the result of a failure to obtain and deploy the equipment </p>
<p>required. There is room for debate about the balance between routinely holding </p>
<p>items in our inventory and relying on our ability to generate operation-specific </p>
<p>equipment in short timescales. But a major problem, in our analysis, was that there </p>
<p>were serious shortcomings in our ability to track consignments and assets through </p>
<p>theatre, and to distribute them in a timely fashion to the front line.”</p>
<p><b>586. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote that the MOD had “identified numerous </p>
<p>other areas for further work” and had, for example, increased its stockholdings of </p>
<p>desert clothing and boots and NBC Individual Protective Equipment sets by an </p>
<p>additional 32,000.</p>
<p><b>587. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee concluded that:</p>
<p>“We are in no doubt that one of the key lessons to emerge from Operation TELIC </p>
<p>concerns operational logistic support and specifically, the requirement for a robust </p>

<p>system to track stock and equipment both into and within theatre – a requirement </p>
<p>which was identified in the 1991 Gulf War.”</p>
<p>311</p>
<p><b>588. </b> In May 2009, the NAO recognised that the MOD had “made a number of important </p>
<p>changes” to its logistic support process since the end of combat operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>589. </b> The MOD’s existing systems only provided “a limited tracking capability: a </p>
<p>consignment is only visible once it passes through a specific point in the logistics chain, </p>
<p>but cannot be tracked at all points along the course of its journey”. The NAO stated that </p>
<p>was “nonetheless” an improvement compared to the systems in place in 2003.</p>
<p><b>590. </b> The NAO recommended that the MOD should:</p>
<p>“ … further improve and integrate its logistics information systems, including </p>
<p>consignment and asset tracking, so users on operations have visibility over the </p>
<p>stock already available at different locations in theatre, can track the progress of </p>
<p>deliveries throughout the supply pipeline and see stock availability back in the </p>
<p>United Kingdom.”</p>
<p><b>591. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I think the biggest problem we had was with the tracking systems to actually </p>
<p>ensure we knew exactly what was where, when; and that consignments that </p>
<p>were sent actually arrived in time to be fielded properly. That system was not </p>
<p>fully effective.”</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>592. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“There wasn’t a shortage of equipment in the end. What there was, was an inability </p>
<p>to track it. We knew it was in theatre, but some of it we couldn’t find.”</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>593. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“ … I think it was clear that lack of visibility on what was actually happening in </p>
<p>theatre was hampering us, but, of course, even if you have that visibility, you have </p>
<p>got to identify what are the real substantive problems, and the real substantive </p>
<p>problems were very much to do with asset tracking with knowing where things were, </p>
<p>so you could get them to the right place at the right time. In a number of instances, </p>
<p>the necessary equipment was in theatre, it just wasn’t in the right place, and in some </p>
<p>instances, people didn’t know where it was in theatre.”</p>

<p>97</p>
<p><b>594. </b> ACM Stirrup also described the impact of the difficulties with asset tracking on the </p>
<p>delivery of UORs:</p>
<p>“I was clear in my own mind that the Urgent Operational Requirement process was </p>
<p>only complete when the particular item of equipment was in the hands of those in </p>
<p>theatre who needed it and they were satisfied with it. I actually tried to get some </p>
<p>of my senior staff deployed into theatre to check those specific issues, but it was </p>
<p>decided that we shouldn’t do that and that we should rely on the chain of command. </p>
<p>That, I think, turned out to be the wrong decision and now we routinely have people </p>
<p>deployed for those purposes.”</p>
<p><b>595. </b> Maj Gen Binns told the Inquiry that, in 2003, he had “one of those moments with </p>
<p>my commanding officers in early March when they were saying, ‘I don’t think we can </p>
<p>be ready’”.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> One of the examples he gave as to why they were saying that alluded </p>
<p>to asset tracking:</p>
<p>“We lost a company of Warriors at one stage. We knew that it had been offloaded </p>
<p>from the boats, but I didn’t know where it was. There were a quarter of a million men </p>
<p>in the desert and we couldn’t find this company of Warriors – empty vehicles that </p>
<p>had been taken off lowloaders.”</p>
<p><b>596. </b> In his statement, ACM Bagnall told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“The information which I saw indicated that equipments had arrived in theatre. I did </p>
<p>not see (or at least I do not recall seeing) what became known as ‘the final mile’ </p>
<p>once a particular bit of kit had been unloaded in theatre and moved to where it was </p>
<p>needed. Indeed, this is arguably not information which is required in MOD unless </p>
<p>problems were identified which could not be resolved in theatre by CJO and his </p>
<p>staffs or by the staffs in MOD.”</p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>597. </b> When asked what steps he had taken to assure himself that the forces deployed </p>
<p>had access to sufficient kit and equipment including whether he ever discussed the </p>
<p>matter with Lt Gen Reith or Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burridge, Deputy Commander in </p>
<p>Chief Strike Command and UK National Contingent Commander during the invasion of </p>
<p>Iraq, or any other commander in the field, ACM Bagnall told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… it was CDS who would routinely contact CJO, the national component </p>
<p>commanders, Tampa and others, and I was aware that he was doing so. I did not </p>
<p>have any discussions with them other than on the occasions when I filled the role </p>
<p>of Acting CDS.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>598. </b> ACM Bagnall told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was not aware of any concerns which were raised before the invasion about the </p>
<p>quality and the accuracy of information available in MOD about equipment delivery </p>
<p>to Iraq. I was subsequently told (I think by DCDS(EC)) about concerns relating to </p>
<p>the availability of equipment delivered under the UOR process, and I recall that he </p>
<p>asked for agreement to send some of his people into theatre to monitor progress. </p>
<p>I also recall that I supported this request, but for reasons I cannot remember, the </p>
<p>request was denied. What I was aware of were concerns relating to asset tracking. </p>
<p>This was not a new issue, and it was a topic which we had been working on for </p>
<p>some time.”</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>599. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Boyce stated that he could not recall whether </p>
<p>Ministers had ever been advised of the known weaknesses in asset tracking or the risks </p>
<p>this entailed.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Lord Boyce stated:</p>
<p>“It was absolutely correct that a lot of our stores problems in theatre come 2003 </p>
<p>were as a result of poor asset tracking – and I wonder what the situation is today </p>
<p>if we were to go and ask.”</p>
<p><b>601.  Problems with logistic support were identified soon after the campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>602. </b> RAdm Wood’s findings in his report to ACM Pledger on 20 May included:</p>
<p>“A combination of OP SEC and late definition of force elements and operational </p>
<p>plans all exposed Defence’s growing dependence on industry as a materiel provider </p>
<p>as well as the fragility of some key planning assumptions. This was exacerbated </p>
<p>by some less than adequate personnel and equipment readiness. In the event, </p>
<p>this inevitably manifested itself as significant logistic risk which imposed </p>
<p>operational risk.”</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>603. </b> RAdm Wood also specified that he considered:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Inadequate asset tracking and visibility hindered material preparation for war.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An “urgent review” of the provisioning policy, processes and requirements for </p>
<p>land units was required because the supply chain was “under extreme strain </p>
<p>and, at times, unable to cope” trying to meet equipment requirements.</p>
<p><b>604. </b> In his post-operation report on 6 October 2003, Major General Peter Wall, </p>
<p>GOC 1 (UK) Div May 2003 to January 2005, wrote that one of the “key areas” to note </p>

<p>was “the breaking of LAND mandated and resourced readiness states and training in </p>
<p>readiness assumptions”.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“OP TELIC demonstrated clearly that current readiness states are not in line with </p>
<p>strategic reality … The time given for deployment was significantly shorter than </p>
<p>that defined in the Defence Planning Assumptions. This had many impacts in the </p>
<p>manning, equipping and building the … sustainability of the force.”</p>
<p><b>MOD reflections on equipping the forces deployed for the conflict</b></p>
<p><b>605.  Reports published in 2003 after the conflict suggested that land equipment </b></p>
<p><b>performed well during the combat phase of operations.</b></p>
<p><b>606. </b> In the MOD’s <i>First Reflections</i> report on operations in Iraq in July 2003, it stated </p>
<p>that the “success of operations in Iraq demonstrated the effectiveness and extensive </p>
<p>capability of the modern equipment and logistics support available to our Armed </p>
<p>Forces”.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>607. </b> The MOD’s second report, <i>Lessons for the Future</i>, assessed that:</p>
<p>“Overall, land equipment performed well and reliability levels were often </p>
<p>exceptionally high despite the challenges of a very demanding environment.”</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>608. </b> The DOC stated that during the deployment and invasion phases of Op TELIC, </p>
<p>“UK equipment and maintenance regimes coped well with the environment and </p>
<p>manoeuvre demands placed upon them”.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p><b>609. </b> The NAO concluded in its report on 11 December 2003 that:</p>
<p>“Throughout the war-fighting phase of Operation TELIC a number of both new and </p>
<p>in service equipments operated effectively in the austere environment of Iraq.”</p>
<p>325</p>
<p><b>610.  The late delivery of some UORs, however, meant that soldiers were not </b></p>
<p><b>always able to be trained on equipment before its use.</b></p>
<p><b>611. </b> The DOC report on 17 October 2003 stated:</p>
<p>“A consequence of the compressed timescales for UOR delivery was that personnel </p>
<p>did not always have time to train or become properly familiar with equipment, either </p>
<p>before deployment or in theatre … This undermined the rationale for delivering </p>
<p>UOR equipment to improve operational effectiveness. Users did not have complete </p>
<p>confidence in their ability to use equipment, and commanders were not always able </p>

<p>be used in combination to deliver an effect.”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>612. </b>  The Barry Report published in August 2010 stated:</p>
<p>“The UOR process did not produce enough equipment to meet the training </p>
<p>requirements. So some troops first encountered new equipments in theatre </p>
<p>and commanders assessed that casualties resulted, particularly in the period </p>
<p>immediately after a brigade relief in place.”</p>
<p>327</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“There is no point being told ‘Here is a UOR for a nice gizmo, a nice new piece of </p>
<p>kit which you can only have, by the way, in theatre’, if the person operating that kit </p>
<p>doesn’t see it for the first time until he actually gets to theatre, because he will die </p>
<p>trying to learn how to use it.”</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>Training on equipment post-conflict</b></p>
<p>Before 2006, it was not possible to purchase equipment with a training margin with a </p>
<p>UOR. One of the results of this was consistent reports from the field about the difficulties </p>
<p>presented by the lack of training on equipment that personnel would use once deployed.</p>
<p>A DOC report in September 2007 stated:</p>
<p>“Combat Body Armour (CBA), protected vehicles, comms and ECM(FP) (Electronic </p>
<p>Counter Measure Force Protection) equipment, particularly UOR procured </p>
<p>equipment, were regularly unavailable for training/familiarisation at PDT </p>
<p>[Pre-Deployment Training].”</p>
<p>329</p>
<p>Major General William Rollo, GOC MND(SE) from July 2004 to December 2004, wrote in </p>
<p>his post-operation tour report:</p>
<p>“More training on Snatch and other UOR equipments … must be factored into </p>
<p>pre-deployment preparation.”</p>
<p>330</p>
<p>That point was reiterated in post-operation tour reports from the following two successors </p>

<p>The UOR rules were changed to include a training margin in 2006.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> The September 2007 </p>
<p>DOC report stated:</p>
<p>“The recent Treasury decision to permit UOR procured equipment to include an </p>
<p>allocation for training is already having an effect…”</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Andrew Figgures, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Equipment </p>
<p>Capability) from June 2006, told the Inquiry that decision was “an important step </p>
<p>forward”.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p><b>614.  The restrictions until 15 October 2002 on discussions with industry about </b></p>
<p><b>potential operations in Iraq did prevent early conversations with industry about </b></p>
<p><b>the provision of equipment.</b></p>
<p><b>615.  But it is clear that the most senior military officers and officials understood </b></p>
<p><b>the reasons for that decision.</b></p>
<p><b>616. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… some very contingent UOR work was authorised by Mr Hoon at the time under </p>
<p>CDS’ pressure … but those were very much ones which could be done invisibly.”</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Asked if he had sensed some reluctance in the Government to agree preparatory </p>
<p>steps, Maj Gen Fry replied that he thought there was, but that had to be qualified to </p>
<p>reflect the fact that what he saw was determined by his role in the PJHQ. In his view it </p>
<p>was understandable if Ministers had been “trying to reserve their positions for as long </p>
<p>as they could”.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p><b>618. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“All I know is that Mike [Boyce] and I went to meetings in September, where we </p>
<p>argued the case and that we were both made very well aware of the attitude in </p>
<p>Downing Street towards the requirement for minimising publicity and for avoiding </p>
<p>the visibility of preparations. We were both there at these meetings. So there was </p>
<p>no doubt of the fact that we could not go out, either of us, and overtly prepare, which </p>
<p>is why we had to approach some of the UORs in a particular way …</p>
<p>“I think the judgement that I had to make and he had to make was the extent to </p>
<p>which we could go on with preparations without affecting that diplomatic process </p>
<p>in the United Nations.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>619.  The evidence given to the Inquiry demonstrates that senior military </b></p>
<p><b>officers and officials in the MOD fully understood the limitations on the size and </b></p>
<p><b>readiness of the forces available for deployment on expeditionary operations </b></p>
<p><b>agreed in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review and set out in the Defence Planning </b></p>
<p><b>Assumptions (DPAs).</b></p>
<p><b>620. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit stated that the scale of the deployment was consistent with the </p>
<p>DPAs, and that: “It was the type of operation that we expected from time to time to be </p>
<p>able to mount.”</p>
<p>337</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit was later asked what lessons had been learned from the earlier </p>
<p>experience in Iraq.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> One lesson he cited was:</p>
<p>“… we assumed that we would have stocks for six months, and that when we came </p>
<p>to a major operation we would have preparation time to conduct a large scale </p>
<p>operation by building up stocks in that period.</p>
<p>“… if we wanted to go for a large scale, we would need six months in order to </p>
<p>acquire the necessary extra equipment, stores, personnel, clothing, ammunition, </p>
<p>things like that.”</p>
<p><b>622. </b>  On the SDR, Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… when we said that the SDR did involve the ability to move up to large scale </p>
<p>from time to time, we hadn’t got a precise view, but we were looking at once every </p>
<p>10 years we could gravitate up to large scale.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Gen Jackson told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… the Defence Planning Assumptions which had emerged from the Strategic </p>
<p>Defence Review of 1997/98 allowed for, from time to time, a large commitment, </p>
<p>which in land force terms was at the divisional level, this was not regarded as </p>
<p>anything we could contemplate on an enduring basis, a one-off from time to time …</p>
<p>“More germanely we would be able to maintain a medium-sized commitment, </p>
<p>i.e. brigade level, indefinitely and we could on a one-off basis add a second medium </p>
<p>scale commitment.</p>
<p>“There was some small print about a small scale … but I think it is within the ability </p>
<p>to produce a second brigade on a short-term basis.”</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>624.  The MOD also understood that the deployment could not be sustained for </b></p>
<p><b>more than six months.</b></p>

<p>But it never seemed to me very likely that we would be out [of] there [Iraq] in </p>
<p>six months.”</p>
<p>341</p>
<p><b>627. </b> Sir Kevin later said: “Our assumptions never involve more than six months at that </p>
<p>level.”</p>
<p>342</p>
<p><b>628. </b> With regard to large scale deployments, Gen Jackson stated:</p>
<p>“… the large scale concept, in land component terms we are talking around </p>
<p>30,000 or 25,000 certainly, the concept is you put in that large commitment on a </p>
<p>one-off basis and then you must downsize, because the Army cannot sustain a </p>
<p>deployment of 25,000 to 30,000 indefinitely.”</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>629.  The Inquiry was offered different perspectives on the degree to which </b></p>
<p><b>exceeding the Planning Assumptions had put a strain on the system that it was </b></p>
<p><b>not able to meet.</b></p>
<p><b>630. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“Over time the scale of ambition got larger and larger, so at the end of it we were </p>
<p>looking at something which involved a full deployed joint force with … land, air and </p>
<p>maritime forces, and in addition to that, special forces and logistic forces as well.”</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>631. </b> Asked if he had thought there was sufficient time to prepare the force for battle, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry stated that it was “a bit of a rush and there were inherent risks involved”.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry that he was “quite happy” in terms of readiness and </p>
<p>training.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> He said that 7 Armoured Brigade had been selected because it was “the </p>
<p>most highly trained of all the armoured brigades”. In addition, 3 Commando Brigade and </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade were both part of the Joint Rapid Reaction Force and, therefore, </p>
<p>“maintained a high standard of training and readiness on a permanent basis”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>633. </b> ACM Stirrup told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we simply did not have enough time … to do everything that we needed to </p>
<p>before the operation started.”</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit stated that:</p>
<p>“The timescale was slightly compressed, more than we would have wished, which </p>
<p>we made very clear, so that we didn’t have everything that we would have wanted at </p>
<p>the right moment, but the shortfall was not operationally significant …”</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit subsequently told the Inquiry that the switch to the South:</p>
<p>“ … was not as difficult as I thought it was going to be … I think it was a great </p>
<p>achievement … which surprised me … [T]he quality of the military effort was </p>
<p>tremendous … because it wasn’t just a question of moving to a different host nation </p>
<p>support arrangements, it’s a question of a differently configured force …</p>
<p>“I think the military had been running a slightly parallel option for a bit of time during </p>
<p>December, actually.”</p>
<p>349</p>
<p><b>636. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit added:</p>
<p>“I think that to the extent that there were pressures and problems with the operation </p>
<p>itself … those were more about the amount of time available to do the planning of </p>
<p>the actual build-up itself, warning time, the switch from one area to another, the </p>
<p>difficulty of doing overt military preparations as early as they needed to be done </p>
<p>because of the desire not to disrupt the UN track.</p>
<p>“Those were the bigger problems in ensuring that we got the force structure ready </p>
<p>when eventually the time came, and the fact that we would have preferred another </p>
<p>month, in ideal circumstances, to do that build-up.”</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Gen Jackson told the Inquiry that the “whole order of battle” had been “in a state of </p>
<p>flux” until early 2003.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> But he confirmed that he had been confident the UK could put a </p>
<p>division into the field.</p>
<p><b>638. </b> Gen Jackson subsequently described the forces deployed as “a very interesting </p>
<p>divisional construct” which he did not think had been done before: “but it was the right </p>
<p>construct for the task which confronted 1 (UK) Armoured Division.”</p>

<p>105</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Asked when the UK started looking at the South as an alternative, Lord Boyce </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that the process had started “at least in December 2002”.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>acknowledged that December was “quite late in the day” to start looking at options in </p>
<p>the South.</p>
<p><b>640. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Boyce whether, as a result of the late changes to the </p>
<p>military package, British troops had the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> Lord Boyce replied that </p>
<p>while it “left us with some very short timelines”, he was “confident” that the “front of the </p>
<p>front line” were properly equipped on 20 March.</p>
<p><b>641. </b> When asked whether he would have ideally deployed the land force sooner to </p>
<p>allow for more training and time to acclimatise, or to ensure it had the right equipment, </p>
<p>Lord Boyce replied:</p>
<p>“My advice was that they had had sufficient time to make themselves ready.”</p>
<p>355</p>
<p><b>642. </b> In his later statement to the Inquiry, Lord Boyce wrote that the land forces for </p>
<p>the South:</p>
<p>“… were largely based on what were already being prepared for the northern </p>
<p>option. However, because of the change in plan, the US agreed to assist with some </p>
<p>enabling and logistics assets in the south. Maritime (including amphibious) and air </p>
<p>force levels were much the same. The thinking about a possible southern option had </p>
<p>started in late autumn 2002 and so the concept was already well developed by the </p>
<p>time the northern option was abandoned.”</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Lord Boyce added:</p>
<p>“…the equipment being procured for the land forces previously designated for the </p>
<p>northern option largely serviced them when they were re-roled south, although there </p>
<p>was a need to recognise the more extensive desert environment.”</p>
<p><b>644. </b> Lord Boyce subsequently told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Although the final switch did happen around mid-January, really our minds in terms </p>
<p>of planning and thinking about it and looking at all the potential pitfalls or difficulties </p>
<p>or whatever had started, as you say, probably as far back as October; but during the </p>
<p>course of December we really thought that was possibly where we were going to </p>
<p>finish up …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>“… we could afford to take the decision quite late. It wasn’t starting with a fresh plan </p>
<p>in the middle of January. The southern plan was pretty well developed, in fact almost </p>
<p>entirely developed, by then.”</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Asked about the impact of the reduction in preparation time, Lord Boyce stated:</p>
<p>“… it meant everything was being done at a rush … some aspects of the full </p>
<p>operational capability weren’t achieved until literally the nth hour … I don’t believe … </p>
<p>that our capability at the end of the day was in any sense seriously degraded … but </p>
<p>nonetheless it did make it a tight run thing.”</p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>646. </b> Describing the thinking which had led to the UK’s original offer in Package 3 in </p>
<p>October of a brigade and divisional headquarters, Lord Boyce stated that it was “not a </p>
<p>huge move then … into a division minus, which is what we actually finished up with”.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p><b>647. </b> Asked whether, when he had visited UK forces just before the start of operations, </p>
<p>he had been given any indications that they were lacking equipment such as body </p>
<p>armour and ammunition, Lord Boyce replied: “No”. But he added that he had been </p>
<p>concerned about the “ability to cope with any biological or chemical threat”, and at </p>
<p>the time of his visit, a “very small percentage” of the force had not had their gas </p>
<p>masks checked.</p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>648.  The achievements of the MOD and the Armed Forces in preparing the </b></p>
<p><b>forces deployed for combat operations in Iraq against tight deadlines were </b></p>
<p><b>very considerable.</b></p>
<p><b>649.  But the evidence set out in this Section of the Report demonstrates that </b></p>
<p><b>significant risks were taken as a result of decisions made in mid-January to </b></p>
<p><b>deploy a larger combat force in a very compressed timescale. The difficulties were </b></p>
<p><b>exacerbated by the absence of systems which could accurately track and report </b></p>
<p><b>the situation on the ground.</b></p>
<p><b>650.  The provision of additional funding from the Reserve for UORs worked well </b></p>
<p><b>and there is no evidence of any delay or obstruction on the part of the Treasury.</b></p>
<p><b>651.  A number of witnesses to the Inquiry stated, or implied, that the serious </b></p>
<p><b>shortfalls of some equipment could have been mitigated if permission to discuss </b></p>
<p><b>procurement with industry had been given earlier.</b></p>
<p><b>652.  That claim is impossible to determine. It is clear that the restrictions on </b></p>
<p><b>discussions with industry before 15 October did hinder planning and preparations </b></p>
<p><b>and cause anxiety.</b></p>

<p>6.3  |  Military equipment (pre-conflict)</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>653.  However, the most senior military officers and officials understood the </b></p>
<p><b>political and diplomatic reasons for that decision and Ministers were not advised </b></p>
<p><b>that the restrictions would have a direct adverse impact on capabilities.</b></p>
<p><b>654.  The problems encountered by the forces deployed to Iraq in early 2003 do </b></p>
<p><b>not appear to have been directly attributable to the absence of discussions with </b></p>
<p><b>industry before 15 October.</b></p>
<p><b>655.  The evidence suggests that most of the difficulties arose from the decisions </b></p>
<p><b>to deploy a force more quickly than the Defence Planning Assumptions (DPAs) </b></p>
<p><b>envisaged.</b></p>
<p><b>656.  The 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and Defence Strategic Plan had set </b></p>
<p><b>clear guidelines about the military resources required for potential operations of </b></p>
<p><b>different scale and duration. The DPAs also set out the time likely to be necessary </b></p>
<p><b>to adequately prepare UK forces for operations, including the time needed to </b></p>
<p><b>procure and deploy equipment and train personnel on its use.</b></p>
<p><b>657.  The DPAs determined the equipment procured for the Armed Forces and </b></p>
<p><b>that the stocks held should be sufficient only to meet the readiness requirements </b></p>
<p><b>specified in the DPAs.</b></p>
<p><b>658.  The 1998 SDR had also concluded that the UK needed a better expeditionary </b></p>
<p><b>capability to reflect the nature of future threats and the environments, such as the </b></p>
<p><b>Gulf, in which the UK should plan to operate.</b></p>
<p><b>659.  By 2002, when military planning for potential operations in Iraq commenced, </b></p>
<p><b>that capability had not been fully achieved.</b></p>
<p><b>660.  The policy underpinning the DPAs of relying on sufficient preparation time </b></p>
<p><b>to procure UORs and additional stocks to meet identified shortfalls before a large </b></p>
<p><b>scale deployment was explicitly acknowledged by the MOD in spring 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>661.  In the second half of 2002, however, the MOD was already supporting two </b></p>
<p><b>simultaneous medium scale operations, in the Balkans and Operation FRESCO, </b></p>
<p><b>and a number of small scale operations, including in Afghanistan. The Armed </b></p>
<p><b>Forces were thus already stretched to the maximum level envisaged under </b></p>
<p><b>the DPAs, beyond which time would be needed to acquire additional stocks </b></p>
<p><b>and equipment.</b></p>
<p><b>662.  The decisions between mid-December 2002 and mid-January 2003, to </b></p>
<p><b>increase the force deployed for ground operations to three combat brigades </b></p>
<p><b>and the decisions to commit 16 Air Assault Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade to </b></p>
<p><b>military operations in southern Iraq in late March, had a significant impact on the </b></p>
<p><b>scale of some UORs and compressed the time available for the provision and </b></p>
<p><b>delivery of equipment to front line units.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>663.  The force deployed in 2003 was larger than the UK contribution in the Gulf </b></p>
<p><b>Conflict in 1991 and the time to prepare was significantly shorter than the six to </b></p>
<p><b>nine months assumed in the DPAs.</b></p>
<p><b>664.  Lt Gen Reith acknowledged in May 2003 that the military commitment was, </b></p>
<p><b>“as often happens, at a scale beyond that envisaged in the DPAs and thus not </b></p>
<p><b>fully resourced”.</b></p>
<p><b>665.  When decisions were made in mid-January, the inherent risks for equipping </b></p>
<p><b>the force to be deployed and its readiness were neither properly identified nor </b></p>
<p><b>considered.</b></p>
<p><b>666.  The military advice in late January 2003 that there were “no showstoppers” </b></p>
<p><b>disguised the fact that risks had been accepted which had not been fully exposed </b></p>
<p><b>to Ministers.</b></p>
<p><b>667.  Adm Boyce had assured Mr Blair on 13 March 2003 that the Armed Forces </b></p>
<p><b>faced “no serious equipment problems”.</b></p>
<p><b>668.  The context suggests he was referring to the invasion phase. As Section 8 </b></p>
<p><b>shows, the US and UK did not expect Iraqi forces to be able effectively to resist </b></p>
<p><b>Coalition Forces.</b></p>
<p><b>669.  There may be circumstances in the future when a Government will feel it </b></p>
<p><b>necessary to take decisions to commit the Armed Forces to military operations </b></p>
<p><b>which exceed the planning assumptions on which they have been equipped and </b></p>
<p><b>prepared. But they should not do so without an explicit acceptance of the risks </b></p>
<p><b>being taken.</b></p>
<p><b>670.  In addition, a number of lessons from previous conflicts and exercises had </b></p>
<p><b>not been addressed before the deployment to Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>671.  In particular, poor asset tracking systems meant that an already over-</b></p>
<p><b>burdened system was put under even greater pressure, and equipment that had </b></p>
<p><b>been deployed to the forces in Kuwait did not reach the front line before military </b></p>
<p><b>operations began.</b></p>
<p><b>672.  ACM Stirrup accurately summarised the position when he told the Inquiry </b></p>
<p><b>that “the issue was it was all being done so rapidly at the last minute no one was </b></p>
<p><b>quite sure who had what”.</b></p>
<p><b>673.  The MOD’s asset tracking system was still in need of improvement when the </b></p>
<p><b>UK left Iraq in 2009.</b></p>
<p><b>674.  The MOD had given assurances before the 2003 invasion that the necessary </b></p>
<p><b>lessons had been learned since 1991. This proved not to be the case. In any future </b></p>
<p><b>eventuality, the MOD has a responsibility to ensure that past mistakes are not </b></p>
<p><b>repeated, and that its systems for asset tracking are robust.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.3  |  Military equipment (pre-conflict)</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>675.  The emergence after the conflict of the scale and nature of the problems </b></p>
<p><b>encountered illuminated the extent to which Ministers had been unaware of </b></p>
<p><b>risks being taken for which they would have been accountable. The shortfalls </b></p>
<p><b>in individual equipment, protection against chemical and biological attack, and </b></p>
<p><b>ammunition did not have an impact on the overall success of the invasion.</b></p>
<p><b>676.  But they did have an impact on individuals.</b></p>
<p><b>677.  In the case of Sgt Steven Roberts, it was judged that his death could have </b></p>
<p><b>been prevented if he had still had his body armour.</b></p>
<p><b>678.  As the evidence in this Section shows, reports about equipment shortfalls </b></p>
<p><b>from the media and from members of the Armed Forces also had a negative </b></p>
<p><b>impact on the perceptions of the morale of troops on the ground and on how the </b></p>
<p><b>campaign was seen by the public and Parliament.</b></p>
<p><b>679.  In addition, analysis of the events in 2003 shows that, until May, neither </b></p>
<p><b>PJHQ nor MOD had a proper understanding of the problems with equipment that </b></p>
<p><b>units were experiencing on the ground.</b></p>
<p><b>680.  Lord Bach was right to have suggested on 11 February 2003 that a direct </b></p>
<p><b>and robust system accurately to report on readiness and equipment issues from </b></p>
<p><b>theatre to Ministers was needed.</b></p>
<p><b>681.  During military operations, reporting to the MOD will always be constrained </b></p>
<p><b>by the limitations of military operations and the pressures on those involved, and </b></p>
<p><b>military commanders need the freedom to take operational decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>682.  In any future operations, however, the MOD should ensure that it has robust </b></p>
<p><b>systems in place to accurately report the situation on the ground without usurping </b></p>
<p><b>the responsibilities of the chain of command.</b></p>
