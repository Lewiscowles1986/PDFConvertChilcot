<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the UK’s Iraq strategy between 1990 and 2000. Although </p>
<p>this period falls outside the Inquiry’s Terms of Reference, events during that time </p>
<p>nonetheless have a bearing on the subsequent policy decisions the Inquiry is examining.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address the review of UK policy on Iraq which began in </p>
<p>September 2000. That is addressed in Section 1.2.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> This Section draws on material which is in the public domain, including the Ministry of </p>
<p>Defence’s <i>Statements on the Defence Estimates</i> 1991 (Cm 1559-I) and 1992 (Cm 1981), </p>
<p>a paper on No-Fly Zones prepared for the Inquiry by the MOD in November 2009 and </p>
<p>published on the Inquiry’s website, the <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass </i></p>
<p><i>Destruction</i> (HC 898) in 2004, and House of Commons Research Papers 98/28, 99/13 </p>
<p>and 02/53. Other sources, including evidence provided to the Inquiry, are identified in a </p>
<p>footnote where appropriate.</p>
<p>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The Inquiry is grateful to Dr Hans Blix, Director General of the International Atomic </p>
<p>Energy Agency (IAEA) from 1981 to 1997 and Executive Chairman of the United Nations </p>
<p>Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission on Iraq (UNMOVIC) from 2000 to </p>
<p>2003, for giving oral evidence to the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The Inquiry also asked Mr Rolf Ekéus, Executive Chairman of the United Nations  </p>
<p>Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq from 1991 to 1997 (and previously the </p>
<p>Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva from 1978 to 1983 and </p>
<p>involved in international negotiations on the Chemical Weapons Convention and the </p>
<p>Control and Verification of the Biological Weapons Convention), whether he had any </p>
<p>insights or reflections on the results of inspections in the 1990s and Iraq’s response to </p>
<p>them; and for any comment he might wish to make on Dr Blix’s evidence on UNSCOM’s </p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Inquiry is grateful to Mr Ekéus for his statement, in which he describes the role, </p>
<p>methodology and independence of UNSCOM and its relationship with the IAEA, and </p>
<p>for agreeing that it could be published with the Inquiry’s Report. Mr Ekéus emphasised </p>
<p>the complexity of UNSCOM’s operations, which he felt had been “missing” from the oral </p>
<p>evidence presented to the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>UK Iraq strategy</b></p>
<p><b>7. </b> Following the Gulf Conflict in 1990-1991, the UK and the US played a leading role in </p>
<p>sustaining a policy of containment and deterrence towards Iraq for the rest of the decade. </p>
<p>US and UK policies were intertwined. UK policy evolved through a process of dialogue </p>
<p>and negotiation between the UK and US Governments, and, in turn, between each </p>
<p>Government and its other partners and allies at the UN, in the region, and in Europe.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Although it is not the task of the Inquiry to evaluate US policy, the approach taken </p>
<p>by the UK Government can only be understood in the context of its dialogue with </p>
<p>Washington and the evolution of US policy.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> The UK and the US shared common strategic interests in the region, but their </p>
<p>analyses and policies were not identical and there were important differences in their </p>
<p>tactical and diplomatic approaches. France and Russia also had key interests in Iraq, </p>
<p>which pre-dated the 1990-1991 Gulf Conflict, including in relation to outstanding debts </p>
<p>for arms they had supplied. As Permanent Members of the Security Council, they too </p>
<p>had significant influence on the development of international policy on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait</b></p>
<p><b>10. </b> After the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, Iraq continued to develop its military capability. </p>
<p>Some Western governments had shown a degree of support for Iraq during that conflict, </p>
<p>but tension grew between Iraq and the West as evidence emerged of advanced work </p>
<p>on weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, in contravention of Iraq’s </p>
<p>international treaty obligations. Some Western firms were implicated in supplying </p>
<p>material to Iraq, as Lord Justice Scott set out in the <i>Report of the Inquiry into the Export </i></p>
<p><i>of Defence Equipment and Dual-Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions</i>, published </p>
<p>in 1996. The execution of <i>Observer</i> freelance journalist Mr Farzad Bazoft in March 1990 </p>
<p>led to the withdrawal of the British Ambassador to Iraq. The subsequent discovery at </p>
<p>Heathrow Airport, the same month, of an attempt to smuggle nuclear-weapons-related </p>
<p>components further exacerbated the deterioration in the UK’s relations with Iraq.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> In July 1990, Saddam Hussein accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of </p>
<p>waging economic warfare against Iraq. The accusation was based on: their reluctance </p>
<p>to reduce oil production to force a rise in prices; Kuwait’s unwillingness to cancel Iraq’s </p>
<p>debts for the large loans it had received during the Iran-Iraq War; and accusations that </p>
<p>Kuwait was stealing from the Rumaylah oilfield, which straddles the border between Iraq </p>
<p>and Kuwait. Iraq began moving the eight divisions of the Republican Guard towards the </p>
<p>border on 16 July. Negotiations to settle the dispute, facilitated by King Fahd of Saudi </p>
<p>Arabia and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, began in Jedda on 31 July.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Despite assurances of peaceful intent from Saddam Hussein to King Fahd and </p>
<p>President Mubarak, Iraqi military forces invaded Kuwait in the early hours of 1 August. </p>
<p>Within a few hours, the UN Security Council met to discuss elements of a draft </p>
<p>resolution. On 2 August, the Security Council adopted resolution 660 (1990), determining </p>
<p>that a breach of international peace and security existed, and confirming that it was </p>
<p>acting under Articles 39 and 40 of the UN Charter (see Box, ‘The Charter framework for </p>
<p>the use of force’). The resolution condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait; demanded </p>
<p>that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally all its forces to the positions in </p>
<p>which they were located on 1 August 1990; called upon Iraq and Kuwait immediately to </p>
<p>begin intensive negotiations to resolve their differences; and decided to meet again as </p>
<p>necessary to consider further steps to ensure compliance with the resolution.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>25</p>
<p><b>13. </b> On 6 August, the Security Council adopted resolution 661 (1990), reaffirming </p>
<p>resolution 660 and expressing deep concern that it had not been implemented, despite </p>
<p>Kuwait’s expression of readiness to comply. Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter </p>
<p>(see Box, ‘The Charter framework for the use of force’), the Security Council decided to </p>
<p>take measures to secure compliance with the demand for immediate Iraqi withdrawal </p>
<p>which was included in resolution 660. Resolution 661 imposed comprehensive economic </p>
<p>sanctions on Iraq, including prohibiting the import and export of all commodities </p>
<p>into and out of Iraq, with the exception of medical supplies and, in humanitarian </p>
<p>circumstances, foodstuffs. The resolution also prohibited States from providing any </p>
<p>funding or financial or economic resources to Iraq, and required them to freeze any of </p>
<p>its assets or resources, with the exception of payments for medical or humanitarian </p>
<p>purposes. A Committee of all Council members was established to review and report on </p>
<p>implementation of the sanctions.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Resolution 662 (1990), adopted on 9 August, recorded that the Security Council </p>
<p>had decided Iraq’s annexation of Kuwait was “null and void”, and called upon all States, </p>
<p>international organisations and specialised agencies not to recognise it. Eight further </p>
<p>resolutions followed addressing: the safety of third-State nationals within Iraq and </p>
<p>Kuwait; the circumstances in which the importation of foodstuffs would be permitted; and </p>
<p>further condemning Iraqi attacks on Kuwaiti, third-State and diplomatic persons. By early </p>
<p>September, 17 countries had committed forces to a growing, US-led military coalition, </p>
<p>which was already involved in enforcing sanctions. The US, UK and France had agreed </p>
<p>to deploy air and land forces to Saudi Arabia to deter Iraq from further aggression. In </p>
<p>September and October, further forces were deployed as the international community </p>
<p>prepared to liberate Kuwait if Saddam Hussein did not comply with the Security </p>
<p>Council’s demand that he withdraw.</p>
<p><b>Resolution 678 (1990)</b></p>
<p><b>15. </b> On 29 November, the Security Council adopted resolution 678 (1990) which said </p>
<p>that, acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, it:</p>
<p>“Demands that Iraq comply fully with resolution 660 and all subsequent resolutions, </p>
<p>and decides, while maintaining all its decisions, to allow Iraq one final opportunity, as </p>
<p>a pause of goodwill, to do so;</p>
<p>“Authorises Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait, unless Iraq </p>
<p>on or before 15 January 1991 fully implements the above-mentioned resolutions, to </p>
<p>use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 and all subsequent </p>
<p>relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The resolution was adopted by 12 votes to two (Cuba and Yemen); China abstained.</p>

<p>UN Security Council resolution 678 (1990).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>The Charter framework for the use of force</b></p>
<p>The United Nations was established in 1945 “to save succeeding generations from the </p>
<p>scourge of war”. In its Charter, it set out its intention to “ensure, by the acceptance of </p>
<p>principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the </p>
<p>common interest”. The purposes of the UN include: “To maintain international peace </p>
<p>and security, and to that end to take effective collective measures for the prevention and </p>
<p>removal of threats to the peace …” (Article 1). States are forbidden to use force against </p>
<p>the territorial integrity or political independence of other States (Article 2, paragraph 4).</p>
<p>Chapter VI of the United Nations Charter contains prescriptions relating to the peaceful </p>
<p>settlement of disputes. Chapter VII contains, but is not limited to, what were intended to </p>
<p>be comprehensive prescriptions relating to the use of force in the context of “action with </p>
<p>respect to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression”.</p>
<p>The UN Charter envisaged that States would not need to use force to protect their national </p>
<p>interests. The intention was for any threat to the peace, breach of the peace or act of </p>
<p>aggression to be met by collective security, provided by the Security Council. Article 39 </p>
<p>provides for the Security Council to determine the existence of a threat to the peace, </p>
<p>breach of the peace, or act of aggression, which must precede enforcement measures </p>
<p>under Articles 41 (sanctions) and 42 (military enforcement measures).</p>
<p>Article 40 provides for the Security Council to call upon the parties to comply with </p>
<p>such provisional measures as it deems necessary or desirable, before making </p>
<p>recommendations or taking other measures to maintain or restore international peace </p>
<p>and security. That has proved, for political reasons, impossible to achieve in the </p>
<p>form envisaged under Chapter VII. Instead, the United Nations has resorted to UN </p>
<p>peacekeeping (in which the consent of the “host State” is required). On two occasions, </p>
<p>UN Members have been authorised (but not obliged, as the unimplemented Charter </p>
<p>provisions envisaged) to engage in assisting a State that had been invaded (South Korea </p>
<p>in Security Council resolution 83 (1950) and Kuwait in Security Council resolution 678 </p>
<p>(1990) in repelling that attack.</p>
<p>Such authorisations are in every way exceptional. In the case of Korea, it was conducted, </p>
<p>formally at least, under a United Nations Command. In the case of the 1990-1991 Gulf </p>
<p>Conflict, the authorisation given in resolution 678 to “Member States co-operating with the </p>
<p>Government of Kuwait” was not under a unified UN command, but was the final element of </p>
<p>an immediately prior series of resolutions. The authorisation in both cases – two examples </p>
<p>in nearly 60 years – was within the context of Security Council control. The authorisations </p>
<p>for the use of force were clear in their terms, as is consistent with the Charter and the </p>
<p>primacy of the responsibility of the Security Council (in contrast to the General Assembly) </p>
<p>as articulated in Article 24 of the Charter.</p>
<p>The idea that “authorisation” by the Security Council is far from being a routine basis for a </p>
<p>legitimate use of force by a State, or coalitions of States, is further suggested by the fact </p>
<p>that the authorisation in both Security Council resolution 83 (1950) and resolution 678 </p>
<p>(1990) referred to a use of force in assistance of the attacked country to repel an invasion, </p>
<p>the attacking State having failed to withdraw.</p>
<p>Article 48 of the Charter provides that action to carry out the decisions of the Security </p>
<p>Council for the maintenance of international peace and security “shall be taken by all </p>
<p>the Members of the United Nations or by some of them, as the Security Council shall </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>determine”.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> There is no suggestion in the Charter of a residual right for individual </p>
<p>Members to enforce Security Council decisions.</p>
<p>Article 51 provides that nothing in the Charter should impair the inherent right of individual </p>
<p>or collective self-defence in the event of an armed attack on a Member State, until the </p>
<p>Security Council has taken the measures necessary to maintain international peace and </p>
<p>security. Although a State may act in self-defence without prior authorisation, it is required </p>
<p>immediately to report such action to the Security Council; and such action would not in </p>
<p>any way affect the authority of the Security Council. The intention to exercise overarching </p>
<p>Security Council control, is apparent.</p>
<p>The scheme of the Charter, against which all resolutions should be viewed for the proper </p>
<p>understanding of their terms, suggests both that authorisations to States to use force to </p>
<p>enforce a Security Council decision in the context of a threat to international peace are </p>
<p>extremely rare, and that they occur only with the clear agreement of the Security Council. </p>
<p>The Security Council, however, has rarely engaged directly in efforts to resolve individual </p>
<p>conflicts. Its involvement in containing Iraq after the invasion of Kuwait and its subsequent </p>
<p>liberation in 1991 was unusual.</p>
<p><b>The 1991 Gulf Conflict</b></p>
<p><b>17. </b> Iraq did not comply with resolution 678. Discussions in Geneva between </p>
<p>Mr James Baker (the US Secretary of State) and Mr Tariq Aziz (the Iraqi Foreign Minister), </p>
<p>and in Baghdad between Mr Perez de Cuellar (the UN Secretary-General) and </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, were unsuccessful.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> On 14 January 1991, Saddam Hussein called on the Iraqi people to fight to the </p>
<p>death to hold on to Kuwait. The coalition began the military operation to liberate Kuwait, </p>
<p>named Operation Desert Storm, on 17 January. The coalition comprised 42 States. In </p>
<p>addition to the US and UK, 13 countries, including France and a number of Arab and </p>
<p>Gulf States, took part in offensive operations. The campaign began with air strikes, </p>
<p>with the objective of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disrupting Iraq’s command, control and communications;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>destroying Iraq’s nuclear, biological and chemical warfare capability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>severing supply routes to Kuwait; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>attacking Iraqi forces in Kuwait.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> From mid-February, Russia sought to broker a deal for the withdrawal of Iraq from </p>
<p>Kuwait, but Iraq’s conditions were unacceptable to the Security Council. In a final effort </p>
<p>to obtain Iraqi compliance, coalition governments issued a statement on 22 February </p>
<p>setting out the conditions which Iraq needed to meet to bring about a cessation of </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>In resolution 221 (1966) the Security Council authorised the UK “to prevent, by the use of force, if </p>
<p>necessary” the arrival at Beira of vessels believed to be carrying oil destined for Southern Rhodesia, </p>
<p>and empowered the UK to arrest and detain the tanker <i>Joanna V</i> upon departure from Beira.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>hostilities. The statement made clear that if Iraq informed the UN of its acceptance </p>
<p>before noon on 23 February, the coalition would not launch a ground offensive. </p>
<p>Iraq rejected that final deadline.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> On 23 and 24 February, a massive coalition land operation began in Kuwait. </p>
<p>On the morning of 26 February, Saddam Hussein claimed in a broadcast that he had </p>
<p>ordered his forces to withdraw from Kuwait. The broadcast also claimed victory and </p>
<p>asserted Iraq’s continued claim on Kuwait. Coalition leaders responded by repeating </p>
<p>that Iraq must accept unconditionally all UN resolutions, release all prisoners of war </p>
<p>and detainees, and end the destruction of Kuwait. The coalition also made clear that </p>
<p>unarmed Iraqi soldiers would not be attacked but that, to ensure the safety of allied </p>
<p>troops, forces retreating with their weapons would continue to be treated as hostile. </p>
<p>Iraqi units moving north with their equipment were attacked from the air during the </p>
<p>night of 26/27 February.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> By the night of 27/28 February, Kuwait had been liberated. After consulting coalition </p>
<p>partners, President George HW Bush announced a suspension of hostilities, to take </p>
<p>effect from midnight on 27 February. As a result, a number of elite Iraqi fighting units </p>
<p>returned to Iraq intact.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> On 2 March, the Security Council adopted resolution 686 (1991). It affirmed that the </p>
<p>12 preceding resolutions, including the application of sanctions, continued to have effect, </p>
<p>and set out a number of demands including: acceptance of the preceding resolutions; </p>
<p>military conditions for the cessation of hostile activities; the release of all Kuwaiti and </p>
<p>“third-State nationals” detained by Iraq or the release of the remains of any deceased </p>
<p>personnel; the release of prisoners of war; and the payment of reparations. It stated that </p>
<p>the authority to use force in resolution 678 remained valid during the period required for </p>
<p>Iraq to comply with those demands. The meeting between coalition and Iraqi military </p>
<p>commanders to agree the military conditions for the cease-fire took place at Safwan, on </p>
<p>the Iraq-Kuwait border, the following day.</p>
<p><b>Resolution 687 (1991)</b></p>
<p><b>23. </b> Resolution 687 (1991) was adopted on 3 April, by 12 votes to one (Cuba); Ecuador </p>
<p>and Yemen abstained. Its preambular paragraphs:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recalled and affirmed the 13 previous Security Council resolutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>affirmed the commitment of all Member States to the sovereignty, territorial </p>
<p>integrity and political independence of Kuwait and Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recalled its objective of the establishment of a nuclear weapons-free zone in the </p>
<p>region of the Middle East;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reiterated its objective of restoring international peace and security in the area; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>set out the need to take the measures specified, acting under Chapter VII of the </p>
<p>UN Charter.</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The resolution’s operative paragraphs were divided into a number of separate parts. </p>
<p>Sections A, B, D, E and G all addressed various issues relating to Kuwait, including: </p>
<p>respect for the inviolability of the international boundary between Iraq and Kuwait, and </p>
<p>arrangements for its demarcation; arrangements to deter violations of the boundary </p>
<p>through a demilitarised zone; arrangements to facilitate the return of Kuwaiti property; </p>
<p>Iraq’s liability to Kuwait for financial reparations; and arrangements to facilitate the </p>
<p>repatriation of Kuwaiti and third-country nationals.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Section C of the resolution addressed Iraq’s possession and intentions in relation </p>
<p>to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and other weapons systems and programmes, </p>
<p>including the establishment of a Special Commission which became known as the </p>
<p>United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Section F of the resolution addressed sanctions, removing the prohibition on the </p>
<p>import into Iraq of foodstuffs provided they were notified to the Committee set up under </p>
<p>resolution 661 (subsequently known as the 661 Committee). The Committee was given </p>
<p>the power to approve the import of other items for essential civilian needs. That provision </p>
<p>was subject to review every 60 days in the light of the policies and practices of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, including the implementation of all relevant resolutions, for the purpose </p>
<p>of determining whether to reduce or lift the prohibitions. In certain circumstances, </p>
<p>the 661 Committee was also empowered to approve exceptions to the prohibitions on </p>
<p>exports from Iraq.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The resolution also affirmed the prohibition on the sale or supply of arms and related </p>
<p>materiel of all types, including both those prohibited by other provisions of the resolution </p>
<p>and conventional weapons and weapons technology; and called upon all States to </p>
<p>maintain national controls to ensure compliance with the prohibition.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Section H of the resolution required Iraq to inform the Security Council that it would </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>Legacy of the 1990-1991 Gulf Conflict</b></p>
<p>INTERNAL REPRESSION</p>
<p><b>31. </b> To maintain control in Iraq, Saddam Hussein used extreme brutality, wilfully violating </p>
<p>international human rights norms and covenants. Following Iraq’s expulsion from Kuwait, </p>
<p>his opponents inside Iraq mounted two separate, but parallel, attempts to overthrow </p>
<p>the regime.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> On 1 March 1991, demonstrations in Basra and Najaf developed into battles </p>
<p>between Shia fighters and Saddam Hussein’s security forces. Within days, the unrest </p>
<p>had spread to all the main Shia cities in southern Iraq. At the same time, Kurdish forces </p>
<p>saw an opportunity to seize control of northern Iraq and by 20 March they had captured </p>
<p>every city in the North, including Kirkuk. Saddam Hussein’s forces responded with brutal, </p>
<p>indiscriminate force, using helicopter gunships and artillery to crush the resistance. </p>
<p>Thousands of Shia and Kurdish citizens were killed and many more fled their homes, </p>
<p>particularly in the North, where they were caught in the mountains on the borders.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Initially, coalition states were reluctant to intervene for a number of reasons </p>
<p>including: inhibitions about interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and being </p>
<p>sucked into a civil war; concerns about the break-up of Iraq; and fears of a possible </p>
<p>revolutionary Shia government. But outrage at Saddam Hussein’s actions, and claims </p>
<p>that coalition rhetoric had encouraged the uprisings,</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> led to decisions to take action. </p>
<p>US commanders warned that they would shoot down any Iraqi aircraft flying over the </p>
<p>country; two Iraq Su-22 aircraft were subsequently shot down, one on 15 and one </p>
<p>on 22 March.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 5 April, the Security Council adopted resolution 688 (1991), which condemned </p>
<p>“the repression of the Iraqi civilian population in many parts of Iraq” and demanded </p>
<p>that “Iraq, as a contribution to removing the threat to international peace and security </p>
<p>in the region, immediately end this repression”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> It insisted that “Iraq allow immediate </p>
<p>access by international humanitarian organisations”; requested the Secretary-General </p>
<p>“to pursue his humanitarian efforts in Iraq”; and appealed to all Member States “to </p>
<p>contribute to these humanitarian relief efforts”.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> By early April, however, Saddam Hussein had already regained control. Iraq’s ruling </p>
<p>Revolutionary Command Council announced on 5 April “the complete crushing of acts </p>
<p>of sedition, sabotage, and rioting in all towns of Iraq”. Refugees were moving towards </p>
<p>the borders with Turkey and Iran and, because the border with Turkey was closed, their </p>
<p>position caused serious concern. On 6 April, the US-led Operation Provide Comfort </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>Dr Barham Salih, the Kurdistan Front spokesman in London, was reported in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> on </p>
<p>8 April saying that the Kurds felt a bitter sense of betrayal, having taken President Bush’s encouragement </p>
<p>of an Iraqi revolt literally. “I don’t know of any other interpretation … There was a clear statement that </p>
<p>Saddam ought to be removed and the Iraqi people will be supported.”</p>

<p>began to provide humanitarian relief to the Kurds and to help them return to northern </p>
<p>Iraq. The creation of a No-Fly Zone (NFZ) followed.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Iraq did not accept the provisions of resolution 688. A Memorandum of </p>
<p>Understanding (MOU) between the Government of Iraq and the UN, signed on 18 April, </p>
<p>permitted only a limited UN presence to provide humanitarian assistance and relief </p>
<p>for the “return and normalisation” of the lives of “displaced persons” in their place of </p>
<p>origin, “without prejudice to the sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence, </p>
<p>security and non-interference in the internal affairs” of Iraq.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> The MOU was to apply until </p>
<p>December 1991.</p>
<p>DIPLOMATIC ISOLATION</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Iraq was widely regarded as a disruptive force within the region. In his time in </p>
<p>power, Saddam Hussein had attacked Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel and Kuwait. Despite the </p>
<p>sanctions imposed by resolution 687 and the severe damage inflicted on Iraq’s armed </p>
<p>forces, the regime continued to be seen as hostile and potentially threatening by Kuwait </p>
<p>and some of Iraq’s other neighbours.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The boundary with Kuwait was demarcated by a UN Commission, and resolution 833 </p>
<p>(1993) affirmed that its decisions were final. On 15 October 1994, following Iraqi </p>
<p>military deployments towards Kuwait, resolution 949 (1994) noted past Iraqi threats </p>
<p>and instances of actual use of force against its neighbours; warned that any hostile or </p>
<p>provocative action against its neighbours constituted a threat to peace and security </p>
<p>in the region; and underlined that the Security Council would “consider Iraq fully </p>
<p>responsible for the serious consequences of any failure to fulfil the demands” in the </p>
<p>resolution, including that Iraq withdraw its forces and not take any other action to </p>
<p>enhance its military capacity in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> Iraq accepted the UN demarcation of the </p>
<p>border in a letter of 27 November 1994</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> but Iraq’s claim to the territory of Kuwait was </p>
<p>never resolved.</p>

<p><b>39. </b> The US and UK did not resume diplomatic relations with Iraq. Of the other </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>The strategy of containment</b></p>
<p><b>40. </b> The coalition had made a deliberate decision in 1991 not to pursue the overthrow of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein. Mr Baker stated in April 1991 that “the removal of Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was neither a political nor a military objective” of the US, and that:</p>
<p>“We are not prepared to go down the slippery slope of being sucked into a civil war </p>
<p>… We cannot police what goes on inside Iraq, and we cannot be the arbiters of </p>
<p>who governs Iraq. As President [George HW] Bush has repeatedly made clear, our </p>
<p>objective was the liberation of Kuwait. It never extended to the remaking of Iraq. </p>
<p>We repeatedly said that could only be done by the Iraqi people.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>41. </b> In a later interview, Mr Dick Cheney, the US Defense Secretary in 1991, said that </p>
<p>there had been concern about what to do with Iraqi soldiers who were “surrendering in </p>
<p>droves”; and that there was a limit to how long you could “continue the bloodshed without </p>
<p>having it look as though we were asking our troops to do something we probably shouldn’t </p>
<p>ask them to do”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> He added that, while some had argued that the coalition should have </p>
<p>continued to Baghdad, he thought that if they had done that “we would have been bogged </p>
<p>down there for a very long time with the real possibility we might not have succeeded”.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> From the end of the conflict, the objective of encouraging a change of regime in </p>
<p>Baghdad was an element of the policy debate in Washington. Mr Richard Haass, who </p>
<p>served in the administration of each President Bush, observed that the administrations </p>
<p>of President George HW Bush, President Bill Clinton and President George W Bush </p>
<p>“each contended with the question of how to balance containment with a desire for </p>
<p>regime change”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Saddam Hussein proved more intractable than was predicted. Throughout the 1990s </p>
<p>the UN Security Council frequently discussed Iraq and Saddam’s continued refusal </p>
<p>to accept all the obligations imposed. A total of 41 resolutions were passed between </p>
<p>resolution 687and December 2000. There were continuous efforts to contain the Iraqi </p>
<p>threat and put pressure on Iraq to disarm and to comply with the Security Council’s </p>
<p>requirements. Saddam Hussein’s objective was to break out from UN restrictions and, </p>
<p>by avoiding full compliance, to retain and rebuild Iraq’s military capabilities.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> In addition to diplomatic isolation, the strategy of “containment” had several </p>
<p>dimensions which developed in response to challenges posed by the Iraqi regime, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>NFZs covering the North and South of Iraq, patrolled by US, UK and  </p>
<p>(until 1996) French aircraft;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic sanctions;</p>

<p>a ban on the sale of arms to Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a naval force in the Gulf with powers to intercept ships suspected of breaching </p>
<p>sanctions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>military forces of the US, the UK and other allies stationed in neighbouring </p>
<p>countries as a deterrent; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>efforts to enforce the provisions set out in resolution 687 for the destruction of </p>
<p>Iraq’s chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes, and of its longer-</p>
<p>range missiles, under the supervision of UNSCOM inspectors.</p>
<p>Those elements are described in the following Sections.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts, FCO Director General Political 2001 to 2003, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>the purpose of the UK’s policy was “containment” of “Saddam Hussein’s ambitions to </p>
<p>redevelop weapons of mass destruction but also containment of the threat which Iraq </p>
<p>had posed to the region”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Sir Peter said that containment had three strands. The first was sanctions, where </p>
<p>the arms embargo was the most effective element and sanctions on Iraqi oil exports </p>
<p>and revenues were handled through the complex machinery of the Oil-for-Food </p>
<p>(OFF) programme run by the UN. The second strand he described as an “incentive” </p>
<p>strand based on resolution 1284 (1999), which had offered the Iraqis a deal whereby </p>
<p>sanctions would be suspended 120 days after the Iraqis accepted the return of weapons </p>
<p>inspectors to Iraq. The third strand was deterrence provided by the NFZs.</p>
<p>THE NORTHERN NO-FLY ZONE</p>
<p><b>47. </b> On 10 April 1991, an NFZ was established north of the 36th parallel, enforced by </p>
<p>US, UK and French aircraft based at Incirlik in Turkey. The UK contribution, Operation </p>
<p>HAVEN, also involved the deployment of 3 Commando Brigade into northern Iraq </p>
<p>until mid-July. In a statement to Parliament on 15 April, Mr Douglas Hurd, the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary, explained that the UK’s policy envisaged the creation of “temporary safe </p>
<p>havens in Iraq, in which UN officials can provide for the basic needs of refugees and </p>
<p>monitor their security until they can return to their homes in safety”.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> The aim was </p>
<p>“to create places and conditions in which refugees can feel secure … We support the </p>
<p>territorial integrity of Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>48. </b> On 7 June, relief operations were handed over to the United Nations High </p>
<p>Commission for Refugees and by mid-July almost all the 400,000 Kurdish refugees who </p>
<p>had fled into the mountains in the Iraq-Turkey border region had returned to their homes </p>
<p>or to the camps constructed for them by coalition forces.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On 24 July, Op Provide Comfort and Op HAVEN were replaced by Operation </p>
<p>Provide Comfort II, of which the UK contribution was Operation WARDEN. Its primary </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>aims were to prevent Saddam Hussein from attacking the Kurds from the air by </p>
<p>maintaining the NFZ, and to monitor whether he was complying with resolution 688. </p>
<p>There was also a limited humanitarian element to the mission, with the protection </p>
<p>of humanitarian convoys and continued distribution of supplies to Kurds and other </p>
<p>minorities in the region.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> In October 1995, the UN assumed full responsibility for the humanitarian elements </p>
<p>of the operations.</p>
<p>THE SOUTHERN NO-FLY ZONE</p>
<p><b>51. </b> In 1992, concern mounted about Saddam Hussein’s continued persecution of the </p>
<p>Shia in the South, including the draining of the Arab marshes and a forced resettlement </p>
<p>programme accompanied by a counter-insurgency campaign that included indiscriminate </p>
<p>attacks on villages by artillery, helicopter gunships and fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> On 11 August, the UN Special Rapporteur on Iraq set out his concerns directly to the </p>
<p>Security Council. Citing the need for a response to those concerns, US, UK and French </p>
<p>forces launched Operation Southern Watch on 27 August, imposing an “air-exclusion” </p>
<p>zone south of the 32nd parallel using aircraft based in Saudi Arabia. The UK contribution </p>
<p>was called Operation JURAL.</p>
<p>THE LEGAL BASIS FOR THE NO-FLY ZONES</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Resolution 688 condemned Iraq’s suppression of its own people, particularly the </p>
<p>Kurds, and demanded the immediate end to their repression. It also requested the </p>
<p>Secretary-General to provide humanitarian relief to the Iraqi people. But, unlike many </p>
<p>previous and subsequent resolutions on Iraq, resolution 688 was not made under </p>
<p>Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the only Chapter under which the use of force can be </p>
<p>authorised (see Box, ‘The Charter framework for the use of force’, earlier in this Section). </p>
<p>It did not explicitly authorise the coalition’s actions in patrolling Iraqi airspace to monitor </p>
<p>the NFZs. Nor did resolution 688 invite or authorise Member States to monitor its effect.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> A review by the then Attorney General of the legal basis for the NFZs was conducted </p>
<p>in November 1997.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The UK Government stated that, in enforcing NFZs, it was acting “in support” </p>
<p>of resolution 688. Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, said in April 2000 that UK </p>
<p>operations in the NFZs were:</p>
<p>“… essentially based on the overwhelming humanitarian necessity of protecting </p>
<p>people on the ground, combined with the need to monitor the effect of [resolution] </p>
<p>688; so it is the two taken in combination that provides the legal justification.” </p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Sir Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser from 1999 to 2006, told the Inquiry that the </p>
<p>legal basis on which the UK Government relied in establishing the NFZs:</p>
<p>“… was based upon an exceptional right to take action to avert an overwhelming </p>
<p>humanitarian catastrophe …</p>
<p>“The need to avert an extreme humanitarian catastrophe … is regarded by the </p>
<p>British Government as being derived from customary international law, and the </p>
<p>essence of it, I think, is that if something like the Holocaust were happening today, if </p>
<p>the Security Council were blocked, you couldn’t get an authorisation from it, then it </p>
<p>simply cannot be the law that States cannot take action to intervene in that kind of a </p>
<p>situation, an emergency of that scale.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Sir Michael also referred to the answer given by Baroness Symons to Parliament in </p>
<p>1998 in relation to Kosovo, which set out the Government’s position on the use of force </p>
<p>for humanitarian purposes:</p>
<p>“There is no general doctrine of humanitarian necessity in international law. Cases </p>
<p>have nevertheless arisen (as in northern Iraq in 1991) when, in the light of all the </p>
<p>circumstances, a limited use of force was justifiable in support of purposes laid </p>
<p>down by the Security Council but without the Council’s express authorisation when </p>
<p>that was the only means to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian </p>
<p>catastrophe. Such cases would in the nature of things be exceptional and would </p>
<p>depend on an objective assessment of the factual circumstances at the time </p>
<p>and on the terms of relevant decisions of the Security Council bearing on the </p>
<p>situation in question.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>58. </b> While enforcing the NFZs, coalition aircraft also collected tactical reconnaissance </p>
<p>information to help monitor Saddam Hussein’s compliance with resolution 688.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Op Provide Comfort II formally ended on 31 December 1996. France withdrew </p>
<p>from the enforcement of the northern NFZ, announcing that the humanitarian need had </p>
<p>subsided. On 1 January 1997, Operation Northern Watch began, enforced by UK and </p>
<p>US aircraft.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Following an attack on 19 September 1996 on Iraqi air defence missile sites north </p>
<p>of the 32nd parallel which had targeted coalition aircraft, the US and the UK moved the </p>
<p>boundary of the southern NFZ north to the 33rd parallel. From that date, French aircraft </p>
<p>participated only in patrols up to the 32nd parallel. France withdrew its support for the </p>
<p>operation in the wake of Operation Desert Fox, in December 1998, although it continued </p>
<p>to station aircraft in Saudi Arabia.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>62. </b> On a number of occasions, UK and US aircraft enforcing the NFZs targeted Iraqi </p>
<p>military assets. The legal basis for those attacks derived from the right to self-defence. </p>
<p>The MOD paper on NFZs states:</p>
<p>“… it remained the UK’s position that it was engaged in a lawful activity in monitoring </p>
<p>the NFZs and if coalition forces were attacked or under imminent threat of attack, </p>
<p>they were entitled to defend themselves. So UK forces participating in the No </p>
<p>Fly Zones were permitted to attack targets which were or contributed to actual or </p>
<p>imminent threat of attack. This was based on the inherent right of self-defence.”</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Activity in the NFZs increased over time and, in response to the threat from Iraq, </p>
<p>eventually extended to attacks on Iraqi air defence sites outside the Zones. Incidents </p>
<p>increased significantly after Operation Desert Fox. Concerns about the continued legality </p>
<p>of the NFZs in 2000 and 2001 are addressed in Section 1.2.</p>
<p>ARMS EMBARGO</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Resolution 687 confirmed the prohibition on the sale or supply to Iraq of arms </p>
<p>and related materiel of all types, and called on all States to maintain national controls </p>
<p>to ensure compliance. In his statement on 15 April 1991, Mr Hurd recorded that </p>
<p>the UK’s proposal was for “a strict arms embargo against Iraq to remain in force as </p>
<p>long as Saddam Hussein is in power”.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> The principle of the embargo was relatively </p>
<p>uncontroversial, but the control of items which had “dual use” (a civilian as well as a </p>
<p>military use) did create difficulties. Various arrangements were made, including resolution </p>
<p>1051 (1996) adopted on 27 March 1996; but there were increasing disagreements.</p>
<p>ECONOMIC SANCTIONS</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Resolution 687 provided the framework for the economic sanctions imposed on </p>
<p>Iraq. It permitted the import of medicines, of food and of other supplies for essential </p>
<p>civilian needs. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> By the summer of 1991, concern about the “nutritional and health situation” of </p>
<p>the Iraqi civilian population and the risk of a further deterioration led to the adoption </p>
<p>of resolution 706 (1991) on 15 August. Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, it </p>
<p>authorised States to permit the import of Iraqi petroleum and petroleum products, for an </p>
<p>initial period of six months, up to a defined limit of US$1.6bn. Payment for the purchases </p>
<p>would be held in an escrow account to be established by the UN Secretary-General </p>
<p>“exclusively to meet the purposes” of resolution 706. They were: the full cost of the </p>
<p>UN carrying out the tasks authorised by section C of resolution 687 (inspections and </p>
<p>monitoring) and facilitating the return of all Kurdish property seized by Iraq; half the </p>
<p>costs of the Iraq-Kuwait Boundary Demarcation Commission; the purchase of foodstuffs, </p>
<p>medicines and materials and supplies for essential civilian needs; and the costs of </p>
<p>implementing resolution 706 and other necessary humanitarian activity in Iraq.</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>67. </b> The resolution asked the UN Secretary-General to produce a scheme, which </p>
<p>became known as the “Oil-for-Food” programme, to cover those purchases, and </p>
<p>to monitor and supervise their equitable distribution to “all regions of Iraq” and “all </p>
<p>categories of the Iraqi civilian population”. The Secretary-General’s report was submitted </p>
<p>on 4 September, and implementation was authorised by resolution 712 (1991) adopted </p>
<p>on 19 September.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> Iraq rejected both resolutions and refused to co-operate on the grounds that the </p>
<p>arrangements were an infringement of Iraq sovereignty. Resolution 778 (1992), adopted </p>
<p>on 2 October 1992, deplored Iraq’s position “which puts its civilian population at risk” </p>
<p>and decided that any Iraqi funds arising from the proceeds of sale of Iraqi petroleum </p>
<p>or petroleum products should be transferred by Member States to the UN escrow </p>
<p>account. States were also to arrange to sell or purchase any petroleum or petroleum </p>
<p>products owned by Iraq and transfer the proceeds to the escrow account; to contribute </p>
<p>funds from other sources as soon as possible. The resolution stated that no further </p>
<p>Iraqi assets should be released for the purchase of food stuffs, medicines and other </p>
<p>essential supplies except to the escrow account or directly to the UN for humanitarian </p>
<p>activities in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> By late 1993, differences had emerged within the Security Council over the </p>
<p>conditions for lifting sanctions. The US and UK took the view that sanctions could only </p>
<p>be lifted following Iraq’s full compliance with its obligations as set out in UN resolutions. </p>
<p>China, France and Russia believed that a timetable for the gradual lifting of sanctions </p>
<p>should be put in place as Iraq complied with UN demands.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> As a result of Iraq’s objections, the UN adopted resolution 986 (1995) on 14 April </p>
<p>1995. It directed the committee established by resolution 661 to monitor the sale of </p>
<p>petroleum and petroleum products exported by Iraq, with the assistance of independent </p>
<p>inspection agents appointed by the UN Secretary-General; and to verify that the </p>
<p>purchase price was “reasonable in the light of prevailing market conditions”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> A separate </p>
<p>escrow account was established to finance the export to Iraq of material covered by </p>
<p>the resolution. In the exceptional circumstances in northern Iraq, and to ensure an </p>
<p>equitable distribution, the UN Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme operating in </p>
<p>the Governorates of Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah would disburse a share of the </p>
<p>fund. The fund was to be audited by “independent and certified public accountants”. </p>
<p>The UN Secretary-General was to keep the Government of Iraq “fully informed”.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Iraq eventually accepted resolution 986 in May 1996, when a Memorandum of </p>
<p>Understanding was agreed. Following the Iraqi offensive against the Kurds in August, </p>
<p>implementation was suspended until December. The first shipment of food arrived in </p>
<p>March 1997 and the first shipment of medicines in May 1997.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Resolution 1153 (1998), adopted on 20 February 1998, increased the amount of oil </p>
<p>Iraq could sell from US$2bn every six months to US$5.2bn. The resolution requested the </p>
<p>establishment of a group of experts to determine, with the Government of Iraq, “whether </p>
<p>Iraq is able to export petroleum or petroleum products sufficient to produce” the funds </p>
<p>identified in the resolution as necessary to meet Iraq’s needs.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> They reported in April </p>
<p>that it could not, leading to authorisation of the import of oil industry spare parts and </p>
<p>equipment in resolution 1175 (1998) on 19 June.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Resolution 1153 also recorded the UN Secretary-General’s observation that </p>
<p>the situation in the electricity sector in Iraq was extremely grave. It asked him, in </p>
<p>consultation with the Government of Iraq, to submit a report on essential humanitarian </p>
<p>needs, “including necessary improvements to infrastructure”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> As a result of Iraq’s decision to suspend co-operation with UNSCOM and the </p>
<p>IAEA and resolution 1194 condemning Iraq’s decision, the six-monthly UN reviews </p>
<p>of sanctions were suspended. As an incentive, Iraq was offered the prospect of a </p>
<p>comprehensive review of Iraqi compliance if co-operation was resumed. Iraq declined.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> The Oil-for-Food programme continued to operate, with resolutions renewing the </p>
<p>arrangements every six months, until 2003. It helped to alleviate the humanitarian </p>
<p>position in Iraq, but there was concern, within the UN and elsewhere, about the impact </p>
<p>of sanctions. As well as the humanitarian impact, there were reports of increased </p>
<p>corruption in Iraq, misuse of Oil-for-Food, and increased oil smuggling which was </p>
<p>benefiting Saddam Hussein’s regime. These concerns led to questions about the </p>
<p>sustainability of the policy, which are addressed in Section 1.2.</p>
<p>ENFORCEMENT AT SEA</p>
<p><b>76. </b> There had been a Royal Navy (RN) presence in the Gulf region since the early </p>
<p>1980s, when the Armilla patrol was deployed to defend UK vessels caught in the </p>
<p>crossfire of the Iran-Iraq War. After the 1991 Gulf Conflict, a RN frigate or destroyer was </p>
<p>permanently deployed in the Gulf as part of a US-led naval force to support the UN arms </p>
<p>embargo and controls on the export of oil through the Gulf. It had powers to intercept </p>
<p>ships suspected of breaching UN resolutions.</p>
<p>DETERRENCE BY FORCES STATIONED IN THE REGION</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Concerns about the risk of Saddam Hussein attacking neighbouring countries, </p>
<p>particularly Kuwait, remained. Mr Simon Webb, MOD Policy Director from July 2001 to </p>
<p>October 2004, told the Inquiry that the deterrent effect of aircraft enforcing the NFZ in </p>
<p>southern Iraq was a “side benefit of risk reduction”: it was an alternative to stationing </p>
<p>significant ground forces in Kuwait because it enabled the US and UK to know what </p>
<p>the military situation was in Iraq. If an Iraqi military build-up was detected it would </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The US and other allies had forces stationed in countries in the region, in particular </p>
<p>Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Turkey, which could respond at short notice, </p>
<p>should a threat emerge.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Following Iraq’s deployment of 80,000 troops towards the border with Kuwait in </p>
<p>October 1994, the US and UK rapidly deployed forces to Kuwait. The Security Council </p>
<p>adopted resolution 949 (1994), and Iraqi forces withdrew north of the 32nd parallel. </p>
<p>The US increased its military personnel based in Saudi Arabia from under 1,000 to </p>
<p>around 7,000.</p>
<p><b>Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction</b></p>
<p><b>Assessments of Iraq’s WMD capability before the Gulf Conflict</b></p>
<p><b>79. </b> The term “weapons of mass destruction” originated as an umbrella concept </p>
<p>covering weapons with the capability to cause indiscriminate loss of life and wide-scale </p>
<p>destruction.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> All nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are frequently characterised </p>
<p>as weapons of mass destruction, and radiological devices have been included </p>
<p>more recently.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> During the 1970s and 1980s, Iraq had active chemical, biological, nuclear, and </p>
<p>missile programmes. It used chemical weapons against Iranian forces during the </p>
<p>Iran-Iraq War and against Iraqi Kurds in Halabja in March 1988.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> After 1998, Iraq continued to develop its military capability, including programmes </p>
<p>to develop chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and the means for their delivery </p>
<p>including ballistic missiles.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> Some Western firms were implicated in supplying material to Iraq, as Lord Justice </p>
<p>Scott set out in the <i>Report of the Inquiry into the Export of Defence Equipment and Dual-</i></p>
<p><i>Use Goods to Iraq and Related Prosecutions</i> published in 1996.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> In March 1990, an attempt to smuggle nuclear-weapons-related components was </p>
<p>discovered at Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>21 </p>
<p>Public hearing, 24 November 2009, pages 49-50.</p>
<p>22 </p>
<p>The first official definition was provided by the UN Commission for Conventional Armaments in </p>
<p>1948 which defined weapons of mass destruction as “atomic explosive devices, radioactive material </p>
<p>weapons, lethal chemical and biological weapons, and any weapons developed in the future which have </p>
<p>characteristics comparable in destructive effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned </p>
<p>above” (S/C.3/32/Rev.1, August 1948). This definition has been used in successive UN resolutions dealing </p>
<p>with disarmament.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>84. </b> The Butler Report stated:</p>
<p>“In the late 1970s, Iraq obtained large quantities of uranium ore from Niger, Portugal </p>
<p>and Brazil. By the mid-1980s, however, Iraq had become self-sufficient in uranium </p>
<p>ore, which was a by-product of indigenous phosphate mines … which extracted and </p>
<p>purified the uranium ore for subsequent use in nuclear enrichment processes.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>85. </b> After the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) </p>
<p>issued a number of Assessments about Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and its intentions.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The role and responsibilities of the JIC for providing Ministers and senior officials </p>
<p>with regular intelligence Assessments on a range of issues of immediate and long-term </p>
<p>importance to national interests, primarily in the fields of security, defence and foreign </p>
<p>affairs are set out in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The JIC assessed Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in September 1990 and judged that, </p>
<p>without “significant external assistance”, it would take Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“at least three years to establish a production facility for fissile material;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one more year before sufficient weapons-grade material would be available for </p>
<p>the production of one nuclear device; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a further year or more (ie 1995 at the earliest) before there would be enough </p>
<p>material for a small stockpile of 3-4 weapons.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>88. </b> The JIC’s Assessment was based on an assumption that Iraq was “using only a </p>
<p>centrifuge route” for enriching fissile material which was “later shown to be incorrect”.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> The JIC also examined, “on the basis of intelligence”, the possibility that Iraq might </p>
<p>have authorised a “crash programme” to produce an untested nuclear device.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> That would have required Iraq to divert nuclear material stored at civil sites in breach </p>
<p>of IAEA safeguards, to have recovered unburnt uranium from reactor fuel and to have </p>
<p>advanced work on firing systems and high explosive parts to the stage where they could </p>
<p>be incorporated into a nuclear device.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The JIC noted that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If and only if all of these conditions were met … it is conceivable that Iraq could </p>
<p>have the capability to make an untested nuclear weapon … with a yield of </p>
<p>approximately 20 kilotonnes by the end of this year.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might have authorised a development project on those lines </p>
<p>but its conclusion remained that “the technical difficulties would be so great as  </p>
<p>to be virtually insurmountable in the short time available”.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> An IAEA inspection of Iraq’s civil nuclear programme on 22 November 1990 showed </p>
<p>that no fissile material had been diverted.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> In December 1990, the JIC dismissed the option of an outside supplier providing </p>
<p>the necessary material or a complete weapon on the grounds that only a few countries </p>
<p>might have the motivation to supply the necessary material or weapons, and the JIC did </p>
<p>not consider such supply likely.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> A JIC Assessment of 20 September 1990, which cautioned that there were </p>
<p>“considerable uncertainties about Iraq’s current ballistic missile capability and </p>
<p>deployments”, estimated that Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had a stockpile of “about 700” ballistic missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>could have “about 300 SCUD-B” short range (300km) missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“may have converted some 250 SCUD-B missiles to the longer range [650km] </p>
<p>Al Hussein variant”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>could have “up to 150” (900km) Al Abbas missiles.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The Butler Report found that a single intelligence report, received in November </p>
<p>1990, had had a significant impact on the JIC’s Assessments of Iraq’s biological and </p>
<p>chemical weapons capabilities.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>96. </b> On 9 November 1990, the JIC reported:</p>
<p>“According to the new intelligence, Iraq possesses the BW agents pneumonic </p>
<p>plague and anthrax and has weaponised them … Weapons are available for </p>
<p>immediate use …</p>
<p>“The report that Iraq has weaponised anthrax is consistent with our earlier </p>
<p>assessment that it might have done so. But we have no collateral for the claim that </p>
<p>it has developed plague to a similar extent. Plague was, however, one of the agents </p>
<p>included in the list of those that Iraq had studied or on which it had information </p>
<p>… We believe that Iraq has the facilities to produce plague in sufficient quantities </p>
<p>for weaponisation.”</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Later that November, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) said that plague </p>
<p>seedstock was now probably available to Iraq.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>98. </b> The JIC and DIS judgements on plague were “based on several intelligence reports </p>
<p>from a single informant described as ‘<i>a new source of unestablished reliability</i>’” and who </p>
<p>was “felt to be in a position to comment authoritatively”.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The Butler Report observed that, in relation to Iraq’s chemical warfare capability, </p>
<p>the report:</p>
<p>“… added new detail to the JIC’s existing body of knowledge covering the types of </p>
<p>chemical agents held in the Iraqi stockpile; the capabilities of those agents; their </p>
<p>weaponisation into free-fall bombs; the availability of suitable ballistic missiles for the </p>
<p>delivery of particular agents; and the volumes of each type of agent, and hence of </p>
<p>the total chemical agent stockpile.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>100. </b> On the basis of that report, the JIC “briefly” put “Iraq’s total chemical agent stocks in </p>
<p>the range 15,000-22,000 tonnes”.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> A JIC Assessment before military action against Iraq in 1991, intended “to provide </p>
<p>military commanders with an indication of the possible scale of Iraq’s use of chemical </p>
<p>weapons, and of how long such use could be sustained”, subsequently reduced the </p>
<p>estimate of the size of the stockpile, to between 6,000-10,000 tonnes of agent.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>102. </b> The enduring effect of that Assessment is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Iraq fired 86 of its SCUD missiles during the 1991 conflict, 40 against Israel, </p>
<p>44 against Saudi Arabia and two in the direction of Bahrain and Qatar.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> No Al Abbas </p>
<p>missiles were fired.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Based on its Assessment in September 1990, the JIC concluded on 17 April 1991 </p>
<p>that Iraq might have up to 600 ballistic missiles left, “both standard SCUD and extended </p>
<p>range variants”, but the figure was “probably less”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The Butler Report commented that JIC Assessments of Iraq’s chemical warfare </p>
<p>and ballistic missile programmes before military action in 1991 were “done on what was </p>
<p>effectively a worst case basis”, but that was not made explicitly clear.</p>

<p><b>Provisions of resolution 687</b></p>
<p><b>108. </b> Resolution 687, adopted on 3 April 1991, addressed Iraq’s obligations under </p>
<p>international law in relation to the possession and use of chemical, biological and </p>
<p>nuclear weapons.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> The resolution stated that the Security Council was:</p>
<p>“Conscious … of the statements by Iraq threatening to use weapons in violation of </p>
<p>its obligations under the Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of </p>
<p>Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases, and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare </p>
<p>signed at Geneva on 17 June 1925, and of its prior use of chemical weapons and </p>

<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The estimate was based on two years’ production at full capacity since the end of </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the estimate was carried forward into subsequent Assessments but, after May </p>
<p>1991, the Assessments did not make clear the basis of the estimate.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> The Report continued:</p>
<p>“There will inevitably have been a risk that that estimate, shorn of its assumptions, </p>
<p>may have become the ‘prevailing wisdom’, with subsequent Iraqi declarations being </p>

<p>sparse. If so, that process would have tended to lead to deductions by analysts </p>
<p>and policy-makers that there were shortfalls in Iraqi declarations. Furthermore, </p>
<p>suspicions here will have been exacerbated by Iraqi prevarication, concealment </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>The discovery of Iraq’s nuclear programme</b></p>
<p><b>132. </b> Following IAEA inspections in May and June 1991, and a meeting in </p>
<p>Baghdad, Mr Ahmed Hussein, Iraq’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, wrote to the </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General on 7 July stating that Iraq had “decided that it would be </p>
<p>appropriate to give an account” of its “peaceful nuclear programme”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>133. </b> In an “overview” attached to the letter, Iraq stated that the programme had </p>
<p>begun in 1956, after the US had announced that it was launching a peaceful nuclear </p>
<p>programme, and it had been implemented in three stages:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Collaboration with some Western countries and then the Soviet Union with </p>
<p>the objective of building a “research reactor and laboratories for producing </p>
<p>radioactive isotopes for medical and industrial applications”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Accession to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and related system of safeguards </p>
<p>followed by “agreements with France, Italy and other countries” in relation to the </p>
<p>nuclear fuel cycle allowed Iraq to achieve:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>experimental laboratories producing nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>research laboratories for processing spent nuclear fuel;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the nuclear power plant programme;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>uranium extraction from phosphate ores; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the establishment of the Tammuz 1</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> reactor and related facilities and </p>
<p>equipment, which Israel had destroyed on 7 June 1981.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As a result of the inability of international guarantees and bilateral agreements to </p>
<p>protect facilities and personnel from aggression, it had been “necessary to adopt </p>
<p>new formulas … to acquire the relevant nuclear know-how … of the nuclear fuel </p>
<p>cycle, through self-reliance and the non-disclosure of information.”</p>
<p><b>134. </b> Iraq admitted that in the third stage it had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extracted uranium from carbonate ores;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>purified and converted uranium-bearing compounds;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enriched uranium isotopes using the electromagnetic method;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enriched uranium isotopes using the centrifugal method; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enriched isotopes by chemical methods.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Iraq stated that the US had bombed its declared nuclear facilities and reactors </p>
<p>whilst they were in operation and that was “equivalent to a nuclear attack” which had </p>
<p>endangered the population and the environment.</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Iraq also provided detailed tables of its equipment and activities, which stated </p>
<p>that it had produced half a kilogram of uranium 235 enriched to 4 percent through the </p>
<p>electromagnetic process and the production of an “unappreciable” quantity of uranium </p>
<p>enriched through a centrifuge process, and identifying those that had been damaged </p>
<p>or destroyed.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Mr Hussein stated that “careful examination” of the details provided would enable </p>
<p>the UN Secretary-General to conclude that the programme did “not entail any departure </p>
<p>from, or violation of” the NPT and the IAEA safeguards agreement, which had been </p>
<p>“constantly observed”.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Mr Hussein added that Iraq had been “induced to refrain from declaring some of </p>
<p>the stages of the programme though this was not in any way inconsistent with either the </p>
<p>Treaty or the agreement” because of a fear of “exaggeration, abuse and aggression”. </p>
<p>Iraq therefore believed it was “best to abstain from overt reference to nuclear technology </p>
<p>so that such reference might not be taken as a threat to the security of States or be used </p>
<p>to hinder the propagation of the peaceful uses of such technology”.</p>
<p><b>139. </b> The decision to provide details of the nuclear programme was the result of two </p>
<p>factors. First, the “comprehensive destruction” of the programme, and second, “Iraq’s </p>
<p>decision to destroy anything which might possibly be interpreted as incompatible” </p>
<p>with resolution 687. The UN had “chosen to consider the destruction carried out by </p>
<p>Iraq, without prior notification and without your participation, as inconsistent with the </p>
<p>requirements for the implementation” of resolution 687.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Hussein stated that he wished to reaffirm Iraq’s “fear of exaggeration and </p>
<p>deliberate alarmism in various fields, particularly the nuclear field”. This had caused </p>
<p>President George HW Bush:</p>
<p>“… to declare in November 1990 that Iraq would produce a nuclear weapon within </p>
<p>two months and that he was accordingly obliged to expedite launching the war </p>
<p>and destroying Iraq’s nuclear capabilities before Iraq could take advantage of </p>
<p>that opportunity.”</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Mr Hussein wrote:</p>
<p>“… this alone was sufficient reason for a decision to proceed with destruction.”</p>
<p><b>142. </b> The second reason for Iraq’s actions was the decision to make Iraq pay the costs </p>
<p>of implementing resolution 687. Iraq had “hastened its decision on destruction before </p>
<p>receiving interminable lists of equipment to be destroyed”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>143. </b> In an exchange of correspondence with Dr Blix, which followed Iraq’s admission, </p>
<p>the IAEA disputed Iraq’s view that it had not violated its obligations.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Iraq continued to contest the IAEA view.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> It stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Research activities had not reached the stage which required notification.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The amount of enriched uranium produced was far less that the defined </p>
<p>threshold for notification of 75 kilogrammes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had experimented on only a “single centrifuge prototype, and not a successive </p>
<p>chain”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The three enrichment methods were in the early stages of development and did </p>
<p>not mean the existence of an installation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was not required to report holdings of yellowcake and uranium dioxide </p>
<p>which were being used for non-nuclear purposes, including reinforcing anti-tank </p>
<p>warheads.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IAEA inspectors had had access to stores of such material alongside material </p>
<p>they were verifying and had pointed out that yellowcake was not subject to </p>
<p>inspection.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> On 11 July, the JIC addressed Iraq’s nuclear activities.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>146. </b> The JIC reported that, on the basis of post-war intelligence, it now knew that:</p>
<p>“… in the 1980s Iraq investigated four methods of uranium enrichment, including the </p>
<p>use of centrifuges. But the route that had made most progress was electromagnetic </p>
<p>isotope separation (EMIS).”</p>
<p><b>147. </b> The JIC noted there was intelligence that “enough fissile material had been </p>
<p>produced before the coalition air attacks to produce one nuclear device”; but it </p>
<p>concluded that, whilst the intelligence was generally credible, it did not believe that Iraq </p>
<p>could have obtained enough fissile material for a bomb through the route described in </p>
<p>the intelligence. The JIC added:</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, given our lack of intelligence about the Iraqi nuclear programme, we </p>
<p>cannot exclude the possibility that Iraq might have produced more fissile material </p>
<p>than we have previously believed.”</p>

<p>59</p>
<p><b>149. </b> The resolution also condemned Iraq’s “non-compliance” with its obligations </p>
<p>under its safeguards agreement with the IAEA, which constituted a “violation of its </p>

<p><b>150. </b> The demands in the resolution included that Iraq should:</p>

<p>“On the basis of the evidence so far of the programme’s progress before Desert </p>

<p>interrupted by the war.”</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>156. </b> That was two years earlier than had been assessed before the 1990-1991 conflict. </p>
<p>The unexpected discoveries had a significant impact on subsequent JIC Assessments, </p>
<p>which tended to look at Iraq’s potential capability on a “worst case” basis.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> By the end of 1992, the processes of transporting Iraq’s fissionable material to </p>
<p>Russia and of the IAEA supervising the destruction of many large installations that had </p>
<p>been used in Iraq’s weapons programme was mostly complete.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>Concealment of WMD activities</b></p>
<p><b>158. </b> Iraq’s actions to conceal the scale and details of its activity, including the unilateral </p>
<p>destruction of prohibited weapons and material, created major problems for UNSCOM in </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Although we do not know the true figure, we assess that around 100 SCUD-B </p>

<p>There might be “as many as 250 complete Soviet build SCUD-B guidance </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>168. </b> Although there were doubts about whether Iraq had revealed the full extent of its </p>
<p>activities, the JIC was more sanguine in September 1994 about the size and value of </p>
<p>Iraq’s chemical and biological agent stockpiles.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> After 1992, UNSCOM “continued to have concerns that not all proscribed items </p>
<p>had been disclosed”.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>170. </b> In January 1993, there were two incidents involving Iraqi incursions into the </p>
<p>demilitarised zone between Iraq and Kuwait. On 8 and 11 January, two Presidential </p>
<p>Statements were issued, declaring that Iraq’s actions constituted unacceptable and </p>
<p>material breaches of relevant provisions of resolution 687.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> Again, Iraq was warned that </p>
<p>“serious consequences” would flow from such continued defiance. The status and legal </p>
<p>significance of Presidential Statements is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> On 13, 17 and 18 January, the US, UK and France carried out air and missile </p>
<p>strikes against Iraqi targets. Mr Ralph Zacklin, Assistant Secretary-General for Legal </p>
<p>Affairs at the United Nations from 1998 to 2005, subsequently wrote:</p>
<p>“The legitimacy of this limited resumption of the use of force was borne out by the </p>
<p>fact that there was a marked absence of protest on the part of Member States even </p>
<p>when the air strikes continued for a third wave. By issuing repeated warnings to Iraq </p>
<p>in the form of Presidential Statements which conveyed the sense of the Security </p>
<p>Council as a collective organ, the Council had clearly signified its agreement to the </p>
<p>course of action which had been taken.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>172. </b> In April, an Iraqi plot to assassinate former US President George HW Bush during </p>

<p>55</p>
<p><b>173. </b> On 25 August, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq has admitted to the UN that it conducted research into BW agents from 1986 </p>
<p>to 1990, but claims never to have produced agent in quantity nor to have possessed </p>
<p>biological weapons. We have information that this claim is untrue and assess that </p>
<p>Iraq produced BW weapons containing anthrax and plague … Stocks of agents and </p>
<p>weapons have probably been hidden, together with key items of equipment.”</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Commenting on the judgement that Iraq had produced plague, the Butler </p>
<p>Report recorded that, after the Gulf Conflict, two further sources had provided “some </p>
<p>apparently corroborative intelligence” that Iraq had produced plague. There were some </p>
<p>inconsistencies between the knowledge of one of those sources and the source who had </p>
<p>provided information in November 1990, which “could have led to questioning of their </p>
<p>access”.</p>
<p><b>175. </b> By November, there was renewed progress when Iraq accepted resolution 715, </p>
<p>and permitted the deployment of OMV systems to ensure former weapons sites were not </p>
<p>reactivated.</p>
<p><b>176. </b> By May 1994, UNSCOM had supervised the destruction of “480,000 litres of live </p>
<p>chemical agent, 28,000 chemical munitions and approximately 1.8 million litres, and over </p>
<p>1 million kilograms of some 45 different precursor chemicals”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>177. </b> A JIC Assessment of 8 September noted that it did “not believe the full extent of the </p>
<p>CW programme” had been revealed:</p>
<p>“Although UNSCOM has destroyed the large declared stocks of CW agents, </p>
<p>precursors and weapons, Iraq may have retained a secret stockpile but we have </p>
<p>no direct evidence. Hidden stockpiles are probably unnecessary as the Iraqi civil </p>
<p>chemical industry can produce all the precursors needed to make mustard agent </p>
<p>and most of those for nerve agents.”</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>178. </b> In OP22 of resolution 687, the Security Council had decided that, upon approval by </p>
<p>the Security Council of the programme called for in OP19 (which would establish a fund </p>
<p>to pay compensation for damage caused by Iraq’s invasion and occupation of Kuwait) </p>
<p>and “Council agreement that Iraq has completed all actions contemplated” in OPs 8-13, </p>
<p>the sanctions imposed by resolution 661 should “have no further force or effect”.</p>

<p>adopted resolution 949 (1994) on 15 October 1994, which condemned “deployments </p>

<p>by Iraq in the direction of the border with Kuwait”.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> It included a demand that Iraq </p>
<p>“co-operate fully with the United Nations Special Commission”.</p>
<p><b>180. </b>  In autumn 1994, UNSCOM conducted a thorough review of Iraq’s biological </p>
<p>weapons programme, including “an attempt to create a material balance of equipment </p>
<p>and … growth media acquired by Iraq”.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> The review “reinforced the suspicion that the </p>
<p>Al Hakam factory was a biological warfare agent production facility and that other sites </p>
<p>were also involved in the biological weapons programme”.</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Inspections and interviews had:</p>
<p>“… enabled the Commission to arrive at a firm assessment that Iraq’s declarations </p>
<p>in the biological area at that time were fundamentally wrong and misleading as </p>
<p>it was attempting to hide a full-scale biological warfare programme, including </p>
<p>weaponization. The Commission came to the unequivocal conclusion that Iraq had </p>
<p>in fact produced biological weapons, that its biological programme was offensive </p>
<p>in nature, that Al Hakam had been constructed as a dedicated biological warfare </p>
<p>agent research and production facility and had been operational before January </p>
<p>1991, and that additional sites, including al-Muthanna, a known chemical weapons </p>
<p>establishment were involved in the programme.”</p>
<p><b>182. </b> UNSCOM “confronted” Iraq with its assessments in February 1995.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Iraq admitted in December that it received proscribed SCUD missile gyroscope </p>
<p>components in 1991 and a shipment of proscribed advanced missile gyroscopes was </p>
<p>intercepted in 1995.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Haass wrote in his memoir that, during the Clinton Administration, there was:</p>
<p>“… a range of efforts that sought to promote regime change, something that got </p>
<p>the CIA and the Clinton administration enmeshed in a disastrous attempt to oust </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein by covert means. The coup was uncovered and crushed in March </p>
<p>1995. There was as well a parallel overt initiative to strengthen the Iraqi opposition </p>
<p>that lived outside Iraq …”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>185. </b> In April 1995, the Security Council was advised that the Special Commission </p>
<p>assessed that Iraq had “obtained or sought to obtain all the items and materials required </p>

<p>82</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Mr Ekéus told the Inquiry that he was able to make that report as a result of the </p>
<p>work of UNSCOM scientists, including Dr David Kelly.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>187. </b> On 1 July 1995, as part of a further “full, final, and complete disclosure (FFCD)” of </p>

<p>but not to its weaponisation.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>188. </b> In July 1995, dual-use items were rendered harmless or destroyed, “under strong </p>

<p>specifically procured for and used in proscribed activities.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Ekéus told the Inquiry that, in 1995, Mr Aziz had asked him to approach </p>
<p>Mr Tony Lake, US National Security Advisor, to offer, on Mr Aziz’s behalf, “high quality </p>
<p>information about activity and planning inside terrorist networks” in exchange for an </p>

<p>Kamil, the former Minister of Industry and Head of Iraq’s Military Industrialisation </p>
<p>Corporation defected to Jordan. He had been responsible for the development and </p>
<p>manufacture of Iraq’s proscribed weapons programmes.</p>

<p>and an interpreter in Amman.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> Lt Gen Kamil said that, after inspections had started, </p>
<p>Iraq had destroyed its biological weapons and he himself had ordered the destruction of </p>
<p>Iraq’s chemical weapons. In addition, all Iraq’s SCUD missiles and their components had </p>
<p>been destroyed, although two launchers had been dismantled and hidden. Lt Gen Kamil </p>

<p>“He also exposed an organised Iraqi campaign of deception directed from the top </p>

<p><b>193. </b> In the aftermath of Lt Gen Kamil’s departure, Iraq admitted that its disclosures had </p>
<p>been “deliberately misleading” and released a large amount of information which had </p>
<p>both “confirmed” many of UNSCOM’s earlier observations and “brought to light earlier </p>
<p>unknown documents of significance”.</p>

<p>been provided by a junior military engineer, but “the Commission was convinced that </p>
<p>certain of the most important documentation had not yet been handed over”.</p>
<p><b>196. </b> UNSCOM concluded that the documents disclosed by Iraq in August 1995 </p>
<p>showed that Iraq’s chemical weapons programme was more developed and wider in </p>

<p>91</p>
<p> Iraq had “used chemical weapons facilities </p>
<p>to support other weapons of mass destruction programmes”, including “production of </p>
<p>casings for radiological bombs, activities for the uranium chemical enrichment process </p>
<p>and major support for the biological weapons programme”. They had also provided </p>
<p>evidence of “much greater foreign involvement in Iraq’s chemical weapons programme”. </p>
<p>Production records had been provided for only seven months in 1988, not for all </p>

<p><b>197. </b> In an Assessment issued on 24 August, the JIC reassessed Iraq’s capabilities </p>
<p>in the light of the new information.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>198. </b> In relation to Iraq’s nuclear programme, the JIC noted that Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… admits that it previously concealed the full extent of its nuclear programme.  </p>
<p>It has revealed that in August 1990 it began a crash programme, later </p>
<p>abandoned, to build a nuclear programme within a year”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… intended to use nuclear material held under IAEA safeguards in Iraq. The </p>
<p>Iraqis claim the plan was abandoned because they concluded that the IAEA </p>
<p>would detect their activities. In fact, they had insufficient fissile material to make </p>
<p>a nuclear device. Hussein Kamil’s reported claim that, at the time of the Gulf </p>
<p>Conflict, Iraq was only three months from completing a nuclear weapon probably </p>
<p>refers to the ‘crash programme’. It is very unlikely to be true.”</p>
<p><b>199. </b> In relation to ballistic missiles, the JIC recorded that:</p>
<p>“UNSCOM has verified destruction of the declared SCUDs (and the Iraqi derivatives) </p>
<p>and their launchers and believes it has a satisfactory account of what happened to </p>
<p>the rest. UNSCOM has also supervised destruction of components and much of the </p>
<p>missile-related infrastructure …”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>200. </b> The JIC noted, however, that Iraq would:</p>
<p>“… retain a technology and production base because UN SCR 687 allows it to </p>
<p>develop and manufacture missiles with ranges less than 150 km. But intelligence </p>
<p>reports that some current missile R&amp;D [research and development] work is being </p>
<p>hidden from UNSCOM inspectors. Iraq has now revealed that it developed … </p>
<p>SCUD-type missile motors. This re-introduces uncertainty into an area where </p>
<p>UNSCOM had previously expressed itself to be satisfied.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> In relation to chemical weapons, the JIC concluded that it was “unlikely” that </p>
<p>Iraq had “a covert stockpile of [chemical] weapons or agent in any significant quantity; </p>
<p>Hussein Kamil claims that there are no remaining stockpiles of agent”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The JIC added that Iraq:</p>
<p>“… could begin to make chemical weapons within a matter of weeks, and produce </p>
<p>significant quantities within months, if UN constraints were removed.”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> In relation to biological weapons, the JIC noted:</p>
<p>“We have convincing intelligence of a BW programme which started in the 1970s </p>
<p>and strong indications that it produced and weaponised anthrax, botulinum toxin, </p>
<p>and probably plague. With the exception of plague, Iraq previously admitted doing </p>
<p>research on these and other agents but steadfastly denied the work was for an </p>
<p>offensive programme. UNSCOM, although suspicious, could find no clear evidence </p>
<p>to the contrary … [I]n August 1995 Iraq admitted to a major BW programme </p>
<p>under which it had produced huge quantities of anthrax and botulinum toxin, but </p>
<p>implausibly denied it had ever considered weaponisation … In the last few days Iraq </p>
<p>has admitted to UNSCOM that agent was produced at additional sites, field-testing </p>
<p>of weapons took place in 1989, and that bombs and missile warheads were filled </p>
<p>with anthrax and botulinum toxin in December 1990 … Many questions remain on </p>
<p>the BW programme; Iraq has not, for example admitted any work on plague.”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>204. </b> After Lt Gen Kamil’s defection, concerns began to grow that Iraq had a systematic </p>
<p>programme of concealment.</p>
<p><b>205. </b> UNSCOM reported that Iraq’s FFCD on ballistic missiles in November 1995 did </p>
<p>not appear to constitute a firm basis for establishing a definite and verifiable material </p>
<p>balance for proscribed weapons and activities.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>206. </b> From early 1996, UNSCOM undertook a series of inspections specifically targeting </p>
<p>sites it “believed to be associated with concealment activities” in response to Iraq’s </p>
<p>assertion that “there was no systematic mechanism for concealment”.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>207. </b> While Iraq complied with its obligations in respect of most inspections, UNSCOM </p>
<p>reported encountering difficulties and delays on five occasions in March 1996 when it </p>
<p>requested no-notice inspections of sites related to Iraq’s missile programmes, and that </p>
<p>Iraq had also imposed restrictions on aerial surveillance.</p>

<p>61</p>
<p><b>208. </b> In a letter to the President of the Security Council on 17 March 1996, Mr Aziz </p>
<p>stated that the problems related to the special nature of the sites and that the delays </p>
<p>were “no longer than the time necessitated by … practical factors”.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> Mr Aziz cited the </p>
<p>agreement in July 1993, in response to Iraq’s concerns in respect of its sovereignty, </p>
<p>internal security and the dignity of the people and State of Iraq, that UNSCOM and the </p>
<p>IAEA intention was to implement their plans “in the least intrusive manner consistent </p>
<p>with effective monitoring and verification in the circumstances prevailing, with all due </p>
<p>regard to the legitimate concerns of Iraq … in accordance with the Charter of the </p>
<p>United Nations”. In addition, two of the requests, on 8 and 15 March, had been made </p>
<p>on a Friday. Appropriate arrangements had been made for the inspections to proceed, </p>
<p>including on two occasions after telephone conversations with Mr Ekéus.</p>
<p><b>209. </b> Mr Aziz also stated that the allegations that equipment could have been removed </p>
<p>and some documents burnt were “not realistic” given the presence of “more than </p>
<p>50 inspectors with 16 vehicles” surrounding the sites, helicopter surveillance and </p>
<p>the subsequent inspections.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Aziz reaffirmed that Iraq had “no intention of impeding” UNSCOM’s tasks. “On </p>
<p>the contrary”, it was “keen” to continue to work with UNSCOM to fulfil its tasks “as soon </p>
<p>as possible”. But Iraq expected UNSCOM, in discharging its duties, “to adhere” to its </p>
<p>“undertakings towards Iraq by respecting its sovereignty, dignity and national security”.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Aziz also wrote that he expected the Security Council “to deal with this issue in </p>
<p>an objective manner which would balance Iraq’s obligations towards the Security Council </p>
<p>and the Council’s obligations towards Iraq in accordance with the principles of the United </p>
<p>Nations Charter and the provisions of the relevant resolutions of the Council”.</p>
<p><b>212. </b> The incidents in which UNSCOM inspection teams were denied immediate </p>
<p>and unconditional access to sites prompted a statement by the President of the </p>
<p>Security Council that “Iraq’s delays in permitting the inspection team recently in Iraq </p>
<p>access to the sites concerned constitute clear violations by Iraq of the provisions of </p>
<p>resolutions 687 (1991), 707 (1991) and 715 (1991)”.</p>
<p><b>213. </b> On 27 March 1996, as part of developing the OMV system, the Security Council </p>
<p>adopted resolution 1051 (1996), which implemented a mechanism for monitoring sales </p>
<p>or supplies of items “relevant to the implementation of Section C of resolution 687 (1991) </p>
<p>and other relevant resolutions”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>214. </b> To replace the previous reporting systems, the resolution also consolidated the </p>
<p>progress reports on UNSCOM and the IAEA’s activities into reports every six months </p>
<p>from the UN on all aspects of its work.</p>

<p>UN Security Council resolution 1051 (1996).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>215. </b> The first consolidated report to the Security Council, in April, recorded that both the </p>
<p>volume and quality of information being provided by Iraq had diminished since February, </p>
<p>and found that:</p>
<p>“In all areas for which the Commission has responsibility, Iraq has yet to provide </p>
<p>sufficient evidence that it does not still possess proscribed weapons or materials </p>
<p>related to them. The Commission’s concerns stem particularly from the difficulties </p>
<p>encountered in substantiating Iraq’s claims that, in 1991, in flagrant violation of its </p>
<p>obligations under resolution 687 (1991) it secretly destroyed large quantities of these </p>
<p>prohibited weapons and materials instead of declaring and handing them over for </p>
<p>the Commission’s verification.”</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>216. </b> The report stated that “large quantities” of prohibited items had been “successfully </p>
<p>eliminated”, but “relatively minor, but highly significant, quantities” of proscribed items </p>
<p>remained “unaccounted for”.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> On the basis of new documents and draft disclosures provided by Iraq, UNSCOM </p>
<p>concluded that there had been “considerable progress” in some areas since December </p>
<p>1995. Iraq had disclosed information of great significance, especially documents </p>
<p>which it earlier said had been destroyed. There were, however, “significant deficiencies </p>
<p>and gaps”.</p>
<p><b>218. </b> In relation to Iraq’s ballistic missile programme, Iraq had submitted a revised draft </p>
<p>declaration on 27 February 1996 which contained significant new information, including </p>
<p>confirmation that equipment UNSCOM had decided should be disposed of in April 1995 </p>
<p>had been for a major project (Project 1728) for the development and production of liquid </p>
<p>propellant engines for long-range missiles.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Iraq had also admitted that it had “carried out an undeclared programme to modify </p>
<p>a Volga/SA2 surface-to-air missile system to a surface-to-surface application with a </p>
<p>range of over 100 kilometres”, including “flight tests and prototype production of some </p>
<p>components”, which should have been declared. As a result, an extensive programme to </p>
<p>monitor Iraq’s Volga missiles was required.</p>
<p><b>220. </b> UNSCOM remained concerned about Iraq’s undeclared procurement of prohibited </p>
<p>and dual-use items.</p>
<p><b>221. </b> In January 1996, UNSCOM had investigated the recent delivery of “a large number </p>
<p>of sophisticated guidance and control components” which it assessed were “used in </p>
<p>missiles with ranges over thousands of kilometres”. Iraq had denied acquiring the items </p>
<p>but following official investigations it had confirmed that “its authorities and missile </p>

<p>63</p>
<p>facilities had been involved … through a specific middleman” and some components </p>
<p>had been delivered in July 1995. Other components had been stored in transit in </p>
<p>Jordan. A Director General of an Iraqi missile facility stated that he had destroyed the </p>
<p>components received in August 1995 and informed the Iraqi authorities of the receipt of </p>
<p>proscribed items in August and October. There were still “contradictions and ambiguities” </p>
<p>about what had happened, but Iraq was reluctant to broaden the investigation.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> There were suspicions that items still existed and Iraq was withholding important </p>
<p>documents. Although no proscribed items had been found, Iraq’s actions in March meant </p>
<p>that UNSCOM’s confidence had been diminished.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> Iraq had provided a new draft disclosure in relation to chemical weapons in </p>
<p>February 1996. This was an improvement in some areas, but there were important gaps. </p>
<p>These included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “level of expertise achieved in research and development activities … large-</p>
<p>scale production techniques, weaponisation and delivery systems”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of disclosures on precursor production capabilities and dual-use </p>
<p>equipment within the civilian chemical industry; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s activities in relation to “V class” agents.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> In the new draft disclosure the quantities of precursor chemicals and agents and </p>
<p>munitions produced, procured and destroyed had been changed but the source of the </p>
<p>new information was not clear. UNSCOM’s “strong presumption” was that it was based </p>
<p>on information which Iraq had not disclosed.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Specifically, there were changes in the figures for the production and </p>
<p>weaponisation of VX:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Initially Iraq stated that only laboratory scale synthesis had been undertaken.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In March 1995, Iraq had admitted “production of 260 kilograms and </p>
<p>weaponisation of the agent in three aerial bombs”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In November 1995, Iraq had declared that it had produced “3.3 tonnes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the February disclosure, the figure for production had “increased by a further </p>
<p>20 per cent”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not produced evidence to substantiate its statement that the </p>
<p>“precursors for the large-scale production of VX” had been destroyed.</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Iraq had assisted in excavations of buildings at al-Muthanna, Iraq’s largest </p>
<p>chemical weapons research and production facility, which were destroyed in February </p>
<p>1991. Records and “some 80 munitions and components” had been recovered, including </p>
<p>“122 millimetre artillery chemical warheads and 155 millimetre ‘binary’ artillery shells”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>227. </b> There had been “serious deficiencies” in the draft disclosure on biological weapons </p>
<p>submitted in November 1995 but Iraq had produced new documents and disclosures </p>
<p>during discussions in January 1996, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Hakam had been intended to be a “specialised filling facility for biological </p>
<p>warfare munitions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>R-400 bombs for biological warfare purposes were assembled there.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Clarification of several issues including “those related to destruction of some </p>
<p>types of biological warfare munitions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “serious attempt” had been made to “resolve the fundamental issue of the </p>
<p>filling and … destruction of biological warfare warheads for missiles”; but it </p>
<p>had not been possible to do so because “Iraq’s statements did not conform to </p>
<p>documentation available” to UNSCOM.</p>
<p><b>228. </b> Discussions in February had been less productive. Changes were introduced </p>
<p>“without any documentary support or convincing explanations”. The view of the </p>
<p>UNSCOM team involved was that their Iraqi counterparts “tended to change production </p>
<p>data to accommodate newly discovered facts”.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> UNSCOM wanted “a substantiated material balance … from production to </p>
<p>destruction”, but the draft disclosure submitted in March did not match UNSCOM’s </p>
<p>findings. Unless Iraq could rectify that “in a convincing manner” in its formal declaration, </p>
<p>it would “cause great problems”.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> Iraq had accepted an UNSCOM request to cease all activity at two sites identified </p>
<p>with the production of BW agents and assisted in establishing appropriate deactivation </p>
<p>and surveillance measures.</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Iraq had provided a report on a radiological weapons project by the Military </p>
<p>Industrial Corporation and Iraq’s Atomic Energy Commission between August and </p>
<p>December 1987, “to combine the effectiveness of conventional aerial munitions with the </p>
<p>spreading of radioactive materials”. Four prototypes had been constructed. The report </p>
<p>had concluded that Iraq “had the capability to manufacture a bomb containing irradiated </p>
<p>materials”, but the Iraqi Air Force suggested that there should be a study to consider </p>
<p>reducing the weight of the bomb.</p>
<p><b>232. </b> Iraq’s declaration stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The project had been abandoned and no order to produce radiological weapons </p>
<p>was given.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>100 empty casings for a smaller calibre bomb had been produced.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>75 of the casings had been sent to the Al-Qa-Qa State Establishment, but their </p>
<p>fate was not addressed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>25 of those casings which remained at al-Muthanna were unilaterally destroyed </p>
<p>in the summer of 1991.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>233. </b> UNSCOM hoped that the diminution in the quality of information and the quantity </p>
<p>of documents provided since mid-February, and the difficulties with inspections in March, </p>
<p>“did not indicate a return to the non-co-operative attitude demonstrated by Iraq prior </p>
<p>to the summer of 1995”.</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Iraq’s biological weapons facilities, and growth media it had purchased, were </p>
<p>destroyed under UNSCOM supervision in May and June 1996.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>235. </b> In May 1996, Iraq admitted that the documents handed over on 20 August 1995 </p>
<p>“constituted only a portion” of the documentation which had been concealed; the rest </p>
<p>had “been burnt just a few days” earlier, “at another farm west of Baghdad”.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>236. </b> In May, UNSCOM sent a team to Iraq to conduct interviews with Iraqi officials </p>
<p>believed to be involved in concealment activities.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> Iraq “abruptly” terminated its </p>
<p>co-operation with the inspectors, and claimed that Lt Gen Kamil had been entirely </p>
<p>responsible for the concealment programme, a claim which was retracted in August.</p>
<p><b>237. </b> A JIC Assessment on 12 June 1996 reflected the concerns about Iraq’s </p>
<p>concealment activities.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>238. </b> In relation to ballistic missiles, the JIC stated:</p>
<p>“Information obtained in the wake of the … defection has, however, led UNSCOM </p>
<p>to judge that missile components, launchers and possibly complete SCUD missiles </p>
<p>remain hidden. We doubt whether there are any concealed missiles in Iraq but it is </p>
<p>likely that components remain.”</p>
<p><b>239. </b> The JIC also assessed that:</p>
<p>“If all UN controls were to be removed and Iraq could purchase the technology </p>
<p>and expertise required … an accurate 1,000km range missile could probably be </p>
<p>produced within three to five years. A 300–500km range SCUD type missile could </p>
<p>be indigenously manufactured within two years.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>240. </b> In relation to Iraq’s biological warfare programme, the JIC noted:</p>
<p>“We do not believe Iraqi statements that the BW programme has been destroyed. </p>
<p>Possibly substantial elements, including some production equipment and </p>
<p>weaponised agent, continue to be concealed.”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>241. </b> The JIC also stated:</p>
<p>“Iraq has not yet admitted to work on plague and has played down its success in </p>
<p>developing BW aerosol delivery systems.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>242. </b> In relation to chemical warfare, the JIC stated that it doubted whether “all agents, </p>
<p>munitions, precursor chemicals and equipment have been accounted for”.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>243. </b> The Butler Report stated that its authors had been informed that the reason for </p>
<p>the change in the JIC’s view on Iraq’s biological warfare programme, “in the apparent </p>
<p>absence of underpinning reliable intelligence”, was:</p>
<p>“… the impact of … Kamil’s defection, UNSCOM’s inability to reconcile Iraqi claims </p>
<p>for production and destruction, unaccounted-for growth media and a total lack of </p>
<p>co-operation from the Iraqis.”</p>
<p>109</p>

<p><b>244. </b> Following a series of incidents in which the inspectors were denied access, </p>
<p>resolution 1060 (1996), adopted on 12 June 1996, deplored Iraq’s refusal to allow </p>
<p>UNSCOM access to sites designated for inspections and demanded “immediate, </p>

<p><b>Tension in the Kurdish region</b></p>
<p>A dispute between the two main Kurdish parties, the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) and </p>
<p>the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK), became increasingly tense from May 1994.</p>
<p>In August 1996, the KDP, led by Mr Masoud Barzani, sought Saddam Hussein’s support </p>
<p>to retake the city of Erbil from the PUK, led by Mr Jalal Talabani. Saddam Hussein sent </p>
<p>thousands of troops and more than 300 tanks to attack the PUK in Erbil.</p>
<p>The conflict was eventually ended by the US-mediated “Washington Agreement” between </p>
<p>the PUK and the KDP in September 1998. The two parties agreed to share revenues and </p>
<p>power and to exclude Iraqi troops from the Kurdish region. The US pledged to protect the </p>
<p>Kurds from aggression by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>252. </b> The President of the Security Council issued a statement on 23 August 1996 </p>
<p>reinforcing the importance of Iraq’s co-operation with UNSCOM and that it should </p>
<p>be given immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access to facilities and individuals </p>
<p>to allow it fully to discharge its mandate and stating that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council remained “gravely concerned” by Iraq’s failure to comply fully with </p>
<p>its obligations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s repeated denial of access to sites and attempts made to impose </p>
<p>conditions on interviews were a “gross violation of its obligations” as well as  </p>
<p>a contradiction of its commitments in the joint statement of 22 June.</p>

<p><b>253. </b> On 3 September, Mr Ekéus reported that, during discussions in Baghdad on  </p>

<p>sincerely and effectively” by the June agreements.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Mr Ekéus had stressed that concerns relating to concealment of proscribed items </p>
<p>remained a prime objective for UNSCOM. Mr Aziz made a formal statement to the effect </p>
<p>that Iraq did not conceal proscribed weapons, components or documents and asked </p>
<p>UNSCOM to refrain from conducting further on-site inspections and interviews on that </p>
<p>issue. Mr Ekéus said they must continue.</p>
<p><b>255. </b> Iraq also stated that it would not accept any new extension or enlargement of </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s rights and privileges and on several occasions “attempted to dictate how </p>
<p>and to what extent” those rights should be exercised.</p>

<p><b>256. </b> Mr Ekéus concluded that the visit had been useful, clarifying the respective </p>
<p>positions of Iraq and UNSCOM and narrowing certain differences. UNSCOM would </p>
<p>continue vigorously to pursue verification of Iraq’s disclosures. He hoped that a repeat </p>
<p>of Iraq’s actions over the last few months could be avoided, but that it required “full and </p>
<p>unreserved co-operation from the Government of Iraq and a genuine policy … to carry </p>
<p>out its obligations”.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> In the subsequent press briefing, Mr Ekéus stated that he felt there was “a certain </p>
<p>commitment” although UNSCOM suspected “an active policy of concealment”. Its task </p>
<p>was to find and destroy prohibited items and to ensure that no new ones were produced </p>
<p>but it would now have to “wait until the situation had become a bit more settled”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Following a meeting with UNSCOM in September 1996, Iraq admitted in a letter </p>
<p>of 3 October that production tools and components for ballistic missiles had been </p>
<p>collected and concealed in July 1991, but they had been destroyed in March 1992.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Iraq had also declared that three missiles which had been retained in July 1991 were </p>
<p>not destroyed until October that year.</p>
<p><b>259. </b> In his report of 11 October 1996, the UN Secretary-General wrote:</p>
<p>“The results of the Commission’s investigations, starting with UNSCOM 143 </p>
<p>in March 1996 and continuing through August, clearly show that there was an </p>
<p>organized mechanism of concealment used by Iraq to deny access to proscribed </p>
<p>documents and material retained since the adoption of resolution 687 (1991). </p>
<p>Throughout this investigation Iraq has sought to deflect or minimize the involvement </p>
<p>of its special security services in concealment activities. It has acknowledged that </p>
<p>officially sanctioned false statements had been made to mislead the Commission </p>
<p>in its investigations. It has resorted to delays and denials of access … Despite </p>
<p>this behaviour the Commission has accumulated information which reinforces its </p>
<p>assessment that the concealment mechanism has been established for the purpose </p>
<p>of hiding and protecting proscribed material.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>260. </b> UNSCOM had:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>261. </b> The report said that Iraq’s sixth version of an FFCD on its biological warfare </p>
<p>programme, produced on 22 June 1996, was “not credible”. “Major sections” were </p>
<p>“incomplete, inaccurate or unsubstantiated”, and the lack of documentation was “difficult </p>
<p>to accept”.</p>
<p><b>262. </b> UNSCOM had “evidence that chemical warfare agents and munitions were </p>
<p>produced in 1989” although Iraq had “consistently denied this”; and that it believed that </p>
<p>“production of different types of chemical weapons was also carried out in the first half </p>
<p>of 1990”.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Iraq’s FFCD on ballistic missiles, submitted on 2 July 1996, had reported the </p>
<p>previously undisclosed acquisition of important proscribed missile components, but </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s view was that Iraq had “still … not fully accounted for all proscribed </p>
<p>weapons”.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> UNSCOM also had:</p>
<p>“… concerns related to undeclared facilities where equipment … was evacuated </p>
<p>before January 1991 and the unilateral destruction conducted secretly by Iraq in </p>
<p>the summer of 1991, when, among other items, chemical warheads for Al Hussein </p>
<p>missiles and nerve agent VX precursors were allegedly destroyed.”</p>
<p><b>265. </b> The report concluded by stating that the requirement for full, final and complete </p>
<p>disclosures had “not been fully met”. It had “a good understanding” of Iraq’s programme </p>
<p>“to create a massive number of tactical chemical weapons” before August 1988. But </p>
<p>details of two later phases, to integrate the “programme into Iraq’s chemical industry and </p>
<p>production of more stable and storable chemical agents” and “the design and production </p>
<p>of strategic chemical weapons”, had not been disclosed. An understanding of those two </p>
<p>phases was “absolutely necessary” before UNSCOM could complete its task and verify </p>
<p>that nothing remained.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> In January 1997, Mr Kofi Annan became the UN Secretary-General.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> In his memoir, written in 2012, Mr Annan wrote that, in the six years after the end of </p>
<p>the Gulf Conflict in 1991, Iraq “became transformed from an example of the international </p>
<p>community’s acting lawfully in pursuit of the highest aims of the UN’s founders to an </p>
<p>albatross around the organisation’s neck”. The UN mandate had been only to “reverse </p>
<p>the invasion of Kuwait, nothing more”. But that:</p>
<p>“… left Saddam Hussein in power, the predatory leader of a brutal, tyrannical regime </p>
<p>that demonstrated little evidence of intending to comply fully with the demands of the </p>
<p>international community.”</p>

<p><b>268. </b> Mr Annan added that his predecessor as Secretary-General had offered him only </p>
<p>one piece of advice when he left office at the end of 1996:</p>
<p>“Watch out for the question of Iraq … It will become very important.”</p>
<p><b>Dr Albright’s Georgetown speech</b></p>
<p><b>269. </b> In a speech at Georgetown University on 26 March 1997, Dr Madeleine Albright, </p>
<p>the new US Secretary of State, reaffirmed that US policy in Iraq was “part of a broad </p>
<p>commitment to protect the security and territory of our friends and allies in the Gulf”.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Quoting President George HW Bush, Dr Albright stated that, as well as driving Iraq </p>
<p>out of Kuwait, the US objective in launching Operation Desert Storm in 1991 had been </p>
<p>to cause Iraq once again to “live as a peaceful and co-operative member of the family </p>
<p>of nations”. Iraq’s leaders had, however, “continued to defy the will of the international </p>
<p>community” and “from the outset”, chosen “denial, delay and deceit”. They had:</p>
<p>“… lied … blocked inspections, concealed documents, falsified evidence and </p>
<p>challenged UNSCOM’s clear and legitimate authority.”</p>
<p><b>271. </b> Dr Albright added that, following the defection of Lt Gen Kamil, it had “appeared for </p>
<p>a time, as if it would cause Iraq finally to accept the need for full disclosure”, but that had </p>
<p>not been the case and Iraq’s “refusal to co-operate fully continued”. The US would be </p>
<p>“unwavering”; it would “not allow Iraq to regain by stonewalling the Security Council what </p>
<p>it forfeited by aggression on the battlefield”. An international consensus “that Iraq should </p>
<p>not be allowed again to threaten international peace” had been sustained.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Dr Albright stated that Iraq’s military threat to its neighbours was “greatly </p>
<p>diminished”, and, “As long as the apparatus of sanctions, enforcement, inspections and </p>
<p>monitoring” was “in place”, Iraq would “remain trapped within a strategic box”. But she </p>
<p>warned that it was “essential” that international resolve did not weaken:</p>
<p>“Containment has worked, but … the future threat has not been erased. Iraq’s </p>
<p>behaviour and intentions must change before our policies can change.”</p>
<p><b>273. </b> Iraq had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“yet to provide convincing evidence that it has destroyed all” its chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“admitted loading many … [chemical and biological] agents into missile </p>
<p>warheads” before the Gulf Conflict;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>retained “more than 7,500 nuclear scientists and technicians, as well as </p>
<p>technical documents related to the production of nuclear weapons”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“been caught trying to smuggle in missile guidance instruments”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>274. </b> Dr Albright added that “according to Ambassador Ekéus”, UNSCOM had “not </p>
<p>been able to account for all the missiles Iraq acquired over the years”. He believed it </p>
<p>was “highly likely” that Iraq retained “an operational SCUD missile force, probably with </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons to go with it”.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> Dr Albright stated that, if Iraq was “released from sanctions and scrutiny”, its </p>
<p>“current government … would pick up where it left off” in 1991. “For those reasons”, </p>
<p>US policy would “not change”. The US did:</p>
<p>“… not agree with the nations who argue that if Iraq complies with its obligations </p>
<p>concerning weapons of mass destruction, sanctions should be lifted. Our view, which </p>
<p>is unshakeable, is that Iraq must prove its peaceful intentions. It can only do that by </p>
<p>complying with all of the Security Council resolutions to which it is subject.”</p>
<p><b>276. </b> Dr Albright added that the evidence was “overwhelming” that Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>intentions would “never be peaceful”. The US looked forward “to the day when Iraq </p>
<p>rejoins the family of nations as a responsible and law abiding member”, and “a change </p>
<p>in Iraq’s government could lead to a change in US policy”. But until that day came, </p>
<p>the US would “insist, with all the diplomatic tools at our command, that UN sanctions </p>
<p>remain in place”, while doing what it “responsibly” could to “minimize the suffering </p>
<p>of Iraqi citizens”.</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Mr Ekéus told the Inquiry that, after Dr Albright’s speech:</p>
<p>“Tariq Aziz made it clear to me that from now on it would be close to impossible </p>
<p>to convince the President of the value of co-operating with the UN inspectors. </p>
<p>This move by the US was from our perspective destructive.”</p>

<p><b>278. </b> The Security Council was told in April 1997 that there had been tangible results in </p>
<p>some areas of UNSCOM’s activities but the capabilities which could not be accounted </p>
<p>for could not be ignored.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>279. </b> The report of UNSCOM’s activities since 11 October 1996 stated that work over the </p>

<p><b>280. </b> UNSCOM’s achievements demonstrated that:</p>
<p>“… international weapons inspections under the auspices of the United </p>
<p>Nations, if applied with first-rate expertise and modern technology, can </p>
<p>achieve effective results.”</p>
<p><b>281. </b> But UNSCOM was continuing its work because it could not state that Iraq had </p>
<p>“accounted for all weapons, components and capabilities proscribed” in resolution 687 </p>
<p>for a number of reasons, including Iraq’s unilateral programme of destruction in </p>
<p>contravention of resolution 687 and its policy of concealment “aimed at deceiving the </p>
<p>inspectors and at retaining limited but significant proscribed capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Because of the “inadequacies, incompleteness and lack of evidentiary </p>
<p>documentation” in Iraq’s FFCDs, UNSCOM had been unable credibly to verify Iraq’s </p>
<p>declarations. In an effort to expedite that process, Mr Ekéus and Mr Aziz had agreed to </p>
<p>adopt an innovative process whereby UNSCOM presented its detailed findings and an </p>
<p>assessment of the outstanding problems at the “political level” in Baghdad. This process </p>
<p>had started by addressing missile issues in December 1996, followed by discussions on </p>
<p>chemical weapons in February and April 1997 and biological weapons in April 1997.</p>
<p><b>283. </b> The process had “led to a much clearer understanding” by Iraq’s political </p>
<p>leadership of the problems and what Iraq needed to do to resolve them. UNSCOM </p>
<p>hoped that this would help to overcome the lack of progress on technical issues.</p>
<p><b>284. </b> The report stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new process constituted “a fruitful approach” if Iraq was “fully co-operative </p>
<p>and transparent in its response to the Commission’s initiatives and concerns”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Tangible results” had “already been achieved” on missiles and chemical </p>
<p>weapons.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Agreement for remnants of missiles unilaterally destroyed by Iraq to be removed </p>
<p>and analysed outside Iraq had not been reached until late February, and the </p>
<p>work would require “several weeks or months before it was completed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More documentation on Iraq’s proscribed programmes should exist and had </p>
<p>been formally requested.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had stated that there was no policy to withhold information and when </p>
<p>documents were discovered they were given to UNSCOM.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were difficulties on biological weapons. Iraq had been asked to reconsider </p>
<p>its position and provide a new declaration; and after some discussion had </p>
<p>agreed on 5 April to do so.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> UNSCOM also reported that the completeness and accuracy of Iraq’s declarations </p>
<p>and a clear understanding of the scope and history of its proscribed programmes were </p>
<p>essential for an effective monitoring programme.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>286. </b> Since October 1996, there had been “a pattern of efforts” by Iraq “to restrict the </p>
<p>Commission’s monitoring activities” which had caused “serious problems”. UNSCOM </p>
<p>hoped that commitments given by Mr Aziz to Mr Ekéus during their meeting in April </p>
<p>would be “translated into action”.</p>
<p><b>287. </b> There was “not much” that was unknown about Iraq’s “proscribed weapons </p>
<p>capabilities”, but what was “unaccounted for” could not:</p>
<p>“… be neglected. Even a limited inventory of long-range missiles would be a source </p>
<p>of deep concern if those missiles were fitted with warheads filled with the most </p>
<p>deadly of chemical nerve agents, VX. If one single missile warhead were filled </p>
<p>with the biological agent, Anthrax, many millions of lethal doses could be spread </p>
<p>in an attack on any city in the region. With that in mind, the Special Commission </p>
<p>has undertaken extraordinary efforts to bring to a satisfactory conclusion the full </p>
<p>accounting of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles, in order </p>
<p>to be able to make sure that all the proscribed items have been disposed of.”</p>
<p><b>288. </b> UNSCOM concluded:</p>
<p>“A solid framework with tested procedures is in place. It is now time for Iraq to make </p>
<p>full use of this and to provide the material and data to give substance to its stated </p>
<p>commitment of full co-operation. The remaining problems … cannot be solved </p>
<p>through a technical process … Their solution requires the major political decision by </p>
<p>Iraq’s leadership to give up, once and for all, all capabilities and ambition to retain or </p>
<p>acquire the proscribed weapons …”</p>
<p><b>289. </b> UNSCOM’s activities between October 1996 and April 1997 and the discrepancies </p>
<p>between its findings and Iraq’s declarations were set out in detail in an Appendix to the </p>
<p>report.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> Its key points included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had still not provided a credible account of quantities and types of “special </p>
<p>warheads” which had been produced for proscribed missiles, and UNSCOM had </p>
<p>“evidence that Iraq has provided incorrect information”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Not all chemical bombs had been declared by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “final disposition of the programme for the production of … VX” remained </p>
<p>“unresolved”. Iraq claimed that it had only carried out activities “on the </p>
<p>laboratory/pilot plant scale”, and that it had destroyed “hundreds of tons of VX </p>
<p>precursors in 1991”. UNSCOM had “evidence that Iraq obtained the technology” </p>
<p>and retained “equipment for the large-scale production of VX”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In December 1996, UNSCOM had presented its concerns that “In an attempt </p>
<p>to mislead the Commission, Iraq had tried to falsify evidence” of missile </p>
<p>destruction.</p>

<p><b>298. </b> Mr Ekéus wrote to the President of the Security Council again on 12 June to report </p>
<p>Iraq’s decision to deny UNSCOM access to three sites on 10 and 12 June.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p><b>299. </b> In a response on 15 June, Mr Aziz set out at length Iraq’s “serious and real </p>
<p>concerns relating to Special Commission inspection teams’ access to sites” which were </p>
<p>“important” to Iraq’s “sovereignty or national security”.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Aziz stated that, following their agreement of 22 June 1996, he had agreed </p>
<p>with Mr Ekéus in October that “joint work should concentrate on reviewing” the missile, </p>
<p>chemical and biological files in turn, and “working to close them”. UNSCOM had, </p>
<p>however, “altered” that approach when it “began to carry out large-scale inspections, the </p>
<p>likes of which had not been conducted for several years” in March 1997. The inspections </p>
<p>were based “on the pretext of verifying alleged claims of the concealment of proscribed </p>
<p>items and activities” from the “intelligence sources of some States which provide the </p>
<p>Special Commission with such fabricated information”. Those sources were “tendentious </p>
<p>and inaccurate”.</p>
<p><b>301. </b> In addition, Mr Aziz wrote that Iraq had “serious concern” that the facilities available </p>
<p>to UNSCOM were being used as “a cover to detect the arrangements made for the </p>
<p>security of Iraq, its leadership and the personnel involved”. Mr Aziz was particularly </p>
<p>concerned about the activities of Colonel Scott Ritter, a UN inspector and serving </p>
<p>member of the US Army.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> Mr Aziz stressed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Allegations concerning concealment of proscribed items were “false”, and </p>
<p>UNSCOM had “no concrete evidence to substantiate them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “pointed out … that limited operations of no practical value were carried </p>
<p>out in 1991 by Hussein Kamil and a very small number of individuals”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “facts and information related to those operations” had been made available </p>
<p>to UNSCOM, and it had interviewed the personnel involved and visited the sites </p>
<p>of concealment “over a period of several months”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq suspected that the aim was “to keep matters in a state of flux, and justify the </p>
<p>endless continuation of the embargo”, which served “the well-known purposes </p>
<p>of a certain State”.</p>

<p>RESOLUTION 1115 (1997)</p>
<p><b>303. </b> On 21 June, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1115 (1997), </p>
<p>condemning Iraq’s actions and demanding its full co-operation. Although the resolution </p>
<p>was adopted unanimously, there were clear differences between the positions of the US </p>
<p>and UK, and China and Russia.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, in resolution 1115 the Security </p>
<p>Council condemned the “repeated refusal of the Iraqi authorities to allow access to sites </p>
<p>designated by the Special Commission”, which constituted a “clear and flagrant violation” </p>
<p>of the provisions of previous resolutions. The Council reiterated its the demands for </p>
<p>Iraq to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“co-operate fully”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allow “immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access” for the inspectors; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“give immediate, unconditional and unrestricted access” to officials whom the </p>
<p>Special Commission wished to interview.</p>
<p><b>305. </b> The resolution requested the Chairman of UNSCOM to include “an annex </p>
<p>evaluating Iraq’s compliance” with those requirements in his future reports to </p>
<p>the Council.</p>
<p><b>306. </b> The resolution expressed the Council’s “firm intention … to impose additional </p>
<p>measures” on the officials responsible if Iraq did not comply.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> In a statement before the vote, Sir John Weston, the UK Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN in New York, stated that the Council was meeting “to respond </p>
<p>to the latest in a series of incidents” in which the Iraqi authorities had “sought to </p>
<p>impose conditions”, which he described as an “Iraqi campaign to prevent the Special </p>
<p>Commission carrying out the mandate given to it by this Council” which was “obviously </p>
<p>directed from the highest levels in Baghdad”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Sir John added that it was “simply incredible for Iraq to claim that this campaign </p>
<p>of concealment was the work of the late Hussein Kamil and a few associates”. It was </p>
<p>“essential” that the “mechanism of deception and concealment” was:</p>

<p>“… fully exposed and brought to an end. Otherwise we cannot know whether caches </p>
<p>of equipment, documents, facilities, or entire programmes still exist of which we are </p>
<p>unaware and which will therefore not be subject to monitoring.”</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Sir John concluded that Iraq had “repeatedly assured” the Council of its </p>
<p>“commitment to furnishing full co-operation” but had “failed to translate these assurances </p>
<p>into reality”. The draft resolution was a “reasonable, proportionate and focused” way to </p>
<p>remind Iraq of its obligations.</p>
<p><b>310. </b> Mr Nabil Elaraby, Egyptian Permanent Representative to the UN, made it clear </p>
<p>that an earlier draft of the resolution had proposed “additional sanctions to be imposed </p>
<p>on Iraq at a time when the regional Arab, African and Islamic organizations and those </p>
<p>associated with the Non-Aligned Movement wish the Special Commission to end its </p>
<p>mission so as to put an end to the suffering of the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Mr Edward Gnehm, US Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that, </p>
<p>far from complying, Iraq had “expended its best efforts to thwart the will of the Council, </p>
<p>particularly in the crucial area of weapons of mass destruction”. Since 1991, it had:</p>
<p>“… made every effort to conceal its true weapons capabilities, to destroy evidence </p>
<p>of its programmes and supply routes and to lie about it to this Council. In the last </p>
<p>two years, Iraqi efforts to interfere with the Special Commission … have intensified </p>
<p>… UNSCOM inspectors have observed blatant efforts to remove documents and </p>
<p>other evidence from sites while the inspectors themselves have been prevented </p>
<p>from entering; and UNSCOM inspectors have been refused permission to interview </p>
<p>knowledgeable individuals.”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Gnehm added that Iraq had abrogated the modalities in the joint agreement </p>
<p>and its “obstructionist actions were taken under orders from the highest authorities in </p>
<p>Baghdad”. UNSCOM was facing its most serious threat since it was established and </p>
<p>Iraq’s failure was “a serious threat to the region’s peace and security”. Mr Ekéus’s </p>
<p>briefing to the Council had confirmed that there had been “no improvement” in Iraq’s </p>
<p>“alarming policies” since his April report and Iraq had “responded with contempt” to the </p>
<p>Council’s resolutions and statements.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Gnehm stated:</p>
<p>“… the time for mere words is over. Iraq has shown us that it will never voluntarily </p>
<p>comply with resolutions of the Council unless the Council acts firmly and decisively </p>
<p>to enforce its will. That is why we have brought forward this resolution today, which </p>
<p>will demonstrate conclusively to Iraq that its actions have serious consequences …</p>
<p>“… We have chosen these particular steps because they are measured and </p>
<p>targeted …</p>
<p>“Similarly, the Council expresses its intent to impose new measures, targeted </p>
<p>precisely at those parties most responsible for the continued concealment of </p>

<p>Commission’s authority to conduct inspections and interviews without interference </p>
<p>of any sort.”</p>
<p><b>314. </b> In a statement after the vote, Mr Qin Huasun, Chinese Permanent Representative </p>
<p>to the UN, stated that Iraq had “basically maintained its co-operation” and that UNSCOM </p>
<p>had “made great progress in discharging the mandate entrusted to it”. He added: “Under </p>
<p>these circumstances, we should consider gradually lifting sanctions against Iraq in order </p>
<p>to alleviate its humanitarian difficulties.”</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN, emphasised </p>
<p>the importance of the Security Council’s consensus on a “balanced”, not “one-sided” </p>
<p>response which reflected “both the very core of the problem and the broad range of </p>
<p>views of the members of the Security Council”, and was “not based on the logic of </p>
<p>punishment but forms part of the Council’s main thrust: to conclude this disarmament </p>
<p>issue as quickly as possible and to achieve a lasting post-conflict settlement in the </p>
<p>Persian Gulf on the basis of resolution 687 (1991)”.</p>
<p>MR RICHARD BUTLER SUCCEEDS MR ROLF EKÉUS</p>
<p><b>316. </b> On 1 July, Mr Richard Butler, an Australian diplomat and former Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN, succeeded Mr Ekéus as the Executive Chairman of </p>
<p>UNSCOM.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>317. </b> From mid-September 1997 there were further serious incidents in which UNSCOM </p>
<p>access to designated sites was denied or delayed, and material was moved or </p>
<p>destroyed, which were reported to the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>318. </b> On 3 September, the JIC stated that Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… claimed, however, that it had terminated the [BW] programme and destroyed </p>
<p>its arsenal before UN inspections began in 1991. These admissions, while assessed </p>
<p>to be largely accurate, are incomplete. We assess that Iraq has withheld information </p>
<p>on key elements of its programme: reliable intelligence has described work on </p>
<p>plague and suspicions persist of work on other pox viruses.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>319. </b> Following a briefing to Security Council members from Mr Butler about two </p>
<p>incidents the previous weekend, the President of the Security Council told the press </p>
<p>on 17 September that the Council viewed Iraq’s failure to co-operate and to apply the </p>

<p><b>320. </b> Despite that statement, inspection teams were prevented from inspecting three </p>
<p>sites between 27 September and 1 October.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> Constraints had also been imposed </p>
<p>on two occasions on UNSCOM flights inside Iraq.</p>
<p><b>321. </b> Mr Butler’s report to the Security Council of 6 October acknowledged that progress </p>
<p>had been made in “substantive areas” of UNSCOM’s mandate, “in particular with respect </p>
<p>to accounting for Iraq’s proscribed long-range missiles and the destruction of chemical </p>
<p>weapons-related equipment and materials”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>322. </b> In addition, since April there had been more than 170 site inspections by visiting </p>
<p>teams and more than 700 site inspections by resident monitoring teams. The majority </p>
<p>had been conducted “without let or hindrance”. The “atmosphere in which consultations </p>
<p>with the Government of Iraq had been conducted” had “improved” and a number of </p>
<p>problems had been resolved through direct contacts between Mr Butler and Mr Aziz.</p>
<p><b>323. </b> A work programme had been agreed with Mr Aziz in late July.</p>
<p><b>324. </b> In relation to ballistic missiles, the work programme “put special emphasis </p>
<p>on achieving a solid and verifiable material balance”. Mr Butler reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had been able to account for 817 of the 819 missiles imported by </p>
<p>Iraq before 1988, including 83 of the 85 missiles which Iraq had claimed it had </p>
<p>unilaterally destroyed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspections in August and September 1997 had accounted for 14 mobile missile </p>
<p>launchers, but there were questions arising from Iraq’s different accounts of </p>
<p>what had happened to the launchers and its concealment of the fact that it had </p>
<p>initially retained four launchers, which were not destroyed until October 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had not yet been able to account for proscribed missile warheads </p>
<p>or propellants or the destruction of guidance components.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In September 1997, Iraq had offered a new account of its concealment and </p>
<p>destruction of components for indigenous production of missile engines and the </p>
<p>means for their production, but had not provided any documentation to support </p>
<p>that declaration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM questioned Iraq’s claims that it was not withholding any relevant </p>
<p>documents.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had increased its declarations on the number of special warheads for the </p>
<p>Al Hussein missile, filled with chemical or biological agents, several times. </p>
<p>UNSCOM had established that the minimum number produced was 75, and that </p>
<p>five additional warheads had been used for trials. It also “had evidence of the </p>
<p>probable existence of a number of additional special warheads”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had been unable fully to confirm Iraq’s unilateral destruction of 45 of </p>
<p>those warheads.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Accounting for proscribed warheads would “greatly increase” UNSCOM’s ability </p>
<p>to report with confidence that Iraq did not possess a proscribed missile force.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More work was required to account for Iraq’s indigenous production of </p>
<p>proscribed missile systems.</p>
<p><b>325. </b> In relation to Iraq’s chemical weapons programmes, UNSCOM was “still </p>
<p>investigating the veracity” of Iraq’s claims that it had unilaterally destroyed weapons </p>
<p>and agents.</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Iraq had not declared the removal and concealment of some production equipment </p>
<p>from al-Muthanna until August 1997 and its plans required further clarification.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> The “most important” outstanding issues were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“accounting for special missile warheads”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “material balance of 155mm mustard shells”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “extent of the VX programme”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the rationale for the acquisition of various types of chemical weapons.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Iraq had declared in June 1996 that 550 artillery munitions filled with mustard agent </p>
<p>had been destroyed during the 1991 Gulf Conflict but had not yet provided evidence of </p>
<p>that destruction.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> UNSCOM had been unable to verify the destruction of Iraq’s stocks of precursor </p>
<p>chemicals for the production of VX. In addition, while Iraq had declared, after 1995, that </p>
<p>the project had failed and no large-scale production had ever taken place, UNSCOM </p>
<p>had “recently obtained further sufficient evidence” that Iraq had “succeeded in acquiring </p>
<p>VX production capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Important progress had been made, but Iraq would need to provide “much more </p>
<p>and accurate material and related access … relevant to the warheads and VX questions” </p>
<p>before UNSCOM would be able to “report positively on disarmament”.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> UNSCOM reported to the Security Council on 6 October that Iraq’s total production </p>
<p>and holdings of CW agents could not be verified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Over a period of seven years Iraq had provided three formal FFCD (full and </p>
<p>final complete declarations) and about 20 sets of clarifications …”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s acquisition and expenditure of munitions before 1988 could not be </p>
<p>verified because of the absence of sufficient evidence from Iraq and its former </p>
<p>foreign suppliers of the procurement of precursor chemicals, production and </p>
<p>weaponisation of CW agents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In trying to determine a material balance of the munitions which had existed in </p>
<p>1991, UNSCOM had been unable to account for some 16,000 unfilled munitions </p>
<p>and 550 munitions filled with mustard, primarily because of Iraq’s unilateral </p>
<p>destruction programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was also a “material balance” of around 4,000 tons of key precursor </p>
<p>chemicals.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Almost all of Iraq’s production equipment had been destroyed in the 1991 </p>
<p>conflict or subsequently under UN supervision.</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Iraq’s biological weapons programme was, however, an area which was “unredeemed </p>
<p>by progress or any approximation of the known facts of Iraq’s programme”. There was </p>
<p>“incomprehension” about Iraq’s persistence in “refusing to make the facts known” and why  </p>
<p>it was “so insistent on blocking the Commission’s own efforts to reach those facts”.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> A panel of experts drawn from 13 Member States of the Security Council had </p>
<p>unanimously concluded that Iraq’s latest FFCD was “not acceptable”. The declaration </p>
<p>was “incomplete”, had “significant inaccuracies”, and the outstanding problems with all </p>
<p>aspects of proscribed activity were “numerous and grave”. There were no insights into </p>
<p>the decisions to commence the biological weapons programme, or to conceal it between </p>
<p>1991 and 1995.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> In September, Mr Butler and Mr Aziz had agreed that the new FFCD on biological </p>
<p>weapons, and all other FFCDs in UNSCOM’s possession, should be regarded as final; </p>
<p>and that the Commission would not further assist Iraq in the formulation of its account.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> The report also stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Much greater resources could be required in the future to monitor and verify </p>
<p>dual-capable facilities and the export and import of dual-capable items.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The monitoring system could not be comprehensive until the Security Council </p>
<p>had been “able to conclude that Iraq’s prohibited programmes have been </p>
<p>destroyed, removed or rendered harmless” and the “full extent” of Iraq’s </p>
<p>prohibited programmes was known.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Government’s stated willingness to comply fully with the requirements </p>
<p>for monitoring had “not always been reflected, in practice, on the ground”. While </p>
<p>the number of incidents of concealment, deception and interference with the </p>
<p>inspections process were “relatively small”, they served to “reduce confidence in </p>
<p>Iraq’s commitment to the system”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was still “considerable uncertainty” about Iraq’s retention of prohibited </p>
<p>material and concealment systems.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s view was that, “were it to have full access to all relevant sites and </p>
<p>persons in Iraq”, it was “highly likely that proscribed items would be discovered”; </p>
<p>and that “Iraq’s actions to impede or block the Commission’s concealment </p>
<p>investigations” tended to “affirm this view”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “increasingly failed to apply or behave in conformity with the modalities </p>
<p>[agreed on 22 June]” and, “in more recent times”, had “sought both to exclude </p>
<p>them altogether with respect to certain sites and to define new categories of often </p>
<p>very large sites from which the Commission inspectors would be forbidden”.</p>
<p><b>336. </b> The report concluded that UNSCOM was “convinced” that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Security Council should “insist that Iraq meet its obligation to disclose fully </p>
<p>all of its prohibited weapons and associated programmes”. This was a “crucial </p>
<p>requirement” for which there was “no substitute”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “essential” for the Council to “reaffirm and demand Iraq’s complete </p>
<p>co-operation” with UNSCOM’s exercise of “its rights to full access to sites </p>
<p>and persons”.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> In a letter on 12 October, Mr Aziz set out Iraq’s concerns about UNSCOM activities </p>
<p>and the influence of the US and UK on UNSCOM’s approach, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US “in particular, together with Britain, were doing their utmost … to topple </p>
<p>the national Government of Iraq and to eliminate its national leadership”. That </p>
<p>“seriously affected the composition” of UNSCOM, with the US “leading the </p>
<p>hostile work against Iraq”. An activity which was “supposed to be international </p>
<p>and neutral” was “unbalanced”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US monopolised the intelligence means. Iraq wanted aerial surveillance </p>
<p>using a plane from a neutral state.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The justification for intrusive inspections was based on allegations of deliberate </p>
<p>concealment and inaccurate information which were themselves inaccurate and </p>
<p>being deliberately used by UNSCOM to procrastinate and to prolong the inspections </p>
<p>process. For example, the delay in analysing missile fragments had been caused </p>
<p>by UNSCOM’s original insistence that the analysis should be conducted in the US.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reports submitted to the Council were “tendentious”, using a method that </p>
<p>was “intended to confuse the past with what has been newly achieved, in a </p>
<p>manner that makes it difficult for the reader to differentiate between the positive </p>
<p>and negative aspects”; and that many of the reports were “inaccurate”. The </p>
<p>Security Council and international community “were being deliberately misled </p>
<p>with a view to fostering baseless suspicions about Iraq’s capabilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not been asked in 1992 to preserve the remnants of the special </p>
<p>warheads it had destroyed, and the subject had been “considered as closed” in </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s report in June 1995. In the absence of any missiles or means for </p>
<p>their delivery, the warheads had no operational value. The renewed focus on </p>
<p>special warheads was deliberately aimed at delay.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM should consider what had been achieved in relation to missiles </p>
<p>and chemical weapons as sufficient to meet Iraq’s obligations in section C of </p>
<p>resolution 687.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “ready to start serious and extensive work to address the biological </p>
<p>file in order to close it within a short time”. It had “completely destroyed” all the </p>
<p>biological agents in its possession and all “the sites, apparatuses and equipment </p>
<p>used in the production of biological agents”. All the 87 sites which UNSCOM </p>
<p>considered could be capable of dual use for the production of biological agent </p>
<p>were “under strict monitoring”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “ready to continue to work with the Special Commission in a serious, </p>
<p>scientific, technical and objective manner” to close the files “so that the Council </p>
<p>may proceed to implement its obligations towards Iraq” under paragraph 22 of </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991) (removal of the restrictions on trade in resolution 661).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The people of Iraq could not “continue suffering this injustice”. Iraq had “fulfilled </p>
<p>the obligations imposed on it” and the Security Council should do the same, </p>
<p>“starting at the earliest date”. If the “imbalance” continued, the “situation” would </p>
<p>become “absolutely unacceptable”.</p>

<p>IAEA REPORT, OCTOBER 1997</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Dr Blix submitted his final consolidated report as Director General of the IAEA on </p>
<p>6 October, which concluded that the IAEA investigation of Iraq’s nuclear programme had </p>
<p>reached the point of diminishing returns. The extent to which the remaining uncertainty </p>
<p>was acceptable was a political judgement.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> The Butler Report stated that, after 1995, the JIC consistently assessed that, “if </p>
<p>all United Nations controls on Iraq’s nuclear activities were removed, Iraq could possibly </p>
<p>develop a nuclear device in around five years”.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>340. </b> Dr Blix’s final consolidated report assessed that the IAEA had a “technically </p>
<p>coherent picture” which revealed a programme:</p>
<p>“… aimed at the production of an arsenal of nuclear weapons, based on implosion </p>
<p>technology, which had involved:</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Acquisition of non-weapon-usable nuclear material through indigenous </p>
<p>production and through overt and covert foreign procurement.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Research and development programmes into the full range of uranium </p>

<p>141</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Dr Blix added that the IAEA’s ability to understand the details of the programme </p>
<p>had been “severely hampered by Iraq’s persistence in a policy of concealment and </p>
<p>understatement of the programme’s scope and achievements”.</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The report included a summary of Iraq’s actions since 1991 and the IAEA’s </p>
<p>activities illustrating that point. Since May 1997, the IAEA had “received clarification </p>
<p>of many matters”, although it had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“not provided a comprehensive statement of the membership, terms of reference </p>
<p>and duration of authority of the Governmental Committee charged, <i>inter alia</i>, to </p>
<p>‘reduce the effect of NPT violation to the minimum’”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“stated that it has no further information regarding external assistance to its </p>
<p>clandestine nuclear programme”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“declared itself unable to describe the motives behind the actions ascribed to </p>
<p>the late Lt Gen Hussein Kamil which resulted in the concealment of the cache of </p>
<p>documentation, material and equipment ‘discovered’ at the Haider House farm”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“declined to include, in its FFCD a summary of the practical and theoretical </p>
<p>achievements of Iraq’s clandestine nuclear programme”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“yet to provide the promised written description of its post-war procurement </p>
<p>system”.</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Despite those issues, the IAEA report stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no indications to suggest Iraq was successful in its attempts to </p>
<p>produce nuclear weapons”, although there was “no documentation or other </p>
<p>evidence” which showed “the actual status of the weapon design when the </p>
<p>programme was interrupted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “at, or close to, the threshold of success in such areas as the </p>
<p>production of HEU [Highly Enriched Uranium] through the EMIS process, the </p>
<p>production and pilot … of … gas centrifuge machines, and the fabrication of the </p>
<p>explosive package for a nuclear weapon”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no indications” that Iraq had acquired other weapons-usable </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>All the “safeguarded research reactor fuel, including the HEU fuel that Iraq had </p>
<p>planned to divert to its ‘crash programme’, was verified and fully accounted for </p>
<p>by the IAEA and removed from Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no indications” that “any physical capability for the production of </p>
<p>amounts of weapons-usable nuclear material of any practical significance”.</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Dr Blix stated that there were “no indications of significant discrepancies” in Iraq’s </p>
<p>latest declaration.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> The report stated that a letter of 1 May from Iraq’s Minister of Foreign Affairs </p>
<p>reflected “Iraq’s unconditional reaffirmation of its obligations under the NPT” and “its </p>
<p>acceptance of its obligations, as interpreted by the IAEA, under Iraq’s Safeguards </p>
<p>Agreement with the Agency”.</p>
<p><b>346. </b> The report observed that:</p>
<p>“… taking into account the possibility, albeit remote, of undetected duplicate facilities </p>
<p>or the existence of anomalous activities or facilities outside this technically coherent </p>
<p>picture, no absolute assurances can be given with regard to the completeness of </p>
<p>Iraq’s FFCD. Some uncertainty is inevitable in any country-wide technical verification </p>
<p>process which aims to prove the absence of readily concealable objects or activities. </p>
<p>The extent to which such uncertainty is acceptable is a policy judgement.”</p>
<p><b>347. </b> The report said that the IAEA’s:</p>
<p>“… activities regarding the investigation of Iraq’s clandestine nuclear programme </p>
<p>have reached a point of diminishing returns … The IAEA is not ‘closing the books’ on </p>
<p>its investigation … and will continue to exercise its right to investigate any aspect of </p>
<p>Iraq’s clandestine nuclear programme, in particular, through the follow-up of any new </p>

<p><b>348. </b> In his memoir, Dr Blix wrote:</p>

<p>Members, abstained – China, Egypt, France, Kenya and Russia.</p>
<p><b>352. </b> Resolution 1134:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reaffirmed the Security Council’s “determination to ensure” Iraq’s “full </p>
<p>compliance … with all its obligations under all previous resolutions”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reiterated the Council’s “demand that Iraq allow immediate, unconditional and </p>

<p>… fixed wing and helicopter flights throughout Iraq for all relevant purposes … </p>
<p>without interferences of any kind and upon such terms and conditions as may be </p>
<p>determined by the Special Commission”.</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the measures adopted by the Council </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>condemning Iraq’s actions detailed in UNSCOM’s report of 6 October;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deciding that Iraq’s refusal to co-operate constituted a “flagrant violation” of its </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>demanding that Iraq should “co-operate fully with the Special Commission in </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>expressing the “firm intention”, if UNSCOM reported Iraq was not in compliance </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Sir John Weston stated that the “incidents described” in Mr Butler’s report of </p>
<p>6 October, and his inability to advise the Council that Iraq was “in substantial compliance </p>
<p>with the demands of resolution 1115”, were “adequate justification to move forward from </p>
<p>the decision” taken by the Council in June.</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Sir John added:</p>
<p>“We shall regret it if a few Council members, for whatever reasons of their own, </p>
<p>are unable to subscribe to this view. We have worked hard and in good faith to </p>
<p>accommodate all members’ preoccupations on the text. But we were not willing </p>
<p>to compromise the underlying purpose of the resolution or the responsibilities </p>
<p>of the … Council in order to appease Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>357. </b> Sir John also stated that Saddam Hussein had to take “the political decision </p>
<p>to co-operate fully” with UNSCOM, and that:</p>
<p>“The regularity with which this Council has had to address this issue confirms that </p>
<p>this decision has still not been taken. All we have heard from the Iraqi regime for the </p>
<p>past six and [a] half years are lies and empty promises, while on the ground they </p>
<p>have actively obstructed the Special Commission and concealed from it details of </p>
<p>its illegal weapons programmes. These facts are borne out in the latest report of </p>
<p>the Special Commission, which clearly states that, while progress has been made, </p>
<p>serious deficiencies remain in all three weapons areas, in particular on chemical and </p>
<p>biological warfare agents.”</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Sir John concluded that, “until and unless” Iraq co-operated and told “the whole </p>
<p>truth”, there could be “no prospect of the Council considering whether the demands </p>
<p>of Section C of … resolution 687 (1991)” had been met. He also referred to Iraq’s failure </p>
<p>to meet its obligations in relation to missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war and property.</p>
<p><b>359. </b> Ambassador Bill Richardson, US Permanent Representative to the UN, stated </p>
<p>that the Baghdad regime was the only party “responsible for this very sad state of </p>
<p>affairs”, and that it was refusing “to meet its most basic obligations, such as allowing </p>
<p>UNSCOM inspectors to carry out their Security Council mandate without obstruction </p>
<p>or harassment”. Mr Butler’s report recorded “a litany of Iraqi harassment, obfuscation, </p>
<p>obstruction and deception”. Iraq had explained its actions by attacking the credibility of </p>
<p>UNSCOM and questioning its judgement, and when that did not work, resorting to “time </p>
<p>honoured tactics of bullying, burning and blackmailing”.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> Ambassador Richardson added:</p>
<p>“Compliance with international obligations is not a voluntary act. Co-operation </p>
<p>is not a matter of degree. Either Iraq is in compliance … or it is in breach of </p>
<p>those obligations.”</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Ambassador Richardson challenged the description of Iraq’s “so-called </p>
<p>co-operation over the past six months”, which was “too little, too late”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>362. </b> Addressing comments by other members of the Council about Dr Blix’s report, </p>
<p>Ambassador Richardson stated:</p>
<p>“… even in this area it is clear that Iraq has not answered all the relevant questions </p>
<p>necessary to have a full accounting of its programmes. The books cannot be closed. </p>
<p>Furthermore, we now know, thanks to the efforts of Mr Blix and his staff, that Iraq </p>
<p>lied and concealed an active weaponization programme for years in direct defiance </p>
<p>of its commitments under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons </p>
<p>(NPT) and its commitments to the IAEA. Iraq has lied about its programmes for too </p>
<p>long and too recently for us to settle for anything less than absolute certainty that </p>
<p>Iraq’s nuclear ambitions have been completely neutralized.</p>
<p>“When accounting for nuclear weapons, close is not good enough. If you fail </p>
<p>to account for just one nuclear device, that could mean the destruction of an </p>
<p>entire city.”</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Ambassador Richardson concluded that Baghdad had “a clear and simple choice” </p>
<p>while commending the approach of Mr Butler and his team and stating that the Council </p>
<p>“must do everything” it could to support him. He regretted the decision of some members </p>
<p>of the Council not to support the resolution, which would “carry the full weight of </p>
<p>international law”.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Japan, Poland, Portugal and Sweden spoke in support of the resolution, but in </p>
<p>more moderate terms than either the US or UK.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Elaraby drew attention to Dr Blix’s report and the progress in some areas </p>
<p>reported by Mr Butler, and set out conclusions in seven areas that Egypt would have </p>
<p>liked to see included in the resolution for the evaluation of the implementation of the </p>
<p>Council’s resolutions and the Council’s future actions. These were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The draft resolution should have taken into account the positive aspects </p>
<p>reported by UNSCOM and the IAEA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council “must be the only body responsible” for making decisions, “following </p>
<p>consultations and discussions on the basis of reports submitted by the Special </p>
<p>Commission”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA and Special Commission were responsible for “purely technical </p>
<p>matters”. While it was “difficult” for them “to assert that nothing remains to be </p>
<p>destroyed” it was “important” for the Council to take the decision “defining the </p>
<p>ultimate goal of the activities of those two bodies in order that the Council’s </p>
<p>resolutions can be fully implemented in detail”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council should “take the time … objectively” to study the differences in </p>
<p>view between the Special Commission and Iraq about the interpretation of the </p>
<p>modalities for inspections. Further co-operation was needed from Iraq, but the </p>
<p>Special Commission also had to “make an effort” to co-operate so that it could </p>
<p>discharge its responsibilities.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reports contained sporadic instances of non-co-operation; but the question </p>
<p>was whether that was “recurring, systematic non-co-operation” and if it indicated </p>
<p>“a real pattern of unwillingness to comply” or “isolated instances of differences”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Egypt was opposed in principle to additional sanctions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council should have mandated the UN Sanctions Committee to determine </p>
<p>clear criteria for the modalities for the implementation of the resolution so that </p>
<p>the Council could “avoid contributing to aggravating the tensions between Iraq </p>
<p>and the Special Commission, which could complicate the task of eliminating </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Elaraby concluded by stating that Egypt had asked for more time for “calm and </p>
<p>constructive dialogue”, but the sponsors of the resolution:</p>
<p>“… had insisted on it being put to the vote … without taking into account the majority </p>
<p>of the proposals put forward in recent days … so that the draft resolution would </p>
<p>respect logic, legality and the provisions of resolution 1115 … and … inspire the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to co-operate more fully with the Special Commission.”</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Kipkorir Aly Azad Rana, Kenyan Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>stated that he would abstain because the draft resolution did not “clearly portray the </p>
<p>balance and tone of the reports” from the IAEA and UNSCOM.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Mr Liu Jieyi, Counsellor, Permanent Mission of China to the UN, stated that the </p>
<p>priority should be to enhance the co-operation between Iraq and UNSCOM and that he </p>
<p>would abstain because the draft resolution was “not conducive to the settlement of the </p>
<p>problems concerned” and amendments proposed by “quite a number of delegations” </p>
<p>had not been accepted.</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that the IAEA and UNSCOM had recently produced “voluminous </p>
<p>comprehensive reports on the significant work done on filling in the blank spaces in the </p>
<p>Iraq disarmament dossier”. The UNSCOM report had noted “significant” and “important” </p>
<p>progress, particularly in the missile and chemical areas, and the IAEA report “had </p>
<p>a positive tone”. Iraq had not accounted for all the items proscribed by section C of </p>
<p>resolution 687, and a number of questions remained “to be clarified in the biological </p>
<p>sphere”. There were “deficiencies” in Iraq’s compliance and “isolated incidents”, but </p>
<p>that could not “justify the immediate adoption of additional sanctions”. The problems </p>
<p>should be addressed within the framework of planned consultations between Mr Butler </p>
<p>and Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Lavrov added that there was “an obvious lack of balance” in the draft resolution </p>
<p>which “Ignored … various substantial elements of the fulfilment by Iraq of relevant </p>
<p>provisions of resolution 687”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Russia could not understand why there was “no mention of the IAEA report” and </p>
<p>the significant progress on the Iraqi nuclear dossier, which could be “viewed as closed”. </p>
<p>Mr Lavrov stated:</p>
<p>“The sponsors’ categorical refusal to refer to the IAEA report in the draft resolution </p>
<p>raises most serious questions and is unacceptable to us.”</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr Lavrov also pointed out that resolution 1115 had required “substantial </p>
<p>compliance” by Iraq with UNSCOM’s requirements for access; and that continued in </p>
<p>effect. The new resolution’s requirements would “confuse the criteria” for compliance </p>
<p>with the UN’s resolutions.</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Lavrov concluded that Russia had been “prepared to continue working on the </p>
<p>draft in order to make it more balanced and acceptable to all members of the Security </p>
<p>Council”, but the sponsors were “unfortunately” not ready to do so. Russia was “forced </p>
<p>to abstain”.</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Mr Alain Dejammet, French Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that </p>
<p>France had abstained “on a consideration of the merits of the text of the resolution” and </p>
<p>the importance of the principle of “seeking unity within the Council”, both to “underline </p>
<p>the authority” of UNSCOM’s actions and because France considered that unity had </p>
<p>“contributed to the achievement of the significant progress” noted in UNSCOM’s report. </p>
<p>France also thought that Mr Butler “should have received some encouragement, </p>
<p>however modest, to continue with his efforts and enhance further the effectiveness </p>
<p>of the Special Commission’s co-operation with Iraq”.</p>
<p>CONTINUED IRAQI NON-CO-OPERATION</p>

<p><b>377. </b> Mr Aziz added that the decision would take effect the following day. He also </p>
<p>requested UNSCOM to withdraw its cover for U-2 flights, which “had been spying on Iraq </p>
<p>and its leadership in order to execute America’s hostile policy against Iraq under cover of </p>
<p>the Special Commission’s operations”.</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Mr Aziz wrote that Iraq was “confident” that it was “free of proscribed weapons” and </p>
<p>had “no apprehension of actions to verify that by all practical means”. He emphasised </p>
<p>Iraq’s “sincere desire for continuing the co-operation with the Special Commission” </p>
<p>to fulfil its obligations, and demanded that the Security Council fulfil its obligations.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> A Presidential Statement issued after a meeting of the Security Council to consider </p>
<p>Iraq’s “unacceptable decision … to seek to impose conditions on its co-operation with </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>recalled the Security Council demands in resolution 1134 “that Iraq co-operate </p>
<p>fully with the Special Commission in accordance with the relevant resolutions”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>condemned “the decision … to try to dictate the terms of its compliance with its </p>
<p>obligation to co-operate”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demanded that “Iraq co-operate fully … without conditions or restrictions”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reminded Iraq “of its responsibility for the safety and security” of UNSCOM </p>

<p>fully with its obligations under the relevant resolutions”.</p>

<p>“In the light of current developments, Iraq anticipates that the United States will </p>

<p>“Baghdad … was clearly determined to re-engage the UN at a senior level, namely </p>

<p>was not seeking confrontation; it had implemented all Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>without receiving adequate respect for its sovereignty, integrity, and security; </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Mr Butler sent a separate letter on 5 November, informing the President of the </p>
<p>Security Council that, in response to a request from the UN Secretary-General, he had </p>
<p>decided to postpone the U-2 flights on 5 and 7 November while Mr Annan’s Personal </p>
<p>Envoys were delivering a message to Iraq; but that the flights would resume the </p>
<p>following week.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>389. </b> On 6 November, Iraq informed the President of the Security Council that it had </p>
<p>requested US personnel not to enter a site, but UNSCOM had instructed the team </p>
<p>to withdraw.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> The letter added that, as a precaution against the possibility of US </p>
<p>attacks, Iraq had moved equipment but the items would be returned for inspection </p>
<p>and authentication and it would not be used for proscribed activities.</p>
<p><b>390. </b> The letter concluded by stating that Iraq was “honouring our obligations under </p>
<p>the monitoring plan” in resolution 715.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> On 7 November, Mr Butler reported further incidents on 6 November and also drew </p>
<p>attention to a further Iraqi request for cancellations of U-2 flights and to concerns about </p>
<p>the visibility or absence of equipment being monitored by UNSCOM cameras.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>392. </b> On 10 November, Mr Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf, the Iraqi Minister for Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs, wrote to Mr Annan reporting that a “United States U-2 spy plane together with </p>
<p>several formations of United States warplanes fitted with all kinds of weapons and </p>
<p>espionage equipment” had “violated” Iraq’s airspace and sovereignty that morning. </p>
<p>As a result it was “no longer to be considered, even nominally or formally, as one of </p>
<p>the means used by the United Nations to conduct so-called inspections”. Iraq would </p>
<p>act against US aircraft to safeguard its sovereignty and security.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p><b>393. </b> In a briefing for members of the Council on 10 November, Mr Annan stated that, </p>
<p>“Had Iraq agreed to return to full compliance”, he would have had “no hesitation” in </p>
<p>recommending that Iraq should be “granted a hearing”.</p>

<p>RESOLUTION 1137 (1997)</p>
<p><b>396. </b> On 12 November, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1137 </p>
<p>(1997), which:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recalled the Council’s previous resolutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated its “grave concern” about recent developments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>condemned Iraq’s continued violation of its obligations, “including its </p>
<p>unacceptable decision … to seek to impose conditions on co-operation” with </p>
<p>UNSCOM;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demanded Iraq rescind its decision of 29 October; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decided to impose a travel ban on designated Iraqi officials, as foreshadowed in </p>
<p>resolution 1134.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>397. </b> The resolution also expressed the Council’s “firm intention to take further measures </p>
<p>as may be required for the implementation of this resolution”.</p>
<p><b>398. </b> In statements to the Council before and after the vote, all members of the Council </p>
<p>supported united action and targeted sanctions in response to Iraq’s defiance of the UN, </p>
<p>but significant differences in position remained.</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Elaraby drew attention to the impact of sanctions on the Iraqi people and the </p>
<p>lack of hope that they would be lifted.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> Iraq’s co-operation had “not been ideal”, but it </p>
<p>had gone a long way. Iraq’s defiance and failure to respond to attempts to persuade it </p>
<p>to change its position were unwise because it meant “squandering the achievements </p>
<p>made on Iraq’s long road of co-operation with the Special Commission”. There </p>
<p>were lessons from the crisis, including that the Council should “review” UNSCOM’s </p>
<p>methods. Iraq should not be pushed “into believing that it has nothing to gain from </p>
<p>its continued co-operation with the Commission and nothing to lose from a cessation </p>
<p>of that co-operation”.</p>
<p><b>400. </b> Mr Njuguna Mahugu, Kenyan Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that </p>
<p>the current level of tension “must not be allowed to escalate any further”.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Dejammet stated that he had believed reason would prevail and regretted </p>
<p>Iraq’s refusal to rescind its decision. A “strong and unanimous reaction” was required, </p>
<p>but it had to be “balanced and commensurate with the realities of the situation”. The </p>
<p>“search for a peaceful solution” would not be hampered by the travel bans, and France </p>
<p>continued “to advocate strongly that any action” should be “considered and led strictly </p>
<p>within the framework of the Security Council”. The resolution did not “encourage </p>
<p>or justify any escalation”. The Council should “persevere” in an “active search for </p>
<p>a diplomatic solution”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Mr Dejammet added that the “basic goal” was continuing the work of the </p>
<p>Commission:</p>
<p>“Nothing would be worse than to call into question the main strength of resolution </p>
<p>687 (1991) and United Nations relations with Iraq. The system of ongoing verification </p>
<p>and monitoring cannot be suspended; the security of the region is at stake.”</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Dejammet said that unanimity of the Council in a crisis was a “very important </p>
<p>condition” for France. If Iraq heeded the message from the Council it would “be possible </p>
<p>to discuss their concerns regarding the working methods of the Special Commission and </p>
<p>the manner in which it discharges its responsibilities”. There could also be discussions </p>
<p>to “explore prospects for resolving the crisis and to take into account the significant </p>
<p>progress … on the substance, notably on the nuclear and ballistic areas”. The Iraqi </p>
<p>population had paid an “exorbitant price”, which could not “go on rising indefinitely, </p>
<p>amidst general indifference”.</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Ambassador Richardson stated that the “unambiguous message to the leaders </p>
<p>of Iraq” was that the Security Council was “united in its determination that Iraq must </p>
<p>comply with the resolutions of the Council”; and that there would be “consequences for </p>
<p>Iraq if it fails to do so”. Mr Aziz had been in New York lobbying for sanctions to be lifted, </p>
<p>but Iraq did not “seem to understand that its objective can only be reached through full </p>
<p>compliance”.</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Ambassador Richardson added that Iraq had, for years, been “trying every trick </p>
<p>to deceive” UNSCOM. Its actions were “gross violations” of its obligations. Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… failed in other areas mandated by the Council and it has given no sign that </p>
<p>it will cease activities and policies intended to threaten its neighbours. Indeed, it </p>
<p>gives every indication that it intends to continue to develop a dangerous arsenal </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction. Which is what this is all about.”</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Ambassador Richardson said that the US felt “compassion for the Iraqi people and </p>
<p>empathy for their plight”, and looked forward to sanctions being lifted, but Iraq had first to </p>
<p>“comply fully and unconditionally with … relevant … resolutions”.</p>
<p><b>407. </b> Referring to a statement by Mr Robin Cook (the Foreign Secretary), Mr Stephen </p>
<p>Gomersall (UK Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN in New York) stated that </p>
<p>the UN had responded “swiftly, strongly and unanimously” to “provocation”. If Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein returned to his senses and let UNSCOM resume its work, and then complied </p>
<p>with all relevant resolutions, the process for lifting sanctions could be started. But if he </p>
<p>continued to defy the will of the UN, “further measures” would be taken.</p>
<p><b>408. </b> The Council was facing “the most serious challenge” from Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>since the end of the Gulf Conflict. The successful completion of UNSCOM’s work was </p>
<p>“essential for maintaining regional and international peace and security”, and its latest </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>report made clear that there was much to be done, “especially” on chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> There had been a lot of “special pleading from Iraq on the damage caused by six </p>
<p>and a half years of sanctions” but it was:</p>
<p>“… clear that the humanitarian interests of the Iraqi people and their welfare have </p>
<p>been subordinated to the misguided policies of the leadership and that it is these </p>
<p>policies which are the fundamental problem.”</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that Russia had been “working intensively” with others </p>
<p>to “de-escalate the situation”, but had failed to achieve the desired results. The </p>
<p>Security Council had “no other way out than to adopt concrete measures on the </p>
<p>basis of the consensus … established in June … in resolution 1115”.</p>
<p><b>411. </b> But Russia was “convinced” that any “complications” should be:</p>
<p>“… resolved exclusively by political means and strictly within the framework of the </p>
<p>relevant resolutions of the Security Council. Any other approaches, particularly </p>
<p>actions involving force or the threat of the use of force, could nullify all our </p>
<p>achievements so far in reaching a post-crisis settlement in the Persian Gulf and take </p>
<p>us all a long way back from the goal, already coming within our reach, of eliminating </p>
<p>the threat to peace and security in that region.”</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Lavrov added that the resolution ruled out “the possibility of using the authority </p>
<p>of the Security Council and the United Nations to justify any attempts to use force”.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Mr Lavrov concluded that inspections had:</p>
<p>“… confirmed that Iraq has no proscribed activities going on involving nuclear </p>
<p>weapons, and the facilities and dual-use equipment are being reliably monitored. In </p>
<p>this connection, the nuclear dossier can be deemed to be closed. The balance sheet </p>
<p>is virtually completed on proscribed missiles. All capacity and components for the </p>
<p>production of chemical weapons have been eliminated.</p>
<p>“Such serious results cannot pass by without adequate evaluation by the Security </p>
<p>Council. We intend to revert to this question immediately after the current crisis </p>
<p>situation around Iraq has been resolved.”</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Qin Huasun stated that China had called on Iraq to resume co-operation with </p>
<p>the United Nations but had “always been of the view that Iraq’s sovereignty, territorial </p>
<p>integrity and legitimate concerns for its own security should be respected”. He observed </p>
<p>that the “causes of the current crisis” were “multifaceted and complex”: “three feet of ice </p>
<p>could not have accumulated as a result of one day’s cold weather”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Qin Huasun suggested:</p>
<p>“The Security Council should hear the views of UNSCOM and Iraq on the question </p>
<p>of inspections in order to make a fair and reasonable judgement on progress </p>
<p>achieved in inspections. Problems … should be appropriately settled through </p>
<p>dialogue and co-operation. We are opposed to the use or the threat of force or any </p>
<p>actions that might further exacerbate tensions. We hope that the parties concerned </p>
<p>will exercise restraint and find a proper solution to the problem through co-operation </p>
<p>and dialogue and avoid the escalation of tensions. In particular, the occurrence of </p>
<p>armed conflict must be avoided.”</p>
<p><b>416. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote:</p>
<p>“In late 1997, it was clear the United States had lost patience with the inspections </p>
<p>process and was agitating for military action or full Iraqi compliance. UN inspectors </p>
<p>… destroyed more weapons of mass destruction than the coalition had during the </p>
<p>Gulf War … despite … the regime’s attitude … By this time, Iraq had identified a </p>
<p>new reason to resist co-operation; namely, the national security and dignity of its </p>
<p>Presidential sites … I knew Saddam had to open these … [to inspection], but I also </p>
<p>felt deeply uneasy that the world could go to war over this issue …”</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>417. </b> In response to Russian diplomatic activity, Iraq agreed to allow UNSCOM </p>
<p>to resume its activities in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> During a visit to Moscow on 18 to 19 November, Mr Aziz and Mr Yevgeny </p>
<p>Primakov, the Russian Foreign Minister, agreed that Iraq would allow the return </p>
<p>of UNSCOM from 20 November.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>419. </b> The Joint Communiqué stated that Russia would:</p>
<p>“… actively contribute, on the basis of Iraq’s implementation of the relevant Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions, towards a quick lifting of the sanctions imposed on Iraq, </p>
<p>especially the implementation of paragraph 22 of resolution 687, to the letter and </p>
<p>without additional conditions.”</p>
<p><b>420. <i></b> The</i> <i>Moscow Times</i> reported that Mr Primakov had been very careful to observe </p>
<p>the substance of UN policy on Iraq, and that he had warned Iraq not to expect an end </p>
<p>to economic sanctions until it had closed down its chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>programmes.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> The composition of UN inspections teams would be slightly adjusted, </p>
<p>but would retain many US inspectors.</p>

<p><b>423. </b> In relation to nuclear weapons, the members of the Commission understood, from </p>
<p>a presentation made by the IAEA, that:</p>

<p>[of 8 October] are satisfactorily provided, and if Iraq were to co-operate in the use </p>

<p>clarification of and accounting for Iraq’s indigenous production of proscribed </p>
<p>missiles, conventional and special missile warheads, and major missile parts;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent of Iraq’s efforts to produce and weaponise VX;</p>

<p>102</p>
<p><b>435. </b> In a Statement by the President of the Security Council, issued after consultations </p>
<p>on Mr Butler’s report on 22 December, the Council reiterated its demand that Iraq </p>
<p>co-operate fully with UNSCOM and allow inspection teams “immediate, unconditional </p>
<p>access”, and stated that any failure to do so would be “unacceptable and a clear </p>
<p>violation of the relevant resolutions”. The Council also acknowledged that discussions on </p>
<p>the practical arrangements were continuing, reiterated its full support for the Commission </p>
<p>and Mr Butler, and called on the Government of Iraq to co-operate fully.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>436. </b> On 12 January 1998, the Government of Iraq announced that, on the basis of </p>
<p>the nationalities present, a team would not be permitted to conduct further inspections </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>437. </b> On 14 January, the President of the Security Council issued a further statement </p>
<p>deploring the Iraqi statement of 12 January and its “subsequent failure to fulfil its </p>
<p>obligations to provide the Special Commission with full, unconditional, and immediate </p>
<p>access to all sites”. The Council determined that “failure” was “unacceptable and a clear </p>
<p>violation of the relevant resolutions”.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>438. </b> The Council also:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recalled its statement of 29 October 1997 condemning Iraq’s decision to try to </p>
<p>dictate the terms of its compliance with its obligations to co-operate with UNSCOM;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reiterated its demand in resolution 1137 for co-operation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expressed its full support for the Special Commission and its Executive </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>requested a “full briefing” from Mr Butler after his planned talks with Iraq so that </p>
<p>it could “decide as necessary on the appropriate response”.</p>

<p> The purpose of the visit had been to clarify five </p>
<p>points identified in paragraph 75 of the earlier report, specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… information provided by Iraq in respect of its post-war procurement procedures </p>

<p>its statements regarding the “government committee” or of the actions attributed </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had “no information that contradicts Iraq’s statement that it had </p>

<p><b>442. </b> Iraq also rejected a request to allow the Commission’s fixed-wing aircraft to </p>

<p>“We have a clear responsibility in the interests of long term peace in the world to stop </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein from defying the judgement of the world’s community. He must </p>
<p>be either persuaded by diplomacy or made by force to yield up his long cherished </p>
<p>ambition to develop nuclear, chemical and biological weapons; weapons which </p>

<p>175</p>
<p>In his press conference on 20 December 1998, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“… the patience of the international community cannot be tried indefinitely … when </p>
<p>it is right and when the will of the international community is at stake we will act to </p>

<p>discussions on Iraq; 10 in Cabinet, of which seven had “some substance”; five in the </p>
<p>Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP); and six ad hoc meetings, including </p>
<p>one JIC briefing.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Iraq was discussed in one of Lord Wilson’s first Cabinet meetings on 28 January </p>
<p>1998.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> Lord Wilson recalled that Mr Cook told his colleagues things which were </p>
<p>“entirely recognisable four or five years later”, namely:</p>
<p>“… a serious situation is building; we would be ready to use force if necessary, </p>
<p>because not being ready to use force would undermine our leverage over Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein; and thirdly, the United States were clear that they had legal authority to </p>
<p>take action whereas our legal advice was more nuanced.”</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Lord Wilson commented that those points could be transposed to March 2002.</p>
<p><b>446. </b> The Cabinet Office has informed the Inquiry that there was no discussion of Iraq in </p>
<p>DOP in 1999 or 2000, and that the four discussions in Cabinet in early 1999 (the last on </p>
<p>7 March) were confined to brief updates on the NFZs. There is no record of any Cabinet </p>
<p>discussion of Iraq in 2000.</p>

<p>105</p>
<p><b>448. </b>  Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote </p>
<p>in his diary on 2 February:</p>
<p>“Iraq was the main focus with the French and Russians trying to get a diplomatic </p>
<p>solution, but TB was pretty clear where it was heading.”</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>449. </b> The Butler Report stated that the JIC concluded on 4 February that:</p>
<p>“UNSCOM and the IAEA have succeeded in destroying or controlling the vast </p>
<p>majority of Saddam Hussein’s 1991 weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </p>
<p>programme.”</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>450. </b> On the same date, Mr Campbell recorded: “We turned the factual briefing into </p>
<p>a paper for the media showing the extent of Saddam’s capability and the damage </p>
<p>he could do.”</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>451. </b> During Defence Questions on 9 February, Mr George Robertson, the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary, told the House of Commons that he was making available new information </p>
<p>on Iraq’s chemical weapons capability at the time of the Gulf War, concerning “recently </p>
<p>received intelligence that Iraq may have possessed large quantities of a chemical </p>
<p>weapons agent known as Agent 15 since the 1980s”.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> Mr Robertson described Agent </p>
<p>15 as “a mental incapacitant”.</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Mr Campbell recorded that Mr Blair chaired the first meeting of the Iraq media </p>
<p>management group on 16 February, and was “alarmed at how poor the FCO/MOD </p>
<p>propaganda effort was”.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>453. </b> On 19 February, Mr Campbell recorded that Cabinet was “mainly Iraq and Ireland”, </p>
<p>and that Mr Blair said “it was not an option to do nothing. We either got the inspectors in </p>
<p>or we had to take action.” Mr Blair was concerned that “Saddam would pitch a response </p>
<p>perfectly to Kofi … to get the French and Russians into a different position to the rest of </p>
<p>us.” That concern was also discussed in a call with President Bill Clinton on 22 February.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> On 20 February, the Security Council adopted resolution 1153 (1998) which </p>
<p>increased the size of the Oil-for-Food programme, “to avoid any further deterioration </p>
<p>of the current humanitarian situation”.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>455. </b> On 23 February, Mr Annan obtained an undertaking from the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>to resume co-operation. In an MOU signed by Mr Annan and Mr Aziz, the Government </p>
<p>of Iraq reconfirmed “its acceptance of all relevant resolutions of the Security Council” </p>

<p>and undertook “to accord UNSCOM and the IAEA immediate, unconditional and </p>
<p>unrestricted access”.</p>
<p><b>456. </b> The MOU contained details of special procedures for the inspection of the </p>
<p>eight Presidential sites, including having diplomats, not just technical experts, in the </p>
<p>inspection teams.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Mr Annan wrote that Secretary Albright had travelled to New York on 22 February </p>
<p>to set out “red lines” before he left for Baghdad. He had “had to remind her” of his role </p>
<p>and that, as Secretary-General, he was “answerable to 191 other Member States” and </p>
<p>that it was his “duty to seek peaceful resolution of disputes”. His objective had been to </p>
<p>give Saddam Hussein a ladder to climb down so that inspections could resume.</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Mr Annan wrote that he considered it “critical” that Iraq was “given a sense of light </p>
<p>at the end of the tunnel” as an incentive to co-operate with an inspections regime that </p>
<p>required “a degree of scrutiny without precedent”, and that the talk in Washington of </p>
<p>never lifting sanctions was not helpful:</p>
<p>“The United States and its allies were entitled to state this position as a matter </p>
<p>of national interest. However, they could not expect to have a United Nations </p>
<p>committed to the peaceful disarmament of Iraq to simply play along. Nor could they </p>
<p>have been unaware that this gave Saddam the excuse to tell the rest of the world </p>
<p>that the game was fixed no matter what he did. We need the inspections to work </p>
<p>toward resolving the ongoing crisis in Iraq. Until then, the Gulf War would not truly </p>
<p>be over.”</p>
<p><b>459. </b> In a statement to the House of Commons on 24 February, Mr Blair said the </p>
<p>UN inspectors had found and destroyed “horrific amounts of chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons … despite systematic obstruction, deceit and concealment by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein”. The crisis over access to Presidential palaces had “not been an artificial </p>
<p>argument about some theoretical threat, but a reflection of real alarm … about the use </p>
<p>of those sites to conceal both evidence and actual weapons”.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“We should never forget that if we do not stop Saddam Hussein acting in breach </p>
<p>of his agreement on weapons of mass destruction, the losers will not just be those </p>
<p>threatened by him, but the authority and standing of the UN itself …”</p>
<p>189</p>

<p>“Throughout the dispute, our aim has been a peaceful, diplomatic settlement. There </p>
<p>was no desire on either side of the Atlantic to use force, but it was also clear to us </p>
<p>throughout that Saddam Hussein only understands and respects force …</p>
<p>“… As Kofi Annan said in Baghdad: ‘You can achieve much by diplomacy, but you </p>
<p>can achieve a lot more when diplomacy is backed by firmness and force.’</p>

<p>RESOLUTION 1154 (1998)</p>
<p><b>464. </b> On 2 March, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1154 (1998).</p>

<p> It:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>stated that “any violation would have severest consequences for Iraq”;</p>

<p>reaffirmed its intention to act in accordance with the relevant provisions of </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>UN Security Council resolution 1154 (1998).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>there had been significant tensions about the Secretary-General’s mission and the text </p>
<p>of the draft resolution co-sponsored by the UK and Japan.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> Tensions centred on the </p>
<p>Security Council determining whether the use of force was appropriate and authorising </p>
<p>such action, not individual Member States.</p>
<p><b>466. </b> In his statement to the Council, Mr Annan stated that, in travelling to Baghdad </p>
<p>to seek a peaceful solution to the crisis, he had acted to fulfil his:</p>
<p>“… constitutional obligation under the United Nations Charter and … commitment </p>
<p>to the General Assembly … a sacred, moral obligation and commitment to act, any </p>
<p>time, anywhere, without seeking or accepting instructions from any Government, </p>
<p>whenever that action may be helpful in reducing a grave threat to international peace </p>
<p>and security.”</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Annan added that Iraq’s refusal to honour its commitments had constituted </p>
<p>such a threat which had been averted by the agreement of 23 February. But the </p>
<p>agreement would be “empty words unless both parties now implement it fully, fairly </p>
<p>and without delay”.</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Iraq’s “complete fulfilment” of those obligations was “the one and only aim” of the </p>
<p>agreement, and “nothing more and nothing less” would make the completion of the </p>
<p>disarmament process possible and “thus speed the lifting of sanctions”.</p>
<p><b>469. </b> The agreement was also a call for the UN to look to the future and its “inherent </p>
<p>obligation to remember that even the bitterest of enmities among nations do not last </p>
<p>for ever”.</p>
<p><b>470. </b> Mr Annan said that the agreement was also a reminder of why the UN had been </p>
<p>established:</p>
<p>“… to prevent the outbreak of unnecessary conflict when the will of the international </p>
<p>community can be achieved through diplomacy; to seek and find international </p>
<p>solutions to international problems; to obtain respect for international law and </p>
<p>agreements from a recalcitrant party without destroying for ever that party’s dignity </p>
<p>and willingness to co-operate; to secure, in this case, through on-site inspections </p>
<p>and negotiations, the assured destruction of weapons of mass destruction that aerial </p>
<p>bombardment can never achieve.”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> In conclusion, Mr Annan pledged “to strive, to seek to find and not to yield” in the </p>
<p>fulfilment of his duty.</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Sir John Weston described the crisis which had led to Mr Annan’s “last ditch effort </p>
<p>to find a diplomatic solution” as “just the latest and the most serious in a series of Iraqi </p>
<p>provocations”. His success was “not a success for diplomacy alone but a success for </p>
<p>194 </p>
<p>UN Security Council, ‘3858th Meeting Monday 2 March 1998’ (S/PV.3858).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>diplomacy firmly backed by the willingness to use force if diplomacy should fail”, and </p>
<p>no one could “seriously imagine” the same result without that.</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Sir John said that there were two important messages in the resolution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was obliged to provide access at all sites, “not just in the eight so-called </p>
<p>Presidential sites which have up to now been the pretext for so much delay and </p>
<p>obstruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime had a choice. If it fulfilled its commitments, the way would </p>
<p>“be open for the lifting of sanctions”; but if it failed to comply, that would “not </p>
<p>be tolerated”. The Council was “determined that any violation will result in the </p>
<p>severest consequences”.</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Sir John concluded that, if Iraq doubted the will of the international community, </p>
<p>it would:</p>
<p>“… not for the first time, be making a grave mistake.</p>
<p>“There is a great need at such moments to face up with courage and intellectual </p>
<p>honesty to unpalatable truths. Regional security, the future of non-proliferation </p>
<p>under international auspices, and the authority of the United Nations and its </p>
<p>Secretary-General are all involved, and are all at stake, in our collective efforts </p>
<p>to get the case of Iraq right.”</p>
<p><b>475. </b> Welcoming Mr Annan’s success and the text of the draft resolution, Mr Fernando </p>
<p>Berrocal Soto, Costa Rican Permanent Representative to the UN, emphasised the “key </p>
<p>concept of international legality and the primacy of the provisions of the Charter over </p>
<p>any political considerations”. Bringing the MOU agreed on 23 February into the legal </p>
<p>framework authorised by Chapter VII left “no political or legal doubt whatsoever about </p>
<p>the seriousness and gravity of this warning by the Security Council”. The “prerogatives </p>
<p>and legal competences” were “exclusively of the Security Council” and could not be </p>
<p>delegated.</p>
<p><b>476. </b> Mr Celso Amorim, Brazilian Permanent Representative to the UN, referred </p>
<p>to the strain the crisis had placed on a multilateral system “still learning to cope </p>
<p>with the challenges of the post-cold-war era” and the Security Council’s wisdom in </p>
<p>encouraging the Secretary-General to “undertake a personal mission”. Mr Annan had </p>
<p>“succeeded in a mission that sceptics had considered doomed from the start”; and his </p>
<p>“determination … to keep this matter under his close personal supervision … provides </p>
<p>the Security Council with a fair chance to put the problem of the relations between Iraq </p>
<p>and the United Nations on a more stable foundation”.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Amorim also pointed out that, in resolution 687, the Security Council had </p>
<p>decided “to take such further steps as may be required for the implementation of the </p>
<p>present resolution”, rather than the “ritual formula” of deciding to “remain seized of the </p>
<p>matter”. As a result, he concluded that:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>“Only the Security Council has the authority to determine if, when and under what </p>
<p>conditions the formal cease-fire it declared on 3 April 1991 holds or not.”</p>
<p><b>478. </b> Mr Amorim added that members of the Council had been “assured by its sponsors” </p>
<p>that they did not intend the draft resolution “to imply any automaticity in the authorisation </p>
<p>of the use of force in case of a possible violation by Iraq”. Brazil was satisfied that </p>
<p>nothing in the resolution delegated the “authority” that belonged to the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>479. </b> Mr Hans Dahlgren, Swedish Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that it </p>
<p>was “very important” that the Council’s responsibility for international peace and security </p>
<p>was “not circumvented”, and that the last paragraph of the draft resolution was “an </p>
<p>expression of the need to safeguard this responsibility”.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> Mr Hisashi Owada, Japanese Permanent Representative to the UN, emphasised </p>
<p>that paragraph 3 of the resolution reflected the Council’s wish “to register its firm resolve </p>
<p>that violation …. would have the severest consequences for Iraq” but that it was “not </p>
<p>meant to address the issue of so-called automaticity”; the draft resolution was “not </p>
<p>designed to prejudge the issues of the future”.</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Qin Huasun stated that China greatly appreciated “the wise decision made </p>
<p>by the Secretary-General at the critical juncture between war and peace” and that it </p>
<p>supported his diplomatic efforts. He added:</p>
<p>“The situation in the Gulf region is complex and sensitive. If it is dealt with </p>
<p>appropriately there will be peace. Any imprudence, however, may trigger a war, </p>
<p>which is in no one’s interest … We are not in favour of resorting to or threatening </p>
<p>to use force … It would only cause heavy civilian casualties and possibly even more </p>
<p>severe consequences.”</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Qin Huasun added that the Chinese delegation had “repeatedly and </p>
<p>unambiguously demanded that the draft resolution should contain no automatic </p>
<p>authorisation of the use of force against Iraq”. He had “listened very carefully to the </p>
<p>explanations offered by the sponsors of the draft resolution”, but they had not eliminated </p>
<p>his “misgivings about the possible abuse of the draft resolution”.</p>
<p><b>483. </b> Mr Qin Huasun stressed that adoption of the resolution would:</p>
<p>“… in no way mean that the Security Council is automatically authorising any State </p>
<p>to use force against Iraq. The Council cannot and should not prejudge whether Iraq </p>
<p>will violate its resolutions; even less should the Council predetermine the course of </p>
<p>future action. The Security Council can make judgements and decisions only on the </p>
<p>basis of prevailing circumstances.”</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Qin Huasun concluded that Iraq was “a sovereign State and its sovereignty, </p>
<p>dignity and legitimate security concerns should also be respected”. The Security </p>
<p>Council should “make a timely and objective assessment of Iraq’s implementation of its </p>
<p>resolutions”. China hoped that UNSCOM would “complete its task of verification and the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>destruction of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction at an early date, so that steps can be </p>
<p>taken to lift the sanctions against Iraq at the earliest possible date”.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> Mr Dejammet welcomed the draft resolution and the confirmation of the authority </p>
<p>of the MOU. The resolution addressed a serious warning to Iraq about complying with </p>
<p>its obligations, but it also underscored “the prerogatives of the Security Council in a way </p>
<p>that excludes any question of automaticity”. It was:</p>
<p>“… the Security Council that must evaluate the behaviour of a country, if necessary </p>
<p>to determine any possible violations, and to take the appropriate decisions.”</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Mr Dejammet concluded by paying tribute to Mr Annan’s achievements, stating:</p>
<p>“Nothing will be possible without the constant involvement of the Secretary-General </p>
<p>in our work and in our deliberations.”</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Speaking after the vote, Ambassador Richardson stated that the US was “deeply </p>
<p>grateful” to Mr Annan for his:</p>
<p>“… courageous and diligent efforts. Through his diplomacy, backed by America’s </p>
<p>willingness to use force, he has achieved what could be, if implemented fully by Iraq, </p>
<p>a breakthrough.”</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Ambassador Richardson also expressed scepticism about whether, “after six years </p>
<p>of broken promises”, Iraq would live up to its words or the Security Council’s demands. </p>
<p>The resolution provided “for a new beginning for Iraq”; but the “choice” was Iraq’s.</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that Russia had “unswervingly striven to bring about Iraq’s </p>
<p>complete fulfilment of its obligations”, and that “the first step” would be to lift the oil </p>
<p>embargo once all Iraq’s “‘disarmament dossier’ issues have been dealt with and moved </p>
<p>to the long-term-monitoring stage”. As a result of Mr Annan’s mission, there was “a real </p>
<p>opportunity to speed up the process of achieving a comprehensive settlement”.</p>
<p><b>490. </b> Russia’s main goals were:</p>
<p>“… the need for full elimination of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, maintaining </p>
<p>United Nations monitoring in this field and avoiding the extremely dangerous </p>
<p>consequences for the entire region in the event of an uncontrolled development </p>
<p>of the situation.”</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Mr Lavrov said that the resolution contained “a political warning to Iraq”, “whereby </p>
<p>new violations by that country will have extremely serious consequences”, but:</p>
<p>“At the same time, there has been full observance of the legal prerogatives of the </p>
<p>Security Council … The resolution clearly states that it is precisely the Security </p>
<p>Council which will directly ensure its implementation, including the adoption </p>
<p>of appropriate decisions. Therefore, any hint of automaticity with regard to the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>application of force has been excluded; that would not be acceptable for the majority </p>
<p>of the Council’s members.”</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Argentina, Egypt, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Pakistan and Peru all asked to </p>
<p>participate in the discussion. With the exception of Kuwait, the statements focused on </p>
<p>the peaceful resolution of disputes as opposed to the use of force and their concerns </p>
<p>about the adverse consequences of military action for the people of Iraq, and for peace </p>
<p>and security in the region.</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Kuwait welcomed Mr Annan’s achievements but asked the Security Council to attach </p>
<p>the same importance to Kuwaiti issues, including the destiny of the detainees and prisoners </p>
<p>taken by Iraq in 1990-1991 who constituted one percent of the population of Iraq, as it had </p>
<p>attached to saving others in the region from the threat from weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><b>494. </b> On 5 March, UNSCOM inspectors returned to Iraq and successfully carried out a </p>
<p>number of site inspections.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> A baseline survey of the eight Presidential sites by a team </p>
<p>including senior diplomats was successfully carried out between 25 March and 4 April.</p>
<p><b>495. </b> During a visit by Mr Blair to Paris on 24 March, Mr Campbell recorded that, on </p>
<p>Iraq, Mr Blair and President Jacques Chirac were “in very different places, TB claiming </p>
<p>a success for diplomacy backed by force, Chirac basically saying we were killing </p>
<p>children through sanctions”.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>496. </b> In his report of 3 April, Mr Butler set out UNSCOM’s responsibility for reporting </p>
<p>whether Iraq had met the requirements set out in paragraphs 8 to 10 of resolution 687, </p>
<p>and that those reports were the “sole criteria” for assessing Iraq’s actions to provide </p>
<p>the basis for a Council decision on lifting the provisions of paragraph 22 prohibiting the </p>
<p>imports of commodities and products originating in Iraq.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p><b>497. </b> Describing them as the “indispensible context” for the Council’s consideration </p>
<p>of Iraq’s compliance, Mr Butler set out:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq’s claim that it has no more prohibited weapons ‘in the control of the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq, in the territory of Iraq’”; and that it had “made available </p>
<p>… all that is necessary to enable the Commission to verify that claim and that </p>
<p>nothing further, of substance, will be made available by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s claim, which it had not been possible for the Commission to verify, did not </p>
<p>“satisfy the three step system the Council established in order to enable Iraq to </p>
<p>fulfil its obligations”. Those steps, which were “not separable” were:</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>verification by the Commission; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>destruction, removal or rendering harmless under international supervision.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “consistent refusal” to provide “the information and materials needed to </p>
<p>verify its claim, clearly fails to satisfy the second step”; and that made the third </p>
<p>step “impossible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>This “difficult circumstance” had been made “even more complicated by Iraq’s </p>
<p>claim that it has unilaterally destroyed those prohibited weapons which were not </p>
<p>destroyed under international supervision”; and the Commission’s inability to </p>
<p>verify “all” those claims.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Aziz’s view was that UNSCOM’s “lack of technical competence and bias </p>
<p>against Iraq” was the “main reason” why Iraq’s claim was not accepted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Commission’s view was that Iraq’s “basic declarations of its holdings </p>
<p>and capabilities in prohibited weapons areas” had “never been ‘full, final or </p>
<p>complete’”, and that Iraq’s failure to “fill in the gaps” in its declarations and “acts </p>
<p>of unilateral destruction” had “significantly obfuscated the situation”.</p>
<p><b>498. </b> Addressing the standard of verification needed for credible reports to the Council </p>
<p>under paragraph 22 of resolution 687, Mr Butler stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>where prohibited weapons had existed, UNSCOM “must be able to verify </p>
<p>positively that they have been destroyed, removed or rendered harmless”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>where items and facilities for the potential production of such weapons existed, </p>
<p>UNSCOM “must be able to verify negatively that prohibited weapons are not </p>
<p>being created”.</p>
<p><b>499. </b> The remainder of the report set out UNSCOM’s concerns about lack of substantive </p>
<p>progress on the priority issues set out in its previous report, including concerns about the </p>
<p>impact of the technical evaluation meetings requested by Iraq, which were attributed to </p>
<p>Iraq’s failure to deliver the information and documents requested.</p>
<p><b>500. </b> In three areas, new concerns had arisen:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following Iraq’s insistence that it was not necessary to account for all extant </p>
<p>munitions on the grounds that any CW agent would have degraded to an inert </p>
<p>state, analysis of four 155mm artillery shells “filled with mustard of the highest </p>
<p>quality”, showed that they “could be stored for decades without any loss of </p>
<p>quality”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In March 1998, the Commission had discovered a document, dated 1994, which </p>
<p>“indicated the existence, at a site monitored by … [a] missile monitoring team, </p>
<p>of a programme for the manufacture of nozzles for spray dryers to be delivered </p>
<p>to Al Hakam, Iraq’s principal biological weapons production facility”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Also in March 1998, the Commission discovered documents, dated 1993, </p>
<p>that reflected a systematic attempt to deceive the Commission at that time, </p>
<p>contrary to Iraq’s claim that it had ended its concealment activities in 1991 and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>dismantled its concealment mechanisms. This underscored “the importance of </p>
<p>continued vigilance and activity … on the issue of concealment”.</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Mr Butler also expressed concern about the dangers of producing a list for action </p>
<p>by Iraq, on the grounds that it was “not unreasonable to consider that Iraq might take </p>
<p>action to satisfy that list positively” but not address any issues the Commission did not </p>
<p>know about. This would “effectively transfer the onus of establishing the basic facts from </p>
<p>Iraq to the Commission”. The Commission’s list “would become the standard of proof, </p>
<p>not Iraq’s … compliance with the resolutions and decisions of the Council”.</p>
<p><b>502. </b> Mr Butler concluded that:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s heightened policy of disarmament by declaration, no matter how vigorously </p>
<p>pursued or stridently voiced, cannot remove the need for verification as the key </p>
<p>means through which the credibility of its claim can be established.”</p>
<p><b>503. </b> On 7 April, Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, submitted his </p>
<p>first report to the Security Council on Iraq. He stated that there were no indications of </p>
<p>prohibited activities at any of the sites inspected by the IAEA and that all equipment and </p>
<p>materials which had been moved by Iraq had been returned to their former locations. </p>
<p>Initial inspections of the designated “Presidential sites” had “revealed no immediate </p>
<p>indications” of prohibited materials, equipment or activities.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had “no independently verifiable information” </p>
<p>to verify Iraqi claims that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lt Gen Kamil had taken actions on the nuclear programme that were </p>
<p>“independent, unauthorized and without the knowledge of the Government of </p>
<p>Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had not followed up any offer of foreign assistance to its nuclear programme </p>
<p>other than the declared foreign assistance to its centrifuge programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “high governmental committee”, which had initially been described as </p>
<p>having been established in June 1991 and headed by Mr Aziz, “had not, in fact, </p>
<p>been an established entity”.</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Dr ElBaradei also reported that Iraq had “satisfactorily completed its undertaking </p>
<p>to produce a consolidated version of its full, final and complete declaration of its </p>
<p>clandestine nuclear programme” and “fulfilled its obligation to produce … a summary of </p>
<p>the technical achievements”. The latter document was regarded as “consistent with” the </p>
<p>“picture” of the programme developed by the IAEA.</p>

<p>on 14 May which:</p>

<p>welcomed the improved access for UNSCOM and the IAEA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expressed the hope that the Government of Iraq’s agreement to fulfil its </p>
<p>obligations would “reflect a new Iraqi spirit with regard to providing accurate and </p>
<p>detailed information in all areas of concern”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expressed concern that the reports indicated that Iraq had “not provided full </p>
<p>disclosure in a number of critical areas, in spite of repeated requests from the </p>
<p>Special Commission”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted that discharge of UNSCOM and the IAEA’s mandates required full </p>
<p>co-operation from Iraq, “including fulfilment by Iraq of its obligations to provide </p>
<p>full, final and complete declarations of all aspects of its prohibited programmes”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted that the IAEA’s investigations over several years had “yielded a </p>
<p>technically coherent picture of Iraq’s clandestine nuclear programme, although </p>
<p>Iraq has not supplied full responses to all of the questions and concerns of </p>
<p>the IAEA”, including enacting penal laws on prohibited activities and whether </p>
<p>any Government document existed recording a government-level decision to </p>
<p>abandon the nuclear programme; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>affirmed its intention “upon receipt of a report (in October) from the Director </p>
<p>General of the IAEA stating that the necessary technical and substantive </p>
<p>clarifications have been made, including provision by Iraq of the necessary </p>

<p>200</p>
<p><b>508. </b> In response to a meeting of the Security Council on 27 April at which sanctions had </p>
<p>been discussed, Mr Al-Sahaf forwarded an open letter from Iraq’s Revolution Command </p>

<p>complaining about the injustice of continued sanctions.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> It asserted that the purpose </p>
<p>of sanctions was to “hurt the Iraqi people and to force the Security Council to remain </p>
<p>the pawn of a single member [the US], assisted by the old imperialist devil, the English </p>
<p>policeman”. The letter also complained about “unfounded accusations and blatant lies” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Following informal discussions in the Security Council on 27 April in which Iraq’s </p>
<p>compliance with resolution 1137 was raised, Mr Butler reported to the Council on 6 May </p>
<p>that, since the MOU of 23 February:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “granted unrestricted and unconditional access” to all sites UNSCOM </p>
<p>had wished to inspect and also granted unrestricted access to equipment.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The issue of access to means of transportation and to officials UNSCOM wished </p>
<p>to interview had “not arisen”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Butler hoped that Iraq would provide the records UNSCOM had requested.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Mr Butler stated that, “under the circumstances”, the requirements of resolution </p>
<p>1137 were being “sufficiently implemented” to allow travel restrictions to be lifted.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> On 1 May, the President of the Security Council provided members with a letter </p>
<p>written to him by Mr Al-Sahaf, which said:</p>
<p>“The fact that, after eight years, the sanctions against Iraq have not been lifted </p>
<p>demonstrates the Security Council’s lack of impartiality in dealing with this </p>
<p>matter. The Security Council has failed to discharge its responsibilities under the </p>
<p>Charter of the United Nations, whereas Iraq has satisfied all the requirements </p>
<p>and conditions set forth in Security Council resolution 687 (1991), section C. </p>
<p>The Security Council must now do its part, meeting its obligations towards Iraq </p>
<p>by implementing resolution 687 (1991), paragraph 22, without further delay.”</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>512. </b> An UNSCOM “informal paper” providing a “statement of specific tasks and </p>
<p>information” which would need to be completed and verified before a report could be </p>
<p>made, pursuant to resolution 687 (1991), that Iraq had completed the disarmament </p>
<p>actions required, was presented to the Security Council on 4 June.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> In addition, the </p>
<p>Commission would need to conclude that Iraq had ceased concealment of proscribed </p>

<p><b>514. </b> On 16 June, following a visit to Baghdad, Mr Butler reported that, although Mr Aziz </p>
<p>did not accept all the tasks listed in the UNSCOM paper were disarmament issues, </p>
<p>they had agreed a schedule of work to be carried out over two months to “try to resolve </p>
<p>the outstanding disarmament issues”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> Mr Butler described the talks as “cordial and </p>
<p>professional”, reflecting “the new spirit of co-operation between both sides” following </p>
<p>the signature of the MOU on 23 February. If Iraq met its undertakings to provide full </p>
<p>co-operation, it “should be possible for the Commission to resolve remaining issues and </p>
<p>begin to formulate reports … pursuant to paragraph 22 of resolution 687 (1991)”.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> It is clear from the detailed record of the discussions, however, that there were still </p>
<p>significant differences between UNSCOM and Iraq.</p>
<p><b>516. </b> During the talks, Mr Aziz challenged UNSCOM’s pursuit of “many trivial matters </p>
<p>not related to disarmament”: “Iraq had destroyed its proscribed weapons, and the details </p>
<p>were unimportant.”</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Mr Aziz also stated that Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had not achieved the capability indigenously to produce engines and gyroscopes </p>
<p>for proscribed missiles and, therefore, “accounting fully for such components </p>
<p>was unnecessary”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>would not clarify the extent of its attempts to produce VX: the issue was “closed” </p>
<p>and Iraq was only ready to discuss the evidence available to UNSCOM of </p>
<p>incorrect declarations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had already presented all the evidence available on biological weapons and no </p>
<p>additional information or documentation would be provided; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>refused to provide access to one document previously seen by the UNSCOM on </p>
<p>the grounds that it was unrelated to its work.</p>

<p>(1991), on his mission to Baghdad, 11-15 June 1998’ (S/1998/529).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>518. </b> UNSCOM made clear it did not accept those positions, stressing the “particular </p>
<p>importance” of trying “to verify the total amount of proscribed weapons produced by Iraq” </p>
<p>and a shift in methodology in the biological weapons area to focus on munitions.</p>
<p><b>519. </b> The report also stated that Iraq had been informed that France was initiating </p>
<p>additional aerial surveillance and further capability was being discussed with Russia, </p>
<p>but that this activity would complement the U-2 flights not replace them as requested </p>
<p>by Iraq.</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Mr Butler and Mr Aziz agreed that the results of the work programme should be </p>
<p>assessed during their next round of talks, to be held in Baghdad during the second week </p>
<p>of August. Mr Aziz declined Mr Butler’s invitation to hold a special meeting to discuss </p>
<p>concealment activities.</p>
<p><b>521. </b> UNSCOM later described the method it had used as focusing:</p>
<p>“… on unaccounted proscribed weapons and to set aside other aspects such as </p>
<p>fully verifying production capacities, research activities, etc. Satisfactory resolution </p>
<p>of the specific ‘priority issues would make it easier to conclude that other unverified </p>
<p>elements were of lesser substantive importance. Conversely, the inability of Iraq to </p>
<p>satisfy these issues would point to more ominous explanations for other unverified </p>
<p>parts of Iraq’s declarations. Whether these other parts will ultimately be addressed </p>
<p>is an open question, but one which has a direct bearing upon confidence in future </p>
<p>monitoring.”</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>522. </b> This approach became the method for establishing whether an “acceptable </p>
<p>material balance” could be produced for weapons within UNSCOM’s remit.</p>
<p><b>523. </b> The Butler Report records that there were two meetings between UK officials </p>
<p>and UNSCOM representatives, including Col Ritter, in May and June 1998 at which </p>
<p>discussions took place about how to make public the traces of VX which had been </p>
<p>discovered on missile warheads.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> A Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) operation, </p>
<p>“Operation Mass Appeal” was set up for that purpose, but was abandoned after the </p>
<p>UNSCOM report was leaked to the press in Washington.</p>
<p><b>524. </b> On 17 July, in a speech marking the thirtieth anniversary of the 1968 Iraqi </p>
<p>revolution, Saddam Hussein drew attention to the letter to the Security Council of 1 May, </p>
<p>which he described as “not just a protest cry”, but evidence of “a will and alternative </p>
<p>strategy” if “other means and methods” failed “to return life to its natural track”.</p>

<p><b>525. </b> On 18 July, a document relating to expenditure of four types of “special” munitions, </p>
<p>a term which denoted chemical and biological agent delivery, was discovered during an </p>
<p>inspection of the headquarters of the Iraqi Air Force.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> UNSCOM was not allowed to </p>
<p>copy or remove the document but it was agreed that it would be jointly sealed and stored </p>
<p>in the custody of Iraq’s National Monitoring Directorate.</p>
<p><b>526. </b> In a letter to Mr Butler on 23 July, Mr Aziz wrote that the meetings of biological </p>
<p>experts in Baghdad on 17 to 22 July had not succeeded in “closing the gaps between </p>
<p>the two sides”. Iraq deemed it “highly important to devote sufficient time to this issue </p>
<p>during our next meeting … to be able to study it intensively from the political and </p>
<p>technical angles”. That might require a longer visit than planned and the participation </p>
<p>of the largest possible number of experts.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Mr Butler responded on 24 July that he had not yet seen the Chief Inspector’s </p>
<p>report of the meetings but:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “a problem with the notion of ‘gaps’ between the two sides because </p>
<p>it, fundamentally, misrepresents both the nature of the relationship” between </p>
<p>UNSCOM and Iraq and the terms of reference for the meetings in Baghdad. </p>
<p>The relationship was that “Iraq should declare in full and truthfully all </p>
<p>relevant proscribed programmes” and UNSCOM “should seek to verify those </p>
<p>declarations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Describing UNSCOM’s inability to carry out its work as “a mere ‘gap’” departed </p>
<p>“very far from the fact of the inadequacy of Iraq’s past declarations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The proposal was similar to one Mr Aziz had made in June, when Mr Butler had </p>
<p>made clear that the issue was “establishing facts, not of negotiation between two </p>
<p>positions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the team’s report was “unsatisfactory”, they would “need to analyse why”. </p>
<p>But it was “premature … to conclude that political level discussions … would </p>
<p>correct a problem which has been long-standing, repeatedly addressed and has </p>
<p>always rested on the failure of Iraq to provide concrete and verifiable technical </p>
<p>information”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s “firm position” continued to be that resolution of the biological </p>
<p>weapons issues could “be accomplished with the provision of further documents </p>
<p>and other verifiable information” which Iraq possessed.</p>

<p>212</p>
<p><b>529. </b> As requested in the Presidential Statement of 14 May, Dr ElBaradei submitted an </p>
<p>“interim status report” on 27 July.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> The report contained little new information, although </p>
<p>it did state that Iraq had been unable to locate any additional documents about the </p>
<p>decision to abandon the nuclear programme.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> In addition, Dr ElBaradei reported that Mr Aziz had reiterated that Iraq’s programme </p>
<p>of declarations and unilateral destruction had been “an undocumented ad hoc progression </p>
<p>of activities undertaken in reaction to events”; and he had stated “unequivocally” that </p>
<p>“no Government decree existed which formalised Iraq’s abandonment of its nuclear </p>
<p>programme”. Mr Aziz had added that, “had such a decree existed, it would clearly have </p>
<p>been in the best interests of Iraq to make it available to the IAEA”.</p>
<p><b>531. </b> Dr ElBaradei observed:</p>
<p>“It is perhaps of little practical significance whether a so-called ‘high government </p>
<p>committee’ was formally constituted or was … an ad hoc group of varying </p>
<p>composition brought together to deal with problems as they arose.”</p>
<p><b>532. </b> In relation to the actions attributed by Iraq to Lt Gen Kamil, Dr ElBaradei added </p>
<p>that it was “beyond debate that concealment of components of Iraq’s clandestine </p>
<p>nuclear programme continued until at least August 1995”, and it remained “difficult for </p>
<p>IAEA to distinguish the actions of such a senior Government official from that of the </p>
<p>Government itself”.</p>
<p><b>533. </b> Dr ElBaradei also reiterated the importance, given the inherent uncertainties </p>
<p>arising from a verification process with the aim of proving the absence of readily </p>
<p>concealable items, of continuing intrusive inspections as part of the ongoing monitoring </p>
<p>and verification of Iraq’s activities. This was necessary to “provide a significant </p>
<p>probability of detecting prohibited equipment, materials or activities at other locations” </p>
<p>as well as assurance of the absence of those items at routinely inspected locations.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> After its visit to Iraq in April 1998, the IAEA reported that it had “found no </p>
<p>indications that Iraq has retained the physical capability – in terms of hardware and </p>
<p>facilities – to produce weapons-usable nuclear material. Nor are there any indications </p>
<p>of Iraq having achieved its programme goal of producing nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p>214 </p>
<p>The </p>
<p>IAEA could not provide assurances that there were no “readily concealable items such </p>
<p>as components of centrifuge machines”. In addition, because of the progress that </p>

<p>nuclear weapons purposes, any relevant materials or technology to which it may gain </p>
<p>access in the future”.</p>
<p><b>535. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York </p>
<p>from July 1998 to 2003, told the Inquiry that in July/August 1998, the Security Council </p>
<p>had been:</p>
<p>“… close to agreeing that Iraq was no longer pursuing nuclear weapons capability, </p>
<p>but the United States blocked a certification of that status because Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had not fulfilled absolutely all the detailed requirements. The chemical, biological </p>
<p>and missile development files were left open.”</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>536. </b> The <i>Strategic Defence Review</i>, published in July 1998, stated that “Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s Iraq” represented a “continuing threat”; and that:</p>
<p>“The size of the military forces available and the presence and potential spread of </p>
<p>ballistic missiles, chemical and biological weapons and even nuclear weapons add </p>
<p>to the risks. These dangers seem unlikely to diminish and may grow.”</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>537. </b> On 30 July, the Iraqi leadership made a statement which set out concerns about </p>
<p>the deliberations on the “nuclear file” currently under way in the Security Council, “the </p>
<p>arbitrary and aggressive position” of the US, and the “failure of the Security Council to </p>
<p>adopt a fair and equitable resolution”.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>538. </b> The statement concluded that, “As a result of the way in which the nuclear file </p>
<p>has been dealt with … and of the manoeuvres of the Special Commission”, Iraq faced </p>
<p>the prospect of the embargo continuing for “an unknown and unspecified period” </p>
<p>and the Special Commission continuing to “destroy and squander” the property of </p>
<p>Iraq. Iraq had agreed arrangements for access to Presidential sites with the UN </p>
<p>Secretary-General with the objective of awakening “the conscience of the Security </p>
<p>Council and the international community regarding the facts”, and that it would lead </p>
<p>to the lifting of the embargo. But there had not been “any perceptible result”.</p>
<p><b>539. </b> The statement declared Iraq’s intention to “call for a comprehensive national </p>
<p>debate … and on the position that should be adopted” in the near future; and that the </p>
<p>forthcoming meeting with the Special Commission would be “an essential indication” </p>
<p>of its attitude.</p>

<p><b>540. </b> During his visit to Baghdad in early August to assess implementation of the work </p>

<p>in compliance with its obligations, engaging further with the programme would be </p>
<p>“useless”. As a result, the discussions were terminated. Mr Butler reported:</p>
<p>“Under the circumstances, I judged that the best course of action was to report </p>
<p>immediately to the Council.”</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Mr Annan wrote that Iraq had “clearly taken a strategic decision to force the issue”, </p>
<p>demanding that UNSCOM should report Iraq had fully disarmed or lose the regime’s </p>
<p>co-operation.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Mr Annan added that Mr Butler was:</p>
<p>“… of course … not able to do this – but his position had been weakened further by </p>
<p>increasing allegations, including from within UNSCOM itself, that the mission had </p>
<p>been used by national intelligence agencies for information gathering un-related to </p>
<p>its disarmament mission. The Iraqis seized on this and won support from Russia in </p>
<p>denouncing UNSCOM, and Butler in particular as untrustworthy.”</p>
<p><b>545. </b> On 5 August, the Revolutionary Command Council and the Iraqi Regional </p>

<p>basis. “Iraq should participate as an observer in the bureau’s work”;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>restructuring the Commission’s offices in New York, Bahrain and Baghdad </p>
<p>on the same basis; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>moving the Commission’s main office from New York to either Geneva or </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>stated that “The Security Council and all its members, particularly the Permanent </p>

<p>of the Council which stipulate that the sovereignty of Iraq should be respected”. </p>
<p>They should also abide by the Charter of the UN and the 23 February MOU;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that the Security Council should “call to account” members who violated </p>
<p>those principles, including banning “flights over the northern and southern parts </p>
<p>of Iraq by certain Permanent Members of the Council”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that, to express “its good intentions” and its desire that “its decisions </p>
<p>should be correctly interpreted and not tendentiously explained as non-</p>
<p>compliance”, Iraq would permit monitoring activities to continue provided that the </p>
<p>individuals responsible strictly respected provisions of the 23 February MOU in </p>
<p>relation to the sovereignty, security and dignity of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>547. </b> Providing the context for its decision, Iraq stated that it had fulfilled all the </p>
<p>obligations imposed on it in the hope that this would lead to the lifting of “unjust </p>

<p>“… resorted to all ways and means to maintain the unjust sanctions … and to </p>
<p>obstruct and prevent any action by the Security Council that would recognize what </p>
<p>Iraq has achieved in fulfilling the requirements of the Security Council …”</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Iraq stated that the Special Commission was “foremost” among the instruments </p>
<p>used by the US, and that the US controlled its “leadership, activities and mode of </p>
<p>operation”. This had turned the Commission into a:</p>
<p>“… disgraced instrument for implementing the criminal American policy against </p>
<p>Iraq either by finding pretexts and fabricating crises with a view to maintaining the </p>
<p>sanctions or by spying on Iraq and threatening its national security and sovereignty.”</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Iraq also stated that:</p>

<p>The US had “committed flagrant and gross violations of Iraq’s sovereignty and </p>

<p>“criminal schemes against Iraq by allocating funds to finance illegal activities </p>
<p>aimed at intervening in Iraq’s internal affairs to commit acts of sabotage and </p>
<p>terrorism”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since May 1998, Iraq had been calling on the Security Council, the Secretary-</p>
<p>General and the international community to “adopt a fair and firm position”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “serious and sincere statements” had remained “unheeded” and the </p>
<p>Special Commission had “refused to endorse officially the substantive facts </p>
<p>about Iraq’s compliance”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had “rejected” the recent proposals to the Security Council to “move the </p>
<p>nuclear item from the status of disarmament to that of monitoring”.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Iraq concluded that the “current circumstances” confirmed that Iraq would “always </p>
<p>be under siege regardless of what it does, and regardless of its fulfilment of the Security </p>
<p>Council’s requirements”.</p>
<p><b>551. </b> Mr Aziz forwarded the decision in a letter to the President of the Security Council </p>
<p>on 5 August.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Mr Aziz stated that the Special Commission:</p>
<p>“… had refused to inform the Security Council of the substantive facts … Instead, </p>
<p>the Special Commission has continued its old and well-known methods of </p>
<p>concentrating on details of no value with respect to the requirements of section C </p>
<p>of resolution 687 (1991). It has also continued with its methods of raising marginal </p>
<p>issues, to confuse and mislead the Council and world public opinion into thinking </p>
<p>that those issues are of some importance with respect to the requirements of </p>
<p>disarmament. In addition, it has attempted to conjure up the crises and provocations </p>
<p>which characterized the work of the Special Commission throughout the past years. </p>
<p>The purpose of this was entirely clear, namely to perpetuate the embargo pursuant </p>
<p>to the policy of the United States of America.”</p>
<p><b>553. </b> Mr Aziz set out in detail Iraq’s position on UNSCOM’s approach to the agreed work </p>
<p>programme and his meeting with Mr Butler on 3 August. The points made by Mr Aziz </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Commission teams discussing missiles had raised “trivial” </p>
<p>or “marginal” additional questions, rather than focusing on the fact of the </p>
<p>destruction of special warheads and Iraq’s lack of success in producing engines </p>
<p>and gyroscopes for ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “proved that the material balance for R400 bombs was complete”.</p>

<p>The missing 155mm shells were less than 5 percent of the total stock, and had </p>
<p>been destroyed in early 1991 when a truck was set on fire. The remnants were </p>
<p>still being investigated and they should not be regarded as a serious obstacle to </p>
<p>closing the chemical file.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Commission could have found traces of VX, but there were a </p>
<p>number of possible explanations which could be investigated. If Iraq had </p>
<p>weaponised VX, there would have been “no reason why it should not declare </p>
<p>this”; concealment would have been “a silly act”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Commission had, since 1996, “been giving a distorted and falsified </p>
<p>picture of the biological programme” which “deliberately ignored the fundamental </p>
<p>facts” and “raised lies and fabrications using intelligence methods in co-</p>
<p>ordination with American parties”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The biological weapons programme had been “newly established”, had not been </p>
<p>completed, and “remained without a specialised top management”. Iraq had </p>
<p>been unable to import any specialised equipment for the production of biological </p>
<p>agents. Iraq had “destroyed this programme completely in 1991”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since 1995, monitoring teams had interviewed 256 personnel and carried out </p>
<p>1,048 inspections at 334 sites without finding any biological weapons or agents </p>
<p>and had not found “any proof on the existence of biological activities, current </p>
<p>or previous, in sites other than those declared by Iraq which were destroyed”. </p>
<p>95 sites were still under “strict and very intrusive monitoring”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “accepted the sacrifice” involved in the destruction of the Al Hakam </p>
<p>plant, including facilities for civilian purposes, “after the Special Commission </p>
<p>promised … that … was the most important step for closing the biological file”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When Iraq had given examples of the verification procedures adopted by the </p>
<p>US individual in charge of the biological file to a delegation led by Mr Lakhdar </p>
<p>Brahimi on 5 November 1997, they had produced “surprise and sarcasm”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the technical evaluation meetings in March and July, the Commission had </p>
<p>pursued questions which “bore no relation to the fundamental questions of </p>
<p>disarmament”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In response to the “vicious circle created by the Special Commission”, Mr Aziz </p>
<p>had proposed on 23 July that he and Mr Butler should supervise the file, but his </p>
<p>proposal had been rejected.</p>
<p><b>554. </b> In the concluding section of his letter, Mr Aziz wrote that Iraq had raised the </p>
<p>working methods of the Special Commission many times, and some measures had </p>
<p>recently been taken, including the participation of experts from Permanent Members </p>
<p>other than the US and UK, but:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “real situation” had “not changed”, as the US and UK were “still leading all </p>
<p>its activities and define all the discussions of the Special Commission”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “well known” that the US and UK had “tendentious political objectives </p>
<p>against Iraq”.</p>

<p>126</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Commission was “not prepared to tell the truth by announcing that </p>
<p>the main task entrusted to it … has been completed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That was “an illegal” and “tendentious political position” which was “not based on </p>
<p>any scientific or technical foundation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK had refused to acknowledge when there was a technical basis </p>
<p>for closing a file and had “obstructed practically any step which the Security </p>
<p>Council attempted to take in the direction of achieving justice and equity”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That had happened in July in relation to the nuclear file.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s warnings on 1 May, 17 July and 30 July had not been heeded.</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Mr Annan wrote that he had been contacted by Secretary Albright and Mr Samuel </p>
<p>(Sandy) Berger, the US National Security Advisor, who insisted that Iraq’s stance was </p>
<p>an attack on the UN and on Mr Annan’s own position as it was his MOU that had been </p>
<p>violated.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> His response to the “standoff” was to propose “a comprehensive review of </p>
<p>the UN’s relationship with Iraq, including the role of UNSCOM”. The US had opposed </p>
<p>such a move on the grounds that it was “bargaining” with Saddam Hussein, but:</p>
<p>“… the broader Council, including the UK, understood the value of engaging the </p>
<p>Iraqis in a process whereby they would come back into compliance and we would </p>
<p>set out on a path to a conclusion rather than permanent crisis.”</p>
<p><b>556. </b> On 11 August, Dr ElBaradei confirmed that, as a result of Iraq’s decision, the </p>
<p>IAEA was carrying out limited monitoring and verification tasks which fell “far short </p>
<p>of full implementation of the OMV plan” and resulted in a “significantly reduced level </p>
<p>of assurance” which could be provided for the Council.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>557. </b> On 12 August, Mr Butler reported that Iraq’s decision had brought “to a halt” all </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s disarmament activities, including discussions at the political and technical </p>
<p>level, and monitoring activities were “limited to sites previously declared by Iraq or </p>
<p>designated by the Commission”. UNSCOM fully shared the IAEA’s conclusions on the </p>
<p>impact on its ability to provide assurance.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had “arrived at an assessment … that Iraq’s declarations on the </p>
<p>unilateral destruction of the special warheads did not match all the physical </p>
<p>evidence”. Iraq was asked to discuss the issue on 3 August.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM and Iraq had been “able to identify jointly steps to clarify some of the </p>
<p>problems related to Iraq’s actions of 1991 to hide special warheads”, but the </p>
<p>effort was terminated by Iraq on 30 July when it refused to provide access to </p>
<p>relevant sites or to discuss the issue any further.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were outstanding issues relating to the remnants of “some 50 </p>
<p>conventional warheads … that have not been recovered”. Some 30 of those had </p>
<p>been indigenously produced.</p>
<p><b>570. </b> In relation to missiles, the outstanding issues were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s missile force was in possession of seven indigenously produced missiles </p>
<p>in 1991. Iraq maintained that they were training missiles which had been </p>
<p>unilaterally destroyed, but no remnants of the missiles or their engines had </p>
<p>been found.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A team of international experts had assessed in July that, by the end of </p>
<p>1990, Iraq had the capability to assemble a limited number of engines for its </p>
<p>indigenously produced proscribed missiles and Iraq should account for the </p>
<p>key components from that programme. A “rough material balance” had been </p>
<p>developed but additional verification work was recommended.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had refused to address proscribed liquid missile propellants.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq continued its development of the Al Samoud missile system which had a </p>
<p>declared range of less than 150km, but the issue of its reuse of Volga engines </p>
<p>from surface to air missiles was “unresolved”.</p>
<p><b>571. </b> In relation to chemical weapons, outstanding issues were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had provided “only preliminary information” on its investigation of the 550 </p>
<p>missing 155mm shells filled with mustard.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Accounting for about 500 of the 1,000 bombs unilaterally destroyed was “not </p>
<p>possible owing to the state and extent of destruction”. UNSCOM wanted to verify </p>
<p>the maximum number of R-400 aerial bombs to facilitate the final accounting </p>
<p>for chemical bombs. The quantity and composition of biological bombs was still </p>
<p>an issue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “serious discrepancies” between Iraq’s declarations and the report of </p>
<p>its consumption of special munitions in the 1980s.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s view was that Iraq was “certainly able to produce VX, and probably </p>
<p>produced it in quantity”. There was “significant doubt” about Iraq’s claim that it </p>
<p>had not weaponised VX.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had provided clarification of the production equipment removed from al-</p>

<p>of experts in Baghdad, a senior Iraqi official had stated that there had been </p>
<p>16 warheads filled with anthrax and five filled with botulinum toxin. The “new </p>
<p>explanation contradicted all accounts of the unilateral destruction of special </p>
<p>warheads” provided over “the previous three years by Iraqi personnel directly </p>
<p>involved in warhead filling and destruction activities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No evidence existed about the number of R-400 bombs filled with biological </p>
<p>agent, and Iraq had provided “no consistent explanation” for the allocation of </p>
<p>biological agents to weapons.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had pursued the development of drop tanks for dissemination of biological </p>
<p>agent “with the utmost vigour”, but the team of international experts had </p>
<p>assessed that Iraq’s account of the project could not be verified.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had modified commercial chemical insecticide equipment to develop </p>
<p>aerosol generators to disseminate biological agents. A document submitted by </p>
<p>Iraq reported successful testing of such devices in August 1998. Iraq had not </p>
<p>accounted for the “final disposition” of the devices produced.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The level of production of biological agents remained unverifiable, and it was not </p>
<p>possible to determine if agents had been dried to enhance storage stability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The material balance of biological growth media acquired and consumed was </p>
<p>“full of uncertainties”.</p>
<p><b>573. </b> Mr Butler stated that, after Lt Gen Kamil’s departure from Iraq, UNSCOM had been </p>
<p>“confronted with the fact that Iraq had successfully implemented concealment on a large </p>
<p>scale”. UNSCOM’s understanding of Iraq’s programmes had been achieved “largely </p>
<p>through forensic methods”. The verification of Iraq’s declarations had been made “far </p>
<p>more difficult than should have been the case” as a result of Iraq’s:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“policy and practice of concealment”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“unilateral destruction” of weapons and related materials; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“repeated denial of the existence of relevant documents on proscribed activities, </p>
<p>with the exception of those Iraq unilaterally chooses to provide”.</p>
<p><b>574. </b> UNSCOM also continued to find dual-use items and materials which should have </p>
<p>been declared by Iraq.</p>
<p><b>575. </b> The report stated that Iraq had rejected a request for a Russian AN-30 aerial </p>
<p>surveillance aircraft and its support unit to be based at the Rasheed airbase on security </p>
<p>grounds. The Commission had rejected an Iraqi suggestion that the aircraft be based </p>
<p>at Habbaniyah, 120km from Baghdad.</p>

<p><b>576. </b> Mr Butler concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Disarmament of Iraq’s proscribed missile and chemical weapons was “possibly </p>
<p>near its end”, but a “satisfactory resolution” of the questions on VX would be </p>
<p>necessary.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>This was not the case for biological weapons where Iraq’s declarations were </p>
<p>“neither credible nor verifiable” and it had “failed to take” the opportunity to </p>
<p>disclose its activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Development of monitoring was “vital to the future”, but Iraq was permitting </p>
<p>activity “only at a less than satisfactory level”. Monitoring would be particularly </p>
<p>important if UNSCOM was unable to provide 100 per cent verification of items </p>
<p>unilaterally destroyed by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full disclosure of materials and information was the “crucial ingredient for both </p>
<p>an end to the disarmament process and future monitoring”. Iraq’s demands that </p>
<p>UNSCOM should prove that Iraq continued to possess prohibited weapons and </p>
<p>associated capabilities would, if accepted, “reverse the onus of disclosure clearly </p>
<p>placed on Iraq by the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>577. </b> In his report of 7 October, Dr ElBaradei confirmed that there was no evidence </p>
<p>or indications of prohibited activity at sites inspected before Iraq’s decision of 5 August </p>
<p>to cease co-operation.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> There were still some difficulties, including Iraq’s instructions </p>
<p>that personnel should not respond to any questions about Iraq’s clandestine nuclear </p>
<p>programme, the quality of Iraq’s declarations. Greater transparency “would contribute </p>
<p>considerably to clarifying the few remaining questions and concerns”.</p>
<p><b>578. </b> These issues “would not of themselves prevent the full implementation” of the </p>
<p>Agency’s plan for ongoing monitoring and verification (OMV). That was:</p>
<p>“… predicated on the assumption that Iraq has the knowledge and technical </p>
<p>expertise to exploit, for nuclear weapons purposes, any relevant materials or </p>
<p>technology to which it may gain access in the future. Nonetheless, it must be </p>
<p>recognised that Iraq’s direct acquisition of weapon-usable material would present </p>
<p>a serious technical challenge to OMV measures, and great reliance must continue </p>
<p>to be placed on international controls.”</p>
<p><b>579. </b> Following informal consultations in the Security Council on 13 October, Mr Butler </p>

<p><b>Iraq and VX</b></p>
<p>Mr Butler’s report included a report of a meeting of international experts on VX, held in </p>
<p>New York on 22 and 23 October. The report revisited the sequence of events in relation to </p>
<p>VX sampling as follows.</p>
<p>In April 1997, following Iraq’s declaration of a VX production facility and a dump site </p>
<p>where agent had been disposed of, samples of equipment and soil at the site, taken and </p>
<p>analysed in the US, were found to contain VX degradation products as well as compounds </p>
<p>known as VX stabiliser and its degradation products. This was confirmed in further </p>
<p>analysis of samples from the same site in February 1998.</p>
<p>The US laboratory was also asked to analyse samples of 46 fragments from 45 “special </p>
<p>warheads” to verify Iraq’s declaration that 25 had been filled with biological agent and 20 </p>
<p>with a mixture of “alcohols” (isopropanol and cyclohexanol).</p>
<p>In June 1998, the laboratory reported to UNSCOM that it had found chemicals similar to </p>
<p>those found at the VX dump site.</p>
<p>In July 1998, UNSCOM asked the US laboratory to analyse samples from different </p>
<p>fragments from the 20 warheads Iraq had declared had been filled with alcohols. </p>
<p>No chemical warfare compounds were found, but degradation products from a </p>
<p>decontamination compound were found in five samples. In addition “signatures of </p>
<p>unidentified non-phosphorous compounds were found in many samples”.</p>
<p>A French laboratory analysing samples from 40 different fragments from the same 20 </p>
<p>warheads reported the presence of a degradation product from a “G- or V-” nerve agent in </p>
<p>one sample.</p>
<p>A Swiss laboratory analysing samples from the same 40 fragments did not find any </p>
<p>chemical-warfare-related chemicals.</p>
<p>Both the French and Swiss laboratories identified chemicals known to be the degradation </p>
<p>products of a decontamination compound and found that a large number of the samples </p>
<p>contained the same unidentified non-phosphorous compounds as the US laboratory had </p>
<p>identified.</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>The French experts “noted that the decontaminant could also have been used for … </p>
<p>chemical destruction of biological warfare agents”.</p>
<p>There was “no obvious explanation” for the presence of compounds in the June/July </p>
<p>samples which were “completely absent” from the April samples.</p>
<p>The US laboratory reported that it had re-evaluated all activities to confirm that no cross-</p>
<p>contamination or other mistakes had occurred.</p>
<p>As a result of further French investigation, ethyl – and methyl – phosphoric compounds </p>
<p>could no longer be confirmed in two samples.</p>
<p><b>582. </b> After intensive consultations, a letter from the President of the Security Council </p>
<p>to Mr Annan was agreed on 30 October, “describing the Council’s initial views” on the </p>
<p>proposed comprehensive review of Iraqi compliance in two phases: the first dedicated </p>
<p>to disarmament and the second other requirements, including those relating to Kuwaiti </p>
<p>missing persons and property.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> The letter reflected a consensus that the assessment </p>
<p>should be designed to lead to the definition of an agreed course of action and timetable </p>
<p>which, if followed, would allow the Council to act.</p>
<p><b>583. </b> On the evening of 31 October, the National Monitoring Directorate of Iraq (NMD) </p>
<p>informed UNSCOM’s representative in Baghdad that the Revolutionary Command </p>
<p>Council and the Ba’ath Party had decided “to suspend, stop or cease all activities of </p>
<p>the Special Commission, including monitoring”.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> Iraq made clear that it was not asking </p>
<p>the monitoring teams to leave Iraq and its cameras and other equipment would remain </p>
<p>in place. The IAEA would be allowed to continue its monitoring activities, provided they </p>
<p>were independent of UNSCOM.</p>

<p>reported that the members had “unanimously condemned” Iraq’s decision and </p>
<p>demanded that it should be rescinded “immediately and unconditionally”.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> Once Iraq </p>
<p>had rescinded this decision, and its decision of 5 August to limit co-operation, the </p>
<p>members of the Council remained ready “to implement a comprehensive review of Iraq’s </p>
<p>compliance”.</p>
<p><b>585. </b> The statement described Iraq’s decision and the continuing restrictions on the work </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>586. </b> In response to a request from the Security Council, Mr Butler submitted a report </p>
<p>on the consequences of Iraq’s decision of 31 October, on 2 November.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p><b>587. </b> Mr Butler stated that Iraq’s decisions of 5 August and 31 October made it </p>
<p>“impossible for the Commission to implement its disarmament and monitoring rights and </p>
<p>responsibilities” and that it was “not in a position to provide the Council with any level of </p>
<p>assurance regarding Iraq’s compliance with its obligations”.</p>
<p><b>588. </b> Mr Butler’s report also confirmed that routine logistic and maintenance work had </p>
<p>not been prohibited.</p>
<p><b>US policy: regime change in Iraq</b></p>
<p>On 26 January 1998, a Washington think tank, the Project for the New American Century, </p>
<p>published an open letter to President Clinton calling for a stronger approach:</p>
<p>“The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that Iraq will be </p>
<p>able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction. In the near term, this </p>
<p>means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing. In the </p>
<p>long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power.” </p>
<p>238</p>
<p>The 18 signatories included Mr Donald Rumsfeld, Mr Paul Wolfowitz, Mr John Bolton, </p>
<p>Mr Richard Armitage and Mr Robert Zoellick, each of whom became prominent members </p>
<p>of the administration of President George W Bush.</p>
<p>In February, a wider, bipartisan US group, the “Committee for Peace and Security in the </p>
<p>Gulf”, published a further open letter to President Clinton, which said:</p>
<p>“For years, the United States has tried to remove Saddam by encouraging coups </p>
<p>and internal conspiracies. These attempts have all failed … Saddam must be </p>
<p>overpowered; he will not be brought down by a coup d’état … Iraq today is ripe for a </p>
<p>broad-based insurrection.” </p>
<p>239</p>
<p>A bipartisan group of members of Congress drafted a bill, which made it the policy of the </p>
<p>US to support efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from power in </p>
<p>Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime. </p>
<p>It authorised expenditure of US$97m to provide military support to the Iraqi opposition. </p>
<p>It was approved by the House of Representatives by 360 votes to 38, and unanimously </p>
<p>by the Senate. It was signed into law by President Clinton on 31 October 1998 as the Iraq </p>
<p>Liberation Act, and regime change in Iraq became the official policy of the US.</p>

<p><b>595. </b> Mr Danilo Türk, Slovenian Permanent Representative to the UN, described Iraq’s </p>

<p>“While the Council was patiently moving towards meeting Iraqi concerns, Iraq chose </p>

<p>can result in anything other than a serious aggravation of the situation.”</p>
<p><b>596. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that Iraq’s decision had “jeopardised the search of recent months </p>
<p>for a solution to the Iraqi problem” and ran “counter to the agreements” reached with </p>
<p>Mr Annan that Baghdad “would rescind its decision of 5 August and that the Security </p>
<p>Council would conduct a comprehensive review”, which had “opened the way to the </p>
<p>lifting of sanctions on Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>597. </b> Mr Lavrov added:</p>
<p>“The way to overcome this new crisis lies … exclusively in political and diplomatic </p>
<p>efforts alongside the active role of the Secretary-General. Any attempt to resolve the </p>
<p>problem by force would have highly unpredictable and dangerous consequences, </p>
<p>both for the United Nations ability to continue to monitor proscribed military activity </p>
<p>in Iraq and for peace and stability in the region and in the Middle East as a whole.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to note that the draft resolution … seeks precisely a political </p>
<p>solution … and contains no language that could be arbitrarily interpreted as some </p>
<p>kind of permission to use force …</p>
<p>“Without in any way attempting to justify Iraq’s actions, I wish to stress the </p>
<p>exceptional importance of total clarity with regard to the Security Council’s intentions </p>
<p>to implement its own resolutions. The draft resolution clearly reaffirms the Council’s </p>
<p>intention to take a decision on the current sanctions in accordance with the relevant </p>
<p>provisions of resolution 687 (1991).”</p>
<p><b>598. </b> Mr Antonio Monteiro, Portugese Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that </p>
<p>Iraq’s decision had been greeted with “dismay and incomprehension”.</p>
<p><b>599. </b> Mr Dahlgren stated that it was Sweden’s “sincere hope” that Baghdad would not </p>
<p>miss the “exit sign … for the route out of sanctions”. He added that the final paragraph </p>
<p>of the resolution reflected the “very important principle” that:</p>
<p>“The Security Council’s primary responsibility for the maintenance of international </p>
<p>peace and security … must not be circumvented. We see this paragraph as an </p>
<p>expression of the desire of members to safeguard that responsibility.”</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Mr Amorim stated that Mr Annan’s “possible concept of a comprehensive review” </p>
<p>constituted a “thoughtful and balanced approach which could allow for progress” and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>that Brazil had learned of Iraq’s decision “with a deep sense of dismay”. He also drew </p>
<p>attention to the “special importance” of the provisions in the resolution which stressed </p>
<p>“that the Security Council will continue to be seized of this issue, in accordance with its </p>
<p>primary responsibility … for the maintenance of international peace and security”.</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Mahugu stated that the resolution contained “nothing that could open the door </p>
<p>in any eventuality for any kind of action without the clear and precise authority of the </p>
<p>Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>602. </b> Mr Qin Huasun stated that the Council “should seriously reflect on the root causes </p>
<p>of the present situation”. There was “no doubt” that Iraq had to fulfil its obligations in a </p>
<p>comprehensive manner, but the Council also had “the responsibility to make a fair and </p>
<p>objective assessment” of Iraq’s compliance. China’s view was that some weapons files </p>
<p>were “ripe to move” to the next phase of monitoring and verification. The fact that the </p>
<p>Security Council had been “unable to make such a political decision” was “regrettable”.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Qin Huasun added that Mr Annan’s proposals and ideas, which had been </p>
<p>“warmly received and supported by an overwhelming majority of the Council members”. </p>
<p>China believed that conducting a comprehensive review was “still a way out of the </p>
<p>present impasse”. Dialogue, consultation and confidence building was the only way out. </p>
<p>He appealed “to all sides to exercise restraint” and to “refrain from any actions that might </p>
<p>sharpen the conflict and exacerbate tensions”.</p>
<p><b>604. </b> Mr Qin Huasun concluded that there were “still elements” in the draft resolution </p>
<p>which were “not totally to our liking”, but he would vote in favour because it had:</p>
<p>“… incorporated amendments put forward by China and other interested countries </p>
<p>by taking out the part which determines that the situation in Iraq poses a threat to </p>
<p>international peace and security, and by adding that it is the primary responsibility </p>
<p>of the Security Council to maintain international peace and security, reiterating its </p>
<p>support for the Secretary-General in his efforts to ensure the implementation of the </p>
<p>Memorandum of Understanding …</p>
<p>“… We hope that this resolution will facilitate the resumption of co-operation </p>
<p>between Iraq, on the one hand, and UNSCOM and IAEA, on the other, to allow an </p>
<p>early comprehensive review which will in turn free the Iraqi people from sanctions.”</p>
<p><b>605. </b> Speaking after the vote, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that Iraq’s decisions of </p>
<p>5 August and 31 October had put it “in flagrant violation of its obligations” and it was </p>
<p>“right that the Council should react formally and unanimously to this latest attempt to </p>
<p>challenge its authority and that of the United Nations as a whole”. “Co-operation not </p>
<p>confrontation” was “the only way out from sanctions for Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>606. </b> Commenting on the views expressed by other speakers on the meaning of this </p>
<p>resolution as regards the possible use of force, Sir Jeremy added that the view of the </p>
<p>UK was that it was:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>serious breach of the conditions laid down by the Council for the cease-fire.</p>
<p>“In the resolution we have just adopted, the Council has condemned the Iraqi </p>
<p>decision to cease all co-operation as a flagrant violation of its obligations.</p>
<p>“This resolution sends a clear message to Iraq: resume co-operation now. If Iraq </p>
<p>does so, the Council has spelt out unambiguously that it stands ready to conduct </p>
<p>a comprehensive review of Iraq’s compliance with its obligations … and what </p>
<p>steps remain to be taken. We hope that Iraq will respond positively and resume full </p>
<p>co-operation soon.”</p>
<p><b>607. </b> Mr Peter Burleigh, US Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that </p>
<p>the Council had “sent a clear and unmistakable message to Iraq” that “non-compliance </p>
<p>will not be rewarded or tolerated”. The restrictions which Iraq had imposed on UNSCOM </p>
<p>and the IAEA were “intolerable”. Mr Annan had “expressed his own view” that Iraq’s </p>
<p>decision of 31 October was a “serious breach and major violation” of the 23 February </p>
<p>MOU. President Clinton and Secretary Albright had “emphasized that all options are </p>
<p>on the table”, and the US had “the authority to act”.</p>
<p><b>608. </b> Mr Burleigh concluded:</p>
<p>“Iraq should recognise the gravity of the situation it has created. Iraq must turn back </p>
<p>from the dangerous and self-defeating course it has chosen. The United States </p>
<p>sincerely hopes that Iraq will heed the clear message of this resolution and take the </p>
<p>necessary steps without delay.”</p>
<p><b>609. </b> On the evening of 10 November, Mr Butler decided to remove all UNSCOM </p>
<p>personnel from Iraq.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> He stated, in a letter to the President of the Security Council the </p>
<p>following day, that the “prime consideration which motivated the decision, and the speed </p>
<p>at which it was executed, was the safety of the Commission’s staff”. He had consulted </p>
<p>the President of the Security Council, Dr ElBaradei and the Chilean Acting Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN in New York. “Discussions were also held” with Mr Annan’s </p>
<p>office. Mr Butler regretted that it had not been possible to hold wider consultations.</p>
<p><b>610. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan recounts learning of UNSCOM’s withdrawal through a </p>
<p>telephone call from Dr ElBaradei at 0330 on the morning of 11 November and his anger </p>
<p>at what he considered to be Mr Butler’s “deeply unprofessional behaviour”.</p>

<p><b>611. </b> On 11 November, Mr Annan issued a press statement containing a personal appeal </p>
<p>to Saddam Hussein to take the necessary steps for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It expressed “surprise” at Iraq’s decision when the Security Council had “agreed a way </p>
<p>forward on a comprehensive review”.</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that Saddam Hussein had “thrown out the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors, who had written a damming report on the outstanding issues relating </p>
<p>to weapons of mass destruction and Saddam’s continuing ambitions to develop a </p>
<p>programme for them” and “President Clinton was contemplating a military strike”.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At a meeting with Mr Robertson, Mr Cook and General Sir Charles Guthrie, Chief of </p>
<p>the Defence Staff, on 11 November, Mr Blair had been briefed on the military options. </p>
<p>Cabinet had been taken through the issue the following day, with Mr Robertson warning </p>
<p>that it was “the most serious development” since the Gulf Conflict.</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Robertson had told Cabinet that Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>broken the cease-fire agreement, broken his word to Mr Annan, and was rebuilding </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons programmes.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> He was weaponising nerve </p>
<p>agents. These were “ferocious weapons” and “his neighbours believe there is intent”. </p>
<p>Mr Campbell wrote: “TB made clear this was the US demanding and us complying, but </p>
<p>that our own independent judgement was that he [Saddam Hussein] must be forced to </p>
<p>comply. He said there was a real breach, not a technical breach.”</p>
<p><b>614. </b> On 12 November, the Iraqi Permanent Representative to the UN in New York was </p>
<p>given a private warning that, if Iraq did not return to full compliance very quickly it would </p>
<p>face a substantial military strike.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Following discussions in the Security Council in which “all the members … </p>
<p>expressed preference for a diplomatic solution”, Mr Annan wrote to Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>on 13 November asking for “an early response” to the appeal in his press statement </p>
<p>of 11 November, which had been “unanimously endorsed” by the Security Council.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p><b>616. </b> Mr Aziz’s response on 14 November stated that Iraq had put its trust in Mr Annan </p>
<p>and his good faith but, because of US objections, the deliberations of the Security </p>
<p>Council on the procedures for the comprehensive review had not provided a clear </p>
<p>picture.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> On the basis of Mr Annan’s appeal and messages from Russia, China, </p>

<p>Mr Aziz and the Iraqi Permanent Representative had informed the Council that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has decided, clearly and unconditionally, to co-operate fully with the </p>
<p>Special Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision constituted “a rescinding of the decisions of 5 August and </p>
<p>31 October, and that Iraq’s co-operation with the Special Commission and </p>
<p>the IAEA will allow the return of inspectors to resume all their activities on an </p>
<p>immediate, unconditional and unrestricted basis, in accordance with </p>
<p>the relevant resolutions and with the Memorandum of Understanding of </p>
<p>23 February 1998.”</p>
<p>251</p>
<p><b>618. </b> The press statement also said that “Taking note of past experience”, Council </p>
<p>members had “underlined that their confidence in Iraq’s intentions” needed to be </p>
<p>“established by unconditional and sustained co-operation”, and:</p>
<p>“… reaffirmed their readiness to proceed with a comprehensive review, once </p>
<p>the Secretary-General has confirmed, on the basis of reports from the Special </p>
<p>Commission and the IAEA, that Iraq has returned to full co-operation, on the basis </p>
<p>of resolution 1194 (1998) and the Council President’s letter of 30 October to the </p>
<p>Secretary-General.”</p>
<p><b>619. </b> The US and the UK had already authorised air strikes when Mr Aziz’s letter </p>
<p>was received.</p>
<p><b>620. </b> Mr Blair wrote that air strikes had been due to begin at 4.30pm on 14 November, </p>
<p>but President Clinton “had decided to pause” when Iraq’s letter was received. Mr Blair </p>
<p>described Iraq’s response as “full of holes, typical Saddam rubbish”, but early on </p>
<p>15 November action was suspended.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Mr Blair wrote that Mr Cook was relieved, but he had been “determined to keep </p>
<p>the US alliance intact and functioning at what was a crucial moment”.</p>
<p><b>622. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair understood why President Clinton had decided </p>
<p>to pause, “but our general view was that we should have gone ahead”.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> He wrote: </p>
<p>“TB was worried we would end up diluting the support we had. Clear breach would get </p>
<p>us support. If we were signalling we weren’t sure, or it didn’t matter, we would dissipate </p>
<p>it.” Mr Blair and President Clinton spoke eight times over an 18-hour period.</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Mr Campbell recorded in his diary a conversation with Mr Blair on the morning </p>
<p>of 15 November, in which he said that “the US were still talking about going in today. </p>
<p>This was a nightmare, he said.”</p>
<p><b>624. </b> In a statement to the House of Commons on 16 November, Mr Blair explained </p>
<p>why the UK Government had been prepared to take military action, why it had stayed </p>
<p>its hand and why it remained “ready to strike” if Iraq failed to comply fully with its </p>
<p>obligations.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Mr Blair stated that Iraq had “built up a vast arsenal of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction” before the Gulf Conflict and that, since then, he had “been trying to hide </p>
<p>them, and to acquire more”. After the agreement of the MOU in February 1998, Iraq </p>
<p>had “resumed superficial co-operation”, but that changed on 5 August. The issue was </p>
<p>not “technical breaches of UN resolutions, but … a pattern of behaviour” that continued </p>
<p>“to pose actual huge risks”.</p>
<p><b>626. </b> Mr Blair stated that two hours before the attacks were due to start, word had </p>
<p>been received that Iraq had told Mr Annan that they would be responding positively to </p>
<p>his appeal. The US and UK had decided to put the attack “on hold for 24 hours to give </p>
<p>us a chance to study the details of the Iraqi response”.</p>
<p><b>627. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“The first Iraqi letter appeared to agree to resume co-operation with UNSCOM and </p>
<p>the IAEA. It was described as unconditional by Iraqi spokesmen, but the full text of </p>
<p>the letter, and in particular nine assurances that the Iraqis were seeking about the </p>
<p>comprehensive review … left that unclear. We and the Americans spelled out that </p>
<p>that was unacceptable, and that there could be no question of any conditions.</p>
<p>“During the course of Saturday night and Sunday morning, the Iraqis offered a </p>
<p>stream of further written and oral clarifications, making it clear that their compliance </p>
<p>was unconditional …</p>
<p>“The clarifications, taken together, mean that Saddam Hussein has completely </p>
<p>withdrawn his positions of August and October. No concessions of any kind were </p>
<p>offered to him in exchange. There was no negotiation of any kind. Nor could there </p>
<p>have been. Nor will there be in future.”</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Mr Blair cautioned:</p>
<p>“We do not take Iraqi words at face value. Long experience has taught us to do the </p>
<p>opposite … we and the Americans have suspended further military action while we </p>
<p>bolt down every detail of what the Iraqis have said, and while we test the words in </p>
<p>practice …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>“As ever, we do not rely on the good faith of Saddam Hussein. He has none. We </p>
<p>know, however, that under the threat of force, we can make him move. We will be </p>
<p>watching him with extreme care and a high degree of scepticism … we and the </p>
<p>Americans remain ready, willing and able to go back to the use of force at any time. </p>
<p>There will be no further warnings. The inspectors will now carry out their work.”</p>
<p><b>629. </b> Mr Blair emphasised that the position was different from that in February 1998. </p>
<p>There was “now a very clear diplomatic basis for action without further need for long </p>
<p>discussion in the Security Council or elsewhere”. If there was “a next time … everyone </p>
<p>will know what to expect … I shall have no hesitation in ordering the use of force.”</p>
<p><b>630. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“This is far from over. It is merely in a different phase. Our course is set: complete </p>
<p>compliance and nothing less, and we shall not be moved from that course.”</p>
<p><b>631. </b> Mr William Hague, the Leader of the Opposition, asked whether, given Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s “continued breaches of faith, and the continuing threat to peace that he </p>
<p>presents to the whole of the Middle East and thus to the interests of the United </p>
<p>Kingdom”, meant that, although there would be “formidable difficulties”, the “prime </p>
<p>objective of western policy should now be the removal of Saddam from power?”</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“Of course we want to see the Iraqi people governed by a regime other than that </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein. We are looking with the Americans at ways in which we can </p>
<p>bolster the opposition and improve the possibility of removing Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>altogether. I entirely share the sentiments that President Clinton expressed on </p>
<p>that point.”</p>
<p><b>633. </b> In a press conference on 14 December looking at the challenges ahead in </p>
<p>the coming year, asked whether Iraq deserved a comprehensive review, Mr Annan </p>
<p>responded that the Security Council itself “would want to know, after eight years of </p>
<p>sanctions, where it stands, what has been achieved, what needs to be done, and within </p>
<p>what reasonable time frame it can be done”.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Asked about “any inherent conflict of interest” between multilateral interests in the </p>
<p>UN and the US, Mr Annan stated that there were “areas” where Washington’s policies </p>
<p>diverged from the UN, including:</p>
<p>“… Iraq, where the Council has made it clear that we should disarm Iraq, and the </p>
<p>moment we get the indication from the inspectors … that Iraq has been disarmed, </p>
<p>sanctions will be lifted. American policy goes beyond that, but I am guided only by </p>
<p>the United Nations policy.”</p>

<p><b>635. </b> Mr Annan submitted reports from the IAEA and UNSCOM covering the period </p>
<p>since 17 November to the President of the Security Council on 15 December.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>636. </b> The report from Dr ElBaradei, of 14 December, was very short, simply listing </p>
<p>the IAEA’s activities and reporting that Iraq had “provided the necessary level </p>
<p>of co-operation” to enable it to complete the tasks “efficiently and effectively”. </p>
<p>In discussions on “the few remaining questions and concerns related to Iraq’s </p>
<p>clandestine nuclear programme”, Iraq had “expressed its intention to continue </p>
<p>to co-operate with the IAEA on the resolution of the issues”.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Mr Annan told the Security Council that the report from UNSCOM presented </p>
<p>“a mixed picture” and concluded that “UNSCOM did not enjoy full co-operation </p>
<p>from Iraq”.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>638. </b> In his report of 15 December, Mr Butler briefly rehearsed the impact of Iraq’s </p>
<p>policies on UNSCOM’s ability to carry out its tasks before 17 November, adding that, </p>
<p>since its return on 17 November, UNSCOM had focused on four main areas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>requests for information through access to documents and interviews of Iraqi </p>
<p>personnel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>monitoring inspections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inspection of capable sites; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disarmament inspections relating to proscribed weapons and activities.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Mr Butler reported that UNSCOM had asked for 12 sets of documents related to </p>
<p>chemical weapons and missiles and access to the archives of Iraq’s Ministry of Defence </p>
<p>and the Military Industrialisation Corporation. In response, Iraq had provided only one </p>
<p>set of documents, and a preliminary assessment indicated that they did not contain the </p>
<p>information sought.</p>
<p><b>640. </b> Other points included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had repeated its request for the return of the document seized at the </p>
<p>Iraqi Air Force headquarters in July 1998, which detailed Iraq’s consumption </p>
<p>of special warheads in the 1980s. Iraq had refused, stating that it was “ready </p>
<p>only to ‘consider’ … relevant portions of the document” in the presence of the </p>
<p>Secretary-General’s Special Representative.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had provided a report on its analysis of samples from special warhead </p>
<p>fragments.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had claimed that VX contamination of missile fragments from special </p>
<p>warheads, found by a US laboratory, was the result of a deliberate act of </p>
<p>tampering with the samples.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had refused to allow missile engine components to be removed for analysis.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq did not provide specific documents requested by a biological inspections </p>
<p>team and had not responded to a request for new, substantial information on its </p>
<p>biological weapons programmes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been some difficulties in interviews with students in a university </p>
<p>where declarable research on biological weapons had taken place.</p>
<p><b>641. </b> In relation to monitoring inspections:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was reconsidering its refusal since 5 August to provide data collected by </p>
<p>Iraq during tests on indigenously produced missiles and rocket engines.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had placed unacceptable conditions on photographs during a chemical </p>
<p>inspection on 5 December.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undeclared dual-capable items and materials subject to chemical and biological </p>
<p>monitoring had been discovered.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A team had been refused access on 11 December in line with Iraq’s policy of </p>
<p>facilitating entry “during the working days of the week, except Fridays”.</p>
<p><b>642. </b> In relation to disarmament inspections, Mr Butler reported that, “In the light of clear </p>
<p>evidence that Iraq had taken advance actions at certain of the locations planned for </p>
<p>inspection”, he had “decided not to conduct the full range of inspections the team had </p>
<p>planned”. The examples given included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been some difficulties negotiating access at one site designated as </p>
<p>sensitive which resulted in Iraq’s introduction of new requirements, including a </p>
<p>formal letter of request indicating what was being sought at the site.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the former headquarters of the Special Security Organisation, the building </p>
<p>had been emptied and Iraq would not disclose where the materials were held.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At the management offices of the Military Industrialisation Corporation, the site </p>
<p>“had been prepared to avoid any disclosure of relevant materials and the team </p>
<p>assessed Iraq had expected their arrival”.</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Mr Butler reported that Iraq had still not taken action to enact the required </p>
<p>legislation to prohibit activity which was prohibited by Security Council resolutions and </p>
<p>to enforce such legislation.</p>
<p><b>644. </b> Mr Butler concluded that it was “evident” from the report that Iraq had not provided </p>
<p>the full co-operation promised on 14 November, and:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>145</p>
<p>“… during the period under review, Iraq initiated new forms of restrictions upon </p>
<p>the Commission’s work. Amongst the Commission’s many concerns about this </p>
<p>retrograde step is what such further restrictions might mean for the effectiveness </p>
<p>of long-term monitoring activities.</p>
<p>“In spite of the opportunity presented … including the prospect of a comprehensive </p>
<p>review, Iraq’s conduct ensured that no progress was able to be made in either the </p>
<p>fields of disarmament or accounting for its prohibited weapons programmes.</p>
<p>“… in the absence of full co-operation by Iraq, it must regrettably be recorded … </p>
<p>that the Commission is not able to conduct the substantive disarmament work </p>
<p>mandated … by the Security Council and, thus, to give the Council the assurances </p>
<p>it requires with respect to Iraq’s prohibited weapons programmes.”</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Mr Annan also circulated a letter of 14 December from Mr Aziz, reporting in detail </p>
<p>on the activities of the IAEA and UNSCOM between 18 November and 13 December </p>
<p>and stating that, despite concerns about aspects of UNSCOM’s actions, Iraq had </p>
<p>provided full co-operation.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Aziz’s concerns included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A large inspection team to address allegations of concealment had arrived </p>
<p>without the agreed advance notification and had “carried out its work in an </p>
<p>intrusive and provocative manner, showing no respect for the procedures agreed </p>
<p>between Iraq and UNSCOM”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had not responded to Iraq’s requests to send teams to work with </p>
<p>Iraq to investigate two areas of importance in relation to the material balance of </p>
<p>chemical weapons: “the fate of the 155mm shells with mustard” and verification </p>
<p>of the “tail units of the R-400” which were “at the Iraqi Air Force stores”.</p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Annan suggested that the Council might want to consider three possible </p>
<p>options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“That the experience over the period since 17 November 1998 does not provide </p>
<p>a sufficient basis to move forward with a comprehensive review at this time.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“That Iraq has not provided full co-operation but that it should be permitted </p>
<p>additional time to demonstrate its commitment to do so.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“That the Council may wish to proceed with a comprehensive review on the </p>
<p>premise that it is sufficiently important to know precisely what has been achieved </p>
<p>in the area of disarmament over the entire period since 1991.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>648. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that a meeting of DOP took place on 15 December.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> Mr Cook </p>
<p>considered that Mr Butler’s report was sufficient reason for action. Mr Blair had given </p>
<p>explicit authority for the UK to participate if the US decided to go ahead with strikes.</p>
<p><b>UNSCOM and IAEA withdraw</b></p>
<p><b>649. </b> On 16 December, a spokesman for Mr Annan briefed the press that, overnight, </p>
<p>Mr Annan had received a telephone call from Mr Burleigh, who had advised him that </p>
<p>US personnel in Iraq were being asked to leave.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> Mr Butler had also been advised </p>
<p>to withdraw UNSCOM personnel, and had instructed them to do so.</p>
<p><b>650. </b> On the same day, Dr ElBaradei informed the Council that he had decided </p>
<p>IAEA personnel should be “temporarily” relocated to Bahrain once UNSCOM, “on </p>
<p>whose logistic support IAEA activities in Iraq” depended, had decided to withdraw </p>
<p>its personnel.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>651. </b> During Prime Minister’s Questions on 16 December, action against Iraq </p>
<p>was raised.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>652. </b> Mr Hague assured Mr Blair “of the full support of the Opposition for the use of </p>
<p>military action … provided that action has clear and achievable objectives” and asked </p>
<p>whether removing Saddam Hussein “must now be a prime objective of western policy”.</p>
<p><b>653. </b> Mr Blair responded that no-one who read Mr Butler’s report could seriously doubt </p>
<p>its conclusion that UNSCOM was unable to do its job properly, and that it stated there </p>
<p>were “greater restrictions now than previously”. The report detailed “not merely the </p>
<p>obstruction”, but the fact that it related to:</p>
<p>“… documents, sites and personnel that would give a clue to the whereabouts of the </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction and the capability to make them. It is not obstruction </p>
<p>simply for the sake of it, but a plan of deceit to prevent those weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction from being located and destroyed.”</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Mr Blair added that, if he was allowed to develop those weapons, Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would pose a threat “not only to his neighbourhood but to the whole world”.</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Subsequently, in response to a question from Mr Tony Benn suggesting that </p>
<p>military action would be illegal and that he should take “an independent view” rather </p>
<p>than do as he was told by President Clinton, Mr Blair responded that the question was </p>
<p>how to stop Saddam Hussein building weapons of mass destruction. He added that the </p>
<p>cease-fire in 1991 had depended on the fulfilment of obligations accepted by Iraq. The </p>

<p>on the IAEA and UNSCOM reports and the options identified by Mr Annan.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>659. </b> Mr Annan issued a press statement in which he said it was “a sad day for the </p>
<p>United Nations, and for the world” as well as a “very sad day” for him personally. </p>
<p>Throughout the year, he had “done everything” in his power “to ensure peaceful </p>
<p>compliance with Security Council resolutions, and to avert the use of force”. It had “not </p>
<p>been an easy or a painless process”, but “the United Nations had to try as long as any </p>
<p>hope for peace remained”.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Mr Annan concluded:</p>
<p>“I deeply regret that today these efforts have proved insufficient.</p>
<p>“What has happened to day cannot be reversed. Nor can any of us foresee the </p>

<p>in Iraq and the wider region, for humanitarian relief and healing diplomacy. In both </p>
<p>these tasks, the United Nations will be ready, as ever, to play its part.”</p>
<p><b>661. </b> In a public statement, President Clinton said that, while other countries had </p>

<p>including against civilians. He had “no doubt” that “left unchecked” Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would use them again.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>662. </b> President Clinton described the conclusions in Mr Butler’s report as “stark, </p>
<p>sobering and profoundly disturbing”. Iraq had “abused its final chance”. The situation </p>
<p>presented a “clear and present danger to the stability of the Persian Gulf and the safety </p>
<p>of people everywhere”. Action was necessary because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… without a strong inspection system, Iraq would be free to retain and begin to </p>
<p>rebuild its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes in months, not </p>
<p>years.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein “crippled the weapons inspection system and got away </p>
<p>with it, he would conclude that the international community – led by the US” </p>
<p>had “simply lost its will”. He would “surmise that he has free reign to rebuild his </p>
<p>arsenal of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Third, in halting … air strikes in November” Saddam Hussein had been given “a </p>
<p>chance, not a license”. If the US turned its back on his defiance, “the credibility </p>
<p>of US power as a check against Saddam” would be “destroyed”. That would </p>
<p>“fatally undercut the fear of force” that stopped Saddam “from acting to gain </p>
<p>domination in the region”.</p>
<p><b>663. </b> The air strikes were “designed to degrade Saddam’s capacity to develop and </p>
<p>deliver weapons of mass destruction, and to degrade his ability to threaten his </p>
<p>neighbours”. The US was pursuing “a long-term strategy to contain Iraq and its weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and work toward the day when Iraq has a government worthy of </p>
<p>its people”, through being prepared to use force when necessary and maintaining and </p>
<p>enforcing sanctions for as long as Iraq remained “out of compliance”.</p>
<p><b>664. </b> But President Clinton added that, as long as Saddam Hussein remained in power, </p>
<p>he threatened:</p>
<p>“… the well-being of his people, the peace of the region, the security of the world.</p>
<p>“The best way to end that threat once and for all is with a new Iraqi government … </p>
<p>Bringing change in Baghdad will take time and effort. We will strengthen our </p>
<p>engagement with the full range of Iraqi opposition forces and work with them </p>
<p>effectively and prudently.”</p>
<p><b>665. </b> In a statement on 16 December, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“This action could have been avoided. Since the Gulf War, the entire international </p>
<p>community has worked to stop Saddam Hussein from keeping and developing </p>
<p>nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and from continuing to threaten his </p>
<p>neighbours.</p>

<p>“For the safety and stability of the region and the wider world, he cannot be allowed </p>
<p>to do so. If he will not, through reason and diplomacy, abandon his weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction programme, it must be degraded and diminished by military force.” </p>
<p>271</p>
<p><b>666. </b> Mr Blair said that Saddam Hussein had “no intention of abiding by the agreements </p>
<p>he has made”. The report from Mr Butler had been “damning”; it was “a catalogue of </p>
<p>obstruction” based on a desire to develop weapons of mass destruction. There was a </p>
<p>threat “now” to Saddam Hussein’s neighbours, his people, “and to the security of the </p>
<p>world”. If he was not stopped, the consequences would be “real and fundamental”, and </p>
<p>that could not “responsibly” be allowed to happen.</p>
<p><b>667. </b> Mr Blair concluded that there was “no realistic alternative to military force”: “We </p>
<p>have exhausted all other avenues. We act because we must.”</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Mr Burleigh informed the President of the Security Council that “Coalition forces” </p>
<p>were making “substantial” military attacks against “Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>programmes and its ability to threaten its neighbours”.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>669. </b> Mr Burleigh stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The action was a “necessary and proportionate response to the continued </p>
<p>refusal of the Iraqi Government to comply with the resolutions of the </p>
<p>Security Council”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had been “undertaken only when it became evident that diplomacy had been </p>
<p>exhausted”. The coalition had “acted out of necessity” and the Government of </p>
<p>Iraq bore “full responsibility” for the consequences of the military action. The US </p>
<p>had not acted “precipitately”, but had worked “with its partners in the Security </p>
<p>Council over the past months in a sincere and sustained effort to bring about </p>
<p>a peaceful resolution of the confrontation created by Iraq”. “For reasons best </p>
<p>known to Saddam Hussein, Iraq chose to reject that effort.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “repeatedly taken actions” which constituted “flagrant material </p>
<p>breaches” of the provisions in relevant Security Council resolutions: “On </p>
<p>a number of occasions, the Council has affirmed that similar Iraqi actions </p>
<p>constituted such breaches, as well as a threat to international peace and </p>
<p>security.” The US view was that “the Council need not state these conclusions </p>
<p>on each occasion”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “once again, acted in flagrant and material breach of Security Council </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991)” by “refusing to make available documents and information </p>

<p>to secure Iraqi compliance with the Council’s resolutions and to restore </p>
<p>international peace and security in the area”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The resort to military force was “necessitated” by Iraq’s “policy of unremitting </p>
<p>defiance and non-compliance”.</p>
<p><b>670. </b> In a parallel<i> </i>letter to the President of the Security Council, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>stated that the action was taken “following a long history of non-co-operation by </p>
<p>Iraq”.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> Iraq had promised on 14 November to co-operate fully, but Mr Butler’s letter of </p>
<p>15 December stated “clearly that Iraq did not provide the full co-operation it promised”, </p>
<p>and that UNSCOM was “unable as a result to conduct the substantive work mandated </p>
<p>to it by the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Sir Jeremy added that the UK’s objective was:</p>
<p>“… compliance by the Iraqi Leadership with the obligations laid down by the Council. </p>
<p>The operation was undertaken when it became apparent that there was no prospect </p>
<p>of this being achieved by peaceful means. It will have the effect of degrading </p>
<p>capabilities which have been the subject of Security Council resolutions over the </p>
<p>past nine years. Targets have been carefully chosen to avoid civilian casualties.”</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>672. </b> In the subsequent meeting of the Council, Mr Hamdoon condemned the </p>
<p>“aggression” of the US and UK and the decision to flout international law and the </p>
<p>UN Charter.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>673. </b> Mr Hamdoon also criticised Mr Butler’s “partiality, lack of integrity and lack of </p>
<p>objectivity” by singling out five incidents from 300 inspections as “categorical evidence </p>
<p>of lack of co-operation” when the circumstances did not justify that conclusion, and for </p>
<p>withdrawing the inspectors without the knowledge or authority of the Council “to pave </p>
<p>the way completely for the military aggression”.</p>
<p><b>674. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock recalled the “long road” to the crisis citing Iraq’s use of </p>
<p>chemical weapons against Iran and its own civilians and its behaviour since 1991, </p>

<p><b>675. </b> Sir Jeremy added that Iraq had “deliberately provoked a series of crises” since </p>
<p>October 1997 “in an attempt to wear down the will of the international community”. When </p>
<p>military action had been called off on 14 November, Saddam Hussein had been warned </p>
<p>that, if he broke his word “once more, there would be no second chances”.</p>
<p><b>676. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that Mr Butler’s report of 15 December made clear that Iraq had </p>
<p>“yet again failed to keep its promises”.</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that resolutions adopted by the Security Council provided:</p>
<p>“… a clear legal basis for military action … Resolution 1154 (1998) made it clear </p>
<p>that any violation by Iraq of its obligations to allow the Special Commission and the </p>
<p>International Atomic Energy Agency unrestricted access would have the severest </p>
<p>consequences … Resolution 1205 (1998) established that Iraq’s decision of </p>
<p>31 October 1998 to cease co-operation with the Special Commission was a flagrant </p>
<p>violation of resolution 687 (1991), which laid down the conditions for the 1991 cease-</p>
<p>fire. By that resolution, therefore, the Council implicitly revived the authorisation to </p>
<p>use force given in resolution 678 (1990). And Ambassador Butler’s report makes </p>
<p>clear that, despite its undertakings … Iraq has not only failed to resume full </p>
<p>co-operation with the Special Commission but has imposed new restrictions on </p>
<p>its work.”</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Mr Burleigh rehearsed the points in his letter to the President of the Security </p>
<p>Council. He also praised the “outstanding professional work” of UNSCOM and Mr Butler.</p>
<p><b>679. </b> Slovenia and Japan supported military action but China and Russia were sharply </p>
<p>critical of unilateral action.</p>
<p><b>680. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that the military action had caused casualties, destroyed </p>
<p>“valuable material goods” and created a threat “to peace and security not only in the </p>
<p>region but beyond it”.</p>
<p><b>681. </b> Mr Lavrov added that the action had done “Grave harm” to the work on a </p>
<p>post-crisis settlement and to dismantle Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and their </p>
<p>delivery systems. It also “called into question” the system which had been “so carefully </p>
<p>set up over a long period of time to monitor” Iraq’s prohibited programmes. Russia </p>
<p>objected to the US and UK action. It was “an unprovoked act of force” which “grossly </p>
<p>violated the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of international law and the </p>
<p>generally recognized norms and rules of responsible behaviour on the part of States </p>
<p>in the international arena”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>682. </b> Mr Lavrov stated that “the Security Council alone” had “the right to determine what </p>
<p>steps should be taken … to maintain or restore international peace and security”. Russia </p>
<p>rejected “the attempts” of the US and the UK “to justify the use of force on the basis </p>
<p>of a mandate that was previously issued by the Security Council”. The actions were </p>
<p>a violation of Security Council resolutions. No one was:</p>
<p>“… entitled to act independently on behalf of the United Nations, still less assume </p>
<p>the functions of a world policeman.”</p>
<p><b>683. </b> Although there were problems in respect of Iraq’s co-operation, the crisis had </p>
<p>been “created artificially”. Partly that was the result of “irresponsible acts” by Mr Butler </p>
<p>in presenting a report on 15 December which “gave a distorted picture of the real state </p>
<p>of affairs and concluded that there was a lack of full co-operation on the part of Iraq”, </p>
<p>which was “not borne out by the facts”. He had also “grossly abused his authority” by </p>
<p>withdrawing UNSCOM without consultation and the media had received a leaked copy </p>
<p>of his report before the Security Council itself.</p>
<p><b>684. </b> Mr Qin Huasun said that the US and UK had “started a military attack … which </p>
<p>violated the … Charter and norms governing international law”. China was “deeply </p>
<p>shocked” and condemned the “unprovoked military action” which was “completely </p>
<p>groundless”. The differences between UNSCOM and Iraq could “properly be settled </p>
<p>through dialogue and consultation” while the use of force:</p>
<p>“… far from helping to reach a settlement, may create serious consequences for the </p>
<p>implementation of Security Council resolutions, for relations between Iraq and the </p>
<p>United Nations and for peace and stability in the world and in the region.”</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Mr Qin Huasun called on the US and UK immediately to stop all military action. He </p>
<p>added that Mr Butler had “played a dishonourable role” in the crisis, submitting reports </p>
<p>to Mr Annan that “were one-sided and evasive regarding the facts”. The purpose of </p>
<p>those reports might have been to provide “the main argument for the use of force”, but </p>
<p>there was “in fact no excuse or reason for the use of force”.</p>
<p><b>686. </b> Costa Rica, Kenya and Sweden voiced more muted but still explicit criticism.</p>
<p><b>687. </b> Mr Bernd H Niehaus, Costa Rican Permanent Representative to the UN, stated </p>
<p>that Costa Rica had learned of the air strikes “with great and profound disquiet” and </p>
<p>reaffirmed its “long-standing position rejecting the unilateral use of force and insisting </p>
<p>on adherence to international legal instruments”. Nonetheless, it had “witnessed with </p>
<p>frustration” Iraq’s policy of “defying and ignoring international obligations” and “forcefully </p>
<p>and vigorously” appealed “to Iraq to put an end, once and for all and unconditionally, </p>
<p>to its provocative actions.”</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Dahlgren stated that Iraq had “again and again … refused to abide by the </p>
<p>clear obligations that a unanimous Security Council” had decided upon, and that </p>
<p>Sweden would have been ready “to support a decision in the Council on military action </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>as a last resort” when Iraq “seriously violates its obligations, and when all diplomatic </p>
<p>means have been exhausted”. But, “that would be a decision for the Security Council”. </p>
<p>Instead “without such a decision”, military action had been taken while the Council were </p>
<p>meeting in informal consultations. Sweden regretted the attacks and the consequences </p>
<p>they might have for civilians in Iraq, and the “fact that the Security Council has been </p>
<p>presented with a fait accompli”. It feared that the strikes would “not be of much help </p>
<p>in getting the inspections going again” when the “Council’s overriding aim must remain </p>
<p>to rid Iraq of its programmes” for developing weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Mr Mahugu reiterated Kenya’s position that “any decision to take further action </p>
<p>against Iraq remains the sole responsibility of the Security Council”, and that it was </p>
<p>“difficult to understand the reason’s for today’s attack”. The reports to the Council did not </p>
<p>“in any way indicate that UNSCOM suffered a total lack of co-operation”.</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Mahugu added:</p>
<p>“Any decision taken to force compliance by Iraq with resolutions without the </p>
<p>Council’s prior authority … is contrary to the spirit and purpose of those very </p>
<p>resolutions, because it also deprived the Council of an opportunity to analyse </p>
<p>the reports … and to take a collective decision on them.”</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Brazil, France, Gabon, Gambia and Portugal each adopted a more equivocal </p>
<p>position.</p>
<p><b>692. </b> Mr Amorim deplored the fact that circumstances had led to the use of force, but </p>
<p>also stated that, when the use of force was contemplated, it “should take place within </p>
<p>a multilateral framework”.</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Mr Mamour Jagne, Gambian Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that the </p>
<p>die was cast, but Gambia “would like to see the unity of the Council restored”. If it was </p>
<p>not, the Council’s primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security </p>
<p>would be “seriously impaired”.</p>
<p><b>694. </b> Mr Dejammet stated that France:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deplored “the chain of events that led to American military strikes … and the </p>
<p>serious human consequences that they may have”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regretted that Iraqi leaders had not been “able to demonstrate the spirit of full </p>
<p>co-operation” called for by the February MOU; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>“The US and UK came under intensive criticism from all other members of the </p>
<p>Council, and the UN as a whole, for taking matters in their own hands in this way but </p>
<p>there was no formal motion of condemnation put forward.”</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>696. </b> The military action was supported by the main political parties in the UK.</p>
<p><b>697. </b> Mr Blair made a statement to the House of Commons on 17 December.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> He said </p>
<p>that the objectives of the military operation were:</p>
<p>“… clear and simple: to degrade the ability of Saddam Hussein to build and use </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, including command and control and delivery systems, </p>
<p>and to diminish the threat that Saddam Hussein poses to his neighbours by </p>
<p>weakening his military capability.</p>
<p>“… the action is proportionate to the serious dangers Saddam Hussein poses … </p>
<p>The targets, throughout Iraq, have been very carefully selected to reflect these </p>
<p>objectives …”</p>
<p><b>698. </b> Other points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors had been “constantly harassed, threatened, deceived and </p>
<p>lied to. A special and elaborate mechanism to conceal Iraqi capability was out </p>
<p>in place involving organisations close to Saddam, in particular his Special </p>
<p>Republican Guard.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had achieved a huge amount, but “too much” remained “unaccounted </p>
<p>for”, and Iraq had “consistently sought to frustrate attempts to look at the records </p>
<p>and destroy the remaining capability”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A report by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in October 1998 had </p>
<p>“documented massive and extremely grave violations of human rights”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s obstruction had begun “in real earnest” after “the full extent </p>
<p>of the weapons programme was uncovered in 1996 and early 1997”. It included </p>
<p>casting doubt on the independence of the inspectors and seeking to exclude US </p>
<p>and UK nationals.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had been given a “last chance” in mid-November, and warned </p>
<p>that, if he broke his word and obstructed the work of the inspectors, “there would </p>
<p>be no further warnings or diplomatic arguments … we would strike”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “a man to whom a last chance to do right is just a further </p>
<p>opportunity to do wrong. He is blind to reason.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s attitude was “as much deliberate obstruction as he thought </p>
<p>he could get away”, which he had used “deliberately to try to blackmail the </p>
<p>international community into lifting sanctions”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “a stark choice” between letting “the process continue further, </p>
<p>with UNSCOM more and more emasculated” or, “having tried every possible </p>
<p>diplomatic avenue and shown endless patience”, tackling Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>“remaining capability through direct action”. In Mr Blair’s view, there was “only </p>
<p>one responsible choice”.</p>
<p><b>699. </b> Addressing the issue of whether the objective was to remove Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“The answer is: it cannot be. No one would be better pleased if his evil regime </p>
<p>disappeared as a direct or indirect result of our action … Even if there were </p>
<p>legal authority to do so, removing Saddam through military action would require </p>
<p>the insertion of ground troops on a massive scale – hundreds of thousands … </p>
<p>Even then, there would be no absolute guarantee of success. I cannot make that </p>
<p>commitment responsibly.”</p>
<p><b>700. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“Whatever the risks we face today, they are as nothing compared to the risks if we </p>
<p>do not halt Saddam Hussein’s programme of developing chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p><b>701. </b> Mr Hague supported the action, adding that the Conservative party believed that </p>
<p>“the overall objective” of policy towards Iraq should be “to remove Saddam from power </p>
<p>rather than temporarily checking his ambitions”.</p>
<p><b>702. </b> Mr Blair agreed that “a broad objective” was “to remove Saddam Hussein and to </p>
<p>do all that we can to achieve that”, but he did not think he could “responsibly” make a </p>
<p>commitment to that outcome as an “objective of this military action”. Mr Blair expected </p>
<p>that military action would “significantly degrade and diminish Saddam as a threat to his </p>
<p>neighbours and his weapon-making capability”.</p>
<p><b>703. </b> Mr Menzies Campbell stated that the Liberal Democrats supported the action “as </p>
<p>a painful necessity and last resort to which we have been driven when all other options </p>
<p>have been exhausted”. Without Saddam Hussein’s “repeated defiance and deception, </p>
<p>the issue … could have been resolved several years ago”.</p>
<p><b>704. </b> The Rev. Martin Smyth stated that “the greater number of people in Northern </p>
<p>Ireland support the attacks whole-heartedly”.</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Mr Blair’s statement was followed by a debate on the military action.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>706. </b> Mr Cook stated that action had been taken because of Saddam Hussein’s failure </p>
<p>to keep the commitments he had made, and “with the full authority of repeated Security </p>
<p>Council resolutions, supported by all members of the Council”. The background was </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>156</p>
<p>“the 10 months since Saddam first threw out the inspectors last February” when “two </p>
<p>successive resolutions have given us the authority to carry out this action”.</p>
<p><b>707. </b> Mr Cook described the threat as, “not an arsenal of completed weapons” but </p>
<p>the “capacity to produce weapons of terror … within months if we turn our backs”. </p>
<p>The Government had two objectives. The first was “to defeat Saddam’s ambitions to </p>
<p>continue to develop such weapons, with which he could terrorise his neighbours”. The </p>
<p>second was “to reduce the threat to Saddam’s neighbours by diminishing his military </p>
<p>war machine”.</p>
<p><b>708. </b> In the debate that followed the statement, the majority of speakers supported </p>
<p>military action.</p>
<p><b>709. </b> There was, however, a significant minority which spoke against the action, </p>
<p>questioning the legal basis for the action, whether it would help to disarm Iraq, and its </p>
<p>potential impact on radicalising opinion in the region. A procedural device was used to </p>
<p>avoid a vote.</p>
<p><b>710. </b> At a press conference on 20 December, Mr Blair explicitly rejected what he called </p>
<p>“an ‘if you can’t remove him [Saddam Hussein], do nothing’ fallacy”. He argued:</p>
<p>“I do not accept that for instance we could only guarantee to bring him [Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein] down by a land war in Iraq … But just because we can’t get in the cage </p>
<p>and strike him down it doesn’t mean we should leave the cage untouched and the </p>
<p>bars too fragile to hold him. What we have done is put him back securely and firmly </p>
<p>in the cage …</p>
<p>“We have reduced the danger Saddam poses consistent with common sense and </p>
<p>a proportionate use of force.”</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>711. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, military action had sent:</p>
<p>“… a very clear message indeed to Saddam Hussein that we will not sit by; it also </p>
<p>sends a message to others … that the patience of the international community </p>
<p>cannot be tried indefinitely and that when it is right and when the will of the </p>
<p>international community is at stake we will act to enforce it because the first stirrings </p>
<p>of a new global reality are upon us. Those who abuse force to wage war must </p>
<p>be confronted by those willing to use force to maintain peace … We cannot do </p>
<p>everything … but what we can do reasonably we should do.”</p>
<p><b>712. </b> In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair called for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… a future strategy that is based on containment and stability for the region. </p>
<p>First and foremost, we must maintain a threat of force which Saddam now </p>

<p><b>718. </b> The Assessment added: “Other WMD-related facilities were not targeted.”</p>
<p><b>719. </b> In February 1999, the MOD assessed that the effect of Operation Desert Fox </p>
<p>on Iraq’s military programmes had been:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to set back the ballistic missile programme by between one and two years; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to disrupt for several months WMD related work of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry </p>
<p>and Military Industrialisation Headquarters in Baghdad.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>720. </b>  The bombing had “badly damaged, possibly destroyed outright” the L-29 </p>
<p>unmanned aerial vehicle programme. The rebuilding of the Republican Guard </p>
<p>infrastructure was estimated to take up to a year.</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Following the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review</i>, which had identified the importance </p>
<p>of preparations to overcome the possible threat from biological and chemical weapons </p>
<p>particularly in the Gulf, the MOD published a paper in July 1999 setting out the results </p>
<p>of a further review.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> In his foreword to the paper, Mr Robertson stated that knowing </p>
<p>what the threat was, how to reduce it, and how to protect against it, was “a constantly </p>
<p>developing process” which he regarded as one of his “highest priorities”.</p>
<p><b>722. </b> The paper stated that many countries of concern had biological or chemical </p>
<p>weapons capabilities, or both; and several were in areas in which the UK was most likely </p>
<p>to face challenges to its interests, including in the Gulf. The potential threat from those </p>
<p>weapons was “now greater than that from nuclear weapons”. Iraq had already used </p>
<p>chemical weapons. No country of concern had ballistic missiles which could threaten the </p>
<p>UK with chemical or biological warheads, but capabilities continued to improve and the </p>
<p>ballistic missiles being developed could threaten British forces deployed overseas.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> The UK’s policy rested “on four inter-related pillars”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Arms control. Since the First World War, the UK had been at the forefront of </p>
<p>international efforts to control and eliminate biological and chemical weapons </p>
<p>through arms control agreements.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Preventing supply. Export controls at national and international levels were </p>
<p>“effective in preventing a significant number of undesirable transfers”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deterring use. Potential aggressors should be assured that: the use of biological </p>
<p>and chemical weapons would “not be allowed to secure political or military </p>
<p>advantage”; it would “on the contrary, invite a proportionately serious response” </p>

<p>and those “responsible for any breach of international law relating to the use of </p>
<p>such weapons” would be “held personally accountable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Defending against use. Possession of an effective range of defensive </p>
<p>capabilities was required to enhance the other three pillars “by helping to make </p>
<p>clear to a potential aggressor that the threatened, or actual, use of biological </p>
<p>or chemical weapons” would “not limit our political options, or determine the </p>
<p>outcome of a conflict”.</p>
<p><b>724. </b> The paper stated that the UK’s military posture comprised three elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “ability to remove or reduce the threat by taking direct action”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>measures to minimise vulnerability to the weapons; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>capabilities, training and equipment which protected British forces and allowed </p>
<p>them to manage battlefield risks.</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Eliminating or reducing a threat before an aggressor was able to use biological </p>
<p>or chemical weapons was “preferable to having to manage the consequences of their </p>
<p>use”. Action to reduce the threat would “take a variety of forms”. The UK would, “In </p>
<p>broad terms, where legally justified”, take “whatever action” was “required to reduce </p>
<p>an opponent’s capability to use biological and chemical weapons against the UK, </p>
<p>our interests, or British and coalition forces”. The possibilities included “Attacks on </p>
<p>production facilities, storage sites, logistics chain and delivery systems”.</p>
<p><b>726. </b> The paper also emphasised the importance of “accurate and timely intelligence” </p>
<p>on which direct action was “heavily” dependent, “both to alert us to the threat and … </p>
<p>provide vital targeting information”.</p>
<p><b>727. </b> The paper stated that the threat from the proliferation of nuclear weapons was </p>
<p>“well known”, but biological and chemical weapons had a longer history and posed </p>
<p>“the greater potential threat” in the current operational environment. The foundation </p>
<p>for managing the risks was diplomatic, but a “balanced range of military capabilities” </p>
<p>was also needed, including defensive and protective measures “and the ability to take </p>
<p>action where necessary to remove or reduce a specific threat”. The UK had an important </p>
<p>dialogue with the US on biological and chemical defence issues and the UK would </p>
<p>“continue to pursue close consultations with them and with other allies”.</p>
<p><b>728. </b> In relation to Iraq, the paper stated that it had:</p>
<p>“… made significant efforts to develop a wide range of biological agents and their </p>
<p>delivery means, including missile warheads. The programme has included the </p>
<p>development and production of anthrax and botulinum toxin, and other agents, </p>
<p>including ones that can attack plants and animals.</p>
<p>“We also know that Iraq has a programme to convert L29 trainer aircraft for use as </p>
<p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). We assess that, if equipped with spray tanks </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>to deliver chemical and biological agents, these would be capable of causing </p>
<p>large-scale casualties.</p>
<p>“In 1998 we judged that, unless stopped:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq would be capable of regenerating a chemical weapons capability </p>
<p>within months;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had the expertise and equipment to regenerate an offensive biological </p>
<p>weapons capability within weeks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work on 650km range missiles which could hit important targets in the </p>
<p>Middle East might have begun. It could have been completed within a year, </p>
<p>and biological weapons produced in the same timeframe;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>if Iraq could procure the necessary machinery and nuclear materials, it </p>
<p>could build a crude air delivered nuclear device in about five years.”</p>
<p><b>729. </b> The paper stated that UNSCOM had “destroyed, or made harmless, a ‘supergun’; </p>
<p>48 SCUD missiles; 38,000 chemical munitions, 690 tonnes of chemical agents; 3,000 </p>
<p>tonnes of precursor chemicals; and biological and chemical warfare-related factories and </p>
<p>equipment”. The IAEA had “found a nuclear weapons programme far more advanced </p>
<p>than suspected, and dismantled it”. Saddam Hussein had “consistently sought to avoid </p>
<p>his responsibility to declare his entire biological and chemical capabilities” and had </p>
<p>“deliberately and systematically sought to conceal and retain them”:</p>
<p>“UNSCOM has discovered a document, which the Iraqi regime refuses to release, </p>
<p>appearing to indicate major discrepancies in Iraq’s declarations over the use of </p>
<p>chemical munitions during the Iran-Iraq war. Iraq also claims that it unilaterally </p>
<p>destroyed 31,000 chemical munitions and 4,000 tonnes of precursor chemicals, but </p>
<p>these still have to be properly accounted for. And Iraq has consistently denied that </p>
<p>it weaponised VX, one of the most toxic of the nerve agents. But analysis by an </p>
<p>international team of experts of the results of tests on fragments of missile warheads </p>
<p>has shown that, contrary to its claims, Iraq did weaponise VX.”</p>
<p><b>730. </b> The attacks on Iraq’s missile production and research facilities and the </p>
<p>destruction of infrastructure associated with the concealment of biological and chemical </p>
<p>programmes in December 1998 had caused Saddam Hussein “severe difficulties”. </p>
<p>They had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“damaged or destroyed” 87 percent of the 100 targets attacked;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“severely damaged” the base for the L-29 trainer “which could be used to deliver </p>
<p>biological and chemical agents”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“significantly degraded” some key facilities associated with Iraq’s ballistic missile </p>
<p>programme, “setting this back one to two years”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“seriously weakened” Iraq’s “ability to deliver biological or chemical weapons by </p>

<p>were believed to contain “key equipment and documents”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“set back” Iraq’s ability to regenerate its biological and chemical capability.</p>
<p><b>731. </b> The UK could not afford to ignore the problem of Iraq. Saddam Hussein continued </p>
<p>“to pose a significant threat to his neighbours” and would “reconstitute his biological and </p>
<p>chemical weapons capabilities if allowed”. UK forces would stay in the region for as long </p>
<p>as it was judged necessary and sanctions would remain in place until Iraq complied with </p>
<p>its obligations.</p>
<p>LEGAL AUTHORISATION FOR OPERATION DESERT FOX</p>
<p><b>732. </b> The USA and the UK did not seek specific authorisation from the UN Security </p>
<p>Council for Operation Desert Fox and instead drew their authority from previous </p>
<p>resolutions, especially resolution 1205.</p>
<p><b>733. </b> Their interpretation of the legal authority provided by those resolutions was not </p>
<p>supported by other Security Council members. Russia in particular disputed the legal </p>
<p>basis for military action. Resolution 1205 had used the formulation “flagrant violation” </p>
<p>rather than “material breach”, the recognised phrase derived from the law of treaties for </p>
<p>a breach which would entitle another party to argue that a cease-fire had been broken.</p>
<p><b>734. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… my use of resolution 1205 seriously annoyed my Russian counterpart, because </p>
<p>he realised that I had succeeded in establishing … a declaration of material </p>
<p>breach</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> of Iraq which he hadn’t intended should be allowed by the resolution, </p>
<p>which then lay the basis for the use of force in December 1998.”</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>735. </b> On 24 September 1998, the JIC had assessed:</p>
<p>“We cannot rule out the possibility that Saddam retains a handful of missiles … </p>
<p>these could be available for use within a matter of weeks or perhaps even days. </p>
<p>Provided it still has key components – and that is unclear – Iraq could within a few </p>
<p>months build, with little risk of detection, missiles capable of hitting Israel and key </p>
<p>targets in Saudi Arabia. If it needs to make or acquire the components, production of </p>
<p>such missiles could begin within a year …”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>736. </b> The Butler Report concluded that JIC readers in December 1998 would have </p>
<p>had the impression that Iraq had the ability “to regenerate a small number of ballistic </p>
<p>missiles, either through bringing back into use missiles that had been hidden or by </p>
<p>re-assembling missiles from hidden components”.</p>
<p>286 </p>
<p>Resolution 1205 refers only to “flagrant violation”.</p>

<p>Saddam Hussein had proved he sought WMD “not for some abstract concept of </p>
<p>deterrence, but for the very real purpose of using them”. His “history of aggression” left </p>
<p>“little doubt that he would resume his drive for regional domination and his quest for </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction if he had the chance”.</p>
<p><b>739. </b> The US had “met that threat with a consistent policy of containment”. In the face of </p>
<p>“periodic challenges”, this strategy had “essentially held Saddam Hussein in check”. But </p>
<p>“over the past year in particular”, he had “tried to cripple the UN inspection system” and:</p>
<p>“If Saddam could eviscerate UNSCOM without a firm response, not only would there </p>
<p>be no effective UNSCOM; there would be no deterrence against future aggression </p>
<p>because the threat of force would no longer be credible. And there would be no </p>
<p>prospect for keeping his program of weapons of mass destruction in check.”</p>
<p><b>740. </b> Mr Berger admitted that Iraq could not be disarmed from the air “as precisely as we </p>
<p>can from the ground”, but inspections had been “thwarted” by Saddam: for “much of the </p>
<p>last year”, Iraq had only allowed UNSCOM to look where it knew there was nothing to </p>
<p>be found.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> Mr Berger stated that the purpose of Operation Desert Fox had not been to </p>
<p>“dislodge Saddam from power”, and ruled out the idea of deploying American ground </p>
<p>troops:</p>
<p>“The only sure way for us to effect his [Saddam Hussein’s] departure now would </p>
<p>be to commit hundreds of thousands of American troops to fight on the ground </p>
<p>inside Iraq. I do not believe that the costs of such a campaign would be sustainable </p>
<p>at home or abroad. And the reward of success would be an American military </p>
<p>occupation of Iraq that could last years.”</p>
<p><b>742. </b> Addressing the policy for the future, Mr Berger stated that the strategy the US </p>
<p>could and would pursue was, therefore, to:</p>
<p> “… contain Saddam in the short and medium term, by force if necessary, and </p>
<p>to work toward a new government over the long term.”</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>743. </b> The best option was for Saddam Hussein to allow the inspectors to return and </p>
<p>Mr Butler had “proposed a roadmap to compliance that would take between three </p>
<p>and six months to complete” if Saddam Hussein had the will to end confrontation. But </p>
<p>intransigence should not be rewarded by “watered down monitoring mechanisms” or </p>
<p>“helping Iraq create the illusion of compliance”.</p>
<p><b>744. </b> Without verification that Iraq had fulfilled its obligations, however, Mr Berger argued </p>
<p>that force should be used if it was determined that Saddam Hussein was reconstituting </p>
<p>his biological, chemical or nuclear programme or the missiles to deliver his WMD. The </p>
<p>US strategy would be simple: “if he rebuilds it, we will come”.</p>
<p><b>745. </b> Mr Berger recognised that containment would be a “difficult policy to sustain in </p>
<p>the long run”. It was “a costly policy in economic and strategic terms”, and “even a </p>
<p>contained Iraq” was “harmful to the region” and condemned “the Iraqi people to a future </p>
<p>of unending isolation in a murderous police state”. That was why the US was “doing all </p>
<p>we can to strengthen the Iraqi opposition so that it can seek change inside Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> Mr Berger stated that the “responsibility to mount an effective movement that </p>
<p>appeals to people inside Iraq and inspires them to struggle for change” lay with </p>
<p>the opposition leaders, but there was much that the US could and would do. It had </p>
<p>“reconciled the two Kurdish factions and worked with them to improve the lives of the </p>
<p>three million Iraqis” who lived outside Saddam Hussein’s control in the North; set up </p>
<p>Radio Free Iraq; and was “intensifying … contacts with the entire spectrum of opposition </p>
<p>groups … to help them become a more effective voice for the aspirations of the </p>
<p>Iraqi people”.</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Mr Berger concluded:</p>
<p>“When the time is right and the opposition is ready, we will decide what kind </p>
<p>of additional support it will need to overcome Saddam’s apparatus of violence </p>
<p>and terror. We will not overreach. But we are willing to use whatever means are </p>
<p>appropriate to advance our interests in Iraq, as long as the means are effective.</p>
<p>“We will also stand ready to help a new government in Iraq …</p>
<p>“We will pursue this strategy with patience and resolve and with confidence that </p>
<p>our goals will be met … We know from experience that when people struggling for </p>
<p>freedom gain the moral and material support of the American people, they usually </p>
<p>prevail …</p>
<p>“Change will come to Iraq, at a time and in a manner that we can influence but </p>
<p>cannot predict …”</p>
<p><b>748. </b> The approach set out by Mr Berger remained the strategy of President Clinton’s </p>
<p>Administration towards Iraq during its remaining two years in office.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>749. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that following the UNSCOM report in mid-December, </p>
<p>President Clinton had decided to act.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> The air strikes had been “nerve wracking” and </p>
<p>the operation was “a limited success”. He added:</p>
<p>“The general feeling was that Saddam had got away with it again.”</p>
<p><b>750. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote that Mr Butler’s management and leadership </p>
<p>had been:</p>
<p>“… a gift to Saddam – allowing him, with a growing body of evidence – to claim that </p>
<p>he was all for disarming and co-operating with the international community, but that </p>
<p>UNSCOM’s approach made this impossible.”</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>751. </b> Mr Annan wrote that this was “entirely untrue”; but Mr Butler “and his backers </p>
<p>in Washington and London” had “failed to understand” how it “undermined his own </p>
<p>position” and that of the inspections.</p>
<p><b>752. </b> Mr Annan also wrote that whenever the military option had been floated during </p>
<p>negotiations in the previous year, he had asked what would happen after any bombing of </p>
<p>Iraq; but that question had never been answered. Desert Fox had:</p>
<p>“… ushered in a four year period without inspections and without a dialogue with Iraq </p>
<p>about its place in the international system, even as sanctions continued to devastate </p>
<p>its people and hand Saddam the ultimate propaganda tool – to be able to blame the </p>
<p>West, and not his own misrule for the misery of his people.”</p>
<p><b>753. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote in his statement for the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“When those attacks were called to a halt, the Security Council was left divided and </p>
<p>the inspectors were unable to return to the country.”</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>The impact of Operation Desert Fox</b></p>
<p>The MOD assessed that the effect of Operation Desert Fox on Iraq’s military programmes </p>
<p>had been to set back the ballistic missile programme by between one and two years, </p>
<p>that the WMD-related work of the Iraqi Ministry of Industry and Military Industrialisation </p>
<p>Headquarters in Baghdad had been disrupted for several months at least, and that the </p>
<p>bombing had “badly damaged, possibly destroyed outright” the L-29 unmanned aerial </p>
<p>vehicle programme.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> Rebuilding the Republican Guard infrastructure was estimated </p>
<p>to require up to a year.</p>

<p>Mr Webb told the Inquiry the MOD had looked at how effective the action in 1998 had </p>
<p>been in “keeping the WMD lid on by bombing … and we concluded that it was not </p>
<p>effective and we were not able to offer any reassurance that you have been able to deal </p>
<p>with the WMD problem solely by air power.” </p>
<p>294</p>
<p> In response to a further question, he said it </p>
<p>was “Not conclusively ineffective, but it hadn’t achieved a result of which one felt assured”. </p>
<p>Mr Webb added: “It did have a very useful effect on reducing the capacity of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Integrated Air Defence System, which was posing a threat to the aircraft.”</p>
<p>Dr Condoleezza Rice wrote in her memoir that, in July 2003, it became clear that “the </p>
<p>air assault on Iraq’s WMD in 1998 had been more successful than we had known, and </p>
<p>serious damage had been done to Saddam’s capabilities at the time”.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>The <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> concluded in 2004 that JIC </p>
<p>assessments in 1998 would have left the impression “of suspicion and concern about Iraq’s </p>
<p>break-out capability, coupled with possible possession of chemical [and biological] agent </p>
<p>stockpiles, in breach of its [Iraq’s] United Nations obligations” and “concern about the ability </p>
<p>of Iraq to regenerate a small number of ballistic missiles” in the minds of readers.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>Professor Marc Weller, Professor of International Law and International Constitutional </p>
<p>Studies at the University of Cambridge, suggests that Operation Desert Fox had three </p>
<p>important consequences for future policy towards Iraq:</p>
<p>“First, Iraq terminated all co-operation with the UN arms inspection regime, arguing </p>
<p>that the action demonstrated that inspections would only be used to prepare for further </p>
<p>military action. Second, support for any further action by the Council resulted in a </p>
<p>stalemate due to the ‘breakdown in the Security Council’ after the bombing campaign </p>
<p>… Finally, and most damaging for the negotiations leading up to resolution 1441 (2002), </p>
<p>several states resolved not to be lured again into the finding of a breach that might be </p>
<p>invoked to justify the use of force, as had been the case with resolution 1205.” </p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>754. </b> Operation Desert Fox had created a deep fissure at the United Nations and </p>
<p>within the P5. The Kosovo campaign, bitterly opposed by Russia and not mandated </p>
<p>by the Security Council (because of the certainty of a Russian veto), was a further </p>
<p>complicating element.</p>
<p><b>755. </b> After Operation Desert Fox, Iraq embarked on a policy of uncompromising defiance </p>
<p>of the UN rather than partial and intermittent co-operation.</p>
<p><b>756. </b> Iraq repudiated the NFZs, and attacks on aircraft became a common occurrence. </p>
<p>Iraq fired surface-to-air missiles and anti-aircraft artillery or targeted aircraft by fire </p>
<p>control radar, although no coalition aircraft were ever shot down. In response to this </p>
<p>threat, coalition aircraft targeted a variety of different elements of Iraq’s Integrated </p>
<p>Air Defence System (IADS), such as radar sites and associated communications and </p>
<p>control networks, surface-to-air missile batteries and anti-aircraft artillery positions. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>RAF Jaguars flying reconnaissance operations in the northern NFZ did not carry or </p>
<p>drop air-to-ground ordnance, but RAF Tornado aircraft in the southern NFZ did so on </p>
<p>numerous occasions.</p>
<p><b>757. </b> Although Iraq did not succeed in shooting down an aircraft the risk was taken </p>
<p>extremely seriously by both the US and the UK. That raised a number of serious issues </p>
<p>about the extent of the actions which could be taken in self-defence and the nature of </p>
<p>operations to rescue any downed aircrew. Those are addressed in Section 1.2.</p>
<p><b>758. </b> The Butler Report stated that a JIC Assessment on 7 January 1999 had reached </p>
<p>“somewhat firmer judgements than in 1997” that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Following the 1991 Gulf War Iraq concealed BW [biological warfare] production </p>
<p>equipment, stocks of agents and perhaps even BW weapons …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… Iraq has sufficient expertise, equipment, and materials to produce BW </p>
<p>agents within weeks.” </p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>759. </b> The Butler Review was told that the reason for shortening the timescales for </p>
<p>production of biological agent to “within weeks” was “intelligence of Iraqi requests for </p>
<p>large quantities of growth media”, which was “judged to be greatly in excess of Iraq’s </p>
<p>likely legitimate requirements”.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> But it was “not known” if Iraq had actually obtained </p>
<p>the growth media.</p>
<p><b>UNSCOM’s findings, January 1999</b></p>
<p><b>760. </b> Mr Butler produced two reports on 25 January 1999, one on the disarmament of </p>
<p>Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction and one on monitoring and verification, which were </p>
<p>formally circulated to the Security Council on 29 January.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>761. </b> The report on disarmament described the work of UNSCOM since 1991 and its </p>
<p>methodology, and set out “material balances” for the proscribed missile, chemical and </p>
<p>biological weapons in three detailed annexes. It also included an annex “on actions by </p>
<p>Iraq to obstruct disarmament”.</p>
<p><b>762. </b> The report drew a distinction between UNSCOM’s activities before and after </p>
<p>Lt Gen Kamil’s departure from Iraq in August 1995, commenting that Iraq’s subsequent </p>
<p>disclosures:</p>
<p>“… indicated that, during the first four years of its activities, the Commission had </p>
<p>been very substantially misled by Iraq both in terms of its understanding of Iraq’s </p>

<p>proscribed weapons programmes and the continuation of prohibited activities … </p>
<p>Positive conclusions on Iraq’s compliance … had to be revised … Analysis of the </p>
<p>new material shaped the direction of the Commission’s work including the emphasis </p>
<p>on: obtaining verifiable evidence including physical materials or documents; </p>
<p>investigation of the successful concealment activities by Iraq; and, the thorough </p>
<p>verification of the unilateral destruction events.”</p>
<p><b>763. </b> The report also stated that the Commission had been “obliged to undertake a </p>
<p>degree of forensic work which was never intended to be the case”. Iraq’s “inadequate </p>
<p>disclosures, unilateral destruction and concealment activities” had made that task more </p>
<p>difficult and continued “in many cases” after 1995. The “concerted obstructions” raised </p>
<p>the question of Iraq’s motives.</p>
<p><b>764. </b> UNSCOM could not verify Iraq’s claims that it had fulfilled all its disarmament </p>
<p>obligations, ceased concealment activities, and had neither proscribed weapons nor the </p>
<p>means to make them. Despite Iraq’s denials, the Commission’s “strong view” was that </p>
<p>documentation still existed in Iraq; and that its provision was “the best hope for revealing </p>
<p>the full picture” on Iraq’s activities.</p>
<p><b>765. </b> The “priority issues” for disarmament identified in June 1998 had focused on </p>
<p>unaccounted for weapons and “set aside other aspects such as fully verifying production </p>
<p>capacities, research activities”. This approach was based on the view that “satisfactory </p>
<p>resolution” of the specific priority issues “would make it easier to conclude that other </p>
<p>unverified elements were of lesser substantive importance”.</p>
<p><b>766. </b> The report added, however, that:</p>
<p>“Conversely, the inability of Iraq to satisfy these issues would point to more ominous </p>
<p>explanations for other unverified parts of Iraq’s declarations.”</p>
<p><b>767. </b> The report stated that Iraq had “once considered” mobile production facilities.</p>
<p><b>768. </b> UNSCOM described Iraq’s declarations as “fraudulent” and “wholly lacking </p>
<p>credibility”. Iraq had declared in August 1995 that it had filled 25 Al Hussein missile </p>
<p>warheads with BW agents. It also declared that 200 R-400 aerial bombs had been </p>
<p>produced for BW purposes but the number filled with agents was a “guess”. Iraq had </p>
<p>also pursued aerial drop tanks, aerosol generators and helicopter spray tanks and there </p>
<p>were questions about programmes for other munitions.</p>
<p><b>769. </b> UNSCOM was concerned about the uncertainties surrounding the extent of </p>
<p>weaponisation, the production of bulk BW agent, imports of raw materials, organisation </p>
<p>and planning, research and development, and past and continuing efforts of deception. </p>
<p>UNSCOM could report with confidence on the destruction of some facilities, but it </p>
<p>had “no confidence that all bulk agents have been destroyed; that no BW munitions </p>
<p>or weapons remain in Iraq; and that a BW capability does not still exist in Iraq.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>It also raised “serious doubts” about Iraq’s claim that it had “obliterated” the BW </p>
<p>programme in 1991.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>770. </b> UNSCOM recorded uncertainties about the destruction of Iraq’s “special weapons”, </p>
<p>warheads for ballistic missiles filled with chemical and biological agent. It also recorded </p>
<p>its inability to verify Iraq’s destruction of seven indigenously produced Al Hussein </p>
<p>missiles, and imports of proscribed liquid propellant and major components, particularly </p>
<p>missile engines and guidance systems.</p>
<p><b>771. </b> The Commission stated that actions by Iraq “in three main respects” had “had a </p>
<p>significant negative impact upon the Commission’s work”. Those were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq’s disclosure statements have never been complete”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… contrary to the requirement that destruction be conducted under international </p>
<p>supervision, Iraq undertook extensive unilateral and secret destruction of large </p>
<p>quantities of proscribed weapons and items”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… a practice of concealment of proscribed items … and a cover up of its </p>
<p>activities in contravention of Council resolutions”.</p>
<p><b>772. </b> The annex on “Actions by Iraq to obstruct disarmament” stated that UNSCOM’s </p>
<p>work in Iraq had been “plagued by co-ordinated efforts to thwart full discovery of Iraq’s </p>
<p>proscribed programmes” which had begun “immediately following the adoption” of </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991).</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>773. </b> In a “brief summary” of its “current understanding of the evolution of these </p>
<p>concealment policies and practices”, the report stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraq Presidency had “collected reports on weapons remaining with Iraq’s </p>
<p>Armed Forces” in spring 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “decision was taken by a high-level committee”, of which Mr Aziz was a </p>
<p>member, to provide UNSCOM with “only a portion of its proscribed weapons, </p>
<p>their components and production capabilities and stocks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM “deduced” that Iraq’s policy was based on:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>providing “a portion of their extant weapon stocks, with an emphasis on </p>
<p>those which were least modern”;</p>

<p>{</p>
<p>concealing “the very existence of its offensive biological weapons </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>After an incident at Abu Ghraib in June 1991, when IAEA inspectors had </p>
<p>obtained photographic evidence of retained nuclear weapons production </p>
<p>components, Iraq had decided “in late June 1991 to eliminate some of these </p>
<p>retained proscribed materials, on its own, and in secret and in such a way that </p>
<p>precise knowledge about what and how much had been destroyed would not </p>
<p>be achievable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq did not admit its programme of unilateral destruction until March 1992, when </p>
<p>UNSCOM had “indicated it had evidence that Iraq retained weapons after its </p>
<p>supervised destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq stated that “The unilateral destruction was carried out entirely unrecorded. </p>
<p>No written and no visual records were kept, as it was not foreseen that Iraq </p>
<p>needed to prove the destruction to anybody.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In 1992, UNSCOM had not recognised that the programme “was a determined </p>
<p>measure taken to conceal evidence which would reveal retained capabilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was only after 1995 that UNSCOM had become aware of “concerted deception </p>
<p>efforts and was forced to re-examine the 1991-1992 period”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Investigations, including “extensive excavation efforts with Iraq”, “extensive </p>
<p>interviews with Iraqi participants in the destruction”, and analysis of overhead </p>
<p>imagery, had produced “mixed” results. There was “some evidence supporting </p>
<p>Iraqi declarations” but other data raised “serious concerns about the true fate of </p>
<p>proscribed weapons and items”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Questions arose about the reasons for Iraq’s actions including the following:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Iraq made an admission in August 1997 that missile launchers had been </p>
<p>destroyed in October not July 1991.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The precise locations of warhead filling and destruction had been revised </p>
<p>several times.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Claimed movements of concealed warheads had “been proven to be </p>
<p>false”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Explanations of concealment and movement of retained chemical weapons </p>
<p>production equipment had been “shown to be false”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Iraq had not declared the concealment of “production equipment and </p>
<p>critical components related to Iraq’s indigenous proscribed missile </p>
<p>programmes” in a private villa in Abu Ghraib, until March 1992, when it had </p>

<p>Direct evidence of the involvement of the Iraq General Intelligence Service, </p>

<p>UNSCOM “assessed” that the Special Security Organisation (SSO) </p>
<p>“appeared” to provide “overall direction” for concealment activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq claimed all concealment activities had been terminated in 1995.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had used interviews and inspections in an attempt to elicit “a true </p>
<p>picture of concealment actions and confirmation it had or would be ended” in </p>
<p>1996-1998, but “missing files, cleansed rooms, purged computers and other </p>
<p>techniques were encountered on a regular basis at sites under inspection”. </p>
<p>Convoy movements in response to inspection activity “provided still more </p>
<p>evidence that concealment was ongoing”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had “recently” received information “from multiple sources” identifying </p>
<p>organisations which “direct and implement the concealment effort in Iraq”, which </p>
<p>agreed that:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>Concealment-related decisions were made “by a small committee of high </p>

<p>The committee directed a unit “responsible for moving, hiding, and </p>

<p>verification” reported on 27 March.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>778. </b> The report stated that the panel’s “main objective” was “to make recommendations </p>
<p>… on how … to reestablish an effective disarmament/ongoing monitoring and verification </p>
<p>[OMV] regime in Iraq”. To meet that remit, it had considered “refocusing … the approach </p>
<p>towards disarmament/ongoing monitoring and verification, without departing from the </p>
<p>existing framework of rights and obligations laid down in Security Council resolutions” as </p>
<p>a way “to enlarge the scope of policy options” for the Council. While the panel “could not </p>
<p>ignore the political and … legal context”, its recommendations were technical.</p>

<p>“the resolution of remaining issues” within an OMV framework.</p>

<p><b>782. </b> The panel also noted that “the longer inspection and monitoring activities remain </p>
<p>suspended, the more difficult the comprehensive implementation of Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions becomes”. This increased “the risk that Iraq might reconstitute its proscribed </p>
<p>weapons programmes or retain proscribed items” and, if that risk materialised as a result </p>
<p>of the absence of inspections, it “would have extremely negative consequences for the </p>
<p>credibility of international non-proliferation efforts in general, and for the credibility of the </p>
<p>United Nations and IAEA in particular”.</p>
<p><b>783. </b> The panel added that it was:</p>
<p>“… essential that inspections teams return to Iraq as soon as possible. The current </p>
<p>absence of inspectors in Iraq has exponentially increased the risk of compromising </p>
<p>the level of assurance already achieved, since it is widely recognised that the </p>
<p>re-establishment of the baseline [of the status of Iraq’s activity] will be a difficult </p>
<p>task. The loss of technical confidence in the system could become irretrievable.”</p>
<p><b>784. </b> The panel concluded that the “effectiveness of the monitoring and verification </p>
<p>regime” depended on its being “comprehensive and intrusive” with the “full exercise of </p>
<p>the rights of full and free access set forth in relevant Security Council resolutions”. At the </p>
<p>same time, the mandate should be “carried out objectively in a technically competent </p>
<p>and thorough manner with due regard to Iraqi sovereignty, dignity and sensitivities”.</p>
<p><b>785. </b> “Given the difficulties experienced in the past” this was likely to require “firm and </p>
<p>active support by the Security Council”:</p>
<p>“To be effective, any system has to be deployed on the ground, which is impossible </p>
<p>without Iraqi acceptance. How this acceptance will be obtained is the fundamental </p>
<p>question before the Security Council.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>792. </b> In a reference to international security, Mr Blair identified “two dangerous and </p>
<p>ruthless men – Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic” as the cause of “many of our </p>
<p>problems”. Iraq had been “reduced to poverty, with political life stultified through fear”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair suggested that international security should be addressed at the NATO Summit </p>
<p>by establishing a new framework:</p>
<p>“No longer is our existence as states under threat … our actions are guided by a </p>
<p>more subtle blend of mutual self-interest and moral purpose in defending the values </p>
<p>we cherish. In the end values and interests merge. If we can establish and spread </p>
<p>the values of liberty, the rule of law, human rights and an open society then that is in </p>
<p>our national interest too.</p>
<p>“The most pressing foreign policy problem we face is to identify the circumstances </p>
<p>in which we should get actively involved in other people’s conflicts. Non-interference </p>
<p>has long been considered an important principle of international order. And it is not </p>
<p>one we would want to jettison too readily … But the principle of non-interference </p>
<p>must be qualified …</p>
<p>“So how do we decide when and whether to intervene.”</p>
<p><b>793. </b> Mr Blair set out “five major considerations” to guide such a decision:</p>
<p>“First, are we sure of our case? War is an imperfect instrument for righting </p>
<p>humanitarian distress; but armed force is sometimes the only means of dealing with </p>
<p>dictators. Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? We should always </p>
<p>give peace every chance, as we have in the case of Kosovo. Third, on the basis of </p>
<p>a practical assessment of the situation, are there military operations we can sensibly </p>
<p>and prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? In the past, we </p>
<p>talked too much of exit strategies. But having made a commitment we cannot simply </p>
<p>walk away once the fight is over; better to stay with moderate numbers of troops </p>
<p>than return for repeat performances with large numbers. And finally, do we have </p>
<p>national interests involved?”</p>
<p><b>794. </b> Mr Blair argued that acts of genocide could never be a purely internal matter, and </p>
<p>that when oppression produced massive flows of refugees which unsettled neighbouring </p>
<p>countries, that could “properly be described as ‘threats to international peace and </p>
<p>security’”; a reference to the provisions of the UN Charter (see Box, ‘The Charter </p>
<p>framework for the use of force’, earlier in this Section).</p>
<p><b>795. </b> The five considerations were not to be “absolute tests”; they were the “kind </p>
<p>of issues we need to think about in deciding in the future when and whether we </p>
<p>will intervene”.</p>
<p><b>796. </b> Mr Blair also argued that the new rules would only work if there were reformed </p>
<p>international institutions to apply them and that “If we want a world ruled by law and </p>
<p>by international co-operation then we have to support the UN as its central pillar.”</p>

<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>797. </b> In a message specifically to the US, Mr Blair warned that “those nations which </p>
<p>have the power, have the responsibility” and that the US should “never fall again for </p>
<p>the doctrine of isolationism”. He added:</p>
<p>“… in Britain you have a friend and an ally that will stand with you, work with you, </p>
<p>fashion with you the design of a future built on peace and prosperity for all, which </p>
<p>is the only dream that makes humanity worth preserving.”</p>
<p><b>798. </b> The speech attracted considerable attention and acclaim, including in the US. In </p>
<p>his memoir, Mr Blair described it as “an explicit rejection of the narrow view of national </p>
<p>interest”.</p>

<p><b>Cabinet discusses Iraq strategy, May 1999</b></p>
<p><b>799. </b> Mr Cook and Mr Robertson circulated a Joint Memorandum on Future Strategy </p>
<p>towards Iraq to members of DOP</p>
<p> </p>
<p>on 17 May 1999.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> It set out the short, medium </p>
<p>and long-term objectives for UK policy against a background of international concern </p>
<p>about the adverse humanitarian impact of sanctions and a shortfall in “Oil-for-Food” </p>
<p>revenues (US$4bn in the previous year) against assessed need (US$10.6bn per annum </p>
<p>recommended by Mr Annan). There had been “extensive deterioration of essential </p>
<p>infrastructure and social services, a sharp decline in industrial and agricultural output </p>
<p>and worsening social indicators”. The Joint Memorandum identified the Government’s </p>
<p>policy objectives towards Iraq since 1991 as:</p>
<p>“… in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam poses to the region, including </p>
<p>by eliminating his Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) programmes; and, in the </p>
<p>longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law-abiding member of the </p>
<p>international community.”</p>
<p><b>800. </b> The Joint Memorandum recorded that the UK had sought to achieve those aims </p>
<p>“by a policy of containment, through active support of UNSCOM/IAEA efforts to complete </p>
<p>WMD disarmament in Iraq, diplomatic pressure and sanctions, backed by the threat and, </p>
<p>as necessary, use of military force”. That had been the US approach “although they flirt </p>
<p>with a harder line”.</p>
<p><b>801. </b> On the success of that policy and its longer-term prospects, the Joint Memorandum </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“Containment has kept the lid on Saddam … But containment has disadvantages: </p>
<p>it does not produce rapid or decisive results; it is resource-intensive, requiring </p>
<p>constant diplomatic effort and a significant military presence; and it is not always </p>

<p>easy to justify to public opinion, as criticisms of UK/US air strikes and of the </p>
<p>humanitarian impact of sanctions has shown.”</p>
<p><b>802. </b> Addressing future policy, the Joint Memorandum stated:</p>
<p>“However difficult it may become to sustain a policy of containment, it is not clear </p>
<p>what the alternative would be. To simply walk away from the problem would be an </p>
<p>admission of failure, and leave Saddam free to pose once more a major threat to </p>
<p>regional security and British interests. On the other hand, a policy of trying to topple </p>
<p>Saddam would command no useful international support …</p>
<p>“Containment, therefore, remains the only viable option for achieving our policy </p>
<p>objectives. <i>If</i> Iraq complied with UNSCRs, we should then lift sanctions …</p>
<p>“If, on the other hand, Iraq does not co-operate with the UN (let alone comply with </p>
<p>the UNSCRs), we face the prospect of indefinite containment from outside Iraq, </p>
<p>based on sanctions, external monitoring and control, and the threat of military force </p>
<p>if Saddam seeks to threaten his neighbours or reconstitute his WMD capabilities …”</p>
<p><b>803. </b> The Joint Memorandum recommended that securing international support would </p>
<p>require a willingness to agree a package of measures “which ‘middle-ground’ UNSC </p>
<p>opinion would regard as reasonable”. It suggested a draft UNSCR, offering a balanced </p>
<p>package based on increasing and improving the “Oil-for-Food” programme, the prospect </p>
<p>of permitting foreign investment in Iraq’s oil infrastructure to increase output, and the </p>
<p>possible suspension of export restrictions in return for co-operation and substantial </p>
<p>progress towards compliance and effective arms control with some prospect of sanctions </p>
<p>lift. The ideal would be an in-country arms control regime but “not at any price”: the UK </p>
<p>should continue to press the US to offer “light at the end of the tunnel”, but not “buy Iraqi </p>
<p>co-operation by prematurely suspending or lifting sanctions”.</p>
<p><b>804. </b> The Joint Memorandum concluded that the policy of containment remained the </p>
<p>only viable way to pursue the UK’s policy objectives. Iraq was unlikely to accept the </p>
<p>package immediately but “might be persuaded to acquiesce eventually”.</p>
<p><b>805. </b> Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, commented that </p>
<p>containment would not solve the pressing issue of ensuring that the basic needs of the </p>
<p>Iraqi people were met; and that, although there had been “an extensive exchange of </p>
<p>correspondence”, she hoped it would be “possible to have the opportunity to discuss </p>
<p>these very difficult issues with Ministerial colleagues”.</p>

<p>to remove sanctions and resume normal relations with Iraq.</p>
<p><b>807. </b> The deadlock on a resolution addressing all the outstanding issues on Iraq led </p>

<p><b>809. </b> Mr Tan Sri Hasmy Agam, Malaysian Permanent Representative to the UN, stated </p>
<p>that the seven-day extension clearly established a linkage to the discussions on the </p>

<p>with the Tripartite Commission and asked the Secretary-General to report to the Council </p>
<p>every four months on Iraq’s compliance.</p>
<p><b>817. </b> The provisions on humanitarian issues included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>abolishing the ceiling on the export of Iraq’s petroleum and petroleum products </p>
<p>by authorising States to permit the import of “any volume”, notwithstanding the </p>
<p>provisions of resolution 661 (1990);</p>

<p>production and export capacity and to make recommendations … on alternatives </p>
<p>for increasing” that capacity.</p>
<p><b>818. </b> Finally, the resolution expressed the Council’s intention “upon receipt of reports </p>
<p>from the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director General of the IAEA” that </p>
<p>Iraq had “co-operated in all respects with UNMOVIC and the IAEA and in particular in </p>
<p>fulfilling the work programmes …. for a period of 120 days after” the reinforced system </p>
<p>of OMV was reported to be fully operational, to “suspend” sanctions on the import of </p>
<p>materials originating in Iraq or the export of items to Iraq (other than those referred to </p>
<p>in paragraph 24 of resolution 687 (1991) or controlled by the mechanism established </p>
<p>by resolution 1051 (1996)), “for a period of 120 days renewable by the Council”. </p>
<p>Action to suspend sanctions would be considered “no later than 12 months” from the </p>
<p>adoption of the resolution, “provided the conditions set out” in this paragraph had been </p>
<p>“satisfied by Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>819. </b> The draft resolution had been tabled by the UK, and many members of the Council </p>
<p>praised the skill and perseverance of Sir Jeremy Greenstock and his delegation in </p>
<p>producing a draft which the majority of the Council could support after almost a year </p>
<p>of deadlock on Iraq.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> It is clear, however, that there were still significant differences </p>
<p>about the interpretation of the resolution and the way ahead. As a result, China, France, </p>
<p>Malaysia and Russia abstained in the vote, but there was no veto.</p>
<p><b>820. </b> Mr Lavrov explicitly blamed the use of force by the US and UK in December </p>
<p>1998 for the deadlock in the Council, stating that the action had been “provoked by the </p>
<p>biased and tendentious report” from UNSCOM. Russian proposals in April 1999, for a </p>
<p>draft resolution approving the recommendations of the Amorim panels and instructing </p>
<p>the Secretary-General “to prepare practical steps for implementing them”, had been </p>
<p>“blocked by those who wanted … to continue using the burden of anti-Iraq sanctions </p>
<p>in order to attain their own unilateral goals, going beyond the scope of United Nations </p>
<p>decisions”.</p>
<p><b>821. </b> Mr Lavrov welcomed the provisions to suspend sanctions, the “radical </p>
<p>improvements in the humanitarian programme”, and the measures related to speeding </p>
<p>up action on missing persons and Kuwaiti property. He also welcomed the corrections </p>
<p>to “harmful provisions” in previous drafts of the resolution, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removing the “discredited argument about full co-operation”; Russia had </p>
<p>“always stressed that the wording ‘full co-operation’” was “extremely dangerous”, </p>
<p>and “Nobody has forgotten that it was under the pretext of an absence of full </p>

<p>co-operation from Iraq that the former Special Commission provoked large-scale </p>
<p>strikes by the United States and Great Britain against Iraq in December last </p>
<p>year, circumventing the Security Council”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>introducing a “clarification … to the effect that progress on the remaining </p>
<p>disarmament tasks – not their virtual completion – would be grounds for </p>
<p>assessing the conditions necessary to the suspension of sanctions”; vague </p>
<p>wording in an earlier draft would have “provided certain members of the Council” </p>
<p>with “an opportunity to … require virtually full completion of the key disarmament </p>
<p>tasks … and then, on that pretext, to postpone suspension endlessly”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removing wording about “control of the financial aspects of the suspension, </p>
<p>which essentially predetermined the continuation of the sanctions regime in </p>
<p>another guise”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>spelling out more clearly the reference to Chapter VII “so as not to provide any </p>
<p>legal grounds for unilateral actions of force against Iraq contrary to positions </p>
<p>held in the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>822. </b> Russia could not support the draft resolution because of “deficiencies of the draft </p>
<p>resolution and some hidden dangers that remain” and it would “not forget that certain </p>
<p>countries still have their own agendas with respect to Iraq that may be at variance with </p>
<p>the collective position of the Security Council”. The Council had “never authorized the </p>
<p>establishment of the ‘No-Fly Zones’”, nor had it authorised “subversive acts against </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government”. If the Council sought “truly new approaches … to a long-term </p>
<p>settlement in the Gulf, such illegal, unilateral actions must end”.</p>
<p><b>823. </b> But Russia had decided “not to hinder” adoption of the resolution because </p>
<p>“serious changes” had been introduced which offered “an opportunity to break the </p>
<p>Iraqi stalemate”.</p>
<p><b>824. </b> Mr Lavrov warned:</p>
<p>“The fact that we are not blocking the adoption of this imperfect draft resolution </p>
<p>should not be taken to indicate that we are obliged to play along with attempts </p>
<p>to impose its forcible implementation …</p>
<p>“… Judging from existing objective assessments, Iraq is already no threat to </p>
<p>international and regional peace and security. In any event, no concrete proof has </p>
<p>been submitted to the Council in recent years.</p>
<p>“It is now up to the Security Council to act objectively and in an unbiased way …</p>
<p>“… it is important that … it has been possible to avoid a split … and to confirm the </p>
<p>key role of the Council in the political settlement of the most important problems of </p>
<p>the world today … Russia will continue to do its utmost to strengthen that role.”</p>
<p><b>825. </b> Mr Hasmy stated that the issue before the Council was “not just … asserting its </p>
<p>authority and reclaiming its credibility … but equally importantly … restoring confidence </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>and trust between the Council and Iraq”. The draft resolution did not incorporate </p>
<p>concerns expressed by Malaysia and others, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the omission of financial modalities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the vague language “full of conditionalities” in respect of the triggering of </p>
<p>suspensions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of a definite benchmark or timeframe for the final lifting of </p>
<p>sanctions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the indefinite continuation of the sanctions which violated “the very spirit and </p>
<p>purposes” of the UN Charter;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the improvements in arrangements for humanitarian programmes which were </p>
<p>“selective” and would “only lead to incremental improvements and address a </p>
<p>small fraction of the needs of the Iraqi people”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Malaysia’s proposal that the Council should give a hearing to Iraq’s views, on </p>
<p>the basis that “engaging Iraq, rather than isolating and demonizing it”.</p>
<p><b>826. </b> The draft resolution was:</p>
<p>“… driven largely by political, rather than humanitarian, considerations. It is aimed at </p>
<p>keeping Iraq under continued isolation rather than bringing it out into the mainstream </p>
<p>of international life … The language of the draft resolution is ambiguous in some </p>
<p>important parts, so that it may lend itself to unilateral interpretation and/or action </p>
<p>in its implementation, which must be avoided.”</p>
<p><b>827. </b> Mr Qin Huasun stated that three core issues would have to be addressed </p>
<p>in formulating new policies on Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An “objective, impartial, transparent and accountable” inspection commission </p>
<p>should replace UNSCOM which “under the leadership of its previous Executive </p>
<p>Chairman … continuously concealed information from the Council, deceived </p>
<p>and misled the Council and even went so far as to act presumptuously without </p>
<p>authorisation by the Council, thus playing a dishonourable role in triggering </p>
<p>the crisis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The remaining disarmament issues should be “defined clearly and precisely and </p>
<p>resolved gradually and effectively”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “an urgent need to relieve the … tremendous, inhumane suffering” </p>
<p>of the people of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Mr Qin Huasun added that those issues could be resolved only if the resolution </p>
<p>could be implemented; and that was “highly questionable” because it did not give Iraq </p>
<p>the “light at the end of the tunnel”. The Council was being “rushed … into action” which </p>
<p>would “not help to resolve” the issue. Nor would it “really help to preserve the authority </p>
<p>and role of the Council”. There had been “a worrying trend” over the past year. Iraq </p>
<p>and Kosovo had “clearly demonstrated that the wilful use of force, especially unilateral </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>1.1  |  UK Iraq strategy 1990 to 2000</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>actions taken without the Council’s authorisation”, severely damaged the status and </p>
<p>authority of the Council and complicated the situation.</p>
<p><b>829. </b> Mr Qin Huasun concluded by calling for an end to the NFZs, which flew “in the </p>
<p>face of international law and the authority of the Council”.</p>
<p><b>830. </b> Mr Dejammet stated that France had observed in January 1999 that the top priority </p>
<p>was the restoration of security and stability with the “long-term presence on the ground </p>
<p>of professional inspectors” to prevent the arming of Iraq and ensuring that sanctions did </p>
<p>not punish the Iraqi population. The Council had agreed that the “relationship between </p>
<p>Iraq and the United Nations needed to be set on a new footing”.</p>
<p><b>831. </b> Mr Dejammet stated that the draft resolution called upon Iraq “to accept the </p>
<p>return of the inspectors without knowing what arrangement will exist in the period </p>
<p>after suspension”. If the interpretations of the text diverged, the Chairman of the new </p>
<p>Commission would not be able to carry out his mandate and it was not clear how the </p>
<p>Council would be able to reach a decision on when sanctions should be suspended.</p>
<p><b>832. </b> Mr Burleigh stated that the resolution did not raise the bar on what was required </p>
<p>of Iraq on disarmament, but nor did it lower it. There was no lack of clarity about the </p>
<p>sequence of events, Iraq’s compliance “must precede all else”. Identifying the “key </p>
<p>remaining disarmament tasks” needed to be addressed. If Iraq fulfilled those tasks </p>
<p>and met the requirements in the resolution:</p>
<p>“… the Council, including the United States, can decide whether to recognize that </p>
<p>co-operation and compliance by suspending sanctions.</p>
<p>“Similarly, if Iraq meets the full range of obligations … the Council can make </p>
<p>a decision regarding the lifting of sanctions.”</p>
<p><b>833. </b> Mr Burleigh added that the US was “not seeking an excuse to use force”, but Iraq </p>
<p>held the key. The US had “no illusion that the Iraqi regime” was “likely to change its </p>
<p>spots”. Compliance was “highly unlikely” while Saddam Hussein remained in power.</p>
<p><b>834. </b> Mr Burleigh also stated that, before sanctions could be suspended, there would </p>
<p>be a need to decide the exact terms for lifting prohibitions to “prevent any revenues </p>
<p>from being diverted for prohibited purposes” and “effective control measures” for civilian </p>
<p>imports into Iraq were of the “utmost importance”.</p>
<p><b>835. </b> Mr Jassim Mohammed Buallay, Bahraini Permanent Representative to the </p>
<p>UN, drew attention to the fact that Iraq “had already declared its total rejection of </p>
<p>the resolution”.</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Mr Peter van Walsum, Dutch Permanent Representative to the UN, said that </p>
<p>the statements of the Iraqi authorities gave no indication that they would be prepared </p>
<p>to co-operate “other than on the basis of an unconditional lifting of the sanctions, and </p>
<p>no member of the Council has shown any readiness to meet that condition”. He also </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>disputed the suggestion that Iraq could not see light at the end of the tunnel. The </p>
<p>existing resolutions already clearly illuminated “the exit” and the present resolution </p>
<p>added “significantly to that by offering Iraq a possible suspension of sanctions well </p>
<p>before full compliance”. But co-operation was not “a question of attitude” but about </p>
<p>“performance”; and he thought it was “not realistic to expect an early positive signal </p>
<p>from Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>837. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that holding Iraq to its obligations and containing </p>
<p>the threat to the peace and security of the region was “one of the most important </p>
<p>responsibilities of the international community, and in particular of the Security Council”. </p>
<p>Throughout 1999, the Council had worked to find a “new approach” to business with </p>
<p>Iraq which was “firmly set in the framework of a collective responsibility exercised within </p>
<p>the United Nations”. The resolution preserved “the original disarmament standards for </p>
<p>Iraq” and met humanitarian concerns while belatedly recognising “just how dire Iraq’s </p>
<p>response has been to its obligations with regard to missing Kuwaiti citizens and property”. </p>
<p>“Most significantly”, it set out “a series of clear, logical steps, using the new concept of </p>
<p>suspension to bring Iraq out of sanctions and back into the international community”. But </p>
<p>that would happen “only if Iraq at last begins to act according to the rules of international </p>
<p>law”; and its track record and recent rhetoric were “hardly encouraging”.</p>
<p><b>838. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded by calling for full support in the Council in bringing the </p>
<p>provisions of the mandatory resolution into effect, for the benefit of “the peoples of Iraq </p>
<p>and of the region” and in the “interests of the future authority” of the UN.</p>
<p><b>839. </b> The UK’s short-term objective had been “an agreed Security Council approach on </p>
<p>the way forward … allowing us to draw a line under the differences which developed </p>
<p>over Operation Desert Fox”.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>840. </b> A note for No.10 on the background to the inspections process, produced in March </p>
<p>2002 by FCO Research Analysts, stated that the “main feature” of resolution 1284 was </p>
<p>that it offered Iraq “a suspension of sanctions in return for co-operation with the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors, including progress on key disarmament tasks”, in contrast to resolution 687 </p>
<p>(1991) which offered lifting of sanctions “only when the inspectors say disarmament </p>
<p>is complete”.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> Iraq regarded the latter as “an unattainable goal”, claiming that the </p>
<p>resolution was “so ambiguous” that the US could “easily deny” that co-operation had </p>
<p>been “adequate”.</p>
<p><b>841. </b> The paper also stated:</p>
<p>“We recognise there are ambiguities … They are there for a good reason: the P5 </p>
<p>was unable to reach agreement. If positions remain as entrenched as they were </p>
<p>during … negotiations, there is little prospect of the situation changing …”</p>

<p><b>842. </b> Mr Ekéus commented to the Inquiry that the Security Council had “dissolved … </p>
<p>arguably [the] most successful inspection regime in disarmament history” and suggested </p>
<p>it was “the British Government and its Foreign Secretary Robin Cook that enforced the </p>
<p>dissolution of UNSCOM … in spite of American doubts and hesitations”.</p>

<p><b>843. </b> Dr Hans Blix, the Director General of the IAEA until November 1997, was </p>
<p>appointed Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and took up his appointment in New York </p>
<p>on 1 March 2000.</p>
<p><b>844. </b> Dr Blix wrote:</p>
<p>“The inspectors were gone. The sanctions were condemned by a broad world </p>
<p>opinion and … they had become less painful, and were eroding … The revenues </p>
<p>from the Oil-for-Food Program provided many billions of dollars and huge purchase </p>
<p>orders were so placed as to produce maximum political benefit – or punishment.”</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>845. </b> In an interview published in March 2000, Mr Ekéus stated that UNSCOM had been </p>
<p>“highly successful”, but had not destroyed “everything”; and the “contradictions” in Iraq’s </p>
<p>declarations meant that there was “reason to be careful”.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p> There was “new information </p>
<p>about procurement efforts by Iraq” and useful information from individuals who had </p>
<p>left Iraq.</p>
<p><b>846. </b> Mr Ekéus added that, in his view, there were “no large quantities of weapons”. Iraq </p>
<p>was not “especially eager in the biological and chemical area to produce such weapons </p>
<p>for storage” because it viewed them as “tactical assets” and its aim was “to keep the </p>
<p>capability to start up production immediately should it need to”.</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Mr Ekéus stated that it was “striking” that resolution 1284 (1999) said “nothing </p>
<p>about investigation and elimination” of Iraq’s prohibited weapons, but focused on </p>
<p>monitoring activities. The Security Council was trying to get UNMOVIC “to be more </p>
<p>precise” about its tasks. He considered that Iraq would “probably co-operate” if it judged </p>
<p>the provisions on suspending sanctions were acceptable. The unity of the Security </p>
<p>Council was essential; political problems in the Council were “the single, dominant and </p>
<p>only reason” for the failure of UNSCOM.</p>
<p><b>848. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote:</p>
<p>“In 2000, little new work was done on Iraq, with the Security Council largely </p>
