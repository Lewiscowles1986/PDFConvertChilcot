<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the UK planning for a military invasion of Iraq and the </p>
<p>decisions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>on 31 October 2002 to offer ground forces to the US for planning purposes for </p>
<p>operations in northern Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in December to deploy an amphibious force, including 3 Commando Brigade. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision in mid&#8209;January 2003 to deploy a divisional headquarters and three </p>
<p>combat brigades for potential operations in southern Iraq and the commitment </p>
<p>of those forces to a combat role in the initial stages of the invasion of Iraq. </p>
<p>That is addressed in Section 6.2. That Section also sets out the principles of </p>
<p>international humanitarian law (IHL) governing the conduct of military operations, </p>
<p>including control of targeting decisions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The campaign plan for the invasion which is addressed in Section 8. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The roles and responsibilities of the Defence Secretary, the Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff (CDS), the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), and other key </p>
<p>military officers and civilians, and the way in which advice was prepared for </p>
<p>Ministers and decisions taken in the MOD in 2002 and 2003. They are set out in </p>
<p>Section 2.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decisions on the wider UK strategy and options in relation to Iraq which are </p>
<p>necessary to understand the wider context surrounding military deployments. </p>
<p>Those are addressed in Section 3. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s assessments of Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic </p>
<p>missile programmes and its intentions to retain and conceal its weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction (WMD) capabilities. They are addressed in Section 4.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The consideration of the legal basis for military action, which is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The preparations to equip the force for operations in Iraq, and the implications of </p>
<p>the decisions between mid&#8209;December 2002 and mid&#8209;January 2003 to increase </p>
<p>the size of UK combat forces and be ready to take an earlier role in the invasion </p>
<p>in support of US forces. They are addressed in Section 6.3.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The funding for the operation, which is addressed in Section 13.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The planning and preparations for the UK military contribution post&#8209;conflict, </p>
<p>including decisions on the UK’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) for UK military </p>
<p>forces. They are addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The size and composition of a UK military contribution to the US&#8209;led invasion of </p>
<p>Iraq was largely discretionary. The US wanted some UK capabilities (including </p>
<p>Special Forces) to use UK bases, and the involvement of the UK military to avoid the </p>
<p>perception of unilateral US military action. The primary impetus to maximise the size </p>
<p>of the UK contribution and the recommendations on its composition came from the </p>
<p>Armed Forces, with the agreement of Mr Hoon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From late February 2002, the UK judged that Saddam Hussein’s regime could only </p>
<p>be removed by a US&#8209;led invasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In April 2002, the MOD advised that, if the US mounted a major military operation, the </p>
<p>UK should contribute a division comprising three brigades. That was perceived to be </p>
<p>commensurate with the UK’s capabilities and the demands of the campaign. Anything </p>
<p>smaller risked being compared adversely to the UK’s contribution to the liberation of </p>
<p>Kuwait in 1991. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD saw a significant military contribution as a means of influencing US </p>
<p>decisions. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair and Mr Hoon wanted to keep open the option of contributing significant </p>
<p>forces for ground operations as long as possible, but between May and mid&#8209;October </p>
<p>consistently pushed back against US assumptions that the UK would provide </p>
<p>a division.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Air and maritime forces were offered to the US for planning purposes in September. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD advised in October that the UK was at risk of being excluded from US </p>
<p>plans unless it offered ground forces, “Package 3”, on the same basis as air and </p>
<p>maritime forces. That could also significantly reduce the UK’s vulnerability to US </p>
<p>requests to provide a substantial and costly contribution to post&#8209;conflict operations. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>From August until December 2002, other commitments meant that UK planning </p>
<p>for Package 3 was based on providing a divisional headquarters and an armoured </p>
<p>brigade for operations in northern Iraq. That was seen as the maximum practicable </p>
<p>contribution the UK could generate within the predicted timescales for US action.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The deployment was dependent on Turkey’s agreement to the transit of UK forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair agreed to offer Package 3 on 31 October 2002.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That decision and its potential consequences were not formally considered by a </p>
<p>Cabinet Committee or reported to Cabinet. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In December 2002, the deployment of 3 Commando Brigade was identified as a way </p>
<p>for the UK to make a valuable contribution in the initial stages of a land campaign </p>
<p>if transit through Turkey was refused. The operational risks were not explicitly </p>
<p>addressed. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following a visit to Turkey on 7 to 8 January 2003, Mr Hoon concluded that there </p>
<p>would be no agreement to the deployment of UK ground forces through Turkey.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By that time, in any case, the US had asked the UK to deploy for operations in </p>
<p>southern Iraq. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>MOD Defence Planning Assumptions</b></p>
<p><b>3.  The Armed Forces’ capacity to deploy and sustain expeditionary operations </b></p>
<p><b>was determined by decisions in the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review.</i> </b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> Defence Planning Assumptions (DPAs) were developed by the MOD to convert policy </p>
<p>into detailed guidance that could be used by military planners.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> They outline the levels </p>
<p>of activity the Armed Forces plan to be able to undertake, and the contexts in which </p>
<p>they are expected to operate. They are used to identify and resource the planned force </p>
<p>structure, capabilities and equipment of the Armed Forces. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> The DPAs extant in 2002&#8209;2003 were those defined in the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence </i></p>
<p><i>Review</i> (SDR 98). It identified eight <b>Missions</b> which the Armed Forces could be </p>
<p>expected to undertake, which were further divided into 28 <b>Military Tasks</b>. The Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions defined the required level of forces, or <b>scale of effort</b>, allocated to each </p>
<p>Military Task. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> In relation to the ability to deploy forces to deal with overseas crises, SDR 98 stated </p>
<p>that the objective was to “be able to make a reasonable contribution to multi&#8209;national </p>
<p>operations” in support of the UK’s “foreign and security policy objectives”. On that basis </p>
<p>“broad benchmarks” had been set for planning that the UK should be able to:</p>
<p>“– respond to a major international crisis which might require a military effort and </p>
<p>combat operations of a similar scale and duration to the Gulf War when we deployed </p>
<p>an armoured division, 26 major warships and over 80 combat aircraft. </p>
<p>“or</p>
<p>“– undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as over the </p>
<p>last few years in Bosnia) while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial </p>
<p>deployment – which might involve a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air </p>
<p>forces – if this were made necessary by a second crisis. We would not, however, </p>
<p>expect both deployments to involve war fighting or to maintain them simultaneously </p>
<p>for longer than six months.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>7. </b> SDR 98 determined that the UK’s land forces should include two “deployable </p>
<p>divisions” and six deployable brigades, three “armoured” and three “mechanised”, </p>
<p>together with two “lighter and more specialised deployable brigades, an airmobile </p>
<p>brigade and the Royal Marine Commando Brigade”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The principal scales of effort defined in SDR 98 were:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>small scale</b>: “a deployment of battalion size or equivalent” such as the Royal </p>
<p>Navy ARMILLA patrol in the Gulf, the British contribution to United Nations </p>
<p>Forces in Cyprus (UNFICYP), and the Royal Air Force operations enforcing the </p>
<p>No&#8209;Fly Zones (NFZs) over northern and southern Iraq;</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>medium scale</b>: “deployments of brigade size or equivalent” for warfighting or </p>
<p>other operations, such as the UK contribution in the mid&#8209;1990s to the NATO&#8209;led </p>
<p>Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia;</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>large scale</b>: deployments of division size or equivalent, the “nearest recent </p>
<p>example” being the UK contribution to the 1991 Gulf Conflict, “although on that </p>
<p>occasion the British division deployed with only two of its three brigades”. That </p>
<p>was “the maximum size of force we would plan to be able to contribute to peace </p>
<p>enforcement operations, or to regional conflicts outside the NATO area”; and</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>very large scale and full scale</b>: all the forces that would be made available </p>
<p>to NATO to meet a major threat such as significant aggression against an ally. </p>
<p>The difference between the two reflected the time available for preparation – </p>
<p>“warning time”, and the size of the threat. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The Planning Assumptions also defined:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>endurance</b>: the likely duration of individual Military Tasks. The force structure </p>
<p>for each Service needed to be able to sustain tasks for the required period, </p>
<p>including where necessary by rotating individual units deployed and, where units </p>
<p>were deployed on operations, allowing units a period of respite between each </p>
<p>deployment as set out in the “Harmony Guidelines”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> of each Service. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>concurrency</b>: the number of operations of a given scale of effort and duration </p>
<p>that could be sustained by the force structure. SDR 98 concluded that “not to </p>
<p>be able to conduct two medium scale operations at the same time would be an </p>
<p>unacceptable constraint on our ability to discharge Britain’s commitments and </p>
<p>responsibilities. It would, for example, oblige us to withdraw from an enduring </p>
<p>commitment such as Bosnia in order to respond to a second crisis.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The Defence Strategic Plan (DSP), a confidential MOD document, included greater </p>
<p>detail than was published in the SDR report.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> It identified specific readiness criteria in </p>
<p>relation to operations against Iraq, stating:</p>
<p>“… we need to maintain the ability to respond within short warning times to an Iraqi </p>
<p>threat, and to build up forces thereafter. This again requires us to hold capabilities </p>
<p>needed to mount a medium scale deployment at high readiness (30 days). For a </p>
<p>4 </p>
<p>Harmony guidelines are explained in Section 16.1.</p>

<p>large scale deployment we need to plan on a framework division being ready within </p>
<p>90 days.” </p>
<p><b>11. </b> The Defence White Paper 1999 stated:</p>
<p>“The assumptions made in the SDR were not intended to be an exact template </p>
<p>for everything we have been called on to do. They were intended rather as a </p>
<p>guide to the long term development of our forces without prejudicing the size of an </p>
<p>actual commitment in particular contingencies … But the SDR provided us with a </p>
<p>demonstrably sound and robust basis for planning and operations of all kinds.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>12. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff from February 2003 to </p>
<p>August 2006, told the Inquiry that the Planning Assumptions were:</p>
<p>“… not just a bit of [an] intellectual experiment … they drive force structures, they </p>
<p>drive stocks, they drive equipment.”</p>

<p><b>The possibility of military invasion emerges</b></p>
<p><b>The impact of 9/11</b></p>
<p><b>13.  After the attacks on the US on 9/11, the UK was concerned that the US might </b></p>
<p><b>take immediate military action against Iraq. </b></p>
<p><b>14. </b> The discussion in the UK about what to do about Iraq in the wake of the attack on </p>
<p>the US on 9/11 and the “war against terrorism”, and the limitations on what the UK knew </p>
<p>about US thinking and military operations, is addressed in Section 3.1. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The UK took the view that the status quo on Iraq was no longer acceptable and that </p>
<p>Iraq’s defiance of the international community would need to be addressed. But the UK </p>
<p>sought to steer the US away from unilateral military action.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by telephone on 3 December 2001.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>conversation was primarily about the position in Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> In a discussion on future options in relation to Iraq, Mr Blair told President Bush that </p>
<p>Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Overseas and </p>
<p>Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), and Sir Richard Dearlove, Chief of the Secret Intelligence </p>
<p>Service (SIS), would be in Washington later that week. That would be an opportunity to </p>
<p>share thinking on “how the next phase might proceed”. </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush a paper, ‘The War Against Terrorism: The Second </p>
<p>Phase’,<i> </i>on 4 December.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>20. </b> The paper comprised an overview of the possible approaches to potential terrorist </p>
<p>threats in seven countries</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> and a ‘Strategy for Confronting Islamic Extremism’ in </p>
<p>moderate Muslim states.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> In relation to Iraq, the key points were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was a threat because: “it has WMD capability; is acquiring more; has shown </p>
<p>its willingness to use it; and can export that capability”. Iraq was in breach of </p>
<p>UN Security Council resolutions 687 (1991), 715 (1991) and 1284 (1999) and </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein supported certain Palestinian terrorist groups and used terror </p>
<p>tactics against Iraqi dissidents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any link to 11 September and Al Qaida (AQ) was “at best very tenuous”.</p>

<p><b>27. </b> On 19 December, Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, held a meeting with Adm </p>

<p>further advice “detailing the current state of operations over Iraq and the political and </p>
<p>military implications of continuing with the current patrolling patterns” and “options for </p>
<p>future action together with their political, legal and military implications”. The options </p>
<p>could be part of “a discrete operation” or “a wider campaign”, and could range from </p>
<p>fewer patrols, maintaining current operations, to an incremental increase and “a </p>
<p>significant large scale operation”.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> It is now public knowledge that President Bush had asked for military options </p>
<p>for action in Iraq to be reviewed in autumn 2001; and that he had been briefed by </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>33. </b> Lord Boyce stated:</p>
<p>“We were flatly saying we are not considering or contemplating military action in </p>

<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>36.  The MOD view in late January 2002 about the wisdom of taking any military </b></p>
<p><b>action was cautious. It identified an opportunity to influence US thinking, which </b></p>
<p><b>was far from settled. </b></p>
<p><b>37. </b> On 24 January 2002, Dr Simon Cholerton, Assistant Director in Secretariat </p>
<p>(Overseas) (Sec(O)), wrote to Mr Hoon, setting out the risks of taking action against Iraqi </p>
<p>air defences in response to Iraqi violations in the No&#8209;Fly Zones.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> That would require </p>
<p>careful handling to avoid being seen as the next phase of “the war on international </p>
<p>terrorism”. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Dr Cholerton discussed the possibility of wider action against Iraq. He emphasised </p>
<p>that neither the MOD nor the FCO had seen any “detailed US planning”. Work on </p>
<p>policy options, at both military and political levels, was continuing in the US but “little, </p>
<p>if anything has been shared with the UK”. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> The case against Iraq, as “a candidate for ‘Phase 2’ in the GWOT [Global War </p>
<p>on Terrorism]”, would be based on the threat to US national security posed by Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction programme in the absence of any evidence of Iraqi </p>
<p>involvement in the 9/11 attacks. US thinking was far from settled and there “should be </p>
<p>a window of opportunity to influence the US position”.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Dr Cholerton also advised that the “initial assessment of the efficacy (never mind </p>
<p>the legality) of military action to effect regime change is that it is poor”. He drew attention </p>
<p>to the work commissioned by Mr Tebbit in December 2001, which had addressed the </p>
<p>strengths and weaknesses of the INC. That had concluded that there was “no Northern </p>
<p>Alliance equivalent … who could take advantage of precision bombing” in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that the “long experience of patrolling the No&#8209;Fly Zones” </p>
<p>was “a significant factor” in subsequent discussions about military intervention in Iraq:</p>
<p>“There was increasing concern about the risks involved in these operations and the </p>
<p>consequences for example if a British or American aircraft was shot down. It was </p>
<p>certainly speculated at the time that this could lead to military intervention to rescue </p>
<p>downed personnel; and that such operations could lead to a wider engagement.”</p>

<p>“US intent appeared to be to stem the creeping tide of WMD. Given that neither </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 27 FEBRUARY 2002: ‘IRAQ: SADDAM UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT’</p>
<p><b>50.  The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessment of 27 February reached </b></p>
<p><b>the view that, without direct intervention on the ground, the opposition would </b></p>
<p><b>be unable to overthrow Saddam Hussein’s regime. </b></p>
<p><b>51.  If he was unable to deter a US attack, Saddam Hussein would “go down </b></p>
<p><b>fighting and could adopt high risk options”.</b></p>
<p><b>52. </b> At the request of the JIC, an Assessment, ‘Iraq: Saddam Under the Spotlight’, was </p>
<p>produced on 27 February.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> It addressed “Saddam’s threat perceptions and internal </p>
<p>position: whether he is secure, what opposition he faces, and what he is doing to try </p>
<p>and avoid the internal and international threats he faces”. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> The Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam fears a US military attack which would threaten his regime by bringing </p>
<p>about the disintegration of his military and security apparatus. A force on the </p>
<p>scale of Desert Storm (1991) would constitute such a threat.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would permit the return of weapons inspectors if large&#8209;scale </p>
<p>military action was believed to be imminent, but he would seek to frustrate </p>
<p>their efforts. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Special Republican Guard (SRG) remains closely tied to Saddam’s regime </p>
<p>and is likely to resist any attempt to overthrow him. The Republican Guard … </p>
<p>would be relatively resilient under attack but its loyalty in dire straits is more </p>
<p>open to question than the SRG. Other elements of the Iraq military are more </p>
<p>liable to crack if subjected to a strong attack.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “opposition” was “militarily weak and riven by factional differences. They will </p>
<p>not act without visible and sustained US military support on the ground. A coup </p>
<p>or military revolt is only a remote possibility.”</p>
<p><b>54. </b> The JIC also judged that Saddam Hussein did not believe such an attack was </p>
<p>inevitable. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Elaborating the final Key Judgement, the Assessment stated: </p>
<p>“Overall we judge that, <b>unaided, the Iraqi opposition is incapable of </b></p>
<p><b>overthrowing the Iraqi regime; in the present circumstances a coup or </b></p>
<p><b>military revolt remains only a remote possibility</b>. With outside help short of </p>
<p>direct intervention on the ground, the opposition would still be unable to succeed. </p>
<p>Spontaneous mass uprisings might be more important if the regime’s control </p>
<p>wavered, but this is not in prospect; however, it might hasten the regime’s downfall </p>
<p>in conjunction with a massive US attack.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>56. </b> The JIC considered that the Kurds and Shia “would not show their hand until US </p>
<p>resolve to overthrow Saddam” was “absolutely clear”. There was “no obvious leader” </p>
<p>among those groups who was “capable of unifying the opposition” and had “credibility and </p>
<p>popular appeal inside Iraq”. No likely replacement for Saddam Hussein from within the </p>
<p>regime had been identified, but the JIC stated that, in the event of internal change, it was </p>
<p>“likely that any successor would be autocratic and drawn from the Sunni military elite”. </p>
<p>THE MOD PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p><b>57.  The MOD advised Mr Hoon that the UK should not rule out military action </b></p>
<p><b>against Iraq; and that it should think through the options in more depth to improve </b></p>
<p><b>the “prospects for influencing the US towards a successful outcome”.</b></p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Simon Webb, MOD Policy Director, sent Mr Hoon advice on 27 February on </p>
<p>how the UK might approach the three countries referred to by President Bush as an </p>
<p>“axis of evil”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Webb recommended that the UK should acknowledge that the countries posed </p>
<p>“increasing” risks to international stability; and that the US should be persuaded to </p>
<p>explain why. The UK should:</p>
<p>“Encourage a broad&#8209;based approach ranging from diplomacy to challenge </p>
<p>inspections and levers on suppliers.</p>
<p>“Not rule out UK participation in military action against Iraq […] if that is the only way </p>
<p>to stem the tide of WMD proliferation and a worthwhile and legal option exists at </p>
<p>the time.”</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Webb also stated that it was important to distinguish between two strands: the </p>
<p>“direct risks from proliferation” and the “potential association with international terrorism”.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> In the context of the response from European partners, Mr Webb advised:</p>
<p>“… it would be wiser for the UK to take a more complex position supporting the </p>
<p>underlying concerns but advocating a greater mix of possible approaches. No.10 </p>
<p>have started to take this line over the last week but we need to think through the </p>
<p>options in more depth. In this way we have better prospects of influencing the US </p>
<p>towards a successful outcome. Above all we should encourage the US to explain </p>
<p>the issues more effectively …” </p>

<p>which he would “be working with the Cabinet Office” before Mr Blair’s meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush in early April. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> Mr Webb stated: </p>
<p>“If specific military options start to be considered in the US, we would of course seek </p>
<p>his [Mr Hoon’s] guidance on whether the UK should participate in planning.”</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr William Ehrman, FCO Director International Security, who had been shown a </p>
<p>draft of Mr Webb’s advice, raised a number of questions, and asked for a briefing for </p>
<p>himself and Mr William Patey, FCO, Head, Middle East Department (MED), on what </p>
<p>the MOD considered to be the “valid options for military operations in some specific </p>
<p>scenarios against Iraq”.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> Mr Ehrman underlined the potential legal difficulties, including </p>

<p><b>66.  A DIS paper on the possible US military options for removing Saddam </b></p>

<p><b>67.  The paper provides insights into some of the judgements in the JIC </b></p>
<p><b>Assessment of 27 February, the Cabinet Office Options Paper of 8 March, </b></p>
<p><b>and the thinking within the MOD which informed subsequent analysis and </b></p>

<p><b>Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>68. </b> At the request of Air Marshal Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), the </p>
<p>DIS produced a paper examining “US military” options for removing Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>over the next 12 months on 5 March.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> That did not “look at longer&#8209;term options, such </p>
<p>as a covert action programme designed to achieve regime overthrow”. The paper did, </p>
<p>however, consider Saddam Hussein’s options and likely intentions as he was “well </p>
<p>aware of the possibility of action against him”.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Addressing the feasibility of action to topple Saddam Hussein, the paper stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Perception of US intent was critical to all three broad options for regime change.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Assassination or direct targeting of Saddam Hussein and the senior regime </p>
<p>leadership was “unfeasible”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sustained airstrikes alone would not convince the Iraqi populace of US </p>
<p>determination to overthrow the regime. Airstrikes and a widespread insurgency </p>
<p>with US covert action on the ground was a “feasible option”, but it would not </p>
<p>“guarantee success”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Internal forces could only remove Saddam Hussein with the involvement of a </p>
<p>Sunni strongman; but such an individual would be acting to preserve Sunni </p>
<p>hegemony. That was “unlikely to be acceptable to Kurdish and in particular, </p>
<p>Shia insurgents”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK intelligence community had consistently assessed that “the only viable, </p>
<p>long term successor to Saddam will come from within the Sunni security/military </p>
<p>structure”. He would be “unlikely to command popular support” and would be </p>
<p>“forced (and probably inclined) to run Iraq along autocratic lines”. Iraq would </p>
<p>“remain a unitary state”, but its long&#8209;term problems “would not disappear </p>
<p>with Saddam”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “sustained air campaign combined with a ground invasion” would topple </p>
<p>the regime. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> Addressing Iraq’s defences, the DIS wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The disposition of Iraqi forces was “defensive”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would not take offensive action against the Kurds – he knew </p>
<p>that would “definitely provoke US action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Equipment was “increasingly obsolescent” and US air supremacy was “certain”. </p>
<p>Key units might fight, “but the regime could fall quickly”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If softened by an air campaign, and facing US ground forces”, the collapse of </p>
<p>Iraqi Regular Army (RA) units “could be as swift as it was in 1991, particularly </p>
<p>given the lack of a viable air force. The regime would quickly lose control of </p>
<p>the South …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the RA and the Republican Guard Forces Command (RGFC) “decided that </p>
<p>they [were] defending the Iraqi homeland and Sunni dominance rather than </p>
<p>just Saddam Hussein” they were “more likely to offer a tenacious and </p>
<p>protracted resistance”.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Addressing the possibility of Iraq using WMD, the DIS wrote that it had “no definitive </p>
<p>intelligence” on Iraq’s concepts for the use of WMD:</p>
<p>“Iraq did not employ WMD against coalition forces … [in 1991], nor against </p>
<p>the subsequent internal uprisings. We judge that Saddam wished to avoid </p>
<p>regime&#8209;threatening retaliation from the coalition. Hence the use of WMD will be linked </p>
<p>to perception of regime survivability. Were the regime in danger of imminent collapse, </p>
<p>Saddam might consider use of WMD against internal opposition, US forces or Israel.”</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Other points made by the DIS included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US would need three to four months to assemble a force capable of taking </p>
<p>military action. It was “conceivable” that it could be ready to begin the first </p>
<p>phase of an air campaign in May (when the UN was next due to review Iraq) </p>
<p>“but late summer would be better, not least to avoid ground operations in the </p>
<p>summer heat”.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Turkey would be wary of any regime change plan that encouraged or created </p>
<p>the conditions in which Kurdish separatism may grow in strength. It wanted </p>
<p>a stable, unitary and secular Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq would remain a unitary state but many of the structural problems would </p>
<p>remain and: “We should also expect considerable anti&#8209;Western sentiment </p>
<p>among a populace that has experienced ten years of sanctions.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A US attempt to create a more equitable long&#8209;term distribution of power in </p>
<p>Iraq would require massive and lengthy commitment. Modern Iraq has been </p>
<p>dominated politically, militarily and socially by the Sunni. To alter that would </p>
<p>entail re&#8209;creation of Iraq’s civil, political and military structures. That would </p>
<p>require a US&#8209;directed transition of power (ie US troops occupying Baghdad) </p>
<p>and support thereafter. Ten years seems a not unrealistic time span for such </p>
<p>a project.”</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>90. </b> The Cabinet Office paper did not make any recommendations but analysed two </p>
<p>broad options: toughening the existing containment policy, and regime change by </p>
<p>military means. The points made in the paper included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An improved containment policy would make a sanctions regime more attractive </p>
<p>and reduce Iraq’s illicit revenues. The return of the inspectors would also allow </p>
<p>greater scrutiny of Iraq’s WMD programme and security forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some of the difficulties with the existing policy would, however, still apply and </p>
<p>the US had lost confidence in containment. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The only certain means to remove Saddam Hussein and his elite was to invade </p>
<p>and impose a new government. That would be a new departure which would </p>
<p>require the construction of a coalition and a legal justification.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Internal regime change in Iraq was likely to result in government by another </p>
<p>Sunni military strongman. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the US and others committed to nation&#8209;building for many years, </p>
<p>“a representative broadly democratic government” was possible but the </p>
<p>paper concluded it would be Sunni&#8209;led.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of overriding force in a ground campaign was the only option to offer </p>
<p>confidence that Saddam Hussein would be removed and bring Iraq back into </p>
<p>the international community.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No legal justification for an invasion currently existed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A staged approach, establishing international support, should be considered.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Military liaison officers with CENTCOM in Tampa, Florida, focused on operations in </p>
<p>Afghanistan and the No&#8209;Fly Zones over Iraq, were aware that a policy of ‘NOFORN’ (no </p>
<p>disclosure of information to anyone who was not a US citizen; a foreigner) planning on </p>
<p>Iraq was under way. Rumours about CENTCOM planning on Iraq had been reported to </p>
<p>Lt Gen Pigott on 8 March:</p>
<p>“It is clear that planning is being conducted, and enablers are being put in place </p>
<p>for a major air and land campaign in Iraq. It is clear that no political decisions have </p>
<p>yet been made. Furthermore, temperatures over the summer and an apparent </p>
<p>6 month+ timescale for reconstitution of … stocks suggest a start date not before </p>
<p>Oct[ober] 02.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>96. </b> General Reith told the Inquiry that he had “about 40 people … working with </p>
<p>CENTCOM, about 20 as embedded staff and 20 with my liaison team.”</p>

<p>The United Nations Security Council adopted resolution 1386 on 20 December 2001.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That recognised that the responsibility for providing security and law and order throughout </p>
<p>Afghanistan resided with the Afghans themselves. The resolution noted the reported </p>
<p>request from the Afghan authorities for a United Nations authorised international security </p>
<p>force, and authorised the establishment of an International Security Assistance Force </p>
<p>(ISAF) in Afghanistan for six months. It also welcomed the UK offer to lead in organising </p>
<p>and commanding the Force. </p>
<p>ISAF’s role was to assist the Afghan Interim Authority in the maintenance of security </p>
<p>in Kabul and its surrounding areas.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> The British contribution was known as Operation </p>
<p>VERITAS.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>The Force was initially commanded by Major General John McColl and became fully </p>
<p>operational from 18 February 2002.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> The UK provided an infantry battlegroup based </p>
<p>in Kabul and, until March 2002, a subordinate headquarters provided by 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade.</p>
<p>On 18 March, the Force comprised more than 4,600 personnel from 18 nations, including </p>
<p>some 1,600 UK troops deployed on Operation VERITAS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, and in response to a formal US request for forces to join military operations </p>
<p>against Al Qaida and the Taliban, Mr Hoon announced the separate deployment of a </p>
<p>further battlegroup, built around 45 Commando Royal Marines, of up to 1,700 personnel </p>

<p>Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“… the troops were supported by the majority of the people in Afghanistan and would </p>
<p>not be seeking to occupy territory, there was substantial United States air cover and </p>
<p>there were troops from several Coalition partners involved. There was no parallel with </p>
<p>the occupation of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. The total number of British forces </p>
<p>engaged in operations related to Afghanistan was substantial, but still only one&#8209;tenth </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>101. </b> As the detailed analysis in Section 4.1 shows, the assumption that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had retained some WMD and the ability to use it and that he was now actively seeking </p>
<p>to enhance those capabilities, despite the disarmament obligations imposed by the UN </p>
<p>Security Council after the Gulf Conflict in 1991, was deeply embedded in UK thinking by </p>
<p>March 2002. </p>
<p><b>102. </b> That was reinforced by the JIC Current Intelligence Group (CIG) Assessment of the </p>
<p>status of Iraq’s WMD programmes issued on 15 March to aid policy discussions on Iraq.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>103. </b> In the context of a discussion about US concerns, relating to Al Qaida’s pursuit </p>
<p>of WMD, the need for action to deal with the threat posed by Iraq and the potential link </p>
<p>between terrorism and WMD, Mr Blair told Vice President Dick Cheney on 11 March that </p>
<p>it was “highly desirable to get rid of Saddam” and that the “UK would help” the US “as </p>
<p>long as there was a clever strategy”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Policy discussions with the US during March, including Mr Blair’s discussion with </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney and Sir David Manning’s visit to Washington, are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 3.2.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Hoon discussed Mr Webb’s advice of 27 February at a meeting on 19 March, </p>
<p>at which AM French “and others” were present.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>106. </b> In relation to the options for military action, Mr Hoon was advised that, if a UK </p>
<p>contribution to US military action against Iraq were to be sought, it:</p>
<p>“… might be a ‘division minus’, ie the largest of the options [for the deployment of </p>
<p>UK ground forces] foreseen in the SDR [1998 Strategic Defence Review].”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Hoon was also told that a “key issue would be the size of any continuing military </p>
<p>presence required to sustain a post&#8209;Saddam regime”. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Mr Hoon requested advice on the “likely resilience of Iraq’s resistance to a ground </p>
<p>operation”. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Hoon concluded that, if the US were to pursue a military option and seek </p>
<p>UK involvement, “it would clearly be undesirable” for the UK to find itself “facing a </p>
<p>plan about which we had reservations”. It would, therefore, be “advantageous to seek </p>
<p>representation in the UN planning process”. He would write to Mr Blair suggesting he </p>
<p>should raise that possibility in his discussions with President Bush. </p>

<p>UK should be able to deploy a division of up to three brigades in response to crises outside the NATO </p>

<p>brigades; 4 Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade (Ministry of Defence, <i>Statement on the Defence Estimates – </i></p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>110. </b> In the context of advice about Iraq’s ability to develop a nuclear weapon (see </p>
<p>Section 4.1), AM French commented in a minute to Mr Webb that, “Despite the work </p>
<p>going on in the Pentagon”, he could “not see a significant possibility of a large&#8209;scale </p>
<p>military attack on Iraq taking place this year”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>111. </b> In AM French’s view, the US would be “taking a calibrated approach”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The ‘axis of evil’ could be considered as the start of an IO [information </p>
<p>operations] campaign.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The US would respond to international opinion by giving UNMOVIC [UN </p>
<p>Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] another chance, but with </p>
<p>a much more intrusive regime.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IO campaign was “part of a move to foment opposition to Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>inside Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The US would consider the selective use of military force, air strikes, to aid </p>
<p>a coup, which must come from inside the country.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If all the above fail then consideration would have to be given to large&#8209;scale </p>
<p>military action.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Large&#8209;scale military action would come “into play quickly should Iraq be shown </p>
<p>to be complicit in terrorist attacks using WMD”.</p>
<p><b>112. </b> The minute was also sent to Adm Boyce.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> In response to Mr Hoon’s request at his meeting on 19 March, the DIS advised </p>
<p>that a ground offensive from Kuwait through Basra and coalition destruction of regime </p>
<p>security organs in southern Iraq, calls for a democratic Iraq, or the attempted imposition </p>
<p>of a government in exile, were all likely to increase resistance to a coalition attack.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> As </p>
<p>long as he was seen as defending Sunni hegemony in Iraq, that was Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>greatest strength.</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Mr Hoon sent a minute to Mr Blair on 22 March, which included Mr Hoon’s </p>
<p>assessment that Saddam Hussein was “only one unpleasant dimension” of the “key </p>
<p>strategic problem” of the spread of WMD, and that a more active counter&#8209;proliferation </p>
<p>strategy was needed for the region as a whole. That is addressed in Sections 3.2 </p>
<p>and 4.1.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>115. </b> In relation to possible military action, Mr Hoon identified three factors that the UK </p>
<p>should keep in mind in considering how to support President Bush:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US already has heavy land forces in the region … [and] is planning on the </p>
<p>basis that it would take 90 days to deploy all necessary forces to the region; </p>
<p>it would take us longer.</p>

<p>194</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite 10 years of searching, no one has found a credible successor to </p>
<p>Saddam.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If a coalition takes control of Baghdad (especially without catching Saddam), </p>
<p>it will probably have to stay there for many years.”</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the UK “should support President Bush and be ready for a </p>
<p>military contribution” in Iraq. The UK had “made some progress at getting inside the </p>
<p>Pentagon loop”, but he cautioned that the UK was:</p>
<p>“… not privy to detailed US planning, either strategically across the region or on </p>
<p>Iraq. Before any decision to commit British forces, we ought to know that the US </p>
<p>has a militarily plausible plan with a reasonable prospect of success compared to </p>
<p>the risks and within the framework of international law. Our involvement in planning </p>
<p>would improve their process – and help address our lead time problem. It would </p>
<p>enable either CDS to reassure you that there is a sound military plan or give you a </p>
<p>basis to hold back if the US cannot find a sensible scheme … I suggest one of your </p>
<p>objectives at Crawford should be to secure agreement to the UK’s participation in </p>
<p>US military planning …”</p>
<p><b>117. </b> Finally, Mr Hoon proposed that Mr Blair might raise with President Bush “the need </p>
<p>for a comprehensive public handling strategy, so that we can explain convincingly why </p>
<p>we need to take such drastic action against Iraq’s WMD now”. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr Hoon’s letter was copied to Mr Straw and to Sir Richard Wilson, the Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretary.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The point of asking for access … was if the Americans were going to start … down </p>
<p>a route of planning for military operations in Iraq, and if the Prime Minister was going </p>
<p>to indicate … that might be something … we would be involved in, then the earlier </p>
<p>we got involved … the earlier we would get an understanding of what might be </p>
<p>required of us.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that “there was no such thing at that stage as </p>
<p>military planning”. It was “quite clear” that some in the US were pushing for military </p>
<p>action to deal with WMD proliferation, “not just against Iraq, but against other countries </p>
<p>too”. The “background papers” produced for Mr Blair’s visit to Crawford were “policy </p>
<p>papers rather than military planning documents”. Those papers helped to inform </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s thinking but there were “no recommendations”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that, if there was a possibility of the US taking military </p>

<p>Office ‘Iraq: Options Paper’ and Mr Webb’s minute of 27 February.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> Dr Cholerton wrote:</p>
<p>“… we believe that the key issue for the PM to raise with President Bush is the </p>
<p>outcome the US would seek from any military action: would it simply be [to] control </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD, remove Saddam from office (in the knowledge that a successor regime </p>
<p>may well continue with Iraq’s WMD programmes) or is it necessary to install a </p>
<p>replacement regime? The answer to this question will be key to military planning; </p>
<p>how action would fit into the framework of international law and help hugely in </p>
<p>subsequent work to influence US policy.”</p>

<p>“We had started thinking of what our capability would be. I was not involved in the </p>
<p>briefing of the Prime Minister just before going to Crawford.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>132. </b> In his later statement, Lord Boyce said: </p>
<p>“There was a meeting with the Prime Minister on 2 April just prior to his visit to </p>
<p>Crawford to discuss, amongst other things such as Afghanistan, a wide range </p>
<p>of options about how to deal with Iraq, from containment and sanctions to </p>
<p>conceptual military action. There was no discussion on the detail of military action </p>
<p>or military options.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>133. </b> Adm Boyce told the Inquiry that his “presence at Chequers on that particular </p>
<p>occasion was simply if there were questions coming up about what could be done </p>
<p>militarily, what was our capability should we be asked to do something”; and that </p>

<p>out why it was hard to do anything …</p>
<p>“TB [Tony Blair] wanted to be in a position to give GWB [President Bush] a strategy </p>
<p>and influence it. He believed Bush was in the same position as him, that it would </p>
<p>be great to get rid of Saddam and could it be done without terrible unforeseen </p>
<p>circumstances? … </p>
<p>“We were given an account of the state of Iraqi forces, OK if not brilliant, the </p>
<p>opposition – hopeless – and Saddam’s ways – truly dreadful<i>.</i> CDS appeared to be </p>
<p>trying to shape the meeting towards inaction, constantly pointing out the problems, </p>
<p>the nature of the [US] Administration, only Rumsfeld and a few others knew what </p>
<p>was being planned, TB may speak to Bush or Condi [Rice] but did they really know </p>
<p>what was going on? … He said apart from Rumsfeld, there were only four or five </p>
<p>people who were really on the inside track.</p>
<p>“… but CDS would keep coming back to the problems … General Tony Pigott did </p>
<p>an OK presentation which went through the problems realistically but concluded </p>
<p>that a full&#8209;scale invasion would be possible, ending up with fighting in Baghdad. But </p>
<p>it would be bloody, could take a long time. Also, it was not impossible that Saddam </p>
<p>would keep all his forces back. He said post&#8209;conflict had to be part of conflict </p>
<p>preparation. The Americans believed we could replicate Afghanistan but it was very, </p>
<p>very different … Cedric [Delves] … said Tommy Franks was difficult to read because </p>
<p>he believed they were planning something for later in the year, maybe New Year. He </p>
<p>basically believed in air power plus Special Forces. CDS said if they want us to be </p>
<p>involved in providing force, we have to be involved in all the planning, which seemed </p>
<p>fair enough.</p>
<p>“TB said it was the usual conundrum – do I support totally in public and help deliver </p>
<p>our strategy, or do I put distance between us and lose influence?</p>
<p>“We discussed whether the central aim was WMD or regime change. Pigott’s view </p>
<p>was that it was WMD. TB felt it was regime change in part because of WMD but </p>
<p>more broadly because of the threat to the region and the world … [P]eople will say </p>
<p>that we have known about WMD for a long time … [T]his would not be a popular </p>
<p>war, and in the States fighting an unpopular war and losing is not an option.</p>

<p>was “important that No.10 and others understood the practical steps and (additional) </p>
<p>costs which would be involved”. Therefore as a “precaution against the possibility that </p>
<p>military action might have to be taken at some point in the future”, exploratory work </p>
<p>should be put in hand, conducted “on a very close hold”, to provide:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… a clearer picture of the potential specific military options – including the </p>
<p>possible UK involvement”; this should indicate the “likely scales of effort and </p>
<p>force generation/deployment timelines”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Clarification of what military capability we could deliver on the basis of the … </p>
<p>budgets for 2002/03 and what more might be required to deliver the options” </p>
<p>identified.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Identification of the additional specific equipment requirements (UORs) </p>
<p>necessary to deliver these options … Equipment – rather than personnel – was </p>
<p>likely to be on the critical path in terms of deployment timelines.”</p>

<p><b>173. </b> On 12 April, following consultation with Sir Kevin Tebbit and Adm Boyce, Mr Webb </p>
<p>sent Mr Hoon a think piece entitled “Bush and the War on Terrorism”.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Mr Webb’s view was that “the prospects for finding a stable political solution” </p>
<p>were “poor in the short term”; and that a coalition might be left “holding the ring for a </p>
<p>significant period”. Securing a mandate for a UN interim administration “could be tricky” </p>
<p>so there would be a “need to cater for some kind of sponsored interim administration”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Mr Webb added that “without proper access to US planning”, the options were </p>
<p>“speculative” but:</p>
<p>“Potential US scenarios could embrace:</p>
<p>A. </p>
<p>A clandestine/Special Forces operation on a limited scale …</p>
<p>B. </p>
<p>A local revolution, possibly supported by SF and a major air campaign </p>
<p>(on a Northern Alliance analogy, though the circumstances are very </p>
<p>different).</p>
<p>C. </p>
<p>A major military operation to secure centres of power such as Baghdad …” </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Webb advised that the US had “sufficient forces to undertake a military </p>
<p>operation … without anyone else’s help”; but:</p>
<p>“To achieve a successful regime change, the UK would need to be actively involved </p>
<p>(one might also argue that the Prime Minister has effectively committed us).” </p>
<p><b>179. </b> If the US mounted a major military operation, a UK contribution of only Special </p>
<p>Forces, cruise missiles and/or air support “would be seen as only token … confer no </p>
<p>significant influence on US planning (and would be adversely contrasted with Britain’s </p>
<p>contribution during the [1990/91] Gulf War).”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Setting out the MOD’s thinking on military issues, Mr Webb wrote: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The fundamental building block for [a UK contribution to] a major US ground </p>
<p>force operation is a division. Only on that scale (requiring 3 brigades as our </p>
<p>planning base) would UK have significant influence over how the operation </p>
<p>was developed and conducted: an independent brigade does not fit into the US </p>
<p>structure and would in any case need substantial divisional scale enablers in </p>
<p>order to be safe for high intensity operations … Such a deployment would be at </p>
<p>the extreme end of the UK’s capacity after the SDR: it was the scenario against </p>
<p>which the ‘large’ option was scaled.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “should seek only to make a respectable large contribution that we can </p>
<p>sustain properly”.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>92 </p>
<p>In a handwritten amendment to the draft letter Lt Gen Pigott suggested amending the sentence “Without </p>
<p>access to US planning, which is only now beginning …” to “Without formal access to US planning …” He </p>
<p>also recommended inserting “a 3 brigade division” in the description of the potential UK force contribution </p>
<p>of a division. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Webb added:</p>
<p>“… there could be advantage in the MOD doing some discreet internal strategic </p>
<p>estimating. This should help us think through what would be the key strategic </p>
<p>objectives and the end states and the ‘centre of gravity’ of the situation we need to </p>
<p>tackle … When the time came for discussion with the US, our pre&#8209;thinking and ability </p>
<p>to offer a well thought&#8209;through force contribution (up to a division, though obviously </p>
<p>less if possible) would give us clout: and also a respectable position from which to </p>
<p>judge whether their proposals offer adequate return for risk.” </p>
<p><b>182. </b> On the way forward, Mr Webb wrote:</p>
<p>“Despite the massive scale of commitment, there are arguments that preventing the </p>
<p>spread of WMD should be given the highest priority in coming years … [I]t remains </p>
<p>the greatest risk to Middle East and international stability in the medium&#8209;term; </p>
<p>and in the long&#8209;term countries like Iraq and Iran are on course to threaten Europe </p>
<p>and UK direct. It is arguable that preventing this spread by making an example </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein would do more for long&#8209;term stability than all the displaced </p>
<p>[military] activities combined …</p>
<p>“By demonstrating our capacity for high intensity warfare at large scale the UK would </p>
<p>also send a powerful deterrence message to other potential WMD proliferators and </p>
<p>adversaries.</p>
<p>“… There would come a point at which preparations could apply some valuable </p>
<p>pressure on Saddam; or be seen as a natural reaction to prevarication over </p>
<p>inspections. In general … until that point … we should keep a low profile …”</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Webb concluded:</p>
<p>“Even these preparatory steps would properly need a Cabinet Committee decision, </p>
<p>based on a minute from the Defence Secretary. The FCO are content for activity </p>
<p>to be centred on MOD, to preserve the best prospect for dialogue with US DOD </p>
<p>[Department of Defense] …”</p>
<p><b>184. </b> At a meeting on 18 April to discuss Mr Webb’s minute, Mr Hoon found the analysis </p>
<p>“generally persuasive”; but asked for further work to examine the feasibility of making </p>
<p>a smaller contribution.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> He sought options “short of participation in a full ground </p>
<p>offensive”. </p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr Hoon said that more thought needed to be given to the legal aspects as:</p>
<p>“Prima facie, the best legal foundation for any operation to displace Saddam’s </p>
<p>regime was that it would remove the threat posed by his WMD. However it was </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>conceivable that any new Iraqi regime – and, in particular, one led by another ‘strong </p>
<p>man’ – would wish to have WMD to meet the perceived regional threat from Iran …” </p>
<p><b>186. </b> Mr Hoon stated that he was content for thinking to continue, but decided it </p>
<p>should be kept on “a very close hold until Ministers agreed otherwise”. For him, “the </p>
<p>key question was: how far ahead of a decision to deploy would we have to start any </p>
<p>necessary preparatory action”.</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Webb explained to the Inquiry that the way he had posed the issues in his </p>
<p>minute was a means of finding out from Mr Hoon if he knew or could find out what the </p>
<p>position was:</p>
<p>“This was commissioned as a think piece. But … my duty is to say to my Secretary </p>
<p>of State, you need, we need to have a feel for whether the Prime Minister has </p>
<p>committed us here, because it affects what we do next.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Webb added that he had not got an explicit response on that point.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Hoon did not formally write to Mr Blair setting out possible options for a UK </p>
<p>contribution to military operations until 31 May. </p>
<p><b>190. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that after Crawford the MOD “started ramping up our … </p>
<p>thinking on … what we could provide”.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that it should not assume that the MOD was </p>
<p>looking for the military option at that point. Rather, if the military was to be in a position </p>
<p>to produce a military option “at a much later date”, a “very long planning process [was] </p>
<p>required” and it had to start thinking about the issues “as early as possible”. The work </p>
<p>was “very, very preliminary ground clearing”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>192. </b> Sir Kevin subsequently told the Inquiry that, to produce a large scale option on </p>
<p>the ground, serious planning had to start six months earlier.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> The military papers </p>
<p>and records would “indicate clarity of intent, when in fact what there was, was a </p>
<p>determination to provide the politicians with the option”.</p>
<p>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE “PIGOTT GROUP”</p>
<p><b>193.  The MOD established an informal inter&#8209;departmental group of senior </b></p>
<p><b>officials, the “Pigott Group”, to identify the issues which might need to be </b></p>
<p><b>addressed if military action was taken in Iraq.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Lt Gen Pigott told Mr Hoon on 18 April that a small, senior group had been put </p>
<p>together “including … representatives from other interested Departments” to “brainstorm </p>
<p>the options”.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, described the role of the group, which </p>
<p>became known as the “Pigott Group”, to Mr Straw on 25 April as to think about the </p>
<p>issues that would be involved in any military operation in Iraq.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> Its establishment was:</p>
<p>“… a sensitive exercise. Participation is being tightly restricted and paperwork will </p>
<p>be kept to the minimum.” </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw that the first meeting of the Group had discussed </p>
<p>how the objective or “end state” of a military operation should be defined. That is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 3.3. </p>
<p><b>198. </b> The minute stated that senior officials from the Cabinet Office and the Agencies, </p>
<p>as well as the FCO, would be involved.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts told the Inquiry that the role of the Pigott Group was to discuss </p>
<p>“the implications of military planning for other departments’ activities” rather than to </p>
<p>“discuss military planning as such”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>200. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that the Group “was constrained, to a very small group </p>
<p>of people … in London in the MOD, it didn’t actually go outside into any of the outposts </p>
<p>… in the MOD”.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>201. </b> Lt Gen Pigott told the Inquiry that the role of the Group was:</p>
<p>“… to do some scoping work … Not to do … planning … What could we be dealing </p>
<p>with here? What might be the big issues? … the what, when, where. What were they </p>
<p>beginning to look like …”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>202. </b> Mr Tom McKane, Deputy Head of OD Sec from September 1999 until early </p>
<p>September 2002, told the Inquiry that the Group “met a number of times in the early </p>
<p>summer” of 2002.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> The meetings were “not minuted” and were “very informal … the </p>
<p>focus was on precisely what was the US emerging plan”. At that stage there was “great </p>
<p>uncertainty about that”, and British access to American thinking had been “pretty limited”.</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Mr Webb told the Inquiry that the Group had worked out the shape of the options </p>
<p>which he had then discussed with Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense </p>
<p>for Policy.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>207</p>
<p><b>204. </b> The Strategic Planning Group (SPG), a planning team working for Lt Gen Pigott, </p>
<p>supported the Pigott Group.</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Lieutenant General Sir James Dutton, Adm Boyce’s liaison officer to the Chairman </p>
<p>of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff until the middle of March 2002 and subsequently head </p>
<p>of the SPG until taking up his appointment as Commander, 3 Commando Brigade in </p>
<p>July 2002, told the Inquiry that, in view of his recent experience in Washington as CDS’s </p>
<p>liaison officer, he had been asked to lead the team, reporting weekly to Lt Gen Pigott.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>206. </b> Lt Gen Dutton said that the work was best described as “prudent military </p>
<p>contingency planning on what we might be able to do if there were a political directive </p>
<p>to do so”. Force packages were not yet being discussed: </p>
<p>“If there were to be a political decision made to do something in Iraq, what might </p>
<p>the Americans do, what might we be able to do … if that decision were made and </p>
<p>… how would the various bits of Whitehall contribute to that and what might be the </p>
<p>longer&#8209;term aim. So it was very much conceptual thinking …” </p>
<p>MOD ADVICE TO MR HOON, MAY 2002</p>
<p><b>207.  The MOD advised Mr Hoon in early May that the US had decided to pursue </b></p>
<p><b>regime change. The question was when. The MOD thought it could be at “the turn </b></p>
<p><b>of the year”.</b></p>
<p><b>208.  The US was likely to continue to hold the UK military at arm’s length until </b></p>
<p><b>options had been considered by President Bush.</b></p>
<p><b>209.  Lt Gen Pigott identified two key issues which would need to be addressed: </b></p>
<p><b>the impact of the potential courses of action and the contribution the UK </b></p>
<p><b>might make. </b></p>
<p><b>210. </b> Gen Franks visited the UK as part of a wider overseas visit in late April 2002. </p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Hoon’s diary indicates that he met Gen Franks at RAF Brize Norton on </p>
<p>25 April.</p>
<p>106</p>

<p><b>213. </b> The discussion on Iraq at the Chiefs of Staff meeting attended by Gen Franks and </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>214. </b> The minute of the discussion records that the Chiefs of Staff were told that the </p>
<p>US was thinking deeply about Iraq and possible contingencies; but was not currently </p>
<p>planning a military operation to overthrow the Iraqi regime. There were a significant </p>
<p>number of questions about the use of force including timing and the need for proof </p>
<p>of WMD and a legal underpinning. </p>
<p><b>215. </b> Recent difficulties with the No&#8209;Fly Zones were also discussed. </p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head of OD Sec (Foreign Policy), who attended </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff meeting, advised Sir David Manning that:</p>
<p>“… the mood [in the US government] was ‘when not if’, but the list of unintended </p>
<p>consequences was long and policy makers were still grappling with them … Activity </p>
<p>in Washington mirrored that in London. Small groups of senior staff thinking through </p>
<p>strategy options.”</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>217. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Brian Burridge told the Inquiry that Gen Franks had visited </p>
<p>London in “mid&#8209;May”; and that he had said something about Iraq along the lines of “it is </p>
<p>not if but when, and that was really the first time I had heard him say anything with that </p>
<p>degree of certainty”.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>218. </b> From the records of the 26 April Chiefs of Staff meeting, the Inquiry concludes </p>
<p>ACM Burridge was recalling that discussion. There is no evidence that Gen Franks was </p>
<p>in London in mid&#8209;May. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> Lt Gen Pigott told the Inquiry: “I had an extremely close relationship with the </p>
<p>key players in the joint staff. It was very much professional friends over the years”. </p>
<p>If approached, they would say: “Yes … we are doing a bit more on this”, but that was </p>
<p>“not the American Government”, it was “an individual senior officer in the American </p>
<p>Government”.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>220. </b> Major General David Wilson, who replaced Lt Gen Delves as Senior British </p>
<p>Military Adviser (SBMA) at CENTCOM in April 2002, told the Inquiry that he received </p>
<p>no information about Iraq planning when he arrived: </p>
<p>“Nothing. I didn’t find anything, because the shutters were firmly down. I and my </p>
<p>people were in the foreign exclusion category … there was no sort of nodding and </p>
<p>winking, that’s the way it was.”</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Lt Gen Dutton told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we were all interested to know whether there was any planning going on for </p>
<p>other potential operations. I used to ask that question of the J&#8209;3, General Newbold </p>
<p>… and he would be quite honest in saying that they were doing staff checks for any </p>
<p>number of contingencies and, if asked specifically about Iraq, he would not deny that </p>
<p>they were looking at what they could do, if asked …”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Lt Gen Pigott sent Mr Hoon an update on the work of the SPG on 10 May.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>223. </b> Lt Gen Pigott stated:</p>
<p>“Any thinking we do about joining the US in military operations against the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime needs to be informed by our thinking in two key areas: the impact of potential </p>
<p>courses of action open to a coalition and the capability the UK might contribute to </p>
<p>such a coalition.” </p>
<p><b>224. </b> The SPG had concluded that the US had decided to pursue regime change; the </p>
<p>question was when, including whether to pursue weapons inspections before a military </p>
<p>build&#8209;up. The MOD’s “best guess” was that the recommendation would be for action at </p>
<p>“the turn of the year” but it did not expect to be “exposed” to US planning until advice </p>
<p>had been put to President Bush, probably in late May. The UK would “need to be ready </p>
<p>to discuss Iraq with the Americans as soon as they share planning with us”. </p>
<p><b>225. </b> Work had been commissioned on the capabilities the UK might aim to provide </p>
<p>within periods of three to four and six to eight months; setting out the key decision and </p>
<p>deployment points. </p>
<p><b>226. </b> Lt Gen Pigott suggested that this could lead to “a note to the Prime Minister </p>
<p>setting out these and the financial implications of taking contingency action now”. The </p>
<p>advantage of characterising this work as “contingency planning and considering generic </p>
<p>force packages” was that it offered “the possibility of wider debate and scrutiny in the </p>
<p>department than would be available if we were to consider specific courses of action, for </p>
<p>operational security reasons”. The work needed to be supported by “thinking on what </p>
<p>‘end state’ HMG is seeking to achieve and about the legal basis on which action would </p>
<p>be taken forward”.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Hoon noted Lt Gen Pigott’s advice and asked for a meeting to discuss the work </p>
<p>and when it would be appropriate to convene a meeting with Mr Blair and Mr Straw.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>228. </b> In a letter the same day as Lt Gen Pigott’s update on wider issues, which is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 3.3, Mr Webb told Mr Ricketts: </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>“… we have proposed to the Defence Secretary we take forward rapidly two distinct </p>
<p>pieces of work, one on military <i>contingency planning</i> … and the other on <i>coalition </i></p>
<p><i>options</i> which will need to factor in legal considerations. Rather than submitting our </p>
<p>Ministers’ conclusions to the Attorney General for his approval, we should prefer the </p>
<p>usual approach of his putting advice to colleagues as part of a collective decision.”</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>229. </b> The letter was sent to Lt Gen Pigott, Sir David Manning and SIS.</p>
<p><b>230.  By mid&#8209;May, the perception that the UK might provide an armoured division </b></p>
<p><b>for military operations had already gained currency in the US.</b></p>
<p><b>231.  There is no evidence that such a suggestion had been authorised.</b></p>
<p><b>232.  In the absence of an agreed avenue for dialogue between the US and UK </b></p>
<p><b>and the sensitivities about the issue on both sides of the Atlantic in the spring of </b></p>
<p><b>2002, informal conversations between the US and UK military and between civilian </b></p>
<p><b>officials to explore each other’s positions to inform thinking and the development </b></p>
<p><b>of advice to Ministers were unavoidable. </b></p>
<p><b>233. </b> Mr Webb visited Washington in mid&#8209;May and discussed draft objectives for a </p>
<p>military operation with US officials (see Section 3.3).</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Webb explained the UK military timelines as:</p>
<p>“… 7 to 9 months for a major contribution of division minus plus air wing etc, shorter </p>
<p>for a smaller package. If they [the US] wanted UK participation this would have to be </p>
<p>factored in.” </p>
<p><b>235. </b> Mr Webb also reported his impression that momentum in Washington “had flagged” </p>
<p>since his last substantive discussions in February. </p>
<p><b>236. </b> In the context of those discussions, Mr Webb told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… once you get into the level of military planning, it doesn’t make a big difference </p>
<p>whether your policy is to remove WMD, and that means Saddam has to go, or </p>
<p>whether you are going to change the regime and take the opportunity to remove </p>
<p>WMD … [I]t’s very important in legal and policy terms …”</p>
<p>118</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>238. </b> In relation to military planning, Sir Christopher reported that he had been told by </p>
<p>a senior official in the State Department that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The timeframe discussed between Mr Blair and President Bush was still valid: </p>
<p>the first quarter of next year was “realistic” for action against Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CENTCOM was hearing from British military sources that we were </p>
<p>contemplating contributing an armoured division.</p>
<p><b>239. </b> In discussions with Dr Rice on Iraq, Sir David Manning was assured that the UK </p>
<p>would be brought into the planning process at a very early stage, once such planning </p>
<p>got under way.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>240. </b> One significant and potentially awkward fact emerged from a meeting with </p>
<p>Mr Richard Armitage, US Deputy Secretary of State, when Sir David Manning was </p>
<p>told that a report that “a UK officer at Tampa had said that the UK would provide </p>
<p>an armoured division” was “dropped into the conversation” of the most senior US </p>
<p>policy&#8209;makers.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>241. </b> On the record of the meeting in the Chief of the Defence Staff files, a handwritten </p>
<p>comment to Adm Boyce said: “This could unstitch your line with the PM tomorrow.”</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office sent a note to Adm Boyce’s office on 21 May, recording </p>
<p>that the Defence Secretary was “surprised and concerned” by this report: </p>
<p>“Given the very close hold under which contingency planning for Iraq has been </p>
<p>conducted and the fact that no options have yet been presented to Ministers, the </p>
<p>Secretary of State would be grateful for any light which can be thrown upon this </p>
<p>story. Is the UK team in Tampa party to the current work on Iraq?”</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Adm Boyce’s office replied that “the UK team in Tampa is not party to current </p>
<p>MOD work on Iraq” and:</p>
<p>“… our investigations indicate that there has been no authenticated or officially </p>
<p>recorded message passed to General Franks, or anyone else at Tampa, that the </p>
<p>UK ‘would’ provide a division. We can only assume that this is speculation based </p>
<p>on UK’s contribution to the Gulf War 1991 which has been misinterpreted.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote on his own copy of the document “Rubbish!”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Asked about his meeting with Mr Armitage and the fact that Mr Armitage had been </p>
<p>told that Mr Blair had discussed with President Bush at Crawford the question of a </p>
<p>British armoured division taking part in the invasion, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Yes I didn’t know that.”</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Asked, in the context of an offer of a division, whether the military planners were </p>
<p>getting ahead of the policy, Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that he was “surprised </p>
<p>they had said that”. It “didn’t seem logical”; Mr Blair had refused in July to indicate what </p>
<p>the military contribution might be.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry: “Let me absolutely assure you that no&#8209;one was </p>
<p>authorised to make such an offer. In fact, quite the contrary.”</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> He added: “we were </p>
<p>unable to find out who this person was. So I don’t believe there was such a person.” </p>
<p><b>249.  Two key strands of MOD thinking had clearly emerged by the end of </b></p>
<p><b>May 2002. </b></p>
<p><b>250.  First, work on options in the MOD focused on identifying the maximum </b></p>
<p><b>contribution the UK could make to any US&#8209;led operation in Iraq, even though the </b></p>
<p><b>UK was still unsure about the objectives and validity of the plan, the legal basis </b></p>
<p><b>for action or the precise role the UK would play. </b></p>
<p><b>251.  Second, the desire to secure “strategic influence” across all environments </b></p>
<p><b>of a military campaign. </b></p>
<p><b>252. </b> The record of Mr Blair’s meeting with the Chiefs of Staff on 21 May, when a range </p>
<p>of wider defence issues was discussed, noted on Iraq: “The two main questions were: </p>
<p>Do the US have a sensible concept? If so how could the UK contribute?”</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>253. </b> A paper produced by the SPG on 24 May, ‘Contingency Thinking: Force </p>
<p>Generation and Deployment for the Gulf’, was sent to the Chiefs of Staff and a limited </p>
<p>number of named MOD addressees.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>254. </b> The aim of the paper was to provide sufficient information:</p>
<p>“… to judge what the UK’s maximum level of commitment could be in the event of a </p>
<p>contingent operation against Iraq, together with appropriate costs and timings, and </p>
<p>to provide data on other smaller coherent force packages as a comparator.”</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>255. </b> The paper identified a number of key assumptions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any operation would be US led and might involve other active coalition partners, </p>
<p>but would be “predominantly enabled by US/UK forces”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would provide only coherent, self&#8209;supporting force packages … and </p>
<p>would operate within the framework of a coalition concept of operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would scale its contribution so that the force would “make a meaningful </p>
<p>difference to a coalition effort” and would not be a “token contribution that </p>
<p>attracts no influence or provides insignificant combat power. A small scale of </p>
<p>effort would therefore only be appropriate if the coalition concept of operations </p>
<p>demanded small scale contributions.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Operations would not commence before autumn 2002.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Decisions would not be taken incrementally because that would “add to timelines </p>
<p>by making force generation increasingly complex and costly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Enhancements would be needed to enable units to operate in the Gulf. That </p>
<p>would expose preparations from an early stage given the significant number </p>
<p>of contracts that would be required with industry.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It might be necessary to maintain force elements in theatre for policing, </p>
<p>stabilisation or humanitarian operations. That had the potential to add </p>
<p>considerably to the costs and commitments burden, depending on the end </p>
<p>state of the campaign. </p>
<p><b>256. </b> Three broad levels of effort in line with the MOD’s DPAs were examined:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the maximum the UK could provide (a large scale contribution);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “credible” medium scale package; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a small scale package.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Reflecting the UK’s existing military commitments and the most recent MOD </p>
<p>budgetary planning round, the SPG advised that the UK could realistically produce a </p>
<p>“maximum contribution … at the lower end of large scale … medium scale (minus) for </p>
<p>maritime (about 10 major warships), and medium scale for air (about 60 fast jets)”. </p>
<p><b>258. </b> The force mix might not be evenly balanced (in terms of scale of effort) across </p>
<p>the sea, land and air environments; but the UK would “always seek to achieve strategic </p>
<p>influence across the three environments such that UK influence is in place throughout </p>
<p>the joint environment”. </p>
<p><b>259. </b> Also on 24 May, the emerging findings from the SPG analysis were presented </p>
<p>to Mr Hoon to report to Mr Blair before a planned meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld in </p>
<p>early June.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Lt Gen Pigott advised that, “until there is greater visibility and clarity of US intent </p>
<p>our work on potential approaches to an Iraq campaign remains speculative; this work </p>
<p>is advancing but will lack definition until we engage with the US”. There were “potential </p>
<p>differences in US and UK views on the outcomes” being sought “in terms of governance </p>
<p>and WMD”.</p>
<p><b>261. </b> In relation to “military contingency planning”, the “key assumption” was that the </p>
<p>largest US&#8209;led coalition would be “along the lines of Desert Storm and that the UK would </p>
<p>want to contribute”. </p>
<p><b>262. </b> Three broad options (“force packages”) had been identified, which were “illustrative </p>
<p>of the maximum potential … contribution” that the UK might be able to make available </p>
<p>for any offensive operations within given time periods:</p>
<p>a.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Three months’ warning</b>: Deployment of a medium scale joint force – </p>
<p>10 warships including a carrier, an armoured brigade, about 60 fast jets and </p>
<p>associated support. That was described as at risk of being a “token contribution”. </p>
<p>The cost, including “essential” UORs for equipping the force, was estimated at </p>
<p>£500m&#8209;£800m. A brigade, rather than a division, would require integration into </p>
<p>an allied formation, which would “substantially” reduce the UK’s influence on </p>
<p>control of the campaign. That would be “less than our Gulf War contribution” and </p>
<p>“would be dwarfed by the likely scale of the overall effort”.</p>
<p>b.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Six months’ warning</b>: Deployment of a large scale, war&#8209;fighting force in </p>
<p>addition to the medium scale maritime and air components, which would be </p>
<p>“comparable to the 1990/1991 conflict”, and “confer significant influence on the </p>
<p>control of the campaign”. Though the land element would be “capable of limited </p>
<p>independent war&#8209;fighting” there would be sustainability issues. Large numbers </p>
<p>of vehicles could become “unserviceable” and there would be reliance on others </p>
<p>to supply ammunition and other stock. There would not be enough time for </p>
<p>“the procurement and fitting of <i>all</i> UOR equipment considered to be essential </p>
<p>for operations in the Gulf (such as the desertisation of all armoured vehicles)”, </p>
<p>which would generate further operational risks and result in the degradation of </p>
<p>the “credibility of the UK’s contribution as [the] campaign unfolded”. That option </p>
<p>would require the call&#8209;out of 5,000&#8209;10,000 reservists and cost £800m&#8209;£1.1bn. </p>
<p>A decision would need to be taken immediately for operations to begin in </p>
<p>December 2002.</p>
<p>c.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Nine months’ warning</b>: The force package would be the same as (b) but would </p>
<p>be better prepared and carry fewer risks, as a result of additional training and </p>
<p>equipment. The package would have “enough capability and sustainability to </p>
<p>be a credible contribution to any coalition”. The cost would be £100m higher </p>
<p>because of a greater volume of UORs. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Deployment and campaign costs would be additional to the costs identified for </p>
<p>each option.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Lt Gen Pigott explained that current commitments in Afghanistan and subsequent </p>
<p>recovery and deployment times would “limit the UK’s ability to contribute significantly to </p>
<p>any offensive operations in the region until November at the earliest”. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> If it was “likely that the UK would wish to contribute” to US action “when the call </p>
<p>came”, there was a “need to consider what action” was needed “now to reduce risks and </p>
<p>as far as possible readiness times”. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Hoon was asked to agree further work to refine contingency planning, to be </p>
<p>submitted in mid&#8209;June; and was informed that “proper preparations” would require wider </p>
<p>involvement in the MOD and discreet approaches to industry.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> In a meeting with Sir Kevin Tebbit, ACM Bagnall, Mr Webb, Mr Bowen, and others, </p>
<p>on 27 May, Mr Hoon agreed that the best approach would be to explain the practical </p>
<p>constraints the UK faced in assembling a useful force package to Secretary Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>268. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that he had thought the land option “quite a big ask, given </p>
<p>our extensive involvement in Afghanistan at the time”; “it was undoubtedly the case” that </p>
<p>the UK would be “taken more seriously if we were making a substantial contribution”, </p>
<p>and that that influence would extend to shaping the policy.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld, 5 June 2002</b></p>
<p><b>269.  In preparation for a visit to the UK by Secretary Rumsfeld on 5 June, Mr Hoon </b></p>
<p><b>wrote to Mr Blair on 31 May.</b></p>
<p><b>270.  Mr Hoon advised that he and Mr Straw had agreed a preliminary objective </b></p>
<p><b>to guide planning. Instead of calling directly for the elimination of Iraq’s WMD </b></p>
<p><b>capability, it called on Iraq to abide by its international obligations on WMD. </b></p>
<p><b>The objective did not explicitly mention regime change. </b></p>
<p><b>271.  UK contingency planning had concluded that, for the UK to have influence </b></p>
<p><b>on US planning, a significant military contribution would be needed. That was </b></p>
<p><b>defined as at “division level” for land forces.</b> </p>
<p><b>272.  To take planning further, greater clarity on US thinking was needed.</b></p>
<p><b>273.  Mr Hoon also identified that exposing the constraints on the UK’s ability to </b></p>
<p><b>contribute forces before the end of 2002 could reduce its influence. </b></p>
<p><b>274. </b> On 31 May, in advance of a visit by Secretary Rumsfeld, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair, </p>
<p>stating that there had been “no take up” of the offer “to help the US in its planning”, and </p>

<p>216</p>
<p><b>275. </b> The minute was also sent to Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Sir Richard Wilson. </p>
<p><b>276. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that he and Mr Straw had agreed a “preliminary objective” to “guide </p>
<p>the work”: </p>
<p>“A stable and law&#8209;abiding Iraq within its present borders, co&#8209;operating with the </p>
<p>international community, no longer posing a threat to its neighbours or international </p>
<p>security, abiding by its international obligations on WMD.” </p>
<p><b>277. </b> The MOD had looked at what it might be able to contribute “were the US to </p>
<p>assemble a coalition along the lines of that assembled for Operation Desert Storm”, </p>
<p>the US&#8209;led operation (to liberate Kuwait) in 1990&#8209;1991. The “key message” from that </p>
<p>work was:</p>
<p>“… if we wish to be able to contribute meaningfully to any operation our Armed </p>
<p>Forces would need plenty of warning time, much more than we think the US would </p>
<p>need themselves. We are clear that, for the UK to have influence on detailed </p>
<p>planning, the US would require a significant contribution to any large&#8209;scale </p>
<p>operation. Our own analysis indicates that this would have to be at division level for </p>
<p>land forces. (It is possible that the objective could be achieved by a more rapid blow, </p>
<p>but we cannot count on that.)” </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Mr Hoon also stated that “to plan properly” the UK needed to know: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“what outcome” the US was seeking;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“when the US might wish to take action”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how long the US saw itself remaining in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Hoon added that the UK needed “to clarify the policy basis and legal justification </p>
<p>for any action”. </p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Hoon identified that the visit by Secretary Rumsfeld would provide the </p>
<p>opportunity to clarify US thinking but the UK faced a dilemma:</p>
<p>“On the one hand, if we discuss the detail and timescales of a potential UK military </p>
<p>contribution to a US&#8209;led coalition, it could send a misleading signal that we have </p>
<p>decided to support a specific line of military action. (Such a signal could be used </p>
<p>in Washington by the supporters of military action to promote their cause.) Equally </p>
<p>if we are not clear with the US at this stage about our military constraints, we face </p>
<p>the danger of our not being able to bring anything meaningful to the table at the </p>
<p>right time and the consequent loss of influence that would bring. Finally, it could be </p>
<p>precisely our readiness to participate that would allow you to counsel the President </p>
<p>against proceeding if no convincing plan were to emerge.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Hoon recommended that rather than “simply” generally probing Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld on Washington thinking:</p>
<p>“… there would be more mileage in raising practicalities. I would make clear that our </p>
<p>conditions for involvement in military action remain as you have set them out …”</p>
<p><b>282. </b> Mr Hoon added:</p>
<p>“Further, by raising in general terms, that our contingency planning has shown </p>
<p>we need plenty of warning in order to be able to contribute to military action I </p>
<p>would reinforce the need for the UK to be exposed fully to US thinking as soon </p>
<p>as possible.”</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Mr Blair wrote alongside the last point: “No, that will send a wobbly message.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Hoon met Secretary Rumsfeld on 5 June.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>285. </b> Mr Blair’s statement that the UK would be with the US in any military action, </p>
<p>and that would best be done by ensuring a broad coalition and avoiding unintended </p>

<p>Section 3.3. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld indicated that the US would begin discussions with the UK </p>
<p>“at the military level” so that the UK was “informed of – and ‘to the extent appropriate’ </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>291.  One key assumption was that, although the objective for Iraq agreed by </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Straw and Mr Hoon did not mention regime change, that would be necessary </b></p>
<p><b>to secure the objective.</b></p>
<p><b>292.  Other key elements of the thinking included the need to build international </b></p>
<p><b>support for the UK effort, and judgements about Saddam Hussein’s likely actions </b></p>
<p><b>which were reflected in later JIC Assessments. </b></p>
<p><b>293. </b> In preparation for a “Strategic Think Tank on Iraq”, to be held by the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 18 June, the SPG produced a paper on 13 June which, in the absence of access to </p>
<p>US planning, identified key judgements encapsulating the thinking at the time in relation </p>
<p>to components of a possible concept for military operations.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>294. </b> The “<b>Military/Strategic Implications</b>” and “<b>Key Judgements</b>” identified by the </p>
<p>SPG included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regime change was “a necessary step” to achieving the end state identified </p>
<p>by the UK, and there was “no point in pursuing any strategy which does not </p>
<p>achieve this”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once it is obvious that the US is committed to regime change, she will have </p>
<p>to prevail”, so the UK needed to “plan for the worst case” and “be prepared to </p>
<p>execute [that plan] if required”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “need to acknowledge” that there would be a post&#8209;conflict phase </p>
<p>“with an associated commitment, manpower and finance bill”, with “a spectrum </p>
<p>of commitment where the worst case is a long period with a large bill”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “much more detailed level of intelligence” was required.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Although Iraq’s nuclear capability (essentially a ‘dirty’ bomb)” could not be </p>
<p>“dismissed”, the “main threat” was from chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If regime survival was at stake, Saddam Hussein would “almost certainly use </p>
<p>WMD, so there would be no deterrent equation as in 1991”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Reviewing the internal politics in Iraq and the options for regime change. Iraq </p>
<p>was “potentially fundamentally unstable”, and “currently held together by the </p>
<p>strong security apparatus”, which would require “considerable force to break”. </p>
<p>Once it was broken, the regime would “shatter” because of its minority appeal.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>A judgement that:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>The possibilities for a replacement regime were “very difficult to assess” </p>
<p>and the UK “must be clear on what we do not want”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>It would be “difficult to apply force with sufficient precision to ensure a </p>
<p>pre&#8209;determined outcome”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Removing the threat posed by Iraq’s WMD was “essential”. That would mean </p>
<p>changing the “regime to one that renounces WMD”, or completely destroying </p>
<p>Iraq’s capability and “remove [the] will to regenerate the capability, which implies </p>
<p>regime change”. That would need “much better granularity of intelligence”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Managing the regional dimension would require the “footprint and duration” of </p>
<p>the military operation to be minimised, “commensurate with assets to manage </p>
<p>unintended consequences”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Identifying three phases leading to regime change:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p><b>Phase 1</b>: While Saddam Hussein was unsure of the Coalition’s intentions, </p>
<p>he would avoid providing a “casus belli”. He was “unlikely to take any </p>
<p>significant military action” but it was “possible” that he would take other </p>
<p>actions, including accelerating WMD development and weaponisation and </p>
<p>admitting inspectors then obstructing or expelling them. </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p><b>Phase 2</b>: If Saddam Hussein was convinced the Coalition was determined </p>
<p>to overthrow his regime, his response would be “unpredictable, ranging </p>
<p>from benign/conciliatory … to military aggression”, including pre&#8209;emptive </p>
<p>attacks and the possible use of WMD, and mining “SPODs [Sea </p>
<p>Points of Disembarkation] or approaches”. That phase would provide </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s “best chance … to fracture the will of the Coalition” </p>
<p>and “speed and agility” would be “needed once the decision to act has </p>
<p>been taken”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p><b>Phase 3</b>: In a conflict phase, Saddam Hussein would go “into full regime </p>
<p>(and personal) survival mode, with no holds barred”. The most difficult </p>
<p>action for the Coalition to deal with would be if Saddam withdrew to and </p>
<p>defended urban areas. The Coalition plan would need to minimise that </p>
<p>possibility which supported the idea of a “surprise attack”. The most </p>
<p>dangerous response for the Coalition would be a WMD attack on Israel.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Identifying the key “strategic and military principles” which would affect the </p>
<p>design of the campaign:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>an aim that was “clear and both publicly explainable and defensible”;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a choice of options given Saddam’s unpredictability; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>surprise and an aim to “<b>maximise strategic uncertainty</b> in Saddam’s </p>
<p>mind”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Creating political, military and regional conditions which would “keep Saddam </p>
<p>off balance” whilst preparatory activities were under way.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to identify and prepare possible force packages.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>296. </b> The paper also set out three illustrative options for a military campaign, with a very </p>
<p>high&#8209;level assessment of their advantages and disadvantages:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“Air and SF [Special Forces] Precision Strike”</b>:<b> </b>with the aim of generating </p>
<p>“a ‘knock out’ blow of key installations and facilities” that would “shatter the </p>
<p>regime and cause its downfall”. The option had “gained high level enthusiastic </p>
<p>backing in Washington” although that might “now be waning”. It was “unlikely </p>
<p>to be chosen as a discrete option” but elements would form parts of the other </p>
<p>two options.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“Strategic ‘Coup de Main’”</b>: once “Saddam’s regime had been ‘squeezed’ </p>
<p>by all the means at the Coalition’s disposal” – political, diplomatic, legal and </p>
<p>economic – air assault forces would be used to seize “key regime power centres </p>
<p>(mainly in Baghdad)” and “NBC weapons, sites and command and control </p>
<p>nodes”. The option was “Politically attractive” but militarily “high risk” and would </p>
<p>need strategic surprise.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“Conventional ‘Heavy Punch’”</b>: “essentially the re&#8209;run” of the 1991 Gulf </p>
<p>Conflict, which provided the “safer military option”.</p>

<p>Desmond Bowen would represent the UK”.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>301. </b> Mr McKane stated that he had been struck by two points:</p>
<p>“There is a huge amount of work to be done if the UK is to be in a position to </p>

<p>“We may need to confront the legal base for military action sooner rather than later. </p>

<p>are able to agree that regime change is a legitimate and legal objective.” </p>
<p><b>302. </b> Mr McKane recommended that Sir David should reply to Mr Hoon’s letter of </p>
<p>31 May seeking “further and better particulars on the time&#8209;lines and precisely what </p>

<p>an objective in its own right.” </p>
<p><b>314. </b> Mr Watkins indicated that a small MOD team would be going to Washington and </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>319. </b> Before they left, Major General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations </p>
<p>(Operations) (DCJO(Ops)), provided a paper commenting on US planning, which at that </p>
<p>stage offered two basic approaches:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “running start”, with extra forces being deployed as the initial attacks were </p>
<p>under way, which would have the advantage of surprise and allow for operations </p>
<p>as early as October 2002; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “generated start” allowing full deployment before the beginning of operations, </p>
<p>which was expected to require three months longer.</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Maj Gen Fry wrote that the “running start” option carried considerably more risk </p>
<p>and would be “much more manoeuvrist” than the type of operations which had been </p>
<p>conducted in 1991. A number of issues for the UK were identified, including: the role and </p>
<p>timing for a UK contribution; the need for very early decision&#8209;making; how to integrate </p>
<p>into a complex US plan; levels of risk; UK participation in US exercises; and the likely </p>
<p>US expectations that would result from UK involvement in the planning process.</p>
<p><b>321. </b> On 1 July, Mr Watkins advised Mr Hoon on Mr Bowen’s visit to Washington.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Bowen had reported that the Americans had a plan, including taking Baghdad, which </p>
<p>they were confident would deliver regime change, but there was no clear direction on </p>
<p>timing. That would be affected by the decision on whether to choose a “running start”. </p>
<p>The plan would be heavily dependent on basing and overflight rights in the region and </p>
<p>beyond. The view in Tampa was that it was very early in the planning process and too </p>
<p>soon to talk about the UK’s contribution. </p>
<p><b>322. </b> Mr Bowen’s view was that the US military were looking to the UK for a second </p>
<p>opinion on their military planning, contributions in kind and influence with Washington </p>
<p>on the overall campaign plan. The US military would want “the usual niche capabilities </p>
<p>(Nimrod, etc). Whether we provide any more is up to you [Mr Hoon].”</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Similar conclusions were reported by Maj Gen Wilson to Lt Gen Reith on </p>
<p>30 June.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> He wrote that UK influence and counsel was “almost as important, if </p>
<p>not more so than what we would actually bring to the campaign militarily”; although </p>
<p>he also cautioned that “UK ability to significantly influence operational design, if so </p>
<p>minded, is limited”. </p>
<p><b>324. </b> Maj Gen Wilson told the Inquiry: “… what I remember was said … I think by </p>
<p>General Abizaid, who was then the Director of Joint Staff in the Pentagon … ‘We need </p>
<p>your advice. We need your counsel …’”</p>

<p>write formally to him to reiterate the point. </p>
<p><b>328. </b> Adm Boyce and Gen Myers discussed a northern option. There were differences </p>
<p>of view within the US military about a possible attack from the North although the </p>
<p>importance of control of the northern oilfields was recognised. Adm Boyce took the view </p>
<p>that Gen Myers “showed his petticoat” in so far as he indicated that that was where the </p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 4 JULY 2002: ‘IRAQ: REGIME COHESION’</p>
<p><b>334.  A JIC Assessment on 4 July addressed regime cohesion in Iraq and how </b></p>
<p><b>it would respond under pressure or attack. </b></p>
<p><b>335.  Although it had only fragmentary intelligence about how the regime would </b></p>
<p><b>deal with an attack including ground forces, the JIC assessed on 4 July that only </b></p>
<p><b>massive military force would be guaranteed to topple Saddam Hussein </b></p>
<p><b>336.  The JIC judged that disintegration of the regime would be most likely if Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>ground forces were being comprehensively defeated; if top military officers could </b></p>
<p><b>be persuaded that their fate was not irrevocably tied to that of Saddam Hussein; </b></p>
<p><b>or if Saddam were to be killed.</b></p>
<p><b>337. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment of “how cohesion of the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime is maintained and how the regime would fare under pressure or attack” on </p>
<p>4 July.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>338. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion of the draft paper described it as:</p>
<p>“… an important paper with a specific focus. It would be of interest to Ministers more </p>
<p>because of its context, with decisions yet to be taken about what to do with Iraq, </p>
<p>than because of its analysis, which was familiar rather than novel. </p>
<p>“Its key message was that although Saddam Hussein’s regime was remarkably </p>
<p>resilient to pressure … the demonstration of a real and overwhelming international </p>
<p>determination and ability to remove the regime through military force was the likeliest </p>
<p>way to bring it down … </p>
<p>“Experience in Afghanistan had shown that generating expectations and influencing </p>
<p>people’s perceptions of what might happen had considerable capacity to effect real </p>
<p>and rapid change … </p>
<p>“The paper needed to analyse and describe in more detail the nature of Saddam’s </p>
<p>support … The motives for each set of supporters were different … These mattered </p>
<p>because under pressure the different groups would behave differently. </p>
<p>“UK policy makers, and military planners, would be keen before too long to identify </p>
<p>the point at which self&#8209;interested loyalty for Saddam might turn into disillusionment, </p>
<p>fragility and fragmentation.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>339. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Only massive military force would be guaranteed to topple Saddam. The regime </p>
<p>expects a US attack […].</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The clear prospect of a major attack would put the regime under unprecedented </p>
<p>pressure. But regime cohesion is unlikely to collapse in the absence of a large </p>
<p>scale invasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam relies on a mixture of patronage and extreme fear to retain power and </p>
<p>contain opposition. Real loyalty and support for his regime is confined to the top </p>
<p>of the hierarchy.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Special Republican Guard (SRG) and the Republican Guard Forces </p>
<p>Command (RGFC) are more reliable than the Regular Army (RA). All would </p>
<p>initially fight a US&#8209;led attack. Once the regime was perceived as doomed the </p>
<p>military’s will to fight on would be sorely tested.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regime disintegration would be most likely if Iraqi ground forces were being </p>
<p>comprehensively defeated; if top military officers could be persuaded that their </p>
<p>fate was not irrevocably tied to that of Saddam; or if Saddam himself were to </p>
<p>be killed. Military units are more likely to suffer mass desertions than revolt as </p>
<p>coherent units.”</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>340. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>“Saddam and his regime have proved durable …</p>
<p>“The Iraqi military are aware of their vulnerability to air power, probably their greatest </p>

<p><b>344. </b> An updated plan would be briefed to President Bush in August, and the US </p>
<p>planning was designed “to put CENTCOM in a position to be able to activate their plan </p>
<p>from August 2002 onwards”. A “de facto invitation to the UK and Australia to participate” </p>
<p>was “now on the table”. The plan would require availability of bases and support from </p>

<p><b>345. </b> Mr Watkins reported that Mr Hoon intended to respond positively to the </p>
<p>invitation for a small number of British planners to join US planning teams; that was </p>
<p>“essential in helping to inform the MOD’s own thinking” so that Mr Hoon could make </p>
<p>recommendations. But Mr Hoon was: </p>
<p>“… very conscious that decisions about a military contribution cannot be made in </p>
<p>the absence of a coherent and integrated strategic framework. An agreed strategy </p>
<p>will be key to taking matters forward, not simply to provide justification for military </p>
<p>action, but to clarify timelines; to incorporate the Prime Minister’s conditions for </p>
<p>UK participation; and to establish the framework for an information campaign. The </p>
<p>draft public document, which you are currently considering, would ultimately form </p>
<p>an important part of that campaign. He suggests that the Prime Minister may like </p>
<p>to call an early meeting of a small group of colleagues to consider how best to get </p>
<p>the US to address the strategic, as opposed to the narrowly military, dimension. </p>
<p>The freestanding military option is not a viable political proposition.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, officials from the MOD, FCO and Cabinet Office should do some more </p>
<p>homework urgently to put the Prime Minister and you in a better position to influence </p>
<p>the President’s and Condi Rice’s thinking … before the updated CENTCOM plan </p>

<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>352. </b> Sir Kevin concluded that the UK could not count on a military campaign being </p>
<p>unlikely or, if the US went ahead, that the UK could avoid being linked to the campaign.</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Sir Kevin advised that a “credible political plan”, which addressed the conditions for </p>
<p>UK participation and moved American planning into acceptable channels and slowed it </p>
<p>down, was needed. That is set out in more detail in Section 3.3.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit’s minute was sent after Mr Watkins’ letter to Sir David Manning </p>
<p>had been sent. Mr Watkins marked the letter to Mr Hoon observing that the MOD did </p>

<p>165</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that getting involved in US planning in late June </p>
<p>and early July had posed a dilemma because:</p>
<p>“… it was clear … even at that stage, if one begins discussions with the United </p>
<p>States on the military track, albeit without commitment, it becomes increasingly </p>
<p>difficult to keep options open absolutely completely … [W]e made it clear to them </p>
<p>that our participation … was purely to inform British Government thinking …</p>
<p>“On the one hand, if one is drawn into discussion of timescales and details, we </p>
<p>might give misleading signals of support for military action that was not present </p>
<p>at that stage.</p>
<p>“On the other hand, if we continued to stand aside, it might be too late for us to </p>
<p>influence events or meet the political requirement which might be placed on us.”</p>

<p><b>360.  Political guidance was needed on how to implement the UK’s intent and </b></p>
<p><b>convey that intent to the US.</b></p>
<p><b>361.  The SPG had pointed out that, once military forces were deployed, the US </b></p>
<p><b>would have to see its policy through to a successful conclusion.</b></p>

<p>230</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was not “well&#8209;balanced” to match US ability to escalate action rapidly </p>
<p>and, if UK forces were to be deployed alongside the US, there was a “need to </p>
<p>match US planning aspirations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>WMD, the composition and methods of the current Iraqi regime, and where the </p>
<p>fracture lines existed in the current regime, were identified as the areas where </p>
<p>a “much more detailed level of intelligence” was required.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “must accept” that it was “likely that our visibility of WMD may even </p>
<p>deteriorate as Saddam prepares for conflict”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any replacement regime would need to renounce WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A much more detailed analysis of the need for international support and the </p>
<p>risks associated with the position of individual countries was required. Turkey </p>
<p>would be a “critical” ally and would “call for a delicate political balance” which </p>
<p>would “require … military support”. Ensuring Turkey’s support would require </p>
<p>identification of “credible political carrots”, enhanced military aid and “effective </p>
<p>military links to Kurdish guerrilla groups”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq provided a “balance” to Iran and needed “either … to retain significant </p>
<p>military capability or international guarantees”. The paper also asked whether </p>
<p>Iran would be the “next candidate of axis of evil?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s “best chance” would be “to prevent the deployment of </p>
<p>coalition forces as once committed by presence, the US can only see the </p>
<p>operation through to success …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Information operations would play a key part in Phases 2 and 3 of the campaign.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Taking military action during “Window 1” would require management of </p>
<p>consequences after military action, “<b>Strike then Shape</b>”. “Window 2” would be </p>
<p>“more deliberate”, and was characterised as “<b>Shape then Strike</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a definition of possible UK contributions as Packages 1, 2 and 3 and </p>
<p>the initial, high&#8209;level identification of key shortfalls in readiness. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was the identification of a fourth, “<b>Siege</b>” option for a military campaign, </p>
<p>which would entail “seizing one or more pieces of territory (probably in the North </p>
<p>and South) and, in effect, laying siege to the regime”. That had “received some </p>
<p>support in the Press and from academics”. It could achieve the end state “with </p>
<p>little fighting, but the political risks” were “high”.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> PJHQ submitted an assessment of the CENTCOM plan on 12 July, which identified </p>
<p>the possible scope and scale of a UK contribution as: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enablers, including Special Forces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support of the US “Main Effort” through Kuwait with armoured forces up to a </p>
<p>division (minus) and/or light forces at brigade strength; and </p>

<p>231</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a discrete contribution in geographical or functional terms – a second axis in the </p>
<p>north, which needed more work to establish if it was feasible.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>368. </b> The paper outlined the two possible windows for military action: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Window One between October 2002 and March 2003; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Window Two between October 2003 and March 2004. </p>
<p><b>369. </b> The second was the preferred UK option, but PJHQ acknowledged that it was </p>
<p>“undoubtedly less attractive to the US”. </p>
<p><b>370. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were asked for guidance on the direction and nature of </p>
<p>future planning. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> Maj Gen Wilson advised Lt Gen Reith on 16 July that the UK was expected to </p>
<p>present a statement of intent at a US CENTCOM planning conference in Tampa, Florida </p>
<p>on 1 to 2 August.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>372. </b> Maj Gen Wilson reported that it was expected that the UK capability “offered” </p>
<p>would “deliver the northern option”, together with Special Forces, air (especially tankers), </p>
<p>ships, command and control architecture and enablers. He concluded that there </p>
<p>were “more questions than answers, with too many issues of substance either not yet </p>
<p>addressed or ‘assumed away’”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On WMD use, the view remained that Saddam Hussein’s “ability to deliver </p>
<p>‘capability’ is unproven and widespread use thought unlikely”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although there was “reasonable information upon which to target”, it remained </p>
<p>“a critical information shortcoming”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not clear whether detailed work had been done to assess Iraqi “red lines”. </p>
<p>There was uncertainty over what Israel would do by way of retaliation if attacked. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Baghdad Stronghold” scenario was acknowledged but considered a </p>
<p>“possibility rather than an eventuality”. </p>
<p><b>373. </b> In relation to the recent announcement of a Turkish election on 3 November, </p>
<p>Maj Gen Wilson reported that had “unsettled” the US, and US military planners had been </p>
<p>asked to “assess the feasibility of plans in a ‘no Turkey scenario’”. He added:</p>
<p>“Whether it [the ‘no Turkey scenario’] becomes a show&#8209;stopper remains to be seen.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>375. </b> A briefing note prepared by Lt Gen Pigott for Adm Boyce focused on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the question of whether there was a winning concept;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the comparative advantages and disadvantages of operations between October </p>
<p>2002 and March 2003 or one year later;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possible UK contribution; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the way ahead.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>376. </b> Lt Gen Pigott advised that the UK assessments of the plan were based on “scant </p>
<p>information”, and that the key areas of concerns on the US plan included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a mismatch in the end states of the US and UK; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of a strategic framework; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>potentially optimistic assumptions about assessments of Iraqi weaknesses;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insufficient knowledge of the WMD threat in many important respects; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a question about “to what extent” kinetic means could deliver strategic ends. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Lt Gen Pigott’s view was that the UK should encourage thinking to move towards </p>
<p>action in 2003&#8209;2004 rather than in 2002&#8209;2003, which “had a better chance of success” </p>
<p>given the challenges “including political red cards”. That was: “Not a recipe for delay, </p>
<p>indeed quite the reverse.” It would be difficult for the UK to send land forces to </p>
<p>participate in a “running start” but the UK thinking was “taking us towards a ‘distinctive’ </p>
<p>(Package 3) role”. For any significant contribution, force preparation would need to </p>
<p>start “now”. </p>
<p><b>378. </b> The advice from Lt Gen Pigott and the SPG was discussed in a restricted Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff meeting on 17 July.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>379. </b> At the meeting, Adm Boyce emphasised the privileged nature of the UK access to </p>
<p>US planning and the need for operational security. The points made in the discussion </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>One key judgement which would affect planning would be whether an initial push </p>
<p>would trigger regime collapse.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although the use of UK bases was critical to the US plan there was, from the UK </p>
<p>viewpoint, no viable context within which it could participate in military action: </p>
<p>“The legal basis was particularly fraught with difficulty.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A running start “was not currently viable for the UK without significant risk”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A UK contribution in the North that did not require integration into US land </p>
<p>forces would “fix” Iraqi divisions in northern Iraq, “open up a second front, and </p>
<p>safeguard the critical northern oilfields”. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It might take “up to nine months” to produce a division (minus), “although this </p>
<p>was understood to be the ‘sensible worst case’”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Timings were critical and the UK could not wait to see if Window 2 was the </p>
<p>preferred US option. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a key judgement to be made about whether the UK should wait for </p>
<p>an approach from the US, “or be more forward leaning and factor a UK ‘offer in </p>
<p>principle’ into US planning at an early stage”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s chemical and biological (CB) warfare capability and intent was a </p>
<p>significant issue, “even a limited CB employment could cripple the battle plan”. </p>
<p><b>380. </b> Adm Boyce concluded that “the UK needed greater visibility of US intent in a </p>
<p>number of areas”. For the immediate future, “political guidance on how best to start </p>
<p>implementing UK intent and to convey that intent to the US” was needed.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> In preparation for a meeting to be held on 18 July, Mr Bowen outlined the MOD </p>
<p>thinking in a minute to Mr Hoon on 17 July.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Mr Bowen drew attention to the US concepts of “running” and “generated” starts. </p>
<p>He advised that the indications were that the US favoured the “running start” option </p>
<p>(which could see US operations beginning during the course of 2002). That would </p>
<p>achieve “strategic surprise”, but it went against “our expectation of [a] Desert Storm&#8209;style </p>
<p>build up over months”.</p>
<p><b>383. </b> Mr Bowen suggested:</p>
<p>“In the meantime, as we begin to explore possible UK contributions we need </p>
<p>to identify what preparation – such as procurement for <b>urgent operational </b></p>
<p><b>requirements</b> – could usefully begin now …”</p>
<p><b>384. </b> A minute from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Mr Hoon stated that the Chiefs of Staff, </p>
<p>notably General Sir Mike Walker, Chief of the General Staff, had been very sceptical </p>
<p>about the US plan, which was seen as “optimistic in a number of areas”, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the speed of advance over large distances; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confidence that the regime would implode without direct action against the </p>
<p>seat of power or Iraqi leaders; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reliance on the isolation rather than the capture of Baghdad; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>little consideration of the practicality of the plan in a chemical/biological </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>its neighbours or to international security, and abiding by its international </p>
<p>obligations on WMD”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To “engage the US on the need to set military plans within a realistic political </p>
<p>strategy”, which included “identifying the succession to Saddam Hussein and </p>
<p>creating the conditions necessary to justify government military action, which </p>
<p>might include an ultimatum for the return of UN weapons inspectors to Iraq. </p>
<p>This should include a call from the Prime Minister to President Bush ahead </p>
<p>of the briefing of US military plans to the President on 4 August. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The establishment of a Cabinet Office&#8209;led ad hoc group of officials to consider </p>
<p>the development of an information campaign to be agreed with the US.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> The paper stated that US military planning for action against Iraq was “proceeding </p>
<p>apace” but it lacked a political framework: “In particular, little thought has been given to </p>
<p>creating the political conditions for military action, or the aftermath and how to shape it.” </p>
<p><b>395. </b> It seemed “unlikely” that the UK’s objective could be achieved while </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime remained in power. The US objective was “unambiguously” </p>
<p>the “removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime, followed by elimination of Iraqi WMD”. The </p>
<p>view of UK officials was that it was by “no means certain” that one would follow from the </p>
<p>other: even if regime change was “a necessary condition for controlling Iraq’s WMD”, it </p>
<p>was “certainly not a sufficient one”.</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The paper stated that “certain preparations would need to be made and other </p>
<p>considerations taken into account”. It contained a series of sections addressing the </p>
<p>conditions which would be “necessary for military action and UK participation, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a viable military plan”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a positive risk/benefit assessment”. </p>
<p><b>397.  In relation to military planning, the paper stated:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Chiefs of Staff were not yet able to assess whether the military plans </b></p>
<p><b>were “sound”; although a “decision in principle” might be needed “soon”. </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Ministers were invited to “note” the potentially long lead times for </b></p>
<p><b>equipping UK forces to undertake operations in Iraq, and asked to </b></p>
<p><b>agree that the MOD could bring forward proposals for procurement </b></p>
<p><b>of equipment.</b></p>
<p><b>398. </b> The Chiefs of Staff had advised that there were a number of questions which </p>
<p>would need to be answered before US military plans could be assessed as “sound”. </p>
<p>Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the realism of a “Running Start”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the willingness of Iraqi forces to fight; and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the potential impact of Iraqi attacks using chemical or biological weapons.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Without an overt military build&#8209;up, a “Running Start” military action could begin as </p>
<p>early as November, with air strikes and support for opposition groups and small&#8209;scale </p>
<p>land operations, while further ground forces built up to overwhelm Iraqi forces “leading to </p>
<p>the collapse of the Iraqi regime”. A “Generated Start” following a military build&#8209;up could </p>
<p>begin as early as January 2003. That was also judged to be the latest date for the start </p>
<p>of military operations unless action was “deferred until the following autumn”. </p>
<p><b>400. </b> The “UK’s ability to contribute forces depended on the details of US military </p>
<p>planning and the time available to prepare and deploy them”. The MOD was “examining </p>
<p>how the UK might contribute to US&#8209;led action”. Options ranging from deployment of a </p>
<p>division to making bases available had been identified. US plans assumed the use of </p>
<p>British bases in Cyprus and Diego Garcia. Unless “publicly visible” decisions were taken </p>
<p>“very soon”, the UK would not be able to send a division in time for an operation in Iraq </p>
<p>in January 2003. </p>
<p><b>401. </b> A “decision in principle” might be “needed soon on whether and in what form the </p>
<p>UK takes part in military action”.</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Ministers were invited to “note the potentially long lead times involved in equipping </p>
<p>UK Armed Forces to undertake operations in the Iraqi theatre”; and to “agree that MOD </p>
<p>should bring forward proposals for the procurement of Urgent Operational Requirements </p>
<p>under cover of the lessons learned from Afghanistan” and the “outcome” of the 2002 </p>
<p>Spending Review. </p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr McKane advised Sir David Manning separately that the paper covered US </p>
<p>military plans “only in headline form” on the grounds that Mr Blair would “wish to receive </p>
<p>a short oral brief from CDS”.</p>

<p>MOD ADVICE FOR MR HOON </p>
<p><b>408.  Following his minute of 3 July and a visit to Washington on 18 to 19 July, </b></p>
<p><b>Sir Kevin Tebbit advised that the US Administration as a whole was increasingly </b></p>

<p><b>regime change and remove WMD risks.</b></p>
<p><b>409. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit visited Washington from 18 to 19 July.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>410. </b> Sir Kevin advised Mr Hoon that the US Administration as a whole was increasingly </p>
<p>united in the view that military action would be taken against Iraq to bring about regime </p>
<p>change and remove WMD risks. He reported an “air of unreality” given the enormity of </p>
<p>what was envisaged and the absence of a policy framework and detailed planning. </p>

<p><b>413.  In the light of uncertainty about the timing of possible military operations, </b></p>
<p><b>Adm Boyce had directed that planning for deployment of land forces should </b></p>
<p><b>concentrate on two packages: a “supporting/enabling package” and a northern </b></p>
<p><b>option, comprising a division with two combat brigades (a division&#8209;minus). </b></p>
<p><b>414.  MOD officials privately expressed strong reservations about military action </b></p>
<p><b>to Mr Hoon stating that there was no objective justification for a pre&#8209;emptive </b></p>
<p><b>attack either now or in the immediate future.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>416. </b> In preparation for the meeting on 23 July, Mr Bowen advised Mr Hoon that the </p>
<p>meeting would discuss the Cabinet Office paper of 19 July, and the agenda was </p>
<p>expected to cover:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US planning and timescales;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>objectives of any military action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the strategic policy framework;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the potential UK contribution; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an information campaign.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Mr Bowen advised that it was “still too early to be definitive” about whether the US </p>
<p>had a winning military concept; but that it was “likely” that the answer to that question </p>
<p>would be “‘yes’ with certain conditions”. The key point for Mr Blair to note was that US </p>
<p>action could take place “very quickly, as early as November”.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Agreeing the objective for military action would be “useful”, but it begged the </p>
<p>question of the “<i>strategic policy framework</i> in which to take military action in pursuit of </p>
<p>that objective”. “In particular a framework” was “required to set the conditions for military </p>
<p>action including the necessary justification in international law”. That was “important </p>
<p>because it may well constrain our ability to support US action”. </p>
<p><b>419. </b> Adm Boyce had directed that UK planning should concentrate on two “packages”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a supporting/enabling package, including basing, maritime and air assets, in </p>
<p>which the “the only land contribution would be Special Forces”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a discrete land contribution of a “division (minus)” for operations in northern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> Those two packages had been chosen “because they effectively represent </p>
<p>maximum practical UK contributions to US&#8209;led operations for either early or later action”. </p>
<p>Schematic timelines showing decision dates and readiness which could be achieved </p>
<p>were provided. </p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Bowen advised that the “indications from the US” were that it did “not expect a </p>
<p>ground force contribution from the UK for operations out of Kuwait”; and that “providing </p>
<p>land forces to integrate with the US main effort in the South” had “been discounted </p>
<p>because of the severe difficulties we would face due to interoperability; deployment time </p>
<p>and geographic constraints affecting logistics in particular”. </p>
<p><b>422. </b> Work was “now being tailored” to a UK contribution from the north, although it was </p>
<p>“difficult to see how meaningful operations could be achieved outside the framework of </p>
<p>a multi&#8209;national force such as the ARRC [Allied Rapid Reaction Corps] with the support </p>
<p>of other allies”.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>423. </b> A speaking note stated that the key points for the meeting with Mr Blair were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US military planning was “gathering pace”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “mood and timetable” pointed to “this winter for action, although an </p>
<p>alternative would be in 2003/4”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “need for early guidance on UK military involvement and </p>
<p>preparatory work”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Engagement between Mr Blair and President Bush was “needed now to </p>
<p>assess US willingness to establish [a] strategic framework, followed by UK </p>
<p>decision&#8209;making before summer break”.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> The “Line to Take” offered to Mr Hoon included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “too early to judge” if the US military plan was a winning concept and the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff were “not yet convinced”. The question of whether the US had a </p>
<p>winning concept could be answered as planning developed. The UK view was </p>
<p>that pressure should be “applied from South, West and North”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US would like to establish the scale of UK involvement. Subject to the legal </p>
<p>framework, the US expected Diego Garcia, Cyprus, air enablers, maritime force </p>
<p>and Special Forces as a minimum. There was a “Developing expectation” of a </p>
<p>division size force in the North with Turkey and other allies.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Decisions were “needed urgently” if UK forces were to be involved “this winter”. </p>
<p>A large land force contribution needed “preparatory action immediately” and </p>
<p>would not be complete until “March/April”. </p>
<p><b>425. </b> Commenting on Mr Bowen’s advice, Mr Watkins wrote that: “Large scale </p>
<p>involvement in a US thrust from Kuwait would be impracticable”; and that a division </p>
<p>(minus) option “would require immediate action on UORs etc and early decisions </p>
<p>(October) on reserves”. The latter would “definitely be visible”.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>426. </b> In relation to a discrete “Land Contribution”, Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p>“Apart from being ‘involved’, the military utility (and risks) of this option are not clear.” </p>
<p><b>427. </b> Mr Watkins added to the speaking note a suggestion that Mr Hoon should seek an </p>
<p>understanding that the costs of UORs would be met from the Reserve.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Watkins also offered Mr Hoon a “Private Office distillation of where we think </p>
<p>most of your key advisers – Chiefs, PUS etc (with possible exception of Simon Webb) – </p>
<p>are coming from”. That set out strong reservations about military action, including </p>
<p>that there was no objective justification for a pre&#8209;emptive attack either now or in the </p>
<p>immediate future.</p>

<p>187</p>
<p> The former were “fine” for maritime </p>
<p>and air components, but the latter were “better” for land and Special Forces, “largely </p>

<p><b>432. </b> Lt Gen Pigott also wrote that strategic thinking on a “Northern Axis” was “still </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>and “up to” a division (minus) to US planners, “with provisos on deployment/</p>
<p>employment clearly spelt out”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Agree to explore” the “Northern Option” with the US “as a matter of urgency”. </p>
<p>The UK should also:</p>

<p>“Be prepared to consider Framework Nation lead of a Land Component </p>

<p><b>438. </b> The discussion in the meeting and the actions that followed are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 3.3.</p>
<p><b>439. </b> In relation to military planning, the record of the meeting produced by Mr Matthew </p>
<p>Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett summarised the intelligence and latest (4 July) JIC Assessment: </p>
<p>“Saddam’s regime was tough and based on extreme fear. The only way to </p>
<p>overthrow it was likely to be by massive military action.” Saddam was “worried </p>
<p>and expected an attack”, but he was “not convinced” that an attack would be </p>
<p>“immediate or overwhelming”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove reported that there was “a perceptible shift in attitude” </p>
<p>in Washington: “Military action was now seen as inevitable.” President Bush </p>
<p>“wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction </p>
<p>of terrorism and WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce reported that Secretary Rumsfeld and President Bush would be </p>
<p>briefed by CENTCOM planners in early August. The US was examining two </p>
<p>military options, and saw the “UK (and Kuwait) as essential”. The three main </p>
<p>options for UK involvement were:</p>
<p>“(i) </p>
<p>Basing in Diego Garcia and Cyprus plus […] SF [Special Forces] </p>
<p>squadrons.</p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p>As above, with maritime and air assets in addition.</p>
<p>(iii)  As above, plus a land contribution of up to 40,000 perhaps with a discrete </p>
<p>role in northern Iraq entering from Turkey, tying down two Iraqi divisions.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon said that the US had already begun “spikes of activity” to put pressure </p>
<p>on the regime. In his view, January was the most likely timing for military action. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated that it “seemed clear” that President Bush had “made up his </p>
<p>mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith warned that the desire for regime change was not a legal basis </p>
<p>for military action. Self&#8209;defence and humanitarian intervention could not be the </p>
<p>basis for military action in this case. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had stated: “The two key issues were whether the military plan worked </p>
<p>and whether we had the political strategy to give the military plan the space </p>
<p>to work.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce did not yet know if the US battleplan was “workable”. There were </p>
<p>“lots of questions”, for example “the consequences if Saddam Hussein used </p>
<p>WMD on day one, or if Baghdad did not collapse and urban warfighting began”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw “thought the US would not go ahead with a military plan unless </p>
<p>convinced it was the winning strategy”, but there “could be US/UK differences” </p>
<p>on the political strategy. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett assessed that “Saddam would allow the inspectors back in only </p>
<p>when he thought the threat of military action was real”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon stated that if Mr Blair wanted UK military involvement, an early decision </p>
<p>would be required. Mr Hoon cautioned that “many in the US did not think it was </p>
<p>worth going down the ultimatum route”. It would be important for Mr Blair “to set </p>
<p>out the political context” to President Bush. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> In relation to the military option, Mr Rycroft recorded that the meeting concluded:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military </p>
<p>action. But we needed a fuller picture of US planning before we could take any </p>
<p>firm decisions. CDS should tell the US military that we were considering a range </p>
<p>of options.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Prime Minister would revert on the question of whether funds could be spent </p>
<p>in preparation for this operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CDS would send the Prime Minister full details of the proposed military </p>
<p>campaign and possible UK contributions by the end of the week.”</p>
<p><b>441. </b> Mr Rycroft sent a separate letter to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary on 23 July, </p>
<p>which very briefly summarised the action points for the FCO, the MOD and the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>442. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair recorded that Adm Boyce had made it pretty clear at the </p>

<p><b>444. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that he did not have a specific recollection of the meeting </p>
<p>but he did not recall it as a key meeting, rather it was part of an “iterative process”.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Mr Hoon subsequently wrote that there was “a very full discussion of the relevant </p>
<p>issues” at the meeting, and that:</p>

<p><b>446.  In his Note to President Bush of 28 July on the strategy on Iraq, Mr Blair </b></p>
<p><b>suggested a build&#8209;up of military forces in the Gulf in the autumn as a signal of </b></p>
<p><b>intent to encourage international support and demoralise Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>447. </b> Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush on 28 July and his and Sir David Manning’s </p>
<p>subsequent discussions with President Bush are addressed in Section 3.3. </p>
<p><b>448. </b> Mr Blair’s Note of 28 July began:</p>
<p>“I will be with you, whatever. But this is the moment to assess bluntly the difficulties. </p>
<p>The planning on this and the strategy are the toughest yet. This is not Kosovo. This </p>
<p>is not Afghanistan. It is not even the Gulf War. </p>
<p>“The military part of this is hazardous but I will concentrate mainly on the political </p>
<p>context for success.”</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>449. </b> In a section setting out the elements of a strategy to secure a political coalition, </p>
<p>if not necessarily a military one, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“It goes without saying that the Turks and Kurds need to be OK. Strangely I think </p>
<p>they are going to be the easiest, despite the Turkish elections. They both want our </p>
<p>help badly and will play ball if offered enough.”</p>
<p><b>450. </b> In a section headed “<b>The Military Plan</b>”, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Finally, obviously, we must have a workable military plan. I don’t know the details </p>
<p>yet, so this is first blush.</p>
<p>“The two options are running start and generated start.</p>
<p>“The first has the advantage of surprise; the second of overwhelming force. My </p>
<p>military tell me the risks of heavy losses on the running start make it very risky. </p>
<p>Apparently it involves around 15&#8209;20,000 troops striking inside Iraq, with heavy air </p>
<p>support. The idea would be to catch the regime off balance, strike hard and quickly </p>
<p>and get it to collapse. The obvious danger is [that] it doesn’t collapse. And there is </p>
<p>the risk of CW being used.</p>
<p>“For that reason, a generated start seems better. It could always be translated into </p>
<p>a more immediate option, should Saddam do something stupid. Also, the build&#8209;up of </p>
<p>forces in such numbers will be a big signal of serious intent to the region and help to </p>
<p>pull people towards us and demoralise the Iraqis. This option allows us to hammer </p>

<p><b>451. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“We would support in any way we can.</p>
<p>“On timing, we could start building up after the break. A strike date could be Jan/Feb </p>

<p><b>MOD advice, 26 July 2002</b></p>
<p><b>452.  In response to Mr Blair’s request for full details of the proposed military </b></p>
<p><b>campaign and possible UK contributions, the MOD advised No.10 on 26 July:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>US military planning was still evolving and the Chiefs of Staff were not yet </b></p>
<p><b>able to judge whether the US had a winning concept.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Three possible options were identified but no recommendation was made </b></p>
<p><b>about which option should be selected. </b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The largest option comprised the deployment of a division, but the MOD </b></p>
<p><b>was also examining the possibility of deploying an additional light brigade </b></p>
<p><b>and providing the framework for a UK&#8209;led Corps headquarters.</b></p>
<p><b>453.  Mr Hoon expressed caution about both the robustness of the estimates </b></p>
<p><b>of the timescales for a UK deployment and the impact of Operation FRESCO – </b></p>
<p><b>potential industrial action by the Fire Brigades Union in the autumn.</b></p>
<p><b>454.  Mr Hoon’s view was that the UK should present its options to the US </b></p>
<p><b>positively, but without commitment at that stage.</b></p>
<p><b>455.  Mr Blair was advised that no decision was needed at that stage. </b></p>
<p><b>456.  The three options identified by the MOD, which made no explicit reference </b></p>
<p><b>to possible post&#8209;conflict commitments, provided the broad framework for </b></p>
<p><b>discussions until the end of 2002. </b></p>
<p><b>457. </b> Following Mr Blair’s meeting on 23 July, Mr Watkins commissioned further work, </p>
<p>including a paper on all aspects of the military options for Mr Hoon to send to Mr Blair </p>
<p>in time for his weekend box: a paper on military preparations, including the impact of </p>
<p>the firefighters’ strike; and a draft script for Maj Gen Wilson to use at the CENTCOM </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Maj Gen Fry provided PJHQ advice on 25 July, including a paper entitled ‘Discrete </p>
<p>UK northern options through Turkey’.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> That stated that the US would not be able </p>
<p>logistically to sustain simultaneous assaults from the north and south, and that the </p>
<p>“northern approach therefore remains a possibility for a self&#8209;sustaining UK force package </p>
<p>as part of the overarching US campaign plan”. </p>
<p><b>459. </b> The paper identified that the objective could be to either “defeat” or to “fix” Iraqi </p>
<p>forces. The basic UK package would be an armoured division with two “square” </p>
<p>brigades. </p>
<p><b>460. </b> Maj Gen Fry advised:</p>
<p>“… what is beginning to emerge in the development of our work is the need for a </p>
<p>possible post&#8209;conflict stabilisation force in order to meet the grand strategic end </p>
<p>state of a new acceptable government.”</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Maj Gen Fry suggested that there would be a need for a three&#8209;star headquarters, </p>
<p>including to co&#8209;ordinate air assets. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> The development of thinking on force levels in a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq is </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr Bowen sent Mr Hoon’s Private Office a fuller analysis of the options for a UK </p>
<p>contribution on 25 July.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> He advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some British contributions, such as making available Diego Garcia and </p>
<p>the Cyprus bases or employing air and maritime forces already engaged in </p>
<p>operations against Iraq, could be achieved quickly. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would take another couple of months to increase forces to medium scale. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“To meet probable US time&#8209;scales” it would “not be possible to deploy a fully </p>
<p>prepared, fully sustainable armoured division for war&#8209;fighting.” A fully prepared </p>
<p>and sustained armoured division (one which could fight a significant Iraqi force) </p>
<p>would take 10 months. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deployment of an armoured division (minus) would only be possible “within </p>
<p>six months of a decision to deploy”, and would have “limited sustainment </p>
<p>and reach”. </p>
<p><b>464. </b> The limited UK capability available after six months, with no more than 10 days </p>
<p>ammunition and limited reach, could not mount a deliberate attack on large&#8209;scale Iraqi </p>
<p>forces. The potential strategic advantage would be that the “actual deployment, even </p>
<p>the preparation, should have an impact on the Iraqi regime and prevent single focus </p>
<p>attention on the US forces in the South”. So long as it did not have to engage in all&#8209;out </p>

<p>“war&#8209;fighting”, it could be enough to “sow the seeds of uncertainty in the minds of the </p>
<p>decision&#8209;makers in Baghdad”. </p>
<p><b>465. </b> “In several significant ways,” the northern option was “very attractive”. It offered </p>
<p>the UK the “opportunity to make a discrete contribution to the operation, but it also offers </p>
<p>an opportunity to integrate other allies into the operation”. It would, however, be “highly </p>
<p>challenging” and would require “not only Turkish acquiescence, but also full Turkish </p>
<p>support along the line of communication”. That would require US involvement. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Because “a good proportion of UK maritime and air assets” would be integrated </p>
<p>into the wider US effort, the force in the North would need to be confident that support </p>
<p>from the US would be available “as and when required”. That was an issue that </p>
<p>remained to be explored. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Bowen also reported that CENTCOM understood the strategic benefit of a </p>
<p>UK&#8209;led “northern effort”, but it was “not yet clear how important it is to their overall plan”. </p>
<p><b>468. </b> Mr Bowen advised Mr Hoon that it was “also assessed as militarily unwise to </p>
<p>integrate anything less than a division into the US land component”, and that “it would </p>
<p>be militarily unattractive to commit UK land forces to US operations from Kuwait.”</p>
<p><b>469. </b> On 26 July, the MOD provided advice on options for a UK contribution to US&#8209;led </p>
<p>military operations in Iraq in a letter to Mr Rycroft.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>470. </b> The MOD advised that US military planning was “in full swing but it was still </p>
<p>evolving”. The concept was for an attack launched by forces deployed in Kuwait and </p>
<p>from other Gulf States and from ships in the Gulf and elsewhere. The plan was “neither </p>
<p>fully developed nor finalised”. The Chiefs of Staff were “not yet able to judge whether this </p>
<p>is a winning concept”. Greater clarity would be needed “before any UK option could be </p>
<p>recommended”. </p>
<p><b>471. </b> The MOD stated that it was “clear that the US plan of attack from the South” did </p>
<p>not “need British land forces”:</p>
<p>“… in the time available there is very little scope for the preparation and integration </p>
<p>of British land forces into the US order of battle; moreover the logistic space </p>
<p>available in Kuwait, with five divisions worth of equipment and logistics support </p>
<p>entering through only one airhead and a single port would already be confined …” </p>
<p><b>472. </b> Adm Boyce had recommended three options:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 1</b>:<b> </b>an “in&#8209;place support package” using forces already in the region. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 2</b>:<b> </b>an “enhanced support package” comprising Package 1 with </p>
<p>additional air and maritime forces. This package could include forces that would </p>
<p>be “of particular interest to the US because of their own deficiencies, e.g. mine </p>

<p>clearance vessels and air&#8209;to&#8209;air refuellers for their carrier&#8209;based aircraft”. While </p>
<p>no conventional land forces could meet the timescales for the deployment of </p>
<p>maritime and air forces “Special Forces could be deployed very rapidly to match </p>
<p>US timescales and priorities. This is likely to be very attractive to US planners, </p>
<p>and their contribution to success would be significant.” </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Package 3</b>:<b> </b>a “discrete UK package” based on deployment of an armoured </p>
<p>division which the MOD envisaged would be used in northern Iraq, in addition </p>
<p>to the forces in Package 2. The MOD stated that a force that was “credible” </p>
<p>would be required: “Even to create uncertainty in the mind of Saddam”, and the </p>
<p>contribution of a division “would probably require command and control at Corps </p>
<p>level. The UK might consider providing an armoured division either as part of a </p>
<p>US&#8209;led Corps or as part of a larger coalition force possibly led by the UK using </p>
<p>the framework of the NATO Allied Rapid Reaction Corps [ARRC].”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>473. </b> The MOD advised:</p>
<p>“… it would take <b>six months</b> for the whole division to be in place and then with such </p>
<p>limited sustainment and reach that it would be unsuitable for a deliberate attack on </p>
<p>large&#8209;scale Iraqi forces. An optimum capability for a sustained campaign inside Iraq </p>
<p>could take about […] to achieve”.</p>
<p><b>474. </b> The MOD also stated that the “deployment of a light brigade with an air mobile </p>
<p>capability” was “an additional possibility”. That:</p>
<p>“… would have the task of securing the deployment area in Turkey ahead of the </p>
<p>arrival of the full division and preparing for operations short of armoured war fighting. </p>
<p>These could involve a role in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone if it were subject to the </p>
<p>threat of an Iraqi attack and/or post&#8209;conflict operations following the defeat of Iraqi </p>
<p>forces. The actual deployment of forces, even their preparation, should have an </p>
<p>impact on the Iraqi regime and prevent its single&#8209;focus attention on the US forces </p>
<p>in the South.”</p>
<p><b>475. </b> The MOD highlighted problems with:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the concept of a “Running Start”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the fragility of the logistic chains; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>vulnerability to chemical or biological weapons. </p>
<p><b>476. </b> The MOD stated that “thinking about dealing with the aftermath of a successful </p>
<p>attack remains sketchy”. </p>
<p><b>477. </b> Finally, the MOD drew attention to the funding which would be required once a </p>
<p>decision in principle was made to participate in military activity. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>478. </b> Mr Hoon attached “two large caveats” to all three options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>First, the timescales were “best planning estimates” and made “sweeping </p>
<p>assumptions” about basing, transit routes and overflights. They also assumed </p>
<p>that funding would be available to improve sustainability and implement UORs. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secondly, if the armed forces were required to provide 18,000&#8209;20,000 people </p>
<p>for an emergency fire service in the event of a nationwide firefighters’ strike </p>
<p>(Op FRESCO) and the US started military action in winter 2002/3, only the </p>
<p>in&#8209;place support package and Special Forces would be available. </p>
<p><b>479. </b> Mr Hoon had commissioned further work with a view to expediting what would </p>
<p>need to be done once a decision in principle had been taken. UK representatives at a </p>
<p>CENTCOM planning meeting the following week would be instructed “to set our options </p>
<p>positively but without committing us to any specific ones”. The MOD would write again </p>
<p>as soon as there was “greater clarity about the US plan, such that the Chiefs can update </p>
<p>their assessment of it (and the risks involved) and the Defence Secretary can make </p>
<p>recommendations about the best option to pursue”.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to Mr Straw’s and the Cabinet Secretary’s Private </p>
<p>Offices, and to Mr Scarlett. </p>
<p><b>481. </b> The advice was sent to Mr Blair on 31 July, as one of several “background papers” </p>
<p>he had commissioned at his meeting on 23 July “for summer reading”.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“The military are not yet ready to make a recommendation on which if any of the </p>
<p>three options to go for. Nor can they yet judge whether the US have a winning </p>
<p>concept. They are continuing to work with the US military. You do not need to take </p>
<p>decisions yet.” </p>
<p><b>483. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that Mr Blair had said that:</p>
<p>“… he didn’t want to take any decision or accept any of these options. I think in </p>
<p>retrospect … this was because … this was the time … when we were pressing for </p>
<p>the Americans to consider the UN route. I think he didn’t want to give any signal that </p>
<p>he was keen to think about a military alternative …”</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>484. </b> A minute from Mr Hoon’s Private Office on 31 July stated: </p>

<p><b>494. </b> The 30 July advice and the response are addressed in Section 6.3.</p>
<p><b>495. </b> Responding to a request from MOD officials for urgent approval to widen the </p>
<p>group involved in contingency planning to improve the estimates of the time and costs </p>
<p>of enhancements likely to be needed to support military operations, Mr Hoon concluded </p>
<p>that that would be premature.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>496. </b> On 30 July, in a meeting with Adm Boyce, Sir Kevin Tebbit, Lt Gen Pigott and </p>
<p>Mr Bowen, Mr Hoon discussed the line that Maj Gen Wilson should take in the </p>
<p>CENTCOM meeting the following day.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>497. </b> Mr Hoon acknowledged that “striking the right tone and balance … was difficult. </p>
<p>Ministers would wish the SBMA [Maj Gen Wilson] to be positive without, at this stage, </p>
<p>committing the UK to any specific contribution”. The draft provided by PJHQ on the </p>
<p>northern option “risked over committing us”. </p>
<p><b>498. </b> Mr Hoon concluded that Maj Gen Wilson should warn the US of the political </p>
<p>difficulty created by the need, in “the absence of pre&#8209;positioned assets”, for a move of </p>
<p>UK armour to Turkey, which “would have to take place early and be very visible”.</p>
<p><b>499. </b> After considerable debate, an agreed text was sent to Maj Gen Wilson on </p>
<p>1 August, and forwarded to Mr Hoon’s Office for information.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>500. </b> Maj Gen Wilson’s address emphasised that the UK fully understood and </p>
<p>sympathised “with the US position on Iraq, and Saddam Hussein”, and shared US </p>
<p>“concerns about leaving him to develop his WMD aspirations” and the potential threat he </p>
<p>posed.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> The UK was “deeply appreciative of the opportunity to … contribute towards </p>
<p>the US … planning process” and had been “working hard to identify forces” that could </p>
<p>“in principle” be made available to support the US plan. But he was “bound to reiterate” </p>
<p>that the UK had “made no decision in favour of action in Iraq” beyond its involvement in </p>
<p>enforcing the No&#8209;Fly Zones.</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Maj Gen Wilson offered “observations” on the US plan, including:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>“UK could contribute”. In the time available under “current planning”, “integration </p>
<p>would also be difficult”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK knew that the US had “been looking at how else land forces might </p>
<p>be used”, which raised the issue of “Turkey and the … ‘northern option’”. </p>
<p>“To maximise the military prospects of success” that “must be an essential </p>
<p>part of your [the US] plan … Indications are that Saddam is expecting </p>
<p>something to happen in the North. Why disappoint him and make his </p>
<p>decision process easier?” </p>
<p><b>502. </b> Maj Gen Wilson added that there would be difficulties “particularly for the UK”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>First, it would need “active Turkish support and engagement, not just </p>
<p>acquiescence”, and there “may be scepticism in UK about whether active </p>
<p>Turkish engagement could be delivered”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Second, the UK “could probably not get there as quickly … as you might </p>
<p>want us”. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> Before the UK Government could agree to exploring a military contribution </p>
<p>seriously, it was likely to need:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a much more refined mission, with a better understanding of the effects </p>
<p>required; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a better understanding of the level of US support that will be available.” </p>
<p><b>504. </b> It could be possible to achieve “certain military effects in the North … without </p>
<p>pitched battles with the Iraqis”, but defeating Iraqi forces on the way to securing the </p>
<p>northern oilfields would “probably” require a “heavy Division”, and it was “doubtful that </p>
<p>that would be possible” within US timescales. The UK had:</p>
<p>“… thought about North, but we have now taken our thinking about as far as it </p>
<p>can go without more detail from you. What we now need from you is to know what </p>
<p>you really want; and most importantly more on what effect you would want us to </p>
<p>achieve.”</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Maj Gen Wilson offered “three other observations”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Unless political and legal issues were resolved, it would be “difficult to even </p>
<p>deliver basic support”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK Government would “find it easier to engage politically” if the campaign </p>
<p>was multi&#8209;national and, if a multi&#8209;national force was considered for the northern </p>
<p>option, “that might be a role for the UK&#8209;led Allied Rapid Reaction Corps”. </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;nationality brought “complications”, but the use of the ARRC HQ would </p>
<p>bring advantages, including that it had “already been focused on the region for </p>
<p>years” which could “help save deployment time” and could “achieve the combat </p>
<p>power for certain tasks more quickly than a purely UK force”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “helpful … to have a better feel for the ‘post&#8209;conflict’ thinking and </p>
<p>aftermath management”. The experience of Afghanistan had shown it was </p>
<p>“as important to win the peace” as it was to win the war. That was “fresh” in </p>
<p>the UK’s mind, and it was “undoubtedly true that both UK politicians and … </p>
<p>military colleagues would like to know what we are getting ourselves into in the </p>
<p>longer term”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maj Gen Wilson concluded that the “involvement of significant UK land forces” </p>
<p>would be a “challenge”. The UK agreed “that the most obvious option” was </p>
<p>“through Turkey”; but more information was needed on what effect was desired </p>
<p>and “further guidance” was needed “on the political context”.</p>
<p><b>506. </b> Maj General Wilson stated that he could not stress too much that he “would have </p>
<p>been shot” if he had extended his brief. There had been “no questions” and he had </p>
<p>been “the last to speak”.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> Asked about the reaction to his talk, Maj Gen Wilson told the </p>
<p>Inquiry: “Probably ‘yoo&#8209;hahs’ and a few of those delightfully American idiosyncrasies.”</p>
<p><b>507.  Lt Gen Reith reported that Gen Franks saw great value in a northern axis led </b></p>
<p><b>by the UK, but UK preparations needed to begin. </b></p>
<p><b>508. </b> Between 5 and 7 August, Lt Gen Reith visited the US Army Central Command </p>
<p>(ARCENT) HQ and CENTCOM.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>509. </b> Lt Gen Reith reported to ACM Bagnall:</p>
<p>“The indicators point to CENTCOM being ready to commence operations from about </p>
<p>mid&#8209;Nov 02, with the main attack to launch from early Jan 03. Gen Franks is keen </p>
<p>for strong UK participation. He sees great value in an axis from TU [Turkey] led </p>
<p>by UK.” </p>
<p><b>510. </b> There was, however, concern about Turkey’s position. If an attack was not possible </p>
<p>from the north then the Kurdish oilfields would still need to be secured from the south. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith reported that Gen Franks had suggested that could also be a “worthwhile </p>
<p>discrete task for the UK”. There was a general readiness to provide US support if that </p>
<p>would make it possible for UK forces to arrive earlier. </p>
<p><b>511. </b> Lt Gen Reith concluded:</p>
<p>“With the US clock ticking, from an operational perspective, we ought to start our </p>
<p>own. We need political and financial approval as soon as is feasible to prepare, but </p>
<p>without committal to deploy. Without this the PM’s choices will be limited and he may </p>
<p>not be able to fulfil what are clearly high US expectations.”</p>

<p>Mr McKane that the US seemed:</p>
<p>“… undecided on the importance of a front in the North … He [Gen Franks] seems </p>
<p>to think that a campaign mounted from the South could be sufficient but it would </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>515. </b> Significant points in the guidance included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD’s “planning posture” was “on the basis of being ‘as positive as possible’ </p>
<p>but without implying premature political commitment”. Ministers had “not yet </p>
<p>authorised any expenditure” on force preparation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The impact of Op FRESCO needed to be factored into planning.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maintenance of operational security was “<b>critically important</b>”. Mr Hoon’s </p>
<p>“Intent and Direction” [that only named individuals could be involved] was “very </p>
<p>clear” and the implications were “understood and accepted”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>PJHQ should focus its effort on the issues which would inform judgements on </p>
<p>whether there was a “Winning Mil Strategic Concept/Plan”, including:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a military plan within an integrated political strategy;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>intelligence that was “good enough to give high confidence” that the </p>

<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the strategy for the North was “joined up”;</p>

<p>an information campaign was “in place and effective”;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>the “Coalition dimension” being “adequately covered”;</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>216</p>
<p><b>522. </b> A letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to No.10 on 12 August reported that </p>
<p>President Bush had authorised preparatory military activities costing US$1bn and that </p>
<p>an inter&#8209;agency process in Washington had been launched.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>523. </b> The MOD reported the emergence of a “hybrid option”, combining elements of both </p>
<p>the generated and running start plan. The US could be in a position to take action in </p>
<p>November and there was:</p>
<p>“… growing enthusiasm in the US for action in northern Iraq led by the UK … we will </p>
<p>need to guard against US assumptions of UK leading ground operations in northern </p>
<p>Iraq … General Franks has indicated his interest in seeing the UK lead such forces.” </p>
<p><b>524. </b> Sir David Manning wrote alongside the point above: “An idea our own MOD are v. </p>
<p>keen on; may be some ventriloquism here”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>525. </b> The MOD advised that the projected timelines for the deployment of a UK division, </p>
<p>“albeit with limited sustainment and reach”, bore “no relation to the timescale of US </p>
<p>plans”. It might be possible to reduce deployment times if the US provided support, but </p>
<p>the UK would need time for preparation. </p>
<p><b>526. </b> The MOD concluded:</p>
<p>“It will be important, therefore, in the coming weeks, to guard against any </p>
<p>assumption that the UK will take the lead from the north or could do so on the basis </p>
<p>of current US timelines. Apart from the impossibility of making military commitments </p>
<p>in advance of political decisions, there are practical constraints, one of which is </p>

<p>255</p>
<p>JIC ASSESSMENT, 21 AUGUST 2002: ‘SADDAM’S DIPLOMATIC AND MILITARY </p>
<p>OPTIONS’</p>
<p><b>527.  A JIC Assessment of 21 August concluded that in a conflict Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>Hussein would order missile strikes and the use of CBW against coalition Forces, </b></p>
<p><b>supporting regional states and Israel. </b></p>
<p><b>528.  The JIC had little intelligence on Iraq’s CBW and little insight into how it </b></p>
<p><b>would fight. Its conclusions reflected the Committee’s own judgements. </b></p>
<p><b>529. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment on 21 August </p>
<p>considering “what diplomatic options Saddam has to deter, avert or limit the scope of </p>
<p>a US&#8209;led attack”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> It also considered his “military options for facing a US&#8209;led attack” </p>
<p>and how his analysis about each course of action might “change as an attack becomes </p>
<p>increasingly imminent”. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> The JIC examined Iraq’s options for the short term, whether Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>might seize the initiative, how Iraq might respond to a US military build&#8209;up, Saddam’s </p>
<p>options in “war” – including the use of missiles and WMD and “alternative scenarios and </p>
<p>at the death”. </p>
<p><b>531. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements on the military options were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Much as Saddam Hussein would like to seize the initiative before a US attack, </p>
<p>his options remained limited. He was “likely to be cautious about using force </p>
<p>early. But the closer and more credible an attack seemed, the more risks he will </p>
<p>be willing to take, perhaps including deniable terrorist attacks, most likely in the </p>
<p>Gulf region – though we cannot exclude a threat to the UK.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Early on in any conflict, Saddam would order missile attacks on Israel, coalition </p>
<p>forces and regional states providing the US with bases.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam would order the use of CBW against coalition forces at some point, </p>
<p>probably after a coalition attack had begun. Once Saddam was convinced </p>
<p>that his fate was sealed, he would order the unrestrained use of CBW against </p>
<p>coalition forces, supporting regional states and Israel.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq would probably try to ride out air strikes while conserving its ground forces. </p>
<p>Iraq’s likely strategy for a ground war would be to make any coalition advance as </p>
<p>slow and costly as possible, trying to force the coalition to fight in urban areas.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There is a significant potential for Saddam to miscalculate, either by escalating </p>
<p>a crisis at an early stage, or by making concessions too late in the day to avert </p>
<p>an attack.”</p>
<p>219 </p>
<p>JIC Assessment, 21 August 2002, ‘Iraq: Saddam’s Diplomatic and Military Options’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>532. </b> In relation to Saddam Hussein’s options for seizing the initiative, the Assessment </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “concerted attempt” to bring down an aircraft in one of the No&#8209;Fly Zones was </p>
<p>“a possibility”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A pre&#8209;emptive attack on the Kurds or Kuwait was judged “unlikely”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “would probably … order preparations for a campaign of </p>
<p><b>terrorism and sabotage</b> in the region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… we know that Iraqi Special Forces and other organisations, such as the </p>
<p>‘Saddam Fedayeen’, also possess the capability to conduct sabotage or terrorist </p>
<p>attacks.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “possible that Iraqi terrorist attacks could be conducted against other </p>
<p>[non&#8209;military] interests or the leadership and economic (e.g. oil industry) targets </p>
<p>of regional States”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC did not “know enough about Iraqi capabilities to discount the threat </p>
<p>outside the region, including within the UK, though previously Iraqi attempts to </p>
<p>mount terrorist attacks, or engage proxies to do so on their behalf, have been </p>
<p>largely ineffective”.</p>
<p><b>533. </b> In relation to missile attacks, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam would probably order missile attacks …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Attacks on Israel would be an attempt to attract Israeli retaliation and thus widen </p>
<p>the war, split the Coalition and arouse popular opinion in the Arab States. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Missiles “could be armed with chemical or biological warfare (CBW) agents”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam might be deterred at least initially by the threat of Israeli nuclear </p>
<p>retaliation.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Attacks on coalition forces in Kuwait would require Iraq to deploy short&#8209;range </p>
<p>missiles into the “No Drive Zone”.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A pre&#8209;emptive missile attack on Israel was “less likely because it would show </p>
<p>Iraq had been lying about its retention of long range missiles”.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> The Assessment stated that the JIC had:</p>
<p>“… little insight into how the Iraqi military might plan to fight any ground war … At </p>
<p>present we have little evidence to judge whether Iraq sees urban or guerrilla warfare </p>
<p>as feasible options. Iraqi effectiveness would be mitigated by problems of command </p>
<p>and control, inadequate training and poor morale. We doubt that guerrilla activity </p>
<p>would be very effective; urban warfare is more plausible …” </p>
<p><b>535. </b> The judgements about Saddam Hussein’s potential use of chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons are addressed in Section 4.2. The firmness of those judgements, which bear </p>

<p><b>536. </b> The judgements were incorporated in a revised SPG paper produced on </p>

<p>Section 3.4. </p>
<p>THE IMPACT OF OPERATION FRESCO</p>
<p><b>538.  From late July it was clear that the possible requirement to provide cover </b></p>
<p><b>in the event of a nationwide firefighters’ strike (Op FRESCO) would limit the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>ability to deploy ground forces.</b></p>
<p><b>539.  The MOD continued, however, to promote the advantages of the northern </b></p>
<p><b>option to both UK Ministers and US military planners. </b></p>
<p><b>540.  In August UK military planning actively focused on identifying the maximum </b></p>
<p><b>contribution which the UK might be able to offer to the US. </b></p>
<p><b>541.  The MOD advised No.10 on 28 August that if Op FRESCO was implemented </b></p>
<p><b>in full, the UK would be able to provide only a brigade for land operations; and </b></p>
<p><b>that the US should be informed.</b></p>
<p><b>542. </b> During the period leading up to the invasion of Iraq a dispute over pay and </p>
<p>conditions with the Fire Brigades Union led to a requirement for an MOD contingency </p>
<p>plan, Op FRESCO, to provide a replacement fire&#8209;fighting capability to which some </p>
<p>19,000 Service Personnel were assigned.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>543. </b> Military advice about the UK’s ability to generate ground forces changed radically </p>
<p>between the end of July and the end of August. The evidence clearly demonstrates </p>
<p>the focus on identifying the “maximum effort” and giving the UK a combat role in </p>
<p>ground operations. </p>
<p><b>544. </b> Mr Hoon was sceptical about the wisdom of that approach and sought to ensure </p>
<p>that No.10 was given a more balanced perspective. </p>
<p><b>545. </b> No.10 was warned on 26 July about the potential impact of a firefighters’ strike on </p>
<p>the UK’s ability to deploy land forces for operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>546. </b> On 22 August, in the context of a predicted discussion between the US and Turkey </p>
<p>on a possible northern option, ACM Bagnall commented to Air Vice Marshal Clive </p>
<p>Loader, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations) (ACDS(Ops)), that a MOD </p>
<p>meeting held on 21 August had concluded: </p>

<p>222 </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>“… we will need to decide whether we wish to influence US planning in developing </p>
<p>any northern option. This may well be necessary sooner rather than later.”</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>547. </b> The MOD has been unable to provide any record of the meeting on 21 August.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>548. </b> On 27 August, Dr Cholerton sent Mr Hoon an update on Iraq&#8209;related </p>
<p>developments, including the potential impact of Op FRESCO.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>549. </b> Dr Cholerton reviewed recent political and diplomatic developments and its </p>
<p>understanding of US planning, including that:</p>
<p>“Operations in Northern Iraq are increasingly seen by the US planners as highly </p>
<p>desirable and an important addition to the campaign plan. The overwhelming </p>
<p>effect of simultaneous action against Saddam is one of the principal features of the </p>
<p>campaign design. It is increasingly accepted that action in the North would play </p>
<p>an important part in that; adding a significant additional complication he will have </p>
<p>to overcome.”</p>
<p><b>550. </b> In relation to the UK’s ability to deploy forces while supporting Op FRESCO, </p>
<p>Dr Cholerton advised that “a more refined set of force packages”, which would be “more </p>
<p>flexible in composition” was being developed; and that the position was “significantly </p>
<p>better” than the MOD had reported to No.10 on 26 July. Further work had shown it would </p>
<p>be possible to produce Package 2 if a firefighters’ strike lasted no longer than three </p>
<p>months. That package could include substantial maritime and air capabilities and Special </p>
<p>Forces. The ability to deploy a Royal Marine Commando Group after October 2002 was </p>
<p>included in an Annex showing an “illustrative” Package 3. </p>
<p><b>551. </b> If negotiations with the Fire Brigades Union broke down and a decision was taken </p>
<p>to begin full&#8209;scale training for Op FRESCO, it would not be possible to deploy a division, </p>
<p>but it would be possible to release forces for a single brigade tailored to operational </p>
<p>needs. That would fall well short of the contribution required to enable the UK to carry </p>
<p>out a “discrete” role in the North. </p>
<p><b>552. </b> A smaller contribution could raise “some of the integration issues which led the </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff to view our offering conventional land forces for operations in southern </p>
<p>Iraq as impractical”. The UK would, however, continue to “explore ideas of how such </p>
<p>a contribution could be made to work alongside other potential partners and drawing </p>
<p>heavily on US goodwill and resources”. </p>
<p><b>553. </b> There were suspicions that US planners continued to believe that the UK could </p>
<p>deliver a division if it were supported by the US, although there were “signs” that it was </p>
<p>“looking at the provision of US forces” if the UK could not provide a division. A draft </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>563. </b> On the same day, Maj Gen Fry provided advice for the Chiefs of Staff, reviewing </p>
<p>planning for operations in Iraq as requested by Lt Gen Pigott on 8 August.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>564. </b> Maj Gen Fry reported that the US was now working on a “hybrid option”, which </p>
<p>contained elements of both the running and generated start. The “importance of the </p>
<p>development of an axis in the North is now fully recognised”, and a contingency plan </p>
<p>was being developed to commit significant US forces, possibly in addition to any </p>
<p>coalition contributions. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> The most significant development was that Land Command now believed it could </p>
<p>deploy HQ ARRC, HQ 1st (UK) Armoured Division, one triangular brigade, 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade and a logistic brigade some 124 days after a political decision to allow overt </p>
<p>preparations for deployment. There would be some risk to the UK’s ability to deploy </p>
<p>forces in 2004:</p>
<p>“… the overall penalties … would be severe, some roulement tour lengths would be </p>
<p>extended to 12 months and the generation of armoured and mechanised HR [High </p>
<p>Readiness] forces in [20]04 would be put at risk.”</p>
<p><b>566. </b> Maj Gen Fry advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The northern approach offers the opportunity for greatest effect but probably </p>
<p>carries the highest risk.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If a northern option for a land package was not viable, a western approach </p>
<p>through Jordan could offer “very similar effects at less risk”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A timely effect in the South could probably only be achieved by the ARG </p>
<p>[Amphibious Ready Group] in support of the US MEF [Marine Expeditionary </p>
<p>Force].” </p>
<p><b>567. </b> The risks of the northern approach were listed in an Annex as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to be deployed in time to secure parts of the oilfields around Kirkuk </p>
<p>from Iraqi destruction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The weather from January to March could severely restrict air operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The distance to be travelled overland would be more than 1,000km.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The terrain would constrain manoeuvre and considerable US engineer support </p>
<p>would be needed to cross the river Tigris.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Long lines of communication and challenges to sustainability.</p>
<p><b>568. </b> The paper invited the Chiefs of Staff to agree that potential UK force contributions </p>
<p>could be exposed to US planners to inform the CENTCOM planning conference </p>
<p>scheduled for 23 September; and that, if the UK was “to retain a claim to leadership </p>

<p>231</p>
<p> He advised:</p>
<p>“Whilst I am continually reinforcing the UK policy line to US colleagues in CENTCOM </p>
<p>(discreet planning and scoping, but without political endorsement or commitment), </p>
<p>the demands of US operational planning necessitate input on UK planning data and </p>
<p>separately, our intent for key evolutions [activities] such as ground recces to Turkey </p>
<p>and [Exercise] Internal Look. In terms of expectation management, and without </p>
<p>over stating it as seen from here, the time for putting more UK military cards on the </p>
<p>CENTCOM/EUCOM tables (caveated as necessary) is fast approaching.” </p>

<p><b>572.  No decision on a possible UK military contribution to US operations was </b></p>
<p><b>taken before the meeting with President Bush, but the MOD advised that there </b></p>
<p><b>could be a need for tough decisions within two weeks. </b></p>

<p><b>575. </b> In response to the MOD advice of 28 August, Mr Blair’s view, as reported on </p>

<p>SPG PAPER, 4 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>578. </b> A revised version of the SPG paper ‘UK Military Strategic Thinking on Iraq’ was </p>
<p>produced on 4 September.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> The paper contained significant new analysis about the US </p>
<p>intentions and their implications for UK planning. </p>
<p><b>579. </b> The SPG assessed that the US had “sufficient combat power to destabilise, and </p>
<p>overthrow the current Iraqi regime” by itself, but it required a “minimum coalition” to </p>
<p>provide basing and transit, including use of UK bases in Cyprus and Diego Garcia. The </p>
<p>paper also set out the current CENTCOM concept and plan, including an assessment </p>
<p>that “shaping operations” (described as including a “series of activities designated as </p>
<p>spikes by the US”, which were “intended to progressively increase the level and tempo </p>
<p>of military activity”) had “already begun” and the UK was “implicated in their conduct”.</p>
<p><b>580. </b> A number of key issues would “need to be resolved” to evaluate the design of the </p>
<p>campaign. Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>avoiding a tactical victory at the cost of strategic failure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>determining the “strategic effect” the UK was seeking from participation in the </p>
<p>campaign;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrating “US/UK solidarity (delivering the Special Relationship)”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adding “value through sharing the planning burden, and acting as a moderating </p>
<p>influence” on the US; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrating that the UK was “an active, determined and capable nation by </p>
<p>making an operationally significant contribution, in a discrete role that satisfies </p>
<p>a clear military objective”. </p>
<p><b>581. </b> The potential UK strategic objectives identified by the SPG were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Stand alongside the US as a junior partner, sharing both the strategic and </p>
<p>operational risks and burdens, to:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>preserve the Atlantic Alliance; and</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Remove the threat that any Iraqi regime may pose to the UK, UK interests </p>
<p>and regional stability through its failure to comply with international law and </p>
<p>agreements. That implied:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>verifiable destruction of Iraq’s WMD capability; and</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>establishing a regime that had the trust of the international community.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reintegrate Iraq into the international community.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support and where possible enhance regional stability. That implied:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>preventing the establishment of a Shia dominated Islamic fundamentalist </p>
<p>state; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>ensuring the impact of military operations was “at the very minimum … </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Enhance the security of the UK’s long&#8209;term economic interests, including </p>
<p>oil supplies. </p>
<p><b>582. </b> The SPG defined the UK’s “Military Strategic Objectives” as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide US Commanders “with support necessary for the execution of [the] </p>
<p>approved campaign plan, focusing first on delivery of critical capabilities”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assist the US to create conditions to deny Iraq’s ability to use its WMD;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>create conditions for a changed Iraqi regime;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>create conditions to strengthen regional security and stability; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assist US forces in securing Iraq’s oil infrastructure and production facilities. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> Other key points in the paper included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No clear picture had “yet emerged” on how the US planned to “effect … regime </p>
<p>change (other than … military defeat and subsequent elimination of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was experienced with chemical weapons and had experimented with </p>
<p>biological weapons. There was “every reason” to believe they would be used </p>
<p>if regime survival was threatened.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US and UK policies on a “deterrent response to Iraqi first use of WMD” needed </p>
<p>to be reviewed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need to determine what would constitute “success for an inspection </p>
<p>regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 3 was defined as including “UK Force Elements with a discrete role </p>
<p>in the North, within an integrated US&#8209;led campaign”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risk analysis was based on the provision of a division (minus). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An illustrative force package included a Royal Marine Commando Group which </p>
<p>would be available after October as part of the maritime element, an armoured </p>

<p>division including two square armoured brigades, and a light “Air Assault </p>
<p>capable” brigade.</p>
<p><b>584. </b> The SPG advised that, in the absence of clear post&#8209;conflict plans, the potential </p>
<p>scale of the UK military engagement remained unknown. In the worst case, the UK </p>
<p>needed to be prepared for “a substantial long&#8209;term commitment”. </p>
<p><b>585. </b> The SPG’s conclusions on post&#8209;conflict issues are addressed in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>586. </b> The SPG concluded that the “key<b> military</b> question” which had to be addressed </p>
<p>was: “Is there a winning military concept and plan?” </p>
<p><b>587. </b> The paper set out lists of the conditions that would need to be met for the UK </p>
<p>to answer yes, and the reasons why the UK should not offer to participate in the </p>
<p>CENTCOM plan. </p>
<p><b>588. </b> The Chiefs of Staff met on 4 and 6 September, but no discussion of the military </p>
<p>options for Iraq is recorded in the minutes.</p>

<p>MOD ADVICE, 6 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Sir David Manning asked the MOD for advice in preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush at Camp David on 7 to 8 September.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>590. </b> An initial draft of the advice, submitted by Dr Cholerton, described the meeting at </p>
<p>Camp David as “to discuss Iraq”, the possibility of an ultimatum to Iraq on the return of </p>
<p>weapons inspectors, and Mr Blair’s candid reference the previous day to regime change </p>
<p>and the planned publication of a dossier (see Section 3.4).</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>591. </b> Dr Cholerton advised that further work in PJHQ and Land Command suggested </p>
<p>it might be possible to generate “up to ‘division scale’ forces … 4 months after an </p>
<p>overt political decision” as well as HQ ARRC; and that the Chiefs of Staff would look at </p>
<p>whether the US military plan would deliver the UK’s desired end state.</p>
<p><b>592. </b> Dr Cholerton advised that Mr Blair “should be cautious in discussing UK’s ability </p>
<p>to contribute to military capability” with President Bush. </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>594. </b> On 5 September, Mr Hoon discussed the draft letter to No.10 with Adm Boyce, </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit, Lt Gen Pigott, Maj Gen Fry and Mr Ian Lee, who had replaced </p>
<p>Mr Bowen as MOD Director General Operational Policy.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>595. </b> The note of the meeting recorded that they concluded there was now slightly more </p>
<p>clarity on the window for military action (then considered to be between December 2002 </p>
<p>and May 2003), and the possibility of a simultaneous entry into Iraq from the north and </p>
<p>south. The Chiefs of Staff were not yet in a position to determine if the US had a winning </p>
<p>concept, and were focused on the ability to mount an operation from the north. </p>
<p><b>596. </b> Mr Hoon pointed to the complication resulting from the shift in the diplomatic </p>
<p>context, which raised the question of the “necessity or otherwise to move assets” while </p>
<p>the UN process was under way “and before Parliament returned in mid&#8209;October”. That </p>
<p>“was especially acute for Package 3”. A requirement to support Op FRESCO “effectively </p>
<p>precluded our offering a fully capable fighting division”. That meant that the UK should </p>
<p>assume that the US would deploy its 4th Infantry Division to the North. It would be </p>
<p>difficult to integrate UK forces with that Division; the Chiefs of Staff would “consider </p>
<p>whether we could offer some land force components of a larger coalition” force in the </p>
<p>North. Even Package 2 would require early decisions on UORs, including desertisation </p>
<p>of equipment. </p>
<p><b>597. </b> In Mr Hoon’s view, the draft advice for No.10 underplayed “the scale of the </p>
<p>contribution provided by Package 2 and the degree of influence which it would give us </p>
<p>on US military planning”.</p>
<p><b>598. </b> Mr Blair discussed the UK’s military contribution with Mr Hoon on 5 September.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Straw was also present. </p>
<p><b>599. </b> Mr Watkins recorded that Mr Blair, Mr Hoon and Mr Straw had discussed the </p>
<p>packages, and that Mr Hoon had highlighted the benefits of Package 2. “No decisions </p>
<p>were taken” and Mr Blair “did not expect President Bush to commit himself imminently to </p>
<p>a military campaign”. </p>
<p><b>600. </b> Mr Watkins also recorded that Mr Hoon had met Mr Brown to discuss the options </p>
<p>and alert him to the likely costs of Package 2. </p>
<p><b>601. </b> There was no No.10 record of the meeting.</p>
<p><b>602. </b> Mr Lee provided a revised letter to No.10, advising caution because the advice had </p>
<p>been “assembled in a short space of time from a necessarily limited group”.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Watkins responded that Mr Hoon had asked for the letter to be recast to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>possibility of a land “Task Force” should be more heavily caveated as Mr Hoon remained </p>
<p>“of the view that we should not offer now more than we are certain we can deliver”.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Hoon also asked for a reference to be included to the fact that a land task force </p>
<p>would “lend itself to involving other countries should they so wish”. He would consider </p>
<p>the text again the following day. </p>
<p><b>604. </b> On 6 September, Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning, providing an update </p>
<p>on US military planning and “the factors informing decisions on any UK military </p>
<p>contribution”.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> He cautioned that the MOD’s assessment was “necessarily provisional”, </p>
<p>partly because the US plan was still evolving, and partly because there had not yet been </p>
<p>“detailed joint planning with the US”. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> The MOD had identified three options ranging from minimum to maximum effort. </p>
<p>That included a further revision of the impact of Op FRESCO, which meant that:</p>
<p>“Were we to throw in everything we are likely to have, the UK could potentially </p>
<p>generate up to a divisional headquarters, an armoured brigade, 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade and a logistic brigade”. </p>
<p><b>606. </b> The MOD was also “examining whether a Royal Marine Commando Group could </p>
<p>form part of Package 2 [the air and maritime forces packages]”.</p>
<p><b>607. </b> A land task force would “offer significant capability to a US&#8209;led northern force, </p>
<p>although it would not be fully suitable for involvement in decisive war&#8209;fighting </p>
<p>operations”. It would also require switching units assigned to Op FRESCO training, and </p>

<p><b>Attack in Iraq, 5 September 2002</b></p>
<p>In response to hostile acts against Coalition aircraft monitoring the southern No&#8209;Fly Zone, </p>
<p>US aircraft, with UK aircraft in support, attacked an Iraqi air defence facility in western </p>
<p>Iraq on 5 September, prompting press speculation that it was a prelude to Special Forces </p>
<p>attacks and more general military action.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The outcome of the meeting at Camp David</b></p>
<p><b>619.  Mr Blair cautioned President Bush about his assumption that the UK would </b></p>
<p><b>be ready to lead a strike into northern Iraq. But he told President Bush that the UK </b></p>
<p><b>would take a significant military role if it came to war with Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>620.  Mr Blair told Mr Hoon that he had been alarmed by the US expectations that </b></p>
<p><b>the UK would lead the northern axis and there should be no visible preparations </b></p>
<p><b>for a month or so. But Mr Hoon was not sent a copy of Sir David Manning’s record </b></p>
<p><b>of the discussions at Camp David.</b></p>
<p><b>621. </b> Mr Blair met President Bush and Vice President Cheney at Camp David on </p>
<p>7 September.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>622. </b> Before his meeting with Mr Blair, President Bush held a meeting of his National </p>
<p>Security Council at Camp David which was given a briefing by Gen Franks, who </p>
<p>introduced his concept of a campaign comprising five simultaneous “operational fronts” </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>623. </b> The meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush, the press conference which </p>
<p>preceded it, and President Bush’s decision to take the issue of Iraq to the UN, are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 3.4. </p>
<p><b>624. </b> In relation to the discussion at Camp David on military action, Mr Blair said that he </p>
<p>was in no doubt about the need to deal with Saddam Hussein; and that the likelihood </p>
<p>was that this would mean military action at some point: </p>
<p>“If it came to force, we could hope that we would secure the relatively quick </p>
<p>overthrow of Saddam. But even if we did, we would, still be faced with the big issue </p>

<p><b>632. </b> There is no evidence which explains how President Bush was advised that the </p>

<p>256</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>636. </b> The JIC Assessment was issued on 9 September.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> The Key Judgements stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq has a chemical and biological weapons capability and Saddam is prepared </p>
<p>to use it.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Faced with the likelihood of military defeat and being removed from power, </p>
<p>Saddam is unlikely to be deterred from using chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>by any diplomatic or military means.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of chemical and biological weapons prior to any military attack would </p>
<p>boost support for US&#8209;led action and is unlikely.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam is prepared to order missile strikes against Israel, with chemical or </p>
<p>biological warheads, in order to widen the war once hostilities begin.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam could order the use of CBW weapons in order to deny space and </p>
<p>territory to Coalition forces, or to cause casualties, slow any advance, and sap </p>
<p>US morale.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If not previously employed, Saddam will order the indiscriminate use of whatever </p>
<p>CBW weapons remain available late in a ground campaign or as a final act </p>
<p>of vengeance. But such an order would depend on the availability of delivery </p>
<p>means and the willingness of commanders to obey.”</p>

<p><b>than it could deliver and was therefore expecting to offer maritime and air assets </b></p>

<p><b>639.  MOD planning for a land contribution and discussions with the US </b></p>
<p><b>continued. </b></p>
<p><b>640.  Lt Gen Reith continued to report a military perception that the US wanted </b></p>
<p><b>a UK&#8209;led force in the North. </b></p>
<p><b>641. </b> In preparation for Mr Hoon’s meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld on 11 September, </p>
<p>Dr Cholerton provided a list of questions seeking clarification on a number of issues.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He identified Turkey’s attitude and the US perspective on the northern option as “the key </p>
<p>points” on which “more clarity” was needed from the US.</p>
<p><b>642. </b> In a meeting with Mr Hoon on 11 September, Secretary Rumsfeld raised the </p>
<p>firefighters’ strike.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> Mr Hoon explained that, partly for this reason but also because </p>
<p>“movement of UK ground force assets could become visible prematurely in relation to </p>
<p>the diplomatic/UN process”, the UK would not want to offer more than it could deliver </p>
<p>and was therefore expecting to offer maritime and air assets for any military campaign. </p>
<p><b>643. </b> On 12 September, Lt Gen Reith submitted further advice to Lt Gen Pigott on </p>
<p>“the UK component options available to contribute to US action in decisive operations </p>
<p>against Iraq”.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>644. </b> Lt Gen Reith provided a detailed analysis of the individual components which </p>
<p>could contribute to the operation and the assumptions surrounding them. He understood </p>
<p>that the Chiefs of Staff were now content with the UK Special Forces, air and maritime </p>
<p>contributions. He focused on the land component, where a decision was “now required”. </p>
<p>A number of factors were considered, of which “US requirements” were judged to be the </p>
<p>“most important”. </p>
<p><b>645. </b> Lt Gen Reith identified a spectrum of options from the deployment of a Royal </p>

<p>Brigade for operations in northern Iraq. The emphasis was on options to be used in the </p>
<p>North, although Lt Gen Reith stated:</p>
<p>“… a contribution could still be offered (albeit under significant constraints) for use … </p>
<p>in the South, if movement through Tu[rkey] became politically unacceptable.” </p>
<p><b>646. </b> Lt Gen Reith recommended an option to deploy a UK divisional HQ and an </p>

<p><b>scale land force would commit the UK to three medium scale operations.</b></p>
<p><b>657.  In the event of the deployment of UK land forces, there was a judgement </b></p>

<p><b>post&#8209;conflict phase. Both would be difficult to sustain.</b></p>
<p><b>658.  Adm Boyce noted that it was “inconceivable” that the UK military would not </b></p>

<p>contingency work”. </p>
<p><b>661. </b> The SPG identified continuing uncertainties in the potential shape and timing of </p>
<p>a campaign and the Chiefs of Staff view was that it was not “yet” a winning concept:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The northern option was not yet “firmly established as a viable axis” because </p>
<p>of uncertainties about Turkey and the logistic feasibility of the operation. The </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff would “wish to assess whether there is yet sufficient operational </p>
<p>emphasis being place upon it for the UK to commit forces”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The [US] timelines determining UK “deadlines” were based on offering </p>
<p>President Bush “the earliest opportunity for action, as opposed to ‘the last safe </p>
<p>moment’ for a decision”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no clear articulation of post&#8209;conflict scenarios and their demands.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN track might “delay rather than advance decisions on the legality of any </p>

<p><b>662. </b> A Royal Marine Commando Group deployed with the Amphibious Response Group </p>
<p>offered “a high readiness, flexible <b>small scale land contribution</b>” which presented </p>
<p>“an opportunity for ‘boots on the ground’ if the UK decision [was] not to commit beyond </p>
<p>Package 2”.</p>
<p><b>663. </b> The SPG identified the land element of Package 3 as on “the critical path for both </p>
<p>UK and US planning”. It was clear from contacts with the US that there was:</p>
<p>“… an expectation of UK ground force commitment, and although there is a genuine </p>
<p>willingness to facilitate our being there, this is not without limit.” </p>
<p><b>664. </b> The section headed “Conflict vs Post&#8209;conflict” asked whether, if UK forces were </p>
<p>to participate in the military campaign, “our effort should be against the need to meet </p>
<p>US short&#8209;term planning for combat, or the equally demanding and pressing need for </p>
<p>preparations for the post&#8209;conflict phase”. It continued:</p>
<p>“Conflict phase. Commitment to this phase may carry with it inherent risks with </p>
<p>regard to post&#8209;conflict engagement with little choice on role, timing, location, or </p>
<p>future extraction. An alternative approach that offers a UK lead, or UK participation </p>
<p>in the post&#8209;conflict phase may be equally attractive to the US as our commitment </p>
<p>to a land role in the conflict phase.</p>
<p>“Post&#8209;Conflict. Given the wide range of possible post&#8209;conflict scenarios these forces </p>
<p>would have to be combat capable forces at high readiness, and in all probability </p>
<p>with key elements forward deployed during the conflict phase. The length and </p>
<p>scale of our post&#8209;conflict commitment will determine our ability to fulfil a range of </p>
<p>other operations, and most notable our Balkan commitment. An enduring medium </p>
<p>scale commitment in Iraq would preclude continued medium scale engagement in </p>
<p>the Balkans.</p>
<p>“Strategic Balance. We are currently committed to two medium scale land operations </p>
<p>(FRESCO and the Balkans), and a land commitment to Iraq at anything above small </p>
<p>scale will commit us to <b>three medium scale</b> land operations. Although with a full </p>
<p>Package 3 commitment to the conflict phase we retain the SLE [Spearhead Land </p>
<p>Element], our ability to deploy and sustain even a small scale force package has </p>
<p>yet to be determined, and anything above this Scale of Effort will be impossible … </p>
<p>Recovery and recuperation will also be key to our judgements as to which phase </p>
<p>to commit to. Hard and fast judgements are not possible, however, commitment of </p>
<p>Package 3 will have an effect for at least two years.”</p>
<p><b>665. </b> The SPG concluded: </p>
<p>“<b>Assuming that UK land participation is a requirement, there is a judgement </b></p>
<p><b>to be made on whether we should be engaged in the conflict or post&#8209;conflict </b></p>
<p><b>phases. Both would be difficult to sustain</b>.” </p>

<p>275</p>
<p><b>666. </b> The SPG recorded that the Chiefs of Staff had:</p>
<p>“… already voiced clear reservations over the integration of substantial UK land </p>
<p>forces in the southern theatre. Therefore, if we are to be engaged in combat </p>
<p>operations the US and UK military preference is that we should be in northern Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>667. </b> The SPG identified a number of concerns, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “evident” complexities of the command relationship between CENTCOM </p>
<p>and EUCOM, “against the need to deliver a compliant Turkey”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inability to conduct a detailed reconnaissance created a “significant risk”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Northern Iraq was “a difficult area politically”. Turkey still remembered the UK’s </p>
<p>role in creating an Iraq which included Mosul “and its associated oilfields”. </p>
<p>The Kurds remembered the UK’s assistance in Op HAVEN [in 1991], but were </p>
<p>“equally quick to remember that it was the RAF that effectively suppressed a </p>
<p>number of Kurdish revolts”. There was a “real danger that post conflict the UK, </p>
<p>simply through our force location, would retain the ‘lead’ in the North, thereby </p>
<p>splitting our lines of communication [with other forces in the Gulf] … and placing </p>
<p>us in an intractable position for some time”.</p>
<p><b>668. </b> The SPG confirmed that there was “broad agreement between MOD and PJHQ </p>
<p>staffs” on the option recommended by PJHQ. </p>
<p><b>669. </b> Also on 19 September, the Chiefs of Staff discussed a draft submission to Mr Hoon </p>
<p>circulated by Lt Gen Pigott.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>670. </b> The minutes of the COS discussion recorded that “a simultaneous advance </p>
<p>of forces in the southern and northern axes [would be] key to overwhelming the Iraqi </p>
<p>decision making process”; and that Gen Franks “strongly favoured a UK&#8209;led force in the </p>
<p>North” as an alternative to deploying a US infantry division.</p>
<p><b>671. </b> A “Package 4” was being developed “to address the inevitable post&#8209;conflict tasks”. </p>
<p>Adm Boyce commented that it was “inconceivable that the UK would not contribute in </p>
<p>some manner, to those tasks”. </p>
<p><b>672. </b> Lt Gen Reith strongly recommended offering a limited version of Option 3: a land </p>
<p>option of a divisional headquarters and a square armoured brigade (with four battalions </p>
<p>or regiments) operating alongside a US formation. </p>
<p><b>673. </b> Gen Walker expressed some misgivings. Although the force package was about </p>
<p>right, he “did not believe the plan as currently envisaged, to be a viable concept”. He </p>
<p>was concerned about the semi&#8209;autonomous nature of the UK forces and integration with </p>
<p>the US as envisaged, the lack of an operational reserve, assumptions on Iraq combat </p>
<p>capability, and the reliance on air power. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>674. </b> Lt Gen Reith stated that it would be “easier, militarily, to ratchet down than ratchet </p>
<p>up any forces offered”, but the “COS acknowledged that it might be unattractive </p>
<p>politically,</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> to deliver less than that which had initially been offered”.</p>
<p><b>675. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed that the package recommended by Lt Gen Reith was a </p>
<p>viable option, subject to resolving the constraints which had been identified; and that an </p>
<p>armoured brigade represented the smallest force that could act autonomously. </p>
<p><b>676. </b> Lt Gen Reith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I got a briefing on the northern option from my own staff on the 18 September, </p>
<p>having done operational analysis on it, and it was clear that we couldn’t do it on our </p>
<p>own, even with a full division.”</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>677. </b> When Mr Hoon discussed the options with his most senior advisers later that day, </p>
<p>Adm Boyce told him that there was “clearer [US] understanding of the importance of </p>
<p>operations in northern Iraq to ‘fix’ Iraqi forces”.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> Gen Franks had indicated that it would </p>
<p>be “helpful if the UK could provide in the North an armoured brigade and a 2&#8209;star tactical </p>
<p>lead” which would command US forces. </p>
<p><b>678. </b> Adm Boyce added that the Chiefs of Staff had continuing doubts about whether </p>
<p>the US had a winning concept.</p>
<p><b>679. </b> When Package 3 was discussed, Mr Hoon requested clarification of the length of </p>
<p>time necessary to deploy a land contribution. </p>
<p><b>680. </b> Adm Boyce said that early decisions would be needed on UORs, reserves </p>
<p>and units which were allocated to Op FRESCO. Package 3 would also require a </p>
<p>“£1bn premium”, which “could exhaust the Reserve”. </p>
<p><b>681. </b> Mr Hoon agreed that, subject to No.10’s agreement, Lt Gen Reith would be able to </p>
<p>indicate to CENTCOM, for planning purposes and with the caveat that no final political </p>
<p>decision had been taken, that two separate UK contributions could potentially be </p>
<p>available: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 2, which offered a “significant and useful contribution to any US led </p>
<p>action”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 3 as a possible add&#8209;on, with guidance that the US should also plan </p>
<p>without it. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> Mr Hoon also asked for a detailed breakdown of the estimated costs of UORs for </p>
<p>a meeting with Mr Brown on 23 September.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>683.  On 20 September, the MOD sought Mr Blair’s agreement to offer Package 3 </b></p>
<p><b>as a “possible add&#8209;on” to CENTCOM “for planning purposes”. </b></p>
<p><b>684. </b> On 20 September, Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning, advising that two issues </p>
<p>needed quickly to be addressed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what potential UK force contribution should be presented to a US planning </p>
<p>conference the following week; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether to replace army units already allocated to Op FRESCO so that they </p>
<p>would be available if a land force contribution was approved.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>685. </b> The MOD proposed that the air and maritime package with Special Forces </p>
<p>(Package 2), should be presented as a potential UK contribution at the CENTCOM </p>
<p>planning conference; and that further work was under way on whether the UK might </p>
<p>also offer a Commando Group of around 1,700 Royal Marines for early operations in </p>
<p>southern Iraq. It would need to be established whether that could be sustained in parallel </p>
<p>with ground operations in the North.</p>
<p><b>686. </b> The MOD had also considered the provision of a divisional headquarters </p>
<p>together with an armoured brigade to operate with the US (Package 3). That would be </p>
<p>“more complicated”, but the Chiefs of Staff regarded that as the “minimum sensible” </p>
<p>ground contribution to operations in the North. It would entail a commitment of around </p>
<p>28,000 service personnel in addition to the 13,000 in Package 2, and the call&#8209;out of </p>
<p>around 6,000 Reservists – a decision that would need to be taken and announced in </p>
<p>mid&#8209;October. </p>
<p><b>687. </b> Mr Watkins told Sir David that Mr Hoon felt it would be “premature” to offer a </p>
<p>ground contribution on the same basis as Package 2:</p>
<p>“… we should indicate to CENTCOM that we are still considering this option and that </p>
<p>they should model two plans in parallel, one including the UK land force contribution </p>
<p>and one without it.”</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Watkins also wrote that a “publicly visible measure” to remove units from </p>
<p>Op FRESCO would be needed to keep the option of a ground force open. Mr Hoon </p>
<p>recommended that Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons, which had </p>
<p>been recalled to debate Iraq on 24 September (see Section 3.5), would provide the </p>
<p>opportunity to make clear “as part of the Government’s policy that the will of [the] United </p>
<p>Nations must ultimately be backed up by the threat of force”, and that the Ministry of </p>
<p>Defence would be taking some prudent contingency measures to avoid foreclosing </p>
<p>military options. </p>
<p><b>689. </b> Some public acknowledgement that MOD was involved in contingency work </p>
<p>would also allow “discreet discussions” to begin with industry. That was “increasingly </p>

<p>278</p>
<p>urgent” and if it was not acknowledged publicly, there was “a clear risk of the information </p>
<p>leaking, leading to accusations that we have been less than open with Parliament”. </p>
<p><b>690. </b> The letter made no reference to a possible UK contribution to post&#8209;conflict military </p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Copies of Mr Watkins’ letter were sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw, </p>
<p>Mr Brown and Sir Andrew Turnbull, and to Mr Bowen. </p>
<p><b>692.  Mr Blair and Sir David Manning had reservations about the viability and costs </b></p>
<p><b>of the MOD proposal.</b></p>
<p><b>693. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“The possibility that the military could make a land contribution in the North is </p>
<p>a surprise. Until recently we were being told that covering the firemen’s strike </p>
<p>(Operation FRESCO) would make this impossible. Now, suddenly it isn’t. The </p>
<p>(militarily mouth&#8209;watering) prospect of being given tactical leadership of the </p>
<p>campaign in the North … may have something to do with this volte face.”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>694. </b> Sir David advised Mr Blair to “register extreme caution” and to address a number </p>
<p>of questions; in particular: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How this was suddenly possible? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What confidence there was that the Turkish angle would be sorted out?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether the UK could sustain the numbers and, if so, for how long?</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Sir David advised that Mr Blair should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>give the MOD the “go ahead” provided the conditions they had identified were </p>
<p>met, including that CENTCOM should “produce a parallel plan without a UK </p>
<p>contribution” which “may well not be forthcoming”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agree to the replacement of key units allocated to OP FRESCO.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> Mr Blair wrote: </p>
<p>“As discussed. Be careful of this Land idea …”</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>697.  In a meeting with Mr Hoon on 23 September, Mr Blair agreed limited </b></p>
<p><b>contingency preparations for a land option, but asked for publicity to be </b></p>
<p><b>minimised. </b></p>
<p><b>698.  Following the discussion, the MOD informed the US that the UK was still </b></p>

<p>275</p>
<p><b> the Inquiry has seen no evidence to indicate that the </b></p>

<p><b>701. </b> Mr Blair discussed the issues with Mr Hoon on 23 September.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>702. </b> Following that meeting, Mr Watkins informed officials in the MOD that: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is content for us to proceed broadly as set out in my letter </p>
<p>of 20 September. The Prime Minister remains very cautious about the viability </p>
<p>of Package 3, not least because of its implications for our ability to meet other </p>
<p>contingencies and the significant cost premium entailed. In the light of this, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>believes that it is all the more necessary heavily to caveat this possibility in contacts </p>
<p>with the US. We should emphasise that it is at the limits of what we could offer </p>
<p>and that – because of other potential demands on our Armed Forces including </p>
<p>FRESCO – we cannot be sure that we could deliver it. The US must therefore </p>
<p>examine carefully how they would plan the campaign in the absence of such </p>
<p>a contribution.” </p>
<p><b>703. </b> The packages that might be offered to the US were to be conveyed in terms </p>
<p>cleared with Mr Hoon’s Private Office. </p>
<p><b>704. </b> Mr Blair had also confirmed that he was content to reallocate units from </p>
<p>Op FRESCO and agreed that his statement on 24 September would contain a reference </p>
<p>to the need for preparedness. </p>
<p><b>705. </b> Mr Watkins made no reference to any discussion of post&#8209;conflict issues.</p>
<p><b>706. </b> Sir David Manning’s record of the meeting on 23 September, issued on </p>
<p>25 September, stated that Mr Blair had agreed that “we should present Package 2 as </p>
<p>a potential contribution at the CENTCOM Planning Conference” and: “We should not </p>
<p>be shy about presenting this as a significant and valuable offer.”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>707. </b> Sir David also recorded that Mr Blair had agreed that units for Op FRESCO </p>
<p>should be replaced to maintain the possibility of a land force contribution, with minimum </p>
<p>publicity. Mr Blair did not, however, want “any suggestion” that the UK might offer </p>
<p>“a major land contribution to a Force in northern Iraq. We should not surface this </p>
<p>possibility at the [US] Planning conference.” </p>

<p><b>717. </b> When the Chiefs of Staff discussed Iraq planning on 25 September, Adm Boyce </p>
<p>emphasised that:</p>
<p>“… expectation management with respect to UK caveats had to be taut. Package 2 </p>
<p>… was a formidable contribution in its own right and Package 3, given its importance </p>
<p>to the US, was not just a ‘nice to have’.”</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>718. </b> The Chiefs of Staff also discussed the post&#8209;conflict phase, “Phase IV”. It was </p>

<p>“guard against any accusation that the “US does the war&#8209;fighting while the UK does </p>
<p>the peacekeeping”. Not being involved in Package 3 at all “would be difficult to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>720. </b> On 26 September, Lt Gen Pigott wrote to Lt Gen Reith with guidance to </p>
<p>“summarise the current baseline on … options and to flag up the key issues”, on which </p>
<p>addressees and their staff could draw on in discussion with US contacts.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>721. </b> Lt Gen Pigott cautioned that aftermath and “Home Base” requirements were still </p>
<p>to be addressed and “could impact on the final shape” of the force packages he was </p>
<p>describing. </p>
<p><b>722. </b> Lt Gen Pigott identified that there was:</p>
<p>“… much work to be done if there is to be any prospect of a significant UK Land </p>
<p>option from the North within current time windows … Until we have a much better </p>
<p>feel for all the factors … we should be very cautious of giving US Commanders the </p>
<p>impression that we can deliver something which events, most of them outside our </p>
<p>control, simply preclude.” </p>
<p><b>723. </b> Lt Gen Pigott concluded: </p>
<p>“Package 3 must at the moment have considerable caveats, and every effort must </p>
<p>be made to dampen expectations that it can be delivered.” </p>
<p><b>724. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“It was indeed decided that we would not expose the full large&#8209;scale option to the US </p>
<p>at that point because of concerns about the UN process, because … lack of clarity </p>
<p>… persisted, as to whether the Turks would actually provide the necessary facilities </p>
<p>for the northern option which was the one mainly under consideration.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>725. </b> Lord Boyce initially told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I think that Package 2 would have disappeared as being a favoured option in about </p>
<p>September, because the large&#8209;scale option was obviously more difficult to prepare, </p>
<p>so our focus was on that.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>726. </b> Asked whether he was aware of the size of the UK contribution that was on the </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>SPG PAPER, 30 SEPTEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>727.  The SPG advised on 30 September that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>A coercive strategy, “Force on Mind”, was “the key instrument of military </b></p>
<p><b>power” during a conflict prevention phase.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Overt preparations for the use of military force were strategic elements of </b></p>
<p><b>that strategy.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The northern option was seen as strategically fundamental by the UK but </b></p>
<p><b>was not seen as operationally fundamental by CENTCOM.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>More clarification was needed of the likely tasks for UK land forces and </b></p>
<p><b>planning was still constrained by uncertainties about Turkey.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The UN route and the timetable for inspections might not be compatible </b></p>
<p><b>with the US timetable for the pursuit of regime change, which might pose </b></p>
<p><b>a potential fault line between the US and UK.</b></p>
<p><b>728. </b> A further version of the SPG paper ‘UK Military Strategic Thinking on Iraq’ was </p>
<p>produced on 30 September.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>729. </b> The paper stated that Ministerial statements highlighted a twin track approach to </p>
<p>achieving the UK’s “End State” for Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Achieving a “significant change” in the “behaviour and posture” of the current </p>
<p>regime, “with respect to WMD, and other UNSCRs, <b>to prevent conflict</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the regime failed “to change its behaviour voluntarily”, then it would “be </p>
<p><b>compelled to change its posture</b> through the application of force”. If that </p>
<p>resulted in regime change it would be “an unsought, but added benefit”.</p>
<p><b>730. </b> That was underpinned by a revised section on the principles for the campaign, </p>
<p>which stated that the UK was “executing a strategic <b>Force on Mind</b> campaign” in which </p>
<p>influence was “targeted against decision makers and their will to fight”. During a conflict </p>
<p>prevention phase, that was “the key instrument of military power”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The crisis had reached the point where “constant coercive pressure” was </p>
<p>“needed to keep up forward momentum”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Overt Force Generation and Force Preparation activities” were “strategic </p>
<p>elements” in applying pressure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “clear and unified declaration of intent” from “a wide and solid coalition” would </p>
<p>deliver the most powerful message to Saddam Hussein. </p>

<p><b>731. </b> Other additions to the previous draft included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The section on potential UK strategic objectives in the 4 September draft was </p>
<p>replaced by draft campaign objectives produced by the Cabinet Office, which </p>
<p>are addressed in Section 6.4. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As well as assisting the US to secure Iraq’s oil infrastructure and production </p>
<p>facilities, the section on “Potential UK Military Strategic Objectives” identified </p>
<p>three additional tasks in the event of conflict:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>ensuring that Israel’s security was not threatened by Iraqi action;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>ensuring Iraqi sovereignty post&#8209;conflict; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>minimising damage to Iraqi infrastructure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Draft objectives for a northern option, which were being considered by the </p>
<p>Pentagon, were set out for the first time. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The elements of an information campaign.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A statement that the northern option was “only viable if Turkey can be delivered”. </p>
<p>There was “a lack of clarity in the US” about whether that was “achievable </p>
<p>within current planning timelines”. The need for “accurate assessments of likely </p>
<p>success in delivering key states for the coalition (especially Turkey)” was one of </p>
<p>the “conditions” for a “winning concept”. A northern option was seen by the UK </p>
<p>as strategically “fundamental” but was not seen as “operationally” fundamental </p>
<p>by CENTCOM.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A much expanded section on post&#8209;conflict planning.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The identification of a possible scenario in which Saddam attempted “to distract </p>
<p>coalition forces by a deliberate and sustained attack in the North, using all </p>
<p>methods available to him (including CBW)”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An updated analysis of the US plan and whether it constituted a winning </p>
<p>concept, including that a division&#8209;size force would be needed for the North; </p>
<p>but the tasks still required “<b>more clarification</b>”. EUCOM planning was “<b>much </b></p>
<p><b>further behind</b>” than CENTCOM planning for the South and was “<b>still </b></p>
<p><b>constrained</b>” by the “<b>inability to properly engage with Turkey</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN route and the timetable for UN inspections might “<b>not be compatible</b>” </p>
<p>with the US end state, which was focused primarily on regime change. That </p>
<p>was “<b>a potential fault line in the UK/US relationship”</b>. The UK might face a </p>
<p>“<b>choice of following the US or the UN route</b>”.</p>

<p><b>Concerns about Turkey</b></p>
<p>The JIC Assessment, ‘Iraq: Regional Attitudes’, issued on 19 April 2002, addressed </p>
<p>regional attitudes to military action and how much support or opposition they might offer </p>
<p>(see Section 3.3).</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> It stated that “<b>Turkey</b>, as a NATO ally, would probably provide basing </p>
<p>if asked, despite its reservations, […].” </p>
<p>The FCO recognised that there could be difficulties with Turkey. In an internal minute of </p>
<p>30 July 2002, Mr Ricketts wrote:</p>
<p>“Turkey is a special case. Would have to give active support for military operation, </p>
<p>even if only the use of the airfields. Quite possibly a much more direct role. But the </p>
<p>timing is exceptionally difficult: no Government until after 3 November. The Cyprus </p>
<p>talks quite likely to fail, leading to a major train wreck with the EU at Copenhagen </p>
<p>[EU Summit in December 2002]. The Turks are bound to use their strategic </p>
<p>importance on Iraq as leverage. The UK cannot deliver what the Turks will want </p>
<p>from the EU … The US … will have to work the Turkey case hard: it cannot be left to </p>
<p>the Brits.”</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the request of the MOD, the JIC reconsidered the judgements in its 19 April<i> </i></p>
<p>Assessment on 5 August 2002.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> That is addressed in Section 3.4.</p>
<p>In relation to Turkey, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“Turkey would be willing to provide basing for a US&#8209;led attack on Iraq.” </p>
<p>The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The Turkish Government has been reluctant to see an attack on Iraq. […] The exact </p>
<p>extent of this Turkish help would have to be negotiated. Turkey would demand to be </p>
<p>kept fully informed of US planning […]”</p>
<p>The FCO and Mr Peter Westmacott, British Ambassador to Turkey, exchanged views on </p>
<p>whether or not the UK should engage in direct talks with Turkey.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Bowen wrote to Sir David Manning: </p>
<p>“We are not committed to the northern option and our early participation in talks with </p>
<p>the Turks may give the wrong impression.”</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David replied that he strongly agreed.</p>

<p><b>The MOD request to offer ground forces </b></p>
<p><b>732.  The offer of Package 2 was not enough to address growing MOD concerns </b></p>
<p><b>that the caveats on Package 3 were leading the US to discount the contribution </b></p>
<p><b>in its planning, closing off the option for UK ground forces to participate in the </b></p>
<p><b>combat phase.</b></p>
<p><b>733.  Concerns were expressed at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 2 October </b></p>
<p><b>about the risk of irreparable damage to US/UK relations as a result of continuing </b></p>
<p><b>uncertainty about a UK land contribution. </b></p>
<p><b>734.  Adm Boyce was clear that should not be allowed to happen.</b></p>
<p><b>735.  The UK’s involvement post&#8209;conflict might be more onerous than </b></p>
<p><b>war&#8209;fighting.</b></p>
<p><b>736.  Elements of the “Force on Mind” strategy were still being discussed.</b></p>
<p><b>737. </b> On 30 September, Lt Gen Reith provided an “illustrative critical decision and event </p>
<p>matrix on timings”, to provide a critical path for deploying Packages 2 and 3.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> Timings </p>
<p>within the matrix were “illustrative only”. That included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decisions in the week beginning 7 October to begin the UOR process for priority </p>
<p>equipments, nomination of a National Contingent Commander (NCC), and a </p>
<p>decision on UK participation in Exercise Internal Look;</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>beginning overt preparations, including call&#8209;up of Reserves, by the end of </p>
<p>October; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deploying the Amphibious Ready Group (ARG) and beginning pre&#8209;deployment </p>
<p>training for the land component by the end of November.</p>
<p><b>738. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that the timelines assumed a US Presidential decision, on </p>
<p>whether to take military action, on 6 January 2003. He also stated that it was anticipated </p>
<p>that UN inspectors would begin work in mid&#8209;December, and were required to submit </p>
<p>an initial report two months later. That “could offer the US a trigger to begin operations” </p>
<p>which “could come forward” if a “strongly worded” resolution was adopted. </p>
<p><b>739. </b> Lt Gen Reith separately sought endorsement of the command and control (C2) </p>
<p>arrangements for potential operations in Iraq and the nomination of the individuals </p>
<p>who would potentially fill key posts in time for them to participate in Exercise Internal </p>
<p>Look.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> That included the identification of the UK NCC, who would be collocated with </p>
<p>CENTCOM’s Forward HQ in Qatar. </p>

<p>287</p>
<p><b>740. </b> Lt Gen Reith also advised that, while it was “too early to judge” how Phase IV </p>
<p>operations would be structured, it was “likely” that it would be “conducted under US </p>
<p>leadership, with territorial sectors allocated to national or multi&#8209;national formations, </p>
<p>perhaps akin to the Balkans model”. The UK could be asked “to provide formation[s] </p>
<p>such as HQ ARRC, a UK Div HQ, or UKAMPHIBFOR [UK Amphibious Force] to oversee </p>
<p>national or multi&#8209;national 1* formations”.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> The Chiefs of Staff met on 2 October to discuss Iraq planning.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>742. </b> Adm Boyce identified 15 October as a critical date for decisions, linked to whether </p>
<p>or not to participate in Exercise Internal Look, when the “fudge option” would no longer </p>
<p>be available. Some decisions might be delayed until the end of October, but that was an </p>
<p>“absolute end stop”. </p>
<p><b>743. </b> The Chiefs of Staff “required a sitrep” which set out the key issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Turkey’s position and its implications;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an appraisal of whether the northern option was essential and the UK’s </p>
<p>participation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an explanation of the UK’s “coercive strategy and the Force on Mind gambit”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “need to maintain the impetus on UNSCRs [UN Security Council resolutions] </p>
<p>using optimal, visible measures balanced against the resulting adverse PR”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “unpredictable consequences” that might arise from the “Saddam factor”, </p>
<p>including his reaction to the spikes in US military activity and response options;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Special Forces options; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the linkage between CENTCOM’s Exercise Internal Look and UK force planning.</p>
<p><b>744. </b> The minutes recorded:</p>
<p>“Keeping options open would be difficult if relations with the US, including those </p>
<p>outside military circles, were not to suffer irreparably as a consequence and </p>
<p>CDS was adamant that this should be avoided if at all possible. There were also </p>
<p>implications for Force on Mind if the UK was perceived to be weakening its stance. </p>
<p>Phase IV considerations needed to be clearly understood, given that the inevitable </p>
<p>UK involvement might result in an even greater burden than war&#8209;fighting per se.” </p>
<p><b>745. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Advice should be sent to Mr Hoon by 11 October.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith should provide a paper “on land component options other than the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith’s recommendations on the command and control structures for </p>
<p>potential operations in Iraq and preparations for Exercise Internal Look.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a requirement to identify UK headquarters that might be required to </p>
<p>contribute to “follow on” operations.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> The first paper that the MOD had been able to find on land options other than the </p>
<p>northern option was produced by Lt Gen Reith on 18 November. That is addressed later </p>
<p>in this Section.</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Mr Drummond reported to Sir David Manning that the discussion at the Chiefs of </p>
<p>Staff meeting had addressed the:</p>
<p>“… importance of ‘force on mind’ as part of the campaign. The US was already using </p>
<p>this tactic to good effect. We were not yet, because no decisions have been taken </p>
<p>about the extent of our engagement in a possible military campaign. I said that the </p>
<p>attention was focused on getting the right UNSCR, which would be the priority for </p>
<p>the next few days.”</p>
<p>303</p>
<p><b>748. </b> Mr Drummond also reported that there was:</p>
<p>“A strong wish to do the northern Option 3. The military judgement was that this </p>
<p>should be tactically possible. Not to do it would damage our relations with the US </p>
<p>and might leave us with the even more onerous task of peacekeeping (Option 4). </p>
<p>I rehearsed the Prime Minister’s view that Option 2 would be a very substantial </p>
<p>contribution.” </p>
<p><b>749. </b> There was “acceptance” that the US should lead on “persuading” Turkey, but a </p>
<p>wish that the UK would be able “to engage early” if the northern option was pursued. </p>
<p>There had been a “suggestion” that the US might be planning a northern option </p>
<p>without the UK; and that Turkey might find the presence of British troops “difficult </p>
<p>to contemplate”.</p>
<p><b>750.  On the basis of their perception of the US timetable, the Chiefs of Staff </b></p>
<p><b>agreed on 9 October to seek a non&#8209;public Ministerial decision in principle to offer </b></p>
<p><b>Package 3 to the US, ideally by 21 October.</b></p>
<p><b>751.  The Chiefs of Staff recognised that UK withdrawal after Exercise Internal </b></p>
<p><b>Look would have unpalatable diplomatic consequences.</b></p>
<p><b>752. </b> On 8 October, Brigadier William Rollo, a member of Maj Gen Fry’s staff, reported </p>
<p>to Adm Boyce’s Private Office that the US was likely to deploy its 4th Infantry Division </p>
<p>in the North, “irrespective of subsequent UK decisions”.</p>

<p>289</p>
<p><b>753. </b> Draft advice to Mr Hoon was discussed at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on </p>
<p>9 October.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>754. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were informed that there seemed to be “increasing flexibility” </p>
<p>in Washington over the timing of military activity and that “the weather would not be a </p>
<p>limiting factor”. That might affect UK decision&#8209;making.</p>
<p><b>755. </b> Ministers “should be left in no doubt” that the northern option was a “fundamental </p>
<p>part of US planning”. From the Army’s “perspective, Package 3 would guarantee </p>
<p>long&#8209;term strategic influence with the US”. </p>
<p><b>756. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Squire, Chief of the Air Staff, commented that </p>
<p>Package 2 “did not entail a loss of influence”, and sought “visibility of fallback options </p>
<p>in the South”. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> In the context of predicted US discussions with Turkey on 21 October and </p>
<p>reported indications from US military contacts that planning for one scenario whereby </p>
<p>the US acted with the UK and another where it acted alone was “rapidly becoming </p>
<p>untenable”, the Chiefs of Staff considered that:</p>
<p>“Ministers needed to be advised that a non&#8209;public ‘decision in principle’ to contribute </p>
<p>was required, ideally by 21 October. In practice, because of the unpalatable </p>
<p>diplomatic consequences of the UK’s withdrawal after the completion of Ex[ercise] </p>
<p>Internal Look … 15 Oct[ober] was also a key date.” </p>
<p><b>758. </b> Lt Gen Reith “observed that a meaningful discussion about, or leverage on, US </p>
<p>planning with Gen Franks would not be possible until a decision (in principle) regarding </p>
<p>the UK contribution had been made.” </p>
<p><b>759. </b> In addition, to maintain the UK’s options, a call&#8209;out of some Reserves by the end </p>
<p>of October might be required. That and visible action on UORs “would contribute to the </p>
<p>‘force on mind’ campaign”. A successful coercion strategy was “key to the process”.</p>
<p><b>760. </b> The minutes also record the view that “it would be important to guard against the </p>
<p>perception in the US that the UK’s decision was a matter of legitimacy as opposed to a </p>
<p>problem with mobilisation and public perception”. </p>
<p><b>761. </b> The Chiefs of Staff directed that the advice to Mr Hoon should be amended to </p>
<p>reflect the discussion, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the timing of US discussions with Turkey;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “decision in principle” on Package 3; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>290</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Lt Gen Reith was also asked to provide a paper considering southern options for </p>
<p>UK involvement if Turkey denied the northern option. </p>
<p><b>763. </b> Reporting on the meeting to Sir David Manning, Mr Bowen wrote:</p>
<p>“The military are pressing for a decision on whether the UK should be offering, </p>
<p>with caveats, Package 3 … The argument for doing so is that the Americans now </p>
<p>need to know in principle whether they should plan on our participation and that … </p>
<p>our acceptability as a major player in the North needs to be broached early with </p>
<p>the Turks.</p>
<p>“The conclusion … was that the MOD should seek a positive decision in principle … </p>
<p>[that] would expose to the US … the time lag … between a decision to deploy and </p>
<p>deployment on the ground. The key decision to proceed in practice would be taken </p>
<p>later …”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>764. </b> Mr Bowen added that the MOD had underlined:</p>
<p>“… that diplomacy ought to be backed by the threat of the use of force. In the </p>
<p>game of coercion, military planning and preparation can have a beneficial effect in </p>
<p>achieving a peaceful outcome. Moreover, in case the diplomatic track is brought </p>
<p>to a halt, we should endeavour to reduce the gap between that point and the </p>
<p>enforcement action we threaten. This would involve us being more up&#8209;beat about </p>
<p>our contingency planning, without moving into war&#8209;mongering mode.”</p>
<p><b>765. </b> Mr Bowen also wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A decision in principle in favour of Package 3 would help the UK to influence US </p>
<p>thinking to a greater extent than had been possible up to that point, “especially </p>
<p>in relation to the aftermath of any military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In “making a decision in principle, without final commitment, we would stress </p>
<p>that this reflected the UK political situation and was not specifically linked to </p>
<p>authorisation through the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While it could be argued that agreeing in principle to provide Package 3 was </p>
<p>“no different” from the position on Packages 1 and 2, there was “no doubt” </p>
<p>that a commitment to deploy land forces was “a different matter from </p>
<p>deployments in the air or at sea”.</p>
<p><b>766. </b> The MOD would be writing to No.10, and Mr Hoon was seeking a meeting with </p>
<p>Mr Blair on 17 October to discuss the issue. </p>

<p><b>768.  Adm Boyce agreed with Gen Franks on 10 October that planning should </b></p>
<p><b>proceed on the assumption that Package 3 would be available.</b></p>
<p><b>769. </b> Adm Boyce spoke to Gen Franks on 10 October, stressing that Package 2 was </p>
<p>“not an insignificant contribution”.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> The option of a UK operation in the South was being </p>
<p>looked at if the northern option “fell away”.</p>
<p><b>770. </b> Gen Franks observed that a deployment in the South would be “very sequential </p>
<p>because of the narrow entry front”. </p>
<p><b>771. </b> Adm Boyce told Gen Franks that the way ahead on Package 3 was “too close </p>
<p>to call”. In relation to the difficulties that posed for US planning, Adm Boyce was told </p>
<p>that it was easier for the US to plan on having Package 3 rather than not having it. </p>
<p>They agreed that “interests would be best served” by planning on the assumption that </p>
<p>Package 3 would be available.</p>
<p><b>772.  The arguments in favour of offering Package 3 to the US and for immediate </b></p>
<p><b>clarification of the UK’s position were set out in advice for Mr Hoon, agreed by </b></p>
<p><b>Adm Boyce, on 11 October.</b></p>
<p><b>773. </b> The need for a decision on the potential UK contribution to any US&#8209;led action </p>
<p>against Iraq was set out in an urgent minute to Mr Hoon, from Mr David Johnson, Head </p>
<p>of a newly created Iraq Secretariat in the MOD,</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> on 11 October.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>774. </b> Mr Hoon was invited to note the increasing difficulty of maintaining the feasibility of </p>
<p>Package 3 as long as its status was “unconfirmed”. He was asked to either rule it out or </p>
<p>move it to the same status as Package 2. </p>
<p><b>775. </b> Mr Johnson told Mr Hoon that the US needed to know where the UK stood very </p>
<p>soon:</p>
<p>“In addition to pressure from US planners, it is in our interests to be clearer about </p>
<p>our level of engagement, against the background of a series of key planning events </p>
<p>from mid&#8209;October onwards.” </p>
<p><b>776. </b> Mr Johnson advised that the UN position was “a key element of the continuing </p>
<p>strategic uncertainty”. The UN inspections team was not expected to be fully operational </p>
<p>before mid&#8209;February, but Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation “could occur at any point”, including </p>
<p>a refusal to accept the UN resolution. The “most likely scenario” was that “potential </p>
<p>triggers for military action” were “moving to the right” but, “both the need to be </p>
<p>ready for the worst case and the strategy of conflict prevention” pointed in the same </p>
<p>direction: “continuing and visible military preparations”. The main focus of US planning </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>was “preparation to allow the commencement of offensive action in January (with </p>
<p>contingency planning for an earlier start should that prove necessary)”.</p>
<p><b>777. </b> Mr Johnson stated that the northern option was: </p>
<p>“… now seen as fundamental by US military planners, both in the Pentagon and in </p>
<p>CENTCOM. There is an important role for the UK to play if we so wish. But if we </p>
<p>decide not to play this role, the US will have to mobilise other US forces … The </p>
<p>caveats we have so far attached to Package 3 have thus resulted in the US having </p>
<p>to work on two separate plans, compounding what is already a complex process </p>
<p>… CENTCOM … need a clear statement of the UK commitment, within the overall </p>
<p>understanding that all the packages are subject to a general political caveat.” </p>
<p><b>778. </b> Mr Johnson advised that the need for the UK to clarify its position “will become </p>
<p>increasingly acute”; and that: </p>
<p>“From a purely national perspective, the lead&#8209;times for putting Package 2 and </p>
<p>Package 3 in place mean that some publicly visible decisions … need to be taken </p>
<p>well in advance of any deployment … But we do need to be prepared to take </p>
<p>these decisions.” </p>
<p><b>779. </b> Gen Franks had told the UK that he would continue to run two plans “to preserve </p>
<p>the possibility of incorporating Package 3”. But the longer the US worked on that basis </p>
<p>“the more disgruntled they will be if we subsequently rule Package 3 out”. </p>
<p><b>780. </b> Mr Hoon was given details of the decisions needed on both Packages 2 and 3 </p>
<p>and their costs. Package 2, which included a Commando Group based in HMS Ocean, </p>
<p>would cost some £464m&#8209;500m, excluding movement costs, ammunition and other </p>
<p>consumables, and post&#8209;operational recuperation. On the same basis, Package 3 was </p>
<p>estimated to cost an additional £508m. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> Mr Johnson advised Mr Hoon that, in coming to a decision, Ministers would “need </p>
<p>to take into account”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The impact of visible decisions. In addition to their role in ensuring the viability </p>
<p>of a UK contribution: “Overt preparations on the scale of Package 3 may make </p>
<p>an impact on Saddam’s perception of the seriousness of Coalition intent … </p>
<p>They might also encourage key figures in the Iraqi regime to reflect further on </p>
<p>whether their best interests continue to be served by Saddam’s leadership … </p>
<p>these measures would reinforce the coercive ‘force on mind’ approach that has </p>
<p>already borne fruit”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cost. The costs of either package would be significant – Package 2 “could be </p>
<p>not far short of £1bn”; Packages 2 and 3 together “could be between £1.5bn </p>
<p>and £2bn”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US expectations. The MOD had been “careful to manage” US expectations </p>
<p>but a decision to rule out Package 3 would “inevitably disappoint” the US, </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>with “knock&#8209;on effects”, which the UK would need to work hard to minimise. </p>
<p>A decision to rule out Package 3 would need to be taken “very soon”. </p>
<p>Adm Boyce recommended that, “unless a definite decision is taken to say </p>
<p>‘no’ now to Package 3, we must commit appropriate effort to [Exercise] </p>
<p>Internal Look”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Burden&#8209;sharing. Package 2 could “justifiably” be presented as a “substantial </p>
<p>contribution” but Package 3 would be “significantly more substantial” and “a vivid </p>
<p>sign of a willingness to share the risks”. The shortcomings in the US tactical </p>
<p>plan for the northern option “could be resolved if we were fully able to engage </p>
<p>in planning and to flex resources to make it work”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Impact on readiness and capability for other tasks. Either package would </p>
<p>impinge on the UK’s ability to respond to contingency operations, but Iraq </p>
<p>was “the central issue” and there might be “a trade&#8209;off between committing </p>
<p>to a military campaign and committing to an enduring follow&#8209;up operation”. </p>
<p>A six&#8209;month war&#8209;fighting operation was “consistent with the Defence </p>
<p>Planning Assumptions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Aftermath management and the long term. US thinking on the “Day After” </p>
<p>was “under&#8209;developed at present”, but there was “likely to be a need for a </p>
<p>substantial, potentially long&#8209;enduring commitment of forces. Assuming that </p>
<p>military action had taken place under a UN umbrella, it is likely that the US </p>
<p>would look to Allies and the UK to play a major role in this, perhaps including </p>
<p>providing a framework capability through the ARRC. We clearly have an interest </p>
<p>in minimising the risk of a long lasting commitment … in a part of the world that </p>
<p>will not be retention&#8209;positive for our personnel: in terms of Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions, a … medium scale PSO [peace support operation] in Iraq would </p>
<p>only be manageable if our commitments elsewhere … were capped at small </p>
<p>scale. The more substantial our contribution to military action in the first place, </p>
<p>the more plausibly we will be able to argue that we have done our bit.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Turkey. Turkey’s attitude to UK forces might “remain uncertain for some time”. </p>
<p>It was “possible that some or all of Package 3 might be able to play a role in the </p>
<p>South (although space constraints might [have an] impact on timing)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Wider context. In the context of securing influence, the MOD had “been taking </p>
<p>soundings over what gives us influence over US campaign planning”. It was </p>
<p>“clear that sharing risk – political and military” was “crucial to having a voice in </p>
<p>how a military operation” was planned, and it also provided “a locus to influence </p>
<p>the wider overall campaign”. There was “thus a longer&#8209;term and strategic </p>
<p>dimension to the issue of Package 3: not joining will reduce the influence we </p>
<p>have over planning”, including a change in the US “perceptions of the UK as </p>
<p>a partner longer&#8209;term fostering a tendency to see us as a specialist in Peace </p>
<p>Support Operations rather than a war&#8209;fighting ally, with potential knock&#8209;on </p>
<p>effects on other areas of close bilateral cooperation (intelligence, nuclear, </p>
<p>missile defence, equipment and network&#8209;centric capability, etc)”. Contributing </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>Package 3 would mean that the UK Government would “be well placed to be </p>
<p>more vigorous in pressing its views especially on better regional handling and </p>
<p>‘day after’ planning”. If those components were not properly planned, a military </p>
<p>operation might “not offer a worthwhile return”. The UK “could and should offer </p>
<p>a contribution on the understanding that these dimensions must be better </p>
<p>addressed”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Army morale. “If the Army does not participate in the biggest combat operation </p>
<p>for over a decade, and particularly if it is subsequently committed to a </p>
<p>potentially enduring aftermath task, this may foster a perception that the Army </p>
<p>is no longer regarded as a war&#8209;fighting force (particularly if they are deployed </p>
<p>on Op FRESCO duties) and may have knock&#8209;on effects on recruitment and </p>
<p>retention. It will clearly present a leadership challenge. This should not be a </p>
<p>critical factor in reaching decisions … but it is an issue which the Secretary of </p>
<p>State will wish to have in mind.”</p>
<p><b>782. </b> Mr Johnson advised Mr Hoon that:</p>
<p>“A firm commitment in principle to Package 3 should give us better involvement in </p>
<p>US thinking, especially in Washington, about the most realistic timings for military </p>
<p>action. We may find that we have more time … but this is only likely to emerge </p>
<p>progressively if at all. So if Ministers wished to place any caveats on the timescales </p>
<p>or circumstances in which they are prepared to take the subsidiary decisions, we </p>
<p>would have to make these clear to the US at the outset.” </p>
<p><b>783. </b> There would be:</p>
<p>“… a case for presenting visible deployment decisions more assertively, arguing that </p>
<p>they are an essential ingredient of a successful coercive strategy. This might not </p>
<p>persuade journalists to present them as anything other than a ‘countdown to war’. </p>
<p>But we would be less vulnerable to accusations of proceeding to war by stealth …”</p>

<p>a draft letter to Mr Alan Milburn, the Health Secretary, on the impact on the </p>
<p>National Health Service.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p><b>787. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 15 October, seeking a decision that week on whether </p>
<p>to tell the US they could assume a UK land contribution in addition to the air, maritime </p>
<p>and Special Forces package already offered for planning purposes.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> In any event, </p>
<p>there would be a need to be more robust in public about the need for essential military </p>
<p>preparation. </p>
<p><b>788. </b> In the context of the potential US timetable, and the need to maintain pressure on </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, Mr Hoon added:</p>
<p>“Indeed, Saddam has conceded ground so far only because diplomacy has been </p>
<p>backed by the credible threat of force. We must maintain and reinforce this effect.”</p>
<p><b>789. </b> The reasons for urgency included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a week&#8209;long CENTCOM conference, which started that day, during which the </p>
<p>US military wanted to finalise their plans; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>discussions with Turkey; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to start visible preparations, including the call&#8209;up of Reserves.</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Mr Hoon told Mr Blair that either Package 2 or Package 3 “would be a viable </p>
<p>military contribution”, but in describing the Packages, Mr Hoon added:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of visible “boots on the ground” in Package 2 would be “small”, </p>
<p>which “could lead to some criticism here and elsewhere that UK support for </p>
<p>the operation was half&#8209;hearted. The US may be disappointed that we are not </p>
<p>offering more; the likely political reaction is more difficult to judge …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 3 would provide a “major element of the northern line of attack”, which </p>
<p>was judged “essential”. Without UK land forces, the US would have to redeploy </p>
<p>its forces from the South. UK forces “could therefore help both to shorten the </p>
<p>campaign and secure a more decisive outcome”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Package 3 “would have more impact” and “might provide a framework for </p>
<p>integrating elements from other countries into a land force”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There was “likely to be a substantial and continuing post&#8209;conflict stabilisation task </p>
<p>in Iraq”. If the UK did not contribute Package 3, it might be “more vulnerable to a </p>
<p>US request to provide a substantial force for this potentially open&#8209;ended task”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>791. </b> Mr Hoon wrote:</p>
<p>“A critical – and the least quantifiable – factor in weighing the two packages must </p>
<p>be the impact on our strategic relationship with the US. In principle, both packages </p>
<p>could strengthen that relationship: Package 2 alone should easily surpass any other </p>
<p>conceivable non&#8209;US contribution, except perhaps that of Turkey.”</p>
<p><b>792. </b> Mr Hoon stated that, while he had “sought to dampen” Secretary Rumsfeld’s </p>
<p>expectations of any sizeable land contribution, there might be disappointment that the </p>
<p>UK was “not prepared to put significant numbers of ground troops in harm’s way”. That </p>
<p>might translate into a cooler view towards our privileged links. </p>
<p><b>793. </b> Mr Hoon added:</p>
<p>“A further factor which cannot be entirely discounted is the negative reaction of many </p>
<p>of our own military personnel – particularly in the Army – if we do not provide a land </p>
<p>contribution. This could find its way into the media which would be quick to draw </p>
<p>unfavourable comparisons between our contribution to this campaign and the Gulf </p>
<p>Conflict in 1990/91.”</p>
<p><b>794. </b> Mr Hoon stated that an offer of Package 3 “must be subject to conditions”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would be dependent on US help to secure Turkey’s agreement to the </p>
<p>UK deployment.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “must be fully involved in developing the final plan on which a final </p>
<p>decision to deploy would be based”.</p>

<p><b>800.  Sir David Manning’s private advice to Mr Blair expressed scepticism about </b></p>
<p><b>a number of the arguments in Mr Hoon’s minute. </b></p>
<p><b>801. </b> Sir David Manning made a number of comments expressing scepticism about </p>
<p>some of the arguments employed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In response to the argument that overt preparations would reinforce a strategy </p>
<p>of coercion, Sir David wrote: “The opposite is also possible i.e. Saddam will </p>
<p>conclude that we are interested only in [war]; he will therefore not co&#8209;operate.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US expectations of UK ground troops had been “fuelled because MOD almost </p>
<p>certainly aroused great expectations early on – without political authority”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir David questioned whether the MOD had carefully managed US expectations, </p>
<p>writing: “Have we? US only know about Package 3 because we talked it up.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would be “vulnerable” to a request for substantial forces post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>whether it provided Package 3 or not.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir David did not “buy” the MOD argument that failure to offer Package 3 would </p>
<p>change the US perception of the UK as a long&#8209;term partner.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce was “worried” about managing the impact on army morale if it did </p>
<p>not participate in combat operations.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>802. </b> In addition, Sir David provided detailed advice for the Prime Minister on </p>
<p>16 October, flagging concerns about whether the assumptions underpinning the </p>
<p>package were robust, and about domestic handling issues.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>803. </b> Sir David summarised the key arguments in favour of Package 3 as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be a strong signal of our intent and would increase the pressure </p>
<p>on Saddam;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is what the US is hoping for;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would buy us influence in the conduct of the military campaign against Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US gratitude would make Washington correspondingly more inclined to be </p>
<p>generous to us in other areas …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would reduce the risk that we would be expected to contribute large numbers </p>
<p>of troops to help administer Iraq after hostilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The British Army would like it; and would be correspondingly demoralised if no </p>
<p>use were made of their war&#8209;fighting capability.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>804. </b> Sir David commented that he thought some of those arguments were “pretty </p>
<p>dubious”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “not clear” whether Saddam Hussein would be much affected by signals </p>
<p>of British military intent; “it was US intent that bothered him”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The problem of US expectations on Package 3 might have been </p>
<p>“self&#8209;generated”. His “guess” was that the UK military had “been pretty forward </p>
<p>leaning in their contacts with their US opposite numbers”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He doubted that the UK “would have much say in the management of the </p>
<p>military campaign”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He was “not much persuaded by the argument about US gratitude: it should not </p>
<p>be a key factor in our decision”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He was “not much persuaded either, that if we help with the war&#8209;fighting, </p>
<p>we shall be spared the post&#8209;conflict washing up. It didn’t work like that in </p>
<p>Afghanistan. Experience shows that once you are in, you’re in deep, without </p>
<p>queues of grateful countries waiting to take over when the shooting stops.”<b> </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Army morale would have to be managed: we needn’t fight every war.” </p>
<p><b>805. </b> Sir David suggested that Mr Blair should explore with Mr Hoon:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What had changed since the summer when Mr Blair had been advised that the </p>
<p>UK could not deploy Package 3, and whether the new assumptions were “really </p>
<p>safe and robust”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether the UK could “bank on Turkish assurances given to the US about </p>
<p>access, bases and supply”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether the UK would be able to fight in a “CBW environment”, and “in summer </p>
<p>temperatures if necessary”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether it made sense to commit the UK so heavily to Iraq and how the UK </p>
<p>would respond to a sudden crisis elsewhere?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether Package 3 was affordable?</p>
<p><b>806. </b> Sir David concluded: </p>
<p>“In sum, the MOD paper is special pleading for Package 3. You [Mr Blair] may want </p>
<p>to go this route to signal your determination; and for US solidarity reasons. But there </p>
<p>are risks and difficulties that need to be thoroughly explored; and there will be costs </p>
<p>which are only sketchily dealt with here – and which might balloon. </p>
<p>“Personally, I doubt whether there is a strong military case for Package 3. The US </p>
<p>would like us along, but could certainly do the job without UK land forces. This is a </p>
<p>political call.”</p>

<p><b>807. </b> Mr Blair responded: “This is a v. tough call”; and that he would “need to speak to </p>
<p>the senior military in detail” before he committed to Package 3.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>808. </b> Asked about his comments on army morale, Sir David Manning explained, to </p>
<p>the Inquiry that he thought morale should not be a reason for participating in a land </p>
<p>invasion.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>THE FCO PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p><b>809.  The FCO advised Mr Straw to question some of Mr Hoon’s arguments. </b></p>
<p><b>810. </b> Mr Edward Oakden, Head of FCO Security Policy Department, advised Mr Straw </p>
<p>to question whether the decision really had to be made that week.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>811. </b> Mr Oakden wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Without a UN resolution preparations would look like UK determination to pursue </p>
<p>the military option, “instead of backing the diplomatic route with a credible threat </p>
<p>of force” and that it would be worth drawing out the MOD’s thinking.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Postponing the decision until a UN Security Council resolution had been agreed </p>
<p>seemed “likely to make a real difference to how a move to military preparations </p>
<p>would be viewed, both domestically and internationally”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Third countries, including Turkey, would be unwilling to support preparation or </p>
<p>participation until a legal basis was found.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Once the forces were deployed, there would be no going back until Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was disarmed: “Pulling out without achieving this would cause severe </p>
<p>strains with the US and serious harm to UK credibility. So the prospect is for a </p>
<p>longish haul, with the UN inspectors likely to take some time to find what will be </p>
<p>well&#8209;concealed WMD. We should look very hard before our first public leap.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Many senior Turks still [believed that] the UK” had “a secret agenda to create </p>
<p>a Kurdish homeland in Northern Iraq”; and memories of the UK’s efforts to </p>
<p>dismember Turkey in the 1920s remained “surprisingly vivid”. The UK should </p>
<p>let the US conduct negotiations with Turkey.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD’s suggestion that the UK could trade a more active role in fighting </p>
<p>for “a smaller military role during reconstruction” seemed “optimistic”: “On the </p>
<p>contrary, if we have fought without international legal sanction, we could be left </p>
<p>on our own with the US.” </p>
<p><b>812. </b> Mr Oakden concluded that the MOD had rightly highlighted real concern about </p>
<p>longer&#8209;term damage to the US/UK relationship “if for the first time in recent memory the </p>
<p>UK decides not to join the US on the ground”, or if it complicated US military planning </p>
<p>and put US timelines at risk. But he questioned whether that concern was at the military, </p>

<p>“rather than the political level”. He suggested further talks with the US at a senior </p>
<p>political level “if the Chiefs judge there is a real danger of US disaffection”.</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Mr Westmacott reported on 16 October that he had been told by a senior Turkish </p>
<p>official that Turkey assumed that, if the UK decided it wanted to join the US in making </p>
<p>military deployments in or through Turkey in support of a UN resolution, it would let </p>
<p>Turkey know in good time.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p> Without Security Council authorisation, it was “quite </p>
<p>possible” that Turkey would refuse to co&#8209;operate. Constitutionally the Turkish Parliament </p>
<p>had to give its consent, and the constitution stated that it could only do so in the context </p>
<p>of international legitimacy.</p>
<p><b>US Congressional authorisation for the use of force</b></p>
<p>On 10 and 11 October, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed a joint </p>
<p>resolution authorising the use of military force against Iraq.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p>Signing the joint resolution on 16 October, President Bush stated that it symbolised the </p>
<p>united purpose of the nation and expressed the considered judgement of Congress.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Congress had authorised the use of force but he had not ordered that use, and he hoped </p>
<p>that would not become necessary. </p>

<p>324</p>
<p><b>The UK’s draft strategic objectives </b></p>
<p>The preliminary objective for UK policy in Iraq agreed by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon in May, </p>
<p>and recorded in Mr Hoon’s minute to Mr Blair of 31 May 2002 (see Section 3.3), was </p>
<p>revised in October.</p>
<p>Mr Bowen sent Sir David Manning draft strategic policy objectives for Iraq on 4 October, </p>
<p>explaining that “Whitehall would find it helpful” to agree objectives “for the present phase </p>
<p>of activity” and, “in particular, it would help us in formulating an information strategy”.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Cabinet Office draft stated that the UK’s prime objective was: </p>
<p>“… to rid Iraq of its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their associated </p>
<p>programmes and means of delivery, including prohibited ballistic missiles (BM) … in </p>
<p>accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions … an expression of the </p>
<p>will of the international community, with which Iraq has persistently failed to comply, </p>
<p>thereby perpetuating the threat to international peace and security.”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Other objectives included the desired end&#8209;state for Iraq, to which the words “and providing </p>
<p>effective and representative government for its own people” had been added to the text </p>
<p>agreed by Mr Straw and Mr Hoon earlier in the year. </p>

<p>The draft also identified the immediate priorities for the UK, including that continuing </p>
<p>to “make military plans and preparations in case military action” was required to “force </p>
<p>compliance with UNSCRs”.</p>
<p>Mr Lee sent a copy of the draft to Mr Hoon’s Private Office, commenting that, while the </p>
<p>text was “helpful”, it did not “go far enough in providing direction for current military activity </p>
<p>and an information strategy”.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> Mr Lee did not expect the draft to move forward until there </p>
<p>was a clear UN position.</p>
<p>Sir David Manning informed members of the Ministerial Committee on Defence and </p>
<p>Overseas Policy on 22 October that Mr Blair had agreed draft UK strategic objectives </p>
<p>for Iraq. </p>
<p>The draft objectives agreed by Mr Blair were unchanged from those proposed by </p>
<p>Mr Bowen on 4 October.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p>The draft objectives underpinned subsequent policy statements both to explain the UK’s </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Mr Blair stated that Iraq would continue to be discussed in Cabinet, “including </p>
<p>in due time the military options”. The Government must “keep its options open in </p>
<p>responding to future developments” after a resolution was achieved. </p>
<p><b>837. </b> The negotiations on the draft resolution are addressed in Section 3.5. </p>
<p>MOD CONCERNS ABOUT THE US PERSPECTIVE</p>
<p><b>838.  The MOD continued to argue that keeping open the option of a land </b></p>
<p><b>contribution and being able to influence the US planning process required </b></p>
<p><b>a clearer statement of the UK position. </b></p>
<p><b>839. </b> Mr Johnson asked Mr Hoon on 25 October to note the “increasing difficulty of </p>
<p>keeping options open” because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US could not “continue much longer with the uncertainty” over the UK </p>
<p>contribution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A UK contribution on the scale of Package 3 would “cease to be viable within the </p>
<p>current US timetable on or around 31 October if no public acknowledgement is </p>
<p>made” of the need for preparatory work on the availability of Reserves.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>840. </b> Mr Johnson also asked Mr Hoon to consider the “need to re&#8209;establish with the US </p>
<p>at the highest level whether their planning timetable [was] likely to change”.</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Mr Johnson advised that there might be constitutional difficulties in Turkey over </p>
<p>hosting foreign forces in the absence of a UN resolution. It seemed “increasingly likely” </p>
<p>that the “substantial” US forces would be committed to the North, and that they might </p>
<p>“wish to exercise overall leadership there”. Uncertainty about the UK contribution </p>
<p>complicated the issues for the US and limited the UK’s ability to influence the developing </p>
<p>plan. Gen Franks remained “wedded to a UK role, not least as a possible framework for </p>
<p>integrating contributions from other potential coalition members”. </p>
<p><b>842. </b> Adm Boyce would raise questions about the US timetable with Gen Myers and </p>
<p>there might be “a case for following up at a political level”. But, unless the US accepted </p>
<p>later dates, a decision to permit preparatory action on Reserves would be needed if UK </p>
<p>options were not to be closed off.</p>
<p><b>843. </b> A meeting for Mr Hoon to discuss the issues with Adm Boyce had been arranged </p>
<p>for 28 October. </p>
<p><b>844. </b> Mr Watkins commented to Mr Hoon that there were potential tensions between the </p>
<p>military and inspection timetables; and that there was “as yet … little irritation with our </p>
<p>fence sitting at senior military level in the US”.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>845. </b> The meeting between Adm Boyce and Gen Myers added weight to the view </p>
<p>that US timelines were slipping, in part because of the UN process. There was “some </p>
<p>sympathy with the UK position”.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>846. </b> CENTCOM was described as “coming round” to the northern option. That would </p>
<p>depend on Turkey’s co&#8209;operation. Gen Myers was reported to have:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accepted Adm Boyce’s “point that some overt preparations would send an </p>
<p>entirely appropriate signal to Saddam immediately after” adoption of the UN </p>
<p>resolution, “rather than doing nothing until actual signs of resolution&#8209;bending”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognised the value a UK divisional HQ “might bring in providing a ‘home’ for </p>
<p>any coalition contributions”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that “Much planning” was taking place in the US on post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>considerations. </p>
<p><b>847. </b> The record of the meeting was sent to Sir David Manning, who commented to </p>
<p>Mr Powell that it was “Evidence” that US plans were “now slipping” and that it put the </p>
<p>UK decision “in context”.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>848. </b> The minutes of the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 28 October recorded that: </p>
<p>“The US understood the reasons why the UK could not commit while the UNSCR </p>
<p>was under discussion.” </p>
<p><b>849. </b> While US military staff “continued to work to planning timelines prescribed” by </p>
<p>President Bush in August 2002:</p>
<p>“Senior US officials had begun to acknowledge that there could be a requirement </p>
<p>for these timelines to be altered. It would be important for the UK to try to influence </p>
<p>a shift of several weeks rather than incremental shifts that mirrored the delay in the </p>
<p>signing of the UNSCR.”</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>850. </b> The minutes stated that the UK’s ability to influence the US was diminishing as </p>
<p>time advanced, “particularly as the US had now decided to commit” the 4th Infantry </p>
<p>Division to the northern axis. Adm Boyce directed that “UK planning for either a western </p>
<p>or southern axis was not to commence ahead of a political decision on UK commitment”.</p>
<p><b>851. </b> The minutes also stated that “it would be important to emphasise within </p>
<p>forthcoming submissions that, although Package 3 might be considered expensive, </p>
<p>the alternative of committing to op[eration]s during the aftermath would also require </p>
<p>considerable resources”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>852. </b> On 29 October, Mr Bowen reported to Sir David Manning that the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>were pressing for a decision in principle on Package 3.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>853. </b> Mr Bowen stated that Gen Franks understood the UK position, “including the </p>
<p>political dimension” and had “directed that planning should proceed on the basis of US </p>
<p>forces only operating out of Turkey” and that the 4th Infantry Division would be “the main </p>
<p>combat formation”. Package 3 “would still be welcome as an addition and could have the </p>
<p>particular task of integrating other coalition members’ contributions”. </p>
<p><b>854. </b> Mr Bowen added: </p>
<p>“The MOD argue that they are being excluded from detailed planning and their </p>
<p>influence in discussing issues like the aftermath is diminishing.” </p>
<p><b>855. </b> Mr Bowen commented that some of the assumptions behind the MOD case were </p>
<p>“fragile”. The planning date of early January was “no more than a military [planning] </p>
<p>assumption”, and the willingness of Turkey to accept any ground forces was “still in </p>
<p>doubt”. But the military needed to make such assumptions if they were to “get on with </p>
<p>the job of planning complex operations for extremely uncertain scenarios”. </p>
<p><b>856. </b> Mr Bowen wrote that the MOD would be arguing that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was to the UK’s disadvantage to be excluded from planning for the northern </p>
<p>option.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Turkish dimension” needed to be fully explored if the UK was to be </p>
<p>involved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A commitment in principle did not lock the UK into a commitment in practice.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK leadership of other coalition members’ involvement could be prejudiced. </p>
<p><b>857. </b> The MOD would concede that notification of the Reserves “could be postponed, on </p>
<p>the basis that a commitment in principle would enable them to cause the US military to </p>
<p>re&#8209;examine the assumptions with a view to negotiating a more realistic date”.</p>
<p><b>858. </b> In addition to Sir David Manning’s questions about the implications of offering </p>
<p>Package 3, whether it would be “realistic to think we could backtrack from a decision </p>
<p>in principle” and whether the UK understood what it would be getting into, Mr Bowen </p>
<p>identified the need to consider costs, “the overall profile” the UK wished to adopt, and </p>
<p>the need to factor in slippage in the timetable at the UN and Turkish decisions.</p>
<p><b>859. </b> Mr Bowen viewed the US decision to earmark the 4th Infantry Division as “helpful” </p>
<p>because it showed it was “committed strategically” and would “take the lead”, but he </p>
<p>added that Turkey’s position might mean that nothing would come of the northern axis.</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>860. </b> Mr Bowen wondered whether: </p>
<p>“A way through this … would be to make a commitment in principle to Package 3, </p>
<p>but on the basis that we cannot accept the current planning assumption date for </p>
<p>a Presidential decision. That would force the US military to exclude us or have a </p>
<p>serious discussion about the realism of their timetable …”</p>
<p><b>861. </b> Mr Bowen also suggested that the offer of Package 3 might be made “dependent </p>
<p>on US leadership in the North and willing co&#8209;operation by the Turks”.</p>
<p><b>862. </b> Mr Bowen wrote that pressure on Saddam Hussein needed to be maintained. </p>
<p>“Continued planning” together with activities that were “necessary to prepare for action” </p>
<p>would “all play their part” in that. The UK should be “persuading the international </p>
<p>community and our domestic audience that proper preparation for war” was “the best </p>
<p>way to avoid it”. </p>
<p><b>863. </b> Mr Bowen concluded:</p>
<p>“Overall, I fear we are enmeshed in a military planning cycle which operates out </p>
<p>of synch with the political track. But it is only planning. Provided we enter the right </p>
<p>caveats and get a realistic re&#8209;think about the timelines … I think there is advantage </p>
<p>in our being involved in planning for the North (unless the political view is definitely </p>
<p>that we should confine ourselves to the sea and air packages).”</p>
<p><b>864.  The MOD advised Mr Blair on 29 October that its influence on US planning </b></p>
<p><b>was reducing and the option to deploy UK ground forces was at risk of being </b></p>
<p><b>excluded by default. The only way to avoid that was to offer Package 3 to the US </b></p>
<p><b>for planning on the same basis as Package 2.</b></p>
<p><b>865.  Package 3 could also significantly reduce the UK’s vulnerability to US </b></p>
<p><b>requests to provide a substantial and costly contribution to post&#8209;conflict </b></p>
<p><b>operations. </b></p>
<p><b>866. </b> Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning on 29 October, to report that “US military </p>
<p>planning [was] continuing, but increasingly assuming no UK Land contribution”; and that </p>
<p>an option for a “significant UK land contribution” could be “sensibly kept open only by </p>
<p>placing it on a similar basis” to Package 2.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>867. </b> The MOD advised that it had “become clear over the past few days” that the US </p>
<p>military had begun planning on the assumption that the UK would “not contribute ground </p>
<p>forces and consequently, will not pursue the question of UK involvement with Turkey”. </p>
<p>The US had also decided to commit the 4th US Infantry Division:</p>
<p>“… which would mean that the option of the UK commanding the operation from the </p>
<p>North at divisional level has gone. This does not necessarily mean that we could not </p>

<p>it does mean that the prospect of a significant UK ground role in the North and our </p>
<p>ability to influence that part of the US plan is reducing daily …”</p>
<p><b>868. </b> The MOD advised that preparatory work on Reserves would need to go forward </p>
<p>soon unless the US timetable changed. The UK had taken “discreet soundings” on </p>
<p>whether the US timetable was realistic: </p>
<p>“The sense amongst US military planners is that the realistic starting date for the </p>
<p>current plan is now slipping. But this does not have political endorsement, and we </p>
<p>do not know when or if President Bush will be prepared to signal a later timetable, </p>
<p>given the importance of sustaining pressure on Saddam and US domestic political </p>
<p>considerations.”</p>
<p><b>869. </b> The uncertainty about whether the slippage would be “a matter of days or </p>
<p>something more substantial” left two questions to be addressed. </p>
<p><b>870. </b> First, in relation to a land contribution, the MOD stated that Package 3 was:</p>
<p>“… for practical purposes being excluded by default. If we are to keep the option </p>
<p>open, and continue to have the strongest military cards to underpin our political </p>
<p>influence, the Defence Secretary believes that we should indicate to the US that they </p>
<p>should plan on the assumption that the land contribution would be available, subject </p>
<p>to final political approval … This can be done without publicity. It is also worth noting </p>
<p>that, while Package 3 is significantly more expensive in itself than Package 2, </p>
<p>making it available could significantly reduce our vulnerability to US requests </p>
<p>to provide a substantial (and costly) contribution to post&#8209;conflict stabilisation </p>
<p>operations.”</p>
<p><b>871. </b> Second, Mr Hoon was concerned that he would appear disingenuous if he failed </p>
<p>on 4 November to answer oral questions about the Reserves, were an announcement </p>
<p>then to be made shortly thereafter. </p>
<p><b>872. </b> Mr Watkins concluded that Mr Hoon recognised:</p>
<p>“… that these issues … cannot be disentangled easily from the political climate and </p>
<p>the fate of the UNSCR negotiations which are currently in the balance. But, equally, </p>
<p>he is concerned that we should continue to contribute to maintaining the pressure on </p>
<p>the Iraqis which has so far shown some level of success.”</p>

<p><b>874. </b> On 30 October, Mr Watkins advised Mr Hoon to press for a decision to offer </p>

<p>was subject to clarification of the Turkish position.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>875. </b> Mr Watkins added: </p>
<p>“Paradoxically, clarifying the status of Package 3 puts us in a stronger position to </p>
<p>persuade the US that this timetable is no longer realistic …” </p>
<p><b>876. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that Mr Hoon might want “to counsel against any simplistic </p>

<p><b>878. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC issued an Assessment of Turkey’s attitude </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>879. </b> The JIC judged that Turkey did not want a war against Iraq, but it would support </p>
<p>a US&#8209;led military campaign. Turkey appeared:</p>
<p>“… opposed to UK troops. Such resistance is probably surmountable, but only by </p>
<p>US pressure. Turkey will prefer international legitimacy for the campaign and require </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the domestic impact of a possible outflow of Kurdish refugees; and</p>

<p><b>881. </b> The JIC attributed Turkish sensitivity to UK military involvement in the region to its </p>
<p>role in the creation of Iraq in the 1920s and stated that: “The involvement of UK troops </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S MEETING, 31 OCTOBER 2002</p>
<p><b>882.  On 31 October Mr Blair agreed that the MOD could offer Package 3 to the US </b></p>
<p><b>on the same basis as Package 2.</b></p>
<p><b>883. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair that Mr Watkins’ letter of 29 October </p>
<p>was: “Further pressure from MOD on Package 3. This is based on military planning cycle </p>
<p>… not the UN/Political realties.”</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>884. </b> Sir David asked:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Is the timing realistic any more?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Would the Turks have us?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Could we backtrack if we gave a firmer commitment?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Can we afford Package 3?</p>
<p><b>885. </b> Sir David also wrote alongside the MOD argument that Package 3 would reduce </p>
<p>the UK’s vulnerability to a US request for a substantial post&#8209;conflict contribution: </p>
<p>“This supposes we w[ou]ld agree to such costly requests.”</p>
<p><b>886. </b> Mr Powell wrote a manuscript note to Mr Blair stating: </p>
<p>“The military are making another effort to bounce you into a decision on option 3 … </p>
<p>US timelines are slipping and we do not have to decide yet.”</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>887. </b> On 31 October, Mr Blair, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce discussed the MOD </p>
<p>wish to offer Package 3 to the US for planning purposes.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>888. </b> Adm Boyce stated that US planning was proceeding on the assumption that there </p>
<p>would not be a UK land contribution. The US was “unwilling to approach the Turks about </p>
<p>a possible UK contribution until they had a firmer indication” of likely UK commitment. </p>
<p>If the “UK wanted to keep open the option of a land contribution and be able to </p>
<p>influence the planning process”, the US needed to be told that the land package could </p>
<p>be assumed on the same basis as the other two packages. That “would not be a final </p>
<p>commitment to a UK land contribution”. </p>
<p><b>889. </b> Adm Boyce and Mr Hoon added that the US timetable was slipping beyond the </p>
<p>possible early January start date: </p>
<p>“As a result the earlier tight timelines on warning UK Reservists no longer applied … </p>
<p>a warning notice would not be required until the middle of November.”</p>

<p><b>893. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair concluded that the MOD should tell the US that </p>
<p>the UK was “prepared to put Package 3 on the same basis as Package 2 for planning </p>
<p>purposes, in order to keep the option open; but that no warning should be issued to the </p>
<p>Reservists at this stage”. Mr Blair “should be consulted again before any such warning </p>

<p><b>Why did the UK Government decide to offer ground forces? </b></p>
<p><b>896.  The decision to offer Package 3 was, as Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair, </b></p>
<p><b>a “political call”.</b></p>
<p><b>897.  In military terms, the US did not need UK ground forces to launch an </b></p>
<p><b>invasion of Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>898. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that the US did not need a ground force contribution </p>
<p>from the UK:</p>
<p>“… if they had chosen to go on their own, they could have done so. They had the </p>
<p>capability and the numbers to do so.”</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>899. </b> According to Sir David Manning, the military importance of the UK contribution </p>
<p>was:</p>
<p>“… quite an important contribution, but not decisive.</p>
<p>“The Americans could have done this operation without us. We always knew that … </p>
<p>But nevertheless, I’m sure they were grateful to have a sizeable British contribution </p>
<p>when, in the end, it came to military action.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>Why did the UK offer a divisional headquarters and an armoured </b></p>
<p><b>brigade? </b></p>
<p><b>900.  The MOD started in spring 2002 from the assumption that if military action </b></p>
<p><b>was required, the UK should participate; and that its contribution would be on </b></p>
<p><b>a similar scale to the UK contribution to the US&#8209;led operation Desert Storm, the </b></p>
<p><b>liberation of Kuwait in 1991. It stressed the importance of making a contribution </b></p>
<p><b>which would be seen by the US as commensurate with the UK’s capabilities and </b></p>
<p><b>the demands of the campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>901.  In addition, from the outset of the planning process, the military leadership </b></p>
<p><b>was looking for a discrete UK role in ground operations. This reflected their </b></p>
<p><b>concerns about the difficulty of integrating forces from different nations for </b></p>
<p><b>ground operations.</b></p>
<p><b>902.  That led to the identification of Package 3, which was described as a UK </b></p>
<p><b>division, although its size, shape and component parts changed significantly </b></p>
<p><b>over time. </b></p>
<p><b>903.  From late July onwards, the need to provide cover for a potential strike </b></p>
<p><b>by the Fire Brigades Union, which was equivalent to a medium scale operation, </b></p>
<p><b>meant that the UK would have been unable to deploy a division of either two or </b></p>
<p><b>three brigades within the timescales envisaged by US military planning. </b></p>
<p><b>904.  Military planners concentrated on identifying the maximum practicable </b></p>
<p><b>contribution the UK would be able to generate within the potential timescales for </b></p>
<p><b>US action. </b></p>
<p><b>905.  From August until December 2002, UK planning was based on providing a </b></p>
<p><b>divisional headquarters and one armoured brigade for operations in northern Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>906. </b> Asked how the UK’s options had been evaluated, Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that the </p>
<p>assessment of the UK’s contribution had been approached “in terms of what actually </p>
<p>was achievable”; it had been “assumed that we would want to be helpful to the United </p>
<p>States … and, therefore, how would we go about offering as much as was consistent </p>
<p>with all the other pressures that we faced”.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>907. </b> Mr Hoon added:</p>
<p>“My sense was that, generally speaking, the Prime Minister wanted us to be involved </p>
<p>to the maximum extent that was possible … The Prime Minister was, generally </p>
<p>speaking, anxious to do what the United Kingdom could to help.”</p>

<p>313</p>
<p><b>908. </b> Mr Hoon stated that Mr Blair “would have accepted” if there were practical reasons </p>
<p>why the UK could not offer Package 3, but his “assumption” was that “Downing Street” </p>
<p>wanted to offer a land contribution “if it could be done”.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>909. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that the Chiefs of Staff’s view was that the UK </p>
<p>contribution had to be “large enough to be able to integrate ourselves properly with the </p>
<p>Americans”; and the UK “shouldn’t be put in the position of expecting somebody else to </p>
<p>defend us or sustain us”.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>910. </b> Asked by the Inquiry if he had a sense that the military were agitating to make </p>
<p>sure that they had a role, Sir David Manning replied that he needed to be “very careful” </p>
<p>about that. He had not seen any papers suggesting that and it seemed to him that the </p>
<p>military adopted different positions at different times.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> In the “spring/summer of 2002”, </p>
<p>the military wanted Mr Blair to understand the limits on what they could deliver. But, by </p>
<p>autumn 2002, he sensed that “reluctance” had “shifted to an enthusiasm for taking part”, </p>
<p>and the “pressure” was to offer Package 3.</p>
<p><b>911. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether the US had requested a particular military scale of </p>
<p>contribution from the UK, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“No. He [President Bush] very much left this to us, to decide what we wanted to do, </p>
<p>but I had taken a view that this was something that, if it was right to do, actually it </p>
<p>mattered to have Britain there …”</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>912.  The military arguments for the UK offering to lead a division in the North </b></p>
<p><b>reflected discussions with the US and the UK military assessment of the </b></p>
<p><b>requirements of the operation. </b></p>
<p><b>913. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry there had been a view that converging axes from north </p>
<p>and south, and avoiding logistic congestion in Kuwait and the risks associated with </p>
<p>transit through the Gulf, made “eminent military sense”. The northern option offered </p>
<p>tactical advantages. He had been “slightly more sanguine” about the length of the lines </p>
<p>of communication through Turkey than some of his colleagues. There would also have </p>
<p>been more freedom of manoeuvre and fewer bridging operations in the North.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>914. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that the co&#8209;ordination of ground manoeuvre operations </p>
<p>was difficult and dangerous, and it was best to separate land forces from different states </p>
<p>so far as that was possible.</p>

<p><b>915. </b> Lt Gen Fry emphasised that thinking had been driven by the tactical advantages </p>
<p>of “a certain degree of national independence” and the avoidance of the need to </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinate ground operations, not national ambition.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>What was the UK’s desire to influence the US seeking to achieve, and </b></p>
<p><b>was it a determining factor in the decision?</b></p>
<p><b>916.  The importance of influencing the US was stated repeatedly in the papers </b></p>
<p><b>produced by the MOD between the spring and autumn of 2002. </b></p>
<p><b>917.  Most MOD witnesses suggested that the scale of the UK contribution would </b></p>
<p><b>have an impact on the degree of influence it would be possible to exert on the US, </b></p>
<p><b>and in particular on military planning.</b></p>
<p><b>918. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Commander in Chief Land Command in 2002, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry that it was important to have a substantial land component to influence US </p>
<p>planning and its execution.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p><b>919. </b> Asked by the Inquiry if there was a direct relationship between the size of the </p>
<p>contribution and the degree of influence the UK would have, Gen Jackson replied that </p>
<p>it was not “a linear relationship”, but there was firm connection.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>920. </b> Asked by the Inquiry why the UK was “so keen to send a division”, Lord Boyce </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“I think it was only by having something of that particular size that we thought we </p>
<p>would have a reasonable influence on how the Americans were going to conduct </p>
<p>the campaign.”</p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>921. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… unless and until we had ground force commitments, we did not have the inside </p>
<p>track on planning or influence on the day after or the general conduct of affairs, </p>
<p>including … holding the Americans to a multi&#8209;lateral track and … exhausting the </p>

<p>Gulf Conflict was that:</p>
<p>“In 1990, we learned that, once we committed ourselves to a ground force </p>

<p>363</p>
<p><b>923. </b> Sir Kevin subsequently stated that the lesson the UK had drawn from the 1991 Gulf </p>

<p><b>924. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that “the larger the contribution we made, the more </p>
<p>influence we felt we would have over American planning and the ability to shape things </p>
<p>in the future”.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>925. </b> Asked in what specific areas it was thought, in the second half of 2002, British </p>
<p>influence could apply, Lt Gen Fry replied:</p>
<p>“… we felt at a tactical level we might be able to influence the Americans in certain </p>
<p>ways … about the conduct of operations, and to a certain extent that was true. </p>
<p>I don’t think we ever fundamentally influenced their level of military ambition or </p>
<p>necessarily even their scheme of manoeuvre, but I think we did assist and shape </p>
<p>their views in some ways. </p>
<p>“But I think … the full benefit that this should have given the UK was never going </p>
<p>to be visible to me, because it seems to me that it was the military contribution … </p>
<p>which brought the influence which should then have been deployed at governmental </p>
<p>and diplomatic levels.”</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>926.  The debate in the MOD suggests that there was no unanimity about whether </b></p>
<p><b>significant ground forces were required to influence the US or that could be </b></p>
<p><b>achieved by the forces within Package 2.</b></p>
<p><b>927. </b> On 9 October, ACM Squire stated that Package 2 would “not entail a loss of </p>
<p>influence”. </p>
<p><b>928. </b> On 15 October Mr Hoon wrote: “In principle, both packages could strengthen </p>
<p>that relationship: Package 2 alone should easily surpass any other conceivable non&#8209;US </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>929. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry that he was not sure that it had been necessary to </p>
<p>provide significant numbers to secure influence. It was the UK’s “niche capabilities” and </p>
<p>the quality of the advice it provided to US commanders that gave the UK influence.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p><b>930.  The advice to Mr Hoon and Mr Blair did not distinguish clearly between a </b></p>
<p><b>desire and ability to influence US military planning on the one hand and wider and </b></p>
<p><b>more strategic objectives on the other. </b></p>
<p><b>931.  There was a perception that the UK would be able to influence, and if </b></p>
<p><b>necessary delay, the timing of the military campaign. That was initially seen as </b></p>
<p><b>desirable to give more time for inspections and the strategy of coercion to work </b></p>
<p><b>and to build domestic and international support for action.</b></p>
<p><b>932.  A later timescale was also desirable if UK ground forces were to be ready to </b></p>
<p><b>participate in combat operations. </b></p>
<p><b>933.  The argument that the UK would be unable to influence the conduct of the </b></p>
<p><b>US military campaign without a significant and active role in combat operations is </b></p>
<p><b>self&#8209;evidently true. The key question is, however, whether the influence achieved </b></p>
<p><b>was commensurate with the scale of the UK contribution. </b></p>
<p><b>934.  The degree to which the UK was able to influence the planning and conduct </b></p>
<p><b>of the military campaign is difficult to determine, as Section 8 states.</b></p>
<p><b>935.  The extent to which the offer of Package 3 rather than Package 2 was driven </b></p>
<p><b>by the view that it would materially affect the UK’s ability to influence the US at the </b></p>
<p><b>political level, or that it would have a lasting impact on the strategic relationship </b></p>
<p><b>between the US and UK is debatable.</b></p>
<p><b>936. </b> Mr Blair regarded the decision as a strategic choice for the UK. He told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“If you are there with a bigger force alongside the Americans than otherwise, then, of </p>
<p>course, you will be more intimately involved, but that’s not really the reason.”</p>
<p>368</p>
<p><b>937. </b> Asked whether he saw a correlation between the size of the UK contribution and its </p>
<p>influence with the US, Mr Jonathan Powell told the Inquiry that he did not think that was </p>
<p>true.</p>
<p>369</p>
<p><b>938. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether he thought offering Package 3 had been essential, </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>317</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>First, the military wanted to participate at a command level and thought that </p>
<p>standing by the US was important to the relationship with the US military “on </p>
<p>which they crucially depended”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Second, Mr Blair “felt that, if we were going to do it, we should be with the </p>
<p>Americans properly”.</p>
<p>370</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>939. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that the reasons for participating in a land </p>
<p>invasion “should be for state reasons, for political reasons”.</p>
<p>371</p>
<p> In his view, what the </p>
<p>US particularly wanted was use of bases, “Cyprus and Diego Garcia”, Special Forces </p>
<p>and aircraft. </p>
<p><b>940. </b> Sir David Manning acknowledged that the relationship between the size of the </p>
<p>UK contribution and the degree of influence it bought was “not a wholly spurious </p>
<p>argument”.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> There had been Defence Reviews which:</p>
<p>“… argued that we must be capable of fighting with the Americans in hot wars, and </p>
<p>if we suddenly show we can’t do that, we are not willing to do that, that changes the </p>
<p>perspective.”</p>
<p><b>941. </b> But Sir David added that was, in his view, not a “clinching argument” in relation to </p>
<p>Iraq. The UK’s “willingness to take our fair share had been very clear in Afghanistan”. </p>
<p>He did not feel that the UK’s “influence was likely to suffer particularly if we said there’s </p>
<p>a limit to what we can do”.</p>
<p><b>942. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that the decision “was not a narrow military issue”; </p>
<p>it should be considered in the context of Mr Blair’s policy that the disarmament of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was the most important single thing to do at that stage. In that broader </p>
<p>context, it was, therefore:</p>
<p>“… very valid for us to seek to make a significant contribution … to international </p>
<p>stability.”</p>
<p>373</p>
<p><b>943. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that in his view it had been “recognised ultimately” that </p>
<p>the decision on Package 3 “was a political judgement for the Prime Minister, in terms </p>
<p>of the wider picture of the kind of things we had been discussing in terms of influence </p>
<p>and coherence”.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p><b>944. </b> Mr Hoon’s minute of 15 October suggested that Mr Blair should attach conditions </p>
<p>to the offer of Package 3. There is no indication that the UK did so.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>What factors influenced the timing of the decision?</b></p>
<p><b>945.  The uncertainties about the US timetable for military action, including the </b></p>
<p><b>impact of the timetable for inspections following adoption of a UN resolution, </b></p>
<p><b>made it hard to identify a precise date by when decisions on preparations would </b></p>
<p><b>have had to have been taken.</b></p>
<p><b>946.  The MOD was, however, anxious about the need to make timely preparations </b></p>
<p><b>to equip, train and deploy the agreed force package if it was to keep the option of </b></p>
<p><b>a land contribution on the table.</b></p>
<p><b>947.  Package 3 in October 2002 was based on a square armoured brigade, which </b></p>
<p><b>constituted only a medium scale capability, but the deployment of a divisional </b></p>
<p><b>headquarters and the demands of the northern option for logistic support </b></p>
<p><b>increased the number of personnel it was estimated would be required to a total </b></p>
<p><b>of 28,000, including 7,700 Reserves.</b></p>
<p><b>948. </b> Lt Gen Pigott had advised Mr Hoon on 24 May that three months’ warning would </p>
<p>be needed to deploy a medium scale joint force, and six months’ warning would be </p>
<p>needed to deploy a large scale war&#8209;fighting land force. The latter would be better </p>
<p>prepared and carry fewer risks if nine months warning was available. </p>
<p><b>949. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… if politicians wanted certain options, you had to have enough time to </p>
<p>prepare …”</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>950. </b> In the event, as Section 6.2 shows, the size and shape of the UK contribution </p>
<p>changed very significantly in January when the decision was made to deploy for </p>
<p>operations in southern Iraq. The roles for two of the three UK brigades were not decided </p>
<p>until March 2003. </p>
<p><b>951.  The Government’s stated objective was to keep the option of a significant UK </b></p>
<p><b>land contribution open.</b></p>
<p><b>952.  In the MOD’s advice to Mr Hoon, and in his advice to Mr Blair, a range of </b></p>
<p><b>arguments were set out of differing weight and significance in support of the </b></p>
<p><b>MOD position that a decision was needed in October 2002 to offer significant </b></p>
<p><b>ground forces to the US for planning purposes on the same basis as the forces in </b></p>
<p><b>Package 2 if the UK was to have a significant role in ground combat operations. </b></p>
<p><b>953.  The timing of the decision on 31 October to offer ground forces to the </b></p>
<p><b>US on the same basis as Package 2 appears to have been driven primarily by </b></p>
<p><b>the MOD advice of 29 October that the option of UK participation in ground </b></p>
<p><b>operations through Turkey was at risk of being excluded from CENTCOM’s </b></p>

<p><b>that US planning was proceeding on the basis that there would not be a UK land </b></p>
<p><b>contribution.</b></p>
<p><b>954.  Mr Hoon’s oral evidence to the Inquiry suggested that the US had given </b></p>
<p><b>the impression that, in the absence of a firm decision, it was discounting a UK </b></p>
<p><b>contribution.</b></p>
<p><b>955. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that, in October, the UK had:</p>
<p>“… pretty much assumed that the Americans had discounted the prospect of … </p>
<p>[Package 3] and were planning without our involvement, simply because we </p>
<p>had not taken the decisions that were required in the timescale that was at that </p>
<p>stage required.”</p>
<p>376</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>956. </b> Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“… by October … we had had this discussion on several occasions … my </p>
<p>understanding, by the middle of October, was that the Americans were assuming </p>
<p>we wouldn’t be there … on the land [option] … So essentially … what I was really </p>
<p>saying to the Prime Minister was, ‘You have got to decide. You have got to decide </p>
<p>whether we are going to offer this third option and this package of an armoured </p>
<p>division on the land’ … eventually … probably as late as the very end of October, </p>
<p>that decision was then taken.”</p>
<p>377</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>957.  Evidence about CENTCOM’s position in documents at the time, including </b></p>
<p><b>Adm Boyce’s discussion with Gen Franks on 10 October, Mr Johnson’s advice to </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon of 25 October, and Mr Bowen’s report of the Chiefs of Staff discussion on </b></p>

<p><b>might offer a land contribution.</b></p>

<p><b>no UK land contribution.</b></p>
<p><b>Were the post&#8209;conflict implications for the UK, of a significant role on </b></p>
<p><b>the ground in an invasion of Iraq, properly addressed?</b></p>
<p><b>960.  The MOD advice and Mr Hoon’s minute of 15 October argued that a combat </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>961.  As Sir David Manning foresaw in his advice of 16 October, however, far from </b></p>
<p><b>reducing the risk of significant commitments post&#8209;conflict, contributing ground </b></p>
<p><b>forces created significant obligations and responsibilities for the UK post&#8209;conflict. </b></p>
<p><b>962. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that there was a sense that it was better to be in Iraq at </p>
<p>the beginning of any operation, rather than go in later for a peacekeeping operation </p>
<p>without having prior experience and information.</p>
<p>378</p>
<p> There were also concerns that would </p>
<p>require more troops for longer. </p>
<p><b>963. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit confirmed that one of the arguments for offering land forces </p>
<p>for combat operations was that the MOD had not wanted “to get caught in the role of </p>
<p>follow&#8209;on forces because then we could find ourselves even more bogged down and </p>
<p>under even greater pressure to stay for longer than we felt … sensible”.</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> The UK had </p>
<p>been caught anyway, although Sir Kevin suggested that taking part in the invasion had </p>
<p>made it easier to reduce UK force levels after the conflict than it would have been if the </p>
<p>force had deployed only for post&#8209;conflict tasks. </p>
<p><b>964. </b> The recognition of that responsibility in the planning for post&#8209;conflict operations </p>
<p>is addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<p><b>Did the need to maintain the Army’s morale influence the decision?</b></p>
<p><b>965.  The MOD and No.10 both raised the question of whether there could be an </b></p>
<p><b>issue of managing morale if the Army was not involved in combat operations. </b></p>
<p><b>966.  The balance of the evidence suggests that none of the key decision&#8209;takers </b></p>
<p><b>regarded that as a decisive factor in the decision, which would clearly have been </b></p>
<p><b>inappropriate. </b></p>
<p><b>967. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that, at the meeting on 31 October, Adm </p>
<p>Boyce had said that some inside the Army were irritated not to be more involved.</p>
<p>380</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Campbell commented that Adm Boyce was “hard to read, sometimes giving the </p>
<p>impression none of them wanted anything to do with this, then at others giving the </p>
<p>impression they all wanted to be off to the front line”. </p>
<p><b>968. </b> In his book, <i>The New Machiavelli</i>, Mr Powell wrote that Adm Boyce had told No.10 </p>
<p>that the Armed Forces wanted to participate on the ground at “division strength with </p>
<p>their own command”; and that it would damage morale if they were restricted to a mere </p>
<p>supporting role from sea and air while the Americans and others carried out the ground </p>

<p><b>969. </b> Asked if the argument was that it would sustain morale in the Army had been </p>
<p>a factor in the decision, Mr Powell told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The military indicated to us that it would be important for morale that we were </p>
<p>involved properly, yes.”</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Asked about Mr Powell’s evidence to the Inquiry on morale, General the Lord </p>
<p>Walker, Chief of the General Staff from April 2000 to February 2003, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that that was “not something” he had had “any anxiety about”. There might have been </p>
<p>“expressions of exasperation” at the “lower levels” in the Army if it was not involved, but </p>
<p>it was not an issue as far as he was concerned.</p>
<p>383</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>971. </b> Asked how important the issues of morale and the standing of the British Army had </p>
<p>been in terms of not wanting to be left out of a major campaign, Gen Jackson told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that, if it had gone ahead without a land component, he thought “the army would </p>
<p>have been, to put it mildly, rather disappointed”.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p><b>972. </b> Asked if the issue had been discussed by the Army Board, Gen Jackson stated </p>
<p>that he could not remember precisely, but he had “very little doubt that the Army Board’s </p>
<p>view would have been as I have just outlined”. He had been “mystified” in relation to </p>
<p>the thinking behind the “opening offer”, but over the autumn [of 2002] a “more balanced </p>
<p>contribution came into being”.</p>
<p><b>973. </b> Asked whether the impact of Army morale had been a factor which had been put </p>
<p>to him, and through him to Mr Blair, Mr Hoon replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t recall the argument being put to me in quite those terms. I … was well aware </p>
<p>of the tremendous qualities of our Armed Forces and their desire to be used and … </p>
<p>participate.</p>
<p>“So there was a sense, particularly amongst the Army, that they didn’t want to be left </p>
<p>out. But … I wouldn’t have regarded that … as something that you put on the table </p>
<p>and say it was a major factor in the decision&#8209;making.”</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>974. </b> Mr Hoon added that there was a sense that the Army “wanted to play their part”, </p>
<p>and that made the decision easier because they were saying “if necessary we can play </p>
<p>our part”.</p>
<p><b>975. </b> Mr Hoon’s own comments on that point in the minute he sent to Mr Blair, which </p>

<p><b>976. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The interesting thing … was that from an early stage it was the Chief of the Defence </p>
<p>Staff who had argued very strongly that if we were going to get involved in the </p>
<p>military action, the Army had to be there, because they would be unhappy and </p>
<p>cross if they weren’t. I don’t trivialise the way it was put across … So we could have </p>
<p>provided facilitation and then go[ne] in afterwards, which would not have meant </p>
<p>standing down the troops we had in theatre and it was essentially what the Spanish </p>
<p>and the Italians did.”</p>
<p>386</p>
<p><b>977. </b> Asked about the weight he had attached to Adm Boyce’s advice on morale, </p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he had asked:</p>
<p>“… the military for their view, and their view in this instance was that they were up for </p>
<p>doing it and that they preferred to be right at the centre of things … that was my view </p>
<p>too. I thought, if it was right for us to be in it, we should be in it there alongside our </p>

<p>389</p>
<p> If they had been unable to </p>

<p>they weren’t involved. So yes. It would have been untruthful of me not to represent </p>

<p>“It was not a factor of saying if you don’t do this the Army are going to mutiny or to </p>
<p>want to go home or whatever. Of course not. It would be wrong not to have </p>

<p><b>981.  The decision to offer ground forces (Package 3) to the US for planning </b></p>
<p><b>purposes was a significant step. Once the offer was made, it would have been </b></p>
<p><b>difficult to withdraw. This constrained the UK’s subsequent policy choices. </b></p>
<p><b>982.  There is no evidence that the extent to which the offer of Package 3 might </b></p>

<p><b>983.  The risks associated with the decision, and with other options, were not </b></p>
<p><b>examined by senior Ministers in a collective discussion on the basis of coherent </b></p>
<p><b>inter&#8209;departmental analysis and advice. </b></p>
<p><b>984. </b> The decision to offer Package 2 – UK maritime and air forces, Special Forces and </p>
<p>niche capabilities – to the US for planning purposes in September 2002 was relatively </p>
<p>uncontroversial and was not seen as exposing the UK to significant risk.</p>
<p><b>985. </b> The offer of significant forces for ground operations for planning purposes was not </p>
<p>the same as a decision to commit the forces to military operations, but it did raise more </p>
<p>difficult issues of both a practical and political nature.</p>
<p><b>986. </b> The advice for Mr Hoon and Mr Blair in October 2002, however, did not explicitly </p>
<p>address a number of crucial strategic issues which had previously been identified, </p>
<p>including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the implications of the mismatch between US and UK strategic objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the risk of having to make a choice between the US and the UN route because </p>
<p>of tension between the US military timetable and that for UN inspections; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the degree to which offering Package 3 and deeper engagement in US planning </p>
<p>might constrain future choices more than the offer of Packages 1 and 2; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the potential damage to the UK/US relationship if the UK subsequently decided </p>
<p>it would not participate in military action.</p>

<p><b>988. </b> The issues had also been identified in the papers prepared for the Chiefs of Staff.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The fact that “the UN inspection timetable was now out of sync with the </p>
<p>timetable for possible military action beginning in early January”. He had asked </p>
<p>“whether we might now be looking at the second of the original ‘windows’ ie </p>
<p>a campaign next winter rather than this”. That had not been ruled out but the </p>
<p>conversation had shifted to the prospects for internal regime change sparing the </p>
<p>need for military action. The best chance of securing that was “a very tough UN </p>
<p>resolution accompanied by threatening military preparations, in the hope that </p>
<p>Saddam’s system would implode under the strain”.</p>

<p><b>1004. </b> The British Embassy in Washington reported on 1 November that it has been </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1006. </b> Sir Kevin argued that a UK contribution in the North “made the greatest political </p>

<p>support for Turkey’s EU candidacy were “misplaced”. He had explained that all the </p>
<p>UK’s planning had “thus far been predicated on the northern route” and the UK “had not </p>
<p>considered alternatives”. He believed other options “would present both political and </p>
<p>military problems”. The military package the UK was considering had been “tailored” to </p>
<p>that role and “was not something that could be fitted in anywhere”. </p>
<p><b>1007. </b> Senior members of the US Administration offered differing views on the strength </p>
<p>of Turkey’s concern. Those in the Pentagon and NSC suggested that the UK should look </p>
<p>at other options. One official in the NSC suggested that, if it was not feasible for the UK </p>
<p>to operate from the South or West, it was “imperative” that the UK should tell the US </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p>that a coercive strategy “<b>must offer carrots as well as sticks</b>” to “<b>achieve a </b></p>
<p><b>change</b>” in the behaviour of the Iraqi regime “<b>without conflict</b>”. It also required </p>
<p>a “<b>continued credible threat of force</b>”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Diplomatic/Force</b>: UN inspections failed “at some point” and the international </p>
<p>community resorted to the use of force “with UN authorisation”. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Force</b>: Early failure of the UN route and either no UN resolution or an </p>
<p>inadequate one and a US&#8209;led Coalition resorting to the use of force without a </p>
<p>UN mandate. </p>
<p><b>1018. </b> The section on post&#8209;conflict issues had been substantially revised. It stated that </p>
<p>the “lasting impression of Coalition legitimacy and success” would be “determined by the </p>
<p>nature of the Iraqi nation” that emerged after the conflict. That had the potential to “prove </p>
<p>the most protracted and costly” phase of the campaign. </p>
<p><b>1019. </b> In its summary of the implications of the post&#8209;conflict phase for military planning, </p>
<p>the paper stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The impact of any enduring commitment on other operations would be </p>
<p>significant. A recommendation on the size of force the UK is prepared to commit </p>
<p>must be prepared, at least for the key six months following any operation …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Planning for Resolution Phase operations must be complete before the start of </p>
<p>offensive operations. Any UK land force HQ must have the capacity to conduct </p>
<p>offensive and Resolution Phase operations concurrently.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… clarity on post&#8209;Resolution Phase and likely UK contribution will be needed </p>
<p>before operations commence.”</p>
<p><b>1020. </b> The post&#8209;conflict issues raised by the SPG are addressed in Section 6.4.</p>
<p><b>1021. </b> A new section addressed the problems the Coalition would face if Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein adopted a “Fortress Baghdad” strategy. The SPG stated that the Coalition could </p>
<p>not “engage in drawn out urban conflict”:</p>
<p>“Loss of tempo, rising casualties and humanitarian efforts would undermine Coalition </p>
<p>will to continue and rapidly alienate regional supporters.” </p>
<p><b>1022. </b> The SPG proposed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining the moral and legal high ground by minimising civilian casualties, </p>
<p>collateral damage and own casualties;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>trying to avoid fighting in built up areas and to “guard and bypass” towns and </p>
<p>cities, including denying access to Baghdad, during offensive operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>attempting decapitation of the regime;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>isolation of security forces still loyal to the regime and subversion through </p>
<p>“aggressive” information and psychological operations;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“when ready”, conducting “operations to complete the defeat of the surviving </p>
<p>loyal elements”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring that a “massive humanitarian aid effort” was available “to provide life </p>
<p>support to non&#8209;combatants”.</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> Other new points identified in the paper included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Draft objectives for a northern option remained under consideration by the </p>
<p>Pentagon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was “seeking to place” force generation and preparation efforts “in an </p>
<p>appropriate framework to determine their effect and timing” in the “Force on </p>
<p>Mind campaign”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The adoption of the UN track meant that the timing of a military operation </p>
<p>might “shift to the point of failure of UN processes” and might be required in </p>
<p>“hot months”. The SPG’s initial assessment was that the UK would “<b>be able to </b></p>
<p><b>continue operations</b>” but it was “feasible that, at some point”, the risk might </p>
<p>“<b>become unacceptable</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mitigation measures were being identified to address the risk of attacks using </p>
<p>chemical and biological weapons and residual hazards after the military </p>
<p>campaign.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CENTCOM plan included “sequential ground attack into Iraq from SE </p>
<p>Turkey to coincide with the main effort attack of V Corps forces in the South … </p>
<p>the northern option … built upon the 4th Infantry Division of the US Army”. That </p>
<p>might “include UK Package 3 forces pending political decision”. Command and </p>
<p>control procedures and the likelihood of delivering a Corps Headquarters for the </p>
<p>force had “yet to be determined”. </p>
<p><b>1024. </b> The preference for the northern option was stressed by Major General </p>
<p>Robin Brims, the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1st (UK) Armoured Division, </p>
<p>when he met Lieutenant General David McKiernan, Commander, Coalition Forces Land </p>
<p>Component Command, on 10 November.</p>
<p>405</p>

<p>were discussed, Maj Gen Brims reported that Lt Gen McKiernan and his superiors </p>

<p>331</p>
<p><b>1032. </b> The key points were that the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Assured the US “of its continued determination to see the disarmament of Iraq, </p>
<p>by peaceful means if at all possible, but by force if necessary”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Applauded “the leadership shown by the US Administration” and congratulated </p>
<p>it on the “successful negotiation … of resolution 1441”. The unanimity of the </p>
<p>Security Council had sent “a powerful message from the international community </p>
<p>to Iraq” which would be “strongly reinforced by the US Administration’s initiative </p>
<p>to build and sustain the widest possible support for any further action that may </p>
<p>prove necessary”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Confirmed that the “forces and facilities listed in the US request” were “available </p>
<p>as a basis for planning” and were those that the UK “would expect to make </p>
<p>available”. Military staff and officials would “remain ready to … engage fully </p>
<p>in further detailed planning and development of military options, including </p>
<p>refinement of the potential UK contribution within the broad scale of effort … </p>
<p>indicated”. </p>
<p><b>1033. </b> Mr Hoon commented that the issue of UK support to military action had “been </p>
<p>the subject of bilateral work for some time” and he had, therefore, not repeated the </p>
<p>detail. He was “very grateful for the excellent access” given to the UK and was “keen </p>
<p>to maintain the close co&#8209;operation” that had “already been established”.</p>
<p>PJHQ’S PROPOSAL TO EXPLORE OPTIONS IN THE SOUTH </p>
<p><b>1034.  After the adoption of resolution 1441, significant questions about Turkey’s </b></p>
<p><b>position remained. </b></p>
<p><b>1035. </b> Mr Westmacott reported that a Turkish statement on 8 November had welcomed </p>
<p>the adoption of resolution 1441 and that it hoped Iraq would comply quickly; and that </p>
<p>there was relief that the resolution made “war a little less likely”.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1036. </b> PJHQ reported on 11 November that Maj Gen Fry was concerned that the </p>
<p>difficulties with Turkey had not been fully acknowledged.</p>
<p>413</p>
<p> The paper being developed </p>
<p>for the Chiefs of Staff should, therefore, examine both northern and southern options.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Mr Hoon was advised on 14 November that: </p>
<p>“While it seemed likely that Turkey would accept US forces, negotiations would be </p>
<p>protracted. The extent to which the US would press the Turks on our behalf was </p>
<p>not clear.”</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1039. </b> The “public posture on specific military preparations” should remain “low key”. </p>
<p><b>1040.  Lt Gen Reith proposed that options in the South should also be explored. </b></p>
<p><b>1041. </b> The paper considering options for a UK land contribution, submitted by </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith to the Chiefs of Staff on 18 November, advised that many of the </p>
<p>assumptions behind the force levels in Package 3 offered to the Americans for planning </p>
<p>purposes were no longer valid.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> The US had “embraced the wider significance of </p>
<p>the North” and allocated a US division to that axis, but it had withdrawn the offer of </p>
<p>a US armoured brigade operating under UK command. The northern option would </p>
<p>require a Corps level (three&#8209;star) HQ, which had “yet to be found”; and there was a </p>
<p>US aspiration that the UK would contribute to and lead any “three&#8209;star” HQ in the </p>
<p>North. The uncertainties about Turkish co&#8209;operation were also “a concern, preventing </p>
<p>reconnaissance and creating logistic uncertainty”.</p>
<p><b>1042. </b> PJHQ had, therefore, “developed” four potential courses of action “in line with </p>
<p>current US thinking: one in the North and three in the South, which were “feasible, </p>
<p>although they [would] all require provision of an additional manoeuvre brigade”. </p>
<p><b>1043. </b> In the South, the UK would operate under US command. The paper expanded </p>
<p>on the advantages and disadvantages of each course of action, including whether they </p>
<p>offered a “high profile and worthwhile role” for the UK. </p>
<p><b>1044. </b> Lt Gen Reith wrote: </p>
<p>“Without Turkish co&#8209;operation, UK forces may be either excluded from participation </p>
<p>or, if agreement is reached late, have their ability to participate in the early stages </p>
<p>of the campaign in the North compromised. This would impact on the strategic </p>
<p>simultaneity the plan is designed to achieve. To date, UK policy has been to allow </p>
<p>the US to act as the principal interlocutors … The results … have left our position </p>
<p>uncertain. </p>
<p>“… If a decision is not made soon, the UK may need to engage directly with Tu[rkey] </p>
<p>to achieve resolution.”</p>
<p><b>1045. </b> Lt Gen Reith recommended discounting options of integrating a UK brigade </p>
<p>within a US division in the North and a UK division operating independently of the </p>
<p>US. He suggested that it would be “feasible” for the UK and US to construct a Corps </p>

<p>headquarters and that: “Command at 3&#8209;star level would restore the UK lead in the North, </p>
<p>and also indicate tacit agreement for ownership of the northern Area of Operations (AO) </p>
<p>in Phase IV.” </p>
<p><b>1046. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that the northern option:</p>
<p>“… could result in UK long&#8209;term leadership of the region during post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>operations: a position which the US would appear to favour. It would be a </p>
<p>challenging area to control and develop, particularly in preserving regional stability </p>
<p>between the Turks, Kurds and Sunnis. Whilst the UK has the necessary experience </p>
<p>and capability, the challenges do need to be assessed in line with UK strategic </p>
<p>guidance.”</p>
<p><b>1047. </b> In relation to operations in the South, the paper identified three options for a UK </p>
<p>division: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Operating as a “manoeuvre formation” within US V Corps.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Operating as a “manoeuvre formation” within US I Marine Expeditionary </p>
<p>Force (MEF).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Operating as a “second echelon force” within US V US Corps.</p>
<p><b>1048. </b> The paper considered that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Command and Control arrangements would be “less complex than in the North”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “shortened and simplified LOC [lines of communication] make all southern </p>
<p>COA attractive … However, it should be recognised that US plans are well </p>
<p>advanced in the South, there is very limited logistic space available … </p>
<p>deployment would require considerable synchronisation with the US.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A post&#8209;conflict positioning of the UK division in the South could be attractive. </p>
<p>The range of problems appears less&#8209;complex and diverse, the long&#8209;term force </p>
<p>structure requirements could be reduced and local conditions are likely to be </p>
<p>more conducive to development and influence. The northern … Gulf … is also </p>
<p>a traditional area of UK influence.”</p>
<p><b>1049. </b> Lt Gen Reith concluded:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Four options were “achievable” and offered “worthwhile tasks”, but the UK </p>
<p>needed to “reduce risk in its timetable for deployment and RSOI [Reception, </p>
<p>Staging, Onward Movement and Integration]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All four feasible options would require “a UK division with integral capability for </p>
<p>manoeuvre”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The northern option offered “a high profile and worthwhile role for the UK”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>334</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Without confirmation of Turkey’s support, the UK would “need to continue </p>
<p>planning for a southern option as well”. The roles envisaged in the South were </p>
<p>“worthwhile but less high profile” and there was an “implicit … risk of the UK </p>
<p>engagement in operations in Baghdad” in two of the three options. </p>
<p><b>1050. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were asked to indicate which course of action in the South </p>
<p>they would prefer, and were reminded to consider “where we wish to be at the end of </p>
<p>Phase III, as this could impact directly on any UK involvement in Phase IV”. </p>
<p><b>1051.  The Inquiry has not seen any detailed analysis underpinning Lt Gen Reith’s </b></p>
<p><b>conclusion that southern Iraq would be more manageable in the post&#8209;conflict </b></p>
<p><b>period than the North.</b></p>
<p>MOD ADVICE FOR NO.10, 19 NOVEMBER 2002</p>
<p><b>1052.  The MOD told No.10 on 19 November that the option of a military campaign </b></p>
<p><b>launched on 6 January 2003 appeared to have lapsed, and the timelines were </b></p>
<p><b>“uncertain”. </b></p>
<p><b>1053.  Mr Hoon recommended that the UK should press the US for clarity on the </b></p>
<p><b>Turkish position.</b></p>
<p><b>1054.  If the UK had to “fall back” on a role in the South, it would be looking for </b></p>
<p><b>a role in the invasion rather than providing follow&#8209;on forces.</b></p>
<p><b>1055.  MOD concerns about the importance of post&#8209;conflict operations and the </b></p>
<p><b>need for work on the implications for the UK approach to the campaign are </b></p>
<p><b>addressed in Section 6.4.</b></p>
<p><b>1056. </b> Following the visits to the US by Sir Kevin Tebbit and Adm Boyce and in advance </p>
<p>of the NATO Summit in Prague on 21 November and the planned debate on Iraq in the </p>
<p>House of Commons on 25 November, Mr Watkins sent Sir David Manning an update </p>
<p>on military discussions with the US.</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> He set out the themes which had emerged </p>
<p>and registered a number of concerns, including the need to press the US to clarify </p>
<p>Turkey’s position.</p>
<p><b>1057. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that there was a need to “continue military preparations to </p>
<p>underpin the diplomacy/inspection track, without bringing forces to an unsustainable </p>
<p>level of readiness”. There was “a sense … that the realistic timetable for action was </p>
<p>slipping” but there had been “no US political endorsement of any later date for planning </p>
<p>purposes”. </p>
<p><b>1058. </b> Mr Watkins advised that the US continued to describe the northern front “as an </p>
<p>essential part of the plan”, but there was no clear agreement with Turkey “who had </p>
<p>declined to be definitive pending the appointment of a new Government”. The US might </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>335</p>
<p>be “in for a long and expensive negotiation” and it was clear that the US priority would </p>
<p>be “to secure basing” for its “own ground forces”. </p>
<p><b>1059. </b> Mr Hoon believed that the UK should “up the ante” with the US, and: “Press for </p>
<p>clarity on the Turkish position, one way or the other …” </p>
<p><b>1060. </b> Mr Hoon wanted Sir David Manning to:</p>
<p>“… reinforce with Condi Rice the need for the President to try to unblock this. If we </p>
<p>do have to fall back on a southern role we should try to ensure that it is as part of the </p>
<p>main effort rather than as follow&#8209;on forces.”</p>
<p><b>1061. </b> Addressing UK military preparations, Mr Watkins wrote that the option of a military </p>
<p>campaign launched on 6 January 2003 seemed to have “effectively lapsed” and the </p>
<p>timelines were “uncertain”. The US military position was described as “get ready, but </p>
<p>not too ready”, because they did “not want to bring too large a force to too high a pitch </p>
<p>of readiness”. </p>
<p><b>1062. </b> Mr Hoon recommended continuing with military preparations to keep options </p>
<p>open, and suggested that the debate in the House of Commons on 25 November </p>
<p>provided an opportunity to make some public reference to them.</p>
<p><b>1063. </b> There was “a sense in the US” of “two broad timelines in play, implying two </p>
<p>different plans”. The first was a “high&#8209;impact event to which the US might feel the </p>
<p>need to respond quickly at short notice”. The second was a decision that a material </p>
<p>breach had occurred which would be followed by a “more deliberative build&#8209;up </p>
<p>to military action”. </p>
<p><b>1064. </b> Each scenario was “problematic”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The first would effectively hand the initiative to Saddam Hussein; it might </p>
<p>provoke a rapid response, but that could not be decisive because it could not </p>
<p>involve sufficient land forces to take control of Iraq, “unless … it leads … to </p>
<p>regime collapse, a scenario in which the US seem to invest quite a lot of hope”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The second would give Saddam Hussein time which he “might be able to </p>
<p>exploit diplomatically and militarily”. A deliberate campaign “would require some </p>
<p>60&#8209;90 days’ build&#8209;up, and the time will soon come when the question has to </p>
<p>be confronted of whether it is sensible to contemplate fighting in the summer”. </p>
<p>A “common understanding” needed to be reached with the US and plans </p>
<p>“shaped accordingly”.</p>
<p><b>1065. </b> Addressing the issue of “Timetable and Triggers”, Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p>“To some extent, triggers are now under Saddam’s control and so cannot be slotted </p>
<p>into any firm timetable. Moreover, what constitutes a ‘violation’ and/or ‘material </p>
<p>breach’ remains undefined: many in the US are reduced to saying ‘we’ll know when </p>
<p>we see it’, which is not a suitable base for planning.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>1066. </b> The MOD was also concerned that:</p>
<p>“Lack of clarity in US thinking about possible triggers for military action needs to be </p>
<p>resolved quickly, particularly in relation to the No&#8209;Fly Zones.” </p>
<p><b>1067. </b> If a Coalition aircraft was shot down, it would, “under long&#8209;standing plans, trigger </p>
<p>a massive US response”, which the US might use to trigger a wider campaign. </p>
<p><b>1068. </b> Mr Hoon recommended working “quickly to reach an agreed US/UK view on </p>
<p>triggers … well before we are confronted with it in practice”, and explaining to the US </p>
<p>that hostility in the No&#8209;Fly Zones should be met only by “self&#8209;defence responses”. </p>
<p><b>1069. </b> Mr Watkins also drew attention to the importance of planning for the “aftermath” </p>
<p>of military action: “This needs to guide thinking on the conflict phase, for all sorts of </p>
<p>reasons”. Mr Hoon believed that the UK should: “Continue trying to influence US thinking </p>
<p>on the aftermath, recognising that this is not something which can be neatly separated </p>
<p>from any conflict phase”.</p>
<p><b>1070. </b> Copies of Mr Watkins’ letter were sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Mr Brown, and to Mr Bowen.</p>
<p><b>1071. </b> The discussion within the UK Government on the timetable and triggers </p>
<p>for military action following the adoption of resolution 1441 is addressed in </p>
<p>Sections 3.6 and 5.</p>
<p>UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE NORTHERN OPTION</p>
<p><b>1072.  Adm Boyce decided on 20 November that it would be premature to discuss </b></p>
<p><b>alternative options with the US while the UK was still trying to force a decision from </b></p>
<p><b>Turkey. The northern option remained the firm preference of the Chiefs of Staff. </b></p>
<p><b>1073.  The Chiefs of Staff also asked Lt Gen Reith to look at the option of </b></p>
<p><b>providing two UK brigades.</b></p>
<p><b>1074. </b> On 20 November, the Chiefs of Staff considered the options identified by </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith on 18 November.</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>1075. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were informed that the US had offered the UK a light brigade, </p>
<p>but that was not suitable for the operation in the North. Lt Gen Reith would examine </p>
<p>other options including the provision of two UK triangular brigades. </p>
<p><b>1076. </b> Adm Boyce asked for:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>1077. </b> Adm Boyce “was also clear that while the main effort was to force a decision from </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of the rapid collapse of the Iraqi regime without military action; and </p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>House of Commons debate, 25 November 2002</b></p>
<p>The House of Commons voted on 25 November to “support” resolution 1441 and agreed </p>
<p>that, if the Government of Iraq failed “to comply fully” with its provisions, “the Security </p>
<p>Council should meet in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance”.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p>Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons on 25 November and the subsequent </p>
<p>debate on Iraq, which was opened by Mr Straw, are addressed in Section 3.6.</p>
<p>Before the debate, Mr Hoon agreed with Mr Blair and Mr Straw that, when he closed </p>
<p>the debate, he should address the state of contingency planning, including the potential </p>
<p>requirement for the call&#8209;up of military reserves. That would: </p>
<p>“… be done in a low&#8209;key way, making clear that this was precautionary planning </p>
<p>and that the context was our continued hope that Iraq would disarm peacefully in </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation with the inspectors.”</p>
<p>424</p>
<p>In his speech closing the debate, Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“Neither Britain nor the United States is looking for a pretext for military action, which </p>
<p>is always a grave step, and which will certainly be a last resort. No member of the </p>
<p>Government will risk British lives unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>425</p>
<p>Mr Hoon stated that continuing with “the prudent preparations and planning necessary for </p>
<p>military action” was the “only responsible course”. But that did “not mean a commitment </p>
<p>to take such action in any circumstances”. It did mean that appropriate steps were </p>
<p>being taken “to ensure that British forces” were “ready”, and that they had “the training, </p>
<p>equipment and support” that they would need “to undertake military action, should it prove </p>
<p>necessary”.</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>Addressing the US request to “a number of countries” for “support in the event that military </p>
<p>action proves necessary”, Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“Although no decision has been made to commit UK forces to military action, </p>
<p>discussions with the US will continue so that an appropriate British contribution can </p>
<p>be identified should it prove necessary.</p>
<p>“… There is no inevitability about military action. The US is clear about the fact that </p>
<p>the issue is Iraqi disarmament …</p>
<p>“Those who have accused the US of unilateralism should consider carefully. The </p>
<p>US Government have followed an impeccably multilateral approach, first in building </p>
<p>unanimous Security Council support for resolution 1441 and now in seeking to build </p>
<p>broad&#8209;based support for military action should it be required … within the limits </p>

<p>specific force packages today as if they had some permanent and definitive status </p>

<p><b>forthcoming. </b></p>
<p><b>1089. </b> Maj Gen Fry’s advice, submitted to Adm Boyce on 22 November, suggested that </p>
<p>it would take some four months from the order to deploy for the northern option (whether </p>
<p>Package 2 or 3), and more than five months for the southern option.</p>

<p>429</p>
<p> He asked the Chiefs of Staff to </p>
<p>confirm if it wished the UK to be involved in early action against Iraq and the extent to </p>
<p>which the UK should seek to match US timelines for the northern axis. </p>
<p><b>1091. </b> The paper stated that the UK’s ability to match US timelines for Package 3 and </p>
<p>the Amphibious Ready Group was “in doubt”, but the UK position was “recoverable” if </p>
<p>a range of measures were “taken in the near future to reduce the overall risk and time”. </p>
<p>Early notification of the forces involved and availability of civilian shipping were identified </p>
<p>as the most critical measures.</p>
<p><b>1092. </b> Maj Gen Fry wrote that much of the information had been provided orally and the </p>

<p>341</p>
<p><b>1104. </b> Advice to Mr Hoon on a draft response noted that it:</p>
<p>“… deliberately does not answer directly the question, (which looks like a hospital </p>
<p>pass), whether the COS [Chiefs of Staff] are content with the US plans and ready to </p>
<p>support them … CENTCOM … is keeping options open. It is probably misleading to </p>
<p>think of the US as having firm plans … We also need to beware of allowing the tail </p>
<p>to wag the dog. What we need to know first is whether the US government has a </p>
<p>political plan and strategy with which HMG is content.”</p>
<p>434</p>
<p><b>1105. </b> The MOD advised Sir David Manning on 29 November that it was “misleading </p>
<p>to talk of firm ‘plans’”, not just because of unresolved practical issues such as Turkish </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, but also because the US political strategy remained “unclear”.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1106. </b> There had been “a significant shift in US military planning” as CENTCOM sought </p>
<p>to “reduce the lead times between a political decision and military action”. Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld had signed a number of deployment orders to take effect in early January, </p>
<p>and the US was “increasingly moving beyond pure planning into at least some actual </p>
<p>forward deployments”. That would have the advantages of improving the prospects of </p>
<p>any “running start” operation, and provide better options for a rapid stabilisation mission </p>
<p>in the event that the Iraqi regime suddenly collapsed, while keeping open the possibility </p>
<p>of more deliberate build&#8209;up before the summer of 2003. </p>
<p><b>1107. </b> A “gap” between the UK’s readiness and that of the US was:</p>
<p>“… now beginning to develop … </p>
<p>“… the employment of the amphibious element (yet to be endorsed by the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff) of Package 2 and the additional land contribution in Package 3 are falling </p>
<p>increasingly behind their US counterparts in terms of readiness.” </p>
<p><b>1108. </b> As any steps to close that gap would require “further visible activity”, Ministers </p>
<p>would “need to consider how far they are prepared to go and how they would present </p>
<p>such steps publicly, against a background of continuing uncertainty, including on </p>
<p>Turkey”. </p>
<p><b>1109. </b> The MOD stated that US planning on the North remained “very much work in </p>
<p>progress”, but it was “clear that a UK&#8209;led division could play a significant role, both </p>
<p>during and immediately after conflict”: “But the foundation for this – Turkish acceptance </p>
<p>of a UK force – is not in place.” </p>
<p><b>1110. </b> If Turkey was ruled out:</p>
<p>“… we would need to discuss here and with the US what other role we could play; in </p>
<p>particular, whether … they would be prepared to adjust their timings and sequencing </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Adm Boyce:</p>
<p>“… responded that there was no plan for the South, and that if [Gen] Franks wanted </p>

<p> Mr Straw was warned that the Turkish Government would need the </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 6 December 2002: ‘Iraq: Military Options’</b></p>
<p><b>1117.  A JIC Assessment of Iraq’s military options on 6 December confirmed that </b></p>
<p><b>a massive coalition ground force would be required to be certain of toppling </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein and highlighted the possibility of Iraqi attacks on Coalition </b></p>
<p><b>Forces in the event of a phased start to a military campaign. </b></p>
<p><b>1118. </b> At the request of the MOD, the JIC evaluated Iraq’s military capabilities and “what </p>
<p>military options Iraq has, and which it is likely to pursue a) during Coalition air strikes </p>
<p>and b) during a Coalition ground attack”.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1119. </b> In the JIC discussion on 4 December, the draft was described as “an important </p>
<p>paper which highlighted the gaps in our knowledge”. The judgements were based </p>
<p>“largely on a mixture of observation and past experience”, but the Assessment “did not </p>
<p>quite do justice to the intelligence”; the judgements “could be made more confidently”. </p>
<p>The Assessment needed to bring out more clearly the risks of a phased attack and </p>
<p>unpack the risks involved in possible scenarios, such as the possible use of CBW </p>
<p>before Coalition Forces were properly assembled and urban fighting: “Nothing short of </p>
<p>a massive deployment would guarantee overthrowing the regime.”</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1120. </b> In the Assessment issued on 6 December, the JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would “initially seek international pressure to halt Coalition </p>
<p>[military] action”. If that failed, he would “seek to inflict serious casualties on </p>
<p>Iraq’s neighbours and on coalition forces in order to undermine the Coalition’s </p>
<p>will to fight on”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “would use chemical and biological weapons (CBW) if he </p>
<p>faced defeat. He might also use them earlier in a conflict, including against </p>
<p>coalition forces, neighbouring states and his own people. Israel could be his </p>
<p>first target.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “contingency plans to weather coalition air strikes while maintaining </p>
<p>government control over the country. Iraq’s integrated air defence system would </p>
<p>be overloaded by an all&#8209;out Coalition attack and would quickly become far less </p>
<p>effective …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A ground attack might fracture Saddam’s regime, but only a massive Coalition </p>
<p>force is guaranteed to topple him. The smaller the initial Coalition force, the </p>
<p>more likely Iraqi forces are to resist. A phased Coalition attack could allow Iraq to </p>
<p>claim military successes.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If the Special Republican Guard and Republican Guard [RG] remained loyal </p>
<p>and effective they could inflict serious casualties on Coalition Forces in urban </p>
<p>warfare.” </p>

<p>344</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Other Iraqi responses might include seizing hostages as ‘human shields’; using </p>
<p>non&#8209;lethal BW in a deniable manner; suicide attacks; or a ‘scorched earth’ policy </p>
<p>with the aim of creating a humanitarian or environmental catastrophe. At some </p>
<p>point, motivated by revenge, Saddam would seek to inflict the maximum damage </p>
<p>on his enemies, whether Iraqi or outsiders.”</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1121. </b> The JIC stated that the paper was “not intended to be a comprehensive review of </p>
<p>all Iraq’s options”.</p>
<p><b>1122. </b> The JIC assessed that Saddam Hussein knew that “an Iraqi military victory over </p>
<p>a US&#8209;led Coalition was implausible”. If attacked, he would “initially seek international </p>
<p>pressure to halt Coalition action”. If this failed, he would seek to “drag out the fighting” </p>
<p>and “would be increasingly likely to use chemical or biological weapons … to undermine </p>
<p>the Coalition’s will”. </p>
<p><b>1123. </b> The assessment of Iraq’s ballistic missiles and chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>1124. </b> The JIC assessed Iraq’s options during Coalition air strikes and during a ground </p>
<p>campaign. </p>
<p><b>1125. </b> On the former, the Assessment stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “contingency plans to weather Coalition air strikes while maintaining </p>
<p>government control”, but its air defence system would be overloaded by a </p>
<p>Coalition attack.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi airforce and naval capabilities were “very limited”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq might attack Kurdish areas before a ground attack started for a number of </p>
<p>reasons, including to “divert Coalition air effort” and to “engage in ground fighting </p>
<p>earlier than it had planned”. Iraq’s ground options “would be severely limited” </p>
<p>once the Coalition had established control of the air. </p>
<p><b>1126. </b> A ground attack might fracture Saddam Hussein’s regime, but the JIC continued </p>
<p>to judge that “only massive military force would be guaranteed to topple Saddam”. If the </p>
<p>Coalition pursued a phased campaign (the “rolling attack”), the JIC stated that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would have a number of options. He would “probably seek an opportunity to </p>
<p>inflict casualties” including on internal “enemies” and he would “take advantage of every </p>
<p>opportunity to cause the Coalition political problems”. The JIC judged that the smaller </p>
<p>the initial Coalition force, the more likely Iraqi forces were to resist. </p>
<p><b>1127. </b> The JIC anticipated that the Iraqi army could establish positions within urban </p>
<p>areas, but “most R[egular] A[rmy] defences are likely to be constructed further forward, </p>
<p>nearer Iraq’s borders, or along key roads and at junctions”. Physical barriers, “water </p>
<p>barriers (created by flooding or by the destruction of bridges), minefields, or possibly </p>

<p>even CBW&#8209;contaminated areas”, could be created “to channel Coalition Forces into </p>
<p>urban areas or ‘kill zones where artillery, or CBW, would be used”. </p>
<p><b>1128. </b> Iraq’s “strategy would rely heavily on a static defence, largely because the Iraqi </p>
<p>military’s ability to conduct manoeuvre warfare is very limited, even in the R[epublican </p>
<p>G[uard]”. If Iraqi defensive positions were:</p>
<p>“… left behind the front lines by a rapid coalition advance, many RA units would </p>
<p>probably surrender rather than fight … [P]rovided that the security and military </p>
<p>organisations central to the regime’s survival … remained effective, Saddam would </p>
<p>accept the sacrifice of virtually any forces or territory … Provincial cities would be </p>
<p>defended, but ultimately … only Baghdad would be politically vital, as its capture </p>
<p>would be a final symbol of defeat of the regime. Although Iraqi forces would look for </p>
<p>the opportunity to counter&#8209;attack, only a few RA units and the RG would be capable </p>
<p>of doing so … And we judge that Saddam would not be willing to risk the RG units </p>
<p>held around Baghdad except in a final defence …”</p>
<p><b>1129. </b> The JIC identified that other Iraqi responses might include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seizing foreign hostages as “human shields”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CBW terrorism; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using non&#8209;lethal BW agents in a deniable manner; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>suicide attacks; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “scorched earth” policy with the aim of creating a humanitarian or </p>
<p>environmental catastrophe. </p>
<p><b>1130. </b> The JIC identified the policy implications as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If an attack does not precipitate regime collapse and if Saddam’s key forces </p>
<p>remain loyal, they could inflict damage and casualties on coalition forces, the </p>
<p>Iraqi people or Iraq’s neighbours.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A slow&#8209;start Coalition would increase these risks.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Clear messages to the Iraqi military might reduce their willingness to obey </p>
<p>orders to use CBW, but we cannot rely on this being the case.” </p>

<p><b>Agreement to visible preparations for military action starting </b></p>

<p><b>1132.  On 5 December, the MOD sought Mr Blair’s agreement for further and </b></p>
<p><b>visible preparations to preserve its ability to be ready for an air campaign and </b></p>
<p><b>amphibious operations by early March. </b></p>
<p><b>1133. </b> In response to the instructions issued during and after the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>meeting on 27 November, Lt Gen Reith submitted a paper outlining steps for aligning </p>
<p>the UK’s Force Packages with US timelines, for consideration by the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 4 December.</p>
<p>444</p>
<p> He warned that action was required or the UK might only be able to </p>
<p>offer Package 2, without the Amphibious Task Group; and that Package 3 might have to </p>
<p>be reconfigured. Other preparatory action would be needed “if we do not wish to miss </p>
<p>the boat”. </p>
<p><b>1134. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted on 4 December that decisions on visible preparations </p>
<p>would be required by 7 December to meet a mid&#8209;February timetable for a political </p>
<p>decision in the US.</p>
<p>445</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1135. </b> A member of OD Sec reported to Sir David Manning that “it was clear from </p>
<p>the discussion” that the US was planning for “a hybrid (or ‘ugly’) start to any military </p>
<p>campaign”.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p> Gen Franks was “moving as many assets into theatre as quickly as is </p>
<p>logistically possible, with a view to being in a position to launch military action from the </p>
<p>middle of February”. </p>
<p><b>1136. </b> Mr Watkins wrote again to Sir David Manning on 5 December, setting out what the </p>

<p>447</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1137. </b> Summarising the letter, Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p><b>“… to keep options open for significant UK military participation … we need to </b></p>

<p><b>parliamentary announcement. But many of them would be visible, and our </b></p>
<p><b>presentational posture will need to become more forward leaning.”</b> </p>
<p><b>1138. </b> The US had “no formal position on the date by which they must be ready to act”. </p>
<p>It had a wide range of options, but assuming that a political decision to take military </p>
<p>action on 15 February (known as “P Day”), the MOD expected the air campaign and </p>
<p>amphibious operations to start in early March. The main ground effort would commence </p>

<p>to unfold”. The MOD warned that US forces would reach a peak of readiness in February </p>
<p>and that a “use it or lose it” argument might come into play in Washington.</p>
<p><b>1139. </b> Turkey remained “a key uncertainty”. The MOD understood that basing for US </p>
<p>land forces had not yet been agreed, but “preparatory activity (reconnaissance visits, </p>
<p>etc)”, looked “like at least an amber light”. The Pentagon had told the MOD that Turkey </p>
<p>had given “neither a definite Yes nor a definite No” to UK forces. Mr Straw had received </p>
<p>a “similar response … with some suggestion that their position might depend on the </p>
<p>details of any UK request” (in his discussions on 3 December). Turkey and the UK </p>
<p>“ought to” have bilateral discussions. </p>
<p><b>1140. </b> The MOD was considering with the FCO the “best approach to securing Turkish </p>
<p>agreement, taking into account our wider interests”. The MOD judged that there </p>
<p>was unlikely to be any progress until after the meeting of the European Council in </p>
<p>Copenhagen (12 to 13 December). Action could include a visit by Mr Hoon accompanied </p>
<p>by Adm Boyce, who had “developed a good rapport with his opposite number”, and </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit who would draw on “his extensive experience of Turkey”. </p>
<p><b>1141. </b> It was “increasingly difficult, for both US and UK staffs, to plan and prepare in the </p>
<p>abstract without knowing where the UK land package will be based”. While there were </p>
<p>risks that Turkey could “interpret … UK preparations as taking their acquiescence for </p>
<p>granted”, the UK could not wait for an answer from Turkey if it wished “to remain aligned </p>
<p>with US planning”. Although those preparations were “not particularly tied” to a northern </p>
<p>option, there were presentational risks such as the media concluding that the UK was </p>
<p>“all dressed up with no place to go”. </p>
<p><b>1142. </b> The MOD stated that the steps required to bring the additional air and naval </p>
<p>forces in Package 2 into line with US timescales were “relatively limited”, but a </p>
<p>“significant readiness gap” was developing between US and UK “amphibious and </p>
<p>land forces”. </p>
<p><b>1143. </b> The actions proposed by the MOD included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deploying additional naval forces for “maritime interdiction operations, </p>
<p>force protection, defensive mine warfare and logistics support” around </p>
<p>22 January 2003.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Nominating and informing units in the ATG and bringing their readiness to five </p>
<p>days’ Notice to Move from the beginning of January and chartering four ships to </p>
<p>support the ATG by 19 December, with the intention that it would deploy around </p>
<p>16 January.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bringing the RAF elements of Package 2 to 10 days’ Notice to Move or less </p>
<p>on 27 December, and pre&#8209;positioning weapons and equipment in Turkey on </p>
<p>30 December.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Commencing initial preparations, procurement and training for “earmarked </p>
<p>elements” of the “land package” the following week and placing holding </p>
<p>contracts on commercial shipping by 17 December.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Planning for the mobilisation of Reserves “without actually proceeding to </p>
<p>call&#8209;out”.</p>
<p><b>1144. </b> At that stage:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CENTCOM’s plans for the North required “the lead Division, currently 1 (UK) </p>
<p>Armoured Division” to cross into Turkey in mid&#8209;April, “followed by the US 4th </p>
<p>Infantry Division”. The option needed more work, including the possibility of a US </p>
<p>brigade being seconded to the UK, “so the precise composition of the UK land </p>
<p>package will have to be kept under review”. But as it had “the longest lead&#8209;time </p>
<p>of all”, action to improve its readiness could not be delayed if the UK was “to </p>
<p>have any chance of being ready from mid&#8209;February onwards”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ATG comprised a Royal Marine Commando Group and HM Ships Ocean </p>
<p>and Ark Royal, two destroyers or frigates, three Landing Ships Logistic (LSL) </p>
<p>and support ships, which would operate (with the US) to conduct operations in </p>
<p>the Northern Gulf and ashore from the beginning of the air campaign. </p>
<p><b>1145. </b> The MOD warned that the steps would become visible and that the “current </p>
<p>low&#8209;key” media handling which was “operating at the limits of credibility, would need to </p>
<p>be replaced with a rather more pro&#8209;active approach”. The preparations would also need </p>
<p>to be “viewed in the wider political context … not least the progress of inspections and </p>
<p>their reports to the UNSC, and the continuous assessment of Iraqi compliance”. </p>
<p><b>1146. </b> The letter concluded that, unless the UK was “prepared now to foreclose military </p>
<p>options”, Mr Hoon believed “that we need to proceed with the further preparatory steps” </p>
<p>identified. That was “a question of cocking the pistol, not firing it” and the timelines </p>
<p>would be adjusted if the US “were to shift its focus to later in 2003”. But the UK could not </p>
<p>“afford to lose any more time if we are to have a chance of re&#8209;aligning our readiness with </p>
<p>that of US forces”. </p>
<p><b>1147. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Brown, </p>
<p>and to Mr Bowen.</p>
<p><b>1148. </b> In relation to Turkey, Sir David Manning commented: </p>
<p>“Recent indications on other channels are that Turks are very reluctant to budge on </p>
<p>UK forces.”</p>

<p>449</p>
<p><b>1150. </b> Mr Hoon also assured the House that:</p>
<p>“… no military decisions whatsoever have been taken on military action against Iraq. </p>
<p>That situation will be reported to the House should it change.”</p>
<p><b>1151. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I … briefed Geoff Hoon … early in the week that we had until Friday to go to </p>
<p>trade for ships; otherwise, we wouldn’t meet the window that the Americans were </p>
<p>potentially looking at before the real heat of the summer came in, in 2003. He said </p>
<p>to me ‘You have been telling me … week by week that we have to do this, and now </p>
<p>you are telling me you are giving me another deadline.’ I said, ‘this is the deadline’. </p>
<p>He said ‘You know, we need to keep our options open’ … I said ‘Well, actually if we </p>
<p>don’t go to trade by the end of this week, then we don’t have any options, we are </p>
<p>not going’. He then went to the Prime Minister and we were then authorised to go </p>
<p>to trade.”</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>1152. </b> On 10 December, Mr Johnson advised Mr Hoon on the options in the event of </p>
<p>an “ugly start” and land force options if Turkey did not agree to transit.</p>
<p>451</p>
<p><b>1153. </b> The land force options were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces with the US main effort in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a follow&#8209;on force after the US main effort in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ground forces only for the aftermath; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not providing ground forces at all. </p>
<p><b>1154. </b> Mr Johnson advised that only the first option would provide “the sort of high profile </p>
<p>role in war&#8209;fighting on the ground which we have previously judged important”.</p>
<p><b>1155. </b> Mr Johnson also wrote that there were limits to what could be done to improve </p>
<p>readiness before a clear political decision. Calling out Reservists and deploying some </p>
<p>force elements and equipment as soon as they were available would start “to use up </p>
<p>some of our one&#8209;shot capabilities”. That:</p>
<p>“… would cause us problems if it turned out that the campaign was not going to start </p>
<p>until later in the year. Deploying early also runs the risk of finding later that we are in </p>
<p>the wrong locations.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>1156. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit commented that advice to Mr Hoon rather underplayed “the </p>
<p>issues surrounding the Amphibious Force and the point that they will probably be there </p>
<p>earlier for an ‘ugly’ [start] than ground forces”.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1157.  Sir David Manning drew Mr Blair’s attention to the uncertainties if </b></p>
<p><b>operations started before mid&#8209;February or Turkey refused to agree to the transit </b></p>
<p><b>of UK troops.</b></p>
<p><b>1158. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair that the “two key working assumptions” were </p>
<p>that “US forces must be ready to move by 15 February”, and that they would be “able to </p>
<p>transit Turkey”.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> The February date was “a guess”, but it fitted with what he had been </p>
<p>told by Dr Rice “about putting pressure on Saddam and resolving the Iraqi issue sooner </p>
<p>rather than later”. Sir David’s view was that Turkey would probably agree to the transit </p>
<p>of US forces “in the end” but it was “not at all certain that agreement to US transit will </p>
<p>extend to [the] UK”.</p>
<p><b>1159. </b> Sir David recommended that Mr Blair authorise the MOD to proceed, although </p>
<p>he commented that the letter was “silent on two major uncertainties”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what would happen if Saddam provoked a start earlier than 15 February; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether there was a Plan B for UK forces in the event that Turkey refused </p>
<p>transit.</p>
<p><b>1160. </b> Sir David also raised concerns about the MOD’s media handling strategy which </p>
<p>he thought they should discuss with Mr Campbell. </p>
<p><b>1161. </b> Sir David proposed that Mr Blair should discuss the issues with Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>possibly Adm Boyce after his (Sir David’s) return from Washington: </p>
<p>“In particular, they [the MOD] need to explain how we handle ‘ugly’ start; and what </p>
<p>we do if the Turks won’t let us deploy for the northern option.”</p>
<p><b>1162. </b> Mr Blair authorised the preparatory steps requested, including those relating to </p>
<p>land forces, but asked that there should be “no change in media handling until a media </p>
<p>strategy has been drawn up and agreed with No.10”.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1163. </b> Mr Blair also asked for a meeting with Mr Hoon explicitly to discuss how the UK </p>
<p>“would handle a possible ‘ugly start’, and what our options would be for UK land forces </p>
<p>if Turkey refused transit”. </p>

<p><b>1176. </b> Advice submitted to the Chiefs of Staff on 19 September stated:</p>
<p>“Within the maritime element of Package 2 the Amphibious Ready Group with </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>1180. </b> Lt Gen Reith stated that it “would bring considerable strategic exposure for the </p>
<p>UK at the earliest stage of the campaign”. It “was consistent with UK objectives” and </p>
<p>provided “valuable strategic, operational and presentational effect”.</p>
<p><b>1181. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that US ground operations against Iraq in the South were </p>
<p>“now planned to commence simultaneously with the air campaign” and the US intention </p>
<p>was to establish a second Sea Point of Disembarkation at Umm Qasr. This was </p>
<p>“essential” to allow the rapid build&#8209;up of forces. The US plan entailed securing the “oil </p>
<p>nodes”, the capture of Umm Qasr and the al&#8209;Faw peninsula, and clearance of mines in </p>
<p>the Khawr Abd Allah (KAA) waterway. </p>
<p><b>1182. </b> The plan had been developed with UK input, was “well advanced”, and was </p>
<p>“heavily reliant” on the UK to achieve its aims. The ATG “would be based around” </p>
<p>40 Commando Group and the plan envisaged a two company helicopter&#8209;borne </p>
<p>amphibious assault capability. The ATG’s landing craft would “provide flexibility” a </p>
<p>“simultaneous … surface assault”, but it was “more likely to be used for logistic support”.</p>
<p><b>1183. </b> On 11 December, Maj Gen Fry advised the Chiefs of Staff that:</p>
<p>“The operation had important economic and environmental strands as well as </p>
<p>being militarily essential. UK participation would enable the operation to complete </p>
<p>10 days sooner than if the US went alone and would ensure UK participation in land </p>
<p>operations at P+ a few days, well ahead of the Main Effort in the North at P+60 … </p>
<p>For the operation to go forward, the areas of risk that needed to be managed were </p>
<p>SH [support helicopters] and Medical … The SH risk was not to be underestimated, </p>
<p>but should be managed by sequencing … Until the TU [Turkey] question was </p>
<p>resolved, an operation in the North was a complete uncertainty and, by accepting </p>
<p>risk on SH, the ATG task would ensure UK land participation.”</p>
<p>464</p>
<p><b>1184. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed that committing the ATG would ensure the UK’s </p>
<p>participation in operations, although there would be risks if support helicopters were </p>
<p>needed for operations in both the North and South. </p>
<p><b>1185. </b> Adm Boyce directed that a submission to Mr Hoon should be prepared </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>1188. </b> The details of the proposal were set out in a minute to Mr Hoon’s Private Office </p>
<p>on 11 December.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1189. </b> Mr Hoon was advised that the ATG would “make a significant difference to </p>
<p>the viability of the US plan”. US ground operations were “now planned” to begin </p>
<p>simultaneously with the air campaign, and that a second point of disembarkation was </p>
<p>required “to enhance logistic flow and to prevent Iraqi destruction of key oil production </p>
<p>and distribution nodes”. That required the capture of Umm Qasr and the al&#8209;Faw </p>
<p>Peninsula and the clearance of mines from the Khawr Abd Allah waterway. US planning </p>
<p>for the operation had “developed with UK input”, and was “well advanced”. Unless the </p>
<p>role was undertaken by the ATG, the US would have to “divert other forces, at a cost </p>
<p>of several days’ delay and increased risk”, including a “strategic delay” to US follow&#8209;on </p>
<p>operations in Basra and crossing the Euphrates, and an increased risk of the destruction </p>
<p>of oil supplies.</p>
<p><b>1190. </b> Iraqi options for defending the peninsula and hampering Coalition maritime forces </p>
<p>included land&#8209;based anti&#8209;ship missiles, some artillery and mortar capability. An Iraqi </p>
<p>troop presence of some 2,000&#8209;3,000 could “in theory be reinforced by the Iraqi 51st </p>
<p>Mechanised Division based at az&#8209;Zubayr and al&#8209;Basra” but the US plan was “designed </p>
<p>to prevent such reinforcement being attempted”. If it were attempted, “coalition forces </p>
<p>should be able to defeat it with ease”. </p>
<p><b>1191. </b> Mr Hoon was advised that the ATG would be “based around 40 Commando </p>
<p>Group embarked in HMS Ocean, supported by HMS Ark Royal” and other ships. The </p>
<p>force would be commanded by a Royal Navy officer, “who would command both the </p>
<p>amphibious and MCM elements of the ATG”. It “was possible, subject to further work” </p>
<p>that US forces “could be placed under UK command”. </p>
<p><b>1192. </b> Mr Hoon was also advised that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Previous concerns that it might not be possible to support the ATG concurrently </p>
<p>with other elements of the UK force packages … have been assuaged. Although </p>
<p>supporting resources will be stretched, the stretch is judged to be manageable.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further work was “looking at the possibility of making a second RM Commando </p>
<p>available for follow&#8209;on or aftermath operations”. </p>
<p><b>1193. </b> Mr Hoon was asked to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>note that the Chiefs of Staff had endorsed securing the al&#8209;Faw Peninsula and </p>
<p>mine clearance operations as “a role for the ATG, judging that it would be </p>
<p>consistent with UK objectives and provide valuable strategic, operational and </p>

<p>468</p>
<p> Mr Hoon had “mentioned this” to Mr Blair on 11 December. </p>
<p><b>1198. </b> The MOD stated that the ATG, and 40 Commando Group Royal Marines, would </p>
<p>play a key role “on Day 1 of offensive operations”, for operations:</p>
<p>“… possibly of high intensity and could bring forward the decisive employment </p>
<p>of armoured forces by up to 10 days. It also reduces the risk of destruction of oil </p>
<p>infrastructure and the associated environmental damage. It has strategic and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>1202. </b> Mr Hoon announced contingency preparations and the planned deployment of </p>
<p>a naval task group on 18 December.</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>1203. </b> At Cabinet on 19 December, Mr Hoon informed his colleagues that it was </p>
<p>“increasingly necessary to make visible preparations” and that “a naval task group led </p>
<p>by HMS Ark Royal would depart for exercises”. The US had not yet finalised its military </p>
<p>planning but it was “already building up a formidable force and would be ready to </p>
<p>use it”.</p>
<p>471</p>
<p><b>1204. </b> The Cabinet Conclusions contain no reference to the deployment of the ATG, </p>
<p>the deployment of a Royal Marine Commando Group, or the role they might play.</p>
<p><b>1205. </b> Mr Blair said that “there would be an opportunity to discuss Iraq in the New Year”.</p>
<p><b>1206. </b> Mr Straw’s report to Cabinet on 19 December, on Iraq’s declaration in response </p>
<p>to resolution 1441 and the next steps for the weapons inspectors, are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 3.6.</p>
<p><b>1207. </b> In a minute on 30 December, primarily dealing with land options, Mr Hoon was </p>
<p>informed that: “Unless otherwise instructed, the Amphibious Task Group (ATG) will begin </p>
<p>to deploy from 16 January …”</p>
<p>472</p>
<p><b>1208. </b> The deployment of the ATG was announced on 7 January 2003.</p>
<p>473</p>
<p><b>1209.  The deployment of 3 Commando Brigade was seen as a way for the UK </b></p>
<p><b>to make a valuable contribution to the land campaign if transit through Turkey </b></p>
<p><b>was refused.</b></p>
<p><b>1210.  When 3 Commando Brigade deployed into action, however, the landings </b></p>
<p><b>did not go entirely as planned. That is addressed in Section 8.</b></p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon’s statement, 18 December 2002</b></p>
<p><b>1211. </b> Mr Hoon made a further statement on contingency preparations for military </p>
<p>operations against Iraq to Parliament on 18 December.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1212. </b> Mr Hoon reported that he had “authorised a range of steps to improve readiness”. </p>
<p>He also referred to the planned deployment of a naval task group in early 2003 to the </p>
<p>Gulf and Asia&#8209;Pacific region for visits and exercises. That was “a routine deployment” </p>
<p>that happened about every three years, but it remained “available for a range of </p>
<p>potential operations if required”. The task group would be led by HMS Ark Royal and a </p>
<p>nuclear&#8209;powered submarine would be “assigned to the group for part of its deployment”. </p>

<p>“In addition, a mine countermeasures group” would deploy ahead of the group “to </p>
<p>undertake a series of exercises and port visits in the Gulf region”.</p>
<p><b>1213. </b> Mr Hoon added that the UK was also considering the deployment of “additional </p>
<p>maritime forces early in the new year to ensure the readiness of a broad range of </p>
<p>maritime capabilities, should they be required”.</p>
<p><b>Continued pursuit of the northern option</b></p>
<p><b>1214.  Mr Hoon was advised on 11 December not to push the issue with Turkey </b></p>
<p><b>until early January, and that the</b> <b>UK was likely to face increasing US pressure to </b></p>
<p><b>look at other options.</b></p>
<p><b>1215. </b> Mr Bowen, who had attended the briefing for Mr Hoon on 11 December, reported </p>
<p>to Sir David Manning that Adm Boyce had informed Mr Hoon that the absence of a </p>
<p>northern front was not now regarded as a showstopper.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> He added that “the one </p>
<p>certainty appears to be that an extra 45 days must be allowed for deployment if planning </p>
<p>were to switch from the North to the South”.</p>
<p><b>1216. </b> Further advice on Turkey, including options for high level UK visits and actions </p>
<p>after the Copenhagen Summit was provided for Mr Hoon on 11 December.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1217. </b> Mr Johnson wrote that: “We need clarity as soon as possible” because if the </p>
<p>response was positive it would take some time to “thrash out all the practical details” </p>
<p>and, if the response was negative, alternatives needed to be considered. </p>
<p><b>1218. </b> Mr Johnson advised that: “We should not push the issue hard until the Turks have </p>
<p>said Yes to the US request”. Mr Hoon’s visit scheduled for 6 to 8 January looked like </p>
<p>the right opportunity. If Mr Hoon did decide to “push the issue hard” then “experience </p>
<p>(eg over ISAF) suggests that only high&#8209;level engagement is likely to make a difference”. </p>
<p><b>1219. </b> On “handling” Turkey, Mr Johnson stated that the northern option “came from our </p>
<p>strategic analysis in the first place” and that deployment timelines were: “45 days’ [sic] </p>
<p>shorter than to the South (though we could in theory solve this problem by buying up </p>
<p>more sealift)”. Assuming a political decision was made on 15 February, “air elements” </p>
<p>would be in action from early March and the main ground effort from mid&#8209;April. Although </p>
<p>the UK would want to pre&#8209;position air weapons at the end of the year, it “would not need </p>
<p>to deploy additional air and ground forces until 15 February”. Turkey was less likely to </p>
<p>help the UK than the US. </p>

<p>358</p>
<p><b>1220. </b> Addressing the option of dropping the northern option and telling the US that the </p>
<p>UK wanted to switch to the South, Mr Johnson’s minute stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Advantages: Reduces risk of wasting our time and getting bogged down </p>
<p>in negotiation. Improves chances of getting into the South in time for </p>
<p>February/March.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Disadvantages: Although General Franks has said that he will fit us into the </p>
<p>South if required, we have no US political guarantee that they will fix it, or that </p>
<p>they will give us a role in the main effort. And it would perhaps be odd to rule </p>
<p>Turkey out when we have not asked them the question ourselves.” </p>
<p><b>1221. </b> The minute advised that the US priority would be getting its own forces into </p>
<p>Turkey. The UK was “likely to come under increasing US pressure to look at going </p>
<p>elsewhere”. As time passed, the US might “feel less bound to try and meet our </p>
<p>preferences for a substantial role in the South”.</p>
<p><b>1222. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit commented on a draft of the note that “depending on how </p>
<p>Copenhagen goes, plus CDS soundings of [General Hilmi] Özkök [Chief of the General </p>
<p>Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces]”, Mr Hoon would need to visit and that he would </p>
<p>probably accompany him.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1223. </b> Sir Kevin wrote that European forces on Turkish soil would be “harder” for them </p>
<p>than US forces, although Turkey was “better disposed” towards the UK. Other issues </p>
<p>included the impact on Turkey’s relations with the Kurds and the UK’s attitude to the </p>
<p>Kurds in 1920&#8209;32. </p>

<p>would take 129 days for deployment to Turkey to be completed. The UK was “likely to be </p>

<p>359</p>
<p>Objectives, underpinned by a section identifying the objectives and themes of such </p>
<p>a campaign. </p>
<p><b>1228. </b> The paper included a new analysis on urban operations in Iraq, which were </p>
<p>described as “the ‘vital ground’ of any campaign against Iraq”. In contrast with the </p>
<p>analysis in the previous version of the paper, the SPG stated that it would “not be </p>
<p>possible, or desirable” for land operations “to avoid towns and cities”, where: “Any </p>
<p>factional conflict following regime collapse or during the aftermath” was likely to take </p>
<p>place. Baghdad would be “a special case”. </p>
<p><b>1229. </b> Addressing the Coalition response, the paper stated that it could not:</p>
<p>“… engage in drawn out urban conflict since it lacks the experience training and </p>
<p>specialist equipment to do so without heavy casualties. Such casualties, combined </p>
<p>with loss of tempo and humanitarian effects may undermine coalition will to continue </p>
<p>by alienating home, international and regional supporters.” </p>
<p><b>1230. </b> The paper identified the need to understand the “infrastructure, culture, </p>
<p>population, terrain, threats” in cities and commented that the US had invested thousands </p>
<p>of man hours in analysing Baghdad, “but that relatively little work has been done on </p>
<p>Tikrit, a city more likely to be the responsibility of those on the northern axis”.</p>
<p><b>1231. </b> The SPG identified information operations and physical separation and the </p>
<p>control of movement into and out of cities as “key conditions” for engagement. </p>
<p><b>1232. </b> The paper also added an objective to develop a “broad military alliance </p>
<p>against Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>1233. </b> The SPG identified the post&#8209;conflict phase as “strategically decisive” and called </p>
<p>for it to be “adequately addressed” in any winning concept. That is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 6.4.</p>

<p><b>1235.  Options for enhancing the Amphibious Task Group and deploying a second </b></p>
<p><b>light brigade and follow&#8209;on forces should also be developed for the South.</b> </p>
<p><b>1236. </b> Submitting a paper on “Land Options” on 16 December, Lt Gen Reith stated: “The </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>1237. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were invited to agree that participation in the land campaign </p>
<p>was “consistent with UK objectives” and to endorse the “approach to the delivery of a </p>
<p>heavy or light land package”. </p>
<p><b>1238. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that a UK contribution from the North remained the </p>
<p>preferred course of action; but the “constraints of Op FRESCO dictate that the best force </p>
<p>package available is based on a divisional headquarters and a single high readiness UK </p>
<p>brigade”, with a second brigade provided by the US. The disadvantage would be that it </p>
<p>would lack manoeuvre capability.</p>
<p><b>1239. </b> The UK could not deploy a heavy force to the South quickly enough to meet the </p>
<p>expected US timeline for the start of offensive operations, and “a UK contribution for </p>
<p>Phase 3 combat operations could only be achieved by light forces”.</p>
<p><b>1240. </b> Lt Gen Reith added:</p>
<p>“The UK could mount two light brigades, potentially commanded at divisional level, </p>
<p>although the US would prefer to deploy them separately under US control.”</p>
<p><b>1241. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised the Chiefs of Staff that the heavy and light force options </p>
<p>were “mutually exclusive”; and that a decision on which to deploy was “wholly dependent </p>
<p>on confirmation of the Turkish position and must be made no later than 15 Jan[uary] … </p>
<p>to allow the light force to be generated in time”.</p>
<p><b>1242. </b> In the detailed paper, Lt Gen Reith stated that the US plan for the northern axis </p>
<p>had “enhanced the role of the UK division” and the UK’s tactical analysis confirmed that </p>
<p>a minimum of two brigades would be required for the northern option. </p>
<p><b>1243. </b> The constraints of Op FRESCO and the likely US timetable meant that the </p>
<p>best option the UK could provide comprised a divisional headquarters, an armoured </p>
<p>brigade of four battlegroups, a manoeuvre support task force (MSTF) built around a </p>
<p>second brigade headquarters with combat support elements, and the 2nd Light Cavalry </p>
<p>Regiment offered by the US. That would require the deployment of “circa 30,000” </p>
<p>UK personnel. </p>
<p><b>1244. </b> If Turkey did not co&#8209;operate and the UK still wished “to make a significant and </p>
<p>early contribution to operations against Iraq”, the UK could deploy two light brigades and </p>
<p>possibly a divisional headquarters for the southern axis. </p>
<p><b>1245. </b> One light brigade would be based on an expanded ATG, comprising the </p>
<p>Headquarters of 3 Commando Brigade and “up to three battalions”. The headquarters </p>
<p>and one commando group (based on 40 Commando Group) could be in place by the </p>
<p>end of February. The remaining units would be deployed by air. </p>
<p><b>1246. </b> A second brigade would be based on 16 Air Assault Brigade, with up to three </p>
<p>battalions. </p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>1247. </b> There was also a possibility of deploying additional high readiness forces and the </p>
<p>US had asked for additional logistics support. </p>
<p><b>1248. </b> If a decision was taken by 15 January, UK combat forces could be in the theatre </p>
<p>by late March. </p>
<p><b>1249. </b> The disadvantages of that option would be that the UK would “potentially, not hold </p>
<p>its own area of responsibility or operate at the divisional level of command”, and 16 Air </p>
<p>Assault Brigade would need to be extracted from Op FRESCO duties.</p>
<p><b>1250. </b> On 18 December, Lt Gen Reith informed the Chiefs of Staff that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had identified 15 February as the optimum date for combat operations </p>
<p>and was seeking to bring together the start of the air and ground campaigns.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US campaign plan had: “changed to an information operation supported by </p>
<p>manoeuvre rather than vice versa. The centre of gravity was now the oilfields </p>
<p>rather than Baghdad. Securing the oilfields would provide a means of funding </p>
<p>Phase IV operations and the rebuilding of the infrastructure. It would also help </p>
<p>avert an environmental disaster …”</p>
<p>480</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1251. </b> In discussion of the “Land Options” paper, Gen Walker took the view that a UK </p>
<p>division operating alone in the North “represented the most sensible military solution, </p>
<p>but accepted that Op FRESCO commitments precluded it from being taken in its present </p>
<p>form”; it was likely to be available only for Phase IV operations. </p>
<p><b>1252. </b> The Chiefs of Staff endorsed Lt Gen Reith’s request to take forward exploratory </p>
<p>work on options for the South.</p>
<p><b>1253. </b> The Chiefs of Staff also discussed a paper by Maj Gen Fry on the provision of a </p>
<p>UK stabilisation force in the event of early military or regime collapse leading to a “loss </p>
<p>of control”.</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1254. </b> Maj Gen Fry defined “early collapse” as the collapse of the Iraqi regime less than </p>
<p>60 days after the political decision to take military action (“P Day”), and “loss of control” </p>
<p>as “the period between the collapse of the Iraqi regime and the establishment of an </p>
<p>effective alternative providing law and order and security”. </p>
<p><b>1255. </b> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Rapid intervention by the Coalition may be required to stabilise the situation, </p>
<p>including support to an interim government. Current Package 3 deployment </p>
<p>timelines would limit the arrival of sufficient and appropriate UK military capability in </p>
<p>time. Consequently there is a need to develop a contingency plan that would enable </p>

<p>the UK to gain an early footprint on the ground, providing influence in theatre and </p>
<p>achieving strategic impact.”</p>
<p>If the collapse happened after more than 60 days, the UK land component would have </p>
<p>reached full operating capability and would deal with the situation. </p>
<p><b>1256. </b> Maj Gen Fry advised that, in order to provide a quick response, the stabilisation </p>
<p>force was “likely to be light” and its role limited to “wider peacekeeping and ‘stabilisation’ </p>
<p>tasks”. Those included controlling and denying access to WMD, security at key </p>
<p>locations, disarmament and demobilisation. The paper set out a number of options </p>
<p>for different scenarios.</p>
<p><b>1257. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting, Lt Gen Reith commented that any stabilisation </p>
<p>force would depend on timing and availability of resources, and that there was a synergy </p>
<p>between the southern option and a stabilisation force.</p>
<p><b>1258. </b> The minutes of the Chiefs of Staff meeting included a “Post Meeting Note” </p>
<p>stating that the commitment to Operation FRESCO might be reduced by “some 2,000 </p>
<p>personnel”, and: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The option recommended by Lt Gen Reith was not the preferred northern option, </p>
<p>and a force package based on two UK high readiness brigades, each with three </p>
<p>battlegroups, should be developed further, with the aim of providing a second </p>
<p>manoeuvre “element”, within a manpower ceiling of about 33,000. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Options for enhancing the Amphibious Task Group, and additional options for </p>
<p>the South which would consider the utility of a second light brigade and the </p>
<p>deployment of follow&#8209;on forces, should also be developed.</p>

<p>US ground operations would be synchronised as closely as possible with the beginning </p>
<p>of air operations, which it was judged would lead to the rapid collapse of much potential </p>
<p>opposition.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1262. </b> In addition, the US was now thinking of “an information operation supported by </p>
<p>manoeuvre, rather than a manoeuvre operation supported by information operation”. </p>
<p>Control of Iraq’s oilfields (North and South), rather than control of Baghdad, was seen </p>
<p>as the strategic key to control of Iraq. It would prevent the Iraqi regime from using oil </p>
<p>as a weapon to cause a humanitarian and environmental catastrophe. </p>
<p><b>1263. </b> It would also be essential to fund reconstruction. The US now recognised that </p>
<p>stabilisation and reconstruction of up to two thirds of Iraq would need to begin before the </p>
<p>military campaign had concluded. This was “bringing home to the US military the need </p>
<p>for more planning effort to be devoted to ‘aftermath’ issues now”.</p>
<p><b>1264. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Brown, </p>
<p>and to Mr Bowen.</p>
<p><b>1265. </b> The US plan for a military campaign, including that the Coalition would not fight </p>
<p>for Baghdad in the initial phase of combat operations, is addressed in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>1266. </b> The MOD had not yet reached a conclusion on the alternative options if Turkey </p>
<p>refused transit.</p>
<p><b>1267. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that, in the light of reports about the latest US </p>
<p>military planning, the UK was “anxious about whether this was the right approach”.</p>

<p>485</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1269. </b> Mr Watkins highlighted “the continuing emphasis in US military planning on </p>
<p>squeezing every possible day out of their timelines, both in preparation for and in the </p>
<p>prosecution of any campaign”. As a result, the UK assumptions about detailed timings </p>
<p>were “potentially subject to acceleration at short notice”. Keeping options open was:</p>
<p>“… likely to require visible steps early in the New Year … including a first call&#8209;out of </p>
<p>reserves in the first half of January and high profile maritime deployments around </p>
<p>the middle of the month.”</p>
<p><b>1270. </b> An early conclusion on whether the UK could deploy through Turkey “and thus </p>
<p>on the shape of the UK land contribution” was also needed.</p>
<p><b>1271. </b> Mr Watkins concluded that there would be “an increasingly pressing need to </p>
<p>satisfy ourselves that the US has an overarching political strategy with which the </p>

<p>Government is content”. If that envisaged military action in the timescales to which US </p>
<p>military planners were working, there would be a need to address campaign objectives. </p>
<p>That would be “necessary to fill the current gap between” the UK’s “existing policy </p>
<p>objectives and the likely nature of any US&#8209;led military operations, the scale and intensity </p>
<p>of which should not be underestimated”. </p>
<p><b>1272. </b> The MOD provided seven annexes with more detailed information.</p>
<p><b>1273. </b> Annex A addressed “Evolving US military thinking”.</p>
<p><b>1274. </b> Annex B, addressing UK military preparations, stated that there was a need </p>
<p>to identify and address shortfalls in manpower and equipment in units nominated for </p>
<p>operations, and that they would require significant training. </p>
<p><b>1275. </b> In addition, the MOD:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had approached the market to charter shipping; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was making preparations for call&#8209;out of Reserves.</p>
<p><b>1276. </b> Annex C provided a snapshot of current UK and US force levels in the region </p>
<p>and a projection of the probable build&#8209;up of forces based on Package 3 as currently </p>
<p>endorsed and the ATG with 3 Commando Brigade. The ATG was now planned to be in </p>
<p>theatre by mid&#8209;February and would transit the Suez canal 15 days earlier than previously </p>
<p>planned; 7 Armoured Brigade could be in theatre by mid&#8209;March, but deployment of the </p>
<p>full Package 3 would take a further 30 days. </p>
<p><b>1277. </b> Annexes D and E, setting out the UK force packages originally approved by </p>
<p>Ministers and an update on the ATG, stated that the MOD had strengthened the </p>
<p>amphibious element of the force to include the Headquarters of 3 Commando Brigade, </p>
<p>which would command both UK and US forces, and earmarked 42 Commando Group, </p>
<p>to deploy by air after the ATG if required. The ATG was due to depart from the UK from </p>
<p>16 January. HMS Ark Royal would deploy as a second helicopter landing platform </p>
<p>without its fast jets. </p>
<p><b>1278. </b> Sir David was told the options for the land contribution were “under review”; and </p>
<p>that: “There are some large and difficult issues here.”</p>
<p><b>1279. </b> Annex F was a “short note” on the options. It described Package 3, “previously </p>
<p>endorsed by Ministers for planning purposes” as “a divisional HQ commanding a single </p>
<p>square armoured brigade with appropriate divisional and logistic support”, and that the </p>
<p>MOD had assumed “for some time” the US would provide a similar brigade. The US had </p>
<p>“now decided” to offer a lighter regiment, but that would mean the UK&#8209;led division would </p>
<p>be “unbalanced, and its mission … more risky”. </p>

<p><b>1280. </b> The MOD was “therefore” looking at alternatives, which would take account of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The scope for releasing sufficient units from Op FRESCO to allow “Package 3 </p>
<p>to be reconfigured for operations in the North as a division of two brigades”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Options for embedding a single … brigade in a US division (North or South)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Options for the South where further work was needed to assess whether an </p>
<p>armoured formation could be delivered “within US timelines, and to consider </p>
<p>alternatives involving lighter forces”.</p>
<p><b>1281. </b> The MOD could not be “fully confident” that it had “a conclusion on these </p>
<p>choices”. </p>
<p><b>1282. </b> Annex G was a copy of the 13 December SPG paper, ‘UK Military Strategic </p>

<p><b>1285.  Mr Hoon was informed on 20 December that UK plans were being reviewed </b></p>

<p><b>1286.  The military’s preferred option would be to deploy two UK brigades for </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>that it would be more difficult to get clearance for a UK deployment through Turkey than </p>
<p>for a US one. </p>
<p><b>1291. </b> In response to a question from Gen Ralston about whether the UK would </p>
<p>contribute forces for deployment through Turkey, Adm Boyce said that “the critical path </p>
<p>was for the US to negotiate access with Turkey first”. </p>
<p><b>1292. </b> On 19 December, Lt Gen Reith submitted a revised paper on the land options, </p>
<p>to the Chiefs of Staff for discussion in a meeting chaired by Adm Boyce the following </p>
<p>afternoon.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1293. </b> Lt Gen Reith reported increased US optimism that the Iraqi regime would </p>
<p>collapse “early” and a desire to achieve the “closest possible coincidence” between the </p>
<p>start of the air and ground campaigns. That would require earlier readiness for ground </p>
<p>forces. There was some scepticism about the practicality of achieving a target date of </p>
<p>mid&#8209;February in the North, but an attack in the North might begin “much earlier than </p>
<p>has previously been expected”, which Lt Gen Reith recommended the UK should aim </p>
<p>to meet. </p>
<p><b>1294. </b> The North remained the favoured option for UK land operations. Package 3 had </p>
<p>been expanded to comprise a divisional HQ, two brigades, each with three battlegroups, </p>
<p>and a total force level of 32,000. That would mean penalties for Op FRESCO. </p>
<p><b>1295. </b> The paper also identified an option of contributing a single brigade, of four </p>
<p>battlegroups, to a US formation before deployment of the full division. That would need </p>
<p>about 25,000 personnel.</p>
<p><b>1296. </b> In the South, 16 Air Assault Brigade and 3 Commando Brigade could initially </p>
<p>operate under the command of a US division. For the former, units would need to </p>
<p>be withdrawn from Op FRESCO. Both brigades were seen as having options for </p>
<p>war&#8209;fighting and stabilisation roles. Preparations for the deployment of 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade would depend on a decision not to deploy a division in the North no later </p>
<p>than 15 January, “the last safe moment for a decision to switch the main effort from </p>
<p>a northern axis”. </p>
<p><b>1297. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that a “heavy” brigade could not arrive in the South before </p>
<p>the middle of April and further time would be needed for readiness and integration. </p>
<p>It would have “particular utility for post&#8209;conflict operations”. </p>
<p><b>1298. </b> If a UK division was deployed to the North, 1 (UK) Div HQ would take command; </p>
<p>for other options, 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division would take the lead. </p>
<p><b>1299. </b> Lt Gen Reith also recorded that he had been directed to add 42 Commando and </p>
<p>HQ 3 Commando Brigade to the Amphibious Task Group. </p>

<p><b>1300. </b> Mr Johnson alerted Mr Hoon to the potential need for early decisions on </p>
<p>20 December.</p>
<p>490</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1301. </b> Mr Johnson wrote that Package 3 was being reviewed in the light of changes </p>
<p>in US force plans. Adm Boyce, Gen Walker and Lt Gen Reith recommended that an </p>
<p>option with two UK brigades each with three battlegroups should be the preferred option; </p>
<p>although it would require 4,000&#8209;5,000 more personnel than the “currently endorsed </p>
<p>package of 28,000”, and a change to Op FRESCO plans. </p>
<p><b>1302. </b> Mr Hoon was advised “we should have reached a conclusion on Turkey by the </p>
<p>middle of January”. An alternative option of deploying one brigade of four battlegroups </p>
<p>to be integrated within the US 4th Infantry Division had also been identified. Planning </p>
<p>could be calibrated to allow a switch to that option if the deployment of a division was </p>
<p>ruled out.</p>
<p><b>1303. </b> The work on possible options in the South was not addressed in the minute. </p>
<p><b>1304. </b> In preparation for a telephone conversation with Adm Boyce on 22 December, </p>
<p>Mr Watkins sent Mr Hoon a handwritten minute setting out the background to </p>
<p>Mr Johnson’s minute, which had been received late on 20 December following a meeting </p>
<p>between Adm Boyce and Lt Gen Reith.</p>
<p>491</p>
<p><b>1305. </b> Mr Watkins advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Johnson’s minute did not seek any decisions, but Adm Boyce was “looking </p>
<p>for a steer” on whether to call in staff over Christmas to prepare for deployments </p>
<p>in the first few days of January, “rather than mid&#8209;January as currently assumed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “some suspicion about the provenance of the information about US </p>
<p>intentions”, which had come from CENTCOM. Mr Watkins’ own contacts with </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld’s office suggested that political decisions about visible US </p>
<p>actions had not yet been taken. There was a risk, not for the first time, of the UK </p>
<p>getting ahead of the US Government’s position.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deploying equipment before the planned visit to Ankara risked “a diplomatic </p>
<p>own goal”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK Government’s communications plan assumed a start date of 7 January.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair would be on holiday abroad until 5 January.</p>

<p>incoherently without any real reference to the UN or political timetable”.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> Mr Hoon might </p>
<p>ask Adm Boyce a number of questions, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When a decision on Turkey was needed?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether it was “still worth pursuing Turkey given the difficulty the US” was </p>
<p>having?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether there was “a worthwhile role for any heavy forces” if Turkey was not </p>
<p>available.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“When do we bite the bullet and rule out the heavy land option? Or are we </p>
<p>content to march them up to the top of the hill just for force on mind? How would </p>
<p>we cope with the morale implications?”</p>
<p><b>1307. </b> Mr Hoon would “need to see properly considered and realistically argued </p>
<p>submissions” if early decisions were needed. </p>
<p><b>1308. </b> The record of the conversation with Adm Boyce stated that, in relation to the </p>
<p>work on land options, Mr Hoon was reluctant to take any risks with Op FRESCO’s </p>
<p>capability.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1309. </b> Mr Hoon was content, for planning purposes, with the assumption that an initial </p>
<p>tranche of Reservists would be called out on or about 9 January. That would “be subject </p>
<p>to clearance from No.10 in due course”. He also wanted to avoid any clearly visible </p>
<p>increase in activity “over and above what he [had] foreshadowed in his Statement in </p>
<p>the House [of Commons] on 18 December before 6 January”, because of the “need to </p>
<p>balance the diplomatic and military tracks”. </p>
<p><b>1310. </b> Mr Hoon noted that further advice on preparations would be provided and that it </p>
<p>would be helpful to have a clearer sense of the US planning timetable. </p>
<p><b>Planning Directive for Lt Gen Reith, 30 December 2002</b></p>
<p>Adm Boyce issued a Planning and Preparation Directive on 30 December.</p>
<p>494</p>
<p> That gave </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith: “authority to undertake the necessary preparations, including reductions in </p>
<p>Notice to Move and overt training, in order that UK forces identified for potential operations </p>
<p>in Iraq are in all aspects ready for Coalition military operations”, including ensuring 16 Air </p>
<p>Assault Brigade was ready for operations. </p>
<p>The Directive stated: “The codeword for the preparatory phase of this operation, and if UK </p>
<p>forces are subsequently required to commit to action in the execution phase, is TELIC.”</p>
<p>On Phase IV, it stated:</p>

<p>371</p>
<p><b>1327. </b> In their second conversation Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that:</p>
<p>“Following the latest news from Turkey, we could provide an amphibious task force </p>
<p>in the South. We might also put in an armoured brigade in the South.”</p>
<p>502</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1328. </b> Mr Straw also cautioned that the armoured brigade would take an extra 45 days </p>
<p>to arrive. </p>
<p><b>1329. </b> Mr Hoon was advised on 30 December that it seemed increasingly unlikely </p>
<p>ground forces would be allowed to operate from Turkey and that the ground forces </p>
<p>options were under review.</p>
<p>503</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1330. </b> The US was reviewing the military plan “and considering what role a UK ground </p>
<p>force could play in the South”. Mr Johnson stated:</p>
<p>“We had of course offered the existing land package on the assumption that it would </p>
<p>operate in the North. Ministers have not endorsed any assumptions about a possible </p>
<p>role in the South, which is more likely to be for follow&#8209;on, or aftermath, tasks.”</p>
<p><b>1331. </b> Mr Hoon was advised that, at present, there was “no clear role for any [of the </p>
<p>options being examined] in the South”; the UK needed “first to hear from the US … what </p>
<p>possible roles they may now envisage for UK land forces.</p>
<p><b>1332. </b> Mr Westmacott advised on 31 December that despite a series of meetings in </p>
<p>Christmas week, there were still no decisions although the Turkish Parliament had </p>
<p>approved the renewal of the authority for US and UK aircraft to continue to operate from </p>
<p>Incirlik over the northern No&#8209;Fly Zone.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p> In his view it was unlikely that Turkey would be </p>
<p>forthcoming on Iraq during Mr Hoon’s planned meeting the following week. Turkey was </p>
<p>likely to wait until after Dr Blix’s report to the UN Security Council on 27 January before </p>
<p>consulting Parliament.</p>
<p><b>1333. </b> On 2 January 2003, Mr Westmacott advised that he had not detected any </p>
<p>particular hostility to a UK military presence: “The key point was that Turkey would rather </p>
<p>not have any of us.” Mr Hoon’s visit should help to clarify the picture.</p>

<p><b>1334. </b> In his letter of 3 January about the announcement of the ATG deployment on </p>
<p>7 January, Mr Watkins alerted Sir David Manning to the need to reconsider options </p>
<p>for the UK’s ground contribution because of doubts about transit through Turkey.</p>
<p>506</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He advised: </p>
<p>“It may … be necessary to take decisions next week to give us time to train </p>
<p>additional units for Operation FRESCO … freeing up units that, under new plans, </p>
<p>might deploy to the South.</p>
<p>“In the meantime, we are continuing with preparations to enable a ground force </p>
<p>contribution of at least an armoured brigade (and its Divisional HQ) to deploy as </p>
<p>soon as possible.”</p>
<p><b>1335. </b> In his minute of 3 January on the way ahead on Iraq over the next few weeks, </p>
<p>which is addressed in Section 3.6, Mr Straw informed Mr Blair that Turkey would not </p>
<p>allow US or UK troops through on the ground and that was “leading CENTCOM to </p>
<p>re&#8209;think”; and that “must have an impact on the robustness of the overall plan, and </p>

<p>508</p>
<p> In the light of the previous advice about </p>
<p>its importance, Sir David said that he was “uneasy”. </p>
<p><b>1338. </b> In an update on Iraq for Mr Blair on 3 January, which is also addressed in </p>
<p>Section 3.6, Sir David Manning wrote that he was worried that US strategy was in </p>
<p>danger of being driven by the tempo of military planning which assumed decisions </p>
<p>in mid&#8209;February.</p>
<p>509</p>
<p> A “long hard look at the current state of the military planning” was </p>
<p>needed: “Too much looks like hurried improvisation, half thought out strategy”, which </p>
<p>assumed that Saddam Hussein would collapse “in short order”. </p>

<p>511</p>
<p> The US and UK were discussing possible roles for UK forces in the South. </p>
<p>The UK was “ready to play a significant role there, provided it made sense in terms of </p>
<p>the overall plan”.</p>
<p><b>1342. </b> Mr Westmacott’s overview of the visit reported that although Turkish interlocutors </p>
<p>had spelled out their concerns, they had given “tentative agreement to the start of </p>
<p>military planning talks”.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1343. </b> The British Embassy Ankara reported that Mr Hoon had told all his interlocutors </p>
<p>that “the UK, like Turkey, wanted a peaceful outcome to the crisis if possible; but our </p>
<p>best chance of achieving it lay in making a credible show of coalition readiness to use </p>
<p>force if necessary”. </p>
<p><b>1344. </b> The UK “understood” Turkish concerns: </p>
<p>“… about legitimacy (which we shared), domestic and regional politics. But we </p>
<p>needed to start high level military planning talks now if Saddam Hussein was to get </p>
<p>the message. We and the United States were also convinced that, if military action </p>
<p>proved necessary, it would be quicker, cleaner, and more effective if it was done </p>
<p>with the support and facilitation of Turkey. A northern route land forces option … </p>
<p>with a thrust from the South, made the most sense … UK military involvement was </p>
<p>under consideration.”</p>
<p><b>1345. </b> Mr Hoon was advised to lodge a formal request.</p>
<p><b>1346. </b> Records of the meetings in Ankara on 8 January circulated by Mr Watkins </p>
<p>demonstrated that Mr Hoon had argued that the UK objectives published on 7 January </p>
<p>were similar to Turkey’s objectives: </p>
<p>“… we too wished to avoid war. But we had to demonstrate the seriousness of our </p>
<p>intent … Visible military preparations might make war less likely.”</p>
<p>513</p>
<p><b>1347. </b> The UK was in close touch with CENTCOM on a possible land package and </p>
<p>Adm Boyce was “ready to come out to discuss the details”. </p>
<p><b>1348. </b> The Turkish response was guarded. It had a number of concerns about the </p>
<p>political, economic and humanitarian consequences of military action. All chances for </p>
<p>a peaceful resolution had to be exhausted. There was no public support for a war and, </p>
<p>therefore, no guarantee of Parliamentary support. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>374</p>
<p><b>1350. </b> When Adm Boyce visited Turkey in late January, Mr Westmacott reported that </p>
<p>there were no instructions to reply to Mr Hoon’s letter.</p>
<p>515</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1351. </b> At Cabinet on 9 January Mr Hoon reported his visit to Turkey and the sensitivities </p>
<p>about actions involving Iraq.</p>
<p>516</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1352. </b> Other issues discussed are addressed in Section 3.6.</p>
<p><b>1353. </b> Mr Blair told Cabinet that there would be an “in&#8209;depth” discussion on Iraq the </p>
<p>following week.</p>
<p><b>1354. </b> Adm Boyce updated Gen Myers on the outcome of the visit on 9 January and </p>
<p>outlined the UK’s “commitment to operations in southern Iraq.”</p>
<p>517</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1355. </b> The report of the discussion also stated that the US could stay poised for military </p>
<p>operations for 3&#8209;4 months. </p>
<p><b>1356. </b> On 11 January, Mr Straw discussed the Turkish position with Secretary Powell, </p>
<p>including the need to avoid Turkey being drawn into any conflict in Iraq and the </p>
<p>practicalities of the northern option.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1357. </b> Reporting from the British Embassy Washington showed that similar concerns </p>
<p>about permission had been discussed during Mr Ricketts’ visit.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1358. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that it was not until early January that the northern </p>
<p>option was “absolutely blocked off” after he and Mr Hoon went to Ankara “to make one </p>
<p>final effort to clarify what was going on”, including to secure “overflight rights for aircraft </p>
<p>and supplies”.</p>
<p>520</p>
<p> But it had become “increasingly difficult to rely on the northern option” </p>
<p>from late November into December.</p>
<p><b>1359. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that his awareness of the difficulties with Turkey grew </p>
<p>“towards the end” of 2002.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p> The UK had been alerted to the likely attitude of Turkey by </p>
<p>Secretary Powell. When Mr Hoon had visited in early January 2003 he had had “a very </p>
<p>rapid history lesson”; “all they were talking about was what had happened in the 1920s </p>
<p>and Britain could not entirely be trusted”.</p>
<p><b>1360. </b> Mr Hoon stated that he did not think the decision to abandon the northern option </p>
<p>was taken until after his visit to Ankara, when he formed the view that “we would never </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1361. </b> Mr Hoon added that the US did not abandon hope of securing Turkey’s </p>
<p>agreement to the deployment of 4th Infantry Division until much later, and that it had </p>
<p>stayed in the eastern Mediterranean until after the start of the invasion.</p>
<p>523</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1362. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry: “I went with Geoff Hoon to Ankara … to … finally </p>
<p>see whether we could achieve agreement with the Turks.”</p>
<p>524</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1363. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I felt slightly embarrassed, to be absolutely honest, because having been head </p>
<p>of chancery in the Embassy in Ankara for three and a half years, I thought I knew </p>
<p>my Turks. I thought they were going to be supportive, and I of all people should </p>
<p>have realised that the idea of the Brits going into Kurdistan … re&#8209;awoke some very </p>
<p>sensitive Turkish nationalist memories of how we behaved in the 1920s when they </p>
<p>felt we were flirting with the idea of a Kurdistan as part of a way of dismantling the </p>
<p>Ottoman empire.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“So we miscalculated there, and I have to say, I should have known better myself.”</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1364. </b> Sir Kevin added:</p>
<p>“I think we thought we could provide reassurances that would overcome the Turkish </p>
<p>objections, and unfortunately the Turks were reasonably polite and accommodating </p>
<p>to let us feel that might actually be the case.”</p>
<p>526</p>
<p><b>1365. </b> Sir Kevin confirmed that he was referring to both military and civilian views:</p>
<p>“The problem was also they had an election, and there was a certain amount </p>
<p>of chaos in Turkey about the stability of their arrangements, and I – we were </p>
<p>encouraged to think that even at the last moment there might be a vote which would </p>
<p>enable us to go there.”</p>
<p><b>1366. </b> In response to a question about whether he recalled that the views of the FCO </p>
<p>and the Embassy in Ankara were not dissimilar from his own, Sir Kevin told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that he did not:</p>
<p>“… recall being out on a personal limb … [M]y sense was that we were getting </p>
<p>mixed messages, and that we need to clarify the situation, not that we were being </p>

<p>527</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1367. </b> At the time he gave evidence, Sir Kevin had not had the telegrams from Ankara </p>
<p>drawn to his attention.</p>
<p>528</p>
<p><b>1368. </b> Sir Kevin confirmed that there had been a majority vote in the Turkish Parliament </p>
<p>but that it was not sufficiently large to approve the deployment.</p>
<p>529</p>
<p><b>1369. </b> In relation to Mr Hoon’s visit in January 2003, Mr Lee told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“As I recall … that was a sort of last throw of the dice really, that everyone else had </p>
<p>tried, hadn’t had an outright ‘no’, but hadn’t had any sort of encouragement either. </p>
<p>So we should try this. He [Hoon] should go, speak to his opposite numbers, as many </p>
<p>people as possible in the Turkish hierarchy, and see what the result would be. The </p>
<p>outcome of that visit was, I think, the realisation dawned that Turkey was not going </p>
<p>to agree. So things moved on, away from the northern option.”</p>
<p>530</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Should the UK have addressed an alternative to the northern </b></p>
<p><b>option earlier and more seriously?</b></p>
<p><b>1370.  The need for a northern axis for any invasion of Iraq was suggested to the </b></p>
<p><b>US by the UK military in July 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>1371.  The MOD’s preference for a discrete role in northern Iraq was identified in </b></p>
<p><b>July 2002 and it remained the preferred option until the end of the year.</b></p>
<p><b>1372. </b> The evidence set out in this Section catalogues the advice, offered by </p>
<p>PJHQ to the MOD and the MOD advice to Mr Hoon and Mr Blair between July and </p>
<p>December 2002, on the strategic rationale for both northern and southern axes of </p>
<p>attack in an invasion of Iraq, and the advantages of the northern option from the </p>
<p>UK’s perspective. </p>
<p><b>1373. </b> The proposal reflected long&#8209;held and legitimate judgements about the difficulties </p>
<p>which could arise during operations if ground forces at a brigade level or below were </p>
<p>embedded within US structures. </p>
<p><b>1374. </b> A briefing note for Mr Hoon on 11 December 2002 explicitly confirmed that the </p>
<p>northern option “came from our strategic analysis in the first place”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>1375. </b> Asked when during the summer of 2002 the idea that the UK would lead on the </p>
<p>northern option had arisen, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that it: </p>
<p>“… was a fairly early part of the planning process, that we’d come from Turkey. </p>
<p>We weren’t going to lead it … we’d have been part of the American force …”</p>
<p>532</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1376. </b> Asked where the idea had originated, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that it was </p>
<p>“to a certain extent American&#8209;driven” but there was a dormant “NATO plan to go </p>
<p>through Turkey” that could have been “dusted off and re&#8209;shaped to deal with this </p>
<p>particular operation”.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p><b>1377. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that he had “previous [experience] … in … Kurdistan” </p>
<p>where he had been deployed in 1991.</p>
<p>534</p>
<p> He had taken the view, at the time “and … still”, </p>
<p>that the northern option offered “demonstrable military advantage”. That included less </p>
<p>significant geographical challenges and more freedom of manoeuvre. </p>
<p><b>1378. </b> Gen Reith recalled that the UK had suggested a second axis from the north to fix </p>
<p>the six to eight Iraqi divisions lined up along the edge of the Kurdish zone and prevent </p>
<p>them moving south, although he could not recall the exact timing.</p>
<p>535</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1379. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“What happened with the northern option was that, when we had suggested it to </p>
<p>them [the US], they then came back and said to us, ‘Well, perhaps the UK could do </p>
<p>the northern option as a discrete entity.’”</p>
<p>536</p>
<p><b>1380. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that his recollection was that the possibility of an attack </p>
<p>on two axes to divide the Republican Guard had been identified and discussed before </p>
<p>Lt Gen Pigott’s visit to CENTCOM at the end of June; and that Lt Gen Pigott had </p>
<p>persuaded the US military to consider a northern option.</p>
<p>537</p>
<p><b>1381. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that he was “pretty confident” that the UK had </p>
<p>“persuaded” the US “about the northern option”.</p>
<p>538</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1382.  By late October 2002, the US had adopted a northern axis as an essential </b></p>
<p><b>element of its campaign plan and decided to allocate its 4th Infantry Division to </b></p>

<p><b>1386. </b> Asked whether given the southern No&#8209;Fly Zone had been more difficult than the </p>
<p>northern one, the UK had been more comfortable operating in the North, Lord Boyce </p>
<p>replied that was:</p>
<p>“… correct and it’s also true that we felt we would be more compatible with the [US] </p>
<p>4th Infantry Division than with other American divisions …”</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1387. </b> Lord Boyce added that they were also concerned about the relatively small </p>
<p>area of Kuwait for the entry of forces, and that it depended “hugely on the host nation </p>
<p>support”, although he acknowledged that the latter was also true for Turkey.</p>
<p>542</p>
<p><b>1388. </b> Lord Boyce subsequently told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… we thought that the North made sense to fix the Iraqi forces in that part of the </p>
<p>country, to do what we could to secure the oilfields before they got trashed by </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein and also to do what we could to preserve the Kurdish state up </p>
<p>there and make sure there was not an assault on the Kurds from either the Turks </p>
<p>or the Iraqis. </p>
<p>“So it appeared to be a neat option …”</p>
<p>543</p>
<p><b>1389. </b> Asked for the reasons why the military advice appeared to stress the North rather </p>
<p>than the South, Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that he did not think there had been a </p>
<p>“particular UK dimension”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had “particular concerns” about the consequences if Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>moved his troops into the Kurdish area. He did not recall that directly influencing </p>
<p>military planning, but it was “recognised very actively” at the political level.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had a military interest in the operation of the northern No&#8209;Fly Zone.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It was “clear in [the] planning” that it was very important to secure the northern </p>
<p>oilfields to prevent Saddam causing a humanitarian and environmental disaster </p>
<p>and to preserve the resources for rebuilding Iraq.</p>
<p>544</p>
<p><b>1390. </b> Sir Kevin added:</p>
<p>“So there were very strong reasons for a force to … fix the North, and strong </p>
<p>reasons therefore, for the UK to regard that as an appropriate role for us to </p>
<p>help with.”</p>
<p><b>1391. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that part of the practical problem was that the Kuwaiti </p>
<p>border with Iraq was “relatively short” and, unlike the conflict in 1991, Coalition Forces </p>
<p>could not cross the Saudi border. That meant “a lot of soldiers were being funnelled </p>
<p>through a relatively narrow area”. He had been concerned that those forces would be </p>
<p>“highly vulnerable” to chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>545</p>
<p><b>1392. </b> The judgement that southern Iraq was the most likely area for the first use of </p>
<p>chemical or biological weapons against Coalition Force, and against the local population, </p>
<p>was contained in the JIC Assessment of 19 February 2003, ‘Southern Iraq: ‘What’s </p>
<p>In Store?’.</p>
<p>546</p>
<p><b>1393. </b> Asked by the Inquiry in May 2010 about the benefits of the northern option as he </p>
<p>had understood them, Sir Kevin replied they were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to “shut the door” to prevent Saddam Hussein retreating north;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to “avoid what would otherwise be a very politically difficult situation with the </p>
<p>Kurds and the Turks”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>squeezing from both directions provided “a much better way of outmanoeuvring </p>
<p>your opponent”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>concerns about “a real bottleneck through Kuwait”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Kurdish Autonomous Zone was a “fairly stable area”, which “looked rather </p>
<p>easier than fighting one’s way or helping to fight one’s way up Iraq”.</p>
<p>547</p>
<p><b>1394. </b> Sir Kevin recognised that the mountainous terrain in south&#8209;eastern Turkey </p>
<p>and the length of the logistics supply lines would have posed challenges, but he </p>
<p>thought Adm Boyce and “a lot of military men would have liked” to have had the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>1396. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry that the North was “quite a difficult area” and </p>
<p>“over time, and particularly with the Turkish elections, and … my sense of a lack of </p>
<p>enthusiasm by the Turks … for me, as the planner, it became less and less attractive </p>
<p>as an option”.</p>
<p>549</p>
<p><b>1397. </b> Gen Reith added:</p>
<p>“… I was unhappy with the logistic support required and the tenuous lines of </p>
<p>communication to actually get our logistic support to our forces.</p>
<p>“It was very, very tight … it was very mountainous … we were going to have to use </p>
<p>the river Tigris as our protection on our left flank … it wasn’t an attractive military </p>
<p>option for what would have been, at best, a division plus.”</p>
<p>550</p>
<p><b>1398. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry that discussions started with the US about where in </p>
<p>the South a land package might best be employed after his paper of 18 November. He </p>
<p>added that the Americans moved from thinking that the UK would definitely be going to </p>
<p>the North to “maybe we [the UK] should be doing the South”.</p>
<p>551</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1399.  Other evidence given to the Inquiry suggested that the relative advantages </b></p>
<p><b>and disadvantages of the northern and southern options might have been more </b></p>
<p><b>balanced than some of the briefing offered to Mr Hoon and Mr Blair suggested.</b></p>
<p><b>1400. </b> Gen Jackson told the Inquiry that the “relative logistic challenge” of the southern </p>
<p>option was “probably logistically simpler” than the northern option.</p>
<p>552</p>
<p><b>1401. </b> Asked about his assessment of the risks and liabilities for the UK when he saw </p>
<p>that the position was shifting from the North to the South, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Timing would have been one … our transit … was going to take slightly longer. </p>
<p>There was … a risk of the actual logistic effort but that was mitigated by the fact the </p>
<p>Americans were going to help us … desertification of some of the kit … required </p>
<p>some effort … But the Americans … were particularly helpful in making room for us </p>
<p>in Kuwait …”</p>
<p>553</p>
<p><b>1402. </b> Lord Boyce added that “substantial effort” had already been made on the </p>
<p>southern option and that working alongside the Amphibious Task Group helped the </p>
<p>logistics support, and:</p>
<p>“… whatever risks there were in switching to the South, in many senses were </p>
<p>outweighed by some of the benefits …”</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>381</p>
<p><b>1403. </b> Asked about the assessment of the Iraqi opposition, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that he had not thought that Iraq’s fighting capability was going to be “any more </p>
<p>challenging than … in the North”.</p>
<p>555</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1404. </b> Lord Boyce added that “one of the advantages” of the South which emerged “as </p>
<p>the battle plans started to develop” was that “we were to be given an area of operations </p>
<p>… which would … make it a cleaner operation” for the UK than working alongside the </p>
<p>US 4th Infantry Division:</p>
<p>“Our job … as we saw it, was going to be to fix the Iraqi or defeat the Iraqi divisions </p>
<p>in the South to make sure the Americans had untrammelled progress towards the </p>
<p>North without having to worry about their rear or their flank … That gave us a very </p>
<p>clear mission …”</p>
<p><b>1405. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Our feeling was that actually it [the South] might be … an easier place to deal with </p>
<p>than the North, or further north I mean, because … the vast majority of the people in </p>
<p>the South were Shia as opposed to the more heavy or original mix of Sunnis further </p>
<p>north where we thought there would be problems between the Sunnis and Shia once </p>
<p>the country – once we got past war end. Therefore, we were dealing with one sector </p>
<p>which hopefully would be working together … and would be cooperative … as we </p>
<p>tried to … regenerate the country after the fighting was over.”</p>
<p>556</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1406.  In oral evidence, witnesses offered different views about their perception of </b></p>
<p><b>Turkey’s position in late 2002 and early January 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>1407. </b> Maj Gen Wilson had reported on 17 July 2002 that US planners had been asked </p>
<p>to look at plans for a scenario without Turkey.</p>
<p><b>1408. </b> DSF 1 told the Inquiry that he had informed Lt Gen Pigott “in about November” </p>
<p>that UK ground forces were “not going through Turkey”.</p>
<p>557</p>
<p><b>1409. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Richard Dearlove at what stage he judged that the Turkish </p>
<p>route would not be possible.</p>
<p>558</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry that “in the summer some time” it </p>
<p>was “clear that the Turkish General Staff … were not going to agree to a British military </p>
<p>deployment through Turkey”. </p>
<p><b>1410. </b> Sir Richard added:</p>
<p>“… in the autumn, it became clear that there was going to be no British military </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>1411. </b> Asked if he had offered any advice to the military, Sir Richard replied:</p>
<p>“… I would have reported that instantly … I was in touch frequently. Mike Boyce </p>
<p>and I were regularly talking to each other. But … it was evident. It would have been </p>
<p>evident on the attaché military channels at about the same time.” </p>
<p><b>1412. </b> Asked why, when he had taken the view in October 2002 that Turkey </p>
<p>was not likely to agree to the deployment of UK forces, the MOD had persisted, </p>
<p>Sir David Manning replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, but … I was wrong about a lot of military things. So there’s no reason why </p>
<p>I should have been right about this one. I think probably … because the Americans </p>
<p>were telling our military, don’t worry, we will fix it, and … certainly the Americans </p>
<p>themselves were surprised at how difficult the Turks proved to be …”</p>
<p>559</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1413. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that the decision on 8 January 2003, to switch to </p>
<p>the South:</p>
<p>“…wasn’t a sort of cold shock for everybody … The Prime Minister, the Cabinet </p>
<p>and clearly the Secretary of State for Defence had … been exposed to the … </p>
<p>contingency planning we were doing, should we have to go South.”</p>
<p>560</p>
<p><b>1414. </b> Subsequently Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We imagined in the very early stages that because there was a NATO plan giving </p>
<p>access to come through Turkey to go towards Iraq, but that was something which </p>
<p>should not present a great difficulty. Certainly when I spoke to the Chief of the </p>
<p>Turkish General Staff, General Özkök, in the very early days, September/October </p>
<p>or so, there didn’t appear – well, he didn’t seem to think it would be a particular </p>
<p>problem.”</p>
<p>561</p>
<p><b>1415. </b> Lord Boyce added that “we rather thought” Gen Özkök “had more power than </p>
<p>he probably did”, or was prepared to exercise after the Turkish election of a new </p>
<p>Government. The MOD “persevered for probably longer than we should have done </p>
<p>in trying to get a route through Turkey”.</p>
<p>562</p>
<p><b>1416. </b> Asked whether there had been cautionary advice from the FCO about Turkey’s </p>
<p>position, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I can’t recall at any time being told to back off. As you said, we pressed on and we </p>
<p>pressed on until the bitter end when we had to make a final decision.”</p>

<p>6.1  |  Development of the military options for an invasion of Iraq</p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>1417. </b> Lord Boyce stated that the US:</p>
<p>“… started giving us warnings … around late October/November … that we were </p>
<p>probably pushing against a closed door, but we still even then carried on believing </p>
<p>we might do it, because … that particular option seemed to be the more sensible </p>
<p>one … if we were going to commit a large&#8209;sized landforce, because … Kuwait is </p>
<p>a small country.”</p>
<p>564</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1418. </b> Asked about Sir Richard Dearlove’s evidence, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that he </p>
<p>could not recall talking to him about the issue but Gen Özkök was “certainly not saying </p>
<p>‘Don’t bother to darken my door again’”.</p>
<p>565</p>
<p><b>1419.  The northern option remained the primary focus for UK planning until early </b></p>
<p><b>January.</b></p>
<p><b>1420.  The Inquiry accepts the strategic rationale for a northern axis, including </b></p>
<p><b>the aspiration to provide a framework which would allow other nations to make </b></p>
<p><b>a military contribution. </b></p>
<p><b>1421.  There are questions, however, about whether the UK should have given </b></p>
<p><b>serious consideration to the alternatives for the UK, and discussed them with the </b></p>
<p><b>US, at an earlier stage.</b></p>
<p><b>1422.  The UK recognised, from July 2002 onwards, that the proposed northern </b></p>
<p><b>option for UK land forces depended on Turkey’s agreement to the transit </b></p>
<p><b>of foreign forces; and that might be difficult to obtain. There were serious </b></p>
<p><b>doubts about whether the Turkish Government would permit the transit of UK </b></p>
<p><b>(or US) troops.</b></p>
<p><b>1423.  Before the election of a new Government in Turkey, the JIC assessed on </b></p>
<p><b>30 October 2002 that Turkey’s opposition could be overcome with US pressure.</b></p>
<p><b>1424.  The UK received mixed messages from Washington and Ankara during the </b></p>
<p><b>autumn of 2002.</b></p>
<p><b>1425.  The warning signs that Turkey might well refuse to permit the deployment </b></p>
<p><b>of UK forces led both Lt Gen Reith and the US Administration to suggest that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK should develop alternatives to the northern option.</b></p>
<p><b>1426.  The UK decided US assistance would be essential for securing Turkey’s </b></p>

<p><b>to maintain the maximum pressure on the US to pursue agreement for the </b></p>
<p><b>deployment of UK ground forces with Turkey.</b></p>
<p><b>1428.  Mr Blair had asked on 6 December 2002 for advice on the options for UK </b></p>

<p><b>1430.  Mr Hoon was advised that the decision on a switch to the South could be </b></p>
<p><b>taken after his visit to Ankara in January 2003. </b></p>
<p><b>1431.  From late July until late December 2002, Adm Boyce advised Ministers that </b></p>
<p><b>the UK was not in a position to generate the forces necessary to conduct combat </b></p>
<p><b>operations at divisional level without US support. </b></p>
<p><b>1432.  Until the middle of December 2002, Ministerial decisions and military </b></p>
<p><b>planning and preparations were based on advice that the deployment of a single </b></p>
<p><b>combat brigade, with four battalions, in a northern option and the possible </b></p>
<p><b>deployment of a Royal Marine Commando Group to southern Iraq, were the </b></p>
<p><b>maximum which could be deployed given the requirements of Op FRESCO and </b></p>
