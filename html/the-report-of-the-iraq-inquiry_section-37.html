<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the development of the UK position on Iraq between </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush on 31 January 2003, at which he sought US </p>
<p>support for a further, “second”, Security Council resolution before military action was </p>
<p>taken, and the meeting of the Security Council on 7 March, at which the UK, US and </p>
<p>Spain tabled a revised draft resolution stating that Iraq would have failed to take the </p>
<p>final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 unless the Council concluded on or before </p>
<p>17 March that Iraq was demonstrating “full, unconditional, immediate and active </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation” with its obligations to disarm.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> During that time, the UK Government was pursuing both intense diplomatic </p>
<p>negotiations with the US and other members of the Security Council about the way </p>
<p>ahead on Iraq and a pro&#8209;active communications strategy about why Iraq had to be </p>
<p>disarmed, if necessary by force, against the background of sharply divided opinion </p>
<p>and constant political and public debate about the possibility of military action.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> Development of UK strategy and options between 8 March and the start of military </p>
<p>action overnight on 19/20 March is addressed in Section 3.8.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Other key developments in February and early March are addressed elsewhere </p>
<p>in the Report, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The provision of advice by Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, on the legal </p>
<p>basis for military action to secure Iraq’s compliance with its disarmament </p>
<p>obligations is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The planning for military operations in southern Iraq and preparations to equip </p>
<p>the forces deployed are addressed in Sections 6.2 and 6.3 respectively.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK planning and preparation for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq is addressed </p>
<p>in Section 6.5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Advice and briefings on Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </p>
<p>capabilities and its intentions in relation to concealing them from inspections and </p>
<p>in response to military action are addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By the time the Security Council met on 7 March 2003 there were deep divisions </p>
<p>within it on the way ahead on Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following President Bush’s agreement to support a second resolution to help </p>
<p>Mr Blair, Mr Blair and Mr Straw continued during February and early March 2003 </p>
<p>to develop the position that Saddam Hussein was not co&#8209;operating as required by </p>
<p>resolution 1441 (2002) and, if that situation continued, a second resolution should </p>
<p>be adopted stating that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered by the </p>
<p>Security Council.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 6 February, Mr Blair said that the UK would consider military action without a </p>
<p>further resolution only if the inspectors reported that they could not do their job and </p>
<p>a resolution was vetoed unreasonably. The UK would not take military action without </p>
<p>a majority in the Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s proposals, on 19 February, for a side statement defining tough tests for </p>
<p>Iraq’s co&#8209;operation and a deadline of 14 March for a vote by the Security Council, </p>
<p>were not agreed by the US.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The initial draft of a US, UK and Spanish resolution tabled on 24 February, which </p>
<p>simply invited the Security Council to decide that Iraq had failed to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity offered by resolution 1441, failed to attract support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Throughout February, the divisions in the Security Council widened.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France, Germany and Russia set out their common position on 10 and 24 February. </p>
<p>Their joint memorandum of 24 February called for a programme of continued and </p>
<p>reinforced inspections with a clear timeline and a military build&#8209;up to exert maximum </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq to disarm.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reports to the Security Council by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) </p>
<p>reported increasing indications of Iraqi co&#8209;operation. On 7 March, Dr Mohamed </p>
<p>ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA, reported that there was no indication </p>
<p>that Iraq had resumed nuclear activities and that it should be able to provide the </p>
<p>Security Council with an assessment of Iraq’s activities in the near future.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Hans Blix, Executive Chairman of United Nations Monitoring, Verification and </p>
<p>Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), reported to the Security Council on 7 March </p>
<p>that there had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq and, while they did </p>
<p>not constitute immediate co&#8209;operation, they were welcome. UNMOVIC would be </p>
<p>proposing a work programme for the Security Council’s approval, based on key </p>
<p>tasks for Iraq to address. It would take months to verify sites and items, analyse </p>
<p>documents, interview relevant personnel and draw conclusions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A revised draft US, UK and Spanish resolution, tabled after the reports by Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March and proposing a deadline of 17 March for Iraq to </p>
<p>demonstrate full co&#8209;operation, also failed to attract support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>China, France and Russia all stated that they did not favour a resolution authorising </p>
<p>the use of force and that the Security Council should maintain its efforts to find a </p>
<p>peaceful solution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the United Nations in </p>
<p>New York, advised that a “side statement” with defined benchmarks for Iraqi  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation could be needed to secure support from Mexico and Chile.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair told President Bush that he would need a majority of nine votes in the </p>
<p>Security Council for Parliamentary approval for UK military action.</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>1 to 13 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>Parliamentary debates on Iraq, 3 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Reporting on his visit to Washington on 31 January 2003, Mr Blair told </b></p>
<p><b>Parliament on 3 February that Saddam Hussein was not co-operating as required </b></p>
<p><b>by UN Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1441(2002) and, if that continued, </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution should be passed to confirm such a material breach.</b></p>
<p><b>6.  Mr Blair continued to set the need for action against Iraq in the context </b></p>
<p><b>of the need to be seen to enforce the will of the UN and to deter future threats.</b></p>
<p><b>7. </b> Following his meeting with President Bush in Washington on 31 January 2003, </p>
<p>Mr Blair made a statement to Parliament on Monday 3 February.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Mr Blair described Iraq as the “immediate focus of the visit” although he and </p>
<p>President Bush had also discussed the Middle East Peace Process (MEPP), </p>
<p>Afghanistan, and global poverty and development. Mr Blair also reported that he had </p>
<p>had meetings and discussions with other Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Stating that, “We are entering the final phase of a 12&#8209;year history of the disarmament </p>
<p>of Iraq”, Mr Blair said that Saddam Hussein had “consistently flouted” 27 “separate and </p>
<p>categorical obligations” in a series of 17 resolutions. That was why a sanctions regime </p>
<p>had been in place, which “because of the way in which Saddam has applied it, has </p>
<p>caused wholly unnecessary suffering for the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“Eight weeks have now passed since Saddam was given his final chance. </p>
<p>Six hundred weeks have passed since he was given his first chance. The </p>
<p>evidence of co&#8209;operation withheld is unmistakable. Saddam has still not answered </p>
<p>the questions concerning thousands of missing munitions and tons of chemical and </p>
<p>biological agents unaccounted for.”</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Mr Blair reported the recent finds by the weapons inspectors and drew attention </p>
<p>to the report published by No.10 the previous weekend, which made clear that Iraq had </p>
<p>“a huge infrastructure of deception and concealment designed to prevent the inspectors </p>
<p>from doing their job”.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> That report, the No.10 dossier, ‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception </p>
<p>and Intimidation’, is addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>House of Commons, <i>Official Report</i>, 3 February 2003, columns 21&#8209;38.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Referring to the report by Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of the UN </p>
<p>Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), to the Security Council </p>
<p>on 27 January, including his comments that Iraq did not appear to have come to a </p>
<p>genuine acceptance of the disarmament demanded, and that the discovery of chemical </p>
<p>rocket warheads could be the “tip of an iceberg”, Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“The situation therefore could not be clearer. There is a duty on Saddam to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate fully. At present, he is not co&#8209;operating fully. Failure to do so is a material </p>
<p>breach of resolution 1441. Should Dr Blix continue to report Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation, </p>
<p>a second resolution should be passed to confirm such a material breach. President </p>
<p>Bush and I agreed that we should seek maximum support for such a resolution, </p>
<p>provided, as ever, that seeking such a resolution is a way of resolving the issue, </p>
<p>not delaying or avoiding dealing with it at all.”</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Blair also drew attention to the “powerful evidence of the continuing terrorist </p>
<p>threat” which had appeared over the past few weeks. Terrorist groups were “actively </p>
<p>seeking to use chemical or biological means to cause as much death and injury and </p>
<p>suffering as they can”.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Blair stated that Iraq was not alone in developing weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>(WMD) and repeated his warning that:</p>
<p>“… unless we take a decisive stand now as an international community, it is </p>
<p>only a matter of time before these threats come together. That means pursuing </p>
<p>international terrorism across the world in all its forms. It means confronting nations </p>
<p>defying the world over weapons of mass destruction. That is why a signal of </p>
<p>weakness over Iraq is not only wrong in its own terms. Show weakness now and </p>
<p>no one will ever believe us when we try to show strength in future. All our history, </p>
<p>especially British history, points to this lesson. No one wants conflict. Even now, </p>
<p>war could be avoided if Saddam did what he is supposed to do. But if having made </p>
<p>a demand backed up by a threat of force, we fail to enforce that demand, the result </p>
<p>will not be peace or security. It will simply be returning to confront the issue again </p>
<p>at a later time, with the world less stable, the will of the international community less </p>
<p>certain and those repressive states or terrorist groups that would destroy our way </p>
<p>of life emboldened and undeterred.”</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Blair concluded that he hoped that conflict with Iraq could be avoided and that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “can come to his senses, co&#8209;operate fully and disarm peacefully”. </p>
<p>But if he did not:</p>
<p>“… he must be disarmed by force. If we have to go down that route, we shall do </p>
<p>all we can to minimise the risks to the people of Iraq, and we give an absolute </p>
<p>undertaking to protect Iraq’s territorial integrity …</p>
<p>“Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction and the threats they pose to the world must </p>
<p>be confronted. In doing so, this country and our Armed Forces will be helping the </p>
<p>long&#8209;term peace and security of Britain and the world.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>17. </b> In response, Mr Iain Duncan Smith, Leader of the Opposition, stated that his party </p>
<p>fully supported the UN route and he hoped a second resolution would be possible: </p>
<p>“Although it is not a prerequisite for future action, it is highly desirable.” He stated that </p>
<p>the “fundamental problem is not lack of time, but the attitude of Saddam Hussein”. </p>
<p>He agreed with Mr Blair that “if the international community backs away from dealing </p>
<p>with Saddam Hussein now, that will be seen as a green light by every rogue state and </p>
<p>terrorist group around the world”.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, referred to the extent of </p>
<p>public anxiety about developments and “a sense that we seem to be hastening into war </p>
<p>ahead of the events”. He stated that the Government had “still to make a credible case”, </p>
<p>and: “That case, for any fair&#8209;minded person viewing it, has to be based on credible </p>
<p>evidence, which has not so far been forthcoming.”</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Mr Blair responded that, after 12 years of trying to get disarmament, resolution </p>
<p>1441 offered Saddam Hussein a final opportunity. That was “hardly hastening into a </p>
<p>war”. It was a response to Saddam Hussein’s “point blank” refusal to do what the United </p>
<p>Nations had asked. If, as Dr Blix had said, Saddam Hussein was “carrying on in breach </p>
<p>of his obligations, that was “credible evidence” that he was not co&#8209;operating. The United </p>
<p>Nations had decided that Saddam Hussein was in breach of its resolutions and he had </p>
<p>“got to produce the evidence that he is now co&#8209;operating fully – and he is not doing so”.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Blair added that the inspectors’ task was “not to engage in an elaborate game </p>
<p>of hide and seek”. That was the game Saddam Hussein had been playing for 12 years; </p>
<p>and it was “unacceptable”. The US had chosen to go through the UN process, “but that </p>
<p>process should be a way of dealing with this issue once and for all, not of kicking it into </p>
<p>the long grass again and avoiding it altogether”.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> In response to a question from Mr Donald Anderson, Chairman of the Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs Committee (FAC), about whether he feared that Russia, France or China might </p>
<p>“unreasonably” veto a second resolution, Mr Blair responded that he was:</p>
<p>“… working on the basis that people hold to both the spirit and the letter of resolution </p>
<p>1441. The process has integrity. Saddam has a final opportunity and he must </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate fully. If he does not, a fresh resolution will be issued. The logic of that </p>
<p>will take people along with us, especially when there are further inspectors’ reports </p>
<p>to come.”</p>
<p><b>22. </b> Asked by Mr David Heath (Liberal Democrat) whether he disagreed with a view that </p>
<p>war would be a potent recruiting tool for terrorist groups, Mr Blair responded: “If we are </p>
<p>taking action where we are obviously and clearly enforcing the will of the UN”, that view </p>
<p>was “not right”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… the people who will be most delighted to see the end of Saddam are the people </p>
<p>who are his first and primary victims – his own people. In those circumstances, I do </p>
<p>not believe that it will recruit people to the cause of terrorism … what will recruit </p>
<p>people to the cause of terrorism is a belief among these fanatics that the will of the </p>
<p>international community is weak, that it does not have a determination to confront </p>
<p>these issues, and that, when faced with the challenge, we will fail to meet it.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> In response to a question from Mr James Paice (Conservative) about the need to </p>
<p>explain to the British public “the conjunction between the Iraqi situation and international </p>
<p>terrorism”, Mr Blair stated that “we have constantly tried to explain to people” that the </p>
<p>two issues of WMD and terrorism were “not separate”. Both represented “the threats </p>
<p>of the fanatical over the rational … [T]hreats to the civilised world from acts of barbarity.” </p>
<p>The fact was that the two issues were:</p>
<p>“… intimately linked … without a doubt, if we do not deal with both these issues at </p>
<p>some point … [they] will come together. It is simply not possible to have a situation </p>
<p>in which states are developing and trading in this stuff, with their scientists being </p>
<p>hired by the top bidder, and in which terrorist groups are well&#8209;financed and able to </p>
<p>recruit … It is not possible to have those two threats operating and for them not to </p>
<p>come together at a certain point, and the consequences would then be devastating.”</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Mr Blair stated that he was taking a risk politically on Iraq because he did not “want </p>
<p>to be the Prime Minister to whom people point the finger in history and say, ‘You knew </p>
<p>perfectly well that these two threats were there, and you didn’t do anything about it. </p>
<p>In the end, you took the easy way out …’ We know that those threats are there and </p>
<p>we have got to deal with them.”</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Asked by Mr Ian Lucas (Labour) to confirm that he would support military action </p>
<p>against Iraq only if the UN weapons inspectors certified that there was a continuing </p>
<p>material breach of UN resolution 1441, Mr Blair responded: “That is exactly the position </p>
<p>I have outlined. If the inspectors continue to certify that Iraq is not co&#8209;operating fully, that </p>
<p>is a material breach. It is precisely so that the inspectors can make those findings a fact </p>
<p>that we put them there.”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Blair’s statement was repeated in the House of Lords by Lord Williams of </p>
<p>Mostyn, the Lord Privy Seal.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Lord Strathclyde (Conservative) supported the need for action, stating that a second </p>
<p>resolution was highly desirable but it “should not be used as an excuse for delay”. </p>
<p>He also asked for further information about the specific danger Saddam Hussein posed </p>
<p>to the UK. He concluded that Saddam Hussein had been given “a second chance once </p>

<p>185</p>
<p>too often”; and that while no one wanted to go to war, “the dangers of stopping now may </p>
<p>be greater than going ahead”.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Lord Wallace of Saltaire (Liberal Democrat) stated that the Liberal Democrats </p>
<p>supported Mr Blair’s efforts “to ensure that containment of Iraq” continued to be </p>
<p>managed multilaterally, and noted the “very careful balancing act” with the unilateral </p>
<p>language used by the US Administration. Questioning a linkage between rogue states, </p>
<p>WMD and terrorism, Lord Wallace concluded:</p>
<p>“What worries us most on these Benches is the extent to which the questions </p>
<p>of rogue states, weapons of mass destruction and terrorism are conflated, as they </p>
<p>are again in this statement. Terrorism is a real, long&#8209;term problem, and it will not </p>
<p>be resolved by military intervention in Iraq or by disarming Iraq. What worries many </p>
<p>of us about what we hear from Washington at the moment is what we perceive as </p>
<p>a lack of understanding about the long&#8209;term nature of the terrorist problem in the </p>
<p>Muslim world. We need to be sure that we are standing up for universal values and </p>
<p>not simply Western values, let alone American values … An upsurge of terrorism </p>
<p>after an invasion of Iraq is a possibility for us.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy, wrote </p>
<p>that Mr Blair “felt … we had finally got the focus where it needed to be, on the issue </p>

<p>186</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Blair telephoned Mr Vladimir Putin, the Russian President and Mr Silvio </p>
<p>Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister (who was in Moscow).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> Mr Blair also spoke </p>
<p>to a number of his other counterparts, with similar messages.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 4 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK Permanent Representative to the </p>
<p>UN in New York, told Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary&#8209;General, that the UK “had not </p>
<p>won as much further time as we wished” in the meeting between Mr Blair and President </p>
<p>Bush on 31 January, but “we still had the whole of February and a bit of March to work </p>
<p>with” and “the Americans would work actively for a second resolution”. The UK wanted </p>
<p>the UN inspectors to “deliver further results, because this would make it more likely that </p>
<p>the international non&#8209;proliferation system remained in control”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Sir David Manning told Dr Rice on 5 February that, while the UK would want </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s advice before taking a firm view, his preference was </p>
<p>to start discussing a second resolution after the report to the Security Council </p>
<p>on 14 February by Dr Blix.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>36.  At the Franco-British Summit on 4 February, Mr Jacques Chirac, the </b></p>
<p><b>French President, made clear that inspections should continue unless the </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors reported that they could not do their job. War would be the worst </b></p>
<p><b>possible solution.</b></p>
<p><b>37. </b> Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to France, reported on 1 February that, </p>
<p>in a conversation about the forthcoming summit, Mr Maurice Gourdault&#8209;Montagne, </p>
<p>President Chirac’s Diplomatic Adviser, had emphasised that France had never been </p>
<p>a pacifist country, and was certainly not one now, and it was not anti&#8209;American and </p>
<p>never would be.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> But it was:</p>
<p>“… not acceptable for Europe simply to be dragged along in the US wake when our </p>
<p>interests did not fully coincide. In the case of Iraq, there was no disagreement on the </p>
<p>need to disarm Iraq, but all the options short of war had not been explored properly </p>
<p>yet, and we were being forced to march to an artificial US timetable which was not in </p>
<p>our interests. It remained to be seen whether Powell [Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary </p>
<p>of State] would produce much … [at the Security Council meeting on 5 February]. </p>
<p>For the moment the French were still not convinced there were really major things </p>
<p>for the inspectors to find, or that Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation was sufficient to say they </p>
<p>were in breach of 1441.”</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Sir John wrote that he judged President Chirac was “finally beginning to think that </p>
<p>France is in danger of finding herself in a false position”, but he was “not yet ready to </p>
<p>move towards us very significantly”.</p>

<p>that if Dr Blix continued to report Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation there should be a second UN </p>
<p>resolution “within weeks”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>40. </b> There was little movement on Iraq at the Franco&#8209;British Summit on 4 February. </p>
<p>Mr Blair stressed the value of uniting around a second resolution to put pressure on </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to go without war. President Chirac’s view was that the inspectors </p>
<p>should be allowed to continue their work, with more resources if they said they needed </p>
<p>them. The issue of a second resolution would not arise until the inspectors said they </p>
<p>could no longer do their work. He was concerned about the regional implications of any </p>
<p>military action and the potential consequences of trying to introduce democracy in Iraq.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The No.10 record of the discussion reported that President Chirac doubted that </p>
<p>Secretary Powell’s presentation the following day:</p>
<p>“… would contain anything new. If it did, the inspectors should verify it … A second </p>
<p>resolution would be necessary for a war, but one was not needed yet since the </p>
<p>inspections should continue. If the inspectors said they could not continue their </p>
<p>work, there could then be a second resolution. If the inspectors reported continued </p>
<p>non&#8209;co&#8209;operation, perhaps a High Commissioner for Disarmament could visit </p>
<p>Baghdad, and the inspections could be strengthened.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council, </b></p>
<p><b>5 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>45.  Secretary Powell gave a long and detailed presentation to the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>on 5 February setting out the US position on the threat posed by Iraq and its </b></p>
<p><b>failure to comply with resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>46. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that he had agreed to pursue a second </p>
<p>resolution if Mr Blair wanted one at their meeting in Washington on 31 January; and </p>
<p>that “the best way to get a second resolution was to lay out the evidence”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> He asked </p>
<p>Secretary Powell to make a presentation to the UN:</p>
<p>“He had credibility as a highly respected diplomat known to be reluctant about the </p>
<p>possibility of war. I knew he would do a thorough, a careful job. In early February, </p>
<p>Colin spent four days and nights at the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] personally </p>
<p>reviewing the intelligence to ensure he was comfortable with every word in </p>
<p>his speech.”</p>
<p><b>47. </b> In his presentation to the Security Council on 5 February, Secretary Powell stated </p>
<p>that he had asked for the meeting for two purposes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The first was to support the “core assessments” made by Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei on 27 January that:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“… Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance – not even </p>
<p>today – of the disarmament that was demanded of it”; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“… did not provide any new information relevant to certain questions that </p>
<p>have been outstanding since 1998”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The second was to provide “additional information and to share … what the </p>
<p>United States knows about Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, as well [as] </p>
<p>Iraq’s involvement in terrorism”.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Secretary Powell stated that the information, “when combined with what all of us </p>
<p>have learned over the years,” was “deeply troubling”. There was “an accumulation of </p>
<p>facts and disturbing patterns of behaviour” that demonstrated that Saddam Hussein and </p>
<p>his regime had “made no effort to disarm as required by the international community” </p>
<p>and was “concealing their efforts to produce more weapons”.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Secretary Powell provided tapes of intercepted conversations and satellite imagery </p>
<p>which he interpreted as demonstrating Iraq’s attempts to conceal activity to “clean up” </p>
<p>facilities before visits by the inspectors.</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Secretary Powell also stated that human sources had told the US that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqis were moving “not just documents and hard drives but also weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction to keep them from being found by inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In early December, Saddam Hussein had all Iraqi scientists warned of the </p>
<p>serious consequences that they and their families would face if they revealed </p>
<p>any sensitive information to the inspectors. They were forced to sign documents </p>
<p>acknowledging that divulging information is punishable by death.”</p>
<p>“Saddam Hussein also said that scientists should be told not to agree to leave </p>
<p>Iraq. Anyone who agreed to be interviewed outside Iraq would be treated as </p>
<p>a spy.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “false death certificate” had been issued for one scientist, and he was sent into </p>
<p>hiding, and a “dozen experts have been placed under house arrest … at one of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s ‘guest houses’.”</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Secretary Powell added that the “information and intelligence” pointed to “an active </p>
<p>and systematic effort on the part of the Iraqi regime to keep materials and people from </p>
<p>the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Secretary Powell stated that Iraq had failed the test of providing an honest </p>
<p>declaration and the conclusion that Iraq was now in further material breach of its </p>
<p>obligation was “irrefutable and undeniable”. Iraq had “placed itself in danger of the </p>
<p>serious consequences called for in resolution 1441”. The Council placed itself “in danger </p>
<p>of irrelevance” if it allowed “Iraq to continue to defy its will without responding effectively </p>
<p>and immediately”.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Secretary Powell set out the “real and present dangers” posed by Iraq’s WMD, </p>
<p>in particular its ability using mobile production facilities to produce biological agent </p>
<p>and its ability to disperse biological agents “indiscriminately” (see Section 4.3). </p>
<p>Secretary Powell also described intelligence and information on Iraq’s chemical </p>
<p>weapons, nuclear weapons and long range missile programmes.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Secretary Powell concluded by setting out the US position on the activities in Iraq </p>
<p>of Al Qaida and Ansar al&#8209;Islam. Iraq’s denial of those links and its support for terrorism </p>
<p>was “a web of lies”. The US was not prepared to run the risk of Saddam Hussein using </p>
<p>his weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Secretary Powell said that Iraq was not taking its last chance and the Council had </p>
<p>an obligation to ensure that its resolutions were complied with.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> During his presentation, Secretary Powell also drew attention “to the fine paper </p>
<p>that the United Kingdom distributed yesterday which describes in exquisite detail Iraqi </p>
<p>deception activities”.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Secretary Powell was referring to the No.10 document, ‘Iraq – Its Infrastructure </p>
<p>of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’, which is addressed in Section 4.3.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>58.  Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, stated that Iraq was now in further </b></p>
<p><b>material breach of resolution 1441. If that continued, the Security Council should </b></p>
<p><b>meet its responsibilities.</b></p>
<p><b>59. </b> In a discussion of 29 January about the Security Council on 5 February, Mr Straw </p>
<p>told Secretary Powell that he had considered the idea that the UK should publish a </p>
<p>dossier alongside the US presentation but he “did not think it was a good idea since </p>
<p>it could only be an echo of his”.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> They also discussed how to address Iraq’s human </p>
<p>rights record.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> In his statement to the Security Council, Mr Straw described Secretary Powell’s </p>
<p>presentation as “a most powerful and authoritative case against the Iraqi regime” and </p>
<p>thanked him for “laying bare the deceit practised by the regime of Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>and worse, the very great danger which that regime represents”.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Mr Straw stated that resolution 1441 had given Iraq “a final opportunity to rid </p>
<p>itself of its weapons of mass terror, of gases which can poison thousands in one go; </p>
<p>of bacilli and viruses like anthrax and smallpox which can disable and kill by the tens </p>
<p>of thousands; of the means to make nuclear weapons which can kill by the million”.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Resolution 1441 had strengthened inspections but without Iraq’s “full and active  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation” they could never be sure of finding all WMD in a country the size of Iraq. </p>
<p>But the inspectors’ reports on 27 January and Secretary Powell’s presentation could </p>
<p>leave “no illusions”. Saddam Hussein held resolution 1441 in contempt and was defying </p>
<p>the Council. He was questioning “our resolve” and was “gambling that we will lose our </p>
<p>nerve rather than enforce our will”.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> The resolution had “set two clear tests for a further material breach by Iraq”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to make “false statements” or “omissions” in its declaration; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“to comply with, and co&#8209;operate fully in the implementation” of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> In relation to the first, Mr Straw stated that Iraq’s declaration of 7 December was </p>
<p>“not full, nor accurate, nor complete”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “a false statement. Its central premise – that Iraq possesses no weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction – is a lie.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The declaration also has obvious omissions, not least a failure to explain </p>
<p>what has happened to the large quantities of chemical and biological weapons </p>
<p>materiel and munitions unaccounted for by UN weapons inspectors in 1998.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no admission of Iraq’s extensive efforts to develop WMD since the </p>
<p>last round of UNSCOM [UN Special Commission] inspections ended”.</p>

<p>191</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr Straw stated that it was “clear that Iraq has failed” the second test. The briefings </p>
<p>to the Council had:</p>
<p>“… confirmed our worst fears, that Iraq has no intention of relinquishing its WMD, </p>
<p>no intention of following the path of peaceful disarmament set out in UNSCR [UN </p>
<p>Security Council resolution] 1441. Instead of open admissions and transparency, </p>
<p>we have a charade, where a veneer of superficial co&#8209;operation masks wilful </p>
<p>concealment, the extent of which has been devastatingly revealed this morning </p>
<p>by Secretary Powell.”</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Straw stated that there was “only one possible conclusion … Iraq is in further </p>
<p>material breach” of resolution 1441. The Council faced a difficult choice. It would be </p>
<p>“Easy but wrong” to hope for a change of heart by Iraq. That would be “repeating the </p>
<p>mistakes of the last 12 years and empowering a dictator”.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> Commenting on Secretary Powell’s description of reports about the presence in Iraq </p>
<p>of “[Abu Musab] al&#8209; Zarqawi [Leader of Al Qaida in Iraq], and other members of Al Qaida, </p>
<p>and their efforts to develop poisons”, Mr Straw stated that: “It defies the imagination </p>
<p>that all of this could be going on without the knowledge of Saddam Hussein. The recent </p>
<p>discovery of the poison ricin in London has underlined again that this is a threat that all </p>
<p>of us face.”</p>
<p><b>68. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“… time is now very short. The Council will have further reports from the </p>
<p>inspectors on … 14 February. If non&#8209;co&#8209;operation continues, the Council must meet </p>
<p>its responsibilities.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“This is a moment of choice for Saddam and the Iraqi regime. But it is also a </p>
<p>moment of choice for … the United Nations … the League of Nations … failed </p>
<p>because it could not create actions … It could not back diplomacy with the credible </p>
<p>threat and, where necessary, the use of force … At each stage good men said, </p>
<p>‘Wait. The evil is not big enough to challenge’. Then before their eyes, the evil </p>
<p>became too big to challenge. We slipped slowly down a slope, never noticing how </p>
<p>far we had gone until it was too late. We owe it to our history, as well as our future, </p>
<p>not to make the same mistake again.”</p>
<p><b>69.  In response to Secretary Powell’s presentation, most members of Council </b></p>
<p><b>stated that the information presented would require serious and thorough study </b></p>
<p><b>and encouraged Iraq to co-operate with the inspectors and provide answers to </b></p>
<p><b>the outstanding questions.</b></p>
<p><b>70. </b> Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, stated that the information Secretary </p>
<p>Powell had provided required “very serious and thorough study”. It should be handed </p>
<p>immediately to UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for on&#8209;site </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>verification. Baghdad must give the inspectors answers and inspections should continue; </p>
<p>they alone could provide answers on the extent of Iraqi compliance.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Addressing the question of whether time was running out, Mr Ivanov stated </p>
<p>that resolution 1441 contained no concrete timeframe: “The inspectors alone” could </p>
<p>advise on how much time they needed “to carry out the tasks entrusted to them”. </p>
<p>Further resolutions could not be ruled out, but efforts should continue to do “everything </p>
<p>possible to facilitate the inspection process. That had “proven its effectiveness” and </p>
<p>made it “possible to implement Council decisions by peaceful means”.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> The international community was confronting new global threats and challenges, </p>
<p>and “The unity of the world community” would “continue to be the principal guarantee </p>
<p>of the effectiveness of the world’s action”.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Dominique de Villepin, the French Foreign Minister, stated that the UN had </p>
<p>chosen a policy based on:</p>
<p>“… three fundamental points: a clear objective on which we cannot compromise – </p>
<p>the disarmament of Iraq … a rigorous system of inspections that requires Iraq’s </p>
<p>active co&#8209;operation and that affirms the Security Council’s central role at each </p>
<p>a stage; and finally a requirement … our unity.”</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Inspections had already achieved “important results”. There had been good </p>
<p>progress in understanding Iraq’s nuclear capacity and no chemical or biological agents </p>
<p>had been detected, including in the empty warheads discovered on 16 January.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> There were “still grey areas in Iraq’s co&#8209;operation” and the inspectors had “reported </p>
<p>real difficulties”. The uncertainties reported by Dr Blix were “not acceptable”. France </p>
<p>had evidence of Iraq’s capacity to produce chemical agents and the possible possession </p>
<p>of significant stocks of anthrax and botulism toxin, and possibly a production capability. </p>
<p>The absence of long range delivery systems reduced the threat of those weapons, </p>
<p>but there were “disturbing signs of Iraq’s continued determination to acquire ballistic </p>
<p>missiles” beyond the range permitted.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Mr de Villepin called for a “demanding démarche anchored in resolution 1441” </p>
<p>from the Council. France did not rule out recourse to force but, before going down that </p>
<p>road, consideration had to be given as to whether the nature and the scope of the threat </p>
<p>justified force. The United Nations had to be “at the centre of the action to guarantee </p>
<p>Iraq’s unity, ensure the region’s stability, protect civilians and preserve the unity of the </p>
<p>world community”.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Mr de Villepin proposed arrangements to strengthen the inspections regime and </p>
<p>to agree a list of unresolved disarmament questions and a “demanding and realistic </p>
<p>timeframe” to address them. Iraq needed to do more. But France was convinced </p>

<p><b>78. </b> Mr Mohammed Aldouri, Iraqi Permanent Representative to UN, challenged the </p>
<p>“incorrect allegations” in Secretary Powell statement and reiterated that Iraq had no </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction. He stated that inspectors had visited the sites identified </p>
<p>in US and UK reports in September and October and “none of the allegations” were true. </p>
<p>He also rebutted statements made by President Bush in his State of the Union Address </p>
<p>on 28 January (see Section 3.6).</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Aldouri reaffirmed Iraq’s commitment to pro&#8209;active co&#8209;operation with the </p>
<p>inspectors so that they could verify that Iraq was free of weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>sanctions could be lifted, and progress could be made on regional security by ridding </p>
<p>the whole Middle East of WMD.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Reporting on the discussion, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote that Mr Straw </p>
<p>and Ms Ana Palacio, the Spanish Foreign Minister, had strongly supported </p>
<p>Secretary Powell’s presentation and Mrs Soledad Alvear, the Chilean Foreign Minister, </p>
<p>had made a “noticeably stronger intervention”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Most other countries had, however, </p>
<p>argued for more time.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Sir Jeremy commented:</p>
<p>“A dramatic day. Powell’s presentation was impressive – at the higher end of </p>
<p>expectations. It has pushed the rock further up the hill. It has also helpfully raised </p>
<p>the bar of inspections by underlining that the Iraqis will need to answer real </p>
<p>questions about their activities if they are to satisfy the inspectors …</p>
<p>“But I do not think it was decisive. Most Council members reiterated familiar </p>
<p>positions. The most significant shift was the … Chileans. French ideas … had an air </p>
<p>of desperation about them. But they could be the straw which many in the Council </p>
<p>attempt to grasp as the option other than war.”</p>
<p><b>82. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Inquiry that Secretary Powell had given:</p>
<p>“… an extremely impressive presentation of the evidence we had of Iraqi WMD, but </p>
<p>it was not decisive. There wasn’t a smoking gun there in the presentation. There </p>
<p>hadn’t been a smoking gun presented by the inspectors to the Security Council, and </p>
<p>it seemed to many members of the Security Council that Secretary Powell was trying </p>
<p>too hard to establish a case for which there was no clear proof … it didn’t convert </p>
<p>the unconverted.”</p>
<p>20</p>

<p>impact on the public debate. Later, many of the assertions in Colin’s speech would </p>
<p>prove inaccurate. But at the time, his words reflected the considered judgement </p>
<p>of intelligence agencies at home and around the world.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>84. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan wrote:</p>
<p>“… I was impressed with his delivery but I was most concerned about the substance. </p>
<p>He did not produce any evidence of the ‘smoking gun’ variety, despite effectively </p>
<p>claiming to possess such evidence. Worse, I was not alone in thinking that Powell </p>
<p>himself did not appear as though he entirely believed his own case.”</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, in private discussions over lunch, Mr Annan </p>
<p>commented that the forthcoming visit to Baghdad by Dr Blix and Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, </p>
<p>Director General of the IAEA, could be used to tell Iraq that the Security Council </p>
<p>“unanimously insisted on much improved co&#8209;operation”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had said he was grateful for the information </p>
<p>provided by Secretary Powell, which he would study carefully. If there were things </p>
<p>hidden in Iraq, the inspectors would try to find them. He had welcomed the Council’s </p>
<p>wish to stay united and the message that Iraq must co&#8209;operate actively:</p>
<p>“This could not be a game of catch&#8209;as&#8209;catch&#8209;can. Co&#8209;operation had to be </p>
<p>spontaneous. UNMOVIC could do a lot with more resources and improved </p>
<p>equipment. But Iraq was a big country. What really counted was active  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation on the South Africa model.”</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Dr ElBaradei had “echoed” most of what Dr Blix had said: “There were plenty of </p>
<p>things to be clarified by the Iraqis … Iraqi co&#8209;operation must improve in a dramatic way.”</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Asked by Secretary Powell to explain his idea of reinforced inspections, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>reported that Mr de Villepin stated he believed:</p>
<p>“… there was space between fully active co&#8209;operation and war for other options … </p>
<p>The Middle East was complex. A broader strategy was needed. Force had to be </p>
<p>the very last resort, and then only with the legitimacy of the UN. To win the peace </p>
<p>after the war, the involvement of the UN was essential. The inspection regime under </p>
<p>1441 allowed the Council this further possibility. Only if they [the inspectors] met </p>
<p>a deadlock would we need to come back to 1441. We could not afford to go to a </p>
<p>bloody, long, expensive war on the basis of impatience. Other states would draw the </p>
<p>conclusion that you needed nuclear weapons to avoid attack: compare North Korea. </p>
<p>Such crises had to be solved by the international community collectively.</p>

<p>“So the answer … was to use 1441 fully. Reinforce the inspectors. If after a time </p>
<p>it did not work, then force could be considered. The problems of the world had </p>
<p>to be solved through collective responsibility … If the route he had set out proved </p>
<p>unsuccessful, then France would assume its responsibilities with the rest.”</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Other points made during the discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Vice&#8209;Chancellor and Foreign Minister, </p>
<p>supported Mr de Villepin’s proposals for strengthened inspections.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Palacio said that it was the message to Saddam Hussein that a change </p>
<p>of will was needed that had to be strengthened, not the inspections.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw said that more inspectors and equipment would not solve anything. </p>
<p>The fundamental point was that “Iraq was not complying. If there was  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, there was no need for greater numbers. If there was  </p>
<p>no co&#8209;operation, higher numbers could not help.” The inspectors needed </p>
<p>intellectual evidence, “Yet Iraqi scientists had been terrorised into silence.”  </p>
<p>Mr de Villepin’s proposal was “a chimera, a false message. And it would lead  </p>
<p>to split in the Council.” The key was co&#8209;operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Ivanov stated that there were complaints, but the inspectors had to continue </p>
<p>and Russia would help. President Putin had asked him to set out a list of the </p>
<p>current problems and work with the Iraqis to solve them. “Baghdad could hardly </p>
<p>change overnight … Pressure would be needed. But the opportunities for </p>
<p>a political settlement were far from being exhausted.”</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that, as Council President, Mr Fischer had tried to sum up that:</p>
<p>“There was agreement the Council should send out the message that a very serious </p>
<p>point had been reached. This was a major crisis with widespread consequences. </p>
<p>War would be very damaging. 1441 had to be implemented fully. Inspections must </p>
<p>continue: there was no contradiction between that and the presence of sharp </p>
<p>instruments. The message to Baghdad had to be that they now had to deliver.”</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Secretary Powell had not, however allowed that to stand. He had listened to the </p>
<p>arguments for a peaceful solution but the Council had “so far been denied that”. The US:</p>
<p>“… was not fixated on war … But he would not accept the premise that the world </p>
<p>could not accept the risks. He hoped it would not come to war. But war could even </p>
<p>produce good results. If it came to that point, the US would be happy to act with </p>
<p>a coalition of the willing under the authority of the UN, in the full understanding  </p>
<p>of the risk of unintended consequences and of the overall situation in the Middle </p>
<p>East. Too much time had already gone by.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>92. </b> In his memoir, Mr Annan recounted the exchanges during that lunch in some detail, </p>
<p>commenting that it captured:</p>
<p>“… as few other moments do in that year of extraordinary drama and diplomatic </p>
<p>maneuvering [sic], the depth of passions, and the way in which the question of Iraq </p>
<p>became about something far larger: the foundations of peace and security, and the </p>
<p>place of the United Nations as the sole legitimate authority to endorse the use of </p>
<p>force except in cases of self&#8209;defense.”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>93. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, reported that the </p>
<p>US Administration:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was satisfied with the impact of Secretary Powell’s presentation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hoped that it might help to capture the swing vote in the Security Council; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>believed that the session had shown that the US had gone the extra mile along </p>
<p>the UN route.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>94. </b> President Bush had announced that the US would welcome and support a new </p>
<p>resolution “which made clear that the Security Council stood behind its previous </p>
<p>demands”; and that he had “repeated his resolve to lead a coalition of the willing </p>
<p>if necessary to disarm the Iraqi regime”.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Sir Christopher also reported that support for action was growing. An <i>NBC</i> poll </p>
<p>published on 5 February showed that 60 percent of Americans supported military </p>
<p>action in Iraq, and the number of Americans who would strike without UN support </p>
<p>had increased from 29 percent in January to 37 percent.</p>

<p>Peace Process forward so that the agenda of the international community did not appear </p>
<p>one&#8209;sided”. Following his discussion with President Bush, on 31 January, Mr Blair </p>
<p>reported US willingness to re&#8209;engage.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Mr Blair said that the next step was for Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to return </p>
<p>to Baghdad:</p>
<p>“It was possible that Saddam Hussein would show some movement towards </p>
<p>compliance; the Coalition military build&#8209;up would continue in the Gulf; and </p>
<p>planning for the aftermath of military action and humanitarian relief needed </p>
<p>greater emphasis.”</p>
<p><b>101. </b> France had “proposed more resources to support the inspectors”, but Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that “the issue was rather the lack of Iraqi co&#8209;operation, including their failure to explain </p>
<p>the weapons of mass destruction material which had been logged as missing in 1999, </p>
<p>and the intimidation of scientists whom the inspectors wished to interview”.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Mr Blair also stated that it was important to use the UN process to address the </p>
<p>agenda of the international community more broadly, such as on North Korea and the </p>
<p>proliferation of WMD more generally. The “likely identity of interest between rogue states </p>
<p>and terrorists who wanted to acquire weapons of mass destruction” was “of particular </p>
<p>concern”. The “presence of Al Qaida terrorists in Iraq was a reality which was part of </p>
<p>the changing picture”.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Straw said that Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council had </p>
<p>been made “forensically and calmly, with well chosen examples from intelligence of Iraqi </p>
<p>mendacity”. The “true colour and substance of the Iraqi regime had been highlighted”.</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Straw’s view was that “it should be possible to gain consensus for a further </p>
<p>resolution” if the inspectors returned “without real concessions on Iraqi compliance”. </p>
<p>The  focus “had to remain” on the UN route: “We could now be entering the final phase” </p>
<p>with the next report to the Council on 14 February.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Straw also said that the aftermath was “being discussed intensively” with </p>
<p>Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, and Mr Geoff Hoon, the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> The points made in discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of the word “aftermath” was “ill&#8209;chosen: it incorrectly implied that Iraq </p>
<p>would be utterly destroyed by military conflict whereas we should gear our </p>
<p>thinking around the future of the people of Iraq and their interests”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reconstruction and development of Iraq would “provide opportunities </p>
<p>for British companies to be involved”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The focus after hostilities “had to be on civil society which had suffered 35 years </p>
<p>of tyranny that had reduced the country to the point where 60 percent of the </p>
<p>population relied on United Nations food programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US inter&#8209;agency process to address Iraq’s redevelopment after any military </p>
<p>action<b> </b>was being led by the Pentagon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “essential” that the UN should be involved in Iraq’s redevelopment after </p>
<p>any military action “to avoid the military coalition being viewed as an army of </p>
<p>occupation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The nature of a further resolution “would depend on the circumstances at the </p>
<p>time, but it was likely that there would be a period between the adoption of </p>
<p>a resolution and the start of any military action so that a final ultimatum could </p>
<p>be given for the departure of the current Iraqi regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>International consensus in support of military action would “encourage public </p>
<p>support” in the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some people “did not recognise the lessons we had learned from not </p>
<p>confronting tyranny in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and now Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Briefing on the Government’s position on Iraq “should be improved and </p>
<p>disseminated widely; it was clear that colleagues were operating at different </p>
<p>levels of knowledge, and it would be helpful if the best possible information </p>
<p>about the facts were available to enable them to advance the best possible </p>
<p>arguments”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Parliament would need an opportunity to debate any further UN resolution.</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… Ministers needed to be active with their supporters, both inside and outside </p>
<p>Parliament, to make the case. Briefing material had to be improved so that the </p>
<p>facts were drawn together in a coherent form under various headings: the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime; the United Nations’ involvement; non&#8209; compliance by Iraq with the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors; the humanitarian angle, all of which would need to be updated regularly.”</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The UK would continue to pursue the UN route. That was “important in respect </p>
<p>of Iraq, but it was also necessary in dealing with a dysfunctional world where a broad </p>
<p>agenda had to be addressed to deal with poverty, the Middle East Peace Process, </p>
<p>terrorism and weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had “put a pretty optimistic face” on the reports of his meetings with </p>
<p>President Bush and President Chirac.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Robin Cook, then Leader of the House of Commons, had quizzed on the </p>

<p>Dr John Reid, Minister without Portfolio and Labour Party Chair, “said he was </p>
<p>troubled about the lack of domestic consensus, that there was a sense of people </p>
<p>losing their moral compass about the nature of the Iraqi regime”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Tessa Jowell, the Culture, Media and Sport Secretary, “didn’t know anyone </p>
<p>under twenty five who supported action and we had to do better at countering </p>
<p>the scepticism”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>110. </b> Following Cabinet, Mr Blair asked Mr John Scarlett, Chairman of the Joint </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee (JIC), “to provide a confidential and intelligence based briefing </p>
<p>on Iraq for small groups of Ministers attending Cabinet”. The briefing would “take as its </p>
<p>starting point Part 1 of the Government’s dossier published last September” and cover:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “latest assessment of Iraq’s holding of weapons of mass destruction”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi response to resolution 1441;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“recent developments in Iraq and our current assessment of the cohesion </p>
<p>of the regime”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq and terrorism”.</p>

<p><b>112.  In meetings on 6 February, Mr Blair told Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei that he </b></p>

<p><b>113.  Mr Straw told Dr ElBaradei that Saddam Hussein would choose exile only </b></p>

<p><b>114.  Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC’s next quarterly report, due on 1 March, would </b></p>
<p><b>identify “clusters” of issues that could be used to pose sharp questions for Iraq, </b></p>
<p><b>possibly as part of an ultimatum.</b></p>
<p><b>115.  Dr Blix reminded Mr Blair that the material described as “unaccounted for” </b></p>
<p><b>in UNSCOM’s report of 1999 was not necessarily present in Iraq; and that it would </b></p>
<p><b>be “paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn out to be very little”.</b></p>
<p><b>116.  Dr Blix told Mr Straw he thought Iraq had prohibited programmes, and </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>117. </b> Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei met Mr Blair and Mr Straw on 6 February, before a visit </p>
<p>to Baghdad on 8 to 9 February.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>118. </b> The FCO briefing note stated that:</p>
<p>“Since the Prime Minister last saw Blix on 17 January, he has hardly put a foot </p>
<p>wrong. His statement to the UN Security Council (UNSC) on 27 January was </p>
<p>stronger than many expected: in particular he helpfully made clear that Iraq was </p>
<p>not offering the full and active co&#8209;operation that the UNSC expected, and there </p>
<p>were serious unanswered questions, and that Iraq still did not accept that it had </p>
<p>to disarm.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>119. </b> In the meeting with Mr Blair, Dr Blix registered a number of questions about </p>
<p>Secretary Powell’s briefing to the Security Council the previous day.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> He also said </p>
<p>that intelligence leads had so far produced only one success.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> The record of the meeting stated that Dr Blix:</p>
<p>“… would seek to resolve three relatively minor points related to process: </p>
<p>U2 overflights, interviews, and Iraqi domestic legislation. His approach would be </p>
<p>that the Iraqis had better come up with co&#8209;operation on substance … If Saddam </p>
<p>decided to be as helpful on substance as he was on process, fine.”</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Blair doubted that Saddam Hussein would co&#8209;operate:</p>
<p>“He would try some trick to divide the Security Council. Retaining his WMD was </p>
<p>essential to his own view of his grip on Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> Dr Blix reminded Mr Blair that: “UNSCOM had not reported that the 1999  </p>
<p>left&#8209;overs were present in Iraq, just that they were unaccounted for.” UNMOVIC was </p>
<p>more cautious than the UK, but Dr Blix agreed that if Iraq did not have documents it </p>
<p>should be more eager to allow interviews to go ahead. There was a stalemate on the </p>
<p>issue. The inspectors might have to ask for interviews without minders, but Dr Blix was </p>
<p>uneasy about risking people’s lives.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Dr Blix was reported to have informed Mr Blair that his report to the Security </p>
<p>Council on 14 February would probably contain a “balance sheet”. His last assessment </p>
<p>had been “honest but harsh”; the next might have to say that the inspectors “had not </p>
<p>found any WMD”.</p>

<p>be paradoxical to go to war for something that might turn out to be very little”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied that “if Saddam had no or little WMD he should prove it”.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, reported that </p>
<p>Sir David Manning had:</p>
<p>“… underlined we were confident of our judgements on Iraq’s CBW. If the inspectors </p>
<p>had difficulty finding it, this was because Saddam was not co&#8209;operating.”</p>
<p><b>127. </b> In response to a question from Dr Blix about when Saddam Hussein might crack, </p>
<p>Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… thought the moment of maximum pressure might be after a second resolution </p>
<p>(following a clear Blix report) when the Arab world might encourage Saddam and </p>
<p>his immediate entourage to leave Iraq. The logic was that Iraq was not co&#8209;operating; </p>
<p>we should have a second resolution saying he was in breach; and then we should </p>
<p>mobilise the international community to try and get him to leave so that we did not </p>
<p>have to resort to military action. The best way to avoid a conflict would be to take </p>
<p>a very tough line.”</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Dr Blix felt that Secretary Powell had done well but was </p>
<p>avoiding comment.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> Dr Blix was “pretty cagey” and had “made clear his job was to be </p>
<p>sceptical”. Dr Blix was talking to Iraq about enhanced co&#8209;operation and trying to resolve </p>
<p>the issues of anthrax and VX: “On the remnants of old programmes they should be able </p>
<p>to tell us.”</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Dr Blix had told Mr Blair that South Africa was sending a delegation to Iraq </p>
<p>to tell them how to give up WMD. The inspectors had been to some of the places </p>
<p>named in the dossier, “and it could be that they had been sanitised, but they found </p>
<p>nothing”. By 14 February, Dr Blix “would be saying they had not found WMD but there </p>
<p>was no real co&#8209;operation. He didn’t want to name scientists for interview for fear that </p>
<p>they would be killed.” Dr Blix “felt … 14 February was a little early to report to the </p>
<p>UN [Security Council]”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair “said he felt Iraq would come up with some </p>
<p>surprise to split the international community, that intelligence showed he would regard </p>
<p>giving up WMD as a total humiliation, and it was essential to his internal grip”.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Mr Campbell commented that Dr Blix “was a lot less bullish than last time and </p>
<p>clearly fed up with the feeling he was being bullied by America”.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> In his subsequent meeting with Mr Straw, Dr Blix was reported to have told </p>
<p>Mr Straw that his next report to the Security Council might include what the Iraqis </p>
<p>had not yet proved they did not have, rather than much evidence of what UNMOVIC </p>
<p>had found.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Dr Blix had clear indications that anthrax had been weaponised and his personal </p>
<p>judgement was that Iraq did have programmes and definitely possessed the ability </p>
<p>to jump&#8209;start BW programmes. The trick would be to find evidence.</p>
<p><b>134. </b> Dr Blix also told Mr Straw that if the Al Samoud missiles were found to be illegal, </p>
<p>they would be destroyed. That could force a real confrontation with the Iraqis who were </p>
<p>not keen to lose billions of dollars of armaments at a time when they were threatened </p>
<p>with military action.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Dr ElBaradei was reported to have told Mr Straw that he would press Iraq hard on </p>
<p>possible uranium imports and interviews. He did not expect much movement from Iraq </p>
<p>and tough messages from the international community could only help the inspectors.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> When Dr ElBaradei raised the possibility of building an option for exile into the </p>
<p>second resolution, Mr Straw responded that Saddam Hussein would “choose exile </p>
<p>(if at all) only if he was convinced that was his only chance of survival”. Mr Straw did </p>
<p>not favour including it in a second resolution. If a strong resolution was passed, there </p>
<p>would be “enough time [for Saddam Hussein] to consider his options” and for “high level </p>
<p>envoys to help him make the right choice”.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> Mr Straw encouraged Dr ElBaradei to focus on interviews; the UK had portable </p>
<p>“safe rooms” and could provide them to the IAEA and UNMOVIC if it helped. </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei reported that the scientists he had interviewed were clearly extremely </p>
<p>nervous, but he saw great difficulties with conducting interviews overseas.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> The record of the discussion with Mr Blair reported that Dr ElBaradei thought </p>
<p>opinion was moving towards a second resolution.</p>

<p>“Not all members agreed with the US timing … Iraq was not co&#8209;operating. Unless </p>
<p>there were clear signs of an Iraqi change of heart on co&#8209;operation, (both process, </p>
<p>including interviews, and substance), UNSCR 1441 would have to be implemented. </p>
<p>Not allowing interviews was a lack of full co&#8209;operation … dribbling out concessions </p>
<p>was not full co&#8209;operation … His 14 February report would be a clear as possible.”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> In Dr ElBaradei’s view, CBW was the key.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> On nuclear issues, the inspectors continued to assess the aluminium tubes. </p>
<p>Reports of the possible import of uranium were: “Much more disturbing … There could </p>
<p>only be one reason for such an import.”</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Dr ElBaradei told Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“If satisfactory co&#8209;operation was not forthcoming, the next best outcome would </p>
<p>be to force Saddam … out … [He] did not oppose more time for inspections. Any </p>
<p>war would risk radicalising the region. It should be UN&#8209;controlled. As should the </p>
<p>future Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>143. </b> The No.10 record stated that Mr Blair had made clear to both Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei “the importance of putting Iraqis on the spot with some sharp questions, </p>
<p>to show whether they were co&#8209;operating fully or not”. He had “also emphasised the </p>
<p>importance of interviews”.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> In Mr Blair’s view: “Our best chance of avoiding war was a clear verdict from the </p>
<p>inspectors followed by a massive international effort to get Saddam to go.”</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had told Dr ElBaradei that:</p>
<p>“… we had to sort out Saddam in as peaceful way as possible, but above all sort out </p>
<p>MEPP. Saddam’s duty was one hundred per cent co&#8209;operation, not hide and seek … </p>
<p>[I]f there was a breach, there would be second resolution and then we could build </p>
<p>pressure on him to go.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that Dr ElBaradei:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had said the Iraqis claimed they never tried to get uranium but it wasn’t true;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>did not think many tears would be shed in the Arab world if Saddam went;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was worried that Iraq would claim it was being attacked not because of weapons </p>
<p>but because they were a Muslim country;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>of a vision of a zone free of nuclear weapons;</p>

<p><b>147. </b> At the FCO Iraq morning meeting on 7 February, it was reported that Dr Blix and </p>

<p><b>President Bush’s statement, 6 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>148.  In a statement on 6 February, President Bush said that Saddam Hussein was </b></p>
<p><b>throwing away his final opportunity to disarm voluntarily.</b></p>
<p><b>149.  President Bush reiterated that he would “welcome” a second resolution, </b></p>
<p><b>as he stated in the press conference with Mr Blair on 31 January, “which made </b></p>
<p><b>clear the Security Council stands behind its previous demands”.</b></p>
<p><b>150.  The “game” was “over” and the US was resolved to take whatever action </b></p>
<p><b>was necessary to defend itself and to disarm the Iraqi regime.</b></p>
<p><b>151. </b> On 5 February, Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed President Bush’s </p>
<p>statement and the possibility that he might “lean forward” on a second resolution.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> </p>
<p>President Bush would not seek a second resolution for its own sake, but he was open </p>
<p>to one if others wanted it.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> In a statement on 6 February, President Bush emphasised the challenges of </p>
<p>uncovering secret information in a totalitarian society.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> He stated that Iraqi violations </p>
<p>of Security Council resolutions were “evident, and they continue to this hour”. </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime had “never accounted for a vast arsenal of deadly biological and </p>
<p>chemical weapons” and it was “pursuing an elaborate campaign to conceal its weapons </p>
<p>materiels, and to hide or intimidate key experts and scientists”, directed “from the very </p>
<p>highest levels”.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> President Bush set out examples of Iraq’s violations, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Firsthand witnesses have informed us that Iraq has at least seven mobile </p>
<p>factories for the production of biological agents” that “could produce within just </p>
<p>months hundreds of pounds of biological poisons”.</p>

<p>Iraq might pass weapons of mass destruction to terrorists, had “provided </p>
<p>Al Qaida with chemical and biological weapons training”, and was “harbouring </p>
<p>a terrorist network, headed by a senior Al Qaida terrorist planner”. That network </p>
<p>ran “a poison and explosive training center in northeast Iraq”, was “responsible </p>
<p>for the murder … of an American diplomat”, and “was caught producing poisons </p>
<p>in London”.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> President Bush stated that resolution 1441 had given Saddam Hussein a final </p>
<p>chance, and that he was “throwing that chance away”. Having made its demands, the </p>
<p>Security Council “must not back down, when those demands are defied and mocked </p>
<p>by a dictator”.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Referring to a second resolution, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“The United States would welcome and support a resolution which makes clear that </p>
<p>the Security Council stands behind its previous demands. Yet resolutions mean little </p>
<p>without resolve. And the United States, along with a growing coalition of nations, </p>
<p>is resolved to take whatever action is necessary to defend ourselves and disarm </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>“… We will not wait to see what terrorists and terrorist states could do with chemical, </p>

<p>to begin another round of empty concessions, transparently false denials. No doubt, </p>
<p>he will play a last&#8209;minute game of deception. The game is over.</p>
<p>“All the world can rise to this moment … The United Nations can renew its purpose </p>
<p>and be a source of stability and security in the world. The Security Council can affirm </p>
<p>that it is able and prepared to meet future challenges … And we can give the Iraqi </p>

<p><b>159. </b> During the interview Mr Jeremy Paxman challenged Mr Blair on a number </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>whether Iraq posed a clear and imminent danger to the UK or was a potential </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>what had changed since Mr Blair had stated in November 2000 that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was being effectively contained;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the inspectors had not been “thrown out” of Iraq in 1998, but had withdrawn;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether, if the inspectors were present in Iraq, it would be “impossible for </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to continue developing weapons of mass destruction”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what evidence there was of Iraqi concealment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how much time and space the inspectors needed to do their job;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether Mr Blair would “give an undertaking” that he would “seek another </p>
<p>UN resolution specifically authorising the use of force”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of links between Baghdad and Al Qaida; and</p>

<p>from a panel of voters are set out below.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Explaining his position on a second resolution, Mr Blair stated that “the only </p>
<p>circumstances in which we would agree to use force” would be with a further resolution </p>
<p>“except for one caveat”. That was:</p>
<p>“If the inspectors do report that they can’t do their work properly because Iraq is not </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating there’s no doubt that under the terms of the existing United Nations </p>
<p>resolution that that’s a breach of the resolution. In those circumstances there should </p>
<p>be a further resolution.</p>
<p>“… If a country unreasonably in those circumstances put down a veto then I would </p>
<p>consider action outside of that.”</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Pressed whether he considered he was “absolutely free to defy the express will </p>
<p>of the Security Council”, Mr Blair responded that he could not “just do it with America”, </p>
<p>there would have to be “a majority in the Security Council”:</p>
<p>“[The] issue of a veto doesn’t even arise unless you get a majority in the Security </p>
<p>Council. Secondly, the choice … is … If the will of the UN is the thing that is </p>
<p>most important and I agree that it is, if there is a breach of resolution 1441… and </p>
<p>we do nothing then we have flouted the will of the UN.”</p>

<p><b>163. </b> Asked if he was saying that there was already an authorisation for war, </p>
<p>Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“No, what I am saying is … In the resolution [1441] … we said that Iraq … had … </p>
<p>a final opportunity to comply.</p>
<p>“The duty of compliance was defined as full co&#8209;operation with the UN inspectors. </p>
<p>The resolution … say[s] any failure to co&#8209;operate fully is a breach of this resolution </p>
<p>and serious consequences i.e. action, would follow … [W]e then also put in that </p>
<p>resolution that there will be a further discussion in the Security Council. But the clear </p>
<p>understanding was that if the inspectors say that Iraq is not complying and there </p>
<p>is a breach … then we have to act.</p>
<p>“… if someone … says … I accept there’s a breach … but I’m issuing a veto </p>
<p>I think that would be unreasonable … I don’t think that’s what will happen. I think </p>
<p>that … if the inspectors do end up in a situation where they’re saying there is not </p>
<p>compliance by Iraq, then I think a second resolution will issue.”</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Asked whether he agreed it was “important to get France, Russia and Germany </p>
<p>on board”, Mr Blair replied, “Yes … That’s what I am trying to get.”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Asked if he would “give an undertaking that he wouldn’t go to war without their </p>
<p>agreement”, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… supposing in circumstances where there plainly was breach … and everyone </p>
<p>else wished to take action, one of them put down a veto. In those circumstances it </p>
<p>would be unreasonable.</p>
<p>“Then I think it [not to act] would be wrong because otherwise you couldn’t uphold </p>
<p>the UN. Because you would have passed your resolution and then you’d have failed </p>
<p>to act on it.”</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Asked whether it was for the UK to judge what was “unreasonable”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>envisaged that would be in circumstances where the inspectors, not the UK, had </p>
<p>reported to the Council that they could not do their job.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Asked if the US and UK went ahead without a UN resolution would any other </p>
<p>country listen to the UN in the future, Mr Blair replied that there was “only one set of </p>
<p>circumstances” in which that would happen. Resolution 1441 “effectively” said that if the </p>

<p>THE UK’S POSITION, 7 FEBRUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>168. </b> The FCO sent guidance on “key UN aspects” of the UK’s policy on Iraq </p>
<p>to diplomatic posts on 7 February.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> Extracts from the guidance are summarised  </p>
<p>in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>FCO guidance on the UK’s position, 7 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>Can anyone launch military action without a further Security Council resolution?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had said that, if there was a material breach, the Government’s </p>
<p>preference was for a second resolution. So far the Security Council had “faced </p>
<p>up to its responsibilities”. The UK believed it would continue to do so, but had to </p>
<p>“reserve our position in the event it does not”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any failure by Iraq to comply would have serious consequences. The action </p>
<p>necessary to bring Iraq into compliance would “depend on the circumstances </p>
<p>at the time”.</p>
<p><b>Does Iraq’s declaration of 7 December mean that Iraq is co-operating?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The declaration did not contain “any new evidence that would eliminate the </p>
<p>outstanding disarmament questions or reduce their number”; and it was “not the </p>
<p>full and complete declaration required by resolution 1441”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had published a list of “10 outstanding questions, identified by Dr Blix, </p>
<p>that Iraq must answer”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam and his officials would do well to remember that concealment is not </p>
<p>compliance. Only declarations supported by evidence will give confidence in </p>
<p>a country with such a long history … of avoiding disclosures.”</p>
<p><b>Is Iraq co-operating with inspectors?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s update of 27 January had “highlighted a number of instances of Iraqi </p>
<p>non&#8209;co&#8209;operation …: failing to answer outstanding issues, identified by UNSCOM; </p>
<p>obstructing U2 reconnaissance flights; hindering interviews; some instances of </p>
<p>harassment of the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>Is Iraq in material breach?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 was clear: “false statements or omissions in the declaration and </p>
<p>failure to co&#8209;operate fully with the inspectors shall constitute a further material </p>
<p>breach of Iraq’s obligations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had made clear “Iraq has failed both tests”. The “inescapable </p>
<p>conclusion” was that Iraq was “now in material breach”. War was “not inevitable. </p>
<p>But the responsibility to avoid conflict rests with Saddam Hussein.”</p>

<p>209</p>
<p><b>Did Mr Straw’s judgement that Iraq is in material breach mean the UK is taking the </b></p>
<p><b>issue to the Council under paragraph 4 of the resolution and “going for a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution authorising military action”?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Council, through its meetings last week, and in future meetings such </p>
<p>as those scheduled for 5 and 14 February, is continuously assessing Iraq’s </p>
<p>compliance.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Resolution 1441 warned that Iraq would face ‘serious consequences’ if it failed </p>
<p>to comply. We expect the Security Council to live up to its responsibilities.”</p>
<p><b>How much time is left?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It is not a matter of time it is a matter of attitude. And the attitude we’re getting </p>
<p>from the Iraqis at the moment is just not sufficient for the eradication of the </p>
<p>programmes we know about.”</p>
<p><b>What chance is there of Security Council agreement to authorise the use of force?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The unanimous adoption of resolution 1441 showed the “clear determination” of </p>
<p>the Council to ensure Iraq fulfilled its obligations; it was “the toughest resolution </p>
<p>on Iraq for years. Iraqis and others should be in no doubt that members of the </p>
<p>Council are determined to ensure its implementation.”</p>
<p><b>UNMOVIC’s powers/chances of success?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK Government was “committed” to giving UNMOVIC the necessary support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “concealing WMD programmes … including through the use of mobile </p>
<p>facilities and hindering inspectors’ efforts to interview personnel”.</p>

<p><b>171.  Mr Annan called for unity and warned of the consequences of the use of </b></p>
<p><b>force without the legitimacy provided by the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>172. </b> In a speech in Williamsburg, Virginia, on 8 February 2003, Mr Annan addressed </p>
<p>the “anxiety, in this country and throughout the world about the prospect of war in Iraq”.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN had been founded “to save succeeding generations from the scourge </p>
<p>of war”, which “We all – and, first and foremost, the leaders of Iraq itself – have </p>
<p>a duty to prevent it if we possibly can.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But “there would be times when force must be met with force”; and there were </p>
<p>provisions in the UN Charter “to enable the world community to unite against </p>
<p>aggression and defeat it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “not yet satisfied the Security Council that it has fully disarmed itself </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That was “an issue not for any State alone, but for the international community </p>
<p>as a whole. When States decide to use force, not in self&#8209;defence but to deal with </p>
<p>broader threats to international peace and security, there is no substitute for the </p>
<p>unique legitimacy provided by the United Nations Security Council. States and </p>
<p>peoples around the world attach fundamental importance to such legitimacy, </p>
<p>and to the international rule of law.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “vitally important” that the whole international community acted in a </p>
<p>“united way – so as to achieve greater security by strengthening, and not </p>
<p>weakening or undermining, the multilateral treaties on disarmament and non&#8209;</p>
<p>proliferation. Only a collective, multilateral approach can effectively curb the </p>
<p>proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and make the world a safer place.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN had “the duty to exhaust all the possibilities of peaceful settlement, </p>
<p>before resorting to the use of force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “thanks in large part to the firm challenge issued by President Bush – and </p>
<p>the pressure that followed it – that the inspectors are back in Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “total unanimity” that “Iraq must disarm, and must do so pro&#8209;actively”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Success in getting Iraq to disarm “by effective and credible inspections” would </p>
<p>be a great prize.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq failed to make use of the “last chance” provided in resolution 1441, and </p>
<p>continued its defiance, the Council would “have to make another grim choice, </p>
<p>based on the findings of the inspectors … And when that time comes, the </p>
<p>Council must face up to its responsibilities.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In his experience, the Council met its responsibilities “best and most effectively </p>
<p>when its members work in unison. The Council should proceed in a determined, </p>
<p>reflective and deliberate manner. Its measures must be seen as firm, effective, </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>What happened in Iraq would “not take place in a vacuum”; it had “implications </p>
<p>– for better or worse – for other issues of great importance to the US and </p>
<p>to the world. For instance, it will greatly affect the climate in which we conduct </p>

<p>works as a source of collective action rather than discord”.</p>
<p><b>Discussions in Baghdad, 8 to 9 February 2003</b></p>
<p>Dr Blix’s account of the discussions in Baghdad on 8 and 9 February recorded that they </p>
<p>had been “professional and had shed some new light, but had not really brought any new </p>
<p>evidence”.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> He and Dr ElBaradei had been given new assurances that people would </p>
<p>be “encourage[d]” to provide interviews without minders or recording equipment and the </p>
<p>mandate for the special commission appointed to search for any remaining chemical </p>
<p>weapons was extended to cover any prohibited items, but the questions about U&#8209;2 flights </p>
<p>remained unresolved until shortly after the visit.</p>
<p>Dr Blix concluded that they “had obtained much less than we felt was needed” but their </p>
<p>“overall impression” had been that the Iraqis were genuinely rattled”. The Iraqis continued </p>
<p>to do “too little, too late”.</p>

<p>JIC ASSESSMENTS, 10 AND 19 FEBRUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>177.  The Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessment of 10 February reiterated </b></p>
<p><b>earlier warnings, described in Section 3.5, that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Al Qaida and associated networks would remain the greatest terrorist </b></p>
<p><b>threat to the UK and its activity would increase at the onset of any military </b></p>
<p><b>action against Iraq.</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological </b></p>
<p><b>material could be transferred to terrorists, including Al Qaida.</b></p>
<p><b>178. </b> At the request of the MOD and the FCO, on 10 February the JIC assessed </p>
<p>“broader terrorist activity that would be triggered by war with Iraq”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>179. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat from Al Qaida will increase at the onset of any military action </p>
<p>against Iraq. They will target Coalition forces and other Western interests in </p>
<p>the Middle East. Attacks against Western interests elsewhere are also likely, </p>
<p>especially in the US and UK, for maximum impact. The worldwide threat from </p>
<p>other Islamist terrorist groups and individuals will increase significantly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida associates and sympathisers may well attempt chemical or biological </p>
<p>terrorist attacks in the Gulf, including against UK civilian targets there, in the </p>
<p>event of war with Iraq. While individual attacks are likely to be small&#8209;scale they </p>
<p>may be numerous. Individual attacks might inflict relatively few casualties, but </p>
<p>will cause significant alarm.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida associated terrorists in Iraq and in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone </p>
<p>in Northern Iraq could conduct attacks against Coalition forces and interests </p>
<p>during, or in the aftermath of, war with Iraq. But Al Qaida will not carry out </p>
<p>attacks under Iraqi direction.</p>

<p>213</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s own capability to conduct terrorist attacks is limited, especially </p>
<p>outside the Middle East. But the threat of terrorism conducted or directed by </p>
<p>Iraqi Intelligence, including the use of chemical or biological material, cannot </p>
<p>be discounted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material </p>
<p>could be transferred to terrorists including Al Qaida, whether or not as deliberate </p>
<p>regime policy.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida and associated networks will remain the greatest terrorist threat to the </p>
<p>UK. The risk of attacks will increase following any Coalition attack on Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hizballah’s terrorist wing will not conduct attacks in support of Saddam. But </p>
<p>it may attack US forces in Iraq following a campaign, if it judges that the US </p>
<p>intends to act against Hizballah, Syria or Iran. […] Individual Palestinian </p>
<p>terrorists may attack Western interests, without sanction from parent groups.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Other key elements from the Assessment are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>JIC Assessment, 10 February 2003: </b></p>
<p><b>‘International Terrorism: War with Iraq’</b></p>
<p><b>Al Qaida and other Islamist terrorists</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “continuing determination by Al Qaida and other Islamist terrorists </p>
<p>to attack Western interests around the globe”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “previously judged that Al Qaida and other Islamist terrorists may </p>
<p>initiate attacks in response to Coalition military action against Iraq, and that Al </p>
<p>Qaida will use an attack on Iraq as further justification for terrorist attacks in the </p>
<p>West and Israel”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some reports indicated that Usama Bin Laden had “instructed that there should </p>
<p>be no terrorist attacks before the start of a conflict”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida intended “to exploit both anti&#8209;Western sentiment within the Muslim world, </p>
<p>and the preoccupation of the US and UK that would come from action against Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida or associated groups might “also seek to conduct attacks against Israel, </p>
<p>intended to provoke a reaction that would further inflame feeling within the Islamic </p>
<p>world”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC believed that Islamist terrorists had manufactured and stockpiled </p>
<p>chemical and biological (CB) material intended for attacks against both UK </p>
<p>and US targets in the Gulf, and that: “Instructions for production of similar CB </p>
<p>materials” had been “distributed by Gulf&#8209;based terrorists to extremists”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had<b> </b>“<b>some doubts about the viability of the proposed attack </b></p>
<p><b>methods</b>”, but judged there was “<b>a serious intention to use CB weapons</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Even if successful, individual attacks might inflict relatively few casualties. </p>
<p>But attacks could be numerous and cause significant alarm.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of CB materials was “an increasing aspiration of Islamic extremists </p>
<p>globally, including in Europe”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Such material may be manufactured locally or provided by production facilities </p>
<p>such as that operating in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone (KAZ) in Northern Iraq.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no intelligence” that Iraq had “provided CB materials to Al Qaida”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued “to judge that <b>in the event of imminent regime collapse </b></p>
<p><b>there would be a risk of transfer of such material, whether or not as </b></p>
<p><b>deliberate Iraqi regime policy”</b>.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC also judged that Al Qaida retained “its long&#8209;standing interest in acquiring </p>
<p>a nuclear device”, but had “no convincing intelligence that it has done so”.</p>
<p><b>Al Qaida in Iraq</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no intelligence” to suggest that Al Qaida planned to carry out attacks </p>
<p>under Iraqi direction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence showed “the presence of Al Qaida associated extremists in </p>
<p>Baghdad. […] We do not know what the current presence is, its purpose, or what </p>
<p>relationship it has to Saddam’s regime, if any.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that it was “unlikely that the Iraqi regime” were “unaware” of the </p>
<p>Al Qaida presence but it did not know whether those terrorists planned to conduct </p>
<p>activities in or from Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence suggested “the presence of […] Al Qaida&#8209;linked terrorists in North </p>
<p>Eastern Iraq, in the KAZ, with safe haven provided by Ansar al&#8209;Islam, an Al Qaida&#8209;</p>
<p>associated extremist group”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Some of these individuals” were “involved in production and distribution </p>
<p>of CB materials”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence showed that extremists continued to arrive in the region.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The terrorists might “re&#8209;locate in the event of imminent Coalition action” but </p>
<p>“equally they <b>could conduct terrorist activities (including possible use of CB </b></p>
<p><b>materials) or guerrilla actions against Coalition forces in Iraq</b>”.</p>
<p><b>Iraqi terrorism</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had previously judged that Saddam Hussein “would aspire to conduct </p>
<p>terrorist attacks against Coalition interests in the event of military action against </p>
<p>him, or possibly if he believed an attack was inevitable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Authoritative reporting suggested that “<b>Iraqi Intelligence (DGI) has little reach </b></p>
<p><b>or capability outside Iraq</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “no intelligence of Iraqi intentions to conduct CB terrorist attacks </p>
<p>using DGI or its agents; but such activity remains a possibility”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi plans for terrorist activity in the event of conflict would be:</p>
<p>“… dependent on individual operatives’ willingness to implement them, which </p>
<p>will be in doubt if they perceive regime change to be certain. <b>But the threat </b></p>
<p><b>from terrorism conducted or directed by DGI cannot be discounted</b>.”</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Addressing the prospects for the future, the JIC Assessment concluded:</p>
<p>“Despite a significant body of intelligence on Iraq’s preparations to conduct </p>
<p>terrorism against Western interests, […], we have seen no persuasive evidence </p>
<p>that these efforts will be effective. <b>Al Qaida and associated groups will continue </b></p>
<p><b>to represent by far the greatest terrorist threat to Western interests, and that </b></p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>threat will be heightened by military action against Iraq. </b>The broader threat from </p>
<p>Islamist terrorists will also increase in the event of war, reflecting intensified anti&#8209;US/</p>
<p>anti&#8209;Western sentiment in the Muslim world, including among Muslim communities </p>
<p>in the West. And there is a risk that the transfer of CB material or expertise, during </p>
<p>or in the aftermath of conflict, will enhance Al Qaida’s capabilities.”</p>
<p><b>182. </b> On 11 February, Usama Bin Laden issued a call for Muslims everywhere to take </p>
<p>up arms in defence of Iraq.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> That was followed on 16 February by a call for “compulsory </p>
<p>jihad” by Muslims against the West.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> A Security Service report in February 2003 concluded:</p>
<p>“Iraq is unlikely to use terrorism to attack the worldwide interests of the US and </p>
<p>its allies prior to military action.”</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>184.  A further JIC Assessment on 19 February predicted that the upward trend </b></p>
<p><b>in the reports of threats to the UK was likely to continue.</b></p>
<p><b>185. </b> On 19 February, the JIC updated the December 2002 Assessment of the </p>
<p>continuing threat posed by Al Qaida and associated extremists, including to the UK.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>186. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were that:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A high impact, spectacular, attack is a priority for Al Qaida, most likely against </p>
<p>American or British interests in the Gulf, US or UK. Al Qaida will also seek to </p>
<p>conduct frequent, perhaps multiple, small&#8209;scale attacks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat from Islamist terrorists, including Al Qaida, will increase in the event </p>
<p>of war with Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Attacks in the UK could include use of chemical and biological agents, probably </p>
<p>on a small&#8209;scale (though potentially causing significant alarm). But conventional </p>
<p>attacks remain more likely. UK interests are now on a par with US targets for </p>
<p>some Islamist terrorists, although the US is likely to remain the priority for most.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Both large and small&#8209;scale attacks overseas could include use of chemical, </p>
<p>biological (or radiological) materials.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bin Laden’s 11 February statement is probably linked to Al Qaida’s intent </p>
<p>to attack Coalition targets in the event of war with Iraq, rather than intended </p>
<p>to trigger attacks before then.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There are differences within the leadership of Al Qaida over strategy, although </p>
<p>these do not so far appear to indicate any diminution of the threat.”</p>

<p>There were suggestions that UK interests were “<b>on a par with US targets</b> </p>
<p>for some Islamist terrorists” although it was “likely that the US” would “remain </p>
<p>the priority for most”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat of a “conventional’ attack” in the UK remained “a major concern”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The<b> </b>“<b>threat of CB attacks in the UK</b>”<b> </b>remained; they “would probably be  </p>
<p>small&#8209;scale (but potentially high impact)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “a particularly high number of threat reports” during the previous </p>
<p>“two months”, although “only a small proportion” would “materialise into terrorist </p>
<p>action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “upward trend” was “likely to continue” as a possible conflict with Iraq </p>
<p>approached.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Usama Bin Laden’s statement of 11 February was “unlikely to be the trigger </p>
<p>for attacks by Islamist extremists”, although it would “enable him to take credit </p>
<p>for attacks conducted in response to a war with Iraq”.</p>

<p>unlikely that the UK would circulate a draft resolution the following week.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> There were </p>
<p>likely to be difficulties in the Council.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> In a discussion with Ambassador John Negroponte, US Permanent Representative </p>
<p>to the UN, Sir Jeremy had emphasised the importance of a draft which “helped bring </p>
<p>people on board”. That would determine whether to include an ultimatum and whether </p>
<p>to mention “serious consequences” or “all necessary means”.</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office forwarded advice on the timings and tactics for a second </p>
<p>resolution to Sir David Manning on 10 February.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>199. </b> The FCO advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Only four votes in the Security Council (the US, UK, Bulgaria and Spain) could </p>
<p>be “counted on” for a second resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia, Chile and Pakistan could be “moving in our direction” and China also </p>
<p>seemed “to be moving away from a veto”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France, Germany and Syria remained “strongly opposed” and Mexico was </p>
<p>“highly sceptical”. The position of France and President Chirac was described </p>
<p>as “heavily dependent on strength of evidence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Guinea, Cameroon and Angola might be “coming round to supporting a second </p>
<p>resolution but needed working on”.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> The FCO provided a more detailed matrix summarising the positions of the UN </p>
<p>Security Council members with proposals for further lobbying by the UK and others, but </p>
<p>concluded that “without more dramatic evidence of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance, most members </p>
<p>of the UNSC will remain non&#8209;committal”.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> On the text of a second resolution, the FCO advised that it would be “impossible </p>
<p>to obtain support for a second resolution explicitly authorising ‘all necessary means’”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The FCO identified three options which, it believed, met the legal requirements </p>
<p>and reflected Lord Goldsmith’s advice, that “the key element of any resolution would </p>
<p>be a sufficient link back [to] resolution 1441, to establish that the [Security] Council has </p>
<p>concluded that Iraq has failed to take its ‘final opportunity’”.</p>
<p><b>203. </b> All three options included a first operative paragraph (OP) stating that the Security </p>
<p>Council decided that:</p>
<p>“Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity afforded to it in resolution 1441 (2002) by </p>
<p>submitting a declaration pursuant to that resolution containing [false statements and] </p>
<p>omissions and by failing to comply with and co&#8209;operate fully in the implementation </p>
<p>of, that resolution”.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> The options also included a final OP determining that the Council had decided </p>
<p>“to remain seized of the matter”.</p>
<p><b>205. </b> The difference between the three options was whether to include an additional </p>
<p>OP containing an “ultimatum”, “couched in general terms”.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> To avoid the risk of opening up the debate about whether a further determination </p>
<p>that Iraq had failed to comply with the ultimatum was needed from the Security Council, </p>
<p>the FCO proposed “a formula which would, in effect, authorise action against Iraq unless </p>
<p>the Council took the decision that Iraq had decided to come into compliance”.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The FCO draft proposed: “unless … the Council concludes before 5 March that the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq has taken an unconditional and irreversible decision [at the highest </p>
<p>levels] to come into compliance with its obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and </p>
<p>previous relevant resolutions” either:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the final opportunity granted to Iraq in resolution 1441 (2002) will expire on </p>
<p>5 March 2003”; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq will face the serious consequences it has been repeatedly warned of, </p>
<p>including in paragraph 13 of resolution 1441 (2202)”.</p>
<p><b>208. </b> The draft provided for the decision to be “based on” reports from Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei.</p>
<p><b>209. </b> The FCO explained that it was:</p>
<p>“… possible to imagine more explicit options, particularly those which include an </p>
<p>explicit finding that Iraq is in ‘material breach’. This would not be strictly necessary </p>
<p>from a legal point of view. But, as a matter of tactics, we will need to consider with </p>
<p>the Americans whether we should start with a more ambitious text …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>215.  France, Germany and Russia issued a tripartite declaration on 10 February, </b></p>
<p><b>reaffirming the objective of disarming Iraq as soon as possible but stating that </b></p>
<p><b>potential of resolution 1441 for peaceful disarmament had not yet been fully </b></p>
<p><b>explored.</b></p>
<p><b>216.  Sir John Holmes described the declaration as “a symbolic act” which </b></p>
<p><b>was “significant”.</b></p>
<p><b>217. </b> In a press conference in Paris on 10 February, President Chirac and President </p>
<p>Putin issued a tripartite declaration on behalf of the Governments of France, Germany </p>
<p>and Russia which stressed the alternatives to the use of force, and the need to give </p>
<p>peaceful disarmament every opportunity.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>218. </b> The main points of the declaration were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reaffirmation that disarmament of Iraq in accordance with a series of resolutions </p>
<p>following resolution 687 (1991) remained the common aim of the international </p>
<p>community and must be achieved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The solution “must be inspired” by the principles of the UN Charter as stated </p>
<p>recently by Mr Annan in his speech of 8 February.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 (2002) offered a framework but its “possibilities” had “not yet </p>
<p>been fully explored”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspections had “already yielded results”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The three countries favoured “the continuation of the inspections and the </p>
<p>substantial strengthening of their human and technical capacities by all possible </p>
<p>means”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “still an alternative to war”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of force could “only be considered as a last resort”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The three countries were “determined to give every chance to the peaceful </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had to “co&#8209;operate actively” with the inspectors and “face up to its </p>
<p>responsibilities in full”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The position expressed reflected that “of a large number of countries, particularly </p>
<p>within the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Sir John Holmes, told the Inquiry that the tripartite declaration was: “a symbolic act </p>
<p>… to say something very different from what we and others were saying at the time”, </p>
<p>which “was, of course, significant”.</p>

<p><b>220. </b> The British Embassy Moscow reported on 13 February that, during the visit to </p>
<p>France, President Putin had said “so far we see no need to exercise our right of veto”; </p>
<p>and it was also reported that he had then said that “with France or alone”, Russia would </p>
<p>veto an “unreasonable use of force”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> He had described the tripartite declaration as </p>
<p>“the first attempt since the Second World War to settle a serious and acute international </p>
<p>issue outside the regime of blocs”; and “if we want the world to be more predictable, and </p>
<p>easier to forecast, and therefore a safer place, it should be a multipolar world”.</p>
<p><b>221. </b> The Embassy also reported that, referring to the veto in a subsequent conversation </p>
<p>with journalists in Bordeaux, President Putin had said: “We have used this right more </p>
<p>than once, and we can do it again.” He had also warned against “fuelling controversy </p>
<p>over this issue”, and stressed that “Russia will never return to the state of conflict with </p>
<p>its partners either in Europe or North America.”</p>
<p><b>222. </b> The Embassy commented that President Putin’s remarks in France had “had a </p>
<p>harder edge to them. But this is probably in part a negotiating tactic in advance of the </p>
<p>series of key events … over the next few days; and in part a desire to please his host.” </p>
<p>The French Embassy in Moscow continued to “believe that Russia would not veto” </p>
<p>a second resolution.</p>
<p><b>The US position, 10 and 11 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>223.  After consultations in New York on 10 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </b></p>
<p><b>reported that the US priority was to “pour cold water” on the tripartite proposals.</b></p>
<p><b>224.  The US was “very hesitant” about the UK’s ideas for an ultimatum.</b></p>
<p><b>225. </b> Following discussions in New York on 10 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>reported that the US had agreed there should be no action in the Security Council </p>
<p>until after 14 February; the immediate priority was “to pour cold water on the latest </p>
<p>Franco&#8209;German ideas”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that France had written to Dr Blix to expand its ideas </p>
<p>for strengthening the inspection regime, drawing on the tripartite declaration, but had </p>
<p>declined to share the text until Dr Blix had responded.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the US was “still very hesitant about any </p>
<p>variant of the ultimatum”, because it would give the Security Council a second chance </p>
<p>to consider whether the ultimatum had been implemented. By putting the onus on the </p>
<p>reports of the inspectors, it could also give them an effective veto. Sir Jeremy had </p>
<p>informed Ambassador Negroponte that the UK needed “a second stage of Council </p>
<p>action beyond 1441, and a determination, even implicit, of material breach. After further </p>

<p>discussion, Negroponte had “conceded the possibility of issuing an ultimatum provided </p>
<p>that we had the lock in our favour”.</p>
<p><b>228. </b> Separately, Sir Jeremy Greenstock provided a revised draft resolution.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> The draft, </p>
<p>which had been agreed with the US, recalled the provisions of previous resolutions </p>
<p>including resolution 1441 and, anticipating the reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei </p>
<p>on 14 February, added a draft preambular paragraph (PP) suggesting that the Security </p>
<p>Council was “Deeply concerned” that the reports had “made clear” that Iraq had “not </p>
<p>co&#8209;operated fully with inspections nor addressed deficiencies in the declaration” </p>
<p>submitted pursuant to resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> The draft resolution proposed that the Security Council should decide that “Iraq’s </p>
<p>submission of a declaration containing false statements and omissions and continuing </p>
<p>failure to comply with, and co&#8209;operate fully in the implementation of, resolution 1441 </p>
<p>(2002)” constituted “a further material breach of Iraq’s obligations under relevant </p>
<p>resolutions of the Council and that Iraq accordingly has failed to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity afforded to it by the Council in resolution 1441 (2002)”.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> The draft did not contain a deadline, but stated that “Iraq alone” was “fully </p>
<p>responsible for the serious consequences it must now face as a result of its continued </p>
<p>violations of its obligations under the resolutions of the Council”; and that the Council </p>
<p>had decided “to remain seized of the matter”.</p>
<p><b>231.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised that President Bush would not tolerate </b></p>
<p><b>another two months of negotiations. Washington was getting ready for war  </b></p>

<p>Sir Christopher Meyer advised overnight on 10/11 February that: “Washington is getting </p>
<p>ready for war.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>233. </b> Sir Christopher wrote:</p>
<p>“For the Administration and the Hill the time has come to go to war. Powell’s </p>
<p>presentation to the UNSC has boosted public support for war, including support </p>
<p>for action without UN approval, provided that some Allies join in. In Congress it </p>
<p>has silenced most of those who were asking for more evidence. The cautious </p>
<p>multilateralists of both parties now accept that the case has been made …</p>
<p>“The Administration would go to war without a further UNSCR, but knows that  </p>
<p>others need one. For the time being Bush is following the UN route and has said </p>
<p>publicly that he would support a second resolution. But he will not tolerate another </p>
<p>two months’ negotiation. Everything points towards early action, possibly by  </p>

<p>political support, both domestically and within the region, will wane, the longer Bush </p>
<p>is seen to prevaricate.”</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Sir Christopher commented that the US Administration considered that Dr Blix and </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei’s visit to Baghdad had achieved “next to nothing”. It knew:</p>
<p>“… full well that some in the UNSC will seize on the faintest glimmer of hope of Iraqi </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation as a reason to delay decisions. The US bottom line remains full Iraqi </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation …”</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Sir Christopher also commented:</p>
<p>“Although militarily capable of doing so, the US does not want to go it alone. On the </p>
<p>Sunday talk shows, Powell and Rice highlighted the support of eighteen European </p>
<p>allies and of Turkey and Jordan …”</p>
<p><b>236. </b> Referring to the “shenanigans in NATO over precautionary planning for the defence </p>
<p>of Turkey”, Sir Christopher added:</p>
<p>“These tussles with the international system will only deepen US scepticism about </p>
<p>a role for the UN in managing the aftermath in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>237.  Mr Blair suggested to President Bush on 11 February that a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution might include a decision that Iraq was in material breach, an ultimatum </b></p>
<p><b>that Saddam should leave, and a timeline.</b></p>
<p><b>238. </b> When he telephoned President Bush on 11 February, Mr Blair discussed opinions </p>
<p>in the UK and international community, including the reports of a Franco&#8209;German “plan” </p>
<p>which had appeared in <i>Der Spiegel</i> and the forthcoming European Council.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Blair suggested that a second resolution might include three main points:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a decision that Iraq was in material breach of UNSCR 1441;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an ultimatum that Saddam should leave; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a timeline.</p>
<p>Even if the ultimatum failed, it would show that the UK had been prepared to resolve </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that, during the telephone call, President Bush had been “very </p>
<p>solicitous” about Mr Blair’s political position and had “said he was determined to help” </p>
<p>get a second resolution.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The record of the discussion confirms Mr Campbell’s comment.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that President Bush had been “livid with the French and </p>
<p>Germans, less so with the Russians.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> But he was just as worried as TB was.” Mr Blair </p>
<p>“said the problem was everyone accepted Saddam was bad, evil, and a threat, but they </p>
<p>didn’t necessarily believe that gave you a reason to go to war. We had to be the people </p>
<p>putting forward one last push for peace.”</p>
<p><b>244. </b> In a subsequent conversation with Dr Rice, Sir David Manning said that in his </p>
<p>report on 14 February, Dr Blix would need to answer the questions which had been </p>
<p>raised at the end of January. They were central to the issue of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>245. </b> In a discussion on public opinion, Sir David Manning said that the position </p>
<p>in the UK was:</p>
<p>“… a great deal more difficult … There was a strong wish to find a peaceful way of </p>
<p>disarming Saddam and avoid taking military action. French and German claims that </p>
<p>this was still possible were seized on eagerly, however implausible the proposals …”</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed the possibility of public statements from </p>
<p>President Bush emphasising that resolving the Iraq crisis through the UN was critical </p>
<p>to the future of the Security Council. Sir David encouraged Dr Rice to consider whether </p>
<p>President Bush would be willing to speak out strongly about the need to give new </p>
<p>impetus to the MEPP: “That would have a great impact” on international opinion.</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that, on 11 February, Mr Blair had “decided that maybe we </p>
<p>took the wrong line” on the <i>Der Spiegel</i> report, “maybe we should say it was interesting </p>
<p>because it accepted conventional inspections wouldn’t work and was effectively arguing </p>
<p>for taking the country over without saying so”. Mr Blair and No.10 officials had “grasped </p>
<p>our way to a plan that was basically wait for Blix, then surface the elements of a second </p>
<p>resolution that included the ultimatum, then Saddam to go, and if he didn’t we were </p>
<p>going to go for it”.</p>

<p>stability in the Middle East, the credibility of the UN and the cause of international law </p>
<p>and collective security”, to confront the challenge posed by Iraq.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Mr Straw argued that international terrorism and the proliferation of WMD were </p>
<p>the “crucial strategic questions of our time” and the response to those threats would </p>
<p>“determine the stability of the world for generations to come”. That was “an awesome </p>
<p>responsibility” which called for “courageous leadership” and required “the vision and </p>
<p>foresight to act decisively and – if necessary – with military force before our worst </p>
<p>nightmares are realised”.</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Saddam Hussein’s regime typified the threat in which rogue regimes sheltered </p>
<p>individuals plotting “mayhem and mass murder in our streets”. Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“Weapons of mass destruction have been a central pillar of Saddam’s dictatorship </p>
<p>since the 1980s. He has amassed poisons and viruses both to suppress his own </p>
<p>people, and to threaten his neighbours. He has relentlessly pursued his ultimate </p>
<p>ambition, the acquisition of a nuclear weapons capability, in flagrant disregard </p>
<p>of SCRs and Iraq’s obligations as a non&#8209;nuclear weapons state under the  </p>
<p>Non&#8209;Proliferation Treaty. His pursuit of these weapons has lain at the heart </p>
<p>of the UN’s stand&#8209;off with Iraq for the past 12 years.”</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Examining “six of the most commonly expressed arguments about the </p>
<p>UK Government’s approach”, Mr Straw argued that:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The Iraqi threat to Europe and the US was not “overstated”.</b> Resolution </p>
<p>1441 recognised the “singular menace” from Iraq’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction. UNSCOM had had some successes, including overseeing the </p>
<p>destruction of “significant quantities” of weaponry, but when the inspectors left </p>
<p>in 1998, it was “clear that the regime continued to hold vast stocks of deadly </p>
<p>weaponry”. The absence of inspectors since 1998 had “allowed Saddam to </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>accelerate his weapons programmes”. The report published in autumn 2002 (the </p>
<p>September dossier) had “demonstrated determined efforts” to enhance Iraq’s </p>
<p>nuclear, biological and chemical capabilities. Dr Blix’s report to the Security </p>
<p>Council in January had “underlined these concerns”. Diplomacy, intelligence </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, reinforced export controls, and interdiction and disruption of </p>
<p>supplies were options being used to “frustrate the ambitions” of other regimes. </p>
<p>But “in respect of Iraq”, those options had been “exhausted … over 12 long </p>
<p>years”. It was the “deadly combination of capability and intent” which made </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “uniquely dangerous”. Rogue regimes which showed “total </p>
<p>disregard for the rule of law, and share the terrorists’ hatred of our values” were </p>
<p>the “most likely source of materials and know&#8209;how”. Given Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>“longstanding support for terrorist causes”, the “terrifying possibility that his </p>
<p>poisons and diseases” would “find their way into the hands of Al Qaida and </p>
<p>its sympathisers” could not be ruled out.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Backing diplomatic efforts with the credible threat of force did not </b></p>
<p><b>undermine international law. </b>Law required enforcement and Iraq’s failure </p>
<p>to comply with “23 out of 27 separate obligations under Chapter VII of the </p>
<p>UN Charter” had “done great harm to the UN’s credibility”. Failure “to back </p>
<p>our words with deeds” would “follow one of the most catastrophic precedents </p>
<p>in history”: the failure of the League of Nations to face up to the challenges of </p>
<p>the 1930s. If the weapons inspectors confirmed “the behaviour which has put </p>
<p>Iraq in continuing material breach, then the case for a second resolution will </p>
<p>be overwhelming”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Disarmament by force could be needed even if containment was working. </b></p>
<p>The key was Iraq’s immediate compliance with resolution 1441 and its active </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation to ensure its disarmament. The “proposals” for a No&#8209;Fly Zone </p>
<p>covering the whole of Iraq and for thousands of UN troops to assist and protect </p>
<p>the inspectors were “simply not feasible in the absence of complete Iraqi  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation” and “not necessary” if there was “co&#8209;operation”. If the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors were “unable to provide” a guarantee that Iraq was complying with </p>
<p>its obligations, Iraq would “have to face the ‘serious consequences’” defined </p>
<p>in resolution 1441; disarmament by force. The UK did not want war and hoped </p>
<p>that “Saddam Hussein would recognise the gravity of the situation and embark </p>
<p>on the pathway to peaceful disarmament”, but “the time had arrived to back our </p>
<p>demands with the credible threat of force”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Military action would not have a disproportionate effect on the Iraqi people </b></p>
<p><b>or the wider region.</b> The UK had to “strain every sinew, even at this late stage, </p>
<p>to avoid war; to force Saddam to face the fact that he has to comply; to offer, </p>
<p>as we have already, an escape route to exile for him and his entourage”. But </p>
<p>if military action did “prove necessary”, “huge efforts” would “be made to ensure </p>
<p>that the suffering of the Iraqi people” was “as limited as is possible”. The Iraqi </p>
<p>people deserved “the chance to live fulfilling lives free from the oppression </p>
<p>and terror of Saddam”; and to “choose their own destiny and government, and </p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>

<p>to pursue a prosperous life within a safe environment”. The UK’s first objective </p>
<p>was disarmament, but the “next priority would be to work with the United Nations </p>
<p>to help the Iraqi people recover … and allow their country to move towards one </p>
<p>that is ruled by law, respects international obligations and provides effective </p>
<p>and representative government”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Control of Iraq’s oil was not the motivation for action.</b> The mission was </p>
<p>disarmament. Iraq’s oilfields would be protected from any acts of environmental </p>
<p>terrorism, and the revenue generated would be used to benefit the Iraqi people.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The UK was not guilty of double standards in relation to the conflict </b></p>
<p><b>between Israel and Palestine. </b>The UK was “working tirelessly” to achieve the </p>
<p>implementation of UN Security Council resolutions in respect of Israel/Palestine; </p>
<p>a conflict that had “long provided terrorists with a convenient rallying point”. As </p>
<p>long as that dispute was unresolved, collective security would “remain elusive”.</p>
<p><b>Discussions on the timing and content of a second resolution</b></p>
<p><b>254.  Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that the UK wanted to delay tabling </b></p>
<p><b>a resolution until after a special European Council which would take place </b></p>
<p><b>on 17 February.</b></p>
<p><b>255.  The US continued to resist UK proposals for a draft resolution containing </b></p>
<p><b>either an ultimatum to Saddam to leave or a timetable for a decision.</b></p>
<p><b>256. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke three times on 11 February.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> In the first conversation, they discussed US reservations about including </p>
<p>an ultimatum in the resolution and the timing of a draft.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Following a discussion with Mr Blair, Mr Straw telephoned Secretary Powell to set </p>
<p>out concerns that tabling a resolution before the European Council would be interpreted </p>
<p>as pre&#8209;empting the meeting.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> Mr Straw stated that the “critical thing” on both timing and </p>
<p>content would be “what tactically was most likely to ensure nine votes and no veto”. </p>
<p>He had asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock for a menu of options.</p>
<p><b>259. </b> Secretary Powell had asked whether Mr Blair really wanted an ultimatum </p>
<p>in the resolution; it might be better for it to be delivered personally by President Bush </p>
<p>or Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq evening meeting on 11 February reported that Mr Blair </p>
<p>and Mr Straw had agreed that the UK would run with the text of a draft resolution agreed </p>

<p>between the US and UK Missions to the UN in New York which did not include any </p>
<p>ultimatum or deadline.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>261. </b> In a third conversation, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell again discussed the timing </p>
<p>and the US reservations about including an ultimatum.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Mr Straw reported that he had argued in favour of inclusion, but it had </p>
<p>subsequently occurred to him that it might be possible to table a simple resolution and </p>
<p>discuss the merits of an ultimatum with partners. If that attracted a consensus, it could </p>
<p>be adopted. That could be less difficult than starting off with an ultimatum and then </p>
<p>dropping it from a resolution.</p>
<p><b>263.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US wanted to keep the option </b></p>
<p><b>of tabling the resolution immediately after the reports to the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>on 14 February to send the message that the US and UK were not going to </b></p>
<p><b>wait around.</b></p>
<p><b>264.  Sir Jeremy also stated that Security Council members would be very </b></p>
<p><b>reluctant to grant cover for military action within weeks and the draft resolution </b></p>
<p><b>might not secure nine positive votes.</b></p>
<p><b>265. </b> The FCO instructions to the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York (UKMIS </p>
<p>New York) on 11 February set out the questions the UK wanted Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei </p>
<p>to address: “to ensure that the 14 February update … is as uncomfortable as possible </p>
<p>for the Iraqis … and ensure the Iraqis cannot avoid the hard questions.”</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Following consultations with Ambassador Negroponte on 11 February, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock advised that Washington was coming to the conclusion that it might be </p>
<p>necessary to table the draft resolution on 14 February to keep a priority place for the </p>
<p>US/UK language, provide an alternative to the Franco&#8209;German proposals and create </p>
<p>an “implication that the US/UK were not going to wait around”.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Rice’s response to the UK “ultimatum ideas” had </p>
<p>been “reluctant”.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that, in a conversation between Mr John Howard, the </p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister, and Mr Annan, Dr Blix had said “there was no evidence of </p>
<p>a fundamental shift in the Iraqi approach, though he ‘detected the possibility of a shift </p>
<p>in the future’”. Mr Annan was reported to have:</p>

<p>he realised the limitations; more for the Security Council, as he saw that more than </p>
<p>a few days would be needed to find language that brought people together.”</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Commenting on the debate in London on ideas for the final stages of diplomatic </p>
<p>activity, Sir Jeremy advised that the Franco&#8209;German proposals for reinforced inspections </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>“… recognised by the Security Council middle ground as a delaying tactic and </p>
<p>unlikely to make a difference on complete disarmament … But Council members </p>
<p>remain very reluctant to grant cover for military action within weeks … The </p>
<p>Americans may be upbeat about the likely effect of their lobbying and cajoling.  </p>
<p>But I cannot say at this point that we would definitely get nine votes for a material </p>
<p>breach resolution on the basis of what seem to be the Blix/ElBaradei intentions </p>
<p>for the 14 February report.</p>
<p>“Injecting an ultimatum … might possibly help at the margins … though I would </p>
<p>hesitate to bank on it. If the ultimatum was directed at Saddam’s departure … </p>
<p>that would be a clearer criterion than offering up elements of WMD. But the </p>
<p>Americans are right that the Council majority are expressly opposed to the idea </p>
<p>of regime change …”</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Sir Jeremy suggested consideration of “a more radical halfway&#8209;house plan”:</p>
<p>“If the UK has to be sure of recapturing the initiative, we may have to think bolder. </p>
<p>We should test the Franco&#8209;German model to destruction. A Chapter VII resolution </p>
<p>authorising all necessary means for the specific purpose of hunting down hidden </p>
<p>WMD is worth considering. The objective has to be to place enough Coalition troops </p>
<p>on the ground, with No&#8209;Fly and No&#8209;Drive Zones declared by the Security Council </p>
<p>throughout Iraq, for mobile WMD transports etc to be tracked down, revealed and </p>
<p>destroyed. Baghdad and other major cities would be left to one side, at least for the </p>
<p>first stage. There could be arrangements for interviews offering greater protection </p>
<p>than the present.”</p>
<p><b>271. </b> Sir Jeremy thought that, when faced with the alternatives, Council members would </p>
<p>“rally to this approach”. But it might not “readily fit” the American “military preferences”. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy wrote:</p>
<p>“… the most important aspect … would be Saddam’s reaction. He would bitterly </p>
<p>oppose a UN&#8209;authorised take&#8209;over of parts of Iraq. If it were imposed on him, he </p>
<p>might quickly break the no&#8209;resistance conditions. In that case, the ‘last resort’ would </p>
<p>have been much more clearly established.”</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“This plan does not have to be used immediately. We could go through the stages </p>
<p>of presenting and arguing for the second resolution of the kind we have been </p>
<p>discussing, before coming to a final decision. But the prospects of a 15&#8209;0 SCR </p>

<p><b>273.  Sir David Manning told Dr Rice that there was a need to regain the political </b></p>
<p><b>and public relations initiative.</b></p>
<p><b>274.  Mr Blair was considering the approach to a second resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>275.  Mr Blair had also identified the need to make the case publicly that the </b></p>
<p><b>US and the UK were making ‘one last push for peace’.</b></p>
<p><b>276. </b> On 12 February, Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed the progress of </p>
<p>inspections, including the outcome of the visit by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to Baghdad.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David commented that the inspectors only needed intelligence because Iraq was </p>
<p>not co&#8209;operating.</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Sir David Manning also gave Dr Rice an account of the UK’s current thinking on a </p>
<p>second resolution, which he described as “very much work in progress”. He reported that </p>
<p>Mr Blair had “yet to take any decisions”; the UK and US now had to regain the political </p>
<p>and public relations initiative.</p>
<p><b>278. </b> Mr Blair would be making a major speech that weekend to “set out the arguments </p>
<p>again, but to do so in the context of one last pitch for peace”. Mr Blair “would probably </p>
<p>say that the time had come to accept that Saddam was in breach of 1441 and </p>
<p>that we should now table a second resolution insisting that he must go or face the </p>
<p>consequences”. Sir David said that the ultimatum need not be in the resolution itself, </p>
<p>but that “we must indicate our readiness to allow to Saddam to leave within a short, </p>
<p>specified period so offering the chance of avoiding war”.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Sir David also outlined Mr Blair’s plan to write to Mr Costas Simitis, the Greek </p>
<p>Prime Minister in advance of the European Council, and the need to generate </p>
<p>momentum to attract support.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> Commenting on the position after the call, Sir David wrote that the UK would need </p>
<p>to think further about the timing for tabling the draft resolution over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p><b>281.  The UK decided to continue to explore the possibility of including an </b></p>
<p><b>ultimatum in the resolution with the US.</b></p>
<p><b>282. </b> The FCO informed Sir Jeremy Greenstock on 12 February that Ministers were </p>
<p>“broadly content” with the draft resolution he had provided the previous day (following </p>
<p>discussions on 10 February) but had decided, before receipt of his later advice, that </p>

<p>231</p>
<p>the UK should continue to explore with the US the possibility of adding an ultimatum, </p>
<p>aimed particularly at getting Saddam to step down, to the draft resolution.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Two possible options for an ultimatum in a draft resolution were set out:</p>
<p>“Decides that unless the Council concludes before x March 2003 that a government </p>
<p>has emerged in Iraq which [intends to] [has demonstrated its intention to] [has </p>
<p>taken an unconditional and irreversible decision to] come into compliance with its </p>
<p>obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and previous relevant resolutions, Iraq </p>
<p>will face the serious consequences it has been repeatedly warned of, including in </p>
<p>para 13 of resolution 1441 (2002).”</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>“Decides that unless the Council concludes before x March 2003 that the </p>
<p>government of Iraq has taken an unconditional and irreversible decision to come into </p>
<p>compliance with its obligations under resolution 1441 (2002) and previous relevant </p>
<p>resolutions, Iraq will face the serious consequences it has repeatedly been warned </p>
<p>of, including in para 13 of resolution 1441 (2002).”</p>
<p><b>284. </b> The telegram also set out the option, identified by Mr Straw following his third </p>
<p>conversation with Secretary Powell on 11 February, of taking soundings before tabling </p>
<p>an ultimatum.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> In relation to Sir Jeremy’s own suggestions, the FCO took the view that there </p>
<p>would be “serious obstacles”. It did not think that authorising all necessary means </p>
<p>to hunt down WMD would meet the disarmament objectives, particularly if Baghdad </p>
<p>and other cities were left aside. The key was:</p>
<p>“… co&#8209;operation rather than resources. For example work on BW can be very </p>
<p>easily concealed under legitimate guises … Without full access to documents and </p>
<p>full co&#8209;operation from personnel, it would be impossible to guarantee success.”</p>
<p><b>286. </b> The FCO also identified difficulties with providing scientists “adequate protection </p>
<p>while they remain under Saddam’s regime”, and practical problems with assembling </p>
<p>and protecting a UN force.</p>
<p><b>287. </b> The record of the FCO Iraq evening meeting on 12 February reported concerns </p>
<p>that some members of the US Administration were “increasingly inclined” to table the </p>
<p>resolution straight after Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 14 February.</p>
<p>80</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>289.  Sir Jeremy recommended that in the Security Council meeting on </b></p>
<p><b>14 February, the UK should seek to draw out the truth about non-co-operation.</b></p>
<p><b>290. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that he had told Dr Blix on 12 February that an </p>
<p>ultimatum remained an option and that they had discussed how to create a concrete </p>
<p>ultimatum which required Iraqi co&#8209;operation on substance.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Sir Jeremy had set out the UK position that:</p>
<p>“… pushing for reinforced inspections was a mistake. The Security Council needed </p>
<p>to realise that Saddam was in denial of 1441 and there had to be a firm decision that </p>
<p>he either gave up his WMD or left Iraq, or faced military action.”</p>
<p><b>292. </b> In response to Dr Blix’s questions about the issue coming to a head after only two </p>
<p>and a half months and the timing of military action, Sir Jeremy had replied that, “more </p>
<p>than the climate”, the “US was worried about losing backing and momentum and saw </p>
<p>only one way to deal with Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation. That was why we were running out of </p>
<p>time”. He had “added” that he had “always felt that the best way to keep the UN together </p>
<p>was through a WMD find which demonstrated the Iraqi lie”. In Sir Jeremy’s view, “by </p>
<p>distracting from the main issue of Iraqi co&#8209;operation and giving the Iraqis false hope, </p>
<p>the French ideas could make war more likely”.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had also raised the possibility of using UNMOVIC </p>
<p>expertise in a post&#8209;war scenario.</p>
<p><b>294. </b> Commenting on the conversation, Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix “genuinely </p>
<p>believes that inspections still have something to contribute, but could not claim that </p>
<p>he had acquired anything of substance out of the recent period”. Dr Blix was:</p>
<p>“… torn between time for more peaceful disarmament through inspections and </p>
<p>helping to pile on the pressure to make the Iraqis crack. He would have been </p>
<p>more inclined to follow the latter course if he felt less certain that the Americans </p>
<p>were hell&#8209;bent on war anyway.”</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Sir Jeremy suggested that Mr Straw should use his intervention in the Council </p>
<p>meeting on 14 February to pose questions for Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei “that draw out </p>
<p>the non&#8209;co&#8209;operation truths”.</p>
<p>PRIME MINISTER’S QUESTIONS, 12 FEBRUARY 2003</p>

<p>time needed to make a judgement about whether that was happening:</p>
<p>“… the judgement that has to be made in the end is one by the Security Council </p>
<p>as to whether there is full and complete co&#8209;operation by Iraq with the United </p>
<p>Nations inspectors.”</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Blair warned that there was a:</p>
<p>“… danger that we get sucked back into delays of months then years, with the </p>
<p>inspectors playing a game of hide and seek with Saddam and we are unable then </p>
<p>to shut down the weapons of mass destruction programme … that everyone accepts </p>
<p>is a threat and a danger to the world.”</p>
<p><b>301. </b> Asked whether military action would make peace in the Middle East more likely </p>
<p>and Britain less of a target for terrorists, Mr Blair replied that if Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>“complied fully” with resolution 1441, conflict would not be an issue. The choice was </p>
<p>Saddam’s, but:</p>
<p>“… if we fail to implement resolution 1441, and if we lack the determination and </p>
<p>resolution to make sure that that mandate is carried, the consequence will be that </p>
<p>Saddam is free to develop weapons of mass destruction. Also there will be an </p>
<p>increasing risk that the threat of those weapons of mass destruction and the existing </p>
<p>terrorist threat will join together. This country will then be less secure and safe.”</p>
<p><b>302. </b> Asked why people were not persuaded of the threat, Mr Blair replied that it would </p>
<p>“be different if there is a second resolution”. People believed that Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>“evil” and that there was “a threat to this country from his accumulated weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”, but they asked if there was an alternative to war. That alternative was “full </p>
<p>and complete co&#8209;operation”.</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Asked what new, proven or imminent threat there was to justify war, Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that had been identified in resolution 1441 and the preceding 12 years and that there </p>
<p>were two ways to deal with it, disarmament or sanctions. If there was a decision to go </p>
<p>to war, the morality of that “should weigh heavily on our conscience because innocent </p>
<p>people die as well as the guilty in a war”. But the way in which Saddam Hussein had </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>implemented the policy of sanctions meant that too was “a moral choice with bad and </p>
<p>devastating consequences for the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Asked about the origins and accuracy of the dossier produced by No.10, (‘Iraq –  </p>
<p>Its Infrastructure of Concealment, Deception and Intimidation’ – see Section 4.3), </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that the part of the document that dealt with intelligence was from </p>
<p>intelligence sources and was accurate, as was the document as a whole.</p>
<p><b>305. </b> In his memoir, Mr Cook wrote:</p>
<p>“What was novel … was the way in which Tony has shifted the terms in which </p>
<p>he justifies military intervention. For the first time he argued that war would be </p>
<p>preferable to sanctions because of the suffering and malnutrition that comes </p>
<p>in the wake of sanctions.”</p>

<p><b>UK views on UNMOVIC inspections</b></p>
<p><b>306. </b> At Sir Richard Dearlove’s request, his Private Secretary sent an update </p>
<p>on the progress of inspections to Sir David Manning on 12 February.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Sir David was told that the strike rate in relation to the UK intelligence&#8209;led </p>
<p>inspections was low, but it had been responsible for two out of three UNMOVIC finds </p>
<p>to date, from more than 550 inspections. In addition, “even where there is no WMD, </p>
<p>something else has often been concealed […] Our inspections have revealed the </p>
<p>Iraqi game.”</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Sir Richard’s update also stated that “we needed to keep going in the expectation </p>
<p>that an intelligence&#8209;led inspection would lead to a find or a solid refusal of entry”.</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Sir David sent the letter to Mr Powell with the comment: “More inspections ahead – </p>
<p>but time getting very short.”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>310. </b> The UK used about 30 separate pieces of intelligence from human sources and </p>
<p>satellite imagery covering 19 sites to provide leads for the UN inspectors. UNMOVIC </p>
<p>visited seven of those sites, made a partial examination of one more and subjected one </p>
<p>further site to an inspection by ground&#8209;penetrating radar.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>311. </b> In a ‘Note’ produced on 12 February, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) Counter </p>
<p>Proliferation Support Group reported that UNMOVIC and the IAEA had conducted over </p>
<p>550 site visits or inspections.</p>

<p>235</p>
<p><b>312. </b> UNMOVIC had moved more quickly to establish the inspection process than </p>
<p>originally envisaged. It had begun work on 27 November 2002, almost a month earlier </p>
<p>than the deadline of 23 December in resolution 1441. It had also been able to establish </p>
<p>the Baghdad Ongoing Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Centre (BOMVIC) and </p>
<p>a temporary centre at Mosul more quickly than the 60 days it thought would be needed </p>
<p>before entering Iraq.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Most of the site visits conducted during the first six weeks were “intended [to] </p>
<p>familiarise inspectors with the sites, and inspection techniques”. In addition, inspectors </p>
<p>checked the equipment which had been tagged by UNSCOM, examined remote </p>
<p>cameras and asked about work carried out at sites since 1998. Some visits had been </p>
<p>superficial. From early January, “the inspections had become longer and more intrusive”.</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Initially UNMOVIC had been hampered by a lack of support equipment, personnel </p>
<p>and experience. It had taken UNMOVIC until mid&#8209;December to get to near full strength </p>
<p>with 100 inspectors. The inspectors were on short contracts with “a consequent loss of </p>
<p>expertise” and “few” had experience of operating in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> UNMOVIC had acknowledged the problems. By the beginning of February, it </p>
<p>had “visited or inspected all but one of the UK’s recommended sites”, and continued </p>
<p>to be receptive to UK advice on potential targets. “Fatigue” was, however, “becoming </p>
<p>a significant factor” which had been “reflected in an increasing number of accidents” </p>
<p>during inspections. Fatigue was the result of:</p>
<p>“… a combination of the pace of the inspection programme; Iraqi pressure; the </p>
<p>perceived need for a ‘success’; and concern for personal safety in the event of war.”</p>
<p><b>316. </b> During January and early February, “a total of 22 biological associated scientists </p>
<p>and missile experts refused to meet inspectors in private”. The three scientists who had </p>
<p>agreed to interviews were “selected by the Iraqi National Monitoring Directorate”. Even </p>
<p>if Baghdad did concede interviews, all the scientists would be “concerned that anything </p>
<p>they say will become known to the Iraqi authorities”.</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Finds had included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“nuclear&#8209;related documents hidden at the home of […] an Iraqi scientist” on </p>
<p>16 January, although “the general perception has been that these do not </p>
<p>constitute a ‘smoking gun’”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“CW associated rocket warheads at Ukhaider ammunition depot” the same </p>
<p>day. The liquid in one warhead was “awaiting the delivery of chemical sampling </p>
<p>equipment”. That had arrived but was “not yet operational”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “small quantity of … CW precursor chemicals at a Laboratory”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“aluminium nozzles for 80mm rockets that Iraq had recast, but not declared” </p>
<p>were discovered by the IAEA on 31 January; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“parts” from a “suspected … biological or chemical sub&#8209;munition” were found </p>
<p>“at the al&#8209;Numan factory”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>318. </b> The Iraqis realised that some inspections had “been mounted on the basis of </p>
<p>intelligence,” and had “increased even further” the measures being taken to prevent </p>
<p>damaging material being uncovered by either UNMOVIC or the IAEA. That included </p>
<p>“ensuring that WMD material only remains at a particular location for an absolute </p>
<p>maximum of 24 hours, and contingency plans to ensure that ‘crowds’ will always </p>
<p>be available to disrupt an inspection that might prove successful”.</p>
<p><b>319. </b> The DIS report concluded that:</p>
<p>“While UNMOVIC is gaining in confidence, the inspectors are under increasing </p>
<p>pressure at a time when consideration is having to be given to a possible </p>
<p>evacuation. Internally, despite the full inspection programme having been under </p>
<p>way for only some five weeks, there is already a sense that time is running out.</p>
<p>“UNMOVIC and the IAEA are capable of conducting thorough inspections; </p>
<p>however, mistakes have resulted in at least two inspections failing to uncover </p>
<p>concealed material …</p>
<p>“UNMOVIC and IAEA remain very receptive to UK intelligence. On balance, </p>
<p>however, in the absence of Iraqi cooperation, we assess that the discovery </p>
<p>of a ‘smoking gun’ will probably be the result of intelligence information, skill </p>
<p>on the part of the inspectors, an Iraqi mistake, and an element of luck.”</p>
<p><b>320.  Mr Blair told Mr John Howard that the inspectors’ reports of 28 February </b></p>
<p><b>should be the final reports to the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>321. </b> A <i>BBC</i> poll published on 13 February found that 60 percent of people questioned </p>
<p>thought that the UK and US Governments had failed to prove their case that Iraq had </p>
<p>WMD, and 45 percent said that the UK should play no part in a war on Iraq, whatever </p>
<p>the UN decided. Fewer than 10 percent said that they would back a war with Iraq without </p>
<p>a second resolution.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Howard discussed Dr Blix’s forthcoming report and the prospects </p>
<p>for a second resolution in a breakfast meeting on 13 February.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Sir David Manning advised that there would be a need to challenge </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s likely assessment that there had been some movement on process </p>
<p>and some movement on interviews; and to focus in public “on the underlying </p>
<p>message that there was no fundamental change in attitude, and the key questions </p>
<p>remained unanswered”. International opinion should not be allowed “to be distracted </p>
<p>by nuances about process”.</p>

<p>237</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Other points which Mr Blair and Mr Howard discussed included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix was writing his report on the presumption that there would be more time </p>
<p>and it was implicit in his approach that there would be more time.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concern that the report would be critical of Secretary Powell’s presentation </p>
<p>to the UN on 5 February.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia and China were likely to abstain in a vote on a second resolution and </p>
<p>France and Germany might put forward a rival text.</p>
<p><b>325. </b> Mr Blair told Mr Howard that:</p>
<p>“… people in the UK were suspicious that the US were eager to use force and did </p>
<p>not want the inspections to work. They could accept the need for war, but not for war </p>
<p><i>now</i>. If Blix came up with a firm report that could change. The report on the 28th [of </p>
<p>February] should be the final report. The US needed in parallel to ensure the support </p>
<p>of the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>326. </b> In response to Mr Howard’s assessment that a second resolution was not needed </p>
<p>for legal reasons, Mr Powell said that UK lawyers were studying the issue. Mr Blair said </p>
<p>it was needed for political reasons.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> In the subsequent press conference, Mr Blair stated that the discussion had been </p>
<p>“dominated” by Iraq.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> He and Prime Minister Howard had agreed that Iraq needed to </p>
<p>disarm and resolution 1441 had to be upheld.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Prime Minister Howard praised Mr Blair’s “strong and principled stance” and his </p>
<p>“strong and effective leadership” and stated that he believed:</p>
<p>“… very strongly that if the whole world speaking through the United Nations </p>
<p>Security Council said with one clear voice to Iraq that it had to disarm then that </p>
<p>would more than anything else be likely to bring forth the faint hope of a peaceful </p>
<p>solution.”</p>
<p><b>329. </b> In reply to a question, Mr Howard stated that the problem was not time, it was </p>
<p>Iraq’s attitude.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Mr Blair was asked whether Iraq’s ballistic missiles were enough to justify military </p>
<p>action; and whether the news overnight of a North Korean threat that its missiles could </p>
<p>hit US targets anywhere in the world “presented a more urgent and larger threat to </p>
<p>international stability”. He replied that the judgement on Iraq had to be “made in the </p>
<p>round” in the context of resolution 1441. In relation to the need to confront the threat </p>
<p>from North Korea, albeit “by different means”, Mr Blair emphasised that the United </p>
<p>Nations would be “tremendously weakened and undermined” if it showed “weakness </p>
<p>and uncertainty over Iraq”. That was “the key issue”.</p>

<p>91</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Mr Blair convened a meeting on humanitarian issues with Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>Ms Short, Adm Boyce and No.10 officials in the margins of Cabinet on 13 February.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That meeting is addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>333.  In Cabinet on 13 February, Mr Straw stated that Iraq was not co-operating </b></p>
<p><b>on substance and its Al Samoud missiles and engines could be further evidence </b></p>
<p><b>of a material breach of resolution 1441. The authority of the UN was at stake.</b></p>
<p><b>334.  Mr Hoon stated that the second resolution needed to provide straightforward </b></p>
<p><b>legal justification for taking military action.</b></p>
<p><b>335.  Mr Blair concluded that there was no point in conceding more time for </b></p>
<p><b>inspections if the lack of co-operation did not permit the inspectors to do their </b></p>
<p><b>job. The “best course was to keep our nerve and persevere”.</b></p>
<p><b>336. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet on 13 February that the UN inspectors were likely to tell </p>
<p>the Security Council on 14 February that:</p>
<p>“… the Iraqis were co&#8209;operating a bit more on the process but not on the substance. </p>
<p>One issue of significance could be the inspectors’ attitude to the Al Samoud missiles </p>
<p>and the 223 new Volga engines, which they could decide were in breach of Iraq’s </p>
<p>obligations. That would be further evidence of material breach.”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>He would report to the House of Commons later that day that Iraq had been, and </p>
<p>continued to be in material breach; and that further confirmation of the facts by the </p>
<p>inspectors “would lead logically to a Security Council resolution”.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Mr Straw also reported difficulties in NATO over a request from Turkey for support. </p>
<p>That was “a serious situation which was pulling NATO apart”. The Presidency of the EU </p>
<p>had called a summit [meeting of the European Council] for 17 February.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Mr Straw told his colleagues that:</p>
<p>“… the authority of the United Nations was at stake. There was a parallel with the </p>
<p>failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s to enforce international law … The best </p>
<p>chance of avoiding military action was to hold our nerve in keeping to the United </p>
<p>Nations process.”</p>

<p>239</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Reporting on his visit to the US, Mr Hoon told Cabinet that the US Administration </p>
<p>“had a good appreciation” of the Government’s political situation. In his view, it would </p>
<p>be “important politically” that any further resolution “should be simple” and “provide </p>
<p>straightforward legal justification for taking military action”; “obscurity or justification </p>
<p>relying on bureaucratic references back to earlier resolutions” should be avoided.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> The points made in discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the authority of the UN “could be undermined both by a failure to act and </p>
<p>by action taken without its sanction”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the tone of public communications “should not give the impression of a rush </p>
<p>to war: there was a benefit in a distinctively British approach”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>while public opinion “did not seem persuaded of the necessity of war, </p>
<p>it appeared to support military action when combined with a further </p>
<p>Security Council resolution”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>emphasis had to be given to the future welfare of the Iraqi people as well </p>
<p>as the re&#8209;invigoration of the MEPP;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work “had started” in the US to “put in place structures for the recovery </p>
<p>and reconstruction of Iraq in the event of military conflict”.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that the Government “should maintain </p>
<p>the integrity” of the UN process. That “did not mean allowing Iraq to prolong inspections </p>
<p>indefinitely”. Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… been given a final chance to comply and full co&#8209;operation was required, </p>
<p>otherwise the issue returned to the Security Council for discussion. There was no </p>
<p>point in conceding more time for inspections if the lack of co&#8209;operation did not permit </p>
<p>the inspectors to do their job.”</p>
<p><b>342. </b> Mr Blair expected public opinion “to shift before we got to the point of military </p>
<p>action. Some polling showed that there would be support both in the event of a further </p>
<p>Security Council resolution and if the majority of the Security Council supported action </p>
<p>despite a veto”. Strenuous efforts were being made to avoid the alienation of France and </p>
<p>Germany. The UK would stand up for itself and had support in Europe. The international </p>
<p>community need to be engaged in dealing with the humanitarian consequences of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s rule in Iraq. The “best course was to keep our nerve and persevere”.</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Cook had “really played up the extent of the opposition” </p>
<p>on Iraq, and that he might be “putting down a marker” about his departure: “He was </p>
<p>clearly very offside and had become more so.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>344. </b> In his memoir, Mr Cook wrote that he had offered three suggestions for how </p>
<p>“we should conduct ourselves if we are going to reconnect with the public”:</p>
<p>“We could stop appearing to force the pace on the war. The public will only follow </p>
<p>us if they believe we are reluctant about conflict …</p>
<p>“We need to find a distinctive British tone in which we address the Iraq crisis. </p>
<p>We should stop appearing as the US and UK axis.</p>
<p>“We should stick to the UN like glue. If tomorrow Hans Blix asks for more time </p>
<p>for inspectors, he must get it. If we depart from the UN process we shall be </p>
<p>committing suicide …”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that there was also a meeting with Mr Straw on tactics for the </p>
<p>second resolution and whether it should be tabled before the European Council.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>346. </b> Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed the next steps and tactics and timings </p>
<p>on 13 February, including concerns about a possible Franco&#8209;German initiative.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>347. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that the UK preference was to wait to table a second </p>
<p>resolution until after the special EU Council on Iraq, unless circumstances dictated </p>
<p>an earlier date.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> In the meeting of the Security Council the following day, the UK aim was to move </p>
<p>the discussion away from process and focus it on substance: “The best bet seemed to </p>
<p>be to put a series of very tough questions to Blix about Iraqi performance and insist on </p>
<p>very clear answers.” The UK did not want “Saturday’s headlines being about calls in the </p>
<p>Security Council to give the inspectors more time”.</p>
<p><b>349. </b> In his record of the discussion, Sir David commented: “We should also have a draft </p>
<p>resolution in our back pockets, ready to put down at a moment’s notice.”</p>
<p><b>350. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Washington, </p>

<p><b>that Iraq was in further material breach of resolution 1441 was “inescapable”.</b></p>

<p>observation that Iraq appeared “not to have come to a genuine acceptance” of the </p>
<p>demand for disarmament. Mr Straw added that the central premise of Iraq’s “so&#8209;called </p>
<p>disclosure”, that Iraq possessed no WMD “was, and remains, a lie”. “Nor was there any </p>
<p>admission of Iraq’s extensive efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction since … </p>
<p>December 1998” when the inspectors were “effectively excluded from Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Mr Straw stated that the briefings on 27 January and Secretary Powell’s </p>
<p>presentation to the Security Council on 5 February left “no doubt that Iraq had </p>
<p>failed to meet” the “two clear tests for further material breach” set out in resolution </p>
<p>1441. Mr Straw added : “The conclusion is therefore inescapable: Iraq is in further </p>
<p>material breach …”</p>
<p><b>356. </b> The points made by Mr Straw included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He still hoped and prayed “for a peaceful outcome to the crisis”, but that would </p>
<p>only be possible if “unrelenting pressure” was maintained on Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>“including the threat of force, rather than casting around for excuses to delay”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the international community “lost its nerve”, that would “significantly undermine </p>
<p>the UN’s authority and make the world a much more dangerous place, as </p>
<p>dictators got the message that international law consisted of mere words and </p>
<p>nothing else”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>French and German calls to “bolster the inspections regime” would not </p>
<p>“deliver the assurance the world needs” and were “unrealistic and impractical”. </p>
<p>They shifted “the burden of proof from Iraq … to the inspectors”; and sent </p>
<p>“Saddam the signal that defiance pays”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Armed intervention was not inevitable and a peaceful resolution of the crisis </p>
<p>remained in Saddam’s hands. But the inspectors would “not be able to fulfil their </p>
<p>mandate to verify Iraqi disarmament” without Iraq’s compliance. In that event, </p>
<p>resolution 1441 warned Iraq to expect “serious consequences”: “By now, even </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein must be under no illusions: that can only mean disarmament </p>
<p>by force.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>242</p>
<p><b>357. </b> The points made by Mr Alan Duncan (Conservative) included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Diplomatic relations between the US and France and Germany were “to put it </p>
<p>mildly, scratchy”, but relations between Western democracies should not “slide </p>
<p>into disarray”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Conservative Party shared the judgement, enshrined in resolution 1441, </p>
<p>that the cost of doing nothing was greater than the cost of doing something”. </p>
<p>The UK should not resile from implementing resolution 1441.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Given “the doubting mood of public opinion”, the Government should focus </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein’s arsenal of weapons, not other issues such as links with </p>
<p>terrorism and the publication of an “utterly substandard dossier” which diverted </p>
<p>attention from the main issue and dented the Government’s credibility.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was a second resolution, which a “fortnight ago” had “seemed a dead cert”, </p>
<p>now touch and go?</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Mr Mark Oaten (Liberal Democrat):</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Expressed concerns about the impact on the unity of the international </p>
<p>community of ignoring a veto by one of the Permanent Members of the </p>
<p>Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asked why Mr Straw was dismissing the options of further UN inspection and </p>
<p>containment. If the inspectors believed that “with more time, co&#8209;operation and </p>
<p>space, progress could be made, they should be given more time”.</p>
<p><b>359. </b> In response to those points, and subsequent questions, which included both </p>
<p>support for action and concerns, points made by Mr Straw included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be the Government’s decision whether or not to move a resolution. </p>
<p>It would make decisions after the inspectors’ reports to the Security Council the </p>
<p>following day; decisions would be reported to the House of Commons as quickly </p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government was asking all the members of the Security Council, when </p>
<p>they assessed the inspectors’ reports, “to follow through the true meaning of </p>
<p>the language to which every single member … signed up”. The UK and other </p>
<p>members of the Security Council could not be in a position where they believed </p>
<p>the “conclusions following from the true meaning of 1441” were “inescapable, </p>
<p>but one member, for example”, sought “to avoid those conclusions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 was “a sufficient mandate” for military action because it spelled </p>
<p>out “with complete clarity” that there were “obligations on Iraq that it must follow </p>
<p>through”, which were “very straightforward”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>243</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had been suggested during the negotiation that a requirement for a second </p>
<p>resolution “if military force was to take place” should be written into resolution </p>
<p>1441. That had been “dropped from the final draft”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should “seek to lower, not raise the temperature of relations” with </p>
<p>friendly nations. It did not want to be, and would not be, involved in </p>
<p>recriminations between friendly members of UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the inspectors asked for more resources, that would be considered, but the UK </p>
<p>could not “be drawn into the argument from outside the inspectors’ ranks, which </p>
<p>seeks to imply that, in the absence of co&#8209;operation, more inspectors will resolve </p>
<p>the matter. They will not. Procrastination is not the solution to the problem; </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation is.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The evidence in respect of Iraq’s possession of “chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons and weapons programmes, and its readiness to develop a nuclear </p>
<p>programme” was “overwhelming”. Iraq had been “found guilty” in 1991 and had </p>
<p>to “prove its innocence”. The “absence of evidence in a huge country where </p>
<p>there are only 100 inspectors” did “not prove the absence of a programme </p>
<p>… other circumstantial evidence” had to be examined. Iraq had had a highly </p>
<p>developed nuclear programme in 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No one was “exaggerating the problem” and “no one had invented the fact that </p>
<p>Iraq had the programme [of weapons of mass destruction]”. Until Iraq proved </p>
<p>otherwise, the evidence suggested that Iraq continued to have “the programme”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no evidence of links between Al Qaida and Iraq in respect of the </p>
<p>attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, although he “would not be surprised </p>
<p>if such evidence came forward”. There was “some evidence of links between the </p>
<p>Al Qaida organisation and Iraq, in terms of the Iraq regime allowing a permissive </p>
<p>environment for Al Qaida operatives”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “very active co&#8209;operation between the intelligence agencies </p>
<p>in the United States and the United Kingdom, and the weapons inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He “shared the anxieties” about military action which “should only ever be a last </p>
<p>resort”, but “on occasions” it was “essential to enforce law by force, otherwise </p>
<p>the world becomes extremely dangerous”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It “would have been better, in a way” to include the words “disarmament by </p>
<p>force” in the resolution, “but in diplomatic speak the choice was between ‘all </p>
<p>necessary means’ and ‘serious consequences’. Everybody in the diplomatic </p>
<p>community knows that ‘serious consequences’ means the use of force”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>Security Council, 14 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>360. </b> The third Ministerial&#8209;level meeting of the Security Council to discuss Iraq took </p>
<p>place on 14 February.</p>
<p><b>Dr Blix’s report, 14 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>361.  Dr Blix reported that UNMOVIC had not found any weapons of mass </b></p>
<p><b>destruction and the items that were not accounted for might not exist, but Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>needed to provide the evidence to answer the questions, not belittle them.</b></p>
<p><b>362.  Dr Blix pointed out that the evidence that Iraq had prepared for inspections </b></p>
<p><b>by cleaning up sites and removing evidence, presented to the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>by Secretary Powell on 5 February, could have a different interpretation.</b></p>
<p><b>363. </b> Dr Blix told the Security Council that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The total number of UNMOVIC staff in Iraq had increased to more than 250. </p>
<p>The regional office in Mosul was “fully operational” and plans for a regional </p>
<p>office in Basra were “being developed”. UNMOVIC had conducted more than </p>
<p>400 inspections covering more than 300 sites.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“All inspections were performed without notice, and access was almost always </p>
<p>provided promptly. In no case have we seen convincing evidence that the Iraqi </p>
<p>side knew in advance that the inspectors were coming.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Inspections were “effectively helping to bridge the gap in knowledge” that had </p>
<p>arisen because of the absence of inspectors between December 1998 and </p>
<p>November 2002.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had informed the Iraqi authorities that it planned to start U&#8209;2 </p>
<p>surveillance flights early the following week and was still expanding its </p>
<p>capabilities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence information provided to UNMOVIC had been “gradually increasing”. </p>
<p>But there were “limitations” and “misinterpretations” could occur.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Three persons who had previously refused interviews on UNMOVIC’s terms </p>
<p>had given “informative” interviews just before the visit to Baghdad by Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Dr ElBaradei. Dr Blix hoped that Iraq’s commitment to encourage persons </p>
<p>to accept interviews would mean further interviews would be accepted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had begun the process of destroying approximately 50 litres </p>
<p>of mustard gas declared by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More than 200 chemical and more than 100 biological samples had been </p>
<p>collected. Three&#8209;quarters of the samples had already been tested and the </p>
<p>results were consistent with Iraq’s declarations.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Addressing how much, “if any” was left of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC had not found any so far, “only a small number of empty </p>
<p>chemical munitions, which should have been declared and destroyed”. UNMOVIC had </p>
<p>destroyed the “laboratory quantity” of a “mustard gas precursor” that had been found. </p>
<p>Many proscribed weapons and items had not been accounted for, but:</p>
<p>“One must not jump to the conclusion that they exist. However that possibility </p>
<p>is also not excluded. If they exist they must be presented for destruction. If they </p>
<p>do not exist, credible evidence to that effect should be presented.”</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Referring to his warning on 27 January that Iraq should not brush aside questions </p>
<p>on significant outstanding issues of substance, including on anthrax, the nerve agent </p>
<p>VX and long range missiles, Dr Blix stated that the fact that Iraq had, in its declaration </p>
<p>of 7 December 2002, “missed the opportunity to provide the fresh material and evidence </p>
<p>needed to respond to the open questions” was “perhaps the most important problem </p>
<p>we are facing”. He added:</p>
<p>“Although I can understand that it may not be easy for Iraq in all cases to provide </p>
<p>the evidence needed, it is not the task of the inspectors to find it. Iraq itself must </p>
<p>squarely tackle this task and avoid belittling the questions.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Some papers had been provided in Baghdad on 9 February. Dr Blix stated that </p>
<p>“could be indicative of a more active attitude” but there were problems verifying the </p>
<p>quantities of anthrax and two precursors for VX which Iraq had unilaterally destroyed: </p>
<p>“Documentary evidence and testimony by staff who dealt with the items still appears to </p>
<p>be needed.” Iraq’s initiative to identify 83 participants “in the unilateral destruction in the </p>
<p>chemical field” appeared “useful and pertain[ed] to co&#8209;operation on substance”. Dr Blix </p>
<p>trusted that Iraq would put together a “similar list of names of persons who participated </p>
<p>in the unilateral destruction of other proscribed items”.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Dr Blix also welcomed the extension of the mandate of an Iraqi commission to </p>
<p>look for any proscribed items and the appointment of a second commission to search </p>
<p>for documents relevant to the elimination of proscribed items and programmes. But they </p>
<p>would “evidently need to work fast and effectively to convince us, and the world, that it is </p>
<p>a serious effort”.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Experts had “concluded unanimously” that the two variants of the Al Samoud 2 </p>
<p>missile declared by Iraq were capable of exceeding the range of 150km. Those, and </p>
<p>any of the 380 SA&#8209;2 (Volga) engines which had been imported in contravention of </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991) and converted for use in the Al Samoud missile system, were </p>
<p>proscribed. The casting chambers for missile motors were also proscribed. Clarifications </p>
<p>were needed before decisions could be made on the capabilities of the Al Fatah missile </p>
<p>and the al&#8209;Rafah engine test stand.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>369. </b> In response to urgings that Iraq should implement the requirement in resolution </p>
<p>687 to enact legislation implementing the UN prohibitions on WMD, Iraq had told </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA earlier that day that it had issued a Presidential Decree. </p>
<p>The text was being studied.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Addressing the role of intelligence, Dr Blix stated that in the closed society of </p>
<p>Iraq, and the history of inspections, “other sources of information, such as defectors </p>
<p>and government intelligence agencies” were “required to aid the inspection process”. </p>
<p>International organisations then needed to analyse such information critically.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Dr Blix added that intelligence had been useful for UNMOVIC, and in one case </p>
<p>had led to the discovery of documents relating to laser enrichment of uranium:</p>
<p>“In other cases, intelligence has led to sites where no proscribed items were </p>
<p>found. Even in such cases, however, inspection of these sites were useful in </p>
<p>proving the absence of such items and in some cases the presence of other </p>
<p>items – conventional munitions. It shows that conventional arms are being moved </p>
<p>around the country and their presence is not necessarily related to weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction.”</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Referring to Secretary Powell’s presentation on 5 February, and in particular the </p>
<p>suggestion that “Iraq had prepared for inspections by cleaning up sites and removing </p>
<p>evidence of proscribed weapons programmes”, Dr Blix stated that he wanted to </p>
<p>comment on “the trucks identified by analysts as being for chemical decontamination </p>
<p>at a munitions depot”. That depot was a declared site, and one that Iraq would have </p>
<p>expected UNMOVIC to inspect. Dr Blix stated that: “We have noted that the two satellite </p>
<p>images of the site were taken several weeks apart. The reported movement of munitions </p>
<p>at the site could just as easily have been a routine activity as a movement of proscribed </p>
<p>munitions in anticipation of imminent inspection.” He added that: “Our reservation on this </p>
<p>point does not detract from our appreciation of the briefing.”</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Concluding his report, Dr Blix commented that:</p>
<p>“UNMOVIC is not infrequently asked how much more time it needs to complete its </p>
<p>task in Iraq. The answer depends on which task one has in mind … the disarmament </p>
<p>task – or the monitoring that no new proscribed activities occur …</p>
<p>“… Regrettably the high degree of co&#8209;operation required of Iraq for disarmament </p>
<p>through inspection was not forthcoming in 1991 …</p>
<p>“If Iraq had provided the necessary co&#8209;operation in 1991, the phase of disarmament </p>
<p>… could have been short and a decade of sanctions could have been avoided. </p>
<p>Today, three months after the adoption of resolution 1441 (2002) the period of </p>
<p>disarmament through inspection could still be short if ‘immediate, active and </p>
<p>unconditional cooperation’ with UNMOVIC and the IAEA were to be forthcoming.”</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that Dr Blix’s presentation had been “more </p>
<p>equivocal than 27 January, highlighting progress on process and other ‘hopeful’ signs </p>
<p>(e.g. new documents, the Iraqi commissions and the Iraqi decree on WMD)”.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>375. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that it paid to re&#8209;read Dr Blix’s reports of 14 February:</p>
<p>“It was clear that compliance was stepped up significantly as the prospect of military </p>
<p>action became more real, but it was also clear that the problem was unlikely to </p>
<p>be resolved unless those running Iraq had a genuine and not transitory change </p>
<p>of heart …</p>
<p>“They [UNMOVIC] were hopeful that Iraq could be disarmed; but the report still </p>
<p>concluded compliance had yet to conform to the requirement of the UN resolution </p>
<p>[1441] …”</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>Dr ElBaradei’s report, 14 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>376.  Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA had found no evidence of ongoing </b></p>
<p><b>prohibited nuclear or nuclear-related activities in Iraq, although a number </b></p>
<p><b>of issues were still under investigation.</b></p>
<p><b>377. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had conducted an additional 38 inspections at 19 locations since </p>
<p>his report to the Council on 27 January.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had continued to provide immediate access at all locations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had continued to interview key personnel and had recently been </p>
<p>able to conduct four interviews in private, although the interviewees had </p>
<p>recorded their interviews. In the meeting in Baghdad, Iraq had “reconfirmed its </p>
<p>commitment to encourage its citizens to accept interviews in private, both inside </p>
<p>and outside of Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had expanded the list of relevant personnel to more than 300 to include </p>
<p>higher&#8209;level key scientists; IAEA continued to ask for information about </p>
<p>personnel of lesser rank.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA intended to increase the numbers of inspectors and support staff and </p>
<p>to “expand and intensify the range of technical meetings and interviews”.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Iraq had provided documentation relating to the reported attempt to import </p>
<p>uranium, the attempted procurement of aluminium tubes, the procurement of magnets </p>

<p>acquisition of uranium and examining issues in relation to aluminium tubes and magnets. </p>
<p>On HMX, the IAEA might be unable to reach a final conclusion:</p>
<p>“While we have no indication that this material was used for any application </p>
<p>other than declared by Iraq, we have no technical method of verifying … the </p>
<p>declared use …”</p>
<p><b>379. </b> In relation to “documents found on 16 January in the private residence of an Iraqi </p>
<p>scientist”, the IAEA had “completed a more detailed review”. The documents related </p>
<p>“predominantly to lasers, including the use of laser technology to enrich uranium”. </p>
<p>“Nothing” in the documents altered “the conclusions previously drawn by the IAEA” </p>
<p>about the extent of Iraq’s laser enrichment programme.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Iraq had also provided documentation about questions and concerns which </p>
<p>had remained since 1998 about weapons and centrifuge design, but the documents </p>
<p>contained “no new information”. Dr ElBaradei hoped that “the new Iraqi commissions </p>
<p>… will be able to discover documents and other evidence that could assist in clarifying </p>
<p>remaining questions and concerns”.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Dr ElBaradei stated that the IAEA would continue to expand its capabilities </p>
<p>to “strengthen and accelerate” its ability to investigate matters of concern, and to </p>
<p>“reinstate and reinforce” its monitoring and verification system.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Dr ElBaradei had “reported on numerous occasions” that the IAEA had:</p>
<p>“… by December 1998 … concluded that it had neutralised Iraq’s past nuclear </p>
<p>programme and that therefore no unresolved disarmament issues remained … </p>
<p>Hence, our focus since the resumption of inspections … has been verifying whether </p>
<p>Iraq revived its nuclear programme in the intervening years.</p>
<p>“We have to date found no evidence of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear&#8209;related </p>
<p>activities in Iraq. However … a number of issues are still under investigation … we </p>
<p>intend to make full use of the authority granted to us … to build as much capacity </p>
<p>into the inspection process as necessary.</p>
<p>“In that context, I would underline the importance of information that States may </p>
<p>be able to provide to help us in assessing the accuracy and completeness of </p>
<p>information provided by Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>383. </b> Dr ElBaradei concluded that it was:</p>
<p>“… possible with an intrusive verification system, to assess the presence or absence </p>
<p>of a nuclear weapons programme … even without the full co&#8209;operation of the </p>
<p>inspected State.</p>
<p>“However, prompt, full and active co&#8209;operation by Iraq as required under resolution </p>
<p>1441 (2002) will speed up the process. More importantly, it will enable us to reach </p>
<p>the high degree of assurance required by the Security Council in the case of Iraq </p>

<p><b>Security Council discussions, 14 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>384.  In the discussion which followed the reports, significant differences between </b></p>
<p><b>members of the Security Council remained.</b></p>
<p><b>385.  Mr de Villepin stated that the inspectors should be given time to fulfil their </b></p>
<p><b>mission and a further meeting to assess the situation should be held on 14 March.</b></p>
<p><b>386.  France did not exclude a resort to force but it could be justified “only” if </b></p>
<p><b>inspections failed. The Council would “have to take a decision” if the inspectors </b></p>
<p><b>reported it was impossible to continue.</b></p>
<p><b>387. </b> The reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei were followed by a discussion in the </p>
<p>Security Council on 14 February.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>388. </b> The points made by Mr de Villepin included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In adopting resolution 1441 the Council had collectively agreed two stages: </p>
<p>“disarmament through inspections and, if this strategy should fail, consideration </p>
<p>by the Security Council of all the options, including resorting to force”. A second </p>
<p>resolution could be justified “only” if inspections failed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France did not believe the option of inspections had “been exhausted”, it could </p>
<p>“provide an effective response to the imperative of disarming Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of force would “have such heavy consequences for the people, </p>
<p>the region and international stability that it should be envisaged only </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Inspections were producing results, although each member of the Council </p>
<p>“would like more” and pressure on Baghdad should be maintained to </p>
<p>achieve that.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Real progress was being made. Aerial reconnaissance had been agreed. Iraq </p>
<p>had allowed interviews without minders. Draft legislation barring activities linked </p>
<p>to programmes for weapons of mass destruction was being adopted. Iraq was </p>
<p>providing a list of experts who witnessed the programmes of destruction in 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France had set out proposals to enhance the efficiency of inspections and would </p>
<p>be providing additional resources.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>War might seem to be the swiftest option in ensuring Iraqi compliance, but </p>
<p>building peace would be long and difficult. No one could maintain that war would </p>
<p>“lead to a safer, more just and more stable world”; war was “always the outcome </p>

<p>The inspectors should have “the time that is necessary for their mission </p>
<p>to succeed”. The Council should meet again at Ministerial level, on 14 March, </p>
<p>to “assess the situation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of force was “not justified at this time” and “premature recourse to the </p>
<p>military option would be fraught with risks”. It would call the unity of the Council </p>
<p>into question, and that would: “… remove its legitimacy and, in the long run, its </p>
<p>effectiveness. Such intervention could have incalculable consequences for the </p>
<p>stability of a scared and fragile region. It would compound the sense of injustice, </p>
<p>would aggravate tensions and would risk paving the way for other conflicts.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The priority was fighting terrorism. France had no intelligence of the links </p>
<p>between Al Qaida and the Baghdad regime alleged by Secretary Powell </p>
<p>on 5 February. Military action would exacerbate the divisions that nurtured </p>
<p>terrorism.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France did not exclude recourse to force if the inspectors reported that it </p>
<p>was “impossible for inspections to continue”. In that case, the “Council would </p>
<p>have to take a decision, and its members would have to shoulder all of their </p>
<p>responsibilities”.</p>

<p><b>392. </b> Mrs Alvear stated that indications of progress raised “some hopes for a decisive </p>
<p>change of attitude” from Iraq towards the demands of the international community, but </p>
<p>other attitudes revealed “an intention not to co&#8209;operate” and gave rise to “suspicions </p>
<p>about the presence of weapons of mass destruction”.</p>

<p> Iraq was not fully implementing </p>
<p>the resolutions and pressure on Saddam Hussein’s regime had to be maintained </p>
<p>“relentlessly and without relaxation”.</p>
<p><b>393. </b> Chile believed that the “inspections process must be continued, strengthened and </p>
<p>expanded to make it accurate, intrusive and capable of thwarting any effort at deception </p>
<p>or evasion”.</p>

<p>of work that combines conviction with respect for the concerns of others, the capacity </p>
<p>of persuasion with tolerance and, above all, patience”. Unity of the Council was:</p>
<p>“… the basis of any international action that seeks to be both legitimate and </p>
<p>effective. Only a united Council could credibly adopt the appropriate decisions for </p>
<p>achieving the objective of the disarmament of the Iraqi regime.”</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Chile wholeheartedly accepted Mr Annan’s invitation, in a recent speech, “to take </p>
<p>the necessary time to continue to seek the broadest possible consensus for achieving </p>
<p>a comprehensive solution”. That was the only way to exhaust all means to settle the </p>
<p>conflict peacefully and reserve the use of force “until the moment when it becomes clear </p>
<p>to all that peaceful means have failed”.</p>
<p><b>396.  China also called for the pursuit of a political settlement.</b></p>
<p><b>397. </b> Mr Tang Jiaxuan, the Chinese Foreign Minister, urged Iraq to recognise the </p>
<p>importance and urgency of inspections and to co&#8209;operate more pro&#8209;actively. China, </p>
<p>“in agreement with the majority opinion among Council members”, believed that the </p>
<p>inspections process was working. The Council had to “step up its efforts”. “Only by </p>
<p>pursuing a political settlement” could the Council “live up to the trust and hope that </p>
<p>the international community places in the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>398.  Spain questioned Iraq’s will to co-operate.</b></p>
<p><b>399. </b> Ms Palacio pointed out that active, immediate and complete co&#8209;operation from </p>
<p>Iraq was not yet forthcoming and all the areas of non&#8209;compliance and unresolved issues </p>
<p>mentioned in Dr Blix’s report of 27 January remained. Spain saw no need for more </p>
<p>inspections or an increase in capability. Peace and security were “ensured through </p>
<p>respect for and compliance with Security Council resolutions”. If there was no change </p>
<p>in the political will of Saddam Hussein to co&#8209;operate, the Council would be “obliged </p>
<p>to assume its responsibilities in the interests of the peace and security of the world”.</p>
<p><b>400.  Mr Straw also questioned whether Iraq had decided to co-operate and stated </b></p>
<p><b>that Iraq’s material breaches still existed.</b></p>
<p><b>401.  The authority of the United Nations and the responsibility of the Council </b></p>
<p><b>for peace and security were at issue from Iraq’s continued defiance.</b></p>
<p><b>402.  The UN Charter required the diplomatic process to be backed by the credible </b></p>
<p><b>threat of the use of force and its use if necessary.</b></p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Straw thanked Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei for “their great efforts in the face </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Mr Straw stated that the issue, which “could not be graver”, was “about the </p>
<p>authority of the United Nations and about the responsibility of the Security Council for </p>
<p>international peace and security”. All the members of the Council knew that Iraq had </p>
<p>“had these weapons [of mass destruction and long&#8209;range missiles]”; Iraq had been </p>
<p>“found guilty” in 1991. The issue was whether Iraq was “actively co&#8209;operating to get </p>
<p>rid of them”.</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Straw stated that Iraq had lied, had concealed weapons and played games. </p>
<p>As Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had:</p>
<p>“… spelled out in their report of 27 January, Iraq has failed to account for thousands </p>
<p>of tons of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals, of shells and bombs for </p>
<p>anthrax, for mustard gas, for VX nerve agent. They have failed to make a full and </p>
<p>complete disclosure as required of them … They have failed to co&#8209;operate fully </p>
<p>and actively on substance, as well as on process with the inspectors, and failed </p>
<p>substantively to meet the obligations imposed on them.”</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“… nobody who has spoken so far … has suggested for a second that Iraq is fully </p>
<p>and actively complying with the obligations that we imposed … So Iraq’s material </p>
<p>breaches … are still there.”</p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Straw posed a number of questions for the inspectors including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What were Iraq’s motives for refurbishing prohibited equipment destroyed </p>
<p>by UNSCOM?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How many interviews had taken place, and how many could the inspectors </p>
<p>be sure were not subject to Iraqi surveillance?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Had the “outstanding material identified by UNSCOM” been “satisfactorily </p>
<p>dealt with”?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How many “open issues” in the nuclear dossier had the IAEA been able </p>
<p>to close?</p>
<p><b>408. </b> Mr Straw stated that he interpreted Dr Blix’s report as meaning that “Iraq has yet </p>
<p>to be forthcoming with … immediate, active and unconditional co&#8209;operation”. Picking up </p>
<p>a phrase from Dr Blix’s report of 27 January, Mr Straw asked whether Dr Blix believed </p>
<p>Iraq had “yet come to a genuine acceptance of the disarmament that has been </p>
<p>demanded of it”.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> “Like every other member” of the Council, Mr Straw hoped and believed that </p>
<p>a peaceful solution to the crisis might “still be possible”. But that would require </p>
<p>a “dramatic and immediate change by Saddam” which would be achieved only if the </p>
<p>Council held its nerve.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>253</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Mr Straw concluded by stating that the period since resolution 687 (1991) had </p>
<p>been passed had “frankly been a period of humiliation” for the Council and the UN as </p>
<p>“games have been played with the Council’s authority”. The Charter required the Council </p>
<p>to “back the diplomatic process with a credible threat of force and also, if necessary, </p>
<p>to be ready to use that force”. If the Council decided to:</p>
<p>“… back away … to give unlimited time for little or no co&#8209;operation on substance – </p>
<p>then the disarmament of Iraq and the peace and security of the international </p>
<p>community, for which we are responsible, will not get any easier, but very </p>
<p>much harder.</p>
<p>“This issue is not just about Iraq … If we send out the message to proliferators … that </p>
<p>defiance of the United Nations pays, then it will not be peace that we have secured.”</p>
<p><b>411.  Secretary Powell stated that the Council should consider whether it was time </b></p>
<p><b>to consider the serious consequences intended by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>412. </b> The points made by Secretary Powell included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors had reported progress, but it was on process not substance, and </p>
<p>tricks were being played by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 was about disarmament, not inspections. It stated that Iraq was </p>
<p>in material breach of its obligations and must now come into compliance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The requirement in the resolution for a full, complete and accurate declaration </p>
<p>of its activities had been “an early test of Iraq’s seriousness; the answer in its </p>
<p>declaration [of 7 December] was that it was not going to co&#8209;operate”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Connections between Iraq and terrorist organisations were “now emerging”. </p>
<p>We could not wait for weapons of mass destruction to show up in our cities. </p>
<p>The weapons “could kill tens of thousands of people” if they “got into the </p>
<p>wrong hands”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq had been co&#8209;operating, documents would be flooding in and there would </p>
<p>be a queue of interviewees.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq did not need time to decide to co&#8209;operate. Iraq’s recent actions were not </p>
<p>responsible, they were “continued efforts to deceive, to deny, to divert, to throw </p>
<p>us off the trail”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 had anticipated Iraq’s response. The improvements in process, </p>
<p>more inspections and a longer inspection period would not move the position </p>
<p>that Iraq had “failed to comply”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The threat of force “should always be a last resort”, but it “must be a resort”. </p>
<p>The process could not be “endlessly strung out”, as Iraq was trying to do, until </p>
<p>the world’s attention moved in other directions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could not “be allowed to get away with it again”. The Council had </p>
<p>to think through the consequences of walking away or the reality of facing </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>the problem and the choice of whether or not it was time to consider the serious </p>
<p>consequences intended by 1441.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Secretary Powell concluded that:</p>
<p>“The security of the region, the hopes for the people of Iraq, and our security rest </p>
<p>upon us meeting our responsibilities and, if it comes to it, invoking the serious </p>
<p>consequences called for in resolution 1441 …”</p>
<p><b>414.  Mr Igor Ivanov stated that Iraq should be set clear tasks to provide objective </b></p>
<p><b>criteria by which to assess progress and the threat posed by Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>415.  The debate in the Council demonstrated that remedies other than the use </b></p>
<p><b>of force to achieve Iraq’s disarmament had not yet been exhausted.</b></p>
<p><b>416. </b> Mr Igor Ivanov stated that the Council should be guided by the professional </p>
<p>data provided by the inspectors to, “without making a mistake, come to the </p>
<p>correct conclusion”.</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Substantial progress had been made and could not be ignored. The Council should </p>
<p>urge Baghdad to increase co&#8209;operation and the work of the inspectors “must be made </p>
<p>more systematic and focused”. Iraq should be set clear tasks, including through the </p>
<p>submission of the UNMOVIC and IAEA work programme and the list of key disarmament </p>
<p>tasks required by resolution 1284 (1999). Adoption of such a programme would provide </p>
<p>“objective criteria” to assess both the degree of Baghdad’s co&#8209;operation and whether </p>
<p>Iraq was “a threat to international peace and security”.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Russia’s position, “shared by the overwhelming majority of States in the world, </p>
<p>including within the Security Council”, was that inspections “must continue”. There was:</p>
<p>“… a unique opportunity to reach agreement on how to solve this … problem </p>
<p>through political means, in strict accordance with the UN Charter. This is a real </p>
<p>opportunity, and it must not be missed. Force may be resorted to, but only when all </p>
<p>other remedies have been exhausted. As may be seen from today’s discussion, we </p>
<p>have not yet reached that point …”</p>
<p><b>419.  Other members of the Security Council emphasised the need for Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>to co-operate actively and unconditionally to disarm; the need to exhaust </b></p>
<p><b>the inspections route; and the importance of Council unity.</b></p>
<p><b>420. </b> Mr Luiz Derbez, the Mexican Foreign Minister, stated that the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>continued to evade its international responsibilities and the Council was united about the </p>
<p>goal of disarmament. But the Council was “increasingly divided as [to] the most effective </p>
<p>and least costly manner by which it may be achieved”. Mexico’s view was that the </p>
<p>“Security Council’s primary task” was to ensure the inspectors fulfilled their mission.</p>

<p>255</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Mamady Traoré, Guinean Permanent Representative to the UN and President </p>
<p>of the Council, advocated continued inspections although they “should not be continued </p>
<p>indefinitely”. Guinea was “concerned at the abrupt rise in tension within the international </p>
<p>community” over the Iraq crisis and appealed “for a swift beginning of direct and </p>
<p>constructive dialogue among Security Council members so that we can move beyond </p>
<p>this climate of tension which could deal a harsh blow to the United Nations system”. </p>
<p>Iraq must “finally agree” to co&#8209;operate and end its delaying tactics.</p>
<p><b>422. </b> Mr Munir Akram, Pakistani Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that it was </p>
<p>“understandable that the patience of some important members of the Security Council </p>
<p>is running out”. The call in resolution 1441 “was credible because it was unanimous”. </p>
<p>Pakistan believed that the “Security Council must maintain this unity of purpose and </p>
<p>action”. It could still unite around:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a general preference, even at this late stage, to secure the elimination of Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction through peaceful means”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s “immediate, active and unconditional co&#8209;operation”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a readiness to allow more time”.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Martin Belinga&#8209;Eboutou, Cameroonian Permanent Representative to the </p>
<p>UN, stated that Cameroon wished to “emphasise … the need for the Security Council </p>
<p>to continue to safeguard … its unity and cohesion”. He added: “The discord, the </p>
<p>cacophony, indeed the confusion surrounding us in recent days can only harm our </p>
<p>effectiveness.” Cameroon was “in favour of a peaceful settlement” and was “trying to </p>
<p>take a pragmatic and realistic approach”. It had “raised the possibility of more robust </p>
<p>inspections” which would require Iraq’s immediate, active and complete co&#8209;operation. </p>
<p>It was “clear that further non&#8209;compliance by Iraq with the demands of the Security </p>
<p>Council would be one violation too many”, which would leave the Council with “no other </p>
<p>choice but to adopt, in unity and cohesion, appropriate measures to have its decisions </p>
<p>respected within the provisions of the Charter”.</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Referring to Mr Annan’s speech on 8 February, Mr Belinga&#8209;Eboutou appealed </p>
<p>for unity and cohesion. He stated:</p>
<p>“The maintenance of peace and security is a very delicate and serious mission. </p>
<p>It requires at all times those who are responsible for it [to] transcend their </p>
<p>differences and act only in the interests of peace.”</p>
<p><b>425. </b> Mr Ismael Gaspar Martins, Angolan Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>stated that the Council was unable to say that Iraq was free from weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, but:</p>
<p>“… we are equally unable to state unequivocally that Iraq is fully armed with </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction or other weapons that pose a clear and impending </p>
<p>threat to international peace and security.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>426. </b> Mr Gaspar Martins was “confident that the Council” represented “a unified </p>
<p>coalition of the willing to secure international peace and security”. Whatever decision it </p>
<p>reached, it was “pivotal” that it was “based on convincing and far&#8209;reaching information”. </p>
<p>He warned that:</p>
<p>“Whatever decision we collectively take must be proportionate to the gravity </p>
<p>of the issue before us. That decision need not be popular; but it must be justified. </p>
<p>The consequences of a war clearly outweigh its benefits …”</p>
<p><b>427. </b> Mr Stefan Tafrov, Bulgarian Permanent Representative to the UN, stated that </p>
<p>Bulgaria believed that Iraq’s co&#8209;operation was “unsatisfactory” and it was unfortunate, </p>
<p>“as the statements made by the chief inspectors have confirmed”, that the Iraqi </p>
<p>authorities were “still in material breach” of resolution 1441. Bulgaria hoped that France’s </p>
<p>ideas would be one element of the overall Security Council strategy to disarm Iraq and </p>
<p>believed that that goal could still be achieved through peaceful means. But the Council </p>
<p>had repeatedly warned Iraq of serious consequences if it did not comply. Bulgaria </p>
<p>appealed to the Council to “stand united”. That was “an essential condition for a peaceful </p>
<p>outcome to the crisis and for averting future threats”.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Fischer stated that Iraq “must not be allowed to possess any weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and must disarm completely”. The inspectors had made “headway” and their </p>
<p>presence had “substantially diminished the danger emanating from Iraq”. They “must be </p>
<p>given the time to successfully complete their mission”. That required Iraq to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>fully, unconditionally and actively if a “looming tragedy” was to be averted.</p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Fischer concluded:</p>
<p>“All possible means for resolving the Iraqi crisis by peaceful means must be </p>
<p>thoroughly explored. Whatever decisions need to be made must be made by the </p>
<p>Security Council alone. It remains the only body internationally authorised to do so.</p>
<p>“Military action against Iraq would, in addition to the terrible humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences, above all endanger the stability of a tense and troubled region. </p>
<p>The consequences for the Near and Middle East could be catastrophic. There should </p>
<p>be no automatism leading to the use of military force. All possible alternatives need </p>
<p>to be exhaustively explored.”</p>
<p><b>430.  Iraq continued to state that it did not possess weapons of mass destruction.</b></p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had agreed to act on resolution 1441 and had “provided </p>
<p>everything that might fall within the concept of pro&#8209;active Iraqi co&#8209;operation”. The </p>
<p>documents provided with the Iraqi declaration of 7 December 2002, required “in&#8209;depth </p>
<p>study” because they contained “updated relevant information responding to many </p>
<p>questions”. Iraq had “the right to wonder whether the declaration had been studied with </p>
<p>due diligence and thoroughness”. Iraq had “begun to co&#8209;operate pro&#8209;actively”, and many </p>
<p>speakers had called for that but there was a question about what that would mean.</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>257</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Aldouri pointed out that there was an “Arabic proverb that an empty hand </p>
<p>has nothing to give. You cannot give what you do not have. If we do not possess such </p>
<p>weapons, how can we disarm ourselves? How can such weapons be dismantled if they </p>
<p>do not exist?”</p>
<p><b>433. </b> Iraq agreed that the “best way to resolve these issues is through continuing </p>
<p>pro&#8209;active co&#8209;operation with the inspectors”. Mr Aldouri stressed that Iraq had:</p>
<p>“… chosen the path of peace. We have opted for solutions that would satisfy the </p>
<p>international community. We are prepared to provide all means to assist in making </p>
<p>clear the true picture …</p>
<p>“We hope the Security Council will heed the desire of the vast majority of States </p>
<p>Members of the United Nations and allow the inspectors to fulfil their role …”</p>
<p><b>434.  In the subsequent private discussion, Mr Straw stated that there was </b></p>
<p><b>overwhelming evidence that Iraq had had WMD; if there was no evidence to show </b></p>
<p><b>that it had been destroyed, we had to work on the basis that it existed.</b></p>
<p><b>435. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, in response to points raised during the </p>
<p>private session of the Council:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had clarified that it was too soon to say whether Iraq had come to a </p>
<p>genuine acceptance of the disarmament required – there were some signs but </p>
<p>no break through. Interviews were a mixed bag. In reality, the inspectors had </p>
<p>had no one accept their conditions, though some people they had asked had </p>
<p>subsequently come back and accepted. The Iraqi decree on WMD did not say </p>
<p>anything about what Iraq would do in practice. UNMOVIC had expanded as </p>
<p>much as it could; if it expanded too fast, there was a risk of mistakes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei had voiced concerns about Iraq’s approach to interviews </p>
<p>and emphasised the importance of inspections as the cornerstone of the </p>
<p>international disarmament regime. He had also questioned whether Iraq needed </p>
<p>reassurance that a new item would not be regarded as a material breach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had stated that the reason that the Council had said Iraq’s WMD posed </p>
<p>a threat was because there was overwhelming evidence that Iraq had had the </p>
<p>material. If we had no evidence it had been destroyed, we had to work on the </p>
<p>basis that it existed and that there was a danger to the region and to our national </p>
<p>security. Oral cross&#8209;examination was the best way to get the truth. Interviewees </p>
<p>were not saying anything and were insisting on tape recorders because they </p>
<p>wanted to stay alive. Until Iraq allowed interviews outside Iraq and in free </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Palacio commented that “Iraqi progress had always been last minute and </p>
<p>under pressure”. In her legal experience, she had “never seen a situation were </p>
<p>[sic] witnesses did not speak freely unless they were threatened”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Powell questioned whether those who advocated reinforced </p>
<p>inspections were serious or afraid to step up to the challenge of Iraq’s lack </p>
<p>of compliance”.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>436. </b> Sir Jeremy commented that Dr Blix’s report was much more equivocal than that </p>
<p>of 27 January. His, and Dr ElBaradei’s, answers in the closed session were:</p>
<p>“… more indicative of their underlying suspicions, as though they knew their </p>
<p>prepared remarks had over&#8209;compensated. Tough exchanges with the Americans </p>
<p>the day before may have made Blix more determined to assert his independence.</p>
<p>“We have to go on hammering away at the logic of SCR 1441: it is about Iraq’s </p>
<p>approach, and not the inspections … When the Council middle ground … realise </p>
<p>they have to face up to hard and final decisions, they may take more account </p>
<p>of the responsibility they hold. So far, wishful procrastination continues to rule.”</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that, following his report on 27 January, </p>
<p>Dr Blix had “got a bit cross” with the US because they felt that might in itself amount </p>
<p>to a material breach. As a result, in his report on 14 February, Dr Blix had:</p>
<p>“… within the scope that he felt he had for interpretation … said, ‘They are actually </p>
<p>beginning to cooperate … So I feel I’m getting somewhere.’ The Americans were </p>
<p>quite cross about that …”</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Sir Jeremy added that, “in the lunch after”, Dr Blix “was tougher on the Iraqis and </p>
<p>their lack of co&#8209;operation in private than he had been in public, and it was clear from my </p>
<p>conversations with him … that … was affected by the reaction of the Americans to what </p>
<p>he had said on 27 January”.</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Asked if that was because Dr Blix did not want to provide an automatic trigger </p>
<p>for action, Sir Jeremy replied: “Yes”.</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Asked what Dr Blix had said about pressure from the US or UK, Sir Jeremy replied:</p>
<p>“Hans Blix complained more than once to me about the pressures from the </p>
<p>Americans. … [H]e felt the relationship with the British was much more reasonable </p>
<p>and professional and we weren’t trying to distort the facts for political reasons.</p>
<p>“… I never heard a word of complaint from him about the pressure being put on him </p>
<p>by the British …”</p>

<p><b>441.  Mr Annan concluded that there were real differences on strategy and timing </b></p>
<p><b>in the Security Council. Iraq’s non-co-operation was insufficient to bring members </b></p>
<p><b>to agree that war was justified; they would only move if they came to their own </b></p>
<p><b>judgement that inspections were pointless.</b></p>
<p><b>442. </b> The UKMIS New York record of a meeting between Mr Straw and Mr Annan </p>
<p>reported that they had discussed the fact that the majority of Council members </p>
<p>remained unpersuaded by the US and UK arguments.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> The strong probability of </p>
<p>Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation was not sufficient to bring them to agree that war was justified. </p>
<p>There were real differences on strategy and timing and Council members would only </p>
<p>move if they came to their own judgement that inspections were pointless.</p>
<p><b>443. </b> Mr Straw had commented that Saddam Hussein’s behaviour would be quite </p>
<p>different if he really had zero WMD. The UK and US would look at the timing of a </p>
<p>second resolution. The Council was more likely to be brought to a decision if we stuck </p>
<p>to the game plan, but we also had to do the political arithmetic. The Americans would </p>
<p>find it difficult to move forward if the Council majority really believed the inspections </p>
<p>were working.</p>
<p><b>444. </b> A separate record produced by the FCO reported that Mr Straw had commented </p>
<p>that the public saw 200,000 troops in the region and heard belligerent language and </p>
<p>thought we were determined to go to war tomorrow without good reason.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> He and </p>
<p>Mr Annan had discussed the need to keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein; and </p>
<p>that the threat of force could be more effective than its use. There was a possibility of </p>
<p>building a consensus with time but if the pace was forced there was a risk of one or </p>
<p>more vetoes. The problem was that the burden of evidence had shifted to those who </p>
<p>wanted military action. The fact that resolution 1441 required Iraqi compliance was lost. </p>
<p>Time was needed to get people to look at things differently, but different countries faced </p>
<p>different time pressures. American time was very expensive; others felt it was natural to </p>
<p>ask for more time. When asked to define “a little time”, Dr Blix had answered “one year”.</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Asked by the Inquiry whether, after the report on 27 January, he had expected </p>
<p>Dr Blix to be firm in his determination of a material breach, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… the whole point was that his [Dr Blix’s] view was that Iraq was complying </p>
<p>somewhat, but not fully and unconditionally, and as time went on, I became </p>
<p>increasingly alarmed … that we were just back into a game&#8209;playing situation with </p>
<p>Saddam … I think it is very clear from what we now know that he never had any </p>
<p>intention of his people co&#8209;operating fully with the inspectors.”</p>

<p><b>Iraq had decided to co-operate as required by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>448.  Mr Blair also continued to emphasise the moral case for removing </b></p>

<p><b>449. </b> On 15 February, as part of a weekend of worldwide protests against military action </p>
<p>in Iraq, a march organised by the Stop the War Coalition, the Campaign for Nuclear </p>
<p>Disarmament and the Muslim Association of Britain took place in London. The police </p>
<p>described it as the UK’s biggest ever demonstration, estimating that at least 750,000 </p>

<p><b>451. </b> Mr Campbell wrote the following day that Mr Blair had said Dr Blix’s presentation </p>
<p>was “a total disgrace, that he should have just told the truth, and the truth was Saddam </p>
<p>was not co&#8209;operating”. Mr Blair was in “a tough place”, but “showed no signs of changing </p>

<p>moving towards a regime change argument.” Mr Blair “felt we had to make more of the </p>

<p><b>452. </b> In the entry in his memoir for 14 February, Mr Cook wrote:</p>
<p>“The news from New York is electrifying. The latest report by Hans Blix registers a </p>
<p>lot of progress in co&#8209;operation from Iraq, fails to identify any evidence of weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction and expresses confidence that with more time more progress </p>
<p>can be made. What Hans Blix was in effect confirming was that the UK strategy of </p>
<p>applying pressure on Saddam to co&#8209;operate on disarmament, through the dual track </p>
<p>of inspectors on the ground and the threat of force across his border, is working </p>
<p>rather well.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr Cook added his view that Mr Blair needed the inspectors:</p>
<p>“… to prove that Saddam will not co&#8209;operate and that he is therefore justified </p>
<p>in going to war … The ghastly dilemma he now faces is that without Hans Blix </p>
<p>denouncing Saddam, there is little chance of getting a majority in the Security </p>
<p>Council for military conflict, and therefore even less chance of getting a majority of </p>
<p>the British people.”</p>
<p><b>454. </b> In his speech to the Labour Party conference in Glasgow on 15 February, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that the Labour Party would come through an uncertain time by holding firm to its </p>
<p>beliefs and the United Nations was one of those beliefs. He wanted:</p>
<p>“… to solve the issue of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction through the UN. </p>
<p>That is why last November we insisted on putting UN inspectors back into Iraq </p>
<p>to disarm it.</p>
<p>“Dr Blix reported to the UN yesterday and there will be more time given to </p>
<p>inspections. He will report again on 28 February. But let no one forget two things. </p>
<p>To anyone familiar with Saddam’s tactics of deception and evasion, there is a weary </p>
<p>sense of déjà vu. As ever, at the last minute concessions are made. And as ever it </p>
<p>is the long finger that is directing them. The concessions are suspect. Unfortunately, </p>
<p>the weapons are real.”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>455. </b> Mr Blair continued that the inspections regime in resolution 1441 was tough </p>
<p>because for 12 years Saddam Hussein had played a “game with the inspectors” and:</p>
<p>“The time needed is not the time it takes for the inspectors to discover the weapons. </p>
<p>They are not a detective agency. We played that game for years in the 1990s. The </p>
<p>time is the time necessary to make a judgement: is Saddam prepared to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>fully or not. If he is, the inspectors can take as much time as they want. If he is not, </p>
<p>if this is a repeat of the 1990s – and I believe it is – then let us be in no doubt what </p>
<p>is at stake.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>“By going down the UN route we gave the UN an extraordinary opportunity and </p>
<p>a heavy responsibility. The opportunity is to show that we can meet the menace </p>
<p>to our world together … The responsibility, however, is indeed to deal with it.”</p>
<p><b>456. </b> Referring to the failure of the League of Nations, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… Saddam would not be making a single concession without the knowledge </p>
<p>that forces were gathering against him. I hope, even now, Iraq can be disarmed </p>
<p>peacefully, with or without Saddam. But if we show weakness now, if we allow the </p>
<p>plea for more time to become just an excuse for prevarication until the moment for </p>
<p>action passes, then it will not only be Saddam who is repeating history. The menace, </p>
<p>and not just from Saddam, will grow; the authority of the UN will be lost; and the </p>
<p>conflict when it comes will be more bloody. Yes, let the United Nations be the way </p>
<p>to deal with Saddam. But let the United Nations mean what it says; and do what </p>
<p>it means.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> Referring to the threats posed by the proliferation of WMD and the threat </p>
<p>from terrorism and their potential consequences, as well as Iraq’s past behaviour, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“That is why Saddam and Weapons of Mass Destruction are important.</p>
<p>“Every time I have asked us to go to war, I have hated it …</p>
<p>“At every stage, we should seek to avoid war. But if the threat cannot be removed </p>
<p>peacefully, please let us not fall for the delusion that it can be safely ignored. If we </p>
<p>do not confront these twin menaces of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, </p>
<p>they will not disappear …</p>
<p>“When people say if you act, you will provoke these people … remember that </p>
<p>Al Qaida attacked the US …</p>
<p>“… Everyone agrees Saddam must be disarmed …</p>
<p>“No&#8209;one seriously believes he is yet co&#8209;operating fully. In all honesty, most people </p>
<p>don’t really believe he ever will … It’s not really an issue of timing … It is a moral </p>
<p>purpose, and I respect that.</p>
<p>“… I abhor the consequences of war.”</p>
<p><b>458. </b> Addressing the question of why he pressed “the case so insistently”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that he had set out:</p>
<p>“… the “geo political reason – the threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction and its link </p>
<p>with terrorism. And I believe it.</p>
<p>“If I am honest about it there is another reason why I feel so strongly …</p>

<p>“The moral case against war has a moral answer: it is the moral case for removing </p>
<p>Saddam. It is not the reason we act. That must be according to the United Nations </p>
<p>mandate on weapons of mass destruction. But it is the reason, frankly, why if we </p>
<p>do have to act, we should do so with a clear conscience.</p>
<p>“Yes, there are consequences of war. If we remove Saddam by force, people will die </p>
<p>and some will be innocent. And we must live with the consequences of our actions, </p>
<p>even the unintended ones.</p>
<p>“But there are also consequences of ‘stop the war’.</p>
<p>“If I … did not insist on disarmament … there would be no war. But there would still </p>
<p>be Saddam … ruling the Iraqi people …</p>
<p>“This isn’t a regime with weapons of mass destruction that is otherwise benign. </p>
<p>This is a regime that contravenes every single principle or value anyone of our </p>
<p>politics believes in.</p>
<p>“There will be no march for the victims of Saddam …</p>
<p>“I rejoice that we live in a country where peaceful process is a natural part of the </p>
<p>democratic process …</p>
<p>“I do not seek unpopularity as a badge of honour. But sometimes it is the price </p>
<p>of leadership. And the cost of conviction.”</p>
<p><b>459. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair’s speech was heard “in near silence … It was well </p>
<p>received, not least because it was so serious”. Mr Blair had been “confident and felt we </p>
<p>had the right argument and we now needed a big strategy to put the case properly”.</p>
<p>120</p>

<p>two days. When he asked whether a deadline of 15 April was acceptable, Secretary </p>
<p>Powell said that was too late.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Dr Blix also wrote that there was a lack of smoking guns that would impress the </p>

<p>an ultimatum” had felt the resistance stiffen and “came to think that a change of focus </p>
<p>might help. The new resolution could demand a declaration by Saddam showing that </p>

<p>would be to use the French demand for a further meeting in a month to ask for another </p>

<p>is a substantial risk … that the text will be vetoed, at which point the US … will go </p>
<p>for military action … I cannot imagine the Prime Minister then refusing to follow.</p>
<p>“… No SCR and a feeble, at best, legal basis for military action is a nightmare </p>
<p>scenario. The domestic consequences (and increased risk of terrorism to British </p>
<p>citizens and staff) are daunting enough for Ministers. But the … longer term damage </p>
<p>to UK interests would be more severe because longer lasting. The image of the </p>
<p>UK, lone ally […] of a rampant US in its assault on Iraq, will be the touchstone for </p>

<p>what convinces the experts may not convince public opinion unless it is pretty </p>
<p>spectacular); and a smooth transfer to a democratic and stable government </p>
<p>(improbable, especially without UN cover) would reduce the damage. But this </p>
<p>is a high risk route.</p>
<p>“Before we go down this route, we should have a last look at alternatives, </p>
<p>as Jeremy Greenstock is urging.”</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr Chaplin suggested that the UK should consider a deal with France, Germany </p>
<p>and Russia, insisting on full Iraqi compliance with a short list of key disarmament </p>
<p>tasks, backed by the maximum number of inspectors and increased air surveillance, </p>
<p>with a short deadline (15 March). There should be a signal in advance that, short of </p>
<p>full compliance, the five Permanent Members of the Security Council (P5) would vote </p>
<p>for an “all necessary means” text. This would come into force 10 days after the passage </p>
<p>of a Security Council resolution to give time for the Arabs to persuade Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>to stand down. The “goal would be one more last chance for Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p><b>476. </b> Mr Chaplin and Mr Ricketts had agreed that the latter would discuss the idea with </p>
<p>Mr Straw on their way to New York on 14 February.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Mr Pattison suggested two options to attract support from the “middle ground </p>
<p>members”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging Dr Blix to set specific tasks to demonstrate Iraqi compliance, </p>
<p>building on his own ideas; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Security Council to set specific tasks for Iraq with a deadline.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>478. </b> There would be difficulties with both approaches. The problem with the first option </p>
<p>would lie in “getting the US to accept further delay and the likelihood that Iraq would do </p>
<p>just enough to provoke future wrangling over the extent of their compliance”. In addition, </p>
<p>the US might be hesitant about giving Dr Blix a greater role. The problem with the </p>
<p>second option was that it “would create an expectation that the UNSC would need </p>
<p>to take a further decision to authorise serious consequences and we would expect Iraq </p>
<p>to do just enough to split the Council”.</p>
<p><b>479. </b> Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw:</p>
<p>“Each variant had pros and cons. The main difficulty could well be to bring the </p>
<p>Americans to accept any specific ultimatum given the scope it would leave for Iraq </p>
<p>to gain more time through minor concessions.”</p>

<p><b>480. </b> Mr Ricketts wrote that he and Sir David Manning had discussed a variant of </p>
<p>the approach Sir David had set out in his conversation with Dr Rice on 14 February. </p>
<p>That was to use the French proposal for a ministerial discussion in the Security </p>
<p>Council on 14 March to provide a deadline for asking Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei to </p>
<p>state whether Iraq was “in full and active co&#8209;operation”, including a demand that Iraq </p>
<p>destroy its prohibited rocket motors, which would then be taken as the basis for a </p>
<p>resolution. Dr Rice’s initial reaction had been maybe, but she had wanted a deadline of </p>
<p>28 February. Mr Ricketts and Sir David thought that was too soon and would not allow </p>
<p>sufficient time to rally middle&#8209;ground opinion. A 14 March deadline “should still fit with </p>
<p>other time lines and demonstrate that we are listening to those who call for more time”.</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Ricketts conceded that the proposal was “not a brilliant strategy” but it “might </p>
<p>be a way forward avoiding signals of weakness”.</p>
<p><b>482.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that more time would be needed and that </b></p>
<p><b>the inspectors should be given the chance to deliver a judgement which would </b></p>
<p><b>convince the Council.</b></p>
<p><b>483. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the UK could table a resolution the following </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> The existing version would “not get nine votes, but it will signal the beginning </p>
<p>of the end game and Council minds will have to concentrate within a harder context”. </p>
<p>In his view, the “Best area for plan B options” was “some kind of loaded ultimatum”.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Sir Jeremy’s view was that postponing the discussion to 14 March would not </p>
<p>be sufficient to secure support: “If the judgement is left to Blix, e.g. to say whether or </p>
<p>not Iraq has co&#8209;operated ‘immediately, actively and unconditionally’”, he “may not be </p>
<p>capable of taking the heat or Council members may try to alter the terms in their favour”.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> There would also be a problem with the US. Sir Jeremy reported that Ambassador </p>
<p>Negroponte had told him that President Bush would not agree to anything which </p>
<p>changed the terms of 1441 (especially OP2), or altered their current legal foundation </p>
<p>for action, or ensnared the Council in endless argument about interpretation. The </p>
<p>current US thinking was to table their draft mid&#8209;week and to set a date (probably the </p>
<p>end of February) for a vote.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Ambassador Negroponte “in general terms” </p>
<p>that more would be needed:</p>
<p>“Ideally, we should not move to the use of force without a find, a smoking gun. </p>
<p>We should maximise the possibilities for that. We should expose the French </p>
<p>reinforcement proposals as clearly inadequate for the disarmament of Iraq: indeed, </p>
<p>no proposition other than war has yet been made which will realistically achieve that – </p>
<p>something I said in terms to EU HOMS [Heads of Mission] meeting this morning.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Sir Jeremy suggested that elements in the ultimatum should “either test the </p>
<p>French idea to destruction … or give the inspectors a real chance to deliver a judgement </p>
<p>which will convince six more Council members”. Dr Blix could play a role: “There </p>
<p>should be room to move him to a firmer approach which raises the chances of the </p>
<p>inspectors achieving more.” Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix was interested in ideas </p>
<p>for more vigorous inspections “though downbeat about the amount of time available </p>
<p>from the US”.</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“If we and the US are true to our pronouncements of force as a last resort, bringing </p>
<p>the Americans back to their mid&#8209;September approach as a last gasp before pressing </p>
<p>the plunger at least has a certain logical force.”</p>
<p><b>489.  Sir David Manning proposed a resolution setting a deadline of 14 March for </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein to demonstrate that he was complying fully with resolution 1441, </b></p>
<p><b>after which he would be in further material breach.</b></p>
<p><b>490.  Sir David envisaged that military action would not begin until late March, </b></p>
<p><b>giving 10 days for Arab leaders to persuade Saddam Hussein to depart.</b></p>
<p><b>491.  The resolution should specify what compliance meant. That would set </b></p>
<p><b>the bar at a level it would be difficult for Saddam Hussein to reach and prevent </b></p>
<p><b>equivocation in the inspectors’ reports.</b></p>
<p><b>492.  France would seek to block the resolution and to string out inspections </b></p>
<p><b>indefinitely.</b></p>
<p><b>493. </b> Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair on 16 February that Dr Blix’s careful “fence </p>
<p>sitting” in his report to the Security Council had:</p>
<p>“… encouraged the wishful thinkers and procrastinators. For the moment, there </p>
<p>is almost certainly a Security Council majority for letting the inspections run, not </p>
<p>for moving to early military action.”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>494. </b> Sir David advised that it would be necessary “to go on making the argument that </p>
<p>the issue is compliance. Our best bet may be to concede a little more time while issuing </p>
<p>an ultimatum.”</p>
<p><b>495. </b> Sir David set out a proposal along the lines suggested by Mr Ricketts to Mr Straw, </p>
<p>including a second resolution “stipulating that unless Blix reports on 14 March that </p>
<p>Saddam is in full, unqualified, unequivocal compliance with 1441, he will be in further </p>
<p>material breach”. There would then be an immediate vote after Dr Blix reported.</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Sir David suggested that, subject to advice from Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the UK </p>
<p>might “spell out, either in the resolution or orally … that full compliance includes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>explaining satisfactorily what happened to all the BW and CW unaccounted </p>
<p>for when UNSCOM were forced out of Iraq in 1998;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>full and unfettered access to, and co&#8209;operation from […] who were allegedly </p>
<p>involved in the destruction of Iraq’s chemical stocks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>full and unfettered access to, and co&#8209;operation from, all scientists UNMOVIC </p>
<p>wished to interview both inside and outside Iraq, as provided for in </p>
<p>UNSCR 1441.”</p>
<p><b>497. </b> Sir David added that those “conditions set the bar too high for compliance, yet are </p>
<p>fundamental to it”. Dr Blix would “find it hard to pretend otherwise, whatever marginal </p>
<p>improvements Saddam may go on making on process as opposed to substance”.</p>
<p><b>498. </b> In tabling the resolution, the UK:</p>
<p>“… should emphasise that we are giving the French the extra time they want; and </p>
<p>we are taking Blix at his word … ‘inspections could still be short if immediate, active </p>
<p>and unconditional co&#8209;operation … were to be forthcoming’.”</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Sir David identified a number of disadvantages:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Americans will dislike it. As usual they are in a hurry. But the military </p>
<p>timetable can be adjusted if necessary. It would probably mean action in the last </p>
<p>few days of March i.e. after a vote on the second resolution on 15 March and </p>
<p>a further 10 days for the Arabs to press Saddam to leave.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Blix will dislike having to make a categoric judgement … We must draft the </p>
<p>resolution so that he cannot equivocate and cannot honestly give a verdict  </p>
<p>of full compliance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The French … will work to block it. Their game is to string things out </p>
<p>indefinitely …”</p>
<p><b>500. </b> Sir David also identified the advantages:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It gives us another month to find our secure nine votes. We can claim that we </p>
<p>have been reasonable; four months on from 1441 no&#8209;one should seriously </p>
<p>argue that it is impossible to tell if Saddam is complying. A deadline will also </p>
<p>focus minds …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We have another four weeks in which the inspectors just might get lucky.  </p>
<p>A real find would have a major impact on Security Council opinion …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It will give Saddam four more weeks to make a mistake. He may do so, perhaps </p>
<p>reacting badly if Blix announces later this week that the Iraqis must destroy their </p>
<p>Al Samoud 2 missiles with their costly engines. If Saddam refuses to co&#8209;operate, </p>
<p>it will be a glaring example of Iraqi non&#8209;compliance.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Sir David concluded that it was “impossible to be certain” that the strategy would </p>
<p>work, “but it gives us a chance. The odds are against a successful second resolution </p>
<p>at the end of February … an extra couple of weeks could make the difference.”</p>
<p><b>502. </b> Sir David advised “saying nothing” until after the European Council, allowing </p>
<p>France a little more time, then hitting them with the draft resolution “probably  </p>
<p>in mid&#8209;week”. Before that, Mr Blair would “need to do a heavy selling job” with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p><b>503.  Mr Blair agreed the proposals were worth exploring and asked for advice, </b></p>
<p><b>particularly on the proposed “tests” for Iraq’s compliance.</b></p>
<p><b>504. </b> Mr Blair agreed that the ideas in Sir David Manning’s advice of 16 February were </p>
<p>worth exploring.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> That is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>505.  Mr Straw was told that President Bush believed Mr Blair would commit </b></p>
<p><b>troops if the US took unilateral action.</b></p>
<p><b>506. </b> Mr Straw discussed developments with Secretary Powell twice on 16 February.</p>
<p><b>507. </b> In the first conversation at 1pm, Mr Straw set out his “emerging thinking”, </p>
<p>including the suggestion that a meeting might be held on 14 March at which Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Dr ElBaradei would be asked to report if Iraq was “actively and fully co&#8209;operating, </p>
<p>perhaps against a checklist”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> Mr Straw added that he thought that Dr Blix:</p>
<p>“… would try to avoid responsibility for this. But whilst a further material breach and </p>
<p>what we did about it were matters for the Security Council, saying whether Iraq </p>
<p>was or was not co&#8209;operating had initially to be a matter for the inspectors since </p>
<p>the information … was theirs. After all, it was Blix’s statement … about further </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation … on process which had put us on the back foot.”</p>
<p><b>508. </b> In a discussion about the content of any checklist, Mr Straw said that it was </p>
<p>important it:</p>
<p>“… did not become a ‘tick in the box for compliance’, but rather good evidence of </p>
<p>compliance and it had to be very comprehensive, so that if he [Saddam Hussein] did </p>
<p>all these things he was complying in reality.”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell agreed that if Saddam Hussein was faced with a </p>
<p>choice, for example, of whether to destroy missile engines and the survival of his regime, </p>
<p>he would choose the latter. Mr Straw added that:</p>
<p>“… since the objective of HMG’s policy was … the disarmament of Iraq’s WMD if </p>
<p>possible by peaceful means, clear and continuing evidence of Saddam’s compliance </p>

<p>271</p>
<p>on substance would be bound to negate the case for the UK’s involvement </p>
<p>in military action.”</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Secretary Powell was reported to have responded that he understood that:</p>
<p>“… but he was not sure that was where President Bush was. He might still be </p>
<p>inclined to ‘go it alone’ for the removal of Saddam and the President believed that </p>
<p>the Prime Minister would commit British troops in any event.”</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Mr Straw said that Mr Blair’s “personal loyalty to the President was never in doubt; </p>
<p>but that alone would not answer the question whether there was adequate legal and </p>
<p>political justification for UK military involvement”.</p>
<p><b>512. </b> In response to Secretary Powell’s comment that he assumed the demonstration </p>
<p>on 15 February made a second resolution “even more necessary”, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“… yes. If there were nine votes or more in the Security Council for a second </p>
<p>resolution, and this majority was subject to a veto by one only of the P5, I thought </p>
<p>we could carry the day in the Commons and the country but there would have </p>
<p>to be … clear evidence of substantive non&#8209;compliance by Iraq of 1441. Without </p>
<p>the latter, we could have no chance. Regime change per se had never been the </p>
<p>objective of HMG’s strategy however desirable it was.”</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Straw added that:</p>
<p>“… even with a second resolution (or a majority and a veto but good case) the </p>
<p>political and public order consequences of the early stages of military action on </p>
<p>current plans would be hard to handle: without a very strong case, consistent with </p>
<p>our clear, already stated objectives, they could become unmanageable. Unless we </p>
<p>were very lucky, military action without an effective international consensus could </p>
<p>severely damage US as well as UK interests.”</p>
<p><b>514. </b> In a discussion of the timing for a second resolution, Mr Powell said he was still </p>
<p>thinking about tabling a resolution that week but stating that a vote was not being asked </p>
<p>for immediately. Mr Straw pointed out the disadvantages for the UK while Parliament </p>
<p>was in recess, adding that tabling a resolution without any commitment for an early vote </p>
<p>would be seen as a sign of weakness. It might also make it harder to secure the votes </p>
<p>of the elected members of the Council. It might also be seen as ignoring the outcome </p>
<p>of the inspectors’ reports on 28 February.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>515. </b> In their second conversation at 8.30pm, following a conversation between Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Secretary Powell, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell considered a list of particular </p>
<p>issues which could be used to judge compliance.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> Those need not be specified </p>
<p>in the resolution but could include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the destruction of the Al Samoud 2 missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a push on interviews;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>control of road traffic;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>control of the Syrian pipeline; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>legitimisation of existing No&#8209;Fly Zones and their potential extension to cover </p>
<p>all of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>516. </b> The bar would need to be set high enough to ensure that there really was </p>
<p>compliance. Dr Blix had suggested a deadline of 15 April, which Secretary Powell </p>
<p>said “would be difficult for the US”, though it fitted with the deadline Mr Blair had </p>
<p>“originally suggested”.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Secretary Powell also suggested that there would be a presentational problem for </p>
<p>President Bush if Saddam complied, and that “He would be unhappy publicly, but almost </p>
<p>certainly relieved in private.”</p>
<p><b>European Council, 17 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>518. </b> On behalf of the European Union, the Greek Presidency had delivered a demarche </p>
<p>to Iraq on 4 February stating that it was “deeply concerned” about the crisis and that time </p>
<p>was “running out”. It called on Iraq “fully, unconditionally and immediately” to comply with </p>
<p>all resolutions and to co&#8209;operate pro&#8209;actively with the inspectors. If Iraq did not comply, </p>
<p>it would “carry the responsibilities for all the consequences”.</p>

<p><b>520. </b> Recognising that the debate would need to “take full account” of Dr Blix </p>
<p>and Dr ElBaradei’s reports to the Security Council on 27 January and 14 February, </p>
<p>Mr Blair set out a number of elements that “might form the basis for our debate </p>
<p>and the conclusions we draw”. Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reaffirming the EU position agreed at the 27 January meeting of the General </p>
<p>Affairs and External Relations Committee (GAERC), “particularly the full </p>
<p>implementation of UNSCR 1441 to achieve the objective of Iraqi disarmament </p>
<p>of all its WMD. Iraq must comply fully, actively, immediately and unconditionally </p>
<p>with its international obligations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Clarity about the implications of resolution 1441. OP2 had given Iraq a final </p>
<p>opportunity to comply: “But Saddam had not taken that opportunity. His false </p>
<p>statements and omissions in the December declaration and failure to co&#8209;</p>
<p>operate fully with the inspectors are a material breach of the resolution [OP4]”. </p>
<p>So, as OP13 made “explicit”, Saddam faced “serious consequences”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military action was a last resort, but the Council “must make it clear that no </p>
<p>Member State rules it out if needed to uphold the authority of the Security </p>
<p>Council. We should also be clear that in the absence of full and immediate </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, the UNSC should move quickly to a second resolution.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maintaining and increasing the pressure on Saddam: “Time is now running very </p>
<p>short. There is still a last opportunity for Saddam to co&#8209;operate unconditionally </p>
<p>with the international community’s demands or to leave. But failing that, we </p>
<p>should be clear Saddam faces immediate and serious consequences.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The EU should ensure it was ready to contribute to humanitarian and </p>
<p>reconstruction issues.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Addressing the regional implications of the crisis by “underlining … the </p>
<p>importance we attach to early progress towards a lasting settlement between </p>
<p>Israelis and Palestinians on the basis of the Road Map”.</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Mr Straw wrote to his Cabinet colleagues on 14 February, reiterating the point </p>

<p>with members of the Security Council in “the crucial period leading up to consideration </p>
<p>of a new resolution on Iraq”.</p>

<p>on 17 February, Mr Blair “was keen on a major upgrade of our communications </p>
<p>and believed we could win the argument as set out at the weekend”.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>524.  An extraordinary meeting of the European Council to discuss Iraq on </b></p>
<p><b>17 February pledged “full support” to Security Council efforts and to work with </b></p>
<p><b>partners, “especially the United States”, to disarm Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>525.  Mr Annan appealed for transatlantic unity and patient persuasive diplomacy </b></p>
<p><b>behind closed doors. The UN would be seriously weakened if action was taken </b></p>
<p><b>without its authority.</b></p>
<p><b>526. </b> The discussion of Foreign Ministers addressed the objective of disarmament </p>
<p>rather than regime change, the need for a second resolution whilst the inspections were </p>
<p>continuing, the consequences of military action, and the role of the EU, its relationship </p>
<p>with the US and its credibility.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Mr Straw said:</p>
<p>“… what was at stake was the future of multilateralism in a unipolar world. France </p>
<p>emphasised the power of words but not the power of action. Europe was very </p>
<p>multilateralist in decision&#8209;making but not so when it came to action. There were </p>
<p>essentially three fundamental issues involved: Iraq remained a threat to international </p>
<p>security; the only reason that inspections were taking place was because of military </p>
<p>pressure on Saddam; and Iraq was not complying. The EU would not be having this </p>
<p>discussion unless the US and the UK were willing to pay for this military build up and </p>
<p>put their troops on the line. They could not stay there forever but that did not mean </p>
<p>that events were being driven by a military timetable.”</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Mr Annan’s address to the Council was reported as “uncompromising in putting </p>
<p>the onus on Saddam to implement resolution 1441; and to implement it swiftly”.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If the Security Council managed the current crisis successfully, it would emerge with </p>
<p>its authority enhanced. But if it failed, and action was taken without its authority, the UN </p>
<p>would be seriously weakened. If Iraq were allowed to defy the Security Council because </p>
<p>the international community failed to impose itself, the foundations of collective security </p>
<p>would be gravely undermined. An effective international security system depended </p>
<p>on the Council and on its determination to take action in even the most difficult cases.</p>

<p>behind closed doors to build a common front. The greater the degree of consensus </p>

<p>in dealing with Iraq, the greater the chance of resolving other crises, particularly </p>
<p>Israel/Palestine.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> In the discussion over dinner, Mr Blair said there were three issues at stake:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The authority of the UN</b>. That was set out in resolution 1441 passed after </p>
<p>twelve years of Iraqi prevarication. The UN had made clear this was a final </p>
<p>opportunity requiring full compliance. In neither the December declaration nor </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s reports to the Security Council in January and February was there any </p>
<p>sign of full compliance on substance. If there were 100 percent Iraqi compliance, </p>
<p>the inspectors could take as long as they needed. But the inspectors were not </p>
<p>supposed to be a detective agency. Co&#8209;operation was key. If we were not careful </p>
<p>we would be back in the situation we were in in the nineties.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s WMD</b>. There was no intelligence agency of any member state which </p>
<p>did not know Iraq possessed these weapons. It was true that conflict meant </p>
<p>bloodshed. But it was not true that the absence of conflict meant the absence of </p>
<p>bloodshed. Thousands of Iraqis were dying under Saddam Hussein. Four million </p>
<p>were in exile. The rate of Iraqi infant mortality in areas outside Saddam’s control </p>
<p>was a quarter of that in areas under Baghdad’s rule.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>EU/US relations</b>. Iraq had to be resolved in a way which met the objective of </p>
<p>maintaining EU/US relations. That did not mean the EU had to do things simply </p>
<p>because the US wanted. The way Europe handled Iraq would have profound </p>
<p>implications for generations to come. The key was to ensure resolution 1441 </p>
<p>was implemented. “The UN had to be the way of dealing with this issue, not </p>
<p>a way of avoiding it.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>531. </b> The Council statement agreed at the dinner left the decision on inspectors’ time </p>
<p>and resources to the UN Security Council and made it clear that immediate action was </p>
<p>needed by Iraq.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> It was seen by the media as more robust than expected.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> The statement said that the European Council was “determined to deal effectively </p>
<p>with the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction”; and that it was </p>
<p>“committed to the United Nations remaining at the centre of the international order”. </p>
<p>The European Council recognised that “the primary responsibility for dealing with Iraqi </p>
<p>disarmament lies with the Security Council”; and it pledged its “full support”. It wanted </p>
<p>to achieve disarmament peacefully, and that was what the people of Europe wanted: </p>
<p>“War is not inevitable. Force should only be used as a last resort. It is for the Iraqi regime </p>
<p>to end this crisis …”</p>

<p>time and resources that the UN Security Council believes they need. However, </p>

<p>“Baghdad should have no illusions … The Iraqi regime alone will be responsible for </p>
<p>the consequences if it continues to flout the will of the international community and </p>
<p>does not take this last chance.”</p>
<p><b>534. </b> The European Council would “work with Arab countries and The League of Arab </p>
<p>Nations … to bring home to Saddam Hussein the extreme danger of miscalculation”. </p>
<p>It also reiterated “its firm belief in the need to invigorate the peace process in the </p>
<p>Middle East and to resolve the Israeli&#8209;Palestinian conflict”.</p>
<p><b>535. </b> The European Council concluded:</p>
<p>“The unity of the international community is vital in dealing with these problems. </p>

<p><b>539. </b> In his monthly press conference the following day, Mr Blair made an opening </p>
<p>statement setting out the “basic case” for the international community’s response </p>
<p>to Iraq.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>540. </b> The points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “a threat” whose actions over the last 12 years made </p>
<p>him unique.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The stance taken by the world against Saddam was “not just vital in its own </p>
<p>right”, it was “a huge test of our seriousness in dealing with the twin threats </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the UN was “to keep credibility, it must act to implement its stated will”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “plain in our judgement that Saddam” continued to be “in breach”. </p>
<p>No country at the European Council had disputed that his co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>was “neither unconditional nor complete”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no rush to war”. It was “over three months” since Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had been given a final opportunity to comply. But without a change of heart, the </p>
<p>inspectors were “never going to be able to play detective to search out weapons </p>
<p>hidden in a country” the size of Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The basis for action was disarmament.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The demonstrators on 15 February had “a rightful hatred of the consequences </p>
<p>of war”, but they should “also listen to the voices of some of the four million Iraqi </p>
<p>exiles”. The nature of the regime could not itself provide justification for war, it </p>
<p>could “at least show why if we do have to take military action, we do so in the </p>
<p>sure knowledge that we are removing one of the most barbarous and detestable </p>
<p>regimes in modern political history”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>People were against a war which they felt was “rushed or unnecessary” and </p>
<p>wanted to know war was not inevitable. Saddam Hussein could avoid war if he </p>
<p>co&#8209;operated fully and that was the “reasonable and easily delivered requirement” </p>
<p>of the international community.</p>
<p><b>541. </b> Asked if he reserved the right to go to war without a majority in the UN, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that there were “certain situations in which you have simply got to say to people </p>
<p>look this is what I believe and this is what I think is right”. He added that there were </p>
<p>“certain issues, particularly where there are issues of life and death, where I think the job </p>
<p>and duty of the Prime Minister is to say to people what you honestly think, and then they </p>
<p>have got to make up their minds”.</p>
<p><b>542. </b> Mr Blair subsequently stated that he did not believe that he would be in a position </p>
<p>where there was no majority in the Security Council, and he did not want to indulge </p>
<p>in speculation on that point.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Asked about concerns that Washington was rushing unilaterally into action, </p>
<p>Mr Blair responded that people who wanted “to pull Europe and America apart” were </p>
<p>“playing the most dangerous game of international politics” he knew. That was “so </p>
<p>dangerous for the security of the world”. The US had listened to its allies and agreed </p>
<p>to go through the UN to give Saddam Hussein a final chance to disarm. But having done </p>
<p>that, if Saddam did not disarm, Mr Blair asked, “what prospect is there of persuading </p>
<p>America in the future to go down the multilateral route if having taken that route we then </p>
<p>just shy away from the consequences”?</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Asked why public opinion was moving against action, Mr Blair replied that in </p>
<p>relation to Kosovo and Afghanistan, there had been “a very immediate casus belli”. </p>
<p>It was “more difficult to persuade people of the link between a state like Iraq with </p>
<p>chemical, or biological, or nuclear weapons and the link with international terrorism”. </p>
<p>It was his job to try to “persuade people of that, and also to persuade people of the </p>
<p>moral case for removing Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>545. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that “the plan was to consolidate” on the success </p>
<p>at the European Council, and “restate the basic case and get going re Iraq exiles”. </p>
<p>In his meeting of the Iraq communications group on 18 February there was:</p>
<p>“… a clear understanding that we were widening [the communications strategy] </p>
<p>to take in the bigger dimension of the moral and humanitarian side, and we had </p>
<p>to be clear about whether this was shifting to a regime change position. We had </p>
<p>to be clear that it didn’t, that the basic rationale hadn’t changed, but equally we </p>
<p>were entitled to make the case that the world would be better off without him </p>
<p>[Saddam Hussein] in power.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>546. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote:</p>
<p>“The US was still giving out the message that it was going to happen and the rest </p>
<p>was just giving us cover, eg saying that a second resolution wasn’t absolutely </p>
<p>necessary but they would try to get it. Maybe they were just getting irritated with </p>
<p>us for having taken them down the UN route in the first place.”</p>
<p><b>UK proposals for a draft second resolution</b></p>
<p><b>547. </b> On 17 February, Sir David Manning had sent his advice to Mr Blair, of 16 February, </p>
<p>to Mr Straw’s Private Office and to Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary </p>
<p>(PUS), Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Sir Richard Dearlove.</p>

<p><b>548. </b> Sir David asked:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Were these the “right” tests?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Were there others that could added?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Should the tests be included explicitly in a second resolution, or should this </p>
<p>take the form of a short text simply stating that Saddam Hussein is in breach </p>
<p>of 1441, while the conditions he must meet by 14 March are set out in an </p>
<p>accompanying statement?”</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Sir David asked for advice that day, stating that his letter and accompanying </p>
<p>minute should be held “very tightly”, handled “on a strictly need to know basis” and </p>
<p>the addressees should “keep the papers off main files”.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice before the EU Council on 17 February.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>551. </b> In response to Dr Rice’s report that, in a conversation with Dr Blix over the </p>
<p>weekend, Dr Blix had “felt bad that he had given the Iraqis too much in his … </p>
<p>presentation to the Security Council”, Sir David said that Dr Blix had “overdone the </p>
<p>course correction, worried by the reaction to his earlier presentation on 27 January”.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that Dr Blix “had hinted” to Mr Straw “that he might be in </p>
<p>the market for an ultimatum” and they discussed his report which would summarise the </p>
<p>outstanding disarmament questions. They also discussed whether the Security Council </p>
<p>should instruct Dr Blix to destroy the Al Samoud missiles. Sir David commented that he </p>
<p>“strongly favoured” that: “Saddam would hate having to do it and might be provoked into </p>
<p>making a mistake.”</p>
<p><b>553. </b> Sir David said the UK was thinking about the shape and timing of an ultimatum:</p>
<p>“We did not have nine votes in the Security Council at present, and were very </p>
<p>unlikely to get there by 28 February … we needed time to shift three or four </p>
<p>abstentions … If it became clear that we could win, we could hope the French  </p>
<p>would decide to abstain rather than veto. It was going to be a tough sell …  </p>
<p>Once the ultimatum was down, and the deadline was clear, the dynamics would </p>
<p>change … We must take more time if we needed it.”</p>
<p><b>554. </b> In the subsequent discussion about how to increase the number of votes in favour </p>
<p>of a resolution and whether, if there was a majority, France would abstain rather than </p>
<p>veto, Dr Rice said that would be a “tough fight” in the US Administration about more </p>
<p>time. She thought 8 March, “exactly four months” after the adoption of resolution 1441, </p>
<p>might be better than 14 March as the French wanted. Sir David commented that he “saw </p>
<p>the attraction”, but: “We must take more time if we need it.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice discussed possible avenues to increase the diplomatic </p>
<p>pressure on Saddam Hussein to leave. Dr Rice’s view was that “there were still two </p>
<p>possible outcomes to the crisis: Saddam could step down; or the Security Council would </p>
<p>conclude that he was not complying with 1441 and that action must follow”. They agreed </p>
<p>it would be important to have a clear plan by the end of that week.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Sir David asked Sir Jeremy Greenstock to “sound out” Dr Blix about a possible visit </p>
<p>to London “in the next few days” because Mr Blair “would like to see him, one on one, to </p>
<p>discuss ideas about an ultimatum”. He concluded that the evidence suggested Dr Rice’s:</p>
<p>“… thinking on the way forward is similar to ours. We shall have to think hard about </p>
<p>whether to press for 14 rather than 8 March as the date for a vote … but at least </p>
<p>Condi [Rice] has now moved away from 28 February. This is something the Prime </p>
<p>Minister will want to discuss with Bush when they speak later this week.”</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Mr Blair spoke to Dr Blix on 20 February.</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Separately, Mr Rycroft produced a list of possible elements for inclusion </p>
<p>in an ultimatum, drawing on the provisions of resolution 1441:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full explanations of all the material unaccounted for in the last UNSCOM report, </p>
<p>and answers to all of UNSCOM’s questions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A full list of those involved in the destruction of old chemical weapons stocks, </p>
<p>and full and unfettered access to them in interviews at the location of the </p>
<p>inspectors’ choice and without Iraqi government representatives.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Similarly full co&#8209;operation over the interviews of any other witnesses called </p>
<p>by the inspectors, inside or outside Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full co&#8209;operation over any exclusion zones declared by the inspectors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full co&#8209;operation over the destruction of the Al Samoud rockets and all other </p>
<p>material identified for destruction by the inspectors.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>559.  Sir Richard Dearlove counselled against specifying the points on which </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein should comply; there was “ample evidence” that he was not, </b></p>
<p><b>and had no intention of, complying. There was no guarantee that inspections </b></p>
<p><b>would produce conclusive physical evidence.</b></p>
<p><b>560. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove stated that, in his view, the best course would be to stick </p>
<p>with a short text stating that Saddam Hussein was not complying with, and was </p>
<p>therefore in breach of, resolution 1441, backed by the available evidence that that was </p>
<p>the case.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> Listing the points on which we wanted Saddam Hussein to comply would </p>
<p>undermine the overarching argument of resolution 1441 that it was Saddam Hussein, </p>

<p>an agenda would allow him to be seen to be making efforts to comply and therefore </p>
<p>to be co&#8209;operating with the UN; and that it would be difficult to act on a deadline </p>
<p>if Saddam Hussein was seen still to be co&#8209;operating.</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Sir Richard also wrote that there was ample evidence, including from Dr Blix, that </p>
<p>Iraq was not, and had no intention of, complying. Given the resources Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>had available to thwart inspections, and the scale of the task of uncovering something </p>
<p>“truly damning”, there was no guarantee that the inspections would produce conclusive </p>
<p>physical evidence.</p>
<p><b>562.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US would have difficulty with any </b></p>
<p><b>language which renegotiated resolution 1441 or changed the legal basis for the </b></p>
<p><b>use of force; and that there were difficulties in identifying concrete tests which </b></p>
<p><b>did not go beyond the resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>563.  Sir Jeremy questioned whether the material was available to convince </b></p>
<p><b>the majority of the Security Council that the end of the road had been reached.</b></p>
<p><b>564. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock discussed the way ahead with Dr Blix and, separately, </p>
<p>Ambassador Negroponte on 17 February, including informal ideas for an ultimatum.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p><b>565. </b> Sir Jeremy told Dr Blix that the UK remained committed to disarmament by </p>
<p>peaceful means and to a second resolution. But the UK “wanted to force the issue </p>
<p>in the next four weeks”; and that there might be less time if the US “baulked”.</p>
<p><b>566. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix had “noted that it was amazing that, in all their </p>
<p>inspections, UNMOVIC had found no WMD except the (empty) chemical warheads”. </p>
<p>Dr Blix had also commented that nothing had been found in the sites suggested by </p>
<p>the US: “If they had come close there would at least have been a denial of access.”</p>
<p><b>567. </b> In response, the UK had “underlined the sophistication of the Iraqi deception </p>
<p>regime – we were confident in our intelligence while some information, e.g. on BW </p>
<p>production, was corroborated by a variety of sources”; and that “given the Iraq deception </p>
<p>mechanism, the key thing was co&#8209;operation”.</p>
<p><b>568. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that Ambassador Negroponte “showed interest in an </p>
<p>ultimatum process with concrete tests”, but he foresaw problems with Washington. </p>
<p>The UK should not propose language which renegotiated 1441 or changed the legal </p>
<p>basis for the use of force.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It would be better if the benchmarks came from Dr Blix. The “key” would be “that </p>
<p>they forced either Iraq to reveal its lie or the Council to come to a conclusion that </p>
<p>Iraq was failing to co&#8209;operate”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US Mission still favoured a simple “serious consequences” resolution with </p>
<p>a vote by a certain date (or abandon the exercise altogether) if Iraq had not </p>
<p>radically changed its approach.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>570. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that he remained of the view that we should put forward a </p>
<p>resolution sooner rather than later to move the debate on. That could include a list of </p>
<p>benchmarks discussed with Dr Blix, but he could also see the attractions of tabling </p>
<p>a resolution now which simply called for disarmament, leaving Dr Blix or the middle&#8209;</p>
<p>ground members of the Council to seek to define concrete actions. That would tie the US </p>
<p>into the process. Delay risked appearing to be on the back foot, “uncertainty about our/</p>
<p>the Council’s intentions, perhaps reducing the likelihood that Iraq will realise the game </p>
<p>is up and surrender its WMD (or ditch Saddam)”.</p>
<p><b>571. </b> The telegram also made clear that Sir Jeremy had commented to Ambassador </p>
<p>Negroponte that “perhaps we just did not possess the material to convince others that </p>
<p>we were right to claim it was the end of the road”.</p>
<p><b>572.  The UK Mission in New York offered suggested elements for a resolution </b></p>

<p><b>573. </b> The UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York provided a paper overnight on </p>
<p>17/18 February setting out possible elements for a new ultimatum strategy.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> It pointed </p>
<p>out that resolution 1441 had used words like “active” and “unconditional” without defining </p>
<p>them, and referred to a “final opportunity” for “immediate” co&#8209;operation without specifying </p>
<p>how long that should take.</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Addressing whether co&#8209;operation had been immediate, the UK Mission stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“On the whole there has been great promptness of response”, and co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>on process had been “without delays or foot dragging”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Co&#8209;operation on substance could “hardly be said” to have been “active”, </p>
<p>although “a few recent measures” could be, “provided their potential usefulness </p>
<p>is borne out by real results”.</p>

<p>Iraq had appointed two Commissions, one to look for any remaining proscribed </p>
<p>items and one to look for any relevant documentation. A third Iraqi initiative had </p>
<p>been the provision of a list of personnel who had taken part in the destruction </p>
<p>of proscribed chemical items in 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi papers presented at the meeting in Baghdad on 8 to 9 February were </p>
<p>spontaneous and “focused on central issues, but without any new evidence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq claimed it was encouraging “persons to come for ‘private’ interviews </p>
<p>In Baghdad”, but there was doubt that they “really feel they can talk freely”. </p>
<p>Interviews outside Iraq were “certainly an option”, but raised “difficult issues”.</p>
<p><b>575. </b> The UK Mission asked:</p>
<p>“<b>If it seems clear that many governments feel that enough time has not yet </b></p>
<p><b>been given for the option of disarmament through inspection, how much </b></p>
<p><b>further time, would they ask for inspections </b>… before they give up on this option </p>
<p>and how ‘active’ should Iraq be required to be?</p>
<p>“It does not seem unreasonable to hold that <b>11 weeks of inspections</b>, which have </p>
<p>barely come up to full strength, and which come after a period of eight years of </p>
<p>inspections between 1991 and 1998 and four years of non&#8209;inspections between the </p>
<p>end of 1998 and November 2002, <b>is a rather short</b> period to allow a final conclusion </p>
<p>that the disarmament requirements cannot be fulfilled through this method. What is </p>
<p>clear … is that military and political pressure has been and remains indispensable </p>
<p>to bring about compliance. A slackening of it would, in all likelihood, result in </p>
<p>less co&#8209;operation.”</p>
<p><b>576. </b> The UK Mission proposed that, in the circumstances, an “<b>explicit time line</b> within </p>
<p>which satisfactory co&#8209;operation and the required resolution of unresolved disarmament </p>
<p>issues (or ‘key remaining disarmament tasks’) would be demanded”, would “not seem </p>
<p>unreasonable”. Addressing how long would be needed, it stated:</p>
<p>“Under resolution 1284 (1999) 120 days were thought to be a time frame within </p>
<p>which ‘progress’ on key remaining disarmament tasks would be. It is evidently </p>
<p>a question of <b>political judgement how much time should now be given under </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441 (2002)</b>. However, a time frame should not be set without any regard </p>
<p>to what may be achievable …”</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Addressing who would judge “<b>whether there has been co-operation and </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament</b>”, the UK Mission stated:</p>
<p>“In the last resort the Security Council must provide the answer, but it seems likely </p>
<p>that the Council would need to rely on a prior assessment by UNMOVIC and </p>
<p>the IAEA.”</p>
<p><b>578. </b> Both questions were “very broad” and judgements would be easier if there were </p>
<p>“some particular actions” or “benchmarks” which could be identified as “indispensable </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>but not conclusive”. Similarly, the extent of disarmament “could perhaps be judged </p>
<p>on the basis of progress noted on some key issues (as was specified in resolution </p>
<p>1284 (1999)) rather than the whole catalogue of issues”. Although some of the measures </p>
<p>required might not be possible, because of lack of documents or witnesses, “it would </p>
<p>probably be possible to see whether Iraq provided active, genuine co&#8209;operation to solve </p>
<p>the issues rather than dragging its feet and be evasive”.</p>
<p><b>579. </b> The UK Mission provided an illustrative text for a draft resolution, including a </p>
<p>request that UMOVIC and the IAEA submit a list of unresolved disarmament issues and </p>
<p>questions “by [1 March] … indicating which, in their view are key points, and what … </p>
<p>Iraq should do to solve these issues and to answer these questions”. The draft left open </p>
<p>the date by which UNMOVIC and the IAEA would be asked to submit a report with their </p>
<p>judgement on whether the issues and questions had been resolved and Iraq had fulfilled </p>
<p>its obligations.</p>

<p>“gone well” and that the “emphasis had been on the need for Saddam’s swift and </p>

<p>exhausted had been conceded albeit reluctantly in the usual quarters.”</p>
<p>158</p>

<p>and risks of setting rigorous benchmarks requiring total compliance to judge Saddam’s </p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p><b>583. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that Mr Blair’s preference was for a vote on 14 March. That:</p>
<p>“… had the advantage of playing to the date proposed by the French. But it also </p>
<p>gave us a precious extra few days to secure nine votes. In the end this was what it </p>

<p>“benchmarks” for co&#8209;operation by “filleting” Dr Blix’s paper. If the benchmarks were </p>
<p>set high and Saddam Hussein co&#8209;operated, the US and UK would have “won by a </p>
<p>different route”. Although Secretary Powell had reservations about including benchmarks </p>
<p>in a second resolution, they agreed that Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Ambassador </p>
<p>Negroponte should discuss a list with Dr Blix.</p>
<p><b>585. </b> In response to a request for advice in preparation for Mr Blair’s discussion with </p>
<p>President Bush, Sir David Manning wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair should seek to secure President Bush’s agreement to delay a vote </p>
<p>in the Security Council until 14/15 March to provide “a few, precious extra </p>
<p>days … [which] might make the difference to securing the critical nine votes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The second resolution should be “very simple, declaring Saddam in violation/</p>
<p>breach of [resolution] 1441 – without specifying what happens or when”. That </p>
<p>should be accompanied by tough tests “agreed with Blix if possible” which </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein would have to pass “in full”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David wrote that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein “almost certainly won’t comply. If he does, we’ve won anyway”; the </p>
<p>tests should “stick to what is stipulated in resolution 1441 and to the general </p>
<p>disarmament categories, otherwise Saddam will play games”; and that the UK </p>
<p>would be looking for “yes/no answers” from Dr Blix.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would also be a much better chance of gaining support for the resolution </p>
<p>if it was clear that the UN would have a “key role” after any military action </p>
<p>and that a “massive humanitarian aid programme” would be instituted; and </p>
<p>by publishing and implementing the Road Map on Israel/Palestine before </p>
<p>any military action.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David advised that both points would be a “tough sell” </p>
<p>with President Bush, but “both are very important in helping us to win the </p>
<p>argument”.</p>

<p><b>587. </b> Mr Ricketts wrote that Dr Blix had “spoken about selecting benchmarks from </p>

<p>1 March”.</p>
<p><b>588. </b> Mr Ricketts suggested the UK could propose its own benchmarks as a way </p>
<p>to get Dr Blix to focus quickly. The illustrative list covered biological weapons, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>589. </b> In his memoir, Dr Blix recorded that he had finalised his ideas about how </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s work on clusters might be used on 17 February, producing both a draft </p>
<p>resolution and a background paper which he gave to Sir Jeremy Greenstock.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy gave the documents to the Americans.</p>
<p><b>590. </b> Explaining his thinking that inspections offered Iraq “an opportunity that was not </p>
<p>open endlessly” and that it was “for the Council – but not individual members of it – </p>
<p>to consider and decide on the alternative to inspections”, Dr Blix wrote that military </p>
<p>pressure “was and remained indispensable to bringing about Iraqi compliance” but:</p>
<p>“… many delegations felt that not enough time had yet been given to inspections; </p>
<p>eleven weeks was rather a short time to allow the final conclusion that disarmament </p>
<p>could not be achieved through the inspection path and would have to be abandoned. </p>
<p>It would not seem unreasonable … to set ‘an explicit time line’ within which </p>
<p>satisfactory co&#8209;operation and resolution of unresolved disarmament issues and key </p>
<p>remaining disarmament tasks would be demanded. It was a political judgement … </p>
<p>to decide how much time would be given.</p>
<p>“It would be for the Security Council to judge – after a report by the inspectors – </p>
<p>whether there had been adequate co&#8209;operation and resulting disarmament …</p>
<p>“My draft requested that UNMOVIC/IAEA submit by 1 March a list of ‘key points’ </p>
<p>… along with indications of what Iraq should do to resolve them (the benchmarks). </p>
<p>It further spelled out a number of demands for Iraqi actions … It requested </p>
<p>UNMOVIC/IAEA to report to the Council before a specific date … whether Iraq had </p>
<p>done what was asked of it. Lastly, it stipulated that if the Security Council were to </p>
<p>conclude that Iraq had not fulfilled what was demanded and thus had ‘not made </p>
<p>use of the inspection process,’ the inspections would be terminated and the </p>
<p>Council would ‘consider other measures to solve the disarmament issue’.”</p>
<p><b>591.  Sir Christopher Meyer advised that there was no agreed position within the </b></p>
<p><b>US Administration about how to work on a second resolution and UK views were </b></p>

<p><b>592. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer advised that the US Administration was still debating the </p>

<p>position on how best to work with Dr Blix on a second resolution.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>593. </b> There was concern about Dr Blix’s reluctance to press Iraq on mobile biological </p>
<p>weapons facilities, because the “knowledge” of those facilities came from intelligence, </p>
<p>which “appeared to put the onus on the US/UK to prove these existed rather than on </p>
<p>Iraq to reassure the Council that they did not”; and that he might have lost sight of the </p>
<p>fact that Iraq’s co&#8209;operation on process was not synonymous with disarmament.</p>

<p><b>599. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush a six&#8209;page Note on 19 February.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Mr Blair stated that it was “a defining moment in EU/US relations and in </p>
<p>the future direction of Europe”. He wrote that it was “apparent to me from the EU </p>
<p>summit that France wants to make this a crucial test: is Europe America’s partner </p>
<p>or competitor? … For the first time … a strong bloc prepared to challenge France </p>
<p>and Germany” was emerging.</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Blair wrote that “European public opinion seemed to favour France” and </p>
<p>that was being used “to embarrass the pro&#8209;US case, to inhibit the pro&#8209;US leaders”. </p>
<p>Those leaders had been:</p>
<p>“… remarkably firm in the face of really difficult polls and demonstrations.</p>
<p>“But the issue will be this: is it the US that is forced to go it alone with the UK, </p>
<p>or is it France that is left isolated with a choice as to whether to use its veto?</p>
<p>“That is in turn a function of where public opinion is outside … the US.”</p>
<p><b>602. </b> Mr Blair added that was “far more nuanced than people think”. In his view, public </p>
<p>opinion outside the US was:</p>
<p>“… not against conflict in all circumstances. What they fear is that we are hell bent </p>
<p>on war, come what may, that we don’t really want the UN to succeed.”</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Blair wrote that fear was “absurd”:</p>
<p>“The issue of time for the inspections has become vicariously, the focus for </p>
<p>this sentiment. At the heart of this is a confusion between active and passive </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation. The duty on Saddam is to co&#8209;operate fully; ie actively to help the </p>
<p>Inspectors. If he isn’t he’s in breach. But the France/Germany view – too much </p>
<p>shared by others on the Security Council – is that the inspectors should have </p>

<p>288</p>
<p>the time they need to “sniff out” the weapons … and all Saddam needs to do is to </p>
<p>offer passive co&#8209;operation, ie the absence of obstruction. Obviously if this is right, </p>
<p>they could be there for months or years.”</p>
<p><b>604. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Our view, which is correct is that time is irrelevant unless he [Saddam] is </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating fully and actively. If he isn’t, the time needed is just the time necessary </p>
<p>to make a judgement as to his co&#8209;operation: is it full or not? And actually, no one … </p>
<p>is seriously suggesting Saddam is co&#8209;operating fully.”</p>
<p><b>605. </b> Mr Blair wrote that Dr Blix “unfortunately” embodied that confusion. His report </p>
<p>to the Security Council on 14 February “never suggested there was full co&#8209;operation; </p>
<p>indeed the opposite”. But the tone “seemed to imply that because Saddam was </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating more on process, that was an improvement despite the fact that there </p>
<p>was no co&#8209;operation on substance”.</p>
<p><b>606. </b> Mr Blair reported that recent conversations with Dr Blix showed that he was “aware </p>
<p>of this problem, and is prepared to countenance a definitive judgement and was shocked </p>
<p>at how negatively for the US/UK his report was spun”. Mr Blair added: “My faith in Blix </p>
<p>is somewhat shaken. But he remains key.”</p>
<p><b>607. </b> Mr Blair suggested:</p>
<p>“… the trick we need to take is this: we have to find a way of re&#8209;focusing the issue </p>
<p>on the absence of full co&#8209;operation … and do so in a way that pulls public opinion </p>
<p>and the UNSC waverers back to us by showing that we have indeed made every </p>
<p>effort to avoid war.”</p>
<p><b>608. </b> Mr Blair proposed that the US and UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Put down a new resolution “soon, probably early next week”. That resolution </p>
<p>would be “simple and clear and as easy to vote for as we can make it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Put the resolution “to a vote on 14 March, the date France has suggested </p>
<p>for a [Security Council] meeting of Foreign Ministers”. That would then become </p>
<p>“the deadline for action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“At the same time” the resolution was tabled, there would be a side statement </p>
<p>defining the categories of full co&#8209;operation: “full disclosure of the 1998 leftovers; </p>
<p>witnesses interviewed outside Iraq; destruction of the rocket motors etc”. That </p>
<p>should be “sufficient if he did it, to amount to a complete and total capitulation </p>
<p>by Saddam”. That was “the ultimatum”.</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Mr Blair wrote that he would be speaking to Dr Blix the following day to try to “tie” </p>
<p>him in “to accept this is indeed what must happen”.</p>

<p>289</p>
<p><b>610. </b> Mr Blair continued that the UK and US should say that:</p>
<p>“… failure in any respect to meet this test, will amount to non&#8209;co&#8209;operation; that </p>
<p>this is a final attempt by us to disarm Saddam peacefully; that by 14 March it will </p>
<p>be 4 months since 1441, quite long enough to assess whether he is co&#8209;operating </p>
<p>or not.</p>
<p>“We work like crazy next week to get the UNSC members to agree or at least not </p>
<p>oppose this strategy; and then build the support to carry a majority for 14 March.”</p>
<p><b>611. </b> Mr Blair recognised that there were both advantages and disadvantages in his </p>
<p>proposed approach. The disadvantages were identified as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risk that Saddam Hussein “might conceivably comply fully – but the chances </p>
<p>of this, according to all the intelligence are minimal”. If he did comply, “it would </p>
<p>still amount to a huge humiliation [to Saddam Hussein]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might “seem” to comply but that was “a risk in any event and </p>
<p>by defining non&#8209;compliance so clearly” the “chances of ambiguity” would be </p>
<p>minimised.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The start of military action might be delayed by a week: “But this is not long and </p>
<p>the blunt truth is that by next Friday i.e. 28 February or even a week later … the </p>
<p>chances of securing nine votes are very slim. A week’s wait is worth a resolution; </p>
<p>or at least a majority on the UNSC.”</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Mr Blair saw the advantages as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>putting the US and UK “back in the driving seat, with a clear deadline and </p>
<p>ultimatum”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re&#8209;focusing the “debate where it should be” on Iraq’s duty “fully to co&#8209;operate”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>giving the “doubters a reason to sign up”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping “the Arab world come on board”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accepting the French date;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allowing the US and UK to “show the world we are going to war, not because </p>
<p>we want to, but because we have to”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Above all”:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>show “the US reaching out”;</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>“A successful second resolution would be an enormous success for your diplomacy </p>
<p>over the last few months.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>“I have never come across an issue in which the dividing line between overwhelming </p>
<p>support and overwhelming opposition is so slender.”</p>
<p><b>614. </b> Mr Blair added that, in the UK, which was “reasonably typical of European opinion”, </p>
<p>“large majorities” believed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “a threat and needs disarming”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“without the threat of action, he wouldn’t disarm”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“in military action if there is a new UN resolution or even without a resolution if </p>
<p>we had a majority of the UNSC … ie France would veto and we could still do it.”</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Mr Blair wrote: “Around 80 percent” in the UK supported an ultimatum and </p>
<p>acknowledged that inspections could only work if Saddam co&#8209;operated. Yet a majority </p>
<p>opposed action at that time. The “only explanation” was that:</p>
<p>“… they needed to be persuaded that the US and UK would prefer peaceful </p>
<p>disarmament if that were possible. Proving it isn’t possible is the huge benefit </p>
<p>of the ultimatum route.”</p>
<p><b>616. </b> Finally, Mr Blair offered “two further thoughts”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Publishing the MEPP Road Map would have a massive impact in Europe </p>
<p>and the Arab world.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “need to start firming up the humanitarian work for the aftermath </p>
<p>of the conflict … and show how we will protect and improve the lives of </p>
<p>Iraqi people.”</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the Note had set out the basic strategy: “that we put down </p>
<p>a UNSCR, not to push to a vote, instead use it like an ultimatum, give him two weeks </p>
<p>or so to take us to the French date of 14 March.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>618. </b> In their discussion at lunchtime on 19 February, Mr Straw and Secretary Powell </p>
<p>discussed the fact that Dr Blix was “not yet ready to say that Iraq was not co&#8209;operating </p>
<p>on substance” and the difficulties of agreeing a list of tests with him that “set the bar </p>
<p>satisfactorily high”.</p>

<p>discussed the text of the resolution, benchmarks and a possible ultimatum to Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein telling him to leave. Mr Straw commended Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s language </p>

<p><b>626. </b> Mr Blair repeated the arguments that the resolution and ultimatum route would help </p>
<p>to demonstrate that the US and UK did not want war but were prepared to use force if </p>
<p>that was the only way to disarm Saddam Hussein. Addressing the question of whether </p>
<p>disarmament should be defined for Dr Blix and if identifying tasks for Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would allow Saddam Hussein to do some and try to show he was co&#8209;operating, Mr Blair </p>

<p><b>631. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that, in his Note of 19 February, Mr Blair had </p>
<p>“urged that we forge ahead” and that he had written: “The stakes are now much higher”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair had also written that it was “apparent” to him “from the EU Summit that France </p>
<p>wants to make this a crucial test: Is Europe America’s partner or competitor?”, and that </p>
<p>there was support for the US from a strong European coalition.</p>

<p>to “fully utilize the inspection mechanisms of resolution 1441”.</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that the United States had transformed a “technical and </p>

<p>since the withdrawal of inspectors in 1998, there had been “no proof” that Iraq had rid </p>
<p>itself of WMD. There were reasons to believe the opposite was the case. Recent Iraqi </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation had only come in response to intense international pressure. More time </p>
<p>for inspectors could be useful, but only if Iraq decided to co&#8209;operate “fully, actively and </p>

<p><b>Deployment of South African scientists to Baghdad</b></p>
<p>When Mr Blair met Mr Thabo Mbeki, the South African President, at Chequers </p>
<p>on 1 February, they had three hours of private talks.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>On Iraq, the readout from the discussions was that Mr Blair had “debriefed” Mr Mbeki </p>
<p>on his talks with Washington and set out the UK position “in normal terms”. Mr Mbeki told </p>
<p>Mr Blair that Mr Tariq Aziz, the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, “had asked South Africa to </p>
<p>send a team to Iraq to advise on how disarmament should be done”. Mr Blair “commented </p>
<p>that there was not much doubt about what Iraq should do”.</p>
<p>Mr Aziz Pahad, the South African Deputy Foreign Minister, told the British High </p>
<p>Commission that, following his visit to Baghdad from 9 to 13 February, where he had had </p>
<p>meetings with Saddam Hussein, Mr Tariq Aziz and others, South Africa would be sending </p>
<p>a team of apartheid&#8209;era scientists to advise Iraq on disarmament.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>Mr Pahad said that he had delivered the message that Iraq must comply fully with </p>
<p>resolution 1441, and the time for compliance was running out. Subsequently he added </p>
<p>that he had urged full rather than partial co&#8209;operation; this was “an all or nothing” decision.</p>
<p>Mr Pahad’s assessment was reported to be that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi attitudes were slowly shifting;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the inspectors to whom he had spoken had noticed and reported this mood </p>
<p>change;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those in favour of co&#8209;operation might be “winning out”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the resolution of the U2 over flights issue was “major progress”.</p>
<p>Mr Pahad said South Africa’s objective was to prevent war by ensuring the success of </p>
<p>weapons inspections. A team of experts would be sent to Iraq “imminently”. They would </p>
<p>not have direct contact with the UN inspectors, “but would be proactive in helping Iraq </p>
<p>to co&#8209;operate and demonstrate this co&#8209;operation”.</p>

<p>Mr Pahad added that the initiative gave Iraq “the possibility of a face&#8209;saving climb&#8209;down … </p>
<p>if Saddam seriously rushed to comply”.</p>
<p>The British High Commission commented that Mr Pahad was “cautiously optimistic that </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s conversation with Dr Blix, 20 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>638.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Dr Blix that the Security Council had to realise </b></p>
<p><b>that if it was not willing to authorise force if Iraq did not disarm, the issue would </b></p>
<p><b>be taken out of its hands.</b></p>
<p><b>639. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told Dr Blix on 19 February that the UK was likely to go </p>
<p>for an approach “signalling the end game on Iraq”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> The UK “would say that the Council </p>
<p>had to realise that this would be out of the hands of the UN unless it decided that Iraq </p>
<p>had to start the process of real disarmament and was willing to authorise force if it did </p>
<p>not”. The UK “still hoped to avert the use of force – but we had to be realistic”.</p>
<p><b>640. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Dr Blix was not averse to a deadline but 15 March was </p>
<p>“not theoretically doable”. He concluded that the “Blix benchmark possibilities” had been </p>
<p>“tested” and “set aside as too risky”.</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that Dr Blix had said he would issue a decision on </p>
<p>missiles to Iraq within 24 hours; and that UNMOVIC had “just received an ‘amazingly’ </p>
<p>detailed document on the persons involved in the destruction of biological weapons </p>
<p>which could be significant”. The meeting of the College of Commissioners for UNMOVIC </p>
<p>on 24 and 25 February would discuss the “clusters” document. Dr Blix expected it to be </p>
<p>finalised by 3 March, but he did not intend to submit it to the Security Council; it “was </p>
<p>an exercise to help UNMOVIC define the key remaining disarmament tasks due under </p>
<p>1284 – but would do so if asked”.</p>
<p><b>642. </b> Sir Jeremy commented that the UK was “likely to say that, if Iraq did not rapidly </p>
<p>demonstrate it was engaging in voluntary disarmament, this document was academic”.</p>
<p><b>643.  Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he wanted to offer the US an alternative strategy </b></p>
<p><b>which included a deadline and tests for compliance. He did not think Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>would co-operate but he would try to get Dr Blix as much time as possible.</b></p>
<p><b>644.  Dr Blix stated that full co-operation was a nebulous concept; and a deadline </b></p>

<p>295</p>
<p><b>646. </b> The record of the discussion stated that Mr Blair referred to US disappointment </p>
<p>with Dr Blix’s report of 14 February and that it was “now difficult to dissuade the </p>
<p>Americans from going down the military route”. Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he was </p>
<p>concerned about the risk of the UN being marginalised and of a split in the international </p>
<p>community; and that he wanted to offer the US “an alternative strategy”.</p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Blair outlined the need to devise an ultimatum including a deadline and </p>
<p>imposing a duty on Saddam Hussein to co&#8209;operate actively; and that failure to do </p>
<p>so would be a breach of resolution 1441. That would accompany a “simple” resolution </p>
<p>that would be Saddam Hussein’s “final final” warning. There were “some indications” </p>
<p>that, with a second resolution, “the Arabs might be able to lever Saddam out of power”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair added that co&#8209;operation would need to be defined and Saddam Hussein would </p>
<p>need to comply in full.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Dr Blix was attracted by timelines but commented that “full co&#8209;operation was </p>
<p>a nebulous concept”. Later he stated that demands for co&#8209;operation had to be related </p>
<p>to what was “realistically do&#8209;able”.</p>
<p><b>649. </b> Dr Blix told Mr Blair that the UN should have a catalogue of the action required on </p>
<p>disarmament by the end of the following week. He should be able to share the “clusters” </p>
<p>of unanswered questions with the UNMOVIC College of Commissioners by 24 February. </p>
<p>The intelligence he had received was “not all that compelling”. While he still tended to </p>
<p>think that Iraq was concealing some WMD, he needed evidence to put to the Security </p>
<p>Council. He was receiving “a flow of half promises” on Iraqi co&#8209;operation and needed </p>
<p>more time.</p>
<p><b>650. </b> Mr Blair said that the Iraqis could have signalled a change of heart in the </p>
<p>December declaration. The Americans did not think that Saddam Hussein was going </p>
<p>to co&#8209;operate: “Nor did he. But we needed to keep the international community together.”</p>
<p><b>651. </b> Dr Blix suggested that “key disarmament tasks” could be selected from resolution </p>
<p>1284 as it would be easier to judge compliance on those. They discussed the difficulties </p>
<p>with interviewing Iraqis, which Dr Blix said he would be working on the following week. </p>
<p>It was important to keep the pressure on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>652. </b> Dr Blix confirmed that he had suggested a deadline of 15 April to the US, which </p>
<p>they thought was too late. He thought it was too early. The threat of war was making </p>
<p>it difficult to recruit and retain inspectors.</p>
<p><b>653. </b> Mr Blair told Dr Blix that he would pursue the ultimatum route and try to get </p>
<p>Dr Blix as much time as possible.</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Dr Blix commented that “perhaps there was not much WMD in Iraq after all”. </p>
<p>Mr Blair responded that “even German and French intelligence were sure that there was </p>
<p>WMD in Iraq”. Dr Blix said they seemed “unsure” about mobile BW production facilities: </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>“It would be paradoxical and absurd if 250,000 men were to invade Iraq and find </p>
<p>very little.”</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Mr Blair responded: “our intelligence was clear that Saddam had reconstituted </p>
<p>his WMD programme”.</p>
<p><b>656. </b> The record stated that Dr Blix had “concluded that he accepted the need </p>
<p>for timelines and benchmarks”.</p>
<p><b>657. </b> In his account of the conversation, Dr Blix wrote that he had said:</p>
<p>“Only at three sites to which we had gone on the basis of intelligence had there been </p>
<p>any result at all.</p>
<p>“Personally I tended to think that Iraq still concealed weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>but I needed evidence. Perhaps there were not many such weapons in Iraq </p>
<p>after all.”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>658. </b> After the conversation between Mr Blair and Dr Blix, Sir David Manning told </p>
<p>Dr Rice that while Dr Blix had understood the key point that Iraq was not co&#8209;operating </p>
<p>fully with the UN, it was “equally clear that he was not ready to say so to the Security </p>
<p>Council”.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> The need was therefore to keep him focused on this question of co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>and “persuade him that the logic of the situation was that we should now issue an </p>
<p>ultimatum”. Dr Blix would need to decide whether “he was going to be a party to the </p>
<p>pretence that Iraq was co&#8209;operating with the UN system when, in fact, Saddam’s </p>
<p>defiance risked wrecking it”.</p>
<p><b>659. </b> Sir David also recorded US/UK agreement to table a second resolution </p>
<p>on 24 February and the UK’s preference for the “very light” resolution proposed </p>
<p>by Sir Jeremy Greenstock. There would be a need to prepare the launch carefully </p>
<p>with members of the E10 and potential allies in the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Asked about his response to Dr Blix’s comment about the implications of invading </p>
<p>Iraq and finding “very little”, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that he had told Dr Blix: “What you </p>
<p>have to tell us is … whether he is complying with the resolution. Is he giving immediate </p>
<p>compliance and full compliance or not?” Dr Blix’s answer was: “No, but, you never know, </p>
<p>it may be that, if we are given more time, he will.”</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>661. </b> Mr Blair added that the conversation had led to him working with Dr Blix “to try and </p>
<p>get a fresh … resolution. I kept working on that right up until the last moment.”</p>

<p>SIS had sent messages to its best placed sources “emphasising the utmost importance </p>

<p><b>663. </b> An internal FCO minute of the Iraq morning meeting on 20 February recorded that </p>
<p>the UK was “now moving away from the idea of benchmarks from Dr Blix, given US </p>

<p>the validity of proceeding with work against the SCR 1284 timetable in present </p>
<p>circumstances. That is not to say that we regard … 1284 as invalid. But it must now </p>
<p>be viewed in the light of SCR 1441, which requires Iraq to co&#8209;operate ‘immediately, </p>

<p><b>666. </b> The FCO also wrote that it realised the position might “annoy” Dr Blix, and UKMIS </p>

<p><b>Agreement on the text of a second resolution</b></p>
<p><b>668.  Mr Straw and Secretary Powell reached agreement on the text of the draft </b></p>
<p><b>resolution on 20 February.</b></p>
<p><b>669. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock gave Ambassador Negroponte a revised “light draft </p>
<p>resolution” on 19 February which:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>noted (draft preambular paragraph 5) that Iraq had “submitted a declaration … </p>
<p>containing false statements and omissions and has failed to comply with and </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate fully in the implementation of that resolution [1441]”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decided (draft OP1) that Iraq had “failed to take the final opportunity afforded </p>
<p>to it in resolution 1441 (2002)”.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p><b>670. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Ambassador Negroponte that the draft “was </p>
<p>thin on anything with which Council members could argue and would be less frightening </p>
<p>to the middle ground”. It did not refer to “serious consequences” and that “instead of </p>
<p>relying on OP4 of 1441”, the draft resolution “relied on OP1 of 1441, re&#8209;establishing the </p>
<p>material breach suspended in OP2”.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Sir Jeremy added that issuing the draft would signal the intent to move to a final </p>
<p>debate, which they should seek to focus “not on individual elements of co&#8209;operation but </p>
<p>on the failure by Iraq to voluntarily disarm” and being “thrown off course by individual </p>
<p>benchmarks or judgement by Blix”. It should be accompanied by a “powerful statement </p>
<p>about what 1441 had asked for” which had “been twisted into partial, procedural, </p>
<p>and grudging co&#8209;operation from Iraq”; and that “substantive, active and voluntary </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation was not happening”.</p>
<p><b>672. </b> In response to a question from the US about whether the “central premise”,  </p>
<p>that the final opportunity was “now over”, would be disputed, Sir Jeremy said that:  </p>
<p>“was where we would have to define our terms carefully: voluntary disarmament  </p>
<p>was not happening.”</p>
<p><b>673. </b> The US and UK agreed they should co&#8209;sponsor the resolution with Spain and that </p>
<p>the UK would “lead in explaining it to the Council”.</p>
<p><b>674. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s response to Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s rationale for the second </p>
<p>resolution is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>675. </b> Mr Straw had two conversations with Secretary Powell on 20 February. In the </p>
<p>first, they discussed UK and US drafts for a second resolution. Mr Straw said that he </p>
<p>had “no firm view about which one was best”.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s view was </p>
<p>that the lighter the language the more likely the UK was to attract the support needed </p>

<p>from “swing countries”. Mr Blair wanted a report to the Council on 7 March but there </p>
<p>were indications that Dr Blix might want longer. If a majority in the Security Council </p>
<p>supported more time, Mr Blair would be in “a very difficult position”. Mr Straw told </p>
<p>Secretary Powell that an agreed strategy was needed, including tabling a side document </p>
<p>with the resolution “containing our list of demands”.</p>
<p><b>676. </b> Concluding the conversation, Mr Straw stated that if “extraordinarily Iraq complied, </p>
<p>the UK could not go to war”. Secretary Powell was reported to have replied that “in </p>
<p>the end, there was only one difference between us: President Bush had already made </p>
<p>his decision”. If Mr Blair’s “efforts did not permit the UK to be there, Bush would still </p>
<p>go alone”.</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Following the first conversation with Secretary Powell, Mr Ricketts advised </p>
<p>Mr Straw that the US draft would be “much more difficult for middle ground opinion” </p>
<p>to accept.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> Mr Ricketts wrote that it was the UK, not the Americans, which needed </p>
<p>the resolution; and that the Greenstock text delivered what the UK needed and would </p>
<p>be more difficult to oppose. It was “more compatible with building a case in the </p>
<p>Security Council that the issue is a simple one of whether or not Iraq is in compliance”.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Mr Ricketts advised Mr Straw to go back to Secretary Powell to press the UK view.</p>
<p><b>679. </b> Mr Ricketts suggested that the UK might also “move away from the concept of </p>
<p>tabling lists of benchmarks”. He wrote that the work with the US delegation in New York </p>
<p>had “shown up how difficult it is to isolate questions which are susceptible [to] yes/no </p>
<p>answers in the time&#8209;frame we need”; and that there was a risk that it would “play into </p>
<p>the hands of the ‘more time’ merchants”. Mr Ricketts suggested that it might be better to </p>
<p>draw on the work that had been done to “set out in a co&#8209;ordinated way some illustrative </p>
<p>tests such as the destruction of rocket motors or producing specified people for interview </p>
<p>in acceptable conditions”.</p>
<p><b>680. </b> Mr Ricketts concluded that would be “more compatible with the approach in the </p>
<p>Jeremy Greenstock draft resolution of making our case on the basis of whether Iraq was </p>
<p>in full co&#8209;operation or not”.</p>
<p><b>681. </b> In his second conversation with Secretary Powell on 20 February, Mr Straw stated </p>
<p>that the UK Government “was signed up to the Greenstock language. If countries voted </p>
<p>for that … they would … be voting to let us go to war.”</p>
<p>189</p>
<p><b>682. </b> In response to questioning from Secretary Powell about whether he was sure that </p>
<p>was the right call, Mr Straw said that “we were sure that the Greenstock language would </p>
<p>do the trick”.</p>

<p>up for a major lobbying exercise.</p>

<p><b>684. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, Mr Berlusconi and Mr Aznar about tabling </p>

<p>and External Relations Council of the EU.</p>

<p><b>686.  In response to the level of concern in the UK, Mr Blair asked for a </b></p>
<p><b>communications strategy based on the theme of a “last push for peace”.</b></p>
<p><b>687. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that, on the morning of 20 February, Mr Blair “was getting more </p>
<p>and more worried about Iraq, and with good reason”. He had asked for a strategy on the </p>
<p>theme of “the last push for peace”, with a strong media plan to underpin it. Mr Campbell </p>
<p>had emphasised the need for a sense that “we were trying to avoid war, not rush </p>
<p>towards it.</p>

<p><b>688. </b> Dr Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Cardinal Cormac Murphy </p>

<p>“the crisis involving Iraq”.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> Recognising the “huge burden of responsibility carried by </p>
<p>those who must make the ultimate decision”, the statement said:</p>
<p>“The events of recent days show that doubts still persist about the moral legitimacy </p>
<p>as well as the unpredictable humanitarian consequences of a war with Iraq.</p>
<p>“We recognise that the moral alternative to military action cannot be inaction … </p>
<p>It is vital therefore that all sides … engage through the United Nations fully and </p>
<p>urgently in a process, including continued weapons inspections, that could and </p>
<p>should render the trauma and tragedy of war unnecessary.</p>
<p>“We strongly urge the Government of Iraq to demonstrate forthwith its unequivocal </p>
<p>compliance with UN resolutions on weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>“… We must hope and pray … an outcome that brings peace with justice to Iraq </p>
<p>and the Middle East may yet be found.”</p>

<p>301</p>
<p><b>689. </b> In a speech on reintegrating Iraq into the international community at Chatham </p>
<p>House on 21 February, Mr Straw focused on the threat which Saddam Hussein posed </p>
<p>to the people of Iraq and the moral case for action.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Straw stated that there was international unity about the objective of disarming </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein who posed “a unique threat to international peace and security”. </p>
<p>But “with each passing year” of Iraq’s defiance, there had “been a growing awareness </p>
<p>of the immense consequences of a failure to match our words with actions”, and:</p>
<p>“The stakes could not be higher. If the UN proves unable to act on the spirit and </p>
<p>the letter of mandatory Chapter VII resolutions when faced with the most egregious </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance it risks joining its predecessor, the League of Nations, as a footnote </p>
<p>in history.”</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Mr Straw said that, without military pressure on Iraq, there would be “no </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation; no inspections”. Mr Straw also stated that the threat of military action </p>
<p>was “and always has been, about pressuring Saddam Hussein to comply with </p>
<p>resolution 1441”.</p>
<p><b>692. </b> In preparation for visits to key capitals to pursue support for the UK’s position, </p>
<p>Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, informed Sir David Manning that a script </p>
<p>was being prepared which would:</p>
<p>“… briefly summarise evidence and judgements on Saddam’s WMD, describe the </p>
<p>effect of some of the agents; set out the Iraqi response to UNSCR 1441, including </p>
<p>the flaws in the 7 December declaration; and cover what we know of concealment, </p>
<p>intimidation of witnesses and other aspects of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation. It will also provide </p>
<p>supporting material on Saddam’s regime and – briefly – on links with terrorism. </p>
<p>We will update the pack as new material becomes available.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that, during a briefing for E10 representatives </p>
<p>in New York on 21 February, he had made clear that the UK viewed war as a last </p>
<p>resort, but the objective of disarming Iraq had to be achieved and the threat could not </p>
<p>be allowed to continue for much longer. Verified disarmament had not happened; and </p>
<p>no&#8209;one had explained how inspections could work without Iraq’s co&#8209;operation. The UK </p>
<p>supported the UN as a relevant international body, and did not favour unilateral action. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy stated:</p>
<p>“We had to factor in the US determination to deal with Iraq … [The UK was] </p>
<p>prepared to work with the E10 members to achieve a unified Council keeping the </p>
<p>pressure on Saddam and perhaps allowing him to crack.”</p>

<p>302</p>
<p><b>694. </b> The UK strategy was set out in a telegram from Mr Ricketts to diplomatic posts </p>
<p>on the evening of 21 February.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> The key points were:</p>
<p>“The present plan is to table a simple draft resolution in the Security Council, </p>
<p>probably on 24 February. This would provide the … legal authority for military action </p>
<p>if necessary. We would make clear that it was part of a strategy to give Iraq another </p>
<p>short period in which to demonstrate finally and fully whether it was co&#8209;operating in </p>
<p>order to achieve voluntary disarmament of its WMD. We would … not be seeking a </p>
<p>vote … for another two weeks or so, but were not prepared for the process to string </p>
<p>out in the absence of a clear will by Iraq to comply with 1441.</p>
<p>“… we would expect several further rounds of discussion in the Security Council </p>
<p>… culminating in a report by the inspectors to a meeting on or around 7 March, </p>
<p>probably attended by Foreign Ministers.”</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Mr Ricketts advised that there would be an intensive lobbying campaign of the </p>
<p>elected members of the Security Council with a “good deal of travel by Ministers”. </p>
<p>The campaign would be co&#8209;ordinated with the US and Spain. The FCO would be setting </p>
<p>up a system to “provide an up&#8209;date at least twice a week while the crisis remains at its </p>
<p>present pitch”, and was producing a daily “core script” for media purposes.</p>
<p><b>696. </b> In a letter to Mr Campbell about statements over the weekend of 22 and </p>
<p>23 February, Mr Straw advised against any reference to either an “ultimatum” or to </p>
<p>“benchmarks”.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> Mr Straw explained that the US was hostile to the use of the former </p>
<p>term because “it would cut across a real ultimatum which President Bush had in mind </p>
<p>to issue at about the time the resolution was voted – to Saddam to ‘get out of town’”.</p>
<p><b>697. </b> On benchmarks, there was:</p>
<p>“… a trap here for us to avoid. If we are too specific about how we judge Saddam’s </p>
<p>compliance, we set ourselves up as a target, both from Saddam but also from Blix. </p>
<p>Saddam will know what he appears to have to do to get ticks in the right boxes. </p>
<p>Judging from the Prime Minister’s conversation with Blix yesterday, I think Blix is </p>
<p>also in the mood to say if he possibly can that Iraq has passed any benchmarks </p>
<p>that we offer. Most of the members of the Security Council will look to Blix for </p>
<p>their judgement.”</p>
<p><b>698. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell wrote that, on 21 February, Mr Blair, who was on his </p>
<p>way to Rome, had called him to say that “everything now had to be set in the context </p>
<p>of pushing for peace, that we wanted to resolve it peacefully”. Mr Campbell had worked </p>
<p>with the White House on a briefing note. Mr Blair and Mr Straw had been happy to </p>
<p>include a reference to an ultimatum until Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell “who </p>

<p>out of town”.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>699. </b> In his press conference with Mr Berlusconi on 21 February, Mr Blair warned that </p>
<p>military action on Iraq could not be avoided unless Saddam Hussein chose “the route of </p>
<p>peaceful disarmament”.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> Mr Blair emphasised that no one wanted war. That was why:</p>
<p>“… last summer, instead of starting a war, we went to the UN …</p>
<p>“But there is a moral dimension to this question too. If we fail to disarm Saddam </p>
<p>peacefully, then where does that leave the authority of the UN?</p>
<p>“And if we leave Saddam in charge of Iraq with his weapons of mass destruction, </p>
<p>where does that leave the Iraqi people who are the principal victims of Saddam?”</p>
<p><b>700. </b> Asked about the opposition to conflict expressed by church leaders, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t pretend to have a monopoly of wisdom … and I totally understand why </p>
<p>people don’t want war …</p>
<p>“That’s the very reason why we have given every single opportunity for this </p>
<p>to be resolved peacefully. All I ask people to do is understand that however </p>
<p>sincerely they hold their view, I hold my view sincerely too. And there is another </p>
<p>side to this argument.</p>
<p>“I understand exactly why people feel so strongly, but in the end, I have got to make </p>
<p>a decision and that’s the difference between leadership and commentary.</p>
<p>“I have got to make a decision. If we cannot disarm him peacefully, are we just going </p>
<p>to ignore the issue and hope it will go away?”</p>
<p><b>701. </b> Late that evening, there was a conference call, including Dr Rice,  </p>
<p>Mr Stephen Hadley (US Deputy National Security Advisor), Sir David Manning and </p>
<p>Mr Powell as well as Mr Campbell.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> The US was worried about the text, which </p>
<p>included “a side statement directly challenging Saddam”. In his diaries, Mr Campbell </p>
<p>wrote that Dr Rice:</p>
<p>“… feared that setting it out as a final chance – again – or a challenge to Saddam, </p>
<p>suggested there was something here beyond 1441. She said 1441 was all that we </p>
<p>needed. We tried to use the call to get over the need for a different sort of language </p>
<p>on this, but they really didn’t get it.”</p>

<p>“… were not really in the same place. I could sense that Condi thought we were </p>

<p><b>703. </b> Mr Campbell told Dr Rice that she had to understand “we were hit hard here </p>

<p><b>704. </b> On 23 February, Mr Blair spoke to President Putin who was prepared to work  </p>
<p>on a second resolution which put tougher requirements on Saddam Hussein, but </p>
<p>President Putin did not think it should provide an automatic start to hostilities.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>705. </b> Mr Blair also spoke to Mr Vicente Fox, the Mexican President,</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> and  </p>
<p>Mr Ricardo Lagos, the Chilean President.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>706. </b> Mr Straw and Sir David Manning also made a number of telephone calls.</p>

<p>206</p>
<p><b>708. </b> On 24 February, Mr Campbell wrote that “Iraq was totally dominating” and he had </p>
<p>suggested in Mr Blair’s morning meeting that “something concrete, like signs of Arab </p>
<p>pressure, or a new diplomatic effort that meant something” was “needed to add some </p>
<p>substance to the ‘last push for peace’, which at the moment just sounded vacuous”.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair “said the last push WAS the pressure being applied, or the pressure was the last </p>
<p>push”, which Mr Campbell “still felt looked like we were trying to meet a US timetable, </p>
<p>not genuinely trying to avoid war. But all the US politicians did was communicate an </p>

<p><b>710.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that resolution 1441 required Iraq “visibly </b></p>
<p><b>and unmistakably to divest itself of weapons of mass destruction immediately, </b></p>
<p><b>unconditionally and actively”; that had not happened and the US and UK had </b></p>
<p><b>concluded that Iraq had decided to defy the international community.</b></p>
<p><b>711. </b> A meeting of the Security Council was held on 24 February at the request </p>
<p>of the UK.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>712. </b> A draft of a second resolution was tabled by the UK, US and Spain. The draft </p>
<p>operative paragraphs stated simply that the Security Council:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Decides that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity afforded to it by </p>
<p>resolution 1441”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Decides to remain seized of the matter.”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>713. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Security Council that:</p>
<p>“The co&#8209;sponsors are convinced that Iraq is not achieving, nor intending to achieve, </p>
<p>the objective of SCR 1441 … its unanimous message represented a powerful </p>
<p>signal that the UN was in control. The Security Council was challenged by the </p>
<p>US President to raise its game on its most difficult agenda item … The resolution </p>
<p>set out the most stringent terms ever decided upon by the United Nations for the </p>
<p>process of disarmament. But there was also an olive branch … Iraq was given every </p>
<p>incentive to repair its documented non&#8209;compliance.</p>
<p>“Today, 15 weeks on … we are no further advanced towards that objective of </p>
<p>complete disarmament. Indeed, nor is Iraq taking adequate steps to correct its wider </p>
<p>breaches of 687, including its support for terrorism. The terms of resolution 1441 are </p>
<p>not being respected …”</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>714. </b> Sir Jeremy stated:</p>
<p>“What we all asked of Iraq was, first, a marked change from its denial and </p>
<p>deception of 1991 to 2002, which had already placed it in material breach of </p>
<p>relevant resolutions; and second, full compliance with and co&#8209;operation with the </p>
<p>implementation of 1441. In other words, a decision by Iraq visibly and unmistakably </p>
<p>to divest itself of weapons of mass destruction immediately, unconditionally and </p>
<p>actively. That means bringing proscribed materials or programmes to the notice of </p>
<p>inspectors and providing a full and credible account of Iraq’s WMD activity backed </p>
<p>up by documentary evidence and testimony from personnel.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>306</p>
<p>“What 1441 was not was the establishment of a detective or a containment </p>
<p>exercise … The final opportunity afforded in SCR 1441 was not for the Council </p>
<p>to slide back into process, but for Iraq to recognise a new determination in the </p>
<p>Security Council to complete the business in a way which represented a complete </p>
<p>change of attitude in Baghdad.</p>
<p>“That has not happened.”</p>
<p><b>715. </b> Sir Jeremy said that the UK was “convinced” that Iraq had “decided to remain </p>
<p>in defiance of the UN”. The reasons included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “only agreed to inspections” after President Bush’s speech on </p>
<p>12 September 2002 “in a cynical attempt to scupper any new resolution </p>
<p>strengthening them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi letter of 13 November 2002 was “full of tirades and complaints”, </p>
<p>“grudgingly accepting that it would ‘deal with’ the resolution”. That was “way </p>
<p>short of the wholehearted commitment to voluntary disarmament we had </p>
<p>hoped for”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s 12,000 page declaration was “indisputably inadequate”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “done everything possible to prevent unrestricted interviews”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “dragged its feet on as many other elements of procedural co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>as possible. Instead of serious collaboration with the inspectors, Iraq has tried </p>
<p>to make the process into a tightly monitored media circus …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq’s co&#8209;operation on substance has been non&#8209;existent … UNMOVIC have not </p>
<p>been able to close a single outstanding issue … And there are now even more </p>
<p>unresolved questions …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“This continues … an all too familiar pattern of Iraq trying to get us to focus </p>
<p>on small concessions of process, rather than on the big picture … there is no </p>
<p>semblance of whole&#8209;hearted co&#8209;operation … nothing like a regime with nothing </p>
<p>to hide …”</p>
<p><b>716. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that the UK was seeking:</p>
<p>“… to keep the Council in control of the process and to build renewed Council </p>
<p>consensus … that Iraq has made the wrong choice: the choice not to take … the </p>
<p>final opportunity voluntarily to disarm … We shall, in detailed discussions, set out </p>
<p>further the argument that this choice has been made, that the choice is a defiance of </p>
<p>1441 and the available remedies are fast disappearing.”</p>
<p><b>717. </b> The UK was “not asking for any instant judgements”: there was “time still … for </p>
<p>Iraq to make the right choice”. The UK would not “call for a vote … until a proper debate </p>
<p>has been held”. There was:</p>
<p>“… still an opportunity to avert conflict. But the Council’s judgement that Iraq has </p>
<p>made the wrong choice should be clear and consensual. The last chance for peace </p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>307</p>
<p>is that the Council should say this together and formally, confront Baghdad with </p>
<p>the stark implications, and trust … the response will be complete disarmament which </p>
<p>we demanded … in SCR 687 [1991] …”</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Mr Sergei Lavrov, Russian Permanent Representative to the UN, asked Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>for the “additional facts justifying” his reference to Iraq’s support for terrorism. Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>reported that Mr Lavrov also stated that the “allegations being levelled against Iraq” </p>
<p>addressed the process of disarmament, not the substance.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>719. </b> In subsequent remarks to the press, Sir Jeremy stated that resolution 1441 “had </p>
<p>set out the terms. Iraq had failed to co&#8209;operate. The draft resolution was about taking </p>
<p>the hard decisions that followed.”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>720. </b> Asked by the Inquiry why the UK had tabled that draft resolution when, unlike </p>
<p>UNSCOM in December 1998, Dr Blix had stated he was getting co&#8209;operation on </p>
<p>process, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Whether he thought the action was justified or not, his reports were clear </p>
<p>that the compliance was not immediate and the co&#8209;operation unconditional. </p>
<p>It plainly wasn’t.”</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Mr Blair added that he did not believe that “if Dr Blix had another six months, </p>
<p>it would have come out any differently”. Saddam Hussein “was definitely in material </p>
<p>breach” of resolution 1441; Mr Blair “had to decide” whether his (Saddam Hussein’s) </p>
<p>behaviour “really” indicated that he was “someone who had had a change of heart”.</p>
<p><b>722. </b> Asked if there was a risk in tabling the resolution that it would appear that the </p>
<p>UK was trying to curtail the process because of the demands of military planning, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“It was more, actually … the other way round … what we were trying to do was to </p>
<p>say: how do you resolve what, on any basis, is a somewhat indistinct picture being </p>
<p>painted by Dr Blix …</p>
<p>“… I think we [Mr Blair and Dr Blix] … had a long conversation on the phone. </p>
<p>I remember Jack Straw was very much involved in this. Jeremy Greenstock, I think, </p>
<p>at the UN, was very much involved in this. We tried to construct these tests, and the </p>
<p>most important one, to me, was this ability to get the scientists out of the country.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>723.  France, Germany and Russia responded by tabling a memorandum which </b></p>
<p><b>proposed strengthening inspections and bringing forward the work programme </b></p>
<p><b>specified in resolution 1284 and accelerating its timetable.</b></p>
<p><b>724. </b> France, Germany and Russia responded to the draft resolution by tabling a </p>
<p>memorandum, building on the earlier tripartite declaration of 10 February, stating that </p>
<p>“full and effective disarmament” remained “the imperative objective of the international </p>
<p>community”.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> That “should be achieved peacefully through the inspection regime”. </p>
<p>The “conditions for using force” had “not been fulfilled”. The memorandum stated that </p>
<p>the Security Council “must step up its efforts to give a real chance to the peaceful </p>
<p>settlement of the crisis”. A “combination of a clear programme of action, reinforced </p>
<p>inspections, a clear timeline and the military build&#8209;up” provided “a realistic means </p>
<p>to unite the Security Council and to exert maximum pressure on Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>725.  Canada also circulated ideas for a process based on key tasks identified </b></p>
<p><b>by UNMOVIC.</b></p>
<p><b>726. </b> In a “non&#8209;paper” circulated on 24 February, Canada set out its ideas on </p>
<p>establishing “a defined process for a specific period of time to address the </p>
<p>Iraq situation”.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>727. </b> The document stated that the Security Council divisions on Iraq “could have </p>
<p>serious long&#8209;term implications for the UN and for international peace and stability”; </p>
<p>and that both sides of the division had a point:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An open&#8209;ended inspection process would relieve the pressure on the Iraqis </p>
<p>to disarm.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A truncated process would leave doubt that war was a last resort.”</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Canada suggested that the inspectors should bring forward their “clusters” </p>
<p>document “early” on 28 February and provide the Council with a prioritised list </p>
<p>of key substantive tasks for Iraq to accomplish. The inspectors would then provide </p>
<p>four, weekly, reports on the substance with a final report on 28 March for discussion </p>
<p>at a Ministerial&#8209;level meeting of the Security Council on 31 March.</p>
<p><b>729. </b> If the 28 March report indicated that Iraq had not complied, “all necessary means </p>
<p>could be used to force them to disarm”. If Iraq co&#8209;operated “an enhanced inspection, </p>
<p>verification and monitoring system would be implemented”.</p>
<p><b>730. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair on 26 February that the paper was “unhelpful”.</p>

<p><b>731.  The UK began an intense and determined effort to secure support for the </b></p>
<p><b>draft resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>732. </b> Between the discussion in the Security Council on 24 February and the reports </p>
<p>to the Security Council from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei on 7 March, the UK, US and Spain </p>
<p>began an intense and determined effort to try to persuade the members of the Council, </p>
<p>and other allies, to support the draft resolution.</p>
<p><b>733. </b> The campaign included letters from Mr Blair, telephone calls, meetings and visits </p>
<p>by Ministers and Sir David Manning, as well as discussions in New York and capitals </p>
<p>and public statements in the US and UK.</p>
<p><b>734. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell discussed developments on 25 February and </p>
<p>the “troublesome” implications of the request for more time. Mr Straw commented that </p>
<p>“everyone was running for cover, finding any reason not to take action”. In the tea room </p>
<p>of the House of Commons, he had “found much support for continued containment as </p>
<p>the best way of avoiding unintended consequences”.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p><b>735. </b> Iraq was reported to have “dominated” the discussion during a meeting and lunch </p>
<p>between Mr Straw and Mr Fischer on 25 February.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>736. </b> The record stated that “there was no meeting of minds”. Mr Fischer had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>made it clear that Germany could not vote for the UK/US/Spanish resolution, </p>
<p>which in “German eyes would lead directly to war”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>questioned why the inspections should stop now;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>suggested that destruction of Al Samoud 2 missiles would “prove resolution </p>
<p>1441 was working”, and that there were “other hopeful signs”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that the German/French/Russian joint memorandum set out the only </p>
<p>process that would lead to peace; containment was working; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stated that “war would lead to serious repercussions; increased terrorism; </p>
<p>insecurity in the Middle East”.</p>
<p><b>737. </b> Mr Straw was reported to have argued that the problem with Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was that: “he had history of ‘stringing it out’. He only made concessions which </p>
<p>represented the bare minimum, under the threat of force, and at the last minute.” The </p>
<p>joint memorandum “made the error of putting the burden on the inspectors to find Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction”; and that it “would merely lead to loose containment not </p>
<p>disarmament”. The burden should be on Saddam Hussein; he “could comply quickly” </p>
<p>and, as Mr Blair had said, “if Saddam complied, then he could stay in power”. The joint </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>310</p>
<p>memorandum “simply created the message that Saddam wanted to hear; that the </p>
<p>international community was divided”.</p>
<p><b>738. </b> In a letter to Sir David Manning on 25 February, Mr Straw’s Private Office identified </p>
<p>the core arguments for the UK to use in persuading other members of the Security </p>
<p>Council to support the resolution as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is an objective case against Iraq. We have given inspections 12 years </p>
<p>already. SCR 1441 (2002) set clear benchmarks – immediate, unconditional </p>
<p>and active co&#8209;operation. Iraqi co&#8209;operation has not been forthcoming.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More time will make no difference. Inspections are not a detective agency. </p>
<p>How many last chances can you have?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The authority of the UN is at stake. Collective threats in a globalised world </p>
<p>means taking on threats where they emerge …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is in no&#8209;one’s interest to see the US go unilateral. We need to show the </p>
<p>US that the UN can play a constructive role.”</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>739. </b> Following their discussion of the next steps on 25 February, Sir David reported that </p>
<p>Dr Rice thought there would be no vetoes of the resolution.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>740.  President Chirac’s position was identified as important but Mr Blair decided </b></p>
<p><b>to wait for “the right moment” to resume their dialogue.</b></p>
<p><b>741. </b> Sir John Holmes wrote to Sir David Manning on 24 February offering advice on </p>
<p>the way ahead.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> He recommended that it remained important that Mr Blair continued </p>
<p>to talk to President Chirac, “even if there is at present no chance of changing his mind”. </p>
<p>There would be “the usual problems about who picks up the phone first” but it would </p>
<p>be “much easier to attempt any final persuasion if we have kept up a dialogue”.</p>
<p><b>742. </b> Recognising that it was “outside my province, and very much for” Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock, Sir John also wrote:</p>
<p>“… the assumption here is that the French will not have to veto if we cannot </p>
<p>assemble nine positive votes … But have we thought about going ahead with a </p>
<p>vote even if we know we cannot get nine positive votes? Might there not be value </p>
<p>in a vote with six or seven positive votes and everyone else abstaining – it would </p>
<p>be a diplomatic failure in one sense, but if no&#8209;one had voted against, perhaps more </p>
<p>of a political mandate than otherwise? There might of course still be the risk of a </p>
<p>French vote against, but would they really want to do it in these circumstances? It is </p>
<p>obviously too soon to know how all this will play out in the end, but it might be worth </p>
<p>keeping the thought in mind.”</p>

<p><b>743. </b> Sir David Manning commented that he was not sure Mr Blair would have much </p>
<p>enthusiasm for Sir John’s first recommendation, but it was worth “bearing the argument </p>
<p>in mind”.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> Sir David agreed with Sir John’s second point.</p>
<p><b>744. </b> Mr Blair replied: “We sh[oul]d wait ‘til the right moment.”</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>745.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock remained concerned about the lack of support in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council and the implications, including the legal implications, of putting </b></p>
<p><b>the resolution to a vote and failing to get it adopted.</b></p>
<p><b>746. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that in the circumstances Sir John Holmes had </p>
<p>identified (fewer than nine positive votes but everyone else abstaining), the resolution </p>
<p>would not be adopted and it would have no legal effect.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> He found it:</p>
<p>“… hard to see how we could draw much legal comfort from such an outcome; but </p>
<p>an authoritative determination would be a matter for the Law Officers. (Kosovo was </p>
<p>different: in that case a Russian draft condemning the NATO action as illegal was </p>
<p>heavily defeated, leaving open the claim that the action was lawful … (or at least </p>
<p>was so regarded by the majority of the Council).)</p>
<p>“Furthermore, in the current climate … the political mandate to be drawn from a </p>
<p>draft which failed to achieve nine positive votes seems to me likely to be (at best) </p>
<p>weak … The stark reality would remain that the US and UK had tried and failed </p>
<p>to persuade the Council to endorse the use of force against Iraq. And the French </p>
<p>(and the Russians and Chinese) would no doubt be sitting comfortably among </p>
<p>the abstainers …</p>
<p>“My feeling … is that our interests are better served by not putting a draft to a vote </p>
<p>unless we were sure that it had sufficient votes to be adopted … But we should </p>
<p>revisit this issue later – a lot still had still to be played out in the Council.”</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Following discussions with the US and Spanish Missions in New York on </p>
<p>25 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that the “key arguments” in relation </p>
<p>to Canadian and other benchmarking proposals were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it was impossible accurately to define key remaining disarmament tasks, </p>
<p>or other benchmarks, in the absence of Iraqi co&#8209;operation …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Council had to accept there would never be total clarity …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1441 set the benchmarks for Iraqi co&#8209;operation, benchmarks it had manifestly </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>748. </b> Mexico had raised questions about the legal effect of the UK draft and whether it </p>
<p>signalled that peaceful means had been exhausted and whether a third Council decision </p>
<p>would be needed for the use of force.</p>
<p><b>749. </b> Sir Jeremy suggested that “consistent with being legally accurate”, the “most </p>
<p>persuasive answers” might be along the lines that:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the resolution itself asked the Council to conclude that Iraq had failed to take </p>
<p>its final opportunity to comply. This was something on which, given Iraq’s pattern </p>
<p>of non co&#8209;operation, the Council should be able to unite;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the consequence of that judgement, deriving from 1441 and previous </p>
<p>resolutions, was that force would be authorised;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>this did not mean that the resolution would lead to the use of force or that </p>
<p>peaceful means were exhausted. Rather, with a clear Council decision … there </p>
<p>was still a chance of last minute radical moves by the Iraqis. We recognised that </p>
<p>the probability of Iraq taking that chance … was low, but it was perhaps the only </p>
<p>route by which we could secure disarmament and a peaceful outcome.”</p>
<p><b>750. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that Mr Lavrov had suggested the inspectors had said </p>
<p>that there were no false statements and Iraq’s submission of 30 documents might have </p>
<p>rectified the omissions in the declaration.</p>
<p><b>751. </b> Sir Jeremy emphasised the importance of the Council meeting on 27 February </p>
<p>and asked for “additional detailed punchy arguments” he could deploy.</p>
<p><b>752. </b> Reporting discussions in New York on 26 February, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There remained “a general antipathy to having now to take decisions on </p>

<p>the resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The German position was that the process of inspections had not been </p>
<p>exhausted; the work programme and key tasks envisaged in resolution 1284, </p>
<p>which had not been revoked, had not begun; it had good reason to suspect that </p>
<p>that Iraq had WMD, but there was no proof and it could turn out that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein was telling the truth.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US position was that resolution 1441 had found Iraq in material breach </p>
<p>and partial compliance would not do. Continued inspections was, in effect, </p>
<p>an argument for containment; and “Business as usual” would not produce the </p>
<p>radical Iraqi transformation needed. The US was willing to ensure disarmament </p>
<p>by itself if necessary and the Council had to factor that into its decisions.</p>

<p>there was still a chance for him to make a last minute decision to leave or genuinely </p>
<p>yield all his WMD. The UK:</p>
<p>“… wanted a further Council decision because we wanted it to stay in control of this </p>
<p>issue. Saddam’s assertion that he had no WMD made benchmarks a pipe&#8209;dream – </p>
<p>how could we benchmark something the Iraqis said did not exist? Having </p>
<p>unanimously adopted 1441, we could not go back to extended inspections under </p>
<p>1284 … The fact … that Iraq was not fully co&#8209;operating – was the point. If colleagues </p>
<p>believed that Iraq was co&#8209;operating fully, then it was justified to vote against the text </p>
<p>or amend it. If they voted against the text for any other reason, they were denying </p>
<p>what was unanimously agreed in resolution 1441.”</p>
<p><b>754. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that the US was focused on preserving its room for </p>
<p>manoeuvre while he was “concentrating on trying to win votes”. It was the “middle </p>
<p>ground” that mattered. They “resent[ed] being forced to choose” between the P5 </p>
<p>and wanted “to come to an objective judgement”. Mexico and Chile were the “pivotal </p>
<p>sceptics”; and “effective arguments (and intelligence evidence) to show that Iraq’s zero </p>
<p>is a huge lie are going to be more productive … in bringing them over”.</p>
<p><b>755. </b> Sir Jeremy also reported that an UNMOVIC contact regarded letters received </p>

<p>WMD. That was a “Fundamental misunderstanding of the inspections process”, </p>
<p>which had “to date left very large questions unanswered – particularly about Iraqi </p>
<p>chemical and biological programmes”. It was “not for others to prove that Iraq </p>
<p>has got WMD, but for Iraq to prove that it has not, through full, immediate and </p>
<p>active co&#8209;operation with the inspectors as required by resolution 1441”. It was </p>
<p>“an extraordinary statement”. “Substantial evidence”, including the September </p>
<p>dossier, had been presented “of continuing Iraqi programmes and capabilities”.</p>

<p>Described Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council on 5 February </p>
<p>as having “offered extensive evidence of Iraqi activities to hinder inspections”. </p>
<p>In addition, in relation to specific provisions in resolution 1441, “no interviews </p>
<p>have taken place with individuals … under the conditions requested”; the Iraqis </p>
<p>had complied with the requirement to provide names of personnel “partially, </p>
<p>belatedly, and under pressure”; and the inspectors had faced “obstruction </p>
<p>and delay in attempting to search sites”. For example, on 16 January they </p>

<p>Mr Straw’s statements to the Security Council of 20 January, 5 February and </p>
<p>14 February 2003.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Mr Straw told Ms Annabelle Ewing (Scottish National Party):</p>
<p>“… Iraq has been, and remains in material breach of a string of very clear obligations </p>
<p>that have been imposed on it. It has had a final opportunity to deal with those </p>
<p>violations … but continues to pose the clearest possible threat to international </p>
<p>peace and security through its possession of weapons of mass destruction and </p>
<p>long&#8209;range missiles, and its defiance of international law. I hope that the whole </p>
<p>of the international community will recognise the responsibilities borne by it and </p>
<p>by individual members of the Security Council to ensure that international law means </p>
<p>what it says. I still hope that we can gain enforcement by peaceful means but, if we </p>
<p>cannot, the serious consequences … we spelled out in … resolution 1441 will have </p>
<p>to follow through.”</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>763. </b> Subsequently, in response to Ms Joan Ruddock (Labour), Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“I continue to hope that a vote [on the draft resolution] can be avoided because the </p>
<p>purpose of the resolution is to serve very clear notice on Saddam … that the final </p>
<p>opportunity has nearly passed.”</p>

<p><b>764.  In a statement on 25 February, Mr Blair rehearsed the Government’s strategy.</b></p>
<p><b>765. </b> On 25 February, Mr Blair made a statement in the House of Commons on Iraq.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>766. </b> Mr Blair provided a brief history of the crisis in which he emphasised Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s concealment of his biological and nuclear weapons programmes from the </p>
<p>inspectors and his continued deception.</p>
<p><b>767. </b> Mr Blair stated that the intelligence was “clear” that Saddam Hussein continued </p>
<p>“to believe that his weapons of mass destruction programme is essential both for internal </p>
<p>repression and for external aggression”. It was also “essential to his regional power”. </p>
<p>“Prior to the inspectors coming back in”, Saddam Hussein “was engaged in a systematic </p>
<p>exercise in concealment of those weapons”. The inspectors had reported some </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation on process, but had “denied progress on substance”.</p>
<p><b>768. </b> Mr Blair said that the UK, US and Spain had introduced a resolution deciding </p>
<p>that Iraq had “failed to take the final opportunity”, but would “not put the resolution </p>
<p>to a vote immediately” to “give Saddam one further final chance to disarm voluntarily”. </p>
<p>The UN inspectors would have a further report to make in March but the time had come </p>
<p>for Saddam Hussein to decide. Peaceful disarmament required active co&#8209;operation.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>769. </b> Mr Blair said that the memorandum put forward by France, Germany and Russia </p>
<p>called “for more time – up to the end of July at least”. But the issue was not time but will. </p>
<p>The risk was that Saddam Hussein wanted to drag the process out until the attention of </p>
<p>the international community waned.</p>
<p><b>770. </b> Mr Blair emphasised that the objective was disarmament but “the nature of </p>
<p>Saddam’s regime was relevant”, first because “weapons of mass destruction in the </p>
<p>hands of a regime of this brutality” were “especially dangerous, in particular because </p>
<p>Saddam has chosen his willingness to use them”. Secondly, the innocent were dying </p>
<p>in Iraq every day.</p>
<p><b>771. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the authority of the United Nations and the international </p>
<p>community was at stake. If that was not upheld, the consequences would “stretch far </p>
<p>beyond Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>772. </b> In response to questions about the threat posed by Iraq, Mr Blair stated that </p>
<p>that the “whole basis of resolution 1441” was that Saddam Hussein constituted a </p>
<p>threat, adding:</p>
<p>“Moreover, there is a whole set of related dangers to do with unstable states </p>
<p>developing or proliferating such material and with potential links to terrorism.  </p>
<p>That is why, in the end, the world has to take a very strong view of the matter </p>
<p>and deal with it.”</p>
<p><b>773. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that Mr Blair had called him later and said:</p>
<p>“… it was going to be really tough from now on in. The truth was we may well have </p>
<p>to go without a second UNSCR, or even without a majority on the UNSC. The Bush </p>
<p>poodle problem would get bigger … but he was adamant it was the right thing to do, </p>
<p>and worth the political consequences.”</p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>774. </b> Mr Campbell added that “an awful lot” of Labour MPs were “committed to rebellion” </p>
<p>and were asking if Iraq was a threat “to us, and now”? Mr Blair was “dismissive” of </p>
<p>Dr Blix; he had “said his job was to set out the facts, but he now saw his mission as </p>
<p>to stop war”.</p>
<p><b>775. </b> In his memoir, Mr Cook wrote that Mr Blair had been:</p>
<p>“… at his most effective. He was convincing and passionate about his own belief </p>
<p>in the correctness of his course of action …</p>
<p>“However, no amount of skilled presentation could conceal the immense confusion </p>
<p>that we are in over the role of the UN. Tony knows that he desperately needs the </p>
<p>blessing of the UN if he is to have any chance of carrying domestic opinion with him, </p>

<p>317</p>
<p>but since he knows that Bush will go to war whatever the UN says, Tony’s attempt </p>
<p>to wrap himself in the UN flag is fatally hobbled by his inability to say that the UN </p>
<p>will have the last word.”</p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>776. </b> Mr Cook added that Mr Blair’s exchanges with backbenchers had “clearly laid out </p>
<p>the nexus of issues which have brought him to his present conviction”. That was that </p>
<p>“proliferation, plus unstable states plus terrorism adds up to a new and serious threat”. </p>
<p>That was:</p>
<p>“… a way of linking action against Saddam to the response to 9/11, and avoids the </p>
<p>irritating evidence that Saddam has no link whatsoever to 9/11 and has no link with </p>
<p>Al Qaida. But it does still leave unanswered why Iraq is the focus of so much effort. </p>
<p>Whatever else we may say about the Iraqi regime, it is not unstable …”</p>
<p><b>777. </b> Asked by Mr Duncan Smith during PMQs on 26 February whether he would </p>
<p>support action in the absence of a majority in the Security Council, Mr Blair responded </p>
<p>that he believed that there would be support for a second resolution.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p><b>778. </b> Mr Blair subsequently stated that he was “working flat out” to achieve a second </p>
<p>resolution, and that the best way to do that was “to hold firm to the terms of resolution </p>
<p>1441”. That required “full, unconditional and immediate compliance” from Iraq, and was </p>
<p>intended “genuinely to be the final opportunity” for Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>779.  The House of Commons was asked on 26 February to reaffirm its </b></p>
<p><b>endorsement of resolution 1441, to support the Government’s continuing efforts </b></p>
<p><b>to disarm Iraq, and to call upon Iraq to recognise that this was its final opportunity </b></p>
<p><b>to comply with its obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>780.  The Government motion was approved by 434 votes to 124; 199 MPs voted </b></p>
<p><b>for an amendment which invited the House to “find the case for military action </b></p>
<p><b>against Iraq as yet unproven”.</b></p>
<p><b>781. </b> The Government motion tabled for debate on 26 February invited the  </p>
<p>House of Commons to:</p>
<p>“Take note of Command Paper Cm 5769 on Iraq; reaffirm its endorsement of </p>
<p>United Nations Security Council resolution 1441, as expressed in its resolution </p>
<p>of 25 November 2002; support the Government’s continuing efforts in the United </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>782. </b> In his statement opening the debate, Mr Straw said that the motion meant what </p>
<p>it said. It was “not an endorsement of military action” and no decision “to deploy British </p>
<p>forces in action” had “yet been taken”.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> Any decision on military action would be put </p>
<p>to the House and “subject only to the usual caveat about the safety of our forces”. It was </p>
<p>“as much in the Government’s interest as it is in the paramount interest of the House, </p>
<p>that we should do so before the start of hostilities”. The House would be kept informed </p>
<p>on the business of the Security Council and have “a full opportunity to debate and vote </p>
<p>on the outcome of proceedings on any second resolution”.</p>
<p><b>783. </b> Stating that he intended to answer the “central and continuing question in people’s </p>
<p>minds”, Mr Straw said that the 13 Security Council resolutions in the Command Paper </p>
<p>provided the best answer to the question “Why Iraq?” They showed “paragraph by </p>
<p>paragraph, the exceptional danger posed by Iraq, and its continued defiance of the </p>
<p>United Nations”. Iraq had “flatly and completely” refused to comply with resolution 1284 </p>
<p>(1999). Resolution 1441 gave Iraq its “final opportunity”. Iraq was the “only country in </p>
<p>such serious and multiple breach of mandatory UN obligations”.</p>
<p><b>784. </b> In response to the question “Why now?”, Mr Straw stated that Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>aim was that “now” should never arrive. His tactics were to “prevaricate in the hope that </p>
<p>by exploiting people’s natural anxieties” he could “string out the process forever and </p>
<p>keep his arsenal”. Since the inspectors’ return to Iraq, Saddam Hussein had not provided </p>
<p>new evidence and there were concerted Iraqi efforts to prevent unrestricted interviews </p>
<p>with scientists. The inspectors had not been able to close a single outstanding issue.</p>
<p><b>785. </b> In response to calls for “more time and more inspections”, Mr Straw said that in </p>
<p>the absence of active and immediate Iraqi co&#8209;operation, more time would not achieve </p>
<p>anything of substance. The disarmament of South Africa had taken nine inspectors and </p>
<p>three years. The “grudging concessions on process” from Saddam Hussein had been </p>
<p>“secured only because of the military build up”. Saddam Hussein “must either embark </p>
<p>immediately on voluntary and full disarmament or the Security Council must face </p>
<p>up to its responsibility to see that he is disarmed by force”.</p>
<p><b>786. </b> Iraq had made “a string of cynically timed concessions” that were “calculated </p>
<p>to divide and delay”. A second resolution was needed to “bring this game to a halt”. </p>
<p>If the words “final opportunity” in resolution 1441 were to have any meaning, it was that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein should not be allowed to “lure the international community into endless </p>
<p>indecision”. Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… would use a further 120 days to bring the authority of the United Nations lower </p>
<p>week by week, to tie the weapons inspectors in knots, and create further divisions </p>
<p>within the international community.”</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>787. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“Worse, this delay would send Saddam the clearest possible signal that his strategy </p>
<p>is succeeding. It would tell him that the international community lacked the will </p>
<p>to disarm him, and it would tell all those who threaten our security that Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein has broken the United Nations as an instrument for defending peace </p>
<p>through the force of international law.”</p>
<p><b>788. </b> Mr Straw argued against persisting with a policy of containment. That was “not the </p>
<p>policy of disarmament as set out in resolution 1441 or any of the preceding resolutions”. </p>
<p>There could be “no stable, steady state for Iraq unless it is properly disarmed”. Nor could </p>
<p>there be stability for the region and the international community: “What may appear </p>
<p>to be containment to others is rearmament for Saddam.” “Far from keeping a lid on </p>
<p>Saddam’s ambitions”, the policy of containment between 1998 and 2002 had “allowed </p>
<p>him to rebuild his horrific arsenal, his chemical and biological weapons, and the means </p>
<p>of delivering them”. Mr Straw cited Iraq’s refurbishment of prohibited equipment and the </p>
<p>building of a missile test stand as proof of that activity. Containment required “a degree </p>
<p>of trust in Saddam that we cannot risk and which runs contrary to all the evidence”.</p>
<p><b>789. </b> In relation to questions about double standards, especially in relation to Israel </p>
<p>and Palestine, Mr Straw said that he and Mr Blair accepted that there had been a </p>
<p>“considerable amount to that charge” but the way to deal with that was “not by ignoring </p>
<p>outstanding UN obligations, but by working even harder to see all of them implemented”. </p>
<p>The UK was “working actively to implement” UN policy on Israel/Palestine “including the </p>
<p>early publication of the Road Map”.</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“International terrorism and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction are the </p>
<p>crucial strategic questions of our time. Our answer to the threats will determine the </p>
<p>stability of the world for decades to come. This is an awesome responsibility. It calls </p>
<p>for courageous leadership and it requires a vision and foresight to act decisively </p>
<p>and, if necessary, with military force.”</p>
<p><b>791. </b> Mr Straw concluded that a “moment of choice” had been reached for Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein and for the Iraqi regime, and for the United Nations. The:</p>
<p>“… issue of what we do about tyrannical states with poison gases, nerve agents, </p>
<p>viruses and nuclear ambitions, and which defy international law and the principles </p>
<p>of the UN, will not go away. We have to face the issue. We have to give Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein a categorical choice, and after 12 long years he has to give us his </p>
<p>answer now.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>Points made during the debate</b></p>
<p>The debate that followed Mr Straw’s statement returned repeatedly to the question of </p>
<p>whether the inspectors should be given more time, and whether the case had yet been </p>
<p>made that military action was necessary.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> A number of MPs referred to the need for </p>
<p>an authorising UN resolution if action was to go ahead, and for plans for the delivery </p>
<p>of humanitarian aid to Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Chris Smith (Labour) told the House that there must be “the clearest possible reasons” </p>
<p>for going to war and risking thousands of lives, and added “I do not believe those reasons </p>
<p>are there”.</p>
<p>Mr Kenneth Clarke (Conservative) said: “I cannot rid myself of doubts that the course to </p>
<p>war upon which we are now embarked was decided on many months ago, primarily in </p>
<p>Washington, and there has been a fairly remorseless unfolding of events since that time.”</p>
<p>That point was echoed by Mr John Gummer (Conservative), who said: “There is </p>
<p>no Member of Parliament who does not know that this war is war by timetable, and </p>
<p>the timetable was laid before the United States had any intention of going to the </p>
<p>United Nations.”</p>
<p><b>792. </b> After the debate, 199 MPs voted for an amendment to the Government </p>
<p>motion which invited the House to “find the case for military action against Iraq </p>
<p>as yet unproven”.</p>
<p><b>793. </b> The Government motion was approved by 434 votes to 124.</p>
<p><b>794. </b> Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice on 27 February to explain the political </p>
<p>difficulties in the UK:</p>
<p>“Yesterday’s outcome [in the House of Commons] emphasised in stark terms that </p>
<p>a second resolution was absolutely vital …”</p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>795. </b> Mr Cook wrote that it was the largest rebellion against the Government in his </p>

<p><b>798. </b> In a speech at the American Enterprise Institute on 26 February, President Bush </p>
<p>stated that Saddam Hussein was “building and hiding weapons that could enable him </p>
<p>to dominate the Middle East and intimidate the civilized world”; and that the US would </p>
<p>“not allow it”.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> In addition, Saddam Hussein had “close ties to terrorist organizations, </p>
<p>and could supply them with terrible means to strike” the US. The danger that posed </p>
<p>“could not be ignored or wished away” and “must be confronted”. The US hoped:</p>
<p>“… that the Iraqi regime will meet the demands of the United Nations and disarm, </p>
<p>fully and peacefully. If it does not, we are prepared to disarm Iraq by force. </p>
<p>Either way, this danger will be removed.</p>
<p>“The safety of the American people depends on ending this direct and growing </p>
<p>threat. Acting … will also contribute greatly to the long&#8209;term safety and stability </p>
<p>of our world … A liberated Iraq can show the power of freedom to transform this </p>
<p>vital region, by bringing hope and progress into the lives of millions.”</p>
<p><b>799. </b> If it “must use force”, the United States and “our coalition” stood ready to: “help </p>
<p>the citizens of a liberated Iraq”; “lead in carrying out the urgent and dangerous work </p>
<p>of destroying chemical and biological weapons”; “provide security against those who </p>
<p>try to spread chaos, or settle scores, or threaten the territorial integrity of Iraq”; and </p>
<p>“protect Iraq’s natural resources from sabotage … and ensure those resources are </p>
<p>used for the benefit of the owners – the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p><b>800. </b> The US had “no intention of determining the precise form of Iraq’s new </p>
<p>government”; that choice belonged to the Iraqi people. But the US would “ensure </p>
<p>that one brutal dictator is not replaced by another”:</p>
<p>“All Iraqis must have a voice in the new government and all citizens must have their </p>
<p>rights protected.</p>
<p>“Rebuilding Iraq will require a sustained commitment from many nations … </p>
<p>we will remain in Iraq as long as necessary, and not a day more … in the peace </p>
<p>that followed a world war … we did not leave behind occupying armies, we left </p>
<p>constitutions and parliaments. We established an atmosphere of safety, in which </p>
<p>responsible, reform&#8209;minded local leaders could build lasting institutions of freedom </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… The nation of Iraq – with its proud heritage, abundant resources and skilled </p>
<p>and educated people – is fully capable of moving towards democracy and living </p>
<p>in freedom.”</p>
<p><b>801. </b> A new regime in Iraq would:</p>
<p>“… serve as dramatic and inspiring example of freedom for other nations </p>
<p>in the region …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>322</p>
<p>“Success in Iraq could also begin a new stage for Middle Eastern peace and set </p>
<p>in motion progress towards a truly democratic Palestinian state. The passing of </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime will deprive terrorist networks … of a wealthy patron … </p>
<p>And other regimes will be given a clear warning that support for terror would not </p>
<p>be tolerated.”</p>
<p><b>802. </b> President Bush also stated that a future Palestinian state must abandon for ever </p>
<p>the use of terror and that, as the threat of terror receded, Israel must support efforts </p>
<p>to create a viable state. He reiterated his personal commitment to implement the </p>
<p>Road Map, but without setting a timetable.</p>
<p><b>803. </b> President Bush said that confronting Iraq showed the US “commitment to effective </p>
<p>international institutions”; and that he wanted the words of the Security Council to have </p>
<p>meaning. The world needed:</p>
<p>“… international bodies with the authority and will to stop the spread of terror </p>
<p>and chemical and biological weapons … High&#8209;minded pronouncements against </p>
<p>proliferation mean little unless the strongest nations are willing to stand behind them </p>
<p>– and use force if necessary … the United Nations was created, as Winston Churchill </p>
<p>said, ‘to make sure that the force of right will, in the ultimate issue, be protected </p>
<p>by the right of force’.”</p>
<p><b>804. </b> In her memoir, Dr Rice wrote that the speech was made after she and Mr Hadley </p>
<p>had “realized belatedly” in late February “that the President had not made the broader </p>
<p>arguments” for action in Iraq. She also commented: “But the die had been cast. This was </p>
<p>a war that had been justified by an intelligence judgement, not a strategic one.”</p>
<p>243</p>
<p><b>805. </b> Following the speech, Mr Straw asked for further work on the draft vision for </p>
<p>the Iraqi people, which had first been produced in 2001, on the grounds that a “public </p>
<p>commitment on the lines of the draft could have a powerful impact in Iraq and the region </p>
<p>as well as on the British domestic debate”.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> It would not be launched or trailed until </p>
<p>after the UN had voted on the second resolution because of the risk that it would be </p>
<p>presented as “discounting the role” of the Security Council. Care would also be needed </p>
<p>to avoid confusing the message that the justification for military action rested firmly </p>
<p>on disarmament of WMD.</p>
<p><b>806. </b> Mr Straw thought it essential that the UK, US and “other coalition members” were </p>
<p>speaking to a common script. That underlined the importance of making progress with </p>
<p>the US on post&#8209;conflict planning; and although there was nothing in the UK draft that </p>
<p>“could not be squared with US policy” as set out in President Bush’s speech, “elements </p>
<p>… go further than the US has so far done in public or, on some issues including </p>
<p>UN involvement, in private”.</p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 26 February 2003: </b></p>
<p><b>‘Iraq: Prospects in the North’</b></p>
<p>At the request off the FCO the JIC produced an Assessment on 26 February of how </p>
<p>the Iraqi regime would respond in northern Iraq to a Coalition attack; the likely attitudes </p>
<p>and actions of Turkey and the Iraqi Kurds; and the prospects for northern Iraq </p>
<p>post&#8209;Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> The Assessment highlighted the short and longer&#8209;term risks </p>
<p>of action in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The JIC specifically asked Mr John Scarlett, the Chairman, to draw the Assessment </p>
<p>to the attention of Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> He wrote that it noted:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The continued presence of significant military forces in the North and the </p>
<p>possibility that they were equipped with WMD.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The potential for fighting between Turkish and Kurdish forces.”</p>

<p>249</p>
<p> There had been considerable </p>
<p>diplomatic activity to win the votes of the 10 non&#8209;permanent members of the Council. </p>
<p>He thought that Spain and Bulgaria would support; and Syria and Germany would vote </p>
<p>against or abstain. Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico and Pakistan were being </p>
<p>encouraged to vote for the resolution. France and Russia would need to “think through </p>
<p>their responsibilities”.</p>
<p><b>811. </b> Reporting on his visit to Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, Mr Hoon said that they were </p>
<p>supportive of “our approach”. The Royal Navy Task Force and about half the total British </p>
<p>military commitment of 45,000 service men and women was in the region. He was </p>
<p>“confident that the troops and their equipment would arrive in place as planned”.</p>
<p><b>812. </b> Mr Hoon had “one particular concern” which he had discussed with General </p>
<p>Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief US Central Command (CENTCOM), that:</p>
<p>“Not enough planning had been done on the post&#8209;conflict phase of operations, </p>
<p>including humanitarian relief. British forces could find themselves in charge of </p>
<p>a portion of Iraq quite quickly if resistance to Coalition military action collapsed. </p>
<p>It would be helpful if experts from the Department for International Development </p>
<p>could work with military planners in the region and consider pre&#8209;positioning </p>
<p>humanitarian supplies so that there was no hiatus in the event that military action </p>
<p>took place.”</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Ms Short said that experts had been involved in talks in the Pentagon. </p>
<p>Preparations were “just beginning and needed to be expedited”. A UN legal mandate </p>
<p>was “essential” for the humanitarian and reconstruction tasks that lay ahead. Without </p>
<p>that, “proper preparation was impossible”. That matter “needed to become a priority </p>
<p>for the Coalition”. It would be “difficult” to accommodate action in Iraq within her </p>
<p>department’s contingency reserve: “Greater resources were likely to be needed.”</p>
<p><b>814. </b> The points made in discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MEPP needed to be revived quickly. That was the focus of much Arab </p>
<p>frustration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Unity inside Europe needed to be restored “as soon as possible after  </p>
<p>any military action”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Keeping to the UN route and winning support for a new Security Council </p>
<p>resolution would garner support in the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of a veto, gaining a preponderance of votes for a new resolution </p>
<p>could still be important.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Insufficient credit had been given to the value of the No&#8209;Fly Zones and the </p>
<p>difference between life in northern Iraq, which was beyond Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>direct control, and that elsewhere in Iraq.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “sharp differences of view” in the debate in Parliament </p>
<p>on 26 February, the tone was not “unpleasant, but the issues were difficult, </p>
<p>and views could still be swayed”. The commitment to a further debate had </p>
<p>been “wise”.</p>
<p><b>815. </b> Mr Blair said that he would continue to push for a further Security Council </p>
<p>resolution. President Bush’s commitments the previous day in respect of the MEPP were </p>
<p>“helpful”. Looking beyond the current divisions in the international community it would </p>
<p>be “important to seek unity of purpose through the humanitarian and reconstruction </p>
<p>work which would follow any military action”. Planning in this field “needed to take centre </p>
<p>stage”. He would pursue that with President Bush “in the coming days”. The “transitional </p>
<p>civil administration in Iraq should have a United Nations mandate, although the scale </p>
<p>of United Nations involvement should balance the administrative effectiveness with </p>
<p>the necessity for proper authority”.</p>
<p><b>816. </b> Mr Blair described the debate in the UK and Parliament as “open”:</p>
<p>“Feelings were running high and the concerns expressed were genuine. But </p>
<p>decisions had to be made. The central arguments remained the threat posed </p>
<p>by weapons of mass destruction in the hands of Iraq; the brutal nature of the Iraqi </p>
<p>regime; and the importance of maintaining the authority of the UN in the international </p>
<p>order. Failure to achieve a further Security Council resolution would reinforce the </p>
<p>hand of the unilateralists in the American Administration.”</p>
<p><b>817. </b> Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“At Cabinet, things were pretty much rock solid … I could sense a few of them only </p>
<p>fully realising … the enormity of the decisions, the enormity of the responsibility </p>
<p>involved. Robin [Cook] was the trickiest … Clare [Short] was doing her usual … </p>
<p>and for her was relatively onside. She wanted to do a big number on aftermath </p>
<p>preparations but TB was there ahead of her. He was very calm, matter of fact, just </p>
<p>went through where we were on all the main aspects of this. Margaret Beckett </p>
<p>[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs] … made a very strong </p>
<p>intervention. She was a really useful barometer and she was very supportive. </p>
<p>Nobody was really looking to make TB’s position more difficult … with the possible </p>
<p>exception of Robin.”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>818. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… said later that he felt only now was [President] Bush really aware of the full extent </p>
<p>of the stakes here. This had the potential to transform for good America’s relations </p>
<p>with Europe and the rest of the world, and in a worst&#8209;case scenario was a disaster </p>

<p>LORD GOLDSMITH’S MEETING WITH NO.10 OFFICIALS, 27 FEBRUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>819.  When Lord Goldsmith met No.10 officials on 27 February he advised that </b></p>
<p><b>the safest legal course would be to secure a further Security Council resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>820.  Lord Goldsmith told them, however, that he had reached the view that </b></p>
<p><b>a “reasonable case” could be made that resolution 1441 was capable of reviving </b></p>
<p><b>the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 (1990) without a further resolution, </b></p>
<p><b>if there were strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take </b></p>
<p><b>the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>821.  Lord Goldsmith advised that, to avoid undermining the case for reliance </b></p>
<p><b>on resolution 1441, it would be important to avoid giving any impression that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK believed a second resolution was legally required.</b></p>
<p><b>822. </b> At the request of No.10, Lord Goldsmith met Mr Powell, Baroness Morgan </p>
<p>(Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations) and Sir David Manning </p>
<p>on 27 February.</p>
<p>251 </p>

<p>message to Iraq “if the Council were not able to pass this straightforward </p>
<p>justified resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Lavrov had said implementation of 1441 and 1284 should continue “until </p>
<p>the inspectors encountered impediments and obstacles”. Iraq was “not blocking </p>
<p>the work of [the] inspectors and was more and more actively co&#8209;operating </p>
<p>on substance”. That was “the result” of “continuing pressure” from a “unified” </p>
<p>Council “and the strong inspection mandate which could, if necessary, be </p>
<p>made more effective”. Facts were needed “to close this issue”. He suggested </p>
<p>distribution of UNMOVIC’s “clusters” document to provide the basis </p>
<p>for discussion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Aguilar Zinser, Mexican Permanent representative to the UN, said Mexico </p>
<p>“still wanted: disarmament; a peaceful solution; inspections … and multilateral </p>
<p>consideration of this issue” and, unusually, asked the UK, US and Spain a series </p>
<p>of questions about the proposal.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Juan Gabriel Valdés, Chilean Permanent Representative to the UN “urged </p>
<p>the P5 to find a solution”. He “did not reject the use of force but it must only </p>
<p>be once all peaceful means had been exhausted”. He “wanted the continuation </p>
<p>of inspections for some time before a definitive report”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Inocencio Arias, Spanish Permanent Representative to the UN, had  </p>
<p>said the draft was “one more step in imposing serious diplomatic pressure”. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein co&#8209;operated only under pressure. The more time was given, </p>
<p>“the less pressure he would face”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>827. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that the points he had made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We were not getting Iraqi co&#8209;operation because “the ‘zero’ Iraq had declared </p>
<p>was a lie”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “trickling out concessions to divide the Council, buy time and avert </p>
<p>military action while continuing concealment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “very probable that Iraq would decide to destroy the Al Samoud missiles. </p>
<p>In addition they might also start trickling out what they claimed to be newly </p>
<p>discovered documents and announce ‘private’ interviews which would in reality </p>
<p>still be monitored and taped.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He “recognised” that he was “saying things that could not be confirmed by the </p>
<p>inspectors”, but the UK had “invested in facilities not available to other member </p>
<p>states or the inspectors because our national interest was at stake and the UN </p>
<p>was being defied. We were providing detailed intelligence to the inspectors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “our word against Saddam’s – but Council members had to choose whom </p>
<p>they believed”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had used “the points provided by the Assessments </p>
<p>Staff”, including Iraq’s:</p>
<p>“… capacity to produce chemical and biological weapons; its delivery mechanisms; </p>
<p>the efforts the regime had taken to conceal WMD; the fact that the regime had </p>
<p>considered whether to declare some weapons but concluded it was too risky; plans </p>
<p>to obstruct … [the inspectors] if they got too close; and the intimidation to prevent </p>
<p>private interviews which Iraq saw as the weak link that could expose their WMD”.</p>
<p><b>829. </b> In addition, he stated that “UNMOVIC had been tagging proscribed equipment </p>
<p>that had been repaired by the Iraqis”.</p>
<p><b>830. </b> Directly challenging the French/German/Russian proposal, Sir Jeremy reported </p>
<p>that he had said it “wrongly claimed inspections were not being hindered” and “wrongly </p>
<p>suggested” a number of other proposals to strengthen inspections and allow more </p>
<p>time. It “did not add up to a solution delivering disarmament, but at best temporary </p>
<p>containment while Iraq continued to exploit major holes in sanctions to develop WMD”.</p>
<p><b>831. </b> Addressing the legal arguments “using the lines agreed with London”, Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>said that the “new draft, if adopted, would confirm the authorisation of the use of force </p>
<p>inherent in resolutions 678, 687 and 1441”. It would increase the pressure on Iraq; but it:</p>
<p>“… did not necessarily mean that its adoption would in practice lead to immediate </p>
<p>use of force. There was still a chance that at the last minute Iraq would take </p>
<p>radical action to disarm. The UK hoped that would be the result. This was the only </p>
<p>remaining route to secure disarmament and a peaceful outcome.”</p>
<p><b>832. </b> Sir Jeremy stated that he “recognised that [resolution] 1441 set an awkwardly high </p>
<p>standard. But we had adopted it and at no point had inspectors reported the immediate, </p>
<p>active and unconditional co&#8209;operation demanded”. He “accepted delay was more </p>
<p>comfortable and that there were downsides to the action … proposed”. But colleagues </p>

<p><b>836. </b> Sir Jeremy commented that: “Positions remain generally unchanged” but the </p>
<p>co&#8209;sponsors had produced a “more effective line of argument than the opposition”.</p>
<p><b>837. </b> Following the meeting, details emerged of a letter from Iraq to Dr Blix confirming </p>
<p>“agreement ‘in principle’ to the destruction of Al Samoud 2 missiles”. Sir Jeremy reported </p>
<p>that he had “tried to discount it in advance with the Council”. If Iraq’s “acceptance ‘in </p>
<p>principle’” did not turn into concrete destruction before 1 March, which Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>thought “unlikely”, that would be “a bonus”.</p>
<p><b>838.  Dr Blix told the UK Mission that he could and would make the “clusters” </b></p>

<p><b>839. </b> Dr Blix lunched with EU Heads of Mission in New York on 28 February.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>840. </b> The UK Mission reported that Dr Blix had made a number of points including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “had not actively co&#8209;operated until recently”. It was now producing </p>
<p>documents, a list of participants in destruction activities in 1991, and digging </p>
<p>up R&#8209;400 bombs. But Iraq had not started to disarm, the picture on interviews </p>
<p>was “disappointing”, and the flow of documents was “limited”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He shared the US view that it “was for Iraq to declare its WMD holdings and </p>
<p>show how it was disarming”. UNMOVIC was not a detective agency. There was </p>
<p>plenty Iraq could do to address allegations which were well known to Baghdad, </p>
<p>such as checkpoints for trucks and an inventory of underground facilities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could have acted earlier. Iraq was not co&#8209;operating fully and actively. </p>
<p>Full co&#8209;operation should not take a long time. If UNMOVIC secured full </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, “verification would take neither years nor weeks but months”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been no change of heart, just more activity. Iraq had attempted </p>
<p>to conceal things.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The debate was “somewhat over&#8209;focused on the outstanding questions identified </p>
<p>by UNSCOM”. It was not possible to prove a negative (Iraq’s claim that it had not </p>
<p>resumed any WMD programmes): “But Iraq could certainly make the negative </p>
<p>plausible (e.g. producing documents; opening underground facilities).” It could </p>
<p>“certainly do more on interviews”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He thought there was increasing acceptance in the Council that he should </p>
<p>circulate UNMOVIC’s clusters of unresolved questions. But UNMOVIC should </p>
<p>not “grade” Iraq’s co&#8209;operation; that was “the responsibility of the Council”. </p>
<p>But producing the document would facilitate Iraq’s task.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He did not think he was bound to deliver the work programme required </p>
<p>by resolution 1284 “only on 27 March”. It would be “fairly short”, but the </p>
<p>Commissioners had still to take a view.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It would “make sense for UNMOVIC to identify some priorities” within the </p>
<p>clusters. He suggested VX, anthrax and SCUD missiles.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… just three months of inspections was ‘not fully satisfactory’ as a decent </p>
<p>amount of time to give the inspections effort. But that was a Council decision.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the Council voted for war, there would be a long term monitoring requirement. </p>
<p>It would be for the Council to decide whether UNMOVIC should go back and </p>
<p>on what terms.</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Dr Blix subsequently told the UK Mission that he could and would make the </p>
<p>clusters document available for the Security Council meeting on 7 March. But </p>

<p>said he was “not opposed to surfacing the clusters document … provided it was </p>
<p>not accompanied by the list of key remaining tasks”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreed that, “after any conflict, US forces should certainly be accompanied </p>
<p>by UNMOVIC inspectors to witness the uncovering of WMD and missiles. </p>
<p>But there was Pentagon resistance … and, if the resolution failed to pass, </p>
<p>giving UNMOVIC a role could be a difficult argument.”</p>
<p><b>843. </b> The UK continued to provide information to UNMOVIC on potential targets for </p>

<p>of a majority in Congress”.</p>

<p>President Lagos’ understanding “that military action would go ahead”, his view </p>
<p>that “it would be better for it to do so in the UN context”, his wish not to have the </p>

<p><b>846. </b> To address the difficulties created by “the impression that the US was determined </p>
<p>to go to war come what may”, Mr Blair and Mr Aznar agreed the need to pursue a </p>
<p>communications strategy showing that they “were doing everything possible to avoid </p>
<p>war”. Mr Blair would also seek more public support from Denmark and the Netherlands.</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“Blix was now causing us significant problems. He was talking now about Saddam’s </p>
<p>line on [potential decommissioning of] Al Samoud missiles being a significant </p>
<p>piece of disarmament. TB was raging again, said the man was supposed to be a </p>
<p>civil servant, but had decided to behave like a politician. He is just desperate not </p>
<p>to be seen as the person who allowed a war to start, but his job is to present the </p>

<p>Some … favored doing so as a means of pressurising others to stand up and declare </p>
<p>themselves against going to war, even if it did not appear that we had the votes to </p>
<p>win. I never understood this logic and thought this approach misguided, and instead </p>
<p>argued that the worst of all outcomes would be to lose a vote and then go to war. </p>
<p>This would be widely viewed as … arrogant … and raise even more fundamental </p>
<p>questions concerning the legitimacy and legality of what the US was contemplating. </p>
<p>I also thought it would do real and lasting damage to the United Nations. Far </p>
<p>better to explore getting a second resolution and then pull back if consultations </p>
<p>demonstrated that it was likely that we could not prevail … I argued all this out in </p>
<p>a memorandum that Powell distributed to the [NSC] Principals. Fortunately, this </p>
<p>position carried the day, and the Administration decided to pull back if and when </p>
<p>it became obvious that no international consensus favoring war would emerge.”</p>

<p>and VX. Since then, the inspectors had been prevented from doing their job properly. </p>
<p>War must be a last resort but the international community could not allow Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein to play games and spin things out. Proper access to scientists was one key </p>
<p>to progress.</p>
<p><b>860. </b> Mr Scarlett was reported to have told President Fox that the UK had developed:</p>
<p>“… a range of sources, some inside Iraq, that had proven reliability. We had built </p>
<p>up a consistent picture in which we had confidence. Our allies, including Europeans, </p>
<p>had no serious differences of substance with us …</p>
<p>“While we believed that UNSCOM had been able to disarticulate Iraq’s nuclear </p>
<p>programme it had not been able to account for a wide range of chemical and </p>
<p>biological materials – we were particularly worried about VX and anthrax. Even </p>
<p>conservative estimates of material Iraq still held indicated the capacity to assemble </p>
<p>thousands of WMD artillery shells. Since 1998 Iraq had continued to produce </p>
<p>new agents, develop its missile capability and, with less success, reconstitute </p>
<p>its nuclear programme.</p>
<p>“In 2002 a conscious decision was taken to deny possession of WMD to frustrate </p>
<p>a renewed and strengthened inspection programme. We had watched a policy </p>
<p>of concealment and intimidation develop. Evidence had been dispersed, factories </p>
<p>cleaned up and scientists cowed.</p>
<p>“… Some UNMOVIC successes in January resulted in further efforts to hide </p>
<p>evidence and deceive inspectors. Continued small successes forced Iraq </p>
<p>to move to a policy of slow, small concessions to give the impression of movement </p>
<p>(eg on missiles). For the UK, the litmus test would be interviews with scientists. </p>
<p>Iraq realised their knowledge was their Achilles heel, hence the intimidation.”</p>
<p><b>861. </b> President Fox was reported to have listened carefully and with an open mind. </p>
<p>Mexico wanted to continue to seek consensus. It did not like talk of action “with or </p>
<p>without the UN”; overriding international institutions had grave internal consequences </p>

<p>He wondered if the Council could set benchmarks and mentioned interviews with </p>
<p>scientists. He understood UNMOVIC had interviewed only seven scientists. “Setting </p>
<p>benchmarks … looked better than going to war over a few missiles.”</p>
<p><b>864. </b> President Lagos said that he was calling on other P5 states to assume </p>
<p>responsibility for what was going on. It was not acceptable for them to say: “We’ll </p>
<p>abstain, it’s not our war”. He had told President Chirac that was not good enough; if he </p>
<p>did not agree with the resolution, he should veto rather than shift the responsibility on </p>
<p>to others. President Chirac had sent an emissary to try to win him [Lagos] over, but he </p>
<p>thought it would be possible to work out a compromise in the Security Council “during </p>
<p>the week” and he wanted to talk through the benchmarks idea with Sir David Manning.</p>
<p><b>865. </b> Mr Blair recommended that Chile should look again at the 1999 UNSCOM </p>
<p>report which made clear the scale of outstanding material and the extent of Iraqi deceit. </p>
<p>The issues were the “unaccounted for WMD and the need for real co&#8209;operation”. The </p>
<p>missiles were “a side issue”. Saddam Hussein “had admitted their existence thinking </p>
<p>they were not in breach of sanctions”, and he “had had little choice but to destroy them </p>
<p>when UNMOVIC decided that they were”.</p>
<p><b>866. </b> Mr Blair stated that he:</p>
<p>“… took [President] Lagos’ point about the need to be precise and specific about </p>
<p>what the Security Council wanted. Otherwise people interpreted the destruction of </p>
<p>the missiles as real progress and said that we should leave the inspectors in longer.”</p>
<p><b>867. </b> President Lagos agreed. The real issue was CBW not missiles, and that should </p>
<p>be put to the international community. Mr Blair was right that Saddam Hussein was only </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating because of the pressure on him, but he wanted the P5 to “participate and </p>
<p>assume their responsibilities”.</p>
<p><b>868. </b> President Lagos added that the French political system seemed to be divided </p>
<p>on a veto: “There was an internal discourse … But the French were not producing </p>
<p>alternative ideas, they were just playing for time.” President Chirac had told him that </p>
<p>he was against any deadline at all, not just that suggested by Canada.</p>
<p><b>869. </b> Mr Blair stated that he was “in no doubt that Saddam had CBW and was </p>
<p>concealing it”, but he “accepted the need to think about how to present the case”.</p>
<p><b>870. </b> In his subsequent meeting with President Lagos, Sir David Manning was reported </p>
<p>to have set out the need to act on Iraq to prevent other potential proliferators; the </p>
<p>importance of the UN delivering after President Bush had been persuaded to go down </p>
<p>the UN route; and Saddam Hussein’s failure to take his opportunity and the continued </p>
<p>pattern of obstruction.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> Sir David “regretted” the split in the Security Council; without it, </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might have cracked. The UK saw war as a last resort and “needed a </p>

<p>second resolution because of public pressures”; it liked the Canadian idea of a deadline. </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 already contained benchmarks, but they might have to be presented </p>
<p>in a different way. Sir David had also said that, if it came to war, it would have to be </p>
<p>“through the UN and with the UN heavily involved in the aftermath”.</p>
<p><b>871. </b> Mr Scarlett was reported to have described the intelligence assessment and, </p>
<p>in response to a specific question, informed President Lagos that “although there were </p>
<p>some differences of detail e.g. over the degree to which Saddam could weaponise, </p>
<p>the French assessment was similar” to the UK’s.</p>
<p><b>872. </b> President Lagos repeated his concerns, including the difficulty of securing </p>
<p>nine votes or winning the presentational battle without further clarification of Iraq’s  </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance, and his suggestions to identify benchmarks with a short deadline. </p>
<p>Sir David Manning agreed to report the conversation to Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>873.  Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that, during February, “despite his best </b></p>
<p><b>endeavours”, divisions in the Security Council had grown not reduced; and that </b></p>
<p><b>the “dynamics of disagreement” was producing new alliances</b>. <b>France, Germany </b></p>
<p><b>and Russia were</b> <b>moving to create an alternative pole of power and influence.</b></p>
<p><b>874.  Mr Blair thought that was “highly damaging” but “inevitable”: “They felt </b></p>
<p><b>as strongly as I did; and they weren’t prepared to indulge the US, as they saw it.”</b></p>
<p><b>875.  Mr Blair concluded that for moral and strategic reasons the UK should be </b></p>
<p><b>with the US.</b></p>
<p><b>876. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had called him on 1 March “for a chat re Blix”: </p>
<p>“A combination of Blix and the recent moves by the Iraqis had got us on the back foot </p>
<p>again.” Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… felt it was all now about the politics of the UNSC, and would come down to a </p>
<p>hard&#8209;headed argument for votes. It was all going to ebb and flow but we just had </p>
<p>to keep going. He was clear that the consequences of not being with the US now </p>
<p>were incalculable.</p>
<p>“I said I felt there had been various points where we could have done something </p>
<p>different vis&#8209;a&#8209;vis the US. He said no, the only way to have had influence with them </p>
<p>was to be clear from the start that we would be with them when things got really </p>
<p>tough. He was clear that our interests were aligned.”</p>
<p>271</p>
<p><b>877. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that, “politically, as well as to put the issue beyond </p>
<p>any legal claim to the contrary, a second resolution was certainly desirable”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>338</p>
<p>February 2003, “despite his best endeavours”, divisions in the international community </p>
<p>had grown not reduced:</p>
<p>“The ten new accession countries [in the EU] came out strongly for the US </p>
<p>position … Spain and Italy both supported action. Allies of the US outside Europe </p>
<p>such as Japan and South Korea also rallied. So did many of the applicant countries </p>
<p>for NATO. Australia gave unstinting and determined support.</p>
<p>“But public opinion in many traditionally supportive countries, like Turkey was </p>
<p>strongly anti. Canada decided they couldn’t support without a new resolution, </p>
<p>as did Mexico …</p>
<p>“Basically, there were nations for whom the American alliance was a fundamental </p>
<p>part of their foreign policy. They tended to back the US. Then there were those </p>
<p>for whom the alliance was important, but not fundamental. They backed off … </p>
<p>the dynamics of disagreement then started to fashion new alliances, with France, </p>
<p>Germany and Russia, in particular, moving to create an alternative pole of power </p>
<p>and influence.”</p>
<p><b>878. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“I thought this was highly damaging; but I also understood it was inevitable. They </p>
<p>felt as strongly as I did; and they weren’t prepared to indulge the US, as they saw </p>
<p>it. They thought conflict would harm relations between the West and Islam, and of </p>
<p>course the more they said this, the more they rather played into that analysis and </p>
<p>strengthened it.</p>
<p>“… I agreed with the basic US analysis of Saddam as a threat; I thought he was a </p>
<p>monster; and to break the US partnership in such circumstances, when America’s </p>
<p>key allies were all rallying round, would in my view, then (and now) have done major </p>
<p>long&#8209;term damage to that relationship.</p>
<p>“I had one last throw of the dice. The problem which sensible opinion had with it </p>
<p>all was the feeling that it was a rush to war … the US position was that this was </p>
<p>all very well but … they couldn’t simply wait until a diplomatic dance, which they </p>
<p>had fair evidence for thinking would be interminable, was played out. Their position </p>
<p>was: resolution 1441 was a final chance; if he didn’t take it; if we give him time, we </p>
<p>just allow him to mess us around as he has before; he won’t reform; we’re kidding </p>
<p>ourselves if we think he will; so let’s go and get the job done.</p>
<p>“The inspectors’ reports were at best inconclusive, but they certainly weren’t </p>
<p>evidence of ‘immediate, unconditional and active compliance’. The US was </p>
<p>champing at the bit. President Bush was actually losing support by waiting. The </p>
<p>international community was split. The party was split. I was between numerous </p>
<p>rocks and hard places.</p>

<p>339</p>
<p>“The strain on everyone around me was almost unbearable …</p>
<p>“Gradually I did deal with it. I sat and reasoned it all through. I knew in the final </p>
<p>analysis I would be with the US, because it was right morally and strategically. </p>
<p>But we should make a last ditch attempt for a peaceful solution. First to make </p>
<p>the moral case for removing Saddam … Second, to try one more time to reunite </p>
<p>the international community behind a clear base for action in the event of a </p>
<p>continuing breach.”</p>
<p><b>879. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had telephoned him at 7:45am on 3 March </p>
<p>and was:</p>
<p>“… even more worried than he had been on Friday. He felt things were just not </p>
<p>where they needed to be. David M[anning] and John Scarlett came back from their </p>
<p>weekend trip … both countries were very firmly on the fence and could see no </p>
<p>reason to come off it. TB said it was still possible we could get a majority on the </p>
<p>UNSC but if it was in circumstances where people felt we bullied and arm&#8209;twisted, </p>
<p>the French would be less worried about putting down a veto. The Americans were </p>
<p>frankly alienating people by their tactics. David M said the message these smaller </p>
<p>countries got was the basic assumption from the Americans that they would come </p>
<p>over in the end.</p>
<p>“I said … that our problem on the communications front was largely caused </p>
<p>by US friendly fire … They looked the whole time like they were desperate for </p>
<p>war. We at least didn’t look like we were desperate for war, but we did look like </p>
<p>we were desperate to be with them … TB said he would have to tell Bush that it </p>
<p>was not possible to get the votes at the moment. It was totally what they didn’t </p>
<p>want to hear but they had to hear it from someone. He was very down on the </p>
<p>Americans … I sensed they were becoming irritated with us …”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>880. </b> Mr Campbell added that the destruction of missiles had “tipped the balance” </p>
<p>of public opinion “towards giving the inspectors more time”. Mr Blair was “moving </p>
<p>to the Canadian position of a bit more time to get the questions finally answered”.</p>
<p><b>881.  Mr Straw proposed an offer of safety and immunity if Saddam Hussein would </b></p>

<p><b>882. </b> Mr Straw spoke twice to Secretary Powell on 2 March to discuss progress </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>883. </b> In a discussion on the position of Russia, Secretary Powell said that Mr Ivanov had </p>
<p>stated that there was nothing in it for Russia to vote for the second resolution. It meant </p>
<p>an end to inspections and Iraq’s neighbours were not threatened by Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>884. </b> In the context of remarks reported to have been made during a visit to China, </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had asked Mr Ivanov if Russia would veto the second resolution. </p>
<p>Mr Ivanov had responded, “You know me better than that”; he had simply been </p>
<p>explaining that, under the UN Charter, Russia had the right of veto but he had avoided </p>
<p>getting drawn into whether it would be used. Secretary Powell would be urging President </p>
<p>Bush to speak to President Putin.</p>
<p><b>885. </b> Mr Straw reported that he had told Secretary Powell that the level of support in </p>
<p>the UK for military action without a second resolution was palpably “very low”. In that </p>
<p>circumstance, even if a majority in the Security Council had voted for the resolution with </p>
<p>only France exercising its veto, he was “increasingly pessimistic about whether we could </p>
<p>carry the Party” to support military action.</p>
<p><b>886. </b> Mr Straw added that the debate in the UK was:</p>
<p>“… significantly defined by the tone of the debate in Washington and particularly </p>
<p>remarks made by the President and others to the right of him, which suggested that </p>
<p>the US would go to war whatever and was not bothered about a second resolution </p>
<p>one way or another.”</p>
<p><b>887. </b> Mr Straw had proposed consideration of additional language in the second </p>
<p>resolution “pledging immunity to Saddam and entourage if he were to leave Iraq by a </p>
<p>specific date”. Secretary Powell had declined, commenting that he did not think Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would agree.</p>
<p><b>888. </b> Mr Straw sought Mr Blair’s agreement to adding an ultimatum to the draft </p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>889. </b> Mr Straw wrote: “Things may be moving towards a majority but I will not believe </p>
<p>it until it happens”, There were concerns that the draft resolution looked like a “fait </p>
<p>accompli” and a “blank cheque for war”. Key potential allies “needed a better reason” for </p>
<p>supporting the resolution.</p>
<p><b>890. </b> Mr Straw’s view was that the language in the resolution on performance targets </p>
<p>and deadlines would not be acceptable “to either US or UK for obvious reasons”, but he </p>
<p>had “two thoughts”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an offer, subject to legal advice, of safety and immunity if Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>would go into exile; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>returning to the earlier idea of setting out publicly some key benchmarks against </p>
<p>which Iraq’s “full and active” compliance could be judged.</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>341</p>
<p><b>891. </b> Mr Straw thought that an ultimatum had “significant” advantages: “It would indicate </p>
<p>that we still wanted a peaceful outcome to the crisis; help get the moderate Arabs on </p>
<p>board; help our friends on the Security Council; and put France especially on the spot.” </p>
<p>It might make France “think twice about a veto”; “they knew as well as we did that he </p>
<p>[Saddam Hussein] was only likely to take it [the final opportunity offered in resolution </p>
<p>1441] when he knew for certain there was no other way out”.</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Mr Straw suggested that the “clusters” document could be turned to the UK’s </p>
<p>advantage by “setting out a few carefully selected tests” and pointing to the document for </p>
<p>further amplification. There was a risk that Saddam Hussein might produce “thousands </p>
<p>of pages of commentary” and the UK would need to keep the emphasis on the need for </p>
<p>“compelling evidence that he was now committed to full and active compliance”.</p>
<p><b>893. </b> Mr Straw advised that, to “be credible with the middle ground”, his proposals </p>
<p>would need “another week or two” to “convince some of the crucial swing voters”. </p>
<p>In his view, that might “be possible without disrupting the military plan”.</p>
<p><b>894.  On 3 March, Mr Blair proposed an approach focused on setting a deadline </b></p>
<p><b>of 17 March for Iraq to disclose evidence relating to the destruction of prohibited </b></p>
<p><b>items and interviews; and an amnesty if Saddam Hussein left by 21 March.</b></p>
<p><b>895. </b> In a conversation with Mr Jan Peter Balkenende, the Dutch Prime Minister, </p>
<p>Mr Blair commented that “Saddam was still playing around”; and that he was “struck by </p>
<p>the parallels with 1997&#8209;98”.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> The “situation would be clearer by the middle of the week”; </p>
<p>the UK was “working flat out to get the votes in the Security Council”. Mr Blair stated </p>
<p>that “a majority in the Security Council with a French veto would be almost as good </p>
<p>as a SCR”. He hoped the French were carefully considering the implications of a veto. </p>
<p>“Unless Saddam co&#8209;operated in full, the inspectors would never find all the WMD: </p>
<p>the history of UNSCOM showed a pattern of Iraqi concealment and deceit.”</p>
<p><b>896. </b> In a conversation with Mr Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish Prime Minister, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated that “the ‘middle group’ in the Security Council was moving in the right </p>
<p>direction. We needed to focus on the facts that Saddam had still not accounted for the </p>
<p>WMD identified by UNSCOM up to 1998 and no real interviews of scientists had taken </p>
<p>place.”</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>897. </b> Mr Blair also told Mr Rasmussen that he thought the timing “would move pretty </p>
<p>quickly – days rather than weeks” after Dr Blix’s report on 7 March; and that the </p>
<p>Americans would take action if there was no further resolution.</p>
<p><b>898. </b> Mr Rycroft sought Mr Blair’s agreement to a strategy to secure the Chilean vote, </p>
<p>adding that if that was obtained, “we will probably also get the Mexicans”. President </p>

<p>Lagos was “In particular … looking for a little more time and a report from Blix judging </p>
<p>Saddam’s compliance against specific benchmarks”.</p>
<p><b>899. </b> Mr Rycroft suggested that the three main elements of a strategy could be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>A slight change to the draft resolution</b>.” We could add in explicit references </p>
<p>to the reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei, concluding that they confirmed </p>
<p>either that Saddam Hussein had “failed to comply with, and co&#8209;operate fully in </p>
<p>the implementation” of resolution 1441, or that Iraq had “failed to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity” afforded by the resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Benchmarks</b>.” Making public “in the next day or so what is required of </p>
<p>Saddam in one or more key areas”. The benchmarks would not be set out in the </p>
<p>resolution but the date of the vote would provide a deadline for compliance. That </p>
<p>would allow Chile to say that “as there is not full compliance”, it would vote for </p>
<p>the resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Offer of exile/amnesty to Saddam</b>.” Making “clear publicly again that we are </p>
<p>not intent on war come what may, and that we are determined to explore every </p>
<p>last avenue for peace. This includes making clear that we support Arab attempts </p>
<p>to get Saddam to leave Iraq and go into exile in exchange for an amnesty.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Setting Saddam Hussein a deadline of 17 March for disclosure of documentation </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Presenting the “20 best” scientists for interview outside Iraq, with their families </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>A “launch” following Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council on 7 March in Chile </p>

<p>this report.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>902. </b> A separate minute from Mr Rycroft, stating “You asked for a plan we could </p>
<p>work up with the Mexicans and Chileans, as a way of bringing them to vote for the </p>
<p>second resolution”, elaborated on the suggestion of identifying benchmarks to define </p>
<p>“full co&#8209;operation”, making clear that judgements were for the Security Council; </p>
<p>and that Dr Blix’s reports “would form an important basis for the facts underpinning </p>
<p>the judgements”.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>903. </b> Mr Rycroft added that that differed from previous work on benchmarks because </p>
<p>it was “us” not Dr Blix “putting forward the benchmarks and answering the questions </p>
<p>on Iraqi compliance”.</p>
<p><b>904. </b> The minute set out the key demands in resolution 1441 and a note listing </p>
<p>benchmarks on biological weapons, chemical weapons, missiles, documentation </p>
<p>and personnel. On tactics and timing, Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“we face an uphill struggle securing US agreement to any further time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The judgements on Iraqi performance “must not” be tied to Dr Blix’s report </p>
<p>to the Security Council on 7 March, and the UK should not “seek or encourage </p>
<p>a further Blix report after 7 March”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “must avoid at all costs a further Council decision after our </p>
<p>second resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “could be vague publicly about when we would judge Iraqi behaviour”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “would have to make clear privately to the US that we were talking about </p>
<p>making those judgements at some point next week or at the latest early in the </p>
<p>week of 17 March”.</p>
<p><b>905. </b> Mr Rycroft also wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir David Manning had not seen the proposals.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw wanted to talk to Mr Blair “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO opposed benchmarks on the grounds that Saddam Hussein would fulfil </p>
<p>a few of them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK needed to make clear that “full, positive answers to all of the questions” </p>
<p>would be needed to demonstrate full co&#8209;operation – “destruction of a handful </p>
<p>of Al Samouds is a small part of the picture”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock should advise on the tactics: “His advice so far is that </p>
<p>we should not respond to the Chilean concerns until after 7 March, because </p>
<p>it may be unnecessary if by then the Chileans intend to vote for our resolution </p>
<p>and because it would cause a split with the US …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>906. </b> Following a discussion with Mr Blair, Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… was concerned that, having shifted world (and British) public opinion over the </p>
<p>months, it had now been seriously set back in recent days. We were not in the right </p>
<p>position. The Prime Minister was considering a number of ideas which he might well </p>
<p>put to the President.”</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>907. </b> Mr Straw recorded that Secretary Powell had advised that if Mr Blair wanted </p>
<p>to make proposals, he should do so quickly.</p>
<p><b>908. </b> Mr Straw also recorded that the US was not enthusiastic about the inclusion of </p>
<p>an immunity clause for Saddam Hussein in the resolution. He had told Secretary Powell </p>
<p>that Mr Blair had thought that “might be seen as premature”; and that “if necessary” </p>
<p>it might be done “at the appropriate time in a separate resolution”.</p>
<p><b>909. </b> Mr Straw reported that he and Secretary Powell had discussed the problems </p>
<p>in the UK. Secretary Powell had told President Bush that he judged a vetoed resolution </p>
<p>would no longer be possible for the UK. Mr Straw said that he had been told that, without </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix would circulate the “clusters” document to the Security Council </p>
<p>on 7 March, but the work programme would not be ready.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix was concerned that while it was possible to establish material balances </p>
<p>up to 1998, it was less clear how Iraq’s flat denial of any activity since then </p>
<p>should be treated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was being “hyper&#8209;active”; there has been some private interviews over </p>
<p>the previous weekend, one of which – on UAVs – had been “informative”. </p>
<p>In response to UK questions reflecting concerns that interviews would still </p>
<p>be monitored, Dr Blix said that interviewees had not been searched and </p>
<p>“there could of course be bugs in the room”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix saw attractions in the Canadian proposal, which would help to unite </p>
<p>the Council around key tests, which were becoming evident from the “clusters” </p>
<p>document, and a deadline; and had mentioned possible deadlines of 1 May </p>
<p>or 1 June.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had argued that the risk was that “we would simply end up back </p>
<p>at square one a couple of months hence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In a separate E10 discussion of the Canadian proposal, Germany had declared </p>
<p>it could not countenance an ultimatum and others “had not seemed particularly </p>
<p>interested, perhaps as it brought the Council back to the same place in the end”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The majority of the E10 were more concerned about US statements the previous </p>
<p>weekend that the aim of US action was regime change.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p><b>913. </b> In separate advice “on the end game options”, Sir Jeremy Greenstock stated that </p>
<p>there was little chance of bridging the gap with the French – “senior politicians were </p>
<p>dug in too deep”; and that a French veto appeared “more of a danger than failure to get </p>
<p>nine votes”.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>914. </b> Sir Jeremy had told Mr Annan that “the UK would not give up on finding a non&#8209;war </p>
<p>route if we possibly could”; and that “the French/German/Russian proposal … merely </p>
<p>diminished the pressure on Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>915. </b> Sir Jeremy identified the options as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… stay firm … and go with the US military campaign in the second half of </p>
<p>March with the best arguments we can muster … if a second resolution … is </p>
<p>unobtainable, we fall back on 1441 and regret that the UN was not up to it …”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… make some small concessions that might just be enough to get, e.g. Chile </p>
<p>and Mexico on board”. The “most obvious step” might be “ultimatum language” </p>
<p>making military action the default if the Council did not agree that Iraq had come </p>
<p>into compliance with resolution 1441;</p>

<p>(and avoid placing too much weight on Blix’s shoulders)”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… putting forward a second resolution not authorising force”, although it was </p>
<p>clear that Sir Jeremy envisaged there would be an “eventual use of force”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… a peaceful introduction of forces into Iraq for the purposes of complete </p>
<p>disarmament”. That would be a “genuine last resort”, which would “cut across </p>
<p>the short&#8209;term timetable of the Americans and could only be feasible if there was </p>
<p>a genuine wish to avoid an international bust&#8209;up.” As Saddam Hussein would be </p>
<p>unlikely to co&#8209;operate, it would be a longer route to military action.</p>
<p><b>916. </b> Commenting that the talk of vetoes “may be as much to scare us off as an </p>
<p>indication of genuine voting intentions”, Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“We will need to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remain robust that disarmament must be achieved, that there is very little </p>
<p>time left, and that we are willing to contemplate military action without a </p>

<p><b>917. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded: “So long as we have enough swing votes, the simplest route </p>

<p><b>918. </b> Mr Ricketts told Mr Straw that he and Sir David Manning had discussed </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy’s telegrams and believed that the “best package” might comprise:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adding a deadline to the draft resolution requiring “a bit more time”. A US </p>
<p>suggestion “that Iraq should have ‘unconditionally disarmed’ in ten days” would </p>
<p>be “seen as unreasonable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A small number of carefully chosen benchmarks “set out separately from the </p>
<p>resolution, ideally by the Chileans and Mexicans … We could then use the </p>
<p>clusters document to illustrate how little compliance there had been across </p>
<p>the board.”</p>

<p>347</p>
<p><b>919. </b> On 4 March, Sir David Manning and Dr Rice discussed progress in securing </p>
<p>support for the resolution, including the desire of some members of the Security Council </p>
<p>for clear evidence of Saddam’s failure to comply to justify a vote for a second resolution </p>
<p>and possible amendments.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> Sir David said that “interviews were a litmus test of </p>
<p>Saddam’s intentions”; UNMOVIC “would be having no difficulties … if Saddam had </p>
<p>nothing to hide”. He also suggested pre&#8209;empting the argument that Dr Blix’s “clusters” </p>
<p>document might provide the benchmark needed for full Iraqi disarmament: “Instead </p>
<p>we should emphasise that Blix was producing a list … of all the disarmament tasks that </p>
<p>Saddam had failed to undertake …”</p>
<p><b>920. </b> Sir David told Dr Rice that the vote on the resolution should not take place until </p>
<p>“we knew we could get nine votes”.</p>
<p><b>921.  Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee on 4 March that it was “a matter </b></p>
<p><b>of fact” that Iraq had been in material breach “for some weeks” and resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441 provided sufficient legal authority to justify military action against Iraq if it </b></p>
<p><b>was “in further material breach”. He emphasised Iraq’s attempts to conceal its </b></p>
<p><b>capabilities and deceive the inspectors.</b></p>
<p><b>922.  Mr Straw also stated that a majority of members of the Security Council had </b></p>
<p><b>been opposed to the suggestion that resolution 1441 should state explicitly that </b></p>
<p><b>military action could be taken only if there were a second resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>923. </b> Mr Straw gave evidence to the Foreign Affairs Committee on 4 March.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>924. </b> In an opening statement setting out the UK Government’s position on Iraq’s failure </p>
<p>to comply with resolution 1441, Mr Straw said that Saddam Hussein’s tactics had been:</p>
<p>“… to deny the existence of weapons of mass destruction and, if caught out, to </p>
<p>offer the smallest concession possible in order to work for delay … We can expect </p>
<p>more concessions right up to the point at which Saddam Hussein concludes that </p>
<p>the international community has, once again, been lured into doing exactly what </p>
<p>he wants. Then the concessions will stop, and Saddam Hussein will be left in </p>
<p>possession of an arsenal of deadly weapons.”</p>
<p><b>925. </b> Mr Straw stated that it was assessed that Iraq had the capability to produce </p>
<p>a range of chemical and biological agents and:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi regime has put up an elaborate screen of concealment based on </p>
<p>intimidation and deception to cover this capability … [W]e know that sensitive </p>
<p>materials and documents have been hidden in the homes of employees and </p>
<p>hidden too in hospitals, farms and other sites. Intelligence also suggests that </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>348</p>
<p>Iraq’s security and intelligence agencies have been monitoring UNMOVIC and the </p>
<p>IAEA and plans are available to obstruct them if they come close to WMD itself … </p>
<p>Iraq is particularly concerned about … interviews of scientists and others because if </p>
<p>they were carried out as mandated by [resolution] 1441 they would unquestionably </p>
<p>expose the regime’s deception and its stockpile of weapons … In early December we </p>
<p>know that Saddam Hussein issued instructions that scientists were to be threatened </p>
<p>with serious consequences for themselves and their families if they revealed </p>
<p>any sensitive information to UNMOVIC. They were ordered not to agree to any </p>
<p>interviews taking place outside Iraq … The potential witnesses have been coached </p>
<p>in the answers they have to give. Some of them have been removed from their </p>
<p>homes and places of work and detained to prevent them from being interviewed.”</p>
<p><b>926. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“… we can expect Iraq will continue trickling out so&#8209;called concessions, one at </p>
<p>a time, at the last minute to split the Security Council and buy more time while </p>
<p>continuing an active policy of concealment; to start trickling out ‘newly discovered’ </p>
<p>documents as part of a co&#8209;ordinated plan to tie down UNMOVIC on what the regime </p>
<p>considers to be expendable parts of its WMD programme. We can also expect Iraq </p>
<p>soon to announce that interviews may take place unaccompanied …”</p>
<p><b>927. </b> Mr Straw concluded that it was clear that:</p>
<p>“… Saddam Hussein believes he can once again divide and outwit the international </p>
<p>community through a pretence of co&#8209;operation. We cannot afford to send him … </p>
<p>any signal, that he is close to success … He is also hoping that he final opportunity, </p>
<p>which was originally afforded to him 12 years ago and then repeated by 1441, was </p>
<p>not final at all …”</p>
<p><b>928. </b> Mr Straw was asked a series of questions by Mr Donald Anderson, the Chairman </p>
<p>of the Committee, about the legality of military action without a second resolution.</p>
<p><b>929. </b> Asked about Mr Blair’s “escape clause” and whether the Government “would </p>
<p>not feel bound to await” a second resolution “or to abide by it if it were to be vetoed </p>
<p>unreasonably”, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“The reason why we have drawn a parallel with Kosovo is … it was not possible to </p>
<p>get a direct Security Council resolution and instead the Government and those that </p>
<p>participated in the action had to fall back on previous … resolutions and general </p>
<p>international law … to justify the action that was taken … We are satisfied that we </p>
<p>have sufficient legal authority in 1441 back to the originating resolution 660 [1990] … </p>
<p>to justify military action against Iraq if they are in further material breach.”</p>
<p><b>930. </b> Mr Straw added that was “clearly laid down and it was anticipated when we put </p>
<p>1441 together”. The Government would “much prefer” military action, if that proved </p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>349</p>
<p>necessary, “to be backed by a second resolution”, but it had had to reserve its options if </p>
<p>such a second resolution did not prove possible. That was what Mr Blair had “spelt out”.</p>
<p><b>931. </b> Asked if the Government should proceed without the express authority of the UN, </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“We believe there is express authority … There was a … a very intensive debate </p>
<p>– about whether … 1441 should say explicitly … that military action to enforce </p>
<p>this resolution could only be taken if there were a second resolution. That … was </p>
<p>not acceptable to a majority of members of the Security Council, it was never put </p>
<p>before the … Council. Instead … what the Council has to do … is to consider </p>
<p>the situation …”</p>
<p><b>932. </b> Mr Straw told Sir Patrick Cormack (Conservative) that Iraq had “been in material </p>
<p>breach as a matter of fact for some weeks now because they were told they had to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate immediately, unconditionally and actively”. He added:</p>
<p>“… we are anxious to gain a political consensus, if that can be achieved … </p>
<p>which recognises the state of Iraq’s flagrant violation of its obligations. As far as </p>
<p>… the British Government is concerned, that is a matter of fact; the facts speak </p>
<p>for themselves.”</p>
<p><b>933. </b> Mr Straw also stated:</p>
<p>“What we also believe, because we want this crisis resolved peacefully, is that </p>
<p>the only way you are going to get this active, immediate and full co&#8209;operation by </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, even at this late stage, is if he realises fully what the alternative </p>
<p>is … [F]or all the suggestions that it is diplomacy that has brought about what </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation there has been … it has come about … above all, by the fact that </p>
<p>there are now a large number of US and UK troops stationed on Saddam’s doorstep </p>
<p>concentrating his mind.”</p>
<p><b>934. </b> Asked by Mr Andrew MacKinlay (Labour) how there was going to be “proper </p>
<p>conscious decision&#8209;making” about whether Iraq was complying, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“… we make our judgement on the basis of the best evidence. I have to say it </p>
<p>was on the basis of the best evidence that the international community made its </p>
<p>judgement on 8 November. They had hundreds of pages of reports …”</p>
<p><b>935. </b> Mr Straw also told Mr Mackinley that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“by simply passing …1441” Saddam Hussein “readmitted the inspectors having </p>
<p>said he would not”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“I have seen nothing at all which says we have to take action immediately </p>
<p>because of military planning necessities. The point we are making … is </p>
<p>that the reason we want immediate compliance is because that is what the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>Security Council said … 110 days … is stretching the meaning of the word </p>
<p>‘immediate’ to breaking point.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France took “the view that it was possible by continuous diplomacy to secure </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s compliance. We take a different view. I think the facts and </p>
<p>history are with us.”</p>
<p><b>IAEA position on Iraq’s nuclear programme</b></p>
<p>The FCO advised No.10 on 4 March that the UK Mission in Vienna had confirmed </p>
<p>that the IAEA was on the verge of closing the file on nuclear issues in Iraq, despite </p>
<p>information from the UK that had “still not been followed up”.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> The IAEA had apparently </p>
<p>concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no significant evidence that Iraq had attempted to procure uranium </p>
<p>from Niger”. The documents the IAEA had seen “that formed the basis of such </p>
<p>an allegation appeared to be forgeries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Aluminium tubes, “although imported illegally”, were “not connected with a gas </p>
<p>centrifuge programme”. The Iraqis had “satisfactorily explained the use of the </p>
<p>tubes, and the reasons for their various fine tolerances”. The Iraqis “were no </p>
<p>longer (if ever) in a position to manufacture a gas centrifuge, especially without </p>
<p>foreign assistance”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence to link the magnets with a covert nuclear programme”; </p>
<p>the IAEA had found the part in the guidance system of a missile.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had evidence that a significant amount of the missing 32 tonnes of </p>
<p>HMX (a high explosive used to help trigger nuclear fission), had been used for </p>
<p>commercial purposes, as the Iraqis had claimed”.</p>
<p><b>The positions of other members of the Security Council</b></p>

<p><b>the US and UK mustering the nine positive votes required for a majority in the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>937. </b> Sir John Holmes confirmed on 4 March that France’s main aim was to “avoid being </p>
<p>put on the spot” by influencing the undecided, preventing the US and UK mustering nine </p>
<p>votes, and keeping alongside the Russians and Chinese; and that there was “nothing </p>
<p>that we can now do to dissuade them from this course”.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> He advised that “nothing the </p>
<p>French say at this stage, even privately, should be taken at face value”.</p>
<p><b>938. </b> If the French strategy failed, Sir John advised that “a lone French veto remains </p>
<p>hard to imagine but is by no means out of the question”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>351</p>
<p><b>939. </b> Sir John repeated his advice of 24 February that Mr Blair (and President Bush) </p>
<p>should, “if and when it becomes clear that we have the votes, and that the Russians </p>
<p>and Chinese will not veto”, attempt to dissuade President Chirac.</p>
<p><b>940. </b> A subsequent telegram set out the key elements of the French position and the </p>
<p>suggestions for arguments the UK might use.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France had repeatedly said that war was the worst of all possible solutions, </p>
<p>but “war had been made more likely by Saddam’s ability to exploit differences </p>
<p>in the international community”. The chances of Saddam Hussein taking the </p>
<p>opportunity to avoid war looked “slim”. A veto would not help and “the only </p>
<p>conceivable way of achieving a peaceful solution now is to increase the pressure </p>
<p>on Saddam by re&#8209;establishing the maximum degree of consensus in the UN”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France had argued that war was a disproportionate response to the threat posed </p>
<p>by Saddam Hussein’s WMD, but the point had been reached where failure to </p>
<p>act firmly caused “disproportionate damage to the credibility of the will of the </p>
<p>international community and to wider efforts to limit the proliferation of WMD”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If war became inevitable, it would be easier to “limit the destabilising effect </p>
<p>elsewhere in the region, about which France has rightly been concerned, </p>
<p>if military intervention is seen to be taken with the authority of the </p>
<p>international community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Weakening UN credibility would make it more difficult “to re&#8209;establish the clear </p>
<p>and authoritative UN&#8209;backed administration and the rapid transition to a civil </p>
<p>regime in Iraq … and more difficult for Europe to play the role the region and </p>
<p>the world will need at that point”.</p>
<p><b>941. </b> Separately, Dr Michael Williams, Mr Straw’s Special Adviser, sent Mr Straw </p>
<p>an analysis of the use of the veto by France.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> He did not think France would veto </p>
<p>on its own; but if it believed Moscow would veto, the second resolution would be lost. </p>
<p>It was “perhaps most likely, if the yes votes creep up to nine and beyond”, that </p>
<p>France would “back down and say it accepts a majority verdict”. But the UK could </p>
<p>not rely on that. Dr Williams advised that a strategy was needed which reminded </p>
<p>France “of the dangers and consequences of its present course of action”; and that </p>
<p>would need Mr Blair’s engagement.</p>
<p><b>942. </b> The analysis was sent to Sir David Manning and was seen by Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>943.  Sir Roderic Lyne, British Ambassador to Russia, had reported on 27 February </b></p>

<p><b>944. </b> Sir Roderic had reported on 27 February that: “Influenced by Paris and Berlin”, </p>
<p>Russia’s position was hardening and it “largely agreed with” President Chirac. The policy </p>
<p>was “to stay with (and behind) the French and Germans while trying not to antagonise </p>
<p>the Americans”. Russia recognised that US action was “not far off”: “Their preferred </p>
<p>option is to prevent nine positive votes and thus avoid an awkward choice on the veto.” </p>
<p>Russia was “unlikely to be the first to break ranks”, and it seemed “far&#8209;fetched” to </p>

<p>dangerous, and part of a right wing ‘axis&#8209;of&#8209;evil’ agenda … no&#8209;one to the right of the </p>
<p>Communists is arguing that Russia should obstruct the Americans. The prevailing </p>
<p>mood is that Russia should not endorse the war, but should stand to one side …”</p>
<p><b>946. </b> President Putin “would find it very hard to justify internally a vote in favour of war, </p>
<p>absent a smoking gun or a Security Council near&#8209;consensus”. The Russians did “worry </p>
<p>about the UN’s authority”; but they did not “buy our argument that this obliges them </p>
<p>to support the US regardless”. They would “prefer it if we were forced not to put our </p>
<p>resolution to the vote”.</p>
<p><b>947. </b> Sir Roderic concluded:</p>
<p>“The best, and probably the only, chance of getting the Russians onside </p>

<p><b>951. </b> In response to a comment from Mr Ivanov that President Bush had already decided </p>
<p>to go to war, Mr Straw responded that President Bush “would go to war unless – and the </p>
<p>unless had to be big and happen quickly”.</p>
<p><b>952. </b> In a discussion on the draft resolution, Mr Straw stated that the UK had never </p>
<p>taken the position that draft text was “take it or leave it”. He had no problem in principle </p>
<p>with tough benchmarks and a very tight timeline; but if an initial 120 days was followed </p>
<p>by another 120 days, “momentum would dribble away. Saddam Hussein only responded </p>
<p>because of military pressure and that could not be sustained for ever.</p>
<p><b>953. </b> Mr Straw proposed additional language for the draft resolution setting a deadline </p>
<p>for a Security Council decision on whether Iraq had “clearly begun the process of full </p>
<p>active disarmament as provided by [resolutions 1441 and 687]”, together with a “private </p>
<p>understanding about the targets Iraq had to reach”. Mr Straw was reported to have said </p>
<p>that he was “very allergic to timelines and public benchmarks” which “could lead to a tick </p>
<p>in the box mentality by Saddam and good opportunities for further game playing”.</p>
<p><b>954. </b> In his subsequent discussion with Secretary Powell, Mr Straw said that he had told </p>
<p>Mr Ivanov that he thought war could be avoided if Saddam went into exile and there was </p>
<p>real evidence that Iraq was co&#8209;operating in its own disarmament.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>955. </b> Later in the conversation, in response to a question about why Iraq was being </p>
<p>targeted, Mr Straw had replied that “Iraq was President Bush’s No.1 priority; the </p>
<p>international community had no choice but to pay attention to Bush’s priorities”.</p>
<p><b>956.  Mr Ivanov told Mr Blair that Russia was looking for concrete demands and </b></p>
<p><b>a decision on how much time was needed to resolve the issues.</b></p>
<p><b>957. </b> In his meeting with Mr Ivanov on 5 March, Mr Blair explained that the threat </p>
<p>from terrorist groups and unstable states meant that Iraq must be dealt with firmly.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The issue was whether Iraq was co&#8209;operating to the extent required by resolution 1441. </p>
<p>If the UN route did not work on this occasion, the US would not use it for a very long </p>
<p>time. If Saddam Hussein made a genuine change, the inspectors could have as much </p>
<p>time as they liked.</p>
<p><b>958. </b> Mr Ivanov had made it clear that Russia was looking for concrete demands and a </p>
<p>decision on how much time was needed to resolve all the issues; and that Russia would </p>
<p>not be able to support any decision that ran counter to its principles.</p>
<p><b>959. </b> The record described the meeting as “constructive”, but that “everything </p>
<p>that Ivanov said was consistent with his public threat of the use of a Russian veto </p>
<p>of our current draft”.</p>

<p><b>960. </b> Mr Straw agreed after the meeting with Mr Blair that Mr Ivanov could share </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s proposals with Mr de Villepin and Mr Fischer.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>961.  France, Germany and Russia stated on 5 March that they would not let </b></p>

<p><b>962. </b> Mr de Villepin, Mr Ivanov and Mr Fischer met in Paris on 5 March.</p>
<p><b>963. </b> In a press conference after the meeting the Foreign Ministers declared that they </p>
<p>would “not allow a resolution to pass that authorises resorting to force”.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> Russia </p>
<p>and France, “as Permanent Members of the Security Council, will assume all their </p>
<p>responsibilities on this point”.</p>
<p><b>964.  Sir Christopher Hum, British Ambassador to China, advised on 4 March that </b></p>
<p><b>if the resolution was put to a vote that day, China would abstain.</b></p>
<p><b>965. </b> Mr William Ehrman, FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence and </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Special Envoy, met the Chinese Vice Foreign Minister, Mr Wang Guangya, </p>
<p>and a senior official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), on 4 March.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>966. </b> The report of the meeting with Mr Wang records that, following a briefing on </p>
<p>the UK’s assessment of Iraq’s non&#8209;co&#8209;operation and the need for a second resolution, </p>
<p>China’s view was that Iraq must bear the major responsibility for failing to co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>fully, but believed inspections should be given more time. Although it might take longer </p>
<p>to resolve the issue by peaceful means, the time taken would be worth it. There was </p>
<p>a common desire amongst the international community to avoid war. Unanimity was </p>
<p>important for upholding the authority of the UN. China was still studying the draft </p>
<p>resolution. Pressing for a vote now would split the Council and harm its authority.</p>
<p><b>967. </b> Mr Ehrman had referred to the points emphasised by Mr Blair in his speech to </p>
<p>Parliament on 25 February. He told Mr Wang that Saddam Hussein’s behaviour since </p>
<p>the middle of 2002, when he had directed the implementation of a concealment policy, </p>
<p>had been “instructive”; and Saddam’s aim was to buy time. Mr Ehrman described </p>
<p>key elements of the concealment policy and stated that much of the evidence in the </p>
<p>UK’s September 2002 dossier “had been supported or confirmed subsequently by </p>
<p>UNMOVIC (for example the range of the Al Samoud 2 rockets)”. Despite Iraq’s efforts, </p>
<p>the UN inspectors had found a number of undeclared items and “Iraq itself had ‘found’ </p>
<p>four empty chemical warheads and one aerial bomb containing biological agent”. Iraq </p>
<p>was particularly concerned about interviews with scientists because “if carried out as </p>
<p>mandated they would expose Iraq’s WMD programme” and had obstructed the process. </p>
<p>The UK “judged it unlikely that Saddam would leave” and “faced with military defeat, </p>

<p>afforded to him by … 1441”.</p>
<p><b>968. </b> Mr Ehrman set out the UK difficulties with the tripartite French/German/Russian </p>
<p>proposal and stated that the UK/US/Spanish resolution “would increase pressure on </p>
<p>Iraq”. There was still a chance for Iraq to take radical action to disarm and the resolution </p>
<p>“was the only remaining route to peaceful disarmament”.</p>
<p><b>969. </b> In the separate meeting with a senior MFA official, Mr Ehrman had repeated </p>
<p>the briefing and emphasised the importance of preserving international order and </p>
<p>international law. The UK had made great efforts in persuading the US that it should </p>
<p>use the UN route; that “should not now be lost”.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Mr Hum advised that China had “appreciated” the UK’s willingness to share its </p>
<p>assessments; but that “if a vote occurred today, I have little doubt they would abstain”.</p>
<p><b>971.  Baroness Amos advised on 4 March that Angola, Cameroon and Guinea were </b></p>
<p><b>not yet ready to commit to a “yes vote” and had emphasised the need for P5 unity.</b></p>
<p><b>972. </b> Following a visit for discussions with the Presidents of Angola, Cameroon and </p>
<p>Guinea, Baroness Amos reported to Mr Straw that:</p>
<p>“… our approach to the visits was right with a focus on our strong relationship with </p>
<p>Africa … our desire to work with each of the countries in partnership and to share </p>
<p>intelligence information available to us about the situation in Iraq …</p>
<p>“All three listened carefully to our arguments, in particular the need to keep the </p>
<p>UN in control of events, to keep the US engaged in multilateral fora and that the </p>
<p>harassment and intimidation faced by the weapons inspectors made a nonsense </p>
<p>of a longer inspection regime.”</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>973. </b> Baroness Amos wrote: “I think we won the argument”; and that:</p>
<p>“… it might be possible to secure the votes. But – as expected – none of the three </p>
<p>were prepared to commit themselves explicitly to a yes vote … They would all much </p>
<p>prefer to abstain than have to choose between us and the US on the one hand </p>
<p>and France and Africa on the other. I was struck by the same argument from all </p>
<p>three, the importance of unity amongst the P5 … and the need for a majority in the </p>
<p>Security Council …”</p>
<p><b>974. </b> Baroness Amos cautioned that the UK and US would need to stay in close </p>
<p>touch to ensure that lobbying was complementary and to avoid being perceived to be </p>

<p>4 March that Adm Boyce had reported indications of growing pressure from US military </p>

<p>12 March had emerged as a possible start date for the military campaign.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>979. </b> Mr Hoon was “concerned by the apparent disconnect between US military </p>

<p> That is addressed in Section 5.</p>

<p><b>982. </b> In response to a question from Ms Lynne Jones (Labour) asking whether nine </p>
<p>affirmative votes would provide “clear” legal authority “for war”, Mr Blair responded that </p>
<p>the Government would “always act in accordance with international law” and that “we </p>
<p>are confident of securing the votes for that resolution and we will carry on working for </p>
<p>that end”. He added:</p>

<p><b>983. </b> Asked by Mr Andrew Selous (Conservative) about the direct threat and risks to the </p>
<p>UK, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… I think that the threat of leaving Saddam Hussein armed with weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction is two fold. First, it is that he begins another conflict in his region, into </p>
<p>which Britain … would inevitably be sucked … Alternatively – and I think this is a </p>
<p>powerful and developing threat that the world must face – the risk is that states </p>
<p>such as Iraq, which are proliferating these chemical and biological weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, will combine in a way that is devastating for the world with terrorists who </p>
<p>are desperate to get their hands on those weapons to wreak maximum destruction.</p>
<p>“… If we do not stand firm over Iraq now, we will never be able to deal with the next </p>

<p><b>984. </b> In the entry in his diary for 5 March, Mr Cook wrote that PMQs “was notable for the </p>
<p>confidence” Mr Blair had “expressed about getting a second resolution”.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether this is calculated bravado to keep Saddam wary, or whether </p>
<p>he is in a state of denial about the mounting evidence that they can’t get a second </p>
<p>resolution on the present terms.”</p>
<p><b>985.  Mr Cook told Mr Blair that he would be unable to carry public opinion if </b></p>
<p><b>he sidelined the inspectors; if Dr Blix needed months, he should be given until </b></p>
<p><b>the autumn.</b></p>
<p><b>986. </b> In a meeting in the House of Commons shortly after PMQs, Mr Cook told Mr Blair </p>
<p>that he had “gone out on a limb” and he should “stop climbing further”.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> The UK had </p>
<p>“to be seen on the side” of Dr Blix. Mr Blair would “never carry British opinion” if the UK </p>
<p>was “seen to be sidelining the work of the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>987. </b> Mr Cook also wrote that when Mr Blair had told him that Britain might propose a </p>
<p>new deadline on 7 March, he had said it had to be “seen logically to arise from what Blix </p>
<p>said. If he needed months, we should be prepared to give him until the autumn.” Mr Blair </p>
<p>had replied that he could not deliver that, adding:</p>
<p>“Left to himself, Bush would have gone to war in January. No, not January, </p>
<p>September.”</p>
<p><b>988. </b> Mr Cook subsequently wrote that the conversation “was an honest exchange </p>
<p>between two colleagues who were both open about the gulf widening between them”: </p>
<p>and that Mr Blair had “always [been] candid about his intention to be with Bush when </p>

<p>of the UN weapons inspections”. Mr Blair had “made no attempt to pretend” that what </p>
<p>Dr Blix might report “would make any difference to the countdown to invasion”. In his </p>
<p>speech in Glasgow on 15 February, Mr Blair had said that he wanted to “solve the </p>
<p>issue” through the UN: “Today he was telling me that the solution was not going to </p>
<p>be disarmament through the UN, but regime change through war.”</p>
<p><b>989. </b> Secondly, Mr Blair “did not try to argue” Mr Cook out of the view that “Saddam </p>
<p>did not have any real weapons of mass destruction that were designed for strategic </p>
<p>use against city populations and capable of being delivered with reliability over </p>
<p>long distances”.</p>
<p><b>990.  Mr Straw told Mr Blair that the Labour Party would not support action </b></p>
<p><b>beginning the following week.</b></p>
<p><b>991. </b> Mr Blair wrote in his memoir that Mr Straw had:</p>
<p>“… come over after PMQs. He was genuinely alarmed and worried about the </p>
<p>political fallout. ‘If you go next Wednesday with Bush and without a second </p>
<p>resolution, the only regime change that will be happening is in this room.’ He said it </p>
<p>as a friend and colleague, and he meant it.”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>992. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw gave a similar account of that discussion, explaining that </p>
<p>his warning “was not about what I would do. I’d support him. But I felt … we would not </p>

<p> Sir David </p>
<p>told Dr Rice that Chile and Mexico would need “something on timing, and meeting </p>

<p>as “graphic proof” of Saddam Hussein’s failure to disarm over the last 12 years.</p>

<p> That should include a deadline in an amended resolution, which </p>

<p><b>998. </b> Sir David said he had told Dr Rice that Mr Blair might travel to Chile and Mexico </p>
<p>to show we were taking account of their concerns. That might be followed by a “carefully </p>
<p>orchestrated” meeting with President Bush to demonstrate his (President Bush’s) </p>
<p>willingness to listen to partners and allies and that he was still, “even at the eleventh </p>
<p>hour”, hoping that Saddam Hussein would disarm. Mr Blair and President Bush might </p>
<p>then consult President Putin. Even if that did not persuade President Putin to support </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The second resolution was “absolutely vital”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK needed “at least nine positive votes and no Russian veto”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“If the French veto alone, it would be just about manageable.”</p>

<p>The UK thought Russia intended to veto, but “would be moved” by </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico and Pakistan were “moving in the </p>
<p>right direction”; but they were “not in the bag yet”. Mexico and Chile were </p>
<p>“interested in more time, a deadline, and benchmarks”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adding an ultimatum into the resolution the UK which identified a “set date  </p>
<p>(e.g. 17 or 21 March)” for Iraqi compliance.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was: “Important that it would take a positive decision by the Security Council to </p>
<p>decide that Iraq had taken the required step – so we have the initiative and lock </p>
<p>on the process.”</p>

<p>The need to “define some benchmarks to show what we mean by full </p>

<p><b>1001. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush proposing a further amendment to the </p>
<p>draft resolution.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>1002. </b> Mr Blair said that an ultimatum should include a deadline of 10 days from the date </p>
<p>of the resolution for the Security Council to decide that “Unless … Iraq is complying by [</p>
<p>313</p>
<p>], </p>
<p>then Iraq is in material breach”.</p>
<p><b>1003. </b> Mr Blair stated that if there were nine votes but a French veto, he thought that </p>
<p>“politically and legally” UK participation in military action would be acceptable. “But if </p>
<p>we did not get nine votes, such participation might be legal”, but he would face major </p>
<p>obstacles. It would be “touch and go”.</p>
<p><b>1004. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also briefly discussed the military plan.</p>
<p><b>1005. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that he had only heard Mr Blair’s side of the call “saying </p>
<p>we had a real problem with world opinion, that these countries need a reason to come </p>
<p>round, that he wanted to go to Chile and set out the outlines of an amended resolution </p>
<p>with a deadline”.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> Mr Blair had also told President Bush that he “needed to work </p>
<p>more on Putin”.</p>
<p><b>1006. </b> The record of the discussion broadly confirms Mr Campbell’s account.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p><b>1007. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that Dr Blix “was out again today, as much commentator </p>
<p>as civil servant”.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> Mr Blair “felt the UNSC had to take control of this now, not Blix”. </p>
<p>Mr Powell had reported that the US and UK “seemed far apart” but Mr Blair “said it was </p>
<p>not as bad as that” he had told President Bush “we would be with them come what </p>
<p>may” but it was “other countries” who “needed help to come over”. The US had “claimed </p>
<p>they had already slowed down as a result of TB, that Bush had wanted to go as early </p>
<p>as yesterday but TB made sure they didn’t. It was a pretty grim scene, and no matter, </p>
<p>how grim, TB was still saying constantly that it was the right thing to do.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s proposals and to discuss them with President Fox.</b></p>
<p><b>1009. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Lagos on 5 March about rallying international </p>
<p>support and making public opinion understand why he thought Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was not co&#8209;operating.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>1010. </b> Mr Blair wanted President Lagos’ view on:</p>
<p>“… setting a deadline for full co&#8209;operation, and saying that if the Iraqis did not </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate … they would be in breach. In parallel, we would set out our criteria </p>
<p>for co&#8209;operation. This would face Saddam with the decision: co&#8209;operate, leave the </p>
<p>scene or face the use of force. It would make clear that force was our last resort.”</p>
<p><b>1011. </b> President Lagos agreed to consider the proposal and Mr Blair’s suggestion </p>
<p>of a meeting in Chile, to discuss it with President Fox and others, and to respond </p>
<p>the following day.</p>
<p><b>1012. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair wanted to go to Moscow and the US as well as </p>
<p>Chile: “We are in this and nobody must think we would ever wobble.”</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> Mr Campbell’s </p>
<p>view was that the idea of a visit to Chile “was clearly not on as things stood” and Mr Blair </p>
<p>would need a purpose for a meeting with President Bush.</p>
<p><b>1013. </b> Mr Campbell added that Mr Blair described the purpose of a visit to the US as </p>
<p>“to get them to do the right thing”. Mr Campbell had responded that the US was “already </p>
<p>very clear about their purpose, which was to go for it”. He had also asked Mr Blair “Are </p>
<p>you not sure that your frustration at the way others are dealing with it is just producing a </p>
<p>kind of wanderlust?” Mr Blair had replied that there was no substitute for face&#8209;to&#8209;face </p>
<p>meetings. Asked if he was sure the issue was really worth “sacrificing everything”, </p>
<p>Mr Blair had replied that it was:</p>
<p>“… always worth doing what you think is the right thing … Iraq is a real problem, </p>
<p>Saddam is a real problem, for us as much as anyone, and it’s been ignored </p>
<p>too long.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p><b>1016. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, reported </p>
<p>overnight on 5/6 March that “barring a highly improbable volte face by Saddam”, the US </p>
<p>was “now firmly on track for military action – with or without a second … resolution”; and </p>
<p>that the “only event which might significantly affect their timetable would be problems </p>
<p>for the UK”.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p> That had been described as “huge – like trying to play football without the </p>
<p>quarterback”. The US was “therefore pulling out all the stops at the UN”.</p>
<p><b>1017. </b> Mr Brenton reported that the US fully understood the importance of the second </p>
<p>resolution for the UK and he had explained the Parliamentary arithmetic. He also </p>
<p>reported that the US had “gained the impression that we need the resolution for legal </p>
<p>reasons” and that he had “explained the real situation”.</p>
<p><b>1018. </b> Mr Brenton advised that the US was “reasonably hopeful of getting the nine </p>
<p>votes (although a little disturbed that the Mexicans have not yet come back to them </p>
<p>on our suggested amendment)”. The US was “sanguine” about Russia, and thought </p>
<p>China would not veto “unless, at least, the French and Russians do”. The US could </p>
<p>not “call” France.</p>
<p><b>1019. </b> The US would discuss tactics with Mr Straw in New York. The US intention </p>
<p>remained “to go for a vote next week, perhaps with … a very short ultimatum tagged </p>
<p>on”. He had told one of his contacts that “it was not helpful for the US to refer to the </p>
<p>possibility of not going for a vote”.</p>
<p><b>1020. </b> Mr Brenton concluded:</p>
<p>“… the military clock is now audibly ticking and only a major shock to our (ie UK) </p>
<p>plans is likely to jolt it substantially. The US can be expected to deal quite firmly with </p>
<p>any efforts in the UN to slow things down.”</p>
<p><b>1021.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that the US would not countenance the use </b></p>
<p><b>of benchmarks. That would delay the military timetable.</b></p>
<p><b>1022. </b> Reporting discussions in New York on 5 March, Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote </p>
<p>that the US would not countenance benchmarks; that “simply risked delaying the </p>
<p>military timetable”.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> Sir Jeremy and Ambassador Negroponte had agreed on the need to avoid the </p>
<p>risk that Dr Blix would say that Iraq was demonstrating “unconditional, active and full </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation”. Sir Jeremy had agreed with Ambassador Negroponte and Mr Arias that </p>
<p>wording was needed “on Iraq demonstrating a genuine change of heart”: “But this had </p>
<p>to be something that could not be played back at us, e.g. in a statement by Saddam </p>
<p>saying he had taken an ‘unconditional and irreversible decision’.” One key test was Iraq </p>
<p>yielding its WMD.</p>

<p><b>1024. </b> Discussions between experts on the tactics for the Security Council discussion </p>
<p>on 7 March had agreed the need to pose questions to Dr Blix and that “more material </p>
<p>drawing out key points from the clusters document” was needed:</p>
<p>“We could and should use it to illustrate just how much the Iraq has not done </p>
<p>with respect to inspections. We should also highlight the huge gaps in knowledge </p>
<p>as an illustration that we could not benchmark, nor define key tasks, without </p>
<p>Iraqi co&#8209;operation.”</p>
<p><b>1025. </b> Sir Jeremy provided two alternative formulations for the draft resolution </p>
<p>in a separate telegram.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>1026.  Mr Blair and Mr Straw agreed that, in the Security Council meeting </b></p>
<p><b>on 7 March, the UK would:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>explore additions to the draft resolution;</b></p>

<p><b>pose tough questions to Dr Blix; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>demand the publication of the UNMOVIC “clusters” document.</b></p>
<p><b>1027. </b> In a meeting on the morning of 6 March, Mr Blair agreed that Mr Straw should </p>
<p>explore additions to the draft resolution, including ultimatum language, exile and the UN </p>
<p>role in post&#8209;conflict humanitarian assistance, with Secretary Powell and others in New </p>
<p>York later that day.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Subject to the views of Chile and Mexico, Mr Straw “should stick to our </p>
<p>preference for a period of ten days between the passage of the resolution </p>
<p>and the expiry of the ultimatum”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw should see Dr Blix to “insist that the clusters document is published </p>
<p>on 7 March”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK “should express outrage over the lack of Iraqi co&#8209;operation”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair would speak to Presidents Lagos and Putin later that day; and </p>
<p>to President Chirac after the Security Council debate.</p>
<p><b>1029. </b> Mr Campbell wrote: “we needed to get out the idea that we wanted the clusters </p>

<p>323</p>
<p>CABINET, 6 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>1030.  Mr Blair told Cabinet that the argument boiled down to the question </b></p>
<p><b>of whether Saddam Hussein would ever voluntarily co-operate with the UN </b></p>
<p><b>to disarm Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>1031.  Mr Blair concluded that it was for the Security Council to determine whether </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq was co-operating fully.</b></p>
<p><b>1032. </b> Mr Blair explained to Cabinet on 6 March that Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei would </p>
<p>be reporting to the Security Council the following day.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> Dr Blix was proposing to put forward a document which analysed the outstanding </p>
<p>disarmament issues. It was important that the facts should be made public.</p>
<p><b>1034. </b> The UK was discussing an amendment to the draft resolution – “to encourage </p>
<p>support from those members who remained undecided” – with some Security Council </p>
<p>members. The support of Mexico and Chile “could be critical to the vote”. It was not clear </p>
<p>what Russia and France would do. The “argument boiled down to whether” Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein “would ever voluntarily co&#8209;operate with the United Nations to disarm Iraq. </p>
<p>Members of the Security Council needed to be persuaded on this point.”</p>
<p><b>1035. </b> Mr Blair also said that he had agreed with President Bush on the need for the UN </p>
<p>to be “heavily involved” in “the post&#8209;conflict situation, in the event that military action was </p>
<p>necessary”. They had also discussed the importance of moving the Middle East Peace </p>
<p>Process forward on the basis of a “Road Map”.</p>
<p><b>1036. </b> The points made in discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the amendment of the draft Security Council resolution should incorporate </p>
<p>a deadline “since the public attached importance to the inspection work”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “integrity and dignity” of the UN process was being “diminished” by the </p>
<p>“political arm&#8209;twisting” by some members;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq would require a UN mandate, not just their involvement; </p>
<p>otherwise the right of Coalition forces to engage in reconstruction work would </p>
<p>be limited by their status as an occupation force;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the focus on Iraq’s WMD should be maintained, not “diverted to discovery </p>
<p>and destruction of ballistic missiles, albeit the latter could deliver toxic material </p>
<p>in their warheads”; and</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the British media operating in Baghdad did not adequately acknowledge the </p>
<p>restrictions under which they were working.</p>
<p><b>1037. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said it was “the responsibility of the Chief </p>
<p>Inspectors to present the truth about Saddam Hussein’s co&#8209;operation with the United </p>
<p>Nations, so that the Security Council could discharge its responsibilities in making the </p>
<p>necessary political decisions”. The UK was “lobbying hard in favour of the draft Security </p>
<p>Council resolution”. It was the duty of Saddam Hussein to co&#8209;operate fully, “and it was </p>
<p>for the Security Council to determine whether that had been the case”.</p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Mr Cook wrote that Mr Blair had been “surprisingly upbeat about the prospects </p>
<p>of getting the six swing votes on the Security Council” and “even expressed a hope </p>
<p>that Russia might abstain and France might not veto”. That was “not just surprising, </p>
<p>but manifestly unrealistic”.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p><b>1039. </b> Ms Short wrote that her diary entry for that meeting recorded that she had said </p>
<p>she regretted:</p>
<p>“… we couldn’t use our leverage to get publication of the Road Map. Arm twisting </p>
<p>members of the Security Council looks bad and diminishes the UN. Can’t we let the </p>
<p>Blix process have integrity. Have to have UN mandate for reconstruction, otherwise </p>
<p>occupied territory.”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Ms Short added that, in a meeting before Cabinet, Mr Blair had said that he </p>
<p>might need to go to see President Bush again which was the “only way he can get him </p>
<p>[President Bush] to listen”. Ms Short asked Mr Blair to see Mr Annan too.</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> Mr Campbell described the meeting as “scratchy”. Both Mr Cook and Ms Short </p>
<p>had been “a bit bolder in setting out their concerns”. Ms Short had said the “idea of </p>
<p>horse trading and bullying was bad for the authority of the UN”. Mr Blair had “hit back </p>
<p>quite hard” saying “it was not just the US who were bullying and intimidating”; France </p>
<p>was making threats too.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p><b>1042. </b> After Cabinet on 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post&#8209;conflict issues </p>
<p>with Mr Brown, Mr Hoon, Ms Short, Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean (the joint  </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>366</p>
<p>USING THE “CLUSTERS” DOCUMENT</p>
<p><b>1043.  Since 3 March, No.10 and the FCO had been discussing how to use the </b></p>
<p><b>UNMOVIC “clusters” document to the UK’s advantage.</b></p>
<p><b>1044.  Officials recognised that the document was largely historical and a list </b></p>
<p><b>of things Iraq should have done; UNMOVIC was not due to present its analysis </b></p>
<p><b>of “Key Disarmament Tasks” required by resolution 1284 to the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>until 27 March. The document was described as a “167 page-long catalogue </b></p>
<p><b>of Iraqi intransigence”.</b></p>
<p><b>1045.  At No.10’s request, the FCO analysis of the document was sent to all </b></p>
<p><b>Cabinet Ministers on 6 March.</b></p>
<p><b>1046. </b> Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair on 4 March:</p>
<p>“Our best guess is that … we have a reasonable chance of securing ten positive </p>
<p>votes … But we are also faced with an increasingly likely French veto.</p>
<p>“To increase the chances of securing nine or ten votes, we should take on board </p>
<p>Chilean/Mexican concerns.”</p>
<p>329</p>
<p><b>1047. </b> Mr Rycroft identified Chile and Mexico as the least likely of the 10 possible </p>
<p>positive votes. He set out options identified by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, of which “the </p>
<p>most promising” was “a combination of an ultimatum and benchmarks”.</p>
<p><b>1048. </b> Setting out a spectrum of options for the language of an ultimatum setting out </p>
<p>actions Iraq would need to have taken “by [17 March]”, Mr Rycroft wrote:</p>
<p>“There are mixed signs as to whether the US would accept any of these approaches. </p>
<p>But our instinct is to press on hard, and to try to persuade the Chileans/Mexicans </p>
<p>themselves to table this amendment, after Blix’s 7 March report.”</p>
<p><b>1049. </b> Mr Rycroft added:</p>
<p>“In parallel … but outside the resolution, we should set out what we mean by full </p>
<p>compliance by picking out benchmarks based on Blix’s clusters document … [I]f </p>
<p>we end up with ultimatum language at the soft end of the spectrum, we shall need </p>
<p>to say what we mean [by the language of the resolution] …”</p>
<p><b>1050. </b> Mr Rycroft advised:</p>
<p>“There is no guarantee that these moves would help prevent a French veto. But they </p>
<p>should help ensure a Russian abstention and increase France’s isolation. We shall </p>
<p>have to decide, at the last minute, whether the costs of a French veto outweigh the </p>
<p>advantages of a vote showing majority Security Council support. At present, our view </p>
<p>329 </p>
<p>Minute Rycroft to Prime Minister, 4 March 2003, ‘Iraq: A Strategy’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>367</p>
<p>is that we must test the French veto threat to destruction and put our resolution to </p>
<p>the vote … Certainly we should give no hint to the French of looking at options short </p>
<p>of putting our text to a vote.</p>
<p>“It is possible that a find by the inspectors would be what it takes to move </p>
<p>[President] Chirac away from a veto. If there were a find (see separate note), it </p>
<p>would be well worth your talking to Chirac to see if it will do the trick.”</p>
<p><b>1051. </b> On the timing for a vote, the “preference, shared by the US,” was to seek a vote </p>
<p>“as soon after 7 March as we are confident that we have nine positive votes”. With the </p>
<p>planned ultimatum, there would then be “a week or so before the start of military action </p>
<p>to work on public opinion, rather than attempting to do this before the vote”.</p>
<p><b>1052. </b> Mr Rycroft concluded:</p>
<p>“On 7 March, we need to turn Blix’s ‘clusters’ document to our advantage. We need </p>
<p>to stress that it is not exhaustive, yet it still offers a damning indictment of Iraq’s </p>
<p>failure to co&#8209;operate. It comprises sections on 29 different weapons/agents … for </p>
<p>each of which Blix includes outstanding questions for Iraq to answer. (I am sending </p>
<p>you the complete list …) At 167 pages, it shows not only what Iraq would have to </p>
<p>do in the future to give full co&#8209;operation, but also what Iraq should have done over </p>
<p>the last 12 years. This is further compelling evidence, if any were needed, of Iraq’s </p>
<p>failure to co&#8209;operate fully.”</p>
<p><b>1053. </b> Responding to a request from Mr Blair for further information on the UNMOVIC </p>
<p>“clusters” document; a minute from Mr Nicholas Cannon, Mr Blair’s Assistant Private </p>
<p>Secretary for Foreign Affairs, described it as “rather historical” and that most of the </p>
<p>information was drawn from UNSCOM’s work.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> The UK had “urged” Dr Blix to “give </p>
<p>appropriate weight to post&#8209;1998 unresolved issues”. He had “promised to try”, but </p>
<p>argued that while it was “possible to establish material balances for the earlier period”, </p>
<p>it was “less clear what one could do with the flat Iraqi denial of any activity in the latter </p>
<p>period”; and it was “unclear whether all gaps could be resolved”.</p>
<p><b>1054. </b> Mr Cannon reported that France, Germany and Russia had pressed for the </p>
<p>“clusters” document and the UNMOVIC work programme, to be released to the Security </p>
<p>Council. The UK thought that they intended:</p>
<p>“… to distil … a few benchmarks to assess Iraqi compliance. We doubt whether </p>
<p>it would be possible to define ‘key tests’ that did not allow Iraq room to fudge </p>
<p>compliance or Security Council members room for debate about whether Iraq was </p>
<p>meeting the criteria or not. Saddam would be encouraged to continue to dribble out </p>
<p>concessions piecemeal rather than offer a step change on co&#8209;operation. So far we </p>
<p>have argued that without full co&#8209;operation from Iraq, specific disarmament tasks are </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>368</p>
<p><b>1055. </b> Addressing two questions, Mr Cannon advised that the document:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Exposed the “scale and range” of Iraq’s WMD and the “long&#8209;term pattern of </p>
<p>concealment and deceit”. It flagged up “recent examples of Iraqi deception”. </p>
<p>It could be used as “evidence of Iraq’s failure to co&#8209;operate” and its UN </p>
<p>provenance “gave it more credibility than products of potential belligerents”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Could be used after publication as a quarry for benchmarks, but it “tended </p>
<p>to focus on hardware rather than interviews” and the “sheer number of </p>
<p>outstanding questions” made it possible for the Iraqis reasonably to ask for </p>
<p>more time. Boiling down the list might open the way to suggestions that Iraq </p>
<p>had partially complied.</p>
<p><b>1056. </b> Mr Cannon concluded:</p>
<p>“But we can draw on the ‘clusters’ in drawing up our own ‘benchmarks’ … We need </p>
<p>to ensure that on balance it is seen as a list of the things that Iraq should have done, </p>
<p>not a list of things for Iraq to do in the future.”</p>
<p><b>1057. </b> FCO analysis of the draft “clusters” document sent to No.10 on 5 March explained </p>
<p>that the document was “intended to form the basis for UNMOVIC’s determination of the </p>
<p>‘Key Disarmament Tasks’”, which the terms of resolution 1284 (1999) stipulated were to </p>
<p>be submitted to the Security Council for discussion by 27 March. A revised draft would </p>
<p>be submitted to the Council on 7 March.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p><b>1058. </b> The FCO suggested that France, Germany and Russia would “try to use </p>
<p>the document to draw up a ‘leisurely’ timetable for those issues to be addressed”. </p>
<p>The UK position had been that “without full and active Iraqi co&#8209;operation, it is not </p>
<p>possible to draw up a comprehensive list of disarmament tasks”; and that: “In any </p>
<p>case, the requirements of resolution 1441 take precedence.”</p>
<p><b>1059. </b> The FCO drew attention to a number of points in the draft document, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “admitted refurbishing some equipment previously destroyed by </p>
<p>UNSCOM, in particular some chemical facilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “a modest expansion of biological industries … UNMOVIC also </p>
<p>acknowledge that there have been a number of intelligence reports concerning </p>
<p>bio&#8209;weapon production facilities.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had “been ‘a surge of activity’ in missile technology over the past </p>
<p>four years”.</p>
<p><b>1060. </b> The FCO commented that the draft document was “not exhaustive” but did </p>
<p>reveal “the enormous amount of Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation over the years; a 167 page&#8209;long </p>
<p>catalogue of Iraqi intransigence”.</p>

<p>369</p>
<p><b>1061. </b> The FCO identified a number of “key points”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The report was “inevitably not comprehensive”. It was: “Impossible to provide </p>
<p>a comprehensive list of disarmament tasks without Iraqi co&#8209;operation and given </p>
<p>the inspectors were out of Iraq for four years.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “huge number of questions remain unanswered”. More than 100 specific </p>
<p>actions had been identified which Iraq “must take”. Those were “not difficult, </p>
<p>mostly concerning the need to present documents, evidence and more coherent </p>
<p>accounts of Iraq’s work”. Iraq “could have provided this at any time”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could “give no credible account of the surge of activity in the missile </p>
<p>technology field over the last four years”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Destruction of the Al Samoud 2 missiles had begun by the UNMOVIC set </p>
<p>deadline of 1 March and 28 had been destroyed by 5 March: “No end&#8209;date </p>
<p>has been set for the process.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “uncertainties about Iraq’s use of mobile ‘factories’”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s failure to co&#8209;operate over private interviews raised “further suspicions </p>
<p>that Iraq has something to hide”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNSCOM had a list of 3,500 names of those it might wish to interview.</p>
<p><b>1062. </b> At No.10’s request, the FCO analysis was sent to all Cabinet Ministers </p>
<p>on 6 March.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>1063. </b> A further analysis of the “clusters” document by Downing Street officials on </p>
<p>6 March picked out the areas which demonstrated Iraqi non&#8209;co&#8209;operation. As there </p>
<p>was only limited material on ongoing production programmes (other than ballistic </p>
<p>missiles), the two key sets of concerns related to leftover questions from UNSCOM </p>
<p>on chemical and biological weapons, and evidence of a “systematic pattern of deceit </p>
<p>and concealment”.</p>

<p>If “Saddam co&#8209;operated, war could even now be averted”, but Mr Blair now </p>
<p>“did not think” that Saddam Hussein would co&#8209;operate.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>time to complete disarmament. But the Security Council had to be the judge </p>

<p>ASSESSMENT OF IRAQ’S INTENTIONS, 6 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>1067.  An assessment of Iraq’s intentions on 6 March concluded that the strategy </b></p>
<p><b>was to play for time, and Iraq thought that strategy was working.</b></p>
<p><b>1068.  The Assessments Staff was confident that Saddam Hussein’s aim would </b></p>
<p><b>be the eventual re-creation of his WMD capability.</b></p>
<p><b>1069. </b> Mr Miller provided an assessment of ‘Saddam’s possible next moves’ for </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 6 March.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> The document was also sent to officials in the </p>
<p>FCO, the MOD and the Cabinet Office.</p>
<p><b>1070. </b> Mr Miller described Saddam Hussein’s strategy as “to play for time, gradually </p>
<p>releasing limited information on Iraq’s terms or when there is no other option”. </p>
<p>Iraq thought its strategy was working. Mr Miller stated: “Even if he [Saddam Hussein] </p>
<p>does opt for a declaration of WMD, we are confident that his aim would be the </p>
<p>eventual re&#8209;creation of his capability.”</p>
<p><b>1071. </b> Mr Miller advised that the decision to destroy the Al Samoud 2 missiles was </p>
<p>“indicative of Saddam’s strategy: a drawn out debate with UNMOVIC over legality; an </p>
<p>offer to form a ‘technical committee’ to review the weapon; compliance; and an attempt </p>
<p>to portray compliance as a major concession”. Mr Miller predicted that Iraq would “draw </p>
<p>out the destruction process”, which might take “as long as two months to complete”.</p>
<p><b>1072. </b> Other points made by Mr Miller included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “likely to follow a pattern of a drip feed of information to UNMOVIC”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Passing over documents only in Arabic might be a deliberate tactic to </p>
<p>delay verification.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It could take two to three weeks to validate any documentation to back up Iraq’s </p>
<p>claims to have destroyed VX.</p>

<p>371</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Progress with interviews continued to be “unsatisfactory”, although there had </p>
<p>been “some improvement”. Iraq was likely to continue attempts to monitor </p>
<p>interviews and to resist interviews outside Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was likely to support proposals – for more time for inspections or an agreed </p>
<p>timetable or checklist – put forward by those in the UN reluctant to authorise a </p>
<p>resolution permitting war.</p>
<p><b>1073. </b> Mr Miller concluded:</p>
<p>“In short, we have seen no indication that there will be a change in Iraq’s strategy … </p>
<p>Iraq will continue to put the onus on the inspectors to set out what they want rather </p>
<p>than pro&#8209;actively provide information … Saddam will be prepared to offer further </p>
<p>concessions – or at least to say he is ready to. But based on current behaviour any </p>
<p>information will be incomplete, will be difficult to interpret and will not represent a </p>
<p>full declaration of Iraq’s capability. On overseas interviews and any proposal for </p>
<p>a substantial UN military force, agreement is likely only in the face of imminent </p>
<p>military action.”</p>
<p>MR STRAW’S MEETINGS IN NEW YORK, 6 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>1074. </b> In a meeting with Mr Annan, Mr Straw set out the thinking on revising the second </p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>1075. </b> Mr Straw told Mr Annan that military considerations could not be allowed </p>
<p>“to dictate policy”, but the military build&#8209;up “could not be maintained for ever”, and:</p>
<p>“… the more he had looked into the Iraq dossier the more convinced he had become </p>
<p>of the need for action. Reading the clusters document made his hair stand on end.”</p>
<p><b>1076. </b> Mr Straw set out the UK thinking on a deadline, stating this was “Iraq’s last </p>
<p>chance”, but the objective was disarmament and, if Saddam Hussein did what was </p>
<p>demanded, “he could stay”. In those circumstances, a “permanent and toughened </p>
<p>inspections regime” would be needed, possibly “picking up some earlier ideas for </p>
<p>an all&#8209;Iraq NFZ [No&#8209;Fly Zone]”.</p>
<p><b>1077. </b> Other points in the discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Kieran Prendergast, UN Under Secretary&#8209;General for Political Affairs, pointed </p>
<p>out that the UK was “reversing the veto: if there were no positive finding, then </p>
<p>there would be war”.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>clear deadline”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It had been decided not to include a provision about exile, but “we were telling </p>
<p>our Arab friends that we had got exile language”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Prendergast stated that giving Saddam Hussein impunity would cause a “big </p>
<p>public problem: how could we ignore the ICC [International Criminal Court]”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw responded that “if the choice was between war or immunity”, he had </p>
<p>the sense that “people would breathe a sigh of relief”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If there were to be a conflict, “the UN had a role in humanitarian aid </p>
<p>and reconstruction, and only the UN could give legal authority for any </p>
<p>post&#8209;Saddam government”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Annan was reported to be “disturbed” by the American position that everyone </p>
<p>had to vote for the resolution “or else the UN would be irrelevant”. The US knew </p>
<p>it needed the UN on a range of issues. The UN was “bigger than Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw responded that “if we failed the cohesion of the Security Council would </p>
<p>be weakened”.</p>
<p><b>1078. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that Mr Annan had approved.</p>
<p><b>1079. </b> In a meeting with Dr Blix on 6 March, Mr Straw had “acknowledged” that the </p>
<p>draft resolution:</p>
<p>“… missed out a necessary intermediate step. We now proposed to offer Saddam an </p>
<p>opportunity to show full compliance accompanied by a slightly longer time frame …</p>
<p>“… [the Government’s] agenda was disarmament and not regime change.  </p>
<p>The Prime Minister had told Ivanov that if Saddam gave up his WMD he could </p>
<p>stay. President Bush could not say this publicly, but he too would prefer peaceful </p>
<p>voluntary disarmament to war. If Dr Blix, as the most important witness in the whole </p>
<p>process, reported to the Security Council that Iraq was co&#8209;operating then the bunting </p>
<p>would go up in London.”</p>
<p>337</p>
<p><b>1080. </b> Mr Straw had also “stressed that the underlying intelligence picture which was </p>
<p>agreed by a number of services from several countries was clear – Saddam was not </p>
<p>complying and was misleading the inspectors”.</p>
<p><b>1081. </b> Dr Blix told Mr Straw that he would report that the Iraqis had made “some </p>
<p>progress but they still had a long way to go”. Dr Blix “did not personally doubt that the </p>
<p>Iraqis were self sufficient in precursors and had the capability to jump start production </p>
<p>of a range of agents. But the inspectors had found little … although the Iraqis had been </p>
<p>‘hyperactive’ of late in handing over documents and making other gestures, overall </p>
<p>they were not co&#8209;operating fully.” Dr Blix had agreed with Mr Straw that “while difficult </p>
<p>to define we would all soon realise what constituted compliance when the Iraqis started </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating fully”.</p>

<p>DR BLIX’S REPORT TO THE SECURITY COUNCIL, 7 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>1086.  In his report to the Security Council on 7 March, Dr Blix stated that there </b></p>
<p><b>had been an acceleration of initiatives from Iraq since the end of January, but they </b></p>
<p><b>could not be said to constitute immediate co-operation. Nor did they necessarily </b></p>
<p><b>cover all areas of relevance; but they were nevertheless welcome.</b></p>
<p><b>1087.  As required by resolution 1284 (1999) UNMOVIC was drawing up a work </b></p>
<p><b>programme of key disarmament tasks for approval by the Security Council which </b></p>
<p><b>would be ready later that month.</b></p>
<p><b>1088.  It would take “months” to complete the task.</b></p>
<p><b>1089. </b> Introducing UNMOVIC’s 12th quarterly report of activity to 28 February 2003, </p>
<p>as required by resolution 1284 (1999), which had already been circulated to the </p>
<p>Security Council, Dr Blix stated that, when the report had been finalised, there had still </p>
<p>been “relatively little tangible progress to note” and the report had been “cautious”. </p>
<p>By 7 March, there had been a number of relevant events on which he would bring </p>
<p>the Council up to date.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p><b>1090. </b> The key points from Dr Blix’s report are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>Dr Blix’s report, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>Inspections process</b></p>
<p>Inspections had begun on 27 November 2002, and “faced relatively few difficulties”. Initial </p>
<p>difficulties about helicopters and aerial surveillance had “been overcome”. While there </p>
<p>were “frictions”, “at this juncture”, UNMOVIC was “able to perform professional no&#8209;notice </p>
<p>341 </p>
<p>UN Security Council, ‘4714th Meeting Friday 7 March 2003’ (S/PV.4714).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>375</p>
<p>inspections all over Iraq and to increase aerial surveillance” and its capabilities were </p>
<p>being increased.</p>
<p><b>Documents and interviews</b></p>
<p>Iraq, “with a highly developed administrative system”, should have been “able to provide </p>
<p>more documentary evidence”.</p>
<p>It was “a disappointment” that Iraq’s declaration of 7 December 2002 “did not bring new </p>
<p>documentary evidence”. Dr Blix hoped that “efforts … including the appointment of a </p>
<p>governmental commission” would “give significant results”:</p>
<p>“When proscribed items are deemed unaccounted for, it is, above all, credible </p>
<p>accounts that are needed – or the proscribed items, if they exist.”</p>
<p>Where “authentic documents” did not become available, interviews “may be another way </p>
<p>of obtaining evidence”. Iraq’s provision of “many names” had prompted two reflections:</p>
<p>“… with such detailed information existing regarding those who took part in the </p>
<p>unilateral destruction, surely there must also remain records regarding quantities </p>
<p>and other data concerning the various items destroyed.</p>
<p>“… with relevant witnesses available it becomes even more important to be able to </p>
<p>conduct interviews in modes and locations, which will allow us to be confident that </p>
<p>the testimony is given without outside influence.”</p>
<p>Iraq seemed “to have encouraged interviewees not to request the presence of Iraq </p>
<p>officials … or the taping of interviews” but “conditions ensuring the absence of undue </p>
<p>influence were difficult to attain inside Iraq. Interviews outside Iraq might provide such </p>
<p>assurance. It is our intention to request such interviews shortly.”</p>
<p>Thirty&#8209;eight individuals had been asked for interviews and 10 had accepted UNMOVIC’s </p>
<p>terms, seven during the last week.</p>
<p><b>Inspections</b></p>
<p>Iraq had denied the existence of mobile production units for biological weapons and that </p>
<p>proscribed activities were being conducted underground. Inspections had taken place at </p>
<p>declared and undeclared sites but no evidence of proscribed activities had “so far been </p>
<p>found”. Iraq was “expected to assist in the development of credible ways to conduct </p>
<p>random checks of ground transportation”.</p>
<p>Inspectors were examining Iraq’s programmes for remotely piloted vehicles and data was </p>
<p>being collected to assess the range and other capabilities of the models found.</p>
<p>In relation to “reports of proscribed activity conducted underground”, which Iraq had </p>
<p>denied, Dr Blix stated that “no facilities for chemical or biological production or storage </p>
<p>have been found so far”. Iraq should provide information on any underground facilities that </p>
<p>were suitable for the production or storage of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC would need some more staff to monitor ground </p>
<p>transportation and to inspect underground facilities, but he:</p>
<p>“… would rather have twice the amount of high quality information about sites </p>
<p>to inspect than twice the number of expert inspectors to send.”</p>

<p>376</p>
<p><b>Recent developments</b></p>
<p>Dr Blix stressed the importance of Iraq’s acceptance of the destruction of Al Samoud 2 </p>
<p>missiles and associated items, which constituted a “substantial measure of disarmament </p>
<p>… the first since the middle 1990s”.</p>
<p>Other points covered by Dr Blix included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC was reviewing the legality of the Al Fatah missile.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Papers on anthrax, VX and missiles had recently been provided. Many re&#8209;stated </p>
<p>what Iraq had already declared, but some required further study and discussion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “a significant Iraqi effort under way to clarify a major source of </p>
<p>uncertainty” about the “quantities of biological and chemical weapons” that had </p>
<p>been “unilaterally destroyed in 1991”, by excavating a site that was formerly </p>
<p>“deemed too dangerous”. Eight intact bombs had been unearthed, two of which </p>
<p>had a “liquid fill”. That “should be followed by a serious and credible effort to </p>
<p>determine” how many R&#8209;400 bombs had been produced.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had informed UNMOVIC that there would be further legislation on prohibiting </p>
<p>work on weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that, in relation to Iraq’s recent initiatives:</p>
<p>“One can hardly avoid the impression that, after a period of somewhat reluctant </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation, there has been an acceleration of initiatives from the Iraqi side since </p>
<p>the end of January. This is welcome, but the value of these measures must be </p>
<p>soberly judged by how many question marks they actually succeed in straightening </p>
<p>out. This is not yet clear.”</p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that the question which was being asked was “whether Iraq has </p>
<p>co&#8209;operated ‘immediately, unconditionally and actively’ with UNMOVIC, as required” </p>
<p>by resolution 1441.</p>
<p>Dr Blix stated: “The answers can be seen from the factual descriptions I have provided.” </p>
<p>He added that, “if more direct answers are desired”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had not “persisted” in attaching conditions on the exercise of the </p>
<p>inspectors rights.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The recent Iraqi initiatives to address long&#8209;standing issues could be “seen as </p>
<p>active or even proactive”. But “three to four months into the new resolution” they </p>
<p>could not be said “to constitute ‘immediate’ co&#8209;operation. Nor do they necessarily </p>
<p>cover all areas of relevance. They are nevertheless welcome, and UNMOVIC </p>
<p>is responding to them in the hope of solving presently unresolved disarmament </p>
<p>issues.”</p>
<p><b>Key disarmament tasks</b></p>
<p>Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC was working under several resolutions and that resolution </p>
<p>1284 (1999) instructed “UNMOVIC to ‘address unresolved disarmament issues’ and to </p>
<p>identify ‘key remaining disarmament tasks’ … to be submitted for approval by the Council </p>
<p>in the context of a work programme”. UNMOVIC was required to submit only the work </p>
<p>programme to the Council, and the draft would be ready “this month as required”.</p>

<p>377</p>
<p>Dr Blix added that, as he understood “several Council members are interested in the </p>
<p>working document with the complete clusters of disarmament issues, we have declassified </p>
<p>it and are ready to make it available to members of the Council on request”. It provided “a </p>
<p>more up&#8209;to&#8209;date review of the outstanding issues”; and each cluster ended “with a number </p>
<p>of points indicating what Iraq could do to solve the issue. Hence, Iraq’s co&#8209;operation could </p>
<p>be measured against the successful resolution of issues.”</p>
<p><b>1091. </b> Dr Blix concluded that “co&#8209;operation can and is to be immediate”, but </p>
<p>“disarmament and … verification … cannot be instant”. “Even with a pro&#8209;active Iraqi </p>
<p>attitude” it would still take “months” to “verify sites and items, analyse documents, </p>
<p>interview relevant persons and draw conclusions”.</p>
<p>DR ELBARADEI’S REPORT, 7 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>1092.  Dr ElBaradei reported that there were no indications that Iraq had resumed </b></p>
<p><b>nuclear activities since the inspectors left in December 1998 and the recently </b></p>
<p><b>increased level of Iraqi co-operation should allow the IAEA to provide the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council with an assessment of Iraq’s nuclear capabilities in the near future.</b></p>
<p><b>1093. </b> Dr ElBaradei reported that the IAEA was focused on the “central question” </p>
<p>of “whether Iraq has revived, or attempted to revive, its defunct nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme over the last four years”.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> Dr ElBaradei noted that:</p>
<p>“… in the past three weeks, possibly as a result of ever&#8209;increasing pressure by the </p>
<p>international community, Iraq has been forthcoming in its co&#8209;operation, particularly </p>
<p>with regard to the conduct of private interviews and in making available evidence </p>
<p>that could contribute to the resolution of matters of IAEA concern.”</p>
<p><b>1094. </b> That “should enable” the IAEA “in the very near future to provide the Security </p>
<p>Council with an objective and thorough assessment of Iraq’s nuclear&#8209;related </p>
<p>capabilities”.</p>
<p><b>1095. </b> The key points made by Dr ElBaradei are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>Dr ElBaradei’s report, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p>Iraq’s industrial capacity had deteriorated sharply, including through the departure </p>
<p>of foreign support present in the 1980s and large numbers of skilled Iraqi personnel </p>
<p>in the preceding decade.</p>
<p>Interviews were continuing, including two “private interviews in the last 10 days”. </p>
<p>Interviews outside Iraq might be the best way to ensure that interviews were “free”, </p>
<p>and the IAEA intended to request such interviews “shortly”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>378</p>
<p>The primary technical focus of the IAEA in the field had been on the possible resumption </p>
<p>of Iraq’s efforts to enrich uranium. In relation to the three key issues, the IAEA had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Failed to uncover any evidence that Iraq’s attempts to purchase high strength </p>
<p>aluminium tubes was for “any project other than … rockets”. The documents </p>
<p>provided and interviews had allowed the IAEA “to develop a coherent picture of </p>
<p>attempted purchases and intended usage”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Verified that none of the magnets Iraq had declared could be used directly for the </p>
<p>magnetic bearings in centrifuges. It was likely that Iraq possessed the expertise to </p>
<p>manufacture such magnets and the IAEA would continue to monitor and inspect </p>
<p>equipment and materials.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Stated that documents relating to the reports of possible acquisition of uranium </p>
<p>from Niger were not authentic, but it would continue to follow up any additional </p>
<p>evidence.</p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei concluded that there was no indication:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“of resumed nuclear activities” in buildings identified as new or reconstructed </p>
<p>since 1998”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“of nuclear&#8209;related prohibited activities at any inspected sites”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that Iraq has attempted to import uranium since 1990”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that Iraq has attempted to import aluminium tubes for use in centrifuge </p>
<p>enrichment”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“to date that Iraq imported magnets to use in a centrifuge enrichment programme”.</p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei stated that Iraq’s procurement efforts, including those in relation to magnets </p>
<p>and aluminium tubes, had been conducted “in contravention of the sanctions controls” </p>
<p>imposed by the Security Council. The IAEA would continue to scrutinise and investigate </p>
<p>those issues and hoped “to continue to receive from States actionable information relevant </p>
<p>to our mandate”.</p>
<p>SECURITY COUNCIL DISCUSSIONS, 7 MARCH 2003</p>
<p><b>1096.  In the discussion, there was unanimity in calls for Iraq to increase </b></p>
<p><b>its co-operation.</b></p>
<p><b>1097.  But there was a clear division between the US, UK, Spain and Bulgaria who </b></p>
<p><b>spoke in favour of a further resolution, and China, France, Germany and Russia </b></p>
<p><b>and most other Member States who spoke in favour of continuing to pursue </b></p>
<p><b>disarmament through strengthened inspections.</b></p>
<p><b>1098.  The UK, US and Spain circulated a draft resolution deciding that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>would have failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 (2002) </b></p>
<p><b>unless the Security Council concluded, on or before 17 March 2003, that Iraq </b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>379</p>
<p><b>had demonstrated full, unconditional, immediate and active co-operation in </b></p>
<p><b>accordance with its disarmament obligations and was yielding possession </b></p>
<p><b>of all weapons and proscribed material to UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</b></p>
<p><b>1099. </b> Mr Fischer stated that the international community was united in its condemnation </p>
<p>of the Iraqi regime but had different views about how to achieve that “common goal”.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added that the briefings from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei made clear that Iraq’s </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation did “not yet fully meet” the UN’s demands. Iraq “could have taken many </p>
<p>of its recent steps earlier and more willingly”, but co&#8209;operation had “notably improved”. </p>
<p>That was “a positive development” which made it “all the less comprehensible why that </p>
<p>development should now be abandoned”.</p>
<p><b>1100. </b> In line with the French/German/Russian joint memorandum presented to the </p>
<p>Security Council on 24 February, Mr Fischer called for a “tough regime of intensive </p>
<p>inspections” with “a time frame for every single problem”. Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei </p>
<p>should present the Security Council “with a detailed, comprehensive working </p>
<p>programme … without delay”.</p>
<p><b>1101. </b> Mr Fischer added that the disarmament of Iraq had to be “pursued energetically </p>
<p>and systematically” and the Iraqi Government had to co&#8209;operate fully with the inspectors. </p>
<p>But there was “no need for a second resolution” and the use of force: peaceful means </p>
<p>were “very far from having been exhausted”. Progress in recent days showed that there </p>
<p>were “efficient alternatives to war”. Taking that path would “strengthen the relevance of </p>
<p>the United Nations and the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>1102. </b> Mr Farouk al&#8209;Sharaa, the Syrian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs, reminded the Council of calls by the Non&#8209;Aligned Movement, the Arab Summit </p>
<p>and others for the inspectors to be given time to complete their work. Syria was </p>
<p>“confident” that the United Nations, which represented the “will of the international </p>
<p>community”, would opt for peace.</p>
<p><b>1103. </b> Mr Derbez expressed concern about the “lack of active, immediate and effective </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation” from the Iraqi regime. But Mexico was “greatly distressed” by the erosion </p>
<p>of relationships and common values caused by different visions of how to disarm Iraq </p>
<p>and “worried by the distance” between members of the Council. Mr Derbez called on </p>
<p>members to “avoid taking up inflexible positions”.</p>
<p><b>1104. </b> Mr Derbez stated that Mexico:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>called on the Iraqi Government “radically [to] change its attitude” to “carry out </p>
<p>immediately clear and unequivocal actions” to demonstrate it had chosen the </p>
<p>path of disarmament;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was “convinced that we have to explore all options and take advantage of all </p>
<p>opportunities to resolve this issue in a peaceful manner”;</p>
<p>343 </p>
<p>UN Security Council, ‘4714th Meeting Friday 7 March 2003’ (S/PV.4714).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insisted “on the importance of working towards a consensus position” on future </p>
<p>action with respect to Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>urged members of the Security Council “to work with greater creativity” </p>
<p>on the issue.</p>
<p><b>1105. </b> Secretary Powell stated that the Security Council had “one very, very important </p>
<p>question” of intent to address: “Has the Iraqi regime made the fundamental strategic and </p>
<p>political decision to comply with United Nations Security Council resolutions and to rid </p>
<p>itself of all of its weapons of mass destruction and the infrastructure for the development </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction?” It was not a question of “clusters of unanswered </p>
<p>questions” or benchmarks, but of whether Iraq had made the choice actively to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate. In his view, the presentations by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei had been “a </p>
<p>catalogue of non&#8209;co&#8209;operation”. Iraq’s “initiatives” were only small steps, which had been </p>
<p>“taken only grudgingly; rarely unconditionally; and primarily under the threat of force”.</p>
<p><b>1106. </b> Secretary Powell argued that the inspectors should not need more resources to </p>
<p>look for prohibited facilities. That showed Iraq was not co&#8209;operating. The Council “must </p>
<p>not allow Iraq to shift the burden of proof onto the inspectors”. Nor could the Council </p>
<p>“return to the failed bargain of resolution 1284 (1999), which offered partial relief for </p>
<p>partial disclosure”. Iraq had to be held to the terms of resolution 1441, which required </p>
<p>“full and immediate compliance”.</p>
<p><b>1107. </b> Secretary Powell stated that progress was “often more apparent than real”. </p>
<p>Missiles were being destroyed but Iraq had the infrastructure to make more, which </p>
<p>had not yet been identified and destroyed.</p>
<p><b>1108. </b> In the light of events in 1991, when the IAEA had mistakenly been about to </p>
<p>determine Iraq did not have a nuclear programme, Secretary Powell urged caution </p>
<p>in relation to Dr ElBaradei’s report, citing further information calling into question the </p>
<p>conclusion that the aluminium tubes were for unguided rockets.</p>
<p><b>1109. </b> Secretary Powell welcomed UNMOVIC’s “compilation of outstanding issues” </p>
<p>which added up to “a damning record of 12 years of lies, deception and failure to </p>
<p>come clean on the part of Iraq”. Iraq had lied to previous inspectors and planted </p>
<p>false evidence. The US view was that those activities were “still ongoing”. In 1998, </p>
<p>when faced with the threat of military action, Iraq had made promises, but had not </p>
<p>delivered. In Secretary Powell’s view, that position had not changed and the UNMOVIC </p>
<p>document revealed:</p>
<p>“… a strategic decision to delay, to deceive, to try to throw us off the trail … to hope </p>
<p>that the will of the international community will be fractured …”</p>
<p><b>1110. </b> Secretary Powell stated that the Iraqi regime had not taken the decision to disarm. </p>
<p>The Security Council “must not walk away”. If it failed to meet its responsibilities, “the </p>
<p>credibility of the Council and its ability to deal with all the critical challenges we face will </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>381</p>
<p>suffer”. It was time for the Council to send a “clear message” to Saddam Hussein about </p>
<p>the political will of the Council and its willingness to use force, if necessary, to achieve </p>
<p>the disarmament of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>1111. </b> Secretary Powell concluded that the draft resolution for action by the Council </p>
<p>was appropriate, and that it should be put to a vote “in the very near future”. He added: </p>
<p>“The clock continues to tick and the consequences of Saddam Hussein’s continued </p>
<p>refusal to disarm will be very, very real.”</p>
<p><b>1112. </b> Mr Ivanov stated that the Council’s “united, energetic efforts” and the pressure on </p>
<p>Iraq “from all sides, including the build up of a military presence” had produced progress </p>
<p>in implementing resolution 1441. There was “a real disarmament process in Iraq for the </p>
<p>first time in many years”.</p>
<p><b>1113. </b> Mr Ivanov said that he “agreed in principle” with Dr Blix that if the latest steps </p>
<p>taken by Baghdad had been taken earlier, “the results could be more convincing”. </p>
<p>But they opened the way to resolving outstanding problems. In those circumstances, </p>
<p>Mr Ivanov questioned whether it was “now reasonable to halt inspections” and resort to </p>
<p>force. Russia was “firmly in favour of continuing and strengthening inspection activities </p>
<p>and making them more focused”. The UNMOVIC work programme should include a </p>
<p>list of key disarmament tasks which should be “formulated with utmost clarity” and be </p>
<p>realisable: “That would allow us to evaluate objectively Iraq’s level of co&#8209;operation and, </p>
<p>most importantly, to provide an exhaustive answer to all the remaining open questions </p>
<p>regarding banned Iraqi military programmes.”</p>
<p><b>1114. </b> Mr Ivanov concluded with a plea that the differences in the Security Council </p>
<p>should not produce a rift, and that:</p>
<p>“Only by acting in solidarity will we effectively face up to new global threats and </p>
<p>challenges. We are certain that the Security Council has to emerge united and </p>
<p>strong from the Iraq crisis, not weakened and divided. Russia will continue to work </p>
<p>towards that goal.”</p>
<p><b>1115. </b> Mr de Villepin stated that the inspectors had revealed that Iraq had been actively </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating for a month. He asked why, in those circumstances, the Security Council </p>
<p>should engage in a war with Iraq and “smash instruments that have just proved their </p>
<p>effectiveness”. It was “clear to all that in Iraq, we are resolutely moving towards the </p>
<p>complete elimination of weapons of mass destruction programmes”.</p>
<p><b>1116. </b> Mr de Villepin argued that the Council should proceed “with information, </p>
<p>verification, destruction”; and Iraq had to provide “further information in a timely fashion”. </p>
<p>Iraq was less of a danger than in 1991. Diplomatic action was bearing fruit and the </p>
<p>American and British presence in the region lent support to the international community’s </p>
<p>collective resolve.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>1117. </b> Mr de Villepin proposed that the pace of inspections should be stepped up on the </p>
<p>basis of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a hierarchy of key disarmament tasks drawn from UNMOVIC’s work programme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a progress report from the inspectors every three weeks to maintain the </p>
<p>pressure on the Iraqi authorities; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a schedule for assessing implementation: France was willing to shorten the </p>
<p>time&#8209;frame of 120 days set out in resolution 1284 if the inspectors thought that </p>
<p>was feasible.</p>
<p><b>1118. </b> Mr de Villepin stated that the “military agenda must not dictate the calendar </p>
<p>of inspections”. France could not “accept an ultimatum as long as the inspectors are </p>
<p>reporting progress”. He asked whether “by imposing a deadline of a few days”, that </p>
<p>would be “merely seeking a pretext for war”. Some countries might believe that problems </p>
<p>could be solved by force, but not France. It believed that the use of force could “give rise </p>
<p>to resentment and to hatred, and fuel a clash of identities and civilisations – something </p>
<p>that our generation has a prime responsibility to avert”.</p>
<p><b>1119. </b> Mr de Villepin stated:</p>
<p>“To those who believe that war would be the quickest way to disarm Iraq, I can reply </p>
<p>that it would create divisions and cause wounds that would be long in the healing …</p>
<p>“… force is certainly not the best way of bringing about democracy. In this case and </p>
<p>in others, it would encourage a dangerous instability.</p>
<p>“… War would only increase it [terrorism], and we could then be faced with a new </p>
<p>wave of violence. Let us beware of playing into the hands of those who want a clash </p>
<p>of civilisations or a clash of religions.”</p>
<p><b>1120. </b> Mr de Villepin stated that France understood the “profound sense of insecurity </p>
<p>with which the American people had been living since the tragedy of 11 September </p>
<p>2001”, but there was nothing to indicate a link between the Iraq regime and Al Qaida and </p>
<p>the world would not be a safer place after a military intervention in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>1121. </b> Mr de Villepin argued for priority to be given to addressing the crisis in the Middle </p>
<p>East, which represented “our greatest challenge in terms of security and justice”.</p>
<p><b>1122. </b> Mr de Villepin concluded that the Council would face a choice of disarming Iraq </p>
<p>through war or peace, and that to make that choice heads of State and Government </p>
<p>should meet.</p>
<p><b>1123. </b> Mr Tang stated that resolution 1441 had been “widely welcomed and supported” </p>
<p>because it manifested the determination of the Council to destroy Iraq’s WMD and “truly </p>
<p>reflected the desire of the international community for a political settlement”. There </p>
<p>had been “much progress” on inspections. It was “true” that there were “problems and </p>
<p>difficulties”, but that was “exactly why” it was “necessary to continue the inspections”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>1124. </b> China believed that a political settlement could still attain the goal of destroying </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD. That would “need resolve and determination and, more importantly, </p>
<p>patience and wisdom”. China was “not in favour of a new resolution, particularly </p>
<p>one authorising the use of force”. The power of the Security Council was derived from </p>
<p>all UN member states and it had “no reason to remain indifferent” to the calls for “peace </p>
<p>not war” from the peoples of many countries. The Chinese Government strongly </p>
<p>appealed “to the Council to shoulder its responsibility and to do all it can to avoid war </p>
<p>and to maintain its efforts to achieve a political settlement”.</p>
<p><b>1125. </b> Mrs Alvear stated that the reports by Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei allowed Chile </p>
<p>“to infer” that Iraq’s co&#8209;operation was “inadequate” and the signs of progress in specific </p>
<p>areas did not detract from that conclusion. Chile reaffirmed the need for the “immediate, </p>
<p>full and effective disarmament of Iraq” and reiterated its “urgent appeal to Iraq” to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate. Chile supported “a solution in keeping with international law and with the </p>
<p>purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter”, which was the only source of </p>
<p>legitimacy for the Council’s decisions.</p>
<p><b>1126. </b> Chile appealed to the five Permanent Members of the Council to find a point of </p>
<p>convergence and “advocated the continuation of rigorous inspections subject to a time </p>
<p>limit”. The use of force under Chapter VII of the Charter could be invoked “only when </p>
<p>all peaceful means of disarming Iraq have been exhausted”. Chile believed a solution </p>
<p>was possible through a “strengthening of inspections … with clear deadlines and </p>
<p>concrete demands”.</p>
<p><b>1127. </b> Ms Palacio stated that the Council had “been marking time for 12 years” and </p>
<p>that the Council found itself in the “same situation as in 1991”. Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>strategy remained to deceive. She questioned how much time was necessary to take </p>
<p>the strategic decision to collaborate. Saddam Hussein had managed to divide the </p>
<p>international community and to reverse the burden of proof. Only maximum pressure </p>
<p>and the credible threat of force could make an impression on the Iraqi regime. Why </p>
<p>should the international community believe Saddam Hussein’s claims that he had </p>
<p>destroyed all his weapons without being able to detect a “genuine will to disarm”.</p>
<p><b>1128. </b> Ms Palacio stated that the Security Council should send clear messages to Iraq </p>
<p>about its determination to achieve complete disarmament and that the Council should </p>
<p>assume its responsibilities to respond. A strategy of more inspectors or more time was </p>
<p>“merely the strategy of impotence”. It was possible to envisage results with respect to </p>
<p>nuclear material and missiles without Iraq’s pro&#8209;active collaboration, but that was “not </p>
<p>true for chemical or bacteriological weapons”. Spain wanted a peace that was “safe and </p>
<p>that ensures that those weapons will not be used by Iraq and that they will not fall into </p>
<p>the hands of terrorist groups”.</p>
<p><b>1129. </b> In his speech to the Security Council, Mr Straw stated that everyone agreed Iraq </p>
<p>must be fully disarmed and that “Iraq’s failure to co&#8209;operate immediately, unconditionally </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>384</p>
<p>and actively with the inspectors” had to be “dealt with”.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> The first question for the </p>
<p>Council was, “has Iraq taken this final opportunity”? His answer was that, as no&#8209;one </p>
<p>had said Iraq was “now fully, actively and immediately in compliance”, it had “not so far </p>
<p>taken this final opportunity”.</p>
<p><b>1130. </b> Dr Blix’s “clusters” document to the Council was a “chilling” account of Iraq’s </p>
<p>non&#8209;compliance over 12 years and there had “not been active co&#8209;operation in the areas </p>
<p>which matter”. The examples cited by Mr Straw included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “dragged its feet on as many elements of procedural and substantive </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation as possible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was still refusing to pass a law prohibiting State authorities from engaging </p>
<p>on work relating to weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “done everything possible to prevent unrestricted, unrecorded </p>
<p>interviews”. Of the 3,500 people on UNSCOM’s lists, “just twelve private </p>
<p>interviews had been allowed”, and “all of those … were threatened and </p>
<p>intimidated beforehand”. He understood that “the scientists most likely to have </p>
<p>the most incriminating evidence have been locked away”. There had been no </p>
<p>interviews outside Iraq. Mr Straw stated: “The restrictions placed on [these] </p>
<p>interviews is itself the most incriminating evidence that Saddam has something </p>
<p>to hide.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Under&#8209;reporting of the import of Al Samoud 2 missile engines and the missile’s </p>
<p>range were examples of Iraq’s “calculation that it can satisfy the Council with </p>
<p>a partial response”.</p>
<p><b>1131. </b> Addressing the memorandum produced by France, Germany and Russia, </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated that “it defies experience to believe that continuing inspections </p>
<p>with no firm end date” would achieve complete disarmament “if Iraq’s full and active </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation” was not “immediately forthcoming”. The memorandum was “not </p>
<p>even a formula for containment, given Iraq’s proven ability to develop weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>1132. </b> Mr Straw welcomed the progress the inspectors had reported. His “earnest wish”, </p>
<p>and that of the UK Government, was to achieve Iraq’s disarmament, “if possible by </p>
<p>peaceful means”. But it was necessary to recognise that “the progress that has been </p>
<p>reported represents only the tip of a very large iceberg of huge unfinished business </p>
<p>required of Iraq”. He also welcomed the diplomatic pressure on Iraq but suggested it </p>
<p>was the presence of US and UK troops in the region which had influenced the recent </p>
<p>increase in Iraq’s co&#8209;operation.</p>
<p><b>1133. </b> Addressing Mr de Villepin’s statement that “the choice before us was </p>
<p>disarmament by peace or disarmament by war”, Mr Straw pointed out that that was </p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>385</p>
<p>“a false choice”. The paradox was that diplomacy had to be backed by a credible threat </p>
<p>of force to achieve Iraq’s disarmament by peaceful means. He wished:</p>
<p>“… we lived in a different world where this was not necessary, but … the choice is </p>
<p>not ours as to how this disarmament takes place – the choice is Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>… he can act with astonishing speed when he chooses to … It may take time to </p>
<p>fabricate falsehoods but the truth takes only seconds to tell.”</p>
<p><b>1134. </b> In response to Mr de Villepin’s concerns about automaticity, Mr Straw added that </p>
<p>the threat of force or its use had:</p>
<p>“… always been conditional. It would be utterly irresponsible and in defiance of our </p>
<p>solemn duties to the Council for us to walk into a situation where force was used </p>
<p>automatically …”</p>
<p><b>1135. </b> In conclusion, Mr Straw stated that the UK remained “committed to exploring </p>
<p>every reasonable option for a peaceful outcome and every prospect of a Council </p>
<p>consensus”. He asked, on behalf of the UK, US and Spain as co&#8209;sponsors, for a revised </p>
<p>draft of the second resolution to be circulated.</p>
<p><b>1136. </b> In his memoir, Mr Straw wrote that he had deliberately picked up Mr de Villepin’s </p>
<p>words and “There was not a word in my speech about the intelligence. It was the </p>
<p>indisputable facts of Saddam’s behaviour that convinced me we had to act.”</p>
<p>345</p>
<p><b>1137. </b> Mr Georges Chikoti, the Angolan Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, stated that </p>
<p>the reports from Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei showed that Iraq’s co&#8209;operation was “relatively </p>
<p>insufficient” and called on Iraq to take a more energetic and pro&#8209;active role.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>suggested that the progress made was associated with specific benchmarks and dates. </p>
<p>That might be a model for strengthening the scope and intrusiveness of inspections.</p>
<p><b>1138. </b> Mr Chikoti noted that international community, regional and sub&#8209;regional </p>
<p>organisations and international public opinion had been calling for the peaceful </p>
<p>disarmament. Those were “valid and legitimate concerns” but they could not be </p>
<p>“interpreted or transformed into an unwillingness to act”. The responsibilities of the Council </p>
<p>included “exhausting all diplomatic and peaceful means to achieve such disarmament”.</p>
<p><b>1139. </b> Mr Belinga&#8209;Eboutou stated that Cameroon was pleased to note the momentum </p>
<p>of inspections was “well established”. UNMOVIC’s report from the inspectors showed </p>
<p>real progress but also made clear that the results had “been very limited so far”. </p>
<p>Cameroon did not believe that Iraq had “yet taken the final opportunity afforded by … </p>
<p>resolution 1441”. It was in favour of inspections but they should not go on “indefinitely”. </p>
<p>The Council should “together seek, in good faith, a credible alternative to war and to </p>
<p>endless inspections”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>386</p>
<p><b>1140. </b> Mr Belinga&#8209;Eboutou identified the “major and central problem” was to “induce </p>
<p>the Iraqi authorities to co&#8209;operate actively, fully and unconditionally”. The “gravity of the </p>
<p>situation and the need for effectiveness” required the Council to “harmonise viewpoints </p>
<p>through mutual concessions” to find a solution based on consensus. Council members </p>
<p>should build a common position to make it clear to Iraq that if it wanted peaceful </p>
<p>disarmament it had “no alternative but to abide by the decisions of the international </p>
<p>community”.</p>
<p><b>1141. </b> Mr Tafrov stated that Dr Blix’s report was nuanced. Results to date had been </p>
<p>“modest”. Co&#8209;operation was “insufficient” and Bulgaria’s view was that Iraq was still </p>
<p>in material breach of resolution 1441.</p>
<p><b>1142. </b> Mr Tafrov thought that the tripartite memorandum and the draft resolution </p>
<p>submitted by Spain, the US and the UK were “not incompatible”. Bulgaria agreed with </p>
<p>France, Germany and Russia that the pressure on Iraq must be increased and the draft </p>
<p>resolution was an effective means to do so. Its adoption would be “a logical continuation </p>
<p>of the efforts of the Security Council to make Iraq understand that patience has its </p>
<p>limits”. Bulgaria called for unity of the Council to preserve the credibility of the United </p>
<p>Nations and a means to achieve Iraq’s disarmament, and for an additional effort for </p>
<p>peaceful disarmament.</p>
<p><b>1143. </b> Mr Akram stated that, if war was to be avoided, the Council must impress on Iraq </p>
<p>that it must comply “fully and faithfully”. It was “unfortunate” that “divergent approaches” </p>
<p>had emerged within the Council. Pakistan believed that “an agreed approach can </p>
<p>and must be evolved”. He stated: “Once we establish the ways to credibly achieve </p>
<p>the disarmament of Iraq … we can also agree on a relatively short time frame.” That </p>
<p>proposition “would be better than propositions that could result in the early use of force”. </p>
<p>Pakistan did not believe there was an “imminent threat to international peace and </p>
<p>security” and the “cost of delay” would be “much less than the cost of war”. War would </p>
<p>“have grave consequences for the Iraqi people, for peace and stability in our fragile </p>
<p>region, for international security and for a world order based on the principles of the </p>
<p>United Nations Charter and the rule of law”.</p>
<p><b>1144. </b> Mr François Lounceny Fall, the President of the Council and the Guinean Foreign </p>
<p>Minister, stated that Guinea “remained convinced” that “while the opportunity for a </p>
<p>peaceful solution still exists”, it could “be seized only if the Iraqi authorities co&#8209;operate </p>
<p>sincerely”. Guinea was “in favour of continued inspections” but believed they could not </p>
<p>“go on indefinitely”. A more unified approach from the Council was the “only course” that </p>
<p>could give the Council’s actions “the necessary authority and legitimacy”.</p>
<p><b>1145. </b> Mr Aldouri underlined Iraq’s “pledge to continue pro&#8209;active co&#8209;operation” with </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA. He drew attention to the position of France, Germany, Russia </p>
<p>and China who had demanded that the work of the inspectors should continue and that </p>
<p>they should “be given enough time to complete their tasks by peaceful means”.</p>

<p><b>1146. </b> Responding to Secretary Powell’s statement that there was a lack of a strategic </p>
<p>political decision by Iraq to demonstrate its commitment to comply with the UN </p>
<p>resolutions, Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had taken “the strategic decision to rid itself </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction” in 1991. He added that:</p>
<p>“All weapons that have been proscribed fall into one of two categories: they have </p>
<p>been either declared or unilaterally destroyed by Iraq. All the declarations that Iraq </p>
<p>has been repeatedly asked to present concerned the details and verification of that </p>
<p>unilateral destruction and nothing … else. It is for the accusers to prove otherwise, </p>
<p>if they possess any evidence.”</p>
<p><b>1147. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that Iraq had no VX programme.</p>
<p><b>1148. </b> Mr Aldouri stated that the issues of concern identified by the US and UK were “an </p>
<p>attempt to confuse the issue” and mask their real agenda to take over Iraq’s oil and the </p>
<p>political and economic domination of the region. Iraq continued to hope for justice from </p>
<p>the Security Council and called on the Council to thwart aggression and prevent “a crime </p>
<p>whose impact would far surpass that of any crime of the past century”. He concluded:</p>
<p>“… war against Iraq will wreak destruction, but it will not unearth any weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction, for one very simple reason: there are no such weapons, except </p>
<p>in the imagination of some …”</p>
<p><b>1149.  Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that questions had been raised about what </b></p>

<p>Mr Annan had appealed for Council unity and for UN responsibility post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>on humanitarian relief and administrative matters.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had “defended the ultimatum idea and focused it on Iraqi co&#8209;operation, </p>
<p>which needed no time at all to signal convincingly”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had said the “US would not have come to the UN unless it </p>
<p>believed in collective action” and that the US “would want the UN in Iraq as soon </p>
<p>as circumstances allowed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr Blix had said that the “months he needed were for verification with a </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>1152. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that “no votes were visibly harvested”. The “body </p>
<p>language” of African members “much improved” over the two days Mr Straw had been in </p>
<p>New York; but:</p>
<p>“We have not yet avoided the benchmarks problem … what would demonstrate </p>
<p>that Iraq had taken the strategic decision to disarm… We could well need a side </p>
<p>statement to bring the Latins on board.”</p>
<p><b>1153. </b> The Council was followed by “a long session of informal consultations”.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>1154. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported that discussion had centred on three questions </p>
<p>raised by Mr Zinser:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What did the Security Council have to do to avoid the use of force?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What did Saddam Hussein have to do?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“How long did the Council have to address these issues?”</p>
<p><b>1155. </b> The points made by Sir Jeremy included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The core issue was making “best use of the limited time left”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Security Council “could not, in the light of existing resolutions … set itself </p>
<p>the aim of ‘avoiding war’ … The real question was how the Council could ensure </p>
<p>full implementation of the relevant resolutions (ie complete disarmament without </p>
<p>resort to force.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council “should unite in exerting the heaviest pressure on Iraq so that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein embarked on the road to peace before the road to war </p>
<p>was authorised”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Indefinite delay was an abdication of the Council’s responsibilities. Time would </p>
<p>be needed to reach ‘full and verified disarmament’; but the alternative was not </p>
<p>an open&#8209;ended invitation to conduct investigations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “had to convince the co&#8209;sponsors and the Council that he and </p>
<p>his regime had indeed changed their attitude and taken a strategic decision to </p>
<p>disarm voluntarily”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no real evidence of non&#8209;compliance on the nuclear weapons file”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “key question” was whether Iraq had WMD: “The UK was sure they did. But </p>
<p>the WMD could not be located because Iraq had hidden them, and they would </p>
<p>not be found without unconditional and immediate Iraqi co&#8209;operation.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK “had invested time and money in finding out the truth. So </p>
<p>we knew that WMD were being moved every 12 hours; that mobile weapons </p>
<p>facilities existed; and that documents and materials were being moved around.”</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>389</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Council “had not made the best use of its time since adoption of [resolution] </p>
<p>1441. In an understandable wish to avoid war, colleagues had perhaps not really </p>
<p>believed the UK/US warnings: but we had taken a decision to put our need for </p>
<p>long term security over our wish to avoid war.”</p>
<p><b>1156. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had asked Dr Blix and Dr ElBaradei a series </p>
<p>of questions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“How could they be sure the interviewees were not being bugged </p>
<p>or threatened?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What real chance was there of UNMOVIC resolving the mobile biological </p>
<p>facilities issues without Iraqi co&#8209;operation?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Was there any evidence of Iraqi procurement and sites associated with </p>
<p>this programme?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was UNMOVIC’s “assessment of Iraq’s declaration in relation to UAVs”?</p>
<p><b>1157. </b> Ambassador Cunningham stated that the French and German proposals </p>
<p>assumed Iraqi co&#8209;operation, but “it was hard, reading the UNMOVIC cluster document, </p>
<p>to conclude that verifiable disarmament could happen in the near future or was ever </p>
<p>feasible”. Iraq was “behaving now as it had always done”. Subsequently, he stated </p>
<p>that if the Council “spent the next 10 days dreaming about benchmarks it would miss </p>
<p>its final opportunity to secure a peaceful outcome”. The Council “could assist by </p>
<p>bringing maximum pressure to bear”; but since 20 January, “Baghdad had felt under </p>
<p>no pressure”.</p>
<p><b>1158. </b> Mr de La Sablière was reported to be “troubled that the Council’s timetable was </p>
<p>being fixed by the US military agenda, and by having to discuss the choice between </p>
<p>war and peace when inspections still offered a real chance of peaceful disarmament”. </p>
<p>The “clusters” document gave the Council an objective basis to address the state of </p>
<p>Iraqi disarmament and: “Only a few questions were left to be addressed: Iraq was </p>
<p>‘largely disarmed’ …” The inspectors “should list the priority issues to be addressed and </p>
<p>the key remaining disarmament tasks”.</p>
<p><b>1159. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Spain questioned Mr de La Sablière’s comments and whether the Council was </p>
<p>“really being asked to believe that Saddam Hussein had complied fully with </p>
<p>resolution 1441”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia said it was clear that, to avoid war the Council had to continue </p>
<p>inspections. It also asked whether any of the intelligence received had helped </p>
<p>the inspectors to find anything.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>China said the inspections were working and producing results; they should </p>
<p>continue. The draft resolution would “strangle the 1441 system in its infancy”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Germany stated that it made no sense to break off inspections, especially when </p>
<p>the process was delivering results. The only way forward was for UNMOVIC and </p>
<p>the IAEA to produce objective criteria.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cameroon stated that the threat of force had been a key element in the progress </p>
<p>so far and military forces could not be left in place indefinitely, but 17 March </p>
<p>might be too soon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bulgaria had been ready to support the previous draft and “was studying the </p>
<p>latest proposal positively”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Syria said there had to be a peaceful resolution of the issue and the inspectors </p>
<p>should produce a specific work programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Chile agreed that the Council should work for a consensus; the inspection </p>
<p>process must be allowed to mature; and Iraq must comply immediately. But </p>
<p>he questioned how Saddam Hussein was to be judged. The real question was </p>
<p>“whether the threat posed by Iraq was such that there had to be an end now </p>
<p>to inspections”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US responded to Chile that the Council should judge Iraq on the basis </p>
<p>of its experience. Iraqi co&#8209;operation over the years was grudging at best.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For the UK, Sir Jeremy Greenstock said that, if Saddam Hussein admitted </p>
<p>he had lied about Iraq’s WMD over the years, “that would go a long way to </p>
<p>convincing us that he had had a real change of heart. If he came forward with </p>
<p>the truth; that would be respected. If he lied, he would be dealt with.”</p>
<p><b>1160. </b> In response to the points raised, Dr Blix stated that UNMOVIC worked under </p>
<p>resolutions 1284 (1999) and 1441 (2002). The former asked for “a work programme and </p>
<p>key disarmament tasks”. UNMOVIC “did not yet know which of the many issues … were </p>
<p>the key remaining tasks”; it “aimed to submit a list to the Council in the week beginning </p>
<p>19 [sic] March”. The Council had asked UNMOVIC to “complete” the “remaining” </p>
<p>disarmament tasks. Resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… imposed a greater sense of urgency on the inspection and disarmament process, </p>
<p>but he did not think the Council’s resolutions necessarily led to the conclusion that </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s activities should cease as soon as next week. The resolutions did not </p>
<p>demand ‘immediate disarmament’ but ‘immediate co&#8209;operation’ …”</p>
<p><b>1161. </b> Dr Blix was also reported to have stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi co&#8209;operation “sometimes seemed grudging”, but “only if UNMOVIC </p>
<p>found that Iraq was concealing things could one say that there was a real lack </p>
<p>of co&#8209;operation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With the Al Samoud missiles and UAVs, Iraq was “trying to push to the </p>
<p>boundaries of what was permissible”. On the former, Iraq had arguably </p>
<p>“trespassed over the border”; the resolution did not prohibit UAVs, but they were </p>
<p>“on the border of what was allowed”. UNMOVIC was “still investigating”.</p>

<p>3.7  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 1 February to 7 March 2003</p>
<p>391</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq “seemed to be trying to find ways of assisting UNMOVIC” on mobile </p>
<p>BW facilities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Walls “might contain eavesdropping devices, but even taking witnesses to </p>
<p>Cyprus might not necessarily guarantee truthful evidence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC “could be expected to deal with the key remaining disarmament tasks </p>
<p>in a matter of months”. The timetable proposed in the draft resolution “could not </p>
<p>conceivably allow completion”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “frantic” but “selective” in its co&#8209;operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “strategic decision” by Iraq to co&#8209;operate would be easily recognised.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Various intelligence agencies were sure Iraq had retained ‘a jumpstart’ capacity, </p>
<p>but UNMOVIC had seen no hard evidence.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Not all the evidence the inspectors had been given “was convincing, and some </p>
<p>of it was not even trustworthy”.</p>
<p><b>1162. </b> Dr ElBaradei stated that the IAEA had nearly reached a satisfactory outcome and </p>
<p>two to three more months would lead to a conclusion. The test applied to Iraq had to be </p>
<p>“an objective results oriented one”.</p>
<p><b>1163. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that initial reactions to the revised draft resolution had </p>
<p>focused on “the short time offered to Iraq to comply and on the ultimatum”.</p>
<p><b>1164. </b> Following a meeting between Mr Straw and Mr Tang, Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>reported that China did not want a second resolution “now”; was concerned about the </p>
<p>economic, political and humanitarian consequences of a conflict; and the consequences </p>
<p>for the UN of a public split amongst the P5.</p>

<p>make use of it to show what concrete benchmarks might look like. Their US and </p>
<p>UK colleagues, by contrast, were therefore able to make extensive and preemptive </p>
<p>use of the draft to show how unreliable Iraqi declarations and conduct had been in </p>
<p>the past.”</p>
<p><b>1167. </b> Dr Blix added that Mr John Wolf, the US Commissioner, had been critical of the </p>
<p>relevance of the draft “clusters” document, which provided “only a readable historical </p>
<p>account testifying to Iraq’s deception” and had only a few pages on what had happened </p>
<p>after 1998. The US was interested in whether Iraq had taken “a strategic decision”, </p>
<p>and that “was all that mattered”. The US “did not afford the smallest window to the </p>
<p>benchmark approach that Washington saw London working on”. The US “disdain” had </p>
<p>“shocked and surprised the other members of the College”.</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s conversation with President Putin, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>1168.  President Putin told Mr Blair on 7 March that Russia would oppose </b></p>
<p><b>military action.</b></p>
<p><b>1169. </b> Following the discussions with Mr Ivanov on 4 and 5 March and the observation </p>
<p>in Mr Brenton’s telegram of 6 March, that the Americans were sanguine about avoiding </p>
<p>a Russian veto, Sir Roderic Lyne wrote to Mr Ricketts on 6 March with advice, including </p>
<p>for Mr Blair’s planned telephone conversation with President Putin.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> The letter was </p>
<p>copied to Sir David Manning.</p>
<p><b>1170. </b> Sir Roderic wrote that he was “less sanguine” about avoiding a Russian veto </p>
<p>unless the French position changed. Mr Ivanov’s aim was to help deny nine positive </p>
<p>votes for the resolution and thereby avoid the need to take a definitive decision. He </p>
<p>would have reported to President Putin that the UK was not totally confident of success </p>
<p>and was looking at concessions over language.</p>
<p><b>1171. </b> Sir Roderic suggested that when Mr Blair spoke to President Putin, he should </p>
<p>repeat and reinforce the message that he had given to Mr Ivanov, and argue that the </p>
<p>issue was about two fundamental questions of principle:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to deal with the problem of proliferation. That was: “big … and … </p>
<p>getting worse … The international community had let this drift … We have to </p>
<p>work together on this. We can’t go around attacking everyone; but if Iraq gets </p>
<p>away with it, it’s open house for everyone … we’ve got to send the message </p>

<p>that the Iraqi threat is over. Dealing with it … will help us stabilise the Middle </p>
<p>East (it’s what moderate Arabs privately want). And, with this behind us, we can </p>
<p>get together to bring the full range of diplomatic pressures to bear on those who </p>
<p>proliferate or support terrorism.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A multilateral approach to the problem was “hanging in the balance”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>had “persuaded” President Bush to go through the UN because he wanted to </p>
<p>“preserve the Security Council” and wanted “the UN – and all of us, Russia </p>
<p>included – to have a say in what happens thereafter in and around Iraq”. </p>
<p>That was “as much in Russia’s interest as the UK’s”.</p>
<p><b>1172. </b> The conversation with President Putin lasted over an hour. Mr Blair emphasised </p>
<p>the importance of working with Russia as a partner and the need to stand firm in </p>
<p>dealing with the threat of terrorism and WMD.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> The record stated that Mr Blair had told </p>
<p>President Putin that resolution 1441 had given Saddam Hussein a final opportunity:</p>
<p>“He had made some concessions with troops on his doorstep, but he was not </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating fully and had no intention of disarming. We must carry out what we </p>
<p>had said we would do to uphold UN authority and avoid unilateral action. So we </p>
<p>would put the second resolution to a vote, with terms to be discussed. We would </p>
<p>have nine or ten votes.”</p>
<p><b>1173. </b> During the conversation – and in response to a suggestion that Iraq was currently </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating, presented no threat to its close neighbours or to the US or UK, had </p>
<p>nothing to do with fundamentalist terrorists, and that inspections should continue on the </p>
<p>basis of the disarmament tasks based on resolution 1284 (1999) – Mr Blair argued that </p>
<p>the time required was that needed to make a judgement about whether there was full </p>
<p>Iraqi co&#8209;operation; and that Dr Blix’s “clusters” document would set out the outstanding </p>
<p>items. In his view:</p>
<p>“In the absence of full co&#8209;operation, Iraq was in breach … we must explore every </p>
<p>possibility to resolve the issue peacefully, including through forcing Saddam into </p>
<p>exile. Saddam would only do so if he thought the alternative was force.”</p>
<p><b>1174. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that President Putin thought military action would be a </p>
<p>mistake which Russia would oppose. He commented that President Putin had been:</p>
<p>“… unyielding, but at pains to spell out his reasoning in great detail … On the face </p>
<p>of it, a clear intention to veto. But there may have been just a hint that if negotiations </p>
<p>begin in New York, and engage Moscow, that he will at least be ready to listen.”</p>

<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s advice, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>1175. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote to Mr Blair on 7 March, recording that he had been asked </p>
<p>for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without another resolution of the </p>
<p>Security Council.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>1176. </b> That is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>1177.  When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush at 1800 on 7 March, he emphasised </b></p>
<p><b>the importance of securing nine positive votes in the Security Council for </b></p>
<p><b>Parliamentary approval for UK military action.</b></p>
<p><b>1178.  Mr Blair argued that while the 17 March deadline in the draft resolution was </b></p>
<p><b>not sufficient for Iraq to disarm fully, it was sufficient to make a judgement on </b></p>
<p><b>whether Saddam Hussein had had a change of heart. If Iraq started to co-operate, </b></p>
<p><b>the inspectors could have as much time as they liked.</b></p>
<p><b>1179. </b> Sir David Manning discussed the response to French and Russian tactics to try to </p>
<p>prevent a vote on the draft resolution with Dr Rice on 7 March.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> Sir David told Dr Rice </p>
<p>that the UK “had to have” a vote: that it “had to have one that was understood to be an </p>
<p>ultimatum”; and that it “had to have nine votes”. The UK “could probably manage the </p>
<p>political fall&#8209;out if there were a veto, or perhaps even two vetoes”, but the UK “could not </p>
<p>take part in military campaign if they did not reach the nine vote threshold. We would not </p>
<p>be able to get the necessary Parliamentary support.”</p>
<p><b>1180. </b> Sir David Manning subsequently told Dr Rice that President Putin was opposed </p>
<p>to the resolution and would reject it. There was also a further discussion of the political </p>
<p>position in the UK: Sir David “repeated at length” the point he had made that morning </p>
<p>and said that “we had to do whatever it took to secure nine votes”. That “might mean </p>
<p>adjusting the wording of the second resolution; it might mean time; or it might mean </p>
<p>some sort of benchmarking”.</p>
<p><b>1181. </b> Sir David reported that Dr Rice had assured him that President Bush was </p>
<p>determined to deliver nine votes. Sir David also commented: “But although the </p>
<p>Administration is clearly pulling out all the stops, there is still no sign of willingness </p>
<p>to accept that this may mean extending the time lines.”</p>
<p><b>1182. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries:</p>
<p>“Condi [Rice] had told David [Manning] overnight that Putin had been clear with </p>
<p>Bush that they would veto a second resolution. Also we still didn’t have a clue as </p>
<p>to whether Chile and Mexico would come over. The mood was gloomier than ever. </p>

<p>395</p>
<p>TB was keen to get up the clusters document and also move towards the sense </p>
<p>of an ultimatum. He and David were both now expressing their irritation at the US. </p>
<p>David was even of the view that we should be pushing the US to a version of the </p>
<p>Franco&#8209;German idea of inspections with force, a blue beret [UN] force involved </p>
<p>on disarmament.”</p>
<p>355</p>
<p><b>1183. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush, they discussed progress and further </p>
<p>lobbying.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>1184. </b> Mr Blair emphasised again the importance of securing nine positive votes </p>
<p>for Parliamentary approval for military action.</p>
<p><b>1185. </b> Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… there remained a confusion in many minds … about time. If Saddam had </p>
<p>decided to co&#8209;operate fully, the inspectors could have as much time as they wanted. </p>
<p>But he had not – no&#8209;one believed he was co&#8209;operating unconditionally and fully. Ten </p>
<p>days was of course not enough for him to disarm fully, but it was enough to make </p>
<p>a judgement on whether there was a change of heart. In 1441 we had all agreed to </p>
<p>full, immediate and unconditional co&#8209;operation, not concessions dribbled out under </p>
<p>the threat of force.”</p>
<p><b>1186. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… wanted to give him [President Bush] a clear message about the political realities, </p>
<p>namely that we couldn’t do this without a Commons vote and it was not going to be </p>
<p>easy without a second resolution, or with a resolution that was vetoed. The Russian </p>
<p>veto was a new element … Putin’s position had clearly hardened. During their call </p>
<p>Putin was very clear that he felt taken for granted by the Americans …”</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>1187. </b> Mr Campbell also wrote that President Bush:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was agreeing to a slightly later deadline, 17 March;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had told Mr Blair that he would “certainly go for a vote on the second resolution”, </p>
<p>although he was “still making clear he didn’t feel he needed a UNSCR”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“was at least conscious of the difficulties they gave us”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had said to Mr Blair, “don’t worry, I’ll be more subtle than you fear …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>396</p>
<p>if he lost the vote in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair “still felt </p>
<p>we were doing the right thing. He said even though we were all rightly irritated by the </p>
<p>Americans, it was the French we should be really angry with.”</p>
<p><b>1189. </b> Mr Campbell added:</p>
<p>“We were all outraged at the Blix report. TB said it was political and dishonest … </p>
<p>Scarlett said he was wrong in saying the Iraqis were trying to co&#8209;operate more … TB </p>
<p>was very philosophic about it all. As I sat listening to him on the phone, I lost count of </p>
<p>how many times he said: 1. we are right on the issue; 2. we have to see it through; </p>
<p>3, I’m philosophical about what it means for me and whether I survive or not. TB </p>
<p>was keen to push the idea that the only reason the concessions were coming was </p>
<p>because of the pressure we were applying. But there were very real divisions and </p>
<p>dangers and the UN was on dangerous terrain. There was a very clear picture, </p>
<p>clearer than ever, of the US in one place, us in another, the French in another, the </p>
<p>Russians in another, and the UN as an organisation really worried about where it </p>
<p>was heading.”</p>
<p><b>1190. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that on 8 March: “Blix didn’t come out as badly as it might </p>
<p>have done. In a sense he was almost irrelevant now.”</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> He had agreed with Mr Blair </p>
<p>“the lines to push for the Sundays [Sunday newspapers] – namely there are two routes </p>
<p>by which he can avoid conflict: 1. he disarms, or 2. he goes.” The key was winning the </p>
<p>necessary votes at the UN. Mr Blair “was clear we just had to keep our nerve and keep </p>
<p>striving to get their votes”.</p>
<p><b>1191. </b> Mr Cook wrote that Dr Blix’s report was “carefully balanced” and “painfully </p>
<p>honest”, which was not what the US and UK needed: “No.10 desperately wanted Blix </p>
<p>to lay into Saddam and to report no progress, in order that they could mobilise the </p>
<p>Security Council for war.”</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>1192. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Blair drew attention to the passage in Dr Blix’s </p>
<p>report which stated:</p>
<p>“It is obvious that while the numerous initiatives which are now taken by the Iraqi </p>
<p>side with a view to resolving some longstanding, open disarmament issues can </p>
<p>be seen as active or even proactive. These initiatives three or four months into the </p>
<p>new resolution, cannot be said to constitute immediate co&#8209;operation. Nor do they </p>
<p>necessarily cover all areas of relevance. They are nonetheless welcome.”</p>
