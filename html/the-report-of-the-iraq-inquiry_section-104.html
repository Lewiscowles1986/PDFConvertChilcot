<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>528</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses analysis and findings in relation to the evidence set out in </p>
<p>Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development and implementation of UK reconstruction policy, strategy and </p>
<p>plans;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with the US and successive Iraqi Governments on </p>
<p>reconstruction; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s policy on Iraq’s oil and oil revenues; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s support for UK businesses in securing reconstruction </p>
<p>contracts; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>debt relief; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reform of the UK’s approach to post&#8209;conflict reconstruction and stabilisation.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparing to provide humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, </p>
<p>which is addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the financial and human resources available for post&#8209;conflict reconstruction, </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 13 and 15 respectively; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification and Security Sector Reform, addressed in Sections 11 </p>
<p>and 12 respectively; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of UK strategy and deployment plans, addressed in Section 9.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> During the period covered by the Inquiry, the Government used a number of different </p>
<p>terms to describe post&#8209;conflict activity in Iraq, including “reconstruction”. It did not </p>
<p>generally define those terms. The Inquiry uses the term “reconstruction” in line with the </p>
<p>Government’s common usage:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to include work to repair and build infrastructure, deliver essential services and </p>
<p>create jobs; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to include work to build the capacity of Iraqi institutions and reform Iraq’s </p>
<p>economic, legislative and governance structures; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to exclude Security Sector Reform. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>529</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK failed to plan or prepare for the major reconstruction programme required </p>
<p>in Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction was the third pillar in a succession of UK strategies for Iraq. </p>
<p>The Government never resolved how reconstruction would support broader UK </p>
<p>objectives. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Following the resignation of Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, </p>
<p>and the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1483 in May 2003, DFID assumed </p>
<p>leadership of the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq. DFID would subsequently define, </p>
<p>within the framework established by the Government, the scope and nature of </p>
<p>that effort. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At key points, DFID should have considered strategic questions about the scale, </p>
<p>focus and purpose of the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US&#8209;led Coalition Provisional Authority excluded the UK from discussions on oil </p>
<p>policy and on disbursements from the Development Fund for Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Many of the failures which affected pre&#8209;invasion planning and preparation persisted </p>
<p>throughout the post&#8209;conflict period. They included poor inter&#8209;departmental </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination, inadequate civilian&#8209;military co&#8209;operation and a failure to use resources </p>
<p>coherently.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An unstable and insecure environment made it increasingly difficult to make progress </p>
<p>on reconstruction. Although staff and contractors developed innovative ways to </p>
<p>deliver projects and manage risks, the constraints were never overcome. Witnesses </p>
<p>to the Inquiry identified some successes, in particular in building the capacity of </p>
<p>central Iraqi Government institutions and the provincial government in Basra. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lessons learned through successive reviews of the UK approach to post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction and stabilisation, in Iraq and elsewhere, were not applied in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Pre&#8209;invasion planning and preparation</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> When military operations against Iraq began on the night of 19/20 March 2003, the </p>
<p>Government had not: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>made contingency preparations for the deployment of more than a handful of UK </p>
<p>civilians to Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allocated any funding for post&#8209;conflict reconstruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawn up any plans to deliver essential services and reconstruction in the South, </p>
<p>in line with the UK’s likely obligations as an Occupying Power;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>established mechanisms within Whitehall which could co&#8209;ordinate and drive </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict reconstruction; or </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allocated responsibility to any department or unit for planning and delivering the </p>
<p>UK’s contribution to post&#8209;conflict reconstruction.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>530</p>
<p><b>5. </b> Section 6.5 concludes that Ministers, officials and the military continued to assume </p>
<p>that the US could act as guarantor of the UK’s objectives, including its reconstruction </p>
<p>objectives, in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Government had established the inter&#8209;departmental (FCO/MOD/DFID) Iraq </p>
<p>Planning Unit (IPU) on 10 February 2003 to provide “policy guidance on the practical </p>
<p>questions” that UK civilian officials and military commanders would face in a post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> The head of the IPU was a senior member of the Diplomatic Service, who reported </p>
<p>to the FCO Director Middle East and North Africa. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The creation of the Ad Hoc Group on Iraq (see Section 6.4) in September 2002 </p>
<p>and the IPU improved co&#8209;ordination across government at official level, but neither </p>
<p>body carried sufficient authority to establish a unified planning process across the </p>
<p>four principal departments involved – the FCO, the MOD, DFID and the Treasury – </p>
<p>or between military and civilian planners. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> Crucially, with the IPU focused on policy, there remained no department or unit with </p>
<p>responsibility for delivering the UK’s contribution to the reconstruction effort.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> After the invasion force had rapidly brought down Saddam Hussein’s regime, the </p>
<p>UK’s six&#8209;year engagement in Iraq fell into three broad phases, which the Inquiry has </p>
<p>used to provide a simplified framework for describing events:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Occupation – March 2003 to June 2004:</b> during which the UK was formally a </p>
<p>joint Occupying Power alongside the US, and Iraq was governed by the US&#8209;led </p>
<p>Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA);</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Transition – June 2004 to the end of 2005:</b> characterised by the increasing </p>
<p>power of Iraqi politicians and institutions, and ending with elections and the </p>
<p>formation of the Prime Minister Nuri al&#8209;Maliki’s government; and </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Preparations for withdrawal – 2006 to 2009:</b> during which period the UK </p>
<p>sought to transfer its remaining responsibilities in Multi&#8209;National Division </p>
<p>(South&#8209;East) (MND(SE)) to Iraqi forces so that it could withdraw its remaining </p>
<p>troops. </p>
<p><b>Occupation</b></p>
<p><b>10. </b> Shortly after the beginning of military operations in Iraq, officials advised that </p>
<p>the humanitarian assistance capabilities available in Iraq would be inadequate in </p>
<p>the event of a protracted conflict, significant damage to infrastructure or large&#8209;scale </p>
<p>movements of people. The use of chemical and biological weapons could also trigger </p>
<p>a humanitarian disaster. </p>

<p>Terms of Reference for the tract [sic] Planning Unit’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>531</p>
<p><b>11. </b> In the event, those scenarios did not materialise. The preparations for large&#8209;scale </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance made by the international community and, in the South, by the </p>
<p>UK military were not tested. </p>
<p><b>12. </b> By the middle of April 2003, DFID was beginning to look beyond humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance to recovery and reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>Leadership of the UK’s reconstruction effort</b></p>
<p><b>13. </b> When military operations against Iraq began, there was no single Ministerial lead </p>
<p>for reconstruction in Iraq. Mr Jack Straw (the Foreign Secretary), Mr Geoff Hoon (the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary) and Ms Clare Short (the International Development Secretary) </p>
<p>remained jointly responsible for directing post&#8209;conflict planning and preparation. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Ms Short told DFID officials on 26 March 2003 that Mr Blair had given her </p>
<p>responsibility for reconstruction in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The following day, Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary, and </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, agreed that “it was right that the FCO </p>
<p>should take the overall Whitehall lead on reconstruction”, including a Cabinet </p>
<p>Committee on reconstruction chaired by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> Sir Michael reported his concern </p>
<p>that DFID were “still hankering after the leadership of the Iraq reconstruction agenda”. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> In early April, Mr Blair agreed to the creation of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>Rehabilitation (AHMGIR), chaired by Mr Straw, “to formulate policy for the rehabilitation, </p>
<p>reform and development of Iraq”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> The first meeting took place on 10 April.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The Cabinet Office provided secretariat support for the AHMGIR but responsibility </p>
<p>for inter&#8209;departmental co&#8209;ordination remained with the IPU. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> The creation of the AHMGIR offered the possibility of a more strategic and </p>
<p>integrated UK approach to reconstruction, with a single Minister overseeing the </p>
<p>development and implementation of reconstruction strategy and planning. But it should </p>
<p>have been established earlier, to better support more coherent UK planning and </p>
<p>preparations for the post&#8209;conflict period. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Although the AHMGIR commissioned and agreed a number of strategies and </p>
<p>plans, it did not seek to manage them. It did not, for example, scrutinise and challenge </p>
<p>departments’ support for them, ensure that the structures and resources necessary to </p>
<p>deliver them were in place, or require substantive reports on progress and impact. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> In May 2003, following the resignation of Ms Short and the adoption of resolution </p>
<p>1483, DFID assumed leadership of the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq and would </p>
<p>subsequently define, within the framework established by the AHMGIR and successive </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>UK strategies for Iraq, the scope and nature of that effort. There was no formal direction </p>
<p>that DFID should take charge.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The IPU retained responsibility for all policy issues and for administering UK </p>
<p>secondments to the CPA. The FCO retained responsibility for Security Sector Reform </p>
<p>(see Section 12). </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Mr Blair maintained a close interest in the UK’s reconstruction effort and the </p>
<p>contribution that progress here could make to achieving broader UK objectives. He </p>
<p>pressed DFID on a number of occasions in 2003 and 2004 to accelerate the pace of </p>
<p>reconstruction and focus its efforts more directly in support of the political process and </p>
<p>security. DFID Ministers responded by highlighting work that was already under way and </p>
<p>the difficulties of making progress in the face of growing insecurity. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> By late 2004, Mr Blair’s attention was increasingly focused on the political process, </p>
<p>security and “Iraqiisation”. </p>
<p><b>Failure to commit to ORHA</b></p>
<p><b>24. </b> When military operations against Iraq began, the UK had not made a decision </p>
<p>on the level and nature of its support for the US&#8209;led Office of Reconstruction and </p>
<p>Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), the body responsible for immediate post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>administration and reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> The 10 April meeting of the AHMGIR, which Mr Straw chaired and Ms Short </p>
<p>attended, agreed that the UK should increase its support for ORHA. That decision </p>
<p>reflected an assessment by the IPU that, although ORHA remained “in many ways a </p>
<p>sub&#8209;optimal organisation”, it was also “the only game in town”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> Greater UK engagement </p>
<p>with ORHA would help ensure that it did not pursue activities which the UK judged </p>
<p>not to be legal. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> The FCO sought volunteers to deploy to ORHA on 22 April. The first arrived in Iraq </p>
<p>in early May. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Straw visited ORHA on 14 April. He later wrote in his memoir:</p>
<p>“I could not believe the shambles before my eyes. There were around forty people in </p>
<p>the room, who, somehow or other, were going to be the nucleus of the government </p>
<p>of this large, disputatious and traumatised nation.”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>28. </b> Ms Short received a report from a DFID official the following day:</p>
<p>“… ORHA is incredibly awful … There may be things we could do to support it, but </p>
<p>it would be a political judgement (and a big political risk).”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>533</p>
<p><b>29. </b> On 17 April, Mr Blair agreed that the UK should “increase significantly the level of … </p>
<p>political and practical support to ORHA, including the secondment of significant numbers </p>
<p>of staff in priority areas”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Notwithstanding the Government’s decision to increase support for ORHA, Ms Short </p>
<p>remained cautious about the extent of DFID’s engagement. Her assessment was that </p>
<p>ORHA was not the only game in town. In particular, “immediate assistance” was a job for </p>
<p>the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) rather than ORHA.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> While ORHA </p>
<p>was responsible for “paying wages”, other recovery issues would emerge from  </p>
<p>a formal needs assessment undertaken by the World Bank and the International </p>
<p>Monetary Fund (IMF). </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Ms Short concluded on 23 April that DFID needed “one or two people” within ORHA </p>
<p>to act as DFID’s “eyes and ears”. DFID “should not bow to external pressure to put </p>
<p>people into ORHA for the sake of it”.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Ms Short’s assessment reflected her reluctance to engage in post&#8209;conflict activity </p>
<p>other than for the immediate humanitarian response to conflict, until it was confirmed </p>
<p>that the UN would lead the reconstruction effort. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> ORHA was, as Ministers and officials had reported, an extremely weak organisation. </p>
<p>But it was the organisation responsible for immediate reconstruction, and the scale </p>
<p>and urgency of the reconstruction challenge was already apparent. DFID should have </p>
<p>supported the Government’s decision to increase support for ORHA. The decision to </p>
<p>adopt a unilateral position fed concerns within Whitehall and in Iraq over the lack of </p>
<p>DFID engagement. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> The AHMGIR agreed on 24 April that the UK should offer to play “a leading role” </p>
<p>in ORHA(South), provided that ORHA confirmed that the UK would not be required to </p>
<p>pay for reconstruction.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The AHMGIR also endorsed the UK military assumption that the </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict UK Area of Responsibility (AOR) would comprise four provinces in southern </p>
<p>Iraq coterminous with the boundaries of ORHA’s southern region. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> The AHMGIR did so at a time when there was considerable concern about ORHA’s </p>
<p>capabilities and without robust analysis either of the strategic implications for the UK or </p>
<p>of the military’s capacity to support the UK’s potential civilian obligations in the region.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Ambassador Paul Bremer arrived in Baghdad on 12 May to lead the CPA. The </p>
<p>creation of the CPA signalled a change in US policy: instead of a rapid withdrawal, </p>
<p>the US was now working on the assumption of a protracted occupation. ORHA was </p>
<p>absorbed into the CPA in June.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>534</p>
<p><b>Returning to “a war footing”</b></p>
<p><b>37. </b> In early summer 2003, there was a chance for the Government to revisit its </p>
<p>reconstruction effort to put it on a more sustainable basis. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> On 12 May, Baroness Amos succeeded Ms Short as International Development </p>
<p>Secretary. Baroness Amos’s arrival coincided with reports from Basra that ORHA’s </p>
<p>inability to deliver reconstruction might undermine the level of consent enjoyed by </p>
<p>UK forces in the South, and hence affect plans for their withdrawal. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Baroness Amos immediately signalled DFID’s willingness to do more on </p>
<p>reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> On 22 May, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1483. The resolution </p>
<p>formally designated the US and UK as joint Occupying Powers in Iraq. It confirmed that </p>
<p>the UN would not – as the Government had at an earlier stage assumed – have lead </p>
<p>responsibility for the administration and reconstruction of Iraq. Sir Suma Chakrabarti, </p>
<p>DFID Permanent Secretary from 2002 to 2007, told the Inquiry that Ms Short’s </p>
<p>resignation and the adoption of the resolution led to a significant shift in DFID’s  </p>
<p>attitude: “From that point on, we had to try and make ORHA work better whether </p>
<p>we liked it or not.”</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Resolution 1483 also created the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) to hold </p>
<p>95 percent of Iraq’s oil revenues and other Iraqi assets, and imposed joint US/UK </p>
<p>responsibility (as Occupying Powers) over disbursements from it. The CPA would use </p>
<p>those revenues to fund Iraq’s reconstruction; of the US$19.4bn spent by the US/CPA on </p>
<p>the relief and reconstruction of Iraq during the Occupation, US$14bn came from the DFI </p>
<p>and a further US$2.4bn from vested and seized Iraqi assets. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> Section 9.8 concludes that resolution 1483 set the conditions for the CPA’s </p>
<p>dominance over post&#8209;invasion strategy and policy by handing it control of funding for </p>
<p>reconstruction and influence on political development. </p>
<p><b>UK scrutiny of disbursements from the  </b></p>
<p><b>Development Fund for Iraq </b></p>
<p>Resolution 1483, which was adopted on 22 May 2003, provided that disbursements from </p>
<p>the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) would be “at the direction of the Authority [the US </p>
<p>and UK as Occupying Powers], in consultation with the interim Iraqi administration”. By </p>
<p>that time, the US was committed to a protracted Occupation and it was not clear when an </p>
<p>interim Iraqi administration would be established. </p>
<p>On 10 June 2003, the CPA issued a regulation that gave Ambassador Paul Bremer, </p>
<p>as “Administrator of the CPA”, authority to oversee and control the establishment, </p>
<p>administration and use of the DFI and to direct disbursements from the DFI.</p>
<p>10 </p>
<p>Public hearing, 8 December 2009, page 34. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>535</p>
<p>Audits undertaken by the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) </p>
<p>found that the CPA failed to enforce adequate management, financial and contractual </p>
<p>controls over approximately US$8.8bn of DFI money, and that there was “no assurance </p>
<p>that the funds were used for the purposes mandated by resolution 1483”.</p>
<p>11 </p>
<p>Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer disagreed with that assessment. </p>
<p>The CPA excluded the UK from decisions on disbursements from the DFI. Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq from September 2003 to </p>
<p>March 2004, told the Inquiry: “The UK was not allowed sight of any of the figures on the </p>
<p>use of money by the CPA … London made it quite clear that they didn’t expect me to be </p>
<p>responsible for this.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Section 9.8 addresses the UK’s inability to influence decisions made by the CPA, </p>
<p>commensurate with its responsibilities as an Occupying Power. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> On 3 June, following a visit to Iraq, Mr Blair told Ministers that the Government </p>
<p>should return to “a war footing” to avoid “losing the peace in Iraq”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Following the adoption of resolution 1483, with the AHMGIR now established, </p>
<p>and with Mr Blair and DFID engaged, there was a chance to set clear and realistic </p>
<p>priorities for the UK’s reconstruction effort, within the framework provided by a broader </p>
<p>UK strategy for Iraq, and to identify and secure the human and financial resources </p>
<p>necessary to manage and deliver that effort.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Despite Mr Blair’s recognition of the risk that the UK could lose the peace in Iraq, </p>
<p>the Government failed to take that chance. There are no indications that Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>direction led to any substantive changes in the UK’s reconstruction effort. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>49. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that any work was done to identify an alternative </p>
<p>source of funding. The UK’s assumption remained that the US/CPA should provide </p>
<p>funding for the South.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Section 9.8 concludes that, from early July, security was seen in Whitehall as the </p>
<p>key concern. A circular analysis began to develop, in which progress on reconstruction </p>
<p>required security to be improved, and improved security required the consent generated </p>
<p>by reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Cabinet agreed on 3 July that the UK should make CPA(South) “a model”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> What </p>
<p>that meant, and what resources might be required to realise it, was not specified or </p>
<p>recognised as an issue. It was ill&#8209;advised to set ambitious objectives without any plan or </p>
<p>commitment of resources for meeting them.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> By 9 July, Sir Michael Jay had agreed with FCO officials that a British official should </p>
<p>replace Ambassador Olsen as Head of CPA(South), if he decided to resign. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> Ministers agreed the following day that the UK should offer to replace Ambassador </p>
<p>Olsen with a British official. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> Although the significant strategic, resource and reputational implications of such a </p>
<p>decision had been identified in March and April 2003, there are no indications that those </p>
<p>assessments were reviewed, or that any arrangements were to put in place to support a </p>
<p>British Head of CPA(South) and, more broadly, the UK’s leadership of CPA(South).</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott arrived in Basra on 30 July to take up post as Head of </p>
<p>CPA(South). Sir Hilary wrote in his memoir that his arrival, along with the British military </p>
<p>command of MND(SE), established “some sort of British Fiefdom” in the South, but one </p>
<p>which he saw as “still entirely dependent on American resources for its lifeblood”.</p>

<p><b>56. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq from </p>
<p>September 2003 to March 2004, told the Inquiry that there was a “separation in the </p>

<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>537</p>
<p><b>57. </b> In his first report from Basra, sent on 7 August, Sir Hilary wrote that he currently had </p>
<p>no secure communication with Baghdad or London, there were no telephone landlines </p>
<p>and mobile coverage was patchy. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> On 10 and 11 August, there were serious riots in Basra. Cabinet Office officials </p>
<p>attributed the disturbances to increasing frustration with the Coalition’s failure to restore </p>
<p>basic services. Ministers agreed that Sir Hilary “should be given such assistance and </p>
<p>staff as he deemed necessary to improve the workings of CPA(South)”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>59. </b> At the end of August, Sir Hilary Synnott requested 37 specialist staff and </p>
<p>20 armoured vehicles for CPA(South). He requested a further 44 staff at the end of </p>
<p>October. In his valedictory report in January 2004, Sir Hilary stated that: </p>
<p>“A bid for 37 additional and expert staff … was endorsed by Ministers immediately … </p>
<p>by early January, 18 of the 37 new staff had still not arrived.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>60. </b> The FCO did not provide adequate practical support to Sir Hilary Synnott as Head of </p>
<p>CPA(South).</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Departments’ failure to respond to Ministers’ demands for additional civilian </p>
<p>personnel in Basra and elsewhere in Iraq is addressed in Section 15.2.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> The decision to take on the leadership of the CPA(South) had significant </p>
<p>implications, lasting well beyond the end of the Occupation. The South would occupy the </p>
<p>attention of Ministers and senior officials and absorb the majority of the UK resources </p>
<p>available for reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>63. </b> Sir Michael Jay was aware, in particular through his participation in Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>6 March and 17 April meetings, that the decision to provide the Head of CPA(South) </p>
<p>would have significant resource implications. He did not ensure that those were </p>
<p>addressed.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Sir Michael, as FCO Permanent Under Secretary, failed to ensure that the FCO </p>
<p>provided the support needed by Sir Hilary Synnott as Head of CPA(South). </p>
<p><b>65. </b> On 15 November, the Iraqi Governing Council unveiled a timetable for the transfer </p>
<p>of power to a transitional Iraqi administration by 30 June 2004, at which point the CPA </p>
<p>would be dissolved. The announcement took UK officials and contractors working in the </p>
<p>CPA by surprise. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> The decision to transfer power earlier than had been expected (the CPA’s plans </p>
<p>had extended for some years) had significant implications for the reconstruction effort. </p>
<p>The CPA focused on programmes which could deliver a visible and immediate impact in </p>
<p>support of reconciliation and the political transition process, and shelved programmes </p>

<p><b>68. </b> Resolution 1546, which was adopted on 8 June 2004, endorsed the formation of a </p>
<p>sovereign Interim Government of Iraq (IGI) which would assume full responsibility for </p>
<p>governing Iraq by 30 June 2004. The IGI would have “the primary role” in co&#8209;ordinating </p>
<p>international assistance, with the support of the UN.</p>

<p><b>69. </b> The resolution requested Member States, international financial institutions </p>
<p>and other organisations to strengthen their efforts to support reconstruction and </p>

<p><b>Transition</b></p>
<p><b>70. </b> At the end of June 2004, the CPA formally handed over power to the Interim Iraqi </p>
<p>Government (IIG) and the US and UK ceased to be Occupying Powers in Iraq. Mr Hilary </p>
<p>Benn, the International Development Secretary, welcomed the fact that “Iraqis were </p>
<p>clearly in charge” and that the UK was moving “from a phase of doing things for the </p>
<p>Iraqis to supporting them doing it for themselves”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Despite that, there were concerns </p>
<p>among DFID officials that the IIG was ill&#8209;prepared to administer Iraq and lead the </p>
<p>reconstruction effort. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Both the incoming Iraqi Government and the US established new structures to </p>
<p>manage and deliver reconstruction in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> The UK’s priorities were to maintain the momentum of the political process towards </p>
<p>elections in January 2005 and to ensure that the conditions for the drawdown of UK </p>
<p>forces (planned to begin in 2005) were achieved.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> An immediate UK concern was the growing insurgency in Sunni areas. During </p>
<p>the autumn, Mr Blair pressed DFID to increase the pace of reconstruction so that Iraqi </p>
<p>citizens could see a reconstruction dividend before the elections and to do more in cities </p>
<p>across Iraq where the IIG had regained control from insurgents. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> DFID’s response focused on the steps it had already taken to accelerate the pace </p>
<p>of reconstruction in the South, in the face of growing insecurity. It did not substantively </p>
<p>address Mr Blair’s request that it should do more in cities where the IIG had regained </p>
<p>control from insurgents. </p>

<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>539</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Blair’s assessment of the contribution that reconstruction could make to </p>
<p>addressing insecurity in Iraq and to achieving wider UK objectives was reasonable. </p>
<p>While there were certainly obstacles to increasing DFID’s focus on the areas identified </p>
<p>by Mr Blair, including insecurity and the dominant role of the US, DFID should  </p>
<p>have reviewed its effort in Iraq in the light of the worsening situation on the ground.  </p>
<p>It did not do so. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> From this point on, Mr Blair increasingly focused on pressing issues relating to the </p>
<p>political process, security and “Iraqiisation” (building the ability of Iraqi Security Forces to </p>
<p>take the lead on security within Iraq). </p>
<p><b>77. </b> By the end of 2004, the obstacles to delivering reconstruction in the South were </p>
<p>clear. </p>
<p><b>78. </b> Insecurity remained the most serious obstacle to progress. </p>
<p><b>79. </b> The UK had been pressing the US to move quickly to establish a reconstruction </p>
<p>presence in the South since the transition to the IIG in June 2004. In December, officials </p>
<p>confirmed that the US intended to focus on reconstruction projects that had a more </p>
<p>immediate and visible impact at the expense of larger, longer&#8209;term projects, and was </p>
<p>likely to reallocate funding from more to less stable areas of Iraq. That meant less US </p>
<p>funding for the South. Mr Chakrabarti reported that:</p>
<p>“As junior partners in the coalition, our ideas are listened to, but our influence over </p>
<p>US spending will remain limited. We need to face up to the fact: the South will not be </p>
<p>a strategic priority for the US.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>80. </b> At the same time, concerns grew over the capacity of the Iraqi Government to lead </p>
<p>and manage the reconstruction effort. Faster progress on reconstruction was unlikely </p>
<p>without greater Iraqi capacity, and building that capacity could take years. A particular </p>
<p>concern for the UK was the weakness of the relationship between Baghdad and Basra. </p>
<p>That relationship would become increasingly difficult. </p>
<p><b>81. </b> The UN and World Bank continued to limit their presence on the ground in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>82. </b> Reports from Iraq highlighted that progress in delivering essential services, and in </p>
<p>particular power, had fallen far below Iraqi expectations. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> DFID concluded in December 2004 that it would “have to take more of the strain </p>
<p>bilaterally in 2005”.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> Planned support for infrastructure in the South would be brought </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>UK funding for reconstruction </b></p>
<p>DFID provided £297m for reconstruction and a further £209m for humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>in Iraq between 2002/03 and 2009/10. Iraq was DFID’s largest bilateral programme in </p>
<p>2003/04, when DFID spent a total of £220m. That included a £110m contribution to the </p>
<p>humanitarian relief effort following the invasion and a £70m contribution to the World Bank </p>
<p>and UN Trust Funds (which would be spent by the World Bank and UN in subsequent </p>
<p>years). The size of DFID’s programme decreased over the following years.</p>
<p>In addition, UK forces in MND(SE) spent £38m from UK funds on Quick Impact Projects </p>
<p>(QIPs).</p>
<p>It is not possible, from the information available to the Inquiry, to produce a definitive </p>
<p>breakdown of the allocation of DFID funding between national programmes and </p>
<p>programmes in the South. The Inquiry calculates that, from 2003/04 to 2007/08, between </p>
<p>76 percent and 52 percent of DFID funding was allocated to programmes in the South.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DFID’s expenditure in the South peaked in 2005/06. </p>
<p>UK forces also had access to significant amounts of US funding from the Commander’s </p>
<p>Emergency Response Program (CERPs) to spend on urgent relief and reconstruction </p>
<p>needs. The Government has not been able to provide a full breakdown of the amount of </p>
<p>CERPs funding used by UK military commanders, but it appears to have been greater </p>
<p>than the total amount provided by the UK for reconstruction. The US allocated US$66m </p>
<p>from CERPs to MND(SE) in the US fiscal year 2005/06. In the same year, in MND(SE), </p>
<p>DFID spent some £35m on infrastructure and job creation and the MOD spent £3m from </p>
<p>UK funds on QIPs. </p>
<p>By April 2009, the US had spent or allocated to ongoing projects US$351m from CERPs in </p>
<p>MND(SE), and spent or allocated to ongoing projects some US$3.3bn from all sources in </p>
<p>MND(SE). Over the same period, in MND(SE), DFID spent at least £100m and the MOD </p>
<p>spent £38m from UK funds on QIPs. </p>
<p>UK funding was also available for Iraq from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (and </p>
<p>subsequently the Stabilisation Aid Fund and the Conflict Pool). Most of that funding was </p>
<p>allocated to Security Sector Reform (see Section 12).</p>
<p><b>Preparation for withdrawal</b></p>
<p><b>84. </b> From June 2005, the Government considered a series of papers on the transfer </p>
<p>of security responsibilities for southern provinces to Iraqi Security Forces (leading to </p>
<p>withdrawal of UK forces from Iraq). </p>
<p><b>85. </b> DFID assessed that it could not operate effectively in the South without UK military </p>
<p>support and, in October, indicated its intention to refocus on building the capacity of </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government in Baghdad. Existing projects in the South would continue to </p>
<p>completion but, given the security situation, no new projects would be started. </p>
<p>25 </p>
<p>Calculation excludes DFID funding for humanitarian assistance, the World Bank and UN Trust Funds, </p>
<p>and programme support costs such as security, accommodation and communications. It is not possible </p>
<p>to produce a reliable estimate of the proportion of the funding provided for those purposes that related </p>
<p>to the South. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>541</p>
<p><b>86. </b> There was some resistance to that new approach from other departments: it was not </p>
<p>until October 2006 that a DFID official could advise Mr Benn that “we have largely won </p>
<p>the argument that DFID should shift focus … to technical assistance in Baghdad”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>87. </b> In October 2005, the US launched its new “Clear&#8209;Hold&#8209;Build” strategy for Iraq. One </p>
<p>component of the strategy was the deployment of integrated civilian&#8209;military Provincial </p>
<p>Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) into each Iraqi province. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> The US initiative created a dilemma for the UK: how to meet US expectations that </p>
<p>the UK would play a leading role in establishing PRTs in the South and that each PRT </p>
<p>should be a “new venture” supported by additional resources, while not disrupting the </p>
<p>UK’s plans to withdraw.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> The Government’s solution was to “be constructive; find out </p>
<p>more and try and influence the US approach; and … repackage our effort in the South </p>
<p>as a PRT but not do very much differently”.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> UK plans for withdrawal would not change. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> The UK&#8209;led PRT in Basra was established in May 2006, by bringing together </p>
<p>existing US, UK and Danish programme teams. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> An FCO paper described the situation in Basra at that time:</p>
<p>“Security and governance in Basra are bad and worsening … Attacks on us, and </p>
<p>both criminal and sectarian violence, are rising. Basic services are not being </p>
<p>delivered … </p>
<p>“The UK civilian effort in Basra is increasingly hunkered down. We face a lack of </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation from the local authorities and severe restrictions on our movement. </p>
<p>Our local staff … suffer growing intimidation. Against this background, much of our </p>
<p>effort – notably the Provincial Reconstruction Team we are standing up … can  </p>
<p>make little headway.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The UK’s response to the US strategy, including the introduction of PRTs, was </p>
<p>entirely shaped by its plans to withdraw (militarily and in relation to reconstruction). The </p>
<p>decision simply to repackage the UK effort meant that the possibility of establishing a </p>
<p>coherent international effort in the South, adapted to the difficult security environment, </p>
<p>was left unexplored. The PRT was a less effective organisation than it might have been. </p>
<p>The weaknesses in the PRT would be exposed in 2008, as security improved and </p>
<p>international partners looked to it to do more. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>542</p>
<p><b>The Better Basra Plans</b></p>
<p>Between June 2006 and March 2007, officials in Basra produced three “Better Basra </p>
<p>Plans”, which aimed to get Basra on track for the transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC). </p>
<p>The first, produced under the direction of Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, focused </p>
<p>on Security Sector Reform. The third was a comprehensive plan, produced by the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office Basra, MND(SE) and the PRT, setting out nine lines of operation including </p>
<p>reconstruction under an “over&#8209;arching political strategy”. </p>
<p>The Stabilisation Unit subsequently reported that the “Better Basra Plans” had gone some </p>
<p>way to make up for the absence of a UK strategy for Iraq, but had been undermined by a </p>
<p>lack of strategic guidance from Whitehall and frequent changeover of personnel in theatre, </p>
<p>and so “eventually fell by the wayside during the course of 2007”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>92. </b> The security situation in Basra continued to deteriorate. In October 2006, the </p>
<p>majority of civilian staff were withdrawn from the Basra Palace Compound to Basra </p>
<p>Air Station (BAS), where MND(SE) was already based. The lack of hardened </p>
<p>accommodation at BAS meant that the PRT withdrew first to Kuwait and redeployed </p>
<p>to BAS in February 2007.</p>
<p><b>A new focus on economic development in Basra</b></p>
<p><b>93. </b> Mr Gordon Brown took office as Prime Minister at the end of June 2007. In relation </p>
<p>to Iraq, he focused his attention on initiatives to support economic growth and private </p>
<p>sector investment in Basra. DFID increased staffing in both Basra and Baghdad to </p>
<p>support those economic initiatives. </p>
<p><b>94. </b> The UK&#8209;led PRT in Basra continued to be the primary means of delivering the UK’s </p>
<p>reconstruction effort in the South. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> In March 2008, Prime Minister Maliki launched a major offensive against militia </p>
<p>groups in Basra, known as the “Charge of the Knights”. The operation led to an </p>
<p>immediate improvement in the security situation in Basra. The US and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government moved quickly to exploit it by pouring in resources for reconstruction and </p>
<p>in particular for projects which would have an immediate, visible impact. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> A junior DFID official reported from Basra that it seemed the US could “do things” </p>
<p>that the UK had not tried.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> It was able to dedicate more people and more money to the </p>
<p>task; change the security environment to secure better civilian access; operate outside </p>
<p>Iraqi structures; ensure better linkages to US work in Baghdad; and “apply sufficient </p>
<p>clout at the Baghdad end” to secure the Iraqi Government’s attention. </p>

<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>543</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Within the UK Government, initial reactions to those developments were mixed. </p>
<p>Some saw them as an opportunity, others as undermining the UK’s work to build </p>
<p>the capacity of the provincial government (which risked being sidelined by decisions </p>
<p>to channel funds directly to line ministries, tribal leaders and non&#8209;governmental </p>
<p>organisations), as a distraction for the UK team, and as a risk to the UK’s reputation. </p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr David Miliband, the Foreign Secretary, wrote to Mr Brown in April, describing  </p>
<p>the Charge of the Knights as “an opportunity” which had paved the way for a  </p>
<p>“proper and respectable end” to the UK’s role as “lead partner in the coalition” in </p>
<p>the course of 2009.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>Civilian&#8209;military co&#8209;ordination on the ground</b></p>
<p><b>99. </b> The withdrawal of civilian staff from Basra Palace in October 2006 came as </p>
<p>frustrations within some elements of the military over the lack of an integrated </p>
<p>civilian&#8209;military effort reached a critical point. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> In March and April 2003, the Government had adopted new structures, centred </p>
<p>on the AHMGIR, to co&#8209;ordinate its work on Iraq in the post&#8209;conflict period. There </p>
<p>are no indications that the Government considered how civilian teams from different </p>
<p>departments and the military would co&#8209;ordinate their efforts on the ground. It was left to </p>
<p>those teams to determine how they should work together. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> In December 2006, Major General Richard Shirreff, General Officer Commanding </p>
<p>(GOC) MND(SE), wrote to Mr Blair proposing that the UK should establish a Joint </p>
<p>Inter&#8209;Agency Task Force combining military and civilian reconstruction expertise </p>
<p>under military command. Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that, by that time, the </p>
<p>“inter&#8209;governmental piece” had failed, and characterised his proposal as “desperate </p>
<p>times and desperate measures”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>102. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal was the subject of heated debate within the </p>
<p>Government. Mr Blair expressed support for it, but it was rejected by the MOD, other </p>
<p>senior military officers, the FCO and DFID. Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy </p>
<p>Adviser, advised Mr Blair that there had been constant problems between military and </p>
<p>civilian teams in Basra “from the start” and concluded: “We must make a last effort to get </p>
<p>a joined up operation.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>103. </b> The Government concluded that it was not appropriate to establish a military lead </p>
<p>for reconstruction. The co&#8209;location of MND(SE), the PRT and other civilian teams at BAS </p>
<p>was expected to help co&#8209;ordination. In March 2007, the UK civilian and military teams in </p>

<p>Basra proposed a new structure, with a civilian lead, to co&#8209;ordinate the UK’s effort in  </p>
<p>the South. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Reports from Basra after March 2007 indicate that civilian&#8209;military co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>improved. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Co&#8209;ordination on the ground was complicated by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of an integrated UK strategy (within which civilian and military teams on </p>
<p>the ground could locate their efforts); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the physical separation of the UK’s civilian and military teams until February </p>
<p>2007 – the effect of that separation was exacerbated by the constraints on travel </p>
<p>in Basra and the lack of a common communications system. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> The Government should have acted much sooner to support civilian&#8209;military </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination on the ground in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>Reconstruction, strategy and planning</b></p>
<p><b>107. </b> Section 9.8 concludes that the Government’s frequent new strategies for Iraq did </p>
<p>not result in substantial changes in direction, due to their focus on describing a desired </p>
<p>end state (rather than on how it would be reached), the absence of a Cabinet Minister </p>
<p>with overall responsibility for Iraq, and the difficulty in translating Government strategy </p>
<p>into action by departments. Although Iraq was designated the UK’s highest foreign policy </p>
<p>priority, it was not the top priority within individual departments.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> Throughout the period, reconstruction was presented as the third pillar of UK </p>
<p>strategy, after the political process and security. None of the UK’s strategies defined </p>
<p>how reconstruction related to the political process and security, how progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction could contribute to achieving broader UK objectives and, in that context, </p>
<p>whether the focus and scale of the UK’s reconstruction effort was appropriate. </p>
<p><b>The role of reconstruction </b></p>
<p>Only once during the period covered by the Inquiry were Ministers invited to consider </p>
<p>fundamental questions on the size, focus and impact of the UK’s reconstruction effort and </p>
<p>the contribution that reconstruction could make to achieving broader UK objectives.</p>
<p>The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy on Iraq (DOP(I)), chaired by </p>
<p>Mr Blair, met for the first time on 26 May 2005.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting, </p>
<p>prepared by the Cabinet Office, invited Ministers to consider a number of questions, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the funding available for reconstruction across Government adequate?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the UK investing at a level that supported its objective of creating stability such </p>
<p>that there could be troop withdrawals?</p>
<p>35 </p>
<p>Annotated Agenda, 24 May 2005, DOP(I) meeting.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>545</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the UK delivering a short&#8209;term return which would boost the political process?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those were important questions. It should not have taken until May 2005 for officials to </p>
<p>pose them, or for Ministers to require advice on them.</p>
<p>DOP(I) did not address those questions. </p>
<p>Work by officials to establish the funding available for reconstruction across Government </p>
<p>was fed into discussions on the UK’s deployment to Helmand province, Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> DFID’s intent in March 2003 was to deliver a development programme in Iraq </p>
<p>which fitted their standard model for Middle&#8209;Income Countries. The programme would </p>
<p>focus on providing technical assistance for the economic and institutional reforms which </p>
<p>would underpin the reconstruction process and, given Iraq’s potential wealth, would be </p>
<p>relatively short term. The majority of assistance would be delivered through multilateral </p>
<p>channels. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> That approach was not tailored to the known scale and nature of the post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction task in Iraq. The information available to the Government before the </p>
<p>invasion clearly set out the deteriorated state of Iraq’s infrastructure. Ms Short told the </p>
<p>House of Commons at the end of January 2003 that Iraq’s infrastructure was “in chronic </p>
<p>disrepair. Hospitals, clinics, sanitation facilities and water treatment plants suffer  </p>
<p>from a terrible lack of maintenance. The result is that the Iraqi people’s lives are </p>
<p>perilously fragile.”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>111. </b> By May 2003, DFID had begun to change its approach. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> There were two major shifts in DFID’s focus in Iraq over the period covered by the </p>
<p>Inquiry, in response to broader UK objectives and the situation on the ground. The speed </p>
<p>and scale of DFID’s response were informed by its own departmental priorities. </p>
<p><b>113. </b> Those shifts were the product of series of individual judgments and decisions </p>
<p>by DFID Ministers and officials, rather than of a structured strategy&#8209;making process. </p>
<p>That incremental approach was facilitated by the weaknesses in the Government’s </p>
<p>strategy&#8209;making process (described in Section 9.8). </p>
<p><b>114. </b> First, from June 2003, DFID moved to support programmes in the South that </p>
<p>would have an immediate and visible impact. That shift was driven by the Government’s </p>
<p>concern over the declining level of consent for the UK military presence in the South </p>
<p>due, in the Government’s view, to CPA(South)’s inability to deliver reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>115. </b> DFID produced an Interim Country Assistance Plan for Iraq in February 2004, </p>
<p>setting out how it planned to contribute to Iraq’s reconstruction and development. The </p>
<p>Plan stated that, given the rapidly changing situation in Iraq, it would need a substantial </p>
<p>review after one year. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>546</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Despite that statement, and the significant changes on the ground (including the </p>
<p>deterioration in the security situation and the transition from Occupation to a sovereign </p>
<p>Iraqi Government), DFID did not undertake any further, structured strategic reviews of its </p>
<p>engagement in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> The focus on the South continued during 2004 and 2005, driven by the </p>
<p>Government’s assessment that the South was not a priority for the US, the lack of </p>
<p>funding from the central Iraqi Government, and the continuing absence of other donors, </p>
<p>the World Bank and UN. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> Second, from October 2005, when DFID indicated that it would refocus on building </p>
<p>the capacity of the Iraqi Government in Baghdad. Existing projects in the South  </p>
<p>would continue to completion but, given the security situation, no new projects would  </p>
<p>be started. </p>
<p><b>119. </b> The Inquiry considers that DFID missed several opportunities to address </p>
<p>hard, strategic questions over the scale and focus of its programme in Iraq and the </p>
<p>contribution that it could make to achieving broader UK objectives. Addressing those </p>
<p>questions did not necessarily require a formal review of the Country Assistance Plan, </p>
<p>but did require a structured process which: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>included a comprehensive assessment of the political, economic and social </p>
<p>context in Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>considered the lessons that DFID had identified and how it would respond </p>
<p>to them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>challenged DFID’s approach in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>engaged and reflected the policies and priorities of the Iraqi Government,  </p>
<p>the US and other international partners; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>engaged other departments, in particular to consider how the reconstruction </p>
<p>effort could contribute to broader UK objectives. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Particular opportunities were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in July 2003, when the UK took on civilian leadership of CPA(South) and in </p>
<p>doing so created a “British fiefdom” in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in autumn 2003, as the Government sought to respond to deteriorating security </p>
<p>in the South by providing support for essential services. DFID should have taken </p>
<p>steps to resolve the emerging tension between Ministers’ desire to accelerate </p>
<p>reconstruction in the South, and the lack of resources to do so; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in October 2004, as the insurgency took hold across Iraq and Mr Blair sought to </p>
<p>increase the impact of DFID’s reconstruction effort, in particular in cities regained </p>
<p>from insurgent control;</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>547</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in May 2005, when DFID chose not to undertake the substantive review of its </p>
<p>Country Assistance Plan for Iraq to which it was committed; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in October 2005, when the US adopted a Clear&#8209;Hold&#8209;Build strategy, including </p>
<p>increased support for Iraqi institutions and the deployment of PRTs; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in 2007, in response to the US surge and Mr Brown’s focus on economic </p>
<p>development initiatives in Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in 2008, in response to the improved security situation in Basra following the </p>
<p>Charge of the Knights. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> Under the leadership of Mr Benn and Mr Chakrabarti, DFID missed several clear </p>
<p>opportunities to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>review its approach and strategy in Iraq to ensure it was making the greatest </p>
<p>possible contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and to the UK’s broader </p>
<p>objectives; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work within Whitehall to encourage the Government to review the UK’s broader </p>
<p>approach and strategy. </p>
<p><b>Energy security, oil and oil revenues</b></p>
<p><b>122. </b> Energy security was one of the UK’s “fundamental interests” in relation to Iraq </p>
<p>throughout the period covered by the Inquiry.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> The region accounted for 33 percent of </p>
<p>the world’s oil supply. </p>
<p><b>123. </b> As Section 3 makes clear, the UK’s decision to take military action in Iraq was not </p>
<p>driven by economic considerations or potential commercial benefits. </p>
<p><b>124. </b> The UK’s concerns in relation to Iraq’s oil in the run&#8209;up to the invasion were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possible impact of military action on oil prices; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to maximise the contribution that Iraqi oil revenues could make to financing </p>
<p>Iraq’s reconstruction (reducing the risk that the UK would need to make a </p>
<p>substantial contribution).</p>
<p><b>125. </b> The US Department of Defense led planning to restore the oil sector before the </p>
<p>invasion. The UK did not participate in that planning, and only become aware of it shortly </p>
<p>before the invasion began. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>548</p>
<p><b>126. </b> The US and UK disagreed on who should control Iraqi oil revenues during the </p>
<p>Occupation. The UK’s position, as set out in a briefing for Mr Blair in March 2003, was </p>
<p>that: </p>
<p>“The UN or the Iraqis, not the Coalition, should manage oil revenues.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Resolution 1483, which was adopted on 22 May 2003, reflected the US position </p>
<p>that the Occupying Powers (the US and UK) should manage oil revenues. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> During the Occupation, the CPA excluded the UK (and British nationals working </p>
<p>in the CPA) from discussions on oil policy and rejected offers of a UK oil policy expert. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that, in his view, “the Americans had no intention </p>
<p>to take over and own the oil sector … I think they just felt it was such an important area </p>
<p>that they would run it themselves”.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>129. </b> In October 2003, against that background, the UK adopted a new approach of </p>
<p>engaging directly with Iraqi ministers and officials. </p>
<p><b>130. </b> The main objectives of UK policy during and after the transition to a sovereign Iraqi </p>
<p>Government were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the introduction of measures to improve governance and transparency in the oil </p>
<p>sector and in the collection and disbursement of oil revenues, including through </p>
<p>the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of a public sector national oil company;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the promotion of foreign direct investment (FDI), which the UK believed to be </p>
<p>the only realistic source of the funding needed to develop Iraq’s oil fields and </p>
<p>facilities and raise production. Such investment could also produce substantial </p>
<p>business for UK companies. The UK adopted an increasingly cautious position </p>
<p>on the potential role of the private sector in Iraq’s oil sector, including FDI, over </p>
<p>the period covered by the Inquiry; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>with respect to the proposed Hydrocarbons Law, for the federal Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to have responsibility for signing new oil exploration and production </p>
<p>contracts and for regulating the sector. The UK’s underlying concern was to </p>
<p>preserve the integrity of the Iraqi State. </p>
<p><b>131. </b> There is no evidence that the UK significantly influenced Iraqi policy in relation to </p>
<p>oil. A junior FCO official reported in September 2006 that the Iraqi Government cared </p>
<p>more about what international oil companies thought. </p>

<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>549</p>
<p><b>Support for UK business</b></p>
<p><b>132. </b> The Government initially adopted a low&#8209;key approach to lobbying for UK business, </p>
<p>to avoid giving “undue prominence” to commercial interests.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> From March 2003, in </p>
<p>response to pressure from UK companies, it gradually stepped up its efforts. </p>
<p><b>133. </b> The US (including USAID, the US Army Corps of Engineers and the CPA) was </p>
<p>the major source of reconstruction contracts during the Occupation. The Government’s </p>
<p>objective was to ensure a “level playing field” for UK companies.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> The US made  </p>
<p>clear to the UK that, while it welcomed the participation of UK companies, there was </p>
<p>no “special deal”. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> A senior UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) official, writing in December 2003, </p>
<p>reported that: </p>
<p>“It took time, initially, to persuade Ministers that this [promoting UK business] was a </p>
<p>legitimate objective that the Government should be seen to be promoting actively … </p>
<p>“But the departments responsible for overseeing this co&#8209;ordination [on post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>Iraq] made clear at an early stage that UK commercial interests were a lower priority </p>
<p>than other aspects of reconstruction. The result … was that the contribution that the </p>
<p>private sector could make to post&#8209;conflict reconstruction was less well registered.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>The Government’s approach to post&#8209;conflict reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>135. </b> The Government began a review of the UK’s approach to post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction in September 2003. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> The inter&#8209;departmental Post&#8209;Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU) was established </p>
<p>in September 2004. It became operational during 2005 and in December 2007 was </p>
<p>renamed the Stabilisation Unit (SU). </p>
<p><b>137. </b> The PCRU and SU focused their activity on Afghanistan. They made limited, but </p>
<p>valuable, contributions in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Since 2007, the SU has continued to evolve in response to a changing strategic </p>
<p>and policy framework shaped by:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>550</p>
<p><b>139. </b> The review of post&#8209;conflict planning and preparation that began in 2003 was </p>
<p>triggered by the Iraq experience, but was not designed to provide immediate solutions to </p>
<p>the problems encountered in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> On the evidence seen by the Inquiry, the Government quickly identified lessons </p>
<p>learned from the shortcomings in its planning and preparation for post&#8209;conflict Iraq and </p>
<p>the initial experience of post&#8209;conflict reconstruction. It failed, however, to apply those </p>
<p>lessons in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>141. </b> There is no indication that Ministers or officials considered how the PCRU might </p>
<p>support operations in Iraq until autumn 2005.</p>
<p><b>142. </b> PCRU support was essential to the establishment and operation of the Basra PRT </p>
<p>during 2006. The PCRU did not, however, have a mandate to overcome the difficulties </p>
<p>caused by variations in the contracts and terms and conditions of PRT staff, most of </p>
<p>whom were transferred from existing roles in Iraq (see Section 10.3). </p>
<p><b>143. </b> After 2006, there were further changes to the UK’s strategic approach to </p>
<p>reconstruction and stabilisation and improvements to its deployable capability. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> It is not possible to determine how the structures and capabilities introduced by </p>
<p>successive governments would have performed in the circumstances that existed either </p>
<p>in Whitehall during the planning and preparation for a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq in 2002 </p>
<p>and early 2003, or in Whitehall and Iraq between 2003 and 2009. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> The size and scope of the Stabilisation Unit and the resources at its disposal in </p>

<p>to stabilisation since 2009, described in greater detail in Section 10.3. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>551</p>
<p><b>Reviews of the UK approach to stabilisation</b></p>
<p>In August 2010, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) published a review of the </p>
<p>Government’s progress in promoting stability in countries emerging from conflict. </p>
<p>The review concluded that, between 2005 and 2010, a drive towards greater </p>
<p>inter&#8209;departmental co&#8209;operation had led to a number of institutional innovations, an </p>
<p>increase in the resources available for stabilisation, new cadres of practitioners and </p>
<p>improved co&#8209;ordination in&#8209;country, but that the UK was “not yet delivering on its full </p>
<p>potential to engage in fragile states”.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> Issues highlighted in the review included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “mismatch” between ambitions and resources;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>loyalty to departments rather than to government as a whole; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lessons recorded and stored by a number of departments, but seldom considered </p>
<p>when new decisions needed to be made. </p>
<p>The Stabilisation Unit produced a paper on lessons learned from the UK’s growing </p>
<p>experience of stabilisation activities in November 2010. Lessons included the need to </p>
<p>ensure that economic and development objectives complement and support efforts </p>
<p>to promote a peaceful political process, and the importance of securing community </p>
<p>engagement.</p>
<p>The Inquiry agrees, in the context of Iraq, with many of the lessons identified in the RUSI </p>
<p>review and the November 2010 Stabilisation Unit paper. </p>
<p><b>The impact of the UK’s reconstruction effort</b></p>
<p><b>148. </b> From the available information, it is not possible fully to assess the impact of the </p>
<p>UK’s reconstruction effort.</p>
<p><b>149. </b> One difficulty is that the Government never defined what contribution </p>
<p>reconstruction should make to achieving broader UK objectives and so what would </p>
<p>constitute success or failure. </p>
<p><b>150. </b> The environment in Iraq made reconstruction very difficult. For almost all of the </p>
<p>period covered by the Inquiry, insecurity was the major constraint. Other constraints were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of capacity within the Iraqi Government, both in Baghdad and the South, </p>
<p>to support and lead reconstruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the form and implementation of de&#8209;Ba’athification;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the politicisation of Iraqi institutions, and corruption;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the series of relatively short&#8209;lived Iraqi administrations between 2004 and 2006 </p>
<p>(with limited remits to initiate reform and an inevitable churn of Ministers and </p>
<p>senior officials); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an international community which, because of the circumstances of the invasion, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the persistent lack of co&#8209;ordination between the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>international partners, and between international partners. </p>
<p><b>151. </b> Staff and contractors developed a number of approaches to managing the risks </p>
<p>inherent in working in such an environment:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using innovative techniques to deliver projects, such as working through local </p>
<p>Iraqi contractors, using the military (who were more frequently able to visit </p>
<p>project sites) to manage and monitor projects, and helping the Ministry of </p>
<p>Finance to set up an office inside the International Zone in Baghdad within which </p>
<p>international consultants could work;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>systematically tracking poor performance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adapting delivery methods to reduce fiduciary risk; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building clear exit strategies into projects, including dedicating significant effort </p>
<p>to bringing in other donors. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> The Inquiry recognises the dedication and skill of the staff and contractors who </p>
<p>worked in Iraq, often in discomfort and at personal risk. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Witnesses to the Inquiry and contemporary documents identify three areas in </p>
<p>particular where the UK had made a significant contribution to Iraq’s reconstruction:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building Iraqi capacity at the centre of government (including the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s Office and the Cabinet Office), and strengthening the linkages </p>
<p>between Baghdad and the provinces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of the provincial administration in Basra; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of successive Iraqi Governments to manage the economy </p>
<p>(including the launch of a new Iraqi currency in 2003) and engage effectively </p>
<p>with the International Monetary Fund. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> The Inquiry met a number of senior Iraqi politicians and officials, and asked </p>
<p>them for their views on the UK’s reconstruction effort. DFID’s focus on building Iraqi </p>
<p>Government capacity to plan and manage was recognised and welcomed. That was </p>
<p>contrasted with short&#8209;term activities, including building schools and hospitals, which Iraq </p>
<p>could do for itself. </p>
<p><b>155. </b> In Basra, the Inquiry was told that there was little to show for the UK’s </p>
<p>reconstruction effort. A small number of projects were identified as continuing to have a </p>
<p>positive impact, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training in the UK delivered by the PRT;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>job creation programmes supported by DFID; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improvements to the sewerage system supported by the UK military. </p>

<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>553</p>
<p><b>Key economic and social indicators</b></p>
<p><b>156. </b> It is possible to consider the impact of the international community’s reconstruction </p>
<p>efforts in Iraq by looking at the changes in a number of key indicators. Table 1 presents </p>
<p>selected economic and social indicators. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> In relation to the economy:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Electricity production fell from around 4,000 megawatts (MW) per day before </p>
<p>the invasion to 500MW in May 2003 (immediately after the invasion), before </p>
<p>recovering to around 4,000MW in June 2004 (the transition from Occupation to </p>
<p>a sovereign Iraqi Government).</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> By 2009, production was around 6,000MW. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Oil production fell from around 2.9m barrels a day (bpd) before the invasion to </p>
<p>around 0.3m bpd in May 2003, before recovering to 2.3m bpd by June 2004. </p>
<p>By 2009, production remained below pre&#8209;conflict levels. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> The under&#8209;five mortality rate fell from 42 to 38 (per 1,000 live births) between 2003 </p>
<p>and 2009. </p>
<p><b>159. </b> Perceptions of corruption in Iraq worsened between 2003 and 2009. Iraq fell </p>
<p>from 113th out of 133 countries surveyed for Transparency International’s Corruption </p>
<p>Perceptions Index in 2003, to 176th out of 180 countries surveyed in 2009. </p>
<p><b>160. </b> The UN’s 2009 Common Country Assessment concluded that, while Iraq had </p>
<p>fulfilled its constitutional mandate requiring 25 percent of Parliamentary seats to be filled </p>
<p>by women, women remained under&#8209;represented at higher levels within the public sector </p>
<p>and government.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> Women also had higher illiteracy levels than men, participated in </p>
<p>smaller numbers in the labour force, were paid less and were segregated into certain </p>
<p>occupations. A disproportionate number of households in poverty were headed by </p>
<p>women. </p>

<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>161. </b> The starting point for all discussions of reconstruction in circumstances comparable </p>
<p>to those in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 must be that this is an area where progress will </p>
<p>be extremely difficult.</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Section 6.5 concludes that better planning and preparation for a post&#8209;Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein Iraq would not necessarily have prevented the events that unfolded in Iraq </p>
<p>between 2003 and 2009. It would not have been possible for the UK to prepare for every </p>
<p>eventuality. Better plans and preparation could have mitigated some of the risks to which </p>

<p>10.4  |  Conclusions: Reconstruction</p>
<p>555</p>
<p>the UK and Iraq were exposed between 2003 and 2009 and increased the likelihood of </p>
<p>achieving the outcomes desired by the UK and the Iraqi people.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> From late 2003, successive reviews of the UK’s approach to post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction, later expanded to include the broader concept of stabilisation, resulted </p>
<p>in a series of changes to the UK’s approach to post&#8209;conflict operations. Despite those </p>
<p>changes, many of the shortcomings that characterised the UK Government’s approach </p>
<p>to pre&#8209;conflict planning and preparation in 2002 and early 2003 persisted after  </p>
<p>the invasion. </p>
<p><b>164. </b> The UK Government’s new strategic framework for stabilisation, the new </p>
<p>machinery for inter&#8209;departmental co&#8209;ordination and the enhanced resources now </p>
<p>available for stabilisation operations continue to evolve. If future changes are to increase </p>
<p>the effectiveness of UK operations, they must address the lessons for planning, </p>
<p>preparation and implementation derived from the Iraq experience. </p>
<p><b>165. </b> The lessons identified by the Inquiry apply to both the planning and preparation for </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict operations, of which reconstruction is a major but not the sole component, </p>
<p>and to post&#8209;conflict operations themselves. </p>
<p><b>166. </b> Analysis of the available material must draw on multiple perspectives, reflect </p>
<p>dissenting views, identify risk – including that associated with any gaps in knowledge – </p>
<p>and consider a range of options. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> Information must be shared as widely across departments as is necessary to </p>
<p>support that approach. </p>
<p><b>168. </b> Information&#8209;gathering and analysis of the nature and scale of the potential task </p>
<p>should be systematic and as thorough as possible, and should capture the views and </p>
<p>aspirations of local communities. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> Plans derived from that analysis should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>incorporate a range of options appropriate to different contingencies; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reflect a realistic assessment of UK (and partners’) resources and capabilities; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>integrate civilian and military objectives and capabilities in support of a single UK </p>
<p>strategy; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be exposed to scrutiny and challenge at Ministerial, senior official and expert </p>
<p>level;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be reviewed regularly and, if the strategic context, risk profile or projected cost </p>
<p>changes significantly, be revised.</p>
<p><b>170. </b> A government must prepare for a range of scenarios, not just the best case, and </p>
<p>should not assume that it will be able to improvise. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>556</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Where the UK is the junior partner and is unable during planning or implementation </p>
<p>to secure the outcome it requires, it should take stock of whether to attach conditions </p>
<p>to continued participation and whether further involvement would be consistent with the </p>
<p>UK’s strategic interest.</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Public statements on the extent of the UK’s ambition should reflect a realistic </p>
<p>assessment of what is achievable. To do otherwise is to risk even greater disillusionment </p>
<p>and a loss of UK credibility.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Departmental priorities and interests will inevitably continue to diverge even where </p>
<p>an inter&#8209;departmental body with a cross&#8209;government role, currently the SU, is in place. </p>
<p>Therefore, co&#8209;operation between departments needs continual reinforcement at official </p>
<p>and Ministerial levels. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The Head of the SU must be sufficiently senior and the SU enjoy recognition </p>
<p>inside and outside government as a centre of excellence in its field if the Unit is to have </p>
<p>credibility and influence in No.10, the National Security Council, the Treasury, the FCO, </p>
<p>DFID and the MOD, and with the military. </p>
<p><b>175. </b> Section 9.8 sets out the Inquiry’s conclusions and lessons on strategy&#8209;making. </p>
