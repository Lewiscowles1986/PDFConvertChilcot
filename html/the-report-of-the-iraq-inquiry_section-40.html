<p><b>SECTION 4</b></p>
<p><b>IRAQ’S WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION</b></p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Section 4 addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how the Joint Intelligence Committee’s (JIC) Assessments of Iraq’s chemical, </p>
<p>biological, nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, and the intent of Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime to retain, produce, use or proliferate such weapons, evolved </p>
<p>between 2000 and the invasion of Iraq in March 2003;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the robustness of the evidence base on which those judgements were made;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>other advice given to Ministers on Iraq’s capabilities and intent; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the way in which the intelligence and Assessments were used:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>within Government to underpin policy decisions; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>in public statements and material presented to Parliament to underpin </p>
<p>the Government position that urgent action was needed to secure the </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the search for weapons, materials and evidence of prohibited programmes after </p>
<p>the conflict; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the background to and findings of the four previous Inquiries into aspects of the </p>
<p>issues covered in this Section. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> In doing so, the Inquiry has drawn on the JIC Assessments addressing these issues </p>
<p>produced between 2000 and 2005, which are being published alongside this Report. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> The roles of the JIC, the Cabinet Office Assessments Staff and the Secret </p>
<p>Intelligence Service (SIS), and the priority given to collection of intelligence on Iraq, are </p>
<p>set out in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> As well as documents provided by the Government and the oral evidence it was </p>
<p>given, the Inquiry has drawn on other authoritative accounts including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reports to the United Nations Security Council by the International Atomic </p>
<p>Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the UN </p>
<p>Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>various reports of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) published in 2003 to 2005. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Section 1.1 describes Iraq’s chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile </p>
<p>programmes after the 1991 Gulf Conflict and the international community’s attempts to </p>
<p>disarm Iraq – through a series of UN Security Council resolutions, a UN inspection and </p>
<p>monitoring regime and a policy of containment supported by limited military action – and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Iraq’s responses. That Section also sets out, from information available in open </p>
<p>sources, the evolution of the JIC’s Assessments of Iraq’s capabilities between 1990 </p>
<p>and December 1998.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Section 1.2 addresses the UK’s Iraq strategy between September 2000 and </p>
<p>September 2001. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The wider context of the development of UK strategy and options for Iraq after the </p>
<p>attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 (9/11) is addressed in Section 3, including the </p>
<p>judgement that Iraq was not involved in 9/11, the absence of evidence of links between </p>
<p>Iraq and Al Qaida (AQ), and the potential consequences of military action for the threat </p>
<p>to the UK and UK interests from international terrorism.</p>
<p><b>Previous Inquiries</b></p>
<p><b>8. </b> Aspects of the UK Government’s actions in relation to its assessment of Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the way in which intelligence information </p>
<p>was deployed in support of the case for urgent action to disarm Iraq, have already </p>
<p>been addressed by four previous Inquiries. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The terms of reference for each of those Inquiries, which were narrower than those </p>
<p>of the Iraq Inquiry, are set out below.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The report of the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC), <i>The </i></p>
<p><i>Decision to go to War in Iraq</i> (HC 813), was published on 7 July 2003.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> It sought to </p>
<p>“establish whether the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), within the Government </p>
<p>as a whole, presented accurate and complete information to Parliament in the period </p>
<p>leading up to military action in Iraq, particularly in respect of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> The report of the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), <i>Iraqi Weapons of Mass </i></p>
<p><i>Destruction – Intelligence and Assessments</i> (Cm 5972), was published in September </p>
<p>2003.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> The ISC stated that it had “looked at the supporting intelligence in critical areas to </p>
<p>ensure that the [JIC] Assessments reflected the intelligence correctly”.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The Report of the Inquiry into the <i>Circumstances Surrounding the Death of  </i></p>
<p><i>Dr David L Kelly CMG</i> by Lord Hutton (The Hutton Inquiry, HC 247), was published on </p>
<p>28 January 2004.</p>

<p>4  |  Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The Inquiry was established by Lord Falconer of Thororton, the Secretary of State </p>
<p>for Constitutional Affairs, on 18 July 2003:</p>
<p>“urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of </p>
<p>Dr Kelly.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Lord Hutton’s interpretation of his terms of reference is set out in his report.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Lord Hutton concluded that the “allegations attacking the integrity of the </p>
<p>Government”, broadcast on the <i>BBC</i> <i>Today</i> programme on 29 May 2003, that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the Government probably knew, before it decided to put it in its dossier ... that </p>
<p>the statement was wrong that the Iraqi military were able to deploy weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction within 45 minutes of a decision to do so”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that No.10 had “ordered the dossier to be sexed up” </p>
<p>had to be considered under his terms of reference, because it was those allegations that </p>
<p>had drawn Dr Kelly into the controversy about the broadcasts.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Lord Hutton explicitly determined that two other areas fell outside his terms of </p>
<p>reference.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> First, Lord Hutton stated that the question of “whether, if approved by the Joint </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee and believed by the Government to be reliable, the intelligence </p>
<p>contained in the dossier was nevertheless unreliable” was a “separate issue”. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Secondly, Lord Hutton wrote that he had carefully considered “the view expressed </p>
<p>by a number of public figures and commentators” that his “terms of reference required </p>
<p>or, at least, entitled” him to consider:</p>
<p>“... whether the intelligence in relation to weapons of mass destruction set out in </p>
<p>the dossier published by the Government on 24 September 2002 was of sufficient </p>
<p>strength and reliability to justify the Government in deciding that Iraq under Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein posed such a threat to the safety and interests of the United Kingdom that </p>
<p>military action should be taken against that country.” </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Lord Hutton “concluded that a question of such wide import, which would involve the </p>
<p>consideration of a wide range of evidence” did not fall within his terms of reference. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> by a Committee of </p>
<p>Privy Counsellors chaired by Lord Butler of Brockwell (The Butler Report, HC 898), </p>
<p>was published on 14 July 2004.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The Butler Review was established by Mr Blair in February 2004 to:</p>
<p>“investigate the intelligence coverage available in respect of WMD programmes in </p>
<p>countries of concern and on the global trade in WMD, taking into account what is </p>
<p>now known about these programmes; </p>
<p>“as part of this work, to investigate the accuracy of intelligence on Iraqi WMD up to </p>
<p>March 2003, and to examine any discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, </p>
<p>evaluated and used by the Government before the conflict, and between that </p>
<p>intelligence and what has been discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end </p>
<p>of the conflict; and to make recommendations to the Prime Minister for the future </p>
<p>on the gathering, evaluation and use of intelligence on WMD, in the light of the </p>
<p>difficulties of operating in countries of concern.”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The Butler Report stated that, in assessing the intelligence on Iraq’s nuclear, </p>
<p>biological, chemical and ballistic missile capabilities to establish whether there were </p>
<p>“any detectable systemic issues” which might have affected the JIC Assessments in the </p>
<p>period before March 2003 and whether Assessments made at the time of the 1990 to </p>
<p>1991 Gulf Conflict “had a lasting impact which was reflected in JIC Assessments made </p>
<p>in 2002 and 2003”, it had addressed “three broad questions”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was the quality of the intelligence and other evidence, and the </p>
<p>assessments made of it, about the <b>strategic intent</b> of the Iraqi regime to pursue </p>
<p>... programmes in contravention of its obligations under ... resolution 687?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was the quality of the intelligence or other evidence, and the assessments </p>
<p>made of it, about Iraq seeking to sustain and develop its indigenous knowledge, </p>
<p>skills and materiel base which would provide it with a <b>‘break-out’ capability</b> ...?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was the quality of the intelligence or other evidence, and the assessments </p>
<p>made of it, about Iraqi <b>production</b> or <b>possession</b> of prohibited ... agents and </p>
<p>weapons ...?”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Sir John Chilcot was a member of the Butler Review.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The Iraq Inquiry has drawn in its work on both the evidence offered to those </p>
<p>Inquiries, where available, and their analyses and conclusions, but the judgements in </p>
<p>this Report are the Inquiry’s own.</p>
<p><b>Definition of weapons of mass destruction</b></p>
<p><b>25. </b> The term “weapons of mass destruction” originated as an umbrella concept </p>
<p>covering weapons with the capability to cause indiscriminate loss of life and wide-scale </p>
<p>destruction. </p>

<p>House of Commons, <i>Official Report</i>, 3 February 2004, column 625.</p>
<p>8 </p>
<p><i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction </i>[“The Butler Report”], 14 July 2004, HC 898, </p>
<p>paragraphs 152-153.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5</p>
<p>4  |  Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction</p>
<p><b>26. </b> The first official definition was provided by the UN Commission for Conventional </p>
<p>Armaments in 1948 which defined weapons of mass destruction as “atomic explosive </p>
<p>devices, radioactive material weapons, lethal chemical and biological weapons, and any </p>
<p>weapons developed in the future which have characteristics comparable in destructive </p>
<p>effect to those of the atomic bomb or other weapons mentioned above”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> This definition </p>
<p>has been used in successive UN resolutions dealing with disarmament.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The Butler Report pointed out that there was “a considerable and long-standing </p>
<p>academic debate about the proper interpretation of the phrase ‘weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction’” which had been “used so variously as to confuse rather than enlighten </p>
<p>readers”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> The Butler Report avoided the use of the term WMD wherever possible. </p>
<p>Where it was used, for example when quoting documents or evidence, the Butler Report </p>
<p>interpreted it in the light of the obligations imposed by the UN Security Council after </p>
<p>the 1990 to 1991 Gulf Conflict to address the threat posed by Iraq and to control Iraq’s </p>
<p>military capabilities, including weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles in </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991) (see Section 1.1).</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The Inquiry shares the view expressed in the Butler Report but recognises that </p>
<p>the term has gained common currency and may, therefore, appear in the analysis </p>
<p>that follows as a shorthand description of weapons that would not fall within the </p>
<p>original definition.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> All nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are frequently characterised as </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, and radiological devices have been included </p>
<p>more recently. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> The Butler Report defined radiological weapons as those employing “conventional, </p>
<p>typically high-explosive means to distribute radioactive material”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Systems that fall within the definition of WMD may cause limited casualties within </p>
<p>a finite area; for example attacks such as the use of the chemical agent sarin in the </p>
<p>Tokyo underground. On the other hand, as the attacks on the US on 11 September </p>
<p>2001 demonstrated, mass casualties that have a strategic impact can be produced in </p>
<p>other ways. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Tim Dowse, Head of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) </p>
<p>Non-Proliferation Department from January 2001 to November 2003, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that “efforts to restrain the spread of ballistic missiles” tended to be “associated with” </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction because they provided a means of delivery against which </p>
<p>it was difficult to defend and which was regarded as “quite destabilising”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Nuclear, chemical and biological weapons are all subject to arms control regimes: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which entered </p>
<p>into force in 1970, requires non-nuclear weapons states to agree not to seek </p>
<p>to acquire nuclear weapons; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the 1975 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC)</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> and the 1997 </p>
<p>Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibit the development, production </p>
<p>and stockpiling of the respective sets of weapons. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Iraq signed the BTWC in 1972, but did not ratify it. It did not sign the CWC until </p>
<p>2009. One important difference between the two conventions is that the BTWC has no </p>
<p>effective enforcement mechanisms while the CWC does. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Iraq has never been a member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>13 </p>
<p>The BTWC reaffirms the 1925 Geneva Protocol, which prohibits use of biological and toxin weapons.</p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>The MTCR was established in 1987 to prevent the proliferation of unmanned systems capable of </p>
<p>delivering weapons of mass destruction. It is an informal and voluntary association that seeks members’ </p>
<p>adherence to common export policy guidelines (the MTCR Guidelines) applied to a common list of </p>
<p>controlled goods.</p>
