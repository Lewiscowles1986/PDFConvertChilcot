<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the evolution of the UK’s non-military relationship with the US, including the </p>
<p>processes for making decisions for which there was joint responsibility;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>political developments within Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>changing circumstances in Iraq after the main war-fighting phase of the invasion </p>
<p>concluded; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the adoption of resolution 1483 (2003).</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the role of the UK in the combat phase of military operations and the </p>
<p>establishment of the UK’s post-conflict Area of Responsibility in the South, both </p>
<p>of which are described in Section 8;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparation for what would follow once the Coalition was in </p>
<p>Occupation (known as Phase IV), including the UK’s post-conflict objectives, </p>
<p>which are described in Sections 6.4 and 6.5; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reconstruction of Iraq, which is covered in Section 10.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> The invasion of Iraq began on the night of 19/20 March 2003.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, and Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat, sent “strictly personal” notes to Mr Blair on 21 March about influencing the </p>
<p>US “post-war agenda”.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Mr Powell proposed that Mr Blair should write a note to President Bush, to “serve as </p>
<p>an agenda” for their meeting at Camp David – the US President’s country retreat – a few </p>
<p>days later.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> He identified three major objectives:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“To unpick the Kissinger aphorism that has lodged in their heads (to ignore the </p>
<p>Germans, punish the French and forgive the Russians)”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“To make Bush think further about why it was that the US ended up with such </p>
<p>a bad diplomatic defeat …”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“To agree a way forward on the MEPP [Middle East Peace Process] with Bush.”</p>

<p>  Minute Powell to Prime Minister, 21 March 2003, ‘Bush Discussion’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>7. </b> Mr Powell suggested that Mr Blair should “corral” President Bush into some general </p>
<p>principles about the role of the UN in post-conflict Iraq, observing that the US desire to </p>
<p>confine that role to managing non-governmental organisations “won’t do”. He advised: </p>
<p>“We do not want to give the UN control of the military or the government, but there has </p>
<p>to be some international legitimacy.”</p>
<p><b>8. </b> In his own note, Sir David Manning agreed with Mr Powell’s points and commented </p>
<p>that President Bush should also be encouraged to analyse the reasons behind a “strong </p>
<p>current of anti-Americanism” around much of the world.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>9. </b> A US draft of a new Security Council resolution for the post-conflict phase in Iraq was </p>
<p>shared with the British Embassy Washington on 21 March.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The two key points of difference between it and the UK draft were the relationship </p>
<p>between the UN Special Co-ordinator and a transitional civilian authority, and the </p>
<p>question of who would establish an Iraqi Interim Administration (IIA).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>11. </b> The US draft also included three options for a funding mechanism to cover </p>
<p>post-invasion costs; there was not yet a firm US view on which option was preferred.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Washington, </p>
<p>reported that some in Washington “still do not think that any form of UN resolution is </p>
<p>legally necessary”.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> In a telephone call on 22 March, Mr Blair raised the UN’s role with President Bush.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Blair said that it was essential to get a UN ‘badge’ for post-conflict efforts and </p>
<p>that, while the Coalition did not want to hand over the results of its efforts to the UN, a </p>
<p>Security Council resolution on post-conflict administration would help the Coalition get </p>
<p>access to UN funding, including from the International Financial Institutions (IFIs).</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Blair proposed that different parts of the draft resolution should proceed on </p>
<p>different timescales; a resolution on the Oil-for-Food programme (OFF)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> should move </p>
<p>quickly, with one covering administration after the conflict to follow.</p>

<p>the use of those revenues to procure food, medicine and other goods approved by the UN. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>16. </b> In parallel, Mr Brenton explained the UK’s concerns about the US draft resolution to </p>
<p>Mr John Bellinger and Mr Eliott Abrams from the US National Security Council (NSC).</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Brenton observed that:</p>
<p>“… the text had not been well received in London. If that was the initial reaction </p>
<p>there, then we could expect much worse in Paris and Moscow.”</p>
<p><b>18. </b> On 23 March, Mr Blair told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq that “British and American </p>
<p>positions were not so far apart” on the draft resolution.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> He believed that the US was </p>
<p>misreading the implications of what UN authorisation meant and added: “It was more </p>
<p>a matter of timing than substance.”</p>
<p><b>19. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the UK “needed to bring in the Russians and the French </p>
<p>as well as the Americans to resolve this issue”.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Since January 2003, National Security Presidential Directive 24 had consolidated all </p>
<p>US post-conflict activity in the Department of Defense-owned Office of Reconstruction </p>
<p>and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), headed by retired Lieutenant General Jay </p>
<p>Garner.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>21. </b> On 23 March, Major General Tim Cross, the senior UK secondee to ORHA working </p>
<p>for Lt Gen Garner, and a visiting colleague provided the Iraq Planning Unit (IPU) with an </p>
<p>update which said:</p>
<p>“The UN role in the handover process [to an Iraqi Administration] is little discussed </p>
<p>within ORHA, it being understood that this is an issue for capitals, and that </p>
<p>Washington will not accept a UN flag over the whole operation.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq was held at 0830 on Tuesday 25 March. At Ms Short’s </p>
<p>suggestion, Mr Blair commissioned urgent advice from the Attorney General on the legal </p>
<p>framework needed to authorise both reconstruction activity and the creation of an IIA.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>23. </b> On the same day, the Private Office of Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, wrote </p>
<p>to Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, with “further </p>
<p>urgent advice on the size of any UK sector, the length of time of our commitment and the </p>
<p>exit strategy”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The advice was:</p>
<p>“There is … a substantial risk that if we fail to obtain a UNSCR, we will not be able </p>
<p>to build the Coalition under overall US leadership. We would become trapped into </p>

<p>in terms of cost and for the long-term health of the Armed Forces.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> On 25 March, the FCO in London received a report from Sir Jeremy Greenstock, </p>
<p>UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, of a conversation with Mr Kofi </p>
<p>Annan, Secretary-General of the UN.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Mr Annan was due to meet Dr Condoleezza Rice, </p>
<p>President Bush’s National Security Advisor, that day.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Sir Jeremy said that he “assumed that the UN would not want to run Iraq nor its </p>
<p>security sector”. Mr Annan told him that “Coalition respect for Iraqi sovereignty, territorial </p>
<p>integrity and political independence would be a precondition for a UN role” and that he </p>
<p>“would not wish to see any arrangement subjugating UN activity to Coalition activity”.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> After meeting Mr Annan, Sir Jeremy spoke to Ambassador John Negroponte, US </p>
<p>Permanent Representative to the UN, who observed that the focus within the Security </p>
<p>Council on “no legitimisation of Coalition military action” might make it impossible to </p>
<p>secure its authorisation. Sir Jeremy reminded him that without a resolution there would </p>
<p>be no IFI or other international funding for reconstruction and it would be “hard to drum </p>
<p>up troop contributors to permit an exit strategy for US/UK forces”.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat, sent a draft paper setting out ‘British Post-Conflict Objectives’ to the FCO, </p>
<p>the MOD, DFID and the Cabinet Office on 25 March.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Mr Bowen suggested that officials should show the draft paper to their Ministers, </p>
<p>if they had not already done so:</p>
<p>“We will then see the outcome of the Prime Ministerial visit to Camp David and </p>
<p>consider formal submission early next week.”</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The paper on objectives stated:</p>
<p>“We have made plans with our international partners to assist the Iraqi people </p>
<p>in the process of transition. With others, we will assist in the return to full Iraqi </p>
<p>sovereignty by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seeking a UN mandate for the international community’s continued presence  </p>
<p>in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working to establish an Iraqi Interim Authority, mandated and facilitated by the </p>
<p>UN, and supported by the coalition and the international community; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>indicating a pathway to the restoration of a sovereign, accountable and </p>
<p>representative Iraqi government and facilitating a political process, with UN </p>

<p>involvement, whereby Iraqis can choose a new constitution for their country </p>
<p>within its present borders.”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, sent the UN Department and others a </p>
<p>copy of an IPU briefing describing what the UK was legally able to do in the absence </p>
<p>of a further resolution.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>31. </b> In a covering minute he observed:</p>
<p>“It [the briefing] brings out that the Coalition would have quite extensive powers </p>
<p>(as well as responsibilities) as Occupying Powers. We would in practice have the </p>
<p>authority to do everything which a transitional administration and security presence </p>
<p>would be capable of doing in the early weeks: humanitarian and welfare work; law </p>
<p>and order; immediate rehabilitation of infrastructure. The real constraints are not so </p>
<p>much legal as practical. It would be very difficult to get support from the EU, IFIs or </p>
<p>donor countries in the absence of an authorising resolution …</p>
<p>“This suggests that it may not be necessary to seek a resolution which authorises </p>
<p>an international security presence, at least in the early stages.”</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Ricketts commented: “it is worth considering a less ambitious resolution, perhaps </p>
<p>to be adopted later in the process”.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Dominick Chilcott, Head of the IPU from January to June 2003 and author of the </p>
<p>briefing, told the Inquiry that he had:</p>
<p>“… reasons to hesitate about the day after, which was to do with the legality </p>
<p>of ORHA’s ambition. ORHA had quite a high degree of ambition in the amount </p>
<p>of reform and reconstruction it was proposing, and we felt without specific </p>
<p>Security Council authorisation this would go beyond what we were allowed to </p>
<p>do as Occupying Powers on the basis of the Geneva Convention and </p>
<p>The Hague Regulations.”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 25 March, Mr Huw Llewellyn, a Legal Counsellor in FCO Legal Advisers, wrote </p>
<p>to Ms Cathy Adams, Legal Counsellor to Lord Goldsmith, at her request, with a note on </p>
<p>why a further resolution was needed.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> Attached to his letter were his own note on the </p>
<p>main principles applicable during military occupation, and a note on the administration </p>
<p>of justice.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Llewellyn wrote that it was:</p>
<p>“… important to keep in mind that the legal basis for the Occupation of Iraq by </p>
<p>Coalition forces will depend on the legal basis for the use of force. That legal basis is </p>

<p>137</p>
<p>Security Council authorisation to enforce Iraq’s WMD [weapons of mass destruction] </p>
<p>and related obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions. The longer </p>
<p>an occupation continues, therefore, and the further the tasks undertaken depart from </p>
<p>this objective, the more difficult the Occupation would be to justify in legal terms.”</p>
<p><b>36. </b> In a section on the administration of Iraq during Occupation, Mr Llewellyn explained </p>
<p>that “limitations on the ability of the Occupying Power to change existing governmental </p>
<p>and administrative structures based in Article 43 of the Hague Regulations, mean that </p>
<p>Security Council authorisation will be needed for any such reform”.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> In preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush at Camp David, Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>Private Office provided Mr Rycroft with a negotiating brief for a new UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolution written by the IPU.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The brief said:</p>
<p>“Without a UNSCR, other countries, international organisations, the IFIs, UN </p>
<p>agencies and NGOs [non-governmental organisations] will be comparatively limited </p>
<p>in what they can do … That would leave US/UK with no viable exit strategy from Iraq </p>
<p>and a huge bill.”</p>
<p><b>39. </b> The brief set out the case for a resolution which included the following key </p>
<p>principles, on which the US and UK were agreed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For the first few weeks the Coalition, through ORHA, would be responsible for </p>
<p>the administration of Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN should not be asked to run Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The objective should be to get Security Council authorisation or endorsement </p>
<p>for an international presence that will include the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For as long as they were needed, Coalition troops would provide security on </p>
<p>the ground.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As soon as possible, Iraqis should begin to govern themselves, through the </p>
<p>creation of an IIA, under appropriate supervision.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> The brief also identified the key issues on which there remained differences </p>
<p>between the US and UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US desire for a new UN resolution to endorse ORHA, which the UK was </p>
<p>certain would not obtain Security Council agreement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK belief that the Iraqis themselves, assisted by a UN Special </p>
<p>Representative, should establish the IIA, not the Coalition.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The role of the IIA, which the UK believed needed to be independent of the </p>
<p>Coalition/ORHA and to have genuine executive authority.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The arrangements for dealing with Iraqi oil revenue which the US proposed </p>
<p>should be used for meeting the costs of their administration of Iraq as well as </p>
<p>for reconstruction. The UK feared this would provoke criticism for reneging on </p>
<p>the promise to use oil revenues exclusively for the benefit of Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The role of the UN Special Co-ordinator, which the UK believed should not </p>
<p>be limited to co-ordination.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The brief explained that there was a need for “more realism about what the Security </p>
<p>Council would be willing to approve and what the Iraqis’ reaction is likely to be”.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> The IPU set out a number of “propositions” which it hoped Mr Blair and President </p>
<p>Bush would agree, including:</p>
<p>“(a)  … we should not attempt retrospective UNSC authorisation of our military  </p>
<p>action …</p>
<p>(b)  … We can’t expect the Security Council to accept overt US/UK control of the </p>
<p>civilian administration …</p>
<p>(c)  As quickly as possible, we should aim to set up an Iraqi interim authority with </p>
<p>genuine executive powers, not subordinate to the Coalition …</p>
<p>(d)  How we establish the IIA … will be crucial … our role should be behind the </p>
<p>scenes with the UN visibly out in front …</p>
<p>(e)  The UN or the Iraqis, not the Coalition, should manage oil revenues.</p>
<p>(f) </p>
<p>We should encourage Kofi Annan to appoint a UN Special Co-ordinator who </p>
<p>would play an important role in facilitating the emergence of the Iraqi interim </p>
<p>authority and in supervising, with a light touch, its decisions.”</p>
<p><b>43. </b> On 26 March, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, wrote to Mr Blair with advice </p>
<p>he had requested at the Ad Hoc Meeting the previous day.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> It covered:</p>
<p>“… the need for UN Security Council authorisation for the Coalition or the </p>
<p>international community to establish an interim Iraqi administration to reform and </p>
<p>restructure Iraq and its administration.”</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s view was that:</p>
<p>“… a further Security Council resolution is needed to authorise imposing reform </p>
<p>and restructuring of Iraq and its Government. In the absence of a further resolution, </p>
<p>the UK (and US) would be bound by the provisions of international law governing </p>
<p>belligerent Occupation … the general principle is that an Occupying Power does </p>
<p>not become the government of the occupied territory. Rather, it exercises temporary </p>
<p>de facto control …”</p>

<p>139</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Llewellyn sent Lord Goldsmith’s advice to Mr Chilcott on 27 March.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Straw met President Bush, Mr Colin Powell (US Secretary of State) </p>
<p>and Dr Rice at Camp David from 26 to 27 March.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> In his published diaries Mr Alastair Campbell, No.10 Director of Strategy and </p>
<p>Communications, recorded that Mr Blair worked on “on a long note for Bush” during </p>
<p>the flight to the US.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Mr Campbell considered that:</p>
<p>“The main message in TB’s note, when you boiled it down, was that there was </p>
<p>a lot of support for the aims of the campaign, and we totally believed the policy </p>
<p>was right, but there was real concern at the way the US put over their views and </p>
<p>intentions and that rested in people’s fears about their perceived unilateralism. </p>
<p>He was urging him to do more to rebuild with Germany, then Russia, then France, </p>
<p>and saying he should seize the moment for a new global agenda, one to unite the </p>
<p>world rather than divide it.”</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush, which covered a broad range of issues, began:</p>
<p>“This is the moment when you can define international priorities for the next </p>
<p>generation: the true post-cold war world order. Our ambition is big: to construct a </p>
<p>global agenda around which we can unite the world rather than dividing it into rival </p>
<p>centres of power.”</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Mr Blair went on to define “our fundamental goal” as:</p>
<p>“… to spread our values of freedom, democracy, tolerance and the rule of law, but </p>
<p>we need a broad based agenda capable of unifying the world to get it. That’s why, </p>
<p>though Iraq’s WMD is the immediate justification for action, ridding Iraq of Saddam </p>
<p>is the real prize.”</p>
<p><b>50. </b> In Mr Blair’s view “a ludicrous and distorted view of the US is clouding the enormous </p>
<p>attraction of the fundamental goal”, for which the solution was to “keep the policy; </p>
<p>broaden the agenda and change the presentation”.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> At dinner on the first evening at Camp David, Mr Blair told President Bush that </p>
<p>he did not want his visit to focus primarily on a UN resolution to deal with post-conflict </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> The question about what sort of resolution was needed for the administration and </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq should be parked. Mr Blair said that:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>52. </b> In his account of discussions on Phase IV the following day, Mr Rycroft recorded </p>
<p>that Mr Blair had identified the main issue as whether the UN formed the future Iraqi </p>
<p>Government or whether the Coalition did so with UN endorsement, but had said that  </p>
<p>“it was not helpful to expose this distinction yet”.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that the US and UK would “play this negotiation long”, </p>
<p>until after the conflict, when they would be “in a stronger position to ensure the right </p>
<p>arrangements”.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> After returning to the UK, Mr Blair told members of the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq that </p>
<p>in relation to the post-conflict administration of Iraq:</p>
<p>“He intended to calm down the debate and engage in subterranean diplomacy so </p>
<p>that we reached the right outcome.”</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Mr Blair also said:</p>
<p>“A new United Nations Security Council resolution would be required. The tactics to </p>
<p>achieve that was through quiet and effective diplomacy.”</p>
<p><b>56. </b> FCO Legal Advisers were asked to give rapid consideration on 28 March to the </p>
<p>draft text of a ‘Freedom Message’ and ‘Proclamation’ addressed to Iraqi citizens which it </p>
<p>was intended that General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief US Central Command </p>
<p>(CENTCOM),</p>
<p> </p>
<p>would issue.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> In his advice to Mr Chilcott, Mr Llewellyn observed that if General Franks were to </p>
<p>speak on behalf of the Coalition, “we should be given a full opportunity to comment on </p>
<p>its content in detail”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>58. </b> On the content of the draft, Mr Llewellyn advised that “there are a number of </p>
<p>elements in it which raise concerns regarding their compatibility with the authority of an </p>
<p>Occupying Power”. Specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the length of Occupation should be based on time taken for WMD disarmament, </p>
<p>not the creation of a representative government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>references to free elections went beyond the remit of an Occupying Power;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the phrase “powers of government” implied that the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority (CPA) described in the message had more than the temporary </p>
<p>administrative powers of an occupying force;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>requiring Iraqis to provide information on the conflict with Iran was outside the </p>
<p>lawful basis for Occupation; and</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>powers to place the public sector under Coalition Provisional Authority direction </p>
<p>were too broad.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> On 31 March, Ms Vivien Rose, MOD Head of the General and International Law </p>
<p>Team, spoke to Mr Llewellyn and agreed to write a letter outlining what the MOD </p>
<p>considered to be legal issues that needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Ms Rose reported that Mr Llewellyn had expressed concern that he was receiving </p>
<p>disjointed requests for advice about specific activities in Iraq and was not “getting a grip </p>
<p>of the whole picture”.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> On 31 March, Mr Llewellyn wrote to Mr Chilcott to report that UK military lawyers </p>
<p>based in Kuwait were becoming alarmed at ORHA’s activities.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>62. </b> ORHA had issued three orders in relation to the port of Umm Qasr,</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> including  </p>
<p>the application of US labour and customs laws, for which there was no clear legal </p>
<p>authority. The position of UK forces, if asked to participate in related activities, was </p>
<p>therefore uncertain.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Llewellyn’s minute concluded:</p>
<p>“If it cannot be sorted out, we may well need a decision from Ministers about </p>
<p>whether UK forces should decline to take part in actions that we consider </p>
<p>unauthorised or unlawful.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> The IPU provided advice to Mr Straw’s Private Office the following day, including </p>
<p>a speaking note for a conversation with Maj Gen Cross, which took account of  </p>
<p>Mr Llewellyn’s concerns.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>65. </b> The IPU proposed that Mr Straw should brief Maj Gen Cross that:</p>
<p>“Government’s legal advice is very clear: there are real legal constraints on what we </p>
<p>can and can’t do in Phase IV. I’ll need to be closely involved in decisions on what </p>
<p>ORHA does …”</p>
<p><b>66. </b> The speaking note also proposed reminding Maj Gen Cross that:</p>
<p>“There’s a direct link between what you are doing and the difficult and complex </p>
<p>negotiations which will start in due course on the Phase IV Security Council </p>
<p>Resolution.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>67. </b> In relation to his own position, the IPU suggested that Maj Gen Cross should be </p>
<p>told that he would be formally appointed as a deputy to the Head of ORHA only once </p>
<p>a resolution authorising its activity had been agreed.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> Alongside the speaking note, the IPU also provided a four page review of UK policy </p>
<p>on ORHA. In it the IPU recommended that the UK should continue to commit resources, </p>
<p>on the basis that ORHA remained “the only game in town”, but noted that “a situation </p>
<p>could arise where ORHA was acting illegally”. That would have “implications” for both </p>
<p>UK secondees and ORHA operations in areas held by British forces. The IPU did not </p>
<p>offer a solution or recommendation if the situation did arise.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> At the end of March, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary provided Mr Rycroft with an IPU </p>
<p>paper covering UK, European and US positions on post-conflict arrangements and the </p>
<p>role of the UN.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> The covering letter said that:</p>
<p>“… our views are almost certainly very close to those of France and Germany … </p>
<p>I say almost certainly because we have yet to test … views in detail.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> The letter also said:</p>
<p>“One of the lessons from negotiating UNSCR 1441 is that we need to share our </p>
<p>initial thinking with France, Germany and Russia at an early stage. We will need </p>
<p>their support if a UN resolution is to pass. We should not negotiate texts, nor seek </p>
<p>a collective position.”</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The IPU paper included an assessment that EU member states were likely to </p>
<p>want a central role for the UN that was not subordinate to the Coalition and that did not </p>
<p>legitimise military action. The UN’s main contributions would be to building a new Iraqi </p>
<p>Government and managing Iraq’s natural resources.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> The FCO proposed a series of bilateral meetings between UK Ministers and </p>
<p>officials and their counterparts to “share our thinking”, including a conversation between </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Secretary Powell. The IPU assessed that Security Council endorsement </p>
<p>was desirable rather than essential to the US; agreement on a resolution was unlikely to </p>
<p>be reached if the US retained the degree of control they wanted.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> On 31 March, Mr Ricketts wrote to Mr Brenton about dialogue with European </p>
<p>countries on a resolution. He said:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister wants us to take our time over the issue of a post-conflict </p>
<p>resolution. The right time to bring this to a head is likely to be once we have </p>
<p>reached, or are near to, an end to the military conflict. That will be our moment </p>
<p>of greatest leverage in the Security Council.” </p>

<p><b>74. </b> Mr Ricketts also observed that, as a draft resolution had yet to be agreed with the </p>
<p>US, the series of meetings about to begin across Europe would not be negotiating </p>
<p>resolution text. Mr Straw would nonetheless be meeting his German, Russian, French </p>
<p>and Spanish counterparts.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush two Notes on 31 March, one on communications, </p>
<p>which is described in Section 8, and one entitled ‘Reconstruction’.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The Note on reconstruction covered the two funds proposed by the US to </p>
<p>administer oil revenues/unblocked Iraqi assets and donor funds, run by the IMF and </p>
<p>World Bank respectively. Mr Blair wrote that using IFIs was sensible but that this </p>
<p>arrangement would run into problems because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>channelling oil revenues to IFIs rather than the IIA could be “misrepresented” </p>
<p>and the proposal would need to be included in the next resolution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>without UN agreement the IFIs were unlikely to agree and this would “replicate </p>
<p>UN problems inside those two organisations”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK, Japan and others could only unblock assets with UN authority; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“our posture should be for the IIA to take on responsibility as soon as possible,  </p>
<p>ie Iraq for the Iraqis, not us or the UN”.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Mr Blair described an amended proposal submitted by the Treasury, in which some </p>
<p>oil revenues went into the OFF programme, and the remainder (plus assets and donor </p>
<p>funds) into a reconstruction account handled by the IMF and World Bank. Funds from </p>
<p>both accounts would be “directed to the IIA”. Any proposals would need to be tailored in </p>
<p>a way that could secure UN endorsement. Mr Blair wrote that he did “not think we can </p>
<p>dodge this point” and said that the key to achieving that was “getting the right Special </p>
<p>Co-ordinator” in order to avoid becoming bogged down in UN bureaucracy.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> In response to a request from Mr Straw’s Private Office for material on Iraqi </p>
<p>attitudes to the US and possible implications for UK policy, Mr Simon Fraser, FCO </p>
<p>Director for Strategy and Innovation, wrote on 31 March:</p>
<p>“We need to understand the history and experiences of the people of Iraq as well </p>
<p>as the nature of the regime …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Most ordinary Iraqis may loathe Saddam: but they may by now be so politically </p>
<p>disorientated as not to believe that an alternative is possible.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>“We should not underestimate the force of Iraqi nationalism … The divisions and </p>
<p>loyalties within Iraq are complex. Iraqi Shia are both Arabs and Iraqis: they are </p>
<p>certainly not Persians. The Persians are the historical enemy. I believe that the </p>
<p>Iraqi national identity is stronger and more rooted in shared experience than many </p>
<p>pundits think. Saddam Hussein has played on this sense of national pride – Iraqis </p>
<p>used to be nicknamed the ‘Prussians of the Middle East’ …”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Fraser advised that distrust of the US ran deep:</p>
<p>“For 35 years and more (even when the US was supporting Saddam) Iraqis have </p>
<p>been pumped full of propaganda that the US is hostile to Arabs and supports Israel </p>
<p>and Zionism. There is no doubt American policies towards Arab/Israel generate </p>
<p>deep hostility. Iraqis may long to be freed from Saddam Hussein, but being liberated </p>
<p>by the Americans will be deeply humiliating. I doubt, too, that they have much </p>
<p>confidence in what will come next. I cannot see how there would be much appetite </p>
<p>for an American-led Administration.”</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Attitudes to the UK were described by Mr Fraser as “ambivalent”:</p>
<p>“As so often with the former colonial power, it has been love-hate. As recently as </p>
<p>the early 1980s Iraqi students were the most numerous group of overseas students </p>
<p>in Britain. But we have lost our contacts since then, and our siding with the US </p>
<p>on sanctions and NFZ [No-Fly Zone] policy over recent years, culminating in this </p>
<p>campaign, has presumably affected popular attitudes to Britain.”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Mr Fraser concluded that any overtly US-led administration would be “untenable” </p>
<p>and Iraqis “may find it deeply humiliating”. There would almost certainly be attacks </p>
<p>on US personnel. It was therefore “critically important that we continue to press for </p>
<p>legitimisation of interim and longer-term arrangements in Iraq through an effective </p>
<p>UN presence”. There was also “an even greater premium on a real change of heart </p>
<p>in Washington on the MEPP”.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> That presented the UK with a dilemma over withdrawal:</p>
<p>“We will need to stay to support a long term, viable political settlement in Iraq </p>
<p>(and have a clear idea of what that entails). Failure by us and the Americans to see </p>
<p>through the peace would compound the problem. But if the Americans insist on the </p>
<p>sort of model for Iraq that they currently seem to envisage, being closely aligned with </p>
<p>them may have political and security costs for us. Putting some distance between us </p>
<p>and them, where we can afford to, may be no bad thing.”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office informed Mr Fraser on 1 May that Mr Straw had read the </p>
<p>paper “and kept it in his useful papers pack for the last several weeks”.</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>The legal framework for the Occupation</b></p>
<p>It was widely understood by both the US and UK that once they had displaced the </p>
<p>regime of Saddam Hussein, Coalition Forces would exercise authority over – and, under </p>
<p>international law be occupiers in – Iraq. FCO lawyers confirmed on 2 April 2003  </p>
<p>that by that date, UK forces were an Occupying Power in that part of Iraq in their  </p>
<p>physical control.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>The basic principles of International Humanitarian Law as they apply to military action, in </p>
<p>particular in relation to targeting and the Rules of Engagement, are set out in Section 6.1.</p>
<p>This Box explains the main principles applicable to the occupation of one state by another, </p>
<p>a process which makes it the “Occupying Power”.</p>
<p>As Occupying Powers, the UK and USA were bound by international law on belligerent </p>
<p>Occupation. Its rules are set out in the 1907 Hague Regulations (Articles 42 to 56), the </p>
<p>Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 1949 </p>
<p>(Articles 27 to 34 and 47 to 78) and the 1977 First Protocol to the Geneva Conventions </p>
<p>of 1949 Relating to the Protection of Victims of International Armed Conflicts.</p>
<p>Article 42 of the Hague Regulations defines an Occupation:</p>
<p>“Territory is considered occupied when it is actually placed under the authority of the </p>
<p>hostile army. The occupation extends only to the territory where such authority has </p>
<p>been established and can be exercised.”</p>
<p>In Iraq in April 2003 this meant that, at a minimum, the UK was considered the Occupying </p>
<p>Power in that part of South-East Iraq where its forces were physically present and </p>
<p>exercised authority. The UK’s role alongside the US in ORHA (and then the CPA) raised </p>
<p>questions about whether the UK was also jointly responsible for the actions of those </p>
<p>organisations throughout Iraq.</p>
<p>Article 43 of the Hague Regulations provides that the Occupying Power “shall take all </p>
<p>the measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and </p>
<p>safety while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country”. </p>
<p>Sir Michael Wood, a former FCO Legal Adviser, told the Inquiry: “While some changes to </p>
<p>the legislative and administrative structure may be permissible if they are necessary for </p>
<p>public order and safety, more wide-reaching reforms of governmental and administrative </p>
<p>structures are not lawful. That includes the imposition of major economic reforms.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>The Fourth Geneva Convention defines “protected persons” as those who “find </p>
<p>themselves … in the hands of a party to the conflict or Occupying Power of which they </p>
<p>are not nationals”. It sets out a number of detailed provisions on status and treatment </p>
<p>of protected persons; and a number of responsibilities and restrictions that apply to </p>
<p>the Occupying Power in relation to the occupied territory. The provisions of particular </p>
<p>relevance to the UK’s involvement in Iraq are:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 54, which prohibits any alteration in the status of public officials should they </p>
<p>abstain from fulfilling their functions for reasons of conscience. It does not affect </p>
<p>the right of the Occupying Power to remove public officials from their posts.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 64, which requires that the penal laws of the occupied territory must remain </p>
<p>in force except where they constitute a threat to security or an obstacle to the </p>
<p>application of the Convention itself. In addition, with limited exceptions, the courts </p>
<p>in the occupied territory must be allowed to continue to operate.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 78, which empowers the Occupying Power, if it is necessary for reasons of </p>
<p>security, to intern nationals of the occupied state, and other nationals within the </p>
<p>occupied state. Procedures for review and appeal of internment should be put </p>
<p>in place, including review every six months by a competent body set up by the </p>
<p>Occupying Power. The Article also sets out detailed provisions for the treatment  </p>
<p>of internees.</p>
<p>Insofar as the provisions of the Convention allow an Occupying Power to exercise </p>
<p>functions of government in occupied territory, Article 6 provides that they should continue </p>
<p>to have effect for as long as its military Occupation continues. Other provisions, however, </p>
<p>cease to apply “one year after the general close of military operations”. Article 64 therefore </p>
<p>continued to apply. But when military operations ended Article 54, Article 78 and the </p>
<p>regulations governing internment in Articles 79 to 141 ceased to apply.</p>

<p><b>84. </b> On 1 April, the first ORHA staff entered Iraq (having previously been stationed in </p>

<p>“It was as important to win the diplomatic and political campaign as it was to achieve  </p>

<p>40</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Although the minutes of that meeting contain no reference to post-conflict </p>

<p>Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, that Ms Short had “welcomed the emerging consensus </p>
<p>… on what the core principles for a UNSCR (or UNSCRs) for rehabilitation, reform and </p>

<p><b>89. </b> On 2 April, Mr Llewellyn wrote again to the IPU about the legality of ORHA actions.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Activity around Umm Qasr, which was under UK control, pointed to the fact </p>
<p>that ORHA was acting on behalf of Coalition forces jointly. That made it increasingly </p>
<p>important that the UK Government was consulted on its plans. Mr Llewellyn urged the </p>
<p>IPU to exert whatever influence it had to ensure that happened.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell met in Brussels on 3 April. The Government has </p>
<p>been unable to provide the Inquiry with a record of their discussion. But in advance of </p>
<p>the meeting, the IPU provided Mr Straw with advice on how an IIA might be created, </p>
<p>for him to share with Secretary Powell.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>92. </b> In its advice, the IPU set out concerns about the legal constraints in creating an </p>
<p>Iraqi administration:</p>
<p>“Without UN authorisation, any bodies set up or decisions taken on issues other </p>
<p>than delivery of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, security </p>
<p>or public order, whether by the Coalition or others, would not fall within the authority </p>
<p>of Occupying Powers and would therefore be illegal. This applies to the formation of </p>
<p>an interim administration and any constitutional changes and reform programmes. </p>
<p>The US have a different interpretation of the legal position. They need to be clear </p>
<p>about the constraints which apply to UK activity, including our participation in ORHA. </p>
<p>The strongest argument is however political: we need a UN-authorised process to </p>
<p>provide the right people to participate in the interim authority and to gain maximum </p>
<p>support from Iraqis and internationally. We see the UN Special Co-ordinator/</p>
<p>Representative visibly facilitating the process leading to the IIA’s establishment with </p>
<p>the Coalition in the background. The US view, across government, is the opposite.”</p>
<p><b>93. </b> A paper attached to the IPU advice described the possible steps in the process of </p>
<p>political reconstruction in Iraq as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The establishment of a Consultative Council at a national level and Joint </p>
<p>Commissions at a local level to advise and act as the interface with the Coalition </p>
<p>transitional military and civil administration.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A process to select an IIA, such as a conference similar to the Bonn Conference </p>
<p>for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Formation of an IIA.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>94. </b> Mr Brenton was relaying the same view of the political process to the US </p>
<p>Administration.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported some optimism that views in the National </p>
<p>Security Council were close to those of the UK, and were gaining traction with President </p>
<p>Bush. But there were some areas of disagreement between the US and UK, in particular </p>
<p>on how the IIA would be formed and the precise role the UN would play. The fact that </p>
<p>they were “not ready, having lost lives to liberate Iraq, to hand control of it over to the </p>
<p>UN”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>was described as a “US red line”.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Reporting from New York, Sir Jeremy Greenstock described a US vision for an IIA </p>
<p>which would “advise and assist” a Coalition which continued to run Iraq.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>97. </b> At the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 3 April, Mr Blair told attendees that the IIA:</p>
<p>“… had to be a genuinely representative body irrespective of how it was brought </p>
<p>into being. He intended to put forward an alternative to the ideas coming out of </p>
<p>Washington at present.”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>98. </b> On 4 April, Ms Rose sent Mr Llewellyn the letter she had promised on MOD </p>
<p>concerns regarding potential ORHA actions, “with a view to identifying legal issues for </p>
<p>further consideration”.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> She wrote that it was “of paramount importance” to clarify the </p>
<p>legal issues regarding ORHA activity.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Ms Rose explained that the MOD expected that “at the national level” ORHA </p>
<p>would “direct Coalition action throughout Iraq”. Ms Rose identified a need to consider </p>
<p>the UK’s position on that role, and on the relationship between ORHA and “the civil </p>
<p>administrations in the areas of the country for which the UK will be responsible”.  </p>
<p>Ms Rose explained that the MOD was discussing use of “the Joint Commission model” </p>
<p>in those areas to enable “effective civil-military crisis co-ordination”.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> The letter from Ms Rose listed a number of ORHA’s proposed activities that were </p>
<p>“likely to be illegal”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>installing Coalition nominees as “shadow Ministers”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>filling vacated posts in the Iraqi criminal justice system;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>appointing a US contractor to run Umm Qasr and opening a customs facility; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>any management or exploration of Iraqi oilfields that went beyond their repair.</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>101. </b> In preparation for a meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush to be held at </p>
<p>Hillsborough Castle near Belfast, Mr Rycroft chaired talks between US and UK officials </p>
<p>on 4 April.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p><b>102. </b> The US team was led by Mr John Bellinger, Legal Adviser to the National Security </p>
<p>Council.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Before the talks, Mr Brenton wrote to Sir David Manning to provide “the clearest </p>
<p>possible view of where the Americans are”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> Mr Brenton said that clarity on that had </p>
<p>been obscured by “intense Washington departmental infighting”, but he suspected that </p>
<p>at the talks:</p>
<p>“… key areas of disagreement between us will boil down to how to ensure the proper </p>
<p>balance between external and internal Iraqis is [sic] the IIA, and precisely what role </p>
<p>the UN will play in putting the IIA together.”</p>
<p><b>104. </b> In Mr Brenton’s opinion those were “important points but ought not to be deal </p>
<p>breakers”.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Brenton warned that the UK was in danger of being “left behind by events” in </p>
<p>the staffing of ORHA; lists of officials to shadow Iraqi Ministries were almost complete, </p>
<p>and the UK had not made a bid.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Brenton wrote:</p>
<p>“Following our significant military efforts we surely have an interest in following </p>
<p>through to the civilian phase. If so, given the advanced state of US preparation, it will </p>
<p>be important that we vigorously pursue the point …”</p>
<p><b>107. </b> In addition to Mr Brenton’s advice, on 3 April the IPU provided Mr Rycroft with a </p>
<p>minute containing an annotated version of the agenda for the talks and a commentary </p>
<p>on the latest US draft resolution, which Mr Chilcott had just seen.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The commentary described the UK’s problems with the US draft as being that it:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>envisaged a UN Special Co-ordinator with a limited role in creating the IIA, which </p>
<p>would in turn be subordinate to the Coalition;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>implied endorsement of military action, something the Security Council was </p>
<p>unlikely to agree;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lifted all sanctions against Iraq without requiring WMD disarmament to be </p>
<p>demonstrated; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>placed oil revenues under Coalition control.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>150</p>
<p><b>109. </b> Since the US draft did not meet UK requirements, Mr Chilcott proposed the talks </p>
<p>should focus on principles, which could then be turned into text at a later stage.</p>
<p><b>110. </b> Issues for discussion at the talks were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>arrangements for the immediate post-conflict period, including providing advisers </p>
<p>to Ministries rather than giving Iraqi exiles or Coalition officials an executive role;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establishing the IIA, facilitated by a UN Special Co-ordinator rather than the US;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic issues, including the control of oil revenues by the UN or the IIA, but </p>
<p>not the Coalition; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the tactical approach to a further resolution, recognising that a large resolution </p>
<p>covering all aspects of activity in Iraq was less likely to succeed than a series of </p>
<p>smaller ones.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Mr Chilcott proposed that Mr Blair and President Bush should discuss a strategy for </p>
<p>building international support which took into account that it was not realistic to expect </p>
<p>“the UN Security Council to endorse an American designed plan for Iraq”.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>112. </b> Mr Brenton reported to the FCO in London on both 3 and 4 April.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> In his first telegram, he reported conversations with US officials at the Departments </p>
<p>of State and Defense and in the NSC.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>114. </b> The Department of Defense had made clear that the UN could not have a role in </p>
<p>selecting candidates for the IIA. US interlocutors had said that there was likely to be an </p>
<p>Iraqi conference, possibly in Southern Iraq in the following week, which would set out </p>
<p>ideas for establishing the IIA. Mr Brenton had emphasised the need for the UK to be </p>
<p>consulted on setting up the IIA and on the conference.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Mr Brenton’s telegram the following day sought to clarify US positions on Phase </p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> He emphasised that the NSC was close to the UK position on most of the Phase IV </p>
<p>agenda. There was considerable common ground between the US and the UK, including </p>
<p>on the need for a “significant UN role” and that oil revenues should be “in the hands of” </p>
<p>Iraqis and spent by the Coalition only for tasks authorised by a UN resolution.</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>117. </b> Mr Rycroft had opened the talks by describing common ground between the UK </p>
<p>and the US, including the principle that the UN should have a role and that a further </p>
<p>resolution would be sought. It was too early to discuss negotiating tactics.</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr Cannon reported that the US delegation had said that a resolution was </p>
<p>politically and diplomatically useful and legally beneficial, but not absolutely necessary. </p>
<p>The US delegation was clear that it did not want the UN’s role to include being in charge </p>
<p>of establishing the IIA.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> UK officials explained that, without a resolution, they had legal difficulties with </p>
<p>making changes to Iraqi institutions; the US legal interpretation was different.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> The US delegation proposed that Iraqi oil revenues should be under the </p>
<p>supervision of ORHA (if necessary with a “double-signature” arrangement with the IIA). </p>
<p>Treasury officials in the US delegation said that the UN should not manage  </p>
<p>Iraq’s budget.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Cannon reported that on balance UK officials found the US approach </p>
<p>reassuring; although there were policy differences in a number of important areas, there </p>
<p>were also signs of flexibility.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> On 4 April, Mr Rycroft wrote an account of the talks for Mr Blair in which he judged: </p>
<p>“There remain differences between us and much still to do, but it was moderately </p>
<p>encouraging.”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> The main differences between the US and UK were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the legal interpretation of how much the Coalition could do, through ORHA, </p>
<p>as an Occupying Power;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to set up the IIA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UN’s relationship with the IIA; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>negotiating tactics – the US preferred to “aim high at this stage and water </p>
<p>down our text only later”.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr Straw told the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 4 April that he felt renewed optimism </p>
<p>about achieving a UN framework for Phase IV activity in Iraq, following a meeting of </p>
<p>NATO and EU Foreign Ministers:</p>
<p>“He had registered with these colleagues that domestic politics and expectations </p>
<p>had been changed by the fact of having British troops in Iraq. The reality was that </p>
<p>the Coalition would have to retain some control in the wake of conflict, but the United </p>
<p>Nations should also be involved.”</p>

<p>and Mr Andy Card, President Bush’s Chief of Staff, by video conference on the afternoon </p>
<p>of 4 April.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Mr Blair commented that reports from discussions with European partners </p>
<p>indicated that they would like to “find a way back”. He thought that getting the right </p>
<p>“framework of principles” for Phase IV should help.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> On 5 April, Sir Jeremy Greenstock sent an update on post-conflict discussions with </p>
<p>the US to the FCO in London.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy observed that the latest US draft resolution </p>
<p>“suggests continuing UK/US differences that will be fundamental to whether or not we </p>
<p>can secure post-conflict UN resolutions”. He suggested that “piecemeal resolutions”, as </p>
<p>opposed to a single “omnibus” version, might be the right tactic, as it would allow drafting </p>
<p>to be responsive to conditions on the ground and for positive momentum to build.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Ms Short wrote to Mr Blair on 7 April, copied to Mr Straw and others, urging him to </p>
<p>“agree with the US, proper limits to ORHA’s mandate and a process for inviting the UN </p>
<p>to lead on IIA preparations”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Ms Short identified four UK “bottom lines”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>limiting ORHA’s mandate to Geneva and Hague Convention obligations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the process for appointing the IIA should be facilitated by the UN;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>involving International Financial Institutions in the reconstruction effort, which </p>
<p>would require a new resolution; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>revenues from Iraq’s oil remaining under UN Security Council stewardship.</p>
<p><b>129. </b> On the same day, Mr Straw responded to a request from Mr Blair for advice on </p>
<p>whether UK secondees’ positions in ORHA should be formalised.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> His response was </p>
<p>copied only to Lord Goldsmith.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Mr Straw said that his instinctive reaction was that the UK ought to be fully  </p>
<p>involved in ORHA. He had consulted officials and the Attorney General, and relayed  </p>
<p>the latter’s initial reaction that if the UK formalised the position of UK secondees “then </p>
<p>the risk of the United Kingdom being jointly responsible for <i>all</i> ORHA’s actions increases </p>
<p>(including in the 75 percent-80 percent of Iraq which will be under US and not UK  </p>
<p>de facto control)”.</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>131. </b> To avoid this risk, Mr Straw suggested agreeing a Memorandum of Understanding </p>
<p>(MOU) with the US which would specify full consultation with the UK and joint </p>
<p>decision-making on policy decisions about ORHA’s activities. He attached a draft. </p>
<p>Mr Straw also observed that greater clarity about the role of the UN would reduce </p>
<p>anxieties about ORHA.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary also sent Mr Rycroft a briefing for Mr Blair to use at </p>
<p>the Hillsborough meeting, written by the IPU.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>133. </b> The briefing described the task for Hillsborough as:</p>
<p>“… to expand the extent of US-UK agreement, particularly on the role of the UN in </p>
<p>accompanying and facilitating the political process leading to the establishment of </p>
<p>an Iraqi interim authority.”</p>
<p><b>134. </b> The best outcome would be an agreed set of principles governing activity in </p>
<p>post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Concerns remained about how the IIA would be established and supervised </p>
<p>to ensure it was supported by all sectors of Iraqi society. In particular, the UK was </p>
<p>concerned about US plans for “rushing ahead” with the appointment of the IIA “with no </p>
<p>regard for Iraqi buy-in”. The timing of the proposed Iraqi conference (12 April) was far too </p>
<p>soon; as there would not be many “liberated Iraqi leaders from inside Iraq”, Iraqi exiles </p>
<p>would be bound to dominate.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> The IPU suggested instead that an IIA should take immediate responsibility for </p>
<p>“innocuous” Iraqi Ministries, with the more complex ones added once its capacity had </p>
<p>increased, and the most sensitive once they were “well on the path of reform”.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> The IPU proposed that Mr Blair should raise the requirement for ORHA to stay </p>
<p>within the bounds of international law with President Bush, observing that US and UK </p>
<p>lawyers still did not have a shared interpretation of the powers of Occupation.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> In a note for Mr Blair covering the briefing for Hillsborough, Mr Rycroft explained </p>
<p>that Dr Rice would give a presentation on ORHA, and that the UK needed clarity on </p>
<p>what the organisation would actually do with each ministry.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> He observed that ORHA </p>
<p>should field “technical advisers, not shadow Ministers”.</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Mr Rycroft highlighted agreeing a “partnership” with the UN as the key issue for </p>
<p>the talks.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>UK troops enter Basra</b></p>
<p>As described in Section 8, by 7 April UK troops had entered the city of Basra.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>The Chiefs of Staff were informed on 8 April that the troops clearing the old city area of </p>
<p>Basra had been “met by a jubilant population”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>A report on the evening of the same day stated that: “The situation in the city has </p>
<p>stabilised … although looting will remain a problem until normal policing is restored.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>The overnight report from COBR informed Sir David Manning that Major General Robin </p>
<p>Brims (General Officer Commanding 1st (UK) Armoured Division) had identified a potential </p>
<p>local leader in Basra “with whom he can do business” and had begun the process of </p>
<p>establishing a joint commission.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> Looting was “not as bad as reported in the media”.</p>
<p>Discussion of Basra at the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 9 April and at Cabinet on 10 April </p>
<p>is covered in Section 8.</p>
<p>In his book <i>Losing Iraq</i>, Mr Stephen Pelletière, a former CIA senior political analyst on Iraq </p>
<p>described the public response to the arrival of UK troops in Basra as “surprising” because:</p>
<p>“Instead of being welcomed joyously, the British practically were ignored. Indeed they </p>
<p>were forced to look on helplessly <i>as the Basrawis indulged in an orgy of looting</i>.”</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>Major General Graham Binns, Commander of the 7 Armoured Brigade until April 2003, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We reached the conclusion that the best way to stop looting was just to get to a </p>
<p>point where there was nothing left to loot … we could either try and stop the looting, </p>
<p>in which case we would have to shoot people, or we could try and prevent it but </p>
<p>knowing that we weren’t going to prevent it and take a pragmatic view … and then </p>
<p>when we are ready we will restock it and guard it. But actually trying to interpose </p>
<p>ourselves was difficult.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Rycroft wrote to Mr McDonald on 8 April to report discussions on post-conflict </p>

<p><b>141. </b> Mr Blair had stressed to President Bush the importance of a “joint strategy for the </p>
<p>next phase” and of ensuring “legitimacy at every stage”; keeping the UN representative </p>
<p>involved would help to ensure UN endorsement.</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Discussions had also covered a US proposal for a conference to start the process </p>
<p>of establishing the IIA. Sir David Manning and Mr Blair argued for slowing down the </p>
<p>formation of the IIA to ensure that it was properly representative.</p>

<p><b>143. </b> Mr Blair emphasised the importance of having the UN involved, in order to engage </p>
<p>IFIs and bilateral donors, and to “secure our own exit”. Discussions also covered </p>
<p>whether a UN resolution, on which both sides were in principle agreed, should be an </p>
<p>“omnibus” resolution or cut into smaller slices.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Mr Straw’s suggestion that a first resolution should pass as – or shortly after – </p>
<p>the IIA was established was accepted; it would endorse the new body as legally </p>
<p>representing Iraq. Secretary Powell and Mr Straw would start the process in the relevant </p>
<p>capitals, before discussions began in New York.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the issue between the two of us there at Hillsborough was over the United </p>
<p>Nations’ role, because again America did not want the UN in. We were clear that the </p>
<p>UN had to be in, and I got a paper from the Iraq Planning Unit saying in essence  </p>
<p>that Iraq couldn’t be run by the UN and the UN didn’t want the lead role, but the  </p>
<p>UN had to have an important role, and this was raised with President Bush and </p>
<p>finally resolved.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Mr Blair also said:</p>
<p>“I can’t say there were things where I was ringing the alarm bell with President Bush </p>
<p>and he was not doing anything. On the contrary when I met him and went through </p>
<p>item by item the things that had to happen … and again his system was completely </p>
<p>resistant to this, to get the UN into Iraq, they did come in.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>147. </b> A public statement made jointly by President Bush and Mr Blair after the </p>
<p>Hillsborough meeting said:</p>
<p>“The United Nations has a vital role to play in the reconstruction of Iraq … we plan </p>
<p>to seek the adoption of new United Nations Security Council Resolutions that would </p>
<p>affirm Iraq’s territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief and </p>
<p>endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>149. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush also confirmed that:</p>
<p>“Coalition forces will remain in Iraq as long as necessary to help the Iraqi people to </p>
<p>build their own political institutions and reconstruct their country, but no longer.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“We would have liked the UN to be described as playing a leading political role with </p>
<p>the US and the UK in administering Iraq as a triumvirate. That was too much for </p>
<p>the United States and President Bush came out between his own advisers and the </p>
<p>Prime Minister in describing the role that they wanted from the UN as being vital … </p>
<p>without the Prime Minister’s input we wouldn’t have got the word ‘vital’. I think it was </p>
<p>something that President Bush, as it were, gave to the Prime Minister rather than </p>
<p>an American recognition that actually the UN would be so useful that we must make </p>
<p>sure that they are encouraged to be useful.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>151. </b> As discussions were concluding in Hillsborough, the IPU in London was raising </p>
<p>concerns about the language of Gen Franks’ proposed messages to the Iraqi people, </p>
<p>to be issued once Baghdad had fallen.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>152. </b> A further US draft of the Freedom Message had been supplied to Mr Llewellyn. </p>
<p>He commented to Ms Rose that it had “hardly changed from the one that I commented </p>
<p>on on 28 March” and observed that the new draft contained reference to the creation </p>
<p>of “a duly authorised court”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> Without agreement on the jurisdiction or power of such </p>
<p>a court this provision remained unsatisfactory.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> A note prepared by the IPU advised that references to the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority temporarily exercising the powers of government was not considered to be </p>
<p>consistent with the Hague Regulations or the Fourth Geneva Convention. The IPU </p>
<p>advised that “at a minimum” these references should be deleted if text was to be issued </p>
<p>on behalf of the Coalition as a whole.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>154. </b> On 9 April, Mr Rycroft asked for the IPU Note to be faxed to members of  </p>
<p>the NSC.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>155. </b> On 10 April, Mr Llewellyn advised the IPU that the main problem with the draft </p>
<p>Proclamation was that “political statements and legal requirements are jumbled up”.</p>

<p>157</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Cabinet met at 1000 on 10 April.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> Its discussion of the military campaign is </p>
<p>described in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Straw reported that in discussions at Hillsborough President Bush had “taken </p>
<p>a forward position on … the vital role of the United Nations in post-conflict Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Ms Short told Cabinet that “world opinion was divided over Iraq and the vindication </p>
<p>of our action would be the new Iraq which emerged”. She reported that the International </p>
<p>Committee of the Red Cross was doing an excellent humanitarian job, but was worried </p>
<p>about lawlessness and violence in Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>159. </b> In relation to political reconstruction, Mr Straw said that “the process of arriving at </p>
<p>representative government had to be respectable and legitimate. President Bush was </p>
<p>clear that exile figures were not to be parachuted in.”</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that “joint commissions would operate </p>
<p>from the bottom up to allow new Iraqi leadership to come forward”. The proposed Iraqi </p>
<p>conference was to generate discussion, after which “we would then work towards </p>
<p>establishing an Iraqi interim authority”. He reported that Mr Annan was keen for the UN </p>
<p>and the Coalition to “achieve a solution in which neither side predominated”.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Blair said that the military campaign in Iraq was </p>
<p>going extremely well, but there were challenges ahead on the humanitarian front, </p>
<p>in dealing with post-conflict arrangements and bringing together the international </p>
<p>community in the UN Security Council. Mr Blair reiterated his conclusion at the previous </p>
<p>meeting of Cabinet that making the lives of ordinary Iraqis better was key to success.</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Later on 10 April, the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR) </p>
<p>met for the first time, with Mr Straw as Chair.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> The decision to create the AHMGIR is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Ms Short, Lord Goldsmith, Mr Hoon and Ms Patricia Hewitt, Trade and Industry </p>
<p>Secretary, attended, along with senior officials from their own departments, No.10 and </p>
<p>the Treasury.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Straw briefed the meeting that:</p>
<p>“The prospects for further UN Security Council resolutions were uncertain and </p>
<p>negotiations were very likely to take weeks.”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Lord Goldsmith said that he was content for ORHA to undertake humanitarian, </p>
<p>security and public order duties and to restore civilian administration but “it must be </p>
<p>careful not to impose reform and restructuring without further legal authority”. US and </p>
<p>UK lawyers would try to agree an MOU to define how the UK would be consulted.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>158</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Straw described the meeting’s agreement that “the </p>
<p>UK should retain a right of veto in extremis” on ORHA activities. It was agreed that UK </p>
<p>support to ORHA should be increased and formalised; Mr Straw would write to Mr Blair </p>
<p>on this point.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on the evening of 10 April and welcomed the </p>
<p>fact that the IIA would not be created until after the Iraq conference.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> He underlined the </p>
<p>importance of “getting the presentation right”. Mr Blair also warmly welcomed the NSC’s </p>
<p>plans to create a “quantified baseline” of life in Iraq before the conflict so that changes </p>
<p>made by the Coalition would be visible.</p>
<p><b>168. </b> As described in Section 6.5, the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) had established  </p>
<p>a Red Team in February 2003 to provide the military Chiefs of Staff and others  </p>
<p>across Whitehall with an independent view of current intelligence assumptions and  </p>
<p>key judgements.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>169. </b> On 11 April, the Red Team published a report assessing the prospects for </p>
<p>governance in Iraq after the end of hostilities. They considered that “international </p>
<p>and regional acceptance of the IIA” would be essential, as OFF corruption scandals </p>
<p>had discredited the UN within Iraq.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> But as a result of returning waves of exiles with </p>
<p>experience of Western politics, “it may be … that serious political debate will commence </p>
<p>more quickly than expected”.</p>
<p><b>170. </b> The Red Team concluded that “the odds are probably even for the emergence </p>
<p>of a genuinely democratic society or one nominally so, but dominated by the power of </p>
<p>patronage and the military”.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The Red Team also stated that the current “lawlessness in the ‘liberated’ areas” </p>
<p>was:</p>
<p>“… exacerbated by the disappearance of the civil police and administration in some </p>
<p>towns, residual fear of the ‘shadow’ regime and the possible emergence of new </p>
<p>militias in the face of apparent Coalition compliance.”</p>
<p><b>172. </b> The Red Team judged that in the short term the “most pressing need” would be </p>
<p>for “Coalition forces to satisfy their legal obligations by restoring a peaceful and secure </p>
<p>environment”. In the medium term, they warned that there was “a real danger that where </p>
<p>there is no Coalition presence anarchy will result”.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> On 11 April, Legal Advisers to the MOD, FCO and Attorney General had a “helpful </p>
<p>interchange” by video conference with their US and Australian counterparts.</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>174. </b> A note of the discussion recorded that, on the Franks Proclamation, the US felt  </p>
<p>“a lot of our [UK] concerns have been addressed”. A new version of the Proclamation </p>
<p>used “verbs that make clear to the people of Iraqi [sic] – what is legally binding and </p>
<p>what is not”.</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Ms Rose wrote to Mr Llewellyn on 11 April to “be sure that we are all clear as to </p>
<p>the process of making comments [on ORHA proclamations and instructions] and the </p>
<p>principles which should underlie the changes we propose to the US”.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> Those principles </p>
<p>included that the document:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should not suggest it had legislative authority unless creating “Occupation type </p>
<p>offences” as allowed by the Geneva Convention;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should refer to “dissolving” not “disestablishing” the Ba’ath Party;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should not refer to the CPA exercising legislative, judicial and executive authority </p>
<p>or the powers of government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should not deny that the Coalition forces are Occupiers; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should not cut across the Joint Commission concept.</p>
<p><b>176. </b> The process for providing UK input described by Ms Rose was that Permanent </p>
<p>Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) lawyers would respond in rapid time to documents sent </p>
<p>from UK officials in theatre, but that this was “not intended to be the last word on the </p>
<p>UK’s response to the documents” and should not constrain the IPU from offering its </p>
<p>own substantive comments.</p>
<p><b>177. </b> When the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq convened on 12 April, Ms Short informed </p>
<p>attendees that “the legal issues were being managed such that British inhibitions would </p>
<p>be respected”.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>178. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, told the meeting that </p>
<p>“lawlessness was the main problem” but:</p>
<p>“The situation in Basra was being brought under control and the British division </p>
<p>intended to start joint military/[Iraqi] civil police patrols within 48 hours.”</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Mr Blair spoke by telephone to President Jacques Chirac on 12 April.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> In her </p>
<p>note of the call, Ms Liz Lloyd, Adviser to Mr Blair on Foreign Policy, recorded President </p>
<p>Chirac’s view that establishing the IIA could only be the UN’s responsibility. He had also </p>
<p>shared indications from some key international institutions that a “UN decision” was </p>
<p>necessary for them to contribute.</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Both President Chirac and President Bashar al-Assad of Syria raised the looting </p>
<p>of culturally significant sites, including museums and archaeological remains, in </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>conversations with Mr Blair on 12 April.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> Ms Lloyd commissioned a report on the looting </p>
<p>from the MOD, in consultation with the FCO.</p>
<p><b>181. </b> On 13 April, Mr Blair asked No.10 staff: “What are now the UNSCRs that we need </p>
<p>and, on the assumption we go piecemeal, in what order and within what timing?”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>182. </b> The MOD advised Mr Blair on 14 April that “UK forces will provide support to those </p>
<p>Iraqis who are trying to control the looting where they can”.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> There were signs of the </p>
<p>locals taking responsibility for their own property, and attempts by the public to stop </p>
<p>looting taking place. Advice on damage to culturally significant sites during the invasion </p>
<p>is covered in Section 6.2.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> On 14 April Mr Cannon briefed Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in Baghdad the US military were reporting “while some looting is still going on, </p>
<p>it is exaggerated by the media”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces had “announced a ‘zero tolerance’ policy for looters” in Basra, where </p>
<p>the situation was “targeted crime (e.g. bank robberies) rather than generalised </p>
<p>looting”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there were “signs of locals [in Basra] taking responsibility for [their] own property, </p>
<p>and attempts by the public to stop looters”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in Az Zubayr, looting was “reported to be in decline” and it had ceased in  </p>
<p>Al Amara.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>184. </b> In a statement on 14 April Mr Blair told the House of Commons, “the regime of </p>
<p>Saddam is gone, the bulk of Iraq is under Coalition control and the vast majority of Iraqis </p>
<p>are rejoicing at Saddam’s departure”.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> Mr Blair’s assessment of the situation in Iraq is </p>
<p>set out in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Looking ahead, Mr Blair told the House of Commons:</p>
<p>“Shortly, we shall begin formally the process of Iraq’s reconstruction. We see three </p>
<p>phases in this. In the first phase, the Coalition and the Office of Reconstruction </p>
<p>and Humanitarian Assistance will have responsibility under the Geneva and Hague </p>
<p>conventions for ensuring that Iraq’s immediate security and humanitarian needs </p>
<p>are met. The second phase, beginning a few weeks after the end of the conflict, will </p>
<p>see the establishment of a broad-based, fully representative Iraqi Interim authority. </p>
<p>Working with the UN Secretary-General, Coalition military leaders and others </p>
<p>will help the Iraqi people to identify which leaders might participate in that interim </p>

<p>authority. Once established, the interim authority will progressively assume more </p>
<p>of the functions of government. The third phase will then bring into being a fully </p>
<p>representative Iraqi government, once a new constitution has been approved, as </p>
<p>a result of elections which we hope could occur around a year after the start of the </p>
<p>interim authority.”</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Mr Blair went on to describe the need for “intense diplomacy” to rebuild </p>
<p>relationships so that the international community was able to “work together for a stable </p>
<p>and prosperous Iraq and for a peaceful middle east”.</p>
<p><b>187. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair spoke on the telephone on 14 April.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> In his report of </p>
<p>their conversation, Mr Cannon wrote that Mr Blair had advised proceeding more slowly </p>
<p>on the formation of the IIA and that this was now US policy.</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Blair had suggested that it might take a year to establish a “full Iraqi </p>
<p>government”. They discussed the approaching formal end of hostile action, and that the </p>
<p>US was awaiting legal advice on the implications of being an Occupying Power.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> On 14 April, Lieutenant General John Reith, Chief of Joint Operations, reported to </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff that:</p>
<p>“Rightly, there is a degree of pressure from within Theatre to return those forces no </p>
<p>longer gainfully employed on Op TELIC as soon as possible. But, equally we need to </p>
<p>ensure that we leave in place the correct force composition for the medium term with </p>
<p>an eye to our longer term disposition and commitment to the region.”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Lt Gen Reith anticipated the drawdown happening between April and early August, </p>
<p>by which time he expected the campaign to have reached “some form of ‘steady-state’”. </p>
<p>He explained that the intention was to draw down to nearer a medium scale of effort – </p>
<p>a divisional headquarters plus a brigade – by “autumn 2003”. That would enable the </p>
<p>UK to take on responsibility for the provinces of Basra and Maysan and, subject to </p>
<p>the availability of supporting troops from elsewhere within the Coalition, a further two </p>
<p>provinces, Dhi Qar and Wasit.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Lt Gen Reith’s detailed recommendations on the UK’s Area of Responsibility </p>
<p>(AOR), and its evolution, are described in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 15 April, Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair to propose a significant increase in UK </p>
<p>support to ORHA, as agreed by the AHMGIR on 11 April.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Straw explained that:</p>
<p>“Our lawyers are working urgently with the Americans to concert positions on the </p>
<p>legal basis for ORHA’s activity, making clear that this is essential to our longer-term </p>
<p>commitment.”</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr Straw reiterated Lord Goldsmith’s advice that the UK must be able to veto </p>
<p>ORHA activities, especially in areas controlled by UK forces. He also stated that:</p>
<p>“We would need to reconsider our involvement if the US tried to use it [ORHA] </p>
<p>to impose radical restructuring in the absence of UN authorisation.”</p>
<p><b>195. </b> The UK’s need for an MOU containing “clear ground rules” was reinforced by  </p>
<p>Mr Brenton to Mr Bellinger in Washington.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> In response to US concerns that an MOU </p>
<p>could be misinterpreted as a “secret pact”, Mr Brenton advised that “there was a real </p>
<p>political need for the MOU in London”.</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr Bellinger also observed that the US administration had not yet decided between </p>
<p>the omnibus and “smaller chunks” approaches to the new Security Council resolution.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> On 15 April, a DFID official visiting Iraq reported to Ms Short that ORHA was </p>
<p>“failing; and incapable of delivering to our timeframes”.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>198. </b> At the meeting of the AHMGIR on 16 April, Ms Short reported that a recent DFID </p>
<p>mission to consider further support for ORHA had reported “serious organisational </p>
<p>weaknesses”.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> She would discuss it with the team on their return.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> At the same meeting, Mr Hoon commissioned urgent advice on whether the UK </p>
<p>should lead one of ORHA’s regional offices.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>200. </b> Later that day, the IPU produced a note on the issue. The note again described the </p>
<p>UK’s legal concerns, including that “we might be regarded as responsible for Coalition </p>
<p>actions in areas where there are no UK forces present”.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> The IPU’s advice was to defer any commitment until the practical implications had </p>
<p>been fully understood.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry Maj Gen Cross wrote:</p>
<p>“… it had become very clear to me that there were still serious concerns relating </p>
<p>to potential political and legality issues. The only clear instructions I received </p>
<p>throughout this period therefore was that I should not commit the UK to financial </p>
<p>or any other responsibilities which might tie us into any ORHA plans.”</p>

<p><b>203. </b> Maj Gen Cross also told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I’m well aware of the debate that went on about the legality and a reluctance to be </p>
<p>seen at this stage to be endorsing ORHA or formally placing people within ORHA on </p>
<p>the basis that we, the UK, would become liable under the umbrella of international </p>
<p>law and so forth if we were a part of it. So at that stage, the correspondence that </p>

<p>IIA and its relationship with ORHA.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> The first paper set out the UK’s assumption that a national conference would be </p>
<p>needed to set up the IIA and establish constitutional review and electoral processes. The </p>
<p>paper emphasised the need for selection of representatives to be Iraqi-led. While the UK </p>
<p>wanted to set up an IIA as soon as possible, they wanted to give the process enough </p>
<p>time to make the Iraqi people feel they had been properly consulted. The key tasks for </p>
<p>the so called “Baghdad conference” were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish the IIA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>set up processes for the review of the Constitution; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>create processes for the preparation of elections.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The first paper stated that the way in which members of the IIA would be selected </p>
<p>was crucial, arguing that the individuals needed to be technocrats with no political </p>
<p>affiliations, and suggesting ways in which the conference could appoint IIA members. </p>
<p>The second paper set out the process the UK envisaged would be used to form a new </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>209. </b> During their conversation, Mr Blair described to Mr Annan a three stage process </p>
<p>for post-conflict Iraq. First, ORHA would stabilise Iraq and start work on the basic </p>
<p>infrastructure. Second, the Iraqi-run IIA should progressively assume responsibility from </p>
<p>ORHA. Third, after a constitutional process and elections, a full Iraqi Government would </p>
<p>be set up.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Blair was clear that the UK wanted the UN to be part of the process at each </p>
<p>stage, and that each stage should progress as quickly as possible to the next. There </p>
<p>was discussion of the need for a strategic vision, including of the role for a UN Special </p>
<p>Representative, and a future UN role. Mr Annan was explicit that he was not arguing for </p>
<p>a UN lead.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Blair sought Mr Annan’s advice on future process within the UN and  </p>
<p>was advised that the Security Council accepted that initially the Coalition would be in </p>
<p>charge.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thereafter, a resolution (or a series of smaller resolutions) would be necessary </p>
<p>to define the UN’s role in the political process and in reconstruction. This required  </p>
<p>careful handling.</p>
<p><b>212. </b> Commenting on the discussion, Mr Rycroft wrote: “In our view it should be </p>
<p>possible, now that Bush has accepted that the UN should have a vital role, for the  </p>
<p>UN system to start to become involved on the ground in a way that helps to define </p>
<p>its future role.”</p>
<p><b>213. </b> By 16 April, the UK had produced a draft MOU and sent it to the US and Australia </p>
<p>for comment. Ms Adams showed a copy to Lord Goldsmith, observing that it could be </p>
<p>made more effective by establishing precisely how consultation would work.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> She also </p>
<p>reported “indications that the US may be getting cold feet”, based on concern that if it </p>
<p>reached the public domain the MOU may be seen as “carving up Iraq in a colonial way”.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Reporting discussion at the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 17 April, Ms Short told </p>
<p>DFID officials that Mr Blair had directed that “if ORHA was going to be big, we should  </p>
<p>be in it”.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Minutes of the meeting record that Mr Blair asked for quick action on the  </p>
<p>UK’s contribution, insisting “there should be no bureaucratic hold up in sorting out  </p>
<p>this priority”.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Rycroft wrote to Mr McDonald on 17 April to convey Mr Blair’s strong agreement </p>
<p>to proposals for increased support for ORHA.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> Mr Blair felt that “as a general rule, our </p>
<p>role in humanitarian aid and in the reconstruction of Iraq should be commensurate with </p>
<p>our contribution to the military phase”. That was to include “British officials … present </p>

<p><b>218. </b> On 16 April, Gen Franks issued his ‘Freedom Message to the Iraqi People’.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>message stated:</p>
<p>“Our stay in Iraq will be temporary, no longer than it takes to eliminate the threat </p>
<p>posed by Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, and to establish stability </p>
<p>and help Iraqis form a functioning government that respects the rule of law and </p>
<p>reflects the will, interests, and rights of the people of Iraq.</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, it is essential that Iraq have an authority to protect lives and property, </p>
<p>and expedite the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those who need it. </p>
<p>Therefore, I am creating the Coalition Provisional Authority to exercise powers of </p>
<p>government temporarily, and as necessary, especially to provide security, to allow </p>
<p>the delivery of humanitarian aid and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Gen Franks’ Freedom Message also contained the first public statement about the </p>
<p>treatment of the Ba’ath Party:</p>
<p>“The Arab Socialist Renaissance Party of Iraq (Hizb al-Ba’ath al-Arabi al-Ishtiraki  </p>
<p>al-Iraqi) is hereby disestablished. Property of the Ba’ath Party should be turned </p>
<p>over to the Coalition Provisional Authority. The records of the Ba’ath Party are an </p>
<p>important part of the records of the Government of Iraq and should be preserved. </p>
<p>All those with custody of the records of the Ba’ath Party or the Government of Iraq </p>
<p>should … turn them over to the Coalition Provisional Authority.”</p>
<p><b>220. </b> The policy of de-Ba’athification and its implications is considered in Section 11.</p>
<p><b>US force levels</b></p>
<p>Gen Franks issued orders on 16 April to withdraw US war-fighting units within 60 days and </p>
<p>to use the incoming US forces for only up to 120 days, reducing the US military presence </p>
<p>in Iraq from 175,000 troops to 30,000 by the start of August.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez, Commander of Combined Joint Task Force – 7 from </p>
<p>15 June (see Box, ‘US command structures and the SBMR-I’), recalled that Gen Franks </p>
<p>“explicitly stated that military leaders should take as much risk coming out of Iraq as we </p>
<p>did going in – which meant that we were going to try to get by with the smallest number  </p>
<p>of ground troops possible”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>The figure of 30,000 contrasts with what was understood in PJHQ in late April, when </p>
<p>Gen Reith reported that Gen Franks had told him that he still expected the US “to have </p>
<p>to provide between 120,000 and 150,000” personnel.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>At around the same time as Gen Franks’ order, Mr Donald Rumsfeld (US Secretary of </p>
<p>Defense) cancelled the deployment of a further 50,000 combat troops who had been </p>
<p>scheduled to arrive in Iraq shortly.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>According to <i>Hard Lessons</i>:</p>
<p>“Rumsfeld’s decision shocked some commanders on the ground, including Coalition </p>
<p>Forces Land Component Commander Lieutenant General David McKiernan, who </p>
<p>were counting on the additional manpower to provide a secure environment for </p>
<p>post-conflict stabilization.”</p>
<p>Lt Gen Sanchez’s view was that “overall, the concurrence of Franks’ drawdown orders and </p>
<p>Rumsfeld’s … directive created havoc throughout the forces … Confusion was the order </p>
<p>of the day”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>Earlier in 2003, giving evidence to the US Senate Armed Services Committee, </p>
<p>General Eric Shinseki, Chief of Staff of the US Army, had commented that, in his view, any </p>
<p>Occupation of Iraq would require “several hundred thousand” troops.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>At the time, Gen Shinseki’s comment was dismissed publicly by the Pentagon, and </p>
<p>Mr Paul Wolfowitz, US Deputy Secretary of Defense, told the US House of Representatives’ </p>
<p>Budget Committee that the number was “wildly off the mark” and that the figure was closer </p>
<p>to 100,000.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p>In his account of his time in Iraq, Ambassador L Paul Bremer recalls having been shown  </p>
<p>a draft report prior to his deployment to Iraq which suggested that, for a population </p>
<p>the size of Iraq, around 500,000 ground troops would be required for the stabilisation </p>
<p>operation. This was “more than three times the number of foreign troops now deployed to </p>
<p>Iraq”.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> Ambassador Bremer sent a copy of the report to Secretary Rumsfeld, but did not </p>
<p>receive a reply.</p>
<p><b>221. </b> The issue of deploying the Headquarters of NATO’s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps </p>
<p>(ARRC) to Iraq was first raised as a possibility after the invasion in mid-April.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office explained to No.10:</p>

<p>to attempt to run HQs in Iraq at Corps, Divisional and Brigade levels simultaneously </p>
<p>would be, to say the least, a very ambitious undertaking. It is unlikely (at best) in </p>
<p>these circumstances that we could command at Divisional level more than one </p>
<p>brigade in addition to our own, and this would limit the number of provinces we could </p>
<p>supervise. Even then, recuperating from such an effort would be a major challenge, </p>
<p>and it would be years before the Armed Forces recovered the ‘steady state’ </p>
<p>capability which our planning assumptions say they should provide. Finally, we could </p>
<p>not enter into such a commitment without having absolute certainty about who would </p>
<p>replace us and when.”</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>The Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC)</b></p>
<p>The ARRC is a ready-formed and trained HQ, commanded by a three-star officer, which </p>
<p>can deploy within five to 30 days.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> It was created in 1992 in Germany as an operational </p>
<p>HQ. It does not have fighting capability, but its approximately 1,000 staff are able to </p>
<p>command up to four multi-national divisions (around 100,000 personnel). The ARRC is </p>
<p>able to deploy the communications systems necessary for a command role of this size, </p>
<p>and the support services needed to take care of its own personnel.</p>
<p>The UK is the ‘framework’ or lead nation for the ARRC and provides around 60 percent of </p>
<p>its staff; other members of NATO provide the remaining 40 percent. To deploy the ARRC </p>
<p>without NATO staff, the UK would need to backfill those posts.</p>
<p>The ARRC is deployable once every two to three years. Its first deployment was to Bosnia </p>
<p>in December 1995.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> Major General Adrian Bradshaw, who succeeded Major General Graham Binns as </p>
<p>Commander of 7 Armoured Brigade, told the Inquiry “things were relatively calm” when </p>
<p>he first arrived in Iraq in April 2003 but “it was clear that we had an urgent task to rebuild </p>
<p>security structures”.</p>

<p><b>224. </b> At the request of the FCO, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) provided an </p>

<p> In it the JIC  </p>
<p>judged that:</p>
<p>“The situation in Iraq is complex, fast-moving and confused. In the very near term, </p>
<p>remnants of the regime will continue to present a limited threat to the  </p>
<p>re-establishment of peace and stability in Iraq. But other threats to either Coalition </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>225. </b> The Assessment said that:</p>
<p>“There has been jubilation at the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime. But we judge </p>
<p>that this is likely to dissipate quickly. Most of the Iraqi population is ambivalent about </p>
<p>the role of the Coalition and uncertain about the future. Initial reporting shows that </p>
<p>concerns arise quickly about the break-down of law and order and the need for </p>
<p>food and water. Some pre-war reports suggested that the Iraqi population has high, </p>
<p>perhaps exaggerated, hopes that the Coalition will rapidly improve their lives by </p>
<p>improving their access to clean drinking water, electricity and sanitation. However, </p>
<p>even without any war damage, there are severe shortfalls in the infrastructure of </p>
<p>these sectors, and in healthcare. Looting has made matters worse.</p>
<p>“Initial Iraqi responses to the Coalition will be on a local basis. There is no sign yet of </p>
<p>widespread popular support for opposition to the Coalition. We judge that, at least in </p>
<p>the short term, the details of the post-Saddam political process will be less important </p>
<p>for many Iraqis than a restoration of internal security and the start of reconstruction. </p>
<p>But the Iraqi population will blame the Coalition if progress is slow. Resentment of </p>
<p>the Coalition also could grow quickly if it is seen to be ineffective, either politically or </p>
<p>militarily. Such resentment could lead to violence. But we judge that at present there </p>
<p>is no Iraqi social or political structure which could co-ordinate it.”</p>
<p><b>226. </b> In the same document the JIC updated its pre-invasion assessment of the role </p>
<p>of Al Qaida (AQ) within Iraq:</p>
<p>“… intelligence shows that AQ-associated extremists are now in Baghdad, but </p>
<p>we remain uncertain as to their role. We judge that AQ’s aspirations to conduct </p>
<p>anti-western attacks remain undiminished.”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> In its final report on 18 April the Red Team wrote that:</p>
<p>“The initial surge of lawlessness seen since the fall of the major Iraqi cities is likely </p>
<p>to be a short-term phenomenon. The re-engagement of most of the former regime </p>
<p>police force personnel in the immediate future will, along with the use of Coalition </p>
<p>troops, re-establish law and order on the streets.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>228. </b> The Red Team also wrote that there was “an immediate requirement to re-institute </p>
<p>the rule of law”.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> A JIC Assessment of 30 April addressed the post-war threat from international </p>
<p>terrorism.</p>
<p>122</p>

<p>“Outside the gates of the Republican Palace where ORHA was trying to set up shop, </p>

<p>129</p>
<p> The briefing </p>
<p>explained that, of the 3,500 troops who would return, about 1,500 personnel were due </p>
<p>to redeploy to Iraq as part of future Phase IV operations; a further 1,000 were “required </p>
<p>in the UK as soon as possible for other reasons”; and a further 1,000 were “staff officers </p>

<p><b>238. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary commented that, although Mr Hoon had been told </p>
<p>about the proposed drawdown “in very broad outline” in an earlier briefing:</p>
<p>“… what is now proposed involves an acceleration by about a week and a </p>

<p><b>241. </b> At the same meeting of the AHMGIR, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff, told attendees that US plans were to divide Iraq into five sectors. The </p>
<p>UK would lead one sector, comprising four provinces in southeastern Iraq. This would </p>
<p>be “manageable … provided that other countries offered troops to work with us” and </p>
<p>the UK could take on a fifth province “if others contributed the necessary forces for it”. </p>
<p>The southern region of ORHA would follow the boundaries of the UK’s sector.</p>

<p><b>242. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Powell spoke by telephone on 24 April.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> The latter </p>
<p>explained that US thinking was to combine two draft resolutions – “one on principles </p>
<p>and the other on lifting sanctions” – into one: “The market appeared able to bear that.” </p>
<p>A combined resolution might be tabled the following week, but more work was needed </p>
<p>in advance to align the US, UK and Spanish positions.</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Cannon on 25 April that:</p>
<p>“… we have seen a new draft US omnibus resolution on post-conflict Iraq that takes </p>
<p>no account of our recent bilateral discussions and would be unnegotiable in the </p>
<p>Security Council.”</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The draft included endorsement for the Coalition’s presence in Iraq, the </p>
<p>appointment of a UN Special Co-ordinator, lifting of sanctions and establishing the IIA. </p>
<p>The FCO observed that “many of its details will be highly controversial” and suggested </p>
<p>that Mr Cannon raise the UK’s issues with the text with Dr Rice.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Straw had spoken to Secretary Powell earlier that day.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> He told Secretary </p>
<p>Powell that “Greenstock’s view was that the latest US draft SCR [Security Council </p>
<p>resolution] would run into the buffers”, and added that he shared that view. Mr Straw </p>
<p>continued: “We needed this resolution in a way that we had not needed the second </p>
<p>resolution.” That was why the UK had proposed tackling the issues one by one. He </p>
<p>promised to send Secretary Powell, who had not been persuaded that the prospects for </p>
<p>the resolution were poor, a note detailing UK concerns with the omnibus US draft.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported to Sir David Manning on 25 April that </p>
<p>Mr Straw had raised concerns with Secretary Powell about rumours that the US was </p>
<p>planning to appoint a group of Iraqi exiles as the IIA.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> Secretary Powell said he would </p>
<p>look into it.</p>
<p><b>247. </b> The Private Secretary also reported that “we hear from ORHA that Garner has </p>
<p>invited … five prominent ‘free Iraqi’ politicians to form the core of the interim Iraqi </p>
<p>authority”. The UK remained of the view that this would provoke an adverse reaction.</p>
<p><b>248. </b> On 25 April, Mr Ricketts reported to Sir Paul Lever, British Ambassador to </p>
<p>Germany, on a dinner attended by Mr Straw, Mr Joschka Fischer, the German Foreign </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>249. </b> Discussion had been dominated by Iraq, and Mr Straw had explained UK  </p>
<p>priorities as:</p>
<p>“… having extended OFF, building up Security Council consensus for a heavyweight </p>
<p>UN Special Representative, and tackling the range of issues linked to suspension of </p>
<p>sanctions. On the question of supervising oil revenues, one possibility would be the </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General. Another could be the World Bank before a genuine IIA could </p>
<p>take this on.”</p>
<p><b>250. </b> Mr de Villepin had responded that he could only envisage the UN overseeing oil </p>
<p>sales with any credibility.</p>
<p><b>251. </b> A further US draft of the Phase IV resolution was sent by Mr Bellinger to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning on 28 April.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> Its text included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Endorsement of the CPA’s role in administering Iraq, including the destruction </p>
<p>of WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A request that the UN appoint a Special Co-ordinator to co-ordinate </p>
<p>humanitarian and reconstruction activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support for an Iraqi-led process for creating the IIA, helped by the CPA and </p>
<p>working with the Special Co-ordinator.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Creation of an Iraqi Development Fund, to be used by the CPA, and the transfer </p>
<p>of unspent OFF programme funds into it.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The resumption of oil sales at market price, with all proceeds deposited in the </p>
<p>Iraqi Development Fund.</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Sir David Manning and Dr Rice spoke on the afternoon of 28 April.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Sir David reported to Mr McDonald that he said “we were pretty clear here that the </p>
<p>omnibus text as currently drafted was non-negotiable in New York”.</p>
<p><b>254. </b> A further US draft was promised the following day, drafted so that it could </p>
<p>be broken into separate components if necessary, and it was agreed that a video </p>
<p>conference with “the experts to hand” would be arranged “to discuss the whole gamut </p>
<p>of UN issues”.</p>
<p><b>255. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by telephone during the evening of 28 April.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Mr Blair indicated that he was still considering the UN angle; an omnibus resolution </p>
<p>would be fine if achievable, but if not the focus should be on areas where progress could </p>
<p>be made. Mr Blair said that the Coalition “did not want to be the supplicants, just to </p>
<p>obtain the maximum UN cover without jeopardizing the Coalition’s achievements”.</p>

<p>173</p>
<p><b>257. </b> A consultative conference took place in Baghdad on 28 April.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> It was not the </p>
<p>“Baghdad Conference” to create the IIA that the UK had envisaged.</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Mr Mike O’Brien, FCO Minister of State for the Middle East, and Mr Chilcott </p>
<p>attended for the UK. Mr O’Brien reported that the US had its own vision of how the IIA </p>
<p>would shape up and wanted as little as possible to come out of the conference itself. </p>
<p>The real political process would begin after the conference when Mr Zalmay Khalilzad, </p>
<p>US Ambassador at Large for Free Iraqis, was due to meet with prominent Iraqi political </p>
<p>leaders. These meetings were likely to frame the shape and composition of the IIA. </p>
<p>The UK was not in the loop. Mr O’Brien attributed that to the UK’s failure to have </p>
<p>someone sufficiently senior working with the US in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>259. </b> In his report to Mr Straw, Mr O’Brien referred to ORHA as “the only game in town” </p>
<p>and recommended that a senior UK official should be posted to it in Baghdad to take an </p>
<p>active role in policy formation.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Mr O’Brien’s Assistant Private Secretary separately reported a meeting between </p>
<p>Mr O’Brien and Air Marshal Brian Burridge, the UK National Contingent Commander who </p>
<p>was collocated with CENTCOM in Qatar, whilst the former was in transit to Baghdad.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported that:</p>
<p>“Burridge thought ORHA as an organisation was … flawed – it was random, erratic, </p>
<p>slow and lacked both cultural awareness and structural planning. However he </p>
<p>acknowledged that it was the only show in town and that we had to work with it, </p>
<p>regardless of its faults.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> RAND</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> assessed in 2008 that:</p>
<p>“The possibility of a quick transfer to Iraqi governance remained in play in the </p>
<p>immediate aftermath of the regime’s fall. Although Garner told Kurdish leaders … </p>
<p>that they would not be allowed to set up an interim government, he made a number </p>
<p>of statements that appeared to downplay ORHA’s central role in the governance </p>
<p>of Iraq … The consultations … appeared to be the first two steps of three to the </p>
<p>formation of a temporary Iraqi government … the 300 representatives at the </p>
<p>Baghdad Conference … called for another, larger conference in a month’s time to </p>
<p>select the postwar transitional government.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>262. </b> In a statement to Parliament at the end of April, Mr Hoon announced that:</p>
<p>“Decisive combat operations in Iraq are now complete, and Coalition forces are </p>
<p>increasingly focusing upon stabilisation tasks. It will therefore be possible to make </p>
<p>further force level adjustments over the coming weeks while continuing to meet our </p>
<p>responsibilities to the Iraqi people.”</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>263. </b> In addition to the substantial withdrawal of Royal Navy and Royal Air Force </p>
<p>personnel and many of the Army war-fighting units, Mr Hoon explained that he had </p>
<p>extended the tour of one unit to enable it “to continue in their key role of ensuring </p>
<p>security in the region of Az Zubayr”. He concluded that:</p>
<p>“While details continue to be clarified, we envisage that by mid-May 25,000-30,000 </p>
<p>UK Service personnel will remain deployed in the Gulf region, continuing to fulfil our </p>
<p>responsibilities towards the Iraqi people. The planned replacement of forces is clear </p>
<p>evidence of our commitment to them.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to leave an Iraq that is confident, secure and fully integrated with the </p>
<p>international community. The planning process to establish the precise level of  </p>
<p>the continuing UK presence needed to achieve this aim is a dynamic one, and </p>
<p>is kept under review. We will also need to take account of the contributions of  </p>
<p>Coalition partners. We will continue to withdraw assets and personnel from the </p>
<p>region where possible, but we will maintain an appropriate military presence for  </p>
<p>as long as necessary.”</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr Straw, Sir David Manning and Foreign Office officials discussed the draft </p>
<p>post-conflict resolution by video conference with Secretary Powell and Dr Rice on </p>
<p>30 April.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>265. </b> It was agreed that the text:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should recognise the Coalition as Occupying Powers, but not endorse military </p>
<p>action after the fact;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>should reiterate President Bush’s commitment to a vital role for the UN; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>need not make reference to UNMOVIC, which could be added later as part of </p>
<p>the negotiation process.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> The US and UK held different views on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UN Special Co-ordinator should lead the formation of the IIA; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the UN or the CPA should have control of oil revenue, and for how long </p>
<p>the OFF programme should continue.</p>

<p><b>269. </b> It also recorded separate US and UK language on who would control the Iraqi </p>

<p><b>270. </b> A further video conference, with similar attendees to the last, was held on 1 May.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>271. </b> Mr Straw told participants that the UK had a “generic problem” with references to </p>
<p>the CPA, and would prefer to be referred to as “Occupying Power” because “references </p>
<p>to the CPA provided an unnecessary opportunity for dispute in the Security Council”.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> A detailed discussion of drafting points followed, at the end of which there </p>

<p>berets and no flak jackets. We walked down the markets in Basra, berets and no flak </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>US command structures and the SBMR-I</b></p>
<p>The end of combat operations led to a change in the US command structure and military </p>
<p>headquarters within Iraq. According to <i>Hard Lessons</i>:</p>
<p><i>“</i>By May 1, 2003, CENTCOM had dismantled its forward command-and-control </p>
<p>center in Qatar. Two weeks later, the Defense Department announced that </p>
<p>Lt Gen McKiernan’s command would soon leave Iraq and that his large headquarters </p>
<p>would be replaced by a much smaller Combined Joint Task Force 7 (CJTF-7), led by </p>
<p>Lt Gen Sanchez.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>Lt Gen Sanchez arrived in Baghdad on 8 May and formally assumed command of CJTF-7 </p>
<p>on 15 June.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> As well as having a significantly smaller headquarters, he was also newly </p>
<p>promoted to this level of command, in contrast to his more experienced – and senior – </p>
<p>predecessor (Lt Gen McKiernan) and successor (General George Casey). The reporter </p>
<p>Mr Bob Woodward commented that Lt Gen Sanchez was the most “junior three-star </p>
<p>general in the [US] Army. He had been given America’s most important ground command </p>
<p>and had a small and inexperienced staff.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>In his memoir, Lt Gen Sanchez described the removal of the Coalition Forces Land </p>
<p>Component Command headquarters staff as:</p>
<p>“… another monumental blunder that created significant strategic risk for America </p>
<p>… the foreseeable consequences were daunting. In country, we would no longer </p>
<p>have the staff-level capacities for strategic- or operational-level campaign planning, </p>
<p>policy, and intelligence. All such situational awareness and institutional memory </p>
<p>would be gone with the departure of the best available Army officers who had been </p>
<p>assigned to CFLCC for the ground war. The entire array of established linkages </p>
<p>was dismantled and redeployed. Furthermore, V Corps had no coalition operations </p>
<p>and ORHA/CPA-related staff capacity, which were departing the theater with </p>
<p>CFLCC just at a time when the coalition and civilian administrator support missions </p>
<p>were dramatically expanding.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>Lt Gen Sanchez observed that his headquarters had remained staffed at less than </p>
<p>60 percent of its required staffing levels (1,000) for the majority of his time in Iraq and </p>
<p>commented that:</p>
<p>“With both CENTCOM and CFLCC leaving Iraq, V Corps was going to have to </p>
<p>operate at the theater strategic level, for which it possessed no expertise, as well </p>
<p>as the operational and tactical level across the country. Unfortunately, neither </p>
<p>CENTCOM nor CFLCC was planning to provide any help to accomplish that task.”</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>From July 2003, a senior UK military officer was deployed in Baghdad, in the dual role of </p>
<p>Deputy Commanding General within the Coalition military command and Senior British </p>
<p>Military Representative, Iraq (SBMR-I).</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>This position, which existed until the eventual withdrawal of British troops from Iraq in </p>
<p>July 2009, was initially filled by Major General Freddie Viggers, who served from May to </p>
<p>September 2003.</p>
<p>Maj Gen Viggers reported to the Commander of CJTF-7, Lt Gen Sanchez; his reporting </p>
<p>lines back to the UK ran directly to Gen Walker and Gen Reith.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>CJTF-7 did not fall under Ambassador Bremer’s control. Lt Gen Viggers explained to the </p>
<p>Inquiry that the post was not based physically within the Corps headquarters but rather “it </p>
<p>was the military element of the Coalition Provisional Authority”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“My focus was on the military aspects of the reconstruction Plan being delivered </p>
<p>by the CPA … My task was to provide the link between military HQ in the CPA </p>
<p>and the heads of various civil functions in the CPA. There was a separate Deputy </p>
<p>Commander for Operations in the CJTF-7 HQ … who was based in Corps HQ … </p>
<p>I provided military advice and information to the British Ambassadors … inside the </p>
<p>CPA … I worked closely with Ambassador Bremer’s Chief of Staff … and with the </p>
<p>key players involved in security functions, especially Walt Slocombe (responsible </p>
<p>for building the new Iraqi Army) and with Bernard Kerik (responsible for building the </p>
<p>Iraqi police).”</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Although the SBMR-I did not command the majority of UK troops within Iraq, he did have </p>
<p>command responsibility for the small number of UK military staff based in Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> On 1 May, Cabinet was told that British troops had done an excellent job in </p>
<p>restoring security in the South of Iraq.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> The problem was now one of criminality which </p>
<p>did not require British troops on the streets but rather police officers and a judicial </p>
<p>process. Persisting in patrolling with foreign troops “was not a good idea”.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> Summing up the meeting, Mr Blair said that “little time had elapsed since the fall </p>
<p>of the Iraqi regime and much progress had been made”.</p>
<p><b>277. </b> On 1 May, a brief sent by Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Mr Rycroft said:</p>
<p>“While ORHA has our broad support, it is not yet delivering in Iraq. It is too narrowly </p>
<p>controlled by the Pentagon, and continues to lack proper strategic direction, the </p>
<p>necessary grasp of cultural issues in Baghdad, and the requisite capabilities to make </p>
<p>a rapid difference on the ground. In being encouraging of ORHA, we are counselling </p>
<p>care against the Coalition appearing to appoint an Iraqi government.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the Oil-for-Food programme, which was extended for just three months in the </p>
<p>expectation that an IIA would be operating by this point; and</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>On 14 May, officials advised members of the AHMGIR that:</p>
<p>“The US administration has appointed Paul Bremer as special representative, to bring </p>
<p>order to ORHA and improve co-ordination with the US political track led by Khalilzad. </p>
<p>John Sawers is working closely with Bremer. General Cross continues to work with </p>
<p>Garner, who is unlikely to stay long.”</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that the papers which meant “Bremer was now CPA” were </p>
<p>signed by Secretary Rumsfeld on 14 May.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>The names ‘ORHA’ and ‘CPA’ continued to be used interchangeably in documents seen </p>
<p>by the Inquiry for some time after Ambassador Bremer’s appointment.</p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr Sawers’ appointment as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq </p>
<p>was announced to Parliament on 6 May by Mr Straw, who said that:</p>
<p>“Mr Sawers will work alongside Chris Segar, head of the newly opened British Office </p>
<p>in Baghdad, particularly in relation to the political process and our work in the Office </p>
<p>of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Mr Sawers arrived in Baghdad on 7 May.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> The deployment of Mr Segar and his </p>
<p>team is described in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>286. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that, although he was “the senior Brit on the </p>
<p>ground” he was not Ambassador Bremer’s deputy nor was he in the line management </p>
<p>chain of the CPA. Rather, he was a representative of the British Government and so his </p>
<p>role was one of “exerting influence rather than exercising power”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> The UK was not </p>
<p>contributing very much to ORHA when he arrived, having just a handful of advisers, </p>
<p>and was not providing funding, all of which was coming from the US.</p>
<p><b>287. </b> Sir John told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I felt I was in a reasonably strong position to exercise influence. There were a range </p>
<p>of areas where I was able to exercise influence in those months, but I didn’t seek </p>
<p>and I wasn’t given a veto or decision-making power on CPA issues; those decisions </p>
<p>rested with Bremer, he was the one who had the authority from the President of the </p>
<p>United States, which was the leader of the Coalition.”</p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr Straw told Secretary Powell that he saw Mr Sawers’ role as “similar to Zal </p>
<p>Khalilzad”: the UK thought it essential to have “someone handling the politics and also </p>
<p>keeping an eye on ORHA, on the ground”.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> Mr Straw passed on the observations about </p>
<p>ORHA made by Mr O’Brien, and Secretary Powell offered a similar assessment.</p>

<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>289. </b> On 6 May, Mr Michael Wood, FCO Legal Adviser, wrote to Mr Chilcott arguing that </p>
<p>the Freedom Message appeared to create the CPA to exercise powers of government, </p>
<p>but the UK had no idea what the CPA comprised and what its legislative, executive and </p>
<p>judicial authority was.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Mr Wood was unclear what the CPA was: “Is it ORHA? Is it a combination of ORHA </p>
<p>and General Franks? Where does the future Iraqi Interim Authority fit?”</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Mr Wood identified a number of examples within the Freedom Message and the </p>
<p>accompanying instructions to the Iraqi people that raised issues under international </p>
<p>humanitarian law.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> Mr Wood also highlighted that analysis of the Freedom Message suggested that </p>
<p>armed conflict in Iraq had ended and therefore that prisoners of war should be released. </p>
<p>This appeared to contrast with another section of the Message, which said prisoners </p>
<p>should be held pending CPA orders. Mr Wood wrote:</p>
<p>“This means that it is possible that, within the UK’s area of control, prisoners whose </p>
<p>prison sentence comes to an end may be held beyond the lawful date of their </p>
<p>release. This would almost certainly be contrary to Article 5 ECHR.”</p>
<p><b>293. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Sir Michael Wood explained:</p>
<p>“FCO legal advisers were concerned to avoid the UK being held jointly responsible </p>
<p>for acts or omissions of the CPA, without a right to consult and a right of joint </p>
<p>decision. A particular concern was if those acts went beyond the powers of an </p>
<p>Occupying Power under the general law of Occupation or under the SCRs … The </p>
<p>aim was to have matters such as the territorial extent of the UK’s Occupation rights </p>
<p>and responsibilities, the extent of its potential responsibility for acts and omissions of </p>
<p>the CPA, and the UK’s role within the CPA (especially joint decision-making) set out </p>
<p>in a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Americans.”</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>294. </b> The next US draft of the post-conflict resolution was sent to Mr Rycroft and Sir </p>
<p>David Manning on 6 May.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Text on the UN’s role in establishing the IIA and on oil sales remained unchanged; </p>
<p>the extension of the OFF programme had been increased by a month, to a total of four </p>
<p>months.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>297. </b> No.10 officials commented that “the atmospherics at this video conference were </p>
<p>poorer than at previous discussions in this series”. They had agreed changes to make </p>
<p>reference to the “Occupying Power” rather than solely to the CPA, and to include </p>
<p>monitoring, as well as auditing, of oil sales. Agreement could not be reached on the </p>
<p>description of the UN’s role in the political process or on extending OFF further.</p>
<p><b>298. </b> The draft resolution was updated the same day.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> It continued to reflect US views </p>
<p>on the UN’s role in establishing the IIA, the control of oil proceeds (now designated the </p>
<p>Iraqi Assistance Fund) and the continuation of the OFF programme.</p>
<p><b>299. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that in the process of reaching agreement </p>
<p>on the objectives for the resolution:</p>
<p>“… there were nuances between London and Washington … We could see, rather </p>
<p>as was the case in Resolution 1441 … the United States was setting the bar quite </p>
<p>high in terms of what it wanted from the United Nations … they wanted the situation </p>
<p>of the United States leading the Coalition with a unilateral decision-making capability </p>
<p>for that Coalition with the United States very much the largest member of it, with the </p>
<p>United Nations endorsing that situation and coming in with its ancillary services to </p>
<p>help deal with the territory … we went through a minor version of the same process </p>
<p>as 1441, where we had to scale Washington’s more unilateral ambitions back down </p>
<p>to something that was negotiable within the Security Council. The Security Council </p>
<p>… had, as always, a range of opinions, with the Russians in particular being very </p>
<p>clear that they would not allow any resolution to pass that appeared to legitimise </p>
<p>in any way what had already happened.”</p>
<p>184</p>

<p>185</p>
<p><b>301. </b> They discussed taking a firm line in the Security Council; if NATO and the UN </p>
<p>became involved, others would be drawn in. Mr Blair added that their involvement would </p>
<p>also provide an exit strategy.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> Mr Blair commented that ORHA “must grip the nuts and bolts of reconstruction, </p>
<p>not just focus on politics”.</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Mr Ricketts wrote to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary on 7 May, with a ‘Diplomatic </p>

<p><b>305. </b> Sir David Manning spoke to Dr Rice on the same day, and reported that she </p>
<p>“was broadly happy with our strategy for deploying it [the draft resolution] among the </p>

<p><b>306. </b> Following a conversation between Mr Straw and Secretary Powell, a UK draft of </p>
<p>text which referred to “some form of international verification” was faxed to the US.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Mr Straw told Sir David Manning that the absence of any reference to the United </p>
<p>Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) inspectors in </p>
<p>the text of the omnibus resolution meant “we were very exposed on the question of why </p>
<p>UNMOVIC was not on the bus”.</p>

<p><b>309. </b> On 8 May, Mr McDonald reported that Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that </p>

<p> Secretary Powell also told Mr Straw that US officials were </p>

<p>in stolen Iraqi artefacts. He added that “No legitimisation of the Coalition military action </p>
<p>was required, although some countries feared that we sought such cover.”</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Mr Blair said that the draft text was “offered as a solution to the way forward on </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that following progress in Iraq and on </p>
<p>the MEPP “the question was how the Arab world itself would develop, shorn of its most </p>
<p>brutal dictatorship”.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Later that day, Mr Straw told the AHMGIR that a draft resolution had been agreed, </p>
<p>and “the text was satisfactory”.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>314. </b> An unidentified member of the AHMGIR observed that since there had been no </p>
<p>success in negotiating an MOU, the UK “must therefore be particularly careful to ensure </p>
<p>that we had legal cover for our efforts”.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> The AHMGIR was told that Mr Sawers had been appointed as UK Special </p>
<p>Representative and would work closely with “ORHA and the new US Representative, </p>
<p>Bremer, on the political process”.</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock and Ambassador Negroponte wrote jointly to the President </p>
<p>of the Security Council on 8 May.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Sir Jeremy explained to the Inquiry that the letter “described what we were doing </p>
<p>in administering Iraq and what our intentions were”.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>318. </b> An earlier draft of the letter had implied that Gen Franks was the entirety of the </p>
<p>CPA, which led Mr Straw to protest to Secretary Powell that “although Franks may be </p>
<p>Supreme Commander, we had our responsibilities too”.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>319. </b> The joint letter began by stating that the US and UK and their Coalition partners </p>
<p>continued to act together to ensure the complete disarmament of Iraq of WMD in </p>
<p>accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> It went on to say that the Coalition:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>would abide strictly by their obligations under international law;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>would act to ensure that Iraq’s oil was protected and used for the benefit of the </p>
<p>Iraqi people;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “created the Coalition Provisional Authority, which includes the Office of </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA), to exercise powers </p>
<p>of government temporarily, and … especially to provide security, to allow the </p>
<p>delivery of humanitarian aid, and to eliminate weapons of mass destruction”;</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Writing to Mr Ricketts, Mr Brenton recorded a US view of the UK as “driven by </p>
<p>a wish to be attentive to the concerns of the UN, the French and the Russians”.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a result he concluded that “we are going to have to be careful as the Security Council </p>
<p>negotiation proceeds, not to uselessly expend the huge credit we have built up with the </p>
<p>US over the past few months”.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> After visiting Paris and Berlin to discuss the resolution, Mr Ricketts reported on  </p>
<p>9 May a “desire in both capitals to co-operate and find solutions. Neither seemed to see </p>
<p>insuperable difficulties with the draft.”</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>328. </b> Gen Jackson visited Iraq from 7 to 10 May.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“The situation in the UK AOR is dramatically different from that further north and </p>
<p>in particular in Baghdad for understandable reasons … The ethnic and political </p>
<p>environment in southern Iraq has facilitated our role … These almost exclusively </p>
<p>Shia provinces have been persecuted for almost 20 years, driven to living in </p>
<p>miserable conditions, repressed by the regime … A security vacuum still exists …  </p>
<p>[in Baghdad] particularly at night. Looting, revenge killing and subversive activities </p>
<p>are rife … Should a bloody and protracted insurgency establish itself in Baghdad, </p>
<p>then a ripple effect is likely to occur.”</p>
<p><b>329. </b> Gen Jackson also observed that the Coalition’s ability to “hold onto the consent  </p>
<p>in the South” would only be possible if Baghdad remained secure and stable.  </p>
<p>He advised that:</p>
<p>“… we should at least look at direct UK military involvement in order to win ‘hearts </p>
<p>and minds’ and create a more secure environment … I do not believe we can </p>
<p>influence the situation in Baghdad without engagement. Nor do I believe that </p>
<p>committal of HQ ARRC alone will address what is essentially a tactical problem, </p>
<p>albeit one with strategic overtones. If we make the decision to become tactically </p>
<p>engaged in Baghdad then this may well provide much greater strategic focus for the </p>
<p>rest of government to support, more strongly, efforts on reconstruction … The bottom </p>
<p>line is that if we choose not to influence Baghdad we must be confident of the US </p>
<p>ability to improve [its tactics] before tolerance is lost and insurgency sets in. If we </p>
<p>choose to influence it we must be confident of improving the situation and not being </p>
<p>over-engaged in both the south and the north.”</p>
<p><b>330. </b> Gen Jackson concluded by observing that:</p>
<p>“We must not throw away these substantial achievements [those of the UK forces </p>
<p>in South-East Iraq] by processes that are failing to deliver, and we must ensure </p>
<p>a secure environment throughout the theatre – not least in Baghdad – to enable </p>
<p>successful reconstruction.”</p>

<p>“No progress is possible until security improves. Crime is widespread (not surprising </p>
<p>as Saddam released all the criminals last autumn). Car-jackings are endemic, with </p>
<p>the cars driven to Iran for sale. Last week the Ministry of Planning was re-kitted </p>
<p>out ready to resume work; that night it was looted again. The evening air is full of </p>
<p>gunfire. There is still a climate of fear on the streets, because of the level of crime, </p>
<p>and that is casting a shadow over all else.”</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>332. </b> On 12 May, reporting to the FCO on the political process, Mr Sawers observed:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s emerging political leaders are working together surprisingly well and the </p>
<p>process is gaining momentum. The Leadership Group of five has expanded to </p>
<p>seven or eight embracing two more important constituencies … They have a Joint </p>
<p>Secretariat, and their thinking is coalescing around plans for a National Conference </p>
<p>which are close to our own. They want an Interim Authority to be more like a </p>
<p>transitional government.”</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>333. </b> The Leadership Group comprised Iraqi politicians drawn from identifiable </p>
<p>political and regional groups and had been established by Gen Garner after his arrival </p>

<p>Saddam, and those who had remained in Iraq.</p>

<p> However:</p>
<p>“… the assurances you gave me about the need for a UN mandate to establish a </p>

<p>given in the House of Commons and elsewhere about the legal authority of the </p>
<p>Occupying Powers, and the need for a UN-led process to establish a legitimate Iraqi </p>
<p>government. This makes my position impossible.”</p>
<p>Mr Blair responded, thanking Ms Short for her valuable work and rebutting her accusation </p>
<p>regarding the resolution:</p>
<p>“We are in the process of negotiating the UN resolution at the moment. And the </p>

<p>should work together. That is exactly what the resolution stipulates.”</p>
<p>In a statement to Parliament that day, Ms Short explained:</p>
<p>“The Coalition does not have sovereign authority and has no authority to bring into </p>
<p>being an Interim Iraqi Government with such authority or to create a constitutional </p>
<p>process leading to the election of a sovereign Government. The only body that </p>

<p>Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of the FCO’s UN Department in London, who was involved in </p>

<p>negotiation of this resolution, a decision was taken not to involve them [DFID]”.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he had taken that decision, and thought that it had happened </p>
<p>after he had understood that Ms Short intended to resign: “I think that I got wind of this, </p>
<p>and I think the reason was that I had decided we had settled the policy. We knew what the </p>

<p><b>337. </b> On 14 May, the Security Council met to discuss the draft resolution circulated </p>
<p>on 9 May.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> Ambassador Negroponte, Sir Jeremy Greenstock and the Spanish </p>
<p>representative Ambassador Inocencio F Arias attended and answered questions.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> The debate centred on the creation of the IIA and clarity about the UN’s role, on </p>
<p>whether the OFF programme was to close and if so how, and on the legal underpinning </p>
<p>of reconstruction activities. Sir Jeremy “agreed we needed to be clearer about the </p>
<p>political process”.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Following the discussions, the US faxed to the FCO a revised draft of the </p>
<p>resolution. This included some minor drafting amendments (including the Iraqi </p>
<p>Assistance Fund reverting to its original title of Development Fund), removed UN </p>
<p>immunity from the Development Fund (which had been unpopular with several Security </p>
<p>Council members) and proposed new language which gave the Government of Iraq a </p>
<p>shared role in deciding whether 5 percent of oil profits should continue to be paid into </p>
<p>the Compensation Fund.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock briefed the FCO that the revised version “contains a  </p>
<p>few helpful changes, but will not be seen as much of a step forward by the Council”.  </p>
<p>In Sir Jeremy’s view negotiations had been constructive but there was “a long way to </p>
<p>go on substance”.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Mr Straw told Cabinet on 15 May that both the UK and the US “accepted the  </p>
<p>need for improvements to the text” of the resolution in the light of discussions in the </p>

<p>were security, health care, power and sanitation.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>From a short to a long Occupation</b></p>
<p><i>Hard Lessons</i> records Ambassador Bremer saying:</p>
<p>“… the President’s instructions to me … when I had lunch with him alone on May 6th, </p>
<p>were that we’re going to take our time to get it right … The President had effectively, </p>
<p>though perhaps not formally, changed his position on the question of a short or long </p>
<p>Occupation, having before the war been in favour of a short occupation. By the time </p>
<p>I came in, that was gone.”</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>The thinking behind the shift away from a short Occupation was recorded by Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld, in a “pre-decisional” memo of 8 May 2003, which RAND described as laying  </p>
<p>out a rationale for “an extended and deeply engaged American Occupation”.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>The RAND report records that both the participants in the NSC process and the US </p>
<p>military were taken by surprise by the decision. In the views of the RAND analysts, </p>
<p>this change in US approach to the post-invasion governance of Iraq had serious </p>
<p>consequences:</p>
<p>“First, it left the CPA bereft of plans, the preparations done by ORHA having been </p>
<p>premised on an entirely different and a much more abbreviated vision of America’s </p>
<p>responsibility for the country’s post-war governance. Second, and arguably more </p>
<p>important, it left Iraqis with the impression that the United States had initially intended </p>
<p>to hand over sovereignty quickly and then had gone back on its word, sowing the </p>
<p>seeds of distrust between Iraqis and Americans.”</p>
<p><i>Hard Lessons</i> reports:</p>
<p>“Ordinarily, a political-military plan would have clearly articulated a detailed strategy </p>
<p>for engaging with the leaders of Iraqi factions in postwar Iraq. But because Defense </p>
<p>officials intended to transfer control rapidly to an interim Iraqi authority, ORHA </p>
<p>was told it would not need such a plan. ‘The expectations derived from policy set </p>
<p>in Washington were that the establishment and devolution of authority to an Iraqi </p>
<p>entity would proceed quickly’, an ORHA planner wrote, obviating the need for </p>
<p>a governance strategy.”</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>The RAND analysts found that:</p>
<p>“The growing chaos on the ground in Iraq seems to have caused the administration to </p>
<p>retreat from this plan and choose what had earlier been the lead option, the creation </p>
<p>of an American occupational authority led by a senior political figure.”</p>

<p>In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The shift from ORHA to the CPA was not controversial, neither was the appointment </p>
<p>of Ambassador Bremer. I do not recall exactly when both were decided. It was widely </p>
<p>accepted that ORHA, at the beginning, was not geared up to the task. Bremer was, </p>
<p>in my view, a very effective operator and given the scale of the task, the CPA made </p>
<p>considerable strides forward.</p>
<p>“I do not accept there were differing assumptions between the US and the UK about </p>
<p>the three stage plan for the aftermath: military government; transition to civilian </p>
<p>led administration; and then to a proper Iraqi Government. There was a difference </p>
<p>over the UN role that was debated and decided. Inevitably, it was impossible to pin </p>
<p>down the precise details of how and more important when, each stage of transition </p>
<p>would occur, until we were in and could judge according to the reality. But the basic </p>

<p>“The 1st Armoured Division entered Baghdad 16 days after it left its start line. That </p>
<p>was a stunning military operation. But in so doing, it caught everyone by surprise, </p>
<p>because we arrived at Baghdad Airport and looked round and said, ‘Now what are </p>
<p>we going to do?’ Part of the planning was assumed to be have been able to take </p>
<p>place during the advance …</p>
<p>“So we arrived in the capital with a hugely celebratory population and the </p>
<p>honeymoon lasted a few days and then we were the guilty bastards. We were not </p>
<p>laying on everything that we were supposed to do. They were saying to us, ‘You </p>
<p>people put a man on the moon and now you are saying we can’t have electricity? </p>
<p>We don’t believe you. You are now my opponent’. All that lack of understanding was </p>
<p>what Bremer and his civil military team was trying to deal with whilst building itself.”</p>
<p><b>348. </b> Lt Gen Viggers observed:</p>
<p>“We had no prisons to put people in, or judges, we had no courts. So merely </p>
<p>arresting people and throwing them into pens wasn’t actually going to improve the </p>
<p>sense of security and wellbeing and confidence in the international community.</p>
<p>“So … the first three or four months was in effect making the plan in contact.”</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>349. </b> Ambassador Bremer told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… although there were some 40,000 Coalition troops in Baghdad when I arrived, </p>
<p>since the collapse of the Saddam regime looters had pillaged at will for more than </p>
<p>three weeks undisturbed by Coalition forces. Coalition troops had no orders to stop </p>
<p>the looting and the Iraqi police in all major cities had deserted their posts.</p>
<p>“The looting was done out of rage, revenge, and for profit.”</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>350. </b> Consequences of the looting included economic damage, destruction of a large </p>
<p>part of the government’s physical infrastructure and the transmission of a message that </p>

<p>inconvenient nihilistic activities that weren’t really an overarching threat to security … </p>

<p>ingots and sell them.”</p>
<p> 227</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Gen Wall told the Inquiry that it was nonetheless possible for UK troops:</p>
<p>“ … to get out and about and interact with people, and the people on the street </p>
<p>would tell you that if you could be part of a military force that could bring about the </p>

<p>while the Security Council deliberated, while encouraging other Council members to </p>
<p>seize the opportunity to re-engage the UN in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Concerns had focused on a need for clarity in three areas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The extent of the UN role and how the Special Co-ordinator would interact with </p>
<p>the Coalition and IIA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The political process, in particular the exact nature of the IIA: whether it would </p>
<p>be a transitional government and, if not, when and how it would become one.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Arrangements for oversight of oil sales and disbursement of oil revenue, as well </p>
<p>as the fate of existing contracts under the OFF programme.</p>
<p>It was also reported that the US wanted the resolution to be adopted by 22 May, as </p>
<p>this was the date by which they wished to start exporting oil to avoid a lack of storage </p>
<p>capacity affecting production and so the local supply of gas and petrol.</p>
<p><b>357. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“The other members of the Security Council were more constructive than I was </p>
<p>expecting at this stage, I think for one, perhaps two, overwhelming reasons. One was </p>
<p>that they wanted the United Nations to come back into the picture. They wanted the </p>
<p>unilateralism of what they saw as having happened in the invasion to be corrected </p>

<p><b>359. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke the following day.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> Action in the UN seemed </p>
<p>to be going well and Mr Blair proposed two areas (a UN “Special Representative” rather </p>
<p>than “Special Co-ordinator”; and greater transparency of oil sales) in which the resolution </p>
<p>might be amended if tactically necessary.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> During the conversation, Mr Blair confirmed that Mr Sawers was working closely </p>
<p>with Ambassador Bremer. Although there were many differences between Basra and </p>
<p>Baghdad, Mr Blair offered “whatever help we could give for Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>361. </b> On 16 May, CPA Order No.1 ‘de-Ba’athification of Iraqi Society’ was issued. It was </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer’s first formal act as Head of the CPA.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>de-Ba’athification</b></p>
<p>The UK’s role in the development and implementation of de-Ba’athification policy is </p>
<p>described in detail in Section 11.1.</p>
<p>Many witnesses told the Inquiry that the extent of the CPA’s de-Ba’athification policy had </p>
<p>significant implications.</p>
<p>Mr Straw described the twin decisions to de-Ba’athify and disband the military as </p>
<p>“the single greatest errors that were made post-war”.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> He accepted that a degree of </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification was required but argued that that “what we had wanted was a greater </p>
<p>level of intelligence applied, distinguishing between who was in the Ba’ath Party because </p>
<p>they had to be because they wanted to make a living, and who was in the Ba’ath Party </p>
<p>because they were enthusiasts”.</p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I’m not sure in my own mind about this even now … it was going to be really difficult </p>
<p>to prevent a certain level of de-Ba’athification. The question is: should it have gone </p>
<p>down to the level it did? … I got on to President Bush pretty much straight away on </p>
<p>this …<b> </b>as a result of the conversation I had with George Bush, literally days after this, </p>
<p>they were then scaling back. They scaled back further, and in respect of the army, </p>
<p>they were always intending to re-recruit and then they corrected this pension problem </p>
<p>that they had with the army pretty quickly.”</p>

<p>195</p>
<p>Mr Hilary Benn, Minister for International Development from May to October 2003, </p>
<p>commented that more should have been done to understand the difference between </p>
<p>“ideological Ba’athists” and those who had “joined the Ba’ath Party because that’s what </p>
<p>you needed to do to get on”.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that the de-Ba’athification decision was </p>
<p>“madness”.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary from 1998 to November 2005, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“We didn’t assume that the Americans were going to de-Ba’athify as fundamentally </p>
<p>as they did …</p>
<p>“I thought we had an undertaking from the American administration that they were </p>
<p>just going to do very light de-Ba’athification … and that the army … other than the </p>
<p>very top, would be used and brought into the system.”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, who served as the Prime Minister’s Special Representative </p>
<p>on Iraq from September 2003 to March 2004, told the Inquiry that there were strong </p>
<p>arguments in favour of the de-Ba’athification policy; the error was in implementing them </p>
<p>before arrangements had been thought through for replacing the individuals who were </p>
<p>removed and, later, in handing over responsibility for implementing the administration </p>
<p>of the scheme to Dr Ahmed Chalabi and his Commission.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>The view of Maj Gen Cross was that the decision to de-Ba’athify was “flawed”.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>SIS1 told the Inquiry that Ambassador Bremer had been acting under political direction  </p>
<p>on de-Ba’athification policy but:</p>
<p>“Initially you’re talking about decapitating the regime and leaving the structures in </p>
<p>place. He went a lot further, and frankly, to this day, I don’t really know why.”</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>Mr Edward Chaplin, British Ambassador to Iraq from July 2004 to May 2005, observed </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“… it is easy to underestimate with hindsight how powerful the feelings were amongst </p>
<p>those who had suffered most from Saddam Hussein’s regime, that the idea that </p>
<p>anybody who had served really at any level of responsibility in the organisation that </p>
<p>served Saddam Hussein was acceptable in a post-Saddam Hussein situation was </p>
<p>simply anathema and I think, if you talk to the military commanders in the South, </p>
<p>you will find that we suffered from that ourselves – somebody who appeared to be, </p>
<p>actually perfectly competent … was simply not acceptable to the local population </p>
<p>because he was too closely identified with the previous regime. So de-Ba’athification </p>
<p>was driven largely by the forces that were now in charge, or potentially in charge; it </p>
<p>wasn’t just a decision by outsiders.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director General Operational Policy from 2004 to 2007, told  </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the Coalition rightly wanted to sort of involve Iraqis from the outset and, as it  </p>
<p>were, start to build up the seeds of an Iraqi administration. Inevitably the people </p>
<p>that tended to be part of that were violently anti-Ba’athist. They were very keen that </p>
<p>Ba’athism should be completely removed, and I think that actually did influence some </p>
<p>decisions that were made in the middle of 2004 about the Iraqi bureaucracy, about </p>
<p>the army, which I think with hindsight were probably the wrong decisions. But there </p>
<p>was very strong political pressure from the people who ultimately were going to be </p>
<p>part of the government.”</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>362. </b> On 16 May Ambassador Bremer also issued CPA Regulation No.1.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> It opened:</p>
<p>“<i>Pursuant</i> to my authority as Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority </p>
<p>(CPA), relevant UN Security Council resolutions, including resolution 1483 (2003), </p>
<p>and the laws and usages of war”.</p>
<p>Regulation No.1 continued:</p>
<p>“1. The CPA shall exercise powers of government temporarily in order to provide for </p>
<p>the effective administration of Iraq during the period of transitional administration, </p>
<p>to restore conditions of security and stability, to create conditions in which the Iraqi </p>
<p>people can freely determine their own political future, including by advancing efforts </p>
<p>to restore and establish national and local institutions for representative governance </p>
<p>and facilitating economic recovery and sustainable reconstruction and development.</p>
<p>“2. The CPA is vested with all executive, legislative and judicial authority necessary </p>
<p>to achieve its objectives, to be exercised under relevant UN Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions, including resolution 1483 (2003), and the laws and usages of war. </p>
<p>This authority shall be exercised by the CPA Administrator.”</p>
<p><b>The organisation of the CPA</b></p>
<p>All functions in the CPA reported to Ambassador Bremer.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>The “line offices” run by seven Directors covered oil, civil affairs, economic policy, aid, </p>
<p>regional operations, security affairs and communications. Under these “line offices”, senior </p>
<p>advisers were assigned to every Iraqi ministry and charged with running those ministries </p>
<p>until August 2003. Once Iraqi Ministers were appointed in August, it was intended that the </p>
<p>advisers would act as counsellors, but Ambassador Bremer would retain veto authority over </p>
<p>Ministerial decisions, and senior advisers would retain considerable authority over spending.</p>
<p>By July 2003 the CPA had established branch offices in each of Iraq’s 18 provinces. It took </p>
<p>six months to staff those offices.</p>

<p>197</p>
<p><b>363. </b> In a telephone call with Mr Blair on 19 May, Mr Gerhard Schröder, the German </p>
<p>Chancellor, asked for four amendments to the draft post-conflict resolution, which would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>give the UN control of oil revenues;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-name the UN Special Co-ordinator the UN Special Representative;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allow UNMOVIC’s mandate to continue; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lift sanctions for just one year, at which point the Security Council would discuss </p>
<p>them further.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>364. </b> On the first, Mr Blair highlighted plans for a monitoring board, which would include </p>
<p>the Secretary-General’s representative. He suggested that the second and third points </p>
<p>could be accommodated, leaving his office to deal with the fourth.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Reporting the conversation to the FCO, Mr Rycroft observed that “this was a </p>
<p>positive signal … that Germany is close to a vote in favour of the draft resolution”.</p>
<p><b>366. </b> A revised version of the resolution was presented to the Security Council on </p>
<p>19 May and “went down fairly well”.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> A vote was expected on 21 May, but was delayed </p>
<p>until the following day.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Sir David Manning and others met representatives of all seven Iraqi political parties </p>
<p>in Baghdad on 20 May.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> The Iraqi representatives objected strongly to references to </p>
<p>Occupying Powers in the draft resolution and said that “the SCR offered Iraqis less </p>
<p>freedom than had the 1920 structure which established the British colonial regime”.  </p>
<p>Sir David responded that the phrase was a technical requirement.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> One of the Iraqi representatives was reported to have commented that, while the </p>
<p>security situation in Baghdad was poor and not likely to improve in the next month or </p>
<p>so, the situation in Basra was also deteriorating, as the “rabble” got the measure of the </p>
<p>British forces.</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Reporting on his visit to Iraq more generally, Sir David judged that “Baghdad </p>
<p>remains key; and the key to Baghdad is security”.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> But his view was that:</p>
<p>“… things did not seem as bad as painted by the media … There was no sense </p>
<p>of being under immediate threat. The mood still seems cautiously welcoming or at </p>
<p>least acquiescent – never hostile. But this could turn fast, if the security situation </p>
<p>is not sorted out fast. Breaking the pattern of lawlessness and looting at night is </p>
<p>particularly critical.”</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Sir David considered that police training “could have a disproportionate </p>
<p>impact” and:</p>

<p>198</p>
<p>“A quick win would be moving 16 Air Assault Brigade to Baghdad with the task of </p>
<p>providing police training for six weeks … The Chiefs will let you [Mr Blair] have </p>
<p>advice today or tomorrow … I have no doubt that the impact of British troops training </p>
<p>with, and working alongside, Iraqis would be considerable … The hard pressed </p>
<p>Bremer is very keen to have them.”</p>
<p><b>371. </b> A UK military report from Basra on 19 May recorded that “widespread looting … </p>
<p>has ceased, but there has been an increase in theft and scavenging”.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> The port of </p>
<p>Umm Qasr had been handed back to Iraqi control.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Sir David’s presence in Iraq overlapped with a visit by Major General David </p>
<p>Richards, Assistant Chief of the General Staff, who visited Iraq from 17 to 21 May at the </p>
<p>request of Mr Hoon and Gen Walker to scope the potential for a UK role in improving the </p>
<p>proposed Security Sector Reform (SSR) programme.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Maj Gen Richards reported:</p>
<p>“Despite US Occupation of the city [Baghdad] for the last four weeks, the law and </p>
<p>order situation is fragile. The indigenous police service has not returned to work </p>
<p>in any coherent manner. 3 ID [the US Third Infantry Division] are clearly tired and </p>
<p>wrongly configured to conduct joint military/police patrolling …</p>
<p>“… the immediate requirement is clearly to restore law and order in Baghdad. </p>
<p>Two key areas have been identified for the UK to make a contribution. First, and </p>
<p>supported strongly by Bremer, Slocombe, Sawyer and US and UK military, is the </p>
<p>rapid deployment of 16 Air Asslt Bde (-)</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> to create the nucleus of an effective police </p>
<p>force in Baghdad. It should achieve this through galvanising and taking control of </p>
<p>ORHA’s creation of a functioning police force and effective guard service. Second, </p>
<p>and in the longer term, to place UK personnel in key appointments within the </p>
<p>organisations responsible for delivering SSR.”</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Maj Gen Richards’ recommendation was that 16 Air Assault Brigade should be </p>
<p>“deployed at best speed to Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> On 20 May, Mr Sawers reported to the FCO in London on the impact of </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer’s arrival in Baghdad, which he judged had “made a big </p>
<p>difference”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> He summarised his assessment as:</p>
<p>“Security in Baghdad remains the most urgent issue. The military are being  </p>

<p>facing the Coalition are many, and there is still doubt over how quickly Washington </p>
<p>and the UN will be able to move money and people to Baghdad to really start </p>
<p>rebuilding services and laying a base for economic reconstruction. Resentment will </p>
<p>grow daily if life does not become easier soon. But Bremer is getting a grip. We will </p>
<p>not always agree with him, e.g. on the role of the UN and the threat from Tehran. </p>
<p>But his energy, intelligence and management skills mean we are much better served </p>
<p>now he is here.”</p>
<p><b>376. </b> In terms of financing the reconstruction effort, Mr Sawers judged that:</p>
<p>“Passing the UNSCR will be a great boon, especially by freeing up Iraqi assets and </p>
<p>allowing oil to be sold without controversy. But the road ahead will be a long slog.”</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Sawers reported positively on working relations with Ambassador Bremer, who </p>
<p>“arrived thinking ‘US’ but with me at his elbow he quickly switched to ‘Coalition’”, and </p>
<p>reported being given “a near equal hand in the political process”.</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Mr Sawers’ views were echoed by Sir David Manning, who told Mr Blair in the </p>
<p>report of his visit that “ORHA is the shambles already described by John Sawers …  </p>
<p>A huge, disorganised, dysfunctional outfit … But I found Bremer impressive. He will get </p>
<p>a grip, and wants our help.”</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>379. </b> Gen Walker briefed the Chiefs of Staff at their meeting on 21 May, observing that </p>
<p>“senior US military and ORHA figures in theatre were seeking to import the model of the </p>
<p>UK’s success in Basra to the Capital to help stabilise the situation”.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Three options had been identified, of which the recommended one was the </p>
<p>short-term deployment of 16 Air Assault Brigade to Baghdad. The minutes record that </p>
<p>Gen Walker “directed PJHQ to conduct an estimate” of the proposal “to inform COS </p>
<p>[Chiefs of Staff] advice to Ministers”.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Specific questions that should be addressed included: what effects were required </p>
<p>on the ground; what intelligence was available in Baghdad; what was the threat in </p>
<p>Baghdad to UK troops; was the proposal a sound military plan; would the morale of </p>
<p>the Brigade withstand the re-tasking and extended tour; would this option deliver the </p>
<p>necessary effect; what was the exit strategy; and how would this option impact on </p>
<p>operations in the UK Area of Operation?</p>
<p><b>382. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that the US was “unlikely to be able to deploy a suitable </p>
<p>unit to Baghdad in the timescale required” but it was also:</p>
<p>“… necessary for the UK not to establish a reputation with the US of being the </p>
<p>follow-up country of choice and, therefore, it was important for the US to request  </p>
<p>the UK undertake the role rather than to volunteer the capability.”</p>

<p>200</p>
<p><b>383. </b> In a bilateral meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld on 21 May, Mr Hoon raised the </p>
<p>security situation in Baghdad and said:</p>
<p>“UK Armed Forces would be happy to help if needed, for example by providing </p>
<p>advisers: our experience in Sierra Leone – training a security forces essentially from </p>
<p>scratch – was highly relevant.”</p>
<p>257</p>
<p><b>384. </b> The following day, on 22 May, the Chiefs of Staff considered the issue of deploying </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade further.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments), who had visited Baghdad with Maj Gen Richards, reported that:</p>
<p>“… at best, the law and order situation was stable or slightly deteriorating, and the </p>
<p>key judgement was whether the UK could bridge the gap until the new US forces </p>
<p>arrived and were effective … His view was that [the proposal to deploy 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade] would provide the effects required.”</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Mr Sawers explained to attendees that both Ambassador Bremer and General </p>
<p>John Abizaid, Commander US Central Command (CENTCOM), were “aware that the </p>
<p>Coalition was succeeding outside Baghdad, but was failing in the Capital”. They knew </p>
<p>what was required, but were “unable to deliver them with the force package currently to </p>
<p>hand and would welcome a demonstration of effect to initiate the necessary change”. </p>
<p>Mr Sawers was:</p>
<p>“… confident that the US would achieve the desired effect in due course. The key </p>
<p>issue was the immediate future and deterioration in the intervening period.”</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Major General Robert Fry, the Deputy Chief of Joint Operations, reported to the </p>
<p>Chief of the Defence Staff that PJHQ was not certain, without a reconnaissance visit, </p>
<p>where the UK could achieve effect.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> PJHQ considered it was “likely, while 16 AA Bde </p>
<p>could provide two battle groups to Baghdad, that the enablers required would have to </p>
<p>be drawn from Basra with a consequent increased risk to success there”. He also noted </p>
<p>that 16 Air Assault Brigade would need external assistance in order to provide instruction </p>
<p>in policing.</p>
<p><b>388. </b> The MOD Legal Adviser observed that “a number of difficult legal issues would </p>

<p>“… it was agreed that while deploying 16 AA Bde to Baghdad … would be useful, </p>
<p>it was not clear that it was strategically essential as the US would achieve the </p>

<p><b>389. </b> Cabinet Office officials provided an Annotated Agenda to members of the AHMGIR </p>
<p>for their meeting on 22 May.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“ORHA’s efficiency and ties to Washington have benefitted significantly from </p>
<p>Bremer’s arrival. He is changing ORHA’s top management. Virtually all of Garner’s </p>
<p>team are likely to go soon. Bremer is working closely with John Sawers. His changes </p>
<p>have yet to lead to significant improvement in ORHA’s performance on the ground in </p>
<p>Baghdad and elsewhere … ORHA’s capacity is increasing. It now has just over  </p>
<p>1,000 personnel.”</p>
<p><b>390. </b> The Annotated Agenda also recorded that the Leadership Group was “becoming </p>
<p>more assertive” in the process of organising the “Baghdad Conference” that was </p>
<p>intended to select the IIA. The timing of the conference looked likely to slip from May </p>
<p>to July and the Leadership Group was proposing that it should be convened by a </p>
<p>Committee of 35 individuals, drawn from across the Governorates of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Cabinet Office officials wrote, “our view is that … the political process must be </p>
<p>Iraq-owned if it is to have legitimacy in and outside Iraq” but that the US was “uneasy </p>
<p>about losing control of the selection process and, through it, the Baghdad Conference”.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> The Leadership Group was also reported to have disagreed with Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer on what status the IIA should have. In its view, it should have real executive </p>
<p>power rather than act in support of the Coalition.</p>
<p><b>393. </b> Mr Straw told the AHMGIR that Ambassador Bremer had delayed the </p>
<p>establishment of the IIA, with the result that it was likely to have more members from </p>
<p>within Iraq and fewer exiles. In his view this “should make it more legitimate in the eyes </p>
<p>of the Iraqi people”.</p>

<p><b>394. </b> When the new resolution was in near-final form, on 21 May FCO Legal Advisers </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Straw briefed a meeting of Cabinet the same day that:</p>
<p>“This Security Council resolution would put the Coalition’s work in Iraq on a  </p>
<p>firm basis, including for oil sales …The Attorney General’s advice … had been </p>
<p>followed. For example, no change in institutions was being imposed before the </p>
<p>resolution was passed.”</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>397. </b> The resolution confirmed that there would be a role for the UN, exercised through </p>
<p>a Special Representative to the Secretary-General, but made it clear that the UN would </p>
<p>not have the lead responsibility for the administration and reconstruction of Iraq, which </p>
<p>would fall to the CPA.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p><b>398. </b> The key sections of the resolution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>called for help in the reform, rebuilding, stabilisation and security of Iraq, </p>
<p>including from International Financial Institutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>called upon the CPA to administer Iraq effectively and create “conditions in </p>
<p>which the Iraqi people can freely determine their own political future”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>required Member States to help the safe return of Iraqi cultural property (such as </p>
<p>looted artefacts) and to prevent it being sold;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lifted all sanctions except those related to arms;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>established the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), to be controlled by the CPA, </p>
<p>and gave it limited immunity (excepting the costs of oil spills);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>established new arrangements for the sale of oil, the proceeds of which would </p>
<p>go into the DFI, along with any assets of the previous regime held by a Member </p>
<p>State;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extended OFF by up to six months, by which time the programme should be </p>
<p>closed down; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>made provision for a review after 12 months.</p>
<p><b>399. </b> The resolution asked the Secretary-General to appoint a Special Representative </p>
<p>for Iraq, with a co-ordinating role focused on reconstruction and humanitarian support, </p>
<p>reporting regularly to the UN. Their role in political reconstruction was to work with </p>
<p>the CPA and people of Iraq, but not to lead the process. The relevant section of the </p>
<p>resolution said that the Security Council:</p>
<p>“Supports the formation, by the people of Iraq with the help of the Authority and </p>
<p>working with the Special Representative, of an Iraqi interim administration as </p>
<p>a transitional administration run by Iraqis, until an internationally recognized, </p>
<p>representative government is established by the people of Iraq and assumes the </p>
<p>responsibilities of the Authority.”</p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 22 May 2003. </p>

<p>UN Security Council resolution 1483 (2003).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.1  |  March to 22 May 2003</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>400. </b> The Special Representative was also given a role in promoting the economy and </p>
<p>human rights, and encouraging reform of the police and criminal justice system.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that resolution 1483:</p>
<p>“Made it appear that the Special Representative of the Secretary-General was going </p>
<p>to be at the apex of a relationship which, in truth, on the ground he was not. He was, </p>
<p>as I saw it, one of an equal triangle of responsibility, and the UN and the UK were </p>
<p>subordinate to the United States in terms of the physical presence on the ground </p>
<p>of resources and capability.”</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>Joint Occupying Powers</b></p>
<p>The Preambular Paragraphs (PPs) of resolution 1483 contained statements about </p>
<p>the status of the members of the Coalition, noting the letter of 8 May 2003 from the </p>
<p>Permanent Representatives of the US and UK, and “recognising the specific authorities, </p>
<p>responsibilities, and obligations under international law of these states as occupying </p>
<p>powers under unified command (‘the Authority’)”. The following paragraph noted further </p>
<p>“that other States that are not Occupying Powers are working now or in the future may </p>
<p>work under the Authority”.</p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that the use of the phrase “Occupying Powers” </p>
<p>had been deliberate:</p>
<p>“… there were people in Washington and, indeed, I think in London, who didn’t </p>
<p>want any mention of Occupation or Occupying Powers … and also the image of </p>
<p>an Occupation, which was obviously in the context of the Middle East going to be </p>
<p>compared with the Israeli Occupation of Palestine and, indeed, was by Al Jazeera </p>
<p>and the man on the street in the Arab world. And I remember advising London that </p>
<p>it was sensible to have a mention of Occupying Powers because that made it clear </p>
<p>under what body of international legislation we would be acting, and without that </p>
<p>clarity, we might be confused ourselves and our fellow Security Council members </p>
<p>might resist agreeing to a resolution unless there was a clear mention of what the </p>
<p>status was of the people in charge of the territory. And London and Washington </p>
<p>decided that they would be the two that took the responsibility for that status of our </p>
<p>presence in Iraq.”</p>
<p> 267</p>
<p>Sir Jeremy explained to the Inquiry that he:</p>
<p>“… wanted clarity of status, and … an incentive for us to make this period of </p>
<p>occupying in Iraq as short as possible … [because] it might make the Americans </p>
<p>realise what they were taking on, because it was inevitable that it would be thought </p>
<p>of as an Occupation, and I thought it was better to be realistic about this than to try </p>
<p>to cover it up, because you wouldn’t cover it up.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>Sir Jeremy also argued that the term “Occupying Powers” did not have a negative </p>
<p>connotation for the Iraqi people when resolution 1483 was adopted, but acquired it later </p>
<p>when they were “emotionally encouraged to think of this as an Occupation, in parallel </p>
<p>with Palestine” by television stations such as Al Jazeera. He added “they weren’t angry </p>
<p>because this was called an Occupation. They were angry because foreign boots were on </p>
<p>their soil and life had not been made better.”</p>
<p>A number of the Inquiry’s Iraqi interlocutors emphasised how much the inclusion of the </p>
<p>term “Occupying Powers” within resolution 1483 was resented.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>A US official who worked within the CPA explained to the Inquiry that in the US the term </p>
<p>“Occupation” had benign connotations of the US’ role in Germany and Japan, but for Iraqis </p>
<p>it was very different. There had been a failure on the part of the US and UK to understand </p>
<p>the baggage that was associated with the term.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>The Inquiry asked a number of witnesses about their understanding of whether the UK </p>
<p>was legally responsible only for the area of the South-East of Iraq, where it was physically </p>
<p>in Occupation, or whether it was jointly responsible for the whole of Iraq; and whether the </p>
<p>Government had taken a positive decision that it wished to be considered a joint occupier </p>
<p>of the whole of Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… it was going to be to our advantage to make sure we were joint partners with the </p>
<p>US, because that both gave us a locus in Baghdad but also meant that they had </p>
<p>some responsibility for our area too. So I think this was a perfectly satisfactory way </p>
<p>of resolving it.”</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>Mr Straw gave the Inquiry a contrasting view that:</p>
<p>“… it was desirable, if legally possible, for us to have authority over that area which </p>
<p>we controlled and not more widely … We judged there might be some advantage </p>
<p>from that [joint responsibility] for whoever was sitting alongside the Garner and </p>
<p>then the Bremer figure in terms of having joint power as well … It would have been </p>
<p>desirable if we had had a clear area for which we were responsible without the </p>
<p>Americans and got on with it, but you know, it wasn’t to be.”</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>When asked whether there had been a decision by the UK Government to become a joint </p>
<p>Occupying Power, Mr Straw said that it followed from the legal advice and came out of a </p>
<p>process that would have included conversations with the Attorney General.</p>
<p>Sir Michael Wood commented in his statement to the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“The matter was far from clear. From the outset of the Occupation, US military </p>
<p>commanders started making declarations to the Iraqi people, in the name of </p>
<p>‘Coalition’, that were not properly (or at all) cleared with the United Kingdom. They </p>
<p>soon established the ‘Coalition Provisional Authority’, an entirely American creation </p>
<p>in respect of which the United Kingdom had some (variable) influence but no control. </p>
<p>There was thus the appearance of a joint Occupation throughout Iraq, despite the fact </p>
<p>that the United Kingdom had no actual authority outside the South-East …</p>

<p>205</p>
<p>“As a matter of law … there was a distinction between (i) the rights and </p>
<p>responsibilities of the United Kingdom as an Occupying Power in the area of Iraq </p>
<p>under the actual authority of UK armed forces and (ii) the potential liability of the </p>
<p>United Kingdom for acts or omissions of the CPA. This distinction was a real one, </p>
<p>notwithstanding that the CPA was an instrument through which the Occupying </p>
<p>Powers sought to exercise certain of their respective rights and responsibilities </p>
<p>(including as extended in due course by the Security Council).”</p>
<p>Sir Michael continued:</p>
<p>“As to (i) there was a proper concern that the UK might be regarded as being a joint </p>
<p>Occupying Power throughout the whole of Iraq, <i>inter alia </i>because of the CPA … As </p>
<p>to (ii), it was considered likely that, if the matter were ever tested, the CPA could </p>
<p>be found to be a body constituted by the US and the UK for which the two States </p>
<p>had a degree of joint responsibility … So far as I recall, the question whether the </p>
<p>CPA, despite its name, was in reality an emanation of the United States, not of ‘the </p>
<p>Coalition’ as such (US, UK and possibly others) was an unresolved issue throughout </p>
<p>its existence.”</p>
