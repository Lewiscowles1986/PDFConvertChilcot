<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section covers the year leading up to Mr Blair’s departure from No.10 in June </p>
<p>2007, and addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of the Basra Security Plan (including Operation SINBAD) and </p>
<p>the Better Basra Plan; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK planning for withdrawal from Iraq and reinforcement in Afghanistan, and the </p>
<p>beginning of transition to Provincial Iraqi Control in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK responses to the new US strategy of surging forces into Baghdad and their </p>
<p>impact on US/UK relations; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the genesis of negotiations with Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi in Basra. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and reform of its security sector, </p>
<p>covered in Sections 10 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>June 2006</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> On 1 June, Major General John Cooper, General Officer Commanding Multi&#8209;National </p>
<p>Division (South&#8209;East) (GOC MND(SE)) presented his proposals for the Basra Security </p>
<p>Plan to General George Casey, Commander Multi&#8209;National Force – Iraq (MNF&#8209;I).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Maj Gen Cooper wrote that the plan:</p>
<p>“… will bring together a number of programmes and include a diplomatic focus from </p>
<p>Baghdad .. a MOI [Ministry of the Interior] judicial review/inquiry and support for … </p>
<p>search and arrest operations”.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>6. </b> On 2 June, a Cabinet Office official sent Mr Blair an update following his visit to Iraq </p>
<p>on 22 May (described in Section 9.4).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>7. </b> In relation to Gen Casey’s plan to address security in Baghdad, it said:</p>
<p><b>“Our initial assessment of the proposals is positive, with the necessary </b></p>
<p><b>political and military elements woven in.”</b></p>
<p><b>8. </b> On Basra, the update said:</p>
<p>“The Consul General, Military, DFID … in Basra have made joint proposals on </p>
<p>delivering a step&#8209;change in engagement across all lines of operation. We need </p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>to clarify some of Maliki’s proposals during his visit earlier this week (the exact role </p>
<p>of the five man committee he has appointed, and what the Basra Security plan </p>
<p>Casey will offer to Maliki will look like), but the overall impact was very positive and </p>
<p>gives us the central government buy&#8209;in that we need. It also gives us the basis for a </p>
<p>more confident approach on political outreach to Sadr, combined with a harder line </p>
<p>on the Mahdi Army.”</p>
<p><b>9. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 6 June, Mr Blair said that he thought </p>
<p>that the new government had about three months to show that it could make a </p>
<p>difference.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> He suggested that the lack of experience of delivering plans within the </p>
<p>government meant that the US and UK should “shepherd” implementation very closely. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> On 6 June, Mr Blair had a private meeting with Mr Des Browne, the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary, on Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, reported after the meeting </p>
<p>that Mr Blair had asked Mr Browne to focus on the situation in Basra in order to: </p>
<p>“… make sure that the political and military strategies were aligned and proceeding </p>
<p>together. This required micro&#8209;management. We had been slow to grip the situation </p>
<p>there, but now needed: to get on top of the gaps in equipment and training for the </p>
<p>Iraqi forces; a plan for getting Iraqi forces on to the streets; and a new political </p>
<p>dispensation given the interest now being shown by Iraqi national figures.” </p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Browne agreed to take on that role, and also to continue to co&#8209;ordinate media </p>
<p>activity on Iraq, which Mr Blair said needed to be reinvigorated. Mr Blair said that he </p>
<p>intended to use the next meeting of the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee’s </p>
<p>Sub&#8209;Committee on Iraq (DOP(I)) to “divvy up Ministerial responsibility for different parts </p>
<p>of the Iraq strategy”.</p>
<p><b>The death of Abu Musab al&#8209;Zarqawi</b></p>
<p>On 7 June, the leader of Al&#8209;Qaida in Iraq (AQ&#8209;I), Abu Musab al&#8209;Zarqawi, was killed by US </p>
<p>forces in an airstrike on a house 8km north of Baquba.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair relayed reports of his death at the Cabinet meeting the following day.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>Briefing supplied to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary suggested that the UK “played a leading </p>
<p>part in highlighting significant contacts around Zarqawi”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>An initial assessment of the impact of al&#8209;Zarqawi’s death made shortly after he was </p>
<p>killed said that it would bolster the image of the Iraqi Government and have a short term </p>
<p>disruptive effect on AQ&#8209;I.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> But his death was also likely to enhance his iconic status and </p>
<p>inspire other extremists. </p>
<p>In a telephone conversation with Prime Minister Maliki on 8 June, Mr Blair described the </p>
<p>operation as “a very important moment for Iraq”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the weeks that followed, AQ&#8209;I suffered further losses with the capture of several </p>
<p>other senior leaders.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Documents and IT equipment found after the 7 June airstrike provided key information </p>
<p>about AQ&#8209;I.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> Mr Mowaffak al&#8209;Rubaie, Iraq’s National Security Adviser, was reported to </p>
<p>have told a news conference in Baghdad “now we have the upper hand”. </p>
<p>General Stanley McChrystal, the US officer who led the operation against al&#8209;Zarqawi, </p>
<p>wrote in his memoir:</p>
<p>“His death was more than symbolically important. It was a trite reaction among some </p>
<p>to point out that there were thousands of men ready to replace Zarqawi – or any </p>
<p>leader we removed. It was of course true that the organisation regained a leader … </p>
<p>And yet there were not, in fact, thousands of ‘Zarqawis’. He was a peculiar leader. </p>
<p>His mix of charisma, brutality, and clear&#8209;eyed persistence was never matched by </p>
<p>al&#8209;Masri or al&#8209;Masri’s successor.”</p>
<p>13 </p>
<p><b>13. </b> On 8 June, Prime Minister Maliki appointed the final members of his Cabinet: the </p>
<p>Ministers for the Interior, Security and Defence.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Each had been subject to approval by </p>
<p>majority vote in the Council of Representatives. Other ministers had been appointed on </p>
<p>20 May (see Section 9.4). </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr William Patey, the British Ambassador to Iraq, reported that “it is of course good </p>
<p>news that the Government has been finalised but the outcome is far from our ideal”, with </p>
<p>some appointments unlikely to command the broad support for which the UK would have </p>
<p>wished.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary, observed that it was “fitting that the </p>
<p>completion of the new Iraqi government coincided with his [al&#8209;Zarqawi’s] death”.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The new government broadly reflected the ethno&#8209;sectarian balance of Iraq.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It included four women. They were appointed to the Ministries for Housing and </p>

<p><b>17. </b> Mr Dominic Asquith, who succeeded Mr Patey as British Ambassador to Iraq in </p>
<p>August 2006, told the Inquiry that the delay in agreeing the composition of the Cabinet </p>
<p>had a significant impact on Prime Minister Maliki’s performance as a leader.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> In </p>
<p>Mr Asquith’s view, Mr Maliki had never felt confident that he commanded “the loyalty </p>
<p>even of those within his own Shia Alliance” and “was always concerned about the risk </p>
<p>that other political leaders were about to undermine him”. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> In mid&#8209;June, Prime Minister Maliki formally launched the Baghdad Security Plan.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Its key elements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>achieving broad political engagement, with Prime Minister Maliki and the </p>
<p>Minister of the Interior closely involved;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>communication with the local population, including directly by the Iraqi Security </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>initial operations and checkpoints to demonstrate an integrated Multi&#8209;National </p>
<p>Force (MNF), Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police Service approach to security, in which </p>
<p>Iraqis were seen to be taking the lead;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>and 24&#8209;hour continuous patrolling to deter violence;</p>

<p>6</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>protection for the Iraqi Council of Representatives to ensure the uninterrupted </p>
<p>functioning of the Government of Iraq.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>19. </b> On 15 June, the UN Security Council reviewed the mandate of the MNF in Iraq and </p>
<p>the arrangements for the Development Fund for Iraq, as required by resolution 1546 </p>
<p>(2004).</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Hoshyar Zebari, the Iraqi Foreign Minister, told the Security Council that “contrary </p>
<p>to media portrayal, a civil war was not taking place in Iraq” and that the continued </p>
<p>presence of the MNF was “critical to attaining the goal of self&#8209;sufficiency in defending </p>
<p>Iraq and securing peace”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>21. </b> Ms Angela Kane, Assistant UN Secretary&#8209;General for Political Affairs, said:</p>
<p>“While it may be understandable that, due to their transitory character, previous </p>
<p>Governments were unable to take some of the hard decisions required to address </p>
<p>the urgent needs of the Iraqi people, the establishment of a constitutionally&#8209;elected </p>
<p>Government for a full four&#8209;year term offers new hope.”</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York reported that:</p>
<p>“The meeting achieved our key aim – a straightforward review with the Council </p>
<p>agreeing on the need for the MNF presence to continue. At the same time, we </p>
<p>may also have made some progress achieving a more positive UN line on the </p>
<p>international compact …”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Cabinet Office officials provided a paper on delivering a step&#8209;change in Basra for </p>
<p>the meeting of DOP(I) on 15 June.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> The paper stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An announcement on transition to Iraqi control in Muthanna and Maysan </p>
<p>provinces was expected shortly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Progress in developing the ISF was “<b>growing but variable</b>”, with the police </p>
<p>lagging significantly behind the army, including in MND(SE) where the </p>
<p>militia links of the police were a “<b>significant cause for concern</b>”. The MNF </p>
<p>plan, which the MOD was reported as judging to be “<b>robust</b>”, anticipated </p>
<p>MNF retaining substantial forces in Iraq until 2007 to support the ISF (see </p>
<p>Section 12.1).</p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was continuing outreach efforts with both Sunni and Shia groups, </p>
<p>“<b>seeking to draw in as many potential strands of opinion as possible</b> </p>
<p>to reduce the military task in tackling the hard core insurgency” and trying </p>
<p>to persuade the US to deliver a “<b>dividend</b>” for those who enter the political </p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK (primarily DFID) was providing support to a number of governmental </p>
<p>structures, but this effort was “<b>dwarfed by a very large … often overambitious </b></p>
<p><b>US programme</b>” (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>24. </b> On Basra, the paper reported that officials had been undertaking a “major review of </p>
<p>policy” in MND(SE), following concern (shared by the US) that Basra was not on track </p>
<p>to meet the proposed transition timelines; that the ability of UK personnel to operate </p>
<p>effectively in MND(SE) was seriously constrained by the deteriorating security situation; </p>
<p>and that the UK had not done enough to ensure that its legacy in Basra would be a </p>
<p>strong contribution to delivering stability and increasing prosperity (see Section 9.4). </p>
<p><b>25. </b> The work to address those issues was split into four strands:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>political engagement with the Iraqi Government in Baghdad, with local politicians </p>
<p>in MND(SE) and with Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr; plus efforts by the PRT to support </p>
<p>provincial councils’ capacity to deliver quick wins;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a revised Basra Security Plan, including plans to increase the capacity of the </p>
<p>police (through increased mentoring, and the reform of the specialist crime units </p>
<p>– see Section 12.1) and improved intelligence on the situation in Basra;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthening the rule of law and governance structures, including securing </p>
<p>funding for improved criminal justice facilities (including from US and EU </p>
<p>sources); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further economic development and reconstruction, in particular through </p>
<p>helping Basra to access central government resources and a variety of both </p>
<p>short&#8209;term and longer&#8209;term local environmental and infrastructure projects </p>
<p>(see Section 10.2).</p>
<p><b>26. </b> An annex to the paper described the key elements of the Basra Security Plan. </p>
<p>Its purpose was defined as:</p>
<p>“… to remove the immunity and impunity that Governor of Basra’s patronage </p>
<p>provides to assassination squads, target the rogue Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM) leadership, </p>
<p>and target and reform corrupt police agencies.”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The objective of the operation was:</p>
<p>“Civil Authority successfully restored, an increasingly capable ISF in the lead </p>
<p>and continuing to prosecute operations through a combination of reassurance, </p>
<p>deterrence and attrition of insurgents, leading to Provincial Iraqi Control.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>28. </b> At their meeting on 15 June, members of DOP(I) agreed that Mr Browne should </p>
<p>take the lead in pulling together a strategy for Basra, with the support of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office and assistance from other departments.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> Mr Benn would monitor developments </p>
<p>on the electricity and power supply and Dr Kim Howells, FCO Minister of State for the </p>
<p>Middle East, would put forward proposals for supporting accelerated development of the </p>
<p>southern oil field. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> In discussion, a member of DOP(I) suggested that the Cabinet Office paper risked </p>
<p>being too optimistic on security prospects, in the light of recent Joint Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee (JIC) Assessments.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The JIC had assessed in May that a strong Sunni insurgency would persist beyond </p>
<p>2006.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> More recently, it had judged that the ISF would need MNF support beyond 2007 </p>
<p>(see Section 12.1).</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> On Sunday 18 June, the Iraqi Ministerial Committee on National Security (MCNS) </p>
<p>endorsed the Basra Security Plan and recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expanding the Basra Security Committee (established by Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>at the end of May) to include a number of Basrawis;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>appointing a new overall security co&#8209;ordinator for Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the Iraqi Ministries of the Interior and Defence should increase the forces </p>
<p>available for Basra, even if this was to the detriment of policing and military </p>
<p>operations elsewhere.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>32. </b> The Committee also considered whether the Basra Chief of Police and the </p>
<p>Commander of the Iraqi Army’s 10th Division should be removed from post but had </p>
<p>concluded they should remain for the time being.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> On 16 June, the JIC considered the impact that involvement in Iraq was having on </p>
<p>the threat to the UK from international terrorism. It judged that:</p>
<p>“Al Qaida still regards the US as its main enemy and prime target … In the West, </p>

<p> There was a lot of work still to be done, </p>
<p>including to negotiate the series of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs) that would </p>
<p>govern MND(SE)’s future support for the Iraqi Security Forces post&#8209;transition.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Three such MOUs were required, between:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MNF&#8209;I and the Iraqi Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government and the Governor of Muthanna; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Governor of Muthanna and MND(SE) – this one, in particular, needed to be </p>
<p>in place before transition could occur.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> A key provision in each MOU was definition of the circumstances in which the MNF </p>
<p>would re&#8209;engage in a province post&#8209;PIC. </p>
<p><b>37. </b> On 21 June the British Embassy Baghdad reported on the first week of the Baghdad </p>
<p>Security Plan.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> There were early signs that the plan was having a practical effect, with </p>
<p>a fall in attacks followed by a spike in Vehicle&#8209;Borne Improvised Explosive Devices </p>
<p>(VBIEDs) which again tailed off. It was “not yet clear whether the violence would </p>
<p>continue to drop or would settle at a new lower plateau”.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq from 18 to 22 June, travelling to both Baghdad and Basra </p>
<p>and meeting senior Iraqi figures including Prime Minister Maliki and Defence Minister </p>
<p>Qadir.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> The purpose of his visit was:</p>
<p>“… to drive the implementation of the new security plan for Basra – to get </p>
<p>assurances from key figures in the National Government that they will take </p>
<p>ownership of the plan, and to build working relationships with them so we can keep </p>
<p>that plan on track.”</p>
<p><b>39. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Mr Blair whilst in transit to Basra to tell him that the Ministerial </p>
<p>Committee on National Security had approved the Basra Security Plan and that Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki had announced that Muthanna would transition to PIC early. Mr Browne </p>
<p>“was able to follow it up with an extensive round of British, Iraqi and world media”. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The letter also sounded a note of caution, observing that “we should keep things </p>
<p>in perspective, and in particular not expect any immediate troop reductions”. Mr Browne </p>
<p>identified a parallel with Afghanistan, based on:</p>
<p>“… a tension between, on the one hand, our growing conviction that reconstruction </p>
<p>and better governance must be delivered alongside improved security, rather than </p>

<p>39</p>
<p> The record of the meeting said:</p>
<p>“We needed to look again at how we presented our arguments – including the </p>
<p>scope for reminding the US of Maliki’s statement that Maysan would transition </p>
<p>soon. Nick highlighted the risk that if Dhi Qar went ahead of Maysan there would </p>
<p>be a requirement for additional UK forces. The meeting agreed that this was not </p>
<p>acceptable, and that we would need to push the US hard in the next few weeks to </p>
<p>recognise this and the force of our arguments over Maysan and the Iranian border.”</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Vice Admiral Charles Style, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), told </p>
<p>the Iraq Strategy Group that appointing the new Basra security chief was “critical to </p>

<p><b>47. </b> On 4 July, Mr Browne wrote to Mr Blair to say that he intended to agree with DOP(I) </p>
<p>a range of projects to support a Better Basra Plan, costing £30.7m for the remainder of </p>
<p>the financial year, “a relatively small sum given the strategic importance of Basra”.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>48. </b> The projects would deliver: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “new unit to clean up the Basra police from within”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>on the spot mentoring of the Basra police and the regional prison managers;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new unit to fast&#8209;track corruption, organised and major crime cases through </p>
<p>Basra’s courts;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more training for judges; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>witness protection arrangements.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Overall, the aim of the programme was to “increase the capacity of the Iraqis </p>
<p>to deal with those detained by the Iraqi Security Forces and so avoid the legacy of </p>
<p>long&#8209;term detention of large numbers”. This work was intended to be combined with </p>
<p>“energetic implementation of the Basra Security Plan”. The projects on police reform and </p>
<p>reconstruction are considered in Sections 12.1 and 10.2.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>50. </b> On 4 July, Mr Blair told the House of Commons Liaison Committee that UK troops </p>
<p>would remain in Iraq:</p>
<p>“As long as the Government there wishes them to be there. I suspect over the next </p>
<p>18 months there will obviously be opportunities to draw down significant numbers of </p>
<p>British troops because the capacity of the Iraqi forces will build up.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>51. </b> When asked about Basra, Mr Blair agreed that some groups: </p>
<p>“… may use the presence of British forces as the excuse [for violence] but that </p>
<p>[driving British forces out] is not really their aim. Their aim is to get political and </p>
<p>security control of Basra so that they can run Basra rather than have the democratic </p>
<p>government run it.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>52. </b> On 6 July, DOP(I) discussed Mr Browne’s letter to Mr Blair and agreed his proposals </p>
<p>in principle.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mrs Margaret Beckett, who had been appointed as Foreign Secretary in May, and </p>
<p>Mr Hilary Benn, the International Development Secretary, said that their Iraq budgets </p>
<p>were fully committed, but were asked to look again at reprioritising their spending to fund </p>
<p>the Better Basra projects. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> In a phone call with President Bush on 7 July Mr Blair said that the key issue for the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government was to work out how to deal with militias: the ISF did not know how </p>
<p>to do so.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> His view was that the Iraqi Government urgently needed to show they were </p>
<p>making a difference on security, in Basra as well as in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Maj Gen Cooper reported on 7 July that he had discussed an alternative approach </p>
<p>to transition to PIC in Maysan with Gen Casey and General Peter Chiarelli, Commander </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Corps – Iraq (MNC&#8209;I).</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Maj Gen Cooper considered that it was necessary to re&#8209;posture UK forces in </p>
<p>Maysan, in light of the possibility of having to cover Dhi Qar province once Italian troops </p>
<p>had been withdrawn. Maj Gen Cooper believed that re&#8209;posturing prior to PIC would, in </p>
<p>his view, allow UK forces to “deliver greater effect along the border” and would “send a </p>
<p>signal that we were serious about handing back responsibility for security”. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> In his weekly report on 9 July, Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Senior British Military </p>

<p>and UK in assessing the readiness of provinces for PIC.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> He observed that the US </p>
<p>process was:</p>
<p>“… subject to exhaustive measurement, in contrast to the rather more judgemental </p>
<p>criteria we rely upon … it is what the Americans would regard as the absence of </p>
<p>empirical rigour which causes some divergence over the readiness of MND(SE) </p>
<p>provinces, particularly Maysan, to transition.</p>
<p>“In successive monthly assessments, MND(SE) has marked Maysan green across </p>
<p>all four transitional criteria. A separate Corps&#8209;level process has not shared this </p>
<p>judgement in the areas of threat assessment and governance, citing an increasing </p>
<p>complexity in attacks, cross&#8209;border penetration and the JAM sympathies of the </p>
<p>provincial governor. As a result, Chiarelli has not felt able to recommend Maysan </p>
<p>for PIC; a view shared by Casey, who has reached his own independent judgment </p>
<p>and is not simply supporting his subordinate commander. In answer to the </p>
<p>supplementary UK question – if not now, then when – both would reply that an equal </p>
<p>rhetorical case could be made for some of the intractably difficult areas under US </p>
<p>control and vacating the battlespace is not an appropriate response to an increasing </p>
<p>cross&#8209;border threat. The danger in all this is that, unless we change the terms of </p>
<p>engagement, we risk a dialogue of the deaf and a loss of confidence in the integrity </p>
<p>of our reporting.”</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Lt Gen Fry considered that the proposal to re&#8209;posture in Maysan before transition </p>
<p>to PIC would “allow considerable savings in force levels” and would remove the need </p>
<p>to sequence the transition arrangements in Maysan and Dhi Qar around UK force levels. </p>
<p>He reported that Gen Casey was “willing to let the proposal run so long as two criteria </p>
<p>are satisfied: we retain a handle on JAM intentions, and we create a persistent flank </p>
<p>guard effect against the Iranian border”.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Browne’s Private Secretary on 10 July </p>
<p>to report that the Prime Minister was “very concerned at the recent attack statistics”, </p>
<p>particularly the “widely reported sectarian killings” in Baghdad.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Blair judged that “overcoming the evident lack of engagement against the </p>
<p>militias by the Iraqi government and security forces is a major strategic task”. As well </p>
<p>as continuing to press the Iraqi Government to take action, it was important for the UK </p>
<p>to “have a clearer view of what action is required, to complement and make up for the </p>
<p>shortcomings of the current Baghdad and Basra security plans”. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> In addition, Mr Blair was concerned that the evidence demonstrated that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces were not as capable as had previously been assessed. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary asked for immediate advice from Lt Gen Fry on what </p>
<p>action Prime Minister Maliki needed to take, and more detailed advice later that week </p>
<p>on how to address the shortcomings of the ISF. </p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary replied the following day, attaching advice from </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> He advised that Mr Blair should press Prime Minister Maliki to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re&#8209;emphasise the theme of national unity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>carry out “vigorous internal reform” of the Ministry of Interior and sack those </p>
<p>engaged in militia activity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agree a plan to engage the militia politically and militarily;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re&#8209;vamp the Baghdad Security Plan to create “a localised effect by concentrating </p>
<p>force in a specific area” which could then be expanded; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tell Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr that he must choose between politics and “populist </p>
<p>adventurism”. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> Lt Gen Fry advised that in Basra the structure needed to oversee the Security Plan </p>
<p>must be established and allowed to act independently, with broad political guidance, to </p>
<p>“prevent the over&#8209;centralisation of powers” which was open to abuse. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> By the time Major General Richard Shirreff took over as GOC MND(SE) in mid&#8209;July, </p>
<p>there had not yet been agreement on the implementation arrangements of the Basra </p>
<p>Security Plan.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> In particular no overall Iraqi security co&#8209;ordinator had been appointed. </p>
<p>The Provincial Council, however, had voted to replace the Basra Chief of Police.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Richard Shirreff told the Inquiry that his objective had been </p>
<p>to achieve PIC in the four provinces within MND(SE).</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> In order to achieve this, his </p>
<p>“overriding preoccupation was to establish security”. He explained that, when he arrived </p>
<p>there was “effectively no security at all”, with movement significantly constrained and </p>
<p>“a significant lack of troops on the ground”. He continued:</p>
<p>“The result of all that was what I call a cycle of insecurity. No security meant no </p>
<p>reconstruction and development. It meant a loss of consent, the militia filled the gap </p>
<p>and, effectively, the militia controlled the city. So my objective was to re&#8209;establish </p>
<p>security in Basra.”</p>
<p><b>67. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that his sense had been that the overriding theme in </p>
<p>the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) was accelerated transition and “the gravity of </p>
<p>the [security] situation was not fully appreciated”.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> He concluded that “the focus was to </p>
<p>exit rather than achieving adequate success”.</p>

<p><b>68. </b> On 13 July, at the request of the FCO, the JIC assessed Iran’s involvement and </p>
<p>intentions in Iraq.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“Iran has multiple objectives in Iraq and a number of instruments to pursue them. </p>
<p>It wants an Iraq that is unified and stable, led by a Shia government which is friendly </p>
<p>to Iran and open to Iranian political and commercial influence. It also wants the </p>
<p>Multinational Forces (MNF) to leave, and to make life as difficult as possible for them </p>
<p>in the meantime, even if this increases instability.”</p>
<p><b>69. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The Iranian leadership is encouraging stability through its support for reconstruction </p>
<p>(it has negotiated a $1 billion credit line for reconstruction activities) and for the </p>
<p>political process … But at the same time they are increasing instability through </p>
<p>support for Shia militias.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> The JIC judged that support to militias meant:</p>
<p>“Iran continues to provide military technology and training to Iraqi Shia who it knows </p>
<p>will attack the MNF: it does not need to give them specific direction.”</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Sir John Scarlett, Chairman of the JIC between September 2001 and July 2004, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry that the JIC’s assessments of Iran’s involvement in Iraq became “significantly </p>
<p>tougher” from September 2004 onwards, “reaching a sort of high point in the summer </p>
<p>and autumn of 2006”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Tim Dowse, Chief of the Assessments Staff between November 2003 and May </p>
<p>2009, told the Inquiry that the JIC had “spent a lot of time, from really the very beginning, </p>
<p>trying to fathom out what the Iranians were up to”.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> He added, “I think we started this </p>
<p>whole period with a reluctance to see an Iranian hand.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Dowse did not agree with Mr Blair’s suggestion that Iran was deliberately trying </p>
<p>to destabilise Iraq. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I don’t think we saw evidence that the Iranians regarded Shia&#8209;led Iraq as a rival for </p>
<p>support in the Shia world.”</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Dowse reminded the Inquiry that the Iranians had made quite a significant </p>
<p>constructive contribution to reconstructing Iraq and were very concerned about the </p>
<p>security of their pilgrims travelling to Iraq: “But at the same time they absolutely did </p>
<p>not want to have a western military presence there. So … they saw no contradiction </p>
<p>particularly with supporting the JAM.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>76. </b> Maj Gen Cooper reported that Prime Minister Maliki attended the transfer ceremony, </p>
<p>at which he and the Governor had signed an MOU.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Once signed:</p>
<p>“We [UK forces] are now in Operational Overwatch in Muthanna. We will begin the </p>
<p>long term monitoring and mentoring of the ISF, continue leadership engagement and </p>
<p>maintain situational awareness. I have agreed that we will now have a period of a </p>
<p>full week when we will participate in no activities in order to allow the physical reality </p>
<p>of PIC to be registered in the province …”</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Maj Gen Cooper’s negotiations with the Governor of Muthanna on the MOU had </p>
<p>continued right up to the point of transfer, but the Governor’s concerns had eventually </p>
<p>been resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Shortly after the Muthanna transfer, Lt Gen Fry reported on:</p>
<p>“An interesting week in which a strategic design for coalition disengagement has </p>
<p>begun to emerge at the same time as decisions on the tactical reinforcement of the </p>
<p>US presence in Baghdad have been made in response to a deteriorating security </p>
<p>situation. The casual observer could be forgiven for being confused …”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>79. </b> In a meeting with President Bush in the margins of a G8 summit in St Petersburg on </p>
<p>16 July, Mr Blair said that US plans to surge troops into Baghdad were “important” and </p>
<p>described the recent spate of sectarian killings as “horrific”.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> It was also important, in his </p>
<p>view, for Prime Minister Maliki to empower the ISF to tackle militias. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> The question of whether Iraq was experiencing, or heading towards, civil war had </p>
<p>been widely discussed since the departure of the Coalition Provisional Authority in </p>
<p>June 2004. </p>
<p><b>81. </b> Lt Gen Fry addressed the issue in his 16 July weekly report: </p>
<p>“Is this civil war? Technically no: the institutions of the state are still intact, </p>
<p>violence is localised and there are more displaced people in New Orleans than </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> But a 98 percent increase in civilian casualties in the last three months </p>
<p>tells its own story … A general condition exists which is less than civil war, but </p>
<p>a localised condition exists in Baghdad, Diyala and parts of Salah ad Din where </p>
<p>state institutions have only marginal effect, elements of the security apparatus are </p>

<p>to be a running feature of the editorial pages.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>82. </b> In Lt Gen Fry’s view, the coalition faced some big decisions about how to address </p>
<p>the problems it faced, namely:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an entrenched Sunni insurgency, with greater links to AQ; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increasing sectarian violence which might be partly prompted by Shia extremists </p>
<p>seeking to exacerbate Sunni alienation in order to avoid the Shia having to share </p>
<p>power. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> Lt Gen Fry reached two conclusions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The point might have been reached where the Global War On Terror and the </p>
<p>Iraq campaign were in conflict, as the campaign against AQ&#8209;I was indirectly </p>
<p>helping achieve Shia political ambitions by further alienating the Sunni </p>
<p>community and fuelling their disaffection with the political process.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need to “rapidly equalise the campaign effect in both communities </p>
<p>by deliberate offensive action against the Shia ‘death squads’”.</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Blair annotated these conclusions – “quite right”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>85. </b> On 19 July, at the request of the MOD, the JIC examined changes in the nature </p>
<p>of violence in Iraq.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The JIC’s first Key Judgement was:</p>
<p>“I. The security situation is growing in complexity. In addition to insurgents, local </p>
<p>struggles for political and economic power, sectarian extremists and criminals are </p>
<p>all exploiting declining security. Spiralling sectarian violence is the most immediate </p>
<p>threat to Iraq’s progress. Deteriorating security is outpacing the government’s ability </p>
<p>to respond: violence is at the highest sustained level since April 2003. Most is still </p>
<p>in the Sunni heartlands and Baghdad, but it is also increasing in pockets elsewhere </p>
<p>(including Basra).”</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The JIC also judged:</p>
<p>“II. A virulent Sunni Arab nationalist insurgency continues. The Multi&#8209;National Forces </p>
<p>(MNF) continue to bear the brunt of their attacks. A minority of Sunni insurgents is </p>
<p>engaged in talks with the coalition and the Iraqi government, but the commitment of </p>
<p>the majority of insurgents to a violent campaign is largely undiminished. Intensifying </p>
<p>sectarian violence is strengthening the unwillingness of many to give up their </p>

<p>now blurred.”</p>
<p><b>88. </b> The JIC assessed that AQ&#8209;I remained the largest single insurgent network. But the </p>
<p>impact of Abu Musab al&#8209;Zarqawi’s death had been short&#8209;lived. His successor, Abu Ayyub </p>
<p>al&#8209;Masri, was expected to continue al&#8209;Zarqawi’s strategy and tactics:</p>
<p>“… including his campaign of attacks on the Shia to foment a civil war which is </p>
<p>starting to get results.”</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Mr Browne described the Shia violence in southern Iraq to the Inquiry as </p>
<p>“a competition for influence and resources” that the UK was clear would need to </p>
<p>be resolved by a combination of Iraqi politics and the Iraqi security forces.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>90. </b> Mr Browne told the Inquiry that he had invested considerable time drawing the </p>
<p>attention of the Iraqi Government to the need to address the problems in the South. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki had given an undertaking that he would deal with the situation </p>
<p>and deploy the necessary resources but “his machinery of government was not always </p>
<p>capable of delivering that, and he had the additional problem … that the Provincial </p>
<p>Council in Basra, at the time … did not function properly on occasions”.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> On 20 July, Mr Patey sent a valedictory telegram.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> It opened with the summary </p>
<p>“Strategic failure in Iraq a distinct possibility but not inevitable.” </p>
<p><b>92. </b> Mr Patey continued:</p>
<p>“The prospect of a low intensity civil war and de facto division of Iraq is probably </p>
<p>more likely at this stage than a successful and sustained transition to a stable </p>
<p>democracy … </p>
<p>“Since the transfer of sovereignty in 2004 we have made considerable progress </p>
<p>in developing the political process … But the process itself has also exposed the </p>
<p>sectarian divisions in the country …</p>
<p>“The current levels of violence are as high as they have ever been and the </p>
<p>increasingly bold and sectarian nature of the violence is the most troubling aspect. </p>
<p>There is little doubt (and this analysis is shared by most Iraqis) that the precipitate </p>
<p>departure of coalition forces from Iraq would lead to open civil war …”</p>
<p><b>93. </b> Looking ahead, Mr Patey wrote:</p>
<p>“But the position is not hopeless … Our strategy must be to get the Iraqis to </p>
<p>increasingly take the lead and responsibility. This will produce some uncomfortable </p>
<p>moments but in the long run is the only solution … It should be possible to ensure </p>

<p>that the Iraqi Government has a near monopoly of force by the time the coalition </p>
<p>withdraws the bulk of our forces … </p>
<p>“We will through our continued presence over the next few years need to provide </p>
<p>the Iraqis with the necessary breathing space to build up their capabilities … We will </p>
<p>need to be careful to avoid the impression that we are ready to take on Shia militias </p>
<p>in order to restore Sunni dominance …</p>
<p>“If we are to avoid a descent into civil war and anarchy then preventing the Jaysh </p>
<p>al Mahdi (JAM) from developing into a state within a state, as Hizballah has done </p>
<p>in Lebanon, will be a priority … Our efforts must be in support of a clear Iraqi </p>
<p>Government strategy and we should avoid getting into a position where we are </p>
<p>seen to be confronting the militias alone.”</p>
<p><b>94. </b> Mr Patey concluded:</p>
<p>“This is a 5&#8209;10 year project and it will be messy and difficult … The consequences </p>
<p>of failure are very high indeed. We need to get the balance right about assuring our </p>
<p>friends that we will not abandon them and a credible exit strategy. Too much talk of </p>
<p>an early exit could weaken our position.”</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Commenting on Mr Patey’s telegram, Lt Gen Fry observed:</p>
<p>“I would place the betting on national break&#8209;up or democratic transition at closer </p>
<p>to evens, but William captures the all to play for atmosphere of the moment.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>96. </b> In Lt Gen Fry’s opinion, although “in technical terms” there was not a civil war, he </p>
<p>increasingly suspected that “what is being fought in the Baghdad – Baqubah corridor </p>
<p>is a civil war in cameo, with implications which extend well beyond the immediate </p>
<p>battlefield … The battle for Baghdad therefore becomes the battle for Iraq, and </p>
<p>maybe more.”</p>

<p><b>97. </b> In his first weekly report on 21 July, Maj Gen Shirreff assessed: “I cannot see how, </p>
<p>given the level of attacks against coalition forces, we can claim that Maysan is green … </p>
<p>in my view it is at best yellow.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> He judged:</p>
<p>“The only way we will get to green is by removing the problem, which means </p>
<p>extracting ourselves as quickly as possible from Camp Abu Naji which acts as </p>
<p>nothing more than a tethered goat for attacks out of al&#8209;Amara. I do not intend to </p>
<p>occupy Camp Sparrowhawk, an idea whose time has passed and another tethered </p>
<p>goat in the making. I will retain a presence in Maysan but, instead, focus on the key </p>
<p>issues: disruption and interdiction on the border, while, at the same time, continuing </p>
<p>the SSR [Security Sector Reform] effort to get the Province to green.”</p>

<p>20</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff also set out his initial reflections on the situation facing him. </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“The issue in Basra is the lack of security and until we establish this there can be no </p>
<p>PIC. We can only generate freedom of movement by mounting specific operations, </p>
<p>often up to company level, and we are effectively fixed by the lack of concentrated </p>
<p>force. The lack of security means that we cannot conduct the SSR needed to </p>
<p>transform the police, nor apply the economic inducements needed to isolate the </p>
<p>militants from the majority of militiamen who are only there because the militia can </p>
<p>pay them. Thus the enemy, militant JAM and the death squads linked to the Basra </p>
<p>police … are able to operate with relative impunity … </p>
<p>“In my view, the only way we will achieve mission success is by winning the battle </p>
<p>for Basra and defeating militant JAM and the death squads (whether by capturing, </p>
<p>or, if necessary, by killing them in accordance with our ROE [Rules of Engagement]. </p>
<p>But we must be clever about it. A blunt, solely kinetic approach risks getting sucked </p>
<p>into a series of running tactical battles against JAM that will get us nowhere. We </p>
<p>must isolate militant JAM from mainstream JAM and build the intelligence picture in </p>
<p>order to target them and the death squads connected to the police in Basra. The key </p>
<p>to this is energetic and sustained effort along the governance and economic lines of </p>
<p>operation, both of which remain inadequate … (the comprehensive approach did not </p>
<p>exist). Progress on these lines is essential to create and maintain tolerance for our </p>
<p>operations in Basra. It will also underwrite success on the security line of operation. </p>
<p>There has been plenty of planning but we need to make things happen.”</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff reported that he had had some preliminary encouraging </p>
<p>discussions about his proposed approach with Major General Latif, the commander </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Army’s 10th Division, based in Basra. However, it would be fundamental to </p>
<p>ensure that, behind any operation, there was political will in Baghdad. Maj Gen Shirreff </p>
<p>undertook to work closely with Mr Patey and the MNF commanders in Baghdad “to </p>
<p>ensure that we carry Maliki with us”.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> Prime Minister Maliki visited London on 24 July, before travelling on to the US.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>101. </b> A telegram from Mr Patey reported:</p>
<p>“He [Maliki] told me that he would focus during his visit on security and the economy, </p>
<p>as well as cementing long&#8209;term bilateral relations. He said he needed Iraqi forces </p>
<p>that can take on the terrorists.”</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Prime Minister Maliki visited No.10 for a bilateral meeting with Mr Blair followed </p>

<p>Sadrists and the Sunni insurgents”. Mr Blair “urged him to set out a plan that made clear </p>
<p>what they needed to do, and by when”. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> On Baghdad:</p>
<p>“… Maliki said he was considering a one month amnesty for the militia elements. </p>
<p>After that there would be no compromise, and he would give the ISF clear authority </p>
<p>to deal with those who continued to defy the Government. The Prime Minister </p>
<p>welcomed this – action had to be taken against the death squads, and a clear </p>
<p>political signal given to the ISF that they should go after them with all necessary </p>
<p>means.”</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Prime Minister Maliki said that he was committed to dealing with Basra’s problems:</p>
<p>“The committee he had established to take forward the security plan was reporting </p>
<p>directly to him, and he denied that it was sectarian in its approach. He emphasises </p>
<p>the importance of strengthening the ISF so that arrests were made by Iraqi, not </p>
<p>British, forces. But he also commented that the police force was hopelessly corrupt.” </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Blair discussed Iraq briefly with President Bush on 26 July, and exchanged </p>
<p>reports on their recent meetings with Prime Minister Maliki, who had visited both London </p>
<p>and Washington that week.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> Mr Blair said he had made it clear to Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>that he must tackle the death squads operating in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> On 26 July, the JIC considered how the Sadrist militia, Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM), was </p>
<p>likely to react to pressure.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>107. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I. Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi is not a monolithic or disciplined organisation. Some elements are </p>
<p>responsible for the worst Shia sectarian atrocities. Limited and targeted detention </p>
<p>operations against the perpetrators are militarily achievable and would be locally </p>
<p>disruptive. They would have a temporary impact on the overall scale of sectarian </p>
<p>violence. </p>
<p>“II. Any perception that a wider assault on JAM had begun would be likely to </p>
<p>provoke fierce resistance. Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr’s reaction even to further limited arrests </p>
<p>is unpredictable … If he felt personally threatened he might order a return to </p>
<p>large&#8209;scale violence. </p>
<p>“III. Al&#8209;Sadr’s reponse might be constrained if robust action was led by the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government and security forces (ISF). But even limited detentions will need </p>
<p>unequivocal public support from Prime Minister Maliki, key government ministers </p>
<p>and other senior Shia figures. Maliki’s commitment to achieving the necessary </p>

<p>backing is uncertain. The willingness and ability of the ISF to take on the JAM is also </p>
<p>in doubt.”</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The JIC assessed that the strength of JAM was uncertain. MNF estimates placed </p>
<p>it at 10,000 active supporters plus 20,000 sympathisers who could be mobilised rapidly. </p>
<p>Capabilities varied. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> On 27 July, the Iraq Policy Unit (IPU) responded to Mr Patey’s valedictory telegram:</p>
<p>“We agree that, in the face of the challenges you describe, our best course is to hold </p>
<p>our nerve and stick broadly to our current strategy. We should resist the argument </p>
<p>that the right response to the current difficulties is to plan to prolong our military </p>
<p>presence. To do so would only entrench the dependency culture we are working to </p>
<p>wean Iraq off, and rob us of an acceptable exit strategy.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>110. </b> On 27 July, the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) reflected on reporting from Baghdad, </p>
<p>and its implications for the existing strategy.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> The Group agreed that, although success </p>
<p>or failure in Baghdad would be critical to overall campaign success in Iraq and was </p>
<p>therefore the coalition’s highest priority, the “best way for the UK to contribute to the </p>
<p>wider military campaign was to continue to focus our limited resources on MND(SE), </p>
<p>in particular, on Basra”. </p>
<p><b>111. </b> But in Basra:</p>
<p>“The extent to which … the Iraqi Government would allow us to be robust was </p>
<p>a concern.” </p>
<p><b>112. </b> The ISG agreed that the UK should:</p>
<p>“… press the Iraqis and US to maintain momentum of security transition … More </p>
<p>broadly, we should firmly resist any US suggestion … that the current problems </p>
<p>meant that we should put more resources into Iraq, and plan to stay longer. Sending </p>
<p>this message risked perpetuating the current Iraqi dependency culture, and robbing </p>
<p>us of any perspective</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> of military withdrawal in an acceptable timeframe. We </p>
<p>recognised, however, that the success of this strategy would depend entirely on the </p>
<p>readiness of the Iraqi security forces to take over the job. We would need to make </p>
<p>a critical judgement on this in the autumn.”</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Mr Martin Dinham, DFID Director, Europe, Middle East and the Americas, proposed </p>
<p>that the UK should focus its future support to Iraq on central government – in particular </p>

<p> An additional 4,500 Iraqi troops would also be </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>August 2006</b></p>
<p><b>118. </b> At a meeting of the Chiefs of Staff on 2 August, Lieutenant General Nicholas </p>
<p>Houghton, Chief of Joint Operations, asked Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of </p>
<p>the Defence Staff, for direction on two particular issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent to which US capabilities could be used in MND(SE) in order to </p>
<p>provide surge capacity for Operation SALAMANCA (the name of the operation </p>
<p>to implement the military elements of the Basra Security Plan); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of deployment of UK forces outside MND(SE), specifically a </p>
<p>deployment to Multi&#8209;National Division (Centre&#8209;South) to support the US who </p>
<p>were “taking risk in CS to deliver the Baghdad Security Plan”.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>119. </b> ACM Stirrup directed that it was acceptable for the UK to make use of US </p>
<p>enablers, such as aviation in MND(SE) but that, in general, commitments in MND(SE) </p>
<p>were to be met by existing MND(SE) personnel (including contractors) and any shortfalls </p>
<p>were to be identified and considered appropriately. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> ACM Stirrup also directed that the deployment of UK troops to MND(CS): </p>
<p>“… crossed a clear policy ‘red line’ and seemed counter&#8209;intuitive, given that </p>
<p>consideration was also being given to obtaining US forces for MND(SE). The UK </p>
<p>needed to draw down its force levels as soon as practicable, both in MND(SE) and </p>
<p>elsewhere.”</p>
<p><b>121. </b> On 4 August, a Current Intelligence Group (CIG) considered the potential threat </p>
<p>to UK forces in Iraq in the context of the Israel/Lebanon crisis, and judged that:</p>
<p>“… Shia frustration with Multinational Forces (MNF) has increased significantly since </p>
<p>the first part of the year. This is likely to be manifested in violent demonstrations </p>
<p>against MNF. Against this background, any anti&#8209;MNF attacks prompted by perceived </p>
<p>US or UK support for Israel’s actions in Lebanon will be difficult to distinguish from </p>
<p>the wider existing threat …”</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>The 2006 Lebanon War</b></p>
<p>The 2006 Lebanon War began with the deaths of eight Israeli soldiers, and the abduction </p>
<p>of a further two, in a cross&#8209;border Hizballah ambush.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> This led to Israeli attacks, using air </p>
<p>strikes and artillery, against a range of targets in Lebanon. </p>
<p>In response, Hizballah fired rockets into northern Israel. There was also heavy fighting in </p>
<p>southern Lebanon following an Israeli invasion. </p>

<p>25</p>
<p>On 11 August, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1701 which provided a basis </p>
<p>for ending the conflict.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The BBC put the numbers killed during the conflict at:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1,109 Lebanese civilians and 28 soldiers; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>43 Israeli civilians and 116 soldiers.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An unknown number of Hizballah fighters (estimated to be between 250 and 530) were </p>
<p>also killed. </p>
<p>In a press conference with President Bush on 28 July, Mr Blair blamed Hizballah for </p>
<p>provoking the crisis.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his memoir, Mr Blair described the war as part of the “wider struggle between the strain </p>
<p>of religious extremism in Islam and the rest of us”.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> For that reason, he said, “If I had </p>
<p>condemned Israel, it would have been more than dishonest; it would have undermined the </p>
<p>world view I had come to hold passionately.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> On 6 August, Lt Gen Fry suggested that Israeli military action in Lebanon was </p>
<p>having an impact in Iraq:</p>
<p>“… particularly in terms of a collective Shia identity and the hardening of </p>
<p>confessional boundaries … What is clear, though, is that moderation is a difficult </p>
<p>position to defend in an increasingly febrile atmosphere … If the US can be labelled </p>
<p>with a vicarious responsibility for Israeli action, the position of the radical Shia will be </p>
<p>strengthened, with clear implications for both tolerance of a coalition presence and </p>
<p>the process of reconciliation.”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>123. </b> Lt Gen Fry also suggested that the security situation might be improving – or at </p>
<p>least giving the superficial appearance of improvement, with the further implementation </p>
<p>of the Baghdad Security Plan “but it is a crisis deferred rather than defused and it has </p>
<p>the potential to return again after Ramadan in a more virulent form”. </p>
<p><b>124. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff advised the Governor of Maysan of the UK’s re&#8209;posturing plans </p>
<p>on 9 August.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>125. </b> The Governor was:</p>
<p>“… genuinely surprised, but understood the opportunities it offers. He is clear that </p>
<p>it is not a withdrawal and that I will retain a presence with a particular focus on </p>
<p>the Border.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff also reported on 10 August that Maj Gen Hamadi had been </p>
<p>appointed as the security co&#8209;ordinator for Basra and had been given appropriate </p>
<p>authority over the ISF. Maj Gen Shirreff considered that there were “two key </p>
<p>prerequisites” to success for Op SALAMANCA:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>delivering “a number of niche capabilities”, about which he had submitted his </p>
<p>preliminary analysis to PJHQ; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>getting Iraqi policing and military buy&#8209;in, which, in his view, was likely to be the </p>
<p>more difficult.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff wrote:</p>
<p>“Fundamental to my concept is the variable application (depending on the district </p>
<p>of the City) of J3 (operations – kinetic if necessary), J7 (SSR) and J9 (the integration </p>
<p>of short, medium and long term projects) to ensure that the people of Basra perceive </p>
<p>that the situation is getting better; very much the comprehensive approach. My aim </p>
<p>is to colour Basra green by district in order to get PIC.”</p>
<p><b>The House of Commons Defence Committee’s Report</b></p>
<p>The House of Commons Select Committee on Defence published a report on 10 August </p>
<p>that focused on issues raised with Committee members by Service Personnel when they </p>
<p>visited Iraq in June 2006.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> The principal areas of concern were the security situation in </p>
<p>MND(SE) and the continuing need for the deployment of UK Armed Forces; shortcomings </p>
<p>in the provision and suitability of equipment (see Section 14.1); and the hardships and </p>
<p>inconveniences endured by troops (see Section 16.1). </p>
<p>The Committee recognised that the security situation in MND(SE) was more benign than </p>
<p>elsewhere in Iraq. Transition to PIC in Muthanna was a positive step although the key </p>
<p>test would be achieving the same in Basra, where there were “significant obstacles”. </p>
<p>It expressed concern at the recent increase in violence in the South East due to local </p>
<p>political struggles for power; and about the differing assessments that it had been given </p>
<p>about the extent to which IEDs were being smuggled into Iraq from Iran.</p>
<p>The Committee observed that Security Sector Reform (see Section 12.1) would be crucial </p>
<p>to drawdown and to the eventual withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq. There remained </p>
<p>serious challenges, especially with the Iraqi police. It also considered that the future </p>
<p>stability of Iraq would depend on reconstruction of the economy and suggested that the </p>
<p>Government should consider whether there should be an injection of additional funding to </p>
<p>assist the Basra Provincial Reconstruction Team.</p>
<p>The Government’s response, issued in October 2006, emphasised that the role of MNF, </p>
<p>including UK, troops was to “hold the security ring” pending the development of ISF </p>

<p>capability.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> It endorsed the Committee’s opinion that the Iraqi Government in Baghdad </p>
<p>should maintain its interest in Basra and the wider region. </p>
<p>On border security the Government response advised that the Government of Iraq had </p>
<p>recently pressed the Iranian Government to cut any links with armed groups operating in </p>
<p>Iraq and to do more to improve border security and fight terrorism. UK forces were training </p>
<p>the Iraqi Department of Border Enforcement in Maysan province, which was providing a </p>
<p>visible presence on known smuggling routes. The UK was encouraging Iraqi responsibility </p>
<p>for maritime security, including deterrence and disruption of piracy, smuggling and terrorist </p>
<p>activity. Iraqi forces were supported in this role by a significant coalition presence, and </p>
<p>were increasingly operating in collaboration with their Kuwaiti partners.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> On 23 August, Maj Gen Shirreff reported that:</p>
<p>“… the redeployment of the Maysan Battlegroup is now complete and CAN [Camp </p>
<p>Abu Naji], the focus of so much fighting over the last three years, is now closed and </p>
<p>handed over to the IA [Iraqi Army]. This has been a demanding and well&#8209;executed </p>
<p>operation and considerable credit is due to those involved. The final convoy returns </p>
<p>to SLB [Shaiba Logistics Base] on the evening of 24 August.”</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff reported that he had briefed Maj Gen Hamadi on Op </p>
<p>SALAMANCA, emphasising that “we are implementing the Basra Security plan as </p>
<p>agreed by Prime Minister Maliki rather than anything new or different”. Maj Gen Hamadi </p>
<p>had “bought in” to the plan.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that he also had to get the approval of the Iraqi </p>
<p>authorities in Baghdad, which he described as “a very lengthy, rather tortuous process”.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Once this approval was obtained, Gen Casey offered the UK a battalion from his Corps </p>
<p>operational reserve.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>131. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that “the idea of American troops on the streets of </p>
<p>Basra did not go down particularly well in London”, and no US troops were involved. The </p>
<p>US did, however, provide some surveillance assets, and significant amounts of funding – </p>
<p>by the end of the operation US$80m had been spent. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>132. </b> On 23 August, at the request of the Iraq Senior Officials Group, the JIC looked </p>
<p>specifically at the threat posed by militias in Iraq, their popular support and the prospects </p>
<p>for disarmament, de&#8209;mobilisation and reintegration.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“Violence in Iraq is part of a vicious cycle: deteriorating security has led to a </p>
<p>proliferation of militias, in turn fuelling further violence. The threat from these armed </p>
<p>groups is multi&#8209;dimensional. The scale is difficult to judge … Many are sectarian </p>
<p>based … and are competing with the Iraqi state’s security forces to provide security </p>
<p>and protection for their own communities … Some elements are engaged in violent </p>
<p>attacks against their political and sectarian opponents and coalition forces; others </p>
<p>are also involved in criminality … Weapons are readily available.</p>
<p>“Most Iraqi political parties across the sectarian spectrum maintain a militia of some </p>
<p>sort. Some, including the Kurdish Peshmerga, pose no immediate military threat to </p>
<p>the Multinational Forces (MNF) or Iraqi internal stability … But elements of Muqtada </p>
<p>al&#8209;Sadr’s Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM) are driving sectarian violence and attacking the </p>
<p>MNF. In some cases, the distinction between the militias and Iraqi Security Forces </p>
<p>(ISF) is blurred.” </p>
<p><b>133. </b> The Assessment included a table listing the size of the main militias in Iraq. The </p>
<p>JIC judged that the largest group was the Kurdish Peshmerga with 80,000 – 90,000 </p>
<p>members, followed by the Badr Corps with 10,000 – 13,000 members and JAM with </p>
<p>10,000 members. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> The JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“Iraqi political commitment for more vigorous action – against JAM in particular – </p>
<p>is uncertain … We judge Maliki is … unable to confront the militias, fearing a violent </p>
<p>backlash that would threaten the break&#8209;up of the Shia political coalition (the UIA). </p>
<p>We continue to judge that any perception among JAM that a widespread assault </p>
<p>against them had begun, particularly if fronted by the MNF, would provoke fierce </p>
<p>resistance. It would also increase Shia hostility to the coalition: the inability of the </p>
<p>MNF and ISF to protect them against Sunni extremists has meant that many Shia </p>
<p>regard JAM as their defenders, particularly in mixed areas.”</p>
<p><b>135. </b> On 24 August, advice on Op SALAMANCA, including a request for approval of </p>
<p>a temporary uplift of 360 troops, was sent to Mr Browne.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>136. </b> The advice explained that the operation:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Is a plan to improve Basra through operations, high impact reconstruction and </p>
<p>SSR commencing in mid&#8209;September and lasting for up to six months;</p>

<p>with intelligence gathering;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Requires an uplift in personnel for up to four months …”</p>
<p><b>137. </b> The advice gave a broad outline of the plan:</p>
<p>“The city is divided into segments characterised by the level of consent for MNF and </p>
<p>ISF. Taking each segment in turn a security pulse is applied for up to 48 hours, which </p>
<p>may include increased patrolling by ISF and MNF, car bans and curfews, and may </p>
<p>be accompanied by surgical detention operations against key targets. The follow on </p>
<p>activity focuses on SSR of the IPS and DBE [Department of Border Enforcement], </p>
<p>and localised reconstruction using Iraqi contractors and lasts for about 30 days, </p>
<p>during which security is provided by an IA [Iraqi Army] framework operation … </p>
<p>“A key ingredient in the operation will be PM Maliki’s support for operations against </p>
<p>rogue elements of the JAM. To this end, Secretary of State is requested to discuss </p>
<p>this point with Maliki during his visit, highlighting the need for his concurrence and </p>
<p>active support, despite the potential local backlash.”</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Mr Browne deferred his decision on the uplift of troops until after he had been </p>
<p>updated during his visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>139. </b> Mr Browne visited Baghdad from 27 to 29 August and then travelled to Basra.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Baghdad, “interlocutors detected an improvement in Basra security and the role </p>
<p>of MND(SE) in achieving this”. The British Embassy Baghdad observed “the note of </p>
<p>optimism, albeit cautious … was striking. It reflects the early successes of the BdSP </p>
<p>[Baghdad Security Plan] and a sense that the plan mapped out is achievable.”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Browne met the Defence and Interior Ministers and Prime Minister Maliki, who </p>
<p>“expressed delight” when talked through the projects MND(SE) was about to launch and </p>
<p>confirmed that Maj Gen Hamadi reported directly to him and was not subordinate to the </p>
<p>Governor of Basra. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>on Basra, probably in mid&#8209;2007. The immature ISF is being pushed into the lead </p>
<p>when it may not be ready; we are playing for high stakes if it fails. The Maliki </p>
<p>government is less than a band of brothers, but it’s what we’ve got and it deserves </p>
<p>our support. Violence reached a crescendo in July before decisive US intervention; </p>
<p>the level of sectarian ambition may be changing as the Shia are tempted to think </p>
<p>they can win. Casey regards the battle for Baghdad as the battle for Iraq and </p>
<p>identifies the period to the end of the year as decisive.”</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Of the situation in MND(SE), Lt Gen Fry observed that, PIC in Maysan and the </p>
<p>reduction of troop levels in Basra by mid&#8209;2007: </p>
<p>“… may mark the beginning of the most difficult phase of the campaign as we will </p>
<p>be required to maintain operational overwatch across a large area, for which we will </p>
<p>have little tactical feel, for an unspecified period and against an uncertain political </p>
<p>backdrop. At the same time, we will have to deliver a recalcitrant Basra Province </p>
<p>to PIC with a limited force confronting, potentially, a series of concurrent liabilities </p>
<p>within the extended AOR [Area of Responsibility].”</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Lt Gen Fry considered that a key political priority was for Prime Minister Maliki to </p>
<p>begin taking forward legislation to resolve the issues that were set aside in the drafting </p>
<p>of the Constitution. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> Those issues were “the most divisive in Iraqi politics and have the capacity to </p>
<p>bring about sectarian political confrontation; with that comes the risk of another round of </p>
<p>inter&#8209;confessional violence”. There was a “very ambitious timetable” for resolving them </p>
<p>before a referendum in the spring due to “an American ambition to test the capacity of </p>
<p>immature Iraqi institutions by pushing them aggressively forward”.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> In an addendum to his main post&#8209;tour report, Lt Gen Fry reported that “Sunni </p>
<p>engagement is back on”, something he attributed to the success of the Baghdad </p>
<p>Security Plan, and that there were plans to develop “JAM engagement” as part of the </p>
<p>final stages of that Plan.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>September 2006</b></p>
<p><b>146. </b> On 1 September, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary that Mr Browne had approved the additional troops requested for </p>
<p>Op SALAMANCA because he had “judged that the likely impact of a short term </p>
<p>extension of an increased troop presence is offset by the need for momentum </p>

<p><b>148. </b> Mr Browne’s statement was published when Parliament returned on 11 September. </p>
<p>It confirmed an uplift of 360 personnel and went on to say: </p>
<p>“This is a critical period for the Iraqi people and their Government. There is an </p>
<p>opportunity to improve significantly the security situation in Basra City – building </p>
<p>on, and reinforcing, recent progress in Baghdad. Improved security in Basra will </p>
<p>create the conditions for the important civil development work being led by the UK’s </p>
<p>Provincial Reconstruction Team. Therefore I have agreed that the deployment of </p>
<p>troops from the Theatre Reserve Battalion, while strictly time limited, should on this </p>
<p>occasion be brought forward and extended by a short period. In addition, I have </p>
<p>also authorised the deployment of Royal Engineers to assist with reconstruction and </p>
<p>countering the threat from improvised explosive devices, a Royal Marine boat troop </p>
<p>to assist in tightening security on the Shatt Al Arab waterway, and a troop of Royal </p>
<p>Military Police to augment our training of the Iraqi Police.</p>
<p>“We ask our servicemen and women to discharge difficult and dangerous tasks. </p>
<p>But over the next few months, through security operations and civil development </p>
<p>projects, we have a key opportunity to make improvements to the lives of the people </p>
<p>of Basra and lay the foundations for the departure, once the conditions are right, of </p>

<p><b>149. </b> Lt Gen Fry’s successor, Lieutenant General Graeme Lamb, took up post as </p>
<p>SBMR&#8209;I in early September. He had previously served as the first GOC MND(SE) </p>
<p>in 2003 (see Section 9.2).</p>

<p>was “cautiously optimistic”.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> He considered it necessary to recalibrate UK expectations:</p>
<p>“The [Iraqi] Government is woefully immature in governance (albeit a UK </p>
<p>Government would be in a pretty challenging position to achieve the same results </p>
<p>that the coalition is demanding from Maliki) but the individuals are sophisticated </p>
<p>manipulators of people, ideas, facts and are ultimately this country’s future … </p>
<p>“The Baghdad Security Plan (BSP) appears to remain on track, albeit early days </p>
<p>yet … Too soon to elaborate but two early observations on the military piece:</p>

<p><b>Sadr City</b>. The timing of the entry to Sadr City has yet to be finalised, but the </p>
<p>sense is that without it the BSP falls short of a meaningful conclusion … rogue </p>

<p>a ‘clear and present danger’ to this nation and reconciliation.</p>

<p>taken this almost unmanageable problem forward in leaps and bounds, but </p>
<p>there is still some considerable way to go, and progress will not be eloquent, </p>
<p>nor I sense Western in its final form …”</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Lt Gen Lamb concluded his note:</p>
<p>“Final impression – more successful than we might imagine, more complex than we </p>
<p>can imagine, and an outcome likely to be more Iraqi than we have imagined.”</p>
<p><b>152. </b> On 12 September, Mr Browne wrote to Mrs Beckett with a report of his visit to </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> He considered that Op SALAMANCA “should create an opportunity for other </p>
<p>government departments to deliver on the medium&#8209;term and capacity&#8209;building initiatives </p>
<p>… we must make sure there is the closest possible linkage between establishing </p>
<p>enduing security with an Iraqi face and delivering benefit to the Basrawis”. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> On the same day, Mr Asquith wrote to Mr John Sawers, FCO Director General </p>
<p>Political, with his first impressions.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> Circulation of his letter was deliberately limited </p>
<p>within the FCO, but it was sent to Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director General Operational </p>
<p>Policy, and Sir Nigel Sheinwald. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr Asquith described the political challenges facing the Iraqi Government:</p>
<p>“For a government of national unity, most of its members are in opposition. Rumours </p>
<p>of an alternative government (of national salvation) or a military&#8209;led coup circulate …</p>
<p>“For the Shia religious parties, CPA’s apportionment of representation on sectarian </p>
<p>lines encouraged them to lay hold to a preponderance of power which the UIA </p>
<p>[United Iraqi Alliance] are seeking to convert into a monopoly over key decisions </p>
<p>on security and the economy …” </p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Asquith considered that part of the challenge was that:</p>
<p>“Maliki’s true intentions [are] an enigma even to those in his government: sectarian </p>
<p>going through the motions of reconciliation, or genuine power sharer constrained by </p>
<p>Shia supremacists? It is still reasonable to give him the benefit of the doubt that he </p>
<p>is the latter …”</p>
<p><b>156. </b> The “heart of the problem”, in Mr Asquith’s opinion, was:</p>
<p>“If facing us down on the nuclear agenda is Iran’s top priority and ensuring at least </p>
<p>a non&#8209;hostile government in Baghdad is sufficient for them, they will advance their </p>
<p>nuclear objective and achieve their sufficiency in Iraq by manipulating their assets </p>
<p>here against MNF and stoking the ambitions or sectarian prejudices of those in the </p>
<p>UIA [United Iraqi Alliance] … </p>

<p>“From our side, it may be impossible to compromise sufficiently on the nuclear </p>
<p>negotiations in a way that creates for the Iranians an incentive not to obstruct our </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq. Preventing them acquiring a nuclear capability may be viewed </p>
<p>as a higher priority than securing a reasonably stable, democratic and united Iraq. </p>
<p>If so, how do we alter the dynamics inside Iraq in a way that limits Iran’s ability to </p>
<p>manipulate the circumstances to its advantage?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Asquith considered that achieving success would require a combination of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building Prime Minister Maliki’s confidence and credibility by ensuring the </p>
<p>success of the Baghdad and Basra Security Plans and persuading political </p>
<p>leaders to lend him their support;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuading Prime Minister Maliki that the Shia militias were undermining his </p>
<p>authority and persuading him to take or support action against them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reintegrating Iraq into its Arab political and cultural context via the International </p>
<p>Compact (see Section 10.2); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuading political parties to amend the electoral law to permit only registered </p>
<p>parties and individuals to stand for election, leaving the formation of alliances </p>
<p>to post&#8209;election negotiations.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Mr Asquith concluded:</p>
<p>“Not a single one of the above is entirely in our gift … On all these we and our </p>
<p>military colleagues continue to work on practical outcomes with the Iraqis. Basra </p>
<p>being smaller in scope may prove easier to manage … We can still succeed over </p>
<p>the next six months, but no one pretends it will be anything but a damn close run </p>
<p>thing if we do.”</p>
<p><b>159. </b> On 12 September, members of DOP(I) were asked to consider out of committee </p>
<p>a paper which proposed an “information strategy in support of UK policy in Iraq”.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>160. </b> The paper had been prepared by the newly&#8209;created Iraq Information Strategy </p>
<p>Group (IISG), chaired by Mr Howard. It described UK objectives, which included that all </p>
<p>UK and overseas audiences should “understand that the UK mission is a coherent cross </p>
<p>government effort and not just a military operation” and “view us as a force for good”. </p>
<p>In particular, the UK public would be told that “a stable, democratic and free Iraq is in the </p>
<p>UK’s and world’s long term interests”.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> On 13 September, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs told him that </p>
<p>Op SALAMANCA would begin in the next few days.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> Its purpose was “to achieve </p>

<p><b>162. </b> On 14 September, the UN Security Council met to hear quarterly reports on </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> Mr Ashraf Jehangir Qazi, UN Special Representative for Iraq, commended </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki’s initiative in relation to the National Reconciliation Plan, which </p>
<p>merited “the widest possible support” from the international community. </p>
<p><b>163. </b> In Mr Qazi’s view, Iraq was at an important crossroads “and the challenges facing </p>
<p>the people had never appeared more daunting”. If current discord prevailed there was </p>
<p>a danger of the breakdown of the Iraqi state and, potentially, civil war. It was crucial that </p>
<p>the international community provided Iraq with the assistance it needed. </p>
<p><b>164. </b> Ambassador John Bolton, US Permanent Representative to the UN, told the </p>
<p>Security Council there had been “significant successes in the development of legitimate </p>
<p>political, economic and governmental institutions in Iraq” but “the sustained level of </p>
<p>ethno&#8209;sectarian violence was one of the most significant threats to security and stability </p>
<p>in Iraq”. He said that Iraq’s neighbours shared some responsibility for this:</p>
<p>“Syria should prevent financial and material support, particularly arms, from entering </p>
<p>Iraq. Iran should stop providing munitions and other support to extremist groups …”</p>
<p><b>165. </b> At Mr Blair’s request, when DOP met on 14 September discussion focused on </p>
<p>Basra and Op SALAMANCA.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>166. </b> ACM Stirrup said that Op SALAMANCA was a good plan. Its objectives were </p>
<p>increasing Iraqi political grip on the issue, by having a visible Iraqi face on the plan, and </p>
<p>increasing the confidence and competence of the ISF. Follow&#8209;on development work </p>
<p>would need to take place rapidly, and other government departments would need to help </p>
<p>drive delivery.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Browne observed that the success of the operation was not entirely within the </p>
<p>UK’s control. In determining how UK forces were to confront JAM, it would be important </p>
<p>to avoid Prime Minister Maliki feeling obliged to condemn UK actions against the Shia. </p>
<p>It would also be vital to separate the extreme and moderate elements of the Badr corps </p>
<p>and the Sadrists. Encouraging Prime Minister Maliki to do a deal with Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr </p>
<p>would be helpful. </p>
<p><b>168. </b> Mrs Beckett commented that, despite being in the majority and in government, </p>
<p>the Shia still felt as if they were in Opposition. Although she shared Mr Browne’s high </p>
<p>hopes for Op SALAMANCA, she observed that the Baghdad Security Plan had led to </p>
<p>an increase in attacks and casualties. She highlighted the increasing vulnerability of </p>
<p>the UK’s civilian staff in Basra, whose efforts were being increasingly hampered by the </p>
<p>security situation. </p>

<p>that Mr Blair supported contact with Badr, and that Mr Blair had been in favour for some </p>
<p>time of opening up channels to whomever was possible on the Shia side, including </p>
<p>Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>170. </b> C noted that the official record should make it clear that authority had now been </p>
<p>given for “Badr and indeed whoever else” to be contacted.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> When the Iraq Strategy Group discussed Op SALAMANCA the following day, they </p>
<p>were reminded that Prime Minister Maliki had yet to endorse the plan and agreed that it </p>
<p>could not proceed without his approval.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald briefed the Group on “the Prime Minister’s strong view that we </p>
<p>should encourage Maliki to reach a political accommodation with Sadr … All channels </p>
<p>for improving contact with Sadr and Sistani should be explored.”</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff reported on 15 September that he had invested considerable </p>
<p>effort in the previous week gaining support for Op SALAMANCA locally.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> He reported </p>
<p>that Maj Gen Hamadi had been “thoroughly briefed” and “appears to have taken </p>
<p>ownership of it, showing a clear understanding of what is involved”. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The chairman of the Provincial Oversight Committee had reservations about </p>
<p>the plan, particularly the involvement of MNF troops. Maj Gen Shirreff noted that this </p>
<p>“underline[d] the careful path we have to tread to maintain consent”. </p>
<p><b>175. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff outlined the reasons for Op SALAMANCA, which he described </p>
<p>as “the operation that will determine whether we will achieve PIC in Basra”:</p>
<p>“Doing nothing is not an option and will not achieve PIC in 2007, let alone early </p>
<p>2007 because of the lack of security. Quite simply, the security situation in Basra </p>
<p>is bad and likely to get worse. During disengagement a vacuum was created which </p>
<p>the militant militias and the death squads filled and which MNF force and activity </p>
<p>levels have been unable to counter. The number of killings in Basra increased … </p>
<p>any progress made in developing the police force was reversed and attacks on MNF </p>
<p>continued. Though there has been some progress … [it] is too slow and too fragile. </p>
<p>Crucially, the police are still incapable of providing even the most basic level of </p>
<p>security; rather they are a major cause of insecurity …</p>
<p>“Next, we must counter the perception among Basrawis that MNF has not done, and </p>
<p>is not doing, anything to improve their quality of life, which is resulting in diminishing </p>
<p>levels of consent …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>“Op SALAMANCA will, through decisive action, demonstrate that MNF is improving </p>
<p>the lot of Basrawis. Preliminary operations in Maysan and reinforcement of the TRB </p>
<p>[Theatre Reserve Battalion] have allowed me to concentrate my force so that I will </p>
<p>be able to lock down the City, district by district, to achieve security. This will also </p>
<p>enable me to surge in quick, high impact CMO [Civil Military Operations] projects </p>
<p>that will visibly improve quality of life … Meanwhile a concerted and sustained effort </p>
<p>by Police Training Teams will turn those police stations capable of improvement </p>
<p>into police stations that are capable of providing basic security in their local areas. </p>
<p>My aim is to cull the unredeemable and rehabilitate the ‘just about’ salvageable. </p>
<p>Employment projects will provide jobs for a significant portion of the population </p>
<p>giving them an alternative to joining the militia.”</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff commented that he would have preferred not to begin Op </p>
<p>SALAMANCA before Ramadan but had taken advice from local clerics and from the </p>
<p>MNF command in Baghdad, neither of whom considered this was a problem. He </p>
<p>observed that he was “also mindful that the Theatre Reserve is available for a limited </p>
<p>period of time and long&#8209;term pressures are likely to lead to a reduction in the forces </p>
<p>in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff concluded that:</p>
<p>“In short I do not have the luxury of being able to wait for perfect timing.</p>
<p>“We should not, under any circumstances, assume that Op SALAMANCA will be risk </p>
<p>free. We must be prepared to fight if necessary, with all the grim consequences we </p>
<p>are sadly familiar with … </p>
<p>“To summarise, if UK is to achieve mission success in SE Iraq, we must have the </p>
<p>resolve to see Op SALAMANCA through to its conclusion, as, of course, must Iraqi </p>
<p>politicians.”</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff also reported that “Dhi Qar is looking good for PIC” and that </p>
<p>“morale here is hugely boosted by the Australian decision to take on overwatch in </p>
<p>Dhi Qar after the Italian redeployment. Good on all who made it possible!”</p>

<p>“Iraq … [is] also creating a new supply of battle&#8209;hardened jihadists. The relationship </p>
<p>and capabilities being developed there will add resilience to the Al Qaida campaign; </p>
<p>those who survive will supply the next generation of leaders.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> The transition to PIC in Dhi Qar province took place on 21 September, in a </p>
<p>ceremony attended by Prime Minister Maliki as well as representatives of both the Italian </p>
<p>and Romanian governments, reflecting previous responsibilities in the province.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>181. </b> Lt Gen Lamb observed that Prime Minister Maliki’s comment that the Government </p>
<p>will be the official bearers of weapons, with no one else empowered to do so legally, </p>
<p>made during the ceremony, was an indication that he was prepared at least to make </p>
<p>“encouraging noises about the militias”.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>182. </b> On 21 September, Maj Gen Shireff reported that during a weekend meeting:</p>
<p>“… Maliki told Casey that the political situation in Basra needs to be dealt with </p>
<p>quietly and that the security situation in Basra was not bad enough to warrant an </p>
<p>operation that would upset the political balance.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Op SALAMANCA had been renamed Operation SINBAD and was subject to </p>
<p>“refinement”. It remained “an operation that has a pulse of focussed security in the form </p>
<p>of patrols to protect engineers followed by a pause</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> of ISF activity, police training and </p>
<p>reconstruction”. Detention operations would be avoided. The sequence of pulses would </p>
<p>start in a different area of the city. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff concluded his report:</p>
<p>“Op SALAMANCA has forced a choice. If GoI [the Government of Iraq] no longer </p>
<p>has the will (or backbone) for the Basra Security Plan they signed up to in June, one </p>
<p>option is certainly to work within this political constraint. The SALAMANCA planning </p>
<p>will not be wasted. We can start many of the high impact projects through Iraqi </p>
<p>contractors and the PTTs [Police Training Teams] can conduct a degree of cull/rehab </p>
<p>in police stations … But be under no illusions: SALAMANCA ‘lite’ will not deliver the </p>
<p>security conditions for PIC. The full implication of GoI not wanting to rock the boat, </p>
<p>deciding that security in Basra is ‘good enough’ and trying to impose constraints on </p>
<p>MNF freedom of manoeuvre in the City will be de facto, unconditional PIC. This will </p>
<p>leave Basra in the hands of the militant militia and death squads, with the ISF unable </p>
<p>to impose, let along maintain, the rule of law. Unable to draw down completely until </p>
<p>the US effectively declare game over, we could find ourselves laagered up in Basra </p>
<p>Air Station and effectively fixed outside a city in hostile hands. In my view, this does </p>
<p>not constitute ‘good enough’, either in endstate or in reputation terms for the UK </p>

<p>after his return to give him “an early feel for some of my conclusions”.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> He said:</p>
<p>“As briefed to you, SALAMANCA was a good plan. As eventually agreed by Maliki </p>
<p>it still is on the face of it. But even though we have political agreement to launch </p>
<p>SALAMANCA, we do not have agreement to tackle the hard issues (such as </p>
<p>militias) … I have said all along that success in Basra depends on strong political </p>
<p>leadership and engagement: I see no sign of this emerging. So I am not wildly </p>
<p>optimistic that SALAMANCA will put us on the road to PIC in Basra.”</p>
<p><b>186. </b> ACM Stirrup considered that “the proposals for cleaning up individual police </p>
<p>stations and culling/retraining the force are good” but would have no long&#8209;term impact </p>
<p>unless the “killers” in the Serious Crimes Unit were dealt with. The “key issue” of militias </p>
<p>remained unresolved, but ACM Stirrup reported his sense that Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>believed he could agree a deal that would address the problem. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> ACM Stirrup went on to consider the UK position in Basra after Op SALAMANCA. </p>
<p>If the operation was a success, “we would be well on the road to PIC, and consolidation </p>
<p>at Basra Air Station to meet our overwatch, mentoring and other long&#8209;term tasks”. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> If Op SALAMANCA was not a success:</p>
<p>“Returning to the status quo ante does not at the moment look like a sensible </p>
<p>choice. What else is there? Well, we could adopt the Maysan approach, remove our </p>
<p>tethered goats from Basra City and force the issue for the Iraqis. So from a force </p>
<p>structure perspective the aftermath of SALAMANCA might look pretty much the </p>
<p>same, succeed or fail.”</p>
<p><b>189. </b> There had been “no push&#8209;back” on that proposition from the US and UK officials </p>
<p>and officers ACM Stirrup had discussed it with whilst in Iraq; the “key decision point” </p>

<p><b>191. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I. The security situation in Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) (MND(SE)) has </p>
<p>deteriorated, although attacks account for only around 3 percent of the national total: </p>
<p>much lower than in Baghdad and Sunni areas of central and northern Iraq.</p>
<p>“II. Shia militias, particularly militant elements of Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM), are the most </p>
<p>potent threat. Their violence remains mainly directed against the Multi&#8209;National </p>
<p>Forces (MNF), but a range of Shia militias and criminal gangs has also been </p>
<p>involved in a campaign of violence and intimidation against Sunnis. As the declining </p>
<p>MNF presence reduces the number of coalition targets elsewhere across the South, </p>
<p>some Shia extremists will concentrate their efforts against MNF consolidating in </p>
<p>Basra. Intra&#8209;Shia violence will also increase. </p>
<p>“III. The threat from Sunni Arab nationalist insurgents and jihadists remains low </p>
<p>across the South. Their capabilities are limited and most attacks target to Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces (ISF) or the Shia. Nevertheless, occasional large&#8209;scale attacks, </p>
<p>including suicide bombings, will continue.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“V. The willingness and ability of the Iraq Army in the South to tackle Shia militias is </p>
<p>doubtful. Some army personnel retain loyalties to JAM and Badr militias. We do not </p>
<p>know the scale of this problem, although it is less severe than in the police. In Basra </p>
<p>the police are plagued by corruption, poor leadership and the entrenched influence </p>
<p>of Shia militias.</p>
<p>“VI. The ability of the coalition to influence events is decreasing as transition </p>
<p>proceeds. Stability in the South will be affected by external events: sustained MNF </p>
<p>action against JAM in Baghdad could lead to sympathetic violence in the south. </p>
<p>Maliki has been persuaded to endorse short&#8209;term coalition action in Basra, more </p>
<p>limited in scope than originally planned. But it remains uncertain whether the </p>
<p>Iraqi authorities have the necessary will or capacity to maintain progress over the </p>
<p>long term.”</p>
<p><b>192. </b> The JIC considered that Iran wanted “to speed MNF withdrawal from the South” </p>
<p>and therefore wanted “to make life as difficult as possible for coalition forces so long as </p>
<p>they remain”. To that end, Iran was “prepared to risk some increased instability” in Iraq. </p>
<p>The JIC confirmed its earlier judgement that “the Iranians are providing more training </p>
<p>and better weaponry to some Shia extremists attacking the MNF”. </p>
<p><b>193. </b> The JIC assessed that “considerable numbers of militant JAM groups in the region </p>
<p>receive either financial support, weapons or training from Iran” and there was one </p>
<p>report that suggested there had been a recent increase in support from Hizballah to </p>
<p>Shia militants. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Reflecting on the prospects for provincial transfer and stability, the JIC assessed </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“Competition for economic and political control among Iraqi political factions, in most </p>
<p>cases backed by militias, is likely to intensify. The political dynamics in the south </p>
<p>reflect tensions among the Shia parties in central government … Parties are vying </p>
<p>for control and creating a patchwork of influence in local government structures, </p>
<p>many of which are resistant to instruction from Baghdad. Militias and locally raised </p>
<p>ISF are increasingly competing to be seen as the legitimate providers of security </p>
<p>and are being used as such by political groups. Major constitutional issues, such as </p>
<p>federalism, remain undecided and will form the backdrop to the anticipated spring </p>
<p>2007 provincial elections, when we anticipate increased intra&#8209;Shia violence.”</p>
<p><b>195. </b> The JIC judged that it would prove more challenging to achieve the same level </p>
<p>of stability in Maysan as had been achieved in Muthanna and Dhi Qar:</p>
<p>“But we judge it is the extent of stability and economic recovery in Basra – the </p>
<p>second city of Iraq – which will shape and define the nature of transition across </p>
<p>the South. Declining security is undermining the prospects for Basra next year. </p>
<p>We judge that action to improve security, address corruption within the police, tackle </p>
<p>the Shia extremists, deliver civil reconstruction projects and kick&#8209;start longer&#8209;term </p>
<p>economic growth are essential if Basra is to match coalition expectations for </p>
<p>successful transition … It remains uncertain whether the Iraqi authorities have the </p>
<p>necessary will or capacity to maintain progress over the long term.”</p>
<p><b>196. </b> On 28 September, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs told him </p>
<p>that Prime Minister Maliki was unwilling to sanction aggressive action against Shia </p>
<p>militias in Baghdad and that this was “of a piece with his opposition to the original </p>
<p>Op SALAMANCA”.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> Op SINBAD was now happening in less sensitive areas of Basra, </p>
<p>focusing on “cleaning up the Basra police, and quick impact reconstruction work in </p>
<p>cleared areas of the city”. </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff reported on 28 September that Op SINBAD had at last begun, </p>
<p>after a “tortuous” round of final negotiations with Iraqi politicians.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> He observed that </p>
<p>MND(SE) “remain[s] on very thin ice politically” but the initial operations had gone </p>
<p>exceptionally well:</p>
<p>“What made a particular impact was the very evident Iraqi face on the operation, </p>
<p>both in the form of Iraqi sappers working alongside British sappers and Iraqi Army </p>
<p>security patrols on the streets alongside MNF.” </p>
<p><b>198. </b> Despite the good news, Maj Gen Shirreff also reported that there had been an </p>
<p>increase in the number of attacks – the figures for Explosively Formed Projectile (EFP) </p>

<p>attacks, indirect fire attacks and effective attacks were all at the highest level for six </p>
<p>months.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> In a phone conversation with President Bush on 29 September Mr Blair said that </p>
<p>the US and UK should be clear in public messages that developments in Iraq were </p>
<p>a direct result of “our opponents’ strategy” not policy failures.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> In Iraq it was AQ and </p>
<p>Iran who were driving the violence: “If we succeeded in our aims, this would be a blow </p>
<p>to them.” </p>
<p><b>October 2006</b></p>
<p><b>200. </b> On 5 October, at the request of the FCO, the JIC assessed the performance of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government, its level of popular support and its prospects over the year ahead.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>201. </b> The JIC judged that after five months in office:</p>
<p>“… the faction&#8209;based Iraqi Government is proving ineffective … Co&#8209;ordination </p>
<p>between and within Government Ministries is poor. None of this looks likely to </p>
<p>improve in the near future. Meanwhile, sectarian and insurgent violence is at a </p>
<p>record high, and fuel, water and electricity shortages persist across much of the </p>
<p>country.”</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The JIC assessed that Prime Minister Maliki’s approach to security was </p>
<p>“governed by the critical need to maintain Shia support”. He wanted a political solution </p>
<p>to disbanding militia groups and was “deeply sceptical of Multi&#8209;National Force (MNF) </p>
<p>proposals for tough military action against Shia groups”. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> The JIC recorded “little success so far” on the national reconciliation plan, and </p>
<p>assessed that:</p>
<p>“Against a backdrop of worsening security, Sunni Government Ministers are feeling </p>
<p>increasingly marginalised and unable to exert influence, while some leading Shia </p>
<p>and Kurdish political figures are questioning the Sunnis’ commitment to ending </p>
<p>violence. Mutual distrust is growing.” </p>
<p><b>204. </b> Security was judged to be the greatest challenge facing the Iraqi Government, with </p>
<p>the restoration of order in Baghdad a key issue:</p>
<p>“In the medium term, politically divisive issues such as federalism, the review of the </p>
<p>Constitution and the future of Kirkuk, have the potential to capsize the Government; </p>
<p>they can be managed or deferred at most for 12&#8209;18 months.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>205. </b> On 12 October, DOP(I) received a paper by officials on the medium&#8209;term prospects </p>
<p>for Iraq, which they said had reached a “critical juncture”. It reiterated that the UK’s goal </p>
<p>for Iraq was: </p>
<p>“A democratic, stable, united and law&#8209;abiding Iraq, within its present borders,  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operating with the international community, posing no threat to its neighbours </p>
<p>or to international security, abiding by all its international obligations and providing </p>
<p>effective, representative and inclusive government for all its people.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Officials argued that the UK’s goal was “unlikely to be achieved”. Officials </p>
<p>considered that the best outcome that was likely to be achievable was:</p>
<p>“… an Iraq which can govern and sustain itself nationally and provincially, and </p>
<p>where sectarian and other violence is contained short of the point where it would </p>
<p>overwhelm Iraq’s institutions and precipitate chaos and/or civil war.”</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The authors suggested that achieving such an outcome lay “primarily in the hands </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Government” and that the ability of the UK to influence its behaviour and </p>
<p>decisions would continue to decline. The coalition’s current strategy of “direct support </p>
<p>combined with building Iraqi capacity” remained the only credible way to influence </p>
<p>the outcome. But they judged that, despite the coalition’s best efforts, it was possible </p>
<p>that Iraq’s institutions could be overwhelmed and Iraq would be threatened with </p>
<p>fragmentation. </p>
<p><b>208. </b> The ability of the Iraqi people to assume full responsibility for security and sustain </p>
<p>any success would be one crucial test. The officials recommended that:</p>
<p>“… whilst we should continue the process of withdrawing forces as we progressively </p>
<p>handover security responsibility to the Iraqi Government, we should (assuming </p>
<p>continued Iraqi Government consent) plan on a continuing UK military commitment </p>
<p>focused on SE Iraq for 2007 and at least part of 2008. Under current agreed </p>
<p>coalition plans this would involve a substantial combat force (unlikely to be less than </p>
<p>4500 strong) capable of re&#8209;intervention if required by the Iraqi Government, and able </p>
<p>to carry out a number of tasks on a routine basis. If at some point in 2007 or 2008 </p>
<p>we were to decide not to retain an in&#8209;theatre capability to allow us to re&#8209;intervene </p>
<p>(on the assumption that the Iraqi government would be unlikely to request it) and </p>
<p>fulfil other agreed tasks, force levels could be reduced further to closer to 3,000. It </p>
<p>should be noted, however, that these tasks are part of the UK’s agreed commitments </p>
<p>to the MNF&#8209;I, and taking risk on any one of them could have serious ramifications for </p>
<p>our relations with the US.”</p>

<p><b>209. </b> The paper was touched on only very briefly when DOP(I) met on 12 October, </p>
<p>as Mr Browne indicated he would like more time to discuss and agree it formally at a </p>
<p>later date.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>210. </b> On 12 October, the <i>Daily Mail </i>published an interview with General Sir Richard </p>
<p>Dannatt, Chief of the General Staff.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> He criticised the UK Government’s strategy for </p>
<p>Iraq and called for the immediate withdrawal of UK forces from MND(SE):</p>
<p>“The hope that we might have been able to get out of Iraq in 12, 18, 24 months </p>
<p>after the initial start in 2003 has proved fallacious. Now hostile elements have </p>
<p>got a hold it has made our life much more difficult in Baghdad and in Basra … </p>
<p>[We should] get ourselves out some time soon because our presence exacerbates </p>
<p>the security problems. We are in a Muslim country and Muslims’ views of foreigners </p>
<p>in their country are quite clear. ‘As a foreigner, you can be welcomed by being </p>
<p>invited into a country, but we weren’t invited, certainly by those in Iraq at the time. </p>
<p>Let’s face it, the military campaign we fought in 2003 effectively kicked the door in. </p>
<p>That is a fact.’”</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Gen Dannatt contrasted the situation in Iraq with the UK presence in Afghanistan, </p>
<p>which he argued was different because it was at the invitation of President Karzai’s </p>
<p>government:</p>
<p>“‘There is a clear distinction between our status and position in Iraq and in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, which is why I have much more optimism that we can get it right </p>
<p>in Afghanistan.’”</p>
<p><b>212. </b> Gen Dannatt had previously talked of the Army “running hot”, under the strain of </p>
<p>fighting in both Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>213. </b> Mr Blair, Gen Dannatt and Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, all refer </p>
<p>to this interview, and its impact, in their memoirs. Mr Blair commented simply that he </p>
<p>“wasn’t best pleased” on hearing the news.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>214. </b> Mr Powell recalled:</p>
<p>“General Dannatt’s attack on the deployment of British forces in Iraq caught us </p>
<p>completely unawares in 2006. Tony and I were engaged in delicate Northern Ireland </p>
<p>negotiations in St Andrews … We thought for a moment about sacking him but </p>
<p>concluded that that would just make him into a martyr. His comments certainly didn’t </p>
<p>help our troops in Basra; Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr’s JAM militia leaders celebrated, claiming </p>
<p>that his comments proved that their efforts were working and that they should </p>
<p>redouble their attacks on British forces. We immediately received complaints from </p>

<p>131</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Gen Dannatt explained in his memoir that the interview had been part of a </p>
<p>concerted effort to get the general public in the UK to understand “why we were in </p>
<p>Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> He continued:</p>
<p>“Whatever were the merits of our contribution to the intervention in Iraq, I have </p>
<p>always been firmly of the view that Afghanistan was much more important to the </p>
<p>United Kingdom … I saw my task as being to ensure that sufficient priority was </p>
<p>placed on achieving overall success in Iraq and Afghanistan …</p>
<p>“Of course, Iraq was an extremely important issue in its own right, but as far as </p>
<p>I was concerned it sat within the overall strategic context of Afghanistan, the huge </p>
<p>pressure on our forces, and the wider security and moral issues that all this posed.”</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Gen Dannatt argued that the UK’s strategy for Iraq already was withdrawal, </p>
<p>because that was the essence of Gen Casey’s plan for transition. He wrote:</p>
<p>“I was <i>reinforcing</i> Government policy for a phased withdrawal from Iraq, not </p>
<p>criticising it … </p>
<p>“I was, after all, simply trying to generate support for the Army, as it did what the </p>
<p>Government was requiring of it, and at the same time to tell the nation of the </p>
<p>importance that I attached to eventual success in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>217. </b> On 18 October, Mr Browne wrote to Mrs Beckett to ask the FCO to set out </p>
<p>(with DFID) a view of the UK’s medium to long term foreign policy interests in Iraq.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote that it would be difficult to reach a view on force posture in the absence </p>
<p>of that information. </p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr Browne wrote that he intended to visit Iraq again to “get my own sense of what </p>
<p>is achievable by the current Government”. Before the end of the year there would need </p>
<p>to be:</p>
<p>“… a UK/US assessment on whether the current Iraqi Government realistically can </p>
<p>hope to deliver on security … It appears unlikely that the coalition will be told to </p>
<p>leave but … there may be pressure for a timetable as part of Maliki’s negotiations </p>
<p>on reconciliation.” </p>
<p><b>219. </b> Mr Browne added:</p>
<p>“I am keen to explore a scenario that has a more ambitious drawdown plan linked </p>

<p>backed by the threat of a descent into civil war. Hardly the basis for long&#8209;term </p>
<p>stability and well short of a liberal democracy. Such a scenario does not have to </p>
<p>assume an unacceptable level of Iranian influence over Iraqi politics but it does </p>
<p>assume some.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>220. </b> Mr Browne concluded:</p>
<p>“… we should acknowledge that in all the scenarios we can envisage, these </p>
<p>decisions and the transition process will become increasingly political – and we may </p>
<p>have to be prepared to accept a larger degree of risk.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>221. </b> In conversation on 19 October, Mr Blair told President Bush that the initial signs </p>
<p>from Op SINBAD were positive, in part because the ISF carrying out the operation </p>
<p>were “more compatible with the environment there”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> He suggested that the US and </p>
<p>UK should challenge Prime Minister Maliki’s judgement that action against Shia militias </p>
<p>should be delayed. </p>
<p><b>222. </b> Briefing for the conversation by Mr Blair’s Private Secretary contained a downbeat </p>
<p>assessment of developments in Baghdad.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> Although violence was reducing as the </p>
<p>MNF moved into an area, it then began to creep back in and finally rise rapidly when the </p>
<p>MNF handed over to the ISF. Often this took violence to a similar or higher level than </p>
<p>before. Levels of attacks across the city as a whole had risen, and the majority of areas </p>
<p>had experienced an increase in the number of bodies being found. </p>
<p><b>223. </b> Members of DOP(I) discussed the paper on medium term prospects at their </p>
<p>meeting on 20 October.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> Mr Blair was not present, and so the meeting was chaired by </p>
<p>Mr Browne.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Browne began by saying that the existing goal would be difficult to achieve, but </p>
<p>Ministers had to be certain that there was not more the UK could do before accepting </p>
<p>anything less. Mrs Beckett agreed that the new Iraqi Government was not delivering as </p>
<p>well as had been hoped. The long term objectives would be affected by the acceptability </p>
<p>of the coalition presence, which appeared to be declining faster than had been </p>
<p>envisaged. </p>
<p><b>225. </b> In discussion, a member of DOP(I) said that most DFID projects in the South were </p>
<p>likely to be completed by spring 2007 and that no new projects could be started under </p>
<p>current security circumstances. US policy was uncertain; current US force levels were </p>
<p>viewed as unsustainable. The proposed level of UK forces (4,500) was predicated on </p>

<p>keeping UK forces inside Basra city; Ministers should consider what operational purpose </p>
<p>would be served by their presence. </p>
<p><b>226. </b> DOP(I) agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should keep the existing policy goal, but recognise that the best </p>
<p>outcome achievable might fall short of it.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A progressive reduction of UK forces to 4,500 in 2007, in concert with US and </p>
<p>other allies, was possible, with more ambitious reductions being considered </p>
<p>at the end of November.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO would lead on urgent work on the security of staff in Basra.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> On 20 October, Sir David Manning, British Ambassador to the US, reported that </p>
<p>Iraq was dominating debate in advance of the mid&#8209;term elections:</p>
<p>“The recent upsurge in violence, the failure of the Baghdad security plan and the </p>
<p>greatly increased US casualty figures – ten killed on 18 October alone – have </p>
<p>increased the concern.”</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>228. </b> There was increasing speculation in Washington that, against the backdrop of </p>
<p>probable Republican electoral losses, the violence in Iraq and the unpopularity of the </p>
<p>war would force the Administration to change its strategy, including by abandoning its </p>
<p>open&#8209;ended commitment. </p>
<p><b>229. </b> Senior members of the Administration were sticking to “no change”, but </p>
<p>according to the Embassy, a policy shift could not be ruled out. The Iraq Study Group </p>
<p>– “a bipartisan group set up by Bush earlier this year and co&#8209;chaired by Jim Baker and </p>
<p>Lee Hamilton” – and its forthcoming report offered “the most obvious vehicle for change”.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> In a meeting with Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Sir David Manning on 23 October, </p>
<p>Mr Stephen Hadley, the US National Security Advisor, “accepted that the Baghdad </p>
<p>Security Plan was not succeeding”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> He observed that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Army had not deployed as expected, and the Iraqi Police could not hold </p>
<p>the ground cleared by US and Iraqi troops. The basic problem appeared to be that </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government had not bought into the Plan.”</p>
<p><b>231. </b> The US was considering how best to address the problem, which was likely to </p>
<p>involve an increase in Iraqi Army numbers and potentially supplying more equipment. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> Sir Nigel remarked that there was “a sense of stasis” in Iraq policy, which made </p>
<p>it a good moment to reflect on strategy. He said that Mr Blair would not want to see </p>

<p>a change in the basic goal and direction, but “we would have to be realistic about what </p>
<p>we could hope to achieve in the short and medium term”. Success would:</p>
<p>“… depend to a great extent on the Iraqi Government providing us with conditions </p>
<p>that allowed us to operate, including through effective action by Maliki to deal with </p>

<p><b>233. </b> At a meeting of DOP on 26 October, the medium term prospects paper was </p>
<p>discussed again alongside an update from Mr Browne on security developments </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>234. </b> ACM Stirrup advised that, militarily, the security operations in Basra “could not </p>
<p>be going better, although there had been an increase in the number of indirect fire </p>
<p>attacks on the Basra Palace compound”. The main concern of Basrawis was whether </p>
<p>the success of the operation could be sustained, which “would require engagement and </p>
<p>funds from the Government in Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> Mr Blair commented on the support from Iran for Shia militias, which had serious </p>
<p>implications for the MNF and the region. There was a risk that UK troop withdrawals </p>
<p>would convince the Iranians that their strategy was working. </p>
<p><b>236. </b> DOP agreed the analysis and recommendations contained in the medium term </p>
<p>prospects paper, subject to further work already commissioned, and agreed the UK’s </p>
<p>planning assumption should be for a reduction of UK force levels to around 4,500 in </p>
<p>2007. Officials should be asked to develop a “strategy for handling Iran”. </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Blair also mentioned the work of the Iraq Study Group and told DOP:</p>
<p>“We needed to develop ideas of our own to help shape the US approach.”</p>
<p><b>238. </b> At a meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group on 27 October, Mr Sawers reported that </p>
<p>discussion of Iran’s involvement in Iraq “had concluded that the problem could not be </p>
<p>solved in Iraq … a wider strategy for handling Iran, co&#8209;ordinating the response to Iran’s </p>
<p>regional influence, was required”.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>239. </b> At the same meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group Mr Simon McDonald, FCO Director </p>
<p>Iraq, reported that the security situation in Basra had deteriorated to the point where </p>
<p>Mrs Beckett had decided that it would be necessary to withdraw the majority of civilian </p>
<p>staff from Basra Palace. Mr Benn agreed with that view. </p>
<p><b>240. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald confirmed that Mr Blair would be content to accept </p>
<p>Mrs Beckett’s judgement on the matter. Ms Margaret Aldred, Deputy Head of the </p>

<p>civilian staff would send the wrong message. </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Updating Mr Blair on the plan later in the day, his Private Secretary wrote that </p>
<p>“this move is likely to be seen as a victory by those attacking us”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Dr Rosalind Marsden, the British Consul General in Basra; and four FCO </p>
<p>civilian staff were to remain in Basra Palace, while the other staff were relocated to </p>
<p>Basra Air Station. </p>
<p><b>244. </b> The update also described a growing public perception that the US and Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki were “drifting apart”, fuelled by contrasting public statements about the </p>
<p>time needed to re&#8209;establish order in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> Responding to the update, Mr Blair wrote “we need to review the political strategy </p>
<p>to underpin the right analysis of what is happening. I will do a note.”</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>246. </b> On 29 October, Mr Blair produced a paper entitled ‘Iraq Plan’ which set out nine </p>
<p>points requiring “active central management with weekly meeting for me and key </p>
<p>advisers”.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> They were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Improve Maliki’s governing capability”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage a political process to draw in Sadrists and Sunni Arabs, including by </p>
<p>providing a conditional timeline for withdrawal if necessary;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Rectify any weaknesses in training, equipment, pay and capacity of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… pay off the worst aspects of the police, slim them down and change the </p>
<p>command and control”.</p>

<p>commission an analysis of “Shia feeling”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expose the involvement of Iran in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pass a new Security Council resolution – “not just about the rollover but puts Iraq </p>

<p>144</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>identifying and filling gaps in the Iraqi Army’s capability;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>250. </b> Mr Blair also raised concerns about whether Prime Minister Maliki was supported </p>
<p>by a structure that allowed him to make and implement decisions, in particular in </p>

<p>the preceding week.</p>

<p> He reported that the withdrawal had come as a surprise to </p>
<p>MND(SE) and was expected to have an adverse impact because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reduction in police advisers would mean that it would be possible to staff the </p>

<p>take over from the Specialist Crime Unit.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The loss of prison advisers came just before a planned move of prisoners out </p>
<p>of the Jameat facility into a new facility.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Mr Blair suggested that “a sense of urgency” was needed in US and UK strategy </p>
<p>for Iraq, which should include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a major political agreement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a security plan; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a plan to increase the capability of the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> Mr Hadley explained that the US hoped that the forthcoming Baker/Hamilton </p>
<p>Report would be a vehicle for producing a new plan for Iraq with cross&#8209;party support </p>
<p>in the US. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> Lt Gen Lamb expressed his views about the withdrawal of civilian staff in his </p>
<p>weekly report of 5 November:</p>
<p>“… while I understand but do not necessarily agree with the reasons for the </p>
<p>relocation of the PRT, and the way the draw down of FCO staff in Basra took place, </p>
<p>the interpretation up here was that the case, haste and timing was unhelpful. </p>
<p>US cries of non&#8209;consultation (not strictly true) and its impact on key issues that </p>
<p>materially affect the wider coalition … a number of those who were actually capable </p>
<p>of making the material difference, such as in capacity building, are no longer </p>
<p>present. US comments such as ‘I see the Brits are doing their own thing again’ from </p>
<p>both the military and Embassy do count in a coalition where our currency for making </p>
<p>change is often our opinion … 168 days ago, it may have mattered less but the </p>
<p>moment we gained a Shia Prime Minister, the profile of our ‘independence’ down </p>
<p>south changed inexorably. Our actions now have a direct relationship with those in </p>
<p>Baghdad, as does our … [plan for military force levels] within the emerging coalition </p>
<p>campaign. Our performance was hardly a ‘comprehensive approach’ and was, I felt, </p>
<p>rather un&#8209;British.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Maj Gen Lamb’s report also reflected concerns from the US military in Iraq </p>
<p>that the mid&#8209;term elections would create an additional overhead in responding to an </p>
<p>increased number of questions and enquiries. He also offered a view on how reasonable </p>
<p>governance objectives in Iraq might be defined, as:</p>
<p>“… supplying the Iraqis with the capability to deliver what constitutes a <i>progressive</i> </p>
<p>(slowly at first), <i>Islamic</i> (a given) <i>nation </i>(ideally but co&#8209;federation could work) is </p>
<p>where the governance goal posts probably lie.”</p>
<p><b>257. </b> On 5 November, Mr Blair wrote a note which said: </p>
<p>“The next few months are critical for foreign policy. Iraq in particular.”</p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>258. </b> In the note Mr Blair said that the first basic element of the approach on Iraq would </p>
<p>be a new Iraq compact, ratified by a Security Council resolution, in which:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqis come together to support a non&#8209;sectarian future; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MAS [Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr] dissociates himself from JAM and Maliki agrees to go </p>
<p>after JAM;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there is better Iraqi governance and especially in the disbursement of money;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqis re&#8209;affirm our presence whilst they need it.”</p>
<p><b>259. </b> The second element of the approach would be:</p>
<p>“We make explicit a broader Middle East strategy in which we put Iraq in the context </p>
<p>of a changing, modernising Middle East where everywhere, including Palestine and </p>
<p>Lebanon, we are trying to solve outstanding issues.”</p>
<p><b>US mid&#8209;term elections</b></p>
<p>In the US mid&#8209;term elections on 7 November, President Bush’s Republican Party lost </p>
<p>control of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The new Speaker of the House of Representatives asked President Bush “to work </p>
<p>together to find a solution to the war in Iraq”. </p>
<p>The following day, as widely anticipated, President Bush announced that Secretary </p>

<p><b>261. </b> Mr Blair identified a strategy with four key elements:</p>
<p>“–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>agreement on a ‘national compact’ which produced a settlement of the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Mr Blair added that the best source of leverage over Prime Minister Maliki was his </p>
<p>desire for the UK not to leave “precipitately”. He concluded that “we should therefore </p>
<p>offer him a timetable, conditional on his securing an acceptable political compact, to </p>
<p>which Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr had signed up”.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> ACM Stirrup updated the meeting on “the continued good progress in Operation </p>
<p>SINBAD” and noted that:</p>
<p>“… once it had concluded, we would have done as much as we judged militarily </p>
<p>possible in Basra. He noted, however, that it did not deal with the fundamental </p>
<p>problem of militias. The Prime Minister queried whether it could therefore be </p>
<p>effective. CDS [ACM Stirrup] suggested that the militia problem would have to </p>
<p>be dealt with politically.”</p>
<p><b>264. </b> On 9 November, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent a Note from Mr Blair to President Bush </p>
<p>via Mr Hadley.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>265. </b> The Note began:</p>
<p>“Our foreign policy is so joined, we both face the same issues. So a Democrat </p>
<p>victory is seen here as a ‘thumping’ for me as well as you!”</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Blair continued:</p>
<p>“… my worry is: waiting for Baker’s group to come up with a strategy. We should </p>
<p>lead the consensus not simply follow it. Our danger is either being seen for political </p>
<p>reasons, to ‘cave in’, which we will never do; or have to be told the answer because </p>
<p>we can’t think of it. Actually our strategy is already evolving. Before Baker reports we </p>
<p>should spell out that evolution.” </p>
<p><b>267. </b> Mr Blair explained that strategy for Iraq should include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a political compact to be published by the Iraqis, committing to non&#8209;sectarian </p>
<p>government and ruling out partition of the country, with support from both Sunnis </p>
<p>and Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a plan for better governance; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accelerating the plan to complete the formation of the army and police; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a conditional timescale for withdrawal, focused on Iraqi capability and “making </p>
<p>no concessions on democracy”. </p>

<p><b>268. </b> In addition, Mr Blair argued that a “whole Middle East” strategy was needed which </p>
<p>would frame the debate on Iraq in terms of the whole region and expose the hostile </p>
<p>intent of Iran. Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“The huge benefit in Iraq, of such a strategy, is that it gives us more than what </p>
<p>is happening day to day in Iraq to talk about. That is our problem: it is all events, </p>
<p>ghastly and bloody, unconnected to the underlying strategic cause.” </p>
<p><b>269. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair spoke by video conference the next day joined by </p>
<p>Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr Hadley, Mr Jonathan Powell and Sir Nigel Sheinwald.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>270. </b> Mr Blair set out his view that the UK and US should focus on supporting Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki to achieve a national political compact, accelerate assistance to the </p>
<p>ISF, improve the Iraqi Government’s ability to “deliver resources” and bring regional </p>
<p>assistance to bear more effectively. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> Mr Blair suggested that Prime Minister Maliki should set out his political and </p>
<p>security plans in a way that demonstrated he was in the lead, ideally before the Iraq </p>
<p>Study Group reported, and in such a way that allowed the US and UK to respond </p>
<p>positively. </p>
<p><b>272. </b> On 13 November, Mr Blair discussed Iraq with ACM Stirrup, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, </p>
<p>Mr McDonald, C, Ms Aldred and officials from No.10.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>273. </b> Mr Blair told those present that “the major challenge was ensuring that Maliki had </p>
<p>an effective government apparatus around him, underpinned by capable security forces”. </p>
<p><b>274. </b> ACM Stirrup said that “the US had given a lot of thought to the latter point” and had </p>
<p>“a coherent plan” to train the ISF. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> Mr Blair commissioned Sir Nigel Sheinwald to co&#8209;ordinate a plan, drawing on </p>
<p>departmental expertise, which would “set out the detail underpinning the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>four point strategy for Iraq, together with a clear sense of who would be responsible for </p>
<p>operationalising each element”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair recognised that it would need Iraqi, US and </p>
<p>wider international support. </p>
<p><b>276. </b> That evening, Mr Blair spoke at the annual Lord Mayor’s banquet in London’s </p>
<p>Guildhall.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> He described the growing pressure from terrorism in Iraq and said:</p>
<p>“Just as the situation is evolving, so our strategy should evolve to meet it.</p>
<p>“Inside Iraq we should empower the Iraqi leadership that wants to take responsibility </p>
<p>– that knows that they, not us, must lead and win the fight against terrorism. </p>

<p>To do this effectively, they need our support, politically, in their economy and for their </p>

<p>First, we need a strong political compact in Iraq led by the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>to bring all parties together, with clear commitments to non&#8209;sectarian </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Second, we need to build Iraqi governing capability, especially in the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Third, we must plug any gaps in training, equipment and command </p>

<p>set down by General Casey, to transition to Iraqi control.”</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Mr Blair went on to explain that “a major part of the answer to Iraq lies not in Iraq </p>
<p>itself but outside it”, creating a need for a “whole Middle East” strategy which would </p>
<p>“start with Israel/Palestine”, make progress on Lebanon and “unite all moderate Arab </p>
<p>and Moslem voices behind a push for peace”. </p>
<p><b>278. </b> On 14 November Mr Blair, accompanied by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, spoke by video </p>

<p><b>279. </b> In preparation, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary provided a briefing pack and a letter </p>

<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Sawers reported that Prime Minister Maliki was “anxious to assume more </p>
<p>responsibility for security as soon as possible” but was more resistant to the need for </p>
<p>a “broad base of political support for his government”. Mr Sawers described “areas </p>
<p>of progress”, specifically “on the economy, on a new oil law, and on building up the </p>
<p>Army” and said that “the prospects don’t look as bleak as they are portrayed in the </p>
<p>Western media”. </p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Sawers wrote that progress had been made on a new Security Council </p>
<p>resolution, with the terms of a letter to the Security Council requesting rollover of the </p>
<p>previous resolution agreed between the US and Iraqi Governments. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Finally, Mr Sawers recommended that Mr Blair stress to the Iraq Study Group </p>
<p>“the importance to Maliki of securing the earliest possible transition of security </p>
<p>responsibilities” and that he “warn starkly against partition of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary reported to the FCO that during his session with </p>

<p><b>284. </b> Asked about UK troop levels, Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… UK policy was to stay until the job was done, which meant drawing down as the </p>

<p>that the Iraqis wanted us to assume a support role. So if the Operation went to plan, </p>
<p>we would be able to reduce our own force levels somewhat over the next six to nine </p>
<p>months. He stressed that he was strongly opposed, though, to any unconditional </p>
<p>withdrawal.” </p>
<p><b>285. </b> After a long discussion about regional issues, members of the Iraq Study Group </p>
<p>asked Mr Blair what he would like to see in their final report. His Private Secretary </p>
<p>reported that he replied:</p>
<p>“It would be helpful if the ISG endorsed a plan that was essentially an evolution </p>
<p>of our current strategy. If it did the Prime Minister would be happy to give it his </p>
<p>full support.”</p>
<p><b>286. </b> On 15 November, at the request of the Iraq Senior Officials Group, the </p>
<p>JIC examined “the scale, scope and nature of violence in Iraq” and the “will and </p>
<p>effectiveness of the Iraqi Government to respond and the implications of failure”.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>287. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“I. Most ordinary Iraqis, other than Kurds, retain a sense of Iraqi nationhood. </p>
<p>But their concepts of the future Iraq are increasingly defined in terms of their own </p>
<p>sectarian interests, whether Shia or Sunni. It is unclear how long support for a </p>
<p>unitary state will last in the face of rising Sunni/Shia violence. All the current trends </p>
<p>are heading in the wrong direction.</p>
<p>“II. Violence continues to escalate. The strength of the Sunni Arab nationalist </p>
<p>insurgents is undiminished. Their violence is complemented by a resilient jihadist </p>
<p>campaign. Attacks on the coalition by Shia extremists have also increased. But </p>
<p>sectarian attacks, mostly in Baghdad, now account for the bulk of the violence and </p>
<p>casualties. Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ&#8209;I) is in the vanguard, believing their strategy of </p>
<p>fomenting civil war is working. Elements of Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM) are the primary </p>
<p>force behind Shia sectarian violence.</p>
<p>“III. The Iraqi Government’s response to deteriorating security remains ineffective. </p>
<p>Many Shia politicians blame all violence on ‘Ba’athists’. There has been no progress </p>
<p>on national reconciliation … So long as Sunni alienation is reinforced, Iraqi and </p>
<p>coalition efforts to engage elements of the Sunni insurgency are unlikely to make </p>
<p>progress and Sunni participation in government will be fragile.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>288. </b> Although Prime Minister Maliki was increasingly keen to accelerate the transfer of </p>
<p>responsibility for security to Iraqi control, the JIC judged that the ISF would be likely to </p>
<p>need MNF support for some time:</p>
<p>“Without it they will be unable to cope in Baghdad and the Sunni heartlands, risking </p>
<p>worsening violence and further weakening of government authority.”</p>
<p><b>289. </b> On 16 November, Major General Simon Mayall, Deputy Commanding General </p>
<p>MNC&#8209;I, sent an update to Lt Gen Houghton.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> Maj Gen Mayall described a “Transition </p>
<p>Bridging Strategy” that was gaining momentum with senior US commanders. </p>
<p>The strategy was based on an assumption that “the Security Line of Operation is </p>
<p>indispensable to mission success, but it cannot, and never was intended to deliver </p>
<p>the Endstate on its own”. The strategy entailed increasing the size of training teams </p>
<p>embedded with the Iraq Army prior to handing over an area to Iraqi control. Maj Gen </p>
<p>Mayall assessed:</p>
<p>“… what this model offers us, and the GoI, is the opportunity to transition with the </p>
<p>Iraqis, and thereby set much better conditions, in due course, to transition to the </p>
<p>Iraqis. This concept and model, however, is critically depending upon substantial </p>
<p>support from the other Lines of Operation.”</p>
<p><b>290. </b> At the meeting of DOP(I) on 16 November Mr Sawers, following his recent visit </p>
<p>to Iraq, expressed serious concern at the rise of Shia militias but added that the biggest </p>
<p>security concern was still the Sunni insurgency and fear of elements of the former </p>
<p>regime.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> He reported that Prime Minister Maliki was frustrated that he was not in </p>
<p>control of the security apparatus. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> In discussion, it was suggested that Prime Minister Maliki was constrained by his </p>
<p>agreement with Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr and that it was important to recognise that any Iraqi </p>
<p>leader would need to reach such political accommodations in order to function.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> The meeting was told that the text of the international compact had been agreed </p>
<p>but there had been little substantive progress and that Mr Blair considered that </p>
<p>developments in Iraq, the US and the UK were reaching a critical stage. He wanted </p>
<p>a “comprehensive co&#8209;ordinated forward plan for the coming weeks” covering political, </p>
<p>economic, governance and security strands. Mrs Beckett said that departments would </p>
<p>“work quickly” to produce this.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Mr Browne reported that planning was taking place in the US to speed up the </p>
<p>transition process and that this was consistent with the UK’s Medium Term Plan. He still </p>
<p>expected that it would be possible to achieve PIC in Maysan by the end of 2006 and in </p>
<p>Basra in spring 2007. </p>

<p>57</p>
<p><b>294. </b> In discussion, it was suggested that what could be achieved in Basra by March </p>
<p>2007 would “probably not be enough to achieve PIC” and so the challenge would be </p>
<p>to “work out how we could complete the process from outside Basra after we had </p>
<p>transitioned”.</p>
<p><b>295. </b> VAdm Style provided an update on Op SINBAD, which he considered had </p>
<p>been a “considerable success”, although progress on reforming the Iraqi police </p>
<p>remained weak and attack levels against coalition forces remained high. Mrs Beckett </p>
<p>and Sir Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary, reported that the impact of </p>
<p>the withdrawal of civilian staff from Basra Palace on Better Basra and on DFID’s </p>
<p>programmes had been “marginal”. </p>
<p><b>296. </b> Mrs Beckett summed up that officials should develop some clear and agreed </p>
<p>forward planning on the future of the civilian and military presence in Basra. </p>
<p><b>297. </b> VAdm Style told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“SINBAD was a very considerable success. Yes, in some senses conditions were </p>
<p>deteriorating in Basra, and again it depends on exactly which little bit of time that </p>
<p>you are thinking about … But amongst the things that were achieved out of SINBAD </p>
<p>were a new level of co&#8209;operation between our own forces and the Iraqi Army, better </p>
<p>Iraqi Army and police co&#8209;operation, both the police and the army effectiveness – </p>
<p>Iraqi Army effectiveness were improved, extra equipment was brought in. There </p>
<p>was better – there was improving support from the Council and most of the authority </p>
<p>within Basra because they approved of what was being done. Consent temporarily </p>
<p>improved, it had all the time been generally reducing, and the murder rate went </p>
<p>down. By the end … the Iraqis were in the lead to an extent they had not been </p>
<p>before.”</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>298. </b> On 17 November, Mr Jonathan Powell sent a minute to Mr Blair with his thoughts </p>
<p>on Iraq.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> He wrote that there was “a new fluidity in Iraq after months of stasis” which </p>
<p>offered an opportunity to change strategy on Iraq and to change the way Iraq was seen </p>
<p>in the West. </p>
<p><b>299. </b> Mr Powell suggested that there was a need to “be more imaginative” to get out of </p>
<p>the “bunker mentality” in which both politicians and civil servants found themselves and </p>
<p>“change our way of working to take advantage of the opportunity”. Part of the answer </p>
<p>would be the new “Forward Plan”, which would focus discussion. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Powell also recommended that the list of attendees at the “weekly meetings” </p>
<p>needed to change, commenting “I think we need a general as well as CDS” and that </p>
<p>Mr Blair should have fortnightly video conferences with UK personnel in Iraq and with </p>
<p>the US. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>301. </b> A media plan that would change attitudes in the UK and US was needed. </p>
<p>Mr Powell advised Mr Blair to strengthen his relationship with Prime Minister Maliki, </p>
<p>keeping in more regular and relaxed contact. </p>
<p><b>302. </b> Mr Powell concluded his minute:</p>
<p>“But there is also a bigger question … If this were a domestic problem we would </p>
<p>use the whole team to strategise about it. Maybe you should try a discussion in that </p>
<p>format to see if we could find a better way of communicating what we are trying to </p>
<p>do. It may be that we think about Iraq in too technocratic and in an insufficiently </p>
<p>political way.”</p>
<p><b>303. </b> Mr Blair commented: “I agree. I should see Maliki in December and maybe </p>
<p>do weekly video cons … We also need some good news balance. And the key is to </p>
<p>revitalise the Compact plan.”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Following a discussion in the Iraq Strategy Group, a draft of the Forward Plan was </p>
<p>sent to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary by Mr McDonald on 24 November.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> It was sent in </p>
<p>parallel to the FCO, the MOD and to SIS. </p>
<p><b>305. </b> In his covering note, Mr McDonald set out the assumptions which underpinned </p>
<p>the Plan. They included diminishing UK influence over “events” in Iraq and that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government increasingly saw the coalition as the main obstacle to establishing its </p>
<p>authority. As a consequence responsibility would be handed over ahead of a rigorous </p>
<p>assessment that they were capable of undertaking the task.</p>
<p><b>306. </b> The draft plan also assumed that there would not be a fundamental change of US </p>
<p>policy as a result of the Iraq Study Group’s report. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> The plan included proposed actions under three headings:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Political accommodation. The UK should help bring about a political compact </p>
<p>based on a declaration of fundamental principles, the establishment of a Peace </p>
<p>Commission and a Reconciliation/Rehabilitation Commission and agreement to </p>
<p>a date for Provincial Elections in 2007.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Governance and economic development. The UK should urge Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki to build greater Iraqi capability by establishing an Economic Task </p>
<p>Force equivalent to the Ministerial Committee on National Security, securing </p>
<p>agreement on the Hydrocarbons Law;</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> pushing for a “full and effective </p>
<p>multilateral presence in Iraq”; and securing early deals on oil revenue sharing </p>
<p>and fiscal federalism.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Security. The plan assumed that the revised US plan was likely to see a move </p>
<p>by coalition forces out of urban areas into consolidated bases on the outskirts </p>
<p>of urban areas and accelerated transition to Iraqi control based on “a more </p>
<p>pragmatic and subjective Iraq&#8209;led approach” to assessing suitability for PIC to </p>
<p>replace the “current mechanistic and convoluted assessment process”. The </p>
<p>plan said: “This may mean that the conditions for transfer are relaxed thus </p>
<p>accelerating the process of transition. The risk is that a less rigorous process </p>
<p>may increase the chances of subsequent under performance by the Iraqis. In </p>
<p>practice, it places an increasing emphasis on the capability of the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces rather than the security situation on the ground, closely supported by </p>
<p>efforts on the governance and economic front. We may, however, face a degree </p>
<p>of pushback in the detailed execution of our plan from the US, despite prior </p>
<p>agreement in principle.”</p>
<p><b>308. </b> Responding to Mr McDonald, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary reported that he had </p>
<p>described the Forward Plan as “an excellent piece of work”.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> The Private Secretary </p>
<p>asked for the Plan to be finalised and implemented; the section on reforming key </p>
<p>Ministries needed more detail and there was nothing yet on strategic communications. </p>
<p>The Plan itself would require a high&#8209;profile launch. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> On 25 November, Mr Blair mentioned the draft Forward Plan to President Bush </p>
<p>during a telephone conversation and offered to send him a copy.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> They discussed </p>
<p>whether 100,000 more troops, as proposed by some in the US, would not work and the </p>
<p>importance of demonstrating that the coalition was taking the initiative in the next phase. </p>
<p><b>310. </b> Mr Blair commented on the differences between the situation in Baghdad and in </p>
<p>Basra, where Op SINBAD appeared to have gone well. He suggested that it should be </p>
<p>possible for Basra to be controlled by the Iraqis, “with our support”.</p>
<p><b>311. </b> No.10 sent the White House a copy of the Forward Plan later that day, stressing </p>
<p>that it remained “work in progress”.</p>

<p> He also described “the need for </p>
<p>caution regarding supportive statements about ‘accelerated transition’ by US military </p>
<p>interlocutors”. </p>
<p><b>313. </b> Lt Gen Houghton updated the Chiefs of Staff on efforts to counter the threat of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>314. </b> At the end of November 2006, the UN Security Council unanimously adopted </p>
<p>resolution 1723 (2006).</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> At the formal request of Prime Minister Maliki, this extended </p>
<p>the legal basis for the presence and activities of the MNF in Iraq, and arrangements for </p>
<p>putting oil receipts into the Development Fund of Iraq, until December 2007. </p>
<p><b>315. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that the US Administration had reviewed its </p>
<p>strategy for Iraq during the second half of 2006.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> It had focused on three options: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to accelerate the existing strategy of training Iraqi forces while withdrawing US </p>
<p>forces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to pull US troops back from Baghdad until the sectarian violence burnt out; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to deploy additional US troops to conduct a full&#8209;scale counter&#8209;insurgency </p>
<p>campaign in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>316. </b> Before deciding on the third option President Bush sought assurances from Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki that he would commit more Iraqi forces, not interfere in joint military </p>
<p>operations, confront Shia militias, and as security improved make progress on political </p>
<p>reconciliation. President Bush’s memoir records that<i> </i>Prime Minister Maliki gave those </p>
<p>assurances at a meeting on 29 November. </p>
<p><b>317. </b> On 30 November, Maj Gen Shireff commented that indirect fire, while “extremely </p>
<p>unpleasant and, at times fatal” was “not a showstopper” but rather a “tactical </p>
<p>nuisance”.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> It had, however, “had a strategic effect by forcing the very public drawdown </p>
<p>of the FCO and handed an IO [Information Operations] victory to the enemy on a plate”. </p>
<p>He explained that it was necessary to reduce the levels of indirect fire “to avoid the </p>
<p>charge that we have been bombed out of the City”. </p>
<p><b>318. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff explained that there was “more we could and should do” but he </p>
<p>was hampered from doing so because he did not have the equipment.</p>
<p><b>December 2006</b></p>
<p><b>319. </b> On 6 December, the JIC examined the level of control that different actors, in </p>
<p>particular Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr, had over elements of JAM.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>320. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. Muqtada al Sadr controls the large majority of Jaysh al Mahdi (JAM). Most </p>
<p>‘mainstream’ JAM members are not routinely involved in violence against the </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Forces (MNF). JAM militants are attacking the MNF and the Sunni </p>
<p>population: most claim allegiance to Sadr and accept broad direction from him, but </p>
<p>launch attacks for a variety of local reasons, frequently ignoring his orders.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>“II. No one person or group controls all JAM activity and activities of other Shia </p>
<p>militias and individuals are often wrongly attributed to it. The apparently contradictory </p>
<p>actions of some JAM members are a result of increasing fractures within the </p>
<p>movement, particularly over the use of violence.</p>
<p>“III. Sadr has to balance his political ambitions with those of his militant followers. </p>
<p>He could easily increase levels of violence … though this is unlikely at present. </p>
<p>He would have more difficulty reining in violence by his militant followers against the </p>
<p>MNF … He remains liable to change tack at short notice.</p>
<p>“IV. In some areas such as Basra ‘secret cells’ with little loyalty to Sadr are </p>
<p>responsible for a significant proportion of the anti&#8209;MNF violence carried out in the </p>
<p>name of JAM …</p>
<p>“V. Some ‘secret cells’ are receiving funding, training and supplies from Lebanese </p>
<p>Hizballah and the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force. Despite </p>
<p>accepting Iranian help Sadr remains an Iraqi nationalist: he suspects Iranian motives </p>
<p>and resents their influence. The Iranians for their part find Sadr a frustrating partner. </p>
<p>But Iran still views Sadr as an important player in the future Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>321. </b> The JIC assessed that JAM members joined for differing reasons. For some the </p>
<p>attraction was the power and prestige that came with bearing arms and belonging to a </p>
<p>militia. But in a climate of increasing violence, JAM membership also offered safety in </p>
<p>numbers and the likelihood of retribution if attacked. Others joined JAM out of a sense </p>
<p>of religious duty; some to attack Sunnis and the MNF, and a small minority used JAM </p>
<p>as a cover for solely criminal activity:</p>
<p>“We judge that this variety of motivating factors is partly responsible for the divisions </p>
<p>within JAM. JAM labels such as ‘mainstream’, ‘militant’ and ‘secret cell’ are a </p>
<p>valuable analytical aid, but membership is fluid and individuals would not perceive </p>
<p>themselves in this way …</p>
<p>“MNF estimates that there are around 10,000 active supporters with varying degrees </p>
<p>of paramilitary training and a further 20,000 sympathisers who could be mobilised </p>
<p>rapidly … many members of JAM have joined the Iraqi Security Forces, particularly </p>
<p>the police. Tribal loyalties remain important …”</p>
<p><b>322. </b> The Iraq Study Group published its report on 6 December.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> Although it stressed </p>
<p>that there was “no magic formula” to guarantee success, it offered 79 recommendations </p>
<p>to improve US policy in Iraq. In particular, it recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>changing the primary mission of US forces in Iraq to one of supporting the Iraqi </p>
<p>army, to enable the withdrawal of US combat forces from Iraq by the first quarter </p>

<p>(including progress on the Constitutional review, de&#8209;Ba’athification, oil </p>
<p>revenue&#8209;sharing, provincial elections and Kirkuk) particularly on reconciliation, </p>
<p>security and governance, and proposing a reduction in US assistance if </p>
<p>substantial progress was not made;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>launching a New Diplomatic Offensive, including the creation of an “Iraq </p>
<p>International Support Group”, including Iraq, all the States bordering Iraq </p>
<p>(including Iran and Syria), the key regional States, the five permanent members </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>beginning an urgent review of the Constitution in the interests of national </p>
<p>reconciliation, with the assistance of the UN.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Sir David Manning wrote to the FCO in London on the day of the report’s </p>
<p>publication with an account of a briefing by Mr Baker. Sir David assessed that:</p>
<p>“At first blush, it contains much which we should welcome, both on the internal </p>
<p>situation in Iraq, and on the centrality of other regional issues, including MEPP and </p>
<p>engaging Syria and Iran … the ISG report means that there are now powerful voices </p>
<p>in Washington advocating change.”</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Mrs Beckett publicly welcomed the report as: </p>
<p>“… a substantial and complex piece of work, to which of course the Prime Minister </p>
<p>and senior [British] officials have contributed. From those discussions, [we] get the </p>
<p>impression that their thinking was broadly in line with our own but obviously we need </p>
<p>to read and digest their formal recommendations.”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>325. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that the recommendations had reflected a concern </p>
<p>that there was a limit to what could be achieved in Iraq and that it would be better to </p>
<p>focus on “working more closely with the likes of Iran and Syria and about finding a basis </p>
<p>to withdraw US forces sooner rather than later”.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>326. </b> In preparation for the 7 December meeting of DOP(I), officials prepared a paper on </p>
<p>military plans for Southern Iraq in 2007, and another paper on the UK’s objectives and </p>
<p>presence in Basra.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> The military plan for southern Iraq proposed the withdrawal of most UK troops </p>
<p>from bases in Basra city to Basra Air Station at the end of Op SINBAD which effectively </p>
<p>marked the “graduation exercise for the Iraqi Army in Southern Iraq”.</p>
<p>181</p>

<p><b>328. </b> The paper acknowledged that, in presentational terms, it would be “extremely </p>
<p>important to portray our plans as directly linked to supporting the Iraq Government and </p>
<p>provincial transfer decisions are Iraqi led”.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> The Basra paper was written by the FCO and considered the civilian implications </p>
<p>of the military plan and the “heightened security threat”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> FCO officials recommended </p>
<p>aiming for Provincial Iraqi Control in Basra at some point between March and June 2007. </p>
<p>Activity required to achieve that would be led from Basra Air Station as “there is no </p>
<p>prospect of our being able to recommend to Ministers a return to full staffing at Basra </p>
<p>Palace in the near future”. Although that meant limited numbers of staff and “tougher” </p>
<p>conditions, the FCO observed that “there will be significant advantages in co&#8209;location </p>
<p>with the military – making possible a more cohesive approach”.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> At its meeting on 7 December, DOP(I) agreed the overall intent of both the civilian </p>
<p>and military plans, and agreed that progress on the Forward Plan should be considered </p>
<p>at its next meeting.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> In discussion, the point was made that:</p>
<p>“It would be important to get the optics right. We should not be seen to be driven out </p>

<p>period to enable this to occur.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>334. </b> No mention of a surge of US troops was recorded in the discussion.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> After the press conference that followed the talks, Mr Blair and President Bush </p>
<p>discussed next steps on Iraq, including a comprehensive plan covering reconstruction, </p>
<p>capacity building, outreach and the role of international community, to be agreed with </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki. </p>
<p><b>336. </b> On 11 December, the Security Council considered quarterly reports on Iraq by the </p>
<p>UN Secretary&#8209;General and the MNF&#8209;I.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> Mr Qazi said that the UN Secretary&#8209;General’s </p>
<p>report provided “a sober and urgent warning that Iraq stands on the brink of civil war and </p>
<p>chaos”. Political transition achievements had not translated into improved security or </p>
<p>human rights. Peace initiatives had had no impact on the violence. Violence seemed out </p>
<p>of control, provoking widespread concern for Iraq’s future.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> The UN recognised that progress could only be made in the context of active </p>
<p>regional and international co&#8209;operation. The International Compact needed a viable </p>
<p>security and political environment in which to succeed. While efforts were under way to </p>
<p>build up the Iraqi Security Forces, self&#8209;sufficiency would take years. Mr Qazi concluded </p>
<p>with a warning that, if security deteriorated further, a major humanitarian and refugee </p>
<p>catastrophe might ensue.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> The UK Mission to the United Nations in New York reported to the FCO that it </p>
<p>had been:</p>
<p>“A noticeably downbeat presentation from Qazi, echoing the conclusions in SG </p>
<p>[Secretary&#8209;General] Annan’s report. In their interventions, most Security Council </p>
<p>members (coalition partners excepted) picked up on those aspects of the report </p>
<p>dealing with ‘civil war’ … and ‘regional contact group/international conference’… </p>
<p>predicting imminent arrival of the former and professing commitment to support </p>
<p>the latter. Much store was also set by Maliki’s National Reconciliation Plan and </p>
<p>the constitutional review mechanism. But rhetoric and lengthy interventions aside, </p>
<p>none appeared to offer new ideas, preferring instead to await any policy cue from </p>
<p>Washington.”</p>
<p><b>339. </b> On 12 December, Mr Hadley told Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the US Administration </p>
<p>could accept the need to support Iraqi initiative and ownership, President Bush was also </p>
<p>considering a US “bridge force” to help stem the violence in the first part of 2007 as “one </p>
<p>last major effort to get reconciliation off the ground”.</p>

<p><b>340. </b> On 14 December, at the request of the Iraq Senior Officials Group, the JIC </p>
<p>assessed the situation in “The Kurdish North”. It judged:</p>
<p>“… few Kurds subscribe to a sense of Iraqi nationhood. But Kurdish leaders accept </p>
<p>that the political and economic conditions for an independent Kurdish State are </p>
<p>lacking at present. The Kurds will bide their time (possibly for several years) while </p>
<p>taking what incremental steps they can to achieve de facto independence …</p>
<p>“The Kurdish north is the most stable region in Iraq … Stability will be maintained </p>
<p>after transition to Iraqi (Kurdish) control, now likely in January. There is greater </p>
<p>violence in more mixed areas on the periphery of the KRG such as Kirkuk, Tal Afar, </p>
<p>Sinjar and Mosul.”</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>341. </b> The JIC continued:</p>
<p>“We judge that the Kurds’ very strong bargaining position within the national </p>
<p>government means they are well placed to secure many of their key objectives. </p>
<p>They will resist any changes to the Iraqi constitution which threaten the autonomy </p>
<p>of the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), the position of the Peshmerga as </p>
<p>a regional guard force, or the KRG’s ability to control regional oil resources and </p>
<p>revenues.”</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The JIC judged that the city of Kirkuk would continue to be “a deeply emotive </p>
<p>issue” since:</p>
<p>“Most Kurds regard the city as inherently Kurdish and an essential asset for an </p>
<p>independent Kurdistan … But Kurdish plans will be opposed. The Turkomen still </p>
<p>claim Kirkuk as their cultural capital. There are also sizeable Arab Sunni, Arab Shia, </p>
<p>Assyrian and Christian communities: most want a special status for Kirkuk as a </p>
<p>federal region under some form of power sharing arrangement …</p>
<p>“Violence has been increasing; since June there have been several suicide </p>
<p>attacks … Ethnic and sectarian fighting has also escalated. The bulk of the violence </p>
<p>can be attributed to Sunni nationalist insurgents and jihadists, but elements of Jaysh </p>
<p>al&#8209;Mahdi and SCIRI’s Badr Organisation have also been implicated … continued </p>
<p>efforts to oust mostly Arab residents risk serious violence, both in the city and in </p>
<p>other mixed areas.”</p>
<p><b>343. </b> On 17 December, Mr Blair visited Baghdad and Basra, accompanied by </p>
<p>Mr Jonathan Powell, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr Asquith.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>344. </b> Mr Blair had a bilateral discussion with Prime Minister Maliki, who had been very </p>
<p>negative about Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr and consequently focused on building ISF capability </p>
<p>“to allow him to deal with the militias”. In relation to the South “he welcomed the progress </p>

<p>play a support role to Iraqi forces”.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Over lunch, President Talabani told Mr Blair that the Iraqi Army was developing, </p>
<p>but needed better logistics and was lacking arms and ammunition. He also observed </p>
<p>that “military success could only come through harnessing the support of local people”. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> On 19 December, Sir David Manning wrote to Mr Sawers, and sent copies </p>
<p>to Mr Peter Hayes (Mrs Beckett’s Principal Private Secretary), Mr Peter Ricketts </p>
<p>(FCO Permanent Under Secretary), Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr Jonathan Powell.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>347. </b> Sir David reported signs that President Bush would reject the majority of </p>
<p>recommendations in the Iraq Study Group report and “dig in rather than exploit the </p>
<p>opening that the ISG report provides”. He wrote: </p>
<p>“… the signs point to him [President Bush] adopting a contentious policy of surging </p>
<p>additional troops into Baghdad. The argument appears to be that this will help </p>
<p>restore order to the capital, and give Maliki the breathing space he needs to go after </p>
<p>Sadr and other militias. This may have a certain intellectual plausibility, but there are </p>
<p>few in Washington who believe in its political viability.” </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Mr Blair wrote to President Bush on 20 December, in part to report his recent </p>
<p>visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> He emphasised the importance of support for Prime Minister Maliki, </p>
<p>through increasing the speed at which the Iraqi Army was developing, supporting the </p>
<p>reconciliation and outreach work, and helping to create a more effective system for the </p>
<p>disbursement of money within Iraq. </p>
<p><b>349. </b> Mr Blair reported that, in MND(SE), he had found UK forces with “surprisingly high </p>
<p>morale” and in no doubt that Iran was the major player behind the violence. </p>
<p><b>350. </b> On extra troops for Baghdad Mr Blair wrote “It’s your call obviously …” but added:</p>
<p>“For what it’s worth, I think this might be sensible short term but only as part of a </p>
<p>wider plan to boost Iraqi capability. There is no doubt US forces can lock down parts </p>
<p>of Baghdad. But … it is only very short term respite. So there has to be Iraqi force </p>
<p>plus reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>351. </b> Mr Blair concluded his note by commenting: “My point is simply: whatever you do, </p>
<p>the only ultimate solution is Iraqi.” </p>
<p><b>352. </b> The following day Sir David Manning reported that President Bush had asked </p>
<p>Secretary Gates to provide him with options for a possible surge of US forces focused </p>
<p>on Baghdad and Anbar province, but had not yet taken a decision.</p>

<p><b>353. </b> The British Embassy Washington did not know what Secretary Gates’ views and </p>
<p>advice would be but colleagues in the National Security Council and State Department </p>
<p>had said they should expect “surges” in US support for reconciliation and reconstruction. </p>
<p>A new Iraq strategy was expected to be announced by President Bush in the second </p>
<p>week of January. </p>
<p><b>354. </b> Sir David’s advice was that:</p>
<p>“… we should remain cautious about drawing conclusions before the meetings of </p>
<p>Principals have taken place. Right now the presumption is that there will be a surge </p>
<p>in the level of US troops in the first half of 2007.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>357. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra reported that when British troops entered the </p>
<p>HQ they found 127 prisoners, over 80 percent of whom showed signs of torture. The ISF </p>
<p>played a “significant” role in the operation, processing and transferring the prisoners, </p>
<p>although last minute “cold feet” had meant that the Iraqi Brigade intended to supply an </p>
<p>outer cordon were ordered not to do so. </p>
<p><b>358. </b> The British Embassy Office also reported a significant Iraqi reaction to the attack. </p>
<p>Although the view of the majority of Basrawis was “good riddance”, some members of </p>
<p>the Basra Provincial Council publicly criticised the operation. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that it was a “deliberate operation” that he had </p>
<p>discussed with the Basra security committee in advance:</p>
<p>“Minister Bulani, who was Minister of the Interior, authorised the disbandment of </p>
<p>the Serious Crimes Unit. When we went to see Maliki in, I think it was mid to late </p>
<p>October, with the security committee, he directed Hamadi to crush the police death </p>
<p>squads. Before the operation, one of the Basra judges issued an arrest warrant for </p>
<p>the 62 most wanted of the police.”</p>

<p><b>361. </b> Mr Blair was scheduled to speak to President Bush on 29 December.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>briefing note provided by his Private Secretary explained that the UK expected that </p>
<p>President Bush would make an announcement in early January that he would increase </p>
<p>the number of US troops in Iraq (possibly by as many as 30,000) for at least the first half </p>
<p>of 2007. The note explained that such a surge would be “awkward” for the UK as:</p>
<p>“… our plans in Basra go in the opposite direction. If a decision is taken to close </p>
<p>Shaibah logistics base in the new year, we aim to drawdown by at least one </p>
<p>battlegroup at the next troop rotation in May. </p>
<p>“You should, therefore, probe Bush on his plans, insofar as they are finalised and </p>
<p>say that we will need to co&#8209;ordinate closely with them to ensure that we are seen </p>
<p>to be working from the same script.”</p>
<p><b>362. </b> During their phone call, Mr Blair told President Bush that he had returned from </p>
<p>his visit to Iraq “convinced that we had to see the job through”.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> He had found similar </p>
<p>determination in Baghdad and Basra along with a greater sense of unity of purpose </p>
<p>amongst Iraqi politicians. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> They discussed the US evaluation of the Iraq Study Group and the need for the US </p>
<p>to “muscle up” in Baghdad to give the Iraqi Government room to do what was necessary. </p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Blair commented that the problem was how to build the capability of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, which was essentially “starting from scratch”. </p>
<p><b>365. </b> On 29 December, Maj Gen Shirreff wrote to Mr Blair in follow&#8209;up to his visit </p>
<p>proposing the establishment of a “Joint Inter&#8209;Agency Task Force” in Basra led by </p>
<p>the GOC MND(SE).</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> In his view this would “deliver concentrated British effect” and </p>
<p>“improve the prospects of strategic success”. </p>
<p><b>366. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff’s diagnosis was that the existing arrangement, with the PRT </p>
<p>located in Kuwait, “lacks unity of command and unity of purpose”. The solution was </p>
<p>“a single organisation capable of planning, executing and commanding both security/</p>
<p>military assistance and reconstruction operations”. </p>

<p>On Saturday 30 December 2006 Saddam Hussein was hanged, having been sentenced </p>

<p>200</p>
<p>Only a small number of people witnessed the execution but film of the moments leading </p>
<p>up to it was shown on Iraqi state television. Footage showing the execution itself later </p>
<p>appeared on the internet, apparently captured using a mobile phone. </p>
<p>After the hanging, Mrs Beckett said:</p>
<p>“I welcome the fact that Saddam Hussein has been tried for at least some of the </p>
<p>appalling crimes he committed against the Iraqi people. He has now been held to </p>
<p>account. The British Government does not support the use of the death penalty, </p>
<p>in Iraq or anywhere else … We have made our position very clear to the Iraqi </p>

<p>201</p>
<p>Appearing at a joint session of the Defence and Foreign Affairs Select Committees on </p>

<p>“We have continued since the execution of Saddam Hussein to express our concerns </p>

<p><b>368. </b> On the same day, Secretary Rice told Mrs Beckett that President Bush was likely </p>
<p>to announce the conclusions of his review of Iraq policy the following week, but: </p>
<p>“Contrary to media reports he had not taken any final decisions on the </p>
<p>proposed ‘surge’ of 20,000 troops into Baghdad and was still considering Gates’ </p>
<p>recommendations.”</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>369. </b> The following day, the Chiefs of Staff were briefed on:</p>
<p>“… the likelihood that a ‘surge’ of forces would be conducted with the aim of </p>
<p>‘breaking sectarian violence as the US transitioned’: associated implications for the </p>
<p>UK which included the difficult presentational issue of a UK transition coinciding with </p>
<p>a US surge and the possibility that an aggressive anti&#8209;militia campaign in the North </p>
<p>would result in increased insurgency in the South …”</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>370. </b> That possibility meant that there was a “critical need for the UK to have some </p>
<p>influence on US operational planning”. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> In the discussion on operations in Afghanistan that followed, Lt Gen Houghton </p>
<p>explained that it would be important that the Worcester and Sherwood Foresters </p>
<p>Regiment was stood down from Op TELIC by the end of January 2007 “to meet the </p>
<p>enduring liability” in Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> In his weekly report on 4 January, Maj Gen Shirreff defended his decision to attack </p>
<p>the Jameat police station on Christmas Day:</p>
<p>“If I had left this up to the Iraqis to do it the Iraqi way (as we did in October) there </p>
<p>would have been no operation. I judged that there was an operational imperative </p>
<p>to carry out the operation; hence my decision to go for it … I wanted to send </p>
<p>an unequivocal message two ways: to our US allies that we are serious about </p>
<p>conducting decisive, kinetic operations against the SCU [Serious Crime Unit]</p>

<p>that Maj Gen Shirreff’s views were not held by the MOD corporately. </p>
<p><b>375. </b> Although better co&#8209;ordination and control were needed, a new organisation need </p>
<p>not necessarily be military&#8209;led. Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Group that Iraq was “entering </p>
<p>a new phase, which required a coherent structure under a single point of contact” and </p>
<p>asked the Iraq Senior Officials Group to work on new structures. </p>
<p><b>376. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald reported to Mr Blair after the meeting that Maj Gen Shirreff’s </p>
<p>views:</p>
<p>“… represent his frustration, shared by the MOD, that the civilian reconstruction </p>

<p>led Basra operation for the next year (at least).”</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Sir Nigel reported that co&#8209;location of everyone at Basra Air Station, from late </p>
<p>February onwards, would “help enormously” and that he had asked for advice on the </p>
<p>right structure, though the view was that “it should be civilian led, with strong military </p>
<p>input and follow&#8209;up”. Sir Nigel had added that both DFID and the FCO were:</p>
<p>“… very fed up with Shirreff’s disparaging comments about the civilian effort … </p>
<p>But the fact is that there have been constant problems between the military and </p>
<p>civilian people in Basra from the start. We must make a last effort to get a joined&#8209;up </p>

<p>security situation on the ground and the level of capability of Iraqi Army and Police </p>
<p>forces.”</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Sir Nigel judged that:</p>
<p>“The <b>US decision</b> to put extra combat forces into Baghdad could have </p>
<p>repercussions in Basra. If, for example, there are major operations in Sadr City, </p>
<p>the JAM will react badly in Baghdad and possibly in Basra. This could lead to a </p>
<p>deterioration in the security situation in Basra just as we are trying to re&#8209;posture. </p>
<p>It could at the very least delay our plans. This is one of the reasons why the UK </p>
<p>Chiefs of Staff are so nervous about US plans, but it is not the only one: their </p>
<p>main concern is that this surge will simply be a re&#8209;run of the first two phases of the </p>
<p>Baghdad security plan.” </p>
<p><b>381. </b> Sir Nigel attached a Cabinet Office note on Basra which he described as </p>
<p>suggesting “a pretty patchy picture”. </p>
<p><b>382. </b> The note said that 14 of the 16 planned “pulses” in Op SINBAD had taken place </p>
<p>so far. There had been some successes but there were concerns about relations with </p>
<p>the Basra Security Committee, about the capacity of the Iraqi Army 10th Division, whose </p>
<p>performance had been “mixed”, and about the return of militia control in particular areas. </p>
<p><b>383. </b> The Cabinet Office reported that: “Despite these problems, MOD still assesses that </p>
<p>we are on track to achieve Provincial Iraqi Control in Basra in May 2007.” Beside this, </p>
<p>Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“But how can we do this if we have not secured Basra?”</p>
<p><b>384. </b> The Cabinet Office note concluded with a reminder of the importance of explaining </p>
<p>the UK’s transition strategy effectively to the US, the Iraqis and other key allies, noting </p>
<p>that “some suspect … us of pursuing our own agenda or wanting to withdraw as quickly </p>
<p>as possible”. The Cabinet Office considered:</p>
<p>“Although the potential surge in US forces in Baghdad presents an optical problem </p>
<p>for both the UK and US, this can be explained by pointing out that Operation </p>
<p>SINBAD was the equivalent UK surge, taking place in Basra sooner because of the </p>
<p>different security situation there.”</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Blair wrote on the document:</p>
<p>“But the issue is not UK withdrawing troops and the US increasing them; it is </p>
<p>whether in Basra the conditions for draw&#8209;down have been met.”</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Sir Nigel also supplied Mr Blair with a minute setting out key points in preparation </p>

<p><b>387. </b> In relation to the surge of US forces, Sir Nigel wrote that there was “insufficient </p>
<p>clarity on the nature of the mission – is this just a repeat of the Baghdad security plan; </p>
<p>or does it go wider, eg Anbar, border with Iran etc?” </p>
<p><b>388. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald suggested that Mr Blair should discuss with President Bush:</p>
<p>“–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The need for him to present this as a <b>change</b> of policy, though not of course of </p>
<p>objectives …</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The need to put emphasis both in public and in terms of the follow&#8209;up on <b>Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>capability</b> …</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The need to make clear that the <b>numbers and mission of coalition forces </b></p>
<p><b>depends on the situation on the ground.</b> So what happens in Baghdad (surge </p>
<p>of US forces) should not pre&#8209;determine what happens in <b>Basra</b> (where we </p>
<p>anticipate a drawdown over the next six months following Operation Sinbad). </p>
<p>It is important that Bush does not say anything next week which prejudices </p>
<p>our plans …” </p>
<p><b>389. </b> Sir Nigel was explicit that the UK Chiefs of Staff did not support the US surge. </p>
<p><b>390. </b> On 5 January, President Bush briefed Mr Blair ahead of his speech on Iraq the </p>
<p>following week.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> During the call he described a significant increase in US and Iraqi </p>
<p>troops, and a number of personnel changes. </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Blair said that it was vital to break the back of the violence in Baghdad. He </p>
<p>urged President Bush to focus on reconciliation and reconstruction as well as security, </p>
<p>suggesting that it might be helpful to designate individuals who would be accountable </p>
<p>for leading work on those areas.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> Mr Blair suggested that it would be vital to make clear that the coalition was </p>
<p>supporting Iraqi efforts to establish security, so that “it did not look like it was just about </p>
<p>increasing US troops”. President Bush agreed. </p>
<p><b>393. </b> On 6 January, Prime Minister Maliki delivered what Mr Asquith described as </p>
<p>a “robust” speech for Iraq’s Army Day, in which he called for Armed Forces that were </p>
<p>without political bias, cohesive in the national interest and protected from political </p>
<p>interference and militia.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> He warned: </p>
<p>“We will not allow anybody to be an alternative to the state, whether the militias </p>
<p>or anybody else, regardless of their affiliations … We will confront them firmly.” </p>
<p><b>394. </b> The following day, Mr Asquith met Prime Minister Maliki to congratulate him on </p>

<p>the US review and in the light of our plans in Basra – we and the US attempt to help </p>
<p>the Iraqi government entrench genuine change and progress in the areas of security, </p>

<p>and to take rapid action to fix these.”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The letter asked for detailed reports and weekly updates on key areas, specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>215</p>
<p> </p>

<p> Mr Blair said that </p>

<p><b>400. </b> President Bush announced the new US strategy in an address to the nation on </p>

<p> He said:</p>
<p>“The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people – and it is </p>
<p>unacceptable to me …</p>
<p>“It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>401. </b> The most urgent priority was security, especially in Baghdad, where:</p>
<p>“… violence is splitting Baghdad into sectarian enclaves, and shaking the confidence </p>
<p>of all Iraqis …</p>
<p>“Our past efforts to secure Baghdad failed for two principal reasons: There were not </p>
<p>enough Iraqi and American troops to secure neighbourhoods that had been cleared </p>
<p>of terrorists and insurgents. And there were too many restrictions on the troops we </p>
<p>did have.”</p>
<p><b>402. </b> President Bush announced that the Iraqi Government would appoint a military </p>
<p>commander and two deputy commanders for Baghdad, and planned to deploy 18 Iraqi </p>
<p>Army and National Police brigades. They would be supported by more than 20,000 </p>
<p>additional US troops. Those troops would work alongside Iraqi units and be embedded </p>
<p>in their formations. President Bush said:</p>
<p>“Our troops will have a well&#8209;defined mission: to help Iraqis clear and secure </p>
<p>neighbourhoods, to help them protect the local population, and to help ensure </p>

<p>The MOD proposed to consolidate MNF at a single operating base at Basra Air Station </p>
<p>by the end of May. That would enable UK forces to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deliver enhanced Iraqi Army training through enlarged military training teams </p>
<p>and a dedicated Joint Leadership Academy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve support to the rule of law through concentrated work with the Iraqi </p>
<p>police in areas such as forensics and continued mentoring at the Provincial Joint </p>
<p>Co&#8209;ordination Centre (see Section 12.1); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintain a dedicated force reserve to ensure that they could react to events and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>reduce MNF vulnerability and exposure to attack, particularly indirect fire; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve co&#8209;ordination with the UK civilian effort in MND(SE), much of which had </p>

<p><b>411. </b> DOP(I) recognised that final decisions could not be made until after Mr Browne had </p>
<p>discussed the proposals in greater detail with Secretary Gates.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> There was concern </p>
<p>that the US appeared to be adopting a “more purist approach” to the criteria to be met </p>
<p>before transition to PIC and that this was likely to delay transition in Maysan. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> The IPU wrote a paper proposing an engagement strategy regarding the UK’s </p>

<p>affected by the proposed relocation to the Air Station, for the same meeting of DOP(I).</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>413. </b> The paper said that civilian staff, including from the US State Department and the </p>

<p>that all were content to relocate to Basra Air Station. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> The IPU advised that it should be made clear that there was “no separate UK </p>
<p>agenda in the South” and that there had been no unilateral decision&#8209;making by the UK.</p>
<p><b>415. </b> The paper suggested that key messages to reinforce with US interlocutors </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There is no separate UK agenda in the South. We have not taken any unilateral </p>
<p>UK decisions, nor will we. We are part of the coalition and will continue to act as </p>
<p>such. What we plan in the South is part of the MNF Transition Bridging Strategy. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We remain committed to delivering the agreed conditions in Maysan &amp; Basra, </p>

<p><b>416. </b> After considering the IPU’s paper, it was decided that Mrs Beckett, Mr Browne and </p>

<p>…</p>
<p>“III. The security situation remains the main obstacle to domestic private sector </p>
<p>investment and foreign investment. The inability of the security forces to create a </p>
<p>safe environment for engineers to carry out repairs inhibits reconstruction. But even </p>
<p>in a benign security environment, Iraq would still face severe economic challenges.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi authorities were planning, in the context of the Baghdad Security Plan, </p>
<p>to close the Syrian and Iranian borders. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih had agreed to energise governance of the </p>
<p>energy sector, and would chair a committee of Ministers on which Lt Gen Lamb </p>
<p>would sit.</p>
<p><b>429. </b> On planning for transition, Lt Gen Lamb commented:</p>
<p>“Get it right, and all our Christmases will come at once – it is powerful. Get it wrong </p>
<p>and we potentially set ourselves up for a very messy finish.” </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Blair met Secretary Gates on 14 January and discussed the recent US </p>
<p>announcement and the UK plans for MND(SE).</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> Mr Blair contrasted security in </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra, noting that this was a distinction that Prime Minister Maliki was </p>
<p>always keen to draw. He said that the UK would not make its decision on re&#8209;posturing </p>
<p>and drawing down its forces in Basra unless it was absolutely clear that the conditions </p>
<p>had been met. It was essential to be confident that the Iraqi forces could hold Basra after </p>
<p>UK withdrawal.</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Secretary Gates welcomed that reassurance, explaining that the US would prefer </p>
<p>the UK to remain in Basra until later in the year. In his view, Basra was not yet ready for </p>
<p>transition. He was also concerned that a UK withdrawal would create political difficulties </p>
<p>for other coalition partners and could have a negative impact on other countries’ </p>
<p>contribution to the MNF. </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s record of the meeting also noted that Mr Blair had mentioned </p>
<p>Afghanistan “in the context of our proposed drawdown in Basra”.</p>
<p><b>433. </b> On 15 January, the British Embassy Office Basra reported receipt of a letter </p>
<p>from the Chairman of the Provincial Council which set a number of conditions to be </p>
<p>met before re&#8209;engagement with the UK would be considered.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> They included an </p>
<p>official apology, compensation and withdrawal from specified MNF bases in Basra city. </p>
<p>The British Embassy Office recommended “a robust line” in response. </p>
<p><b>434. </b> On 16 January, Mr Blair met ACM Stirrup and senior officials from the FCO, the </p>
<p>MOD, SIS, DFID and the Cabinet Office for an update on Iraq.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>435. </b> Mr Blair asked how the proposal to draw down to 4,500 troops would affect the </p>
<p>UK’s capability in Basra. ACM Stirrup assured him that:</p>

<p><b>436. </b> ACM Stirrup said that Gen Casey understood and was comfortable with the idea of </p>
<p>the UK drawing down to 4,500 troops by May:</p>
<p>“His concerns centred on the idea of ‘leaving Basra unattended’ (which we did not </p>
<p>plan to do), the performance of the police, and Iranian activity. Moreover, Gates had </p>
<p>agreed that the coalition should aim to get out of the centre of Iraqi cities.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>437. </b> Mr Blair asked about work on joint civilian and military structures to deliver </p>
<p>“assistance” in Basra, as proposed by Maj Gen Shirreff. ACM Stirrup said that it was too </p>
<p>late in the day to implement Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal; building capacity in the Iraqi </p>
<p>system was now the focus and should not be militarily&#8209;led. Co&#8209;location of civilian and </p>
<p>military personnel at Basra Air Station would help. </p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 17 January, the JIC assessed developments in Iraqi security strategy, the </p>
<p>readiness of the ISF and prospects for transition of security to Iraqi control.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>439. </b> The Assessment said that sectarian violence had deepened over the past </p>
<p>six months, and attacks on the MNF were “reaching new highs”. There had been </p>
<p>“no coherent Iraqi national security strategy in response”. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“I. The Iraqi Government’s approach to security reflects its sectarian make&#8209;up: </p>
<p>the Shia and Kurds want to take control of security in their own areas first. Plans </p>
<p>for dealing politically with the Sunni Arab insurgency remain unclear. There is no </p>
<p>coherent Iraqi national security strategy.</p>
<p>“II. The lack of united national political direction is reflected in Iraq’s national security </p>
<p>machinery which remains unco&#8209;ordinated and only partially effective: undermined </p>
<p>by personal and party rivalries, endemic corruption and the absence of a capable </p>
<p>bureaucracy. This is unlikely to change significantly in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“V. The success of new US plans will depend in part on the willingness of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to take on sectarian and political militias. Maliki will not take action </p>
<p>which risks breaking the Shia United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) and bringing down his </p>
<p>government. Only a small proportion of the ISF are currently both willing and able </p>
<p>to take on the Shia militias.”</p>
<p><b>441. </b> A summary of contact with JAM1, produced by a senior government official </p>
<p>specialising in the Middle East (1) in 2007, said that in late 2006 officials “began to look </p>

<p>had growing doubts about the impact of JAM’s attacks on MNF&#8209;I”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>442. </b> On 18 January, in the first of her weekly reports from Basra (as requested by </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 8 January), Dr Rosalind Marsden, British Consul General </p>
<p>in Basra, set out the need to discuss security and other issues with appropriate Basra </p>
<p>representatives.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> She wrote: </p>
<p>“The reaction of the Provincial Council, Emergency Security Committee (ESC) and </p>
<p>PDoP [Provincial Director of Police] to the Jameat operation [on Christmas Day] </p>
<p>illustrates the level of fear that JAM have inspired in Basra’s political and security </p>
<p>leadership. All three are dysfunctional. With very few exceptions, Provincial Council </p>
<p>members are regarded as corrupt, self&#8209;serving, intimidated by the militias and, </p>
<p>in some cases, criminal … The PDoP and the ESC are widely regarded here as </p>
<p>weak and ineffective. The Governor claims that he has lobbied in Baghdad for </p>
<p>their removal …</p>
<p>“The arrest of Sayid Naji, Basra’s JAM commander, on 18 December has caused </p>
<p>some disruption to militant JAM. MND(SE) continue strike operations to sustain </p>
<p>this disruptive effect and keep JAM leaders on the run. However, over the last few </p>
<p>weeks, JAM have continued to mount IDF and other attacks on MNF … An American </p>
<p>citizen was kidnapped on 5 January at a checkpoint north of Basra, almost certainly </p>
<p>by JAM. The American is still missing and the two Iraqis who accompanied him have </p>
<p>been found dead. Although militant JAM are relatively small in number, they are </p>
<p>externally supported and getting more professional.”</p>
<p><b>443. </b> The Prime Minister considered that the weekly report had been “excellent” and </p>
<p>was looking forward to more of the same.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> He and the Senior Officials Group agreed </p>
<p>with Dr Marsden’s recommendation that she insist on an end to any boycott of the MNF </p>
<p>before discussions on preparation for PIC could begin.</p>
<p><b>444. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… it was pretty clear to me that … looking over the period as a whole of my time </p>
<p>in command – we had a strategy that involved extraction rather than necessarily </p>
<p>achieving mission success. It was, in a sense, an exit strategy rather than a winning </p>
<p>strategy. A winning strategy was going to require significant additional resources.”</p>

<p><b>445. </b> Major General Jonathan Shaw, who became GOC MND(SE) in mid&#8209;January 2007, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that he “wasn’t there” when negotiations with JAM1 first began and that </p>
<p>“they were started by [officials working closely with the military]”, adding:</p>
<p>“… I can tell you from my perspective where it began. It began right back in January </p>
<p>when I arrived, the germ of the idea had probably been in my head before I got </p>
<p>there.”</p>
<p>240</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>446. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry that he had quickly concluded that “trying to </p>
<p>annihilate JAM in a kinetic attritional confrontation was a bit futile” and that the way to </p>
<p>deal with them was to “kill the irreconcilable and … take the reconcilable on board”.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a consequence “in January the idea started coming to me that we had to start looking </p>
<p>for someone to talk to”. </p>

<p>to talk to in JAM”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>448. </b> On 19 January, Maj Gen Shirreff completed his post&#8209;tour report.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> In it he argued:</p>
<p>“… I am not convinced that we have correctly identified the strategic Main Effort and </p>
<p>resourced it appropriately to avoid potentially disastrous failure in Iraq.</p>
<p>“We have no choice but to achieve mission success in Iraq. This means </p>
<p>concentrating resources in pursuit of national interests: clouting, not dribbling. </p>
<p>As we hand over, it is encouraging to see that the importance of committing UKSF </p>
<p>[Special Forces] to support our efforts in SE Iraq has been recognised. However, </p>
<p>we have left it very late and depended on a willing and generous ally to make good </p>
<p>other shortfalls. I suspect that if we had concentrated strategic assets from the start </p>
<p>of TELIC, the margin between success and failure would not be so narrow as it </p>
<p>appears now.</p>
<p>“The same point applies to the Comprehensive Approach. We have preached its </p>
<p>virtues in theory without giving genuine substance to it on the ground … Compare </p>
<p>the generosity, agility and flexibility of US CERP [Commanders Emergency </p>
<p>Response Program] funding with the parsimony of Whitehall and the lack of any </p>
<p>unity of command or purpose.”</p>
<p><b>449. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff concluded his report:</p>
<p>“We can achieve mission success here [in MND(SE)] however complex and </p>
<p>intractable the problems facing us. The key is to understand the narrowness of the </p>
<p>margin between success and failure and to take nothing for granted.”</p>

<p>including Maj Gen Shaw.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> The American Forces Press Service reported a press brief </p>

<p><b>451. </b> On 19 January, Mr McDonald wrote to Mrs Beckett with a report on his recent visit </p>
<p>to Iraq, which he said had left him feeling more optimistic.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>452. </b> Mr McDonald judged that: President Bush’s new strategy had been well received; </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki was showing greater energy and looking more like a leader, </p>
<p>including by taking action against Sunni insurgents, the JAM leadership and Iran; and </p>
<p>the latest Baghdad Security Plan looked “more likely to succeed than its predecessors” </p>
<p>because of greater Iraqi ownership. </p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr McDonald commented: “Iraq will take a long time to put itself back together; in </p>
<p>the end we may not be able to prevent it from falling apart. Meaningful reconciliation will </p>
<p>take a generation.” He recommended deferring a referendum on Kirkuk’s status, which </p>
<p>could be deeply divisive.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> On Basra, Mr McDonald considered: </p>
<p>“… transition rather than Provincial Iraqi Control should be our focus. PIC is a </p>
<p>somewhat arbitrarily chosen event. If the process of transition is our focus, our </p>
<p>record looks better: completed in Muthanna and Dhi Qar, substantially under way </p>
<p>in Maysan, and beginning in Basra.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>455. </b> Mr McDonald asked:</p>
<p>“… what is the minimum we have to achieve before we leave? I conclude that </p>
<p>the answer is to give Iraq’s nascent democratic institutions a fighting chance to </p>
<p>overcome the insurgents and foreign agents. We cannot give them more than that, </p>
<p>and the best way to help them now is to leave in a manner negotiated with them. </p>
<p>If we cannot announce a timetable (which would potentially transform our relations </p>
<p>with MAS [Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr]) I recommend that departure be an explicit aspiration, </p>
<p>say before the end of 2007. We shall have to accept that the next phase, with fewer </p>

<p><b>457. </b> In his weekly report on 21 January, Lt Gen Lamb observed: </p>
<p>“… the situation we find ourselves in Iraq is perhaps the most complex that I </p>
<p>have ever seen in my 35 years of soldiering … Every one of our actions results in </p>
<p>multiple and unexpected consequences – requiring an increased understanding of </p>
<p>the unintended implications that occur … But … one thing seems to have become </p>
<p>crystal clear – the detrimental effect that Iranian influence is having on the people </p>
<p>of Iraq, whether they be Sunni, Shia or Kurd alike.</p>
<p>“Recent Government of Iraq (GOI) and US actions that have ‘stressed’ the Iranian </p>
<p>Quds [Force]</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> have had a significantly positive effect both on the political front, and </p>
<p>the prospects for reconciliation. The Sunnis are encouraged … But, perhaps more </p>
<p>notable though are the many Shia moderates who have also seen the actions as a </p>
<p>positive move … in curtailing what they see as a malign Iranian influence … </p>
<p>“So, I sense that we may have just underestimated the nature and danger of the </p>
<p>Iranian influence … They all fear the extent to which the influence could undermine </p>
<p>the Iraqi culture and potentially that of Islam in the region itself …</p>
<p>“The Persian tiger, I sense, therefore has a direct effect on the issue of practical </p>
<p>reconciliation, if not the outcome of our endeavour. If the militias are seen to be the </p>
<p>accelerant, then I would venture that the removal of the malign Iranian influence </p>
<p>would represent a major decelerator to the situation.”</p>

<p>The situation would improve after the move to Basra Air Station. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> On reconciliation, officials reported:</p>
<p>“… a certain amount of complacency amongst Iraqi politicians, who believed that </p>
<p>reconciliation would simply happen, without the ground having to be carefully </p>
<p>prepared, and that a great deal of ad hoc activity was attempted and then, often, </p>
<p>simply discarded”. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> In a conversation with President Bush on 22 January, Mr Blair said that in Basra </p>
<p>the UK had found that having Iraqis leading work prominently was making a significant </p>
<p>difference and that tangible progress on reconstruction paid dividends.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> Efforts on </p>
<p>reconciliation and reconstruction needed to be intensified. </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Blair emphasised the importance of outreach to the Sunni community, and </p>
<p>proposed choosing a particular Sunni area in which to agree a cease&#8209;fire in return for </p>
<p>clear commitments on reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>465. </b> On the same day, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote to the FCO to report Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>thanks for the briefing received in response to the request of 8 January.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Blair felt that it underlined “the necessity of securing better reconciliation and </p>
<p>reconstruction plans and of filling gaps in Iraqi Army capacity” and commissioned further </p>
<p>reports on the action being taken against militant JAM in southern Iraq; Lt Gen Lamb’s </p>
<p>negotiations in Anbar; and shortfalls and bottlenecks in developing ISF capability. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> At the request of the Iraq Senior Officials Group, on 24 January the JIC considered </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government’s willingness to curb the power of Iraqi Shia militias and the </p>
<p>implications of taking action against them.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>468. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“I. Muqtada al Sadr’s Jaysh al Mahdi (JAM) and the Supreme Council for Islamic </p>
<p>Revolution in Iraq’s (SCIRI) Badr Organisation are behind much of the anti&#8209;Sunni </p>
<p>sectarian violence in Iraq. Both militias’ political sponsors are key elements of the </p>
<p>Shia United Iraqi Alliance (UIA) and powerful forces within the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p>Badr in particular are deeply embedded in official security and political structures </p>
<p>and will not be rooted out in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“II. Prime Minister Maliki still seeks a political accommodation: he wants Sadr to </p>
<p>exert greater control over the JAM and rein in the more violent elements. Maliki </p>

<p>would probably regard this as removing the need for tough MNF or ISF action. </p>
<p>Sadr is taking some action, but we doubt that he or many JAM leaders are prepared </p>
<p>to disarm in the current security climate.”</p>
<p><b>469. </b> If the Iraqi Government did act, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“… any perception that a full scale assault on JAM had begun or that Sadr was </p>
<p>being personally targeted would be most likely to provoke fierce resistance. In such </p>
<p>circumstances, violence would be likely across the southern provinces: in the worst </p>
<p>case it could reach levels similar to those during the Sadrist uprisings of 2004.”</p>
<p><b>470. </b> The JIC concluded that the Iraqi Government’s “symbiotic relationship” with the </p>
<p>militias was a significant factor in Sunni disaffection and reluctance to engage in the </p>
<p>national reconciliation agenda. It judged that Prime Minister Maliki:</p>
<p>“… genuinely wants to reduce violence. He accepts that some limited action against </p>
<p>JAM is necessary. But despite recent assurances to the US and robust public </p>
<p>comments, he will not support the sort of sustained military campaign needed to </p>
<p>remove JAM’s ability to keep parts of Baghdad outside government control.</p>
<p>“Maliki’s overriding concern is the survival of the UIA and his government: like other </p>
<p>Shia politicians he has a deep&#8209;rooted fear of a Ba’athist return. The UIA remains </p>
<p>fragile and its survival is dependent on Maliki’s ability to balance the competing </p>
<p>interests of the rival SCIRI and Sadrist heavyweights … </p>
<p>“We judge that any other Shia politician in Maliki’s position … would face similar </p>
<p>pressures and behave in much the same way.”</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Mr Blair on 24 January setting out his thinking about plans </p>
<p>for future force levels in Iraq.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> Mr Browne intended to use his visit to Iraq the following </p>
<p>week to confirm whether the plans were appropriate in scope and timing and to address </p>
<p>reported US concerns. He wrote:</p>
<p>“Re&#8209;posturing … reflects the growing capability of the ISF to take on a greater role </p>
<p>ahead of a formal announcement of PIC. It is happening across Iraq. For example, </p>
<p>just last week the Corps agreed that … [the Iraqi Army] would take the lead in Mosul, </p>
<p>Iraq’s third largest city …</p>
<p>“Of course Basra is different …” </p>
<p><b>472. </b> In the US Administration, Mr Browne reported that:</p>
<p>“Casey and Khalilzad have recently expressed concerns both about the optics of a </p>
<p>relocation of the US Regional Office from Basra Palace and the risk of leaving Basra </p>
<p>in hock to Iranian backed elements. The fact is that the level of violence remains </p>
<p>relatively low – half that in Mosul, and a fraction of that in Baghdad and most </p>

<p>is very low compared with many areas in Iraq …</p>
<p>“While acknowledging serious US concerns we must take the opportunity to build </p>
<p>momentum towards Iraqi control … </p>
<p>“There is no question of us leaving a vacuum in the city, as the IA [Iraqi Army] and </p>
<p>IPS [Iraqi Police Service] are already doing patrols and we will remain present in the </p>
<p>Provincial Joint Co&#8209;ordination Centre and military transition teams …”</p>
<p><b>473. </b> On the impact of reducing troop numbers, Mr Browne said:</p>
<p>“The clear military advice … is that re&#8209;posturing and the associated drawdown will </p>
<p>not adversely affect our capacity to provide support to the Iraqi Security Forces, </p>
<p>including underwriting it by providing a battlegroup size reserve force. We must </p>
<p>recognise that after re&#8209;posturing re&#8209;intervention would not be straight&#8209;forward but </p>
<p>this is a nettle that must be grasped at some stage.</p>
<p>“I share your view that … we need to have carefully considered the implications both </p>
<p>for security in Basra … and any knock on effect of the impending Baghdad initiative. </p>
<p>But I can assure you that the military advice, as outlined by CDS, is based on </p>
<p>precisely this kind of careful consideration …”</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Mr Browne added:</p>
<p>“So while there are inevitable risks and uncertainties I am confident we are doing our </p>
<p>best to manage them. And we must also acknowledge that there are risks too on the </p>
<p>other side … </p>
<p>“There is also the risk that if we delay too long … we will inadvertently be sending a </p>
<p>wrong and damaging signal on Basra in particular – suggesting that Op SINBAD has </p>
<p>not worked, or that we are not making progress against our plans, when in fact we </p>
<p>are. Moreover there is a risk that we will appear indecisive at the very time that we </p>
<p>are starting to face questions about announcements on troop levels and equipment </p>
<p>in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>“These factors explain why I strongly believe we should make our final decisions and </p>
<p>announce them, as soon as possible …”</p>
<p><b>475. </b> On 24 January, Maj Gen Shaw reported:</p>
<p>“On the re&#8209;posturing plans, whilst Corps is supportive, Casey has tasked Corps to </p>
<p>conduct a security review of Basra with the aim of retaining a military operating base </p>
<p>in Basra after the US and UK civil delegations have left. I mention this to illustrate </p>
<p>the extent to which Casey is not comfortable with our re&#8209;posturing plans … </p>
<p>“Pressure for anti&#8209;Iranian activity would seem to be mounting. I am steering activity </p>

<p>third order consequences from blanket anti&#8209;Iranianism … I am not confident in our </p>
<p>ability to avoid miscalculation …”</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>476. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that they had picked up significant </p>
<p>concerns within the US system that lawlessness was rife in Basra and that the UK </p>
<p>military were doing little to confront it.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p> The US was particularly concerned about </p>
<p>the need to counter Iranian influence and militia control and feared that an early </p>
<p>UK drawdown would leave a security vacuum. </p>
<p><b>477. </b> After reading the Embassy’s account, Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“Either this is correct in which case we have a real problem, or it isn’t in which case </p>
<p>we must correct it. But what is going on in Basra?”</p>
<p>257</p>
<p><b>478. </b> On 24 January, Sir Nigel Sheinwald discussed the UK’s plans with Mr Hadley.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He explained that UK Ministers were about to make important decisions on Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan in the light of the results of Op SINBAD. </p>
<p><b>479. </b> The expectation was that it should be possible for the UK military to withdraw </p>
<p>from central Basra and to draw down from 7,000 to 4,500 troops. Sir Nigel “made clear </p>
<p>that this would be conditions&#8209;based” but added that “if we were not able to reduce our </p>
<p>strength in Basra, we would not be able to increase in Afghanistan”. </p>
<p><b>480. </b> When Mr Hadley did not raise US objections, Sir Nigel concluded:</p>
<p>“… the White House is not opposed to our plans, and that the concerns within the </p>
<p>US system either have not reached the White House or do not seem sufficiently </p>
<p>significant to the White House to warrant their raising a flag”.</p>
<p><b>481. </b> On 25 January, Ambassador Khalilzad gave an interview to the BBC.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> He praised </p>
<p>the British as “great allies” but made clear that the US preference was “the longer we </p>
<p>stay together here, the better”.</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Browne provided Cabinet with an update on military operations in southern Iraq </p>
<p>on 25 January.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>483. </b> Although the media were reporting disagreements between the UK and US about </p>
<p>what the UK’s force posture should be in MND(SE), that was not the reality; discussions </p>
<p>with both the US and Iraqi governments were continuing. The UK was currently </p>
<p>conducting an assessment of the impact of Op SINBAD, after which the UK would take </p>
<p>a decision on what needed to be done in the future.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> On security in Basra, Mr Browne stated:</p>
<p>“… the murder rate had reduced from over 100 to less than 30 a month, which </p>
<p>compared favourably with a number of European States and American cities. The </p>
<p>kidnap rate had been halved and polling suggested levels of confidence in security </p>
<p>which would be welcome in the UK; 90 percent of those polled felt more secure than </p>
<p>a year ago; only 2 percent had encountered intimidation in the last six months.”</p>
<p><b>485. </b> The restoration of marshland by the military, DFID and the Iraqi Government had </p>
<p>been described as “the most significant and successful restoration of the environment </p>
<p>and lifestyle in the history of the world”. </p>
<p><b>486. </b> On 25 January, Mr Asquith reported a series of discussions he and Lt Gen Lamb </p>
<p>had held with Gen Casey and Lieutenant General Raymond Odierno, Commander </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Corps – Iraq, over the preceding 48 hours about transition plans for </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> He reported that they thought:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As Iraq’s second city, Basra had a key role to play in the country’s regeneration. </p>
<p>It could not afford to become (pre&#8209; or post&#8209;PIC) “another al&#8209;Amara” in which </p>
<p>Western contractors could not operate, thereby making redevelopment </p>
<p>impossible. The situation post&#8209;PIC needed to parallel that of Dhi Qar or Najaf, </p>
<p>where the PRT could operate effectively with reasonable security protection.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In addition to reconstruction work, there would still be a need for police training </p>
<p>post&#8209;PIC. Gen Casey had recently observed problems in al&#8209;Amara, where the </p>
<p>MNF were unable to visit police stations in the centre of town, requiring the IPS </p>
<p>to visit MNF on the city perimeter. He ascribed this to the UK’s re&#8209;posturing in </p>
<p>September 2006 which meant the withdrawal from all bases in the city.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A key benchmark for PIC was that the threat from armed groups should be low </p>
<p>and expected to remain so following PIC. The US view was that neither Maysan </p>
<p>nor Basra had yet passed that test.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although both Generals had received several briefings on the UK plans as they </p>
<p>evolved, neither had yet seen a fully worked through set of options. That was </p>
<p>clearly essential. </p>
<p><b>487. </b> Mr Asquith commented that it would be necessary for UK plans to demonstrate that </p>
<p>it would be possible for MNF to move around the city (including post&#8209;PIC) along the lines </p>
<p>of Dhi Qar. It would also be important for the plans credibly to demonstrate that the UK </p>

<p>91</p>
<p>could provide not only combat MiTTs (Military Transition Teams – see Section 12.1) but </p>
<p>also combat force to restore order if security conditions deteriorated. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Asquith reported a deeply entrenched US view that the UK would:</p>
<p>“… continue to make the facts fit our timelines, a view reinforced by our argument </p>
<p>that ‘Basra is different from Baghdad’”.</p>
<p><b>489. </b> In conclusion, Mr Asquith considered:</p>
<p>“How best to respond? This military view in theatre does not take into account </p>
<p>the Afghanistan dimension. We need to remind them of that … There is some </p>
<p>resonance to the argument that there is more risk associated in being cautious, </p>
<p>thereby delaying transition, losing Iraqi consent and prompting the Iraqis to ask the </p>
<p>MNF to leave so that they can finish the business in their own (sectarian) manner. </p>
<p>But this will not carry the day with theatre commanders. We will need to reiterate </p>
<p>clearly the expectations in the UK of delivering on our planned draw down timetable </p>
<p>and the political damage if the US were to deploy forces to Basra in the transition </p>
<p>process … The degree to which anti&#8209;JAM/Iran operations in the South ramp up over </p>
<p>this period will also affect US views. Most importantly … the MND(SE) plan must </p>
<p>credibly address the combat MiTT/combat force capability. I leave to the military </p>
<p>planners to decide whether that requires a reduction in the numbers we currently </p>
<p>plan to draw down.”</p>
<p><b>490. </b> The Iraq Strategy Group met on 25 January, with Sir Nigel Sheinwald as Chair.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported to those present that:</p>
<p>“Ministers required a document which would settle our own minds, and provide a </p>
<p>narrative to persuade the US, and Iraqis, and provide a basis for the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>parliamentary statement in the week beginning 5 February.”</p>
<p><b>491. </b> Sir Nigel asked for the paper to be clear about the tasks that would need to be </p>
<p>undertaken post re&#8209;posturing “to underpin the case”. The Group observed that there was </p>
<p>still a question mark over the future of Basra Palace: </p>
<p>“The US were opposed to giving up the option to use Basra Palace, and wanted </p>
<p>to retain a US flag over it at least until PIC. Simon McDonald said there were </p>
<p>insufficient funds for keeping a Consulate in central Basra. For commercial, political </p>
<p>and symbolic reasons, [Sir Nigel Sheinwald] expected we would want a Consulate in </p>
<p>central Basra if the security conditions improved.” </p>
<p><b>492. </b> In the light of the problems he had observed during his visit, Mr McDonald told the </p>
<p>Group that he thought the UK’s plans were too ambitious.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>493. </b> On 26 January, after reading the weekly updates on Iraq, Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“We need to get a serious plan for Basra with JAM and Iranians targeted effectively. </p>
<p>We can’t leave the city to them. Central to our plan to draw down is a continuing </p>
<p>effective anti&#8209;JAM push.”</p>
<p>263</p>
<p><b>494. </b> On 26 January, a view was provided to Mr McDonald (with copies sent to various </p>
<p>departments including No. 10) about the situation on the ground in Basra and the </p>
<p>military’s approach.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“By nearly every measure, security in Basra has deteriorated in the past year … </p>
<p>Only a decline in sectarian murders in mid&#8209;2006 was a heartening indicator, </p>
<p>illustrating the gulf between the sectarian position in relatively homogeneous </p>
<p>Basra and the much worse situation in mixed Baghdad. Most Basrawis live in fear, </p>
<p>including the civic leaders to whom we would look for the rebirth of economic, social </p>
<p>and political activity in the city. All are subject to intimidation by Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi </p>
<p>(JAM) and to a lesser extent, other militias … They do not feel that they can look </p>
<p>to the CF [coalition forces], Iraqi Police (IPS) or Army (IA) for protection … [F]or all </p>
<p>the time, money and effort poured into the Basra IPS, they are undermining, not </p>
<p>guaranteeing security …</p>
<p>“Over the last year MND(SE) have pursued a strategy of intelligence&#8209;led strikes </p>
<p>on militia members and their subsequent detention. This has had an effect … </p>
<p>Op SINBAD was predicated on the Iraq Government playing its part, both in clearing </p>
<p>out the IPS and in using its available wealth to provide economic alternatives for the </p>
<p>poor unemployed Shia who form JAM’s main recruiting pool.”</p>
<p><b>495. </b> The author continued:</p>
<p>“The main security threat to MND(SE) during the past year has continued to be </p>
<p>JAM. That threat has evolved … MND(SE) arrests have prompted the formation </p>
<p>of more secretive groupings, with a more professional mindset and approach. </p>
<p>A number of these receive support from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard </p>
<p>Corps – Quds Force (IRGC&#8209;QF) … JAM’s local ambition is not only to drive UK </p>
<p>forces out of Iraq but to derive the kudos of being seen to do this, in order to </p>
<p>consolidate and legitimise their aspiration to run the districts and slums of the city, </p>
<p>dominate local politics and infrastructure and assert a grip on some of Iraq’s most </p>
<p>strategic economic assets, savaging any who challenge their hegemony. Now </p>
<p>it is UK forces in the sights of these JAM elements … Once UK forces have left </p>
<p>Southern Iraq, and much will then depend on developments at a national level, </p>
<p>JAM’s targets may become SCIRI and Badr elements (the MNF presence is key to </p>

<p>a culture of criminality, intimidation and violence in Basra, which it would take years </p>
<p>of sustained action by an effective central government in Baghdad to uproot …”</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent his copy of the minute to Mr Blair and Mr Powell. Mr Blair </p>
<p>commented: “This is plainly utterly inconsistent with the CDS and Des [Browne] view. </p>
<p>So who is right?” </p>
<p><b>497. </b> In his weekly report on 28 January, Lt Gen Lamb commented that he was </p>
<p>optimistic of progress, in particular on non&#8209;security operations (for example, industrial </p>
<p>regeneration).</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> He wrote: </p>
<p>“… after four months in theatre I have found myself asking the simple but </p>
<p>nevertheless difficult question of just who is the enemy?” </p>
<p><b>498. </b> Lt Gen Lamb suggested dividing MNF’s opponents into three categories:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those who genuinely wanted to see an end to violence (“more plentiful than one </p>
<p>would expect”).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “architects of violence who would only wish to bring chaos to the country” </p>
<p>found in organisations such as AQ&#8209;I, Ba’athist revival groups and foreign </p>
<p>interventionists such as the Iranian Quds Force and its surrogates. These were, </p>
<p>in his view, “not reconcilable” and needed to be “clearly identified and singularly </p>
<p>prevented from interfering in the process”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those who benefited from a degree of chaos in the country, whom Lt Gen Lamb </p>
<p>considered were potentially “for turning – but may not have any reason to as </p>
<p>yet”. Within this category were a very mixed set of groupings, including criminals </p>
<p>exploiting the black market, the so&#8209;called “honourable resistance” Sunni </p>
<p>insurgent groups (such as Jaysh al&#8209;Mujahidin, Ansar al&#8209;Sunnah, Al&#8209;Jaysh  </p>
<p>al&#8209;Islami and the 1920 Revolutionary Brigade) and Shia militia (such as </p>
<p>moderate JAM), all of whom had expressed willingness to seek peaceful </p>
<p>resolution. Lt Gen Lamb reported that the MNF were: “focusing hard on these </p>
<p>groups in the engagement process to convince them that more is to be gained </p>
<p>from a peaceful accord. This is where risk needs to be taken and from bold </p>
<p>steps can progress be made.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>in Basra, and concerns about the impact of the UK’s proposed re&#8209;posturing and </p>
<p>drawdown.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> Mr Blair judged that the UK’s plans for re&#8209;posturing would have to include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a greater focus on embedding and continued support for police and security </p>
<p>force reform, including the provision of equipment (see Section 12.1);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued operations targeting the JAM leadership, including after re&#8209;posturing; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further action with Iraqis to ensure that criminal cases were pursued against </p>
<p>JAM and other criminal elements in the Basra police.</p>
<p><b>500. </b> On 31 January, Maj Gen Shaw reported:</p>
<p>“Gen Casey is clear that PIC for Basra (and elsewhere) is moving to the right and </p>
<p>there are no signs that Gen Petraeus will be any more forward leaning … The Iraqis, </p>
<p>of course, have a strong say in this, but there are signs that PM Maliki may too wish </p>
<p>to push things further to the right … </p>
<p>“Questions have been asked about the relevance of delayed PIC to our plans for </p>
<p>a re&#8209;postured force at [Basra Air Station] … </p>
<p>“All this led me to judge that … keeping Basra Palace open beyond our original </p>
<p>timelines may need to be considered … </p>
<p>“Maintaining a foothold in the city until PIC will allow us to retain our (already </p>
<p>limited) … situation awareness coverage of the city. The Shia political appetite … for </p>
<p>our counter&#8209;militia strikes allows us a political freedom of operation to exploit this … </p>
<p>by targeted strike operations, both counter IDF/JAM and (an emerging imperative) </p>
<p>counter&#8209;malign Iranian influence. This shift in political attitudes is significant, and is </p>
<p>a major shift since Operation SALAMANCA was proposed and tellingly rejected.”</p>
<p>267</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Maj Gen Shaw continued that he considered:</p>
<p>“… the UK and US are viewing Iraq through the optics of different timelines. There </p>
<p>is no coalition consensus about what is ‘Iraqi good enough’ and a frank political </p>
<p>conversation is needed to determine what the shared vision is.”</p>
<p><b>502. </b> At the end of January 2007, the US National Intelligence Council published its </p>
<p>assessment of what was necessary to stabilise the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> It said: </p>
<p>“Iraqi society’s growing polarization, the persistent weakness of the security forces </p>
<p>and the state in general, and all sides’ ready recourse to violence are collectively </p>
<p>driving an increase in communal and insurgent violence and political extremism. </p>

<p>95</p>
<p>Unless efforts to reverse these conditions show measurable progress during … the </p>
<p>coming 12 to 18 months, we assess that the overall security situation will continue </p>
<p>to deteriorate at rates comparable to the latter part of 2006.”</p>
<p><b>503. </b> The assessment pointed to a number of factors that were driving the violence:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Shia insecurity about loosening their hold on power, born of “decades of </p>
<p>subordination to Sunni … domination”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>many Sunni Arabs being “unwilling to accept their minority status” and being </p>
<p>“convinced that Shia dominance will increase Iranian influence over Iraq, in ways </p>
<p>that erode the State’s Arab character”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “absence of unifying leaders among the Arab Sunni or Shia with the capacity </p>
<p>to speak for or exert control over their confessional groups”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the fact that the Kurds, while willing to participate in Iraqi state&#8209;building, were </p>
<p>reluctant to surrender any of their autonomy and seeking to increase their </p>
<p>control of Kirkuk;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ISF’s inability to operate independently against the Shia militias with any </p>
<p>success, and the sectarian divisions within many units;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the presence of extremists – in particular AQ&#8209;I, whose members acted as a </p>
<p>“very effective accelerators for what has become a self&#8209;sustaining inter&#8209;sectarian </p>
<p>struggle between Shia and Sunnis”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>significant population displacement – the UN estimated by this stage that there </p>
<p>were over a million Iraqis in Syria and Jordan. </p>
<p><b>504. </b> Although the US intelligence community did not consider that the term “civil war” </p>
<p>adequately captured the complexity of the conflict in Iraq, it considered that that phrase </p>
<p>was an accurate description of key elements of the violence. It judged:</p>
<p>“<b>Coalition capabilities, including force levels, resources and operations, </b></p>
<p><b>remain an essential stabilizing element in Iraq</b>. If coalition forces were withdrawn </p>
<p>rapidly during … [the next 12&#8209;18 months] we judge that this almost certainly would </p>
<p>lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict in Iraq, </p>
<p>intensify Sunni resistance to the Iraqi Government, and have adverse consequences </p>
<p>for national reconciliation.</p>
<p>“If such a rapid withdrawal were to take place, we judge that the ISF would be </p>
<p>unlikely to survive as a non&#8209;sectarian national institution; neighbouring countries – </p>
<p>invited by Iraqi factions or unilaterally – might intervene openly in the conflict; </p>
<p>massive civilian casualties and forced population displacement would be probable; </p>
<p>AQ&#8209;I would attempt to use parts of the country – particularly al&#8209;Anbar province – to </p>
<p>plan increased attacks in and outside of Iraq; and spiralling violence and political </p>
<p>disarray in Iraq, along with Kurdish moves to control Kirkuk and strengthen </p>
<p>autonomy, could prompt Turkey to launch a military incursion.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Shortly after publication, Secretary Gates was asked at a news briefing whether </p>
<p>he accepted that there was a civil war in Iraq.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> He replied:</p>
<p>“… I believe that there are essentially four wars going on in Iraq. </p>
<p>“One is Shia on Shia, principally in the South; the second is sectarian conflict, </p>
<p>principally in Baghdad, but not solely; third is the insurgency; and fourth is Al Qaida, </p>
<p>and Al Qaida is attacking, at times, all of those targets.”</p>
<p><b>506. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq from 28 to 31 January.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> In a report of the visit, an Assistant </p>
<p>Private Secretary described continued differences between UK plans and US views on </p>
<p>MND(SE) in a note to MOD Ministers and officials:</p>
<p>“A new US team is in no mood to take risks and re&#8209;evaluates across the board, </p>
<p>expressing concerns in the South over 10 Div, Iranian influence and UK ability </p>
<p>to apply its military muscle in Basra City after re&#8209;posturing. In response the new </p>
<p>MND(SE) command team begin to look at re&#8209;posturing within US tolerances, </p>
<p>which might lead to an extended presence in Basra Palace and less of a dividend </p>
<p>at roulement. </p>
<p>“But the broad strategy can and should survive. Both re&#8209;posturing and some </p>
<p>drawdown should proceed. Above all there is a need to see the wider context – </p>
<p>US politics is driving the numbers up just as we feel ours can come down. Basra </p>
<p>is still not Baghdad. Nevertheless the resulting tension is manifesting itself in the </p>
<p>recently expressed operational concerns of US commanders. MiTTs and PTTs </p>
<p>[Military Transition Teams and Police Transition Teams] are a key element in the </p>
<p>US argument. The criteria for transition have always had a measure of interpretation </p>
<p>in them, and the US are rapidly re&#8209;interpreting to fit the context in which they have </p>
<p>to operate.”</p>
<p><b>507. </b> Concluding his report, the Assistant Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“For this visit the net effect was, at first sight, an alarming and unforeseen change in </p>
<p>military advice over re&#8209;posturing, which has implications beyond Iraq. It suggested </p>
<p>that we had either failed to foresee the scale of this US change of approach and its </p>
<p>implications, or that perhaps our previous plan was lacking in some areas. There are </p>
<p>bound to be a host of nuances that soften this rather stark conclusion but they were </p>
<p>drowned out by the ‘shock of the new’.”</p>
<p><b>508. </b> The Assistant Private Secretary recorded that Lt Gen Lamb had “confirmed a clear </p>
<p>and widespread apprehension at the highest levels of the US military about our plans </p>
<p>for Basra”. </p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Reporting a meeting with Ambassador Khalilzad, the Assistant Private Secretary </p>
<p>recorded that Mr Browne had observed:</p>
<p>“US demands on us were somewhat conflicting, with an emerging expectation </p>
<p>that we would increase our presence in Afghanistan against a much more clearly </p>
<p>expressed desire for us not to reduce our presence in Iraq. The UK’s Armed Forces </p>
<p>could simply not do both.” </p>
<p><b>510. </b> Mr Browne had also: </p>
<p>“… stressed that any suggestion that UK forces would be augmented or replaced by </p>
<p>US forces coming to work in the South was distinctly unhelpful. We could resolve the </p>
<p>issues that faced us without indulging in that kind of language which was likely only </p>
<p>to deepen any public perception of disagreement.”</p>
<p><b>511. </b> In a report to the FCO of Mr Browne’s visit, Mr Asquith recorded a similar exchange </p>
<p>with General Martin Dempsey, Commanding General Multi&#8209;National Security Transition </p>
<p>Command – Iraq, and Lt Gen Odierno, who pointed out that “it was awkward if we </p>
<p>‘unsurged’ while the US surged” and said bluntly that what the US “did not want was </p>
<p>our claiming success against the facts on the ground in order to justify the withdrawal </p>
<p>of troops”.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Browne “laid out the implications of our requirement to deploy in Iraq </p>
<p>and Afghanistan”. </p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Asquith also reported a meeting between Mr Browne and Prime Minister Maliki, </p>
<p>who emphasised that his Government was focused on the Baghdad Security Plan </p>
<p>and whether it would have an impact elsewhere in the country. If it did, “a precipitate </p>
<p>withdrawal should be avoided to prevent a repetition of past problems”. </p>
<p><b>514. </b> During the Basra portion of the visit, Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary </p>
<p>reported that Maj Gen Shaw said that the delay in the expected timing of transition to </p>
<p>PIC meant there was a much greater risk that the UK would still have a defined security </p>
<p>responsibility for Basra city after having re&#8209;postured completely outside the city, leaving </p>
<p>his forces unable to fulfil that responsibility properly.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>515. </b> In Maj Gen Shaw’s view, it would be necessary to maintain “a foot on the ground” </p>
<p>in Basra city in order to maintain the ability to strike and so that the intelligence required </p>
<p>for operations could be collected. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> In his meeting with senior civilian staff in Basra, Mr Browne was told that several of </p>
<p>them considered that the security situation was generally worse for the ordinary Basrawi </p>
<p>than six months ago, primarily because of rising intimidation. Intimidation was also the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>main factor behind the decline in the local police effectiveness over a similar period – </p>
<p>more so than any lack of training or capability.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary commented that these views seemed </p>
<p>in contradiction to the messages that had previously been received on the success </p>
<p>of Op SINBAD. There was “a lack of firm indicators to substantiate or refute” the </p>
<p>different conclusions.</p>
<p><b>518. </b> In her weekly report Dr Marsden said she had advised Mr Browne: </p>
<p>“… that the political significance of Basra Palace should also be factored into military </p>
<p>planning. As the location of the British Consulate and the US Embassy Office, </p>
<p>Basra Palace was seen as the symbol of our continuing commitment to stabilising </p>
<p>Basra. Withdrawing from purely military bases … could credibly be presented </p>
<p>as something we were doing at the request of the Government of Iraq and at a </p>
<p>time of their and our choosing. The optics of leaving Basra Palace were different. </p>
<p>However we dressed it up, we risked handing a propaganda victory to JAM and their </p>
<p>Iranian backers.”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>519. </b> On 31 January, Mr Blair met Lt Gen Houghton and senior officials from the FCO </p>
<p>and SIS.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> In his briefing note for the discussion Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“Initial reports suggest that Des is not making much headway with the American </p>
<p>military in Iraq, partly because they (and, frankly, we) have never seen a worked up </p>
<p>plan as to what our troops would be doing post&#8209;re&#8209;posturing, and how they would </p>
<p>ensure e.g. mentoring, situational awareness, ability to re&#8209;intervene. We have been </p>
<p>asking MOD for detail on this for some time.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>520. </b> In their meeting, Mr Blair stressed to Lt Gen Houghton that it would be necessary </p>
<p>to get “absolute clarity on the position in Basra before taking a firm decision on, and </p>
<p>announcing, a redeployment”.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>521. </b> Lt Gen Houghton commented that it would be important to explain to the US that </p>
<p>the UK was not proposing to abandon bases in Basra, rather they would transfer to Iraqi </p>
<p>control, with UK training teams embedded within them. The approach to mentoring in </p>
<p>Basra was different from that being developed by the US for other areas of Iraq, in part </p>
<p>because the context was different.</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Mr Blair remained concerned about Iraqi ability to ensure security after re&#8209;posturing </p>
<p>and then PIC. He asked whether the UK’s plans would ensure that militias could not </p>
<p>act with impunity. Lt Gen Houghton noted that the UK would retain a re&#8209;intervention </p>
<p>capability, but accepted that there was risk involved. </p>

<p><b>523. </b> Mr McDonald and C both noted the: </p>
<p>“… credible reports of widespread intimidation of the Basrawi population, the </p>
<p>presence of several militias and the evident deficiencies of the Iraqi police. Together, </p>
<p>these suggested that there would continue to be violence following re&#8209;posturing, but </p>
<p>that this would be intra&#8209;Shia, and focused on gaining political dominance.”</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair concluded that it would be:</p>
<p>“… premature to make an announcement on redeployment before we had a clear </p>
<p>plan that answered the key points raised in discussion, and which had secured US </p>
<p>and Iraqi agreement. We should nonetheless continue to plan on the basis that we </p>
<p>would redeploy, in order to ensure that a prudent redeployment was not delayed.”</p>

<p><b>525. </b> On 1 February, Sir David Manning reported that Secretary Rice had asked him </p>
<p>“to tell her honestly whether the UK was now making for the exit as fast as possible”.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David had replied that that was not the case, “explained the arguments for the </p>
<p>change in force posture in Basra; and stressed that this should not be confused with </p>
<p>transition to PIC”. </p>
<p><b>526. </b> Sir David had continued:</p>
<p>“… as the Prime Minister and Secretary of State has said repeatedly, we wanted </p>
<p>to move to PIC in Basra but only when conditions were right. We believed that </p>
<p>time was coming: but we would not hand over prematurely; and we would not do </p>
<p>so without full consultation with US Commanders on the ground.”</p>

<p>meeting of DOP on 1 February.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> The paper invited Ministers to consider and endorse </p>
<p>a series of assessments and proposals in preparation for a statement by Mr Blair on </p>
<p>7 February, including:</p>
<p>“i. continuing our fundamental strategy of building Iraqi capacity and progressively </p>
<p>transferring responsibility for security to the Iraqi authorities; </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“iv. the rationale for the co&#8209;location of military and civilian staff at the Basra Air </p>
<p>Station, the impact this will have on operations, and the need for further work on </p>
<p>a proposal for the future of the Basra Palace Compound;</p>

<p>“vi. the success of our plans will depend greatly on the ability of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to deliver the necessary political conditions. Other risks and challenges </p>
<p>to our plans include our ability to tackle police corruption, continuing Iranian </p>
<p>influence and militia activity, and the willingness and ability of Iraqi Army 10 Division </p>
<p>to provide security.”</p>
<p><b>528. </b> The paper stated:</p>
<p>“Transition – in particular security transition – is fundamental to the coalition’s </p>
<p>strategy in Iraq … </p>
<p>“Assuming – and being seen to assume – full control of Iraq’s security institutions </p>
<p>has also been among the Iraqi Government’s highest priorities.”</p>
<p><b>529. </b> The paper explained that it had been recognised in summer 2006 that significant </p>
<p>work was needed to achieve the conditions for transfer to PIC in Basra. The result </p>
<p>was the ‘Better Basra’ plan, delivered through Op SINBAD and the work of the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office and PRT in Basra. This intensified effort was “yielding results, though it </p>
<p>will need to be maintained in the period up to and following PIC”. The paper suggested </p>
<p>that although “we should avoid setting unrealistic and rigid benchmarks for PIC” a </p>
<p>“pragmatic minimum” needed to be agreed that was credible to the UK and US. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> The paper then contained an assessment of each of the conditions for transition </p>
<p>to PIC in Basra. </p>
<p><b>531. </b> On the threat level, the paper stated that reported levels of violence in southern </p>
<p>Iraq were “relatively low”, although much of the data was “incomplete or conflicting”. </p>
<p>For example, although the reported murder rate had dropped from 100 per month to </p>
<p>30 per month, many murders were not reported. </p>
<p><b>532. </b> Officials urged caution about relying on polling data that suggested public </p>
<p>perceptions were more positive in Basra than elsewhere in Iraq, and recorded that </p>
<p>“some other sources of information paint a different picture, of a deteriorating security </p>
<p>situation, an increase in indirect fire attacks, continuing militia activity and intimidation … </p>
<p>and a pervasive culture of fear among Basrawis”. </p>
<p><b>533. </b> On the strength of the ISF, the paper recorded an improvement in basic police </p>
<p>capability, with 70 percent of police stations at the level required for PIC. However, trust </p>
<p>in the IPS remained low and “some assessments indicate that the IPS continue to do </p>
<p>more to undermine than guarantee security”. Militia infiltration of the police remained the </p>
<p>key barrier to tackling militia activity effectively. </p>
<p><b>534. </b> The paper stated that the Iraqi Army had also demonstrated “an improved ability to </p>
<p>respond to security threats”, but had also been shown to be unreliable. The main issue </p>
<p>was the quality of leadership. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>535. </b> The paper listed a number of “key activities” to address the action needed </p>
<p>before PIC, including opening an Iraqi Army Leadership Academy and training </p>
<p>centre, increasing the number of sub&#8209;units available for army training and mentoring, </p>
<p>establishing a Leadership Academy for the police, supporting prosecutions for police </p>
<p>corruption and increasing police advisory capacity. </p>
<p><b>536. </b> On the ability of MND(SE) to re&#8209;intervene if necessary, the paper stated:</p>
<p>“In Basra the effect of closing the bases in the city will be to reduce our tactical and </p>
<p>situational awareness, making any re&#8209;intervention high risk.”</p>
<p><b>537. </b> A short note attached as Annex C to the main paper recorded that it would be </p>
<p>“impossible to mitigate fully” the “serious implications” on situational awareness of </p>
<p>leaving bases within Basra city. The annex said that those risks were “containable” </p>
<p>post&#8209;PIC, and that mitigation measures were being “actively and aggressively </p>
<p>considered”. </p>
<p><b>538. </b> The paper stated that “we should consider retaining a military presence [in Basra </p>
<p>Palace] at least until PIC”. If the Basra Palace base was to be retained for longer </p>
<p>than planned, “a further UK battlegroup would be required”. The paper included a </p>
<p>recommendation that public statements about the future of Basra Palace should be </p>
<p>avoided, pending a separate proposal on its future. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> The paper recorded that there were US concerns about the UK’s plans:</p>
<p>“… General Casey remains cautious about the timing of PIC in Basra and Maysan. </p>
<p>He has expressed serious concerns about our re&#8209;posturing plans, and there </p>
<p>are indications that General Petraeus may be more, not less cautious. Defence </p>
<p>Secretary Gates has also raised questions.”</p>
<p><b>540. </b> US interlocutors were reported to be concerned that the UK’s plans signalled a </p>
<p>reduced commitment to the South, and that they could threaten the integrity of coalition </p>
<p>and MNF&#8209;I supply lines. The paper stated:</p>
<p>“It is important that we are clear about what we are proposing. We are <b>not</b> </p>
<p>suggesting that <b>PIC</b> must happen in Maysan and Basra on any fixed timetable. </p>
<p>We accept that the case for moving to PIC in Basra in particular will be finely </p>
<p>balanced. Our current assessment is that we have made sufficient progress to be </p>
<p>confident that MND(SE) will be able to recommend that Basra can be transferred </p>
<p>to PIC by the end of … June. But the final decision will rest with MCNS [Ministerial </p>
<p>Committee on National Security] and Maliki, and some of the key actions needed to </p>
<p>get to PIC will require Iraqi decisions. Past experience suggests slippage may well </p>
<p>occur before formal decisions get taken – indeed it has already done so for Maysan. </p>
<p>“What we are saying is that, in the light of progress thus far, and in anticipation </p>
<p>of PIC, it makes sense now to set out a programme of change that will have </p>

<p><b>541. </b> DOP met on 1 February, chaired by Mr Blair.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>542. </b> Mr Browne reported on his recent visit to Iraq. In Basra he had “seen first hand the </p>
<p>positive effect that Operation SINBAD had had”; the reported murder rate had reduced </p>
<p>and “sectarian violence had almost stopped”. Continued violence was mainly directed </p>
<p>against coalition forces. Mr Browne summarised that:</p>
<p>“… despite the change in tactics and a more cautious approach to transitioning </p>
<p>to Iraqi control, the US strategic approach remained the same. The UK strategy </p>
<p>was correct, but in order to maintain a capability to target JAM and assuage US </p>
<p>concerns, the military were looking again at retaining a presence in Basra Palace …”</p>
<p><b>543. </b> As a consequence, Mr Browne reported that drawdown to 4,500 troops would take </p>
<p>“a little longer”. </p>
<p><b>544. </b> Summing up, Mr Blair concluded that the overall strategy for re&#8209;posturing and </p>
<p>transition in southern Iraq remained the right one and invited the MOD to draw up a </p>
<p>revised proposal for force levels and timelines, for discussion at a future meeting. That </p>
<p>should take into account the potential need for a continued presence at Basra Palace </p>
<p>and should set out firm proposals for the arrangements for training and mentoring the </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces.</p>
<p><b>545. </b> On 2 February, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary provided him with an update on  </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> He wrote: “The security situation is poor, and worsening” and listed several </p>
<p>major incidents in the preceding week, two of which had caused significant numbers </p>
<p>of civilian casualties. </p>
<p><b>546. </b> More positively, the Private Secretary reported signs that the recent campaign </p>
<p>against extremist JAM leaders was bearing fruit: several were reportedly fleeing and </p>
<p>Sadr city had become “considerably more permissive” than before. </p>
<p><b>547. </b> Mr Blair queried how these two statements could both be true – that progress </p>
<p>was being made against JAM yet the security situation was worsening.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> He also </p>
<p>noted that there remained a “big dislocation between [the intelligence] estimate and </p>

<p><b>548. </b> On 5 February, Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> Mr Blair </p>
<p>noted positive signs in relation to the Baghdad Security Plan, and advised:</p>
<p>“Our experience in Basra demonstrated that a well&#8209;conducted security operation, </p>
<p>with political and reconstruction elements integrated into it, could deliver results in </p>
<p>terms of increased local consent, and political buy&#8209;in.”</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that the UK would maintain a presence at Basra </p>
<p>Palace to ensure that it had the ability and the tactical awareness to re&#8209;intervene, and </p>
<p>would do more on training and mentoring. Once the ISF had progressed to a point </p>
<p>where insurgent groups could see they could not win militarily “they would have to </p>
<p>pursue other options”. </p>
<p><b>550. </b> In a separate conversation, Sir Nigel Sheinwald talked Secretary Rice and </p>
<p>Mr Hadley through “the plans set out by the Defence Secretary after his visit last week, </p>
<p>ie in relation to the Basra Palace site, ISF mentoring and embedding, and continued </p>
<p>action against the JAM”.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> Sir Nigel:</p>
<p>“… made clear that the re&#8209;posturing would go ahead, but the details were being </p>
<p>worked on and were expected to lead to a smaller draw&#8209;down than first planned – </p>
<p>but this could have a knock&#8209;on impact on our plans for <b>Afghanistan</b>.” </p>
<p><b>551. </b> When they met on 6 February Mr Blair reassured Gen Petraeus that the UK would:</p>
<p>“… ensure that we retained good situational awareness, and the ability to </p>
<p>re&#8209;intervene quickly and effectively. This would involve staying in the Basra Palace </p>
<p>site for the time being, and doing more on training and mentoring.”</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>552. </b> On 7 February, the Chiefs of Staff noted that the “assumptions for the strategic </p>
<p>force balancing work remained unchanged and a sound, logical basis was required to </p>
<p>justify any continued presence in Basra Palace”.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>553. </b> From Baghdad, Mr Asquith was reporting conflicting perspectives within the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government on transition in Basra, ranging from insistence that a date must be set for </p>
<p>withdrawal to considering it a low priority.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>554. </b> On 8 February, Mr Asquith reported that the Baghdad Security Plan was about to </p>
<p>enter its critical phase and was “unquestionably the best [plan] so far”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>555. </b> Mr Asquith had been telling his Sunni contacts that they had to engage in the </p>
<p>plan and “not cry foul at the first excuse”. He commented that Prime Minister Maliki’s </p>
<p>grip had strengthened and tightened. For the first time he sensed a small group of </p>
<p>Ministers working to a common end. However, the risk remained high that, after the first </p>
<p>two months of security operations, the underlying political disharmonies and capability </p>
<p>deficiencies in delivering improvements in services and economic reconstruction </p>
<p>would re&#8209;emerge.</p>
<p><b>556. </b> On 8 February, Maj Gen Shaw reported that he had reached a satisfactory </p>
<p>agreement with the head of the Basra Provincial Council.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> A “Comprehensive Plan” </p>
<p>was being developed by the UK military and civilian staff in Basra aimed at achieving </p>
<p>a “unifying approach for all lines of operation” and defining, within the context of what </p>
<p>was likely to be achievable, what “stability” and “success” would look like. </p>
<p><b>557. </b> Maj Gen Shaw wrote:</p>
<p>“Achieving a deal in Basra is the real challenge; it is on this that the FCO political </p>
<p>plan is to focus. Social and political power is weak and dispersed. Tribal influences </p>
<p>are weak: the displaced Marsh Arabs that occupy the banlieu are rootless, </p>
<p>disenfranchised and guns for hire. Political power is divided and unrepresentative … </p>
<p>It is not clear that either social or political power is sufficiently coherently organised </p>
<p>for deals to be made. The only unifying themes would appear to be fear of the abyss </p>
<p>were MNF to leave, fear of malign Iranian influence and greed … The hope is that </p>
<p>a Basrawi majority in favour of a deal will emerge, with our military role being to </p>
<p>neutralise the irreconcilables … Identifying where this split occurs, eg within JAM, </p>
<p>will be key … I have no sense that the precursor talks to any deal have yet begun </p>
<p>between the potential parties; making a prediction as to when such a deal might </p>
<p>be forthcoming and what form it might take becomes another key … requirement. </p>
<p>All of which emphasises the essentially political nature of the end state to which all </p>
<p>on the SISG [Southern Iraq Steering Group] must work, and the importance of the </p>
<p>aforementioned political plan.”</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Dr Marsden reported on 9 February that she considered that the UK’s plans to </p>
<p>re&#8209;posture within Basra were “an opportunity to change the political dynamics in Basra </p>
<p>more in our favour and achieve greater political engagement in the run up to PIC, </p>
<p>thereby reducing the chances of further boycotts”.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>559. </b> Dr Marsden considered that local Basrawi politicians did not believe that the </p>
<p>UK was serious about early transition to PIC and used this “as an excuse not to </p>

<p>take decisive action themselves against militant JAM, IDF teams and malign Iranian </p>
<p>influence”. She judged:</p>
<p>“We don’t have time to change the political soil in Basra or any realistic prospect of </p>
<p>getting rid of JAM. Given that, what will success look like? One possible definition of </p>
<p>our political end state is a more stable Basra in which parties are willing to resolve </p>
<p>confrontations without recourse to serious violence; and in which JAM can be kept </p>
<p>in line by other political forces (as happens in Dhi Qar and Muthanna). Achieving a </p>
<p>political equilibrium in Basra will be much more difficult than in those two provinces </p>
<p>because tribal influences are weaker, the political parties and malign Iranian </p>
<p>influence are stronger and there is a large population of poor and disenfranchised </p>
<p>Marsh Arabs. But our planned re&#8209;posturing away from the city centre and the </p>
<p>associated information operations campaign may provide a more favourable </p>
<p>environment in which a political deal could emerge. </p>
<p>“At the centre of a revamped Better Basra Plan, we therefore need a political plan for </p>
<p>getting Basra to PIC and beyond … This will need to be carefully calibrated with the </p>
<p>Central Government, whose attention currently is very heavily focused on Baghdad. </p>
<p>And it is important to acknowledge that we do not have a sufficiently clear picture of </p>
<p>Basrawi politics and their connection to Baghdadi politics to be confident that any </p>
<p>plan is credible.”</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Dr Marsden set out an outline of elements that might form part of such a plan and </p>
<p>sought approval from the Iraq Senior Officials Group to work up a more detailed plan.</p>
<p><b>561. </b> On 11 February, Lt Gen Lamb reported successful operations by Iraq’s security </p>
<p>forces.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> He commented that the ongoing dialogue with those connected with the Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency “continues to bear fruit” but his interlocutors were not yet ready to give full </p>
<p>levels of trust to the government. The civil bureaucracy remained stretched and was </p>
<p>“arguably untenable in its current form”. </p>
<p><b>562. </b> On 12 February, Mr Asquith met Mr Tariq Abdullah, Prime Minister Maliki’s Chief </p>
<p>of Staff, to talk through the UK’s plans in Basra.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> He explained that the UK intended to:</p>
<p>“… transfer sites in the city to the Iraqi authorities. In parallel, we would be </p>
<p>concentrating most of our staff in the Air Station to maximise the effect of civilian and </p>
<p>military effort designed to create the conditions for PIC.”</p>
<p><b>563. </b> Mr Asquith explained that there would remain a British military presence at Basra </p>
<p>Palace. Mr Abdullah gave an assurance that the Prime Minister and his office were </p>
<p>supportive of what Mr Asquith had outlined. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 12 February </p>
<p>to say that the MOD had picked up indications that the Danish Government was </p>
<p>considering removing their ground forces from Iraq later that year.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> Such a decision </p>
<p>would “present military and political difficulties” for the UK’s re&#8209;posturing plans in </p>
<p>MND(SE), possibly requiring UK forces to replace the withdrawn Danish troops and </p>
<p>“placing further unwelcome pressure on our force generation for Iraq and Afghanistan”. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> Mr Browne had relayed the UK’s concerns to the Danish Defence Minister earlier </p>
<p>that week.</p>
<p><b>566. </b> On 12 February, Mr Dowse passed Sir Nigel Sheinwald a copy of an unclassified </p>
<p>presentation that had been the basis of a media briefing by the US military on Iranian </p>
<p>activity in Iraq.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> Mr Dowse commented:</p>
<p>“The brief’s key judgement that ‘Iran is a significant contributor to attacks on coalition </p>
<p>forces’ matches our own assessment … The US brief also highlights casualties </p>
<p>among Iraqi security forces and civilians from such attacks. This is factually correct, </p>
<p>although we judge the MNF have been the prime target. </p>
<p>“Much of the brief offers evidence in the form of photos of fragments recovered from </p>
<p>explosions, damaged vehicles, seized mortar rounds, man&#8209;portable surface to air </p>
<p>missiles, roadside bombs and bomb components including TNT blocks, telemetry </p>
<p>devices – much of the material exhibiting Farsi markings – and some photographic </p>
<p>examples of similar material of known Iranian origin. We are familiar with this </p>
<p>material and agree that it offers compelling evidence that Iraqi extremists are being </p>
<p>equipped from Iran …”</p>
<p><b>567. </b> Mr Dowse observed that media reporting had highlighted the US briefers’ assertion </p>
<p>that support for Iraqi Shia extremists was a policy approved “at the highest levels” of the </p>
<p>Iranian government, noting that that was consistent with JIC Assessments.</p>
<p><b>568. </b> At DOP on 14 February, Ministers were asked to agree proposals for re&#8209;posturing </p>
<p>and drawdown in Iraq and a request for additional troops for Afghanistan.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>569. </b> A paper produced by the MOD for the discussion said:</p>
<p>“We need to consider our decisions on Iraq and Afghanistan together and take </p>
<p>a view on where limited UK military resource can have most strategic impact </p>
<p>in 2007.”</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>570. </b> The paper stated that the UK could only sustain the enduring operational </p>
<p>deployment of eight battlegroups. The “military judgement” was that commitment of </p>
<p>additional UK resource in Afghanistan was likely to have more military impact than </p>

<p>continuing commitment in Iraq at roughly existing levels and that therefore it would </p>
<p>be desirable to have four battlegroups deployed in Iraq and four in Afghanistan in the </p>
<p>second half of 2007 (compared with the existing six and two respectively). </p>
<p><b>571. </b> The MOD invited DOP to:</p>
<p>“agree that we should continue to reduce towards four battlegroups in MND(SE) but </p>
<p>that in light of the practical challenges of handing over Basra Palace we should be </p>
<p>prepared to maintain a fifth battlegroup there until the end of Aug 07.”</p>
<p><b>572. </b> The case for retaining a fifth battlegroup was twofold: </p>
<p>“… practical constraints on how quickly we can hand over to the Iraqi Army in good </p>
<p>order; and considerations of tactical risk reduction coupled with a need to take </p>
<p>account of US military unease and scepticism about too rapid a run&#8209;down. It also </p>
<p>has to be seen against our overall strategic objective for Iraq … At the centre of US </p>
<p>nervousness is a concern about a loss of situational awareness and a broader worry </p>
<p>that too rapid a withdrawal from Basra might undermine the prospects for stability </p>
<p>in Iraq’s second city. On the other hand, we should be realistic about the impact of </p>
<p>temporarily retaining a single battlegroup in Basra Palace can have on the likelihood </p>
<p>or otherwise of this happening. The actions of the Iraqi political and security </p>
<p>authorities are a far more significant factor in securing Basra’s future.”</p>
<p><b>573. </b> The paper recalled Ministers had agreed in January 2006 that Iraq was the UK’s </p>
<p>top overseas security priority but went on to say: </p>
<p>“… in strictly military terms the most impact (and the best chance of making progress </p>
<p>in Afghanistan) would be achieved by devoting more resources in Afghanistan. The </p>
<p>strategic military advice is that this outweighs the tactical advantages of retaining </p>
<p>Basra Palace.”</p>
<p><b>574. </b> MOD officials explained that other factors should be taken into account – including </p>
<p>the UK/US security relationship, the threat from Iran, and relations within NATO. They </p>
<p>concluded that: </p>
<p>“… the overriding factor is the emerging impracticality of handing over Basra Palace </p>
<p>in May. A delay until the end of Aug 07 looks inevitable, which has the advantage of </p>
<p>allowing us to maintain better situational awareness of Basra City and assuage US </p>
<p>concerns to some extent …”</p>
<p><b>575. </b> The second issue on which DOP was asked to reach a decision was a request for </p>
<p>additional troops for Afghanistan.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>576. </b> The MOD paper explained that:</p>
<p>“… at least since the invasion of Iraq in 2003 we [the Armed Forces] have been </p>
<p>operating in excess of our assumptions, and since last spring we have been </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>undertaking two enduring intensive Medium Scale operations, as well as maintaining </p>
<p>smaller commitments elsewhere.”</p>
<p><b>577. </b> As a consequence, “some capabilities are very stretched, notably deployable </p>
<p>ground troops and enables such as air transport, medical, intelligence and surveillance”. </p>
<p><b>578. </b> The paper went on to state:</p>
<p>“… the military judgement is that we could sustain the deployment of eight </p>
<p>battlegroups between Iraq and Afghanistan (the current split being 6:2) through </p>
<p>2007, but not for much longer, and that it would not be feasible in 2007 to exceed </p>
<p>eight in total. This means that for as long as we retain six, or even five, battlegroups </p>
<p>in Iraq it will not be possible to contribute from UK resources the additional two </p>
<p>battlegroups for ISAF it is CDS’s strong advice we should provide.”</p>
<p><b>579. </b> The paper concluded that, given the scale of commitment in Afghanistan, the only </p>
<p>scope for easing the pressure would be to reduce further in Iraq in 2008, and so the </p>
<p>“continued commitment to Basra Palace should not extend beyond Aug 07”.</p>
<p><b>580. </b> An MOD paper on the possible UK response to revised force requirements for </p>
<p>Afghanistan, also written for DOP, was explicit that “delivery of additional battalions for </p>
<p>Afghanistan and the enabling assets required is dependent on Iraq force levels”.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Departmental briefs for Ministers attending DOP show that views were divided </p>
<p>within Whitehall. The MOD was concerned that the Cabinet Office and Treasury were </p>
<p>trying to postpone decisions on Afghanistan and told Mr Browne that the force packages </p>
<p>proposed by MOD were designed to meet NATO’s specific needs.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>582. </b> The FCO was concerned that US commanders in Iraq were sceptical about the </p>
<p>UK’s assessment of progress in Basra and were concerned about UK plans.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>583. </b> Cabinet Office officials advised Mr Blair that the MOD’s assessment of Op SINBAD </p>
<p>would be:</p>
<p>“… drafted to be as positive as possible. There have been some beneficial short </p>
<p>and medium term effects, such as stabilising the security situation, creating new </p>
<p>employment opportunities, successful regeneration projects and improved capability </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Security Forces. However, the assessment is also likely to identify </p>
<p>a requirement for further work to be done to tackle the criminal elements of the </p>

<p>They have not yet agreed the note with other government departments.”</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>584. </b> At DOP on 14 February, Ministers accepted the recommendation to retain five </p>
<p>battlegroups (around 5,200 troops) in Basra until the end of August 2007, which would </p>
<p>allow the UK to retain a presence at Basra Palace.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> Ministers would review that </p>
<p>presence in the summer in the light of conditions in Basra and any residual US concerns </p>
<p>about the speed of withdrawal. </p>
<p><b>585. </b> DOP agreed that Mr Blair should announce the UK’s decision to re&#8209;posture forces </p>
<p>within MND(SE) to Parliament when it returned from Recess, in the week beginning </p>
<p>26 February.</p>
<p><b>586. </b> In discussion, the point was made that it was not clear whether US concerns would </p>
<p>have reduced sufficiently by the end of August to allow Basra Palace to be handed over </p>
<p>as planned. </p>
<p><b>587. </b> Mr Browne told the Inquiry that he was “not conscious that there were things we </p>
<p>did not or could not do, particularly in Basra or in Iraq, because we had troops deployed </p>
<p>to Afghanistan”.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> He recollected that there was a long term strategy to reduce troop </p>
<p>numbers in Iraq that was “fixed in any event and was not related to the fact that we were </p>
<p>deploying troops into Afghanistan”. At every stage, Mr Browne added that he had taken </p>
<p>and accepted the advice of the military. </p>
<p><b>588. </b> VAdm Style advised the Chiefs of Staff on 14 February of “the very real sense from </p>
<p>US interlocutors, notwithstanding the likely lack of a roll&#8209;over of UNSCR 1723, that there </p>
<p>was a need to plan for an extension of the current US ‘surge’ of forces to Feb 08 …”</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported on 15 February that Gen Petraeus – who was visiting </p>
<p>MND(SE) – was “largely receptive” to the UK’s proposed approach but had:</p>
<p>“… challenged the assumption that this UNSCR [authorising MNF presence in </p>
<p>Iraq] will be the last; he suggested a growing appetite, both US and Iraqi/Maliki, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>590. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary described the planned Parliamentary statement to </p>
<p>Dr Meghan O’Sullivan, Deputy National Security Advisor for Iraq and Afghanistan, on </p>
<p>15 February.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>591. </b> The Private Secretary advised Mr Blair the following day that there were “rumblings </p>
<p>of discontent within the US system about the timing of the statement”, which some in the </p>
<p>US Administration would have preferred the UK to put off until April.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>592. </b> The Private Secretary also told Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“There are signs that US, and Iraqi, attitudes to transition could cause us difficulties. </p>
<p>Neither party shows much enthusiasm for transition in the Spring (or even Summer). </p>
<p>This could well affect our own plans, with the [US] Corps now judging that Maysan </p>
<p>might be ready for transition in May, but that Basra probably won’t be ready in June. </p>
<p>As you heard at DOP, the MOD are very keen that the idea of drawing&#8209;down by a </p>
<p>further battalion at the end of August should be a fixed target. DOP agreed to review </p>
<p>this in the Summer, and it will – as now – be difficult to justify a further draw&#8209;down </p>
<p>(especially out of the city centre) if we retain nominal responsibility for security.”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Lt Gen Lamb sent a report on his work on reconciliation, which MOD forwarded </p>
<p>to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 15 February.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> Knowledge of the negotiations was </p>
<p>limited to a very small number of individuals on both the Iraqi and the MNF&#8209;I sides.</p>
<p><b>594. </b> On Sunni engagement, Lt Gen Lamb reported that there had been MNF&#8209;I effort </p>
<p>since summer 2006 to bring Sunni insurgent groups into a dialogue that might lead to </p>
<p>a cease&#8209;fire with the MNF/ISF. </p>
<p><b>595. </b> Lt Gen Lamb had established substantive negotiations with leadership elements of </p>
<p>Ansar al&#8209;Sunna, Jaysh al&#8209;Islami and Jaysh al&#8209;Mujahadeen. The groups were negotiating </p>
<p>among internal factions the possibility of forming a single organisation, calling a </p>
<p>cease&#8209;fire and working to defeat AQ&#8209;I. Lt Gen Lamb reported that a confidence&#8209;building </p>
<p>test case was under way within Baghdad and Anbar, in which an economic </p>
<p>reconstruction package was provided in return for “local protection in the area”.</p>
<p><b>596. </b> Lt Gen Lamb reported that negotiations with Shia/JAM representatives in Sadr </p>
<p>City were less advanced and were more complicated. JAM was not a homogenous </p>
<p>organisation. The Mayor of Sadr City had begun to engage politically with the MNF </p>
<p>and ISF and the possibility of contact with other Shia/JAM leaders in Baghdad was </p>
<p>being explored. </p>

<p><b>597. </b> Gen Dannatt visited Baghdad and MND(SE) from 14 to 15 February.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> He reported </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw’s views that there was merit in maintaining a MNF presence in Basra </p>
<p>Palace at least until PIC, both to help preserve the UK’s relationship with the US in </p>
<p>theatre and because he believed that a UK military presence in Basra was required </p>
<p>for as long as MND(SE) was responsible for security there. Gen Dannatt commented in </p>
<p>his report:</p>
<p>“The military logic behind maintaining situational awareness in the City is </p>
<p>impeccable, but over time there may be different ways of delivering it at a reduced </p>
<p>scale of MNF military commitment at the Palace … PIC and our withdrawal from BP </p>
<p>[Basra Palace] will be linked, but need not be slavishly.</p>
<p>“… Our decision to reinforce Afghanistan … can only be delivered by the TRB </p>
<p>[Theatre Reserve Battalion] … In simple force generation terms, we can only do this </p>
<p>if [we] get down to four battlegroup HQs … in Iraq. And we are only likely to do this if </p>
<p>we withdraw from BP …</p>
<p>“Finally on BP, I found it rather incoherent to learn that … our own Consulate were </p>
<p>planning to withdraw from the Palace shortly … I found all of this rather indicative to </p>
<p>the whole BP issue: untidy and somewhat incoherent … I sense our decision making </p>
<p>across Whitehall has lacked agility, failing to mesh the different strategic dynamics </p>
<p>and imperatives emerging from Washington, Baghdad, Kabul and Mons [i.e. NATO], </p>
<p>over these past few months, in a timely manner. Meanwhile, soldiers are being </p>
<p>wounded in BP – shortly one may be killed.”</p>
<p><b>598. </b> The Private Secretary to Mr Bill Jeffrey, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, </p>
<p>annotated those comments:</p>
<p>“[Those paragraphs] don’t strike me as very helpful. I don’t recall him making these </p>
<p>points before decisions were made.”</p>
<p>309</p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“I gather CDS [ACM Stirrup] raised this at the COS(I) [Chiefs of Staff Informal </p>
<p>meeting] and CGS [Gen Dannatt] basically said this note had been badly drafted </p>
<p>and he was (of course) totally onside …”</p>
<p>310</p>
<p><b>599. </b> General Dannatt also commented:</p>
<p>“It is the prospect of political accommodation that I found the most encouraging. </p>
<p>‘Reconciliation’ and ‘outreach’ are not exactly new concepts in the Iraq campaign, </p>
<p>but I do sense that the conditions for them are increasingly favourable …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>“Debates about political accommodation inevitably prompted the question of what </p>
<p>strategic success in Iraq might now look like. Or to use the current mantra, what </p>
<p>does ‘Iraq good enough’ actually mean? Given that the US and UK arguably began </p>
<p>this war for different strategic reasons, the imperative to agree some common </p>
<p>ground for the campaign’s endstate becomes yet more pressing. I sense it is the </p>
<p>Iraqis who will determine what ‘good enough’ means for them and it may well be far </p>
<p>short of our previous definitions of strategic success. I believe the time is ripe to  </p>
<p>re&#8209;open the debate with theatre and Washington on this fundamental issue.”</p>

<p><b>600. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary put a draft Parliamentary statement on developments </p>
<p>in Iraq into Mr Blair’s red box for consideration over the weekend of 17 and </p>
<p>18 February.</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>601. </b> In an accompanying note, Mr Jonathan Powell advised Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“This is a major opportunity to change the way people think about the situation in </p>
<p>Iraq and the way forward … you need to give people the sense of an overall <b>plan </b></p>
<p>and a way forward that could lead to success … The key question you have to </p>
<p>answer is whether it is inevitable that Iraq will sink into a vicious civil war that will </p>
<p>only end with the partition of the country and the success of Iran.”</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>602. </b> On 18 February, Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote a minute for Mr Blair describing two </p>
<p>conversations with Mr Hadley over that weekend.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> Sir Nigel explained that President </p>
<p>Bush supported the timing of the UK’s announcement, but had asked that Mr Blair make </p>
<p>clear that “re&#8209;posturing in Basra is the result of success, not an attempt to hedge against </p>
<p>failure” and that substantial numbers would remain, with a continued training role. </p>

<p> Gen Petraeus had ensured work on </p>

<p><b>605. </b> On 19 February, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary sent a record of a phone call between </p>
<p>Mr Blair and Prime Minister Maliki to Mrs Beckett’s Private Office.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“He [Mr Blair] noted that Maliki was aware of our intention to start drawdown in </p>
<p>Basra when conditions allowed. We hoped to start this between now and May </p>
<p>as we judged the Iraqi forces capable of taking the lead. He emphasised that we </p>
<p>would be maintaining a presence at Basra Palace. Maliki wondered if a two month </p>
<p>pause would be possible to ensure that we were fully joined up. The Prime Minister </p>
<p>reiterated that this would be done between now and May.”</p>
<p><b>606. </b> The Private Secretary asked Lt Gen Lamb and Mr Robert Gibson, Deputy Head of </p>
<p>Mission at the British Embassy Baghdad, to call on Prime Minister Maliki the following </p>
<p>day to ensure he was in the picture on plans for the statement. </p>
<p><b>607. </b> They reported back that Prime Minister Maliki had understood from the call that the </p>
<p>UK would withdraw troops from Basra on 21 February.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>608. </b> Mr Gibson and Lt Gen Lamb told Prime Minister Maliki that:</p>
<p>“The UK would stay in Basra throughout 2007 and into 2008 for as long as Maliki … </p>
<p>wished and the conditions warranted it. The Prime Minister’s message and the UK </p>
<p>decision to reduce troop numbers was not directly connected to handing over Basra </p>
<p>to provincial Iraqi security control. The timing of that was a matter for Maliki. Rather </p>
<p>the decision was driven by the requirement to balance British force levels between </p>
<p>Iraq and Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Following their meeting, Lt Gen Lamb and Mr Gibson reported that Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki appeared to be happy with the proposed announcement. </p>
<p><b>610. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 20 February by video conference and told him </p>
<p>that the UK’s re&#8209;posturing would be a little more cautious than some might expect; the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Mr Blair made his statement in the House of Commons on 21 February.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He emphasised that the situation in Basra was:</p>
<p>“… very different from that in Baghdad. There is no Sunni insurgency and no  </p>
<p>al&#8209;Qaida base. There is little Shia on Sunni violence. The bulk of the attacks are </p>
<p>on the Multi&#8209;National Force … </p>
<p>“As a result of the operation in Basra, which is now complete, the Iraq forces now </p>
<p>have the primary role for security in most parts of the city. It is still a difficult and </p>
<p>sometimes dangerous place, but many extremists have been arrested or have left </p>
<p>the city. The reported levels of murder and kidnapping are significantly down … </p>
<p>“What all this means is not that Basra is how we want it to be, but that the next </p>
<p>chapter in Basra’s history can be written by the Iraqis … </p>
<p>“Already we have handed over prime responsibility for security to the Iraqi authorities </p>
<p>in Muthanna and Dhi Qar. Now in Basra over the coming months we will transfer </p>
<p>more of the responsibility directly to Iraqis. I should say that none of this will mean </p>
<p>a diminution in our combat capability. The actual reduction in forces will be from the </p>
<p>present 7,100 … to roughly 5,500. However, with the exception of forces which will </p>
<p>remain at Basra Palace, the British forces will be located at Basra Air Base and be </p>
<p>in a support role … </p>
<p>“The British forces that remain in Iraq will have the following tasks: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training and support to Iraqi forces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>securing the Iraq&#8209;Iran border; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>securing supply routes; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>and, above all, the ability to conduct operations against extremist groups </p>
<p>and be there in support of the Iraqi army when called upon. </p>
<p>“Over time, and depending naturally on progress and the capability of the Iraq </p>
<p>security forces, we will be able to draw down further, possibly to below 5,000 once </p>
<p>the Basra Palace site has been transferred to the Iraqis in late summer. </p>
<p>“We hope that Maysan province can be transferred to full Iraqi control in the next </p>
<p>few months, and Basra in the second half of the year. The UK military presence will </p>
<p>continue into 2008, for as long as we are wanted and have a job to do.”</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Mr Blair also told the House of Commons:</p>
<p>“I have discussed this with Prime Minister Maliki, and our proposals have his full </p>
<p>support and, indeed, represent his wishes.” </p>

<p><b>614. </b> Dr Marsden reported an “extremely positive” reaction to Mr Blair’s statement from </p>
<p>the Governor of Basra, who welcomed it at a press conference on the same day and </p>
<p>praised co&#8209;operation between the MNF and the provincial government.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>615. </b> Dr Marsden also reported that the Chairman of Basra’s Provincial Council had not </p>
<p>made a public statement, but was believed to be under pressure from within the Council </p>
<p>to take a less positive line. </p>
<p><b>616. </b> When they eventually met on 27 February, the Chairman told Dr Marsden “the </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s statement had eased the way to end the boycott”.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>617. </b> In the US, the statement received “extensive coverage”.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p> A report from the British </p>
<p>Embassy Washington characterised the debate as:</p>
<p>“The Administration puts on a brave face and tries to portray UK plans as evidence </p>
<p>of progress. The media see the announcement as a serious setback for Bush’s </p>
<p>surge. The Democrats use British plans as ammunition in their battle to force US </p>
<p>troop withdrawals.” </p>
<p><b>618. </b> The Embassy also observed:</p>
<p>“The disproportionate rejoicing in State Department at PM Howard’s decision … </p>
<p>is a good indicator of the fragility of the mood here.”</p>
<p><b>619. </b> Mr Browne told Cabinet on the morning of 22 February that, although it was early </p>
<p>days, Operation Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon appeared to be working well so far.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> The main </p>
<p>difference between it and previous operations was the presence of US forces living in </p>
<p>the districts of Baghdad, providing a permanent protective presence. </p>
<p><b>620. </b> Mr Browne also briefed Cabinet on the situation in South&#8209;East Iraq, which was </p>
<p>“relatively quiet”. He added that as a result of Op SINBAD the relationship between the </p>
<p>UK troops and the people of Basra had improved. There was a recognition the ISF and </p>
<p>the MNF must take action against militant JAM where a small minority were perpetrating </p>
<p>violent attacks for political and economic gain. The MNF could not deal with that </p>
<p>problem: only the Iraqi people could address the political and economic issues. </p>
<p><b>621. </b> Referring to Mr Blair’s announcement the previous day, Mr Browne said that the </p>
<p>reduction in troop numbers reflected military advice and that the UK’s strategy was </p>
<p>“the same as that of the USA”. </p>
<p><b>622. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said that Gen Petraeus had a clearer idea of </p>
<p>the links between civilian and military activity in addressing Iraq’s problems. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p><b>623. </b> On 22 February, Maj Gen Shaw reported on “a significant week” in which “All the </p>
<p>indicators … would suggest that JAM is losing the initiative in Basra.”</p>
<p>325</p>
<p> As a result, JAM </p>
<p>was threatening to “make Basra burn” if the ISF continued to co&#8209;operate with the MNF, </p>
<p>and there had been increased intimidation of locally employed civilian staff which had </p>
<p>reduced attendance levels. </p>
<p><b>624. </b> Maj Gen Shaw continued:</p>
<p>“It is difficult to determine if this is the tipping point at which the people of Basra </p>
<p>will either decide to stand and fight the influence of militant JAM or will choose to </p>
<p>acquiesce to their control of the street. It is certainly not the moment to take the </p>
<p>pressure off, and points to the need to continue STRIKE operations and this in turn </p>
<p>emphasises the need of the ISTAR [Intelligence, Surveillance, Target Acquisition </p>
<p>and Reconnaissance – see Section 14.1] and specialist … assets that can help us </p>
<p>maximise our effect.”</p>
<p><b>625. </b> On 23 February, Dr Marsden wrote in her weekly report:</p>
<p>“We continue to get reports of JAM members leaving the city for fear of arrest. </p>
<p>And there are signs that some elements of Basra JAM may be willing to talk to us. </p>
<p>This and other indicators would suggest that JAM could be losing the initiative in </p>
<p>Basra. But there are other Iranian&#8209;influenced elements of JAM who continue to hit </p>
<p>us … Reports of intimidation are at a new high. Over the month we have also seen </p>
<p>a spike in execution&#8209;style killings … One Locally Employed Civilian was found dead </p>
<p>with a note attached to his chest stating that this is what happens to collaborators </p>
<p>with MNF … </p>
<p>“We are seeing noticeably less political fallout from our assertiveness than we would </p>
<p>have done last year. There are signs that the political and public mood may be </p>
<p>becoming more hostile to JAM – and more understanding of our attempts to deal </p>
<p>with its most egregious elements.”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>626. </b> Following Dr Marsden’s report, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs </p>

<p>The CIG judged that the insurgents in Anbar had proved resilient and that support for </p>
<p>their insurgency was undiminished:</p>
<p>“Large areas of Anbar are outside effective MNF or Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) </p>
<p>control. In several towns and in rural areas insurgents are able to operate freely. </p>
<p>Where the MNF has an established presence, or patrols frequently, the insurgents’ </p>
<p>ability to exert control is less.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>628. </b> The CIG considered the ability of the Iraqi Government to assert its authority in the </p>
<p>province and judged that:</p>
<p>“Central government’s influence in Anbar is weak. The provincial authorities send </p>
<p>the right signals about economic and security problems, but they have been able </p>
<p>to deliver little. Local administrative capacity is very limited and dogged by tribal </p>

<p>“There is little prospect of improvement in security. In a particularly hostile </p>
<p>environment, the Iraqi Security Forces will require MNF combat support beyond </p>
<p>2007, or risk ceding <i>de facto </i>control of further large areas to the insurgents.”</p>
<p><b>629. </b> The CIG Assessment concluded:</p>
<p>“Prospects for the Anbar tribal groups fighting AQ&#8209;I will depend on their gaining </p>
<p>broader support among the Sunni population. We judge this will prove difficult as </p>
<p>long as rival tribal and insurgent groups compete for local power and influence. </p>
<p>More broadly, most Anbaris have no confidence in local political structures or in </p>
<p>Maliki’s Shia&#8209;dominated government and its efforts at national reconciliation.” </p>
<p><b>630. </b> An official working closely with the military discussed proposals for Shia outreach </p>
<p>briefly with Lt Gen Lamb on 27 February and explained that the “main effort was to </p>
<p>bring a limited number of high quality interlocutors to the table”, including JAM1.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lamb was happy with what was proposed and content for the plan to proceed </p>

<p>Maj Gen Shaw that “if you take one step ahead of the Iraqi Government, the answer is </p>
<p>this is absolutely doomed”.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Iraq from 25 to 27 February, beginning in Basra and then </p>
<p>moving north to Baghdad.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p> A report of the visit written by Lt Col Richmond, his </p>
<p>Military Adviser, said that Gen Petraeus “thought that MNF could establish a secure </p>
<p>environment” and had said that PIC would continue, though “not necessarily to the </p>
<p>previously declared timetable (all provinces by Nov 07)”. Lt Gen Odierno was judged </p>
<p>to be “very on side with what the UK was doing in SE Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>635. </b> Lt Col Richmond observed:</p>
<p>“It was striking how the high threat environment was taking its toll on people. </p>
<p>It was no longer possible to return off patrol to relax and unwind in camp due </p>
<p>to the IDF threat.”</p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Robert Gibson, British Deputy Head of Mission Washington, was reported </p>
<p>to have briefed ACM Stirrup that “whilst Washington was happy with the PM’s </p>
<p>announcement on UK re&#8209;posturing, the US Embassy in Baghdad was not and he </p>
<p>had been given a hard time.”</p>
<p><b>637. </b> In response to concerns raised by Maj Gen Shaw, ACM Stirrup:</p>
<p>“… outlined how the strategic benefits of vacating Basra Palace (BP) outweighed the </p>
<p>tactical benefits of remaining. He had not been willing to agree to remain in BP until </p>
<p>further notice and the date of Aug was driven by the timeline for repositioning all the </p>
<p>capabilities … The situation in the city would never be good enough, therefore there </p>
<p>was risk – but it was better to take risk whilst we had the force elements and before </p>
<p>PIC as we would still be able to intervene when we wished.”</p>
<p><b>638. </b> On 26 February, Mrs Beckett’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary for Foreign Affairs to say that since December the US had been signalling </p>
<p>their intention to counter Iranian&#8209;supported attacks.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>639. </b> The FCO judged that an aggressive operation could fuel perceptions that the </p>
<p>US was seeking military confrontation with Iran on a broader front. The UK was more </p>
<p>vulnerable to Iranian retaliation than the US, because it maintained an Embassy in </p>
<p>Tehran and because of Iran’s ability to make trouble in Basra and Maysan. Any UK </p>
<p>involvement in the US&#8209;led initiative would require careful consideration of the rules of </p>
<p>engagement for UK troops.</p>

<p><b>640. </b> At the end of February, at the request of Mr McDonald, Dr Marsden produced an </p>
<p>account of what life was like for ordinary Basrawis:</p>
<p>“For most people, life in Basra is still grim … Modest improvements in their quality of </p>
<p>life pale against a backdrop of militia intimidation, official corruption and inadequate </p>
<p>basic services … </p>
<p>“Violence and lawlessness are the overwhelming concern of Basrawis. Although </p>
<p>life under Saddam was harsh, people often say that at least they knew where they </p>
<p>stood. Now, life is less predictable and people are retreating behind the traditional </p>
<p>defences of family and tribe. In polling, 95 percent said they felt a degree of safety </p>
<p>in their immediate neighbourhood but only 30 percent felt safe further afield. Many </p>
<p>Basrawis tell us ‘Before 2003, there was one Saddam to fear. Now there are </p>
<p>thousands of Saddams.’</p>
<p>“Women are increasingly afraid … to leave the house, fearing kidnap, harassment or </p>
<p>sexual violence … After sunset most people desert the streets, stay home and watch </p>
<p>TV … Threats and intimidation are an everyday occurrence …</p>
<p>“After the lack of security, unemployment is the most commonly cited problem. </p>
<p>Polling indicates that only about 30 percent of Basrawis are currently employed … </p>
<p>“Asked what is the greatest improvement since the fall of the regime, many Shia </p>
<p>cite the freedom to travel to shrines in Iran. However, perceptions of freedom differ </p>
<p>depending on the … individual.”</p>
<p>335</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Dr Marsden reported that polling data suggesting Basrawis had a positive attitude </p>
<p>towards the police and wanted the MNF to leave was difficult to evaluate since people </p>
<p>were afraid to complain about the police or militia, or to support the MNF, in front of </p>
<p>individuals they did not know. </p>
<p><b>642. </b> Although there was an “undeniable sense of desperation and gloom in Basra” the </p>
<p>report also said: </p>
<p>“The better off can enjoy new consumer goods and the novelty of the freedom to </p>
<p>travel outside Iraq. Women enjoy more political rights and there is an embryonic civil </p>
<p>society movement. Many Sunni families who left Basra last year have now returned. </p>
<p>There are some signs of growth in the local economy and public sector salaries </p>
<p>have steadily increased.”</p>

<p>120</p>
<p><b>March 2007</b></p>
<p><b>643. </b> In her weekly report on 2 March, Dr Marsden wrote:</p>
<p>“This week we have seen the Sadrists wondering how to respond to the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s announcement and a direct approach from a Sadrist MP … to the FCO. </p>
<p>This approach is encouraging and suggests that there is a political opportunity to be </p>
<p>exploited. It also reinforces our sense that the Sadrists are still in disarray, not just </p>
<p>here but across the country …</p>
<p>“In parallel with … [the Sadrists’] approach in London, there have been some </p>
<p>tentative indications here that OMS/JAM in Basra would like to lower the </p>
<p>temperature and de&#8209;escalate things. But it is far from clear how much of the Sadrist </p>
<p>spectrum … [they] will be able to deliver and how they intend to deal with the </p>
<p>Iranian&#8209;controlled extremist elements, who can be expected to go on attacking us. </p>
<p>The current lack of cohesion in the Sadrist camp underlines the need for caution … </p>
<p>We should certainly pursue this approach but will need to be clear where our red </p>
<p>lines lie.”</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>644. </b> On the same date, Dr Marsden wrote to the Cabinet Office a second time, </p>
<p>attaching the third iteration of the Better Basra Plan.</p>
<p>337</p>
<p> Attached to the Plan were an </p>
<p>annex setting out benchmarks, a detailed work plan for each element, an estimate of </p>
<p>progress against the benchmarks set in December 2006 and a cost estimate for 2007/08 </p>
<p>which totalled around £21m. The Plan had been drafted jointly by MND(SE), the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office Basra and the PRT and had been discussed in detail with the US </p>
<p>Embassy Regional Office in Basra. </p>
<p><b>645. </b> The Plan set out “a comprehensive strategy for bringing Basra to the point where it </p>
<p>can transition to Provincial Iraqi Control”. Implementation of the Plan would be led by the </p>
<p>Southern Iraq Steering Group, bringing together civilian and military efforts. </p>
<p><b>646. </b> The Plan defined “realistic” political success as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi leaders both at national and provincial level take the initiative in arguing the </p>
<p>case for PIC …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Provincial Government gains credibility bringing improvements to ordinary </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a drop in the level of intimidation … of those within the provincial government </p>
<p>and security apparatus …</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>647. </b> In the plan, officials recognised that the UK authorities could not achieve those </p>
<p>things without active support from the Iraqi authorities in Basra and Baghdad:</p>
<p>“The announcement of our planned withdrawal from MNF sites in the city centre has </p>
<p>created a more favourable political environment in which to pursue this objective </p>
<p>by showing that we are serious about transition. Early transition to PIC is important </p>
<p>to some influential local leaders, who may be more willing than before to give </p>
<p>rhetorical support to our transfer conditions. We also need support form the Central </p>
<p>Government. Maliki’s attention is currently focused on the Baghdad Security Plan. </p>
<p>Engaging him on Basra will be difficult, but must be our objective.”</p>
<p><b>648. </b> On security, the Plan said:</p>
<p>“Our military actions should aim to create the conditions in which local politicians feel </p>
<p>able to engage constructively to address Basra’s problems. Our aim is to reduce the </p>
<p>threat from illegal armed groups and Iranian proxies and to build the capacity of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army to take on militant JAM …</p>
<p>“Operation SINBAD has put MND(SE) on the front foot and served to kickstart </p>
<p>the process of transition. One of the major benefits of this operation has been the </p>
<p>experience it has given the local units of the Iraqi Army in planning and carrying out </p>
<p>joint operations alongside the Iraqi police and coalition forces …”</p>
<p><b>649. </b> The Plan also said:</p>
<p>“We will reduce the threat from illegal armed groups by putting an increased </p>
<p>emphasis on operations against militant JAM, death squad leaders and Iranian </p>
<p>proxies. MND(SE) will maintain a heightened tempo of targeted strike operations </p>
<p>and conduct more joint operations with the ISF (including Iraqi Special Forces) in </p>
<p>order to neutralise irreconcilables and death squads, and deliver the message that </p>
<p>we cannot be bombed out of Basra.”</p>
<p><b>650. </b> The Plan listed objectives for policing, the judiciary and prisons (which are </p>
<p>covered in Section 12.1), for infrastructure, governance and economic development </p>
<p>(see Section 10.2) and for strategic communications, which aimed to “get Iraqis to </p>
<p>deliver key messages on our behalf”. </p>
<p><b>651. </b> On 3 March, Iraqi Special Forces, supported by MNF&#8209;I troops, carried out a raid on </p>
<p>the Iraqi Police&#8209;run National Intelligence and Investigation Agency (NIIA) in Basra.</p>
<p>338</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>653. </b> British military spokesman Major David Gell was quoted as saying:</p>
<p>“We believe there were about 30 people found imprisoned in the building and there </p>
<p>was evidence of torture.”</p>
<p>340</p>
<p><b>654. </b> UK media reported a statement issued by Prime Minister Maliki’s Office calling </p>
<p>for those behind the “illegal and irresponsible” act to be punished and reporting that an </p>
<p>investigation into the incident had been ordered.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>655. </b> A more detailed account of the raid, and the Iraqi Government’s response to it, can </p>
<p>be found in Section 12.1. </p>
<p><b>656. </b> Prime Minister Maliki told Mr Asquith two days later that he was disappointed at </p>
<p>the “reprehensible” way in which the raid had been conducted and the violation of Iraqi </p>
<p>sovereignty that it represented.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> He warned that the consequence of such operations </p>
<p>might be severe restrictions on the ability to deploy the Iraqi Special Forces. A joint </p>
<p>investigation was launched into the incident. </p>
<p><b>657. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 6 March, Mr Blair said that Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki was “irritated” with the 3 March raid, but suggested that irritation was </p>
<p>positive evidence of taking greater responsibility.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p><b>658. </b> Mr Blair said that the UK was “making progress against the JAM” in Basra, </p>
<p>and retained “full combat capability” there. He suggested that close engagement on </p>
<p>reconciliation remained necessary. </p>
<p><b>659. </b> On 7 March, the Fadhila Party announced that it was withdrawing from the United </p>
<p>Iraqi Alliance (UIA) and establishing itself as an independent bloc.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Mr Asquith commented:</p>
<p>“That is good for Iraq in the medium term in that it introduces flexibility into the </p>
<p>sectarian rigidities. But in the short term, it produces a further element of uncertainty </p>
<p>… There is no immediate threat to the BSP [Baghdad Security Plan], to which </p>
<p>political leaders … remain committed. However … UIA is visibly weakened … </p>
<p>Fadhila’s platform (moderate, nationalist, non&#8209;sectarian, separation of clergy from </p>
<p>active participation in policies) has wide appeal, particularly to other disaffected </p>
<p>in the Shia bloc … I doubt at this stage Allawi will formally join … But he and </p>
<p>Fadhila will be going after some of the same constituency … This points to Allawi </p>
<p>working more in opposition to Maliki than in support. Maliki, more exposed to SCIRI </p>

<p><b>661. </b> On 8 March, Dr Howells updated DOP(I) on finalisation of the Better Basra Plan </p>
<p>and the process for implementing it.</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> It would be circulated out of committee for </p>
<p>Ministers “to note”. </p>
<p><b>662. </b> The MOD briefing for Mr Browne, who chaired the meeting, stated that the move </p>
<p>to Basra Air Station would “impact significantly on the range of activity the FCO and the </p>
<p>PRT can carry out” and encouraged him to ask:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Post re&#8209;posturing, will it be possible to deliver the effort required [on police </p>
<p>training and reform] from Basra Air Station and the Warren?”</p>
<p>346</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Will FCO be able to achieve the level of local political engagement required, </p>
<p>particularly over the critical period when UK forces are re&#8209;posturing?”</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>663. </b> DOP(I) also discussed a paper on the humanitarian situation in Iraq and concluded </p>

<p>not be overstated and agreed to visit Iraq as proposed by the FCO.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>666. </b> Also on 8 March, Maj Gen Shaw wrote in his weekly report:</p>
<p>“It is clear that the [NIIA] raid was both legal and, in tactical targeting terms, a </p>
<p>good call … Within the context of the wider politics of Iraq and with the benefit of </p>
<p>hindsight, however, the operation was ill&#8209;judged. Local political reaction has been </p>
<p>relatively muted … My sense though is that, locally, the desire for progress and </p>
<p>transition remains and this should motivate them to treat this incident more as a </p>

<p><b>667. </b> In his Weekly Assessment of the same date, Mr Asquith wrote:</p>
<p>“Iraqi feelings that their sovereignty is being bruised by MNF actions are increasingly </p>
<p>prominent … Resentment about MNF actions will inevitably extend to questioning </p>
<p>their authorities and then their presence … Acceleration of the PIC timetable is now </p>
<p>back on the table, having disappeared temporarily under the welter of activity related </p>
<p>to the BSP [Baghdad Security Plan]. The impact of this mood on our plans for Basra, </p>
<p>MNF ability to carry out operations against more sensitive Shia/Iranian targets, the </p>
<p>June review of SCR 1723 and thereafter on any chances of a successor SCR at the </p>
<p>end of the year … is obvious. I don’t detect from Maliki any problems (yet) with our </p>
<p>Basra timetable – though he is said to be seething at reporting in the Arabic press, </p>
<p>drawing on press briefing in London, implying that we would be prepared to repeat </p>
<p>the Jameat and NIAA operations if a further such opportunity arose.”</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>668. </b> On 10 March, a meeting of countries neighbouring Iraq and the five Permanent </p>
<p>Members of the UN Security Council was held in Baghdad.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> Attending for the UK </p>
<p>alongside Mr McDonald, Mr Asquith reported:</p>
<p>“Maliki’s opening address … sought to reassure participants that the GoI </p>
<p>[Government of Iraq] was determined to tackle sectarian violence, but emphasised </p>
<p>the common interest in a stable Iraq … Delegates were constructive and supportive </p>
<p>in their interventions and the tone of discussions was genuinely positive. </p>
<p>“A common theme was support for the GoI’s efforts to overcome the challenges. Iran </p>
<p>sought a timetable for the withdrawal of MNF&#8209;I as they were part of the problem not </p>
<p>the solution … France and Syria also sought a timetable for MNF&#8209;I withdrawal.”</p>
<p><b>669. </b> The IPU reported to Dr Howells that the meeting had failed to resolve the format, </p>
<p>location and timing of a follow&#8209;up meeting of Ministers.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>670. </b> The day after the neighbours meeting, Lt Gen Lamb reported that there had been </p>
<p>a shift in focus within the MNF&#8209;I leadership, with greater recognition of the potential </p>
<p>opportunities offered by the engagement/reconciliation framework.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>671. </b> Lt Gen Lamb wrote that Gen Petraeus had been “seriously taken” with the quality </p>

<p><b>672. </b> Lt Gen Lamb observed that if the MNF were unable to sustain the security </p>
<p>initiative, the population would inevitably look to JAM for their future protection. </p>
<p>Separately, he noted that the US was planning to send an additional 2,200 Military </p>
<p>Police to Iraq to help with the expected additional prisoners resulting from Operation </p>
<p>Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon.</p>
<p><b>673. </b> In relation to the NIIA raid, Lt Gen Lamb reported that:</p>
<p>“The political aftermath of the Basra incident continues to play high in Baghdad a </p>
<p>week after the event. Whatever the rights and wrongs, the facts or speculation … </p>
<p>the incident … lit the touch paper on an issue that has been gaining increasing </p>
<p>importance ever since May 2006 – that of Iraqi sovereignty and dignity. It is one that, </p>
<p>above all, the Prime Minister [Maliki] has invested significant personal capital in, </p>
<p>and … will affect all our relationships and authorities throughout 2007 – seeing them </p>
<p>becoming increasingly restricted … Even with our most comfortable of interlocutors, </p>
<p>the feeling has been of deep embarrassment and anger. So unless we ensure, both </p>
<p>at home and in&#8209;theatre, that the coalition are operating within the GOI’s bounds of </p>
<p>acceptable behaviour and sovereignty, we will find ourselves with much to lose. </p>
<p>Consequently, I sense, the mid&#8209;year UNSCR review has the potential to be a </p>
<p>significantly more important event than it was last time round.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>674. </b> Gen Petraeus told Mr McDonald that the NIIA operation “continued to cause </p>
<p>ripples”.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> Things had gone wrong and there were lessons to be learned, but he was </p>
<p>“broadly content” with the UK’s plans for re&#8209;posturing in Basra, having been reassured </p>
<p>by contact with No.10. </p>
<p><b>675. </b> In his weekly report of 15 March, Maj Gen Shaw reflected:</p>
<p>“If we are to address the Iraqi end&#8209;state, our focus needs to be less on the 90 percent </p>
<p>violence against us, more on the 10 percent reported inter&#8209;Shia/Iraqi violence which </p>
<p>threatens stability when we are gone. Tackling death squad leaders … who pose the </p>
<p>major threat to the political stability of Basra, is the most useful application of military </p>
<p>force to support the political end&#8209;state …</p>
<p>“My short&#8209;term concern is that the issue blights transition … A line needs to be </p>
<p>drawn under this operation in the interest of achieving Iraqi self&#8209;reliance … My long </p>
<p>term concerns centre around the defining impact these investigations will have </p>
<p>for our future operations and indeed rationale. Firstly, the ‘Untouchable’ status of </p>
<p>ISOF [Iraqi Special Operations Forces] is already being attacked by the sectional </p>
<p>interest within the GOI [Government of Iraq] that (quite rightly) feel threatened by </p>
<p>such a body. The fear is that their freedom of movement and action is curtailed, their </p>
<p>operations politically constrained; this would be most damaging to ISOF itself and </p>
<p>PM Maliki’s ability to operate to the national interest. Secondly, the danger is that </p>
<p>political constraints are so tightly drawn that MND(SE) cannot operate against the </p>

<p>10 percent threat to the Iraqi end state. If we ever reached the stage when MND(SE) </p>
<p>were restricted to operations in pursuit of our own force protection, we would need </p>
<p>seriously to question our rationale for being here.”</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>676. </b> The Mayor of Sadr City, Sheik Raheem Al Daraji, and his friend Mr Mohammed </p>
<p>Mutashar, were attacked on 15 March.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> The Mayor escaped with minor injuries but his </p>
<p>friend was killed. </p>
<p><b>677. </b> Lt Gen Lamb observed that the anger the attack generated within parts of the </p>
<p>community had opened an existing rift within JAM/Office of the Martyr Sadr and the </p>
<p>‘city’ and created a greater willingness for at least parts of an emerging leadership to  </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate with MNF&#8209;I.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Mr Asquith reported on 15 March that there was growing speculation in Baghdad </p>
<p>about the possibility of a coup against Prime Minister Maliki led by Dr Allawi, with one </p>
<p>SCIRI cleric claiming that the UK was promoting such a coup.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> Mr Asquith wrote:</p>
<p>“Allawi as I suspected has moved into opposition mode. He aims to amass sufficient </p>
<p>support to force and win a vote of no confidence and assume the Premiership … </p>
<p>The constituent elements of the UIA … are testing where separate alliances might </p>
<p>be made in case the Baghdad security plan founders …</p>
<p>“My message (private and public) has been to reiterate our solid support for Maliki </p>
<p>in his pursuit of establishing the conditions on the ground for greater stability; to </p>
<p>encourage those working so hard to build a rival to the current government to </p>
<p>direct their efforts instead to contributing to the success of the Baghdad Plan by </p>
<p>reassuring Maliki of their support; and to focus them on how they might improve the </p>
<p>effectiveness of the government with Maliki as PM …</p>
<p>“Given their number, disparity of views and unpredictability, the Sadrists remain a </p>
<p>key element in the political and security reckoning. Their quiescence in Baghdad </p>
<p>is largely responsible for the positive early indicators in FAQ [Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon]. </p>
<p>Essentially Arab (albeit Shia) nationalist in outlook, with non&#8209;Islamist and even </p>
<p>politically secular strands, there are sections prepared to work with coalition forces – </p>
<p>and Sunnis – if they see it to their advantage … This is the moment to bring in the </p>
<p>moderates, rather than to take on the whole movement which would risk provoking </p>
<p>a schism and the emergence of a radical Taliban&#8209;like wing.”</p>
<p><b>679. </b> In a telegram on 16 March, Mr Asquith assessed that the Baghdad Security Plan </p>
<p>was continuing to make progress:</p>
<p>“Overall, the picture remains positive. Maliki … continues to impress – out in </p>
<p>front and even&#8209;handed. But, whenever he has an opportunity, General Petraeus </p>

<p><b>680. </b> In a letter to Mr Fletcher on 16 March, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary reported </p>
<p>that three investigations had been launched into the NIIA incident: one by the MNF, </p>
<p>one by the Iraqi Ministry of the Interior and one by Prime Minister Maliki’s Ministerial </p>
<p>Security Adviser on Basra.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p> The MOD recognised that there could not be similar </p>
<p>incidents. The MNF was reviewing mechanisms for informing the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>of sensitive operations.</p>
<p><b>681. </b> On 20 March, Mr Blair met ACM Stirrup and senior officials for an update on Iraq.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> </p>
<p>ACM Stirrup reported signs of improvement in security in Baghdad, though there was </p>
<p>some concern that JAM might simply be lying low. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> In Basra, he wrote that a large majority of attacks continued to be directed </p>
<p>against the MNF, rather than being intra&#8209;Iraqi. If policing and rule of law issues could be </p>
<p>addressed effectively, there was a reasonable chance that the overall level of attacks </p>
<p>would come down significantly post&#8209;transition. </p>
<p><b>683. </b> ACM Stirrup told Mr Blair that “Petraeus had been helpful in handling the fallout </p>
<p>from the raid on the NIIA headquarters, and that this was in any case having only a </p>
<p>limited effect on operations in Basra itself.”</p>
<p><b>684. </b> Mr Blair asked about progress on political issues, and in particular reconciliation, </p>
<p>emphasising that “it remained one of the highest priorities in achieving long&#8209;term </p>
<p>success in Iraq”. He judged that a more effective strategy was needed “which would </p>
<p>involve an identified US/UK figure, working with an identified Iraqi figure, both </p>
<p>empowered to deliver serious benefits to Sunni groups”. Mr Blair concluded that </p>
<p>“if necessary, we should be prepared to exert leverage on Maliki and those around </p>
<p>him to deliver on the political aspects of reconciliation”.</p>
<p><b>685. </b> On the same day, Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference.</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair welcomed the relatively positive news coming from Baghdad, observing that it </p>
<p>was absolutely clear that the majority of people in Iraq did not want violence. Mr Blair </p>
<p>said that it was important that the UK and US continued to support Prime Minister </p>

<p>Maliki; a real effort by him on reconciliation would enhance Iraq’s relations with its </p>
<p>Sunni neighbours. </p>
<p><b>686. </b> Maj Gen Shaw reported on 21 March: “The ripples of the raid on the NIIA are </p>
<p>seemingly spreading the further we get from the operation itself.”</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>687. </b> The Iraqi MOD had issued a letter stating that joint operations between the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army in Basra and the MNF should cease (temporarily). Although this had since been </p>
<p>rescinded, Maj Gen Shaw commented that “this makes moving Basra forward towards </p>
<p>PIC more difficult”.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> On 21 March, at the request of the Iraq Senior Officials Group, the JIC examined </p>
<p>the relative threat posed by AQ&#8209;I in Iraq compared with other Sunni insurgent groups.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>689. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“I. Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ&#8209;I) is the single largest Sunni insurgent network with the </p>
<p>greatest geographical spread and influence. AQ&#8209;I’s main effort is the prosecution </p>
<p>of a sectarian campaign designed to drag Iraq into civil war. Its campaign had been </p>
<p>the most effective of any insurgent group: it has had significant impact over the past </p>
<p>year and poses the greatest immediate threat to stability in Iraq. </p>
<p>“II. Sustained Multi&#8209;National Force (MNF) pressure has prevented AQ&#8209;I from </p>
<p>establishing unchallenged control across any significant part of Iraq. But it has had </p>
<p>only temporary impact on the level of their violence …”</p>
<p><b>690. </b> The JIC judged that distinctions between “Sunni Arab nationalists” and “jihadists” </p>
<p>were increasingly artificial:</p>
<p>“Although key AQ&#8209;I leadership elements remain non&#8209;Iraqi, the organisation’s </p>
<p>membership is overwhelmingly Iraqi and largely indistinguishable from the wider </p>
<p>Sunni insurgency. We judge many Sunni insurgents see common cause in resisting </p>
<p>Shia violence, the ‘occupation’ and, increasingly, what they see as a hostile </p>
<p>Iranian&#8209;backed government.”</p>
<p><b>691. </b> The JIC added in a footnote:</p>
<p>“The AQ endorsed leader, Abu Ayyub al&#8209;Masri, is Egyptian; the nominal (and </p>
<p>possibly fictitious) head of the Islamic State of Iraq is Abu Umar al&#8209;Baghdadi, </p>
<p>an Iraqi.”</p>
<p><b>692. </b> The JIC stated:</p>
<p>“MNF have identified more than 50 groups by name, but they have no coherent </p>
<p>overall leadership, only localised influence and no single dominant group has </p>

<p>emerged … A number of Sunni groups are involved in sectarian attacks, but we </p>
<p>judge AQ&#8209;I is in the vanguard: … its strategic main effort is the prosecution of a </p>
<p>sectarian campaign designed to drag Iraq into civil war … </p>
<p>“MNF have been successful in identifying and killing or capturing a large number </p>
<p>of senior AQ&#8209;I leaders … Sustained MNF pressure has prevented AQ&#8209;I from </p>
<p>establishing unchallenged control across any significant part of Iraq. But it has </p>
<p>had only temporary impact on the level of their violence … Networks have proven </p>
<p>resilient in the face of losses of both personnel and material … We judge that in </p>
<p>many Sunni areas support for AQ&#8209;I is now well established. We judge this support </p>
<p>is not driven primarily by religious ideology. Coercion and intimidation play a part, </p>
<p>but more important factors include AQ&#8209;I’s visible successes in attacks on the MNF </p>
<p>and the Shia dominated Iraqi government, its ample funds and effective propaganda </p>
<p>machine: particularly its achievement in portraying itself as the main defender of </p>
<p>Sunni interests against Shia attack …”</p>
<p><b>693. </b> On future prospects the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“… the lack of progress by the Iraqi Government in delivering any tangible progress </p>
<p>on national reconciliation, combined with spiralling sectarian violence, has helped </p>
<p>bolster support for AQ&#8209;I. Unless the Iraqi government can convince Sunnis that it is </p>
<p>genuinely interested in their concerns, we judge there is little chance of this trend </p>
<p>being reversed. A hard core of Sunni support for AQ&#8209;I will remain irreconcilable, </p>
<p>but some progress around key issues such as federalism, de&#8209;Ba’athification, reform </p>
<p>of the ISF, and the release of detainees could erode support among the broader </p>
<p>Sunni population.”</p>
<p><b>694. </b> In preparation for a telephone call with Prime Minister Maliki, Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary updated Mr Blair on the continued fallout from the NIIA raid:</p>
<p>“Maliki was annoyed about this perceived slight to Iraqi sovereignty but his Chief </p>
<p>of Staff has advised us against dwelling on the subject. The MNFI investigation has </p>
<p>concluded that the operation was conducted in good faith and in support of Iraqi </p>
<p>law – that is, with a view to executing a sealed warrant issued by an Iraqi judge </p>
<p>in respect of a suspected death squad leader. But no notification was given either </p>
<p>to the Iraqi Government or General Petraeus … because the operation has been </p>
<p>deemed to be ‘time sensitive’ by those carrying it out.”</p>
<p>366</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Mr Blair spoke to Prime Minister Maliki on 22 March.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> He emphasised the UK’s </p>
<p>and his own personal “full support” for Prime Minister Maliki’s government and assured </p>
<p>him that nothing the UK did was intended to undermine or challenge the sovereignty of </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>696. </b> Prime Minister Maliki recognised the need to tackle the militia but believed that, in </p>
<p>destroying the NIIA Office, UK officers had contravened the understanding between the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government and the coalition. </p>
<p><b>697. </b> On 22 March, disturbances between JAM and Fadhila in Basra city centre left the </p>
<p>Governor and Fadhila “severely rattled” and “beginning to question the advisability of </p>

<p>368</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>698. </b> Mr Richard Jones, who had succeeded Dr Marsden as the British Consul General </p>
<p>in Basra on 5 March, wrote:</p>
<p>“The immediate winner from the mayhem was JAM … But I think JAM’s triumph will </p>
<p>be pretty short&#8209;lived. It continues to disintegrate into splinter groups … And it should </p>
<p>realise that the public appetite for this sort of blatant violence has real limits … If </p>
<p>there is a single winner from 22 March, it may be Badr/SCIRI, who stood apart from </p>
<p>the fray …”</p>
<p><b>699. </b> Mr Jones reported that the impact of the incident had been: </p>
<p>“Prominent Basrawis whom the GOC and I have met this week have all expressed </p>
<p>concerns about future power struggles, particularly after transition to PIC. The </p>
<p>general atmosphere among the local population remains one of fear, insecurity </p>
<p>and a lack of trust in public institutions … That said, the Iraqi authorities and the </p>
<p>figures mediating between the parties … managed to keep a lid on the situation … </p>
<p>So we should clearly continue our work to prepare the security forces to take on full </p>
<p>responsibility as soon as possible. And we should prepare ourselves for the fact that </p>
<p>… the political solutions may not always be the ones that we would instinctively go </p>
<p>for – what matters is that they buy the consent of Basrawi citizens.”</p>

<p>Mr Browne made a statement to the House of Commons on 16 April describing the events </p>
<p>that followed:</p>
<p>“The Iranians detained our personnel illegally, taking them first to an Iranian </p>
<p>Revolutionary Guard naval base, and from there to Tehran. We made it clear, </p>
<p>both directly to the Iranians and in public statements, that their detention was </p>
<p>unacceptable and that they should be released immediately. We made intense </p>
<p>diplomatic efforts to establish direct lines of communication with Iranian leaders, </p>
<p>to prevent the situation from escalating and to resolve it quickly.”</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>The personnel from HMS Cornwall were held until 4 April, when their release was </p>
<p>unexpectedly announced by President Ahmadinejad during a press conference.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> Whilst </p>
<p>in captivity, footage of some of the crew confessing that they had trespassed in Iranian </p>
<p>waters had been broadcast.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lamb reported on 25 March that the incident:</p>
<p>“… has had an unhelpful impact on business, which will take some days to work </p>
<p>through. Both the Ambassador [Mr Asquith] and I are working with Iraqi colleagues </p>
<p>to secure a result and get our boys back, but unfortunately, this heaps more pressure </p>
<p>on Maliki right when he doesn’t need it.”</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the personnel were released, considerable controversy was generated by the </p>
<p>decision to allow individuals to sell their accounts to the media. Mr Browne told the House </p>
<p>of Commons that he had “made a mistake” in agreeing the advice from the Royal Navy </p>
<p>that this should be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 8 April Lt Gen Lamb wrote in his weekly report:</p>
<p>“… the mood music here is that the US is delighted at the safe return of the crew, </p>
<p>but somewhat mystified at their conduct both at the point of capture but more so on </p>
<p>their behaviour subsequently in detention which they found very un&#8209;British … The </p>
<p>Iraqis are similarly nonplussed that we appear to have co&#8209;operated with the Iranians’ </p>
<p>media drive. I am unsighted to the detail but the breaking news that those detained </p>
<p>by the Iranians have been given permission to sell their stories leaves an old and </p>
<p>increasingly worn General like myself questioning what has become of a military </p>
<p>whose heritage to this date has been revered by virtually every other nation as the </p>
<p>benchmark of fortitude, service and sacrifice.”</p>

<p>Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fulton was appointed by ACM Stirrup to lead an inquiry </p>

<p>The Foreign Affairs Select Committee (FASC) published its report into the incident on </p>

<p>377</p>
<p> The FASC concluded that it was “difficult to fault” the UK’s diplomatic </p>

<p>no evidence of a deal between UK and Iran to ensure release. The decision to allow </p>

<p> A career diplomat, he had previously served as Ambassador </p>

<p>“Whatever the reasons for the Republicans’ defeat in November 2006 … Democrats </p>
<p>in Congress were behaving as if Iraq had been the main issue, giving them a </p>

<p>Iraq is shaping the campaign … The effect of Iraq on presidential politics rather than </p>
<p>the effect of what the US is doing in Iraq is the focus of attention.</p>
<p>“No one I met expected Bush to change course. If Operation Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon failed, </p>

<p> Mr Blair responded: “V. Depressing. Can we share this with the US? I remain </p>
<p>of the view that this issue is central. Can I see Petraeus?”</p>
<p>383</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>707. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 28 March, Mr Blair said that the UK </p>
<p>would be able to make much better progress in Basra if Prime Minister Maliki “took a </p>
<p>consistent, firm line on the sectarian militia elements that were causing trouble there” </p>
<p>and asked the President to reinforce this message.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>708. </b> In late March, a leading Sadrist militiaman, Qais al Khaz’ali, was detained by the </p>
<p>MNF in Basra.</p>
<p>385 </p>
<p>He had been incriminated in operations against the MNF and had direct </p>
<p>links with the Iranians; but he had also been used by Prime Minister Maliki as a channel </p>
<p>to the Sadrist movement and Muqtada al Sadr. Prime Minister Maliki sought al Khaz’ali’s </p>
<p>release, but Mr Asquith described the US as “unpersuadable”. </p>
<p><b>709. </b> Mr Asquith saw this as a test of Prime Minister Maliki’s approach to reconciliation. </p>
<p>He considered that it was in the UK’s interest to help Prime Minister Maliki neutralise a </p>
<p>JAM challenge to Operation Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon. The coalition therefore needed “to help </p>
<p>him find alternative routes into tractable Sadrists while reinforcing its own message that </p>
<p>it is prepared to deal with the biddable”.</p>
<p><b>710. </b> On 30 March, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told him that:</p>
<p>“The Baghdad Security Plan is having some success in reducing the effectiveness, </p>
<p>but not the number of attacks (by, for example, improving physical protection of </p>
<p>market areas). But violence is being displaced out of Baghdad, and there have been </p>
<p>a few major, mass&#8209;casualty attacks this week.”</p>
<p>386</p>
<p><b>711. </b> On Basra, the Private Secretary’s update stated:</p>
<p>“The continued disruption of JAM ‘secret cell’ activity appears to be reducing attacks </p>
<p>on the coalition somewhat, but local politics are becoming more nakedly violent.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>April 2007</b></p>
<p><b>713. </b> In his weekly update on 3 April, Maj Gen Shaw reported that despite “the noise </p>
<p>of everyday events” the “surprising thing is how much UK campaign aspirations are on </p>
<p>track”.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> He attributed that to an increasing US and Iraqi desire to accelerate transition </p>
<p>to PIC. </p>
<p><b>714. </b> Maj Gen Shaw’s report also reflected on UK understanding of the political </p>
<p>dynamics within Iraq:</p>
<p>“When this HQ arrived we came with a thesis based on the work of the historian </p>
<p>Charles Tripp … that Iraqi power had been split since the 1920s between the official </p>
<p>and the shadow states; that the official state had been degraded by the Iran&#8209;Iraq </p>
<p>war, sanctions and then the 2003 invasion and subsequent CPA decisions; and that </p>
<p>the 2005 elections were more of a census than a democratic election – people voted </p>
<p>on sectarian lines. The result is an official state (political structures and parties) </p>
<p>populated by the shadow state (militias), much of it backed by their own dark state </p>
<p>(death squads, secret cells). The removal of Saddam removed the major unifying </p>
<p>factor in Iraq; now there is competition within and between these layers of power. </p>
<p>After three months … this analytic prism [is] the only one that makes sense of what </p>
<p>is going on here.”</p>
<p><b>715. </b> Maj Gen Shaw observed that:</p>
<p>“It is people’s actions, rather than their affiliations to a particular militia, that </p>
<p>determine whether they are a force for stability in Iraq or not. Muthanna and Dhi Qar </p>
<p>achieved PIC precisely because of the stability generated by Badr/SCIRI dominated </p>
<p>political and ISF institutions; Maysan’s PIC is based on JAM/OMS ability to deliver </p>
<p>stability and in particular the Governor of Maysan who is a Sadrist and who </p>
<p>undoubtedly has links to JAM in the Province. He is also, however, one of the most </p>
<p>convincing, technocratic and professional politicians I have met in Iraq; if anyone </p>
<p>can deliver Maysan, he can.”</p>
<p><b>716. </b> Looking ahead, Maj Gen Shaw wrote:</p>
<p>“The major question for the South is the scale and depth of Iran’s ambitions with </p>
<p>regard to Iraq. While Iran seeks currently to use its backing of a number of groupings </p>
<p>to create a level of instability for MNF, the question is what its ambitions are once </p>
<p>MNF has departed. There will always be an Iranian influence in Iraq, the bonds of </p>
<p>family and tribe reach back years and do not respect the artificial borders drawn </p>
<p>by others. Economic trade across the border is an essential feature of life and is </p>
<p>potentially a positive factor for both Iraq and Iran in the future. Our assessment at </p>
<p>present therefore is that an unstable neighbour is not in the longer&#8209;term interests </p>
<p>388 </p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>of Iran. If this is true then the question becomes what happens to the relationship </p>
<p>between Iran and those it has been backing.</p>
<p>“Iran is … backing a number of horses, providing funding to both their long&#8209;term </p>
<p>partners Badr/SCIRI and others such as JAM … This would seem to suggest that </p>
<p>Iran will still wish to have influence (although not necessarily malign) through Badr/</p>
<p>SCIRI and the political process and that JAM is a short term expedient to cause </p>
<p>trouble for MNF. Once MNF has departed it is not clear how open SCIRI will be </p>
<p>to being run from Iran – are they bought or have they been rented? We assess </p>
<p>at present that they have not been bought and that their aspirations for Iraq are </p>
<p>nationalist ones …</p>
<p>“With Muqtada remaining in Iran he is unable to exercise control over his </p>
<p>organisation [JAM]. This, along with strikes against JAM in both the north and </p>
<p>south, all serves to make the JAM franchise increasingly incoherent. Perversely, </p>
<p>while this is partly MNF’s aim, a complete fracturing of the organisation may not </p>
<p>be in our interests – you cannot do a deal with chaos! There needs to be a rump </p>
<p>left of sufficient size and coherence with which we can pursue reconciliation.”</p>
<p><b>717. </b> On 4 April, the Iraqi Government announced that Maysan would transfer to </p>
<p>PIC on 18 April.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>718. </b> In a video conference discussion with President Bush on 5 April, Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that “there was some chance of a deal with a more significant proportion of the Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency than we had previously been able to reach”.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p> He suggested that the </p>
<p>coalition’s aim should be to “make common cause” with them against the elements of </p>
<p>AQ&#8209;I whose attacks “were the greatest spur to continued sectarian violence”. </p>
<p><b>719. </b> The impact of the NIIA raid continued to be felt: in early April Dr Safi al&#8209;Safa, Acting </p>
<p>Justice Minister, issued a statement demanding a formal apology for the incident.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>720. </b> Dr al&#8209;Safa said that the coalition should “acknowledge that members of the </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Forces have overstepped their authority, committed a major mistake and </p>
<p>were negligent in allowing prisoners to escape”.</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Prime Minister Maliki’s office responded by saying that Dr al&#8209;Safa’s statement did </p>
<p>not necessarily reflect the views of the Iraqi Government.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>722. </b> Maj Gen Shaw’s Chief of Staff reported on 12 April:</p>
<p>“It has been a sobering week. The conspicuously smooth and successful handover </p>
<p>of the Shatt al&#8209;Arab Hotel was counter&#8209;pointed by … attacks … that resulted in the </p>
<p>deaths of four soldiers, one interpreter and four wounded … We are … engaged in </p>
<p>a dynamic struggle with a resourceful and adaptive enemy.”</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>723. </b> On 12 April, Sir Nigel Sheinwald spoke to Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister </p>
<p>Barham Salih who said that in order to make progress on reconciliation:</p>
<p>“Two key pieces of legislation were needed, which would require US and UK support </p>
<p>and lobbying. The de&#8209;Ba’athification law had been agreed by Maliki and Talabani, </p>
<p>but was still being resisted by parts of the UIA … The Hydrocarbons Law was almost </p>
<p>there, but still required some further engagement with the Kurds. There was also </p>
<p>a need for structural reform of the government to enable power&#8209;sharing with the </p>
<p>Sunnis and Kurds, and prevent their marginalisation.”</p>
<p>395</p>
<p><b>724. </b> In a separate conversation Dr Muaffaq al Rubaie, the Iraqi National Security </p>
<p>Adviser, told Sir Nigel that “there was a growing consensus in support of the need to </p>
<p>rehabilitate and reconcile”.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p><b>725. </b> After a discussion about Basra, Dr Rubaie proposed establishing regular round </p>
<p>table discussions between key Iraqi and UK leaders in Baghdad and Basra. Sir Nigel </p>
<p>thought this should go ahead. Mr Blair agreed.</p>
<p>397</p>
<p><b>726. </b> On 13 April, a Cabinet Office official told Mr Blair that an International Compact </p>
<p>would be launched on 3 May, followed by a “Neighbours Plus Ministerial meeting” the </p>
<p>next day (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p>398</p>
<p> The Iraqi Government was expected to use that as an </p>
<p>opportunity to urge international partners to pledge investment and consider further debt </p>
<p>relief for Iraq. </p>
<p><b>727. </b> The official wrote that “encouraging investment in the current security environment, </p>
<p>and in the absence of any real progress on the <b>reconciliation</b> agenda, will be difficult”. </p>
<p>Against that point, Mr Blair wrote “this is the key”. </p>

<p><b>728. </b> On 15 April, Lt Gen Lamb reported encouraging signs of progress elsewhere </p>
<p>in Iraq: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>significant increases in the volume of weapon and IED caches found in  </p>
<p>Multi&#8209;National Division (West), indicating a marked improvement in local tribes’ </p>
<p>co&#8209;operation; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic development in Baghdad, despite the continuing security difficulties; </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a growing number of groups that were prepared to tackle their differences </p>
<p>through dialogue rather than violence.</p>
<p>399</p>
<p><b>729. </b> In Basra, he considered the MNF&#8209;I were “seeing a subtle shift amongst the wider </p>
<p>Sadrist trend and with it the tensions within JAM”.</p>
<p><b>730. </b> On Iran, Lt Gen Lamb wrote:</p>
<p>“What is clear as we continue to ‘stress’ the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard </p>
<p>Corps], Quds Force and their surrogates inside Iraq is that we are unpicking what </p>
<p>has been a slow build plan of active interference and Iranian control that set out to </p>
<p>humiliate the coalition, especially the US and UK, kill its Forces and intimidate or buy </p>
<p>its way into positions of superior influence and power. This plan is for the first time </p>
<p>being seriously challenged and consequently damaged … Our current actions … </p>
<p>intend to remove the current imbalance of interference and control of Iran within </p>
<p>Iraq … </p>
<p>“Iranian oil prices, as a result of an unsettled market due to Iraq’s problems, are </p>
<p>resulting in an additional revenue to Iran of around $30&#8209;$40 million per day – funding </p>
<p>terrorism in Iraq might seem a good investment. Regrettably, the same would be true </p>
<p>for any other oil selling nation in the neighbourhood.”</p>
<p><b>731. </b> In response to a call at Friday prayers the previous week, a demonstration </p>
<p>against Governor Waili took place in Basra on 16 April.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p> Despite the prior involvement </p>
<p>of senior Baghdad politicians in planning the demonstration, the fear of unrest was </p>
<p>sufficient for Prime Minister Maliki to order that official approval for the demonstration </p>
<p>be withdrawn. It nonetheless went ahead (peacefully) on 16 April, with several thousand </p>
<p>demonstrators, including a “prominent JAM presence”. Mr Jones commented:</p>
<p>“This doesn’t make it any easier to work out what outcome we would like. Our ability </p>
<p>to pick winners under the circumstances is extremely circumscribed (and would in </p>
<p>any case be the kiss of death for our favoured candidate). Nor will we ever be able </p>
<p>to perform the complex acts of juggling which will be required to keep the three blocs </p>

<p>139</p>
<p><b>740. </b> In its paper, the IPU judged that there were “no quick fixes on offer” and that </p>
<p>“the experience of the last four years argues against a ‘grand bargain’ approach”.</p>
<p>408</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair annotated this paragraph “Why? The incremental approach has hardly worked.” </p>
<p><b>741. </b> IPU diagnosed the main obstacle to progress as:</p>
<p>“Iraq has no tradition of power sharing or properly representative Government … </p>
<p>It can only work if the leaders of all Iraq’s main communities believe that it is in their </p>
<p>best interests wholeheartedly to engage in it. That is not yet the case.” </p>
<p><b>742. </b> In the future, IPU recommended that the UK should pursue a more strategic </p>
<p>approach to the process of reconciliation, through support to Prime Minister Maliki’s </p>
<p>Office and MNF&#8209;I’s Joint Reconciliation and Support Cell. Prime Minister Maliki should </p>
<p>be persuaded to change his manner of governing and to make early progress on some </p>
<p>of the key issues (de&#8209;Ba’athification, Hydrocarbons legislation and amendments to the </p>
<p>Constitution). Violence should be reduced and Iraq’s neighbours should be persuaded </p>
<p>to be more supportive.</p>
<p><b>743. </b> On the IPU paper, Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“I’m afraid I don’t find this at all persuasive. It is essentially the same strategy but </p>
<p>trying harder. It won’t work. The US/UK are consistently underestimating their ability </p>
<p>to insist. Maliki &amp; Iraq must be made to go down the reconciliation path with vigour. </p>

<p><b>744. </b> The MOD paper summarised current activity on reconciliation by a small team </p>
<p>led by Lt Gen Lamb in Baghdad and said that “senior commanders and others have </p>
<p>identified a fleeting opportunity that has the potential to deliver a significant campaign </p>
<p>advantage”.</p>

<p> The MNF&#8209;I Engagement and Reconciliation effort was focused on drawing </p>
<p>into the political process those insurgent groups that MNF and the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>assessed as “potentially reconcilable” and was considered to be a “core output” of the </p>
<p>military campaign. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> The MOD explained:</p>
<p>“The ‘Sunni’ initiative has established and developed discreet dialogue with the key </p>
<p>Islamic religious leadership of two of the major insurgent groups … The emerging </p>
<p>leadership … is now, we believe, likely to open dialogue with the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>and MNF&#8209;I, engage in the political process and, subject to these discussions, </p>
<p>follow up with a series of confidence building measures. These range from fighting </p>
<p>Al Qaida (AQ) as part of a Government authorised force and the signing of a </p>
<p>ceasefire agreement with coalition and Iraqi security forces and to public statements </p>
<p>exposing the true nature of the AQ threat to Iraq. This initiative has created tensions </p>

<p>side with political engagement and away from violence. We are also making similar </p>

<p>“The aim is to make tangible progress by late July to underpin General Petraeus’ </p>

<p><b>746. </b> In a covering letter, Mr Browne’s Private Secretary explained that the paper was </p>
<p>being submitted to the Defence Secretary in parallel and commented:</p>
<p>“I am convinced there is something we can do to give a reconciliation initiative a </p>
<p>push. In addition to making sure it is resourced properly and quickly we might also </p>
<p>see whether there is a potential to push a UK/US announcement of the right sort. </p>
<p>A direct reference to this specific work is too crude and potentially damaging but I </p>
<p>think we can be imaginative about say wrapping up transition, cease&#8209;fires, weapons </p>
<p>programmes and development in specific areas (Basra as a pilot?).”</p>
<p><b>747. </b> At the same time as papers on reconciliation were being considered by Mr Blair, </p>
<p>IPU submitted advice to Dr Howells proposing that the UK should work to postpone the </p>
<p>referendum on Kirkuk and other disputed territories.</p>
<p>410</p>
<p> Iraq’s Constitution required that </p>
<p>this should take place by the end of 2007. </p>
<p><b>748. </b> IPU judged that delay was wise because of poor preparations, which meant </p>
<p>that a referendum held before the end of the year was unlikely to be credible and </p>
<p>could spark further insecurity. The main barrier to delaying the referendum would be </p>
<p>Kurdish objections. </p>
<p><b>749. </b> On 22 April, it was agreed at the Ministerial Committee on National Security </p>
<p>meeting that Prime Minister Maliki would chair a group (to include MNF&#8209;I) to determine </p>

<p><b>751. </b> Lt Gen Lamb also reported that Operation Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon continued to make </p>
<p>progress despite the 18 April attacks. He wrote:</p>
<p>“Regrettably it is all too easy for AQ to generate ‘spectaculars’ and give the </p>
<p>impression that things are worse than they actually are, but the most recent trend </p>
<p>data suggests otherwise.” </p>
<p><b>752. </b> Maj Gen Shaw’s 24 April weekly report noted that an IED attack in Maysan on the </p>
<p>day following PIC “served as a sharp reminder that problems remain in the Province and </p>
<p>that it is not a benign environment for the soldiers serving there”.</p>
<p>413</p>
<p> He continued:</p>
<p>“Whether this has been a good or a bad week depends on your criteria, on what </p>
<p>you are looking to measure. Positively, our posture is where we would want it to </p>
<p>be … But the cost mounts: a week to go and this is already the most costly month </p>
<p>of Op TELIC since the invasion. We are at the limit of our ability to achieve effect, </p>
<p>in particular to do anything about the casualties we are taking … The threat will not </p>
<p>go away; indeed, our Theatre view is that there is no incentive for it to do anything </p>
<p>but rise for as long as we are here. This will necessitate continued and probably </p>

<p><b>753. </b> Mr Blair annotated the final phrase, “it is only military benefit that counts”.</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>754. </b> On 24 April, Lt Gen Houghton told the Chiefs of Staff that April:</p>

<p>416</p>
<p> He asked Mr Browne and Mrs Beckett to use their forthcoming </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>757. </b> Overall, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“I. Violence in Basra is increasingly focussed on the Multi&#8209;National Forces (MNF). </p>
<p>Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM) associated ‘secret cells’ believe their campaign has driven </p>
<p>the MNF out: they will try to maintain momentum until the MNF withdraw from the </p>
<p>province altogether. Attacks on the residual presence – particularly at Basra Air </p>
<p>Station – will intensify. The JAM networks are resilient: MNF pressure is likely to </p>
<p>have only temporary success in disrupting their activities.</p>
<p>“II. Most political parties in Basra see Provincial Iraqi Control as an opportunity to </p>
<p>extend their power base. As the scale of MNF presence reduces, violence between </p>
<p>rival Shia parties, backed by their militias, is likely to intensify. Provincial elections </p>
<p>will be a catalyst.”</p>
<p><b>758. </b> The JIC concluded that political events would have a decisive impact:</p>
<p>“III. The nature and scale of any intra&#8209;Shia conflict will be determined by events </p>
<p>in Baghdad and Najaf, particularly the ability of the United Iraqi Alliance to stick </p>
<p>together and assert authority over its provincial supporters. In the absence of an </p>
<p>effective political brake on serious intra&#8209;Shia fighting, the Iraqi security forces would </p>
<p>not be able to cope; the police would probably fragment and the army would try to </p>
<p>avoid direct confrontation, while seeking to contain the situation.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“VI. Iran will continue to provide training and weaponry to Shia extremists, mainly </p>
<p>JAM, attacking the MNF, with the aim of speeding MNF withdrawal from the south </p>
<p>and making its life as difficult as possible so long as it remains.”</p>
<p><b>759. </b> The JIC judged that reported levels of recorded violence in MND(SE) had </p>
<p>increased since it last considered the issue in September 2006, and accounted for </p>
<p>around 5 percent of the national total. The vast majority of the violence occurred in </p>
<p>Basra province and consisted of attacks on the MNF by Shia militia, particularly JAM.</p>
<p><b>760. </b> In Basra, the JIC assessed that Op SINBAD had had “some local effect in </p>
<p>disrupting military activity and improving public confidence” and there was reported to </p>
<p>have been a decrease in the number of sectarian and other murders. Politically, JAM </p>
<p>was becoming more assertive and willing to use violence to gain advantage. </p>
<p><b>761. </b> The JIC judged that Muthanna and Dhi Qar provinces were “likely to remain mostly </p>
<p>stable”, with Muthanna “one of the most stable provinces in Iraq” where the Provincial </p>
<p>Reconstruction Team (PRT) was able to operate with little interference.</p>
<p><b>762. </b> In Dhi Qar, the JIC judged that JAM “secret cells” were becoming more active </p>
<p>and there were already some no&#8209;go areas for the ISF in JAM&#8209;controlled districts of the </p>
<p>provincial capital. Maysan was considered “more volatile” with “low level intra&#8209;Shia </p>
<p>violence … bubbling just under the surface”.</p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>763. </b> On 25 April, in a telegram which set the scene for Mr Browne’s visit to Iraq, </p>
<p>Mr Asquith said that it was hard to provide evidence of a significant improvement in the </p>
<p>security conditions in Baghdad as a result of Operation Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon: </p>
<p>“Targeted sectarian assassinations and Shia militia presence on the streets remain </p>
<p>at much reduced levels compared to January. But both continue to fluctuate. </p>
<p>Spectacular attacks are continuing to push up the casualty levels and play strongly </p>
<p>in the media. Al Qaida (AQ) are determined both to prove that they can still operate </p>
<p>… and to exacerbate sectarian violence. Shia retaliation has been contained, but the </p>
<p>dyke of self restraint will not hold forever. The full effect of FAQ [Fardh al&#8209;Qanoon] </p>
<p>still awaits full surge, expected by the end of June. Meanwhile, Shia and Sunni both </p>
<p>claim they are being targeted by Iraqi and coalition forces …</p>
<p>“In Basra, JAM are continuing to demonstrate their capability to attack us and take </p>
<p>our lives. But in reality they are primarily engaged in a messy internecine struggle … </p>
<p>This is about the politics of power pursued principally by criminality.”</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>764. </b> Mr Asquith also reported US activity to drive forward reconciliation:</p>
<p>“Gates’s message to the Iraqis during his recent visit was that the clock was ticking </p>
<p>for Iraqi delivery on reconciliation. Petraeus and Crocker have signed off on a </p>
<p>strategic assessment which … will form the basis of the new campaign plan in May. </p>
<p>It differs from previous plans in identifying political agreement between Iraqi leaders </p>
<p>as a precondition for delivering security …”</p>
<p><b>765. </b> Mr Robert Tinline, Deputy British Consul General in Basra, reported on 26 April that </p>
<p>the political struggle in Basra, and discussions over Governor Waili’s future, continued.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He explained:</p>
<p>“… Basra may be on the brink of a new accommodation between the principal </p>
<p>political blocs: Fadhila, SCIRI/Badr and OMS/JAM. It is hard to see a compromise </p>
<p>which protects everyone’s interests … We are staying in frequent touch with key </p>
<p>figures, reinforcing the need for a resolution through peaceful, constitutional means, </p>
<p>and the potential impact of widespread violence, not least on the transfer of security. </p>
<p>MND(SE) are continuing to make it clear to the relevant Iraqi security authorities that </p>
<p>it is up to them to take the lead in controlling the situation, but that they would be </p>
<p>able to act in support if requested.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>766. </b> On 27 April, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told him that April had seen the greatest </p>
<p>number of UK fatalities in Iraq (11)</p>
<p>420</p>
<p> since the end of major combat operations in </p>
<p>2003.</p>
<p>421</p>
<p> Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“I am really not happy about the posture of our Forces in Basra. We must discuss </p>
<p>this. There is absolutely no point in taking casualties if they aren’t helping the effort.”</p>
<p><b>767. </b> The Private Secretary also explained that he had commissioned further work from </p>
<p>departments on reconciliation. Mr Blair replied: “But the FCO and MOD won’t respond – </p>
<p>we will have to do it.”</p>
<p><b>768. </b> On 29 April, Lt Gen Lamb reported a resurgence of tribal influence in Iraq, with the </p>
<p>tribes seen as “an increasingly important coalescing force” who were “beginning to raise </p>
<p>their heads above the AQ parapet” and “playing an increasing role in the engagement </p>
<p>and reconciliation work”.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>769. </b> Lt Gen Lamb observed that “we are seeing increasing numbers of the Sunni in </p>
<p>particular trying to become part of the AQ&#8209;I solution” and that the “co&#8209;operation we are </p>
<p>receiving to assist in operations in the Ramadi/Fallujah/Abu Ghraib area is notable”. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki appeared “reasonably comfortable” with the tribal engagement </p>
<p>strategy and was continuing his own engagement efforts with Sunni interlocutors </p>
<p>in parallel. </p>
<p><b>770. </b> Lt Gen Lamb also recorded that eight new UK members of staff for the Joint </p>

<p>423</p>
<p> He explained </p>
<p>that there were currently two major strands of activity: Sunni insurgent cease&#8209;fire </p>
<p>negotiations and the initiative to co&#8209;opt Sunni tribes in Anbar province. </p>
<p><b>772. </b> On the first strand of activity, Mr Dowse reported that Lt Gen Lamb had been </p>
<p>continuing discussions with representatives of a small number of Sunni insurgents </p>
<p>to explore the possibility of local cease&#8209;fires with the MNF but commented that the </p>

<p>145</p>
<p><b>773. </b> On developments in Anbar, Mr Dowse explained that, since October 2006, Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki and the MNF had been backing an initiative where local armed tribal </p>
<p>groups were being allowed to assume local security responsibilities – including control </p>
<p>of police stations. Although it was far from finished, there were indications that AQ&#8209;I </p>
<p>was feeling the pressure in Anbar. The extent of popular support for the trial opposition </p>
<p>to AQ&#8209;I was difficult to gauge but Mr Dowse considered that the impact so far was </p>
<p>encouraging. </p>
<p><b>774. </b> Mr Dowse reminded Sir Nigel of the JIC’s judgement in February that the prospects </p>
<p>for Anbar would depend on the initiative gaining broader support among the Sunni </p>
<p>population. That would be difficult as long as rival groups were competing for local power </p>
<p>and influence. There was also a risk that, if they prevailed against AQ&#8209;I, the Sunni tribal </p>
<p>forces would redirect their energies against the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>775. </b> On 3 May, in response to a request from Sir Nigel, the Deputy Chief of the </p>
<p>Assessments Staff provided a minute on Lebanese Hizballah involvement in training </p>
<p>Shia groups in Iraq.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> It said: </p>
<p>“Lebanese Hizballah has well&#8209;established links to Shia groups in Iraq … </p>
<p>In May 2004 MNF first reported explosives technology exclusively associated </p>
<p>with Hizballah (EFPs: explosively formed projectiles) being used in Iraq. More </p>
<p>sophisticated EFPs (using passive infra&#8209;red initiators) appeared in December 2004.”</p>
<p><b>776. </b> The minute said that the arrangements put in place by Hizballah for training Iraqis </p>
<p>who wanted to attack the coalition were assessed to have been put in place at the </p>
<p>request of the Iranians. It continued:</p>
<p>“We assess that the main recipients of Hizballah training are Shia extremists (mainly </p>
<p>members of Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM) but also some from the Badr Organisation); </p>
<p>although … a small number of Iranian&#8209;backed Sunnis may also have been trained … </p>
<p>Skills include small&#8209;arms and explosives training and instruction in kidnapping, </p>
<p>assassination, surveillance and reconnaissance.”</p>
<p><b>777. </b> Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“But what are we doing about this? Why aren’t we raising it with Iran?”</p>
<p><b>778. </b> In early May, Ambassador Crocker visited Basra.</p>
<p>425</p>
<p> Mr Tinline reported to </p>
<p>Ms Aldred:</p>
<p>“Ambassador Crocker’s fleeting visit to the REO [US Regional Embassy Office] </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>during his tight visit meant that Crocker left without seeing the British team here. </p>
<p>His conclusion that Baghdad needs to pay more attention to Basra may yet help us </p>
<p>persuade Maliki to act. But his perceptions may make early handover a harder sell.”</p>
<p><b>779. </b> On 3 May, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>“The US may be becoming more concerned about our own plans for Basra … </p>
<p>The US will see the timing [leaving Basra Palace in August] as presentationally, </p>
<p>awkward, given Petraeus’s planned testimony in the Autumn. They may also have </p>
<p>concerns … about the level of criminality and the difficult political situation in Basra, </p>
<p>which they would argue should delay PIC. For us, the two key issues are firstly </p>
<p>the utility of what our military are doing in Basra; and secondly the need to free up </p>
<p>capacity to deploy additional troops in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>426</p>
<p><b>780. </b> On 3 May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald told Mr Blair that he had seen ACM Stirrup </p>
<p>“privately” and asked him, in light of the high April casualty figures and recent comments, </p>
<p>including by Maj Gen Shaw, whether he saw continuing military utility in the UK’s mission </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>427</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>781. </b> Sir Nigel informed Mr Blair that ACM Stirrup thought:</p>
<p>“We are getting ‘close to the end’, but Jock [Stirrup] thought that our presence would </p>
<p>continue to be militarily useful at least until PIC and the closure of Basra Palace. </p>
<p>Jock hopes that we will be able to keep to the present timetable – PIC in July and </p>
<p>BP [Basra Palace] closure in August. </p>
<p>“At that stage, we would come down from 5,500 to around 4,700. </p>
<p>“Jock saw the military utility resting on the continuing need to train the Iraqi </p>
<p>10th Division (he did not talk about the Police, and I think the MOD now regard them </p>
<p>as a busted flush), <b>anti&#8209;JAM operations</b> and capacity to <b>re&#8209;intervene</b>. </p>
<p>“Thereafter Jock thought that there would be at least a <b>couple of months</b> when we </p>
<p>could re&#8209;intervene effectively and continue to run anti&#8209;JAM … operations … [but] </p>
<p>once we vacate the Palace … we would … lose our … situational awareness.</p>
<p>“The autumn would therefore be the decisive period … </p>
<p>“If by late autumn the UK capacity to re&#8209;intervene and conduct … operations had </p>
<p>– as expected – degraded, there would be a residual training/mentoring role, but </p>
<p>that did not warrant maintaining the force in its present shape. Jock therefore saw </p>
<p>a <b>choice</b>, from around the turn of the year, between (a) a very rapid scaling down </p>
<p>from 4,700 to around 500 (essentially a small military training team) in one go and </p>
<p>(b) taking it in stages … to around 4,000 in the <b>first</b> instance and then a more </p>

<p>gradual tapering. Jock strongly favoured the first option, as once you begin this sort </p>
<p>of process, our forces become vulnerable and it is best to get on with things as fast </p>
<p>as possible.”</p>
<p><b>782. </b> Sir Nigel commented to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“This will obviously need to be debated and tweaked a good deal, but I found the </p>
<p>overall thesis persuasive. It would be virtually impossible for UK Ministers to ask </p>
<p>the Army to stay in significant numbers in Basra if the advice from the Chiefs is that </p>
<p>there is no militarily useful mission to conduct – the risks are just too high … The key </p>
<p>issue remains the likely <b>US reaction</b> to this plan. I suspect that they will want Basra </p>
<p>PIC to be delayed from July to the autumn …</p>
<p>“You will need to chair a meeting of DOP in June which would finally confirm the </p>
<p>closing of <b>Basra Palace</b> in August (which would need to be announced in July); </p>
<p>discuss the timing of <b>PIC</b>; and could look ahead in general terms to the rest of the </p>
<p>year. But it would be too early in June to make any firm judgments, still less any </p>
<p>decisions about our long term intentions.”</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>783. </b> Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“I entirely understand it in military terms, but in terms of what happens in Basra, it </p>
<p>will be very hard to present as anything other than a total withdrawal. This can work </p>
<p>if Basra’s politics are sorted in the meantime but otherwise it cd be very dangerous </p>
<p>for the stability of Iraq, &amp; the US will, rightly, be v. concerned.”</p>
<p>429</p>
<p><b>784. </b> Mr Browne told Cabinet on 3 May that the “emerging political vacuum” threatened </p>
<p>to undermine UK efforts and the gains made by Op SINBAD in Basra.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> The Governor </p>
<p>of Basra was assailed on all sides and was ineffective. The militias were vying for </p>
<p>political power and, although the MNF had the capacity to tackle them, doing so raised </p>
<p>the threat level to UK forces deployed there: 90 percent of attacks were now directed </p>
<p>against the MNF. </p>
<p><b>785. </b> Outside Basra, Mr Browne said that the security situation was more complex: </p>
<p>terrorism was fuelling sectarian violence. The Baghdad Security Plan was reducing </p>
<p>violence but could not stop the “spectacular” attacks, coverage of which masked more </p>
<p>positive developments. In Anbar province the tribal leaders were taking the lead in </p>
<p>driving Al Qaida out. </p>
<p><b>786. </b> The Shia “remained a significant problem” and were reluctant to let go of their </p>
<p>monopoly on power for fear of further subjugation. Mr Browne judged that there was </p>
<p>“a closing window for bringing the Shia round”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>787. </b> Both Mr Browne and Mr Blair said that reconciliation was the key to success; </p>
<p>the Shia had to be made to understand that the UK’s support was conditional on a </p>
<p>non&#8209;sectarian future. Mr Blair also briefed Cabinet that British thinking on reconciliation </p>
<p>had had “a great impact” on the US. </p>
<p><b>788. </b> On 3 May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Sir David Manning a “strictly personal” copy </p>
<p>of a Note from Mr Blair to President Bush setting out his proposals for future coalition </p>
<p>strategy, written in preparation for a video conference the next day.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>789. </b> In his Note, Mr Blair characterised the position as:</p>
<p>“Everywhere in the region at present, we are pinned back. We remain strong. </p>
<p>We are not losing. But we are not really able to move forward.”</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Mr Blair argued that Islamist extremists had a “coherent political strategy” for Iraq </p>
<p>whereas “our problem is that we don’t”. He considered himself and President Bush to be </p>
<p>“lone voices”, with new politicians keen to distance themselves from past events. As a </p>
<p>result:</p>
<p>“People start to think this is a fight we can’t win; when in reality it is a fight we have </p>
<p>to win.”</p>
<p><b>791. </b> Despite military successes, Mr Blair wrote that progress was always fragile in the </p>
<p>absence of a big political deal:</p>
<p>“For example, in Iraq, we fight on three fronts: the Sunni insurgency; Al Qaida; </p>
<p>Iranian&#8209;based Shia militia. I asked our top people the other day: if you took Al Qaida </p>
<p>and Iran out of the situation, ie the external extremists, would Iraq be manageable? </p>
<p>Undoubtedly, they said … But whilst we fight on all three fronts, the Sunni insurgents </p>
<p>provide a justification for Shia death squads, and reinforce the Iraqi Government’s </p>
<p>fears of a Ba’athist return; Al Qaida can claim to be counter&#8209;attacking the Shia; and </p>
<p>everyone, of course, can blame it on us.”</p>
<p><b>792. </b> In the absence of a “big political strategy for the region”, Mr Blair wrote that the </p>
<p>news was simply dominated by television pictures of “carnage”. In response, Mr Blair </p>
<p>saw a need “radically to upgrade our political approach across the region”, changing the </p>
<p>terms of the debate from “whether we can win”, to an “insistence we have to win”.</p>
<p><b>793. </b> Mr Blair wrote that a new political strategy should have three components; </p>
<p>reconciliation, exposing Iranian support for terrorism whilst offering a chance to alter </p>
<p>and improve the relationship and making progress with the Middle East Peace Process. </p>
<p>On reconciliation, Mr Blair commented that “The missing part is the politics” and that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government “can’t succeed and won’t survive without it”. </p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>794. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… Iraq has to be bigger than just Iraq. It has to be part of a more profound and </p>
<p>wider picture. People have to see it as a frontier in a battle across the region and the </p>
<p>world. That is a battle, as you always rightly say, between freedom and extremism, </p>
<p>democracy and terror. But we have to get back onto the front foot politically. I am </p>
<p>absolutely confident it can be done. Even after I go, which will be soon now, I will </p>
<p>help in any way I can.”</p>
<p><b>795. </b> On 3 May, members of the international community gathered in Sharm el&#8209;Sheikh, </p>
<p>Egypt to launch the International Compact with Iraq.</p>
<p>432</p>
<p> It was formally launched by </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki and UN Secretary&#8209;General Ban Ki&#8209;moon. The UN described the </p>
<p>Compact as:</p>
<p>“… a five&#8209;year national plan that includes benchmarks and mutual commitments </p>
<p>from both Iraq and the international community, all with the aim of helping Iraq on the </p>
<p>path towards peace, sound governance and economic reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>796. </b> Mr Asquith judged that the Iraqi Government would be seeking “headline&#8209;catching </p>
<p>support and commitment, notably in terms of debt relief from the Saudis and others” and </p>
<p>that a poor response “could undermine the willingness of line Ministries in Iraq to take </p>
<p>the Compact seriously and therefore to undertake the reforms that it entails”.</p>
<p>433</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>797. </b> Mr Asquith proposed that Mrs Beckett, who led the UK delegation, should </p>
<p>“encourage Maliki to develop a mechanism for engaging directly with his Arab </p>
<p>neighbours (eg a personal envoy) and to establish the working groups agreed at the </p>
<p>meeting in Baghdad on 10 March”.</p>
<p><b>798. </b> The launch was followed by a Neighbours Conference on 4 May.</p>
<p><b>799. </b> Sir David Manning reported US reactions to the meetings on 4 May. His contacts in </p>
<p>the State Department and National Security Council considered that “the fact that there </p>
<p>had been no big surprises was itself considered a success”.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> Now that the Compact </p>
<p>had been formally launched:</p>
<p>“… the focus was now on substance: exploiting the Compact’s reform road&#8209;map and </p>
<p>shifting the dynamic between Iraq and its neighbours. It was not clear the Sharm </p>
<p>meetings had marked any real progress on the latter …”</p>
<p><b>800. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 4 May.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>Plan, and from activity with Sunni groups in Anbar and elsewhere, enhanced effort was </p>
<p>needed on the political agenda and in particular on reconciliation. A high&#8209;profile ‘grand </p>
<p>bargain’ was needed to provide a framework for work like that under way in Anbar.</p>
<p><b>801. </b> Mr Blair considered that a longer&#8209;term military commitment in support of Iraq, on </p>
<p>a different basis, was needed and should be framed as conditional upon progress with </p>
<p>reconciliation.</p>
<p><b>802. </b> Mr Browne wrote to Mr Blair on 5 May with his assessment of the prospects for </p>
<p>successful reconciliation in Iraq, based on a visit to Basra and Baghdad earlier the same </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> He reported:</p>
<p>“Baghdad reinforced my belief that political discord is adding to the effects of terrorist </p>
<p>tactics in fuelling sectarian strife.”</p>
<p><b>803. </b> Mr Browne wrote that, even though there was no agreed concept of reconciliation, </p>
<p>a package was “deliverable”. Work started from a “poor position” but it had US support. </p>
<p>A realistic outcome would be to:</p>
<p>“… reduce the irreconcilable elements but in the end there will still be a significant </p>
<p>terrorist threat beyond the reach of the Iraqi state system in the short and medium </p>
<p>term.”</p>
<p><b>804. </b> Mr Browne considered that a visit by Mr Blair to Iraq, planned for later in the month, </p>
<p>would be “an excellent opportunity to formalise a route to reconciliation”. Mr Browne </p>
<p>suggested that might mean:</p>
<p>“A joint UK/Iraqi PM and Iraqi Presidential statement; a clear public commitment </p>
<p>from senior members of the GOI [Government of Iraq]; a meeting with a member </p>
<p>of the Majar; and perhaps the launch of a suitable international commission of </p>
<p>advisers.”</p>
<p><b>805. </b> Mr Blair spoke to Prime Minister Maliki on 7 May, and congratulated him on the </p>
<p>outcome of the International Compact meeting.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> They discussed the security situation </p>
<p>in Baghdad and Basra and the importance of MNF&#8209;I co&#8209;operation with local political and </p>
<p>security institutions. </p>
<p><b>806. </b> Alluding to the continuing difficulties in Basra, Mr Blair noted the difficulty in trying </p>
<p>to establish which political forces were the appropriate ones to work with – Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki said that he was not asking UK forces to deal with militias, but with </p>
<p>politicians who had an influence on those militias, as the Iraqi Government did.</p>
<p><b>807. </b> On 9 May, Mr Asquith reported: “The Political logjam looks as if it might be </p>
<p>breaking up.”</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> It appeared that the political parties were on the verge of a deal that </p>

<p>and a more effective division of responsibilities at the heart of government. Mr Asquith </p>
<p>commented that the UK should seek to encourage former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi </p>
<p>to support the deal and to work constructively with Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p><b>808. </b> DOP(I) met on 10 May, chaired by Mrs Beckett.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> Four papers were provided for </p>
<p>the meeting:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Browne’s letter to Mr Blair of 5 May, setting out his views on reconciliation.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A minute from Mrs Beckett to Mr Browne following her attendance at the Sharm </p>
<p>el&#8209;Sheikh meeting, containing her views on reconciliation.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Two very similar papers produced jointly by the FCO and MOD entitled ‘Iraq: </p>
<p>After UNSCR 1723’ and ‘Iraq: MNF&#8209;I Mandate in 2008’ prompted by the </p>
<p>imminent review of resolution 1723.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>809. </b> In her minute, Mrs Beckett said that the fact that the meetings in Sharm el&#8209;Sheikh </p>
<p>took place was proof that headway was being made on reconciliation.</p>
<p>443</p>
<p> But she warned:</p>
<p>“If Sunni Arab governments do not help Maliki to make early progress [on] </p>
<p>reconciliation, I am convinced that they will get what they most fear – an avowedly </p>
<p>pro&#8209;Iranian (ie SCIRI) government in Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>810. </b> In private, she reported that the other participants in the conference had been </p>
<p>downbeat:</p>
<p>“While none disputed the central importance of reconciliation, they were negative </p>
<p>in their assessment of the Government of Iraq’s ability to deliver and guarded about </p>
<p>their own willingness to help.”</p>
<p><b>811. </b> The FCO and MOD papers, which considered the mandate for coalition forces </p>
<p>in Iraq, both recommended that the UK should press for a further resolution to extend </p>
<p>authorisation for the MNF to be present in Iraq, to continue to intern individuals for </p>
<p>security reasons and to take “<b>all necessary measures”</b> to implement their mandate.</p>
<p>444</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>812. </b> The MOD and FCO judged that, despite the fact the Prime Minister Maliki was </p>
<p>under pressure to demonstrate Iraqi sovereignty, he would want coalition troops </p>
<p>to remain into 2008 because of the Sunni insurgency and levels of ISF capability. </p>
<p>Challenges in achieving Security Council agreement were likely to come from the French </p>
<p>and Russians, both of whom had called for a clear timetable for withdrawal. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>813. </b> In the absence of a further resolution, the MOD and FCO considered that it would </p>
<p>be necessary to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding or a Status of Forces </p>
<p>Agreement (SOFA) with the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p><b>814. </b> The MOD and FCO thought it possible that the Iraqi Government might write into </p>
<p>a new Security Council resolution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment to complete PIC transfer by a given date;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more formal Rules of Engagement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a timetable for withdrawal;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a commitment that this would be the last resolution of its kind; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>removal of powers to intern. </p>
<p><b>815. </b> The MOD and FCO judged internment to “make an important contribution to </p>
<p>force protection”. If removed, individuals would have to be released or, in the case of </p>
<p>the 30 percent of detainees where there was a criminal case to answer, handed to the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>816. </b> During the DOP(I) meeting, the point was made that Mr Blair’s forthcoming visit to </p>
<p>Iraq would offer an opportunity to push for reconciliation, and that the UK and US should </p>
<p>stress to the Iraqi Government that continued support and money was conditional on </p>
<p>seeing demonstrable progress.</p>
<p>445</p>
<p> An unnamed attendee highlighted the importance of </p>
<p>“resolving the detainee situation” since 90 percent of detainees were Sunni. </p>
<p><b>817. </b> Ministers agreed to aim for a renewal of resolution 1723 in 2008 and to share the </p>
<p>paper ‘Iraq: MNF&#8209;I Mandate in 2008’ with the US. </p>
<p><b>818. </b> Reporting on the situation in Basra, Mr Browne said that 80 percent of the violence </p>
<p>there was directed against coalition forces, but that was a manifestation of the political </p>
<p>struggles going on beneath the surface. The JAM militia represented a strong political </p>
<p>force and there was evidence that some of their attacks against UK forces were being </p>
<p>funded by the Iranians. Indirect fire attacks on Basra Air Station remained a serious </p>
<p>problem; the US military had lent the UK some Apache attack helicopters which were </p>
<p>proving useful.</p>
<p><b>819. </b> Mrs Beckett told Cabinet on 10 May that the outcome of the Sharm el&#8209;Sheikh </p>
<p>meeting had been “generally positive”.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p> It had been a useful demonstration of </p>
<p>international engagement, but in private many had been negative about the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government. </p>

<p>448</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>821. </b> Resolving the impasse would be important if transition to PIC was to be achieved </p>
<p>in Basra in the planned timetable. Maj Gen Shaw commented: </p>
<p>“Ambassador Crocker’s comments post his visit to Basra Palace do not seem to </p>
<p>reflect the reality of the situation here. His assertions to the Secretary of State that </p>
<p>he had been struck by the seriousness of the security situation and that PIC in Basra </p>
<p>under the current climate would be difficult would appear to have more to do with </p>
<p>US aspirations to tie us to remaining in Iraq than they do with objective assessment. </p>
<p>I was heartened, however, by the Secretary of State [for Defence]’s robust response </p>
<p>that August was an important month for UK and we could not take decisions on Iraq </p>
<p>in isolation from Afghanistan …</p>
<p>“Ambassador Crocker’s comments about the Port (that Iraq’s politicians allowed it </p>
<p>to be run by the militias) would also appear to have caused a flurry in Baghdad … </p>
<p>What is also depressing is the prospect of military intervention at the Port; this may </p>
<p>be corrupt, but is also stable and functions. Upsetting the balance of power would </p>
<p>not advance stability in Basra by a single step and would not be the best use of Iraqi </p>

<p><b>823. </b> Mr Blair commented that one of the lessons that had been learned in Northern </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>824. </b> In his weekly update on 11 May, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“The big issue of the moment – rightly – is reconciliation. At Sharm, Maliki got the </p>
<p>message from all present that this should be his priority, and the US have been </p>
<p>using every tool at their disposal to reinforce the message.”</p>
<p>450</p>
<p><b>825. </b> The Private Secretary attached a copy of a speech given by Mr Browne the </p>
<p>previous week, which included proposals relevant to Mr Blair’s planned visit to Iraq. </p>
<p>In it, Mr Browne asked whether military intervention was working in Iraq and concluded </p>
<p>“As ever, the difficulties are with the politics”. He continued:</p>
<p>“Delivering on reconciliation is simple in concept but will be extremely difficult to </p>
<p>deliver where there is little cohesion between factions – who on the Sunni side can </p>
<p>deliver the people? Who on the Shia side commands enough support to make the </p>
<p>compromises?”</p>
<p><b>826. </b> The IPU produced a revised reconciliation strategy on 11 May.</p>
<p>451</p>
<p> Its overall aim </p>
<p>was to build mutual confidence and trust between Sunni Arabs and Shia. The detailed </p>
<p>objectives were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more inclusive government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>widening political representation and participation; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>progress in reducing the numbers excluded by de&#8209;Ba’athification;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>progress on agreeing hydrocarbons legislation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>changing the regional context; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a more strategic approach to reconciliation both by the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>by the coalition. </p>
<p><b>827. </b> The IPU also highlighted a “pressing need for action” on the issue of detainees, </p>
<p>possibly by offering an amnesty. </p>
<p><b>828. </b> Mr Blair commented: </p>
<p>“This is a much better paper. But the key missing element remains. Neither the </p>
<p>process nor the individual items of attainment/goals of reconciliation are achievable </p>
<p>unless set out in a proper agreement to which everyone – Iraqi Gov[ernmen]t, Iraqi </p>
<p>factions, clerics, US, UK, MNF and Arabs – sign up.”</p>
<p><b>829. </b> On 13 May, Lt Gen Lamb reported that “significant progress” continued to be made </p>

<p>“… my sense is that the Prime Minister [Maliki] and the Iraqi Government Ministers, </p>
<p>while continuing to listen to advice, are less inclined to be dictated to by what we the </p>
<p>coalition want. Our contributions to the debate are embraced when they coincide </p>
<p>with what they, the Iraqis, have in mind, whilst if our advice challenges what they </p>
<p>have in mind (and is probably therefore not shared with us) then it becomes a much </p>
<p>more difficult issue to push through. To some extent it was ever thus, but 2007 is </p>
<p>becoming a year of hard bargaining and tense negotiation, albeit more in a spirit of </p>
<p>partnership than the one&#8209;sided (US) affair it was in 2006.”</p>
<p><b>831. </b> On reconciliation and outreach, Lt Gen Lamb reported that the newly enlarged </p>
<p>Engagement Cell was being much appreciated by the US and that “another small UK </p>
<p>inspired piece of thinking and work application” was emerging in the form of the “Energy </p>
<p>Fusion Cell”, aimed at co&#8209;ordinating the various Iraqi ministries responsible for energy.</p>
<p><b>832. </b> On 14 May, a letter on JAM and the prospects for outreach was provided to </p>
<p>Mr Dowse at his request.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> It stated:</p>
<p>“Despite the ability to mobilise mass demonstrations … JAM and OMS are in </p>
<p>disarray, with no unified political or military leadership. This has been exacerbated </p>
<p>by Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr’s extended stay in Iran and the arrest of al&#8209;Khaz’ali … But the </p>
<p>divisions already existed.”</p>
<p><b>833. </b> The letter said that JAM activities fell into four categories, all of which were </p>
<p>overwritten by complex regional and tribal allegiances between individuals:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iranian&#8209;sponsored secret cells;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the mainstream organisation of OMS and JAM;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>criminal elements in Sadr City; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the demonstrators and occasional fighters who respond on an emotional level </p>
<p>to the JAM call to arms.</p>
<p><b>834. </b> As a result, “no one figure, including probably Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr himself, is capable </p>
<p>of delivering JAM as a movement but a range of people have influence over parts of </p>
<p>JAM”. The letter continued:</p>
<p>“In Baghdad in recent weeks, JAM militiamen have begun to reappear on the </p>
<p>streets but apparently remain under orders (it is not clear whose) not to engage in </p>
<p>attacks … In Basra JAM command and control is also unclear but the result is the </p>
<p>opposite to the relative lull in Baghdad … Some senior members of the Sadr trend </p>

<p>“As with the Sunni insurgency, it seems we will have to engage the movement </p>

<p><b>835. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Iraq between 13 and 16 May.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> He was reported to have </p>
<p>sensed:</p>
<p>“… that the Iraqis are increasingly in a position to take on responsibility for their own </p>
<p>problems and therefore they might wish to look to propose the south of the country </p>
<p>as a model through which we can recommend a drawdown of forces.”</p>
<p><b>836. </b> During the visit, Lt Gen Lamb told ACM Stirrup that he “saw increasing signs from </p>
<p>MAS/JAM that they could be closer to a non violent approach and some moderation of </p>
<p>a significant proportion of their number”. </p>
<p><b>837. </b> Mr Asquith told ACM Stirrup when they met in Baghdad that he was concerned </p>
<p>that the campaign plan was “hung up on sectarianism”. This meant that “we should </p>
<p>be careful to demonstrate a degree of humility when dealing with these sensitive </p>
<p>issues” in discussion with Iraqi politicians. There was an underlying fear of a return </p>
<p>to Ba’athification in the minds of the Shia politicians and that affected much of their </p>
<p>thinking. Mr Asquith suggested that perhaps there was a need for an “outside figure </p>
<p>to help deliver something meaningful on reconciliation”. </p>
<p><b>838. </b> On 16 May, at the request of the FCO, the JIC assessed the effectiveness of the </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>839. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“I. … Violence continues to rise, distrust is deepening between and within </p>
<p>increasingly sectarian communities, and government capacity remains weak. </p>
<p>There has been no tangible progress on national reconciliation.”</p>
<p><b>840. </b> Poor security, especially in Baghdad and central Iraq, was judged to have deterred </p>
<p>political reconciliation and prevented economic reconstruction, although “most of the </p>

<p>had been improved with the help of local forces:</p>
<p>“But the national monthly average of recorded attacks is 50 percent higher now than </p>
<p>a year ago. There is a strong possibility that Shia frustrations will lead to increased </p>
<p>sectarian violence.”</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Faction&#8209;based sectarian politics was judged to be hampering the Government’s </p>
<p>ability to function effectively:</p>
<p>“Recent diplomatic reporting indicated that there are plans to improve government </p>
<p>policy co&#8209;ordination, but we judge that major improvements in performance are </p>
<p>unlikely in the foreseeable future: many departments lack basic bureaucratic </p>
<p>and administrative skills. Corruption remains endemic and is not being tackled </p>
<p>effectively.”</p>
<p><b>842. </b> On 17 May, at the request of the Cabinet Office, the JIC reviewed the threat to the </p>
<p>UK posed by international terrorism over the next five years.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p><b>843. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“International terrorism will remain dominated by Al Qaida (AQ) and related Sunni </p>
<p>Islamist extremists. There will be more attacks in the UK and on UK interests </p>
<p>overseas … </p>
<p>“AQ’s senior leaders … can … communicate with affiliated networks in places like … </p>
<p>Iraq … </p>
<p>“AQ will remain flexible in seeking to create or exploit un&#8209;governed spaces wherever </p>
<p>it can. Iraq and increasingly Afghanistan will remain key strategic theatres. If AQ </p>
<p>establishes a firm base in either country, it will train and radicalise a large number of </p>
<p>terrorists and launch attacks regionally and beyond.”</p>
<p><b>844. </b> In his weekly report on 17 May Mr Asquith reported that Prime Minister Maliki was </p>
<p>facing a number of political challenges:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Threats that Sunni politicians would pull out of government if their demands </p>
<p>in the Constitutional Review Committee (CRC) were not met. The key issues </p>
<p>were the redistribution of powers between the centre and regions/governorates, </p>
<p>fair distribution of revenues and a revision of Article 140 on Kirkuk, plus some </p>
<p>movement on de&#8209;Ba’athification.</p>

<p>458</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“The constitutional review does provide an opportunity to be a building block </p>
<p>towards reconciliation by facilitating agreement on some key issues. Establishing </p>
<p>federal paramountcy over oil would increase the value and durability of any </p>
<p>compromise reached in the Hydrocarbons Law and would … address some of the </p>
<p>Sunni insecurities … But although the CRC may appear to be within reach of a </p>
<p>tentative agreement on some of the critical issues, it is not clear that they have the </p>
<p>endorsement of the political leadership, in particular the KRG [Kurdish Regional </p>
<p>Government] to approve the necessary changes.”</p>
<p><b>846. </b> In his weekly report on 17 May, Maj Gen Shaw reported:</p>
<p>“… across the three Provinces [in MND(SE)] under Provincial Iraqi Control we now </p>
<p>lack the situational awareness to truly determine what is happening on a day&#8209;to&#8209;day </p>
<p>basis.”</p>
<p>459</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Maj Gen Shaw described the impact of continuing indirect fire attacks:</p>
<p>“The frequency of attacks does of course have its own grinding effect on morale. </p>
<p>Our greatest risk in this respect is if contractors elect to remove their personnel; </p>
<p>their departure would leave us without critical life support. At present, and despite </p>
<p>a number of individuals choosing to leave in April, contractor support remains firm. </p>
<p>However, thinking ahead, should at any stage FCO, DFID or MOD decide to remove </p>
<p>its Civil Service Personnel from theatre, the IO [information operations] message </p>

<p> A steering brief for the visit </p>
<p>explained that:</p>
<p>“President Bush is under heavy domestic pressure on Iraq from all sides: not just </p>
<p>the Democrats and the American public but also increasingly from within his own </p>
<p>party. If significant, demonstrable progress has not been made in Iraq by September, </p>
<p>the US Administration will find it hard to sustain support in Congress. So he is likely </p>
<p>to welcome reassurance of continuing British commitment to Iraq and to sensitive </p>

<p><b>851. </b> Mr Blair underlined the importance of the Sunni and Shia coming together as </p>
<p>part of a political process to focus on the true causes of the violence in Iraq, Al Qaida </p>
<p>and Iran. </p>
<p><b>852. </b> Mr Blair concluded that, by September, it would be important for the coalition </p>
<p>to have given the Iraqis a strong sense that everything possible was being done on </p>
<p>security and on reconciliation. It was imperative that people understood that the drivers </p>
<p>of violence in Iraq were the same as for the fight against terrorism and that: “If we could </p>
<p>deal them a blow in Iraq, it would have a wider impact on the fight.” </p>
<p><b>853. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary reported to Mrs Beckett’s Private Secretary that:</p>
<p>“Based on the VTC, the Prime Minister is strengthened in his view that the UK needs </p>
<p>to make a concerted push on reconciliation working with the US. He would like a </p>
<p>senior British official to be in charge of this who would work closely with the US, and </p>
<p>who could be available to undertake dialogue in Iraq and the region.”</p>
<p><b>854. </b> The FCO was tasked to produce some thoughts on that by 25 May. </p>
<p><b>US funding for Iraq</b></p>

<p>On 11 May, the House of Representatives passed a further Bill which would release </p>
<p>US$43bn immediately and a further US$53bn after July, subject to a demonstration that </p>
<p>progress had been made.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p>A compromise Bill was approved by Congress on 24 May.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> This guaranteed US$120bn </p>
<p>funding and did not include a timetable for withdrawal of US troops from Iraq but set </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>President Bush was asked to submit two reports to Congress – by mid&#8209;July and by </p>
<p>mid&#8209;September – demonstrating progress against each of the benchmarks.</p>
<p><b>855. </b> Mr Blair visited Baghdad and Basra on 19 May.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> His Private Secretary reported </p>
<p>that he had meetings with Prime Minister Maliki, President Talabani and senior UK and </p>
<p>US military and civilian teams. </p>
<p><b>856. </b> Mr Blair discussed reconciliation with Prime Minister Maliki, and the criticism of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government by foreign officials for its work against Ba’athists. Mr Blair observed:</p>
<p>“… that leadership presented many challenges, not least having to deal with criticism </p>
<p>from all sides even when one was pursuing the right policy.”</p>
<p><b>857. </b> In the briefing with US and UK senior teams in Baghdad, Mr Blair set out the case </p>
<p>for “a political initiative which would provide a framework for and a context to security </p>
<p>work under way in Baghdad and Anbar”. He agreed with Ambassador Crocker and </p>
<p>Mr Asquith that a statement of intent would not be enough; there must be a plan. </p>
<p><b>858. </b> In Mr Blair’s Basra briefing, Maj Gen Shaw noted that most of the violence was </p>
<p>directed at the MNF; only time would tell whether the intra&#8209;Shia factional violence would </p>
<p>increase as UK forces drew down. Following PIC, the ability of UK forces to intervene, </p>
<p>including in strike operations against JAM and others, would gradually diminish, </p>
<p>but it would still be both necessary and possible to retain a residual training and </p>
<p>mentoring role.</p>
<p><b>859. </b> Commenting on the Prime Minister’s visit in his weekly report, Maj Gen Shaw </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“… the visit of the Prime Minister this week went well from the Division’s point of </p>
<p>view but less well, I suspect, from the overall Campaign IO [information operations] </p>
<p>perspective. The IDF attack during my brief to him was the story, described by the </p>
<p><i>Sunday People</i> as an AQ&#8209;inspired assassination attempt, an idiocy repeated by </p>
<p>Sky TV … IO is now the campaign main effort; it is not what we do between now and </p>
<p>departure, it is how our actions and departure are perceived. If we are to stand any </p>
<p>chance of leaving here with any national pride in our achievements, then we need </p>
<p>to address the domestic media judgement that this is a lost cause during, and out </p>
<p>of, which no good has come, and their practice of looking (and inevitably finding) </p>
<p>evidence to back up their prior editorial judgement.”</p>

<p>than the other way round. What was needed was a new political vision and compact, </p>
<p>reaffirmed by the political leaders in Iraq, with coalition involvement. The key elements </p>
<p>for a new political deal would be: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Hydrocarbons Law;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>holding early provincial elections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a deal with insurgents, as in Anbar; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new political platform agreed jointly by the Sunnis, Shia and Kurds in </p>
<p>government.</p>
<p><b>861. </b> Mr Blair said that the only way to tie Prime Minister Maliki into such a deal would </p>
<p>be to use the leverage provided by his desire that US forces should not leave. </p>
<p><b>862. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s record of the conversation was sent only to staff in No.10. </p>
<p>It ended: “The Prime Minister did not want this conversation reported widely.” Sir Nigel </p>
<p>therefore suggested that Mr Blair’s Private Secretary reported in his formal record of the </p>
<p>discussion that Mr Blair had followed up with President Bush on 20 May and that further </p>
<p>discussion of the political initiative was expected.</p>
<p><b>863. </b> Sir Nigel later added that Mr Blair had promised President Bush a short note on </p>
<p>the elements of his proposed political/reconciliation initiative, which Mr Blair’s Private </p>

<p>work that UK troops were doing in Iraq and that, in his discussions with the troops, he </p>
<p>had found morale and determination high. </p>
<p><b>865. </b> Gen Dannatt observed that the underlying dynamic in Basra was intra&#8209;Shia </p>
<p>competition motivated by financial gain, and “that, although there would remain </p>
<p>an important training and mentoring role in Iraq, there was a robust case for the </p>
<p>redeployment of forces to Afghanistan in the medium term”. Mr Blair agreed that UK </p>
<p>troops should remain in Iraq only so long as there was real utility in their doing so, </p>
<p>though he observed that it was important to be “very careful about potentially leaving, </p>
<p>or appearing to leave, the field open to the Iranians”. </p>
<p><b>866. </b> Gen Dannatt agreed it was important to ensure that the British Army came out </p>
<p>of Iraq with its reputation intact, which would require “a perception of strategic success </p>
<p>in the South”.</p>

<p><b>867. </b> On 23 May, Mr Asquith met Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker to “talk </p>
<p>through how we might achieve the ‘political decision’ which the Prime Minister was </p>
<p>pressing for”.</p>
<p>471</p>
<p> Neither of his US interlocutors thought this was likely to be possible: </p>
<p>“… while they accepted the desirability (and eventual requirement for) a political </p>
<p>decision, it was unachievable in the timeframe before September [when </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker were due to report to Congress on </p>
<p>progress in Iraq]; chasing it would at best sidetrack effort better put to achieving the </p>
<p>achievable, at worst would erect obstacles to the achievement of the achievable.”</p>
<p><b>868. </b> Mr Asquith commented that this had been:</p>
<p>“A useful, if deeply depressing, confirmation of the limited ambitions which the </p>
<p>US has set itself and the extent to which September has affected the American </p>
<p>approach to the agenda. Unless the PM can move Bush … we are in the business of </p>
<p>managing the political process between now and September. We can dress this up </p>
<p>as reconciliation for public consumption, and doubtless there will be the occasional </p>
<p>clerical or ‘comprehensive’ conference to pretend something is happening, but I see </p>
<p>no scope for tackling the root problem until … September.” </p>
<p><b>869. </b> The same day, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary provided him with a draft Note to send </p>
<p>to President Bush on reconciliation.</p>
<p>472</p>
<p> He explained that Mr Asquith had already trailed </p>
<p>these ideas with Ambassador Crocker and Gen Petraeus but without success. There is </p>
<p>no record that Mr Blair sent the Note to President Bush.</p>
<p><b>870. </b> In his weekly update of 24 May, Maj Gen Shaw assessed that “the seesaw struggle </p>
<p>with JAM continues, with events tipping in their favour this week”.</p>
<p>473</p>
<p> He observed that </p>
<p>the arrest of Aws Khafaji, believed to be a senior member of JAM, was likely to have an </p>
<p>impact on the level of incoming fire. </p>
<p><b>871. </b> On 24 May, Mr Blair reported to Cabinet on his recent visit to Iraq. He said </p>
<p>that “there were some prospects for hope”; some Sunni tribes had started to reach </p>
<p>accommodations with US forces and violence had reduced, for example in Anbar. </p>
<p>But the question remained whether an accommodation could be reached with the </p>
<p>Iraqi government. He attributed continued violence in Basra “almost entirely” to </p>
<p>Iranian&#8209;backed Shia cells. Mr Blair concluded that “there was still undoubtedly a very </p>

<p>well” and the rate of sectarian murders was down. Significant Sunni forces appeared </p>
<p>to be emerging in Anbar and elsewhere; that could be a positive development but </p>
<p>there was a danger that without effective reconciliation they could turn against the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government. </p>
<p><b>873. </b> On Basra, ACM Stirrup observed that economic progress would address some of </p>
<p>the violence by reducing the number of unemployed young men. Officials noted that the </p>
<p>Basra economy was largely based on criminality, but work was in hand to try to stimulate </p>
<p>investment and sensible planning for economic development. </p>
<p><b>874. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the UK’s objective should be “early Provincial elections, </p>
<p>leading to a political setup in Basra with which we could work, and which provided a </p>
<p>more effective link between Basra and Bagdad”. He commissioned papers from the </p>
<p>FCO on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the state of politics in Basra, and how best to ensure effective investment and </p>
<p>development there; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the political, security and economic situation in those provinces which had </p>
<p>already made the transition to Iraqi control; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the situation in outlying areas of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>875. </b> Late on the evening of 24 May, Sir Nigel Sheinwald spoke to Mr Hadley.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Hadley said that recent discussion of a reduction to 4,500 UK troops in Basra had </p>
<p>caused “considerable discomfort” to Gen Petraeus and others. They were concerned </p>
<p>that it sent “conflicting signals” to “the Iraqis and international opinion” and would </p>
<p>demoralise coalition partners, leading them to reduce their numbers. </p>
<p><b>876. </b> Sir Nigel explained that the change in troop numbers was part of the </p>
<p>announcement made in February, and “it made no sense to delay it further”. Mr Hadley </p>
<p>asked for Gen Lamb to “talk this through urgently with General Petraeus in order to </p>
<p>get a better understanding on the ground”. He added “the later we could leave it for </p>
<p>an announcement, the better”. </p>
<p><b>877. </b> Sir Nigel considered that such an intervention by Mr Hadley was relatively rare, </p>
<p>and surmised that the issue may well have been raised at a US Principals’ meeting. </p>
<p>He asked Lt Gen Lamb to “go over this again” with Gen Petraeus and report back:</p>
<p>“We can then decide what further action to take on the political and military nets </p>
<p>to get the necessary level of American buy&#8209;in.” </p>
<p><b>878. </b> The day after the meeting, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary provided his weekly Iraq </p>

<p>164</p>
<p><b>879. </b> Mr Jones’ weekly report on Basra, which was attached to the update, said that </p>
<p>there had been 17 attacks on Basra Air Station in the past week, and high levels of </p>
<p>indirect fire.</p>
<p>478</p>
<p> An explosion at a Sunni mosque and attack on the headquarters of a </p>
<p>Sunni political party had also “fuelled concern within the nervous Sunni community”. </p>
<p>Mr Jones added that:</p>
<p>“All of our contacts speak of a deterioration in the security situation more generally, </p>
<p>and an undertow of increasing assassinations and kidnappings.”</p>
<p><b>880. </b> Mr Blair commented: “Why has Basra’s security suddenly turned bad? And what </p>
<p>can be done about it?”</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>881. </b> On 28 May, Lt Gen Lamb reported that the continued attacks on Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki and his Government in the Arabic press meant that he was:</p>
<p>“… shouldering a huge burden with little in the way of support from a functional </p>
<p>bureaucracy or supporting structures. He is clearly feeling the pressure but </p>
<p>continues to show signs of increasing independence and I sense even ownership. </p>
<p>Our part in the war, what we have done, will do and how we do it and how it is </p>
<p>reported in the coming months, is how our coalition partners, the Iraqis and the </p>
<p>Arab nations in particular will perceive us. Given our British heritage in this part </p>
<p>of the world and the high regard for our honesty, principles and the quality of our </p>
<p>contribution, there is, unless I am much mistaken, a lot yet to play for and a great </p>

<p><b>885. </b> On 6 June, at the request of the FCO, the JIC examined the current influence of </p>
<p>Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI, formerly SCIRI) and Badr, their future strategy </p>
<p>and the extent of Iranian influence on them.</p>
<p>484</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“Increasing frustration with Prime Minister Maliki has led the Islamic Supreme </p>
<p>Council of Iraq (ISCI) to explore alternative alliances … Ultimately, ISCI wants to </p>
<p>be the dominant Shia political party. </p>
<p>“The Badr Organisation’s evolution from militia to political party has been largely </p>
<p>cosmetic. Badr remains ISCI’s paramilitary wing; its prime goal is control of Iraq’s </p>
<p>security institutions. It holds a disproportionate number of command posts in the </p>
<p>police and is trying to secure similar authority in the army. Most of its members in </p>
<p>the Iraqi Security Forces remain loyal to their former Badr command structures and </p>
<p>many continue to pursue a partisan, and by its nature, sectarian agenda. </p>
<p>“ISCI/Badr have made common goals and close links with Iran … However, ISCI/</p>
<p>Badr’s willingness to take instruction from Tehran has probably been diminishing </p>
<p>since 2003 and Iran’s ability to direct political outcomes in Iraq is limited …</p>
<p>“Participation by the Office of the Martyr Sadr in provincial elections tentatively </p>
<p>scheduled for December is likely to reduce ISCI/Badr’s power in many provinces </p>
<p>across the South. Fierce competition for the Shia vote is likely to lead to increasing </p>
<p>violence between Badr and JAM. ISCI/Badr may win the most votes in Basra, but </p>
<p>this will not necessarily translate into effective control.”</p>
<p><b>886. </b> On 7 June, Maj Gen Shaw reported that as a result of Qadir’s death there were </p>
<p>“encouraging signs that a real blow has been dealt to JAM’s capability and will in the </p>
<p>city”. He commented:</p>
<p>“Whilst JAM will continue to try to attack our people and will no doubt portray our </p>
<p>eventual departure as their victory, the more important question now for the future </p>
<p>security of Basra surrounds the relationship between JAM and the ISF … Just as </p>
<p>it will be the Sunni who rid Iraq of AQ, so the Shia are potentially the main threat to </p>
<p>Iranian influence. But turning Iraqi nationalists against their co&#8209;religionists is made </p>
<p>more difficult by our presence. Reconciling MAS/OMS [Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr/Office of the </p>
<p>Martyr Sadr] and hence reconcilable sections of JAM to the ‘GOI now’ as opposed to </p>
<p>the ‘GOI after MNF’ is vital.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>887. </b> In his update on Iraq on 8 June, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary said that DOP would </p>
<p>need to take a decision shortly on the timing of a withdrawal from Basra Palace: </p>
<p>“Within the MOD, a view is emerging that leaving there would reduce our situational </p>
<p>awareness to the extent that we would fairly rapidly lose all ability to generate </p>
<p>military effect; we would also probably have to pull out of the PJCC [Provincial Joint </p>
<p>Co&#8209;ordination Centre], where we undertake ISF training.”</p>
<p>486</p>
<p><b>888. </b> Attached to the update was a paper by the IPU on the situation outside MND(SE) </p>
<p>and Baghdad, as requested by Mr Blair on 25 May.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p> It said that Babil, Wasit, Karbala </p>
<p>and Qadisiyah were “generally stable” but that Salah ad Din and Ninawa were </p>
<p>experiencing “major sectarian and ethnic tensions” and it was uncertain whether they </p>
<p>would be judged to have met the standards for transition to PIC. </p>
<p><b>889. </b> On 11 June, Mr Gordon Brown, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Mr Browne made </p>
<p>a joint visit to Baghdad and met a number of key individuals, including the Prime Minister </p>
<p>and President, Gen Petraeus, Ambassador Crocker and Mr Asquith.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>890. </b> Mr Gordon Brown told Prime Minister Maliki that:</p>
<p>“… the UK was keen to support the Prime Minister on changes to the Constitution, </p>
<p>new laws and reforms and economic infrastructure and support.” </p>
<p><b>891. </b> On Basra, Prime Minister Maliki “promised rapid progress”, specifically:</p>
<p>“… a new chief of police in two days, a new Governor within the week, appoint </p>
<p>a new General to take overall charge of security …”</p>
<p><b>892. </b> President Talabani assessed that the Baghdad Security Plan had produced “a </p>
<p>slight improvement but he had hoped for better”. Gen Petraeus highlighted a “steadily </p>
<p>falling sectarian murder rate” and produced a chart which showed a drop from 1,474 in </p>
<p>January to 599 in May. </p>
<p><b>893. </b> In response to a question about his September report to Congress, Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>said:</p>
<p>“… the key point was that even if sectarianism could be tackled all of the other </p>
<p>issues remained: Iran, AQ, the weak borders, Sadr and the state of the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces.” </p>
<p><b>894. </b> A note of the meeting prepared by Mr Brown’s Private Office observed that “despite </p>
<p>reported US concerns, there was a notable silence on Basra issues other than to confirm </p>
<p>PIC was going to be a difficult call”.</p>

<p><b>895. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told Mr Blair that the visitors had found Gen Petraeus </p>
<p>and Ambassador Crocker:</p>
<p>“… heavily focused on trying to achieve the ‘benchmarks’ set by Congress, in </p>

<p>September.”</p>
<p>489</p>
<p><b>896. </b> On 12 June, the Chiefs of Staff noted:</p>
<p>“Some elements of the GoI’s [Government of Iraq’s] current plans for Basra Palace </p>
<p>post&#8209;transition were of concern, including the intent to guard the Palace with a </p>
<p>dedicated Palace Guard Force (which had yet to be raised, trained or equipped). </p>
<p>Notwithstanding reported calls from within MNF&#8209;I for local publicity, the intent </p>
<p>remained for the planned withdrawal from Basra Palace to be conducted in as low </p>
<p>key a manner as possible.”</p>
<p>490</p>
<p><b>897. </b> In his weekly report on 13 June, Maj Gen Shaw wrote:</p>
<p>“… the fate of BP [Basra Palace] rests now in the hands of GOI/MNF, and PM Maliki </p>
<p>has taken a personal interest in it. Any idea that we might be able to extend our </p>
<p>presence needs to appreciate the extent of Iraqi ownership of this issue, which itself </p>
<p>is a result of hard selling of the imperative requirement for UK to leave the Palace </p>
<p>in August.”</p>
<p>491</p>
<p><b>898. </b> Maj Gen Shaw also reported on the implications of the coalition’s existing </p>
<p>reconciliation effort for relations within MND(SE). He wrote:</p>
<p>“An MNF obsessed with the Sunni problem sees reconciliation through a Sunni </p>
<p>prism, the focus on Sunni tribes vs AQ. For the Shia, I contend that reconciliation </p>
<p>has to mean harnessing Iraqi nationalism in support of GoI against the Iranian </p>
<p>malign influences. Our presence confuses Shia loyalties; some support GoI and </p>
<p>hence don’t attack MNF; some (JAM etc) see MNF as occupiers and attack us </p>
<p>and hence are equivocal in their support of GoI; yet both sets would claim to be </p>
<p>nationalists. This issue is beginning to be of immediate relevance in Basra with the </p>
<p>question raised by JAM of senior public figures regarding their loyalties, ‘are you </p>
<p>a collaborator or nationalist?’ Convincing Muqtada al&#8209;Sadr to buy in to the current, </p>
<p>as opposed to the post&#8209;MNF, political process will be the key to Shia reconciliation </p>
<p>success, particularly in tackling the malign influences of the secret cells and Iran … </p>
<p>Al Sadr is already courting both Sunni and Shia groupings and calling them to join </p>
<p>him under a Nationalist banner. This, however, is at least in part balanced by Fadhila </p>
<p>and their cohort’s intention for a Federal Iraqi state. How well we manage to drive </p>
<p>a wedge between the nationalists, their current Iranian patrons and the Iranian </p>
<p>surrogates will have implications Iraq wide.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>899. </b> On 13 June, the al&#8209;Askari mosque in Samarra, which had previously been bombed </p>
<p>in February 2006 (see Section 9.4), was bombed for a second time.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> Grand Ayatollah </p>
<p>al&#8209;Sistani publicly condemned the bombing, but appealed to the Iraqi Shia community to </p>
<p>show restraint. </p>
<p><b>900. </b> On 13 June, a senior government official specialising in the Middle East (2) wrote </p>
<p>to Mr McDonald seeking “policy guidance” on JAM and Shia outreach contacts.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The minute was copied to Lt Gen Lamb, VAdm Style, Mr Howard, Maj Gen Dutton, </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shaw, Mr Dowse, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary, Mr Asquith and Mr Jones. </p>
<p>The document was not copied more widely in the Cabinet Office. </p>
<p><b>901. </b> In the letter, the senior official explained that, with Maj Gen Shaw’s agreement and </p>
<p>with the knowledge of Mr Asquith and Lt Gen Lamb, there had been “exploratory talks” </p>
<p>for “some weeks” with JAM1 from his detention in Basra (see Section 9.4). He explained </p>
<p>that JAM1 remained an influential figure in JAM in Basra and beyond and had continued </p>
<p>to communicate with JAM whilst in detention. </p>
<p><b>902. </b> During a series of interviews, JAM1 had expressed concern about growing Iranian </p>
<p>influence over JAM. The senior official told Mr McDonald: “We assess that he is telling </p>
<p>the truth in this respect”.</p>
<p><b>903. </b> The senior official explained that JAM1 had said that he was ready to work to </p>
<p>reduce JAM attacks on MNF, focusing initially on indirect fire. JAM1 maintained that, </p>
<p>under his influence, the JAM mainstream in Basra would gradually be able to reassert </p>
<p>authority over the secret cells. In return for reducing indirect fire from JAM, he wanted a </p>
<p>suspension of strike operations and the release of detainees. To build confidence, it was </p>
<p>proposed that this process would need to begin with a short trial period cease&#8209;fire. </p>
<p><b>904. </b> The senior official reported that JAM1 accepted MNF’s right to self&#8209;defence and </p>
<p>to continue to intercept smuggled arms supplies during this period but rejected the </p>
<p>MNF’s right to target JAM secret cells, arguing that it was for JAM to control its own </p>
<p>people. There was no intention to concede this point. The trial cease&#8209;fire was proposed </p>
<p>for 15 to 17 June. If this was effective “the next step could be a longer cease&#8209;fire, for </p>
<p>which [JAM1] would expect more detainee releases and a continued suspension of </p>
<p>strike operations”. </p>
<p><b>905. </b> The senior official also reported that Maj Gen Shaw was content to test JAM1’s </p>
<p>ability to influence JAM, on the basis that a short suspension of strike operations and </p>
<p>the release of some detainees fitted fortuitously with existing plans. Two of the detainees </p>
<p>whose release had been requested by JAM1 were likely to be released before 15 June, </p>
<p>which would be presented to JAM1 as being as a direct response to his cease&#8209;fire offer </p>
<p>and a sign of coalition good faith. </p>

<p><b>Detention by UK forces in Iraq</b></p>
<p>In the course of operations in Iraq, UK forces detained people:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as Prisoners of War (POWs);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>who were suspected of criminal activities (criminal detainees); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>who were considered to pose a threat to security (security detainees).</p>
<p>The Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War (the Third Geneva </p>
<p>Convention) defines the categories of persons entitled to POW status and the conditions </p>
<p>of their captivity.</p>
<p>494</p>
<p> Article 118 states that POWs shall be released and repatriated without </p>
<p>delay after the cessation of active hostilities.</p>
<p>As an Occupying Power in Iraq, the UK Government derived its right to intern individuals </p>
<p>who presented a security threat to the mission from the Geneva Convention Relative to </p>
<p>the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (the Fourth Geneva Convention).</p>
<p>The Fourth Geneva Convention sets out provisions governing the status and treatment of </p>
<p>“protected persons”, whom it defines as: </p>
<p>“Persons … who, at a given moment and in any manner whatsoever, find themselves, </p>
<p>in case of a conflict or occupation, in the hands of a Party to the conflict or Occupying </p>
<p>Power of which they are not nationals.”</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>The provisions of the Convention include the following: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 27, which states that protected persons are entitled, in all circumstances, to </p>
<p>respect for their persons, honour, family rights, religious convictions and practices, </p>
<p>and their manners and customs. They should at all times be humanely treated and </p>
<p>protected. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 78, which states that: “If the Occupying Power considers it necessary, for </p>
<p>imperative reasons of security, to take safety measures concerning protected </p>
<p>persons, it may, at the most, subject them to assigned residence or to internment.” </p>
<p>Decisions regarding internment should be made according to a regular procedure </p>
<p>prescribed by the Occupying Power in accordance with the provisions of the </p>
<p>Fourth Geneva Convention; the procedure should include the right of appeal and </p>
<p>provision for a review of the decision to inter every six months by a competent </p>
<p>body set up by the Occupying Power. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>In so far as the provisions of the Fourth Geneva Convention allowed an Occupying Power </p>
<p>to exercise functions of government in occupied territory, Article 6 provided that they </p>
<p>should continue to have effect for as long as its military occupation continued. Article 27 </p>
<p>therefore continued to apply throughout the Occupation of Iraq. </p>
<p>Ordinarily, these provisions, including Article 78, cease to apply “one year after the </p>
<p>general close of military operations”. In the case of Iraq, the power to intern individuals for </p>
<p>imperative reasons of security was extended beyond the initial period of Occupation, by </p>
<p>virtue of UN resolution 1511 (2003) and by resolution 1546 (2004) and the letters referred </p>

<p><b>908. </b> In an email to Mr Casey on 14 June, Mr Asquith commented:</p>
<p>“… I do not doubt the tactical benefit of engaging those in Anbar and other Sunni </p>
<p>areas in which AQ operate with the purpose of persuading them to turn against </p>
<p>AQ. Nor do I have any reason to doubt MNF&#8209;I assessments that this engagement </p>
<p>has delivered significant results in terms of identifying AQ operatives and caches, </p>
<p>restricting AQ operating capabilities and reducing attacks … against coalition forces. </p>
<p>Engaging with local armed, militant, insurgency or opposition groups was of course </p>
<p>what I and others were engaged in throughout 2005. I am not opposed to the </p>
<p>principle.”</p>
<p>496</p>
<p><b>909. </b> Nevertheless, Mr Asquith questioned whether these groups had turned against </p>
<p>AQ for wholly ideological reasons. He thought the groups were more strongly motivated </p>
<p>either by a power struggle with AQ, which was encroaching the tribes’ territory; or </p>
<p>money; or by a desire – under the protection of US forces – to re&#8209;arm and prepare for </p>
<p>a future campaign against Iran and/or the “Shia government”. Mr Asquith considered </p>
<p>that motivation had an adverse effect on the coalition’s broader reconciliation strategy. </p>
<p>It increased Prime Minister Maliki’s concerns and put him “under severe pressure from </p>
<p>his Shia constituency who pose the question: why is he tolerating the creation of what </p>
<p>effectively are Sunni militias who pose a threat (now or later) to Shia communities, while </p>
<p>at the same time tolerating regular coalition attacks on Shia militias?” </p>
<p><b>910. </b> Mr Asquith wrote:</p>
<p>“Given the imperative for Petraeus to deliver something by 13 September … we </p>
<p>can’t halt the engagement process. We should instead seek to shape it in a way </p>
<p>that reduces the risk.”</p>

<p>“The US are … focused on the Anbar model, but this is creating real tension with </p>
<p>Maliki. Violence continues to be down in Anbar, but the motivations of the tribes </p>
<p>remain unclear, and they continue to express their opposition to the Government </p>
<p>of Iraq. Nor do they tie in to any convincing, wider, Sunni leadership … Maliki </p>
<p>is … coming under pressure from other Shia over the creation of a well&#8209;armed </p>
<p>Sunni militia, particularly as the US now propose to extend the model to areas </p>
<p>of Baghdad …</p>
<p>“The Pentagon this week also released its now regular quarterly report on progress </p>
<p>in Iraq. This noted that overall levels of violence in the country had not decreased </p>
<p>since the start of the surge, noted that the GoI’s delivery had been ‘uneven’, and that </p>
<p>it had made ‘little progress’ on the political front – reconciliation was described as a </p>
<p>‘serious unfulfilled objective’.”</p>
<p>497</p>
<p><b>912. </b> The Pentagon report referred to named Basra as “Partially Ready for Transition”, </p>
<p>in the same category as Wasit, Qadisiyah, Babil, Karbala, Baghdad, Diyala, Salah ad </p>

<p>498</p>
<p> Only Anbar was marked “Not Ready for Transition”. </p>
<p><b>913. </b> On 17 June, the US military led a Corps&#8209;level strike operation in Maysan Province </p>
<p>targeting Iranian&#8209;affiliated militants.</p>
<p>499</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>914. </b> Maj Gen Shaw expressed concern beforehand about the need to be seen to </p>
<p>respect Iraqi sovereignty, the acceptable level of collateral damage and the way the </p>
<p>operation would be presented. Despite the US going “some way to addressing the </p>
<p>GOC’s concerns”, the operation went ahead with no Iraqi participation. It was unclear </p>
<p>whether the Governor of Maysan had been informed ahead of the operation. </p>
<p><b>915. </b> The MND(SE) weekly report stated: “The outcome was a degree of opprobrium </p>
<p>levelled at British Forces who were blamed erroneously not only for participating directly </p>
<p>in the raid but also for having done so without legitimate authority in violation of the </p>
<p>PIC MOU.” </p>
<p><b>916. </b> Lt Gen Lamb considered that the response of the Iraqi Government and security </p>
<p>forces to the bombing of the al&#8209;Askari Mosque contrasted positively with their responses </p>
<p>in 2006.</p>
<p>500</p>
<p> The Iraqi Government had moved quickly to intervene, to establish a curfew </p>
<p>and, across the political divide, to denounce the attacks. </p>
<p><b>917. </b> The positive response was counterbalanced by the fact that the number of </p>

<p>172</p>
<p>In Lt Gen Lamb’s view, that increase needed to be viewed in the light of the increased </p>
<p>MNF and ISF activity against the insurgents across Iraq as the US surge kicked in. </p>
<p><b>918. </b> Meanwhile, progress on reconciliation and engagement continued and Lt Gen </p>

<p>“Thank you for your minute of 13 June. I was surprised to hear of this initiative only </p>
<p>when it was well advanced (ie about to start delivery). As you say, it has major </p>
<p>political implications.</p>
<p>“That said – I think it right and reasonable for us to try (and be seen to be trying) to </p>
<p>do everything better to protect our forces. And I agree we should be hard headed </p>
<p>about possible rewards to [JAM1] (it is fortunate that two of the six detainees he </p>
<p>wants are already scheduled for release). Although we cannot expect complete </p>
<p>quiet, we need a measurable difference directly attributable to [JAM1] before </p>
<p>proceeding further.</p>
<p>“What were the results of the (first) cease&#8209;fire?”</p>

<p><b>920. </b> In a summary of the negotiations with JAM prepared in November 2007, a senior </p>
<p>official specialising in the Middle East (1) explained that early talks with JAM1 had </p>
<p>focused on:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The release of Basra detainees, which would help JAM1’s local standing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The relationship between JAM and the Iranian&#8209;backed Secret Cells. JAM1 was </p>
<p>adamant that he could bring the Secret Cells into line with his policy. MND(SE) </p>
<p>and [government officials working closely with the military] insisted on a broad </p>
<p>right to self&#8209;defence and the need to counter Iran.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risks of US intervention. [JAM1] feared a US takeover of MND(SE) and the </p>
<p>transfer of detainees to US custody.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risks of Shia against Shia political conflict. From the start [JAM1] talked </p>
<p>of the necessity of an accommodation with Badr, Fadilah and the other Basra </p>
<p>parties. He wanted Fadilah detainees released as well as JAM.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need for development work to continue. Although [JAM1] wanted the military </p>
<p>occupation to end as soon as possible, he requested an acceleration of visible </p>
<p>development work and later provided a list of priority projects to improve quality </p>
<p>of life in Basra.”</p>

<p>and whether they consult with the US or Iraqis);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what the US view was, because “if they don’t sign&#8209;off in theatre we will need to </p>

<p><b>925. </b> The senior official went on to describe the outcome of the trial cease&#8209;fire:</p>
<p>“Reporting from Basra shows a sharp reduction in rocket and mortar fire against </p>
<p>Basra Palace and Basra Air Station (BAS) over 15&#8209;17 June. There were indirect fire </p>

<p>into Basra were also markedly down. There have been attacks on BAS or the Palace </p>
<p>every day since 18 June.”</p>
<p><b>926. </b> The senior official explained that on 18 June, his colleagues had discussed the </p>
<p>cease&#8209;fire with JAM1. The discussion had led to an “outline plan to build confidence on </p>
<p>both sides” which involved:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>The release of two further named detainees, both of whom were classified </p>
<p>‘orange’ in MND(SE)’s system (‘of some risk to the coalition if released’). </p>
<p>The senior official reported that “MND(SE) view the releases as relatively </p>
<p>unproblematic”. This would happen at the end of the trial cease&#8209;fire, as a test </p>
<p>of coalition good faith.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>A month&#8209;long JAM cease&#8209;fire in Basra province, matched by a continued </p>
<p>suspension of strike operations by the coalition, which would retain the right to </p>
<p>fire in self&#8209;defence, to interdict arms shipments and to intervene when asked </p>
<p>to do so by the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>Consideration of the release of two further named detainees, depending on </p>
<p>the effectiveness of the month long cease&#8209;fire. These individuals were more </p>
<p>significant, and classed as ‘red’.</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p>The possibility of an indefinite cease&#8209;fire if the month&#8209;long version proved </p>
<p>successful. JAM1 would be likely to seek additional detainee releases.</p>
<p><b>927. </b> If the advice was approved, the senior official explained that Lt Gen Lamb would </p>
<p>brief Gen Petraeus and either Dr Rubaie or Prime Minister Maliki on the proposal. The </p>
<p>Foreign and Defence Secretaries would be consulted at every stage of the negotiations. </p>
<p>Releasing the nominated detainees, who were “held on the basis of intelligence, under </p>
<p>the powers of internment provided in the resolution, rather than on the basis of an </p>
<p>evidential criminal case” was a matter for MND(SE) and the MOD. </p>
<p><b>928. </b> The risks identified in the submission included that the US might view the </p>
<p>contacts with JAM as undermining their security strategy, although it was reported that </p>
<p>Lt Gen Lamb did not think this likely. The senior official wrote:</p>
<p>“GOC MND(SE) and HMCG Basra strongly support this initiative. HMA Baghdad is </p>
<p>also in favour, with the caveat that al&#8209;Maliki will need careful handling. SBMR&#8209;I is </p>
<p>also supportive but notes that the initiative will need to be integrated with broader </p>
<p>coalition efforts to engage JAM.”</p>

<p>ceasefire, and that the US and the Iraqi Government should be briefed soon. </p>

<p> Although “the atmospherics were good” the officials had no </p>
<p>news so far about releases and could only say that London had decided to consider all </p>
<p>four releases at the same time. Once the principle had been established, they expected </p>
<p>that further releases “should prove easier”. </p>
<p><b>932. </b> The officials raised the heavy IDF that had followed the end of the trial cease&#8209;fire </p>

<p> JAM1 said that he regretted the death and that </p>
<p>had the two detainee releases taken place as he had requested, he might have been </p>
<p>able to contain the violence. </p>
<p><b>933. </b> JAM1 noted that the negotiation process was becoming more widely known and </p>
<p>made a “clear linkage” with transfer to PIC “saying, in effect, that our peace process </p>
<p>would enable the transfer of the security portfolio to the Iraqis”. The officials asked </p>

<p>511</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>938. </b> A brief for the conversation by Mr Blair’s Private Secretary suggested that </p>
<p>President Bush might raise concerns about Basra.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> The Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“You can reassure him that our current plans would see around 5,000 troops </p>
<p>remaining in Basra over the Autumn, to focus on training, re&#8209;intervention (if required) </p>
<p>and building situational awareness in the South. We will ensure that transition to </p>

<p><b>939. </b> During the video conference, Mr Blair stressed the importance of a “visible </p>

<p>“The Iraqis understand the urgency of what needs to be done. Plenty of pressure </p>
<p>is being put on the leadership by their own disenchanted constituents … But </p>
<p>nonetheless the Iraqi clock is keeping slower time than Washington’s. And much </p>
<p>of what is being asked is difficult to deliver in circumstances where government </p>

<p><b>943. </b> Colonel Peter Mansoor, executive officer to Gen Petraeus from 2007 to 2008, </p>

<p>areas cleared could not be held without keeping sufficient troops positioned among the </p>
<p>people”.</p>
<p>516</p>
<p> Neither the Maliki government nor the MNF&#8209;I were willing to support “more </p>
<p>robust” operations, and the ISF were “too few and too poorly trained to take on the </p>
<p>responsibility for securing Basra”. </p>
<p><b>944. </b> Col Mansoor assessed:</p>
<p>“Predictably, the ‘clear and leave’ operations did not achieve enduring security gains, </p>
<p>as the Iraqi security forces to which the British quickly transferred control of cleared </p>
<p>areas proved unable to keep them clear. As a result, Operation SINBAD was an </p>
<p>exercise in futility, and Sadrist militiamen soon regained control of their safe havens </p>

<p>“In Basra itself, whilst a palpable threat to MNF existed, there was general </p>

<p>Such a gap should be avoided as it would place GOC MND(SE) in an extremely </p>

<p><b>946. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted:</p>
<p>“Any pressure on de&#8209;latching the handover of Basra Palace and PIC should be </p>
<p>resisted, however, it was recognised that some very limited flexibility may be </p>

<p><b>947. </b> After discussions in Baghdad, on 26 June a note containing Lt Gen Lamb’s </p>
<p>comments on the 20 June submission on cease&#8209;fire negotiations was sent to VAdm </p>
<p>Style. It said: </p>
<p>“SBMR&#8209;I would wish to offer the following comment, for consideration alongside </p>
<p>[the submission]:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He remains generally supportive of an [UK] approach; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He suspects there might have been an underestimation of the sensitivity of the </p>
<p>GOI/PM position;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He suspects that there is a possibility at least that this local initiative might </p>
<p>undermine the broader engagement; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He suspects that [Gen Petraeus] would be unlikely to agree to ‘a continued </p>
<p>suspension of strike operations from the coalition in Basra province’; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Noting the difficulty of capturing the detail of such negotiations on paper, he </p>
<p>senses from the overall tone of [the submission] that there might be a lack of a </p>
<p>hard edge to the MNF&#8209;I side of the agreement; in particular, that MNF&#8209;I would </p>
<p>seek [JAM1]’s ‘approval’ for coalition action seems inappropriate.”</p>
<p>520</p>
<p><b>948. </b> On 26 June, a senior government official specialising in the Middle East (2) </p>
<p>submitted supplementary advice to Mrs Beckett, via Mr Richmond, copied to Mr Bowen </p>
<p>and Mrs Beckett’s Principal Private Secretary.</p>
<p>521</p>
<p> The senior official wrote:</p>
<p>“Discussions on … cease&#8209;fire talks with JAM detainee [JAM1] – have continued </p>
<p>in Basra and Baghdad since my submission on 21 June. Both SBMR&#8209;I and HMA </p>
<p>Baghdad have additional comments, based on their reading of the final draft of </p>
<p>the submission and subsequent exchanges with [officials working closely with the </p>

<p>9.5  |  June 2006 to 27 June 2007</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Lt Gen Lamb’s position was reported as:</p>
<p>“SBMR&#8209;I … remains generally supportive of the initiative but flags up several risks, </p>
<p>which are recognised in the submission and which we would not dispute:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Possible Government of Iraq suspicion or outright opposition</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The risks of undermining broader engagement through a local approach in MND </p>
<p>(SE)</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US opposition to a suspension of strike operations</p>
<p>“SBMR&#8209;I also comments that the MNF&#8209;I side in the negotiations is not being tough </p>
<p>enough with [JAM1].”</p>
<p><b>950. </b> Mr Asquith’s position was reported to be that:</p>
<p>“… he did not have a problem with doing a deal with [JAM1], but he too argued that </p>
<p>the negotiating position should be much tougher, commenting on policy as follows:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>We should not undertake to suspend strike operations (para 8b) – </p>
<p>particularly as [operations by another body] will continue unaffected.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>We should include a cessation of EFP [Explosively Formed Projectile] </p>
<p>attacks as the test for [JAM1] to pass (ie not just IDF).</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>We should not leave ambiguity over strike action against secret cells or our </p>
<p>expectation that [JAM1] controls their activity (para 15).</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p>It is unrealistic for the process to be brought to a close straightforwardly if </p>
<p>the US at some point demand that we cease contacts with [JAM1]. Having </p>
<p>led him down the garden path, he will take it out on us when he sees that </p>
<p>we’ve deposited him on the compost heap.</p>
<p>e. </p>
<p>I don’t see in the submission description of how we will seek to set </p>
<p>mainstream JAM against secret cells (para 11).</p>
<p>f. </p>
<p>Any ‘cease&#8209;fire’ we might offer on our part should not, in my view, be </p>
<p>province wide (para 8b) – we should limit it to Basra City.</p>
<p>g. </p>
<p>It seems that two of [JAM1]’s desired six were released before the 48 hour </p>
<p>cease&#8209;fire – if so this was unwisely generous.</p>
<p>h. </p>
<p>[JAM1]’s been shut up for two years. Why is he now motivated by fear </p>
<p>of being supplanted or suspicion of Iranian influence? Are we being </p>
<p>uncharacteristically naïve?”</p>
<p><b>951. </b> The senior official added:</p>
<p>“Following further discussions, HMA [Mr Asquith] raised the following:</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The end state is not clear. Buying repeated cease&#8209;fires of one month </p>
<p>duration (until the UK military withdraw from Basra province?) seems a lot </p>
<p>to give away for questionable delivery.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How do we track the activities of the people we release.</p>
<p>–</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I still think we limit ourselves too much in what action we say we’ll </p>
<p>refrain from. But we don’t explain to [JAM1] that others … might conduct </p>
<p>operations; so we still run the risk that he will interpret us reneging when </p>
<p>in fact it is someone else. We end up with the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>“HMA also questioned the resumption of IDF immediately after the trial cease&#8209;fire </p>
<p>15&#8209;17 June. [The senior official] explained that no deal was reached on immediate </p>
<p>extension of the cease&#8209;fire so this was to be expected.”</p>
<p><b>952. </b> In conclusion, the senior official wrote:</p>
<p>“There is a difference of British views between Basra and Baghdad, which it is </p>
<p>not for [us] to resolve. If the Secretary of State approves continuing negotiations </p>
<p>with [JAM1], it is essential that there be a mechanism for agreeing UK policy lines </p>
<p>reasonably quickly, within parameters laid down by ministers. One way of doing </p>
<p>this would be for [government officials working closely with the military] to collate </p>
<p>recommendations and views from theatre and send these to David Richmond, </p>
<p>copied to Desmond Bowen.”</p>
<p><b>953. </b> On 27 June, Mr Blair stood down formally as Prime Minister. At the start of his final </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Questions he paid tribute to two individuals recently killed in Iraq</p>
<p>522</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>another killed in Afghanistan</p>
<p>523</p>
<p> and said:</p>
<p>“I am sorry about the dangers that they [UK armed forces] face today in Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan. I know that some may think that they face these dangers in vain. I do </p>
<p>not, and I never will. I believe that they are fighting for the security of this country </p>
<p>and the wider world against people who would destroy our way of life.”</p>
<p>524</p>
<p><b>954. </b> Iraq was also raised by Mr Jeremy Corbyn who asked when Mr Blair expected </p>
<p>British troops to be withdrawn.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“The numbers of UK forces in Iraq depend on the conditions in Iraq. The numbers of </p>
<p>forces have come down from 9,000 to 7,000 to 5,500. When, in the next few weeks, </p>
<p>we are able to complete a further phased withdrawal, they will come down even </p>
<p>further, but they must come down as and when the security conditions allow.”</p>
<p><b>955. </b> Shortly after Mr Blair tendered his resignation, HM The Queen asked </p>
<p>Mr Gordon Brown to form a government. He arrived at No.10 the same afternoon. </p>
