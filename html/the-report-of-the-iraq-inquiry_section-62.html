<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision in mid-January 2003 to deploy a divisional headquarters and three </p>
<p>combat brigades for potential operations in southern Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the commitment of those forces to a combat role in the initial stages of the </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) governing the conduct of </p>
<p>military operations, including discussions on delegation of authority for targeting </p>
<p>decisions during the air campaign.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the campaign plan for the invasion, which is addressed in Section 8;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the roles and responsibilities of the Secretary of State for Defence, the Chief of </p>
<p>the Defence Staff (CDS), the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) in the Ministry </p>
<p>of Defence (MOD), and other key military officers and civilians, and the way </p>
<p>in which advice was prepared for Ministers and decisions taken in the MOD in </p>
<p>2002 and 2003, which are set out in Section 2;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decisions on the wider UK strategy towards Iraq which are necessary to </p>
<p>understand the wider context surrounding military deployments. Those are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 3;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s assessment of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) in late 2002 </p>
<p>and early 2003, which is addressed in Section 4.3;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the consideration of the legal basis for military action, which is set out in </p>
<p>Section 5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the preparations to equip the force for operations in Iraq, and the implications of </p>
<p>the decisions between mid-December 2002 and mid-January 2003 to increase </p>
<p>the size of UK combat forces and be ready to take an earlier role in the invasion </p>
<p>in support of US forces, which are addressed in Section 6.3;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the funding for the operation, which is addressed in Section 13; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the planning and preparations for the UK military contribution post-conflict, </p>
<p>including decisions on the UK’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) for UK military </p>
<p>forces, which are addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>388</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The size and composition of a UK military contribution to the US-led invasion of Iraq </p>
<p>was largely discretionary. The US wanted some UK capabilities (including Special </p>
<p>Forces), to use UK bases, and the involvement of the UK military to avoid the </p>
<p>perception of unilateral US military action. The primary impetus to maximise the size </p>
<p>of the UK contribution and the recommendations on its composition came from the </p>
<p>Armed Forces, with the agreement of Mr Hoon.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decisions taken between mid-December 2002 and mid-January 2003 to increase </p>
<p>the combat force deployed to three brigades and bring forward the date on which UK </p>
<p>forces might participate in combat operations compressed the timescales available </p>
<p>for preparation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The decision to deploy a large scale force for potential combat operations was taken </p>
<p>without collective Ministerial consideration of the decision and its implications.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The large scale force deployed was a one-shot capability. It would have been difficult </p>
<p>to sustain the force if combat operations had been delayed until autumn 2003 or </p>
<p>longer, and it constrained the capabilities which were available for a UK military </p>
<p>contribution to post-conflict operations.</p>
<p><b>The switch to the South</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> The initial planning for a military invasion of Iraq and the decision on 31 October 2002 </p>
<p>to offer ground forces to the US for planning purposes are addressed in Section 6.1.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The main planning assumption throughout 2002 was that the UK would provide air </p>
<p>and maritime forces in support of US operations in southern Iraq, but that UK ground </p>
<p>forces would be deployed through Turkey for operations in northern Iraq.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> As Section 6.1 sets out, there was no certainty that Turkey would agree to the  </p>
<p>UK deployment.</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Mr Blair had also been considering a number of issues over the Christmas holiday  </p>
<p>in 2002. On 4 January 2003 he produced a long note to officials in No.10 on a range  </p>
<p>of issues.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>7. </b> On military preparations, Mr Blair wrote that there was a need to make sure that the </p>
<p>military plan was “viable”; and that he needed a meeting and the “military’s assurance </p>
<p>that the plan can work. This is no small undertaking.”</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Other points in the note are addressed in Section 3.6.</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>CENTCOM’s proposal for a UK Division in the South</b></p>
<p><b>9.  At the beginning of 2003, the US asked the UK to provide ground forces in  </b></p>
<p><b>the South.</b></p>
<p><b>10. </b> Major General Albert Whitley, Senior British Land Adviser and Deputy Commanding </p>
<p>General (Post Hostilities), told the Inquiry that, after General Tommy Franks, </p>
<p>Commander in Chief US Central Command (CENTCOM), had decided not to move </p>
<p>the US 4th Infantry Division south, he had discussed with Lieutenant General David </p>
<p>McKiernan, Commander, Coalition Forces Land Component Command (CFLCC), </p>
<p>on 28 December 2002 whether it would be possible to use UK forces in the South to </p>
<p>augment US forces.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>11. </b> On 5 January, Brigadier Whitley prepared a paper for the Permanent Joint </p>
<p>Headquarters (PJHQ) on “the imperatives for timely decision making for the commitment </p>
<p>of UK Land Forces” to the US Operational Plan.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Brigadier Whitley explained that uncertainties about whether Turkey would allow </p>
<p>transit of ground forces had led US and UK planners, on 28 December, urgently  </p>
<p>to concentrate on developing robust operations from the south. He recorded that  </p>
<p>“even if the UK were … granted transit through Turkey … the complexity and scope  </p>
<p>of the problem … from a purely operational view point, would not be welcomed”.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Instead, Lt Gen McKiernan “would welcome the commitment of a UK division in the </p>
<p>South from the start of the operation”. That would allow him to merge Phases II and III of </p>
<p>the campaign and both of the major subordinate US commands, V Corps and 1 Marine </p>
<p>Expeditionary Force (1 MEF), to strike north fast. The UK mission would be to “seize, </p>
<p>secure and control” the rear area and right flank of the operation and provide a coherent </p>
<p>transition to Phase IV (post-conflict) operations in captured territory without loss of US </p>
<p>combat forces. That would include securing infrastructure such as Umm Qasr and the </p>
<p>Rumaylah oilfields, and fixing Iraqi forces in the Basra area. The UK Area of Operations </p>
<p>(AO)</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> was likely to be bounded by the Iraq/Kuwait border, the US V Corps/1 MEF </p>
<p>boundary, Jalibah air field and the Euphrates, an area about the same size as Kuwait </p>
<p>(approximately 17,800 sq km).</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Brigadier Whitley reported that the US saw the involvement of a UK division in this </p>
<p>role as “so important … they will do anything to assist within their power providing there </p>
<p>is time to do so”. In his view, that would allow the UK force to be “less balanced in its </p>
<p>capability than our doctrine and philosophy demand because the US will provide key </p>
<p>support particularly in fires and air defence”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The plan would require the UK to:</p>
<p>“… weave together three disparate levels of formation (1 MEF, 1(UK) Armd Div </p>
<p>[1st (UK) Armoured Division], a Cdo Bde [Commando Brigade], an AA [Air Assault] </p>
<p>Bde and an armd bde [armoured brigade]) neither of which … have trained nor </p>
<p>operated together in recent history. Their mission rehearsal starts 8 Feb[ruary] 03 … </p>
<p>under the full gaze of the rest of the Coalition, and they had better be ready for it.”</p>
<p><b>16. </b> Brigadier Whitley observed that time was “running out”. The US was “desperate to </p>
<p>see a UK inflow and logistics plan” and there was:</p>
<p>“… no time left to probe UK/US capabilities in the formal and, perhaps methodical </p>
<p>manner that has been done to date. Now is the time for ruthless, hard-hitting </p>
<p>planning … The UK is an issue they [the US] are eager to address – as each day </p>
<p>passes now this issue is snowballing and soon (probably by 12 Jan 03) it will be </p>
<p>difficult to control inside the planning timelines.”</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Brigadier Whitley recommended “most strongly”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that any opportunity for worthwhile UK involvement of land forces in the North </p>
<p>has come and gone”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that “UK tailored forces of a divisional headquarters, 3 Cdo Bde RM [3 </p>
<p>Commando Brigade Royal Marines], 16 AA Bde [16 Air Assault Brigade] and </p>
<p>the necessary logistic C2 [Command and Control] and CSS [Combat Service </p>
<p>Support] is committed to the South”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Acceptance, in principle, of a UK Area of Operations and mission in an area  </p>
<p>of southern Iraq bounded in the north by the Euphrates.”</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Brigadier Whitley concluded:</p>
<p>“The effect of timely decisions on the above on our own ability to successfully </p>
<p>conduct operations and on our US allies cannot be underestimated.”</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The MOD has been unable to locate any later version of Brigadier Whitley’s advice.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>20.  The US request was based on a number of key assumptions, including that </b></p>
<p><b>the UK wanted a significant role in combat operations and that it wanted to </b></p>
<p><b>operate at divisional level with a divisional Area of Responsibility (AOR).</b></p>
<p><b>21.  The military response was immediate and positive and led to a </b></p>
<p><b>recommendation to deploy large scale ground forces to the South.</b></p>
<p><b>22.  Deploying UK ground forces to southern Iraq constituted a step change  </b></p>
<p><b>for the UK, providing it with a far more prominent role in the operational plan.</b></p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>391</p>
<p><b>23.  By the time decisions on the UK role were taken in March 2003, the UK </b></p>
<p><b>contribution had become central to the military campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>24. </b> The Chiefs of Staff had an initial discussion of the proposal that the UK should </p>
<p>provide a division for military operations in southern Iraq on 6 January 2003.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Lieutenant General John Reith, Chief of Joint Operations (CJO), reported a US </p>
<p>view that there was a “90 percent probability of no access” for UK ground forces through </p>
<p>Turkey. The delay had led Lt Gen McKiernan to conclude that he could place only one </p>
<p>division through a northern route into Iraq, and his preference was for that to be the  </p>
<p>US 4th Infantry Division. Gen Franks had directed Lt Gen McKiernan to plan on UK </p>
<p>ground forces being integrated in the South.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Anthony Pigott, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments), reported that he had been given a different steer by the Pentagon as </p>
<p>recently as one hour before the meeting. Lieutenant General George Casey, Director </p>
<p>of the Joint Staff, had “indicated that the UK’s military position had not at all been a </p>
<p>hindrance and had revealed that the northern axis remained of fundamental strategic </p>
<p>significance to the Campaign. It was possible that although the US military might have </p>
<p>been content to disengage the UK from the North, the political machine might not be </p>
<p>so inclined.”</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), directed that the </p>
<p>ambiguity should be resolved but it was “essential” to maintain “constructive ambiguity” </p>
<p>in Iraq over the potential for a northern threat”.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> It was also “agreed that the time was now right” for a direct approach to Turkey </p>
<p>at the political level; and that it would be important to make separate requests for the </p>
<p>forces in Packages 2 and 3.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Lt Gen Reith described his latest paper on the land options, which was “based </p>
<p>on a US offer for the UK to operate at division strength (HQ 1(UK) Armd Div; ATG </p>
<p>[Amphibious Task Group]; 7 Bde [7 Armoured Brigade]; and 16 Air Asslt Bde) in a </p>
<p>discrete AOR in the South”. That plan “appeared to offer strategic influence to the UK, </p>
<p>especially in the move to Phase IV …”</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The US offer of significant logistic support would “allow the UK to commit fewer </p>
<p>personnel but with an increased combat capability necessary because of the nature  </p>
<p>of the task”.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Lt Gen Reith requested decisions by 8 January, including approval to cease </p>
<p>planning for the northern option and to reallocate Operation FRESCO</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> training.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>32. </b> General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the General Staff, noted that the new plan still </p>
<p>had to constitute “a winning concept”.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Paul Johnston, Head of FCO Security Policy Department, reported the </p>
<p>developments to the Private Office of Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>34. </b> Mr Johnston recorded that there was still some possibility that Turkey might say </p>
<p>yes to land forces at the “last moment”. In response to concern from Gen Walker that, </p>
<p>if Saddam Hussein thought there would be no attack from the North he might move his </p>
<p>more effective troops to the South, Mr Johnston had suggested it would be helpful for </p>
<p>Turkey to retain “constructive ambiguity” to keep the pressure on Saddam Hussein  </p>
<p>“and thus make a military option in practice less likely”. Adm Boyce had “strongly </p>
<p>agreed” and stated that the point should be included in the briefing for Mr Geoff Hoon, </p>
<p>the Defence Secretary.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Mr Johnston wrote that the three brigades “would be ready for action by 10 March”. </p>
<p>That reflected US planning assumptions of an “air campaign beginning on 3 March and </p>
<p>the land campaign on 19 March”. The MOD’s initial assessment was that the southern </p>
<p>option offered “significant strategic exposure with minimum military risk. The Iraqi forces </p>
<p>likely to be confronted were ‘incapable of manoeuvre’ and morale was assessed to  </p>
<p>be low.”</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Mr Johnston commented that Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary </p>
<p>(PUS), and Gen Walker:</p>
<p>“… both noted that the southern option for the UK was part of an overall concept </p>
<p>significantly different to that on which Ministers had so far been consulted.”</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Mr Johnston added that the MOD would “make a strategic assessment of the pros </p>
<p>and cons before the next Chiefs’ meeting, to inform the consequent advice to Ministers”.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head (Foreign Affairs) of the Cabinet Office Overseas </p>
<p>and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), reported to Sir David Manning, Head of OD Sec and </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser:</p>
<p>“All of this was new to the Chiefs but greeted with some enthusiasm. They saw </p>
<p>advantages in a relatively discrete UK operation with fewer risks than the northern </p>
<p>route. The UK would be well placed for the transition to Phase IV (peacekeeping) </p>
<p>and in control of Iraq’s access to the sea and 75 percent of its oil. The disadvantages </p>
<p>were also that the UK could be left in an area with lots of media attention and sitting </p>
<p>on the oil fields so vulnerable to the charge that we were only in it for the oil.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>39. </b> A paper from Lt Gen Reith submitted after the discussion reported that Lt Gen </p>
<p>McKiernan lacked combat power in the South during the early stages of the campaign </p>

<p>and the US had “stated a requirement for a divisional HQ, two light brigades, and a </p>
<p>single armoured brigade”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that the risks to a UK division were “minimal” and that the </p>
<p>“geographical area proposed would allow the UK to set the standard in the aftermath”. </p>
<p>It would be “strategically placed to exert maximum influence during Phase IV”.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Lt Gen Reith described the US plan as based on four assumptions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The UK desires a significant role in land combat operations, now in the South </p>
<p>as the only viable alternative to the North.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The UK wishes to operate at divisional level, with a divisional area of </p>
<p>responsibility (AO).”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Recognition that the UK logistic liability should be minimised.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The UK experience in wider peacekeeping, and subsequent ability to conduct </p>
<p>early Phase IV – post conflict – operations.”</p>
<p><b>42. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised that the UK had yet to “conduct a formal tactical estimate on </p>
<p>the proposed mission”; but a “formation capable of armoured manoeuvre” was required </p>
<p>potentially to protect the right flank of 1 MEF during its advance north and to secure </p>
<p>Basra International Airport and fix Iraqi forces in Basra City.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Lt Gen Reith added that the UK “may be asked to take control of key points in the </p>
<p>City during Phase IV, having isolated it during Phase III. Should troops to task not allow </p>
<p>this operation to take place, CFLCC [Coalition Forces Land Component Commander, </p>
<p>Lt Gen McKiernan] accepts that the final securing of Basra would be a corps task.”</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Lt Gen Reith recommended the deployment of a divisional headquarters and three </p>
<p>brigades to the South; and that the armoured brigade should comprise four battlegroups.</p>
<p><b>45.  PJHQ also identified the need to begin thinking about the practical </b></p>
<p><b>consequences of the proposal for the UK’s post-conflict role, including the need </b></p>
<p><b>for more support from other government departments.</b></p>
<p><b>46. </b> On 7 January, Mr Paul Flaherty, MOD Civil Secretary in PJHQ, set out PJHQ’s </p>
<p>thoughts on preparations for Phase IV in a minute to Mr Ian Lee, MOD Director General </p>
<p>Operational Policy.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> In the absence of an agreed US inter-agency position on Phase </p>
<p>IV planning, the CENTCOM commanders’ conference in Tampa, Florida on 15 and 16 </p>
<p>January was likely to have a significant impact on US policy-making.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>47. </b> Phase IV planning was likely to be particularly important:</p>
<p>“… if, as now appears likely, the UK were to take on the first Phase IV AOR in </p>
<p>southern Iraq. We would, in effect be setting the standard for the rest of Phase IV </p>
<p>work. (And, of course, CJO [Lt Gen Reith] is, in any case charged in CDS’ Directive</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>with planning humanitarian assistance in theatre should it become necessary.)</p>
<p>“From our point of view … we have to begin thinking very soon about the practical </p>
<p>consequences on the ground of taking on the AOR. These include issues such </p>
<p>as: food, water, displaced persons, oil (including accounting for its use), potential </p>
<p>Iranian incursions, pollution as well as, in the slightly longer term, security sector </p>
<p>reform and reconstruction. Some, if not all of this will of course either determine, or </p>
<p>more properly ought to be determined by, strategic considerations of post-conflict </p>
<p>Iraqi structures.”</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Flaherty explained that PJHQ intended to establish a team charged with </p>
<p>“developing planning for Phase IV implementation” as soon as possible, which would </p>
<p>aim to take into account the lessons of the Balkans and Afghanistan. PJHQ was </p>
<p>“in a reasonably good position to link up with US military thinking”, but would need </p>
<p>more support from other government departments to help produce “a fully joined </p>
<p>up approach”.</p>
<p><b>49.  The MOD Strategic Planning Group (SPG) advised that forces committed  </b></p>
<p><b>to a southern option in addition to the Amphibious Group would demonstrate  </b></p>
<p><b>a UK commitment to all phases of an operation and, crucially, the aftermath,  </b></p>
<p><b>and provide additional leverage in the planning phases.</b></p>
<p><b>50.  The UK would gain a potential veto, but exercising it would strain UK/US </b></p>
<p><b>relations.</b></p>
<p><b>51.  The role envisaged, of stabilising the South as US forces moved north, had </b></p>
<p><b>the advantage of a reduction in the probable need for high intensity war-fighting.</b></p>
<p><b>52.  The analysis underpinning the SPG’s conclusions did not appear to include </b></p>
<p><b>any assessment of the conditions likely to be encountered or the tasks to be </b></p>
<p><b>performed in either northern or southern Iraq during Phase IV.</b></p>
<p><b>53. </b> On 7 January, the SPG produced a paper analysing the advantages and </p>
<p>disadvantages of changing to a southern option and the risks of a campaign without  </p>
<p>a northern axis.</p>

<p>An explanation of the Chief of Defence Staff’s Directive is provided in Section 8.</p>
<p>13 </p>
<p>Paper [SPG], 7 January 2003, ‘Operation TELIC – Military Strategic Analysis of Pros/Cons of Adopting  </p>
<p>a Southern Land Force Option’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>395</p>
<p><b>54. </b> The SPG stated that the UK was “highly unlikely to be able to deploy a conventional </p>
<p>land force through Turkey”. If the UK wanted to contribute land forces which would meet </p>
<p>the US planning timetable, a reassessment of the force packages was necessary.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The paper recorded that early work on a “Winning Concept” had “illustrated” that </p>
<p>a military campaign to achieve the UK’s strategic goals would need to be “quick and </p>
<p>successful”. The uncertainty over Turkey raised questions about whether the military </p>
<p>plan would be able to achieve the effects in the North which the SPG considered </p>
<p>remained central to delivering a winning concept. If they were not achieved, forces </p>
<p>operating in the South were “likely to be at greater risk” of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>chemical warfare (CW)/biological warfare (BW) attack;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>stiffer conventional resistance; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>potential unconventional operations/civilian resistance.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> The preferred role for the UK in the South would be to provide a “relief in place  </p>
<p>for US forces in the early phases of a campaign” to release US combat forces to fulfil </p>
<p>other tasks.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> In the time available, the UK could generate four possible force packages:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Amphibious Task Group (ATG);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ATG and an armoured brigade;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ATG and a light brigade; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ATG and both an armoured and a light brigade.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The SPG advised that, if the UK committed to a southern option over and above the </p>
<p>ATG, it would “demonstrate UK commitment to all phases” of an operation and “crucially </p>
<p>in the aftermath”. That would provide Ministers with “additional leverage” in the planning </p>
<p>phases. Further commitment to US planning and operational effort would make UK </p>
<p>forces “integral to success in current US concept”. The UK would, therefore, “gain a </p>
<p>potential veto, but exercising it would strain UK/US relations for some time to come”.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> The SPG also stated that US combat power would deliver military success, but </p>
<p>strategic victory would be “successful delivery of aftermath and limiting unintended </p>
<p>consequences”.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Adopting a southern option had the potential to:</p>
<p>“Provide UK with leading role in key areas of Iraq (free of Kurdish political risks) </p>
<p>in aftermath, and thus provide leverage in aftermath planning efforts, especially </p>
<p>related to:</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Humanitarian effort</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Reconstruction of key infrastructure</p>
<p>– </p>
<p>Future control and distribution of Iraqi oil.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>396</p>
<p><b>61. </b> The advantages of three brigades operating in the South included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “more balanced and robust formation, able to respond independently  </p>
<p>to changes in the tactical situation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Increased military influence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Reduction in probable need for high intensity warfighting”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Shorter and less complex lines of communication (LoC) than concurrent UK </p>
<p>operations in the North and South.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A reduced requirement for Combat Support (CS)/Combat Service Support </p>
<p>(CSS).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Early establishment of a discrete AOR and less demanding command and </p>
<p>control.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “opportunity to exercise command” in a discrete southern AOR.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces would no longer be “required to manoeuvre alongside digitised  </p>
<p>US formations”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would allow a “balanced transition to Phase IV”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Less demanding command and control and the UK would be unlikely to </p>
<p>need to call on UK resources from the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC) </p>
<p>Headquarters.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> The disadvantages identified included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no detailed UK operational planning and more information was </p>
<p>required on threat and scale of tasks “eg Basra”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The timeline would be “very demanding” with “no margin for error”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade was not yet included in the UOR requests.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be no time for many elements of the land force to complete </p>
<p>in-theatre training or integration prior to commitment to action. That was </p>
<p>described as challenging and carrying considerable risk, but it was deemed  </p>
<p>to be “acceptable”.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Adoption of the southern option would mean:</p>
<p>“UK will have made an early commitment to aftermath that will probably demand  </p>
<p>a commitment for a number of years. This would be hard to avoid in any event, and </p>
<p>engagement in South offers significant advantages over possibly being fixed in North </p>
<p>with Kurds.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> The paper did not explicitly identify the risk of Shia unrest or Iran’s attitude to </p>
<p>Coalition Forces in southern Iraq.</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>397</p>
<p><b>65. </b> The SPG concluded:</p>
<p>“UK is at a strategic decision point … given the convergence of US military </p>
<p>preparation and timelines, continued Turkish prevarication, and the need to maintain </p>
<p>pressure on the Iraqi regime to deliver …</p>
<p>“From a review of all the factors the downside military risk of UK disengaging from </p>
<p>the Northern Land Option is outweighed by the upside benefits of the proposed </p>
<p>engagement in the South.”</p>
<p><b>66. </b> The SPG recommended that the Chiefs of Staff should agree Lt Gen Reith’s </p>
<p>recommendation for a force package to be deployed to the South.</p>
<p><b>67.  Adm Boyce directed that Ministerial approval should be sought for </b></p>
<p><b>Lt Gen Reith’s recommended option while noting that a formal request from the </b></p>
<p><b>US would be needed.</b></p>
<p><b>68. </b> At their meeting on 8 January, the Chiefs of Staff noted that there was still a need  </p>
<p>for the US formally to request that any UK ground forces be switched to the South.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Adm Boyce also observed that it was “inconceivable that the UK would not play  </p>
<p>a part in Phase IV operations, which could be enduring”. He added:</p>
<p>“There remained a need to test the plan as a winning concept, but against that </p>
<p>caveat … the plan recommended in the paper represented a sensible military option </p>
<p>with a valuable task, and that the option should be taken forward.”</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Other points made in the discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The shift in focus from North to South argued for the provision of a </p>
<p>comprehensive force package able to react to a wide range of tasks …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The plan was operationally sound but there were strategic implications that </p>
<p>would have to be considered. It was possible that UK forces would become a </p>
<p>lynchpin for the US campaign. This could place the UK in a difficult position … </p>
<p>conversely, the strategic influence it would offer the UK would be significant.”</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed Lt Gen Reith’s recommendations and selected the option </p>
<p>of deploying the Divisional HQ and three brigades. Ministerial approval would be sought </p>
<p>in two stages:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a submission seeking approval to make the necessary forces available and  </p>
<p>to deploy certain enabling elements; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a further approval to deploy the main force and to release 16 Air Assault Brigade </p>
<p>from Op FRESCO.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>398</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Lt Gen Reith advised:</p>
<p>“Phase IV would need to begin at the same time as any offensive operations. </p>
<p>There was a need for PJHQ to take ownership of Phase IV planning, which should </p>
<p>include OGD [other government department] input. The US were standing up JTF- 4 </p>
<p>[Joint Task Force 4, the post-conflict planning unit in CENTCOM], which would be </p>
<p>responsible for US Phase IV planning; UK staff were to be embedded.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Co-ordination of Phase IV planning from mid-January is addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Reporting on the meeting to Mr Straw’s Private Office, Mr William Ehrman, FCO </p>
<p>Director General Defence and Intelligence,</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> recorded that he had stressed:</p>
<p>“… there should be no assumption of a political decision to authorise force in </p>
<p>the near future … If Ministers agreed the deployment proposed, it needed to be </p>
<p>clear that it was part of force on mind, and it should not set sail with a use it or </p>
<p>lose it presumption. Sustainability needed to be in any plan … Chiefs accepted </p>
<p>these points.”</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of OD Sec, reported the discussion to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The military planning assumed a “decision date of 15 February and the start of </p>
<p>hostilities in very early March”. The UK was being offered an amphibious role at the start </p>
<p>of hostilities. Thereafter, US forces would move north while the UK “took on stabilisation </p>
<p>of a southern sector which would eventually include Basra”.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Mr Bowen concluded:</p>
<p>“While we are now getting more clarity about the shape of US military intentions  </p>
<p>in an attack on Iraq, and the potential UK role, precious little thought has gone into </p>
<p>aftermath planning … if the UK is to take on an area of responsibility for stabilisation </p>
<p>operations, a lot of preparatory work is needed urgently. MOD have in mind to </p>
<p>engage … FCO, DFID &amp; DTI [Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for </p>
<p>International Development and the Department for Trade and Industry] on this.”</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Sir David Manning sent Mr Bowen’s report to Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of </p>
<p>Staff. Sir David wrote that he had asked Adm Boyce to cover the issues when he briefed </p>
<p>Mr Blair – with the Chiefs of Staff – the following week. Mr John Scarlett, the Chairman </p>

<p><b>MOD advice to No.10 on deployment to the South</b></p>
<p><b>80.  The MOD alerted No.10 on 8 January to the proposed deployments to the </b></p>
<p><b>South, which would be crucial to the US plan.</b></p>
<p><b>81.  Addressing the perceived advantages and disadvantages, the MOD stated </b></p>
<p><b>that the South offered a high profile role which was achievable within US timelines </b></p>
<p><b>and offered the UK a significant voice in US decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>82.  The disadvantages included the impact on the US if the UK subsequently </b></p>
<p><b>decided not to participate in military operations.</b></p>
<p><b>83. </b> A letter from Mr Hoon’s Private Office to Sir David Manning on 8 January reported </p>
<p>the US proposal and the potential roles in the South for UK forces.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>84. </b> The MOD advised that the US judged time was too short to deploy both a US and </p>
<p>UK division through Turkey and that: “Inevitably the US priority” was to “keep alive  </p>
<p>the possibility of deploying their own division … to maintain the strategic benefit of a </p>
<p>northern axis”.</p>
<p><b>85. </b> After describing the proposed roles for three brigades, the MOD stated:</p>
<p>“On a first reading, there are a number of attractions. This would be a high-profile </p>
<p>role for UK ground forces at the beginning of any campaign, in an area in which </p>
<p>the threat (barring WMD use) is likely to be limited. When combined with the offer </p>
<p>of US logistic support … this has the potential to allow a significant reduction in the </p>
<p>overall number of Reservists we might require. Our initial assessment suggests </p>
<p>that we could achieve deployment within current US timelines, and sustain such </p>
<p>a force in theatre potentially for some time, allowing political flexibility over timing. </p>
<p>The proposed UK role in the South should enable US forces to reach further, </p>
<p>faster, whilst providing a coherent transition to aftermath operations – an area of </p>
<p>acknowledged UK expertise – in territory captured early in the campaign. It would </p>
<p>demonstrate at the very beginning of ground operations that this is a Coalition, </p>
<p>rather than a US-only, campaign …</p>
<p>“On the other hand, there may be some disadvantages. The proposed UK role </p>
<p>would be crucial to the US plan in the South. Whilst this would give us a significant </p>
<p>voice in decision-making, it would also increase the military impact on the US on </p>
<p>any eventual UK decision not to participate in an operation: clearly, this would </p>
<p>place us in a very awkward position if the US seemed likely to want to proceed in </p>

<p>circumstances with which we were not content … Wider questions about the overall </p>
<p>US plan still need to be answered, particularly as long as their ability to achieve </p>
<p>the necessary strategic effect in the North remains uncertain. And we need to look </p>
<p>further at the detail of what is proposed, before reaching a firm view on its military </p>
<p>and political merits.”</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The plan assumed a “final UK Divisional Area of Responsibility, including for </p>
<p>aftermath operations would be an area bounded by the Iraq/Kuwait border in the south, </p>
<p>Jalibah airfield in the west, the Euphrates in the north, and the Shatt al-Arab waterway  </p>
<p>in the east – a largely Shia area of some 1,600 sq km.”</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The MOD said further advice would follow “next week”. In the meantime, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>had authorised the release from Op FRESCO of some units from 16 Air Assault Brigade, </p>
<p>and other measures, “to keep military options open”.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> At Cabinet on 9 January, Mr Hoon told his colleagues that no decisions had been </p>
<p>taken to launch military action.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Nor had the US finalised its military planning. Some </p>
<p>changes to forces assigned to Op FRESCO, to provide an emergency fire-fighting </p>
<p>capability during the firefighters’ strike, would be necessary to keep options open.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the future behaviour of Saddam Hussein in responding </p>
<p>to UN pressure was “unpredictable”. The UK was “right to continue with its military </p>
<p>preparations”. It should also maintain the focus on the fight with international terrorism </p>
<p>and preventive measures at home. Media reports of a rift within the Cabinet were </p>
<p>“nonsense”. Cabinet the following week would “provide the opportunity for an in-depth </p>
<p>discussion of Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry that “the </p>
<p>presentation to … Cabinet was still – nothing was inevitable. We are pressing the UN </p>
<p>option. No decisions on military action, whereas you can see that, at another level,  </p>
<p>the decisions on military action were hardening up quite considerably.”</p>

<p><b>if the UK failed to participate in a US-led military operation.</b></p>
<p><b>92. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Mr Hoon on 14 January drawing out how the US “would </p>

<p> While it was “unwise to attempt to calibrate precisely” </p>
<p>21 </p>

<p>it was “reasonable to expect that there would be significant damage”. This would be </p>
<p>greater than if the UK had behaved like some other countries.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> Sir Kevin feared:</p>
<p>“… that having valued profoundly the way we have stood shoulder-to-shoulder with </p>

<p><b>95. </b> Sir Kevin concluded that:</p>

<p>military intervention could have a “benign outcome”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there would be advantages from “being there at the outset”; and</p>

<p>Phase IV, the UK was adopting a twin track approach: the FCO and Cabinet Office </p>
<p>were leading the top-down strand, and PJHQ was leading the bottom up effort. The </p>
<p>challenge which lay ahead was matching the two pieces of work … The UK concept </p>
<p>at the strategic level was to develop a model that could be offered to the US. It was </p>
<p>assessed that the US was still working to an unrealistic assumption that their forces </p>
<p>would be ‘welcomed with open arms’ by the Iraqi people during Phase IV operations, </p>
<p>and there was an opportunity for the UK to lead the aftermath debate.”</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Major General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations (Operations) </p>
<p>(DCJO(O)), gave the Chiefs of Staff an oral update on the land package and plan,  </p>
<p>air basing options and targeting issues.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>104. </b> The Chiefs of Staff were told that the plan would not be finalised until after  </p>
<p>Major General Robin Brims, General Officer Commanding (GOC) 1 (UK) Div, had met </p>
<p>US commanders, which was likely to be at the end of January. They agreed that the </p>
<p>“specified” tasks would be “uncontentious and achievable”.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The Chiefs of Staff also noted that the UK AO “was a disproportionately important </p>
<p>piece of real estate”.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> In his report to Sir David Manning, Mr Bowen stated that the meeting had </p>
<p>discussed the current state of planning “at length”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> He wrote that the tasks for the  </p>
<p>UK forces were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The initial “clearance” of the al-Faw Peninsula and the “opening” of Umm Qasr </p>
<p>port.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade would then secure the allocated </p>
<p>area of responsibility.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “capture” of Basra “was not part of the Division’s task”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “weight of the initial air attack would be designed to shock the Iraqi </p>

<p>Maj Gen Fry.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> The briefing for Mr Blair from Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary </p>

<p>a minute to Mr Lee commissioning further work on the issues so that the MOD would be </p>
<p>able to respond to No.10 “by the end of the month”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>125. </b> The Secretary to the Chiefs of Staff Committee (SECCOS) produced a record </p>
<p>of the discussion, circulated within the MOD on 22 January, which was described as </p>

<p>36</p>
<p><b>127.  Adm Boyce advised Mr Blair that the military plan would work.</b></p>
<p><b>128.  There was no recorded discussion of either the risks of the amphibious </b></p>
<p><b>operation in the initial phase of an attack or the readiness of UK forces.</b></p>
<p><b>129. </b> Adm Boyce’s briefing notes identified that the US had seen “UK participation as </p>
<p>essential from the outset”.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> The US had “accommodated our constraints at every turn </p>
<p>to ensure we are part of their coalition and to guarantee a serious military task for our </p>
<p>forces. In fact, the current plan … makes them a <b>lynchpin crucial to success of the </b></p>
<p><b>overall plan</b>.” The UK would, however, rely heavily on US enabling assets.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> A “convincing, coherent military build-up” leaving Saddam Hussein in no doubt </p>
<p>about the consequences of non-compliance with UNSCR 1441 (“<b>force on mind</b>”) was </p>
<p>the best way of applying pressure.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Gen Franks was working to produce a “loaded and cocked” winning capability from </p>
<p>15 February with the US able to commence an air campaign and some ground offensive </p>
<p>operations (possibly including the UK) from 3 March and the main effort starting within </p>
<p>two weeks on 19 March, although the US was looking to bring that forward.</p>
<p><b>132. </b> The UK’s interest was to be “ready to engage from the outset”, and the briefing </p>
<p>stated that US “timelines” had driven the UK’s. If the UK was to match the US timetable, </p>
<p>the MOD would need permission by 17 January to be ready to start deploying land force </p>
<p>equipment from 24 January. The deployment to the Gulf would add 3,000 miles to their </p>
<p>journey and port access in Kuwait would be limited.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Blair was advised that the UK could maintain its ability to use the forces </p>
<p>deployed for six months, but if they were not used it could then take up to a year before </p>
<p>they would be in a position to take action.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>406</p>
<p><b>134. </b> Mr Blair was reported to have said that he hoped that it “won’t come to this” and </p>
<p>that this “will happen mid-February to early March”. Mr Blair’s final comment was that </p>
<p>this was the “best chance we have got”; it was his “strong view that we wouldn’t be </p>
<p>looking much past the end of February before seeing this take place”.</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Adm Boyce’s briefing notes identified “two essential points” in relation to whether </p>
<p>or not the US had a winning concept:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need for Saddam Hussein to believe that force would be overwhelming  </p>
<p>and that he could not survive in power, while, in parallel, giving genuine hope  </p>
<p>to Iraqis who opposed his regime that an end was possible.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition military action would need to be “swift” to avoid a “drawn out campaign </p>
<p>… becoming <b>a battle of attrition conducted against backdrop of dwindling </b></p>
<p><b>public support</b>”; to prevent Saddam using “<b>spoiling tactics</b> such as use  </p>
<p>of WMD, or causing an ecological disaster by torching the oil fields”; and  </p>
<p>“<b>to minimise the risk of unintended consequences</b>”.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Adm Boyce’s briefing notes offered no indication of the MOD’s view on whether  </p>
<p>the objectives could be met.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> The PJHQ record of the meeting reported that Mr Blair had asked “will it  </p>
<p>[the military plan] work?”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Adm Boyce “stated that it would”; he had increasing confidence in the plan “since </p>
<p>TU [Turkey] had become more engaged in discussions” about allowing US forces to </p>
<p>attack from the north.</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Asked whether success would be the collapse of the Iraqi regime or the fall  </p>
<p>of Baghdad:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce was reported to have explained to Mr Blair “the problem of </p>
<p>‘catastrophic success’ whereby the regime collapsed at the very outset” before </p>
<p>the Coalition was ready.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s view was reported to have been that the media would view the fall of </p>
<p>Baghdad as the culmination of military operations.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> PJHQ also reported that Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>focused on the importance of a simultaneous air and ground campaign; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asked about the cohesion of the regime and its chances of maintaining control.</p>
<p><b>141.  Mr Blair was concerned about the implications if Saddam Hussein sought to </b></p>
<p><b>put in place a “Fortress Baghdad” strategy and possible pre-emptive use of WMD.</b></p>

<p>407</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Blair was concerned about the plans in place if Saddam Hussein retreated to </p>
<p>Baghdad.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Mr Blair asked for further advice on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>which Coalition Forces were expected to reach Baghdad, and how quickly;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a full analysis of the risk that Saddam Hussein would concentrate on  </p>
<p>“Fortress Baghdad”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an account of how the US planned to deal with that if it arose; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what they would do if there was inter-communal fighting in the city.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>144. </b> In addition to the defence of Baghdad, Iraqi use of WMD and burning the oilfields </p>
<p>were discussed as some of the worst outcomes of military action, and that “planning  </p>
<p>was well advanced to counter” both those contingencies.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>145. </b> In response to his question about the chances of Saddam Hussein using WMD, </p>
<p>Mr Blair was told that “intelligence left no ambiguity over Saddam’s willingness to use </p>
<p>WMD if he judged the time was right, but that as his WMD were currently concealed </p>
<p>from the UNMOVIC [United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission] </p>
<p>it would take some time for it to be constituted ready for action.”</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Air Marshal Sir Joe French, Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI), stated that the </p>
<p>Coalition’s ability to detect Iraqi preparations in relation to theatre ballistic missiles was </p>
<p>“good, and such detections would likely trigger operations”.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Mr Blair asked:</p>
<p>“… military planners to test further their predictions of Saddam’s likely responses to </p>
<p>attack, and how we would counter them. In particular, this should cover Saddam’s </p>
<p>possible pre-emptive use of WMD …”</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Mr Blair was reported to have asked for: “Contingency plans to be developed to </p>
<p>counter potential ‘unexpected consequences’.”</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Hoon subsequently asked that the work on predicting Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>possible responses to military action should be taken forward in the context of a </p>
<p>comprehensive “red teaming” of the military plan to identify all conceivable risks to  </p>
<p>its success.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>150. </b> The first report of the “Red Team” set up by the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>408</p>
<p><b>151.  Mr Blair and Mr Hoon were concerned about the impact of the air campaign </b></p>
<p><b>and the need to minimise casualties.</b></p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Hoon were told that the campaign would depend on “immediate </p>
<p>effect” rather than “weight of effort”.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr Blair was concerned about the scale of the bombing campaign on Baghdad  </p>
<p>and the risk of collateral damage and civilian casualties.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> The briefing acknowledged </p>
<p>that the intensity of the campaign “raised difficult issues over political control of the </p>
<p>targeting process”.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> The PJHQ record noted that, “interestingly”, it was Mr Hoon who had urged </p>
<p>Mr Blair “to exercise a degree of restraint” on President Bush, whom Mr Hoon had </p>
<p>“described as ‘going for it’”.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> Mr Hoon was concerned to ensure that there was no </p>
<p>“irreversible damage” to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Hoon were also concerned that “destruction of Iraq’s </p>
<p>communications infrastructure could reduce the speed at which the population </p>
<p>assimilated the hopelessness of resistance, and that hard-core elements could fight </p>
<p>on autonomously”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> The Coalition would “need to consider how news of the regime’s </p>
<p>collapse would flow quickly through the country”.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Blair was concerned to ensure that bombing targets were proportionate and </p>
<p>chosen to minimise civilian casualties, and asked to see a list of targets which UK air </p>
<p>forces might be asked to attack, with a commentary on their military importance and risk </p>
<p>of casualties.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Forwarding that request to Mr Lee, Mr Watkins added a requirement to provide a </p>
<p>list of targets “which would be attacked by [US] aircraft operating from Diego Garcia (or </p>
<p>other UK airfields) or with other UK support”.</p>

<p>409</p>
<p><b>160. </b> The PJHQ record provided the fullest account of the discussion of post-conflict </p>
<p>issues. Issues raised by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>“Worst Case. The PM wanted to know what CDS thought was the worst case </p>
<p>scenario. After much discussion about destroying the oil infrastructure, use of WMD </p>
<p>and hunkering down in Baghdad and fighting it out, it was felt that the worst case </p>
<p>was internecine fighting between Sunni and Shia, as well as the Kurds/Turks/Iraqis.</p>
<p>“Aftermath. This led on to a general discussion on aftermath, with the PM asking </p>
<p>what the Iraqi view on it was. CDS stated that the thinking on this issue was </p>
<p>‘woolly’ at this stage, with work only just beginning. The PM stated that the ‘Issue’ </p>
<p>was aftermath – the Coalition must prevent anarchy and internecine fighting </p>
<p>breaking out.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Blair asked the MOD to look at three things:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to be clear on what we are offering the Iraqi people and senior </p>
<p>members of the regime (those below the top 100 on the list</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>) – removal of the </p>
<p>senior hierarchy or minimising resistance or what?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Aftermath. We have to develop a feasible plan.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Look at the unexpected – think through the big ‘what ifs’; oil, WMD, internecine </p>
<p>fighting – and develop a strategy.”</p>
<p><b>162. </b> The author of the PJHQ record added some “personal observations”, including:</p>
<p>“The PM came across as someone with strong convictions that this should, and </p>
<p>will, go ahead. He accepted the military advice being given to him, although he still </p>
<p>sought reassurance that all aspects had been looked into and that plans are drawn </p>
<p>up to deal with the unexpected or perceived worse cases. It is clear from the three </p>
<p>areas that he asked further work to be done on that the Phase IV part of the plan </p>
<p>is critical.”</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Blair also asked for further advice on the outcome of the post-conflict talks </p>
<p>scheduled for Washington the following week, given the need for “much greater clarity </p>
<p>about US intentions” for the aftermath of a military operation.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Watkins told Mr Lee:</p>
<p>“… we will clearly need to use all our regular contacts with the US, in both </p>

<p>The Inquiry has not seen any indication of what was meant by “the top 100 on the list”. It is likely that </p>

<p>52</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The subsequent advice and discussions on post-conflict issues are addressed  </p>
<p>in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Asked whether Ministers were given a paper or briefing on the operational risks </p>
<p>and what might go wrong, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Certainly as far as the defence Ministers were concerned, they were aware of what </p>
<p>our plans were and what the pluses and where might be the pinch points on any </p>
<p>plan and what we were doing to ensure those were mitigated as far as possible.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Asked how the risks had been described to Ministers, Lord Boyce replied:</p>
<p>“… it would have been done in the normal sort of way. You would have done threat </p>
<p>assessments, worked out what the potential opposition forces might be, their </p>
<p>dispositions, what our capability was matched against that. Some of the risk … was </p>
<p>mitigated by the fact that we were going to be operating in our own area … while the </p>
<p>American forces drove for Baghdad …</p>
<p>“There were additional problems … for example, the importance of making a very </p>

<p><b>168. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that a “full briefing” had been provided to Ministers </p>
<p>“as to whether there was indeed a winning concept now”; subject to the resolution of </p>
<p>questions on the legal base and post-conflict issues.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Sir Kevin added that issues such as managing targeting to minimise the risks to </p>
<p>civilians and intensive fighting within Baghdad, “were considered very carefully”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Asked how the various risks had been highlighted to Ministers, Gen Reith told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that PJHQ had “produced various papers, looking at each aspect in terms of </p>
<p>risk”, including casualty predictions.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that there had been “a growing and … demonstrable </p>
<p>requirement for something that could act as a flank guard to American … manoeuvre”, </p>
<p>and the “lack of … combat power” resulting from the decision to hold the US 4th Infantry </p>
<p>Division in the Mediterranean had “created an opportunity into which British forces </p>
<p>subsequently fitted”.</p>

<p><b>172. </b> Asked to explain why the force levels had grown and were larger than had been </p>
<p>deployed in 1991, Lord Boyce replied that he could not answer that question: “The </p>
<p>package was being shaped to deal with the task that we thought we might encounter.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>173. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry that he had expressed concern to Mr Blair at the </p>
<p>briefing on 15 January, which “was more about the immediate aftermath, immediately </p>
<p>after the fighting phase, what would we need to do to provide security in the first </p>
<p>instance, but also to provide what we saw as being the most immediate problem would </p>
<p>be a humanitarian problem”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Sir Kevin thought that “the large-scale option was a natural consequence of what </p>
<p>we could do or what we would plan to do”. There was “also a military view about the </p>
<p>sense of critical mass under national command that works well, which would have been </p>
<p>a feature of the Chiefs’ of Staff considerations”. He did “not at all” sense “the military </p>
<p>machine was forcing the political hand”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p><b>175. </b> In his subsequent hearing, Sir Kevin Tebbit agreed that, when the decision was </p>
<p>taken, Ministers did not have “a full appreciation of the implications, politically, militarily </p>
<p>and security-wise”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>176.  Mr Scarlett subsequently reported additional aspects of PJHQ’s thinking to </b></p>

<p><b>177. </b> Mr Scarlett followed up some of the points raised at Mr Blair’s briefing from the </p>
<p>MOD in a separate briefing from Maj Gen Fry and reported his discussions to No.10.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>178. </b> The points Mr Scarlett recorded included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fact that “it will not be possible to disaggregate UK targeting from overall  </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The “difficulty for Saddam of matching up his CB [chemical biological] warheads </p>
<p>to missiles after previous efforts to conceal them” was “stressed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “certainly not clear … how Baghdad will be brought under control and </p>
<p>Saddam finished off”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maj Gen Fry “thought it very possible” that the US would “eventually” ask the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>Cabinet, 16 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>179.  As promised by Mr Blair on 19 December 2002 and 9 January 2003, Cabinet </b></p>
<p><b>discussed Iraq on 16 January 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>180.  Despite Mr Blair’s promise that military options would be discussed and the </b></p>
<p><b>imminence of the formal decision to offer a significant land contribution, Cabinet </b></p>
<p><b>was not briefed on the substance of the military options or the circumstances in </b></p>
<p><b>which force would be used.</b></p>
<p><b>181.  Cabinet did not discuss the strategic implications of making a military </b></p>
<p><b>contribution.</b></p>
<p><b>182. </b> Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… he wanted to make the United Nations route work. The inspectors … needed </p>
<p>time to achieve results … If Iraq was not complying with the demands of the United </p>
<p>Nations, he believed the … Security Council would pass a second resolution.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Blair subsequently stated:</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, British and American forces were being built up in the Gulf. If it came  </p>
<p>to conflict, it would be important for success to be achieved quickly. The build up was </p>
<p>having an effect on the Iraqi regime, with internal support dwindling for President </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein … The strategy remained to pursue the United Nations course.”</p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Blair concluded by telling Cabinet that he would be meeting President Bush  </p>
<p>to discuss Iraq at the end of the month, after Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council  </p>
<p>on 27 January.</p>
<p><b>185. </b> The discussion in Cabinet on 16 January of the wider policy is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 3.6.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that he:</p>
<p>“… wouldn’t have expected Cabinet to get into the business of land forces through </p>
<p>the north or the south … I think they would probably have recognised that that was </p>
<p>quintessentially the business of a smaller group. So none of them suggested a </p>
<p>serious change of direction.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>187. </b> In a statement for the Inquiry, Mr Hoon wrote that, to the best of his recollection, </p>
<p>Cabinet on 16 January:</p>
<p>“… was devoted entirely to the efforts to secure a second resolution, and was the </p>
<p>subject of an unusually wide-ranging discussion.”</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>413</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Blair had:</p>
<p>“… made it very clear that he wanted to focus all of his Government’s efforts on </p>
<p>securing that second resolution.”</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Hoon was:</p>
<p>“… quite confident at that stage that he [Mr Blair] would not have welcomed any </p>
<p>efforts to discuss the military options in relation to Iraq. In the absence of Prime </p>
<p>Ministerial agreement to such a discussion, it would not have taken place.”</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Mr Hoon wrote:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless because I thought colleagues should be aware at this juncture about </p>
<p>the military preparations under way, and because this had not been discussed at the </p>
<p>Cabinet meeting on 16 January on the second resolution, I arranged for a paper on </p>
<p>this subject to be circulated.”</p>
<p><b>191. </b> The absence of any collective discussion of the military options, despite Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>promises, is addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>192. </b> Mr Blair’s decision not to reveal that he had been advised that a further </p>
<p>determination by the Security Council that Iraq was in material breach of its obligations </p>
<p>would be required to authorise the revival of the authority to take military action,  </p>
<p>or to invite Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, to speak at Cabinet on 16 March,  </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>The decision to deploy ground forces, 17 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 16 January seeking agreement to the “key role in </p>
<p>southern Iraq” proposed by the US for the UK:</p>
<p>“Important questions remain to be resolved … But the role proposed for the UK is  </p>
<p>a sensible and significant one, and I recommend that with certain qualifications,  </p>
<p>we accept it. We need to decide quickly.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr Hoon added that equipment and personnel would need to be moved early the </p>
<p>following week and that, if Mr Blair agreed, he proposed:</p>
<p>“… to announce the composition and deployment of the force in an oral statement  </p>
<p>on Monday 20 January.”</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Hoon set out the proposed UK contribution as discussed in the briefing the </p>
<p>previous day, including that the provision of US logistic support would enable the UK to </p>
<p>“make compensating reductions in our force, which would number around 26,000 rather </p>
<p>than the 28,000 originally envisaged” for the deployment of a single armoured brigade </p>
<p>67 </p>
<p>Letter Hoon to Blair, 16 January 2003, ‘Iraq: UK Land Contribution’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p>through Turkey. He estimated that the requirement for Reservists was “unlikely to be </p>
<p>much above 3,000, compared to the 7-8,000 we originally expected”.</p>
<p><b>196. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the proposed role for the UK was “essentially as described in </p>
<p>my Office’s letter of 8 January”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“During initial US ground operations the ATG … would “conduct the Umm Qasr/</p>
<p>al-Faw operation as already planned.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Approximately ten days later HQ 1 [(UK)] Armoured Division with 16 Air Assault </p>
<p>Brigade would relieve US forces in an area south of Basra and the Euphrates, </p>
<p>including the Rumaylah oilfields, enabling the US to press on further north.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Whilst US forces conduct decisive ground operations to isolate Baghdad,  </p>
<p>HQ 1 [(UK)] Armoured Division with 7 Armoured Brigade could protect the right </p>
<p>flank of the US 1st Marine Expeditionary Force as it advances north. This would </p>
<p>include securing Basra International Airport and isolating (but not entering) </p>
<p>Basra itself.”</p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Hoon added that the US was looking at possible additional tasks, but the UK </p>
<p>would take a cautious approach: “We do not intend that our force should bite off more </p>
<p>than it can chew, given its reliance on US logistic support.”</p>
<p><b>198. </b> Mr Hoon stated that, as he and Mr Blair had discussed, a number of issues still </p>
<p>needed “finally to be resolved” before the UK could “conclude that the overall US plan </p>
<p>represent[ed] a winning concept”. Those included the “legal basis for any operation” </p>
<p>and the “credibility of plans for the aftermath”. The US was addressing the “strategic </p>
<p>importance of fixing Iraqi forces” in the North.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> The concept for the campaign was “radically different from that employed in the </p>
<p>1990-1991 Gulf Conflict”. It depended on “the achievement of overwhelming effect” </p>
<p>to attack the cohesion of the Iraqi regime and deterring opposition rather than the </p>
<p>“application of overwhelming force”. Much depended on achieving “shock and awe” at </p>
<p>the outset through the “application of largely US air power to targets throughout Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> Mr Hoon stated that the plan would need further development to address a </p>
<p>number of “specific challenges (oilfields, displaced persons, handling Iran etc.), but </p>
<p>no insurmountable problems have been identified”. The threat from conventional </p>
<p>Iraqi forces was assessed as “limited, in part because of the expected effects of US </p>
<p>air power”.</p>
<p><b>201. </b> The timescales for possible action would mean that some risk would have to be </p>
<p>taken on the fitting of Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR) equipment, but that risk </p>
<p>was “considered acceptable”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>415</p>
<p><b>202. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that:</p>
<p>“The proposed final [UK] Area of Responsibility is a coherent one with largely </p>
<p>natural geographical boundaries … and includes economic infrastructure critical to </p>
<p>Iraq’s future, including much of its oil reserves, critical communications nodes, a </p>
<p>city (Basra) of 1.3 million people and a port (Umm Qasr) the size of Southampton. </p>
<p>Although the establishment of UK control over this area will require careful </p>
<p>presentation to rebut any allegations of selfish motives, we will be playing a vital role </p>
<p>in shaping a better future for Iraq and its people.”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Map 3 in Annex 4 of the Report shows the proposed AOR and the effect of </p>
<p>subsequent decisions to expand.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Commenting on the point, originally made in the letter from his Private Office to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning on 8 January, that the UK’s proposed role would “make us even more </p>
<p>important to the US plan than we were before”, Mr Hoon wrote that was:</p>
<p>“… to some extent a double-edged sword. By making us more integral to the US </p>
<p>plan, it would add to the difficulties if US and UK intentions should diverge. But this </p>
<p>is a sharpening of an existing risk – bearing in mind US reliance on Diego Garcia,  </p>
<p>for instance – rather than the creation of a new one.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that Mr Blair had identified three big issues in the discussion the </p>
<p>previous day:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “nature of the proposition” that was being put “to the Iraqi people including </p>
<p>those in the governing apparatus who are not considered beyond the pale, and </p>
<p>the way in which that would be conveyed to them without damaging operational </p>
<p>security and losing the element of surprise”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need “now that we have a proposed Area of Responsibility” to work on that </p>
<p>“with greater clarity”. The forthcoming visit of a Whitehall team to Washington </p>
<p>(see Section 6.5) was identified as “an opportunity to mould US thinking”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making sure the UK had the “best possible contingency plans for worst-case </p>
<p>scenarios”.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Mr Hoon said he had put work in hand to address those issues.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> Mr Hoon set out the latest estimates for the costs of military operations and the </p>
<p>actions and timetable for implementation:</p>
<p>“CENTCOM assume that, unless Saddam changes his behaviour, a political decision </p>
<p>to take military action may be made in mid-February. Air and ground operations </p>
<p>could begin in early March, with the main effort by ground forces beginning in </p>
<p>mid- March (although they still aspire to bring the main effort forward).”</p>
<p><b>208. </b> The UK headquarters would need to be “deployed and readied in Kuwait … by </p>
<p>the end of January, 16 Air Assault Brigade by the beginning of March, and 7 Armoured </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p>Brigade by mid-March”. That would be followed by a period of Force Integration Training </p>
<p>– preparation and rehearsal alongside US forces – before they would be properly </p>
<p>prepared to conduct operations.</p>
<p><b>209. </b> Mr Hoon stated that the force package was “broadly what the media already </p>
<p>expect”, but the “high visibility of the measures involved” would “require a reasonably </p>
<p>candid explanation”. He set out the advantages of the “earliest possible announcement”.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Mr Hoon recommended that the UK should “inform the US that we agree that </p>
<p>planning should assume the contribution of the proposed UK land force package to carry </p>
<p>out the role the US has requested, subject to:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(i) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>the overall caveat that a further political decision would be required to commit </p>
<p>UK forces to any specific operation</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(ii) </p>
<p> </p>
<p>US assistance in facilitating the bed-down of UK forces, and provision of logistic </p>
<p>support</p>
<p> </p>
<p>(iii) </p>

<p><b>211. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to Mr Brown, Mr Straw and Sir Andrew Turnbull.</p>
<p><b>212. </b> The UK’s assessment of Iraq’s conventional military capability and decisions on </p>
<p>targeting are addressed later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>213. </b> The risks taken on procurement of equipment and its deployment to the front line </p>
<p>are addressed in Section 6.3.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> The absence of advice on what might constitute a satisfactory plan for the </p>

<p>made on the scope or duration of their post-conflict role is addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>215.  On 17 January, Mr Blair agreed the deployment of large scale UK ground </b></p>
<p><b>forces, comprising the HQ 1 (UK) Div and three combat brigades.</b></p>
<p><b>216. </b> Commenting on Mr Hoon’s letter to Mr Blair, Sir David Manning wrote:</p>

<p>70</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Mr Straw advised that:</p>
<p>“… much greater clarity is required about US thinking and plans for the aftermath. </p>
<p>How long would UK forces be expected to stay in the area of responsibility proposed </p>
<p>for them? What would be their role in what form of administration, not least in </p>
<p>Basra …? We need in particular far greater clarity on US thinking on management </p>
<p>of the oilfields. As you know, we have sizeable differences of view from many </p>
<p>in the US Administration who envisage Iraq being a US military governorate for </p>
<p>an extended period of time. A UK team will be discussing this issue with the US </p>
<p>next week. It will be putting hard questions, and highlighting our own view that </p>
<p>there needs to be a move to UN administration, with Coalition Forces remaining </p>
<p>responsible for security, as soon as possible.”</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair:</p>

<p><b>232. </b> Mr Hoon stated that it was “a high readiness, balanced and flexible force package, </p>
<p>bringing together a wide range of capabilities”; and that he and the Chiefs of Staff were </p>
<p>“confident” that it was “the right group of forces for the tasks that may be necessary”.</p>
<p><b>233. </b> Mr Hoon concluded that none of the steps being taken represented “a commitment </p>
<p>of British forces to specific military action”, and that:</p>
<p>“A decision to employ force has not been taken, nor is such a decision imminent or </p>
<p>inevitable. I must also emphasise … that the deployment of forces on this scale is  </p>
<p>no ordinary measure.</p>
<p>“While we want Saddam Hussein to disarm voluntarily, it is evident that we will not </p>
<p>achieve that unless we continue to present him with a clear and credible threat of </p>
<p>force. That is why I have announced these deployments, in support of the diplomatic </p>
<p>process to which we remain fully committed. It is not too late for Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>to recognise the will of the international community and respect United Nations </p>
<p>resolutions. Let us hope that he does so.”</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Hoon declined to provide any further details of the planning for military action.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> In response to a question about post-conflict planning, Mr Hoon stated: “Certainly </p>
<p>consideration is being given to aftermath issues and the question of humanitarian relief. </p>
<p>Obviously, we will design force packages to ensure that we have soldiers in place who </p>
<p>can deal with those issues as and when they arise.”</p>

<p><b>The absence of collective Ministerial consideration of the decision to </b></p>

<p><b>236.  The proposal to deploy UK ground forces to southern Iraq constituted a step </b></p>
<p><b>change in the UK contribution to the US plan and made it critical to the success  </b></p>
<p><b>of the military campaign.</b></p>
<p><b>237.  Mr Hoon’s letter of 16 January seeking agreement to the deployment was </b></p>
<p><b>sent to Mr Brown, Mr Straw and Sir Andrew Turnbull.</b></p>
<p><b>238.  It did not, however, address the wider implications of the decision for </b></p>
<p><b>Cabinet colleagues.</b></p>
<p><b>239.  It was clear, from the discussions on 15 January and Mr Hoon’s advice to </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Blair of 16 January, that committing UK forces was likely to mean that the UK </b></p>
<p><b>would become responsible, as the Occupying Power in the immediate aftermath </b></p>
<p><b>of military operations, for a significant area of southern Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>240.  That would have implications for the responsibilities of the FCO and DFID.</b></p>

<p><b>243.  Nor, despite it being a decision which was likely to have major implications </b></p>
<p><b>for the UK lasting many years, was there a collective Ministerial discussion before </b></p>
<p><b>the decision was taken.</b></p>
<p><b>244.  Nor was Cabinet informed of the proposals and given an opportunity to </b></p>
<p><b>discuss them before the decision was announced.</b></p>
<p><b>245.  Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that he had advised Mr Hoon, in either late </b></p>
<p><b>December 2002 or early January 2003, that it would be timely to take stock of UK </b></p>
<p><b>policy in the light of concerns, including:</b></p>

<p><b>the implications of a bigger military role in the South; and</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>planning for post-conflict Iraq was not robust.</b></p>

<p>is addressed earlier in this Section.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Sir Kevin told the Inquiry in December 2009 that:</p>
<p>“… by … the end of 2002 – when it is becoming clear that the northern option wasn’t </p>
<p>going to work and we might take a bigger role in the South, and, therefore, the </p>
<p>stakes for the UK would be greater, at that stage it wasn’t entirely clear whether  </p>
<p>we were going to achieve all of our conditions …</p>
<p>“I certainly discussed these issues very fully with … [Mr Hoon] as to whether this </p>
<p>was indeed the right point to take broader stock of where we were going and make </p>
<p>absolutely certain that the Government was satisfied with the course. Not to say </p>
<p>that I wasn’t, it is just [to say] that I felt it was quite important for Ministers to be </p>
<p>absolutely clear … what the prospects might be.”</p>

<p>421</p>
<p><b>249. </b> In subsequent evidence to the Inquiry in February 2010, Sir Kevin added that the </p>
<p>shift to the South, which “took place progressively” from mid-December to mid-January </p>
<p>2003, “was a very significant shift” and he had “felt that it was important to reappraise, </p>
<p>to pause, to take stock as to what was going on”.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>250. </b> Sir Kevin told the Inquiry that he had “certainly” written to Mr Hoon; and that he </p>
<p>thought he had written “a personal note” which he had been unable to find before the </p>
<p>hearing. That had expressed his:</p>
<p>“… concerns that we were … being led into a possible military action, where we </p>
<p>might not actually have secured our objectives; in other words, we wouldn’t have </p>
<p>disarmed Saddam by the diplomatic route. We might not get a second resolution. </p>
<p>We hadn’t got post-conflict planning as well pinned down with the United States  </p>
<p>as any of us wanted at that stage.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Asked if he had had a response, Sir Kevin stated that he had “discussed this”  </p>
<p>with Mr Hoon and he thought they “were very much of one mind that this did need to  </p>
<p>be thought through very carefully”.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p><b>252. </b> Sir Kevin told the Inquiry that Mr Hoon had asked him to produce a “note on the </p>
<p>transatlantic relationship”:</p>
<p>“One of the issues at that stage was that we had gone so far, by the end of </p>
<p>December, with the United States in planning – not just because we wanted to </p>
<p>be with the United States, but because I knew the Government believed in what </p>
<p>it was doing – that to have gone back at that point and decided not to proceed in </p>
<p>circumstances where we hadn’t disarmed Saddam … would have been particularly </p>
<p>difficult for our relationship with the United States.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Asked whether at that stage there was no going back and no room for </p>
<p>reassessment, Sir Kevin replied:</p>
<p>“There was never an unconditional commitment at all. I think that when one begins </p>
<p>to engage in military planning, one takes a risk that, if one doesn’t see it through </p>
<p>in a way that was designed to achieve the effect of disarming Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>diplomatically, or the use of force …”</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>254. </b> Sir Kevin added that, if the UK had backed down “without any of those conditions </p>
<p>being met”, that would have carried “its own damage”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>255. </b> In the context of securing the UK’s strategic objectives, Sir Kevin told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that his concern in his advice to Mr Hoon in December:</p>
<p>“… was the risk, as one feels in one’s dark moments, that maybe we are not going </p>
<p>to get any of these criteria achieved. It wasn’t looking as if Saddam was going to </p>
<p>back down and really comply. It wasn’t looking as if the Americans were not going </p>
<p>to pursue the military course if compliance failed. There was a clear sense of </p>
<p>impatience, I think in Washington.</p>
<p>“The planning for post-conflict didn’t seem to me to be very robust …</p>
<p>“So those concerns were ones which led me to say to … [Mr Hoon] at the point </p>
<p>when we were also not going to get our northern option and were moving to a </p>
<p>southern one, which seemed to me to be very significant, that this is the time to </p>
<p>reappraise and to think hard before going forward. It wasn’t that I was against going </p>
<p>forward.”</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>256. </b> Asked whether, by January 2003, it was too late to reappraise the position because </p>
<p>the UK was committed politically to the US and military preparations were going into </p>
<p>high gear, Sir Kevin replied that he did not “think it was too late”.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Sir Kevin added:</p>
<p>“… by the end of 2002, not to have proceeded … without … very strong reasons, </p>
<p>such as Saddam … actually meeting the conditions, would have given us a real </p>
<p>problem …</p>
<p>“… [H]aving indicated an intention, with conditions, to work with the United States </p>
<p>on the military track, to have gone back on that point would have carried risks </p>
<p>and doubts.”</p>
<p><b>258. </b> In May 2010, Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… by Christmas 2002/3, I was very concerned that the penalties of breaking </p>
<p>with the Americans, even if our conditions were not fully met, were going to be </p>
<p>very severe.”</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>259. </b> Asked about the penalties, Sir Kevin replied:</p>
<p>“I think the penalties of having gone so far by that stage on a joint venture … were </p>
<p>very awkward … I felt it would be helpful for Ministers to pause around January in </p>
<p>2002/3, when we were being presented with a completely different plan, and when </p>
<p>it wasn’t clear necessarily that our conditions were going to be met, that there was </p>
<p>a risk that the Americans might proceed without a second resolution, which we </p>

<p>regarded as absolutely essential. There was a risk that Saddam wasn’t going to </p>
<p>disarm. There was a risk that we were not going to get the broad Coalition that we </p>
<p>wanted, and I … felt at that stage it was quite important to consider all the issues, </p>
<p>including the cost of not proceeding with the Americans.”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Sir Kevin stated that he was “reconstructing events on the basis of personal </p>
<p>recollection”.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> He had:</p>
<p>“… recorded my concerns and the message was very clear: we need to work </p>
<p>harder at making sure our conditions are fully understood and taken up by the </p>
<p>US Administration.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry in February 2010 that he thought Ministers had  </p>
<p>had a discussion about the issues, but he was “not sure about the detail”.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Asked whether he had seen a point at which the Government at the most senior </p>
<p>decision-making levels had fully reviewed and thrashed out the whole range of its </p>
<p>options, Sir Kevin Tebbit replied that he “never saw that process taking place” and that </p>
<p>he was not “party to those discussions in No.10”.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Sir Kevin added that, in the second half of January, he had sensed “that was  </p>
<p>the point when Ministers were coming to major decision point”, and “it was also the  </p>
<p>point where Hoon was recommending the southern option to Government”. His </p>
<p>“understanding was that there was a pretty full discussion”.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p><b>264. </b> In May 2010, Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Over Christmas I recall being concerned that … suddenly we were looking at  </p>
<p>a different option, the South, which we hadn’t been planning for.</p>
<p>“… I was very concerned before things went further it would be very good for </p>
<p>Ministers to sit down and really discuss this fully … I wrote my concerns to </p>
<p>Geoff Hoon in a private note, manuscript … advising him that I really thought he </p>
<p>ought to talk to his colleagues … and look at it in the round again and pause. I </p>
<p>was very concerned that the machine seemed to be moving, and I don’t just mean </p>
<p>the military machine. I just mean the process seemed to be going on without a full </p>
<p>Ministerial discussion.</p>
<p>“Geoff Hoon said to me … I understand, I think that’s very important. He said, I just </p>
<p>want a note from you on one aspect, and that is the US/UK relationship and the </p>
<p>implications of not proceeding, how important is this to us in bilateral terms. So  </p>
<p>I wrote him a note purely on that issue, as a sort of aide memoire, for one part  </p>

<p>of the discussion he was going to have with his colleagues. Looking at the record, </p>
<p>it looks as if that’s the only thing I was bothered about, and that gives a slightly </p>
<p>misleading impression.</p>
<p>“I think he did have those discussions with colleagues. The record is not entirely </p>
<p>clear, but Ministers clearly had a very serious discussion in the period 16-18 </p>
<p>January, but it doesn’t seem to have been a formal meeting.”</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Sir Kevin added:</p>
<p>“In my own calculations, I didn’t feel particularly comfortable about it. I mean, </p>
<p>we are talking about this purely from the point of view of how important we were </p>
<p>to the Americans.</p>
<p>“… [M]y own evidence may seem certainly slanted because of the way in which the </p>
<p>documents were around and have fallen, and I can’t find the note that I wrote to </p>
<p>Geoff Hoon over Christmas.</p>
<p>“I think we need to remember … The main purpose of our military build-up was to </p>
<p>help convince them [Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis] that we were in deadly earnest </p>
<p>… and that they would do much better to pursue the UN route and disarm and allow </p>
<p>the inspectors back, and then none of this military action would be necessary.</p>
<p>“So the most important objective … was … to have a real impact on Iraqi </p>
<p>perceptions … It was not the most important thing to actually have impact on </p>
<p>American perceptions. That was obviously a vital thing, but … a secondary issue. </p>
<p>It wasn’t the first thing I thought about.</p>
<p>“… [I]n that sense it didn’t make much difference whether we were going to the </p>
<p>North or the South, but frankly I thought the North would have more effect on Iraqi </p>
<p>perceptions if we could have achieved it …”</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Asked whether there was any high level discussion across Whitehall of the issues </p>
<p>he had raised in his minute of 14 January, Sir Kevin replied:</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think so … the context is important here. My discussion with Geoff Hoon </p>
<p>before that was much wider, and it covered the whole range of issues in terms of </p>
<p>what were our basic interests and what were we trying to achieve, and the risks  </p>
<p>of carrying on without a full Ministerial discussion.</p>
<p>“He [Mr Hoon] simply asked me personally to give him my fullest view about the </p>
<p>nature of the US/UK relationship in all its aspects, not to consult anyone, entirely </p>
<p>privately, because he wanted to have all the information that might be necessary </p>
<p>at his fingertips, should he get into the type of discussion with his colleagues. </p>

<p>I provided him with that. Frankly I was quite embarrassed to see the thing on file </p>
<p>because it was intended purely as an aide memoire for him personally.”</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Asked if he could provide a short note of his recollection of the contents of his </p>
<p>manuscript note, Sir Kevin told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I think it is very difficult, because I couldn’t do it honestly, I don’t think.”</p>
<p>“… I did worry we were walking into something without thinking carefully about it …</p>
<p>“… [M]y advice was saying … in the circumstances, we have got to a stage where </p>
<p>it is better all round for us to continue, but continue to push hard for our conditions, </p>
<p>rather than to pull out, because I couldn’t think of a good reason for pulling out in </p>
<p>the circumstances we were in, because we hadn’t exhausted the track, we hadn’t </p>
<p>… given up trying to bring allies with us, trying to build coalitions, trying to achieve </p>
<p>success through the diplomatic route, and therefore there was no grounds, in my </p>
<p>view, for pulling out. Were we to think of doing so, there could be lots of damage … </p>
<p>to our bilateral relationship with the Americans.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean to say that if we decided in March 2002 we weren’t going to </p>
<p>have anything to do with this at all, there would be damage to our relationship. </p>
<p>It would have been much smaller, I think, at that stage. It was being at the point </p>
<p>that we were by late December, we would have needed very good reasons for not </p>
<p>continuing, and it didn’t seem to me at that stage that those reasons existed.</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, my main concern at that point was to provoke the Ministers to have </p>
<p>a full discussion, rather than simply to say the American relationship is so important, </p>
<p>you should just carry on regardless.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>268.  Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that he did not receive advice from Sir Kevin Tebbit </b></p>

<p>minute of 14 January 2003] … If it was important to have such a discussion amongst </p>

<p><b>271.  There is no dispute about the fact that Mr Hoon and Sir Kevin Tebbit </b></p>
<p><b>discussed the potential impact on US/UK relations if the UK were to be unable  </b></p>
<p><b>to act alongside the US if military action was taken; and that Sir Kevin was asked </b></p>
<p><b>to produce private advice for Mr Hoon.</b></p>
<p><b>272. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit’s advice of 14 January covered only potential damage to the </p>
<p>US/ UK strategic relationship because that was what Mr Hoon had asked him to do.</p>
<p><b>273. </b> The evidence from Mr Hoon and Sir Kevin is clear on that point.</p>
<p><b>274.  The Inquiry cannot, however, resolve the differing accounts provided by  </b></p>
<p><b>Sir Kevin Tebbit and Mr Hoon about the circumstances of that request; and </b></p>
<p><b>whether Sir Kevin had advised Mr Hoon that Ministers should pause and take  </b></p>
<p><b>the opportunity for a full discussion of the UK’s options.</b></p>
<p><b>275.  The Inquiry accepts the evidence that Sir Kevin prepared a note over </b></p>
<p><b>Christmas 2002 as he told the Inquiry; and that Mr Hoon did not receive it.</b></p>
<p><b>276. </b> Given the nature of the advice, and the importance of the issues it addressed, the </p>
<p>Inquiry would have expected a document of the nature described by Sir Kevin Tebbit to </p>
<p>have been preserved in both his Private Office and Mr Hoon’s, notwithstanding the fact </p>
<p>that it was handwritten.</p>
<p><b>277. </b> No handwritten note from Sir Kevin Tebbit to Mr Hoon was included amongst the </p>
<p>papers first disclosed to the Inquiry by the MOD.</p>
<p><b>278. </b> Although the Inquiry specifically asked the MOD to search for such a document, </p>
<p>including contacting Mr Hoon’s and Sir Kevin’s Private Secretaries at the time, it has not </p>
<p>been found.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit clearly had concerns in early 2003 about the implications of  </p>
<p>a switch in the UK military focus from the North to the South of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 6 January 2003 he had noted that the option </p>

<p>CENTCOM commanders, key staff and Coalition partners from 15 to 16 January in </p>
<p>Tampa, Florida.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> Gen Franks had described the event as “likely to be the last chance </p>
<p>for such a gathering to take place. It therefore had to be conclusive”.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Lt Gen Reith told the Inquiry that he had had a conversation with Gen Franks on </p>
<p>16 January:</p>
<p>“… I told him that we still obviously weren’t committed necessarily to execution, but </p>
<p>that the Prime Minister had approved a composite, one-division package. So that </p>
<p>was the mix, that we eventually ended up with.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>294. </b> At that meeting, Lt Gen Reith and Gen Franks had discussed Phases II and III  </p>
<p>and Gen Franks had “agreed that 3 Commando Brigade would be the best capability  </p>
<p>to attack into the al-Faw Peninsula”.</p>
<p><b>295. </b> Lt Gen Reith told the Inquiry that Gen Franks’ feeling was that 7 Armoured Brigade </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade could “probably secure the oilfields”, releasing the US 3rd Infantry </p>
<p>Division and I Marines Division for “the main effort. So we would then have a discrete </p>
<p>box in southern Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Asked whether the UK was still suggesting that the US should have two sets of </p>
<p>plans in case the UK could not contribute, Lt Gen Reith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I told him that the Prime Minister had agreed to the package, and so therefore … </p>
<p>I’m making an assumption that he now expected us to participate.”</p>
<p>103</p>
<p><b>297. </b> Maj Gen Wilson reported that “Phase IV responsibilities became a little clearer”  </p>
<p>at the Commanders’ Conference. Gen Franks had demanded that JTF-4 deploy as </p>
<p>soon as possible to Kuwait and had welcomed Lt Gen Reith’s offer to embed four UK </p>
<p>personnel in it. Gen Franks had also directed that “key Phase IV players should visit the </p>
<p>Pentagon to ensure that planning was joined up”.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>298. </b> In his record of the meeting with Gen Franks, Lt Gen Reith explained that UK staff </p>
<p>embedded in JTF-4 would have “reach-back” to the Phase IV planning team in PJHQ, </p>
<p>giving the UK “considerable influence over US planning”.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> He reported that Gen Franks </p>
<p>had “agreed that we could plan on [the] UK having responsibility for the Basra region in </p>
<p>Phase IV and would welcome our setting the standard for other nations. Clearly this will </p>
<p>need Ministerial approval in due course.”</p>

<p><b>299. </b> Gen Reith told the Inquiry he had also told Gen Franks that he was “unhappy with </p>
<p>the way the planning was going” because the US was “going into shock and awe” and </p>
<p>the UK “had been very much the custodians of ‘Let’s worry about Phase IV’”.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>300. </b> Gen Reith said he had made that point to Gen Franks because the US were </p>
<p>going to have a fairly extended air campaign followed by land entry as they had done </p>
<p>in the 1991 Gulf Conflict. Gen Reith told the Inquiry he had said that “the oilfields were </p>
<p>absolutely essential” for Phase IV:</p>
<p>“… to provide revenue for Iraq for its reconstruction, and therefore, we needed to </p>
<p>secure the oilfields rather than have them destroyed. I also made the point to him </p>
<p>that the more china that we broke, the more we would have to replace afterwards. </p>
<p>So I left him with those thoughts, and … between that meeting and obviously </p>
<p>when we went in, they changed the phasing of the plan so that there was an early </p>

<p><b>304. </b> The briefing included questions to which “we must first have answers” if the UK </p>
<p>was to contribute along those lines, including whether the US envisaged “sectorisation” </p>
<p>as in Bosnia or “central locations and force projection” as in Afghanistan as the </p>
<p>model for Phase IV Coalition force structure. If sectorisation, would the US provide </p>
<p>additional forces in the UK sector to perform humanitarian tasks for which UK capacity </p>
<p>was limited?</p>
<p><b>305. </b> After the talks, Mr Lee reported to Mr Hoon that, on the plus side, the US was </p>
<p>beginning to take the post-conflict planning seriously and was willing to work with the </p>

<p>110</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Mr Lee recommended that Mr Hoon raise post-conflict planning in his next phone </p>
<p>conversation with Secretary Rumsfeld, in terms that it was a vital issue that needed  </p>
<p>“to be sorted now because it affects both the UK decision to commit to hostilities … and </p>
<p>also international support”, and that there was a need for clarity on “who is responsible </p>
<p>to whom for what on day after planning and then execution”.</p>

<p><b>JIC Assessment, 29 January 2003: ‘The Emerging View from Baghdad’</b></p>
<p><b>308.  The JIC assessed on 29 January that retaining WMD was a vital Iraqi interest </b></p>
<p><b>and that Saddam Hussein was unlikely to agree to relinquish power or go into </b></p>
<p><b>exile.</b></p>
<p><b>309.  The JIC predicted that once military action began, widespread lack of loyalty </b></p>
<p><b>to the regime would become clear and a hard-fought professional defence of </b></p>
<p><b>Baghdad was “unlikely”.</b></p>
<p><b>310.  The JIC Assessment of 29 January 2003 sustained its earlier judgements  </b></p>
<p><b>on Iraq’s ability and intent to conduct terrorist operations.</b></p>
<p><b>311. </b> At the request of the FCO, the JIC produced an Assessment on 29 January </p>
<p>reviewing developments in Iraq from the viewpoint of the Iraqi regime, particularly </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein, and possible Iraqi moves in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> The Assessment </p>
<p>addressed both the possible response to the obligations set out in resolution 1441 (see </p>
<p>Section 3.6) and Iraq’s potential responses to the military build-up and military action.</p>
<p><b>312. </b> The Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam does not appear to realise the severity of the military attack he faces. </p>

<p>a US- led attack, are unlikely to be telling Saddam about their concerns.”</p>

<p>431</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam has not lost control or the capacity for rational tactical decisions.  </p>
<p>He continues to maintain regime cohesion, primarily through intimidation. He is </p>
<p>unlikely to agree to relinquish power or to go into exile. He still believes he has </p>
<p>a chance of averting military action or, once military action begins, forcing the </p>
<p>Coalition to cease hostilities before his regime collapses.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once military action has begun, widespread lack of loyalty to the regime will </p>
<p>become clear. Iraqis may not welcome Coalition Forces, but most will at least </p>
<p>acquiesce in Coalition military activity to topple the regime, as long as civilian </p>
<p>casualties are limited. A hard fought professional defence of Baghdad is unlikely, </p>
<p>although elite military and security elements closely identified with the regime </p>
<p>may fight until their positions become untenable.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam probably believes he has some strong political and military cards to </p>
<p>play, even in the face of an inevitable attack … He may use human shields, </p>
<p>fire CBW against Coalition Forces, launch a pre-emptive attack on the Kurds, </p>
<p>Coalition Forces building up in Kuwait or Israel, or sabotage Iraqi oil wells and </p>
<p>water supply.”</p>
<p><b>313. </b> The Assessment stated that: “Given the high level of uncertainty over Saddam’s </p>
<p>response once he recognises his survival is at stake, we will need to plan for a wide </p>
<p>range of humanitarian crises, including a possible humanitarian role for Coalition Forces.”</p>
<p><b>314. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqis believed that the West was “squeamish about casualties”. The JIC </p>
<p>continued to judge that Iraq’s capability to conduct terrorist attacks was “limited, </p>
<p>especially outside the Gulf region”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC had “previously judged that terrorism could be attempted against </p>
<p>Coalition Forces during a military build-up if Saddam believed that an attack </p>
<p>was inevitable”. There had been “no indication that Iraq was behind the recent </p>
<p>attack on US contractors working for the US military in Kuwait”. That had, </p>
<p>however, highlighted “the vulnerability of the large numbers of Coalition Forces </p>
<p>concentrated in an area as small as Kuwait”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq might well “seek to use its influence over some smaller militant Palestinian </p>
<p>groups to encourage them to strike at US and Coalition interests in the Middle </p>
<p>East in the event of a Coalition attack”. There were “also uncorroborated reports </p>
<p>of Iraq assembling teams in various countries to attack UK and US interests in </p>
<p>the event of war against Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Despite the presence of terrorists in Iraq with links to Al Qaida”, there was  </p>
<p>“no intelligence of current co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “no clear indication of any plan for a pre-emptive military strike </p>
<p>against the Kurds, neighbouring countries or Israel”. Saddam would have “little </p>
<p>incentive to launch such a strike while the Iraqi strategy focuses on convincing </p>
<p>UNMOVIC that Iraq does not have WMD holdings”, but it might “become </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p>an attractive option in the face of imminent Coalition military action”. There </p>
<p>was “unlikely” to be any advance warning of an attack on the Kurds. The JIC </p>
<p>judged that “a pre-emptive limited artillery strike on Kuwait using CBW could </p>
<p>be launched in as little as two hours”. Preparations for an attack on Israel were </p>
<p>“likely to be, more extensive and to stretch Iraqi capabilities to the limit”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were indications of “plans to sabotage oil fields to prevent them falling </p>
<p>into Coalition hands”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “continuing Iraqi military defensive preparations, including </p>
<p>deployments and reinforcements of military units in the South, West and along </p>
<p>the border of the Kurdish autonomous zone” which appeared to be “directed </p>
<p>against the threat of both an internal uprising and external attack”. That included </p>
<p>“possibly 1,000 troops on the al-Faw peninsula, apparently in response to the </p>
<p>Coalition build-up in Kuwait”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s options for redeployment in the South were “limited”: “Any significant </p>
<p>redeployment in the South would risk triggering a Coalition attack by breaching </p>
<p>the Southern No-Drive Zone.” The regime did not “trust the Republican Guard </p>
<p>enough to deploy them in Baghdad, except possibly as a last resort, leaving </p>
<p>them exposed beyond the capital’s boundaries”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The regime was “maintaining ‘business as usual’: anybody thinking of deserting </p>
<p>will face serious consequences […] we may not see clear signs of dissent or </p>
<p>defection until the regime is about to fall”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC judged that “most Iraqis will welcome the departure of Saddam. A few </p>
<p>reports suggest that some Iraqis may fight to defend their homeland from what </p>
<p>they see as external aggression […] Overall we judge that while Iraqis may not </p>
<p>welcome military forces, they will at least acquiesce in Coalition military action </p>
<p>to topple the regime, as long as civilian casualties are limited … [M]orale in </p>
<p>much of regular army is low and … many soldiers are reluctant to fight. But </p>
<p>as long as Iraqi security officers remain with military units and able to enforce </p>
<p>discipline, fear of execution is likely to keep regular units at their posts.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “already placing military targets in residential areas to </p>
<p>score a propaganda victory in the event of a Coalition air campaign”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the face of an attack, or even before hostilities if he judged that an attack was </p>
<p>imminent” Saddam Hussein might take a number of actions, including seeking </p>
<p>to “inflict high enough casualties on any Coalition ground forces, perhaps in </p>
<p>Kuwait, including through use of CBW, to halt a Coalition attack and to swing </p>
<p>public opinion in the West against hostilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Once hostilities were under way”, Saddam might also “seek to cause an </p>
<p>international outcry over the level of Iraqi or Coalition casualties”; and “pursue </p>
<p>a scorched earth policy, including the destruction of oil wells and poisoning the </p>
<p>water supply”.</p>

<p>“a chance of averting military action” or “forcing the Coalition to cease hostilities” before </p>
<p>his regime collapsed.</p>
<p><b>316. </b> The minutes of the JIC discussion of the draft Assessment recorded that:</p>
<p>“… it was difficult to predict if and when Saddam might launch pre-emptive strikes, </p>
<p>but the paper should try and make a judgement on possible timescales. The trigger </p>
<p>would probably be set when Saddam concluded that his fate was sealed, rather </p>
<p>than any movements by Coalition Forces. Most of the Iraqi military would probably </p>
<p>crumble quickly under attack. Saddam would maintain his hold of power until then, </p>
<p>and there were no indications of possible coups beforehand. Whilst the Iraqi public </p>
<p>might welcome the end of Saddam’s regime, they were also concerned about the </p>
<p>human costs of fighting.”</p>

<p><b>317. </b> On 30 January, Mr Scarlett wrote to Sir David Manning with some “personal </p>
<p>observations on the overall intelligence picture”.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“… as we get closer to the deadline, it is increasingly likely that the regime will hold </p>
<p>until the invasion actually occurs. I am very comfortable with this assessment. </p>
<p>A pre- invasion implosion (eg assassination or successful coup) cannot be excluded.”</p>
<p><b>319. </b> Mr Scarlett suggested that, once an invasion was under way, Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… knows the weaknesses of the Regular Army and does not expect them to resist </p>
<p>effectively. He may genuinely have better hopes for the Republican Guard and place </p>
<p>some reliance on their ability to delay the occupation of Baghdad and other cities.  </p>
<p>In his mind, he may not need such delay to last for long.”</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that, “given the perceived inability of his enemies to take </p>
<p>significant casualties or setbacks”, some of the potential moves that Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>could make, as highlighted in the JIC Assessment, “might make to give us pause even </p>
<p>after a military operation begins”. Mr Scarlett wrote that those moves must be taken </p>
<p>seriously. He noted in particular:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Attempted use of CBW and missiles … immediately before an attack or (in </p>
<p>Kuwait and southern Iraq) in the early stages of the attack itself.” That would </p>
<p>be “very difficult to pull off”, but “even a small number of short range artillery </p>
<p>rockets getting through would have a disproportionate effect” and it was “not </p>
<p>unreasonable for Saddam to think it would give us second thoughts”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“CBW armed Al Hussein [ballistic missile] attack on Israel. Again very difficult  </p>
<p>to achieve, but the benefits of success are obvious.”</p>

<p><b>321. </b> Mr Scarlett reminded Sir David that the JIC had judged, “over many months”, that </p>
<p>“once the invasion starts Saddam’s regime is likely to prove brittle and fold quickly”. </p>
<p>It was therefore correct to prepare a military strategy to “make this ‘quickly’ very </p>
<p>quick indeed”.</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that circumstances required the UK to look carefully for areas </p>

<p><b>323.  In preparation for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush on 31 January, the </b></p>
<p><b>MOD drew attention to the implications which any delay in military action beyond </b></p>
<p><b>the spring would have for its ability to provide a major contribution to military </b></p>
<p><b>action, and the need for the US and UK to have agreed military objectives.</b></p>
<p><b>324. </b> The MOD briefing of 29 January comprised a general update and sections on </p>
<p>targeting, “aftermath”, and Saddam Hussein’s options, including “Fortress Baghdad”.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>325. </b> The MOD “line to take” suggested for Mr Blair was that, if military operations were </p>
<p>to be delayed beyond April/May, the UK would “struggle to put together this scale of </p>
<p>force again for the autumn, especially if the fire strike continues. So militarily we could </p>

<p>the spring, the UK would “face some awkward choices”. Some “key elements of the UK </p>
<p>contribution were unique” – including the Commando Brigade, the Assault Brigade and  </p>
<p>a specialist helicopter carrier ship. The MOD suggested:</p>
<p>“If operations were not going to start until the autumn, we would need to consider </p>
<p>bringing some forces back to the UK in the meantime. Our ability to provide a </p>
<p>major contribution later in the year will also be severely constrained if the fire strike </p>
<p>continues beyond the spring.”</p>

<p><b>327. </b> The MOD also advised Mr Blair that agreement on the objectives for a military </p>
<p>campaign would be needed.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> In relation to targeting, the “line to take” offered to Mr Blair was that the UK was </p>
<p>“working up our strategic objectives for a military campaign. We need to relate this to </p>
<p>the legal base we establish.” It was: “Very important that UK and US objectives are </p>
<p>aligned soon and in advance of commitment to action so that we can come to a clear </p>
<p>and common understanding on <b>targeting issues</b> and the <b>information campaign</b>.” </p>
<p>That would need “careful handling domestically”.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> The detailed advice from the MOD on targeting is set out later in this Section  </p>
<p>as part of the consideration of planning for the air campaign.</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The background briefing for Mr Blair explained that the current thinking was </p>
<p>that the objectives would be published “close to, or at the start of hostilities”. The </p>
<p>MOD explained that the military objectives would enable it to “satisfy” itself “that they </p>
<p>represent[ed] minimum use of force as required by international law”, and to use the </p>
<p>CDS Directive to indicate “what military missions are legitimate, including … what targets </p>
<p>we can legitimately attack from the air; and plan Information Operations”.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> A “publicly agreed set of aligned military objectives”, being prepared by the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office, would enable the UK to participate in a “joined up <b>information operations </b></p>
<p><b>campaign</b>”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>436</p>
<p><b>336.  When Mr Blair met President Bush on 31 January, it was clear that the </b></p>
<p><b>window for peaceful disarmament would only be a few weeks. The military </b></p>
<p><b>campaign could begin around 10 March.</b></p>
<p><b>337. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush had a two hour meeting in Washington on 31 January </p>
<p>followed by a press conference and an informal dinner.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> The discussions are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 3.6.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> On military planning, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the possibility that </p>
<p>Iraqi forces would fold quickly. Mr Blair asked about planning for the post-conflict period. </p>
<p>In his view a UN badge would be needed. That would help with the humanitarian </p>
<p>problems. Mr Blair and President Bush discussed an initial military occupation, how to </p>
<p>handle the dilemma of managing the transition to civil administration and the nature of </p>
<p>an Iraqi government.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the US and UK needed to prepare to organise on a  </p>
<p>“war footing”, working very closely together “particularly on our public communications”.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> Sir David Manning recorded that it was clear that the window of opportunity would </p>
<p>be only a few weeks. Otherwise the US would take military action. The military campaign </p>
<p>could begin “around 10 March”, and earlier if Dr Blix’s report on 14 February was tough. </p>
<p>The timing was “very tight”.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair at what point he had concluded that the US “had </p>
<p>definitely decided on military action in March 2003”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>342. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“It was clear from continuing discussion with the US in late 2002/early 2003 that </p>
<p>March was the likely date for military action. That firmed up as it became plain that </p>
<p>there was no significant shift in the attitude of Saddam. The December Declaration </p>
<p>… was incomplete, as Blix noted … His first report was to the effect that there was </p>
<p>not full compliance, essentially around interviews. There were various possible </p>
<p>alternatives to military action surfacing, including proposals for Saddam peacefully  </p>
<p>to give up power.”</p>

<p><b>344. </b> Mr Hoon wrote:</p>
<p>“You will recall that we agreed the air package for planning purposes in September. </p>
<p>With some small adjustments at the margins, the planned package now comprises </p>
<p>118 fixed-wing aircraft, including those routinely based in theatre in support of the </p>
<p>No-Fly Zones.”</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Hoon told Mr Blair that, because there remained “some uncertainty” over basing </p>
<p>arrangements for some elements of the package, he would speak of “up to” 118 aircraft </p>
<p>rather than providing a firm number. He added that the US was also “wrestling with </p>
<p>some of the same uncertainties”.</p>
<p><b>346. </b> On 6 February, Mr Hoon told Parliament that the UK already maintained a </p>
<p>“significant presence” in the Middle East of “around 25 aircraft and 1000 personnel”.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He announced that, in the event of operations against Iraq, it was envisaged that the </p>
<p>UK would increase its presence to “around 100 fixed-wing aircraft supported by around </p>
<p>7,000 personnel” in the “days and weeks ahead”.</p>
<p><b>347. </b> In addition, the Joint Helicopter Command would “deploy a very substantial </p>
<p>proportion of its equipment and personnel”. Its contribution would consist of 27 Puma </p>
<p>and Chinook support helicopters and “about 1,100 people”.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> In response to a question from Mr Bernard Jenkin (Conservative), Mr Hoon said </p>
<p>that UK forces would be “in the Gulf for as long as it takes to disarm Iraq and the regime </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>THE PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN LAW</p>
<p><b>349. </b> The principles of international humanitarian law (IHL) governing military operations </p>
<p>are set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>350. </b> The guidance issued to the Armed Forces on the application of IHL during military </p>
<p>operations is addressed in more detail later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>Overview of international humanitarian law</b></p>
<p>International humanitarian law (IHL) is also known as the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) </p>
<p>or the Law of War. IHL is part of international law and governs the conduct of armed </p>
<p>conflict, sometimes referred to as <i>jus in bello.</i> It is distinct from the law governing the </p>
<p>resort to armed conflict, <i>jus ad bellum</i>,<i> </i>which derives from the United Nations Charter </p>
<p>(see Section 1.1).</p>
<p>IHL aims to limit the effects of armed conflicts for humanitarian reasons. It aims to protect </p>
<p>persons who are not or are no longer taking part in the hostilities, the sick and wounded, </p>
<p>prisoners and civilians, and to define the rights and obligations of the parties to a conflict </p>

<p>House of Commons, <i>Official Report, </i>6 February 2003, column 457.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>438</p>
<p>in the conduct of hostilities.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> It derives mainly from the four 1949 Geneva Conventions </p>
<p>and their Additional Protocols, and from the 1907 Hague Regulations, but also from other </p>
<p>international conventions and protocols covering specific areas, as well as from customary </p>
<p>law; that is, those rules derived from the established practice of states.</p>
<p>The cardinal principles of humanitarian law are authoritatively set out in an advisory </p>
<p>opinion of the International Court of Justice:</p>
<p>“The first is aimed at the protection of the civilian population and civilian objects and </p>
<p>establishes the distinction between combatants and non-combatants; States must </p>
<p>never make civilians the object of attack and must consequently never use weapons </p>
<p>that are incapable of distinguishing between civilian and military targets. According  </p>
<p>to the second principle, it is prohibited to cause unnecessary suffering to combatants: </p>
<p>it is accordingly prohibited to use weapons causing them such harm or uselessly </p>
<p>aggravating their suffering. In application of that second principle, States do not have </p>
<p>unlimited freedom of choice of means in the weapons they use.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>The key elements of LOAC which apply to targeting of military objectives during a conflict </p>
<p>are set out in the 1977 Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (Protocol I). </p>
<p>The main principles can be summarised as:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Distinction.</b> The parties to the conflict must at all times distinguish between the </p>
<p>civilian population and combatants, and between civilian objects and military </p>
<p>objectives, and shall direct their operations only against military objectives </p>
<p>(Article 48).</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Proportionality.</b> Military objectives must not be attacked if the attack is likely to </p>
<p>cause civilian casualties or damage which would be excessive in relation to the </p>
<p>concrete and direct military advantage anticipated (Article 57:2:b).</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Military Necessity.</b> Offensive operations must be limited to those which are </p>
<p>necessary i.e. only those which are required to secure a definite military advantage. </p>
<p>If there is a choice between targets for obtaining a similar military advantage, the </p>
<p>objective to be selected shall be that the attack on which may be expected to cause </p>
<p>the least danger to civilian lives and civilian objects (Article 57:3).</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Feasible Precautions.</b> In the conduct of military operations, constant care shall </p>
<p>be taken to spare the civilian population, civilians and civilian objects. Those </p>
<p>who plan or decide upon an attack must take a number of specified precautions, </p>
<p>focusing on the principles outlined above (Article 57).</p>
<p>PRELIMINARY DISCUSSIONS ON TARGETING</p>
<p><b>351.  To allow planning to proceed, the MOD sought Lord Goldsmith’s views in </b></p>
<p><b>early February on the considerations that should apply to the selection of targets </b></p>
<p><b>during an air campaign.</b></p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>439</p>
<p><b>352. </b> The MOD set out its position on targeting in advice prepared for Mr Blair’s meeting </p>
<p>with President Bush on 31 January.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>353. </b> The MOD advised that, although detailed assessments of civilian casualties </p>
<p>resulting from the air campaign could be produced on a “target-by-target” basis, the </p>
<p>target set was not yet sufficiently well defined to allow an estimate to be produced for </p>
<p>the air campaign as a whole. Analysis based on estimated civilian casualties during </p>
<p>operations over Iraq between 1998 and 1999 suggested that the civilian casualties  </p>
<p>for an air campaign would be around 150 killed and 500 injured.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> No assessment had been produced of civilian casualties arising from “urban </p>
<p>operations in Basra”. Experience from World War II suggested that between 200 </p>
<p>and 2,000 civilians could be killed in urban operations in Basra, depending on </p>
<p>“circumstances, duration and the degree to which civilian casualties are minimised”.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> On 3 February, Mr Hoon’s Private Office wrote to Lord Goldsmith’s Office with </p>
<p>a paper on the UK’s military campaign objectives. It was intended to form a basis for </p>
<p>discussion of possible targets during an air campaign at a meeting with Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>and Mr Straw the following day.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>356. </b> The paper set out three potential options for disarming Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Enforced inspections – military force being used to support UNMOVIC </p>
<p>inspectors on the ground.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Enforced destruction (air) – a sustained campaign of selective targeting using </p>
<p>precision guided weapons and other aerial bombing techniques against known </p>
<p>weapons sites.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Enforced dismantling/destruction (land) – ground operations enabling the </p>
<p>international community to take control of WMD sites.</p>
<p><b>357. </b> Each option provided a rationale within which specific targeting or other legal </p>
<p>issues could be considered.</p>
<p><b>358. </b> The paper concluded by stating that the first two options would not deliver the </p>
<p>UK’s objectives. The third option would require an integrated air and ground campaign </p>
<p>to meet any military resistance from the Iraqi Armed Forces and to minimise risk to </p>
<p>Coalition Service Personnel. The paper stated:</p>
<p>“But the key driver of resistance to Coalition operations is the Iraqi regime itself. </p>
<p>Not only would removal of the regime potentially bring the need for military action to </p>
<p>an early conclusion, the prospect of a new and representative administration in Iraq </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>440</p>
<p>would minimise the potential for Iraqi reversion to a WMD programme once military </p>
<p>action was complete.”</p>
<p><b>359. </b> The paper also set out the elements of the US plan and addressed whether  </p>
<p>they were necessary and proportionate. It concluded that the current US Concept  </p>
<p>of Operations could “achieve a conventional military defeat, but that the use of force  </p>
<p>in achieving this aim is potentially proportionate and necessary”.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> At that stage, Mr Hoon and MOD officials did not know Lord Goldsmith’s views </p>
<p>on whether resolution 1441 provided a legal basis for military action without a further </p>
<p>authorisation by the Security Council (see Section 5).</p>
<p><b>361. </b> The record of the meeting between Lord Goldsmith, Mr Hoon and Mr Straw stated </p>
<p>that Mr Hoon had said a way of approving individual and generic targets should be found </p>
<p>“beforehand”, along with a method of handling emergent targeting needs during the </p>
<p>course of the campaign.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>362. </b> Lord Goldsmith was clear that, in such an integrated campaign, it was “practically </p>
<p>impossible to make a distinction” between UK and US operations. That significantly </p>
<p>increased the legal task and reinforced the necessity for a robust audit trail. Scrutiny  </p>
<p>was to be expected.</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Lord Goldsmith said it would be important to tackle difficult targets early but he was </p>
<p>“open to an approach where straightforward targets could be packaged”.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Hoon asked whether it was “possible to clear easy packages early in </p>
<p>order to make a start on the large numbers of targets” which had to be addressed. </p>
<p>Air Commodore Mike Heath, Head of the Directorate of Targeting and Information </p>
<p>Operations (DTIO), outlined how full collateral considerations could not be taken into </p>
<p>account “until very shortly before the operation”.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Lord Goldsmith welcomed the broad approach outlined in the paper:</p>
<p>“It correctly identified the regime as a target, but was currently too tentative in </p>
<p>identifying it as a necessary target … The conclusion at the end of the paper that </p>
<p>this campaign was “potentially proportionate” was insufficiently robust and a more </p>
<p>explicit conclusion was required.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Straw asked that more work be done to clearly identify the controlling elements </p>
<p>of the regime.</p>
<p><b>367.  Mr Blair agreed that the overall strategy of the air campaign was  </b></p>
<p><b>to contribute to the collapse of the Iraqi regime or at least prevent it from </b></p>
<p><b>using WMD.</b></p>

<p><b>368.  Mr Blair also underlined the importance of minimising civilian casualties.</b></p>
<p><b>369. </b> The assessments made by the Government before, and during, initial combat </p>
<p>operations of the number of Iraqi civilian casualties are addressed in Section 17.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Blair was briefed on the targeting aspects of an air campaign by Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>Adm Boyce and Air Cdre Heath on 6 February.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Mr Blair agreed “the overall strategy of the air campaign, creating an overwhelming </p>
<p>effect so that the regime collapsed or at least was disabled from using WMD in a conflict, </p>
<p>leading to the overall objective of Iraqi disarmament”. He underlined the importance </p>
<p>of “minimising the number of civilian casualties and ensuring that all targets were </p>
<p>appropriate and proportionate” and that consideration should be given to “how best to </p>
<p>explain publicly the scale and nature of the campaign”.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr Blair asked for a note explaining the rationale behind the targets chosen for the </p>
<p>proposed air campaign, and an assessment of the likely accuracy of the campaign.</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Watkins provided that advice on 10 February.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> He wrote that the plan was to </p>
<p>mount near simultaneous attacks of air, ground and information operations:</p>
<p>“The air campaign has been crafted to ensure success … without going beyond </p>
<p>what is necessary to achieve specific military campaign objectives. It will appear to </p>
<p>involve overwhelming force – but it is not intended to turn Iraq into a wasteland. The </p>
<p>targets have been selected for the effect that their disabling or destruction would </p>
<p>have on the regime rather than to inflict physical damage. The target sets therefore </p>
<p>mostly represent only a fraction of those that could be attacked in each category </p>
<p>… This approach should minimise the number of civilian and potentially military </p>
<p>casualties; ease the issues of reconstitution in the aftermath of conflict; and facilitate </p>
<p>the earliest possible military withdrawal.”</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Target sets for the air campaign included “all those facilities which would enable </p>
<p>the regime to activate and deploy WMD”.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> The land campaign would begin in the first few days but precise timings were not </p>
<p>known. Mr Watkins wrote that “whether the UK brigades will become heavily engaged  </p>
<p>in fighting will very much depend on the effectiveness of the air campaign and initial  </p>
<p>US land operations”.</p>
<p><b>Objectives for the military campaign</b></p>

<p><b>377.  Sir David Manning described the objectives to Dr Rice as compatible with but </b></p>
<p><b>not identical to US objectives.</b></p>
<p><b>378. </b> It was recorded at the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 29 January that political and </p>
<p>military synchronisation and timing “remained fluid”.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> The Cabinet Office was preparing </p>
<p>a revised paper on the UK’s objectives that “sought to align the UK and US positions that </p>
<p>currently differed”.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> The minutes recorded that Adm Boyce noted that the issues of timing and </p>
<p>objectives were urgent and that the US might “leave the UK with little warning of </p>
<p>military action”.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> The current timelines indicated that US ground forces would not be available in  </p>
<p>the North before the third week in March, “although there was still a coercive effect to  </p>
<p>be achieved by continuing to pursue the option”.</p>
<p><b>381. </b> CENTCOM continued planning to mitigate against a decision by President Bush </p>
<p>to act earlier than the planning assumptions: “However, the preparedness of US ground </p>
<p>forces was behind schedule; as a result A day [Assault Day] was moving towards G day </p>
<p>[the day that the ground campaign would begin] rather than G to A.”</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Mr Bowen sent Sir David Manning a copy of the latest draft of the objectives on </p>

<p>131</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“It will be important before the Coalition embarks on military action to ensure that we </p>
<p>share the same military objectives with the US, otherwise the strategic direction of </p>
<p>the campaign risks falling apart. After your return from the US I suggest we discuss </p>
<p>how best to do this.”</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>443</p>
<p><b>385. </b> On 11 February, Mr Bowen sent Sir David Manning a revised draft of the UK’s </p>
<p>military campaign objectives, incorporating comments from Mr Straw and Whitehall </p>
<p>departments.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> The draft stated:</p>
<p>“<b>The UK’s overall objective for the military campaign is to create the </b></p>
<p><b>conditions in which Iraq disarms in accordance with its obligations under </b></p>
<p><b>UNSCRs and remains so disarmed in the long term.</b>”</p>
<p><b>386. </b> The Coalition’s main tasks in support of that objective were to:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>overcome the resistance of the Iraqi security forces;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>deny the Iraqi regime the use of weapons of mass destruction now and in  </p>
<p>the future;</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>remove the Iraqi regime, given its clear and unyielding refusal to comply with  </p>
<p>the UN Security Council’s demands;</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p>identify and secure the sites where weapons of mass destruction and their </p>
<p>means of delivery are located;</p>
<p>e. </p>
<p>secure essential economic infrastructure, including for utilities and transport, </p>
<p>from sabotage and wilful destruction by Iraqis; and</p>
<p>f. </p>
<p>deter wider conflict both inside Iraq and the region.”</p>
<p><b>387. </b> The UK’s wider political objectives in support of the military campaign and the </p>
<p>immediate military priorities in the aftermath of hostilities are addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>388. </b> The MOD comments on the draft objectives focused on whether they provided </p>
<p>“enough top cover to derive appropriate CDS and targeting directives to enable us to </p>
<p>work in coalition with the US”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><b>389. </b> On 12 February, the Chiefs of Staff noted that work on the UK objectives paper had </p>
<p>been concluded, but not finally endorsed. The paper would be “ready for release at the </p>
<p>start of any offensive campaign”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>390. </b> Mr Hoon discussed the objectives with Secretary Rumsfeld in Washington on </p>
<p>12 February.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Sir David Manning sent a copy to Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National </p>
<p>Security Advisor, on 14 February.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> He explained that the UK military campaign </p>
<p>objectives were “compatible but not identical” to ‘Iraq: Goals, Objectives, Strategy’  </p>
<p>(a US document handed to Sir David by Dr Rice on 31 January – see Section 6.5).</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>444</p>
<p><b>392. </b> Sir David explained that the UK and US were committed to ridding Iraq of WMD </p>
<p>and recognised the need to remove the current Iraqi regime if military action proved </p>
<p>necessary, but the UK document avoided references to “liberation”. No firm decision had </p>
<p>been taken, but the likelihood was that the UK would publish its objectives if and when </p>
<p>military action was decided.</p>
<p><b>393. </b> After discussion with Lord Goldsmith, a final version of the military campaign </p>
<p>objectives was placed in the House of Commons Library by Mr Hoon on 20 March.</p>
<p><b>The Phase IV plan</b></p>
<p><b>394.  During February, UK officials became increasingly concerned about the risk </b></p>
<p><b>that the UK might agree to take responsibility for a geographical sector of Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>before the implications had been examined.</b></p>
<p><b>395.  The UK would not make a commitment to administer a division-sized area  </b></p>
<p><b>in the medium to long term.</b></p>
<p><b>396. </b> The first detailed estimate of the type (but not the size) of force required to deliver </p>
<p>different tasks was in Lt Gen Reith’s draft Concept of Operations for Phase IV of 25 </p>
<p>March. That is addressed in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>397. </b> On 14 February, Mr Ehrman reported to Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, </p>
<p>that at a “[Sir David] Manning meeting” on post-conflict issues, Sir David had “expressed </p>
<p>strong concern that junior CENTCOM planners seemed to be dreaming up an ever </p>
<p>larger area of Iraq for the UK to administer”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> The Chiefs of Staff had advised Mr Blair </p>
<p>that it would be easier for the UK to play a smaller post-conflict role if it was part of  </p>
<p>a Coalition fighting force; the opposite now seemed to be the case.</p>
<p><b>398. </b> Sir David had said that:</p>
<p>“[Mr Richard] Armitage [US Deputy Secretary of State] was talking of military </p>
<p>administration for two years. The Pentagon seemed to be more sensible, talking of </p>
<p>six months. Did we [the UK] not need to reduce our 40,000 troops to around 5,000 </p>
<p>by the end of six months? And who would pay for all this? Some on the US side </p>
<p>seemed to be saying: you pay for what you administer.”</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Ehrman informed Mr Ricketts that Sir David Manning had asked the MOD:</p>
<p>“… to get the best information they could, at a senior level, on what size of sector </p>
<p>was really being proposed for the UK; and FCO, with MOD, then to let No.10 have </p>
<p>views on the issues which would be involved in its administration, and how we would </p>
<p>seek to deal with these.”</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>445</p>
<p><b>400. </b> On 17 February, the inter-departmental Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), based in the </p>
<p>FCO, sent Mr Ehrman a paper on sectorisation as part of his briefing for a meeting on </p>
<p>post-conflict issues, including sectorisation, chaired by Lt Gen Pigott.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> The paper, </p>
<p>not yet agreed with the MOD, recommended that the UK should make clear to the US </p>
<p>that it was unwilling to take responsibility for a sector for more than 60 days unless </p>
<p>its presence was authorised by the UN and there was to be an early move to a UN </p>
<p>transitional administration. The paper is described in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> The IPU paper’s broad assumption in favour of administration of a small sector </p>
<p>for a short period was reflected in the guidance for UK officials attending the US </p>
<p>inter- agency Rock Drill on post-conflict issues on 21-22 February.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>402. </b> On 19 February, the Chiefs of Staff discussed post-conflict planning in the context </p>
<p>of the forthcoming Rock Drill.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Before the meeting, MOD officials recommended that the Chiefs of Staff agree a </p>
<p>set of assumptions about “the scale, posture and duration” of post-conflict UK military </p>
<p>operations in order to inform IPU preparations for the Rock Drill.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Officials recommended that the Chiefs of Staff:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p><b>Agree </b>the assumption that our aim should be to reduce to a medium scale </p>
<p>post- conflict TELIC</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> commitment as soon as possible and pursue discussions </p>
<p>with the US and potential Coalition allies (to determine our AOR and burden </p>
<p>sharing) that will facilitate this.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p><b>Note</b> that without a UN mandate for occupation (not necessarily the same thing </p>
<p>as a second UNSCR) finding Coalition partners will be more difficult and that </p>
<p>the UK may face an enduring commitment that will be difficult to sustain and </p>
<p>damaging to the long-term health of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p><b>Agree </b>that in discussions with the US, the scale and nature of UK involvement </p>
<p>is made conditional on satisfactory UN involvement.</p>
<p>d. </p>
<p><b>Agree</b> the assumption that the UK will administer a sector of Iraq; within the </p>
<p>constraint imposed by the maximum level of commitment being medium scale; </p>
<p>this would correspond to the UK’s <i>initial</i> AO, <i>not </i>one of the somewhat larger </p>
<p>sectors currently being considered in US planning.</p>

<p>Operation TELIC was the name given to the UK’s military operation in Iraq.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>446</p>
<p>e. </p>
<p><b>Note</b> that some US thinking now sees a role for HQ ARRC as a follow-on HQ  </p>
<p>for post-conflict Iraq …</p>
<p>f. </p>
<p><b>Agree</b> that if the political gains are sufficient, we should entertain a role in Iraq </p>
<p>for HQ ARRC – <b>but note</b> that a countrywide military remit for HQ ARRC (ie as </p>
<p>HQ CJTF-I) risks the UK assuming too great a proportion of the responsibility  </p>
<p>for the stability and security of Iraq from the US …”</p>
<p><b>405. </b> The MOD warned that:</p>
<p>“Once fully deployed the level of our commitment to Op TELIC will be large scale </p>
<p>across all three services. Unless very significant risk is to be placed on the deployed </p>
<p>force, and UK forces more widely, the force must be reduced to medium scale </p>
<p>by October/November this year; this implies that the reduction must begin by </p>
<p>July/ August. Factors that drive this conclusion are:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>A large scale commitment can only be sustained with the callout of certain </p>
<p>trade groups of reserves, who have already been mobilised in toto.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>There will be severe disruption of the Formation Readiness Cycle and </p>
<p>Operational Commitments Plot that will have deleterious effects on training </p>
<p>and wider capability in the medium to long term.</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>A longer deployment at large scale would imply a breach of Harmony </p>
<p>Guidelines</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> for a very significant number of Service Personnel which may </p>
<p>lead to a marked reduction in morale, retention and, eventually recruitment …</p>
<p>“Once reduced to medium scale – all other things being equal – it would be possible </p>
<p>to maintain a medium scale commitment to Iraq indefinitely … though this would, of </p>
<p>course, constrain our ability to take on other new tasks. Such a commitment would, </p>
<p>however, be extremely expensive …”</p>
<p><b>406. </b> In “pure military terms”, assuming that there was a “rapid and successful </p>
<p>conclusion to the conflict <i>and a permissive environment</i>”, the UK would only be able </p>
<p>to “support” the proposed AOR in southern Iraq until August. Beyond that there would </p>
<p>need to be “substantial Coalition support”. Without it, the UK could be left with “an </p>
<p>unsustainable commitment”. The area currently proposed included “a very substantial </p>
<p>proportion of the Iraqi population, a substantial oilfield content and responsibility for key </p>
<p>religious sites”.</p>
<p><b>407. </b> At the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 19 February, Lt Gen Reith reported that Mr Blair </p>
<p>wanted:</p>
<p>“… an exemplary aftermath but [was] not committed to any particular size of UK </p>
<p>AOR pending further advice on objectives, capability and capacity to sustain. It was </p>
<p>… unclear who the US anticipated placing as sector leaders given that few other </p>
<p>144 </p>
<p>Harmony Guidelines are explained in Section 16.1.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>447</p>
<p>nations would be able to support the task within three months. Therefore, there may </p>
<p>be an unsupportable expectation that the UK would control a relatively large area. </p>
<p>Pragmatically, however, aftermath operations would commence locally whenever </p>
<p>and wherever hostilities ceased, not necessarily coincident with any plan.</p>
<p>“The FCO view was that other nations should be involved as soon as possible and </p>
<p>that early commitment to any nascent US sector plan should be avoided …</p>
<p>“The UK line to take at the Rock Drill would be the commitment in principle to the </p>
<p>immediate involvement in aftermath ops but not yet to any long-term plan, noting the </p>
<p>PM’s wish to exert maximum influence in aftermath planning. Clarity was needed on </p>
<p>the proposed command chain in Phase IV and whose political and legal authority </p>
<p>would prevail.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>408. </b> The Chiefs of Staff agreed that humanitarian operations formed an essential part </p>
<p>of the overall campaign, not least as a force protection measure, and should therefore </p>
<p>attract Treasury contingency funding. Adm Boyce directed that humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>be covered in the joint FCO/MOD position paper on post-conflict issues for the Rock </p>
<p>Drill, which should make clear the potential for conflict and post-conflict phases to run </p>
<p>in parallel from an early stage.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Adm Boyce summarised the key points of the discussion on post-conflict </p>
<p>preparations, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Rock Drill should be used “to secure maximum [UK] influence without early </p>
<p>commitment to detail”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “UN-approved international civilian administrator” would be required.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK Phase IV activity should centre on the region around Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK military commitment should be “scaled down from large to medium  </p>
<p>in the autumn”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the initial expectation was that we would be there for a while, without defining </p>
<p>exactly what it was. But we certainly weren’t expecting, the day after achieving </p>
<p>success, to start drawing down our numbers; we were expecting to be there for  </p>
<p>a considerable period of time.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>448</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Lord Boyce explained: “I thought we would be there for three or four years at least, </p>
<p>and said so at the time.” He added:</p>
<p>“The theoretical planning against the Defence Planning Assumptions is you don’t </p>
<p>do this sort of operation for an extended period longer than about six months. But it </p>
<p>never seemed to me very likely that we would be out [of] there in six months.”</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Asked about the assumption that the UK contingent would reduce to “Brigade </p>
<p>level” or “medium scale”, Lord Boyce replied:</p>
<p>“For the job that we would have to do in the Basra area, it might have been that  </p>
<p>a Brigade size might have been sufficient, as conditions pertained in the middle  </p>
<p>of 2003.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>413. </b> On 20 February, Mr Dominick Chilcott, Head of the IPU, sent Mr Straw an IPU </p>
<p>guidance note for officials taking part in the Rock Drill.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Chilcott’s covering minute to Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“There is barely any mention of the UN in the CENTCOM plans we have seen for </p>
<p>Phase IV (post-conflict) to date. But there are gaps in the plan, which is still fluid and </p>
<p>which we have the opportunity to influence. We shall encourage the US players at </p>
<p>the Rock Drill to draw the conclusion that the job of administering Iraq is too large </p>
<p>even for the US to undertake, that putting together a large Coalition – drawing on </p>
<p>Arab countries – is the key to success, and that this can only be achieved by getting </p>
<p>UN authorisation for Phase IV.”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> The attached guidance note stated that the UK and US agreed that “there must be </p>
<p>a phased approach to the ‘day after’”. For the UK, that meant “(a) military administration, </p>
<p>(b) a UN transitional administration and (c) handover of power to a new Iraqi </p>
<p>government”. The US referred to “stabilisation”, “recovery” and “transition to security”.</p>
<p><b>416. </b> On sectorisation, the guidance stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK will have, in the very short term, to administer the area where its forces are </p>
<p>at the end of hostilities. No commitment to administer divisional size area in the </p>
<p>medium to longer term. More likely a small area around Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No commitment to administering any part of Baghdad.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Where we are involved in administration, will want to be so in an </p>
<p>exemplary fashion.”</p>
<p><b>417. </b> The guidance stated that the UK force would reduce from large scale (three </p>
<p>brigades plus) to medium scale (one brigade plus), “if possible by the autumn”.</p>

<p><b>422. </b> The earlier Assessment, produced on 10 October 2002, is described in Section 3.5.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> The Assessment’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Al Qaida associated terrorists in Iraq and in the Kurdish Autonomous Zone </p>
<p>in Northern Iraq could conduct attacks against Coalition Forces and interests </p>
<p>during, or in the aftermath of, war with Iraq.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In the event of imminent regime collapse, Iraqi chemical and biological material </p>
<p>could be transferred to terrorists including Al Qaida …”</p>
<p><b>424. </b> The Assessment is considered in more detail in Section 3.7.</p>
<p><b>425.  The JIC judged on 19 February that Iraqi conventional forces in southern Iraq </b></p>

<p>information on Saddam’s options given the efforts which would be needed for </p>
<p>reconstruction of the oilfields”.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam was “likely to use CBW first in southern Iraq, if anywhere”. The </p>
<p>implications needed further discussion in the final Assessment “to bring out the </p>
<p>scale of the potential humanitarian crisis”, which would, in the initial period, need </p>
<p>to be dealt with by Coalition troops.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi forces currently guarding southern Iraq are a relatively weak first line  </p>
<p>of conventional defence. They face rapid defeat. There is little evidence so  </p>
<p>far that the Iraqis are preparing for a hard-fought defence of Basra and other </p>
<p>urban centres.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Southern Iraq is the most likely area for the first use of CBW against both </p>
<p>Coalition Forces and the local population.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition Forces will face large refugee flows, possibly compounded by </p>
<p>contamination and panic caused by CBW use. They may also face millions </p>
<p>of Iraqis needing food and clean water without an effective UN presence and </p>
<p>environmental disaster from burning oil wells.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iran does not have an agreed policy on Iraq beyond active neutrality. </p>
<p>Nevertheless Iran may support small-scale cross-border interventions by armed </p>
<p>groups to attack the Mujahideen e-Khalq (MEK). The Islamic Revolutionary </p>
<p>Guards Corps (IRGC) will continue to meddle in southern Iraq. Iranian reactions </p>
<p>to a Coalition presence in Southern Iraq remain unclear but are unlikely to be </p>
<p>aggressive.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Post-Saddam the security situation in the south will be unpredictable. There is </p>
<p>a high risk of revenge killings of former regime officials. Law and order may be </p>
<p>further undermined by settling of scores between armed tribal groups.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Popular support for any post-Saddam administration in the South will depend on </p>
<p>adequately involving the Shia in the government of Iraq as a whole as well as </p>
<p>engaging the remains of the state bureaucracy in the South, local tribal leaders </p>
<p>and Shia clerics in local government.”</p>
<p><b>429. </b> The Assessment stated that there was “limited intelligence on the particular </p>
<p>conditions of southern Iraq”. It had, therefore, “Where possible tried to show how </p>
<p>southern Iraq may differ from other parts of the country” and “to give as full a picture </p>
<p>as possible of the conditions there”. It had also “referred to intelligence describing </p>
<p>conditions prevailing throughout the country”.</p>

<p>“Unlike central and northern Iraq the regular army is not reinforced in the South by </p>
<p>divisions of the elite Republican Guard, which are forbidden by UNSCR 949 [1994] </p>
<p>from moving into the No-Drive Zone south of the 32nd parallel.”</p>
<p><b>431. </b> The JIC stated that the regime was “particularly concerned about the lack of  </p>
<p>loyalty of the Shia” who constituted the “majority of conscripts in the regular army”.  </p>
<p>The absence of the Republican Guard coupled with low morale, poor equipment and </p>
<p>limited training of the Regular Army led the JIC to conclude that the forces guarding </p>
<p>southern Iraq were “<b>a relatively weak first line of conventional defence. They face </b></p>
<p><b>rapid defeat in the face of a massive military onslaught.</b>”</p>
<p><b>432. </b> There were indications that a division of the Regular Army had redeployed </p>
<p>“southwards” to al-Qurnah, “a key town located at a strategic road junction”, and that </p>
<p>elements of another had deployed to the al-Faw Peninsula “in mid-January, apparently </p>
<p>to counter a possible amphibious landing there”. The JIC knew “little about Iraqi plans </p>
<p>for the defence of Basra, but there is as yet no sign of preparations for a hard-fought </p>
<p>defence of this or other urban centres in southern Iraq”. There was no mention in the </p>
<p>Key Judgements that the al-Faw Peninsula had been reinforced.</p>
<p><b>433. </b> The Assessment stated that reporting indicated that Saddam Hussein’s regime had </p>
<p>“contingency plans for a regional military command structure”, and that he had:</p>
<p>“… appointed his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid [Chemical Ali] as regional commander </p>
<p>of the southern sector … (covering the provinces of Basra, Dhi Qar, Maysan and </p>
<p>Muthanna) with authority over all forces in the area. Iraq practice in the Iran/Iraq </p>
<p>war suggests this would include tactical control over CBW. Ali is a loyal member of </p>
<p>Saddam’s inner circle. He was a brutal Governor of occupied Kuwait in 1990-91. </p>
<p>He also played a leading role in suppressing the Shia uprising in 1991 and </p>
<p>Kurdish rebels in the late 1980s (using chemical weapons against the Kurds). His </p>
<p>appointment may reflect an Iraqi leadership view that a particularly loyal and ruthless </p>
<p>figure is needed to take command in the South in a crisis, both to suppress the Shia </p>
<p>and to maintain discipline among the Iraqi forces.”</p>
<p><b>434. </b> The JIC Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“The relative weakness of Iraqi forces in the South and the fact that those forces will </p>
<p>face the brunt of a Coalition attack mean <b>southern Iraq is the most likely area for </b></p>
<p><b>the first use of CBW against both Coalition Forces and the local population</b>.”</p>
<p><b>435. </b> The Assessment added that one report from August 2002 had indicated that </p>
<p>there were:</p>
<p>“… Iraqi plans to use CBW in southern Iraq to cause mass casualties among the </p>
<p>Shia in the event of a US-led attack. The regime would seek to pin the blame for  </p>
<p>the resulting high-level of casualties on the Coalition.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>452</p>
<p><b>436. </b> In its Assessment of 19 February 2003, the JIC stated that: “Reporting has </p>
<p>previously indicated that the regime is concerned about a Shia uprising in the South </p>
<p>after the outbreak of hostilities.” Recent reporting had confirmed its judgements that  </p>
<p>the Shia would be:</p>
<p>“… cautious in opposing Saddam until they see the regime is finished and its </p>
<p>capability to retaliate is substantially weakened. The experience of 1991 will be a </p>
<p>major influence … Even if the initial severity of any Coalition attack makes clear </p>
<p>that the regime is finished, the Shia may still fear what the regime could do to them </p>
<p>in its dying days … Overall we judge <b>there will be no immediate, unified Shia </b></p>
<p><b>response to a Coalition attack</b>.”</p>
<p><b>437. </b> The Assessment stated that:</p>
<p>“Given the Shia in southern Iraq have borne the brunt of regime oppression since </p>
<p>1991, there is a high probability of revenge killing of Ba’ath officials, both Sunni </p>
<p>and Shia. This could be particularly widespread and bloody, if the regime collapses </p>
<p>quickly and few Ba’ath officials have the chance to escape … the extent of any </p>
<p>further breakdown of law and order is difficult to predict. But there will be large </p>
<p>numbers of armed groups and some potential for tribal score settling … Overall </p>
<p>there is a risk of a wider breakdown as the regime’s authority crumbles. There are </p>
<p>no indications … of Shia preparations for an all-out civil war against Sunni Iraqis.”</p>
<p><b>438. </b> The JIC also assessed:</p>
<p>“We know very little about the Iraqi Shia. […] they are not politically organised above </p>
<p>the local, tribal level and there are no clear candidates for overall Shia leadership. </p>
<p>They are very diverse, straddling the urban/rural and secular/Islamist divides.  </p>
<p>They have had little opportunity to discuss their preferred political arrangements. </p>
<p>Shia politics post-Saddam therefore look highly unpredictable.”</p>
<p><b>439. </b> In relation to Iraq’s response, the Assessment stated that there was:</p>
<p>“… no conclusive intelligence on Iraqi plans but they could:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>defend oil wells against attack;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>set fire to them to stop production, cause pollution and disrupt Coalition </p>
<p>Forces; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cause long-term, possibly irreparable, damage to prevent others from </p>
<p>benefitting from future production.</p>
<p>“The potential environmental disaster, coupled with the possible use of CBW … </p>
<p>could cause widespread panic and contamination. This could result in hundreds of </p>
<p>thousands of displaced persons and refugees, many needing immediate help.</p>
<p>“… [I]nterruption of food supplies … could boost the number of refugees and </p>
<p>displaced persons throughout Iraq … Tackling such problems in southern Iraq will </p>

<p>placed if a humanitarian disaster occurs in the South while fighting continues in </p>
<p>close proximity.”</p>
<p><b>440. </b> The points in the Assessment on the post-Saddam Hussein political and security </p>
<p>landscape are set out in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>441. </b> The Assessment also warned that: “The establishment of popular support for </p>
<p>any post-Saddam administration cannot be taken for granted.” The factors that could </p>
<p>undermine it included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“damage to holy sites”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“major civilian casualties”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“heavy-handed peace enforcement”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“failure to rapidly restore law and order”.</p>
<p><b>442. </b> In an Assessment issued on 26 February of how Iraq would respond in northern </p>
<p>Iraq to a Coalition attack, the JIC judged:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi regime would be willing to use CBW against the Coalition and </p>
<p>the Kurds.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>443. </b> The Assessment made clear that that judgement was a continuation from earlier </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><i><b>Iraq at the Crossroads: </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>State and Society in the Shadow of Regime Change</b></i></p>
<p>Mr David Ochmanek, a senior analyst at RAND and a former member of the US Air </p>
<p>Force and a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy in the Pentagon from </p>
<p>1993 to 1995, concluded that a robust invasion force would be needed because Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s troops were “unlikely to crack unless faced with an overwhelming adversary”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>Dr Toby Dodge, a Research Fellow at the ESRC Centre for the Study of Globalisation </p>
<p>and Regionalisation, University of Warwick, wrote that the Iraqi regime had sacrificed the </p>
<p>military efficiency of the Iraqi armed forces to ensure they did not pose a threat to Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s continued rule. That meant that although conventional military opposition to an </p>
<p>invasion might be short lived, a coup launched against the regime from within the security </p>
<p>services would happen, if at all, in the final moments of any war. The military campaign </p>
<p>would be fought in the cities of Iraq, primarily Baghdad, against a background of intense </p>
<p>media coverage.</p>
<p>Dr Faleh A. Jaber, an Iraqi sociologist based in London, argued that the Iraqi Army might </p>
<p>react in ways comparable to 1991 with sections opting for mutiny, some surrendering and </p>
<p>others fighting to defend the Government. A coup was unlikely unless the US succeeded </p>
<p>in attracting a considerable segment of the “ruling tribal alliance” to its side.</p>
<p>In a separate essay, Dr Jaber concluded that, in the light of the inherent weakness of </p>
<p>organised political parties in the South, the response to an invasion could range from </p>
<p>sustained, organised or disorganised rebellions to mob-like violence or gangster-like </p>
<p>retribution. That would help bring Ba’athist rule to an end, but could also bring forward </p>
<p>unfettered chaos.</p>
<p>Several contributors to the Adelphi Paper warned of the potential for violent disorder in </p>
<p>post-conflict Iraq (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>446. </b> Mr Blair read the Adelphi Paper in mid-February and asked a number of </p>
<p>questions, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What is our military’s assessment of the likely consequences of an attack  </p>
<p>on Iraq; ie how many casualties; how quickly the collapse?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Why do we not think the SRG [Special Republican Guard] will dig in, inside </p>
<p>Baghdad and fight a guerrilla campaign?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What is the prospect of a pre-emptive BW or CW attack on our troops in Kuwait, </p>
<p>and are we certain we are adequately prepared and our troops protected?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Why will the 2,000 key individuals and the 26,000 SRG personnel … not fight  </p>
<p>to the death, given the hatred of them by ordinary Iraqis?”</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>455</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Mr Blair’s questions about post-conflict issues, including how to prevent the Shia </p>
<p>“rising up to take over from the Sunnis”, are addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>448. </b> In its response on 24 February, the MOD advised that the US plan was to  </p>
<p>achieve “overwhelming effect very early in the campaign” and to dislocate the regime  </p>
<p>(by decapitating command and control and disrupting communications), supported  </p>
<p>by the deployment of ground forces into Iraq and their move “towards Baghdad”.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The MOD stated that, apart from the practical consequences of those elements of the </p>
<p>plan, they should “remove any doubt in Iraqi minds about the Coalition’s determination </p>
<p>to remove the regime”. It was “therefore possible that the regime will collapse … in the </p>
<p>first few days. Nonetheless it is impossible to predict … and US planning assumes up to </p>
<p>125 days of decisive ground operations”.</p>
<p><b>449. </b> The SRG would be “the final line of defence in inner Baghdad … [and] may have </p>
<p>tactical control of CBW within the city”. Security elements close to the regime might </p>
<p>“fight until their position becomes untenable”. Lack of training and the attitude of the </p>
<p>population might “mitigate the SRG’s ability to mount a protracted guerrilla campaign”. </p>
<p>There were fewer SRG personnel in Baghdad than the Adelphi Paper estimated; and </p>
<p>“their capability to mount any form of organised resistance … is minimal”.</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Iraq retained “the capability (through a variety of means) pre-emptively to deliver </p>
<p>CBW against Coalition Forces in Kuwait. The question is one of intent.” There was  </p>
<p>“no intelligence” to indicate that the regime was “currently planning a pre-emptive strike”. </p>
<p>In the MOD view, that was “highly unlikely whilst Saddam believes war can be averted”. </p>
<p>If he was convinced that war was “inevitable and imminent”, that “might make a  </p>
<p>pre-emptive move more attractive” but it was “more likely that Saddam would deploy </p>
<p>CBW after the onset of the campaign”. The planned levels of Nuclear Biological </p>
<p>Chemical (NBC) defence equipment “should enable all troops to withstand initial BW or </p>
<p>CW attack” (see Section 6.3).</p>
<p><b>451. </b> On the potential number of casualties, the MOD stated:</p>
<p>“This question is easier to ask than to answer. Casualty estimation is an imprecise </p>
<p>and contextual process, requiring a significant number of assumptions to be made </p>
<p>for it to take place at all. Whilst the range of outcomes of a specific engagement </p>
<p>in which both sides choose to fight may be predicted with reasonable confidence, </p>
<p>forecasting which engagements will take place, in what sequence and under what </p>
<p>conditions is much less certain.”</p>
<p><b>452. </b> The MOD explained that it was harder still to take account of low-probability, </p>
<p>high-impact events, such as a successful chemical or biological attack. In the worst </p>
<p>foreseeable case, a surprise chemical attack could result in up to 100 individuals being </p>
<p>killed and over 200 needing medical treatment.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>456</p>
<p><b>453. </b> Estimates of potential UK casualties from a ground campaign, excluding Special </p>
<p>Forces casualties and casualties incurred through fighting in urban areas, were between </p>
<p>30 and 60 individuals killed and between 120 and 200 individuals wounded.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> The total Iraqi land battle casualties were assessed as “in the order of 500-1,200 </p>
<p>killed and 2,000-4,800 wounded”. Detailed assessments of likely casualties from the air </p>
<p>campaign, including civilian casualties, could only be made on a “target-by-target” basis </p>
<p>and this work was “in hand”. The MOD stated:</p>
<p>“Iraqi civilian casualties from anything other than the air campaign are likely to be </p>
<p>relatively few, unless Coalition Forces become engaged in fighting in urban areas.”</p>
<p><b>455. </b> The MOD estimates were based on assumptions that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi forces would not suffer a rapid, total collapse at the start of the campaign;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the campaign would last 30 days; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US and UK operational plans did not change in any significant way.</p>
<p><b>The Red Team</b></p>
<p>On 15 January, Mr Hoon had asked for work on predicting Saddam Hussein’s possible </p>
<p>responses to military action to be taken forward in the context of a comprehensive  </p>
<p>“red teaming” of the military plan to identify all conceivable risks to its success.</p>
<p>The “Red Team” was established within the Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) and was led </p>
<p>by Major General Andrew Ridgway, the Chief of Defence Intelligence (designate).</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Its purpose was:</p>
<p>“… to provide COS [Chiefs of Staff] and key planners within the MOD and Whitehall </p>
<p>with an independent view of current intelligence assumptions and key judgements,  </p>
<p>to challenge if appropriate and to identify areas where more work may be required.”</p>
<p>Papers were copied to the Chiefs of Staff, PJHQ, the MOD, the FCO, the IPU and the JIC. </p>
<p>There is no evidence that they were seen in No.10.</p>
<p>The first Red Team report was issued on 28 February.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> Its key judgements drew heavily </p>
<p>on earlier JIC Assessments and included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for Coalition Forces to assume immediate responsibility for law and </p>
<p>order to avoid other forces stepping into an internal security vacuum;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that most Iraqis would initially view the Coalition as a liberating force, but support </p>
<p>was likely to erode rapidly if the interim administration was not acceptable to the </p>
<p>population and it could not see a road map towards a pluralist, representative  </p>
<p>Iraqi-led administration; and</p>

<p>the risk of creating fertile ground for Al Qaida, which could deliberately cause </p>
<p>civilian casualties to undermine the establishment of a representative Iraqi-led </p>
<p>administration.</p>
<p>The report stated that Al Qaida:</p>
<p>“… seeks removal of Western presence/influence from the Gulf and wants to see </p>
<p>the US/UK operation go badly. AQ are currently in some disarray but will wish to </p>
<p>take the opportunity presented by the US/UK operation to re-establish credibility and </p>
<p>encourage widespread anti-Western activity in the region. However:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Initially AQ shared a common goal with the Coalition: regime change. Once </p>
<p>completed, goals will diverge rapidly and UK/US forces will present a rich </p>
<p>target for terrorist attack.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>AQ feared the establishment of a pluralist, representative Iraqi government </p>
<p>as it undermines their argument that Muslims can only achieve self-</p>
<p>determination in a unitary Islamic theocracy. They could deliberately cause </p>
<p>civilian casualties to undermine the Coalition’s position.”</p>

<p>The “main body” of 7 Armoured Brigade personnel was expected to arrive in </p>
<p>Kuwait between 25 February and 10 March. An initial capability of two armoured </p>
<p>battlegroups would be complete in theatre by 3 March, with the “vast majority”  </p>
<p>of their equipment in place by 9 March. They would have full operating capability </p>
<p>by 20 March.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deployment of aircraft had “only just begun”.</p>
<p><b>459. </b> The MOD wrote that “the precise timing of the commencement of the land </p>
<p>campaign” had not been finalised. Land operations were expected to begin in “the first </p>
<p>few days” of the campaign.</p>
<p><b>460. </b> While the overall US plan remained as briefed to Mr Blair, its details might </p>
<p>“yet develop in important ways”. Much of that revolved around timings; if the current </p>
<p>uncertainty over the deployment of US land forces through Turkey was not resolved,  </p>
<p>it could “require changes to the plan in the South to compensate for lack  </p>
<p>of ‘Northern effects’”.</p>
<p><b>461. </b> The latest “in a succession of US deadlines for Turkish agreement” on land forces </p>
<p>was 22 February, “after which (they say) they would send their 4th Infantry Division </p>
<p>south”.</p>
<p><b>462. </b> The US was “looking at a number of variations on the current plan”. </p>
<p>If implemented, those might give UK forces “(particularly 7 Armoured Brigade) a more </p>
<p>substantial role than under the current plan”. The MOD stated:</p>
<p>“No commitment to any changed plan will be given to the US, even in principle, </p>
<p>without Ministerial approval.”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> The MOD wrote that Saddam Hussein remained focused on averting a US attack </p>
<p>and it was only once he had determined that was “unavoidable and imminent” that he </p>
<p>would consider pre-emptive options. Saddam Hussein currently had the capability to </p>
<p>pre-emptively:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Militarily re-occupy the Kurdish Autonomous Zone within 72 hours. </p>
<p>A humanitarian crisis would result.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mount a limited CBW strike on Coalition Forces/civil populace of Kuwait. In the </p>
<p>very worst case this could be effected within hours of a decision to do so.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mount a limited CBW strike on regional neighbours (most likely Israel). Again in </p>
<p>the very worst case this could happen within hours of a decision.”</p>
<p><b>464. </b> The MOD’s ability to provide “unambiguous intelligence” warning of those events </p>
<p>would be minimal.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> The MOD was content that the current draft of campaign objectives offered </p>
<p>“a coherent basis for UK participation” but recognised that a legal basis for the use </p>
<p>of force was needed before the objectives could come into effect. It also required </p>

<p><b>469. </b> Gen Franks told Mr Blair that threats came, in ascending order, from:</p>

<p>between 25 and 100 km from Baghdad; and the Special Republican Guard (SRG) </p>
<p>stationed in downtown Baghdad to defend the regime itself. In Baghdad, there were </p>

<p>rather than months” and that “the force available was equal to the task”. Resources were </p>
<p>“robust and capable in the west and south, and in the air, and information management </p>
<p>was getting better”. The northern front was problematic “because of the Turks”.</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Mr Blair asked if Gen Franks had “any idea” of the scale of likely civilian casualties </p>
<p>and “underlined our preference for a short conflict”.</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Gen Franks replied that:</p>
<p>“… during the 43 days of the Gulf War, 3,300 targets had been attacked. Plans </p>
<p>for this campaign envisaged attacking 1,500 targets in the first 96 hours. Some </p>
<p>11 percent of weapons did not hit their precise target. So we must expect some </p>
<p>civilian casualties. But the intensity of the initial attack was key to reducing the </p>
<p>duration of the conflict.”</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Gen Franks said that dual-use facilities, where civilians worked alongside military </p>
<p>personnel, “were a real problem”; they raised the risk of civilian casualties and the </p>
<p>destruction of infrastructure that could delay reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Adm Boyce stated that civilian casualties were likely to be in the “low hundreds”. </p>
<p>Gen Franks stated that ways to minimise civilian casualties were being explored.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr Blair concluded that “we must set out our strategy: to destroy the regime but </p>
<p>minimise civilian casualties”.</p>

<p><b>476. </b> There was also a discussion about the role of the UN in a post-Saddam Hussein </p>

<p><b>477.  When Mr Hoon met Gen Franks, he stated that the UK was keen for a serious </b></p>
<p><b>and substantial role for UK forces.</b></p>
<p><b>478.  Gen Franks told Mr Hoon that it was “not yet necessary to clarify the final </b></p>
<p><b>plan”. He “understood the strategic requirement for a UK profile”.</b></p>
<p><b>479. </b> The same day, Gen Franks had attended a working breakfast hosted by </p>
<p>Adm Boyce and briefed the Chiefs of Staff.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> Sir David Manning, Sir Richard Dearlove </p>
<p>and Mr Watkins were also present.</p>
<p><b>480. </b> Mr Watkins sent a record of the meeting to Mr Hoon (who was due to meet  </p>
<p>Gen Franks in Qatar on 26 February), stating that Gen Franks had said the US would </p>
<p>“make the call on Turkey tomorrow” and that while the ability to deploy “heavy armour” </p>
<p>from the North would have been helpful, it was not critical.</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Watkins advised Mr Hoon to press Gen Franks on the precise utilisation of UK </p>
<p>forces in Phase III (the conflict phase of operations): “Politically and constitutionally, </p>
<p>Ministers need to know this and in good time.”</p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Hoon and Air Marshal Brian Burridge, UK National Contingent Commander </p>
<p>(NCC), met Gen Franks in Qatar on 26 February.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>483. </b> The record of the meeting reported that there was a chance to get a northern </p>
<p>option in place through the Parliamentary process in Turkey, but sadly the Parliamentary </p>
<p>debate had been suspended.</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Gen Franks had said there were now 195,000 US troops in the region and, </p>
<p>when that figure rose to 250,000 in mid-March, he would be ready to support any </p>
<p>“policy decision”.</p>
<p><b>485. </b> Gen Franks believed that it would “be possible to reach an agreement” on </p>
<p>targeting. He recognised the difficulties associated with dual-use targets but there could </p>
<p>be “serious military consequences” if they shied away from some of the communication </p>
<p>facilities. Mr Hoon explained he would have “no problem clearing the targets where there </p>
<p>was a definite military advantage”.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> Mr Hoon had noted the “proportionally very significant investment which the UK </p>
<p>had made to the force build up” and “was keen for a serious and substantial role for </p>
<p>British forces”.</p>

<p>461</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Gen Franks had said that “the British forces with whom he had talked had made </p>
<p>this clear to him”. There were a variety of roles which could be assigned to units under </p>
<p>his command and “it was not yet necessary to clarify the final plan”. He would be in  </p>
<p>a better position to do so in seven to 10 days (5 to 8 March).</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Hoon asked whether the UK role would only be determined after offensive </p>
<p>action had started. Gen Franks said that was not the case but he had to have early </p>
<p>flexible options in case there was a requirement to move before the armour was ready. </p>
<p>He “understood the strategic requirement for a UK profile in any operation”.</p>
<p><b>489. </b> On 28 February, Mr Hoon’s Private Office sent Sir David Manning an update on </p>
<p>military planning.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> With respect to post-conflict operations, it warned that the UK was </p>
<p>“currently at risk of taking on a very substantial commitment” that it would have “great </p>
<p>difficulty in sustaining beyond the immediate conclusion of conflict”. That is addressed  </p>
<p>in detail in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>490.  On 4 March, Lt Gen Reith advocated an expanded combat role for UK forces </b></p>
<p><b>to the Chiefs of Staff.</b></p>
<p><b>491. </b> On 4 March, Lt Gen Reith sent the Chiefs of Staff two papers setting out proposals </p>
<p>for employing UK land forces on combat missions with or without “a dedicated ‘UK box’” </p>
<p>based on “the agreed 1(UK) Div AO”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Lt Gen Reith explained that a “UK box” would “allow UK forces to move first in </p>
<p>a ground offensive and thereby set the conditions for the ‘exemplary performance’ </p>
<p>in Phase IV”, but US resistance to the creation of a UK box would “probably only be </p>
<p>overcome by high level intervention”.</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Lt Gen Reith asked the Chiefs of Staff whether, in those circumstances, he should </p>
<p>“explore integration of UK niche elements into US planning on a task, time and space </p>
<p>limited basis”, or whether “the ‘exemplary performance’ for Phase IV should override </p>
<p>opportunities to make a significant contribution to Coalition Phase III operations”.</p>
<p><b>494. </b> In the first of the two papers, Lt Gen Reith set out:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div’s mission was likely to be “to attack to defeat enemy forces within </p>
<p>boundaries, secure key oil infrastructure and seize Umm Qasr port to prevent </p>
<p>or mitigate environmental disaster and enable humanitarian operations”. </p>
<p>Subsequently the UK division would relieve US forces to support their rapid </p>
<p>movement north.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>3 Commando Brigade would seize the oil infrastructure on the al-Faw Peninsula, </p>
<p>Umm Qasr port, and set the conditions for Coalition mine countermeasures </p>
<p>operations and the clearance of the Khawr Abd Allah waterway.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade and 7 Armoured Brigade would relieve US forces: </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade would assume responsibility for the security of the </p>
<p>Rumaylah oilfields and 7 Armoured Brigade would be responsible for the </p>
<p>isolation of Basra, securing az-Zubayr, and the protection of oil infrastructure </p>
<p>within its boundaries.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security of Basra International Airport and Basra itself were described as  </p>
<p>“be prepared to” tasks.</p>
<p><b>495. </b> Lt Gen Reith commented:</p>
<p>“Critically, this plan only really sees 3 Cdo Bde being committed to combat </p>
<p>operations with the net effect … that the balance of the UK land element may be </p>
<p>largely involved in Phase IV operations unless there is some form of egress from </p>
<p>Basra or movement to the south or west by 6 Armd Div [Iraqi forces].”</p>
<p><b>496. </b> Lt Gen Reith summarised that the plan:</p>
<p>“… probably doesn’t appropriately reflect the level of our commitment of ground </p>
<p>forces. Moreover, the whole issue of teeing soldiers up for combat operations must, </p>
<p>potentially, be difficult on the basis of the tasks currently on offer for 7 and 16 Bdes. </p>
<p>In other words, whilst the task is eminently manageable, it probably represents,  </p>
<p>for the Army, a poor return, militarily, on the forces committed.”</p>
<p><b>497. </b> Lt Gen Reith addressed the advantages and disadvantages of “UK ownership of </p>
<p>its full AO from the start”. Under the existing Base Plan, the UK AO would expand into </p>
<p>space vacated by US forces as they moved north and UK forces would not be able to </p>
<p>shape their own Phase IV AOR. Lt Gen Reith explained that one of the contingency </p>
<p>plans already worked up by the Land Component Command (LCC) assumed full UK </p>
<p>ownership of its AO from the start. It would see all three UK brigades “potentially being </p>
<p>committed to combat operations and being responsible for defeating all enemy forces … </p>
<p>This plan also allows UK forces to shape the AO in Phase III for Phase IV by employing </p>
<p>an appropriate balance of kinetic and non-kinetic effect.”</p>
<p><b>498. </b> Lt Gen Reith concluded: “There can be no doubt at all that this represents a far </p>
<p>better option for UK forces than the Base Plan”.</p>
<p><b>499. </b> In the second paper, Lt Gen Reith explained that his forthcoming meetings </p>
<p>with Lt Gen McKiernan and others would “almost certainly be the last chance that </p>
<p>the operational commanders will have to discuss the plan face to face before ground </p>
<p>operations commence”. US commanders were likely to press him on UK land </p>
<p>contributions beyond the provisions in the Base Plan.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>463</p>
<p><b>500. </b> Lt Gen Reith put forward two options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“National focus with limited operational exposure.” The Base Plan, involving </p>
<p>“operations within the AO as presently defined, concentrating on making </p>
<p>the early transition from Phase III to Phase IV, with an end state defined as </p>
<p>‘exemplary performance’ in Phase IV within Basra region”. One advantage of  </p>
<p>the Base Plan was that it preserved UK combat power “for the major Phase IV </p>
<p>task in the AO (Basra, for example is a city of 1.5m people and may not be  </p>
<p>a benign environment)”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Coalition focus with unconstrained operational exposure.” This approach </p>
<p>reflected a number of contingency plans (CONPLANS) in different stages of </p>
<p>development and involved “selective deployment of UK formations where their </p>
<p>capabilities are most efficiently used, consistent with the requirement to service </p>
<p>the Basra AO”. Among the disadvantages of this approach was a reduction in </p>
<p>the number of troops available for Phase IV operations in the UK AO, which </p>
<p>“may impact on our ability to produce exemplary early effect during Phase IV”.</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Lt Gen Reith concluded:</p>
<p>“US commanders are likely to press on branch planning and UK land contributions </p>
<p>beyond the provisions of the Base Plan.</p>
<p>“The situation is changing: the potential for a UK Box remains my aspiration but is  </p>
<p>in practical terms receding …</p>
<p>“In discussing the campaign, and subject to their [the Chiefs of Staff] agreement, </p>
<p>CJO [Chief of Joint Operations, Lt Gen Reith] will balance the desire to husband our </p>
<p>land forces for Phase IV in our own AO, against the possible Coalition requirement </p>
<p>to take a greater part of the Phase III effort, with the risks this implies in terms of the </p>
<p>ease with which we transition to Phase IV.”</p>
<p><b>502. </b> The Chiefs of Staff discussed the papers on 5 March.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> They rejected the proposal </p>
<p>for a UK box.</p>
<p><b>503. </b> In Lt Gen Reith’s absence, Maj Gen Fry sought guidance from the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on offering “UK ‘niche’ contributions beyond the provisions of the Base Plan” in the </p>
<p>context of the requirement to deliver an exemplary Phase IV.</p>
<p><b>504. </b> The Chiefs of Staff noted that until the arrival of US 4th Infantry Division, the </p>
<p>UK would be providing “a disproportionately high percentage of the combat power </p>
<p>in the South and that it would disadvantage the Coalition campaign to ring-fence UK </p>
<p>land forces in a national boundary”. A more flexible approach would be needed and a </p>
<p>“balance had to be struck between achieving closure to Phase III and the delivery of  </p>
<p>an ‘exemplar’ Phase IV”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>464</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Adm Boyce directed Lt Gen Reith to “push for a ‘niche’ role for the UK … and </p>
<p>make it clear that the UK was ready to be asked to contribute further in order to exploit </p>
<p>any operational opportunities that arose during the campaign”, subject to US logistics </p>
<p>support and assurances that UK forces would be “relieved-in-place” as soon as possible </p>
<p>for Phase IV activities in the South.</p>
<p><b>506. </b> Discussing a draft of a Ministerial note on Phase IV operations, the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>noted that delivering an exemplary Phase IV required “the concomitant resources and </p>
<p>OGD [Other Government Departments] commitment”. Adm Boyce stressed that Phase </p>
<p>IV could not be delivered by military activity alone.</p>
<p><b>507. </b> Adm Boyce directed that the Ministerial note should include indicative numbers to </p>
<p>give a better understanding of what was being provided in terms of medium scale and </p>
<p>large scale commitment. The minutes recorded:</p>
<p>“It was also important to emphasise that MOD commitments should be guided  </p>
<p>by DPAs [Defence Planning Assumptions], which provided for large scale up to  </p>
<p>6 months. Medium scale was to be considered a divisional HQ plus a bde [brigade] </p>
<p>of troops. Undertaking such an operation for longer would break harmony guidelines </p>
<p>and was likely to lead to the Department’s failure to meet its PSA [Public Service </p>
<p>Agreement] targets.”</p>
<p><b>508.  The MOD advised Mr Blair on 6 March that the UK might play additional </b></p>
<p><b>“cutting edge” roles in combat operations.</b></p>
<p><b>509. </b> On 6 March, Mr Watkins informed Sir David Manning that the MOD’s assumption </p>
<p>that UK land forces would “hold ground behind the advancing US formations” had been </p>
<p>“overtaken by events”.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> The “continuing impasse over Turkey” could result in the UK </p>
<p>playing “additional ‘cutting edge’ roles”.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Both 3 Commando Brigade and 16 Air Assault Brigade had achieved their </p>
<p>full operating capability and 7 Armoured Brigade was expected to do so “by about </p>
<p>18 March”. Although the timing of the start of military action remained uncertain,  </p>
<p>“a sizeable proportion of the UK land package” was now likely to be in a position to </p>
<p>participate in combat operations from the start of the ground campaign.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p>“As a result, 1(UK) Div is now likely to represent a higher and more significant </p>
<p>proportion of the overall combat power available in the early stages of the ground </p>
<p>campaign.”</p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Hoon and the Chiefs of Staff judged that “it would not be wise at this late stage </p>
<p>to seek a major revision to the US plan”, but that it could make better use of some of the </p>

<p>niche capabilities in 1 (UK) Div. Mr Hoon had agreed that the UK should encourage US </p>
<p>commanders to identify a niche role.</p>
<p><b>513. </b> The US was looking at a number of variations to its plan, including involving </p>
<p>7 Armoured Brigade in “decisive manoeuvre operations beyond south-eastern Iraq” and </p>
<p>“possibly in a decisive phase around Baghdad”. That would raise a number of issues, </p>
<p>including for post-conflict operations:</p>
<p>“At the beginning of Phase IV … operations, 1(UK) Division would initially find itself </p>
<p>spread across two different areas at once. While 7 Armoured Brigade was engaged </p>
<p>in combat operations around Baghdad, 1(UK) Division would have only its two </p>
<p>light brigades available to deal with any immediate problems in south-eastern Iraq. </p>
<p>At the very least we would need US assurances that they would facilitate rapid </p>
<p>re- adjustment at the earliest opportunity, to allow 7 Armoured Brigade to rejoin the </p>
<p>rest of 1(UK) Division.”</p>
<p><b>514. </b> Mr Watkins explained that Mr Hoon and the Chiefs of Staff had therefore agreed </p>
<p>that the UK “should not actively seek this sort of wider role, but that we should be </p>
<p>prepared to consider any unsolicited US requests on their merits”. The MOD would </p>
<p>produce further advice on the outcome of discussions with the US, but warned it was </p>
<p>likely that “decisions may need to be made very rapidly”.</p>
<p><b>515.  In early March, Lt Gen Reith discussed the expansion of the UK combat role </b></p>
<p><b>with US commanders. He continued to advise the Chiefs of Staff to extend the </b></p>
<p><b>UK AO.</b></p>
<p><b>516. </b> Lt Gen Reith visited the Middle East from 5 to 7 March where he discussed </p>
<p>optimising the use of 1 (UK) Div combat power “in some detail” with General John </p>
<p>Abizaid, Gen Franks’ Deputy Commander (Forward), and then with Lt Gen McKiernan.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>517. </b> The record of the visit stated that Lt Gen Reith “offered” two options for UK forces </p>
<p>to play a role in later operations:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using 7 Armoured Brigade to provide additional combat power to either 1 MEF or </p>
<p>5 Corps in their advance on Baghdad; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>16 Air Assault Brigade to be deployed forward by air to the Baghdad area to </p>
<p>“assist in developing stability in case of sudden regime collapse”.</p>
<p><b>518. </b> A manuscript note on Maj Gen Fry’s copy of the record stated:</p>
<p>“CDS was most unhappy … COS [Chiefs of Staff] &amp; SofS [Secretary of State] </p>
<p>riding instructions were to not offer anything outside the UK AO but be receptive </p>
<p>to requests (‘request mode rather than push mode’). CDS wanted to talk to CJO </p>

<p>171</p>
<p><b>519. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, visited UK forces in Kuwait </p>
<p>between 6 and 8 March and was involved in Lt Gen Reith’s discussion with Lt Gen </p>
<p>McKiernan.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>520. </b> In his report to Adm Boyce, Gen Jackson offered two observations on the </p>
<p>Phase III plan:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the UK’s “limited role” was “by no means ideal given the considerable </p>
<p>capabilities” inherent within 1 (UK) Div; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“just how little combat power the US have on the ground” now that 4th Infantry </p>
<p>Division could not deploy in time to influence the outcome. “Holding a little under </p>
<p>one third of the available coalition armour, 1 (UK) Armoured Division has combat </p>
<p>power that may prove decisive for operations around Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Gen Jackson added that it was for that reason that US forces had “made very clear </p>
<p>their wish” to use 7 Armoured Brigade for subsequent tasks. That would be discussed at </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff meeting that week.</p>
<p><b>522. </b> On what might happen after combat operations, Gen Jackson wrote:</p>
<p>“… I judge that, realistically, it will be some time before Coalition partners join US </p>
<p>and British forces in any real strength, if at all. I draw two conclusions from this: first, </p>
<p>that as much as possible of Iraq’s administrative and military structure should be </p>
<p>preserved; and second, that we should beware rapid US drawdown on the American </p>
<p>assumption that UK (perhaps through the ARRC) will form the focus for  </p>
<p>an international force that in the event fails to materialise.</p>
<p>“… GOC 1 Div [Maj Gen Brims] made it clear to me that in clarifying his role in </p>
<p>Phase IV, he needed simply to know what his title was, to whom he would be </p>
<p>responsible, and how quickly a civil administrator would be appointed. While he </p>
<p>judges that Basra has adequate short-term food stocks, it will urgently need water, </p>
<p>electricity and medical supplies … Only the ICRC has humanitarian stocks in </p>
<p>position … there was little confidence within 1 Div that DFID has a coherent plan </p>
<p>in place. I support GOC 1 Div’s intent to manage Phase IV with as light a touch as </p>
<p>possible, but it will be important to establish the rule of law quickly – the question,  </p>
<p>as in Kosovo, will be whose law?”</p>
<p><b>523. </b> Gen Jackson concluded:</p>

<p>DEVELOPMENT OF PHASE IV PLANNING</p>
<p><b>524.  On 6 March, Mr Blair chaired the first Ministerial meeting convened solely  </b></p>
<p><b>to address humanitarian and other post-conflict issues.</b></p>
<p><b>525.  Officials recommended that the UK should not seek responsibility for general </b></p>
<p><b>administration of a geographical area of Iraq in the medium term and pressed </b></p>
<p><b>Ministers to take an urgent decision on the issue.</b></p>
<p><b>526.  No decision was taken.</b></p>
<p><b>527. </b> After Cabinet on 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post-conflict issues  </p>
<p>with Mr Brown, Mr Hoon, Ms Clare Short (International Development Secretary), </p>
<p>Baroness Symons (joint FCO/DTI Minister of State for International Trade and </p>
<p>Investment), Sir Michael Jay (FCO Permanent Under Secretary) and “other officials”.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>528. </b> The annotated agenda and the meeting are described in more detail in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>529. </b> With the invasion possibly only weeks away, the IPU explained that US and UK </p>
<p>planning assumed that, in the “medium term after the conflict”, Coalition Forces would </p>
<p>be “re-deployed into six or seven geographical sectors in order to provide a secure </p>
<p>environment for the civil transitional administration to conduct humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>and reconstruction work”. The US expected the UK Division in Iraq to be responsible </p>
<p>for a geographical sector, which would be very expensive and carry wider resource </p>
<p>implications. The UK Division would probably be based in or near Basra, with the size </p>
<p>of its AOR depending on a number of factors, including the permissiveness of the </p>
<p>environment and the size of the Division in relation to the rest of the Coalition.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> The annotated agenda stated:</p>
<p>“Ministers need urgently to take a view on this before the military planning </p>
<p>assumptions become a fait accompli.”</p>

<p>To choose between options for a medium-term post-conflict military presence. </p>
<p>The Chiefs of Staff believed it would be necessary to reduce the UK’s military </p>
<p>contribution from about 45,000 to 15,000 in the “medium term (by the autumn)” </p>
<p>to “avoid long term damage to the Armed Forces”. At the same time, the US </p>

<p>of Basra, but there were four options available:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a brigade responsible for security in a single province;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a UK divisional headquarters could take responsibility for security, under </p>
<p>Coalition command, in a wider area of Iraq (US planners envisaged Basra, </p>
<p>Maysan, Dhi Qar and Wasit being a single sector), supported by Coalition </p>
<p>partners, which, the paper recognised, could be difficult to find;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>deployment of the ARRC in addition or as an alternative to a brigade; or</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>withdrawal of all forces in the medium term, although it was warned that </p>
<p>would be politically difficult.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether to follow the US plan, which had to be right, to administer Iraq as </p>
<p>a whole and not seek general UK responsibility for the administration of </p>
<p>any geographic area in the medium term. In any area where the UK took </p>
<p>responsibility for security, it could, with a UN mandate, also take on wider </p>
<p>responsibility for reconstruction (including humanitarian assistance and aspects </p>
<p>of civil administration), but that would “very likely be beyond the resources of  </p>
<p>the UK alone and have implications for domestic Departments”.</p>
<p><b>532.  MOD advice to Mr Hoon was explicit about the inadequacy of those </b></p>
<p><b>preparations.</b></p>
<p><b>533. </b> The MOD briefing for Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“… any UK involvement in the administration of post-conflict Iraq will necessarily </p>
<p>require a significant civilian administrative and specialist component; this component </p>
<p>has not yet been identified or resourced by OGDs. <b>This is the key issue. </b></p>
<p><b>The success of civil administration will be essential to Iraq’s long term future. </b></p>
<p><b>The UK military cannot do this on their own.</b></p>
<p>“… [T]he current Defence Planning Assumption is that UK forces can only sustain </p>
<p>large scale operations for a period of six months without doing long term damage </p>
<p>to capability. This implies that UK forces reduce to a medium scale (i.e. roughly one </p>
<p>brigade) post-conflict TELIC commitment.</p>
<p>“… US planning is currently tending to assume UK involvement in Phase IV at a </p>
<p>level that is the maximum, if not higher than, that we can sustain. <b>If Ministers wish </b></p>
<p><b>to set limits on the UK’s Phase IV contribution they should be set now so that </b></p>
<p><b>US planning can be adjusted </b>…</p>
<p>“… [A]s US planning stands, the UK will need substantial support from other nations. </p>
<p>There are no arrangements yet in place formally to gather such support. Such </p>
<p>support will be largely contingent on a <i>suitable</i> second/third UNSCR and a UN </p>
<p>mandate for the occupation of Iraq. The FCO need to build on their recent ‘market </p>

<p>174</p>
<p><b>534. </b> Possible levels of UK commitment to Phase IV were set out in an annex:</p>
<p>“i. </p>
<p><b>Maximum payoff (and maximum cost)</b>: Tackle a problem area (eg Basra) with </p>
<p>a UK two-star lead (subsequently becoming a multinational HQ). A UK Brigade </p>
<p>in the SE sector. HQ ARRC taking on the CJTF(I) role early for six months. UK </p>
<p>involvement (but not military) in a reconstruction pillar. This would be contingent </p>
<p>on US burden sharing …</p>
<p>ii. </p>
<p><b>Regional (+)</b>: The SE Sector with a UK two-star lead (subsequently becoming </p>
<p>a multinational HQ). A UK Brigade in the SE sector. No HQ ARRC but UK </p>
<p>involvement (including military) in a reconstruction pillar and a significant staff </p>

<p><b>535. </b> Mirroring the urgency expressed in the IPU Annotated Agenda, the MOD warned </p>
<p>that, in the absence of settled UK policy on the scale or duration of the UK contribution </p>
<p>to post-conflict Iraq, that contribution risked being determined “by decisions being taken </p>
<p>by CENTCOM now”.</p>
<p><b>536. </b> The MOD identified a number of specific concerns, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US plans envisaged the UK having responsibility for security in one of seven </p>
<p>sectors. The UK had neither agreed formally nor challenged the US assumption. </p>
<p>Nor had other departments scoped what non-military UK contributions could be </p>
<p>sustained. The UK was “currently at risk of taking on an unsustainable task if </p>
<p>there is no further Coalition contribution to the occupation of Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the UK did lead a military sector, there was a risk of the UK military being </p>
<p>“intimately involved” in the civil administration, “not a role they would seek”. </p>
<p>There was “a pressing need to identify civil capacity across the international civil </p>
<p>admin effort, including to support civil administration in a UK military sector”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was “carrying some risk of early humanitarian assistance failures in the </p>
<p>UK AO”.</p>

<p>470</p>
<p><b>537. </b> The policy considerations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the degree to which the UK wanted to stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US – </p>
<p>“a fundamental political judgement … where are the UK’s red lines?”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s attitude to the future of Iraq. “Does the UK wish to become intimately </p>
<p>involved in reconstruction and civil administration? This is not a military task … </p>
<p>but it will both affect and be affected by the level of military engagement. It will </p>
<p>also have significant resource implications, across government.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> The briefing concluded with a section on the worst case scenario:</p>
<p>“Much of the above is predicated on best-case assumptions for the progress of a </p>
<p>conflict (swift, short and successful), the condition of Iraq post-conflict (infrastructure </p>
<p>not greatly damaged by fighting, limited internecine conflict) and the degree of </p>
<p>international buy-in with civil and military resources, including cash (considerable </p>
<p>and UN endorsed). The Secretary of State may wish to take the opportunity of this </p>
<p>meeting to remind his colleagues that there is at least a credible possibility that none </p>
<p>of these conditions will obtain.</p>
<p>“Even if there is a second (and possibly third) UNSCR this is no guarantee of </p>
<p>broad-based international buy-in into Phase IV … [T]here is a real possibility of </p>
<p>the UK (along with the US and a few forward leaning smaller military nations) </p>
<p>being committed to Phase IV engagement without international burden sharing </p>
<p>and without an immediate exit strategy. At its worst this could expose the UK to </p>
<p>an enduring large scale military commitment (20-30,000 in theatre) – <i>and</i> the </p>
<p>commensurate civil support required to contribute to the rebuilding of Iraq … The </p>
<p>potential consequences are severe … This is not the most likely risk, but it is one </p>
<p>that increases the further the outcome post-conflict is from a UN-mandated solution.”</p>
<p><b>539. </b> In the speaking note for Mr Hoon attached to the brief, officials highlighted </p>
<p>concerns about the tendency of discussion of the post-conflict phase, and the IPU </p>

<p>“A military presence will be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for success </p>
<p>in Iraq. <b>A large, organised and properly funded humanitarian assistance plan </b></p>
<p><b>(supported by DFID) is needed from the outset.</b>”</p>
<p><b>540. </b> Mr Nicholas Cannon, Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, </p>
<p>briefed Mr Blair that Ministers needed to make progress on three interlinked issues: </p>
<p>the humanitarian response; the UN mandate; and whether the UK should take on a </p>
<p>geographical sector in Iraq.</p>

<p>a decisive contribution to Phase III operations, without impacting on the strategic goal  </p>
<p>of an exemplary Phase IV plan”.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Lt Gen Reith recommended that the Chiefs of Staff agree that:</p>

<p><b>568. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March, which set out his reasoning in considerable </p>
<p>depth, is addressed in detail in Section 5.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>569. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s conclusions are summarised in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s advice, 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith identified three possible bases for the use of military force. He explained </p>
<p>that neither self-defence nor the use of force to avert overwhelming humanitarian </p>
<p>catastrophe applied in this case.</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith concluded that he remained “of the opinion that the safest legal course </p>
<p>would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force”,  </p>
<p>and that he had “already advised” that he did “not believe that such a resolution need  </p>
<p>be explicit in its terms” if it established that the Security Council had “concluded” that Iraq </p>
<p>had “failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441”.</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, having regard to the information on the negotiating history which  </p>
<p>I have been given and to the arguments of the US Administration which I heard in </p>
<p>Washington, I accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is </p>
<p>capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution.”</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith added that that would:</p>
<p>“… only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq </p>
<p>has failed to take the final opportunity. In other words, we would need to be able </p>
<p>to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-co-operation. Given </p>
<p>the structure of the resolution as a whole, the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA </p>
<p>[International Atomic Energy Agency] will be highly significant in this respect. In </p>
<p>the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC, you will need to consider extremely </p>
<p>carefully whether the evidence … is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion </p>
<p>that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity.”</p>
<p><b>570. </b> Lord Goldsmith stressed, in paragraph 36 of his advice, that the lawfulness of </p>
<p>military action depended on the question of proportionality as well as the existence of  </p>
<p>a legal basis:</p>
<p>“Any force used pursuant to the authorisation in resolution 678:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>must have as its objective the enforcement [of] the terms of the cease-fire </p>
<p>contained in resolution 687 [1991] and subsequent relevant resolutions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be limited to what is necessary to achieve that objective; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>must be a proportionate response to that objective, ie securing compliance </p>
<p>with Iraq’s disarmament obligations.”</p>

<p><b>571. </b> Lord Goldsmith continued:</p>
<p>“That is not to say that action may not be taken to remove Saddam Hussein from </p>
<p>power if it can be demonstrated that such action is a necessary and proportionate </p>
<p>measure to secure the disarmament of Iraq. But regime change cannot be the </p>
<p>objective of military action. This should be borne in mind in considering the list  </p>
<p>of military targets and in making public statements about any campaign.”</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Lord Goldsmith on 10 March forwarding two papers:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one on targeting considerations (addressed later in this Section); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a second, ‘Disarming Iraq’, written to underpin “the choice of military tasks  </p>
<p>in the Government’s draft campaign objectives”.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>573.  On 11 March, Ministers discussed legal issues, including holding back for  </b></p>
<p><b>a few days the response to a US request for the use of UK bases, and the viability </b></p>
<p><b>of the military plan.</b></p>
<p><b>574. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting on 11 March with Mr Prescott, Mr Hoon, Lord Goldsmith </p>

<p>188 </p>
<p>Mr Straw attended part of the meeting. Sir Andrew Turnbull, </p>

<p>Baroness Morgan (Mr Blair’s Director of Political and Government Relations), </p>
<p>Sir David Manning and Mr Rycroft were also present</p>
<p> </p>
<p>.</p>
<p><b>575. </b> Mr Blair was advised beforehand that the main purpose of the meeting was to </p>

<p>189</p>
<p> Suggested questions for Mr Blair to raise </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Did the US have a winning concept?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Did he agree with Mr Hoon that: specialist roles should be secured for the UK; </p>
<p>the UK area should be extended northwards; and options should be explored  </p>
<p>for reinforcing US forces?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What conditions should UK forces expect in Basra?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How would the US “reorganise” if UK forces were not involved?</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Mr Bowen advised Sir David Manning that the US request for the use of UK  </p>

<p><b>578. </b> Ms Cathy Adams, Legal Counsellor in the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, </p>
<p>advised Lord Goldsmith that she understood “the principal purpose of the meeting to  </p>
<p>be to discuss the ad bellum issue”.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>579. </b> An hour before the meeting took place, MOD Legal Advisers provided questions for </p>
<p>Mr Hoon to raise at the meeting, explaining:</p>
<p>“… some in the FCO – whether having read the AG [Attorney General]’s letter or not, </p>
<p>I don’t know – are beginning to believe that the legal base is already OK. It seems to </p>
<p>us – and I have discussed this with Martin Hemming [the MOD Legal Adviser] – that </p>
<p>the position is not yet so clear.”</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>580. </b> The document provided for Mr Hoon stated:</p>
<p>“Questions for the Attorney General</p>
<p>“If no 2nd resolution is adopted (for whatever reason), and the PM decides that </p>
<p>sufficient evidence exists that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity to comply </p>
<p>offered by 1441, is he satisfied that the currently proposed use of force would be </p>
<p>lawful under international law?</p>
<p>“Comment: The AG’s minute to the PM is equivocal: he says ‘a reasonable case </p>
<p>can be made’ [for the revival argument] but also says that his view is that ‘different </p>
<p>considerations apply in different circumstances’ [meaning the nature of the Security </p>
<p>Council discussions under OP12]. He ends his summary thus: ‘If we fail to achieve </p>
<p>the adoption of a second resolution we would need to consider urgently at that stage </p>
<p>the strength of our legal case in the light of circumstances at the time’.</p>
<p>“If the answer is yes to the above, can it be assumed that the Attorney will be able </p>
<p>to confirm formally at the time that CDS’s order to implement the planned operation </p>
<p>would be a lawful order (anybody subject to military law commits an offence if he </p>
<p>disobeys any lawful command).</p>
<p>“Comment: Notwithstanding the current uncertainties, when it comes to the crunch, </p>
<p>CDS will need to be assured that his orders are lawful. As the Attorney points out </p>
<p>in his letter, ‘on previous occasions when military action was taken on the basis of </p>
<p>a reasonably arguable case, the degree of public and Parliamentary scrutiny of the </p>
<p>legal issue was nothing like as great as it is today’.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>581. </b> The record of the meeting on 11 March reported that Mr Blair had started by </p>
<p>addressing the legal basis for military action.</p>
<p>193 </p>
<p>He stated that Lord Goldsmith’s “advice </p>
<p>made it clear that a reasonable case could be made” that resolution 1441 was “capable </p>
<p>of reviving” the authorisation of resolution 678 (1990), “although of course a second </p>
<p>resolution would be preferable”.</p>
<p><b>582. </b> Adm Boyce and Mr Hoon described the military plan, the proposed UK </p>
<p>involvement, possible Iraqi tactics, and responses to them. Adm Boyce was “confident </p>
<p>that the battle plan would work”. The record stated that Mr Blair asked a number of </p>
<p>questions and confirmed he was “in general content with it”.</p>
<p><b>583. </b> Mr Blair stated that “we must concentrate on averting unintended consequences </p>
<p>of military action. On targeting, we must minimise the risks to civilians.”</p>
<p><b>584. </b> Other points recorded by Mr Rycroft included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce said he “would need to put a short paragraph in his directive to </p>
<p>members of the Armed Forces”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The paragraph “should be cleared with the Attorney General”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would send the US a positive reply to its request to use Diego Garcia </p>
<p>and RAF Fairford “in a day or two, with the usual conditions attached”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce advised that “once we had given our approval, the US </p>
<p>might give very little notice before the start of the campaign”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull asked whether a legal basis for military action was required </p>
<p>for civil servants, as well as for members of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon asked whether the Attorney General’s legal advice was ever disclosed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair asked for a quick study into the precedents for that.</p>
<p><b>585. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had “said he would be happier with a clearer green light from the AG”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair had been “really irritated” when Sir Andrew Turnbull had “said he would </p>
<p>need something to put round the Civil Service that what they were engaged in </p>
<p>was legal”. Mr Blair was “clear we would do nothing that wasn’t legal”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had provided “a version of the arguments he had put to TB,  </p>
<p>on the one hand, on the other, reasonable case”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon had advised that the response to the “US request for the use of </p>
<p>Diego Garcia and [RAF] Fairford” should be that it was “not … automatic but had </p>
<p>to go round the system”. Mr Blair had said he “did not want to send a signal that </p>
<p>we would not do it”.</p>

<p>that weekend, and “some of our forces would have to be in before”.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>586. </b> Mr Hemming wrote to Mr David Brummell, the Legal Secretary to the Law Officers, </p>
<p>on 12 March stating:</p>
<p>“It is clear that legal controversy will undoubtedly surround the announcement of </p>
<p>any decision by the Government to proceed to military action in the absence of the </p>
<p>adoption of a further resolution by the UN Security Council. The CDS is naturally </p>
<p>concerned to be assured that his order to commit UK Armed Forces to the conflict </p>
<p>in such circumstances would be a lawful order by him. I have informed the CDS that </p>
<p>if the Attorney General has advised that he is satisfied that the proposed military </p>
<p>action by the UK would be in accordance with national and international law, he </p>
<p>[CDS] can properly give his order committing UK forces.</p>
<p>“In view of the rapidly developing situation, I thought that the Attorney would wish to </p>
<p>know what I have said on this question.”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>587. </b> Lord Goldsmith and Mr Brummell agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be proper for Mr Brummell to confirm to Mr Hemming that the proposed </p>
<p>military action would be in accordance with national and international law.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[It] would be necessary to prepare a statement setting out the Attorney’s view </p>
<p>of the legal position which could be deployed at Cabinet and in Parliament the </p>
<p>following week.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>588. </b> Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Hemming on 14 March to “confirm” that Lord Goldsmith </p>

<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit, as well as to Mr Bowen and Ms Juliet Wheldon, the Treasury Solicitor.</p>
<p><b>590. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the propriety and/or the legality of what we were about to do was obviously a </p>
<p>concern of mine, not least of it, since, somewhat against my better instincts, we had </p>
<p>signed up to the ICC [International Criminal Court]. I always made it perfectly clear  </p>

<p>to go into Iraq, we had to have a good legal basis for doing so, which obviously a </p>

<p>198</p>
<p><b>591. </b> Lord Boyce added:</p>
<p>“… that wasn’t new, it was something which I had told the Prime Minister that I would </p>
<p>need at the end of the day, long before March. This is back in January when we </p>
<p>started to commit our forces out there, and, as you say, I received that assurance. </p>
<p>This was an important issue, particularly because of the speculation in the press </p>
<p>about the legality or otherwise and, as far as I was concerned particularly for my </p>
<p>constituency, in other words, soldiers, sailors and airmen and their families had to be </p>
<p>told that what they were doing was legal. So it formed the first line of my Operational </p>
<p>Directive which I signed on 20 March, and it was important for me just to have a </p>
<p>one-liner, because that was what was required, as far as I was concerned, from the </p>
<p>Government Law Officer, which, as you say, I received.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>592. </b> The background to Lord Goldsmith’s response and the subsequent discussions  </p>
<p>on the legal basis for military action are addressed in Section 5.</p>
<p><b>593.  Following Mr Blair’s meeting, the MOD provided details of the military plan </b></p>
<p><b>and proposed that commanders should be given discretion to make further </b></p>
<p><b>contributions outside the agreed UK AO.</b></p>
<p><b>594. </b> Mr Watkins sent Sir David Manning an outline of the military plan for Iraq and </p>

<p><b>595. </b> Mr Watkins wrote:</p>
<p><b>“The US Concept of Operations can achieve a conventional military defeat, </b></p>
<p><b>and the use of force to secure regime change offers the best route to achieve </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s disarmament consistent with the principle of the minimum use of force </b></p>
<p><b>… Overall, the plan represents a robust basis for the committal of UK forces.</b></p>
<p><b>“We should confirm to the US our willingness – subject to decisions by </b></p>
<p><b>UK commanders at the time – to contribute specialist capabilities (NBC, </b></p>
<p><b>engineering and bridging) to facilitate their advance from the South, and to </b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>481</p>
<p>“Following further military-to-military discussions in theatre, the Defence Secretary </p>
<p>[Mr Hoon] believes that it is timely to take stock of the US plan and take decisions  </p>
<p>on the further development of the UK role within it.”</p>
<p><b>596. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that the original US plan envisaged the US 4th Infantry Division </p>
<p>seizing the Kirkuk oilfields, but that plan had been “compromised by Turkish delays”. </p>
<p>The US plan in the North therefore remained “fragile”.</p>
<p><b>597. </b> Mr Watkins advised that the commitment of specialist NBC, engineering and </p>
<p>bridging capabilities “would reinforce key gaps in US capability and facilitate a rapid US </p>
<p>advance, without detriment to the tasks required of UK forces in our Area of Operations”.</p>
<p><b>598. </b> On the expansion of the UK AO northwards, Mr Watkins explained:</p>
<p>“The US Land Component Commander has … developed a plan that would expand </p>
<p>the UK Area of Operations by up to 150km up to and beyond al-Amara [in Maysan </p>
<p>province] (but short of al-Kut [in Wasit province]) …</p>
<p>“The case for pushing a UK formation northwards will ultimately have to be judged </p>
<p>at the time. Clearly it will depend to some extent on what is happening in the </p>
<p>Basra area. It is also the case that an exemplary Phase IV operation depends on </p>
<p>a satisfactory conclusion to the conflict phase. The Defence Secretary therefore </p>
<p>judges that the senior UK operational commander (the Chief of Joint Operations </p>
<p>[Lt Gen Reith]) should be authorised to expand the Phase III Area of Operations </p>
<p>northwards if that is required to achieve a satisfactory outcome to Phase III. The </p>
<p>focus for the UK in Phase IV should, however, remain the South-Eastern Area of </p>
<p>Operations as currently understood.”</p>
<p><b>599. </b> Mr Watkins explained that, given delays in the deployment of some US forces, </p>
<p>there were certain scenarios in which the US might need the additional combat power </p>
<p>that the UK land component could provide:</p>
<p>“In circumstances where the situation in the UK’s existing Area of Operations was </p>
<p>benign, and where Iraqi forces had generally collapsed, it might be possible for  </p>
<p>1 (UK) Division to provide forces to contribute to decisive US action in addition to </p>
<p>the specialist contributions and the northward expansion described above. The </p>
<p>Defence Secretary believes that the Chief of Joint Operations should be authorised </p>
<p>to participate in planning discussions with the US without commitment, and on the </p>
<p>understanding that any decision to commit UK forces to reinforce the US in decisive </p>
<p>action would be a matter for Ministers.”</p>
<p><b>600. </b> Mr Watkins explained that, on that basis, Mr Hoon judged:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “first priority” should be for the UK to confirm its willingness to contribute </p>
<p>specialist capabilities to facilitate the US advance from the South.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Second, “provided that UK commanders judge[d] this sensible in the </p>
<p>circumstances at the time”, the UK should be “forward-leaning” on the  </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>idea of extending the UK Area of Operations north during the conflict phase.  </p>
<p>If that was required to achieve a satisfactory conclusion to Phase III, on which </p>
<p>“an exemplary Phase IV depends”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Third, the UK “should be prepared to continue exploring options for reinforcing </p>
<p>US forces at decisive points … but without commitment at this stage”.</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Hoon spoke to Secretary Rumsfeld that evening, setting out the risks to starting </p>
<p>operations at the time of a full moon and the political implications of not giving the </p>
<p>second resolution sufficient time to secure votes (see Section 3.8).</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>602. </b> The MOD reported that Secretary Rumsfeld had said Gen Franks was looking at </p>
<p>how to “work around” a position in which the UK could not participate in military action </p>
<p>but which assumed that the UK would be available for post-conflict activities. Mr Hoon </p>
<p>had responded that the UK would not want to be in that position and restated the case </p>
<p>for waiting a few more days.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> In a subsequent press briefing, Secretary Rumsfeld said that it was unclear what </p>
<p>the UK role would be in the event that a decision was made to use force: “until we know </p>
<p>what the resolution is, we won’t know the answer to what their role will be”.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>604. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld subsequently clarified his comments, saying that he had “no </p>
<p>doubt of the full support of the United Kingdom for the international community’s efforts </p>
<p>to disarm Iraq”.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> Obtaining a second resolution was important to the UK and the US </p>
<p>was “working to achieve that”. He added:</p>
<p>“In the event that a decision to use force is made, we have every reason to believe </p>
<p>that there will be a significant military contribution from the United Kingdom.”</p>
<p><b>605. </b> In his memoir, Mr Blair wrote that Secretary Rumsfeld had been “trying to be </p>
<p>helpful”, but it had not helped and “by then the military were absolutely determined, </p>
<p>rightly, that they would be part of the action from the outset, and took amiss any sense </p>
<p>that we might be in the second rank”.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>606. </b> In the entry for 11 March in the edition of his diaries published in 2012, </p>
<p>Mr Campbell wrote that the incident was “indicative of the difficulties” of working with the </p>
<p>US.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> Secretary Rumsfeld’s clarification was the result of a further telephone call from </p>
<p>Mr Hoon “making it clear that we were with them”.</p>

<p>206</p>
<p> He reported that, following </p>
<p>his visits to Op TELIC theatre, and discussions with commanders, units were ready and </p>
<p>people would be deployed by 19 March.</p>
<p><b>608. </b> Gen Myers indicated that he had told Gen Franks to work the “no UK option”.</p>
<p><b>609. </b> The minutes from the Chiefs of Staff meeting on 12 March stated that Secretary </p>

<p>“without the UK at her side”.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> The political decision to commit UK forces to Phases III </p>
<p>and IV had “not yet been made, though planning continued as directed by HMG”.</p>
<p><b>610. </b> In response to the request for a statement on the basis for his assurance to </p>
<p>Mr Blair that the US plan for the invasion represented a “winning concept”, Lord Boyce </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“The threat was carefully assessed, including taking into account the possible </p>
<p>deployment of CW/BW weapons by Saddam, and measured against the capability </p>
<p>of the Coalition Forces. There was complete confidence from CENTCOM and </p>
<p>ourselves that Iraqi forces could be defeated.”</p>

<p><b>611. </b> Lord Boyce’s statement in respect of Phase IV is addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Asked whether Ministers had a clear sense of how important the UK contribution </p>
<p>had become to the campaign plan, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry: “I think so …”</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Lord Boyce added that his personal view was that the US could not have begun </p>
<p>the military campaign without the UK contribution: Secretary Rumsfeld’s comments that </p>
<p>the US could manage on its own were right, but the US would not have managed on  </p>
<p>its own on 19 March.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>614. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… as far as the fighting phase is concerned we were satisfied we were there. As far </p>
<p>as the aftermath planning was concerned, we thought we had something which was </p>

<p>Paper DIS, 11 March 2003, ‘Basra: Post Saddam Governance’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>484</p>
<p><b>616. </b> The Memorandum included an assessment of the likely reaction in the first 72 </p>
<p>hours after a Coalition attack. The DIS stated that, while judging the overall attitudes  </p>
<p>of the populace to the regime was “fraught with difficulty”, “there seems little doubt that </p>
<p>the vast majority of Basra’s inhabitants are opposed to the regime and would welcome </p>
<p>its removal”.</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Reflecting on the lessons of the 1991 uprising and that, in 2003, the </p>
<p>“circumstances might be very different”, the DIS identified “several noteworthy </p>
<p>characteristics”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Total collapse of the Security forces and civil administration</b>: Though there </p>
<p>was some fierce fighting … security forces within the city … quickly collapsed </p>
<p>… Within days (even hours) Basra became an administrative and governmental </p>
<p>vacuum.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Lack of political or popular leadership</b>: … With no real religious leadership </p>
<p>within Basra City and with the majority of rural tribal leaders unwilling to lend </p>
<p>support to the urban uprising there was … no one to curb the worst excesses  </p>
<p>of the populace.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Popular targeting of regime installations</b>: … typically ransacked and burnt  </p>
<p>to the ground.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Reprisals against regime associated personnel</b>: … Much anecdotal </p>
<p>reporting and academic accounts identify Basra (along with Karbala) as the </p>
<p>site of the worst excesses of the uprising, with summary executions and </p>
<p>indiscriminate massacres of security personnel.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>General collapse of law and order</b>: … the insurrection in Basra soon </p>
<p>descended into general anarchy, with looting a major feature … [W]anton </p>
<p>destruction of public buildings and even the pillaging of museums occurred  </p>
<p>in Basra.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Entry of Iranian backed Iraqi groups</b>: It seems apparent that Iranian backed </p>
<p>Shia groups (including forces linked to the Supreme Council for the Islamic </p>
<p>Revolution in Iraq, SCIRI) entered the environs of Basra on the second or third </p>
<p>day of the uprising … they also pursued an Islamic revolutionary agenda – </p>
<p>destroying examples of ‘unislamic’ practice …”</p>
<p><b>618. </b> Addressing the likely reaction of the civil populace in 2003, the DIS stated that it </p>
<p>had “no definitive intelligence” but there were “a number of scenarios that might occur”, </p>
<p>possibly simultaneously in the city. Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Spontaneous civil uprising</b>: … either before or during Coalition engagement </p>
<p>with Iraqi forces in Basra governorate is unlikely … [R]ecollections of 1991 … </p>
<p>are likely to lead to an extremely cautious reaction …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Reprisals</b>: … only high ranking regime personnel and those associated with </p>
<p>particularly repressive behaviour would be targeted …”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>485</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Resistance activity</b>: … Both SCIRI … and the Dawa Party would appear </p>
<p>to have well-established urban support networks … and have over the years </p>
<p>committed numerous acts of sabotage and assassination … Equally we assume </p>
<p>that urban support structures for the rural based Shia opposition … may well </p>
<p>exist. The Iraqi Communist Party might also retain an underground presence. </p>
<p>We have little idea of the size or capability of such groups but many resistance </p>
<p>networks might try to seize controls of local neighbourhoods within the southern </p>
<p>cities … once the regime has collapsed … Many of these groups have access </p>
<p>to considerable weaponry including small arms and RPGs [Rocket Propelled </p>
<p>Grenades].”</p>
<p><b>619. </b> The DIS stated that some of the groups “may pursue an agenda inimical to </p>
<p>Coalition interests … and might resent Coalition presence”; and that criminals and </p>
<p>opportunists “looking to exploit the situation would supplement resistance groups </p>
<p>pursuing an ‘anti-Saddam’ agenda”.</p>
<p><b>620. </b> The DIS also warned that:</p>
<p>“The continued activity of armed groups will set a dangerous precedent for Basra’s </p>
<p>future political landscape. We must expect political groupings with a religious </p>
<p>(Shia) agenda and Iranian backing to emerge very quickly within Basra (and across </p>
<p>southern Iraq) … [I]t would be highly destabilising for such groups to base their </p>
<p>political influence on their control of armed elements. The armed wings of such </p>
<p>groups will need to be disarmed or disbanded.”</p>
<p><b>621. </b> The DIS also warned that it expected the civil police “at least initially” to “disappear </p>
<p>from view”, and that many of the population were “fearful of a generalised breakdown  </p>
<p>in law and order”. Disarming the populace “might be interpreted as running contrary  </p>
<p>to cultural norms and could be resisted”.</p>
<p><b>622. </b> The DIS had “no intelligence on regime planning to mount an urban defence </p>
<p>of Basra City” but stated that “individual or localised resistance could occur”. It also </p>
<p>identified the forces which were likely to be at the disposal of the regime. Those are  </p>
<p>set out in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>623. </b> The DIS advice on reactions to subsequent Coalition control of Basra, including  </p>
<p>the assessment that UK forces would be “required in the city to provide security”,  </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>624. </b> General Franks wrote in his memoir that:</p>
<p>“Intel[ligence] estimated that the vast majority of Basra’s population of almost one </p>
<p>million Shiites would remain neutral, neither helping nor hindering, while the British </p>
<p>dealt with the Ba’athist leadership of the garrison.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>486</p>
<p><b>JIC Note, 13 March 2003: ‘Saddam’s Plan for Baghdad’</b></p>
<p><b>625. </b> In its meeting on 12 March, the JIC discussed a letter on the defence of Baghdad </p>
<p>circulated to members by Mr Julian Miller, Chief of the Assessments Staff, on 6 March.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p><b>626. </b> In addition to the points already covered, the JIC concluded that the paper </p>
<p>“should also say something about the possibility of CB use”.</p>
<p><b>627. </b> A JIC Note issued on 13 March set out the JIC’s understanding of Iraqi military </p>
<p>preparations in Baghdad, and an initial view of their potential effectiveness.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It judged that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi regime expected the Regular Army only to delay any Coalition attack </p>
<p>en-route to Baghdad. It wanted to “drag out fighting and play for time, hoping </p>
<p>that international pressure will force the Coalition to halt its attack and come to  </p>
<p>a negotiated settlement, leaving Saddam in power”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Much of the Republican Guard (RG), including Iraq’s best-equipped military </p>
<p>units, was based around Baghdad. That was roughly 35,000 of the RG’s 75,000 </p>
<p>troops, with 600 of Iraq’s best tanks and 900 other armoured vehicles. Defensive </p>
<p>positions had been prepared 15-25 km to the west and south of the city. “Less </p>
<p>significant preparations” had been made to the north and the east. Those </p>
<p>defences had “clear vulnerabilities” and were “not sufficient to stop a Coalition </p>
<p>assault”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi security and militia organisations, backed by RG special forces brigades, </p>
<p>were responsible for the inner city. Together they “could muster at least 10,000 </p>
<p>men in Baghdad, possibly many more”. There was “no evidence of a systematic </p>
<p>fortification of the city for use by large-scale conventional ground forces” but </p>
<p>surviving RG forces could retreat into Baghdad and “quickly prepare ad-hoc </p>
<p>fall-back positions. Even a few thousand lightly armed troops could require </p>
<p>disproportionate time and resources to overcome, with significant risk of </p>
<p>Coalition and civilian casualties.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s plans for Baghdad depended on the “morale and cohesion of its forces, </p>
<p>including the ability of the authorities to continue exercising effective command </p>
<p>and control”. Intelligence “strongly” suggested that morale was already low.</p>
<p><b>628. </b> The JIC did not know whether Saddam Hussein would remain in Baghdad. </p>
<p>Baghdad was the best defended area and the best place for him to influence events. </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was “very security-conscious”. Until there was “intense fighting” </p>
<p>in Baghdad, the JIC assessed that Saddam Hussein would be able to move around </p>
<p>Baghdad without detection.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>487</p>
<p><b>629. </b> The JIC stated that it had “previously judged that Saddam would be willing to use </p>
<p>chemical and biological warfare (CBW) against the Coalition and the Iraqi population”.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p><b>630. </b> The JIC assessed that it was “likely that, even if it had not done so already, the </p>
<p>regime would use CBW in the defence of Baghdad if it could”. That “would depend on </p>
<p>the survival of leadership command and control, and of some delivery means, such as </p>
<p>artillery”. Intelligence indicated that the Special Republican Guard and Special Security </p>
<p>Organisation retained “control over CBW munitions” and that the regime had “been </p>
<p>distributing protective CBW clothing and medical supplies for treating exposure to nerve </p>
<p>agents to units around Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>Two additional UK units deployed</b></p>
<p>On 10 March, Mr Hoon was asked to agree two additional UK deployments:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1st Battalion The Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, to guard Prisoners of War as </p>
<p>a consequence of the plan for UK units to provide “reliefs-in-place of US ground </p>
<p>forces”;</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>202 Field Hospital (Volunteer), to increase the number of field hospitals from two to </p>
<p>three in response to concerns that the medical capability could be “overwhelmed </p>
<p>early in the course of operations”.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>Mr Hoon announced both deployments on 13 March, stating that they would provide </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div with “further flexibility to respond to a range of possible tasks and </p>
<p>circumstances”.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p><b>631.  Mr Blair agreed the military plan on 13 March.</b></p>
<p><b>632. </b> Mr Blair held a further meeting to discuss the military plan and timetable with </p>
<p>Mr Prescott, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce on 13 March.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> That discussed the </p>
<p>timing of the start of the military campaign and formal approval of the military plan set </p>
<p>out in Mr Watkins’ letter of 11 March.</p>
<p><b>633. </b> There was “a discussion about the timing of the end of the UN process … and the </p>
<p>start of military action”. It was agreed that Mr Blair would pursue the timing issues with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>488</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Adm Boyce advised that:</p>
<p>“… the full moon meant that a later start date […] would certainly be preferable, </p>
<p>but that the projected date was not a show stopper. The US military shared the </p>
<p>preference for a later date, but had been told to accept the earlier date.”</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Sir David Manning confirmed Mr Blair’s approval for the plan in a letter to </p>
<p>Mr Watkins the following day.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>636. </b> On 17 March, Mr Watkins replied to a separate letter from Sir David Manning of </p>
<p>14 March, asking whether the MOD was confident that the military planning took full </p>
<p>account of the risks and problems identified in the JIC Assessment of Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>plans to defend Baghdad.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that it “largely confirms the analysis” in the MOD advice of </p>
<p>28 February. In particular, it underlined the Iraqi regime’s “dilemma” about whether to </p>
<p>withdraw the RG’s heavy armour into Baghdad. The US intention was to make it difficult </p>
<p>for heavy units to reinforce the light forces providing the inner-city defence. The Special </p>
<p>Republican Guard was not trained to mount a guerrilla campaign.</p>
<p><b>638. </b> Mr Watkins also wrote that:</p>
<p>“The setting alight of oil-filled trenches has the potential to cause some delay. </p>
<p>As with Iraqi use of CBW, there is not much – apart from information operations –  </p>
<p>we can do to stop the Iraqis doing it. But their effect on Coalition Forces is likely </p>
<p>to be limited … As the JIC paper notes, this tactic may be a two-edged sword … </p>
<p>because it is unlikely to encourage loyalty amongst the local population … But we </p>
<p>must be willing to recognise that the regime is likely to be willing to inflict extreme </p>
<p>suffering on its own population and seek to blame the Coalition.</p>
<p>“A key variable is the extent to which the regime’s orders will be obeyed and the </p>
<p>impact of the early campaign on Iraqi forces’ will to fight. If necessary, General </p>
<p>Franks is prepared to mount an air assault to create an enclave within the city from </p>
<p>which operations could be mounted to combat resisting forces. As we noted on </p>
<p>28 February, in the worst case this could be a messy and protracted process.”</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Sir David Manning commented: “I take it that this amounts to a statement that </p>
<p>MOD have taken account of the factors/risks identified in the JIC paper.”</p>

<p>489</p>
<p><b>640. </b> ACM Burridge told the Inquiry that the “Republican Guard had been planned </p>
<p>to form a ring around Baghdad”. Saddam Hussein could also use weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and:</p>
<p>“… irregular warfare … to try and draw us into urban warfare.</p>
<p>“He had developed the view … that western militaries don’t do urban warfare. </p>
<p>He had also developed the view that large numbers of civilian casualties – he had  </p>
<p>a Grozny [Chechnya] vision in mind [unfinished sentence]</p>
<p>“The idea that the world’s media would show this terrible destruction which, in his </p>
<p>rather warped perception, would put him on the moral high ground …</p>
<p>“What we didn’t know was to what extent he would front load those southern cities, </p>
<p>Basra in particular, and we subsequently recognised he put small elements of the </p>
<p>Republican Guard in amongst the Ba’ath militia the Al Quds and people such as </p>
<p>that, to … make them militarily more effective and … to put the frighteners on the </p>
<p>51 Division people who had effectively melted away, and they were coerced into </p>
<p>getting back into their equipment.”</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>641. </b> ACM Burridge also told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Be under no illusion we believed that he did have tactical battlefield weapons with </p>
<p>chemical or biological tips. He had used them previously …</p>
<p>“So – but what we did know was that this wasn’t the same as fighting through the </p>
<p>central front in Warsaw Pact days when the entire battle space would be drenched </p>
<p>in chemical agents. This was relatively limited. This was the sort of capability that </p>
<p>normally you would choose to manoeuvre around, rather than have to consider  </p>
<p>a complete change of tactic …</p>
<p>“So – and we were happy with the level of individual protection, and I take from </p>
<p>that not only suits, and it is well recorded that had some of the suits were out </p>
<p>of their perceived shelf life. They had to be tested and extended, and the same </p>
<p>with canisters, inoculation programmes and the taking of NAPS [nerve agent </p>
<p>pre-treatment] tablets. So we were clear what we were up against, and we were </p>
<p>contented that we could deal with that element of risk.”</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>Cabinet, 17 March 2003</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>490</p>
<p><b>643. </b> Mr Blair told his colleagues that he had called the Cabinet because “an impasse” </p>
<p>had been reached at the United Nations.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>644. </b> The Government had tried its “utmost”, and had “tabled a draft … resolution, </p>
<p>amended it, and then been prepared to apply tests against which Iraq’s co-operation </p>
<p>… could be judged”. Although the UK had been “gathering increasing support from </p>
<p>members of the Security Council”, the French statement “that they would veto a </p>
<p>resolution in all circumstances had made it impossible to achieve a new … resolution”. </p>
<p>France, with Russia in support, “were not prepared to accept” that if Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>“did not comply with the United Nations obligations, military action should follow”. The </p>
<p>UK was in a situation it had “striven to avoid”: “There would be no second resolution and </p>
<p>military action was likely to be necessary … to enforce compliance by Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>with Iraq’s obligations.”</p>
<p><b>645. </b> The points made during discussion included that, in conducting military operations, </p>
<p>it would be important to show “we wished to protect civilians, seek the surrender of Iraqi </p>
<p>conscripts, and protect religious and cultural sites”.</p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“… the diplomatic process was now at an end. Saddam Hussein would be given  </p>
<p>an ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the House of Commons would be asked to endorse </p>
<p>the use of military action against Iraq to enforce compliance, if necessary.”</p>
<p><b>647. </b> The Cabinet: “Took note.”</p>
<p><b>648. </b> The discussion in Cabinet is addressed in Section 3.8.</p>
<p><b>The ultimatum to Saddam Hussein</b></p>
<p><b>649. </b> In an “Address to the Nation” at 8pm Eastern Standard Time on 17 March, </p>
<p>President Bush stated that “the final days of decision” had been reached and issued  </p>
<p>an ultimatum giving Saddam Hussein and his sons 48 hours to leave Iraq.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>650. </b> In a message to Iraqis, President Bush stated:</p>
<p>“If we must begin a military campaign, it will be directed against the lawless men </p>
<p>who rule your country and not against you … The day of your liberation is near.</p>
<p>“… It is not too late for the Iraqi military to act with honor and protect your country </p>
<p>by permitting the peaceful entry of Coalition Forces to eliminate weapons of mass </p>

<p>The Beginning of the End’, “tried to answer some difficult questions about Saddam’s </p>

<p>predictions remained difficult”. Saddam was “likely to go out fighting”. The JIC also </p>
<p>asked that the Note be reordered “to include judgements on Iraq’s CBW intentions, </p>
<p>possibly against a Shia uprising; Saddam’s intentions in each of the three main </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>494</p>
<p><b>674. </b> The JIC judged:</p>
<p>“There are indications that regime cohesion is under increasing pressure, but no </p>
<p>sign that it will collapse before military action begins. Reporting suggests desertion </p>
<p>rates are rising in the Republican Guard (RG), up to some 20 percent. One report </p>
<p>also indicates that members of the RG are waiting for an attack to begin before </p>
<p>escaping. Media reporting shows small numbers of Iraqi soldiers already offering to </p>
<p>surrender. The regime proved able, however, to restore stability rapidly after limited </p>
<p>anti-regime protests in mid-March.”</p>
<p><b>675. </b> The JIC assessed that Saddam Hussein was focusing on the defence of Baghdad:</p>
<p>“Imagery indicates elements of the Special Republican Guard (SRG) have been </p>
<p>deployed near to Saddam International airport and SRG security units have been </p>
<p>dispersed in central Baghdad. One report indicated SRG had also been deployed </p>
<p>in the northern outskirts of Baghdad in the direction of Tikrit. Imagery indicates </p>
<p>Republican Guard units deploying to the South, West and East 30km outside the </p>
<p>capital, apparently to concealment sites for protection against air strikes.”</p>
<p><b>676. </b> The JIC judged that Iraq had “a useable CBW capability, deliverable using artillery, </p>
<p>missiles and possibly unmanned aerial vehicles”. While a report in mid-March had </p>
<p>indicated that Iraq’s chemical weapons had not been assembled, there was intelligence </p>
<p>to suggest that Iraq planned to use them. Reporting also suggested that Iraq could try  </p>
<p>to blame civilian deaths resulting from CBW use on the Coalition.</p>
<p><b>677. </b> The JIC added that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Intelligence on the timing of CBW use is inconsistent […].”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence on the deployment of CBW was “sparse”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Uncorroborated reporting” suggested the “delivery of CW shells to Republican </p>
<p>Guard units … south of Baghdad”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no evidence” that ballistic missiles destroyed by Coalition air action </p>
<p>in February “were equipped with CBW warheads”, but the JIC could not be sure </p>
<p>that it “would receive indications prior to an attack”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein retained “ultimate control of CBW use”, but there were </p>
<p>suggestions that he had “contingency plans to devolve military decision </p>
<p>making, including CBW, to regional commands, if communications are cut with </p>
<p>Baghdad”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “might take this decision early, once the severity of the initial </p>
<p>attack becomes clear or in the face of Kurdish or Shia uprisings”, although the </p>
<p>possibility of Saddam offering concessions to remain in power “would argue </p>
<p>against pre-emptive attacks and devolving control”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>An “early strategic U-turn, once Saddam realises the intensity of the attack … </p>
<p>and the risk of losing control of his CBW capability” could not be ruled out, and </p>
<p>he might “then order early CBW attacks”.</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>495</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued to judge that “in the face of death and the destruction of his </p>
<p>regime”, Saddam would “try to wreak as much havoc as possible”, but his ability </p>
<p>to do so could be limited.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “further risk … that CBW could become available to extremist </p>
<p>groups either as a last vindictive act by Saddam, or through the loss of control  </p>
<p>in the final days of his regime”.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> In his account of the campaign, Gen Franks wrote on 20 March:</p>
<p>“For the past two days we had been receiving increasingly urgent Intelligence </p>
<p>reporting that Republican Guard units in Baghdad had moved south to the </p>
<p>city of al-Kut – and that they had been issued mustard gas and an unknown </p>
<p>nerve agent.”</p>

<p><b>679.  Most of the issues raised at Mr Blair’s meeting on 6 March, including </b></p>
<p><b>sectorisation, remained unresolved as the invasion began.</b></p>
<p><b>680.  On 19 March, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon informed Mr Blair that:</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>the UK would not be expected to contribute resources to anything other </b></p>

<p>496</p>
<p><b>685. </b> The draft was subject to “intensive consultations at official level in the MOD </p>
<p>and FCO”.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>686. </b> In the FCO, Mr Ricketts sent the draft to Mr Straw’s Private Office with the </p>
<p>comment:</p>
<p>“This is a clear note on a crucial issue. If the Secretary of State [Mr Straw] could  </p>
<p>OK it (I showed him a slightly earlier draft this morning) it can go to No.10 tonight,  </p>
<p>for discussion at the PM’s meeting at 0830 on 20 March.”</p>

<p><b>687. </b> In the MOD, the draft was cleared by Adm Boyce and Sir Kevin Tebbit.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Sir Kevin commented:</p>
<p>“In terms of our military capacity, with an eye to the aftermath, it would clearly be </p>
<p>preferable to confine ourselves to SE Iraq and not bite off more than we can chew. </p>
<p>I accept, however, that we should be prepared, initially, for our forces to be fairly </p>
<p>widely dispersed across Iraq, depending on how Phase III goes, because without </p>
<p>successful Phase III, Phase IV becomes harder, if not academic. The trick will be  </p>
<p>to be able to regroup in a smaller area of SE Iraq once hostilities are ended.</p>
<p>“I also agree that we should be clear about our medium/long term scale of military </p>
<p>commitment. While we are putting all we can into the war effort, we should plan </p>
<p>ahead to stay broadly within … [Strategic Defence Review guidelines].</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>“What concerns me most is the process of transiting from a primarily military effort </p>
<p>to the civil-led longer term humanitarian and reconstruction phase. Recent history </p>
<p>does not offer too much encouragement and we shall have to work hard to avoid </p>
<p>‘dependence culture’ on the Armed Forces to do things which should be for civil </p>
<p>departments – initially through aid, subsequently through Iraqi own efforts. The </p>
<p>politics of the issue do, I believe, point in the same direction. To meet the PM’s wish </p>
<p>for us to play an exemplary role, we shall need to remember that memories of the </p>
<p>UK in the region from the 1920s are not all positive, and we should make clear our </p>
<p>desire to hand over and withdraw on the right basis as early as we can.”</p>

<p>497</p>
<p><b>689. </b> In their joint minute, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon warned that some issues “could </p>
<p>confront us as early as next week” and invited agreement to five propositions:</p>
<p>“(a)  The maximum size of task that UK forces would contribute to in the early days </p>
<p>should not exceed our overall military capability. A focus in the South-East of </p>
<p>Iraq would be reasonable.</p>
<p>(b)  The UK contribution to such a task in advance of a Security Council resolution </p>
<p>would be limited to the facilitation of humanitarian assistance and a secure </p>
<p>environment and the elimination of WMD.</p>
<p>(c)  We therefore need to agree urgently with the US a realistic authorising Security </p>
<p>Council resolution for post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>(d)  We should agree urgently a plan with the US to help us find military partners  </p>
<p>to enable us to draw down and, in due course, design an exit strategy.</p>
<p>(e)  In broad terms the MOD will need to draw down its scale of effort to nearer  </p>
<p>a third of its commitment by the autumn.”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon gave little detail of what UK forces would be required to do </p>
<p>immediately after the invasion:</p>
<p>“Much will depend on how the campaign develops, but in the first few weeks we </p>
<p>should expect Coalition Forces to be spread across Iraq. The expectation is that UK </p>
<p>forces will end up in southern Iraq, loosely centred on Basra. However, we should be </p>
<p>prepared for elements of our forces to be dispersed fairly widely across Iraq …</p>
<p>“US military planning continues to be fluid. But it envisages Coalition Forces re-</p>
<p>deploying into a more tailored security framework as soon as the situation permits. </p>
<p>The military task will be to facilitate a secure environment (including law and order, </p>
<p>deterring adventurism and a variety of military-technical tasks) to enable immediate </p>
<p>humanitarian relief to be conducted …</p>
<p>“The expectation is that UK forces would be responsible for a task focused on  </p>
<p>Basra and other key military objectives in the South-East of Iraq, which could include </p>
<p>20 percent of the Iraqi population. This task is broadly proportionate to the size  </p>
<p>of the UK’s contribution to overall Coalition land forces …</p>
<p>“In parallel, and under the overall military command, the US plan to bring in a </p>
<p>transitional administration</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> to co-ordinate immediate civil relief and humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance. The transitional administration is making plans for allocating its limited </p>
<p>resources, including provision of public sector salaries, on a nation wide, Coalition </p>
<p>basis. There is no expectation that the UK would be asked to contribute any </p>

<p>Minute Straw and Hoon to Prime Minister, 19 March 2003, ‘Iraq: UK Military Contribution to </p>
<p>Post-Conflict Iraq’.</p>
<p>251 </p>
<p>A footnote explained: “The Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) becomes  </p>
<p>the transitional administration once it is established inside Iraq.” ORHA’s role is described in more detail  </p>
<p>in Section 6.5.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>resources to anything other than security. So there is no suggestion that the UK </p>
<p>would be left to foot the bill for the civil administration or the costs of humanitarian </p>
<p>relief and reconstruction in any area.”</p>
<p><b>691. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon reported that US planning remained “sensibly flexible” once </p>
<p>the initial phase was over and “a major part of Iraq has been stabilised”. They advised </p>
<p>that US planning:</p>
<p>“… recognises that parts of Iraq will be more permissive than others and that </p>
<p>security could well be provided through something other than sectors. It would </p>
<p>be premature now to take a view on the merits of sectors for this stage. We are </p>
<p>well placed to influence US thinking with a number of military officers and officials </p>
<p>embedded within their military headquarters and in ITCA [International Transitional </p>
<p>Civil Authority]. <b>It would be helpful for them, and for military planners generally, </b></p>
<p><b>to agree what our scale of effort should be in our medium-term contribution  </b></p>
<p><b>to Iraq.”</b></p>
<p><b>692. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon advised that it would be necessary to reduce the UK </p>
<p>military contribution “to nearer a third by no later than the autumn in order to avoid </p>
<p>long-term damage to the Armed Forces” and to remain within current Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions: “If Ministers wanted us to, we would need decisions now so that we would </p>
<p>be able to recommend what would have to give elsewhere.” Scaling down to nearer a </p>
<p>third would limit the UK contribution thereafter to “a maximum of around one brigade, a </p>
<p>two-star headquarters and possibly a contribution to higher level command and control”. </p>
<p>They recommended telling the US now, for planning purposes, that this was the upper </p>
<p>limit of the UK contribution.</p>
<p><b>693. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon also recorded that the ARRC [Allied Rapid Reaction </p>
<p>Corps] featured in current CENTCOM planning as a multi-national headquarters that </p>
<p>could play a role in post-conflict Iraq, but would be the subject of a separate paper </p>
<p>(see Section 9.1).</p>
<p><b>694. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon ended with a section on “<b>Setting the conditions for </b></p>
<p><b>success</b>”. The conditions in which UK forces operated needed to be conducive to </p>
<p>success. There needed to be a resolution authorising international activity in the </p>
<p>post- conflict period; and:</p>
<p>“We should also let the US know the key importance of internationalising the security </p>
<p>arrangements now so that we can reduce our commitment as set out above. And </p>
<p>we would expect US support in building a wider Coalition to operate alongside our </p>
<p>forces, allow us to draw down and eventually to provide us with an exit strategy.”</p>
<p><b>695. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon concluded:</p>
<p>“We should be realistic about the limited prospects of our finding any genuine </p>
<p>military capability to help us take this task on. New … Coalition partners are thin  </p>

<p>on the ground and, if the post-conflict phase does not go well, there will not be many </p>
<p>nations who will be prepared or able to take part.</p>
<p>“And finally, we shall need to return to this issue once we are clear how the </p>
<p>campaign is developing and look at our wider contribution in the round.”</p>
<p><b>696.  The Cabinet Office took a different position on whether it would be </b></p>
<p><b>“premature” to take a view on the merits of sectors.</b></p>
<p><b>697. </b> Before the joint minute from Mr Straw and Mr Hoon reached No.10, Mr Drummond </p>
<p>advised Mr Rycroft that “we need Ministers to decide on sectors”. The joint minute and </p>
<p>sectors should be on the agenda for the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq (the “War Cabinet”) on </p>
<p>20 March.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>698. </b> Mr Drummond suggested that Ministers would want to agree the proposals in the </p>
<p>joint minute:</p>
<p>“… provided they are satisfied that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK Forces will be capable of providing security for an area around Basra </p>
<p>including about 20 percent of Iraq’s population.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How long will we have this responsibility, and what is the exit strategy </p>
<p>(benign security environment created, UK forces replaced by others). Will </p>
<p>we be able to limit ‘our area’ to say Basra by the autumn, when we want to </p>
<p>withdraw two-thirds of our troops?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the assertion that the transitional administration will handle civil </p>
<p>administration including humanitarian reconstruction issues is correct: </p>
<p>This is clearly the plan, but it must be doubtful that ORHA [the Office of </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance] will have the capacity, and </p>
<p>therefore the troops on the ground may be called on to help. The UK certainly </p>
<p>doesn’t have civilian capacity to help govern 20 percent of Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>699. </b> The invasion of Iraq began overnight on 19/20 March 2003. Military operations </p>

<p><b>(IHL) was disseminated to those engaged at all levels in military action through  </b></p>
<p><b>a number of different mechanisms.</b></p>
<p><b>705. </b> The CDS Directive to CJO on 18 March 2003, the ‘Execute Directive to the Joint </p>
<p>Commander for Operation TELIC’, set out: the situation and legal basis for operations; </p>
<p>the UK Government’s political, strategic and military objectives; the concept of </p>
<p>operations and detailed instructions for the mission.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> It included a paragraph to </p>
<p>the effect that all military operations, by UK forces and from UK territory, were to be </p>
<p>conducted in accordance with the UK’s Obligations under the Law of Armed Conflict </p>
<p>(otherwise known as IHL) and UK national law.</p>
<p><b>706. </b> The principles of IHL are set out in the Box earlier in this Section, ‘Overview of </p>
<p>international humanitarian law’.</p>
<p><b>707. </b> The CDS Directive also contained a number of annexes, including a Targeting </p>
<p>Directive and a draft Rules of Engagement (ROE) profile, although at the time of issue </p>
<p>that had not yet been authorised by Ministers.</p>
<p><b>708. </b> ROE are explained in the Box below.</p>

<p><b>Rules of Engagement</b></p>
<p>Rules of Engagement (ROE) are defined by the MOD as “directions for operational </p>
<p>commands that set out the circumstances and limitations under which armed force may be </p>
<p>applied by UK forces to achieve military objectives for the furtherance of UK government </p>
<p>policy”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> They are the means by which Ministers provide political direction and guidance </p>
<p>to commanders on the application of force, within identified legal constraints, and they </p>
<p>have specific Ministerial authority.</p>
<p>The ROE Compendium, Joint Service Publication 398, is divided into 21 “Rules”, each of </p>
<p>which addresses a different type of action (and each has a number of options ranging from </p>
<p>prohibition, through qualified permissions, to unrestricted use of the capability).</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>Compendium thus offers a menu of options from which a “ROE profile” can be selected </p>
<p>(and, if necessary, amended) and authorised by Ministers for each operation.</p>
<p>An ROE profile is issued “as a set of parameters to inform commanders of the limits of </p>
<p>constraint imposed or of freedom permitted when carrying out their assigned tasks …  </p>
<p>In passing orders, subordinate commanders at any level must always act within the ROE </p>
<p>received but they are not bound to use the full extent of the permissions granted.”  </p>
<p>The profile is also disseminated as appropriate to subordinate commanders.</p>
<p>The ROE profile for Operation TELIC, issued to the Joint Commander on 18 March 2003, </p>
<p>rehearsed the legal basis relied upon by the UK in taking military action against Iraq and </p>
<p>approved by the Attorney General.</p>
<p>256</p>
<p> It stated that Iraq “has failed to comply with the </p>
<p>terms of Resolution 1441” and was “in further material breach of its obligations”. The UK </p>
<p>Government had concluded that military action was necessary to enforce Iraqi compliance </p>
<p>with UNSCRs 678, 687 and 1441, and it was “therefore necessary” to remove the current </p>
<p>regime from power “in order to create the conditions in which Iraq could be disarmed in </p>
<p>accordance with its obligations”.</p>
<p>All military operations were “to be limited to what is necessary to create those conditions”; </p>
<p>and all military action was to be carried out in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict, </p>
<p>“which requires that at all stages the principles of distinction, proportionality, and military </p>
<p>necessity are to be applied to the use of minimum force”.</p>
<p><b>709. </b> ROE for sites of religious or cultural significance are addressed later in this </p>

<p><b>710. </b> The content of the CDS Directive was further disseminated through Directives from </p>
<p>the CJO to the National Contingent Commander (NCC) and to the three UK Contingent </p>
<p>Commanders for Maritime, Land and Air.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> The CJO Directive included copies of the </p>
<p>ROE and Targeting Directives. Each Commander was reminded that he was to ensure </p>
<p>that UK personnel complied with IHL and with national ROE.</p>

<p><b>713.  On 13 March, the MOD Legal Adviser sought Lord Goldsmith’s views on  </b></p>
<p><b>a draft Targeting Directive.</b></p>
<p><b>714. </b> On 10 March, Mr Hoon wrote to Lord Goldsmith with a draft of the ‘Disarming </p>
<p>Iraq’ paper which underpinned the choice of military tasks in the Government’s draft </p>
<p>campaign objectives.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>715. </b> Mr Hoon also provided a second paper on targeting considerations. Potential </p>
<p>targets were examined by category with a description of the intelligence surrounding it, </p>
<p>its military necessity, targeting considerations and a suggested level to which authority </p>
<p>would be delegated for decisions on attacks.</p>
<p><b>716. </b> Delegation was based on an assessment of the likely civilian casualties, </p>
<p>categorised as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><i> … </i>no civilian structures within […] metres of aim point; casualty estimate: LOW </p>
<p>[…].</p>
<p><i>• </i></p>
<p><i>… </i>assessment of whether any civilian objects in weapon effect radius; casualty </p>
<p>estimate: LOW or MEDIUM […].</p>
<p><i>• </i></p>
<p><i>… </i>assessment using attack specific data; civilian casualty estimate: LOW; </p>
<p>MEDIUM or HIGH […].”</p>
<p><b>717. </b> One category was “Regime Leadership Targets”, including Presidential Palaces, </p>
<p>and comprised “secure facilities” from where regime leaders could exercise command </p>
<p>and control. The targets were designed to prevent Saddam Hussein from governing Iraq </p>
<p>and deny him command and control of the Iraqi Armed Forces, including use of WMD.</p>

<p><b>718. </b> The paper stated that, to be effective, all targets identified as being active, or </p>
<p>historically used as regime command centres, must be disabled. Issues of proportionality </p>
<p>were to be “judged against the proportionality of the entire set […] against the military </p>
<p>necessity of achieving denial of WMD use”.</p>
<p><b>719. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the targeting paper would “form part of the guidance to </p>
<p>senior military commanders” to whom authority was delegated and that they would “take </p>
<p>decisions based on the same target clearance process” that was used for Ministerial </p>
<p>decisions on targeting and “on the basis of the legal advice available directly to them”.</p>
<p><b>720. </b> The paper informed, but was “not a substitute” for, the Targeting Directive, which </p>
<p>formed part of the CDS Directive to the CJO for Op TELIC.</p>
<p><b>721. </b> The paper stated that any delegation would be exercised in accordance with </p>
<p>international law and with the benefit of legal advice. Mr Hoon wrote that agreement of </p>
<p>the paper was “independent of any overall decision to authorise the use of force” and </p>
<p>would have no impact on the UK’s operational policy until such a decision was taken.</p>
<p><b>722. </b> On 13 March 2003, an official sent AM Burridge a 2001 policy paper entitled  </p>
<p>‘Joint Targeting and Battle Damage Assessment for UK Forces’, which was described  </p>
<p>as the “benchmark” for the process by which target authorisation and delegation should </p>
<p>be conducted.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>that all reasonable steps had been taken to avoid and in all cases minimise </p>

<p>504</p>
<p><b>725. </b> On 13 March, Mr Hemming wrote to Ms Adams with a draft of the Targeting </p>
<p>Directive and the CDS Directive.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> He wrote that some assumptions “may </p>
<p>need adjustment” in the light of Lord Goldsmith’s advice, and of Ministers’ and </p>
<p>Adm Boyce’s views.</p>
<p><b>726. </b> Mr Hemming wrote that, in particular, Mr Hoon had “not yet formed a view about </p>
<p>the nature and extent of any delegation in relation to the targeting of key regime </p>
<p>individuals”. He added: “We expect to know his views shortly.”</p>
<p><b>727. </b> The Targeting Directive attached to Mr Hemming’s letter set out a number of </p>
<p>designated target sets that would not require the application of the UK’s collateral </p>
<p>damage estimation methodology, including a category of “Regime Leadership </p>
<p>Personnel”. That category included Saddam Hussein, Uday Hussein and </p>
<p>Qusay Hussein.</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Mr Hemming explained the process through which the Targeting Directive </p>
<p>would work:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon would approve the authorisation proposal.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adm Boyce would issue the Directive to Lt Gen Reith.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lt Gen Reith would pass authority to AM Burridge and sub-delegate authority </p>
<p>to Air Vice Marshal Glenn Torpy, Air Contingent Commander, for particular </p>
<p>categories of targets.</p>
<p><b>729. </b> There were nine legal advisers integrated into the clearance process: three at each </p>
<p>level for the relevant commander. Each lawyer had the ability to seek advice from further </p>
<p>up the command chain and each legal office was overseen by the next legal office in  </p>
<p>the chain of command.</p>
<p><b>730. </b> Mr Hemming wrote that the Targeting Directive was kept “under constant review” </p>
<p>and targets authorised by AM Burridge or AVM Torpy would be reported to, and monitored </p>
<p>by the DTIO on a daily basis. The DTIO would report to Adm Boyce and Ministers.</p>
<p><b>731.  Lord Goldsmith emphasised that Mr Hoon would need to satisfy himself that </b></p>
<p><b>adequate arrangements were in place to ensure that targets fully complied with </b></p>
<p><b>the UK’s obligations under IHL.</b></p>
<p><b>732.  Lord Goldsmith also asked to receive daily reports on the targets attacked.</b></p>
<p><b>733. </b> Ms Adams replied to Mr Hemming on 19 March with Lord Goldsmith’s views in the </p>

<p><b>734. </b> Lord Goldsmith said it was for Mr Hoon “to decide, on the basis of military and </p>
<p>political advice, the extent to which he should delegate his authority to approve targets”. </p>
<p>However, “given the heightened scrutiny of the proposed campaign”, Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>emphasised that Mr Hoon needed to satisfy himself that adequate arrangements were  </p>
<p>in place to ensure that targets approved under the delegated authority would fully </p>
<p>comply with the UK’s obligations under IHL.</p>
<p><b>735. </b> Lord Goldsmith saw no legal objection in principle to delegation “provided that”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the scope of the delegation was clearly defined (to protect the position of the </p>
<p>relevant commander);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clear instructions were given that the commander to whom authority was </p>
<p>delegated was required to comply with IHL;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon was satisfied that arrangements had been made to ensure that the </p>
<p>commander to whom authority had been delegated had access both to adequate </p>
<p>legal advice on IHL and technical advice from UK targeteers trained in the </p>
<p>requirements of IHL; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the public record, “especially in Parliament”, reflected the reality of the target </p>
<p>clearance process and the fact of delegation.</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Lord Goldsmith considered it “unwise” to delegate authority to attack targets that </p>
<p>would raise “significant legal issues” or which were “politically sensitive”. Those targets </p>
<p>should remain subject to “appropriate political control”.</p>
<p><b>737. </b> Mr Hoon needed to be satisfied that arrangements were in place “to do everything </p>
<p>feasible to avoid accidental harm to refuges, humanitarian convoys and other civilians”. </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith stressed the need to ensure that attacks on airports or air fields did not </p>
<p>impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p><b>738. </b> Ms Adams wrote that Lord Goldsmith had considered the process of approving </p>
<p>targets under delegated authority, including the arrangements for the provision of legal </p>
<p>advice, as explained in Mr Hemming’s letter.</p>
<p><b>739. </b> Lord Goldsmith believed that the proposed delegation in the Targeting Directive </p>
<p>was “acceptable” subject to seven points where he suggested amendments or </p>
<p>clarification.</p>
<p><b>740. </b> One of those points was Lord Goldsmith’s understanding that the Targeting </p>
<p>Directive would be issued “for the time being without delegated authority to attack </p>
<p>individual members of the Iraqi regime”.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> Such targets were likely to be “highly politically sensitive” and Mr Hoon should </p>
<p>consider very carefully whether to delegate authority for those targets. If Mr Hoon </p>
<p>were minded to do so, Lord Goldsmith requested further briefing on the considerations </p>
<p>Mr Hoon believed would justify the targeting of specific individuals and recommended </p>
<p>that Mr Straw was involved in any consideration of the issue.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p>506</p>
<p><b>742. </b> Lord Goldsmith also asked to receive copies of the daily reports on targets </p>
<p>attacked under delegated authority.</p>
<p><b>743.  On 20 March, Lord Goldsmith advised Mr Hoon that he would need to </b></p>
<p><b>consider whether an individual was a legitimate military target and proportionality </b></p>
<p><b>in considering delegation of authority to attack Iraqi leadership targets.</b></p>
<p><b>744. </b> On 20 March, Lord Goldsmith wrote to Mr Hoon with advice about the points </p>
<p>he should address in considering whether to delegate authority to target particular </p>
<p>individuals in the Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> The letter followed a meeting the previous evening </p>
<p>between Mr Hoon, Lord Goldsmith and Mr Straw.</p>
<p><b>745. </b> Lord Goldsmith referred to his previous advice that Mr Hoon must be satisfied  </p>
<p>that adequate arrangements were in place to ensure that targets approved under  </p>
<p>the delegated authority complied with the UK’s obligations under IHL. The delegation </p>
<p>granted for the campaign was “extremely wide” and AM Burridge had “been </p>
<p>granted authority to authorise attacks which, collectively, could cause significant </p>
<p>civilian casualties”.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“While I recognise the need for some delegation, given the likely speed and extent of </p>
<p>the campaign, I think it right to note that when we met in Jack [Straw]’s office in the </p>
<p>House on 4 February I proposed a system under which we could have personally </p>
<p>approved more targets identified for the first stage of the campaign. Given the </p>
<p>degree of public interest in the IHL aspects of the campaign, you will of course have </p>
<p>to be prepared to justify publicly and in Parliament the decision to delegate authority </p>
<p>to approve targets in the event of any controversial incidents.”</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Lord Goldsmith set out two issues that Mr Hoon should consider in deciding </p>
<p>whether to delegate authority for “individual leadership targets”.</p>
<p><b>748. </b> First, Mr Hoon must be satisfied that targeting a particular individual was a </p>
<p>legitimate military objective under IHL. There were two circumstances in which </p>
<p>individuals might be a legitimate target:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>if they were a member of the armed forces of Iraq within the meaning of  </p>
<p>Article 43 of the 1st Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (AP1); or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>civilians “for such time as they take a direct part in the hostilities” under  </p>
<p>Article 5(13) of AP1.</p>
<p><b>749. </b> The assessment of whether an individual fell under either category of being a </p>
<p>legitimate target was “a question of fact to be made on the basis of the actual status, </p>
<p>functions and activities of the person concerned”. An individual’s constitutional position </p>
<p>could not by itself justify the conclusion that he was a member of the Armed Forces.</p>
<p>263 </p>
<p>Letter Goldsmith to Hoon, 20 March 2003, [untitled].</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>507</p>
<p><b>750. </b> Lord Goldsmith said that in relation to the “three ‘dramatic’ targets”, Mr Hoon would </p>
<p>need to be satisfied that there was “sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion that they </p>
<p>actively participate in military command and control”. It was not enough “to assess that </p>
<p>a person is likely, if certain circumstances occur, to take over military command and </p>
<p>control”. Article 51(3) AP1 did not allow for the pre-emptive targeting of civilians.</p>
<p><b>751. </b> Second, having established that an individual was a legitimate target, Mr Hoon </p>
<p>should consider “the question of proportionality”.</p>
<p><b>752. </b> The proportionality assessment would need to be considered at the time an attack </p>
<p>was authorised, based on the place where the person was suspected to be and having </p>
<p>regard to IHL.</p>
<p><b>753. </b> Lord Goldsmith had “no doubt” that AM Burridge would consider carefully whether </p>
<p>any proposed attack was proportionate:</p>
<p>“But given the sensitivity of targeting individuals and the distinct possibility that an </p>
<p>attack may not succeed (either because the intelligence was wrong or because </p>
<p>the individual moved on before the strike took place), my advice is that you should </p>
<p>consider carefully the possibility of giving guidance to the commander on how he </p>
<p>is to assess proportionality in relation to these targets. You should bear in mind in </p>
<p>this context the delegation proposed in your letter would give Air Marshal Burridge </p>
<p>authority to authorise an attack on any of the three key individuals which would </p>
<p>cause unlimited civilian casualties, no matter where the individual was located. So, </p>
<p>for example, an attack on such an individual could be authorised without reference </p>
<p>to Ministers if intelligence suggested he were in a school, hospital, mosque or </p>
<p>densely populated residential area of Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>754. </b> Lord Goldsmith advised that there were a number of points to consider in deciding </p>
<p>what guidance Mr Hoon might give, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was “the concrete military advantage of killing each particular individual?”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Mr Hoon was prepared to contemplate the delegation of authority with a high </p>
<p>estimate of casualties, was it feasible to place an upper limit on the casualties </p>
<p>which might be caused by an attack?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since the extent of the military advantage was likely to change as the campaign </p>
<p>progressed, it would be important to keep the delegation under constant and </p>
<p>careful review.</p>
<p><b>755.  Following further exchanges with Lord Goldsmith, Mr Hoon replied on 7 April </b></p>
<p><b>confirming the delegations to AM Burridge and that they would be kept under </b></p>
<p><b>constant review.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>508</p>
<p><b>756. </b> On 28 March, Dr Simon Cholerton, MOD Assistant Director Iraq (Secretariat), </p>
<p>advised Mr Hoon on the considerations raised by Lord Goldsmith.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> Dr Cholerton was  </p>
<p>to meet Mr Hoon later that day.</p>
<p><b>757. </b> Dr Cholerton wrote that the MOD had previously thought it unlikely that time-</p>
<p>sensitive intelligence on the whereabouts of key individuals would be available to enable </p>
<p>a Coalition attack specifically directed at an individual. That position had changed </p>
<p>since the campaign “began in earnest” and significant resources were being devoted </p>
<p>to obtaining further intelligence. AM Burridge was “now very keen” to establish the UK </p>
<p>position “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p><b>758. </b> Dr Cholerton advised that the MOD was satisfied that all named individuals were </p>
<p>legitimate objectives under IHL; they were either members of the Iraqi Armed Forces or </p>
<p>assessed to be taking a direct part in hostilities.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> In providing guidance for assessing the proportionality of an attack, Dr Cholerton </p>
<p>wrote that the MOD could place strict limits upon AM Burridge, such as an upper limit on </p>
<p>the number of civilian casualties as suggested by Lord Goldsmith. He added:</p>
<p>“Alternatively, we could remind the NCC [AM Burridge] in guidance that these factors </p>
<p>should be taken into account in coming to any decision, and suggest an overall limit </p>
<p>on civilian casualties of no more than […].”</p>
<p><b>760. </b> Dr Cholerton assured Mr Hoon that the military justification for the targets would be </p>
<p>reviewed on “a day by day basis” and he would be advised “as soon as there was any </p>
<p>significant change with the position”.</p>
<p><b>761. </b> Later that day, Dr Cholerton sent a second piece of advice to Mr Hoon following </p>
<p>their meeting with Air Cdre Heath and Mr Hemming.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> Mr Hoon had asked how </p>
<p>delegation could be varied according to the location of the individual.</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Dr Cholerton set out an approach which discriminated between the categories  </p>
<p>of site where the target was believed to be located:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“military location”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“special location” – such as medical facilities, places of religious worship, historic </p>
<p>and cultural sites, places of mass recreation and educational establishments </p>
<p>“and other child centred facilities”; and</p>

<p><b>763. </b> Dr Cholerton recommended that Mr Hoon should delegate target clearance </p>
<p>authority to AM Burridge:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For Category A individuals in a military location with potentially HIGH numbers </p>
<p>of civilian casualties […] or in a non-military location with potentially MEDIUM </p>
<p>numbers of civilian casualties […].</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>For Category B individuals in a military location with potentially MEDIUM </p>
<p>numbers of civilian casualties or in a non-military location with potentially LOW </p>
<p>numbers of civilian casualties […].</p>
<p><b>764. </b> That delegation was on condition that Mr Hoon was “informed as soon as possible </p>
<p>of the planned attack” and, if at all possible, before it took place.</p>
<p><b>765. </b> The names of the individuals listed under either category would be </p>
<p>provided separately.</p>
<p><b>766. </b> Dr Cholerton recommended, where targets were “outside the above casualty </p>
<p>ceilings” or were located at a “special location”, that Mr Hoon delegated unlimited </p>
<p>authority to AM Burridge. That was subject to the condition that Mr Hoon “<i>must </i>be </p>
<p>informed” of his decision to attack in advance, and that the attack could only take </p>
<p>place after AM Burridge had received confirmation that Mr Hoon had not overruled </p>
<p>his decision.</p>
<p><b>767. </b> In deciding whether or not to overrule AM Burridge’s decision, Mr Hoon would be </p>
<p>provided with details about the target’s identity, location and an estimate on the number </p>
<p>of civilian casualties.</p>
<p><b>768. </b> If Mr Hoon was content, that approach would be set out in an annex to the CDS </p>
<p>Directive and AM Burridge would not be able to delegate those responsibilities further.</p>
<p><b>769. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Lord Goldsmith on 29 March, setting out the approach </p>
<p>recommended by Dr Cholerton.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> On whether the named individuals were legitimate </p>
<p>targets, Mr Hoon wrote:</p>
<p>“I have satisfied myself that the individuals we were considering who are not formally </p>
<p>members of the Iraqi Armed Forces are taking a direct part in hostilities by their senior </p>
<p>functions in the Iraqi military command structure. Each of them is therefore in principle </p>
<p>a legitimate target who may, subject to the proportionality test, be lawfully attacked.”</p>
<p><b>770. </b> An Annex was attached to the letter setting out the two categories of individuals. </p>
<p>Category A was entitled “dramatic” and comprised Saddam, Qusay and Uday Hussain. </p>
<p>Category B was entitled “significant” and listed four senior members of the Iraqi Armed </p>
<p>Forces.</p>

<p>510</p>
<p><b>771. </b> Lord Goldsmith responded on 30 March, highlighting areas where Mr Hoon’s </p>
<p>approach might require clarification.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p><b>772. </b> Lord Goldsmith noted that “military location” had been defined using the language </p>
<p>of Article 52(2) AP1, which defined a “military objective”, but without the second limb of </p>
<p>that definition.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> It was not therefore the case that all military locations would necessarily </p>
<p>be military objectives. Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“In any event, the location is not the objective; the objective is the individual. It is not </p>
<p>obvious why as a matter of law there should be a higher (civilian) casualty limit for </p>
<p>your category of “military location” as defined.”</p>
<p><b>773. </b> Lord Goldsmith asked if it had been intended that military locations could include </p>
<p>dual-use facilities, which could fall under the current definition. If that was not the case, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith recommended revising the definition to refer to locations which were </p>
<p>considered part of the military infrastructure.</p>
<p><b>774. </b> In relation to attacks on individuals believed to be in a location which was not </p>
<p>itself a military objective, Lord Goldsmith wrote that Mr Hoon would need to be able to </p>
<p>demonstrate that he was not making a civilian object, such as a school, the object of the </p>
<p>attack: “Attacks must be limited to strictly military objectives (in this case the individual): </p>
<p>see Additional Protocol 1, Article 52.”</p>
<p><b>775. </b> Lord Goldsmith noted paragraph 1979 of the International Committee of the Red </p>
<p>Cross (ICRC) Commentary to Article 51(3), which suggested that the attacks must be </p>
<p>carried out “with means which are not disproportionate in relation to the objective, but </p>
<p>are suited to destroying only that objective”. While it was “not entirely clear” what the </p>
<p>commentary meant, it was indicative that “any decision to attack one of the individual </p>
<p>leaders”, if it caused substantial loss of civilian life, would be “legally and politically </p>
<p>controversial”, especially if the attack failed to take out the individual leader targeted.</p>
<p><b>776. </b> Those points also had to be considered in addition to the requirement that </p>
<p>“incidental civilian loss/damage should not be excessive in relation to the military </p>
<p>advantage”. Lord Goldsmith wrote that there could otherwise be a “strong risk” of the </p>
<p>UK being accused of directing attacks at the civilian population and objects in breach of </p>
<p>IHL. He advised that consideration applied “even more strongly in relation to any attacks </p>
<p>which you might be asked to approve on individuals believed to be in ‘special locations’, </p>
<p>since many of these locations are entitled to special protection under IHL and it may be </p>
<p>prohibited to commit acts of hostility directed against them”.</p>
<p>267 </p>
<p>Letter Goldsmith to Hoon, 30 March 2003, ‘Iraq: Targeting Individuals’.</p>
<p>268 </p>
<p>Article 52(2) AP1 provides that: “In so far as objects are concerned, military objectives are limited to </p>
<p>those objects which by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military </p>
<p>action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralization, in the circumstances ruling at the </p>
<p>time, offers a definite military advantage.”</p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>511</p>
<p><b>777. </b> On AM Burridge’s authority outside the delegated limits, Lord Goldsmith wrote </p>
<p>that Mr Hoon had “not delegated authority” because effectively AM Burridge could not </p>
<p>proceed without Mr Hoon’s approval. He added:</p>
<p>“It does not seem entirely clear why you have not said this in terms, particularly </p>
<p>given the need for clarity in the scope of any delegation in order to protect the </p>
<p>position of the commander (which I emphasised in my earlier advice).”</p>
<p><b>778. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that his understanding was that Mr Hoon would not seek his </p>
<p>advice on the lawfulness of the attack, given the time-sensitive nature of such targets:</p>
<p>“This is a matter for you. However, the judgement as to whether such attacks are </p>
<p>lawful is likely to be a very difficult one to make. You will therefore wish to satisfy </p>
<p>yourself that the legal position has been fully considered, bearing in mind that you </p>
<p>could ultimately be held legally responsible for any such decision.”</p>
<p><b>779. </b> Mr Hoon replied on 7 April, confirming that he had decided to continue with the </p>
<p>delegations as he had set out in his letter of 29 March but that he would keep them </p>
<p>under constant review.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>780. </b> Mr Hoon confirmed that he appreciated the distinction between military location </p>
<p>and military objective, acknowledging that it could include dual-use facilities. He </p>
<p>added that, in deciding on the delegation for Category A targets, he had considered </p>
<p>that any high number of casualties at a military location “would be somewhat less </p>
<p>controversial than at any other sort of location”. He had hoped that this was in keeping </p>
<p>with Lord Goldsmith’s suggestion that he should consider placing limitations on the </p>
<p>circumstances in which attacks might be authorised by considering their locations.</p>
<p><b>781. </b> Mr Hoon wrote that the process whereby he could overrule AM Burridge’s </p>
<p>decisions was created because Mr Hoon could not take advice “in the normal way in  </p>
<p>the time available”. He explained:</p>
<p>“… I can overrule the National Contingent Commander’s decision, but I cannot </p>
<p>take it for him. Air Marshal Burridge only refers to me when he has already decided </p>
<p>that he believes an attack should go ahead, and that it would be lawful based upon </p>
<p>the legal advice available to him. As you are aware, we have already tested this </p>
<p>mechanism and Brian Burridge is in no doubt about the position: the decision to </p>
<p>attack remains his.”</p>
<p><b>782. </b> Mr Hoon concluded that the position remained different for matters outside </p>
<p>AM Burridge’s other delegations. Those would continue to be referred to Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>he would take Lord Goldsmith’s advice in the normal way.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>512</p>
<p><b>783.  In his post-operation report, AM Burrridge drew attention to the risks which </b></p>
<p><b>might have arisen because directives on targeting and ROE were only issued </b></p>
<p><b>shortly before operations began.</b></p>
<p><b>784. </b> AM Burridge produced his post-operation report on 8 May 2003.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> On lessons </p>
<p>identified, he wrote that the MOD was “understandably reluctant to press for legal advice </p>
<p>at the highest level on issues relating to the <i>jus in bello</i> before the Attorney General had </p>
<p>advised on the <i>jus ad bellum”.</i> The impact was “that a significant number of assumptions </p>
<p>had to be made in the planning process which, had they been wrong, might have had  </p>
<p>a serious impact upon the conduct of the operation”.</p>
<p><b>785. </b> AM Burridge continued:</p>
<p>“Several key directives (ROE and Targeting in particular) were issued only shortly </p>
<p>before operations began, and certainly too late for safe implementation had they </p>
<p>contained significant changes. While the traditional Law of Armed Conflict provided </p>
<p>at least the hymn sheet, many questions remained outstanding, and some of the </p>
<p>staffing issues (such as targeting delegations) betrayed a corporate difficulty in </p>
<p>coming to terms with the prospect of war-fighting operations of this scale and </p>
<p>character. Of particular importance was the juxtaposing of the ROE and Targeting </p>
<p>Directives, which has probably never been more significant. The final ROE profile </p>
<p>was received in my Headquarters two hours before operations commenced.”</p>
<p><b>786. </b> AM Burridge wrote that the UK’s history over the last 12 years of “peacekeeping </p>
<p>in relatively benign environments” had reduced its ability to “exercise military judgment </p>
<p>guided only by the principles of LOAC”. That had “manifested itself at every level, not </p>
<p>only during the lengthy consideration of where targeting delegations should lie, but also </p>
<p>at the tactical level where complaints of over-regulation were followed by complaints  </p>
<p>of insufficient guidance”.</p>
<p><b>787. </b> In the period leading up to operations, and even in the early stages of combat, </p>
<p>AM Burridge stated that the questions asked across all three environments revealed </p>
<p>that “the lack of further guidance was at first disconcerting”. That lesson was “quickly </p>
<p>and successfully learned, that responsibility should rest at the lowest level and </p>
<p>that military commanders respond well to the freedoms given to them despite the </p>
<p>attendant responsibilities”.</p>
<p><b>788.  Witnesses to the Inquiry emphasised the care which had been exercised </b></p>
<p><b>in establishing the legal framework for military operations and the authority </b></p>
<p><b>delegated to UK commanders.</b></p>

<p>6.2  |  Military planning for the invasion, January to March 2003</p>
<p>513</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Mr Bowen told the Inquiry that the MOD had “very clear rules” about undertaking </p>
<p>operations and tasks within a legal framework.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> He stated:</p>
<p>“On every occasion there will be a legal opinion. On many occasions when we </p>
<p>are operating in coalition with others, we find ourselves having to say to coalition </p>
<p>partners, because we are closely engaged with them, that is not an acceptable </p>
<p>target or this has to be done in a different way. That is a dialogue that goes on </p>
<p>absolutely constantly and nobody in the Ministry of Defence has any difficulty </p>
<p>about conveying that view, that legal view. And if it means that an operation or an </p>
<p>undertaking has to be aborted, then that’s what happens. There is no question of </p>
<p>… saying ‘Oh well, there is a greater good to be served by working with a coalition’. </p>
<p>The answer is you don’t do it because it is illegal, and that’s not something that there </p>
<p>is any chance taken on.”</p>
<p><b>790. </b> Speaking about its distinction to the US system, ACM Sir Brian Burridge set out the </p>
<p>UK approach to targeting to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We are absolutely doctrinally rigid. We use a template called strategy to task to </p>
<p>target. So that we can show an audit trail, and are required to show an audit trail, </p>
<p>from any target back to the strategy, thereby passing through all the aspects of  </p>
<p>the law of armed conflict such as discrimination, military necessity, et cetera.  </p>
<p>We are required to do that for our Law Officers in this country and we go through </p>
<p>that process with every target.”</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>791. </b> ACM Burridge said that US colleagues were “new to that as a discipline” but </p>
<p>recognised its value because “it made the dialogue with the international community  </p>
<p>a little easier”.</p>
<p><b>792. </b> ACM Burridge added:</p>
<p>“ … in being the conscience, as it were, quite often there will be nuances even </p>
<p>amongst the same operational team on the front bench at CENTCOM. So someone </p>
<p>who is able to say actually, to me, it looks a bit like this – and I do remember on a </p>
<p>couple of occasions saying ‘General, that may look okay in Washington, but let me </p>
<p>just tell you how it might look in London, or more so, Berlin or Paris or wherever.’  </p>
<p>It is not to say they needed reining in, it is just to get these nuances right they </p>
<p>needed the input from someone perhaps whose perspective was a little different.”</p>
<p><b>793. </b> Lt Gen Sir Robert Fry told the Inquiry that Sir Brian Burridge had been able to </p>
<p>influence the US “in terms of tactical engagement, targeting, the nitty gritty of operational </p>
<p>combat on a regular basis”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>514</p>
<p><b>794. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that the campaign was “very much about creating an </p>
<p>effect on the ground and making clear to the Iraqi people that our target was Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein and his regime, rather than … a more conventional military attack on the </p>
<p>country as a whole”.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>795. </b> Mr Hoon said that “in the early phase” he saw “pretty much every target that was </p>
<p>going to be attacked” but did not know whether the attack would actually take place.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>796. </b> Asked about lessons learned in relation to targeting, Mr Hoon told the Inquiry  </p>
<p>that he learned how accurate modern weapons were because he had initially been  </p>
<p>“fairly cautious” in his approach to targeting:</p>
<p>“If I was told that there was a civilian facility alongside a military one, we had quite </p>
<p>a debate. Saddam Hussein had some – at least 50 palaces located around the </p>
<p>country that he would move from one to the other, and we had quite a debate about, </p>
<p>if we hit one of these targets, what about the people who worked there? Were they </p>
<p>necessarily part of the regime?”</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>797. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he was satisfied with the assurances he </p>
<p>received about targeting issues.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> He described how he approached it with care, asked </p>
<p>questions, and was satisfied about the basis of the decisions which had been made.</p>
<p><b>798. </b> DSF1 told the Inquiry that AM Burridge had the same delegated authority for </p>
<p>collateral damage as the US Secretary of Defense, and that the UK system had </p>
<p>delegated “a lot more authority” to the NCC than the US had.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>799. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy, UK Air Contingent Commander in 2003, </p>
<p>was asked if he had been satisfied with the delegations afforded to commanders for </p>
<p>targeting. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think we made very significant progress in the run-up to the second Gulf War </p>
<p>building on the experience we had had during the No-Fly Zones, the first Gulf War, </p>
<p>and the Secretary of State … realised that the only way to maintain the tempo of  </p>
<p>the campaign was to delegate responsibility down to the lowest possible level.  </p>
<p>So I had a delegation. Brian Burridge had a delegation, and I thought it worked very </p>
<p>effectively, and we cleared a lot of targets before the campaign even started.”</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>800. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>

<p>actually not trash the joint and try to leave something at the end for us to regenerate </p>

<p><b>Sites of religious and cultural significance</b></p>

<p><b>preserve sites of religious or cultural significance.</b></p>
<p><b>802. </b> The ROE profile for Op TELIC included clear guidance on the approach to sites  </p>
<p>of religious or cultural significance:</p>
<p>“Offensive action must be directed only against military objectives … All feasible </p>

<p>“competent national authorities” of an occupied country to safeguard and preserve its </p>
<p>cultural property and where those competent national authorities are unable to do so, </p>
<p>to take “as far as possible, and in close cooperation with those authorities, the most </p>
<p>necessary measures of preservation”.</p>
<p>The First Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention, also agreed in 1954, contains </p>
<p>provisions banning the export of cultural property from occupied territory and requiring the </p>
<p>restitution of such property removed in contravention of the terms of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Second Protocol to the Convention contains further reinforcing provisions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 9 imposes, without prejudice to the provisions of the Convention, an </p>
<p>express obligation to prohibit and prevent any illicit export or other removal or </p>
<p>transfer of cultural property or unauthorised excavation of it;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Article 15, includes provisions requiring parties to the Convention to impose </p>
<p>criminal sanctions on persons who, in violation of the Convention and the Protocol, </p>
<p>make cultural property the object of attack, use cultural property in support of </p>
<p>military action, or cause extensive damage to, vandalise, or steal such property.</p>
<p>The 1954 Hague Convention and the First Protocol, according to their terms, entered into </p>
<p>force on 7 August 1956. The Second Protocol entered into force in on 9 March 2004.</p>
<p>The UK, US and Iraq signed the Convention in 1954. Iraq ratified the treaty in 1967: the </p>
<p>US in 2009. The UK has not, to date, ratified the Convention or the First Protocol and it </p>
<p>has not signed the Second Protocol.</p>
<p>In 1998 the UK signed, and in 2002, ratified the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means </p>
<p>of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of </p>
<p>Cultural Property.</p>
<p>Parties to the 1970 UNESCO Convention agree to outlaw and take measures to prevent </p>
<p>the unlawful import, export or transfer of ownership of cultural property.</p>
<p>On 30 December 2003, the UK enacted the Dealing in Cultural Objects (Offences) Act </p>
<p>2003, which made it an offence for any person to dishonestly deal in a cultural object </p>
<p>‘tainted’ as defined in the Act.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the Act, a cultural object is “tainted” if its removal or excavation from </p>
<p>a building, structure or monument of historical, architectural or archaeological interest, </p>
<p>(including any site comprising the remains of a building, structure or of any work, cave or </p>
<p>excavation) constituted an offence under the law of the UK or any other country or territory.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>518</p>
<p><b>804. </b> On 18 February 2003, Mr George Lambrick, Director of the British Council for </p>
<p>Archaeology, wrote to Dr Lewis Moonie, MOD Parliamentary Under Secretary of State </p>
<p>and Minister for Veterans.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> The letter was primarily about an ongoing maritime heritage </p>
<p>issue but Mr Lambrick also raised concerns about the steps being taken to minimise </p>
<p>potential damage to cultural sites in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>805. </b> Mr Lambrick asked that the Government take steps to ratify the 1954 Hague </p>
<p>Convention “as soon as possible and – at the very least – that Government </p>
<p>should declare its commitment to abide by the provisions of the Convention in any </p>
<p>forthcoming conflict”.</p>
<p><b>806. </b> Dr Moonie replied on 20 March, acknowledging that Mr Lambrick had also written </p>
<p>to Mr Hoon along similar lines.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>807. </b> Dr Moonie stated that the UK had signed but not yet ratified the 1954 Hague </p>
<p>Convention or its protocols but hoped “to be in a position to do so soon”. He added </p>
<p>that although the Convention was yet to be ratified, the UK remained “fully committed </p>
<p>to the protection of cultural property in time of armed conflict in accordance with </p>
<p>international law”.</p>
<p><b>808. </b> Dr Moonie wrote:</p>
<p>“In all our military planning, no matter the campaign, very careful attention is applied </p>
<p>to ensure that we do all we can to minimise the risk of damage to all civilian sites and </p>
<p>infrastructure. Of course damage to infrastructure inflicted by Iraqi forces cannot be </p>
<p>ruled out, and it remains a priority concern for the Coalition to address this threat.”</p>
<p><b>809. </b> The Inquiry received a joint written submission from 13 heritage and cultural </p>
<p>organisations on 17 February 2010 which addressed the problems faced by UK forces </p>
<p>with respect to safeguarding the cultural heritage in Iraq.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p><b>810. </b> The submission stated that archaeological and cultural heritage experts had made </p>
<p>numerous attempts to alert political and military personnel engaged in the anticipated </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq “on both sides of the Atlantic” about the importance of cultural sites. </p>
<p>It stated that “because no UK government department had taken responsibility for </p>
<p>cultural heritage matters, most such letters were met with little or no response”.</p>
<p><b>811. </b> The submission stated that, on 2 February 2003, Dr Peter Stone, an archaeological </p>
<p>and cultural heritage expert from the University of Newcastle, was approached informally </p>
<p>by a serving officer in the Royal Navy seeking help to identify archaeological sites in Iraq </p>
<p>that might require protection in the event of a conflict.</p>

<p><b>812. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the Royal Navy officer was part of the Defence </p>
<p>Intelligence Human Factors (DI-HF branch), which was part of DTIO.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Professor Stone wrote later in his book, <i>The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in </i></p>
<p><i>Iraq, </i>that he worked with Professor Roger Matthews, Director of the British School of </p>
<p>Archaeology in Iraq, and Dr Neil Brodie, a specialist in the illicit trade of antiquities, to </p>
<p>provide the MOD with an itemisation of the locations and details of the most important </p>
<p>historic sites in Iraq.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>814. </b> Professor Stone wrote that those sites were added to the British military maps </p>
<p>for the conflict and British Military Field Orders identified them as places to be avoided. </p>
<p>Professor Stone reported that the list was also drawn to the attention of Lord Goldsmith, </p>
<p>who provided advice on the legality of potential targets, and was also shared with </p>
<p>Coalition partners.</p>
<p><b>815. </b> Mr Hoon told the House of Commons on 3 April 2003 that:</p>
<p>“The Coalition is taking every precaution to avoid damage to the holy sites in Najaf </p>
<p>and Karbala. By contrast, we know that Saddam Hussein has plans to damage </p>
<p>these sites and blame the Coalition. Indeed his forces have used the site at Najaf as </p>
<p>a defensive position, firing on United States forces, who commendably did not return </p>
<p>the fire.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>816. </b> On 12 April, Mr Jacques Chirac, the French President, and Mr Bashar al-Assad, </p>
<p>the Syrian President, raised the looting of culturally significant sites, including museums </p>
<p>and archaeological remains, in conversations with Mr Blair.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> That is addressed in </p>
<p>Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>817. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office sent a paper to No.10 on 14 April in response to the </p>
<p>concerns raised on 12 April about culturally significant sites.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> It stated that both the US </p>
<p>and the UK had stressed their commitment to protecting sites such as mosques, medical </p>
<p>facilities, heritage sites and schools:</p>
<p>“The Coalition consulted widely before the commencement of the military campaign, </p>
<p>including with the archaeological community. A comprehensive list was established </p>
<p>that included such Iraqi sites, and was designed to ensure that these were avoided </p>
<p>as far as possible during the bombing campaign. We are confident that minimal </p>
<p>damage has been done to Iraqi religious, cultural and archaeological sites a result  </p>
<p>of Coalition activity.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>520</p>
<p><b>818. </b> In September 2003, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) </p>
<p>produced a review of its involvement in the preparations for the Iraq conflict.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>819. </b> Referring to Dr Stone’s involvement in identifying sites of cultural heritage </p>
<p>significance, the review stated that DCMS had only become aware of Dr Stone’s work </p>
<p>“after the event”. DCMS recommended that:</p>
<p>“In any future such cases DCMS should be consulted and kept in the loop since </p>
<p>inevitably DCMS Ministers will be questioned subsequently about any damage which </p>
<p>occurs to cultural heritage sites.”</p>
<p><b>820. </b> The review stated that “by and large” it seemed that instructions to avoid targeting </p>
<p>historic sites and buildings were heeded by the Coalition Forces. The most important </p>
<p>heritage sites were undamaged in the fighting and their special status appeared to have </p>
<p>been respected.</p>
<p><b>821.  The Inquiry has not addressed individual targeting decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>822.  Robust systems and processes were put in place for taking targeting </b></p>
<p><b>decisions, and targeting decisions were properly supported by legal advice.</b></p>
<p><b>823.  Ministers were concerned about the consequences of the air campaign and </b></p>
<p><b>the selection of targets and were proactive in their review of the guidance.</b></p>
<p><b>824.  The final versions of Directives and ROE were sent at a very late stage </b></p>
<p><b>in the preparations for military operations, but the Inquiry is satisfied that </b></p>
<p><b>comprehensive guidance was available to those taking decisions.</b></p>
<p><b>825.  International humanitarian law principles and considerations were properly </b></p>
<p><b>emphasised, and explained in easily comprehensible terms.</b></p>
<p><b>826.  There was consultation with archaeological experts (in particular  </b></p>
<p><b>Professor Stone), but the Inquiry questions whether the approach taken by the </b></p>
<p><b>MOD to secure expert advice in advance of the conflict could be said to constitute </b></p>
<p><b>“wide consultation”. It considers that DCMS should have been asked for advice.</b></p>
