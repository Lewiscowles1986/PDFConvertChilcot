<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses the immediate impact of the attacks on the US on </p>
<p>11 September 2001 (9/11), and the way in which that shaped the context in which </p>
<p>decisions on the policy towards Iraq were made.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> UK policy on Iraq before September 2001 is addressed in Section 1.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The UK’s concerns about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </p>
<p>and the risk of terrorists acquiring and using such weapons, which pre-dated the attacks </p>
<p>on the US, and the Joint intelligence Committee (JIC) Assessments of that risk are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 4. That Section also addresses the UK’s assessments of Iraq’s </p>
<p>residual chemical, biological, nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, its intent to </p>
<p>preserve and enhance those capabilities, and the likelihood of proliferation from Iraq.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The roles and responsibilities of key individuals and bodies in the UK Government, </p>
<p>including the JIC, are set out in Section 2.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After the attacks on the US on 9/11, Mr Blair declared that the UK would stand </p>
<p>“shoulder to shoulder” with the US to defeat and eradicate international terrorism. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair took an active and leading role throughout the autumn of 2001 in building a </p>
<p>coalition to act against that threat, including taking military action against the Taliban </p>
<p>regime in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair also emphasised the potential risk of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear, </p>
<p>biological or chemical weapon, and the dangers of inaction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair sought to influence US policy and prevent precipitate </p>
<p>military action by the US, which he considered would undermine the success of the </p>
<p>coalition which had been established for action against international terrorism. He </p>
<p>recommended identifying an alternative policy which would command widespread </p>
<p>international support. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In December 2001, Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq that </p>
<p>would build over time, including “if necessary” taking military action without losing </p>
<p>international support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The tactics chosen by Mr Blair were to emphasise the threat which Iraq might pose, </p>
<p>rather than a more balanced consideration of both Iraq’s capabilities and intent; and </p>
<p>to offer the UK’s support for President Bush in an effort to influence his decisions </p>
<p>on how to proceed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That remained Mr Blair’s approach in the months that followed.</p>
<p><b>UK policy on Iraq in early September 2001</b></p>
<p><b>5. </b> Since the end of the Gulf Conflict in 1991, the international community had pursued </p>
<p>a policy of “containment” towards Iraq. That was based on the provisions in a series </p>
<p>of United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions intended to prevent Iraq from </p>
<p>developing WMD or threatening its neighbours and international peace and security.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.1  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The policy had a number of dimensions. Its key components were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a prohibition on the possession of WMD or long-range ballistic missiles, </p>
<p>or programmes to develop such capabilities; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an arms embargo; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic sanctions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a strong deterrence component provided by US and UK forces stationed in the </p>
<p>region enforcing the northern and southern No-Fly Zones (NFZs) and supporting </p>
<p>the arms embargo and economic sanctions regime. </p>
<p><b>The UN Security Council</b></p>
<p>The UN Security Council is composed of five Permanent Members – China, France, the </p>
<p>Russian Federation, the United Kingdom and the United States; and ten non-permanent </p>
<p>Member States, elected by the UN General Assembly for two-year terms and not eligible </p>
<p>for immediate re-election. </p>
<p>The Presidency of the Security Council is held by the Member States of the Security </p>
<p>Council in turn in the English alphabetical order of their names. Each President holds </p>
<p>office for one calendar month. </p>
<p>Each Member State has one vote. Decisions on substantive matters, and the adoption </p>
<p>of a Security Council resolution, require nine positive votes, without any of the five </p>
<p>Permanent Members voting against the decision. That is usually described as the “veto” </p>
<p>power held by the Permanent Members. Decisions on procedural matters are made by </p>
<p>an affirmative vote of at least nine of the 15 Member States. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Throughout the 1990s, there were concerns about the willingness of President </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime to disarm in accordance with the obligations imposed by </p>
<p>the UN. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> After the election of May 1997, the Government had to deal with a series of </p>
<p>confrontations between Iraq and the international community about the ability of </p>
<p>inspectors from the UN Special Commission (UNSCOM) to fulfil its remit, including </p>
<p>difficulties over access to sites which Iraq had designated as Presidential palaces. </p>
<p>Those events and the action in the UN Security Council, and by Mr Kofi Annan, </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General from January 1997 to December 2006, to persuade Iraq </p>
<p>to co-operate, are set out in Section 1. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> It was widely assumed that Saddam Hussein had retained some of his chemical and </p>
<p>biological capability and a small number of ballistic missiles which might be armed with </p>
<p>chemical or biological warheads, and that he had aspirations to preserve and enhance </p>
<p>his capabilities for the future.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The UK Government considered that a willingness to use force was an essential </p>
<p>element of UK policy in persuading Saddam Hussein to co-operate. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>11. </b> For instance, in a statement to the House of Commons on 24 February 1998, </p>
<p>Mr Blair stated that “nothing else” apart from “effective diplomacy and firm willingness </p>
<p>to use force” would have changed Saddam Hussein’s mind and produced a signed </p>
<p>agreement with the UN:</p>
<p>“Throughout the dispute, our aim has been a peaceful, diplomatic settlement. </p>
<p>There was no desire on either side of the Atlantic to use force, but it was also clear </p>
<p>to us throughout that Saddam Hussein only understands and respects force …</p>
<p>“… As Kofi Annan said in Baghdad: ‘You can achieve much by diplomacy, but you </p>
<p>can achieve a lot more when diplomacy is backed by firmness and force.’</p>
<p>“I would put it this way: with Saddam, diplomacy plus force equals success.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“Saddam Hussein has spent seven years playing for time, but has been thwarted </p>
<p>by the resolve of the international community. It is now clearer than ever that his </p>
<p>games have to stop once and for all. If they do not, the consequences should be </p>
<p>clear to all.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Regime change became the officially-stated objective of US policy after the passage </p>
<p>of the Iraq Liberation Act in October 1998.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Following further disputes about access for weapons inspectors and the withdrawal </p>
<p>of the inspectors, the US and UK attacked a series of targets in Iraq in December 1998, </p>
<p>in Operation Desert Fox. Its objective was described by Mr Blair as:</p>
<p>“… to degrade the ability of Saddam Hussein to build and use weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction, including command and control and delivery systems, and to diminish </p>
<p>the threat that Saddam Hussein poses to his neighbours by weakening his military </p>
<p>capability.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>15. </b> The impact of Operation Desert Fox is addressed in Section 4.1 </p>
<p><b>16. </b> In a press conference on 20 December 1998, Mr Blair explicitly ruled out a “land </p>
<p>war in Iraq with literally hundreds of thousands of allied troops engaged” and called for </p>
<p>a future strategy based on containment and stability for the region including a credible </p>
<p>threat of force if Saddam posed a threat to the neighbourhood or developed WMD.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>17. </b> By that stage, the Security Council was deeply divided on policy towards Iraq and </p>
<p>the other three Permanent Members of the Security Council did not support the US and </p>
<p>UK use of force.</p>

<p><b>18. </b> A report on disarmament describing the work of UNSCOM since 1991 was sent </p>
<p>to the Security Council on 25 January 1999.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> That set out in three detailed annexes </p>
<p>“material balances”, for proscribed missiles, chemical and biological weapons, for which </p>
<p>UNSCOM had been unable to account. Those were subsequently used by the UK as </p>
<p>the basis for its estimates of the material Iraq might still retain. </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s speech in Chicago, April 1999</b></p>
<p>In his speech to the Economic Club in Chicago of 22 April 1999 Mr Blair identified Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein and Mr Slobodan Milošević, the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, </p>
<p>as the cause of “many of our problems”.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That speech set out Mr Blair’s thinking on a doctrine of the international community, </p>
<p>including five principles for international intervention:</p>
<p>“First, are we sure of our case? War is an imperfect instrument for righting </p>
<p>humanitarian distress; but armed force is sometimes the only means of dealing </p>
<p>with dictators. </p>
<p>“Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? We should always give peace </p>
<p>every chance, as we have in the case of Kosovo. </p>
<p>“Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the situation, are there military </p>
<p>operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake? </p>
<p>“Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? In the past, we talked too much of exit </p>
<p>strategies. But having made a commitment we cannot simply walk away once the </p>
<p>fight is over; better to stay with moderate numbers of troops than return for repeat </p>
<p>performances with large numbers. </p>
<p>“And finally, do we have national interests involved?”</p>
<p>Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the speech had been intended to set out the consequences </p>
<p>of an interdependent world where countries would not be able to divorce their national </p>
<p>interests from the impacts of security problems in other parts of the world.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ideas for the speech, which Sir Lawrence Freedman submitted in response to a request </p>
<p>from Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, were set out in the attachment to </p>
<p>Sir Lawrence’s letter to Sir John Chilcot on 18 January 2010. The letter was published </p>
<p>on the Inquiry’s website.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>316</p>
<p><b>19. </b> UK policy towards Iraq was formally reviewed and agreed by the Defence and </p>
<p>Overseas Policy Committee (DOP) in May 1999. The UK’s policy objectives towards Iraq </p>
<p>were defined as: </p>
<p>“… in the short term, to reduce the threat Saddam [Hussein] poses to the region </p>
<p>including by eliminating his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes; and, </p>
<p>in the longer term, to reintegrate a territorially intact Iraq as a law-abiding member of </p>
<p>the international community.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The policy of containment was seen as the “only viable way” to pursue those </p>
<p>objectives. A “policy of trying to topple Saddam would command no useful international </p>
<p>support”. Iraq was unlikely to accept the package immediately but “might be persuaded </p>
<p>to acquiesce eventually”.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> After prolonged discussion about the way ahead, the UN Security Council adopted </p>
<p>resolution 1284 in December 1999, although France, Russia and China abstained.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The resolution established:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new inspectorate, the United Nations Monitoring and Verification Commission </p>
<p>(UNMOVIC), which Dr Hans Blix was subsequently appointed to lead; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a timetable to identify and agree a work programme; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the principle that if the inspectors reported co-operation in key areas, that would </p>
<p>lead to the suspension of economic sanctions.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Iraq refused to accept the provisions of resolution 1284, including the re-admission </p>
<p>of weapons inspectors. Concerns about Iraq’s activities in the absence of inspectors </p>
<p>increased. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> The US Presidential election in November 2000 prompted a further UK review of </p>
<p>the operation of the containment policy. There were concerns about how long the policy </p>
<p>could be sustained and what it could achieve. That is addressed in detail in Section 1.2.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> A JIC Assessment in October 2000, which assessed the prospects for Iraq after the </p>
<p>death of Saddam Hussein, judged:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “a significant risk of a period of <b>violent factional and internecine </b></p>
<p><b>strife </b>amongst the Sunni elite followed by the emergence of a new military </p>
<p>leader”.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>establish control of the northern towns of Mosul and Kirkuk. But they would </p>

<p>attack regime targets in the South, but they do not seek independence … Iraq’s </p>
<p>territorial integrity would be maintained.”<b> </b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Any new regime</b>” was likely to be “<b>autocratic</b> and drawn from the <b>Sunni </b></p>
<p><b>elite</b>”. “Its policies and methods” were “unlikely to be different from Saddam’s. </p>
<p>Given Iraq’s strategic interests in the Gulf, this will include a long-term desire for </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Pressure would build internationally to end Iraq’s pariah status and isolation. </p>
<p>The level of pressure would reflect the extent to which the regime appeared </p>
<p>to moderate its behaviour. But <b>Iraq’s political rehabilitation could be rapid</b>, </p>
<p>overwhelming any voices of caution from London, Washington or elsewhere.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>26. </b> There were concerns over both the continued legal basis for operations in NFZs and </p>
<p>the conduct of individual operations.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>27. </b> A further Assessment on 1 November judged that Saddam Hussein felt “<b>little </b></p>
<p><b>pressure to negotiate</b> over … resolution 1284 because the proceeds of oil smuggling </p>
<p>and illicit trade have increased significantly this year, and more countries are increasing </p>
<p>diplomatic contacts and trade with Iraq”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>28. </b> The JIC also judged:</p>
<p>“Saddam would only contemplate co-operation with [resolution] 1284, and the return </p>
<p>of inspectors … if it could be portrayed as a victory. He will not agree to co-operate </p>
<p>unless:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there is <b>UN-agreed timetable for the lifting of sanctions</b>. Saddam </p>
<p>suspects that the US would not agree to sanctions lift while he remained in </p>
<p>power;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>he is able <b>to negotiate with the UN in advance to weaken the inspection </b></p>
<p><b>provisions</b>. His ambitions to rebuild Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>programmes makes him hostile to intrusive inspections or any other </p>
<p>constraints likely to be effective.</p>
<p>“Before accepting 1284, Saddam will try to obtain the abolition of the No-Fly Zones. </p>
<p>He is also likely to demand that the US should abandon its stated aim to topple the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime.” </p>
<p><b>29. </b> In November 2000, Mr Blair’s “preferred option” was described as the </p>
<p>implementation of 1284, enabling inspectors to return and sanctions to be suspended.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>30. </b> In December 2000, the British Embassy in Washington reported growing pressure </p>
<p>to change course from containment to military action to oust Saddam Hussein, </p>
<p>but no decision to change policy or to begin military planning had been taken by </p>
<p>President Clinton.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> The Key Judgements of a JIC Assessment in February 2001 included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “broad international consensus to maintain the arms embargo at least </p>
<p>as long as Saddam remains in power. Saddam faces no economic pressure </p>
<p>to accept … [resolution] 1284 because he is successfully undermining the </p>
<p>economic sanctions regime.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Through abuse of the UN Oil-for-Food [OFF] programme and smuggling of oil </p>
<p>and other goods” it was estimated that Saddam would “<b>be able to appropriate </b></p>
<p><b>in the region of $1.5bn to $1.8bn in cash and goods in 2001</b>”, and there was </p>
<p>“scope for earning even more”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Iranian</b> interdiction efforts” had “<b>significantly reduced smuggling down </b></p>
<p><b>the Gulf</b>”, but Saddam had “compensated by <b>exploiting land routes</b> to </p>
<p>Turkey and Syria”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Most countries” believed that economic sanctions were “ineffective, </p>
<p>counterproductive and should now be lifted. Without active enforcement, the </p>
<p>economic sanctions regime” would “continue to erode”.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>32. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam needed funds “to maintain his military and security apparatus and </p>
<p>secure its loyalty”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite the availability of funds, Iraq had been slow to comply with UN </p>
<p>recommendations on food allocation. Saddam needed “<b>the Iraqi people to </b></p>
<p><b>suffer to underpin his campaign against sanctions</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Encouraged by the success of Iraq’s border trade agreement with Turkey, </p>
<p>“<b>front-line states</b>” were “<b>not enforcing sanctions</b>”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been a “significant increase in the erosion of sanctions over the past </p>
<p>six months”.</p>
<p><b>33. </b> There were differences of view within the UK Government about the benefits </p>
<p>of in-country inspections, based on a concern that they could hand the initiative to </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein without offering any substantive gains.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>34. </b> The stated position of the UK Government in February 2001 was that containment </p>
<p>had been broadly successful.</p>

<p>3.1  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>35. </b> When Mr Blair met President Bush at Camp David in late February 2001, the </p>
<p>US and UK agreed on the need for a policy which was more widely supported in the </p>
<p>Middle East region.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Mr Blair had concluded that public presentation needed to be </p>
<p>improved. He suggested that the approach should be presented as a “deal” comprising </p>
<p>four elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>do the right thing by the Iraqi people, with whom we have no quarrel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tighten weapons controls on Saddam;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>circulated by Mr John Sawers, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, on </p>
<p>7 March 2001.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> That comprised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The pursuit of a new sanctions regime to improve international support and </p>
<p>incentivise Iraq’s co-operation, narrowing and deepening the sanctions regime </p>
<p>to focus only on prohibited items and at the same time improving financial </p>
<p>controls to reduce the flow of illicit funds to Saddam Hussein, (so called </p>
<p>“smarter sanctions”). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A renewed focus on human rights abuse by the Iraq regime; and a “contract </p>
<p>with the Iraqi people”, “setting out our goal of a peaceful law-abiding Iraq, </p>
<p>fully reintegrated into the international community, with its people free to live </p>
<p>in a society based on the rule of law, respect for human rights and economic </p>
<p>freedom, and without threat of repression, torture and arbitrary arrest”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The continued operation of the No-Fly Zones, but with patrolling set at levels </p>
<p>which would minimise the risk to UK air crew. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi compliance with resolution 1284 (1999). That would “remain one of our </p>
<p>stated objectives (and retaining some incentives for Iraq to comply would be </p>
<p>necessary to restore P5 [the five Permanent Members of the Security Council – </p>
<p>China, France, Russia, the UK and the US] unity)”. </p>
<p><b>37. </b> The paper also stated that “the Iraqi regime’s record and behaviour made it </p>
<p>impossible for Iraq to meet the criteria for rejoining the international community without </p>
<p>fundamental change”.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that one of the key elements of the policy was to seal Iraq’s </p>
<p>borders to make the sanctions regime more effective.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>39. </b> During the summer of 2001 the UK had been exploring the way forward with the </p>
<p>US, Russia and France on a draft Security Council resolution to put in place a “smart </p>
<p>sanctions” regime:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had agreed that a straight rollover of the Oil-for-Food (OFF) provisions </p>
<p>would be seen as a defeat and supported reviving the UK’s draft resolution. But </p>
<p>it had not agreed the final form such a resolution should take.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France had come to the broad conclusion that a rollover would strengthen the </p>
<p>hawks in the US Administration. The UK draft resolution would be a starting </p>
<p>point but French support was “tepid”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia had set out its arguments about the defects of the UK draft but the FCO </p>
<p>formed “the impression that the problems … were not insuperable”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> In the context of questions about the attitude towards Iraq in September 2001, </p>
<p>Mr Blair emphasised that the nature of the Iraqi regime had made a difference to the </p>
<p>nature of the WMD threat and that Saddam Hussein’s “profoundly wicked” mindset </p>
<p>“definitely impacted on our thinking”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, until 11 September 2001, the UK had a policy of </p>
<p>containment, but sanctions were eroding.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> The policy was “partially successful”, </p>
<p>but it did not mean that Saddam Hussein was “not still developing his [prohibited] </p>
<p>programmes”. </p>
<p><b>The impact of 9/11</b></p>
<p><b>The immediate response to 9/11</b></p>
<p><b>42. </b> On 11 September 2001 three aircraft were hijacked and flown into the twin towers of </p>
<p>the World Trade Centre in New York and the Pentagon in Washington. A fourth hijacked </p>
<p>aircraft crashed in Pennsylvania. The attacks were unprecedented and resulted in </p>
<p>the largest ever loss of life from an enemy attack on the territory of the United States. </p>
<p>Nearly 3,000 people died, including 67 British citizens.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>43.  The UK’s response to the attacks was to offer support to the US, including </b></p>
<p><b>constructing an agenda for action against international terrorism and co-opting </b></p>
<p><b>international support.</b></p>
<p><b>44.  On 12 September Mr Blair wrote to President Bush advocating action </b></p>
<p><b>before further catastrophes, including a suggestion that the Taliban regime </b></p>
<p><b>in Afghanistan should be presented with a demand to yield Usama Bin Laden </b></p>
<p><b>and close the Al Qaida camps.</b></p>

<p><b>45. </b> In his statement following the attacks, Mr Blair stated that the democracies of the </p>
<p>world must come together to defeat and eradicate mass terrorism.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> It was:</p>
<p>“… not a battle between the United States of America and terrorism, but between </p>
<p>the free and democratic world and terrorism. We, therefore, here in Britain stand </p>
<p>shoulder to shoulder with our American friends in this hour of tragedy, and we, </p>
<p>like them, will not rest until this evil is driven from our world.” </p>
<p><b>46. </b> Describing the events of 11 September 2001, Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Director of Communications and Strategy, recorded that after the discussion in the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms (COBR), Mr Blair held a smaller meeting in No.10 with Mr </p>
<p>Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, and Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> During </p>
<p>the meeting Mr Blair asked them to work up “an international agenda which went beyond </p>
<p>the US just hitting Afghanistan”; and stated that he intended to advise President Bush to </p>
<p>issue an ultimatum to the Taliban to hand over Usama Bin Laden (UBL).</p>
<p><b>47. </b> Mr Blair sent a Note to President Bush on 12 September setting out three goals to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>bring to justice those responsible;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>construct an agenda for action against international terrorism; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>co-opt the world’s leading countries in support of action.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Blair wrote that action on the second and third goals should take place as soon </p>
<p>as possible.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Action on the first goal might include presenting the Taliban with a demand to yield </p>
<p>Usama Bin Laden and his associates and close their camps or “face guilt by complicity”. </p>
<p>That would have to be “decided on evidential and military grounds”. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> In considering the need for a political agenda, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“[A]fter reflection, there will be many who ask: what is the next stage of this evil? </p>
<p>What of their capacity to get hold of biological, chemical and other WMD? We know </p>
<p>that there are countries and individuals trading in WMD and/or trying to acquire </p>
<p>them. We need a range of sanctions and pressures to stop this. </p>
<p>“Some of this will require action that some will baulk at. But we are better to act </p>
<p>now and explain and justify our actions than let the day be put off until some further, </p>
<p>perhaps even worse catastrophe occurs. And I believe this is a real possibility.” </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Mr Blair added: “It would also help in the Islamic world if we could find a way to </p>
<p>revive the Middle East Peace Process.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>322</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Mr Blair stated that Russia and China would be crucial and that it was “time to put </p>
<p>aside other geo-political differences and unite against a common enemy”.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> A copy of the Note was sent to Mr Hoon’s Private Office, which was circulated to </p>
<p>senior officials within the MOD.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> In the context of evidence about Mr Blair’s Note to President Bush of 28 July 2002 </p>
<p>(see Section 3.3), Mr Powell told the Inquiry that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… had a habit of writing notes, both internally and to President Clinton and to </p>
<p>President Bush, on all sorts of subjects, because he found it better to put something </p>
<p>in writing rather than simply talk about it orally and get it much more concretely and </p>
<p>… in focused terms.”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>55. </b> The UN Security Council adopted resolution 1368 on 12 September which stated </p>
<p>that the Security Council had:</p>
<p>“Determined to combat by all means threats to international peace and security </p>
<p>caused by terrorist acts,</p>
<p>“Recognising the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance </p>
<p>with the Charter”.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Condemning the attacks “as a threat to international peace and security” the </p>
<p>Security Council called on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“all States to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators, </p>
<p>organisers and sponsors of these terrorist attacks” and stressed “that those </p>
<p>responsible for aiding, supporting or harbouring the perpetrators, organisers and </p>
<p>sponsors of these acts” would be “held accountable”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the international community to redouble their efforts to prevent and suppress </p>
<p>terrorist acts …”;</p>
<p>and expressed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“its readiness to take all necessary steps to respond to the terrorist attacks of </p>
<p>11 September 2001, and to combat all forms of terrorism, in accordance with its </p>

<p>323</p>
<p><b>57. </b> In his statement to the House of Commons on 14 September, Mr Blair said that the </p>
<p>events of 11 September had been a warning and that “we should act on the warning”.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Terrorists would:</p>
<p>“… if they could, go further and use chemical, biological and or even nuclear </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction. We know, also, that there are groups of people, </p>
<p>occasionally states, who will trade the technology and capability of such weapons.” </p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Blair concluded: </p>
<p>“We believe in reason, democracy and tolerance. These beliefs are the foundation </p>
<p>of our civilised world. They are enduring, they have served us well, and as history </p>
<p>has shown, we have been prepared to fight, when necessary, to defend them. </p>
<p>The fanatics should know that we hold our beliefs every bit as strongly as they hold </p>
<p>theirs, and now is the time to show it.” </p>
<p><b>59. </b> In response to an intervention from Mr Paul Marsden (Labour), who asked for </p>
<p>caution in the light of reports from American sources that NATO bombing might occur in </p>
<p>Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Afghanistan, Mr Blair replied that Mr Marsden and others:</p>
<p>“… should not pay too much attention to some of the wilder pieces of speculation </p>
<p>that inevitably are made at a time like this. It is important to recognise that the way </p>
<p>in which the United States of America has proceeded so far is exactly right: in a calm </p>
<p>and considered way, and in close consultation with allies such as ourselves.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Blair added that it was: </p>
<p>“… important that … we base our identification of those responsible on proper </p>
<p>evidence, but then that we are relentless in our pursuit of those responsible and </p>
<p>bringing them to justice.”</p>
<p><b>61. </b> In the subsequent debate on international terrorism, Iraq was mentioned briefly by </p>
<p>a number of speakers, including Mr Tam Dalyell (Labour), who argued that a generation </p>
<p>in Iraq and elsewhere in the Middle East was “growing up absolutely to loathe the United </p>
<p>States and Britain” and urged the Government to look again at “10 years of bombing of </p>
<p>Iraq and sanctions”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Asked when he had taken the decision that “we should be prepared to join the </p>
<p>Americans in using force and that we should be prepared to use force ourselves” against </p>
<p>Iraq, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think I said in my statement of 14 September 2001 that I think this issue of WMD </p>
<p>is going to take on a different meaning now. Of course the Americans had already </p>
<p>a policy of regime change. That was a policy in fact articulated by President Clinton, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>324</p>
<p>passed in 1998 following the military action we took in Iraq, US and UK in 1998. </p>
<p>So it was obviously going to be on the agenda. I was always going to make it clear </p>
<p>and did make it clear we would be shoulder to shoulder with America in dealing with </p>
<p>these threats after September 11</p>
<p>th</p>
<p>. So how we were to deal with that would be an </p>
<p>open question. That we were going to deal with it I think was pretty clear from that </p>
<p>moment on.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>63.  Following the attacks, President Bush determined that the Taliban regime </b></p>
<p><b>in Afghanistan, which was harbouring Al Qaida, should be the priority for the </b></p>
<p><b>US Administration in what it called a war on terrorism.</b></p>
<p><b>64.  In the context of a possible Phase 2 of that war, President Bush also </b></p>
<p><b>ordered the US Defense Department to be ready to deal with Iraq if it acted against </b></p>
<p><b>US interests.</b></p>
<p><b>65. </b> On 15 September the British Embassy Washington reported to London that the </p>
<p>US now looked at the world through a new prism: US policy towards Iraq would harden, </p>
<p>especially if any evidence emerged which linked Saddam Hussein to the terrorists.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The “regime-change hawks” in Washington were arguing that a coalition put together </p>
<p>for one purpose [against international terrorism] could be used to clear up other problems </p>
<p>in the region.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> President Bush convened a meeting of his national security team at Camp David </p>
<p>on 15 September.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> The team included Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr Colin Powell </p>
<p>(US Secretary of State), Mr Donald Rumsfeld (US Secretary of Defense),  </p>
<p>Mr George Tenet (Director of Central Intelligence), Dr Condoleezza Rice (US National </p>

<p><b>67. </b> The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, the 9/11 </p>
<p>Commission, reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>President Bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s regime might have had a hand in it; and that he had also thought </p>
<p>about Iran. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On the afternoon of 11 September, Secretary Rumsfeld had instructed General </p>
<p>Myers, the Vice-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that the US response </p>
<p>should consider a wide range of options and possibilities; and said that his </p>

<p><b>68. </b> Dr Rice told the Commission that the US Administration had been concerned that </p>
<p>Iraq would take advantage of the 9/11 attacks. She recalled that, in the first Camp David </p>
<p>session chaired by the President, Mr Rumsfeld had asked what the Administration </p>
<p>should do about Iraq; and that Deputy Secretary Wolfowitz had made the case for </p>
<p>striking Iraq during “this round” of the war on terrorism. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> Dr Rice also told the Commission that a Department of Defense (DoD) briefing </p>
<p>paper for the meeting, on the strategic concept for the war on terrorism, had specified </p>
<p>three priority targets for initial action: Al Qaida, the Taliban, and Iraq. The paper had </p>
<p>argued that Al Qaida and Iraq both posed a strategic threat to the United States, </p>
<p>citing Iraq’s long-standing involvement in terrorism and its interest in weapons of </p>
<p>mass of destruction.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Secretary Powell told the Commission that: “Paul [Wolfowitz] was always of the view </p>
<p>that Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with … And he saw this as one way of using </p>
<p>this event as a way to deal with the Iraq problem.” President Bush saw Afghanistan as </p>
<p>the priority.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> In his memoir, <i>Decision Points</i>, President Bush recorded:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld had said: “Dealing with Iraq would show a major </p>
<p>commitment to antiterrorism.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secretary Powell had cautioned against it and Mr Tenet had agreed. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney had “understood the threat of Saddam Hussein and </p>
<p>believed we had to address it. But now is not a good time to do it … We would </p>
<p>lose our momentum.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>72. </b> Mr Tenet wrote: </p>
<p>“When an informal vote was taken on whether to include Iraq in our immediate </p>
<p>response plans, the principals voted four to zero against it, with Don Rumsfeld </p>
<p>abstaining.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>73. </b> According to his memoir, President Bush took the decision on 16 September that: </p>
<p>“Unless I received definitive evidence tying Saddam Hussein to the 9/11 plot, I would </p>
<p>work to resolve the Iraq problem diplomatically. I hoped unified pressure by the world </p>
<p>might compel Saddam to meet his international obligations. The best way to show </p>
<p>him we were serious was to succeed in Afghanistan.”</p>

<p>326</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Dr Rice told the 9/11 Commission that President Bush had called her that day to </p>
<p>say the focus would be on Afghanistan, although he still wanted plans for Iraq should </p>
<p>the country take some action or the US Administration eventually determine that it had </p>
<p>been involved in the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>75. </b> The 9/11 Commission reported that there was some further discussion of Phase 2 </p>
<p>of the war on terrorism, at a meeting in Washington of the National Security Council on </p>
<p>17 September. President Bush had ordered the Defense Department to be ready to deal </p>
<p>with Iraq if Baghdad acted against US interests, with plans to include possibly occupying </p>
<p>Iraqi oilfields. Within the Pentagon, Mr Wolfowitz had continued to press the case for </p>
<p>dealing with Iraq. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld provided guidance on 19 September to US commanders </p>
<p>working on their contingency plans. </p>
<p><b>77. </b> The Commission reported that General Tommy Franks, Commander in Chief </p>
<p>CENTCOM (US Central Command), told them that he:</p>
<p>“… recalled receiving Rumsfeld’s guidance that each regional commander should </p>
<p>assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility. He [Franks] knew he </p>
<p>would soon be striking the Taliban and Al Qaida in Afghanistan. But, he told us, he </p>
<p>now wondered how that action was connected to what might be needed to be done </p>
<p>in Somalia, Yemen or Iraq. The CENTCOM commander told us he renewed his </p>
<p>appeal for further military planning to respond to Iraqi moves shortly after 9/11 … </p>
<p>Franks said that President Bush again turned down the request.”</p>
<p><b>78.  The JIC assessed on 18 September that the attacks on 11 September had set </b></p>
<p><b>a new benchmark for terrorist atrocity and terrorists seeking comparable impact </b></p>
<p><b>might use chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear (CBRN) devices. But only </b></p>

<p><b>81. </b> The Assessment, issued on 18 September, considered whether the attacks of </p>
<p>11 September changed the nature and scale of the terrorist threat to the UK, and </p>
<p>its potential vulnerability to major terrorist attack, and “the current and immediately </p>
<p>foreseeable threat in terms of the intention and capability of known terrorist groups”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The Assessment assumed that there would be “a continuation of the current political </p>

<p><b>82. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The attacks had “set a new benchmark for terrorist atrocity. The level of </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Terrorists seeking comparable impact may try to use chemical, biological, </p>
<p>radiological or nuclear devices …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “potential scope for terrorist attacks” was “very wide”: “But in order to </p>
<p>assess the threat to the UK, we need to consider both the capabilities and the </p>
<p>intentions of the terrorist groups.”</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>95. </b> President Bush stated that the evidence for responsibility for the attacks on </p>
<p>11 September pointed to “a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations” known </p>
<p>as Al Qaida, which was also linked to “many other organizations in different countries”. </p>
<p>Al Qaida had “great influence” in Afghanistan, and supported the Taliban regime.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> President Bush condemned the Taliban regime for “aiding and abetting murder”, </p>
<p>and demanded that it should:</p>
<p>“Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of Al Qaida who hide in your </p>
<p>land … Release all foreign nationals … Protect foreign journalists, diplomats and </p>
<p>aid workers … Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp </p>
<p>in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support </p>
<p>structure, to appropriate authorities … Give the United States full access to terrorist </p>
<p>training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating.</p>
<p>“These demands are not open to negotiation … The Taliban must act, and act </p>
<p>immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.” </p>
<p><b>97. </b> President Bush stated<i>: </i></p>
<p>“Our war on terror begins with Al Qaida, but it does not end there. It will not end until </p>
<p>every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… How will we fight and win this war? We will direct every resource at our </p>
<p>command – every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of </p>
<p>law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary instrument of war – </p>
<p>to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.</p>
<p>“This war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago … It will not look like the </p>
<p>air war above Kosovo …</p>
<p>“Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. </p>
<p>Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other </p>
<p>we have ever seen … And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to </p>
<p>terrorism. Every nation … now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you </p>
<p>are with the terrorists … From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbour </p>
<p>or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.”</p>
<p><b>98.  The attacks on 11 September 2001 fundamentally changed the context within </b></p>

<p><b>100. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld ordered a review of existing US war plans for Iraq on </p>
<p>29 September.</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>101. </b> Subsequent accounts by key members of the US Administration set out how they </p>
<p>considered the context for US policy on Iraq had changed following the attacks.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> In remarks to the press at the White House during Mr Blair’s visit on 31 January </p>
<p>2003, President Bush said:</p>
<p>“After September the 11th, the doctrine of containment just doesn’t hold any water </p>
<p>… My vision shifted dramatically after September the 11th, because I now realize </p>
<p>the stakes. I realize the world has changed.”</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>103. </b> In his memoir President Bush wrote that the “lack of a serious response” to </p>
<p>previous Al Qaida attacks had been interpreted: </p>
<p>“… as a sign of weakness and an invitation to attempt more brazen attacks … </p>
<p>After 9/11, I was determined to change that impression.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Describing the impact of the attacks on his view on Iraq, President Bush wrote:</p>
<p>“Then 9/11 hit, and we had to take a fresh look at every threat in the world. There </p>
<p>were state sponsors of terror. There were sworn enemies of America. There were </p>
<p>hostile governments that threatened their neighbors. There were nations that </p>
<p>violated international demands. There were dictators who repressed their people. </p>
<p>And there were regimes that pursued WMD. Iraq combined all those threats …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Before 9/11, Saddam was a problem America might have been able to manage. </p>
<p>Through the lens of the post-9/11 world, my view changed … I could only imagine </p>
<p>the destruction possible if an enemy dictator passed his WMD to terrorists. With </p>
<p>threats flowing into the Oval Office daily – many of them about chemical, biological </p>
<p>or nuclear weapons – that seemed like a frighteningly real possibility … The lesson </p>
<p>of 9/11 was that if we waited for a danger to fully materialize, we would have waited </p>
<p>too long. I reached a decision: We would confront the threat from Iraq, one way  </p>
<p>or another.”</p>

<p><b>105. </b> Dr Rice wrote that after 9/11:</p>
<p>“No security issue ever looked quite the same again, and every day our </p>
<p>overwhelming preoccupation was to avoid another attack … Our entire concept </p>
<p>of what constituted security had been shaken.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Tenet wrote: </p>
<p>“After 9/11, everything changed. Many foreign policy issues were now viewed </p>
<p>through the prism of smoke rising from the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. </p>
<p>For many in the Bush administration, Iraq was unfinished business. They seized </p>
<p>on the emotional impact of 9/11 and created a psychological connection between </p>
<p>the failure to act decisively against Al Qaida and the danger posed by Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>programs. The message was: We can never afford to be surprised again … we </p>
<p>might wake up one day to find that Saddam possessed a nuclear weapon, and then </p>
<p>our ability to deal with him would take on an entirely different cast.</p>
<p>“… it seemed a given that the United States had not done enough to stop Al Qaida … </p>
<p>and had paid an enormous price. Therefore … we could not allow ourselves to be </p>
<p>in a similar situation in Iraq.”</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts, Chairman of the JIC until September 2001 and subsequently </p>
<p>FCO Political Director until July 2003, told the Inquiry that “through to 9/11, the dominant </p>
<p>player [on Iraq policy in Washington] was the State Department”; but after 9/11 the </p>
<p>dominant force changed.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), told the Inquiry that “Indefinite </p>
<p>containment … looked increasingly implausible”. After 9/11 the mood in Washington </p>
<p>had “changed dramatically” and “tolerance for containment had changed”.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that the US saw 9/11 as a “Pearl Harbour of the 21st </p>
<p>Century”; they were being attacked at home and that made them “much more willing to </p>
<p>be pre-emptive”.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>110. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that 9/11 changed everything and that in his view “people </p>
<p>in Europe still don’t quite comprehend the degree”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> Mr Straw added that the attacks </p>
<p>led to a consensus across the world that a policy of tolerating failing or failed states was </p>

<p>332</p>
<p><b>111. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I think I would fairly describe our policy … as doing our best, hoping for the best, </p>
<p>but with a different calculus of risk assessment … up to September 11, we thought </p>
<p>there was a risk but we thought it was worth trying to contain it. The crucial thing </p>
<p>after September 11 is that the calculus of risk changed.”</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>112. </b> Mr Blair added: “after September 11, our view, the American view, changed </p>
<p>dramatically”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>113. </b> Mr Blair stated that his:</p>
<p>“… primary consideration … was to send an absolutely powerful, clear and </p>
<p>unremitting message that … if you were a regime engaged in WMD, you had </p>
<p>to stop.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>114.  In the UK, pursuit of agreement in the Security Council for improvements </b></p>
<p><b>in the sanctions regime for Iraq was seen as key to both sustaining the policy </b></p>
<p><b>of containment and to removing an impediment to securing a coalition for action </b></p>
<p><b>against international terrorism.</b></p>
<p><b>115.  The FCO proposed amending the UK draft resolution to address  </b></p>
<p><b>the perception that it imposed additional obligations on Iraq’s neighbours </b></p>
<p><b>to enforce sanctions. </b></p>
<p><b>116. </b> The background to the UK’s pursuit of an improved economic sanctions regime for </p>
<p>Iraq is set out in Section 1.2.</p>

<p>draft UNSCR [UN Security Council resolution} and the best way forward in the light </p>
<p>of terrorist attack in the US”, Mr Tom McKane, the Deputy Head of OD Sec, advised </p>
<p>Sir David Manning: </p>
<p>“The Cabinet Office Assessments Staff reported that Saddam Hussein was </p>
<p>comfortable and in control. He had no desire for a confrontation but could change </p>
<p>his stance if the security situation changed in the North or if a new resolution was </p>
<p>passed which brought with it tighter controls on imports and exports. Currently his </p>
<p>position is not being challenged …</p>
<p>“… there was no intelligence of an Iraqi link to the terrorist attacks in the US last </p>
<p>week. But the Iraqis were nervous of being blamed for the attack. There were </p>
<p>indications of the dispersal of Iraqi military assets. Saddam Hussein had urged </p>
<p>the US to exercise restraint.”</p>

<p>333</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr McKane added that there had been diplomatic activity over the summer to </p>
<p>explore options. In relation to the end of November deadline for the renewal of the </p>
<p>sanctions regime authorised by resolution 1360 in July 2001, the US had supported </p>
<p>reviving the UK draft “smart sanctions” resolution. But Mr McKane advised that “it was </p>
<p>doubtful in current circumstances whether they [the US] would be willing to throw much </p>
<p>weight behind it, particularly with the Russians”.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr McKane reported that officials had agreed that a revised draft resolution, which </p>
<p>“dropped the proposals to tighten existing controls and the references to neighbouring </p>
<p>states”, was the option “most likely to succeed in building a consensus”. He added:</p>
<p>“In practice, there was no realistic prospect of tightening the existing controls at the </p>
<p>present time, though we should return to this at a later date.”</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Mr William Patey, Head FCO Middle East Department, advised Mr Straw: </p>
<p>“In the context of building the broadest possible coalition for a sustained attack on </p>
<p>terrorism we need to address some of the wider concerns about our Iraq policy … </p>
<p>“The main objection to the current proposals is the perception that they impose </p>
<p>additional obligations on neighbouring states by putting the onus on them for </p>
<p>enforcing sanctions on Iraq. The reality is that our draft resolution does not impose </p>
<p>any new obligations on neighbouring states … These tightening provisions were </p>
<p>mainly window dressing. We would not lose a great deal in reality by removing </p>
<p>the provision relating to neighbouring states although it would increase the </p>
<p>presentational difficulties for the US.</p>
<p>“… we would undermine the Russian and other objections, and increase the </p>
<p>prospects for consensus in the Security Council. The unanimous backing … for a </p>
<p>Goods Review List is worth having. It would not remove the existing obligations on </p>
<p>neighbouring states or the international community as a whole … This would not be </p>
<p>easy to sell … but the alternative is a weakening of containment through growing </p>
<p>sanctions busting and the withering away of existing controls on Iraq. This would </p>
<p>leave us with little to fall back on, other than excessive reliance on military force, </p>
<p>which in turn would undermine our ability to maintain a coalition against terrorism.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Alan Goulty, FCO Director Middle East and North Africa, commented:</p>
<p>“If this approach is to be tried we should tackle the Americans soon. The key </p>
<p>argument is that progress on Iraq will help coalition-building. But that will be hard </p>
<p>to sell to the Washington hawks, especially in the Pentagon.”</p>

<p>334</p>
<p><b>122. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office responded that he agreed with the proposed way forward </p>
<p>set out in Mr Patey’s advice, subject to any views which Sir David Manning might have </p>
<p>and the need for it to be worked through with senior members of the US Administration.</p>

<p><b>terrorism; the dangers of inaction; and the failure of the Taliban to respond to </b></p>
<p><b>the ultimatum to surrender Usama Bin Laden and his followers. </b></p>
<p><b>125.  Mr Blair did not mention Iraq in his speech, but many of the points he made </b></p>
<p><b>about Afghanistan appeared in later speeches about Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>126. </b> In a speech addressing the Assembly on Terrorism on 1 October, Mr Annan stated </p>
<p>that, after the attacks of 11 September, “no one can dispute the nature of the terrorist </p>
<p>threat, nor the need to meet it with a global response”. He added that that would require:</p>
<p>“… Member States to live up to their responsibilities under international law. </p>
<p>They must deal firmly with the reality of armed groups and other non-State actors </p>
<p>who refuse to respect common principles of human dignity.</p>
<p>“It is hard to imagine how the tragedy of 11 September could have been worse. </p>
<p>Yet, the truth is that a single attack involving a nuclear or biological weapon could </p>
<p>have killed millions … The greatest danger arises from a non-State group – or </p>
<p>even an individual – acquiring and using a nuclear, biological, or chemical weapon. </p>
<p>Such a weapon could be delivered without the need for any missile or any other </p>
<p>sophisticated delivery system.”</p>

<p>and that it would hold the regime responsible for attacks against US citizens by </p>
<p>terrorists sheltered in Afghanistan”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “Taliban regime had responded by saying no evidence existed against Usama </p>
<p>Bin Laden, and that neither he nor his network would be expelled”. </p>

<p><b>149. </b> Following a visit by Mr Blair to Moscow, where there was no movement in the </p>
<p>Russian position, Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, wrote </p>
<p>to Sir David Manning on 11 October stating: </p>
<p>“The present position is not sustainable. Sanctions are eroding. Iraqi WMD </p>
<p>programmes are continuing. The Security Council is divided.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr McDonald recorded that another, simple Oil-for-Food rollover resolution would </p>

<p>“We need to convince them [the US] that uniting the Security Council on Iraq is a </p>
<p>core component of building a coalition against terrorism, not a peripheral issue. </p>
<p>We also need to head them off the temptation to take military action against Iraq </p>
<p>which would fracture the coalition.” </p>
<p><b>151. </b> Sir David Manning discussed the UK’s draft resolution, and the need for US help </p>
<p>to persuade Russia to support it, with Dr Rice on 12 October. He reported that it was </p>
<p>unlikely to be a priority for President Bush in his discussions with President Vladimir </p>
<p>Putin, the President of Russia.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Sir David and Dr Rice also discussed differences between the UK and the US </p>
<p>about the scale of any response if a UK or US pilot was shot down in the No-Fly Zones.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Operations in the No-Fly Zones</b></p>
<p>The UK had continuing concerns about the potential US response if a UK or US pilot </p>
<p>enforcing the No-Fly Zones (NFZs) was shot down by Iraq. </p>
<p>UK operations in the No-Fly Zones had been reviewed twice in the previous two years, </p>
<p>largely at the request of Mr Robin Cook, the previous Foreign Secretary, and Lord </p>
<p>Williams of Mostyn, the Attorney General, and his successor Lord Goldsmith. Those </p>
<p>reviews and the outcomes are considered in Section 1.2. </p>
<p>Mr McKane responded to a letter of 24 August from Mr David Brummell, the Legal </p>
<p>Secretary to the Law Officers, on 16 October.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> Mr McKane stated that, if the UK pulled </p>
<p>out of the southern No-Fly Zone it would have to be explained; and that “could only be </p>
<p>politically sustainable if couched on the basis that the Zone was no longer required, </p>
<p>presumably because we judged that Saddam’s behaviour and intent had shifted in a </p>
<p>satisfactory direction”. </p>
<p>Mr McKane added that it would be “very difficult” to maintain the northern Zone without </p>
<p>the southern Zone; Turkey would be “unlikely, in a minority of one, to continue to facilitate” </p>
<p>coalition patrols. Regular patrols of the northern Zone were “necessary” if lives were to </p>
<p>be saved.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>340</p>
<p>Mr McKane also wrote that nothing had happened to change the Ministerial conclusion </p>
<p>earlier in the year that, if patrolling of the southern Zone ceased, “an unacceptably high </p>
<p>risk” of “extreme humanitarian distress” would remain.</p>
<p>Mr McKane informed Sir David Manning that the MOD had been asked what would </p>
<p>have to be done to ensure that Kuwait could be defended effectively if patrolling over the </p>
<p>southern NFZ stopped. He suggested that “once the immediate crisis is over” the issue </p>
<p>should be considered again; stopping patrolling in the Zones could “remove a major </p>
<p>source of discomfort from our relations with the Arab world”.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the Cabinet Office meeting on 30 October, the MOD reported that the US had “returned </p>
<p>to normal operations over Iraq” but there were “fewer coalition patrols over a more </p>
<p>restricted area (largely south and west of the Euphrates)”.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> Contingency plans in the </p>
<p>event that a coalition aircraft was shot down were being discussed with the US.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In January 2002, Mr McKane reported that there had been no Iraqi violation of the </p>
<p>southern No-Fly Zone since 11 September 2001, and that the last Allied bombing of </p>
<p>an Iraq air defence target had taken place on 27 November 2001.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> The MOD was </p>
<p>“concerned about the risks to RAF aircrew” and considering whether “It might be </p>
<p>necessary to attack air defence targets north of the 33rd parallel … in order to make it </p>
<p>safe for such patrols to be resumed.”</p>
<p><b>153.  In late October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock advised that a damaging “vacuum” </b></p>
<p><b>in collective policy towards Iraq was looming; a “clear long-term strategy” agreed </b></p>
<p><b>with the US would be needed. The key elements included determining whether </b></p>
<p><b>UNMOVIC had any genuine value and convincing the US that the UK would not </b></p>
<p><b>support heavy military action against Iraq. The UK could not do nothing and allow </b></p>
<p><b>“war against Iraq to become the only option by default”.</b></p>
<p><b>154.  Officials concluded that a revised draft resolution was the preferred </b></p>
<p><b>option but, if that was not achievable, a rollover resolution would just sustain </b></p>
<p><b>containment. </b></p>
<p><b>155. </b> A paper written within the FCO on 24 October stated that the US was deliberately </p>
<p>keeping open the option of coercive military action and US military Commanders in Chief </p>
<p>had been “instructed … to work up contingency plans for dealing with terrorist targets </p>
<p>within their area of responsibility”.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> The MOD was “trying to discover some of the detail”. </p>
<p><b>156. </b> In relation to Iraq, the FCO paper stated that it was:</p>

<p>strikes). But such action would carry significant downsides in terms of alienating </p>
<p>world opinion.”</p>
<p><b>157. </b> The FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“The US is in no mood to co-operate with Iraq. A likely option is to make specific </p>
<p>demands backed up by threats of tougher action in the event of non-compliance. </p>
<p>Whether this includes military action will depend on US judgements about the </p>
<p>balance of advantage between the domestic pressures and the international </p>
<p>ramifications of such actions.” </p>
<p><b>158. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent Representative to the UN in New York, </p>
<p>wrote to Sir David Manning on 29 October warning that the UK’s draft resolution </p>
<p>adapting the sanctions regime “looks unachievable this autumn, largely because of </p>
<p>Russian obduracy and US unwillingness to exert sufficient pressure to move them”.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Sir Jeremy added: </p>
<p>“… there remains an urgent need for us to sort out a coherent strategy with the </p>
<p>Americans, and at a level which binds in the whole Administration and not just the </p>
<p>State Department. Our conversations with them recently … have not managed this. </p>
<p>The WMD danger is too great to ignore. A vacuum not just in the Security Council, </p>
<p>but also in our collective policy is looming. Most dangerously, the volume of talk … </p>
<p>about the military option looks from here to risk real damage to our wider interests </p>
<p>in the Middle East and our campaign against terrorism.</p>
<p>“In New York, there is widespread scepticism of the US/UK approach … The policy </p>
<p>is seen not only as a failure, but also the foremost example of the double standards </p>
<p>… in the Middle East. This corrodes support directly for sanctions … but also </p>
<p>insidiously for our broader objectives on Afghanistan and terrorism. In the longer run, </p>
<p>the failure of the Council to secure Iraqi compliance with the resolutions undermines </p>
<p>its credibility more generally.</p>
<p>“We therefore need to think hard about a clear long-term strategy … to fill this </p>
<p>vacuum (and to prevent the militarists doing so).” </p>
<p><b>160. </b> Sir Jeremy set out the main elements for such a strategy, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Drawing in the Russians on controlling Iraq’s WMD and Saddam Hussein more </p>
<p>generally. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Exploring the possibility of restoring P5 unity, which would require thinking about </p>
<p>the clarification of resolution 1284 (1999). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Working out whether UNMOVIC had any genuine political value. The Americans </p>
<p>did “not want a repeat of the UNSCOM problem, with Saddam calling the shots”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>342</p>
<p>Sir Jeremy thought an “intensive capability” on the ground would be “an enormous </p>
<p>asset” and that the US should be persuaded it was “worth paying a price for”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… perhaps most crucially, convincing the US that we will not support heavy </p>
<p>military action against Iraq in the current circumstances. If the Americans do </p>
<p>not buy into the strategy outlined above, then together we will have to think of </p>
<p>another one. We cannot do nothing and allow war against Iraq to become the </p>
<p>only option by default.”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>161. </b> The objectives should be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “unified P5 approach to tackle Iraqi WMD, perhaps involving a negotiation to </p>
<p>clarify but not renegotiate 1284”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clear limits “to avoid the Russians demanding endless concessions to secure </p>
<p>Iraqi cooperation”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“reinvigorated action to tackle illegal Iraqi revenue”. </p>
<p><b>162. </b> Sir Jeremy wrote that he “remained surprised at the lack of US and UK activity to </p>
<p>take on the Syrians over their pipeline”.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded:</p>
<p>“Much of this deals with the US angle … The most immediate need is to have a </p>
<p>dedicated discussion with them at a senior level in sufficient detail to thrash out </p>
<p>the answers on the complex questions involved.”</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“As the US-led Coalition in Afghanistan began to deal effectively with the problems </p>
<p>there, and as the US machine gathered itself to create firmer defences against any </p>
<p>possible further terrorist attacks, we began to see that there was not much energy </p>
<p>being expended in Washington on outreach, consultation and good relationships. </p>
<p>Even before I heard of any serious action being taken to prepare for a possible </p>
<p>attack on Iraq, I was coming to the conclusion that the United States was missing </p>
<p>an opportunity …”</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>165. </b> FCO junior officials prepared a draft paper, ‘Iraq: Fallback option’ for a meeting </p>
<p>on Iraq to be chaired by the Cabinet Office on 30 October, setting out the background </p>

<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those included: </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Sir David Manning continued to pursue the UK proposals for “smarter sanctions” </p>
<p>in his contacts with Russia.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>171. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry that although the focus on Afghanistan </p>
<p>and terrorism “overshadowed discussions on Iraq … there were intensive efforts … </p>
<p>to re-establish P5, and especially Russian support, for a revised Goods Review List </p>
<p>resolution”.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> That included three meetings between the Mr Straw and Mr Igor Ivanov, </p>
<p>the Russian Foreign Minister, and discussion on the telephone between Mr Blair and </p>
<p>President Putin. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Patey told the Inquiry that there had been British efforts “to sweeten the deal </p>
<p>for the Russians”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>173.  Mr Blair met President Bush on 7 November, primarily to discuss </b></p>
<p><b>Afghanistan.</b></p>
<p><b>174. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer sent Mr Straw a letter, ‘America after 11 September’, on </p>
<p>5 November.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> That drew attention to President Bush’s anxiety about the anthrax attacks. </p>
<p><b>175. </b> Commenting on the balance between multilateralism and unilateralism, </p>
<p>Sir Christopher wrote that the US had a historic preference for “informal alliances </p>
<p>and coalitions of the willing, over the sovereignty-limiting provisions of international </p>
<p>conventions”. The UN was “usually an exercise in damage limitation, save where </p>
<p>the organisation can advance US interests, as in providing Article 51 cover to fight </p>
<p>terrorism”. The best Europe could hope for was “the continued predominance of </p>
<p>mainstream pragmatists in the conduct of US foreign policy”, but “even that” was </p>
<p>“not guaranteed”.</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Sir Christopher added that Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon had leveraged UK </p>
<p>popularity “brilliantly to influence the conduct of the war on terrorism”. The “real test” of </p>
<p>that influence would be “whether we can generate a recalibrated and more energetic US </p>
<p>policy towards the Middle East, and stop the Americans doing something self-defeating </p>
<p>in Iraq or elsewhere”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Sir Christopher concluded:</p>
<p>“The Americans are very good at compartmentalising their sentimental and sincere </p>
<p>affection for Britain from the single minded pursuit of national interest. It is a gap </p>
<p>we have to close …”</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Blair visited Washington on 7 November for talks with President Bush, primarily </p>
<p>about Afghanistan.</p>

<p>345</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Mr Blair gave President Bush a Note during their private meeting, which, under a </p>
<p>section on ‘International Initiatives’, referred to the need for a new UN resolution on Iraq </p>
<p>and a wider ‘WMD Agreement’.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>180. </b> The record of the meetings contains no information about discussions of Iraq.</p>

<p><b>181. </b> The Government has confirmed that a telephone conversation between Mr Blair </p>
<p>and President Bush on 12 November did take place but it has been unable to find </p>
<p>a record of the conversation.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> Other papers indicate that the conversation focused </p>
<p>primarily on Afghanistan.</p>
<p><b>182.  In mid-November Mr Powell suggested that, after Afghanistan, the UK should </b></p>
<p><b>use its leverage to engage President Bush on an alternative strategy to deal with </b></p>
<p><b>the threat posed by terrorism, including the need to persuade the US to take the </b></p>
<p><b>Middle East Peace Process seriously. </b></p>
<p><b>183.  Mr Powell argued that only the removal of Saddam Hussein and a new </b></p>
<p><b>regime would deal with the risks from Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>184.  Mr Powell envisaged that would be achieved by “proper backing” for the </b></p>
<p><b>internal opposition in Iraq, not the insertion of arms inspectors or bombing </b></p>
<p><b>Baghdad. </b></p>
<p><b>185. </b> On 15 November Mr Powell wrote to Mr Blair stating that:</p>
<p>“If we are successful in Afghanistan over the next few days and weeks there is a real </p>
<p>danger that we will part company with the Americans on what comes next. The right </p>
<p>wing of the Republican Party will want to carry on by bombing Iraq and Somalia. </p>
<p>[President] Bush’s natural tendency would be to support them unless presented  </p>
<p>with an alternative. David [Manning] has commissioned some work by the FCO </p>
<p>on this, but I think it needs some lateral political thinking about what would provide </p>
<p>an attractive – and effective – alternative strategy.</p>
<p>“I think the first thing is to persuade the Americans that rather than repeating what </p>
<p>we have done in Afghanistan elsewhere we need to use the leverage that our </p>
<p>success in Afghanistan provides to achieve our aims elsewhere.”</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>186. </b> On Iraq specifically, Mr Powell wrote:</p>
<p>“… I think we need a new policy for Iraq. I do not believe that a warmed over UN </p>
<p>Security Council resolution re-inserting arms inspectors and changing sanctions is </p>
<p>likely to cut any ice with the Americans let alone the Russians and French … I think </p>
<p>we need a completely fresh look at our policy starting from our objectives.” </p>

<p>346</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr Powell added:</p>
<p>“It seems to me that our over-riding objective is the removal of Saddam not the </p>
<p>insertion of arms inspectors. It is only with a new regime that we can be sure of an </p>
<p>end to CBRN proliferation and an end to hostile intent towards his neighbours plus </p>
<p>his support for terrorism. We need to make a far greater effort to bring him down […] </p>
<p>with proper backing for internal opposition […] </p>
<p>“There will be a military role, but bombing Baghdad is not the most obvious route </p>
<p>to changing regime.”</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Powell made a number of proposals for dealing with terrorists, including the </p>
<p>need:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>for “much stronger domestic defence against future terrorist attacks”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to stop the “martyrdom of UBL setting him up as … an inspiration to another </p>
<p>wave of suicide bombers”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to address political causes. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Powell wrote: “Most importantly that means persuading the Americans to take </p>
<p>the MEPP seriously.” </p>
<p><b>190. </b> Mr Powell concluded that Mr Blair should engage President Bush:</p>
<p>“… on all this next week, and perhaps send him another note setting out the way </p>
<p>forward before the Pentagon tries to take him off on another tangent”. </p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Blair replied: “I agree with this entirely and I should prepare a note for GWB </p>

<p><b>195. </b> Mr McKane identified two options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a further, simple rollover of the OFF resolution which “would do nothing to </p>
<p>address the humanitarian position in Iraq or to stop erosion of the sanctions </p>
<p>regime and would indicate that the approach to Iraq set out in SCR 1284 had hit </p>
<p>the buffers”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a compromise of a further rollover for six months with a commitment to revisit </p>
<p>the items controlled under the Goods Review List (GRL).</p>
<p><b>196. </b> The FCO preferred the second option, but with a two month, rather than six month </p>
<p>rollover.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> On 29 November, the Security Council unanimously adopted resolution 1382 </p>
<p>extending the existing regime for 180 days and proposing a Goods Review List. </p>
<p>The procedures for operating the List would be adopted “subject to any refinements … </p>
<p>agreed by the Council”, for implementation on 30 May 2002.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>198. </b> The resolution also reaffirmed the Security Council’s “commitment to a </p>
<p>comprehensive settlement on the basis of the relevant resolutions … including any </p>
<p>clarification necessary for the implementation of resolution 1284 (1999)”.</p>
<p><b>President Bush’s comments, 26 November 2001</b></p>
<p><b>199.  On 26 November, President Bush called publicly for the readmission of </b></p>
<p><b>weapons inspectors by Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>200. </b> In a press conference on 26 November, President Bush was asked what message </p>
<p>he would like to send to Iraq. He responded that his message was:</p>
<p>“… if you harbour a terrorist, you’re a terrorist … If you develop weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction that you want to terrorize the world, you’ll be held accountable … And I </p>
<p>also have said … we’re going to make sure that we accomplish each mission that </p>
<p>we tackle. First things first.”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>201. </b> Asked whether agreement to allow weapons inspectors back into Iraq was an </p>
<p>“unconditional demand”, President Bush stated that Saddam Hussein needed to let </p>
<p>weapons inspectors return to prove to the world that he was not developing weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction. </p>
<p><b>202. </b> Asked what would be the consequences if Saddam did not, Mr Bush said: </p>
<p>“That’s up for – he’ll find out.”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Asked to confirm previous remarks that Afghanistan was “just the beginning”, </p>
<p>President Bush replied that he could not make it clearer that, if nations developed </p>

<p>weapons of mass destruction “that will be used to terrorize nations, they will be held </p>
<p>accountable”.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Asked if the definition of terrorism was being expanded to countries like North </p>
<p>Korea which did not just harbour terrorists but developed such weapons, President Bush </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“… we want North Korea to allow inspectors in …</p>
<p>“So part of the war on terror is to deny … weapons to be used for means of terror </p>
<p>getting into the hands of nations that will use them.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… I’ve always had that definition, as far as I’m concerned.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Asked when and where President Bush had included any country that produced </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction in his definition of terrorist aiding states, Mr Ari Fleischer, </p>
<p>President Bush’s Press Secretary, suggested that referred to “the obvious and </p>
<p>well-known fact that Iraq and North Korea” were already listed by the US State </p>
<p>Department as state sponsors of terrorism.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>206. </b> Mr Fleischer subsequently referred to concerns that Al Qaida or another terrorist </p>
<p>organisation would seek to acquire nuclear weapons from Iraq or North Korea. That </p>
<p>was “another way they would use nuclear weapons if they were to give them to another </p>
<p>nation or an entity, a terrorist group like Al Qaida”.</p>
<p><b>207.  Following President Bush’s remarks, speculation about the possibility of </b></p>
<p><b>military action against Iraq immediately increased.</b></p>
<p><b>208. </b> The British Embassy Washington commented that although the White House </p>
<p>spokesman had described President Bush’s remarks as a re-iteration of existing policy, </p>
<p>they would fuel media speculation about a shift towards military moves towards Iraq.</p>

<p>In its public posture the US was keeping all options open. </p>

<p>differences between different elements of the US Administration about the way ahead, </p>
<p>including whether to support any of the opposition groups inside or outside Iraq as part </p>
<p>of planning for regime change.</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Asked about the meaning of President Bush’s comments, Secretary Powell stated </p>
<p>that the President had not said what he meant and he was “not going to prejudge what </p>

<p><b>211. </b> Asked if the term “he’ll find out” was threatening, Secretary Powell stated that it </p>
<p>should be seen “as a very sober, chilling message”. There were “many options available </p>

<p><b>212. </b> Secretary Powell stated that the US had been pushing “smart sanctions”. It had </p>

<p>that Iraq “could very easily solve the problem by adhering to the demands” made by </p>

<p> He emphasised the US support for the discussion in </p>
<p>the Security Council on more effective and narrowly defined sanctions.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Following discussions with senior US Senators, primarily about developments </p>
<p>in Afghanistan, the British Embassy Washington reported on 29 November that  </p>
<p>Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, had been told there was “an overwhelming </p>
<p>majority (80 votes) in the Senate in favour of taking out Saddam Hussein, as a piece </p>
<p>of unfinished business”.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>220. </b> One Senator suggested that the military had a “very detailed plan”, which he </p>
<p>described as constituting precision bombing and Special Forces’ support for internal </p>
<p>uprisings. He “believed they had the capacity to decapitate Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>Preparations were well beyond the discussions stage.” </p>
<p><b>221. </b> The Senator also suggested that the decision to attack the Taliban in Afghanistan </p>
<p>was “a feint: he [President Bush] had been offered the choice between Afghanistan and </p>
<p>Iraq and had chosen to do the former first”.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Another Senator had set out a strategy of “increased heat”: with strengthened </p>
<p>sanctions, the re-introduction of inspectors, and compiling evidence followed by military </p>
<p>action. That Senator had said that if the UK could not agree with this it should be </p>
<p>weighing in now with the Administration. It would be much more difficult for the US to go </p>
<p>it alone than with the European allies in support. Other countries linked to international </p>
<p>terrorism were not threats of the same order as Iraq.</p>
<p><b>223. </b> The Embassy commented that the discussions offered “an interesting insight into </p>
<p>the mood on the Hill”. There was “no reason to believe” that either Senator spoke for the </p>
<p>Administration or had privileged access to Pentagon plans; the military details did “not </p>
<p>square with what we understand of military thinking”.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> On 1 December, the British Embassy Washington reported that public speculation </p>
<p>about action against Iraq was moving faster than Administration thinking; and that the </p>
<p>momentum in the debate had shifted in the direction of the hawks.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> A <i>Washington Post</i> </p>
<p>poll of 27 November had found that 78 percent of Americans favoured “having US forces </p>
<p>take military action against Iraq to force Saddam Hussein from power”.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> The Embassy reported that, in addition, two new elements had emerged in </p>
<p>comments from the Administration: an increased stress on the need for arms inspectors; </p>
<p>and a clearer identification of WMD with the terrorist threat. The increased emphasis </p>
<p>on weapons inspectors had been seen by some as a step towards military action – </p>
<p>“a Taliban-like deadline”; others might see it as an alternative to unilateral action.</p>

<p><b>226. </b> In comments during an interview on <i>CBS</i> on 2 December, Secretary Powell stated </p>
<p>explicitly that President Bush had not taken any decisions on what the next phase of </p>
<p>the campaign against terrorism would be.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> Moreover, none of the President’s advisers, </p>
<p>either individually or collectively, had yet made “recommendations … as to what we </p>
<p>should do in the next phase” of the war on terror. </p>
<p><b>227. </b> Secretary Powell stated that the US was “watching Iraq” because it had “always </p>
<p>developed weapons of mass destruction that are a concern to us”. Saddam Hussein had </p>
<p>not been “as successful as he would have liked to have been” because sanctions and </p>
<p>containment had been “effective”. </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Asked why the US did not just take Saddam Hussein out, Secretary Powell replied </p>
<p>that President Bush would “make a judgement in due course” about how to “deal with </p>
<p>the threat that continues to reside in Iraq”. The way to keep the international community </p>
<p>focused on the problem was to let the inspectors in. The US had not set a new deadline </p>
<p>for compliance and President Bush retained all his options. If Saddam Hussein admitted </p>
<p>inspectors he would be “complying with what he agreed to as his obligation under </p>
<p>UN resolutions”. </p>
<p><b>229. </b> Secretary Powell added:</p>
<p>“The United States still continues to believe as a separate matter that it would be </p>
<p>better to have a different regime in Iraq and as you know, we have supported the </p>
<p>efforts of opposition groups to begin organizing themselves for a change of regime </p>
<p>in due course …</p>
<p>“Regime change would be in the best interest of the Iraqi people. It is a goal of the </p>
<p>United States. But the United Nations’ goal is the inspectors and getting rid of those </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p><b>230. </b> In a separate interview on <i>CNN</i>, Secretary Powell stated that there was “no reason </p>
<p>to believe” that Iraq had not continued its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction or </p>
<p>that it had “abandoned their intent and desire to obtain such systems”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> He observed </p>
<p>that there were different kinds of weapons of mass destruction. The one which was of </p>
<p>“the greatest concern” to him was “what might be happening with respect to biological </p>
<p>weapons because it is much harder to detect that kind of activity”. </p>
<p><b>231. </b> Secretary Powell emphasised that President Bush had “not given away any of his </p>
<p>authority to act in a way he believes is appropriate”. The US had a policy, separate from </p>
<p>UN policy, that “regime change would be good for the Iraqi people, good for the region”. </p>
<p>The US was “trying to find ways to make the Iraqi opposition more effective in this regard”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>352</p>
<p><b>232. </b> Asked if, as Senator Joe Lieberman had suggested, the Iraqi opposition could play </p>
<p>the same role that the Northern Alliance had played in Afghanistan, Secretary Powell </p>
<p>replied that was “not clear yet”. He added that Iraq and Afghanistan were different </p>
<p>countries with different situations and different kinds of military forces. The Northern </p>
<p>Alliance “was a competent military force but needed the support of American air power”. </p>
<p>The Iraqi opposition did “not yet rise to that level”.</p>
<p><b>233.  It has subsequently been made public that President Bush asked for further </b></p>
<p><b>advice on the military plans for Iraq in late November.</b></p>
<p><b>234. </b> General Franks recorded that he was asked on 27 November to give </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld a “Commander’s Concept”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>235. </b> General Franks confirmed with Secretary Rumsfeld on 4 December that the </p>
<p>assumed objective, dependent on the President’s ultimate decision, would be to </p>
<p>“remove the regime of Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p><b>236. </b> President Bush wrote in his memoir that he had asked Secretary Rumsfeld </p>
<p>to review the existing battle plans for Iraq in November 2001, adding: “We needed to </p>
<p>develop the coercive half of coercive diplomacy.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld wrote that when asked about involving the CIA in the planning, </p>
<p>President Bush had said that: </p>
<p>“… he didn’t want me to communicate with people outside DoD for the time being, </p>
<p>and that he would personally talk to Tenet and others at the right moment.”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>238. </b> Asked at what point the most senior levels of the US Administration had settled </p>
<p>on the forcible removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime as their primary objective, </p>
<p>Sir Christopher Meyer told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although he hadn’t realised at the time, the anthrax scare had “really steamed </p>
<p>up the Administration, because they thought the last person who had ever used </p>
<p>anthrax aggressively was Saddam Hussein”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those who had been arguing that “there was a need to settle accounts with </p>
<p>Saddam and do it fast, suddenly got much more traction with the President” </p>
<p>before the end of 2001. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The President himself had been “reinvigorated and found a real purpose </p>
<p>for his Presidency … which had not been evident before 9/11 … Everything </p>
<p>changed after 9/11.”</p>

<p><b>or foreknowledge of, the attacks against the US on 11 September 2001. </b></p>
<p><b>242.  Saddam Hussein had ruled out terrorist attacks for the time being; in  </b></p>

<p><b>was no “credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology and </b></p>

<p><b>244.  Iraq was “capable of constructing devices to disperse chemical or biological </b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>247. </b> The JIC Key Judgements stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“On the basis of the information available … <b>Iraq had no responsibility for, or </b></p>
<p><b>foreknowledge of, the attacks in the US on 11 September </b>… Nor is there any </p>
<p>evidence, or intelligence, of an Iraqi role in the subsequent anthrax attacks.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam has refused to permit any Al Qaida presence in Iraq …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq has long seen terrorism as a potential weapon in its conflict with the US </p>
<p>and regional enemies […] Since September 11, however, <b>Saddam is likely </b></p>
<p><b>to have ruled out such attacks for the time being</b>, for fear of a heavy US </p>
<p>response.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“But in the medium term the threat against Western interests and regional states </p>
<p>remains credible. <b>Saddam has not given up terrorism as a policy tool</b>.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “would consider”:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“the assassination of key oppositionists if he felt threatened, most likely in </p>
<p>the Middle East where there would be a greater chance of success and </p>
<p>deniability …”</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>terrorist attacks on coalition forces and regional allies in the event of a </p>
<p>major US attack which threatened his hold on power; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“WMD terrorism, if his regime was under serious and imminent threat of </p>
<p>collapse. In other circumstances <b>the threat of WMD terrorism is slight</b>, </p>
<p>because of the risk of US retaliation.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>248. </b> Iraq had “provided finance, logistics and training to a range of secular terrorists and </p>
<p>groups” in the 1970s and 1980s, and had “encouraged and sponsored terrorist groups </p>
<p>to mount attacks on coalition targets” during the Gulf Conflict in 1990 to 1991, which </p>
<p>had been “largely ineffective”. Since then, Iraq had been “cautious in pursuing terrorist </p>
<p>attacks abroad, lest it jeopardise the lifting of sanctions”. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> In “recent years”, Saddam Hussein had:</p>
<p>“… expanded his contact with terrorist groups to include Islamic extremists such as </p>
<p>Hamas. In his rhetoric, he has referred more to Islam as he … sought to exploit the </p>
<p>Palestinian issue in his conflict with the US, Kuwait and Saudi. <b>But ideologically he </b></p>
<p><b>is poles apart from the Sunni extremist networks linked to UBL</b>; […] he is wary </p>
<p>of allowing any presence in Iraq for fear of the radicalising effect on the population.”</p>
<p><b>250. </b> The evidence of contact between Iraq and UBL was “fragmentary and </p>
<p>uncorroborated”, including that Iraq had been in contact with Al Qaida for exploratory </p>
<p>discussions on toxic materials in late 1988:</p>
<p>“With common enemies … there was clearly scope for collaboration. </p>
<p>127 </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>3.1  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002</p>
<p>355</p>
<p>“But there is no evidence that these contacts led to practical co-operation; we judge </p>
<p>it unlikely because of mutual mistrust … There is no evidence UBL’s organisation </p>
<p>has ever had a presence in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Since 11 September, Saddam Hussein had “felt under pressure” and “adopted </p>
<p>a low profile”:</p>
<p>“The current US focus on the war against terrorism would make a heavy response </p>
<p>inevitable if Iraq mounted or sponsored a terrorist attack on Western or regional </p>
<p>interests. Iraq would also pay a wider political price, losing the international  </p>
<p>support it derives from sanctions-related propaganda. We assess that <b>Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>is likely to have ruled out any terrorist attacks against the US or its allies for </b></p>
<p><b>the time being</b>.”</p>
<p><b>252. </b> The Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“Although the risks to Iraq have increased, we judge the regime is likely still to see </p>
<p>terrorism as a tool of policy. Saddam may be currently constrained, but he hates the </p>
<p>US and UK, and Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for their continued support to the West. </p>
<p>In the medium term, therefore, the threat to Western and Gulf interests remains </p>
<p>credible. Saddam is an opportunist. We judge he would be willing to use terrorism </p>
<p>if he thought he could gain advantage or exact revenge … without attracting </p>
<p>disproportionate retaliation. Saddam has miscalculated in the past and he could </p>
<p>again misread the response his actions would attract.” </p>
<p><b>253. </b> Addressing what would happen if the US attacked Iraq, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “likely to consider terrorism as one of its few realistic options in </p>
<p>response to a major US attack”. It saw “no need to raise the stakes” in response </p>
<p>to limited coalition action in the NFZs, and the Desert Fox campaign [in </p>
<p>December 1998] was not “sufficiently damaging to justify the risk. But a longer </p>
<p>campaign aimed at regime change could alter Saddam’s calculations.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq would claim attacks against US targets were “acts of self-defence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “also possible that terrorist groups not previously aligned with Iraq would </p>
<p>consider conducting terrorist attacks against the Western ‘aggressors’ …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Overall … unless the Iraqi regime’s hold on power was threatened, it would be </p>
<p>unlikely to undertake or sponsor such terrorist attacks, for fear of provoking a </p>
<p>more severe US response.”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> The Assessment concluded that “Iraqi capability and willingness to conduct </p>
<p><b>WMD terrorism</b>” was “not known with any certainty”. The JIC judged Iraq was “capable </p>
<p>of constructing devices to disperse chemical or biological agent, or radiological material”, </p>
<p>but it had “no reliable intelligence of any Iraqi intent. Nor did it have:</p>
<p>“… any credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related technology and </p>
<p>expertise to terrorist groups, or of any Iraqi role in the anthrax attacks in the US. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>356</p>
<p>Iraq would have to consider the risk of US retaliation … On balance, we judge the </p>
<p><b>threat of Iraqi WMD terrorism is slight</b>, unless the regime was under serious and </p>
<p>imminent threat of collapse.” </p>

<p><b>255. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell drew the report of 26 November from the British Embassy </p>

<p>We ought to have a brainstorming session.”</p>

<p> </p>

<p>129</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), wrote </p>
<p>to Sir David Manning on 27 November, alerting him to a likely discussion about </p>

<p>130</p>
<p> the following week. </p>
<p>He suggested:</p>
<p>“The end of this week would therefore be a very good moment for us to feed our </p>

<p>131</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Copies of the letter were sent to the Private Offices of Mr Straw and Mr Hoon </p>
<p>and to Sir Richard Wilson, Admiral Michael Boyce (Chief of the Defence Staff) and </p>

<p><b>259. </b> On 27 November, Sir David Manning wrote to Mr McKane: “You will now reconvene </p>

<p>132</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>260. </b> In the context of a discussion about Afghanistan on 28 November, Sir David </p>

<p>357</p>
<p><b>262. </b> At the end of November, Mr Powell produced a second note for Mr Blair, ‘Iraq: </p>
<p>Change of Heart or Change of Regime’<i>, </i>which elaborated the points in his earlier note.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Powell identified the “Objectives” as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>Removal of Saddam and replacement by a new, more moderate regime. Ending of </p>
<p>WMD programmes and destruction of stocks. Ending of support for terrorism. Peace </p>
<p>with neighbours.”</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr Powell envisaged a “Plan” comprising diplomatic pressure “followed by </p>
<p>[a] military campaign (without large scale coalition ground forces)”; the insertion of </p>
<p>inspectors which would not, “by itself, be sufficient to stop the campaign” which would </p>
<p>end “only … with the replacement of Saddam”. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr Powell set out three steps:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Using the power of the example of US success in Afghanistan to increase </p>
<p>pressure on Saddam”. There were already signs that he was worried and might </p>
<p>be “prepared to accept return of inspectors if he thinks [the] prospect[s] of attack </p>
<p>are serious”. The US should: “After the fall of Kandahar and the capture of UBL”, </p>
<p>make clear that “Iraq is next (in parallel with action in other countries, e.g. […]).” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “US, UK and others” to “set up” a UN “demand” for the return of inspectors. </p>
<p>If that did not happen, action would be taken. It would be “important not to be </p>
<p>specific” about what the action would comprise nor “to set a deadline”, and </p>
<p>to keep Saddam Hussein guessing. If asked, the reply would be that “regime </p>
<p>change would be desirable, but not our formal objective for the moment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Put in place, a military plan, and if Saddam failed to meet the demands, “there </p>
<p>would be grounds to go ahead with the military plan … [reference to a possible </p>
<p>coup]. Supported by air power and a small numbers of Special Forces in support </p>
<p>roles. Need to be clear with everyone that this time we are going all the way …” </p>
<p>If Saddam Hussein did allow the inspectors in, there would be a “need to find a </p>
<p>new demand to justify military action”.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Powell identified a number of “Conditions”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[N]one of this will work unless we can isolate Saddam further in the international </p>
<p>community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to secure support from Russia, France, the Middle East and Europe.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Making progress “in parallel” on the MEPP. That would be: “Absolutely essential </p>
<p>… or we will be accused – correctly – of double standards.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Mr Powell proposed “Public Lines” comprising:</p>
<p>“Iraq a threat because of WMD capabilities and support of terrorist groups (do not </p>
<p>try to link it to Al Qaida – war is on all international terrorism not just AQ and there is </p>
<p>no convincing proof of AQ involvement with Iraq).</p>
<p>“Demand return of inspectors so can verify dismantling of WMD facilities. Seek  </p>
<p>UN resolution.</p>
<p>“If no return of inspectors will consider what further action …</p>
<p>“Our duty to support rising … Cannot allow him to use terrorism against his own </p>
<p>people once again. Just like Bosnia or Kosovo international community cannot stand </p>
<p>by and watch genocide.”</p>
<p><b>268. </b> Asked about the ideas being considered in late 2001, Mr Powell told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… we didn’t really have a serious discussion of proposals at that stage, or we </p>
<p>weren’t clear, and I jotted down some ideas on a piece of paper which I would rather </p>
<p>forget at the moment, about encouraging people in Iraq to resist, Shi’ites, Sunnis </p>
<p>and military leaders.”</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Asked whether that was an Afghanistan sort of model, Mr Powell replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, it was … but it wasn’t a very serious piece of work and it didn’t go anywhere. </p>
<p>The Prime Minister did me the good grace of not commenting on it.”</p>
<p><b>FCO advice, 3 December 2001</b></p>
<p><b>270. </b> Throughout the autumn, as Sir David Manning told Dr Rice on 28 November, the </p>
<p>UK had been thinking about the next steps in countering international terrorism.</p>
<p><b>271. </b> A FCO minute written in mid-November explained that a counter-terrorism strategy </p>
<p>had been developed following extensive inter-departmental discussion, which identified </p>
<p>the objectives needed “to defeat UBL and his networks”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> It had “evolved from an </p>
<p>initial MOD desire to fit the current military action in Afghanistan into a wider strategy”. </p>
<p>The intention was to draw up “country strategies” to guide efforts in the months ahead.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Iraq was identified as one of more than a dozen countries “which would seem to </p>
<p>merit particular attention”.</p>
<p><b>273.  Following President Bush’s remarks to the press on 26 November 2001, </b></p>
<p><b>the FCO considered the legality of military action against Iraq in November 2001.</b></p>

<p><b>274. </b> Mr John Grainger, an FCO Legal Counsellor in the Middle East Department, wrote </p>
<p>a minute on 27 November, which briefly set out the history of the use of force against </p>
<p>Iraq and the legal basis for it.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> He emphasised that there had not been any significant </p>
<p>decision by the Security Council since 1998 and that caution should be exercised about </p>
<p>relying upon that decision after the expiry of such a long time. Mr Grainger advised that </p>
<p>the UK should take a cautious line in relation to the latest US statements.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> Sir Michael Wood, the FCO Legal Adviser from 1999 to 2006, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that the legality of the use of military force against Iraq had been raised as early as </p>
<p>November 2001 “when President Bush made some kind of statement, which made </p>
<p>it look as though force might be used. So we set out the position immediately.”</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>276.  In response to a request from Mr Blair for advice on the options for dealing </b></p>
<p><b>with Iraq, the FCO proposed “ratcheting up” the policy of containment, including </b></p>
<p><b>pressing Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations and making the </b></p>
<p><b>“red-lines for military action more specific”.</b></p>
<p><b>277.  The FCO warned that the UK could be confronted with an unwelcome </b></p>
<p><b>dilemma of supporting unlawful and widely unpopular action or distancing itself </b></p>
<p><b>from a key US policy.</b></p>
<p><b>278.  A visit to Washington by Sir David Manning would be an opportunity to find </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>360</p>
<p><b>283. </b> Addressing Iraq’s WMD capability, Mr McDonald wrote:</p>
<p>“There is real reason for concern about Iraq’s WMD programmes, principally CBW </p>
<p>and long range missiles. There is evidence of continuing Iraqi attempts to procure </p>
<p>nuclear-related materiel. Saddam’s history of aggression and use of CW sets Iraq </p>
<p>apart from other WMD-armed states. It might be possible to construct a (threadbare) </p>
<p>legal case for military action to deal with the threat. But a new SCR would almost </p>
<p>certainly be needed. And though bombing can degrade missile and even nuclear </p>
<p>capability, it is ineffective against CBW …” </p>
<p><b>284. </b> An Annex to the letter set out the FCO perspective on Iraq’s WMD capabilities and </p>
<p>intentions and Iraq’s response to its obligations. That stated Iraq was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>concealing information about large quantities of chemical and biological </b></p>
<p><b>munitions, agents and precursors. </b>UNSCOM inspectors were unable to </p>
<p>account for [material related to chemical weapons] and very large quantities of </p>
<p>growth media acquired, on Iraq’s own admission, for the production of biological </p>
<p>weapons”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“concealing up to 20 long-range Al Hussein missiles”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>actively pursuing chemical and biological weapons and ballistic missiles</b>. </p>
<p>The missile-related facilities damaged by Operation Desert Fox in 1998 have </p>
<p>been repaired, research continues and new facilities are being constructed. </p>
<p>Other former chemical and biological weapons facilities have been restored: </p>
<p>some CW and BW-relevant activity is under way”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>seeking to rebuild a nuclear weapons programme</b>. Recent intercepted </p>
<p>Iraqi procurement efforts have involved material relevant to production of fissile </p>
<p>material”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“most importantly, <b>barring entry to UNMOVIC and IAEA Action Team </b></p>
<p><b>Inspectors</b>. Iraqi officials have made clear as recently as last week that they </p>
<p>do not intend to cease this obstruction until sanctions are lifted: in defiance of </p>
<p>UNSCRs which repeatedly call for Iraqi compliance to be <i>unconditional</i>.”</p>
<p><b>285. </b> The JIC’s assessment of Iraq’s WMD at that time is addressed in Section 4.1. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> On the way ahead, Mr McDonald wrote: </p>
<p>“A strategy to deal with a WMD threat will require ratcheting up our present policy of </p>
<p>containment. We should press Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations under </p>
<p>the SCRs, accept an intrusive and continuing UN inspection regime and accept </p>
<p>Kuwaiti sovereignty unequivocally.”</p>
<p><b>287. </b> The strategy “could involve” four elements:</p>
<p>“… making previously declared red-lines for military action more specific; by defining </p>
<p>what we meant by reconstitution of WMD and threats to neighbours. </p>

<p>“We could also make more explicit guarantees for Kurdish autonomy now and in any </p>
<p>future Iraq. </p>
<p>“We should encourage and support the Iraqi opposition. </p>
<p>“We could mount a higher profile campaign on the issue of war crimes and consider </p>
<p>the options for an international tribunal to try Saddam and his principal lieutenants.”</p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr McDonald added:</p>
<p>“We could set out a vision of post-Saddam Iraq by deploying a ‘Contract with the </p>
<p>Iraqi People’ on the lines of the attached draft …”</p>
<p><b>289. </b> The background to the proposal for a “Contract with the Iraqi People” is set out in </p>
<p>Section 1.2; the details of the “Contract”, and the subsequent development of a vision for </p>
<p>Iraq, are addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5.</p>
<p><b>290. </b> The letter reviewed discussions with Iraq’s neighbours about curbing illegal oil </p>
<p>imports.</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Mr McDonald concluded:</p>
<p>“Regime change may look an attractive alternative. Removal of Saddam, if achieved </p>
<p>swiftly, would be applauded by his neighbours, the GCC and the wider Arab/Islamic </p>
<p>world. But previous uprisings in 1991 failed for want of outside support and military </p>
<p>intervention for this purpose would be illegal. The US are nevertheless considering </p>
<p>their options again. David Manning’s visit to Washington this week offers the </p>
<p>opportunity to find out what they have in mind, and to test the viability of any plans.” </p>
<p><b>SIS advice</b></p>
<p><b>292.  In parallel, No.10 had also commissioned urgent advice from SIS.</b></p>
<p><b>293.  SIS4 produced three papers, addressing how the UK might divert the US </b></p>
<p><b>from a policy of regime change, a “route map” for pursuing regime change, and </b></p>
<p><b>an analysis of the potential risks and costs were the US to take military action </b></p>
<p><b>against Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>294. </b> On 3 December, Sir Richard Dearlove wrote formally to Sir David Manning </p>
<p>enclosing three “papers”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A paper discussed with SIS4 on 30 November which began: “What can be done </p>
<p>about Iraq? If the US heads for direct action, have we ideas which could divert </p>
<p>them to an alternative course?” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A second paper, ‘Iraq: Further Thoughts’, reflecting discussion at “our meeting on </p>
<p>30 November” of a possible way ahead which combined “an objective of regime </p>
<p>change in Baghdad with the need to protect important regional interests which </p>
<p>would be at grave risk, if a bombing campaign against Iraq was launched in the </p>
<p>short term”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A third paper which offered “some thoughts on the risks and costs of US attacks </p>
<p>on Iraq”.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>295. </b> In the first paper, SIS4 set out the issues that would bear on planning for regime </p>
<p>change in Iraq, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “read across from Afghanistan (cf Richard Perle’s ideas)” was “deceptive”. </p>
<p>The defences of the Iraqi regime were “formidable” and the Tikritis were “not a </p>
<p>bunch of Taliban”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Neighbouring Arab states preferred “the Sunnis” to the Shia “alternative”, and </p>
<p>feared “Kurdish expansionism”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi external opposition groups were “divided, badly penetrated” by Iraqi </p>
<p>intelligence and had “little credibility inside Iraq”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Action against Iraq would undermine the unity of purpose of the war against </p>
<p>terror.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no convincing intelligence (or common sense) case that Iraq </p>
<p>supports Sunni extremism”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “significant fragilities” in the countries neighbouring Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The implications of a “US installed regime in Iraq” for the UK’s regional alliances </p>
<p>were “not at all positive”: “‘Fundamentalism’ would be boosted.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “not clear” that destruction of identified WMD facilities “would do more </p>
<p>than temporarily arrest Iraq’s WMD capabilities”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no identified nuclear target.</p>
<p><b>296. </b> Setting out a “Strategic View”, SIS4 wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Action against Iraq “climbs a steep gradient of complex regional opposition”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>EU co-ordination would be “problematic”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Co-ordination by the Security Council had been “difficult” because of Iraqi </p>
<p>influence on Russia and, to a lesser extent, China.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq policy was “inextricably tied up with the problem of Israel”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Egypt, which was “vital to UK interests in the Middle East” was “vulnerable to </p>
<p>Iraqi influence due to the failure of MEPP”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Maintaining international cohesion against terrorism was “a prior imperative”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “succeeding in eroding sanctions” but isolation was “costing Baghdad </p>
<p>heavily”. Maintaining regional balances, “especially with Iran”, was “a problem </p>
<p>for Saddam”. </p>
<p><b>297. </b> SIS4 told the Inquiry he had been asked to produce the paper that afternoon and </p>
<p>deliver it to No.10.</p>

<p>363</p>
<p><b>298. </b> SIS4 stated that Sir David Manning had asked for:</p>
<p>“A quick paper … of key issues that we need to bear in mind to keep our balance </p>
<p>and our perspective in considering Iraq as a rapidly expanding threat … A sort of </p>
<p>sedative paper …”</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>299. </b> SIS4 stated that the first paper was trying to bring out the hazards about the </p>
<p>experience to date with Iraq if direct action were taken.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>300. </b> SIS4 stated that he had been concerned about:</p>
<p>“… the lack of our response to the re-emergence of Iraq as a serious regional </p>
<p>power … </p>
<p>“I was very alarmed at the way that Iraq was eroding the sanctions regime and </p>
<p>evading it. It had been successful in seeing us off with propaganda since the end </p>
<p>of the first Gulf War … </p>
<p>“… that power and vitality of Iraq were, in my view, a real threat to the stability of </p>
<p>the region.”</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>301. </b> Citing the impact of Iraqi chemical attacks on Iranian troops in the Iran-Iraq War, </p>
<p>SIS4 added that “Iraq’s potential, its capability in the WMD field, was very dramatic”: </p>
<p>“So the idea of putting an end to this problem was not something I would advocate, </p>
<p>but I would see the force of the desire to do it to be decisive.”</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>302. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove could not “recall the exact details” that led to the request </p>
<p>for SIS advice, but he recalled “the circumstances”, which he described as “a sort of </p>
<p>dearth of expertise in the Foreign Office at that sort of level of sophistication, and I’m </p>
<p>pretty sure that this initiative comes out of me, David [Manning] and [SIS4] talking </p>
<p>amongst each other”.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>303. </b> Sir Richard described the papers as “catalysts” to stimulate thinking; and </p>
<p>emphasised that they had “no status as official papers at all”.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Sir David Manning was unable to recall the circumstances in which he had </p>
<p>requested advice from SIS4 on 30 November, although he postulated that it was </p>
<p>a reflection of SIS4’s expertise.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>305. </b> Sir David pointed out that the discussion of regime change at that stage was about </p>
<p>fomenting regime change within Iraq, not about an invasion.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>364</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Although the covering letter from Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Office described </p>
<p>the second paper as “an expansion” of the first, the paper drew on SIS4’s discussion </p>
<p>with Sir David Manning about a “possible way ahead”.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>307. </b> Addressing the question “Why Move?”, SIS4 wrote:</p>
<p>“The removal of Saddam remains a prize because it could give new security to oil </p>
<p>supplies; engage a powerful and secular state in the fight against Sunni extremist </p>
<p>terror, open political horizons in the GCC [Gulf Co-operation Council] states, remove </p>
<p>a threat to Jordan/Israel, undermine the regional logic on WMD. The major challenge </p>
<p>would be managing the regional reintegration of Iraq, without damaging important </p>
<p>local relationships. Working for regime change could be a dynamic process of </p>
<p>alliance building which could effect climatic change in the Arab-Israeli conflict.”</p>
<p><b>308. </b> SIS4 proposed a “new route map” where the key idea was that it would be </p>
<p>“possible to speak openly about support for regime change in Iraq without compromising </p>
<p>the actual project to support a coup”. He suggested a “policy statement: <b>we want </b></p>
<p><b>regime change in Baghdad and we are ready to provide air support to coup </b></p>
<p><b>makers</b>”. The latter would “need to be Sunnis ready to abide by UN resolutions”.</p>
<p><b>309. </b> SIS4 made a number of other observations, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“To meet US impatience a 12-18 month timeframe should be imposed.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “a serious problem” with the legality of supporting coup makers.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The message to key partners should include “assurances” that the approach </p>
<p>was “going to be balanced, studied, planned and proportionate – better than </p>
<p>bombing now”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Examination of the interests affected and “means to compensate” them – </p>
<p>“especially Turkey, Iran and Syria”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Consideration of “international participation” in the military “task force”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Legal examination of Iraqi liabilities and draft arrangements to manage them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Promotion of serious <b>debate</b> within the region on <b>WMD</b>: costs and </p>
<p>responsibilities.” </p>
<p><b>310. </b> Setting out “Our Aims for the Region”, SIS4 wrote that there were:</p>
<p>“… two further aims: climatic change in the psychology of regimes in the region, </p>
<p>a pre-condition for progress in the Arab-Israel dispute … The problem of WMD </p>
<p>is an element in driving for action in Iraq. In turn, this should open prospects for </p>
<p>Arab-Israeli talks, and, beyond, regional work to reduce the WMD inventories which </p>
<p>threaten Europe as well.”</p>

<p>3.1  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002</p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>311. </b> SIS4 confirmed that the second paper he had produced was:</p>
<p>“… about managing the paradox of working hard for regime change, communicating </p>
<p>in secret, and being able to communicate to the world and to the Iraqi population in </p>
<p>the hope maybe of precipitating local Iraqi help, without compromising that core and </p>
<p>secret effort.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>312. </b> Asked about his view that it would be important not to parachute a regime in from </p>
<p>the external opposition, and that: “The new government would need to be broadly based </p>
<p>but predominantly Sunni”, SIS4 replied: </p>
<p>“… the people being toppled were Ba’athists, who were culturally Sunni … but being </p>
<p>a Ba’athist wasn’t co-extensive with being Sunni. There were a lot of Sunnis in Iraq </p>
<p>who would have liked Iraq to be run differently. </p>
<p>“I don’t think at this time it occurred to me that it was plausible to transfer an </p>
<p>adversarial, party political, representational political system to Iraq. </p>
<p>“… The idea that Iraqi Shias could be fitted out with Republican, Democrat, Lib Dem </p>
<p>identities, organisations and run the difficult place which is Iraq, a place which has </p>
<p>never had stable political geography, wouldn’t have occurred to me in 2001.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>313. </b> Asked about the second paper, a “new route map”, which stated that the </p>
<p>Government Law Officers were going to have to provide assurances of legality, and that </p>
<p>there had been a serious problem there, SIS4 replied: </p>
<p>“… I can’t honestly tell you what particular thought was in my mind there. I’m not </p>
<p>aware of any discussions of the legality …”</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>314. </b> The third paper was a companion piece to the second, providing an expanded </p>
<p>analysis of the risks and costs of US attacks on Iraq in four categories:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Strategic</b>” – including increased distrust of the US and damage to confidence </p>
<p>in HMG; serious strain on the coalition against terrorism; and reinforcing the </p>
<p>motives and grievances of terrorists.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>United Nations</b>” – including erosion of UN sanctions and renewed splits in the </p>
<p>Security Council.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Regional</b>” – including resentment in the Arab street and popular pressure </p>
<p>on regional regimes; an increase in radical Islamist extremism; a boost to the </p>
<p>Intifada and damage to the MEPP; threats to the stability of key allies; and </p>
<p>reduction of support for operation of the No-Fly Zones. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<b>Iraq Internal</b>” – including the division of Iraq and the possibility that Saddam </p>

<p><b>315. </b> SIS4 also stated that the outcomes of a bombing campaign would be “both </p>
<p>uncertain and hard to control”.</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the first paper he had received was the FCO advice  </p>
<p>on options.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> While it “concluded there were no anti-terrorist grounds” for military  </p>
<p>action against Iraq, that was because “we saw no link between Iraq and Al Qaida”.  </p>
<p>It did not “deal with the point, however, that post September 11th WMD” had taken  </p>
<p>on “a different significance”. Mr Blair also referred to the details of Iraq’s capabilities and </p>
<p>its concealment activities as “not exactly … reassuring”. </p>
<p><b>317. </b> Addressing the papers provided by SIS4, Mr Blair stated that one had pointed </p>
<p>out that getting regime change would be “very, very difficult … so watch out”, and </p>
<p>another had argued: “On the other hand, leaving him [Saddam] there is also very, very </p>
<p>difficult.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> Those two views remained. </p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Blair added that he thought that one of the papers said “by implication you </p>
<p>cannot stop the WMD programme unless you actually remove Saddam”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>319. </b> The papers produced by SIS4 did not address whether regime change was  </p>
<p>a prerequisite for stopping Iraq’s WMD programmes. That was the conclusion of  </p>

<p><b>335.  Mr Blair suggested a strategy for regime change in Iraq that would build over </b></p>

<p><b>336. </b> Mr Blair sent President Bush a paper ‘The War against Terrorism: The Second </p>

<p>moderate Muslim states.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> In relation to Iraq, the key points were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was a threat because: “it has WMD capability; is acquiring more; has shown </p>
<p>its willingness to use it; and can export that capability”. Iraq was in breach of </p>
<p>UN Security Council resolutions 687 (1991), 715 (1991) and 1284 (1999) and </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein supported certain Palestinian terrorist groups and used terror </p>
<p>tactics against Iraqi dissidents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any link to 11 September and AQ was “at best very tenuous”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although “people want to be rid of Saddam”, international opinion “outside the  </p>
<p>US/UK” would “at present” be “reluctant” to support immediate military action.</p>

<p>3.1  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002</p>
<p>369</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Mr Blair suggested that a “strategy for regime change that builds over time” was </p>
<p>needed: “until we get to the point where military action could be taken if necessary” </p>
<p>without losing international support and “facing a choice between massive intervention </p>
<p>and nothing”. That might comprise six elements.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> The first was “Softening up” opinion by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing attention to Saddam’s breach of UN resolutions; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>saying that regime change was “desirable”, but “not yet setting it as a military </p>
<p>objective”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>signalling willingness to support opposition groups; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building a regional coalition against Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demanding the return of weapons inspectors “without specifying military action if </p>
<p>the demand is not met, we let it be clearly seen that nothing is ruled out. But our </p>
<p>time frame is deliberately vague.” </p>
<p><b>341. </b> Mr Blair commented that that would be “presentationally difficult”: </p>
<p>“We need to be very precise to avoid getting drawn into threats we are not yet ready </p>
<p>to implement. But we would be unsettling Saddam; possibly forcing concessions out </p>
<p>of him … and giving ourselves room for manoeuvre.” </p>
<p>In the meantime, the US and UK would “continue to enforce the No-Fly Zones on a more </p>
<p>intensive basis”.</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The other elements suggested by Mr Blair were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Applying “real pressure on Syria to stop the flow of Iraqi oil by closing the oil </p>
<p>pipeline”, clamping down on “Saddam’s illegal financial transactions”, and </p>
<p>helping Jordan. Turkey would also need to stop illegal oil imports.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bringing “Russia on board, by ensuring their financial interests don’t suffer </p>
<p>adversely”. Withdrawal of Russian support would have a very negative impact </p>
<p>on Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Supporting “opposition groups” and setting out an agenda for post-Saddam Iraq </p>
<p>(the FCO’s ‘Contract with the Iraqi People’).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mounting “covert operations” in support of those “with the ability to topple </p>
<p>Saddam”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“When the rebellion finally occurs we back it militarily.” That included air support </p>
<p>and support for uprisings. Mr Blair wrote: “What everyone in Iraq and around </p>
<p>fears is that we will start this action but not finish it. They need to know, and </p>
<p>we need to be clear, that if an uprising occurs, we are willing to act militarily </p>
<p>in support.” </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>370</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Summarising his position, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“So: my strategy is to build this over time until we get to the point where military </p>
<p>action could be taken if necessary; but meanwhile bring people towards us, </p>
<p>undermine Saddam, without so alarming people about the immediacy of action </p>
<p>that we frighten the horses, lose Russia and/or half the EU and nervous Arab states </p>
<p>and find ourselves facing a choice between massive intervention and nothing.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Addressing Syria and Iran, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“If toppling Saddam is a prime objective, it is far easier to do it with Syria and Iran in </p>
<p>favour or acquiescing rather than hitting all three at once. I favour giving these two a </p>
<p>chance at a different relationship … in return for closing down support for Hizbollah </p>
<p>and Hamas and helping us over Iraq. I don’t underestimate the problems … but </p>
<p>I think it is possible …” </p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Blair also identified the dangers in any action of “unintended consequences” for </p>
<p>international support. He added that the outcome of Afghanistan would be important to </p>
<p>Phase 2. If Afghanistan was left as a:</p>
<p>“… better country, having supplied humanitarian aid and having given new hope to </p>
<p>the people, we will not just have won militarily but morally; and the coalition will back </p>
<p>us to do more elsewhere. In particular, we shall have given regime change a good </p>
<p>name, which will help us in the argument over Iraq. So in my view, the political and </p>
<p>diplomatic must always be reinforcing the military.” </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Mr Blair drew attention to the need to put the Middle East Peace Process “back on </p>
<p>track” or it would “complicate everything”.</p>
<p><b>347. </b> Finally, Mr Blair suggested that the US and UK should be working with Pakistan, </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries “on a strategy for confronting Islamic </p>
<p>fundamentalism and extremism”.</p>
<p><b>348.  Sir David Manning delivered the paper to the US. </b></p>
<p><b>349.  Following discussions in Washington, Sir David reported that the US </b></p>
<p><b>Administration was “open to Mr Blair’s ideas”, and that the discussions  </b></p>
<p><b>“had been worth the journey”.</b></p>
<p><b>350.  Sir David also advised that there was a need to “make more of the WMD </b></p>
<p><b>menace presented by Saddam”.</b></p>
<p><b>351. </b> Following talks in Washington, at which Sir Richard Dearlove had also been </p>
<p>present, Sir David Manning reported that he had taken Dr Rice through Mr Blair’s paper, </p>
<p>including the “vital need” for progress on the MEPP.</p>

<p>371</p>
<p><b>352. </b> On Iraq, Sir David reported that the US was conducting a full review of the options. </p>
<p>The US had been reviewing the possibilities before 9/11, but the attacks had given the </p>
<p>process new urgency. He had stated that:</p>
<p>“… Saddam would only be overthrown if there was a strategy which co-ordinated </p>
<p>work on all aspects of the problem. We should be patient. We must prepare very </p>
<p>carefully, even if Saddam felt the net tightening. We should do it right rather than </p>
<p>do it quickly.”</p>
<p><b>353. </b> In the context of a discussion about what had changed since 1991, including the </p>
<p>availability of precision weapons and Saddam’s “new WMD capabilities”, Sir David </p>
<p>wrote: </p>
<p>“We should make more of the WMD menace presented by Saddam: people were  </p>
<p>far more sensitive to the dangers after what we had discovered in Afghanistan.  </p>
<p>And we should take the time and trouble to maintain the support of the coalition that </p>
<p>we had worked so hard to build. The moderate Arabs were impressed by our swift </p>
<p>and successful conduct of the Afghan campaign … They were also united in loathing </p>
<p>Saddam. If we contrived his initial overthrow, with outside support, they might stick </p>
<p>with us.” </p>
<p><b>354. </b> Sir David concluded that the discussions “had been worth the journey” and that it </p>
<p>seemed the thinking “at the top level of the Administration” was “very close” to Mr Blair’s. </p>
<p>The Administration was “open to Mr Blair’s ideas”. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> Sir David suggested that Mr Blair should talk to President Bush and propose </p>
<p>a US/UK group to “take the Iraq issue forward together”. At the request of the US, </p>
<p>the discussions would need to be “extremely tightly held, involving only No.10/SIS/</p>

<p><b>360. </b> Mr Jonathan Powell told the Inquiry that when Sir David Manning returned from </p>
<p>Washington, he had reported that Dr Rice had assured him that the Administration had </p>
<p>“no immediate plans for action in Iraq”.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>361. </b> In a minute on 10 December, the FCO Counter-Terrorism Policy Department </p>

<p>“We have dropped plans to produce a paper on … Iraq, as our objectives there are </p>
<p>better pursued in different ways.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>362. </b> In a meeting with Secretary Powell in London on 11 December, Mr Blair repeated </p>
<p>his view that “we needed a clever strategy to deal with Saddam”; and identified the </p>
<p>important consequences of success in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke on 11 December but there is no mention of Iraq </p>
<p>or Phase 2 of the war on terrorism in the record of the discussion.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Asked what he had said to President Bush, Mr Blair replied: </p>
<p>“… when you get to my conversation with President Bush … I am saying to him </p>
<p>‘Look, we are going to have to deal with this issue. We accept that. After September </p>
<p>11, the calculus of risk has changed and changed fundamentally. We cannot allow </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein to be in breach of UN resolutions.’</p>
<p>“So I am signalling that I am up for the policy of handling and dealing with this issue </p>
<p>and we are going to be with America in doing that. </p>
<p>“We then I think from memory had a discussion about all sorts of different aspects </p>
<p>of that and how it might be done … I was in no doubt it would be beneficial for the </p>
<p>world to get rid of Saddam Hussein and to get rid of his regime.”</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“On the other hand, I was saying ‘This is going to be difficult precisely because of </p>
<p>the things listed in the paper from the SIS officer’. Those were:</p>

<p>The lack of response to the re-emergence of Iraq as a serious regional </p>

<p>it sequentially …’ That was not my view.”</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Asked whether he had agreed with the advice in the FCO letter of 3 December, </p>
<p>to ratchet up containment and steering away from the idea of supporting uprisings, </p>
<p>let alone military intervention for the purposes of regime change, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… they were not quite saying that. What they were saying was, ‘… there is a policy </p>

<p><b>372. </b> Reporting a discussion with Mr Peter Mandelson on 4 December, who wanted </p>
<p>background information on Iraq for use in speaking engagements on Middle East </p>
<p>issues, Mr McKane recorded that Mr Mandelson had been “particularly interested in </p>
<p>the prospects for effective action to unseat Saddam Hussein”.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> Mr McKane reported </p>
<p>that he had “pointed out the legal position, and also the difficulties in finding an effective </p>
<p>strategy, whether military or otherwise, to deal effectively with Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>373. </b> In response to a question about other targets for coalition action in Phase 2, </p>
<p>Mr McKane reported that he had “sketched out in general terms” the links between </p>
<p>Usama Bin Laden and Islamic extremists in other countries. </p>
<p><b>374.  On 5 December, Mr Straw emphasised the need for Iraq to meet the </b></p>
<p><b>obligations imposed by the UN, including the re-admission of weapons </b></p>
<p><b>inspectors. </b></p>
<p><b>375. </b> On 5 December, in a debate in Parliament on the Middle East, following terrorist </p>
<p>attacks in Israel, Mr Dalyell asked whether the Government was “doing everything </p>
<p>possible to deter certain Americans from the folly of attacking Iraq”.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> Mr Straw </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“… The key to Iraq coming back into the civilised world is for Iraq to implement </p>
<p>the undertakings imposed on it by the … Security Council resolutions, including </p>
<p>the re-admission of weapons inspectors. I say strongly … that Iraq continues </p>
<p>to pose a very serious threat to Arab states, as well as to the state of Israel, by </p>
<p>its continued unlawful development of weapons of mass destruction.”</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Asked if the UK took the same view as President Bush that UN inspectors must </p>
<p>return to Iraq, Mr Straw told the Foreign Affairs Committee on 5 December:</p>
<p>“Yes. Saddam Hussein is the architect of the misfortunes of the Iraqi people … </p>
<p>Iraq poses a very severe threat in terms of its development and possible use of </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction, of that there can be no doubt. Therefore restraining </p>
<p>the development of those weapons … is essential, and to do that we require proper </p>
<p>inspection.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Straw added that the UK had “been in the lead in the United Nations on seeking </p>
<p>… a more effective replacement, of … resolution 1284”. The new sanctions regime might </p>
<p>“With luck” be in place in six months. That would allow the export of goods to Iraq for </p>
<p>civilian use for humanitarian and other purposes, and “more effectively interdict material </p>
<p>which is either for military use for weapons of mass destruction, certain conventional </p>
<p>weapons, or of dual use”.</p>

<p><b>378. </b> Asked whether Iraq could be persuaded to permit the return of inspectors “without </p>
<p>an intensification of military action”, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“… I would not use the verb persuade. I see some prospect of Iraq coming to accept </p>
<p>that this has to happen for the future of the regime as well as the future of the people </p>
<p>in that country. I would not put it higher than that but I think there is some evidence </p>
<p>to that effect.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“There certainly has to be an intensification of diplomatic pressure … it requires </p>
<p>more active engagement, for example by Russia … and a recognition … that what </p>
<p>has been an ambiguous approach to Iraq … is not helpful in terms of the stability </p>

<p><b>379. </b> Asked if he thought the rights under the UN Charter extended “to taking </p>

<p>replied that all states had a right to self-defence and he was not going to be “drawn </p>
<p>into hypothetical answers to hypothetical questions of the ‘what if’ variety”. If a country </p>
<p>received “very good information” that it was about to be attacked it could take action in </p>
<p>self defence consistent with Article 51 of the UN Charter, but the exact circumstances </p>
<p>would vary. </p>

<p>ballistic missile capability and that it was “possibly developing chemical, biological, </p>
<p>maybe even nuclear weapons” and what might happen next after Afghanistan,  </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“… You are right to say that Iraq’s building of weapons of mass destruction is a </p>
<p>very serious potential threat to the peace and stability of the region and, therefore, </p>
<p>to the whole of the international community … [and] to imply that the international </p>
<p>community has to take action. There is then a question of what action is best taken </p>
<p>in respect of that where care and consideration is required. This is a separate matter </p>
<p>to culpability for the atrocities of 11 September … but we are … very concerned, </p>
<p>about Iraq’s development of these weapons. We believe that international action  </p>
<p>has to take place and I have talked already about the dramatic steps which have to </p>

<p>on the work commissioned by the MOD following the attacks on 11 September.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Hoon set out five approaches the Armed Forces might take in countering the threat </p>
<p>outside the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preventing the conditions that allowed international terrorist organisations to </p>
<p>operate, including peace support operations to prevent instability or to assist in </p>
<p>stabilisation of states which did not have the means to exercise control over their </p>
<p>own territory;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deterring attacks including:</p>
<p>–  </p>
<p>considering “setting out more clearly and repeatedly our views on holding </p>
<p>to account regimes which directly support international terrorist groups, or </p>
<p>condone their presence within their borders”; and</p>
<p>–  </p>
<p>looking “at how we deter the use of chemical, biological and radiological </p>
<p>weapons as well as nuclear weapons and, importantly, dissuade those who </p>
<p>facilitate the proliferation of such weapons”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>coercion of regimes and states which harboured or supported international </p>
<p>terrorism “with the threat and, ultimately, the use of, military force in the event </p>
<p>that diplomatic and other means fail”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>active disruption of activities supporting international terrorist groups; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>destroying terrorist cells “and, perhaps in the last instance, to act against </p>
<p>regimes such as the Taliban” which supported and protected terrorists. </p>
<p><b>The perspective in the US, December 2001</b></p>
<p><b>381. </b> On 6 December, <i>The Washington Post</i> reported the text of a letter sent to </p>
<p>President Bush by Senators McCain, Lieberman, Holmes and Lott, amongst others, </p>
<p>arguing that “as we work to clean up Afghanistan and destroy Al Qaida, it is imperative </p>
<p>that we plan to eliminate the threat from Iraq”, suggesting that the US “must directly </p>
<p>confront Saddam, sooner rather than later”.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>382. </b> The letter stated: </p>
<p>“We cannot be drawn into the ethnic politics of any particular nation, but should </p>
<p>find a way to work with all the opposition in a unified framework. The Iraqi National </p>
<p>Congress is the only umbrella organisation comprising all elements of the Iraqi </p>
<p>opposition. No one group is excluded, no one group is favoured … All indications are </p>
<p>that in the interest of our own national security, Saddam Hussein must be removed </p>
<p>from power.” </p>

<p>3.1  |  Development of UK strategy and options, 9/11 to early January 2002</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>383. </b> Mr Kevin Tebbit, the MOD Permanent Under Secretary, visited Washington from </p>
<p>5 to 7 December 2001 where his meetings with a range of contacts included discussions </p>
<p>on Afghanistan and the next stage of the war against terrorism.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>384. </b> Reporting to Mr Hoon on the visit, Mr Tebbit stated that Washington saw itself as </p>
<p>being on a “war footing” and “the focus on international terrorism remains intense”.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That focus influenced “the US attitude and approach to the rest of the agenda”. In his </p>
<p>view that meant: </p>
<p>“UK views are listened to, like nobody else’s; all doors are open (but it doesn’t mean </p>
<p>that we can easily get our way or secure our interests); </p>
<p>“… if we want our advice to be heeded on general pol/mil [political/military] issues, </p>
<p>we need to place it in the context of counter-terrorism post 11 September … </p>
<p>everything needs to relate back to the war in some way if we are to catch their ear; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>“… there is a widespread and bipartisan sense, extending well beyond Administration </p>
<p>‘hawks’ that Iraq will need to be dealt with sooner rather than later. This rationale </p>
<p>is not quite as simplistic as we like to think. They do not suspect Saddam of </p>
<p>complicity in 11 September. But they regard it as all too likely that he will make WMD </p>
<p>available to terrorist groups without much warning. Our success in dissuading the </p>
<p>Administration from military action without proper political and diplomatic preparation </p>
<p>(though there was no sense that a military move was imminent) will depend on our </p>
<p>ability to engage constructively on the strategy and tactics.”</p>
<p><b>385. </b> The report was also sent to the FCO, Sir Christopher Meyer, and to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning. </p>
<p><b>386. </b> While Mr Tebbit was in Washington, an attempt was made by a senior Republican </p>
<p>close to the Pentagon to persuade him that the Iraqi National Congress could be a </p>
<p>force to be reckoned with sufficient to cause an Iraqi response and enable the US to </p>
<p>take supportive military action. Mr Tebbit commissioned an analysis of that thesis which </p>
<p>he expected would “show it to be flawed”.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>387. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that the desire in the US State Department was </p>
<p>to move down the UN track, but the mood in Secretary Rumsfeld’s Office was “much </p>
<p>tougher”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> Mr Richard Perle, Chairman of the Defence Advisory Board, whom Sir Kevin </p>
<p>regarded as one of the “most influential figures” on Secretary Rumsfeld’s thinking, was </p>
<p>“very clearly talking of trying to encourage a sort of Northern Alliance of Iraq”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>378</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Sir Kevin confirmed he considered Mr Perle’s thinking to be “flawed” and that the </p>
<p>UK had not been challenging it sufficiently strongly.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>389. </b> The MOD subsequently concluded that there was “no Northern Alliance equivalent </p>
<p>… who could take advantage of precision bombing” in Iraq.</p>

<p><b>391.  Sir Richard Dearlove advised No.10 at the end of December that it would be </b></p>
<p><b>very much in the Government’s interest to work with the US and that the outcome </b></p>
<p><b>of US thinking would be of “enormous significance” to the national interest.</b></p>
<p><b>392. </b> Following the discussion in Washington on 5 December, Sir Richard Dearlove </p>
<p>asked SIS4 and SIS7 to hold follow up talks on Iraq.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> He reported the outcome of the </p>
<p>talks to Sir David Manning on 27 December, with details of the discussions between </p>
<p>SIS and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).</p>
<p><b>393. </b> SIS4 had suggested a “middle ground” option should be examined. That would be </p>
<p>to create conditions within Iraq which, with air support, could act as a catalyst for a coup </p>
<p>which would bring Saddam Hussein down within the next one to two years.</p>
<p><b>394. </b> Sir Richard advised that the outcome of US thinking was likely to be “an intelligent </p>
<p>and co-ordinated push for regime change, but a more aggressive military campaign </p>
<p>cannot be ruled out”. If it were the former, the US would look for UK support. There </p>
<p>had been no discussion about what the US would expect from the UK in the event of </p>
<p>a military campaign.</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Sir Richard suggested that if a US policy decision went “the right way” he believed </p>
<p>that it would be:</p>
<p>“… very much in HMG’s interest to work with the Americans. We have a contribution </p>
<p>to make and the outcome is of enormous significance for our national interest.”</p>
<p><b>396. </b> As Section 3.2 shows, Mr Straw does not seem to have been informed of SIS </p>
<p>discussions with the US until 19 February 2002.</p>
<p><b>397.  While Sir David Manning had confirmed in early December that the US was </b></p>
<p><b>conducting a full review of all its options, there are no indications that the UK was </b></p>
<p><b>aware that President Bush had specifically commissioned General Franks to look </b></p>
<p><b>at military options for removing Saddam Hussein; and that that would include </b></p>
<p><b>options for a conventional land invasion. </b></p>

<p><b>398. </b> General Franks visited Crawford on 28 December 2001 to brief President Bush on </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> Other members of the national security team were linked by video to the briefing. </p>
<p>General Franks informed President Bush that the plan on the shelf required a six month </p>
<p>build up and 400,000 troops; he was looking at whether as a result of lessons from </p>
<p>Afghanistan fewer conventional ground forces would be needed. He had “envisioned a </p>
<p>fast invasion from Kuwait in the south, Saudi Arabia and Jordan in the west, and Turkey </p>
<p>in the north”. </p>
<p><b>399. </b> Secretary Rumsfeld recorded that General Franks’ plan called for “an invasion </p>
<p>force of 145,000 … which would be increased to 275,000 if and as needed”.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>400. </b> The report from the US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, </p>
<p><i>Hard Lessons</i>, stated that the concept of operations briefed to President Bush had </p>
<p>been devised in four video conferences between Thanksgiving (22 November 2001) </p>
<p>and late December 2001. It focused chiefly on the combat phase and “anticipated </p>
<p>a rapid post war handoff to a provisional Iraqi government and a minimal continuing </p>
<p>military footprint”.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>401. </b> President Bush wrote that after the 28 December briefing he had “asked the team </p>
<p>to keep working on the plan”, while observing that:</p>
<p>“… we should remain optimistic that diplomacy and international pressure will </p>
<p>succeed in disarming the regime … But we cannot allow weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction to fall into the hands of terrorists. I will not allow that to happen.”</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>402. </b> General Franks wrote that he gave a further briefing on the developing plan </p>
<p>to President Bush and US Principals on 7 February 2002, in which he identified the </p>

<p>193</p>
<p> The prospects for agreement on implementation of resolution </p>
<p>1284 (i.e. the return of weapons inspectors) were “slim”. There was a continued </p>
<p>discussion about whether the introduction of the GRL should take place before, or in </p>

<p>380</p>
<p><b>404. </b> Sir David Manning and Sir Richard Dearlove visited Washington again on </p>
<p>21 January 2002.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>405. </b> In relation to discussions on Iraq, Sir David reported that there was an expectation </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein would “make a display of renewed co-operation” in the coming </p>
<p>weeks. That would “probably include some kind of offer on inspections”. The US would </p>
<p>“resist sham inspections” which took the pressure off Saddam Hussein and “did nothing </p>
<p>to further our interests”. One senior US individual had suggested that it would be easier </p>
<p>if Saddam Hussein “remained completely obdurate so that we were not faced with </p>
<p>predictable arguments about giving him another chance”. That was “just what he wanted”.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Sir David added that the US Administration’s “view remained that we should be </p>
<p>pushing ahead for regime change”. He had said that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… favoured regime change but wanted a carefully constructed strategy. We must </p>
<p>not rush in and fail. It seemed to me very unlikely that we would be in a position </p>
<p>to take serious action before Saddam made a move on inspectors. We would have </p>
<p>to factor this in.” </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Sir David reported that the timing of a strategy for dealing with Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was vague and there was “no sign that Washington has a clear plan that would allow </p>
<p>early action”. Any UK contribution would need Mr Blair’s endorsement and “might have </p>
<p>to be processed through the Attorney”. The US and UK would look at options. There </p>
<p>were some doubts about whether a strategy for regime change would be viable.</p>
<p><b>408. </b> Sir David Manning told the Inquiry that the visit took place:</p>
<p>“… in the knowledge that Iraq had been the subject of considerable debate </p>
<p>in Washington … and I recall saying to Dr Rice that if there was a review … </p>
<p>it would certainly … have to include the whole question of how to incorporate </p>
<p>inspections …”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that Sir David had told Dr Rice that the UK would need </p>
<p>the advice of the Attorney General before any action at any stage would be possible.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Following a visit to Baghdad by Mr Amre Moussa, the Secretary General of the </p>
<p>Arab League, on 18 and 19 January, Mr John Sawers, British Ambassador to Egypt, </p>
<p>reported that Mr Moussa had told him Saddam Hussein had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>shown “the seeds of flexibility” during the visit and professed a desire to re-open </p>
<p>a dialogue with Mr Annan, without pre-conditions and with an open agenda, </p>

<p>197</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Mr Powell drew the telegram to Mr Blair’s attention, commenting:</p>

<p>regime change instead of inspectors.”</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Blair responded: “We shd keep up the pressure.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>413.  After the attacks on the US on 9/11, which was widely accepted as having </b></p>
<p><b>changed the nature of the threat and the way in which Governments should </b></p>
<p><b>address calculations about the risks being faced, Mr Blair declared that the </b></p>
<p><b>UK would stand “shoulder to shoulder” with the US to defeat and eradicate </b></p>
<p><b>international terrorism. </b></p>
<p><b>414.  Throughout the autumn of 2001, Mr Blair took an active and leading role in </b></p>
<p><b>building a coalition to act against that threat, including military action against </b></p>
<p><b>Al Qaida and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. He also emphasised the potential </b></p>
<p><b>risk of terrorists acquiring and using a nuclear, biological or chemical weapon, </b></p>
<p><b>and the dangers of inaction.</b></p>
<p><b>415.  In November 2001, the JIC assessed that Iraq had played no role in the </b></p>
<p><b>9/11 attacks on the US and that practical co-operation between Iraq and Al Qaida </b></p>
<p><b>was unlikely. There was no credible evidence of covert transfers of WMD-related </b></p>
<p><b>technology and expertise to terrorist groups. It was possible that Iraq might use </b></p>
<p><b>WMD in terrorist attacks, but only if the regime was under serious and imminent </b></p>
<p><b>threat of collapse. </b></p>
<p><b>416.  In relation to Iraq, Mr Blair sought to influence US policy and prevent </b></p>
<p><b>precipitate military action by the US which would undermine the success </b></p>
<p><b>of the coalition which had been established for action against international </b></p>
<p><b>terrorism. He recommended identifying an alternative policy which would </b></p>
<p><b>command widespread international support. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>417.  While recognising the difficulties, the UK continued actively to pursue the </b></p>
<p><b>policy framework agreed earlier in 2001 of strengthening the policy of containing </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq, through a revised and more targeted sanctions regime and seeking Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>agreement to the return of inspectors as required by resolution 1284 (1999). </b></p>
<p><b>418.  The adoption of resolution 1382 (2001) went some way towards that </b></p>
<p><b>objective. But support for economic sanctions was eroding and whether Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>would ever agree to re-admit weapons inspectors and allow them to operate </b></p>
<p><b>without obstruction was in doubt.</b></p>
<p><b>419.  Following President Bush’s remarks on 26 November, there were renewed </b></p>
<p><b>UK concerns that US attention was turning towards military action on Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>420.  Mr Blair’s discussion with President Bush on 3 December and the paper he </b></p>
<p><b>sent to President Bush the following day represented a significant development </b></p>
<p><b>of the UK’s approach. Mr Blair suggested a “clever strategy” for regime change </b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq that built over time, until the point was reached where “military action </b></p>
<p><b>could be taken if necessary”, without losing international support.</b></p>
<p><b>421.  Mr Blair also emphasised the threat which Iraq might pose in the future, </b></p>
<p><b>which remained a key part his position in the months that followed.</b></p>
<p><b>422.  Mr Blair was offering President Bush the UK’s support in an effort to </b></p>
<p><b>influence his decisions on Iraq while seeking to devise a strategy which would </b></p>
<p><b>command international support. </b></p>
<p><b>423.  The proposals represented a significant departure from the UK’s previous </b></p>
<p><b>approach. In essence the strategy entailed renewed demands for Iraq to comply </b></p>
<p><b>with the obligations imposed by the Security Council and the re-admission of </b></p>
<p><b>weapons inspectors, and a readiness to respond firmly if Saddam Hussein failed </b></p>
<p><b>to comply. </b></p>
<p><b>424.  The strategy had multiple diplomatic strands and Mr Blair did not, at </b></p>
<p><b>that stage, have a ground invasion of Iraq or immediate military action of any </b></p>
<p><b>sort in mind. But he did state that when a rebellion occurred, the US and UK </b></p>
<p><b>should “back it militarily”. That was the first step towards a policy of possible </b></p>
<p><b>intervention in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>425.  There is no evidence of any formal consideration of the detailed terms of </b></p>
<p><b>the strategy for Iraq Mr Blair proposed to President Bush, which went beyond the </b></p>
<p><b>strategy proposed by the FCO, or its potential implications.</b></p>
<p><b>426.  The paper Mr Blair sent to President Bush on 4 December was not seen in </b></p>
<p><b>advance by Mr Straw or Mr Hoon although it was sent to them subsequently. </b></p>
<p><b>427.  A number of issues, including the legal basis for any military action, would </b></p>
<p><b>need to be resolved as part of developing the “clever strategy”.</b></p>
