<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>570</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses analysis and findings in relation to the evidence set out in </p>
<p>Section 13.1, on the allocation of resources for military operations and civilian activities </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address how government departments used the resources </p>
<p>available to them. Specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of military equipment is considered in Sections 6.3 and 14; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s support for reconstruction is considered in Section 10; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s support for Security Sector Reform is considered in Section 12.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The direct cost of the conflict in Iraq was at least £9.2bn (the equivalent of </p>
<p>£11.83bn in 2016). In total, 89 percent of that was spent on military operations. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government’s decision to take part in military action against Iraq was not </p>
<p>affected by consideration of the potential financial cost to the UK of the invasion or </p>
<p>the post&#8209;conflict period.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ministers were not provided with estimates of military conflict and post&#8209;conflict costs, </p>
<p>or with advice on their affordability, when decisions were taken on the scale of the </p>
<p>UK’s military contribution to a US&#8209;led invasion of Iraq, and on the UK’s role in the </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict period. They should have been.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no articulated need for additional financial resources for military </p>
<p>operations in Iraq that was not met.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The arrangements for funding military Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) and </p>
<p>other military costs worked as intended, and did not constrain the UK military’s ability </p>
<p>to conduct operations in Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The controls imposed by the Treasury on the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD’s) budget </p>
<p>in September 2003 did not constrain the UK military’s ability to conduct operations </p>
<p>in Iraq. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government was slow to recognise that Iraq was an enduring operation, and </p>
<p>to adapt its funding arrangements to support both military operations and civilian </p>
<p>activities. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The arrangements for securing funding for civilian activities could be slow and </p>
<p>unpredictable. Some high&#8209;priority civilian activities were funded late or only in part. </p>
<p><b>Estimates of the cost of the UK’s involvement in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> It was the responsibility of departments in the first instance to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>produce estimates of the costs of activities for which they were responsible; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>discuss those estimates with the Treasury; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>make them available to Ministers and, if appropriate, Cabinet to inform their </p>
<p>discussions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.2  |  Conclusions: Resources</p>
<p>571</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The Treasury began considering the potential cost of UK involvement in Iraq in </p>
<p>June 2002, and produced the first estimated figure for the cost of military action in Iraq </p>
<p>(£2.5bn) in September 2002. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> The MOD sent “some indicative breakdowns” of the cost of military action to the </p>
<p>Treasury on 11 October</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> and “ball&#8209;park figures” for the cost of military action (up to £2bn) </p>
<p>to Mr Blair on 15 October, to inform his decision on whether to offer a large scale land </p>
<p>force to the US.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>6. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, sent a detailed estimate of contingency </p>
<p>planning costs (£1.65bn) to Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in </p>
<p>mid&#8209;December. A copy of the letter was sent to Mr Blair. That estimate covered the </p>
<p>cost of preparing, deploying and retrieving a military force, but not of any war&#8209;fighting </p>
<p>or post&#8209;conflict activities.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The MOD produced its first estimate of military post&#8209;conflict costs in February 2003, </p>
<p>just one month before the invasion. It also increased its estimated figure for the cost of </p>
<p>military action (to between £2.5bn and £3bn).</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The Treasury produced detailed analyses of the implications of a conflict in Iraq for </p>
<p>public expenditure in September and October 2002. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> Treasury officials’ advice to Mr Brown on military cost estimates and the implications </p>
<p>for public expenditure was timely and accurate. It repeatedly highlighted the risk that </p>
<p>the UK would have to maintain a significant military force in Iraq in the medium term </p>
<p>and challenged the MOD’s assertion that the UK could limit its financial liability for Iraq’s </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict security and reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The MOD should have produced detailed estimates of military conflict and </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict costs sooner, in order to inform consideration of options for the UK’s </p>
<p>engagement.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Both the Treasury (from September 2002) and the Department for International </p>
<p>Development (DFID) (from January 2003) produced detailed and robust analyses of </p>
<p>potential humanitarian assistance and reconstruction costs in Iraq. Both departments </p>
<p>concluded that the costs could be substantial. </p>
<p><b>12. </b> Treasury officials’ advice to Mr Brown highlighted the risk that the UK might have to </p>
<p>make a significant contribution to Iraq’s reconstruction, as a key member of the Coalition </p>
<p>and in particular in the absence of UN cover. The UK Government expected that UN </p>
<p>cover would be necessary if other international partners were to provide significant </p>
<p>contributions to the post&#8209;conflict effort. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>572</p>
<p><b>13. </b> In February 2003, Treasury officials provided Mr Brown with the first comprehensive </p>
<p>estimate of military and civilian costs for the conflict and post&#8209;conflict period. The cost of </p>
<p>a military campaign was estimated at £3.4bn over three years, with a further £1bn in the </p>
<p>first year after a conflict for post&#8209;conflict military operations. The cost of a UK contribution </p>
<p>to humanitarian assistance and reconstruction was estimated at up to £0.75bn in the </p>
<p>first year after a conflict (representing 10 percent of the cost of the total international </p>
<p>effort). The Treasury indicated that costs for military operations beyond 2004/05 and for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance and reconstruction beyond 2003/04 were unknown. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> Treasury officials advised Mr Brown that their estimate reflected the “biggest </p>
<p>commitment” that the UK could make in the post&#8209;conflict period – taking military </p>
<p>responsibility for a geographical area of Iraq.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> The costs of such a commitment would be </p>
<p>substantial and could extend into the long term. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Given the uncertainties over the scale of the UK’s military presence in post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>Iraq, and the inevitable uncertainties over the scale of any post&#8209;conflict humanitarian </p>
<p>crisis and reconstruction challenge, the Treasury’s February 2003 estimates were </p>
<p>remarkably accurate. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Mr Paul Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that the Treasury’s analyses of the impact of war on the UK’s public finances </p>
<p>were not conducted with the intention of “second&#8209;guessing” Ministers, but to enable the </p>
<p>Treasury to contribute to planning and policy discussions.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. </b> The Inquiry agrees that the Treasury’s analyses should have contributed to planning </p>
<p>and policy discussions. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that, in his discussions with Cabinet colleagues in </p>
<p>the months leading up to the invasion, he made it clear that the Treasury would not </p>
<p>“interfere” by suggesting that cost should be a factor in choosing one military option over </p>
<p>another:</p>
<p>“That was not our job ... At every point, I made it clear that we would support </p>
<p>whatever option the military decided upon with the Prime Minister and the </p>
<p>Cabinet ...”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>The decision to take military action against Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>19. </b> Section 6.5 addresses the Government’s failure to establish a unified </p>
<p>planning process across the four principal departments involved – the Foreign and </p>
<p>Commonwealth Office (FCO), the MOD, DFID and the Treasury – or between military </p>
<p>and civilian planners, in the pre&#8209;conflict period. </p>

<p>13.2  |  Conclusions: Resources</p>
<p>573</p>
<p><b>20. </b> In the absence of a Cabinet Minister with overall responsibility for Iraq, leadership </p>
<p>on strategy rested with Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The version of the <i>Ministerial Code</i> that was current in 2003 stated that it was the </p>
<p>responsibility of the initiating department to ensure that proposals involving expenditure </p>
<p>or affecting general financial policy were discussed with the Treasury before being </p>
<p>submitted to Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee. The result of the discussion together </p>
<p>with an estimate of the cost should be included in the memorandum submitted to </p>
<p>Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee.</p>
<p><b>Mr Brown’s discussions with Ministers on the likely </b></p>
<p><b>costs of the UK’s involvement in Iraq </b></p>
<p>In the months before the invasion, Treasury officials produced a series of detailed </p>
<p>analyses of the likely cost of intervention in Iraq, and the effect on public expenditure, for </p>
<p>Mr Brown. In the context of that advice, Treasury officials urged Mr Brown to intervene in </p>
<p>discussions on the scale of the UK’s involvement in the military campaign and on the UK’s </p>
<p>role in a post&#8209;conflict Iraq. </p>
<p>Mr Brown had many meetings with Cabinet colleagues, including Mr Blair, in the run&#8209;up </p>
<p>to the invasion. Those meetings were often one&#8209;to&#8209;one, and no record was taken. In the </p>
<p>absence of those records, the Inquiry is unable to determine whether or in what way </p>
<p>Mr Brown raised the issues highlighted by his officials. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The detailed estimates for military conflict and post&#8209;conflict costs produced by the </p>
<p>MOD and the Treasury, and the analyses of the implications of a conflict in Iraq for public </p>
<p>expenditure produced by the Treasury, were not sent to Mr Blair or to Ministers outside </p>
<p>the originating departments. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, wrote to Mr Blair on </p>
<p>5 February, 14 February and 5 March 2003, highlighting the potential cost of a UK </p>
<p>contribution to an international humanitarian assistance and reconstruction effort, and </p>
<p>the potential cost of pursuing an exemplary approach to the provision of humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance in the UK’s Area of Responsibility (AOR) in southern Iraq. She also raised the </p>
<p>issue in Cabinet on 27 February. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> On 14 March, in response to Mr Blair’s request that Mr Brown should draw up a </p>
<p>funding plan for Iraq, the Treasury provided a paper setting out the potential cost of a </p>
<p>UK contribution to an international humanitarian assistance and reconstruction effort.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Detailed estimates of military costs and the analyses of the implications of a conflict </p>
<p>for public expenditure should have been available to Ministers on three occasions which </p>
<p>shaped the UK’s involvement in Iraq: </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>In advance of Mr Blair’s decision on 31 October 2002</b> that the UK should </p>
<p>offer a large scale land force to the US for planning purposes. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>574</p>
<p>Mr Blair had, over the previous month, expressed his concern to Mr Hoon over </p>
<p>the additional costs associated with providing a large scale land force as part of </p>
<p>a UK contribution to a US&#8209;led invasion of Iraq, and asked whether those costs </p>
<p>had been discussed with the Treasury. </p>
<p>The MOD and the Treasury had, by the middle of October, developed broad </p>
<p>estimates of the cost of providing a large scale land force. Mr Brown had also </p>
<p>been provided with detailed analyses of the implications for public expenditure of </p>
<p>a conflict in Iraq. </p>
<p>At the meeting where the decision to offer a large scale land force was taken, </p>
<p>Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff, stated his belief that </p>
<p>providing a large military contribution to the campaign would mean that the </p>
<p>UK would be under less pressure to make a large contribution to post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>In February and March 2003</b>, when the Government considered whether to </p>
<p>take on military responsibility for a geographical area of Iraq in the post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>period.<b> </b></p>
<p>The MOD and the Treasury had, by February, developed detailed estimates of </p>
<p>the potential cost of such a commitment (although there remained a number of </p>
<p>unknown factors). </p>
<p>When the Government acceded in April to the US request that it assume </p>
<p>leadership of a military AOR encompassing four provinces in southern Iraq, it did </p>
<p>so without a robust analysis either of the strategic implications for the UK or of </p>
<p>the military’s capacity to support the UK’s potential obligations in the region. A </p>
<p>step of such magnitude should have been taken deliberately, having considered </p>
<p>the wider strategic and resource implications and contingent liabilities. </p>
<p>In the event, the UK was responsible for security in its AOR for six years, </p>
<p>initially as an Occupying Power and, from June 2004, in support of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>In advance of Cabinet’s decision on 17 March 2003</b> to issue an ultimatum </p>
<p>to Iraq and ask the House of Commons to endorse the use of military action </p>
<p>against Iraq if necessary. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> The extent to which cost should be a determining factor in reaching a policy decision </p>
<p>is for Ministers to judge based on the circumstances of each particular case. But it is </p>
<p>essential that those taking collective responsibility for a decision have the ability to make </p>
<p>an informed judgement about the likely costs and risks. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> Neither Cabinet nor any of the Ministerial meetings convened to discuss military </p>
<p>options and the UK’s role in a post&#8209;conflict Iraq were provided with detailed cost </p>
<p>estimates for the various policy options for the UK’s involvement in Iraq, and their </p>
<p>implications for public expenditure. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.2  |  Conclusions: Resources</p>
<p>575</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Those meetings were therefore unable to reach informed judgements on the </p>
<p>financial risk associated with those options. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> The leading role played by No.10 in the decision to support US&#8209;led military action </p>
<p>against Iraq may have contributed to that omission.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> In relation to decisions of such gravity as invading another sovereign country, it is </p>
<p>particularly important that the Prime Minister ensures that the <i>Ministerial Code</i> is met.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> But Mr Brown, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, should have ensured that estimates </p>
<p>of the likely overall cost of a UK intervention in Iraq, for military and civilian activities </p>
<p>during the conflict and post&#8209;conflict period, and the wider implications for public </p>
<p>expenditure were identified and available to Ministers and Cabinet. </p>
<p><b>Arrangements for funding military operations and </b></p>
<p><b>civilian activities</b></p>
<p><b>32. </b> The Government used the existing – separate – arrangements for funding military </p>
<p>operations and civilian activities to fund the UK’s involvement in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> Military operations were funded through well&#8209;established procedures which enabled </p>
<p>the MOD to incur costs and then reclaim them from the Reserve. Those claims were </p>
<p>(in line with the agreed procedures) subject to a relatively light level of scrutiny by </p>
<p>the Treasury. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> DFID and the FCO funded their activities in Iraq in the first instance by reprioritising </p>
<p>within their existing departmental settlements and, if and when that proved insufficient, </p>
<p>by bidding to the Treasury for additional funding from the Reserve. Those bids were </p>
<p>closely scrutinised by the Treasury.</p>
<p><b>35. </b> The Treasury pressed DFID and the FCO hard to reprioritise within their existing </p>
<p>departmental settlements to fund new activities in Iraq, before agreeing to provide </p>
<p>additional funding from the Reserve. An FCO official, writing in 2005, described the </p>
<p>Treasury as playing “hard ball” and setting departments against one another in order </p>
<p>to see off potential and actual claims to the Reserve.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>36. </b> The MOD, DFID and the FCO also had access to a small, inter&#8209;departmental </p>
<p>fund – initially the Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) – intended for conflict </p>
<p>prevention activities. The GCPP had been established to encourage and support a more </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordinated approach across Government.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> DFID had a larger departmental settlement than the FCO, including a large </p>
<p>allocation for funding programmes. Programme allocations could be used flexibly in </p>
<p>response to emerging priorities. DFID therefore had more scope than the FCO to find </p>
<p>funding for new programmes in Iraq. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>576</p>
<p><b>38. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti, DFID Permanent Secretary from 2002 to 2007, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that DFID’s funding for Iraq was found by reallocating funding from DFID </p>
<p>programmes in other middle&#8209;income countries, rather than from programmes in </p>
<p>low&#8209;income countries.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>39. </b> Sir Mark Lyall&#8209;Grant, FCO Policy Director from 2007 to 2009, summarised the </p>
<p>situation in his evidence to the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… you have the MOD which can call on the Reserve for unforeseen military </p>
<p>expenditure. You have DFID, who have a large amount of programme money ... </p>
<p>and you have the Foreign Office that doesn’t have any money.”</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The Treasury’s priority throughout the period covered by the Inquiry was to </p>
<p>avoid any suggestion that other departments should have access to the Reserve on </p>
<p>the same basis as the MOD. In February 2007, a senior Treasury official advised </p>
<p>Mr Stephen Timms, Chief Secretary to the Treasury from May 2006 to June 2007:</p>
<p>“Arguably this [the different arrangements for funding military operations and civilian </p>
<p>activities] can lead to perverse outcomes ... if it incentivises decision&#8209;makers to </p>
<p>prefer military responses to civilian ones. But it is a useful safety net for us and not </p>
<p>to be given up without careful thought.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>41. </b> The arrangements for funding military operations (including Urgent Operational </p>
<p>Requirements – UORs) worked as intended, and did not constrain the military’s ability to </p>
<p>conduct operations in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> All the MOD’s claims on the Reserve in respect of UORs and other additional </p>
<p>military costs were met. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> There are no indications that Mr Brown, Mr Boateng or Treasury officials acted to </p>
<p>delay or distort the provision of funding for UORs and other additional military costs. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> There are no indications that DFID’s activities in Iraq were constrained by a lack of </p>
<p>resources. The constraints imposed by the disproportionate cost of providing security for </p>
<p>civilian staff and contractors in Iraq are addressed in Section 15.</p>

<p>13.2  |  Conclusions: Resources</p>
<p>577</p>
<p><b>Funding for humanitarian assistance </b></p>
<p>Ms Short and Sir Suma Chakrabarti both told the Inquiry that DFID’s ability to plan to </p>
<p>deliver humanitarian assistance had been constrained by the Treasury’s reluctance to </p>
<p>provide additional funding from the Reserve. </p>
<p>By the end of January 2003, DFID officials had developed a detailed (but still draft) </p>
<p>assessment of potential UK contributions for humanitarian relief and reconstruction in Iraq, </p>
<p>under a number of scenarios. </p>
<p>Ms Short did not approach Mr Brown or the Treasury with a specific bid for additional </p>
<p>resources until 21 March (although she was aware that Mr Brown was likely to support it). </p>
<p>She did write to Mr Blair on 5 February, 14 February and 5 March, advising him of the cost </p>
<p>of potential UK contributions for humanitarian relief and reconstruction (up to £440m a </p>
<p>year), and seeking direction on the role of the UK in delivering the humanitarian response. </p>
<p>She also raised the issue in Cabinet on 27 February.</p>
<p>Given the scale of UK resources that might have been required, it was reasonable to seek </p>
<p>clear direction from Mr Blair on the UK’s role in the humanitarian response. But that did </p>
<p>not preclude an early bid to the Reserve. Indeed, a detailed bid may have focused the </p>
<p>Government’s attention on the need to define the UK’s role more clearly. </p>
<p>By the end of March, DFID had earmarked £210m for humanitarian assistance in Iraq, </p>
<p>comprising £90m from DFID’s own resources and £120m that it had secured from the </p>
<p>Reserve. In addition, the Treasury had agreed that the UK military could spend £30m on </p>
<p>providing humanitarian assistance in the UK’s Area of Operations. </p>
<p>The humanitarian crisis that had been feared did not materialise. By the beginning of May, </p>
<p>DFID had reallocated the balance of the £210m allocated for humanitarian assistance that </p>
<p>remained uncommitted – approximately £90m – to reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> Given its limited programme funds, the FCO found it particularly difficult to identify </p>
<p>funding for new activities in Iraq. It was successful in making bids for funding from </p>
<p>the Reserve to pay for security costs for personnel deployed to Iraq and diplomatic </p>
<p>representation, but other bids were rejected in full or in part. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> The FCO’s difficulty in securing additional funding was due in part to the quality of </p>
<p>its bids to the Reserve, and in part to the Treasury’s perception that the FCO had not </p>
<p>made sufficient effort to reprioritise from within its existing resources. The Inquiry has not </p>
<p>assessed the accuracy of that perception. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> In their efforts to secure funding, departments stretched the scope of the GCPP to </p>
<p>accommodate activities as diverse as military equipment for the Iraqi Security Forces </p>
<p>and the Basra Poetry Festival. But the Pool was small (only £7.5m for Iraq in 2003/04) </p>
<p>and the process for securing funding was slow. Sir Mark Lyall&#8209;Grant told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>decisions about how to spend relatively small sums of money had led to “huge disputes </p>

<p>between Government departments” which had consumed significant amounts of senior </p>
<p>officials’ time.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Departments found it particularly difficult to find funding for activities that emerged </p>
<p>“in&#8209;year” or appeared to fall between the boundaries of departments’ responsibilities </p>
<p>(such as activities to promote political outreach or support the Iraqi media). A number </p>
<p>of civilian activities that Ministers had identified as a high priority – including, in 2003, </p>
<p>support for the Iraq Media Network and, in 2006, the first Better Basra Action Plan – </p>
<p>were funded late, and only in part.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Departments recognised in mid&#8209;2003 that the arrangements for funding civilian </p>
<p>activities were not working well. In September, the Treasury rejected a proposal from </p>
<p>departments for a new pool for funding non&#8209;military activity in Iraq, on the grounds that it </p>
<p>might lead to an increase in claims to the Reserve. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> The UK’s deployment into Helmand province, Afghanistan, in 2006 prompted </p>
<p>departments, led by the FCO, to revisit the arrangements for funding civilian post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>activities. Initial proposals focused on enhancing or complementing the GCPP (on the </p>
<p>assumption that the Treasury would not allow access to the Reserve for non&#8209;military </p>
<p>activities). </p>
<p><b>51. </b> At the same time, MOD claims on the Reserve for UORs increased significantly as </p>
<p>security in Iraq deteriorated, expenditure on Afghanistan increased, and the Government </p>
<p>provided new equipment for the Armed Forces. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> The Treasury continued to agree the MOD’s claims against the Reserve, but by </p>
<p>April 2007 had concluded that the UOR programme had become a straightforward </p>
<p>supplement to the MOD’s Equipment Programme rather than a response to urgent and </p>
<p>specific requirements in a theatre of operations. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> In July 2007, the MOD and the Treasury agreed a new arrangement for funding </p>
<p>UORs designed to shift the focus of the MOD’s Equipment Programme towards current </p>
<p>operations. The new arrangement was expected to be cost neutral for the MOD.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> There were also changes to the arrangements for funding non&#8209;military activities. </p>
<p>In July, the Treasury announced the creation of a new Stabilisation Fund (later </p>
<p>renamed the Stabilisation Aid Fund – SAF) to fund immediate civilian support to </p>
<p>military operations (activities which had previously been funded from the GCPP). </p>
<p>The GCPP was combined with the Africa Conflict Prevention Pool to form the Conflict </p>
<p>Pool. New governance arrangements sought to link more closely expenditure from the </p>
<p>SAF and the Conflict Pool with UK strategy.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The changes to the arrangements for funding UORs did not affect operations in Iraq, </p>
<p>which were by this time generating fewer demands for UORs.</p>

<p>13.2  |  Conclusions: Resources</p>
<p>579</p>
<p><b>56. </b> There are no indications that the new arrangements for funding civilian activities </p>
<p>affected the civilian effort in Iraq, which was by that time reducing. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> The Government continued to develop its arrangements for funding reconstruction </p>
<p>and stabilisation operations. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> The Inquiry has not evaluated in detail the effectiveness of the new arrangements </p>
<p>that were introduced in 2007. They do exhibit some important and welcome features:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a dedicated and substantial pool of resources for civilian activities in </p>
<p>environments such as Iraq and Afghanistan; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a requirement that allocations should be based on an inter&#8209;departmental </p>
<p>strategy.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> The Government should have recognised earlier that Iraq was an enduring </p>
<p>operation, and adapted its arrangements for funding the military operation and civilian </p>
<p>activities accordingly in order to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that the UOR programme retained its focus on addressing urgent and </p>
<p>specific requirements in theatre; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>address the difficulties in securing funding for civilian activities. </p>
<p><b>The imposition of Treasury controls on the MOD </b></p>
<p>In the light of the publicity surrounding the funding and management of the defence </p>
<p>programme in 2003 and 2004, the Inquiry examined two related questions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the size of the MOD’s core budget imposed constraints on operations </p>
<p>in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the imposition of controls on the MOD’s management of its resources </p>
<p>by the Treasury in September 2003 had an impact on operations in Iraq. </p>
<p>Several witnesses told the Inquiry that, in the MOD’s view, the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence </i></p>
<p><i>Review</i>, which signified a major shift towards expeditionary armed forces, had not been </p>
<p>fully funded. </p>
<p>With respect to military operations in Iraq, there are no indications that there was an </p>
<p>unmet, articulated need for additional financial resources. All the MOD’s claims on the </p>
<p>Reserve in respect of UORs and other additional military costs were met.</p>
<p>The Inquiry concludes in Section 14.2 that there were known military capability gaps in </p>
<p>Iraq, and that the availability of funding was not a direct barrier to the identification and </p>
<p>deployment of solutions to those gaps. </p>
<p>During September 2003, the MOD’s additional cash requirement for 2003/04 rose from </p>
<p>£490m to £1,152m. The MOD intended to meet that cash requirement by making a </p>
<p>transfer from its non&#8209;cash budget. The Treasury took the view that that increase signalled </p>
<p>a complete lack of budgetary control within the MOD, and on 26 September imposed </p>
<p>controls on the MOD’s management of its resources.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>580</p>
<p>The size of the MOD’s proposed transfer from its non&#8209;cash budget reflected a deliberate </p>
<p>attempt by the MOD to exploit the opportunities offered by the Government’s transition </p>
<p>from cash accounting to Resource Accounting and Budgeting. </p>
<p>The increase in the size of the MOD’s cash requirement during September reflected the </p>
<p>inability of the MOD to produce reliable estimates of its cash requirement. </p>
<p>There are no indications that the controls imposed on the MOD by the Treasury in </p>
<p>September 2003 constrained the military’s ability to conduct operations in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>Resources and strategy</b></p>
<p><b>60. </b> Section 9.8 describes the Government’s repeated reassessments of its strategy </p>
<p>for Iraq. Those strategies tended to focus on describing a desired end state, rather </p>
<p>than how it would be reached. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> None of those strategies considered the resources that the Government would </p>
<p>need to commit to achieve those end states and (at a strategic level) how those </p>
<p>resources should be allocated. </p>
<p><b>62. </b> In the absence of a strong strategic framework, spending on military operations in </p>
<p>Iraq was driven by a series of decisions on UK force levels and on the equipment that </p>
<p>should be provided to the Armed Forces. </p>
<p><b>63. </b> The Inquiry concludes in Section 9.8 that, from July 2005 onwards, decisions in </p>
<p>relation to resources for Iraq were made under the influence of the demands of the UK </p>
<p>effort in Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> Allocations for civilian activities were driven by the FCO’s and DFID’s willingness </p>
<p>and ability to reprioritise from within their departmental budgets and their ability to secure </p>
<p>additional funding from the Reserve and the GCPP. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> The direct cost to the UK Government of its intervention in Iraq between 2002/03 </p>
<p>and 2009/10 was at least £9.2bn in cash terms (the equivalent of £11.83bn in 2016), </p>
<p>comprising: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£8.20bn (89 percent of the total direct cost) on military operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£0.58bn (6 percent) on humanitarian and development assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£0.30bn (3 percent) on diplomatic representation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£0.16bn (2 percent) from the inter&#8209;departmental pools. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> There are no indications that the Government questioned the balance of funding </p>
<p>between military operations and civilian activities, or considered what the most effective </p>
<p>balance of effort might be to achieve the UK’s strategic objectives. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> Lord Boateng told the Inquiry that the imbalance in funding between military </p>
<p>operations and civilian activities had arisen “partly as a result of the funding mechanism </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.2  |  Conclusions: Resources</p>
<p>581</p>
<p>deployed, in the sense that the Ministry of Defence had an access to the Reserve that </p>
<p>was on a different scale from the others [DFID and the FCO]”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> He continued:</p>
<p>“... did anyone sit down and say, ‘Well, this is the sum of money that we have, this </p>
<p>ought to be the balance?’ No, I don’t think they did. Should they have done? Maybe, </p>
<p>but actually it is ... very difficult to do.” </p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>68. </b> The direction in the <i>Ministerial Code</i> that the estimate of a cost of a proposal should </p>
<p>be included in the memorandum submitted to Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee applies </p>
<p>equally to military operations. When evaluating military options it is appropriate to </p>
<p>consider financial risk alongside other forms of risk. While governments will rarely wish </p>
<p>to preclude options solely on the basis of cost, they must also recognise that, over time, </p>
<p>cost may become an issue and make it difficult to sustain a military operation over the </p>
<p>longer term. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> Section 9.8 addresses the difficulties that the Government faced in converting </p>
<p>successive UK strategies into action, in part because those strategies tended to focus </p>
<p>on describing the desired end state rather than how it would be reached. On none </p>
<p>of the occasions when UK strategy was reconsidered was a robust, costed plan for </p>
<p>implementation produced. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> Strategies and plans must define the resources required to deliver objectives, </p>
<p>identify the budget(s) that will provide those resources, and confirm that those resources </p>
<p>are available. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> In developing strategies and plans for civilian/military operations, a government </p>
<p>should address the impact of the different mechanisms used to fund military operations </p>
<p>and civilian activities and the extent to which those mechanisms provide perverse </p>
<p>incentives for military action by making it easier to secure funding for agreed military </p>
<p>operations than for civilian activities. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> A government should also address its explicit and implicit financial policy that, while </p>
<p>there should be no constraint on the provision of funding for military operations, it is </p>
<p>reasonable that for the same civilian/military operation, departments should find funding </p>
<p>for new civilian activities from within their existing budgets, which are likely to be fully </p>
<p>allocated to existing departmental priorities. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> A government is likely to embark on major civilian/military operations such as Iraq </p>
<p>only rarely. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> A government should recognise that, in such operations, the civilian components </p>
<p>(including diplomatic activity, reconstruction and Security Sector Reform) will be critical </p>
<p>for strategic success, may be very substantial, and must be properly resourced. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>582</p>
<p><b>75. </b> One arrangement would be to create a budget for the civilian components of the </p>
<p>operation, under the direction of a senior Minister with lead responsibility and in support </p>
<p>of a coherent UK strategy. Once allocations were made from that budget to individual </p>
<p>departments, the allocations would be managed within departments’ legal and policy </p>
<p>constraints. Such an arrangement should: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that UK strategy was resourced; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promote joint working;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>minimise the potential for gaming;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>be able to respond to in&#8209;year priorities; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reduce the amount of time that Ministers and senior officials need to spend </p>
<p>arguing about funding individual activities. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> The Inquiry recognises that, since 2003, significant changes have been made to the </p>
<p>UK’s strategic and operational approach to reconstruction and stabilisation, including to </p>
<p>the arrangements for funding such operations.</p>
