<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>398</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK role in the political development of Iraq, including preparation for </p>
<p>Iraq’s first post-Saddam Hussein elections in January 2005 and subsequent </p>
<p>negotiations to form the Iraqi Transitional Government under Prime Minister </p>
<p>Ja’afari;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strategies for tackling the Sunni insurgency, including the UK role in preparation </p>
<p>for the second major US offensive in Fallujah; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>plans for the deployment and withdrawal of UK troops.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and reform of its security sector, </p>
<p>which are covered in Sections 10 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can </p>
<p>be read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>July 2004</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> On 1 July, Saddam Hussein and 11 other senior Ba’athists appeared in front of an </p>
<p>Iraqi court convened at the Camp Victory court martial facility in Baghdad.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The judge presiding told all 12 what crimes they were accused of having committed. </p>
<p>Mr Chris Segar, Head of the British Office Baghdad reported that:</p>
<p>“… under Iraqi law this was a first step in which the accused is informed that there </p>
<p>are allegations against him which deserve investigation, which allow for continued </p>
<p>detention and that he has a right to legal counsel.”</p>
<p><b>6. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation </p>
<p>(AHMGIR) on 1 July informed Ministers that the next seven months in Iraq, leading to </p>
<p>elections in early 2005 and the creation of an Iraqi Transitional Government and National </p>
<p>Assembly, would be the real test of the success of the transition and the Interim Iraqi </p>
<p>Government (IIG) to which the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) had handed power </p>
<p>at the end of June.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The Annotated Agenda also said:</p>
<p>“As expected, the pre-handover period was marked by an <b>increase in attacks</b> </p>
<p>on both coalition and, increasingly, Iraqi forces.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.3  |  July 2004 to May 2005</p>
<p>399</p>
<p><b>8. </b> When the AHMGIR met, the FCO was commissioned to co-ordinate an integrated </p>
<p>UK strategy covering the period up to Iraqi elections.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>9. </b> On 2 July, the Assessments Staff reported “no major attacks over the transition </p>
<p>period, and a distinct downturn in lower-level attacks, especially in Baghdad”; probably </p>
<p>attributable to bringing forward the handover date and increased security measures as it </p>
<p>approached.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>10. </b> In the first few days of July, Mr Edward Chaplin arrived in Baghdad to take up post </p>
<p>as the first British Ambassador to Iraq for 13 years.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry that “the overall priority for the Embassy … was the </p>
<p>support of the political process and making sure that elections could take place on time </p>
<p>at the end of January 2005”.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>12. </b> On 5 July, the Assessments Staff provided Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign </p>
<p>Policy Adviser, with statistics on the number of attacks against the Multi-National Force – </p>
<p>Iraq (MNF-I) and Iraqi targets which showed that there had been a reduction:</p>
<p>“… at some 400/week, however, it is still running well above the rate in January/</p>
<p>February.” </p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Sir Nigel commented in manuscript to Mr Blair that there were “some, tentative, </p>
<p>positive signs”.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference on 6 July and commented </p>
<p>that although insurgents would continue their activities, overall the security situation was </p>
<p>better.</p>
<p>8 </p>
<p>In the South-East, Iraqis were increasingly in the lead on security.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Blair was concerned to remind the public about Saddam Hussein’s use of </p>
<p>chemical weapons and to expose and document the human rights abuses which had </p>
<p>taken place during his regime.</p>
<p><b>16. </b> A meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group on 9 July noted:</p>
<p>“… the withdrawal of the MNF was likely to be a key [Iraqi] election issue. While we </p>
<p>remained committed to help Iraq with security, we needed to start thinking about the </p>
<p>possibility that we would be reducing our presence in Iraq during 2005. We would </p>
<p>want to avoid the appearance of our assistance being rebuffed.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>400</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Attendees at the Iraq Strategy Group were also told that increasing the UN’s </p>
<p>engagement in Iraq, including by the appointment of a new Special Representative, </p>
<p>was proving to be difficult.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> In their conversation on 12 July, Mr Blair told President Bush that he was </p>
<p>encouraged by recent reports on Iraq; the key was now to maintain momentum, </p>
<p>including by pushing the UN to develop its role and by supporting Prime Minister Allawi.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>19. </b> On the same day Mr Ashraf Jehangir Qazi was appointed as the new UN Special </p>
<p>Representative for Iraq, with responsibility for the United Nations Assistance Mission </p>
<p>for Iraq.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Qazi was a Pakistani diplomat who had been Ambassador of Pakistan to the </p>
<p>United States since September 2002.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The strategy paper commissioned by the AHMGIR on 1 July was circulated to </p>
<p>members of the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP) on 13 July.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The introduction to the paper said that it offered:</p>
<p>“… a strategic look at the position we want Iraq to be in at the end of January 2005; </p>
<p>risks to our strategy; and priority areas in which the UK can help ensure success.”</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The following objectives were proposed in the paper:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Political</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>an elected Transitional National Government which enjoys broad domestic </p>
<p>and international support; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>increased international support for the IIG.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>real inroads into the insurgency through Iraqi-led security and political </p>
<p>measures, including a political process (aimed at drawing in former </p>
<p>regime elements and militants such as Muqtada al-Sadr) and improved </p>
<p>co-operation with Iraq’s neighbours over border security; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>significantly increased Iraqi security capacity with Iraqi forces in local </p>
<p>control around much of the country and a reduced reliance on international </p>
<p>troops, paving the way for foreign troop reductions in 2005.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction and economic development</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a functioning Iraqi Administration in Baghdad and at governorate level </p>
<p>capable of delivering basic services;</p>

<p>401</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>reconstruction programmes which deliver jobs and improvements to </p>
<p>infrastructure and services; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>reduction of subsidies and an agreed IMF programme leading to a debt </p>
<p>settlement by the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The paper said that security problems posed the greatest risk to achieving the </p>
<p>objectives it set out, in particular the risk of “a terrorist spectacular” against either the </p>
<p>IIG or the UN. Other significant risks included postponement of the elections, pressure </p>
<p>for premature withdrawal of the MNF-I, infrastructure failures during the summer and </p>
<p>an increase in sectarian tension.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Based on the objectives and risks listed, the UK priorities proposed were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>redefining the US and UK relationship with the IIG, so that it would be seen to </p>
<p>be taking decisions without interference;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuading the UN to increase its engagement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pushing for an international conference;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving electoral communications and getting the UK media to reflect </p>
<p>“the improving situation in Iraq”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting IIG efforts to re-engage members of the former regime and keeping </p>
<p>pressure on neighbouring states regarding border security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mitigating opposition to the MNF-I, including by countering perceptions of </p>
<p>an intention to stay indefinitely;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting Iraqiisation of security forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keeping pressure on the US to spend money in Southern Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pressing the UN and World Bank to send staff back to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> When DOP met on 15 July it agreed those priorities and also that the UK should </p>
<p>continue to encourage potential contributors to a UN protection force.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Some positive progress on electricity production was reported, but implementation </p>
<p>of the main infrastructure contracts was slow. DOP agreed that DFID should produce </p>
<p>a note on infrastructure issues which Mr Blair might use in discussions with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> In a paper for the Chiefs of Staff dated 16 July, Lieutenant General Robert Fry, </p>
<p>Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), stated that “although insurgency </p>
<p>continues, development of competent Iraqi Security Forces remains on track.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>29. </b> Provided the necessary criteria were achieved, the campaign plan envisaged </p>
<p>a gradual drawdown of troops during 2005 leading to final withdrawal in 2006, to be </p>
<p>followed by a period of “Strategic Overwatch”.</p>

<p>Minutes, 15 July 2004, DOP meeting.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Lt Gen Fry assumed that “some form of enduring commitment … will be required”.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> On the same day Dr Condoleezza Rice, the US National Security Advisor, told </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald, who was visiting Washington, that President Bush was of the view </p>
<p>that the only way to honour those who had died in Iraq was to get the job done.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>would be no reduction of US troops unless the security situation permitted it.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> On 21 July, the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC) issued an Assessment of the </p>
<p>security situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The JIC recorded that, across Iraq, there was a brief reduction in violence </p>
<p>immediately after the IIG assumed authority on 28 June, but “attacks are still occurring </p>
<p>at a steady rate that is impeding progress on the international community’s political and </p>
<p>economic objectives for Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> Of those attacks:</p>
<p>“Most … continue to be against the MNF, using small arms, improvised explosive </p>
<p>devices (IEDs), mortars and rockets. But suicide car bomb attacks, principally </p>
<p>targeting Iraqis, have also continued. Islamist groups, and others, continue to take </p>
<p>(and kill) hostages … Attacks against infrastructure continue.”</p>
<p><b>35. </b> Although the situation in Najaf, Karbala and the Shia areas of Baghdad remained </p>
<p>“relatively calm”, the Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) “in effect retains control of the Imam Ali </p>
<p>shrine in Najaf”. Muqtada al-Sadr was maintaining a “low profile” and was assessed </p>
<p>to be “seeking a political role, while retaining military options”.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“No significant reduction [in the level of violence] is likely in the near term and a </p>
<p>number of triggers during the next few months may result in increased violence.”</p>
<p><b>37. </b> Lieutenant General William Rollo told the Inquiry that, when he arrived to take over </p>
<p>as GOC MND(SE) in July 2004, the situation in the South of Iraq was “basically quiet”.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR on 22 July said that “there have been a </p>
<p>number of high profile incidents in recent days … reflecting the continued capacity of </p>
<p>insurgents to plan and carry out attacks”.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>39. </b> In a single week in mid-July, the Governor of Mosul, a leading member of the </p>
<p>Basra Provincial Council, the Babil Chief of Police and one of the Iraqi MOD’s Directors </p>
<p>General were killed in separate incidents, along with several members of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces and civilians. The Iraqi Minister of Justice was also attacked.</p>

<p>403</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 22 July.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> Mr Blair asked </p>
<p>about progress on the “Iraq Security Plan” and noted that:</p>
<p>“… showing progress on controlling the violence was the toughest issue – for the </p>
<p>UK public a real sense that Iraq was on the way to a peaceful future was essential.”</p>
<p><b>41. </b> An early draft of a security strategy for the IIG, drawn up by US, UK and Iraqi </p>
<p>representatives in Baghdad – but not seen by Prime Minister Allawi – was reviewed </p>
<p>by a meeting of senior officials chaired by Mr Bowen on 27 July.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p><b>42. </b> At the meeting, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary said:</p>
<p>“… the Prime Minister believed the security strategy should be a key document in </p>
<p>communicating the IIG’s plans on security to the Iraqi people. The current draft was </p>
<p>not the document the PM was anticipating: it went much broader, and lacked detail </p>
<p>on plans to develop the security forces and Iraqiise security.”</p>
<p><b>43. </b> The meeting was told that work on Iraqiisation was being carried out by a separate </p>
<p>team, led by Lieutenant General David Petraeus, Commander Multi-National Security </p>
<p>Transition Command – Iraq (MNSTC-I). FCO officials were tasked to find out more detail </p>
<p>on that work, as well as on the budget to implement the strategy, whether the document </p>
<p>had Iraqi support and what US views were.</p>
<p><b>August 2004</b></p>
<p><b>44. </b> On 2 August, an MNF-I patrol passing near Muqtada al-Sadr’s house in Najaf </p>
<p>came under attack.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Fighting within Najaf escalated and spread to other parts of Iraq, </p>
<p>particularly Baghdad but with sporadic attacks on the MNF-I and ISF in al-Kut, Nasiriyah, </p>
<p>al-Amara and Basra. This upsurge in violence within Shia areas coincided with a wider </p>
<p>deterioration in security in Sunni areas, in particular Samarra and Mosul.</p>
<p><b>45. </b> In a meeting with General George Casey, Commander of the Multi-National Force </p>
<p>– Iraq, and Lieutenant General John McColl, his deputy and the Senior British Military </p>
<p>Representative – Iraq (SBMR-I), on 4 August, Prime Minister Allawi thought it was </p>
<p>essential “to act decisively against the insurgency”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> He commissioned an analysis of </p>
<p>the areas where the IIG and MNF-I could “match strength against insurgency weakness” </p>
<p>to achieve success. That should focus on Fallujah, Ramadi, Samarra, North Babil, </p>
<p>Baqubah and Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> On 4 August, Secretary Powell told Mr Straw that he judged the situation in Sunni </p>
<p>areas to be:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>404</p>
<p>“… worse than many understood. It was indigenous, self-generating and run by </p>
<p>highly sophisticated and intelligent individuals capable of shifting their strategy in </p>
<p>response to developments on the ground.” </p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>47. </b> In a report on 5 August, the British Embassy Baghdad observed that “there is an </p>
<p>Iraqi face being put on the operation” and that providing strong Iraqi leaders to take over </p>
<p>once the MNF-I had played its part was Gen Casey’s condition for MNF-I involvement.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Also on 5 August Mr Simon Collis, British Consul General in Basra, reported that the </p>
<p>detention on 3 August of four members of the Office of the Martyr Sadr had increased </p>
<p>tension between the Sadrist militia and the MNF-I in Basra City, Maysan and Nasiriyah.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>49. </b> The tension was such that Mr Collis reported “there is a fair probability of mortar </p>
<p>attack attempts on British bases tonight, possibly including our Consulate”.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> A report from Baghdad on the same day recorded heavy fighting in Najaf between </p>
<p>the MNF-I and Sadrist militia plus an insurgent attack on the police in Mosul.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p><b>51. </b> In order to show that the IIG was in charge of the situation, Prime Minister Allawi </p>
<p>planned to announce the introduction of the death penalty, and to take steps to manage </p>
<p>media coverage.</p>
<p><b>52. </b> On 6 August, Mr John Sawers, FCO Director General Political, chaired a meeting of </p>
<p>senior officials to discuss developments in Iraq.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>53. </b> On security, the meeting was told that:</p>
<p>“There had been a spike in attacks in the last 48 hours. MOD’s initial assessment </p>
<p>was that the security situation was not yet unmanageable and that it probably did </p>
<p>not represent a single, co-ordinated, plan. It was important that the MNF was </p>
<p>measured in its response and did not undermine progress towards the Iraqiisation </p>
<p>of security tasks.”</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told the meeting that Mr Blair was concerned that </p>
<p>neither an Iraqi security strategy nor an MNF-I internal review of the Iraqiisation process </p>
<p>had yet appeared.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The security strategy was particularly important for demonstrating publicly that the </p>
<p>IIG had a plan to tackle the security situation. The FCO was instructed to press Prime </p>
<p>Minister Allawi on the importance of issuing a public statement soon.</p>

<p>405</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Mr Asquith, FCO Director Iraq, reported on 9 August that Prime Minister Allawi </p>
<p>understood the need to explain the IIG’s strategy on security, “but does not think the </p>
<p>National Security Strategy document fits the bill”.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Prime Minister Allawi had however agreed the need to sort out the details quickly </p>
<p>with the MNF-I. He envisaged “a statement setting out the security strategy in detail – </p>
<p>including with numbers, timelines and objectives for what the government planned to </p>
<p>achieve”, to be issued shortly before the National Conference planned for mid-August.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> The JIC assessed the recent upsurge of violence in Shia areas on 11 August and </p>
<p>judged that:</p>
<p>“The scale of the violence has not matched the intensity or breadth of the attacks </p>
<p>in April, nor have there been indications of wider public support for al-Sadr and </p>
<p>his militia.”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>59. </b> In Najaf and elsewhere the Mahdi Army was:</p>
<p>“… resisting strongly … and continues to pose a significant threat to Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government political and security objectives … [It] has proven, again, to be capable </p>
<p>of generating widespread attacks across central and southern Iraq and reinforcing </p>
<p>vulnerable points when needed.”</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Although the JIC assessed that violence in Sunni areas presented “the more </p>
<p>enduring challenge”, Shia violence was “providing a serious test of strength” to </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi’s Government.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“The position of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, receiving medical treatment in the UK, </p>
<p>is not clear and his absence may have weakened a potential moderating influence </p>
<p>on all sides.”</p>
<p><b>62. </b> The JIC judged that the exact degree of Iranian involvement in recent events </p>
<p>was unclear, but Iran was providing “encouragement, funding and possibly arms to </p>
<p>the Mahdi Army”.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> A message from Mr Asquith in Baghdad on 11 August suggested that, although </p>
<p>its instinct was to take decisive military action in Najaf, the IIG had been persuaded to </p>
<p>delay, at least until after the National Conference on 15 August.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> Planning was under </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>406</p>
<p><b>64. </b> A subsequent telegram from Mr Collis highlighted that “any attack on the holy sites </p>
<p>is liable to have a major and lasting impact across the South”.</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> That risk could be </p>
<p>mitigated by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making the operation an ISF, rather than MNF-I, one with Prime Minister Allawi </p>
<p>fronting political and media operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>explaining the purpose of such action to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani and </p>
<p>Mr Kofi Annan, UN Secretary General;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>launching a major humanitarian operation in Najaf; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-launching economic reconstruction across the South.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Maj Gen Rollo supported all of those points.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Collis advised that “high level contact from London to take Allawi and the </p>
<p>Americans through our concerns” would make sense.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> A discussion between Cabinet Office and No.10 officials on 11 August concluded:</p>
<p>“The <b>security situation</b> was bad, both in the Sunni and Shia areas. While the </p>
<p>fighting in Shia areas currently had greater profile, the problems in the Sunni areas </p>
<p>were more strategically significant … The policy question was how we suggested </p>
<p>Allawi should deal with the problems, particularly in Najaf. Generally, the view of </p>
<p>the meeting was that action did need to be taken against Muqtada al-Sadr (MAS), </p>
<p>but that there were significant risks, military and political, which would need to be </p>
<p>managed … If they [the ISF] were not ready, any operation risked either failing or </p>
<p>drawing in coalition forces.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>68. </b> Officials also observed that “while <b>Allawi</b> was performing relatively well, the Iraqi </p>
<p>Interim Government (IIG) remained highly dependent on him for drive and direction”.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> On 11 August, a briefing paper for Mr Blair in advance of a telephone call with </p>
<p>President Bush stated that, while the main strategic challenge remained the violence </p>
<p>in the Sunni areas, the immediate issue was addressing the situation in Najaf and its </p>
<p>spread across southern Iraq.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Muqtada al-Sadr remained a threat that would need to be “dealt with … probably </p>
<p>sooner rather than later” although he was not considered to pose a strategic threat as </p>
<p>he had earlier in the year.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> The brief said that any decision to deal with Muqtada al-Sadr was for Prime Minister </p>
<p>Allawi to take, and the MNF-I would need to support that decision. It seemed likely that </p>
<p>no action would be taken before the National Conference. The brief suggested that </p>

<p>Mr Blair should voice UK concern that Iran was encouraging, financing and possibly </p>

<p><b>72. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by telephone later that day and said that the </p>
<p>UK considered that the Iranians were at least encouraging and funding Muqtada al-Sadr, </p>
<p>and might be sending him arms.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> He was aware that the US did not entirely share </p>
<p>that assessment.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, the Iranians were concerned that they would be the next </p>
<p>target for US military action and were therefore concluding that they should make life </p>
<p>more difficult for the US in Iraq. He intended to send a personal message to Iran via </p>
<p>Mr Richard Dalton, British Ambassador to Iran, making clear that no-one was talking </p>
<p>about invading Iran, but that if they “misbehaved” on Iraq then “things would only get </p>
<p>more difficult for them”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> From 15 to 18 August a National Conference was held to select an Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>National Council (IINC) of 100 members to oversee the IIG until the election of the </p>

<p>36</p>
<p> The Conference included a wide </p>
<p>range of Iraqis: representatives of political parties, the religious hierarchy, tribes, the </p>
<p>regions and civil society.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported that three methods were put forward at the </p>
<p>Conference for selecting the members of the IINC:</p>
<p>“… a slate system of complete lists of 81 names, the UN’s proportional </p>
<p>representation based on the make up of the conference (which would favour the </p>
<p>established political parties) and a caucus system requiring delegates to form ad hoc </p>
<p>groupings receiving one Council seat for every 13 delegates in the group.”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>76. </b> Delegates opted for the slate system, by a “clear majority”.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> The IPU assessed the conference as:</p>
<p>“… a qualified success. That it took place, despite the security situation, was an </p>
<p>achievement. It generated a great deal of interest … and included some vigorous </p>
<p>debates. And it succeeded in selecting a broadly representative 100 member </p>
<p>National Council, 26 percent of whom are women. It did not, however, succeed </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>408</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. The number of attacks against the Multinational Force and Iraqi targets has </p>
<p>now matched the previous highest level in April. There is no sign of an early </p>
<p>improvement.</p>
<p>II. The confrontation in Najaf has become a test of credibility for Allawi and the IIG. </p>
<p>Allawi will have to tread a fine line between acting before the conditions for success </p>
<p>are right and delaying too long and appearing weak, unless al-Sadr backs down. </p>
<p>Iraqi forces will be heavily reliant on broader US military support.”</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The CIG judged that even if a negotiated settlement was agreed, a residual Shia </p>
<p>insurgency would probably persist, and that:</p>
<p>“The Shia violence has tended to obscure the fact that attacks in Sunni areas have </p>
<p>also continued unabated. Large areas in a number of Sunni cities remain under </p>
<p>insurgent control. This will continue to be the most serious long-term security </p>
<p>problem for the IIG.”</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The CIG recorded that a British journalist, Mr James Brandon, had been kidnapped </p>
<p>by JAM in Basra. Mr Brandon was released shortly afterwards, but kidnappings </p>
<p>continued.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The CIG assessed that the “mixed performance” of the ISF had been highlighted </p>
<p>in Shia areas. In Basra the police chief was reported to be “in league with the militants </p>
<p>and elements of the Iraqi police were involved in the kidnapping of the British journalist”. </p>
<p>In al-Amara the police chief had agreed not to interfere in JAM activities because of </p>
<p>“police concern about their own vulnerability rather than support for al-Sadr”.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> On 19 August, Maj Gen Rollo reported:</p>
<p>“There has been a significant mood change over the past week and a marked </p>
<p>deterioration in the security situation in the South East … In the week up to August </p>
<p>15, the number of hostile incidents aimed specifically against multi-national forces </p>
<p>in this area showed an increase of 300 percent over the previous peak in April 2004. </p>
<p>These attacks have become more sophisticated and more lethal.” </p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Maj Gen Rollo attributed the rise in attacks to “tensions and confrontation” in Najaf, </p>
<p>and commented that:</p>
<p>“A pause or reduced tension in Najaf will have immediate and positive effects in the </p>
<p>South. However, it will not solve the problem here. There will remain an irreducible </p>
<p>number of militant sympathisers who will wish to attack and intimidate. I intend to </p>
<p>tighten the screw on the militants and exploit every opportunity to re-occupy ground </p>
<p>in Basra and elsewhere by resuming the visible patrolling that we had reduced </p>
<p>in number and intensity on transfer of authority at the end of June … There is no </p>

<p>evidence of widespread or deep support for Muqtada, in the police or the population </p>
<p>at large. Their loyalties have come under pressure as they watch the events unfold </p>
<p>in Najaf …”</p>
<p><b>85. </b> On 20 August, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote to the Overseas and Defence </p>
<p>Secretariat of the Cabinet Office to commission a:</p>
<p>“… full picture of the situation in Iraq after the National Conference, how we are </p>
<p>going to get from here to successful elections in January, and the challenges we </p>
<p>will face.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>86. </b> Mr Phillipson’s letter followed a “long discussion” the previous day with Mr Blair, </p>
<p>who had observed that the security situation and the slow rate at which the ISF were </p>
<p>being trained and equipped presented a real risk to the achievement of the UK’s </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq. Mr Blair had indicated that he wanted to discuss Iraq strategy with </p>
<p>President Bush “soon”.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra remained “in lock-down, with a twice daily </p>
<p>helicopter service to the airport”.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Mr Ali A Allawi recorded in his book on the Occupation of Iraq that Grand Ayatollah </p>
<p>al-Sistani brokered a solution to the violence in Najaf and Kufa.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> The five point </p>
<p>agreement he negotiated with Muqtada al-Sadr on 26 August called for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demilitarisation of Najaf and the nearby city of Kufa and the withdrawal of all </p>
<p>armed groups;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>responsibility for maintaining law and order in the two cities to be handed to the </p>
<p>Iraqi police;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>withdrawal of all foreign forces from the two cities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>compensation by the Iraqi Government for all victims of the violence; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>completion of a census as the basis of general elections to restore complete </p>
<p>Iraqi sovereignty.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> According to Mr Allawi:</p>
<p>“Muqtada couched his climbdown in terms of submission to the demands of the </p>
<p>highest religious authority. The Interim Government had no choice but to accept the </p>
<p>terms of the agreement …”</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Mr Allawi judged that, although all the key players claimed some part in the success </p>
<p>in reaching agreement, Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, by demonstrating his control over the </p>
<p>Shia, emerged the “only clear winner”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>410</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The Iraq Senior Officials Group on 27 August was told that:</p>
<p>“… we should not assume the problems with Muqtada Al Sadr (MAS) and his </p>
<p>militias had been solved. In particular, there was no way of enforcing their </p>
<p>agreement to disarm.” </p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>92. </b> In response to the 20 August commission from Mr Blair’s Private Secretary, the </p>
<p>IPU provided a paper on 27 August which contained “little new in policy terms”.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>93. </b> The paper concluded that the strategy agreed by DOP in July remained the right </p>
<p>one but would need regular fine tuning.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> Drawing on a letter from Mr Alan Charlton, British Chargé d’Affaires Washington, </p>
<p>the IPU also advised that President Bush was “letting US officials in Baghdad make the </p>
<p>running” and that the UK should focus its effort with the President on a few issues where </p>
<p>Washington could make a difference, specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keeping the elections on course;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IIG outreach to the regions;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring that the US did not take reconstruction in the South for granted; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security Sector Reform.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The IPU paper also included a description of the key risks, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued security problems;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparations for elections falling further behind schedule and pressure from the </p>
<p>IIG to postpone them; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of communications support for the IIG.</p>
<p><b>96. </b> The Private Secretary’s covering minute to Mr Blair suggested that the IPU’s </p>
<p>paper was “too vague”, did not reflect the deteriorating security situation in Basra and </p>
<p>elsewhere and did not offer a clear way forward.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> He recalled that Mr Blair had asked </p>
<p>for the “unvarnished truth so that we can engage in a frank discussion about how we can </p>
<p>help the IIG restore control”.</p>
<p><b>97. </b> After discussing the paper with Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Antony Phillipson </p>
<p>(Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs) recommended that a new paper should </p>
<p>be commissioned, broken into three sections:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to ensure that the elections took place, on time, in January 2005;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how the Sunni triangle could be brought “back under control”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how order could be restored in Basra.</p>

<p>411</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Within each section, the issues of Iraqiisation and governance should be </p>
<p>“mainstreamed” and answers provided on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether Iraqiisation really was on track and, if not, what could be done; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to build up capacity within the IIG to govern.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> Mr Phillipson noted that although the UK had an enormous stake in getting these </p>
<p>issues right, it did not have direct control over the levers. Prime Minister Allawi therefore </p>
<p>remained “the key”.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> On 29 August Mr Blair set out his analysis of the issues in a minute to Sir Nigel, </p>
<p>Mr Jonathan Powell, his Private Secretary and a junior member of his No.10 staff.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“The situation is self-evidently serious. But two basic elements remain valid:</p>
<p>“We are trying to help Iraq become what most Iraqis want it to be; and the FRE </p>
<p>and extremists are trying to stop us …</p>
<p>“Iraq has therefore become the battleground for the future of the region: does it </p>
<p>go benign, showing Muslim and Arab nations can embrace the modern world; or </p>
<p>descend into a mixture of religious fanaticism and brutality that only brutal dictators </p>
<p>or even less than brutal dictators can manage? …</p>
<p>“Our strategy is fine in one sense: Iraqiisation of security and support for the </p>
<p>democratic political process. The problem is that the urgency of the situation may </p>
<p>overwhelm us and make our timelines for Iraqiisation naïve.</p>
<p>“The fact is Allawi needs help now; and there has to be a clear sense of our gripping </p>
<p>the situation now.”</p>
<p><b>101. </b> Mr Blair listed things that should be done, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing “first-class political, media and strategic capability … now” to support </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi, drawing on “the best home-grown Iraqi talent” supported </p>
<p>by “our own people” who should be “hand-picked” immediately;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>examining DFID’s assistance to key Iraqi ministries, in particular defence, “to </p>
<p>ensure real robustness and … if necessary, our people put in”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring Prime Minister Allawi had immediate access to “strong, well-armed </p>
<p>brigades who can move into any trouble-spot and clean up”, with “commanders </p>
<p>in the field whose loyalty and that of their troops is clear”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>unblocking funding for reconstruction, which was “key to winning hearts and </p>

<p><b>102. </b> Mr Blair also wrote that the UK should make clear that “we aren’t going </p>
<p>anywhere until the job is done, i.e. we aren’t going to be defeated. Period.” </p>
<p>He concluded his minute:</p>
<p>“When I meet Allawi in September, it should be with a coherent plan to change  </p>
<p>the situation.”</p>
<p><b>103. </b> In a telephone call with President Bush on 31 August, Mr Blair said he was </p>
<p>concerned that Prime Minister Allawi “was not getting exactly what he needed in terms </p>
<p>of help to strengthen his political and communications strategies”.</p>

<p><b>104. </b> At its meeting on 1 September the JIC discussed the prospects for the IIG up </p>
<p>to the election in January 2005, at the request of the FCO.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The JIC assessed that the IIG’s agenda had so far been dominated by security, </p>
<p>particularly the uprising in Najaf. Now that the situation there appeared to have </p>
<p>been resolved, the way seemed clear for Prime Minister Allawi to focus on the Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency which remained “the main longer-term problem”.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Prime Minister Allawi had already passed emergency legislation, including a limited </p>
<p>amnesty, and re-introduced the death penalty but his attempts to engage the Sunni </p>
<p>insurgents directly had only limited success. The security situation was continuing to </p>
<p>hamper reconstruction, which in turn was undermining public confidence in the IIG.</p>
<p><b>107. </b> The JIC’s view was that the political timetable for the January 2005 elections </p>
<p>was ambitious given the prevailing security environment, with extremists on all sides </p>
<p>“certain to attempt to disrupt proceedings”. Although postponement was likely to suit the </p>
<p>IIG, the JIC judged that “any significant delay would provoke confrontation with Sistani </p>
<p>and risk unrest”.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The JIC’s analysis of the composition of the Iraqi Interim National Council is set out </p>
<p>in the table below. The JIC made clear the figures were simplistic and should be treated </p>
<p>with caution. There was considerable overlap between the groups; in particular, most </p>
<p>members also had some tribal or provincial affiliation in addition to their association with </p>

<p>“… encouraged by the fact that anti-Muqtada forces and moderates (the majority) </p>
<p>have been strengthened by what they consider to be the submission of Muqtada </p>
<p>al-Sadr to the rightful religious authority. Should his militia return arbitrarily to </p>
<p>confrontation, I am confident that there will be greater resistance from the Iraqis </p>
<p>themselves, and greater support to us in acting firmly against threats to stability.” </p>

<p><b>112. </b> On 2 September, an assessment of resistance to the coalition in Iraq was provided </p>

<p>Director General Defence and Intelligence.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“… the Sunni resistance remains the greatest threat to the political process … </p>
<p>Their movement is facilitated by US military disengagement from the centres of key </p>
<p>Sunni cities (Fallujah, Samarra, Ramadi, Ba’qubah) … Attacks in the Sunni triangle </p>
<p>and Baghdad remain at a high level. Fatalities amongst the ISF, who have assumed </p>

<p>“In the wake of the Najaf crisis … the Sadrists are down but not out … Since the </p>

<p>weapons for future use. Our conclusion is that despite the recently brokered truce </p>
<p>with the Sadrists in Basra and al-Sadr’s proclaimed determination to follow a political </p>
<p>path, the threat to British forces remains high. Post-handover, our ability to disrupt </p>
<p>it unilaterally is curtailed but … there may be opportunities to work with the Iraqis to </p>
<p>neutralise elements of the Sadrist militia leadership.”</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Maj Gen Rollo reported to Air Chief Marshal Glenn Torpy, the Chief of Joint </p>

<p>52</p>
<p> There </p>
<p>had been:</p>
<p>“… no hostile incidents of note over the past week in MND(SE), and on some days </p>
<p>there have been no hostile incidents at all. Just as the confrontation in Najaf ramped </p>

<p><b>115. </b> On 9 September, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr David Quarrey (a Private Secretary </p>
<p>to Mr Blair) sent Mr Blair a minute reporting their recent visit to Iraq, for use in Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>planned video conference with President Bush.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Sir Nigel and Mr Quarrey reported that they had:</p>
<p>“… heard a range of views on the key issues (Americans mostly more optimistic, </p>
<p>Brits and Allawi less so.) We have heard some impressive numbers … but we have </p>
<p>heard such numbers before, and delivery is far from certain. The only safe prediction </p>
<p>is that the going will continue to be very tough.”</p>
<p><b>117. </b> Sir Nigel and Mr Quarrey explained that a “joined up programme was needed” </p>
<p>and highlighted:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ongoing development of an effective counter-insurgency strategy to “regain </p>
<p>control of cities in the Sunni triangle”. The ISF would lead the exercises, but </p>
<p>would require significant MNF-I support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Continued Iraqiisation of security forces which could take until well into 2006; </p>
<p>further progress would require “the NSC [National Security Council] and Number </p>
<p>Ten … to be all over these issues” to keep the pressure up.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The lack of a worked-out IIG strategy for Sunni outreach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The logistical challenge of elections, and the likelihood that candidates would </p>
<p>“pronounce on the timing of the departure of the MNF”.</p>

<p>(Mr Nicholas Cannon, a former Assistant Private Secretary to Mr Blair) and </p>
<p>communications (Mr Charles Heatly).</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Sir Nigel and Mr Quarrey recommended that the key message for Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>conversation with President Bush should be “this is a decisive period for our joint </p>
<p>mission in Iraq” and that the UK and US must:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hold firm on January elections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keep up pressure for delivery on Iraqiisation and reconstruction; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>119. </b> During his visit, Sir Nigel met Prime Minister Allawi, who expressed concern about </p>
<p>the capacity of Iraqi Security Forces, which “needed more help from the UK”.</p>
<p>54</p>

<p>that on a recent visit to Baghdad and Basra he had been able to “feel the difference” </p>
<p>since the transfer of sovereignty.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> Sunni outreach was needed in the South, where the </p>
<p>mood was one of “persistent victimisation”. Reconstruction activity was continuing, but </p>
<p>had been adversely affected by the security situation.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Summing up the Cabinet discussion, Mr Blair said that the coalition must send </p>
<p>strong signals that it would stay in Iraq until the job was done, so that the Iraqi people </p>
<p>would not fear abandonment. Those opposing the coalition through terrorism had </p>
<p>“a clear strategy to plunge the country into chaos” but:</p>
<p>“It was a fallacy to see the only alternatives for political control as brutal dictatorship </p>
<p>or religious fundamentalism and we needed to be as clear-headed in our strategic </p>
<p>aims as were the terrorists in theirs.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> During a video conference with President Bush on 9 September, Mr Blair raised </p>
<p>both the need to accelerate Iraqiisation and for enhanced capacity within the IIG, without </p>
<p>which “too much fell on Allawi himself”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> The existing timelines for improved security and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p><b>124. </b> Sir Nigel highlighted the need to focus on the timing of the MNF-I’s eventual </p>
<p>withdrawal, which would become an increasingly important issue in the run up to the </p>
<p>Iraqi election. He recommended that the UK should look at options and feed views into </p>
<p>Gen Casey and Lt Gen McColl, who intended to discuss the issue with Prime Minister </p>
<p>Allawi in the autumn.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Sir Nigel praised the skill and commitment of the UN team he met in Iraq, but </p>
<p>observed that the electoral timetable remained “incredibly tight” and that the Iraqi public </p>
<p>did not yet have any information about the election. In his view, “a broad electoral </p>
<p>coalition containing secular Shia, moderate Sunnis and Kurds is the best guarantee, </p>
<p>if it wins, of Iraq holding together in the years ahead, and of reducing Iranian influence”.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Reflecting on the level and reliability of information available about Iraq, Sir Nigel </p>
<p>wrote “there is still a tendency … to talk things up or … take the sage position that things </p>
<p>take time and we have to be realistic”. Sir Nigel concluded the report by saying:</p>
<p>“Compared with my visit last November, the security situation has got much worse </p>
<p>and there is a greater sense of disconnect between the Green Zone and the rest </p>
<p>of Iraq. It is difficult to be sure of one’s judgements; and Iraq in any case continues </p>
<p>to be the land of lies. The interim period is inherently unstable, as we always knew. </p>
<p>But if we can get through it and hold respectable elections on time, that would be an </p>
<p>incredible achievement; and the prognosis then should lighten.”</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald closed his visit report of 13 September by saying to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“To achieve the level of engagement we need, we will need your help in keeping </p>
<p>Whitehall up to the mark – there are definite signs of Iraq fatigue. Ditto the </p>
<p>Americans.”</p>
<p><b>128. </b> On 14 September, Maj Gen Rollo wrote “MND (SE) continues to experience a </p>
<p>period of calm. Incidents are running at about four or five a week, the lowest figure since </p>
<p>January and February.” </p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>129. </b> On 15 September, Mr Blair spoke by video conference to Mr Chaplin and </p>
<p>Lt Gen McColl in Baghdad.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> Lt Gen McColl reported that he “expected to see continuing </p>
<p>high levels of activity in the coming months” and that the insurgency was becoming </p>
<p>better co-ordinated with “no shortage of finance or volunteers”.</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Lt Gen McColl told Mr Blair that Iraq Security Forces would not be able to take full </p>
<p>responsibility for security before 2006. Mr Chaplin emphasised the need for economic </p>
<p>and political progress, to create a “less benign environment for the insurgents”. Mr Blair </p>
<p>agreed, and observed:</p>
<p>“We would not be able to deliver on the political and economic tracks without getting </p>
<p>on top of the security situation.”</p>

<p><b>131. </b> At the request of the FCO, two JIC Assessments in September considered the </p>
<p>degree to which Iran was interfering in Iraq and supporting Al Qaida or Sunni extremist </p>
<p>groups.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> The JIC assessed that:</p>
<p>“Iran has many legitimate interests in the future of Iraq, which it regards as vital to </p>
<p>its security … It wants the multinational forces to depart, so long as chaos does not </p>
<p>result … While it does not expect, and is not pushing for, a government in Iraq on </p>
<p>the Iranian model, it does want a regime in which the Iraqi Shia – especially those </p>
<p>amenable to Iranian influence – have significant representation and real power. </p>
<p>We judge that Iran wants to maximise its influence in Iraq, but also to hedge against </p>
<p>an outcome which marginalises it or its main Iraqi allies. Consequently, it continues </p>
<p>its efforts to build links with a wide range of Iraqi individuals, groups and political </p>
<p>parties, including some outside the mainstream … Hardliners may also fear the </p>
<p>implications for Iran of having a successful democracy in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>132. </b> The JIC assessed that there had been a “shift for the worse in Iranian posture and </p>
<p>tactics”, specifically that there was some support from within Iran for Shia insurgents </p>
<p>in southern Iraq, including the provision of finance and weapons for al-Sadr’s recent </p>
<p>uprising in Najaf, although there was “no sign of a wide-scale Shia insurgency”. The JIC </p>
<p>judged that “any direct Iranian support to the Sunni insurgency … is likely to be relatively </p>
<p>narrow in scope” and that:</p>
<p>“The Sunni extremist presence in Iran is substantial, and comprises members of </p>
<p>several groups in addition to Al Qaida. Some of these jihadists … are allowed by </p>
<p>the Iranian authorities to operate in comparative freedom.”</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Sir John Scarlett, Chairman of the JIC between 2001 and 2004, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that there was a marked contrast in the degree to which Iran appeared to be involved in </p>
<p>Iraq between April 2004 and September 2004.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> In April, the JIC was confident that Iran </p>
<p>was not behind the Sadrist attacks on coalition forces in Najaf; but by September the </p>
<p>assessment was “very significantly tougher”.</p>
<p><b>134. </b> Mr Tim Dowse, Chief of the Assessments Staff from 2003 to 2009, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that the JIC had spent a lot of time trying to work out what the Iranians were doing in </p>
<p>Iraq, but had “started this whole period with a reluctance to see an Iranian hand”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>135. </b> The JIC felt that “the Iranians had at least a twin track policy, and probably more </p>
<p>than that, more than two tracks”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>136. </b> In SIS1’s view, Iran did not have a strong interest in a stable Middle East and had </p>
<p>been willing to provide support to the insurgents, both Shia and Sunni, because “if they </p>
<p>could cause trouble for the coalition, they would”.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>137. </b> On 16 September, Mr Blair chaired a meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on </p>
<p>Iraq, called “to ensure the UK government approach to Iraq was fully co-ordinated in the </p>
<p>period up to Iraqi elections in January 2005”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> He intended that the Group should meet </p>
<p>regularly.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Mr Blair’s Chairman’s Brief stated that one purpose of the meeting was to:</p>
<p>“… <b>galvanise the key departments</b> and ensure they give Iraq their full attention </p>
<p>in the next five months, in order to <b>achieve the necessary results on the ground </b></p>
<p><b>in the run-up to elections</b>.” </p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Given an insurgency that appeared to be increasingly co-ordinated, Mr Blair told </p>
<p>the Group that he was “concerned that the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) did not have </p>
<p>sufficient capability to take on the insurgents”.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>140. </b> General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, reported that plans were in </p>
<p>place for the ISF to be fully equipped and trained by mid-2005, but that their capabilities </p>
<p>would remain limited, especially compared to the MNF-I. There was little scope for </p>
<p>accelerating the plans.</p>
<p><b>141. </b> In discussion, members of the Group observed that the insurgency in the Sunni </p>
<p>triangle was the most serious security threat facing Iraq and that the UK needed a better </p>
<p>understanding of the US/Iraqi campaign plan to tackle it.</p>
<p><b>142. </b> The Group agreed that the MOD, DFID and the FCO would produce specific </p>
<p>suggestions for how progress could be made in Iraq which Mr Blair could put to </p>
<p>President Bush when they next spoke:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD to make recommendations on how ISF capacity will develop and what </p>
<p>more we can do to accelerate or refine the delivery to allow the ISF to tackle the </p>
<p>current insurgency campaign.</p>

<p><b>143. </b> Mr Blair and Prime Minister Allawi met in London on 19 September.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Prime Minister Allawi said that tackling the security situation was his top priority, </p>
<p>but he lacked effective resources to do it: he needed two mechanised divisions, a rapid </p>
<p>deployment force, an effective anti-terrorist capability in the police and a more rapid build </p>
<p>up of intelligence capability.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Security was Prime Minister Allawi’s personal focus, but was part of wider work on </p>
<p>an overall strategy addressing national reconciliation and Sunni outreach, building the </p>
<p>economy and building up the institutions of government and the state.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Mr Blair confirmed the offer of staff from No.10 to provide practical support to </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi in setting up his office. The two men agreed that they needed </p>
<p>to develop a channel that would enable them to ensure the reform programme was </p>
<p>implemented. Mr Blair would need to know Prime Minister Allawi’s priorities week by week, </p>
<p>for discussion in the UK system and with the Americans. Mr Blair observed that “contact </p>
<p>with President Bush was essential in order to get pressure from the top in Washington”.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Following the meeting, Sir Nigel Sheinwald commissioned advice from Lt Gen </p>
<p>McColl on how best to meet Prime Minister Allawi’s urgent requirement for mechanised </p>
<p>forces, a rapid deployment capability, counter-terrorist police and intelligence.</p>
<p><b>148. </b> In response to the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group’s 16 September commissions, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary provided two papers on 20 September: one on the current </p>
<p>status of the ISF (including the Petraeus Plan and recommendations for further work) </p>
<p>and a speaking note for the conversation with President Bush.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> These are described </p>
<p>in detail in Section 12.1.</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair to answer the third commission.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> He advised that:</p>
<p>“To succeed in the elections Allawi needs to decide on his coalition; agree a vision </p>
<p>and sell it in all parts of the country; and form a campaign apparatus straight away.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, DFID Director, Iraq, wrote to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>He explained that Gen Casey had been briefed on the ideas in the paper, but the text </p>
<p>had not been shared with the US.</p>
<p><b>152. </b> Lt Gen McColl advised that planning in Baghdad within the MNF-I had highlighted </p>
<p>the need for “coalition members to be clear about their desired national end-states” </p>
<p>and there were “indications that January 2006 could be the point at which the desired </p>
<p>national end-states of US and UK diverge”. He understood that the US was considering </p>
<p>a significant draw down over the next 15 months, from 17 brigades to between three and </p>
<p>seven, which was likely to result in a request for the UK to take control of areas beyond </p>
<p>MND(SE) in early 2005.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> The US planning team considering the options for MNF-I distribution had been </p>
<p>unaware of the UK’s national commitments in 2006, which Lt Gen McColl described </p>
<p>as “the possible deployment of the ARRC [Allied Rapid Reaction Corps] and the shift </p>
<p>of the UK’s medium-scale commitment to Afghanistan”. That illustrated the need to be </p>
<p>clear about the UK’s strategic intentions.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Lt Gen McColl observed:</p>
<p>“Should the UK decide that its national interests are best served by remaining close </p>
<p>to US policy on Iraq beyond January 2006, UK policy makers must be under no </p>
<p>illusion as to the nature of the growing insurgency, and the risks and challenges that </p>
<p>any long-term deployment of UK forces would present … The Iraqi insurgency has </p>
<p>reached the point where it is now capable of sustaining itself … for several years </p>
<p>… Put simply, the enemy is getting better … Evidence is increasingly emerging … </p>
<p>that the coalition’s presence is the single most important catalyst for this … After the </p>
<p>elections in January 2005 … the value of MNF-I’s continued presence is likely to </p>
<p>come under ever closer scrutiny. It will be important for the international community </p>
<p>… to form a judgement on this. However successful the elections … there will be </p>
<p>a significant insurgency for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p><b>155. </b> A key factor in assessing the need for extended MNF-I presence in Iraq was </p>
<p>the degree to which the ISF could operate without MNF-I support. Lt Gen McColl </p>
<p>commented that although there had been significant progress in developing the ISF </p>
<p>there were capability gaps and a “serious rift” between the Iraqi Ministries of Defence </p>
<p>and Interior. That would need to be addressed if the ISF was to assume full responsibility </p>
<p>for Iraq’s security without putting the country at serious risk.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Lt Gen McColl argued that it was important for the UK:</p>
<p>“… to develop a national exit strategy. This is in no way inconsistent with PM Blair’s </p>
<p>determination to stay the course in Iraq. On the contrary, it places the onus on the </p>
<p>UK defining precisely what is meant by ‘the job is done’.</p>
<p>“Provided the electoral process remains on schedule in 2005, there is much to </p>
<p>commend a withdrawal in early 2006. This is the natural political, legal and (if we do </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.3  |  July 2004 to May 2005</p>
<p>421</p>
<p>our job well) security culminating point. But a failure to build adequate capacity in </p>
<p>the interim would leave the first constitutionally-elected Iraqi government at severe </p>

<p>to combat that insurgency effectively.”</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Lt Gen McColl advised that there were two broad options available to the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>investing “maximum effort” in the 15 months before the end of 2005 to “put in </p>
<p>place the structures, forces and economic benefits that can ensure a successful </p>
<p>outcome” (effectively trained Iraqi security forces, including the police) and then </p>
<p>aiming to withdraw in early 2006; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deciding that the UK would need to make a longer-term commitment to Iraq, </p>
<p>“whether from a desire to ‘see the job through’, to stay alongside the US at all </p>
<p>costs, or for its [the UK’s] own regional policy reasons”, recognising that this </p>
<p>would be against a backdrop of continuing insurgency and attacks on the MNF-I.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Lt Gen McColl did not make a recommendation in favour of either option, but </p>
<p>stressed the need for the UK to come to a decision “in a timely fashion”. In particular, </p>
<p>if the UK was to opt to make a longer-term commitment, it must:</p>
<p>“… go into this with its eyes open and, specifically, must put in place now the force </p>
<p>protection measures required to minimise this risk as far as possible.”</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Lt Gen McColl drew his paper to the attention of Gen Walker the next day, </p>
<p>suggesting that “the time is right for the consideration of the substantive issues”.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p><b>160. </b> In a telephone conversation with President Bush on 24 September, Mr Blair set out </p>
<p>three priority issues, as discussed with Prime Minister Allawi: the need to strengthen his </p>
<p>(Allawi’s) office; accelerating work to show the ISF had capacity to act; and increasing </p>
<p>the pace of development activity.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>161. </b> On 24 September Mr Blair sent a note to Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr David Hill </p>
<p>(Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy), Mr Godric Smith (Mr Blair’s </p>

<p>Government Relations) on what messages they should be feeding into the public </p>
<p>debate on Iraq.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Mr Blair characterised the debate as:</p>
<p>“… have we got the country into a mess and therefore any bad news is our fault; </p>
<p>or is Iraq the battleground whose outcome will determine our own security and </p>
<p>therefore the bad news is worth it in the end?”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Blair listed nine points to be injected into the debate and told his staff “we need </p>
<p>a concerted effort, organised and disciplined, to get this across”.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> The points listed emphasised the presence of “foreign jihadists”, in Iraq since </p>
<p>before March 2003 but increasingly without the support of the Iraqi people. Mr Blair </p>
<p>described Iraq as part of a global counter-terrorism approach to protect the UK’s </p>
<p>security, although this was not the original intention behind the invasion. He rejected </p>
<p>the argument that Iraq increased the terrorist threat, highlighting that 9/11 and other </p>
<p>incidents took place before the war began.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> On 28 September, Mr Blair addressed the Labour Party conference in Brighton.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On Iraq, he said:</p>
<p>“The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, </p>
<p>as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>“I acknowledge that and accept it.</p>
<p>“I simply point out, such evidence was agreed by the whole international community, </p>
<p>not least because Saddam had used such weapons against his own people and </p>
<p>neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>“And the problem is, I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, </p>
<p>but I can’t, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam.”</p>
<p><b>166. </b> Mr Blair told the conference: “The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not </p>
<p>in power.”</p>
<p><b>167. </b> In a video conference in early October, Mr Blair told President Bush that there had </p>
<p>been a debate at the Party Conference, which had been won by 4:1.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> He observed that: </p>
<p>“There had been a number of powerful Iraqi speakers.”</p>
<p><b>168. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald spoke to Dr Rice on 29 September.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Sir Nigel set out his </p>
<p>impression that the tempo of planning and preparation was being increased ready for </p>
<p>an operation in Fallujah.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Dr Rice confirmed that the ground was being prepared, but that no decisions had </p>
<p>been taken. Sir Nigel “accepted that pressure for action in Fallujah was growing” and </p>
<p>“made clear that we would need to return to this once plans had advanced”.</p>

<p>Sunni Arab areas of Iraq, and had been written by the Assessments Staff drawing on </p>
<p>the conclusions of a cross-Whitehall discussion led by the JIC Chair.</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The Assessment stated that:</p>
<p>“Iraqi Sunni Arabs believe they have little to gain from the political process. </p>
<p>A minority (but numbered in many thousands) are involved in armed insurgency. </p>
<p>The majority of Sunni Arabs are likely to sympathise with the insurgents.”</p>
<p><b>172. </b> The Assessments Staff judged that Sunni Arab Iraqis had the same basic interests </p>
<p>as all other Iraqi citizens: security, the provision of services and employment. In addition, </p>
<p>however, they had some specific concerns, in particular loss of status and a real fear </p>
<p>of Shia domination and Iranian influence.</p>
<p><b>173. </b> The paper stated that all the insurgents were united in their resentment of the </p>
<p>presence of foreign forces, and that “their hatred of the US in particular has been </p>
<p>developing since 1990”. Despite these similarities, the underlying motivating factors </p>
<p>were likely to vary between groups:</p>
<p>“<b>Nationalists</b> want to see significant Sunni Arab representation in Iraq’s political </p>
<p>structures. They want a strong Iraq that can resist Iranian threats and Western </p>
<p>oppression. They want to see rulers who represent all Iraq and are not exiles. </p>
<p>They might engage in a political process if they could see it delivering – but they </p>
<p>do not at present have any organised political representation.</p>
<p>“<b>Ba’athists</b> are most resistant to the current political process. They do not all want </p>
<p>Saddam’s return (although some do), but want to regain their position of power. </p>
<p>They want an Iraq dominated by Sunni Arabs loyal to their leadership and able </p>
<p>to check Kurdish and Shia aspirations.</p>
<p>“<b>Islamists</b> view fighting the Occupation as jihad and have a vision of Iraq as a </p>
<p>Sunni Islamic state – they recall Baghdad as the central power during Islam’s </p>
<p>‘Golden Age’ (749-1258). There are a number of organised Sunni Islamist parties. </p>
<p>Neither these nor most Sunni Islamists are engaging with the political process – </p>
<p>but some may be persuaded to do so.</p>
<p>“<b>Disaffected Iraqis</b> and <b>opportunists</b> are motivated more by personal </p>
<p>circumstances than by a strategy for Iraq. They are most likely to be swayed by </p>
<p>visible improvements to their daily lives and political and economic progress. </p>
<p>But their association with more committed insurgents may over time result in </p>
<p>them adopting their agenda.”</p>
<p><b>174. </b> The Assessments Staff judged that:</p>
<p>“… insurgent groups rather than the political process appear to many Sunni Arabs </p>
<p>to be more likely to deliver what they want … If the election has virtually no </p>
<p>Sunni Arab participation and results in little Sunni Arab representation, the </p>

<p>problem will be exacerbated. We judge that at that stage, there could be a risk </p>
<p>of sectarian violence.”</p>
<p><b>Kidnap in Iraq</b></p>
<p>In late September and early October, there was extensive media coverage in Iraq and the </p>
<p>UK of the kidnapping and murder of two UK citizens: Mr Kenneth Bigley, a civil engineer </p>
<p>working under contract on a reconstruction project, and Mrs Margaret Hassan, Iraq </p>
<p>Director of Care International.</p>
<p>A JIC Assessment on 11 November recorded that more than 230 foreigners, and many </p>
<p>more Iraqis, had been kidnapped since March 2003.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> The JIC judged that Islamist </p>
<p>terrorists had been responsible for the majority of the high profile incidents and their </p>
<p>attacks were forcing many organisations to stop working in Iraq.</p>
<p>Mr Bigley was kidnapped in Baghdad on 16 September 2004, along with two of his US </p>
<p>colleagues, Mr Jack Hensley and Mr Eugene Armstrong, both of whom were beheaded </p>
<p>shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>Mr Bigley’s kidnapping prompted the FCO to update its travel advice to say:</p>
<p>“… we urge all British nationals in Iraq to consider whether their presence in Iraq is </p>
<p>essential at this time … Any British nationals in Iraq should, as a matter of urgency, </p>
<p>review their security arrangements and protection and seek professional advice </p>
<p>on whether they are adequate. These arrangements should cover: security at the </p>
<p>workplace, at the place of residence and travel. Where security is not adequate, </p>
<p>British nationals should either immediately move to premises within guarded areas </p>
<p>and avoid unprotected travel outside these more secure areas, or leave Iraq as soon </p>
<p>as possible.”</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>Mr Bigley was beheaded by his captors on 7 October.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>The murders were attributed to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> The JIC had described him in </p>
<p>March 2004 as being “the most important terrorist leader in Iraq”.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>Mr Chaplin reported that the murder had been “universally condemned” in Iraq and that </p>
<p>the “sense of shock was palpable”.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> He went on to note:</p>
<p>“Unfortunately beheading has become all too common. In the last week there have </p>
<p>been at least nine other people who have been beheaded including one woman,  </p>
<p>and a 15 year old Kurdish boy whose body was also burnt.”</p>
<p>Mrs Hassan, who was married to an Iraqi citizen and a long-term resident of the country, </p>
<p>was kidnapped in Baghdad on 19 October.</p>

<p>the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq and the halting of their deployment to Baghdad, </p>
<p>assumed to be a reference to the Black Watch.</p>
<p>Based on video evidence, it was thought probable that Mrs Hassan had been murdered </p>
<p>by her captors in November.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>In the UK one commentator suggested that Mrs Hassan’s kidnapping exposed the </p>
<p>continuing “absence of basic law and order in the Sunni enclaves in central Iraq”.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>fact that Iraqi citizens who had been glad to be rid of Saddam Hussein were now turning </p>
<p>to extremists in the hope of restoring the basic fabric of life was “an indictment of the way </p>
<p>the post-Saddam transition has been carried out by the allies: not enough troops on the </p>
<p>ground and an administration content to hide inside the heavily-protected Green Zone”.</p>
<p>The UK’s emergency response mechanism, COBR, was activated in relation to both </p>
<p>kidnappings. Its activities are not described here, both because the Inquiry’s terms of </p>
<p>reference do not cover detailed investigation of individual cases, and in order not to </p>
<p>prejudice COBR’s future work in similar cases.</p>
<p>Sir David Richmond told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I don’t think anybody could have been ignorant of the dangers of living and working </p>
<p>in Iraq at that time … I think that most of the people who went out there would have </p>
<p>been well aware of what the problems were and would only have gone if they had </p>
<p>taken the necessary precautions in terms of their own security …” </p>
<p>90</p>
<p>In an update sent to Gen Walker on 26 September, Lt Gen McColl observed that:</p>
<p>“Kidnapping is ‘headline news’ due to the UK/US hostages. It is however not a spike, </p>
<p>but a constant in Iraq at present, with most kidnaps inspired by monetary gain rather </p>
<p>than being political/terrorist related.” </p>

<p> They would be given three days to do so.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>426</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Lt Gen McColl did not consider Fallujah vital to the conduct of the elections. </p>
<p>Rather, the offensive risked “total Sunni disenfranchisement” and therefore jeopardising </p>
<p>the elections. He was also concerned about potential damage to the cohesion of the </p>
<p>Interim Government and about the resilience of the Iraqi security forces.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> In preparation for a visit to Iraq, the British Embassy Baghdad briefed Mr Straw </p>
<p>that there was “a lively debate, including between us and the Americans locally, about </p>
<p>how and when to deal with Fallujah”.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> The UK view was cautious, “questioning whether </p>
<p>Fallujah can be dealt with quickly and decisively and insisting that we think through </p>
<p>carefully the consequences of military action”.</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Visiting Baghdad on 5 October, Mr Straw found Prime Minister Allawi cautious </p>
<p>about the operation.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>181. </b> Mr Straw recommended to Mr Blair that the UK impress on the Americans </p>
<p>“the need for a thought through military plan, complemented by an Allawi-led political </p>
<p>strategy”.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>182. </b> Lt Gen Fry provided the Chiefs of Staff with a paper for discussion at their meeting </p>
<p>on 6 October which incorporated Lt Gen McColl’s analysis of 23 September.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> In the </p>
<p>paper he sought to define “an achievable and acceptable exit strategy for UK forces </p>
<p>in Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Lt Gen Fry recommended the first option set out by Lt Gen McColl and wrote that </p>
<p>the MOD “should initiate debate across Whitehall arguing that the UK’s policy should </p>
<p>be for the MNF-I to withdraw from Iraq in its current form on expiry of its current UN </p>
<p>mandate”. He warned that failure to persuade the US to that view could leave the UK </p>
<p>with “an unpalatable choice between unilateral withdrawal or an enduring commitment </p>
<p>that runs a high risk of strategic failure and which would severely constrain our strategic </p>
<p>aspirations for N[ATO] R[esponse] F[orce] 6 and Afghanistan in 06”.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> The Chiefs of Staff concluded that the review of the MNF-I’s UN mandate in </p>
<p>mid-2005 “could present a more appropriate opportunity for a wider review with </p>
<p>MNF-I Partners avoiding pre-empting early coalition draw-down decisions”.</p>

<p>“I was struck by the limited UK inputs beyond the relatively quiet South-East. </p>
<p>The Americans are pressing us again to provide troops in the main areas of conflict, </p>
<p>though General McColl saw problems in just putting a British battalion in the middle </p>
<p>of a US division. A better way might be to relieve the US of some areas neighbouring </p>
<p>MND(SE). I think we need to show some flexibility, and possibly increase troop </p>
<p>numbers for a period, if we are to keep a handle on US decisions and, albeit at the </p>
<p>margins, better complement the US effort on the ground. We also need to think </p>
<p>through what we should say about our longer term plans. We shall have to be there </p>
<p>through 2005, but it would play helpfully in Iraq if we and Americans could set a </p>
<p>target date, say Spring 2006, when we would aim to draw down to a much smaller </p>
<p>presence. It would undercut those who say we want to occupy Iraq indefinitely, </p>

<p>domestically. I would like to talk this through with you.”</p>
<p><b>187. </b> Mr William Ehrman, Chairman of the JIC, visited Iraq alongside Mr Straw.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Ehrman reported to Sir Nigel Sheinwald that security in Baghdad was </p>
<p>deteriorating:</p>
<p>“The fact that travel by road between the Green Zone and the airport is not possible </p>
<p>after dusk highlights this. The first IED in the Green Zone was discovered while </p>
<p>I was there. But I nonetheless returned encouraged by the clear efforts of the IIG </p>
<p>to reach out to the Sunni areas. They have not got a group of Sunnis there publicly </p>
<p>to stand up and support the IIG. But they are trying.”</p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Ehrman judged that:</p>
<p>“To mount an assault or not on Fallujah was the issue of the day … Fallujah is no </p>
<p>Najaf or Samarra where there were maybe 500 serious insurgents to deal with. </p>
<p>In Fallujah the estimate is 3-4,000 FRE [Former Regime Elements] and another </p>
<p>500-1,000 foreign fighters …”</p>
<p><b>190. </b> Mr Ehrman also reported that the Head of the UN Election Assistance Mission in </p>
<p>Iraq, Mr Carlos Valenzuela, was “doing a good job on election preparations. Despite lack </p>
<p>of personnel, the technical work is on schedule.”</p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Straw echoed that judgement in his report to Mr Blair, where he wrote:</p>
<p>“I came away reassured that elections in January were still doable, and that the </p>
<p>deadline was helping to force the pace.”</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 10 October, Lt Gen McColl reported to Gen Walker and ACM Torpy on </p>

<p>428</p>
<p>“… the US … do not appear to appreciate that it will be an issue for their coalition </p>
<p>partners and possibly have a substantial impact on the cohesion of the alliance. </p>
<p>We should continue to press for greater clarity at the political level and Warsaw </p>
<p>[a meeting of NATO Defence Ministers] may be an opportunity for this.</p>
<p>“Interwoven with the debate on force posture has been discussion of the potential </p>
<p>value of making an early announcement of the intention to withdraw, prompted by </p>
<p>the SBMR-I paper … Although the potential positive impact on the insurgency is </p>

<p>102</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Lt Gen McColl also reported that the US saw Fallujah as a decisive point in the </p>
<p>campaign and had asked for UK assistance. Following informal discussions between </p>
<p>the US and UK military in Iraq, MND(SE) had concluded that supplying troops to </p>
<p>relieve US forces in North Babil, so that they could participate in action in Fallujah, </p>
<p>was “the most suitable option”.</p>
<p><b>194. </b> The US then made a formal request for the UK to deploy troops to North Babil </p>
<p>for 30 days. Lt Gen McColl advised that the UK’s aspirations to influence the broader </p>

<p><b>196. </b> On 11 October, the FCO submitted to No.10 a paper commissioned by </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald which considered contingency plans if elections were postponed </p>
<p>for six months.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> It had been agreed with the MOD and was copied to SIS and the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> The first half of the paper considered the arguments for and against postponement </p>
<p>of the Iraqi election.</p>
<p><b>198. </b> A shorter, technical delay was considered to be “difficult but manageable” but the </p>
<p>paper described the key elements of managing a longer delay as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi seizing the initiative and using the delay to push a political </p>
<p>solution to the insurgency;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pursuing Sunni outreach;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>an announcement of the phased withdrawal of the MNF-I in 2005; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new resolution, to endorse the changed electoral timetable.</p>
<p><b>199. </b> The FCO wrote that there was no guarantee that the plan would have the desired </p>
<p>impact on the insurgency. The insurgents might conclude they were winning and step </p>
<p>up their campaign, leading to further postponement of elections.</p>
<p><b>200. </b> In the paper the FCO concluded that this was:</p>
<p>“An unappealing contingency plan in almost all respects, underlining the importance </p>
<p>of doing everything we can to hold to Plan A, or, if there is to be a delay in elections, </p>
<p>arguing the case for a short delay, on UN advice, to a fixed date.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> The FCO view was that in order to stay on track, the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure the UN remained engaged, including by supporting the security of </p>
<p>UN staff;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure adequate Sunni outreach;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reduce opposition to the presence of the MNF-I;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani remained supportive; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“sell” the importance of sticking to the January 2005 timetable to Iraqis and the </p>
<p>international community.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The second half of the paper considered a scenario in which the MNF-I reduced </p>
<p>in size before Iraqi Security Forces were capable of maintaining security themselves.</p>
<p><b>203. </b> The FCO judged that, while the insurgents “do not have the military capability to </p>
<p>force the US to withdraw … they could intimidate some coalition partners into leaving”. </p>
<p>Although that would require the US and UK to “make up the numbers”, it was considered </p>
<p>a manageable risk.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> A more significant risk was the emergence of a strong “troops-out faction” in the </p>
<p>Transitional National Assembly, which required members of the MNF-I to stay in their </p>
<p>barracks. With Iraqi Security Forces unable to play their role, different insurgent criminal </p>
<p>or tribal forces would seek to fill the security vacuum:</p>
<p>“In the Sunni triangle it would be the insurgents; in the Kurdish and Shia areas the </p>
<p>established militias … other parts of the country (e.g. Maysan and Dhi Qar) would </p>
<p>be dominated by criminals or tribes (or both) …</p>
<p>“In the worst case scenario, Iraq would disintegrate into civil war.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>430</p>
<p><b>205. </b> The FCO judged that:</p>
<p>“The wider strategic consequences of a worst-case scenario like this would be </p>
<p>appalling:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq would become a long-term source of instability in the region …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq could become a permanent base for Al Qaida and Sunni Islamic terrorism, </p>
<p>further destabilising Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Jihadist elements would declare victory and be strengthened, with significant </p>
<p>implications for the Global War on Terrorism and the prospects for the </p>
<p>Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prospects for reform in the Arab world could be set back a decade.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Having seen the US fail, an increasingly self-confident Iran steps up efforts </p>
<p>to become the major regional power, accelerates its nuclear programme and </p>
<p>triggers a regional arms race.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Instability causes oil prices to rise further.”</p>
<p><b>206. </b> The paper concluded that scenario was a long way off. There was likely to be </p>
<p>scope, even with a significant “troops out majority” in the Transitional National Assembly </p>
<p>(TNA), to negotiate a phased withdrawal to mitigate the risk of a downward spiral.</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The covering letter from Mr Straw’s Private Secretary to Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary highlighted that Prime Minister Allawi might “take the sting out of nationalists’ </p>
<p>and Sunni rejectionists’ grievances that the MNF-I (US presence) represents indefinite </p>
<p>occupation by a different name” by making an announcement about withdrawal in </p>
<p>November. The FCO and MOD would be working on a joint paper for discussion with </p>
<p>the US and then Prime Minister Allawi.</p>
<p><b>208. </b> On 12 October, Mr Hoon wrote to Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, reporting </p>
<p>that the security situation had deteriorated since transfer of sovereignty in June.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>209. </b> While there was no state of armed conflict between the UK and Iraq, the MOD </p>
<p>believed that a state of armed conflict existed between the IIG and certain insurgent </p>
<p>groups within Iraq. In Mr Hoon’s view, international humanitarian law (IHL) would provide </p>
<p>a more appropriate legal framework for UK forces operating within Iraq and he therefore </p>
<p>considered it necessary to activate the dormant provisions of the Targeting Directive </p>
<p>which allowed the Joint Commander to seek Ministerial approval to conduct operations </p>
<p>governed by the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC). That would enable UK forces to engage </p>
<p>certain clearly defined insurgent groups under IHL and would also clarify the position of </p>
<p>UK service personnel embedded in the US command chain.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Her letter drew out the parallels with UK operations in Afghanistan and supplied </p>
<p>a detailed new Targeting Directive modelled on the one in use there.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> In a telegram to the FCO in London on 12 October, Mr Chaplin wrote that he </p>
<p>suspected the ISF would be less ready by the end of October than Iraqi Ministers </p>
<p>were claiming.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>212. </b> Mr Chaplin also reported that Gen Casey had:</p>
<p>“… concluded that a major operation before Ramadan is not possible, but has </p>
<p>produced a hybrid military option to keep up pressure on the insurgency, while </p>
<p>responding to Allawi’s concerns about an Iraqi face on any full scale operations </p>
<p>in Fallujah.”</p>
<p><b>213. </b> In a further telegram the following day, Mr Chaplin supported Lt Gen McColl’s </p>
<p>10 October recommendation that the UK should backfill US troops in North Babil, seeing </p>
<p>it as an opportunity to “make a real contribution to the success of the Fallujah operation” </p>
<p>without joining the operation directly or deploying a battlegroup to Baghdad.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Both Mr Chaplin and Lt Gen McColl recalled the UK’s rejection of two requests </p>
<p>for a deployment beyond MND(SE) over the summer, which had led to criticism and a </p>
<p>sense “that we have a lot to say for ourselves, but that when it really matters – getting </p>
<p>stuck into the insurgency, contributing to SSR acceleration – we prefer to look the other </p>
<p>way” and that “we have it a bit easy in MND(SE)”.</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Chaplin observed that if the UK wanted to retain influence over plans to take </p>
<p>action in other insurgent areas, it needed to “build up a bit of credit”.</p>
<p><b>216. </b> At Cabinet on 14 October Mr Straw’s update on Iraq focused on the need for </p>
<p>more UN effort to support election preparations.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> UN reluctance to deploy more staff </p>
<p>was a result of the attack on its HQ in August 2003. It remained unclear which forces </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>218. </b> At the meeting, Ministers agreed that “the MOD and FCO should provide some </p>
<p>initial thoughts on future force levels”.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> The FCO contingency planning paper was </p>
<p>not discussed.</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Ministers were also briefed that the US military was planning military action </p>
<p>in Fallujah.</p>
<p><b>220. </b> An MOD note provided in advance of the meeting said the US military view </p>
<p>was that if Fallujah was not dealt with, the MNF-I would be unable to control the level </p>
<p>of violence in the run-up to the January elections.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> The US intention was that the </p>
<p>operation should destroy remnants of the former regime, kill or capture Abu Musab </p>
<p>al-Zarqawi, regain the initiative from the insurgents and demonstrate both campaign </p>
<p>progress and the IIG’s resolve.</p>
<p><b>221. </b> The MOD did not agree that ‘solving’ Fallujah was a prerequisite for holding </p>
<p>successful elections, which were unlikely to happen in the city in any case. The UK </p>
<p>view was that the operation carried a very high risk of unifying the insurgency, acting </p>
<p>as a trigger for Shia violence, “over-facing” the ISF and so delaying Iraqiisatiion, </p>
<p>endangering UN support for the elections and undermining coalition cohesion.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> Ministers agreed that an operation to clear Fallujah was right in principle but the </p>
<p>UK should try to persuade the US to give Prime Minister Allawi time to improve the </p>
<p>political environment.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>223. </b> Mr Blair was recorded as saying that the UK’s overarching political and military </p>
<p>objective was to create a security situation that allowed elections to be held in an </p>
<p>environment which gave Prime Minister Allawi a good chance of fielding a winning slate.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Blair raised the formal US request for a UK deployment to North Babil.</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Gen Walker told the Group that the UK had the capability to meet the US request. </p>
<p>Although North Babil was a more dangerous area of operations than MND(SE), this </p>
<p>was a militarily less demanding request than the UK had faced in the past or might </p>
<p>face in the future. But it seemed unlikely that the 30 day timescale for the deployment </p>
<p>would hold.</p>
<p><b>226. </b> In discussion, a member of the Group observed that “the risks of agreeing were </p>
<p>more political than military, and related to the UK being involved in facilitating a Fallujah </p>
<p>operation that might draw criticism”.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> A final decision was deferred to the following week, when the MOD would </p>
<p>provide advice.</p>

<p><b>228. </b> In a telephone conversation on 15 October, Mr Blair was reported to have said to </p>
<p>President Bush that “we had to deal with Fallujah. But it was important that Allawi had </p>
<p>the politics right before action was taken.”</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>229. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush that the UK “would try to help” in North Babil.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> On 15 October, in a round up of political events in Iraq, Mr Chaplin reported an </p>
<p>increase in political activity to the FCO in London, observing that parties had “shifted </p>
<p>up a gear as they realised that the clock was ticking”.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>231. </b> As well as the established political parties, Mr Chaplin wrote that:</p>
<p>“… more than 300 parties and movements have been formed since the fall of </p>
<p>Saddam and there is a growing realisation among the smaller parties that they need </p>
<p>to consolidate to gain seats.”</p>
<p><b>232. </b> Mr Chaplin reported that Prime Minister Allawi:</p>
<p>“… has been making all the right noises about the elections being open to everyone, </p>
<p>and emphasising that the prospects for the residents of places like Fallujah, Mosul, </p>
<p>and Sadr city would be much better if there was political dialogue and participation </p>
<p>in the electoral process.”</p>
<p><b>233. </b> On 17 October, a statement appeared on an Islamist website containing a </p>
<p>personal pledge of allegiance to Usama Bin Laden by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>234. </b> Shortly afterwards, the name of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s organisation changed to </p>
<p>“Base of Jihad (ie Al Qaida) in The Land of The Two Rivers”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> It was normally referred </p>
<p>to in UK documents as Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I).</p>
<p><b>235. </b> In a report to Gen Walker and ACM Torpy on 17 October, Lt Gen McColl called for </p>
<p>“an early and unambiguous decision in principle for the deployment [to North Babil] to </p>
<p>proceed, allowing the necessary battle procedure and preparation to start as soon as </p>
<p>possible”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The same report covered planning for the US force posture in Iraq. Lt Gen McColl </p>
<p>reported that US discussions had concluded with the decision “not to pursue the </p>
<p>possibility of making an early announcement of intention to withdraw”.</p>

<p> He confirmed that a request for UK ground </p>
<p>forces to be made available to relieve US forces was under consideration and that a </p>
<p>recommendation from Gen Walker was expected by the middle of the week.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Mr Hoon said:</p>
<p>“This request, if agreed, would involve UK land forces operating outside MND(SE). </p>
<p>It is worth bearing in mind that Royal Air Force personnel have been operating </p>
<p>over the whole of Iraq when required to support the coalition, and that some British </p>
<p>personnel are based in Baghdad to support coalition operations. Other British land </p>
<p>forces have previously operated outside MND(SE).”</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Denying speculation that the request was “somehow political” and linked to the </p>
<p>US Presidential Elections, Mr Hoon stressed that it had been “a military request … </p>
<p>linked to … efforts to create the best possible situation in which to hold the Iraqi </p>
<p>elections in January”.</p>
<p><b>240. </b> In a press conference the following day, Mr Straw was asked whether the </p>
<p>deployment was a “done deal” and replied that the UK was “very sympathetic” to the </p>
<p>US request, but “no final decision has been taken”.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Straw told journalists:</p>
<p>“I understand the concerns that have been expressed. I think the concern is as to </p>
<p>whether or not there is so-called mission creep, whether we will be there longer </p>
<p>than anticipated.</p>
<p>“We are not proposing to increase the total number of troops that would be in Iraq, </p>
<p>nor would we be extending the normal tour of duty of this particular unit [the Black </p>
<p>Watch].</p>
<p>“The purpose of these military movements is to stabilise the security situation </p>
<p>as quickly as possible so that we create a more satisfactory security environment </p>
<p>more quickly so that, in turn, the elections can take place by the end of January so </p>
<p>that in turn the Iraqis can start more quickly to take more and effective control of </p>
<p>their country.”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> On 19 October, Lt Gen Fry provided a paper for the Chiefs of Staff outlining the </p>

<p><b>243. </b> Gen Walker chaired an internal MOD meeting on 19 October to discuss </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry’s paper.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> He underlined the need to consider the request in terms of </p>
<p>military advantage and to have a good understanding of the likelihood of success in </p>
<p>Fallujah within the 30 day time period.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Air Staff, noted that “the key </p>
<p>question in relation to military benefit was whether the UK contribution in North Babil </p>
<p>would increase the chance of success in Fallujah. If this was the case, then a clear logic </p>
<p>chain existed in support of the UK deployment.” Both Lt Gen McColl and Maj Gen Rollo </p>
<p>saw military benefit in the deployment.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, considered that the Black </p>
<p>Watch could help prevent insurgents spreading out from Fallujah but “there would be </p>
<p>a casualty issue”.</p>
<p><b>246. </b> At the end of the meeting, Gen Walker commissioned the DIS to prepare </p>
<p>a one-page threat assessment for North Babil compared with MND(SE), including </p>
<p>a casualty assessment.</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary provided him with a Cabinet Office brief on the pros </p>
<p>and cons for the different timing options of a decision.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> It highlighted that an early </p>
<p>decision would mean that UK troops (the Black Watch) could be in place in good time, </p>
<p>but that it would mean extending their tour of duty. A delayed decision would mean </p>
<p>that the next troop rotation would have arrived (the Scots Guards) and could backfill </p>
<p>the Black Watch as the MND(SE) armoured reserve. But delay might also lead the US </p>
<p>to conclude that the UK would always turn down such deployment requests.</p>
<p><b>248. </b> In his covering note, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told Mr Blair that he would get </p>
<p>“firm advice” later in the week, but that Gen Walker and Mr Hoon would discuss options </p>
<p>with him the next day. Gen Walker was reported to favour limiting any offer of support to </p>
<p>30 days, to discourage early deployment.</p>
<p><b>249. </b> Anticipating a positive decision on the North Babil deployment, Mr Ian Lee, MOD </p>
<p>Director General Media and Communications, wrote to Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director </p>
<p>General Operational Policy, with some thoughts about announcing it. Mr Lee observed </p>
<p>that “journalists find it hard to believe that the US military machine needs this UK help, </p>
<p>and this in turn leads them to the conclusion that (US) politics is driving the issue”.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>250. </b> The Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) reported on 20 October that there had been </p>
<p>no MNF-I fatalities in the previous month within the area the US was proposing UK </p>

<p>Mr Blair confirmed that no decision had yet been taken. He told the House of Commons:</p>

<p><b>257. </b> Lt Gen McColl characterised the insurgency in Iraq as “an extreme manifestation </p>
<p>of the national pride felt by the overwhelming majority of the public, who feel a deep-</p>
<p>seated desire to ‘liberate’ Iraq from foreign ‘occupation’”. He judged that the diverse </p>
<p>groups with the insurgency co-operated “purely to be rid of MNF-I”, and were unified by </p>
<p>high unemployment and shared religion. Based on “objective metrics” such as number </p>
<p>of attacks and casualty rates, the insurgency was “increasing in intensity and lethality, </p>
<p>and is sustainable in the medium term”.</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Although there were troops from 30 nations deployed as part of the coalition, </p>
<p>Lt Gen McColl recorded that only the UK sought to influence the campaign strategy </p>
<p>and operational policy in theatre. On a number of occasions, the UK had successfully </p>
<p>influenced the conduct of the campaign in line with its own strategic objectives. </p>
<p>That influence was based on “the political capital invested”, troop contribution, </p>
<p>financial contribution, the quality of staff officers and counter-insurgency expertise. </p>
<p>However, repeated rejections of US requests for the deployment of UK resources </p>
<p>beyond MND(SE) had “chipped away at the US/UK relationship”.</p>
<p><b>259. </b> In summary, the report said: “Our wish to contribute to campaign direction beyond </p>
<p>the boundaries of MND(SE) needs to be visibly supported by a reasonable commitment </p>
<p>and participation if we are to retain credibility.”</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Lt Gen McColl wrote that:</p>
<p>“Ejection of the coalition in 05 would risk mission failure but the timing of planned </p>
<p>withdrawal thereafter is critical … there is much to commend a withdrawal in early </p>
<p>06 in accordance with the UN mandate. This is the natural political, legal and (if we </p>
<p>do our job well) security culminating point.</p>
<p>“If we are indeed to be committed to withdraw at that point, then we should seriously </p>
<p>consider announcing that intention early. Any such announcement would undercut </p>
<p>the insurgency, address public suspicion over MNF-I’s long-term intentions, and </p>
<p>reinforce the moderates of all hues.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> That view was not, however, shared by everyone:</p>
<p>“Discussions with US interlocutors have identified little appetite for declaring early … </p>
<p>based upon the underlying perception … that the operation will extend well beyond </p>
<p>2006 …</p>
<p>“Any end state that envisages a continued coalition presence after the spring of 06 </p>
<p>(allowing time to withdraw) would require either a new UN mandate or the consent of </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government … It is at this point that the national goals of coalition members </p>
<p>may diverge. No firm decisions on the long-term US presence have been made, </p>
<p>but some US planning at least envisages a long-term basing strategy. Current UK </p>
<p>planning does not. As such, there is, therefore, a pressing need to define [the] UK’s </p>
<p>long-term end state in the region, and to accept that this may differ from that of the </p>
<p>US. If a decision is made that [the] UK’s national interest lies alongside that of the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>438</p>
<p>US, that decision must be taken in the expectation that any US/UK forces in Iraq </p>
<p>will continue to be a target and spur for insurgency as long as they remain.”</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Lt Gen McColl ended his report by writing:</p>
<p>“There have already been two strategic errors in the post war campaign, the </p>
<p>dissolution of the Army and de-Ba’athification. Lack of clarity on the timing of our </p>
<p>intent beyond the Dec 05 elections would be a third. A clearly defined and articulated </p>
<p>intent to withdraw once the mission had been completed in the spring of 06 provides </p>
<p>the most effective way to separate the insurgents from the mass of the people.”</p>
<p><b>263. </b> A CIG assessed the security situation in North Babil on 21 October and reached </p>
<p>similar conclusions to the DIS.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> It judged that recent MNF-I attacks against insurgents </p>
<p>there had disrupted but not significantly weakened them. The majority were disaffected </p>
<p>local Sunni Arabs, including former military or other state employees, but there were </p>
<p>also cells of hardline Ba’athists, Iraqi Islamist terrorists and possibly foreign jihadists. </p>
<p>The CIG judged that the local population would be “more hostile to a UK presence than </p>
<p>the population in southern Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 21 October that the Chiefs were “of the view </p>
<p>that there is a clear military benefit in carrying out the operation in terms of reducing the </p>
<p>risk associated with the proposed ISF/US Fallujah operation”.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> Mr Hoon indicated that </p>
<p>he intended to accept the Chiefs’ recommendation and to announce it that afternoon </p>
<p>to Parliament.</p>
<p><b>265. </b> In preparation for a discussion of the deployment at Cabinet later that morning, </p>
<p>Mr Blair asked for “a better explanation … of why the US Army cannot take on the task </p>
<p>proposed for the Black Watch”.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald provided a brief which explained that although there </p>
<p>were large numbers of US troops in Iraq, many were providing logistical support; the </p>
<p>Black Watch provided the sort of armoured capability to be a like-for-like replacement </p>
<p>in North Babil.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> At Cabinet Mr Blair explained that it was necessary to conduct a “clearance </p>
<p>operation” in Fallujah in the coming weeks in order to enable Iraqi elections to </p>
<p>proceed.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> The deployment of the Black Watch to North Babil was recommended by </p>
<p>the British military. For the Black Watch, “the danger to which they would be exposed </p>
<p>was not qualitatively different from that which they had experienced to date in their </p>
<p>current tour”.</p>

<p><b>268. </b> Mr Blair concluded that providing forces in support of the Fallujah operation meant </p>
<p>that the UK would maintain an influence on its planning.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Mr Hoon announced the deployment to Parliament that afternoon.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> In his </p>
<p>statement he said:</p>
<p>“We cannot consider the current UK area of responsibility in isolation. What goes </p>
<p>on in the rest of Iraq affects southern Iraq and affects UK troops wherever they are </p>
<p>based. We must therefore consider our contribution in the context of the overall </p>
<p>security situation right across Iraq. This means that an armoured battle group </p>
<p>consisting of the 1</p>
<p>st</p>
<p> Battalion the Black Watch and supporting units will deploy </p>
<p>to an area within Multi-National Force (West) to relieve a US unit for other tasks. </p>
<p>They will be deploying with the necessary combat support services such as </p>
<p>signallers, engineers and medics, resulting in a total deployment of around 850 </p>
<p>personnel. This deployment will be for a very limited and specified period of time, </p>
<p>lasting weeks rather than months.”</p>
<p><b>270. </b> In a telephone call on 22 October, Prime Minister Allawi told Mr Blair that he was </p>
<p>“pursuing a fresh political initiative on Fallujah and would exhaust the peaceful options </p>
<p>before considering military action”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>271. </b> The decision on whether to commence military operations rested with Prime </p>
<p>Minister Allawi, who was assured by the British Embassy Baghdad that “HMG would </p>
<p>back [his] judgement”.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Towards the end of October, UK officials in Baghdad reported that Prime Minister </p>
<p>Allawi was showing “early signs of a wobble on timing” for the election.</p>
<p>138</p>

<p>on this subject when speaking to Prime Minister Allawi.</p>

<p>on 27 October Ms Adams replied to Ms Rose’s letter of 15 October.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>278. </b> Ms Adams reported Lord Goldsmith’s agreement with the military assessment </p>
<p>that the level of violence in parts of Iraq constituted a state of armed conflict. It would </p>
<p>be impractical to operate under different rules in different geographical areas but Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith felt it important that the revised Targeting Directive said explicitly that force </p>
<p>was “only authorised where it is strictly necessary and proportionate”.</p>
<p><b>279. </b> On 27 October, the JIC conducted a review of insurgencies in Iraq at the request </p>
<p>of the FCO.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p><b>280. </b> The JIC judged that there was “no unified national insurgency” although “all </p>
<p>insurgent groups have a perceived common enemy: the MNF-I and Iraqis who support </p>
<p>the ‘occupation’”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In general:</p>
<p>“The level of sustained violence in Iraq shows no sign of diminishing. The </p>
<p>considerable efforts of the Multi-National Forces (MNF) and the Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces (ISF) are constraining the insurgents but not defeating them.”</p>
<p><b>281. </b> The JIC judged that, of the groups operating:</p>
<p>“The <b>Sunni Arab</b> insurgents have the greatest depth and means to conduct a </p>
<p>long-term campaign. They pose the most serious threat to the Iraqi government. </p>
<p>They enjoy a degree of popular sympathy within the Sunni community. The Iraqi </p>
<p>government’s outreach efforts have not yet diminished this.</p>
<p>“The scale of the Sunni Arab insurgency will be influenced in the short term by </p>
<p>events in Fallujah. More broadly, it will be affected by the outcome of the January </p>
<p>elections – a result which deepens Sunni political exclusion could fuel the violence </p>
<p>– and by the MNF presence, against which the overwhelming majority of attacks </p>
<p>are directed. A significant Sunni insurgency will probably continue through 2005 </p>
<p>and beyond.</p>

<p>“A <b>Shia</b> insurgency, small at present, will persist. Its scope and scale will depend </p>
<p>on the degree of political inclusion (particularly as regards al-Sadr) and the success </p>
<p>of economic improvements in poor Shia areas, and could be affected by how the </p>
<p>Sunnis react to the election results.”</p>
<p><b>282. </b> In Baghdad, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“With a deal struck between representatives of al-Sadr and the IIG, violence in </p>
<p>the Sadr City area of Baghdad has reduced significantly. Isolated attacks, mainly </p>
<p>against the MNF, have continued in Baghdad and elsewhere in Shia areas. Most </p>
<p>are conducted by renegade Mahdi Army elements determined to continue to attack </p>
<p>the MNF, but other Shia groups are also involved. Intelligence continues to indicate </p>
<p>confusion and dissention among the Mahdi Army and al-Sadr’s supporters.”</p>
<p><b>283. </b> For Sunni groups, the JIC assessed that the next few months would be:</p>
<p>“… important in shaping the scale of their insurgency. There are signs that some </p>
<p>of the insurgents may be susceptible to overtures from the IIG. Prime Minister </p>
<p>Allawi and other senior figures in the government have invested considerable effort </p>
<p>in establishing dialogue with a variety of Sunni insurgent leaders … In the short </p>
<p>term much may depend on <b>Fallujah</b>. Long drawn out fighting with heavy civilian </p>
<p>casualties will reinforce the broader Sunni Arab insurgency and may jeopardise </p>
<p>attempts to bring Sunni Arabs into the political process. Success in Fallujah, either </p>
<p>through negotiations or a successful military operation – particularly against foreign </p>
<p>jihadists – will result in the IIG maintaining momentum and offers the prospect </p>
<p>of further progress after the elections. But, whatever the outcome in Fallujah a </p>
<p>significant Sunni Arab insurgency will continue through 2005 and beyond. The </p>
<p>election will bear on its scale. An acceptable outcome for the Sunnis could lead </p>
<p>to a reduction in violence. A result which deepens their political exclusion may see </p>
<p>a continuation of the current level or perhaps an increase.”</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>284. </b> The JIC assessed that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s position might be strengthened </p>
<p>by his pledge of allegiance to Usama Bin Laden, enabling him to attract more foreign </p>
<p>recruits and funding, and making his group a long term threat. But the AQ “brand” was </p>
<p>expected to reinforce further the fears of Iraqi citizens opposed to the jihadist agenda.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> On 27 October, Maj Gen Farquhar reported that “the Independent Electoral </p>
<p>Commission of Iraq (IECI) had formally requested logistic support in the distribution </p>

<p><b>289. </b> In discussion, a member of the Group commented that the Iraqi public was starting </p>
<p>to believe the elections would happen.</p>
<p><b>290. </b> Mr Hoon briefed the Group on US military plans for a “short, sharp campaign” </p>
<p>in Fallujah.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UK forces would be in place in North Babil by 2 November. He said that </p>
<p>the UK needed to press the US to ensure that its operation would be as targeted as </p>
<p>possible. Many civilians had already left the area in anticipation of an attack.</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Mr Hoon told the Group that the IIG should be encouraged to make political </p>
<p>contacts with Sunni leaders in Fallujah so that there would not be a political vacuum </p>
<p>following the military operation.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> In discussion, a member of the Group observed that popular support for the </p>
<p>insurgents within Fallujah was waning.</p>
<p><b>293. </b> The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq concluded that the UK should emphasise to </p>
<p>the US that:</p>

<p><b>297. </b> Mosul, situated in MND(NE), was reported to be “increasingly in the grip of </p>
<p>intimidation” and was “increasingly being seen in MNF-I and IIG circles as ‘the operation </p>
<p>after next’”. Lt Gen Kiszely considered that:</p>
<p>“… intimidation in Mosul is a microcosm of much of Iraq, especially the Sunni areas. </p>
<p>It is my perception that this widespread intimidation is deepening … The number of </p>
<p>kidnaps, in particular, is increasing, with the victims including the close relatives of </p>
<p>senior Ministers, Generals, Provincial Governors and Police Chiefs.</p>
<p>“The level of intimidation is severely undermining the rule of law … Criminals and </p>
<p>insurgents operate with impunity and rule by intimidation. The police are either </p>
<p>driven out, cowed, or are actively collaborating with the criminals and insurgents. </p>
<p>This is true in many areas designated by MNF-I as ‘at or near Local Control’. Since </p>
<p>Local Control is defined only in terms of internal security, and not in terms of the rule </p>
<p>of law, it is perfectly possible for areas to appear controlled – a relative absence of </p>
<p>acts of insurgency; some uniformed police on the streets by day – although in reality </p>
<p>this is a façade. It is actually the insurgents who are in control.”</p>
<p><b>298. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely advised “we shall need to watch this very carefully when proposals </p>
<p>are made in the up-coming Force Posture Review” because a premature move to the </p>
<p>wrong structure would be “likely to result in a loss of the gains we have made and </p>
<p>a regression in the counter-insurgency campaign”.</p>
<p><b>299. </b> On election preparations, Lt Gen Kiszely reported:” The distribution of voter </p>
<p>registration material is almost complete, and in time for the start of registration in the </p>
<p>coming week.” He considered that timing was “at-risk to unforeseen circumstances”. </p>
<p>Some concerns remained about election security, but responsibility was clearly with the </p>
<p>Iraqi police. The MNF-I would “appear at or near election facilities only in extremis”.</p>

<p>violence was the primary cause of death.”</p>
<p>The study identified Fallujah as an outlier. Of the households visited in Fallujah, </p>
<p>44 percent were temporarily or permanently abandoned. The survey had nonetheless </p>
<p>completed a Fallujah sample in which:</p>
<p>“… we recorded 53 deaths when only 1.4 were expected under the national pre-war </p>
<p>rate. This indicates a point estimate of about 200,000 excess deaths in the 3 percent </p>
<p>of Iraq represented by this cluster. However, the uncertainty in this value is substantial </p>
<p>and implies additional deaths above those measured in the rest of the country.”</p>
<p>On 18 November, Mr Straw briefed the AHMGIR that:</p>
<p>“… he had issued a Ministerial statement on civilian casualties in response to </p>
<p>the study reported by the Lancet. The key points were that the Lancet findings </p>
<p>were heavily dependent on the data set they had used and that their statistical </p>
<p>assumptions were flawed (and this could be demonstrated if, for example, a case </p>
<p>study was made of Fallujah).” </p>
<p>154</p>
<p>Mr Straw’s statement to Parliament said:</p>
<p>“The Multi-National and Iraqi forces continue to act so as to minimise civilian </p>
<p>casualties. This is despite the fact that the insurgents have shown no compunction </p>
<p>in using mosques, schools and hospitals as defensive bases.”</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Mr Straw quoted alternative casualty figures from the Iraqi Ministry of Health and from </p>
<p>www.iraqbodycount.org.</p>
<p>Casualty figures are considered in more detail in Section 17.</p>

<p><b>302. </b> The CIG judged that “prospects of a negotiated solution remain poor”. The US </p>
<p>estimated that around 3,000 insurgents were still in the city. Of those:</p>
<p>“Some will certainly stay and fight but we are unable to judge the potential size of </p>
<p>this hard core. Some may fight initially and then disperse. Others may have already </p>
<p>left the city. A number will lie low in Fallujah to mount a longer-term resistance.”</p>

<p><b>303. </b> The CIG assessed that intensive fighting in Fallujah would trigger a surge in </p>
<p>violence elsewhere in Sunni Arab areas, although the scale of such activity would </p>
<p>depend on what happened in Fallujah. If the attack was short and precise the </p>
<p>consequent violence was expected to be limited; long drawn out fighting with heavy </p>
<p>civilian casualties was expected to provoke a more intense reaction.</p>
<p><b>304. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary briefed him on 2 November that Prime Minister Allawi </p>
<p>was concerned about aspects of the military plan.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> He added that “planning for the </p>
<p>post-conflict phase remains inadequate, and the US now seem resigned to this”.</p>
<p><b>US Presidential election 2004</b></p>
<p>Iraq was a significant theme of the US Presidential election campaign in autumn 2004. </p>
<p>One US poll conducted at the start of the campaign indicated that Iraq was the most </p>
<p>important issue to 17 percent of US voters, behind the economy (25 percent) and the war </p>
<p>on terror (24 percent).</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>According to Mr Bob Woodward<i>, </i>although the level of violence in Iraq remained high </p>
<p>throughout the campaign and surged in the weeks leading up to election day, the </p>
<p>absence of a strategy for Iraq and the mounting violence “never quite grabbed hold in </p>
<p>the campaign”.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> Mr Woodward also reported the views of Mr Blackwill, who had been </p>
<p>struck by the lack of time to discuss Iraq policy during the campaign and President Bush’s </p>
<p>“round-the clock, all-consuming focus on winning the election”. According to Mr Blackwill, </p>
<p>the President “talked about goals, expressed his optimism … and gave pep talks”, but the </p>
<p>administration had “no real strategy”.</p>
<p>President Bush was elected for a second term in office on 2 November 2004.</p>
<p>Secretary Powell announced his resignation from government in November 2004. He </p>
<p>was succeeded as Secretary of State by Dr Rice, who in turn was replaced as National </p>
<p>Security Advisor by her deputy, Mr Stephen Hadley.</p>
<p><b>305. </b> On 3 November, the JIC assessed the political prospects for the forthcoming </p>
<p>elections.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> As well as assessing that a strong Sunni Arab turnout would be essential </p>
<p>for credibility and that the forthcoming events in Fallujah would be critical in determining </p>
<p>how things would unfold, it considered the likely impact of a delay. The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“A limited delay to the elections – of a month or so – would have little impact on the </p>
<p>political process. A longer delay will undermine Allawi’s credibility and that of the </p>
<p>coalition, and would be likely to lead to increased violence, including from the Shia.”</p>
<p><b>306. </b> That judgement was based, in part, on the position of Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani. </p>
<p>He had recently issued a statement encouraging all Iraqi citizens to register to vote and </p>
<p>was “the only significant Iraqi voice to emphasise the need for representation in the TNA </p>

<p>effect among Sunnis”.</p>
<p><b>307. </b> The JIC judged that Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani “would accept a limited delay of no </p>
<p>more than two months, if clearly required for security or technical reasons”.</p>
<p><b>308. </b> In preparation for a breakfast meeting with Prime Minister Allawi on 5 November, </p>
<p>Mr Blair was briefed that there were “growing doubts” over the commitment of the IIG </p>
<p>and Prime Minister Allawi to January elections.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>309. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary also provided a list of “points that Allawi needs to cover </p>
<p>before he approves any military action”, which included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrating publicly that there had been “every reasonable effort to identify </p>
<p>and negotiate with representatives from Fallujah”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>having a political strategy to deal with the impact of military action on party </p>
<p>registration for the elections and on planned international conferences;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring he was content with the military plans and the role of the ISF; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparing a “follow-up package of political and economic measures”.</p>
<p><b>310. </b> Over breakfast, Mr Blair advised that:</p>
<p>“… he knew the military commanders were keen to move now. But it was vital that </p>
<p>we balanced the political and military priorities. Unless there was an argument for an </p>
<p>immediate move, then he believed we needed to take the necessary time to exhaust </p>
<p>all avenues of dialogue with the Sunnis. He also thought that we needed to issue an </p>
<p>ultimatum to Fallujah.”</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>311. </b> Mr Blair also set out the reasons why holding elections on time was crucial. </p>
<p>He advised “we needed to portray this to the outside world as the justification for </p>
<p>everything we had done to date and for any operation in Fallujah”.</p>
<p><b>312. </b> On 5 November, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary sent an IPU paper on </p>
<p>phased drawdown in Iraq to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> The paper considered:</p>
<p>“… whether we should make public our intention that the MNF presence in Iraq will </p>
<p>alter during 2005 and end soon after the December 2005 elections (with any further </p>
<p>troop presence in Iraq being purely to train and support the ISF, and under a new </p>
<p>arrangement with the Iraqi government).”</p>

<p><b>313. </b> The IPU concluded that there should be a public statement, which would make </p>
<p>clear that drawdown was conditional on successful elections in January and December </p>
<p>2005, progress in training the ISF and completion of the Petraeus Plan. The IPU </p>
<p>considered the relationship between the insurgency and drawdown and observed that:</p>
<p>“… some insurgents are beginning to conclude that US/UK refusal to specify an </p>
<p>end-date is evidence that we are in it for the long haul, that they are not going to win </p>
<p>militarily and, therefore, that they should engage on the political track …”</p>
<p><b>314. </b> The IPU also proposed that a public statement “should make clear that MNF would </p>
<p>not be able to draw-down quickly, or could even increase numbers, if the insurgency </p>
<p>continued as now”.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> The following day, the media reported that Mr Annan was urging caution.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a letter to leaders of the US, UK and Iraq he warned of the potential impact of major </p>
<p>military offensives on Iraq’s political process and warned:</p>
<p>“The threat or actual use of force not only risks deepening the sense of alienation </p>
<p>of certain communities, but would also reinforce perceptions among the Iraqi </p>
<p>population of a continued military Occupation.”</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Mr Annan wrote that “forthcoming elections are the keystone in a broader process </p>
<p>to restore stability and legitimacy in Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>317. </b> The BBC reported that Prime Minister Allawi called the letter “confused” and said:</p>
<p>“… if Mr Annan thought he could prevent insurgents in Fallujah from ‘inflicting </p>
<p>damage and killing’, he was welcome to try.”</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>318. </b> A copy of Prime Minister Allawi’s written response was provided to Mr Blair. It said:</p>
<p>“Even now, the door remains open to these groups [insurgents] to embrace the </p>
<p>rule-of-law, to put down their weapons, and to join the political process … But, again </p>
<p>I fear that we have all but exhausted the comprehensive dialogue that we have </p>
<p>conducted. We are now left with few options. I believe it is the Government’s duty </p>
<p>now to act in order to safeguard lives, elections and democracy in Iraq from those </p>
<p>choosing the path of violence and atrocities.”</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>319. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“In the end I think Allawi felt compelled to act – the reason he felt compelled was </p>
<p>because it was such a serious part of the security threat.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>448</p>
<p>“Fallujah by October/November 2004 was, by all accounts, a major terrorist haven </p>
<p>… there were said to be thousands of terrorists, and it was certainly a factory for </p>
<p>car bombs.”</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>320. </b> Lt Gen Sir John Kiszely told the Inquiry that Prime Minister Allawi sought regular </p>
<p>advice from US and UK Ambassadors as he considered action in Fallujah:</p>
<p>“But on the coalition side we were careful to make sure that any decision that was </p>
<p>made was, and was seen to be, an Iraqi Government decision and nobody else’s.”</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>321. </b> Mr Chaplin said:</p>
<p>“Our own view was one of caution, highlighting the risks and making sure that Allawi </p>
<p>considered really carefully the pros and cons. But in the end it was his decision, and </p>
<p>of course an American decision …</p>
<p>“Our main involvement and the main thing we emphasised afterwards was that </p>
<p>if there had to be military action, then the government needed to organise itself </p>
<p>to ensure there was rapid follow-up …” </p>
<p>169</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Following authorisation by Prime Minister Allawi, offensive operations began </p>
<p>in Fallujah on 8 November, at 1900 local time.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>323. </b> An update on the operation sent on 9 November reported that initial resistance </p>
<p>had been light, but was likely to increase as US forces and the ISF closed in on </p>
<p>insurgent strongholds.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>324. </b> On 10 November Mr Chaplin reported from Baghdad:</p>
<p>“Only a week ago, Sunni and Shia parties appeared to have drawn the same </p>
<p>conclusions … that the elections should be delayed for a few months. The Sunnis </p>
<p>were worried that a January election would see insufficient security in the Sunni </p>
<p>triangle for a good Sunni voter turnout. The Shia parties … had woken up to the fact </p>
<p>that more time would be needed to make a success of diaspora voting …</p>

<p><b>326. </b> Three days after the start of the operation in Fallujah, on 11 November, Mr Straw </p>
<p>told Cabinet that it was going “slightly better than had been anticipated”.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Although there had been civilian casualties, Prime Minister Allawi had gone to </p>
<p>great lengths to pursue a political solution. Mr Straw considered that it was necessary </p>
<p>to “deal with Fallujah” if elections were to be held.</p>
<p><b>328. </b> In a telephone conversation with Mr Straw on the same day, Secretary Powell said </p>
<p>that operations in Fallujah were going “relatively well” although Mosul, where the police </p>
<p>structure had entirely broken down, was a concern.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> Mr Straw commented that Mosul </p>
<p>“had the potential not only to be a centre of insurgency, but also of ethnic civil war”.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> On 11 November the JIC issued an Assessment covering current themes relating </p>
<p>to the security situation in Iraq.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The JIC judged that insurgent violence would continue at a high level in Iraq over </p>
<p>the next few months, however effective the operation in Fallujah was. It judged there </p>
<p>to be evidence of local co-operation between insurgent groups, but no overall </p>
<p>co-ordination.</p>
<p><b>331. </b> In Fallujah, US and Iraqi forces were making “good progress” and:</p>
<p>“A large number of insurgents have left the city, although the risk of significant attack </p>
<p>remains. Insurgents outside Fallujah will continue responding to the offensive with </p>
<p>an increased effort, including in the UK area of responsibility in North Babil.”</p>
<p><b>332. </b> It was the JIC’s view that:</p>
<p>“There are still too few capable Iraqi forces to cope with the widespread security </p>
<p>problems. Attacks and intimidation by insurgent groups against the Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces are undermining their effectiveness, in some cases. All Iraqi official </p>
<p>institutions, including the security forces, employ individuals who give information </p>
<p>to insurgents, either willingly or under threat.”</p>
<p><b>333. </b> The JIC judged that the new relationship between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and  </p>
<p>Al Qaida had had “no immediate impact on the security situation in Iraq” and was </p>
<p>“unlikely to alter it in the short term”. There were, however, indications that other  </p>
<p>AQ operatives were sending trainers to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Mr Blair visited Washington from 11 to 12 November to “look ahead strategically </p>

<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Unambiguous commitment to elections on time in January.</p>

<p>Iraqiisation of security was having any impact on the ability of terrorists to operate.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Mr Blair said that it was important to keep reiterating that if insurgents laid down </p>
<p>their weapons then operations like the one in Fallujah would cease.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> After returning to the UK, Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote to Mr Straw’s Principal Private </p>
<p>Secretary to describe the follow up work required.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“I discussed Iraq in 2005 in some detail with Condi [Rice]. But we need to put flesh </p>

<p> He said that in the </p>

<p>would be calling for the MNF-I to leave. He advised that the UK “should use this to our </p>
<p>advantage, not least in terms of empowering the moderates”.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> Mr Blair said he agreed and “had said as much to President Bush” the week </p>
<p>before.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> Mr Blair added: “There was no question of setting a timetable for withdrawal, but </p>
<p>we could indicate that once certain conditions had been fulfilled the role of the MNF-I </p>
<p>would no longer be necessary.”</p>
<p><b>342. </b> Lt Gen McColl told Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>“… the decision to deploy the Black Watch to North Babil had been absolutely right. </p>
<p>The UK were possibly the only nation who could influence US military thinking. </p>
<p>This was why our assistance had been sought, and why it was so important that we </p>

<p>182</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely reported to the MOD and to the IPU that the scale of the damage </p>
<p>he had witnessed dramatically outstripped the figures that the MNF-I had used in its </p>

<p>was “calm, but clearly taken aback by the damage he had seen”.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> In response, the IPU was “in touch with DFID to see whether they can assist </p>

<p>It suggested that Mr Straw should ask for an update on the security situation:</p>
<p>“… in particular, on Fallujah following Gen Kiszely’s recent visit and on the morale </p>

<p><b>350. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that:</p>
<p>“There has been a spike in activity in <b>Mosul</b>, almost certainly as a result of </p>
<p>operations in Fallujah and compounded by the weakness of the local police. </p>
<p>Police stations were overrun by insurgents across the city. Bridges have also been </p>
<p>attacked. In response, the governor imposed a curfew and US forces have been </p>
<p>redeployed from Fallujah (without any material impact on the Fallujah operation). </p>
<p>A new police chief has also been appointed. This has improved the situation and </p>
<p>police stations are steadily being brought back under IIG control, but the insurgents </p>
<p>remain active.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>452</p>
<p><b>351. </b> When the AHMGIR met, Gen Walker told Ministers that “exchanges with the </p>
<p>insurgents continued in a number of sectors of the city”.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> He reported the loss of </p>
<p>54 US troops, six Iraqi troops and 2,080 insurgents.</p>
<p><b>352. </b> Gen Walker described a slow start to reconstruction in Fallujah. This was a failure </p>
<p>of the IIG and, in part, non-military US agencies, although there was no indication of an </p>
<p>immediate humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Ministers concluded that Mr Straw should telephone Mr Jakob Kellenberger, </p>
<p>President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), to discuss ICRC </p>
<p>access to Fallujah.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> The AHMGIR also discussed elections, and was informed that the IECI had </p>
<p>decided to allow out of country voting. Arrangements for that to happen in the UK were </p>
<p>being discussed.</p>
<p><b>355. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Dr Rice discussed Fallujah during a telephone </p>
<p>conversation on 18 November.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Sir Nigel expressed concern about the pace of the humanitarian assistance and </p>
<p>reconstruction operations. Dr Rice shared that concern, but thought that some assistance </p>
<p>was reaching the north-west of the city. She considered that the next step was “to get the </p>
<p>city cleaned up so that the IDPs [internally displaced persons] would return”.</p>
<p><b>357. </b> On 19 November, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary:</p>
<p>“… we believe about 1,000 insurgents may have departed Fallujah for other towns </p>
<p>or cities … We believe the largest group have headed for Baghdad. But North Babil, </p>
<p>Mosul, Ramadi and Al-Qaim have also seen an influx.” </p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>358. </b> In relation to the election:</p>
<p>“The critical challenge now is ensuring credible Sunni participation in the process. </p>
<p>Operations in Fallujah have led to renewed calls by senior Sunnis and members of </p>
<p>the IIG for a postponement of elections … But Fallujah has not caused a definitive </p>
<p>boycott by Sunni groups.”</p>
<p><b>359. </b> In his weekly report on 21 November, Lt Gen Kiszely reported that a Campaign </p>
<p>Progress Review was about to get under way, to inform a strategy for the size, shape </p>
<p>and posture of the MNF-I in 2005.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> The US was already anticipating that three or four </p>
<p>additional brigades were required over the election period.</p>

<p><b>360. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely reported that 446 out of 542 voter registration centres had opened </p>
<p>and that 30 January 2005 had been formally announced as election day.</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely described Fallujah as a “ghost town” and the scale of damage </p>
<p>as “breathtaking”. He reported that US planning for reconstruction was well advanced </p>
<p>and that he had been appointed by Gen Casey as the MNF-I co-ordinator for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance and reconstruction with special responsibility for liaison </p>
<p>with the IIG. The immediate priorities were a needs assessment and co-ordination </p>
<p>of reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p><b>362. </b> From 22 November, the Secretary to this Inquiry, Ms Margaret Aldred, held the </p>
<p>post of Deputy Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat within the Cabinet Office, </p>
<p>succeeding Mr Desmond Bowen. Ms Aldred routinely chaired the Iraq Senior Officials </p>
<p>Group and deputised for Sir Nigel Sheinwald as Chair of the Iraq Strategy Group or at </p>
<p>meetings of the JIC.</p>
<p><b>363. </b> An international conference on Iraq, bringing together Iraq’s neighbours,</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> the </p>
<p>G8,</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> China and a number of other states and international organisations,</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> was held </p>
<p>in Sharm el Sheikh on 23 November.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Briefing prepared for Mr Straw by the IPU set out UK objectives for the conference. </p>
<p>They were to:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintain momentum towards elections in January;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lock the neighbours [of Iraq] into support for the political process; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>broaden international consensus by focusing the international community on </p>
<p>a forward looking agenda for 2005.” </p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>365. </b> The conference’s final communiqué</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> reflected those objectives and stated that </p>
<p>a follow-up meeting would take place in February 2005.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>366. </b> In a letter to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary </p>
<p>described the outcome as “a step forward”.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> Together with the Paris Club deal to write </p>
<p>off 80 percent of Iraq’s debt (see Section 10.3), it had “strengthened the impression of </p>
<p>the international community putting differences behind it and focusing on the future”. </p>
<p>It would be important to build on that with a “forward looking agenda for 2005”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p>The UK should also “continue talking up the role of the UN in advising on the </p>
<p>constitutional process as set out in SCR 1546” and “find roles for countries which give </p>
<p>them a stake in the process”.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> The letter also stated that:</p>
<p>“Fallujah was a tactical success. Although many insurgents slipped away, it achieved </p>
<p>its primary military objective of denying the insurgents their main safe haven. </p>
<p>Politically it has boosted the authority of the IIG, while the domestic and regional fall </p>
<p>out has been limited.”</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Looking ahead to election security, the letter stated that:</p>
<p>“The sheer number of polling booths will make it hard to provide security for them all, </p>
<p>but also makes it hard for the insurgents to close down voting in whole areas.</p>
<p>“The level of threat in some areas is clear from the attacks already being attempted </p>
<p>in registration. In Salah ad Din province the Iraqi police report terrorists have </p>
<p>already been distributing 120 IEDs and VBIEDs [vehicle-borne improvised explosive </p>
<p>devices] to disturb the elections.”</p>
<p><b>369. </b> During a video conference with President Bush on 30 November, Mr Blair said that </p>
<p>Fallujah “had gone well” and the story of what US forces had found there – including </p>
<p>evidence of torture chambers – should be put into the public domain.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the operation had “sent a clear message that the </p>
<p>insurgents could not win”.</p>
<p><b>December 2004</b></p>
<p><b>371. </b> The JIC reviewed the impact of Fallujah on 8 December.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p><b>372. </b> It judged that “Fallujah has been removed as a symbol of the impotence of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Interim Government (IIG) and of resistance to the Multi-National Force (MNF)”.</p>
<p><b>373. </b> Whilst the area was “no longer a major insurgent base” the JIC observed that </p>
<p>“details of how the insurgency operated in the city, and in particular the relationship </p>
<p>between the various insurgent elements, are yet to emerge”. Overall:</p>
<p>“Fallujah has been a setback for the insurgents, but in response they demonstrated </p>
<p>a high level of capacity to mount attacks across Sunni Arab areas of Iraq and </p>
<p>they are far from defeated. The present lull in violence is unlikely to last. Further </p>
<p>surges in violence should be expected, particularly to disrupt the electoral process. </p>
<p>Intimidation of voters and attacks on election and other infrastructure will be </p>
<p>key objectives.</p>

<p>455</p>
<p>“The immediate outcome in Fallujah has boosted the authority of the IIG. </p>
<p>But in the longer-term substantial Sunni participation in the election remains vital. </p>
<p>If a significant number of Sunni Arabs fail to vote, the elections will at best lack </p>
<p>international credibility and at worst could be destabilising.”</p>
<p><b>374. </b> The JIC reviewed Iranian support for insurgents within Iraq on 9 December.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It judged:</p>
<p>“Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) remains intent on supporting </p>
<p>anti-coalition resistance in Iraq …</p>
<p>“We have no firm evidence linking Iran to specific insurgent attacks since August, </p>
<p>but intelligence suggests activity in support of potential attacks continues. </p>
<p>Supreme Leader Khamenei probably continues to provide tacit support for this.</p>
<p>“Iran will persist with a twin track approach, supporting the holding of elections in </p>
<p>January, while providing limited backing to Shia militants. But with the Najaf crisis </p>
<p>having subsided and elections on track, Iranian support for Shia militants may </p>
<p>continue at a lower level in the short term. There is no intelligence to show current </p>
<p>Iranian support to Sunni insurgents.</p>
<p>“Iran would be likely to ratchet up its support to Shia militants in the event of any </p>
<p>renewed confrontation between Shia elements and the coalition. It would also back </p>
<p>the Shia in the face of growing sectarian violence.</p>
<p>“A constraint on the Iranians will remain their concern at the threat of US military </p>
<p>action against them. In consequence, while Iran will be tempted to take advantage </p>
<p>of any opportunity to support new attacks in Iraq in order to make life difficult for the </p>
<p>coalition, any significant escalation would depend on IRGC confidence in its ability </p>
<p>to avoid exposure of its role.”</p>
<p><b>375. </b> On 9 December, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary sent a paper on handling Iraq in </p>
<p>2005 to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>376. </b> The paper, described as an agenda for discussion with the US, recommended </p>
<p>maintaining momentum in the political process, broadening international consensus </p>
<p>on Iraq, reaching early agreement on the future of the MNF-I and making progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction and economic reform.</p>
<p><b>377. </b> The FCO considered that continued progress on Iraqiisation would allow the MNF-I </p>
<p>to move from primary responsibility for security in all areas to a supportive role during </p>
<p>2005, working either in support of ISF operationally or as trainers or mentors. A transfer </p>
<p>of lead responsibility for security to the ISF could occur in summer 2005.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>456</p>
<p><b>378. </b> The UK objective described in the paper was “a stable, democratic Iraq at peace </p>
<p>with itself and its neighbours”.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> In a note to his No.10 staff dated 12 December, Mr Blair commented that the </p>
<p>situation in Iraq was “worrying”.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> Iraqiisation was not yielding the looked-for progress; </p>
<p>the insurgent attacks were continuing far beyond what was manageable; there was </p>
<p>a risk that insufficient Sunni Arabs would participate in the election; life in Basra had </p>
<p>not sufficiently improved; and reconstruction remained a problem.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Blair’s conclusion was that:</p>
<p>“… this may be lower down the media profile; but it is not getting sorted. We need </p>
<p>to sit down with the US in the New Year and work out a proper strategy based on </p>
<p>a hard-headed reality check. The paper I have seen for 2005 is inadequate.”</p>
<p><b>381. </b> The Inquiry assumes that the paper referred to is the one sent by Mr Straw’s office </p>
<p>on 9 December, and asked Sir Nigel Sheinwald what it was about the paper that the </p>
<p>Prime Minister had considered inadequate.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Sir Nigel said that Mr Blair’s:</p>
<p>“… consistent worry during this period was: … was our government applying a </p>
<p>sufficient level of effort to this problem? Were we doing everything that we could with </p>
<p>the Americans to get things moving? He continually looked for … the missing pieces </p>
<p>in the strategy. Were there game changers? Were there drivers which would help us </p>
<p>on to more profitable and successful terrain?”</p>
<p><b>383. </b> In a paper for the Chiefs of Staff to consider out of committee dated 13 December, </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry looked at the possible roles for the MNF-I in the run up to the election.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Containing insurgent activity. This had “returned to pre-Ramadan levels” and </p>
<p>could be expected to rise again in the run-up to elections. The US had decided </p>
<p>to deploy an additional three brigades to strengthen the MNF-I. “But a balance </p>
<p>will be needed between directly countering the insurgency and safeguarding the </p>
<p>elections … For example … activity may have to be tempered to avoid further </p>
<p>Sunni alienation.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Countering voter intimidation. Flyers had appeared in some areas warning: </p>
<p>“You Vote, You Die.” This type of activity was expected to rise as elections grew </p>
<p>closer. “ISF will need to counter this, but they lack capability. This poses us a </p>
<p>dilemma: increase direct MNF-I support to elections, thereby reducing their </p>
<p>legitimacy; or let the ISF lead and potentially accept a low voter turnout.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Protecting critical electoral infrastructure. Plans were in hand, but success could </p>
<p>not be guaranteed. Although the IECI were in the lead on this, it was possible </p>
<p>that the MNF-I would be asked for logistical support, which in Lt Gen Fry’s view </p>
<p>could undermine the legitimacy of the elections.</p>
<p><b>384. </b> On 14 December, Mr Blair commented to President Bush that:</p>
<p>“The good news from Fallujah was that it had not prompted a serious escalation </p>
<p>elsewhere. But, equally it had not ended the insurgency.” </p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Mr Asquith commented after visiting Iraq that the after-effects of Fallujah would:</p>
<p>“… persist beyond the elections as the scale of destruction becomes apparent </p>
<p>to returning families and the wider public. Restoring more than very basic services </p>
<p>will take months. The insurgents are returning and the MNF/IIG relationship </p>
<p>is fractious.”</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Meanwhile, Mr Asquith reported that some considered the problems in Mosul </p>
<p>would trigger a “grim conflict that will dwarf Fallujah”.</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Lt Gen Sir John Kiszely told the Inquiry that the main lesson from Fallujah was </p>
<p>“don’t allow a safe haven to take effect in an insurgency situation”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>388. </b> The deadline for both voters and political parties/candidates to register for the </p>
<p>election was 15 December.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>389. </b> In a briefing paper on 15 December, the IPU estimated that voter registration had </p>
<p>been successful around the country with the exception of Anbar and, to a lesser extent, </p>
<p>Ninawa provinces (both Sunni). Opinion polls over recent months had suggested that </p>
<p>there was broad support for elections on time and a desire to vote, including among the </p>
<p>Sunni community.</p>
<p><b>390. </b> Over 200 political entities (party lists and independent candidates) had registered </p>
<p>and the Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq had certified over 470 candidate </p>
<p>lists (totalling more than 11,000 candidates). The majority of these were for the </p>
<p>18 provincial elections, with 11 for the Kurdish National Assembly and just over </p>
<p>70 for elections to the TNA.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> A briefing paper for Mr Blair to use at the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq on </p>
<p>16 December recommended that Ministers should focus on whether HMG had done </p>

<p>207</p>
<p><b>392. </b> The Cabinet Office described a JIC paper on Iraqiisation issued on 15 December </p>
<p>as “grim”. It described “high levels of dependency on the MNF-I until 2006”, “serious </p>
<p>structural weaknesses within the ISF” and “an assistance programme that, while making </p>
<p>progress, will take considerably more time to deliver significant impact”. By contrast, </p>
<p>the MOD’s paper had suggested that the Petraeus Plan would deliver, given time. </p>
<p>(See Section 12 for more detail.)</p>
<p><b>393. </b> Mr Straw briefed the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq that they should expect </p>
<p>the elections to be far from perfect but that, if there were problems during the election </p>
<p>period, it would be important to remind critics that these were the first democratic </p>
<p>elections in Iraq for many years and that on this occasion the Iraqi people were only </p>
<p>electing a transitional assembly.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>394. </b> The Chief of the Assessments Staff told the meeting that the ISF would “face </p>
<p>a major challenge in handling the elections”.</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Mr Hoon explained that a battalion was on stand-by in Cyprus in case it was </p>
<p>required during the election period. If the UK wanted to have the flexibility to deploy </p>
<p>it during the election period, its “notice to move” needed to be reduced from five to </p>
<p>three days by 1 January.</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Asquith wrote to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary following a visit to Iraq in mid </p>
<p>December.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“The time had now passed to argue for a delay in the polling day … Focusing on </p>
<p>30 January was the likeliest way to bring in the Sunni Arabs. When confronted with </p>
<p>reality, they would not repeat the mistake of the Shia in the 1920s.”</p>
<p><b>397. </b> The key issues for the UK in the weeks ahead were to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>manage expectations for the elections; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>build IECI capability to enable it to deliver the January elections, the </p>
<p>constitutional referendum and the elections in December 2005, which could </p>
<p>require “redrawing of boundaries, a new electoral law and a census”.</p>
<p><b>398. </b> Mr Asquith considered that priorities for 2005 included:</p>

<p>sense of danger that people live in here … coming from terrorists and insurgents … </p>
<p>Now where do we stand in that fight? We stand on the side of the democrats against </p>
<p>the terrorists.” </p>
<p>210</p>
<p><b>400. </b> The No.10 report of his visit recorded that “Iraqiisation and political outreach were </p>
<p>key themes”.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>401. </b> Mr Blair met Prime Minister Allawi and had been encouraged that he was working </p>
<p>on a security strategy which he intended to publish shortly.</p>
<p><b>402. </b> On reconstruction, Mr Blair was “very concerned about the slow pace of … </p>
<p>spending, especially in the South” and wanted the UK to make a major effort to secure </p>
<p>greater funding.</p>
<p><b>403. </b> During the visit, Interior Minister Naqib confirmed to Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the </p>
<p>IIG would facilitate forced returns of Iraqis without immigration status in the UK to Iraq.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi indicated that a Memorandum of Understanding should be signed </p>
<p>as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>404. </b> The JIC reviewed election prospects on 23 December.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p><b>405. </b> It judged that the planned election date would stick, despite previous pressure </p>
<p>for a delay. The likely extent of Sunni Arab participation in the election was unclear, </p>
<p>although it was expected that many would be deterred by the security situation and </p>
<p>some by a perception that the process was unfair or lacked legitimacy. In addition:</p>

<p>“Intimidation and assassinations will increase as the elections approach. Sunni </p>
<p>Arabs will be most susceptible to intimidation, although attacks will not be confined </p>
<p>to their areas.”</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Whatever the outcome, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“Hard-line Sunnis will reject any new government and will continue their campaign </p>
<p>of violence. Support for them could increase if the election outcome is perceived as </p>
<p>grossly unfair. Other Sunnis may be encouraged to turn away from the insurgency </p>
<p>if the election produces what they judge to be fair representation in the Presidency </p>
<p>Council, Transitional Government and Transitional National Assembly (TNA). But </p>
<p>any impact on the security situation will not be immediate.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The Transitional Government is unlikely to request early MNF withdrawal but may </p>
<p>try to insist on a timetable being formally agreed – even before UNSCR 1546 is </p>
<p>reviewed in June 2005.”</p>
<p><b>January 2005</b></p>
<p><b>407. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 4 January, Mr Blair said that it should </p>
<p>be made clear that it was violence and intimidation preventing people from participating </p>
<p>in the elections, not questions about the legitimacy of the process.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> He hoped that </p>
<p>the UN would say publicly that people in Iraq wanted to vote, and should be allowed to </p>
<p>do so.</p>
<p><b>408. </b> On 6 January, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary to </p>
<p>say that the Defence Secretary would consider over the weekend whether to deploy the </p>
<p>Cyprus-based battalion in mid-January to cover the election period.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> Maj Gen Riley had </p>
<p>requested the deployment, and Gen Walker endorsed it.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Following a request for additional information, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote </p>
<p>again to explain that the additional 400 troops would be used:</p>
<p>“… to free up fully acclimatised theatre troops from static security tasks, who can </p>
<p>then be employed on intelligence-led security operations in support of the election </p>

<p><b>410. </b> On 10 January Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Mr Hadley a Note by Mr Blair and asked </p>
<p>him to show it to President Bush before their discussion the following day.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Note covered “our most pressing problems”.</p>
<p><b>411. </b> On Iraq he judged:</p>
<p>“All the problems go back to security. Without it the politics are difficult, the </p>
<p>reconstruction shackled and the faith of Iraqis in the future undermined.”</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Blair considered that four actions were necessary:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqiisation of security forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>spending money more quickly on reconstruction, especially of essential services;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>being “very tough indeed on the election”, including by ensuring it went ahead </p>
<p>on schedule and encouraging participation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>signalling a timetable for the withdrawal of US and UK forces “when and only </p>
<p>when, we can point to real indigenous Iraqi strength”.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> In the video conference that followed on 11 January, Mr Blair reported that the UK </p>
<p>was “upbeat” about elections.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> Everything possible should be done on election security:</p>
<p>“But we also had to be very clear that where turnout was low, this was because </p>
<p>of intimidation and terrorist violence, and did not undermine the legitimacy of the </p>
<p>elections.”</p>
<p><b>414. </b> On 11 January Lt Gen Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), </p>
<p>submitted advice to Mr Hoon on prospects for 2005.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> In his view a “strategic </p>
<p>watershed” was approaching in Iraq:</p>
<p>“The prognosis for the security LOO [Line Of Operation] in 05 is stark … The Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency will grow in scale and intensity … Kurdish and Shia violence, recently </p>
<p>quiescent, may be sparked by intractable constitutional discord over federalism … </p>
<p>The recent alignment of AQ and Al Zarqawi has formally established Iraq as the </p>
<p>central front for radical Islamic terrorism … the pace of ISF development is too slow </p>
<p>for Iraq to manage the insurgency alone before 06 … In sum, we are not on track </p>
<p>to deliver the Steady State Criteria (SSC) before the UN mandate expires, or even </p>
<p>shortly thereafter.”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Lt Gen Fry judged that “only additional military effort by the MNF-I as a whole” </p>
<p>might be able to get the campaign back on track. He identified three possible courses of </p>
<p>action for the UK – increasing the UK scale of effort, maintaining the status quo or, if it </p>
<p>was judged that the campaign was irretrievable, accepting failure and seeking to mitigate </p>

<p>UK liability. The second two options carried an inherent “acceptance of probable long </p>
<p>term campaign failure”, which could destabilise the Middle East, create a safe haven for </p>
<p>international terrorists and damage the reputation and morale of the UK defence forces.</p>
<p><b>416. </b> Lt Gen Fry did not recommend a particular course of action but concluded:</p>
<p>“The situation in Iraq is grave and demands hard strategic choices for the UK, none </p>
<p>of which are palatable and all of which carry far-reaching consequences. But we </p>
<p>must not shirk a decision – more of the same will simply make the UK a spectator </p>
<p>to failure. The purist military response would be to increase scales of effort, but </p>
<p>the political will to do so will be minimal. Even then, an increased UK military effort </p>
<p>alone may not deliver success. The opportunity for the UK, or even the MNF-I, to </p>
<p>decisively influence the campaign may be gone. If we believe this to be the case, we </p>
<p>should seek a strategy of limited liability. But this will be very difficult to actually bring </p>
<p>off and accepts the inevitability of campaign failure in Iraq with far-reaching, long </p>
<p>term, damaging consequences.”</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the AHMGIR on 13 January that as expected there had been an </p>
<p>increase in violence, focused on the ISF and those connected with preparing </p>
<p>the elections.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Straw stated that the insurgents were “systematically targeting the democratic </p>
<p>process in an effort to make it hard to claim the elections could be free and fair”. </p>
<p>This should be countered by “making clear the degree of public interest in elections </p>
<p>in Iraq and the progress that had been made in preparing for them”.</p>
<p><b>419. </b> Ministers noted the “continuing need” to encourage Sunni participation and to </p>
<p>ensure the broadest possible participation in the constitutional drafting process after </p>
<p>the elections.</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Mr Chaplin was also considering the future UK military role, and sent a message to </p>
<p>the FCO in London that, whoever won the election, they were likely to “want something </p>
<p>more definite about the MNF’s future” than the simple fact of resolution 1546, and might </p>
<p>invoke the review clause in the resolution at any time.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>421. </b> In a press conference on 14 January, Mr Annan said:</p>
<p>“It is clear that the vast majority of Iraqis are eager to exercise their democratic right </p>
<p>to vote. But it is equally obvious that the conditions in which the election is being </p>
<p>held are far from ideal.</p>

<p>“Even at this late stage, outreach to the Arab nationalist component of society – </p>
<p>especially the Sunni Arabs – is critical … I encourage the [Iraqi] Government to </p>
<p>intensify its efforts, and I know the Government is making efforts in this direction.</p>
<p>“I encourage all Iraqis to exercise their democratic right to vote. Iraq needs as </p>
<p>broad-based a government as possible for a successful transition.” </p>

<p><b>422. </b> The IIG’s National Security Strategy was issued on 15 January.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> In it, Prime </p>
<p>Minister Allawi was reported to have increased the goal of training 100,000 Iraqi soldiers </p>
<p>by July to 150,000 “fully qualified” soldiers by the end of the year.</p>
<p><b>423. </b> During a video conference on 17 January, Mr Blair told President Bush that they </p>
<p>had to give a sense that Iraqiisation was “going somewhere” and that things would </p>
<p>change after the elections.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the Luck Review (see Section 12.1) should feed quickly </p>
<p>into a new, public, security plan which would be clear what was being asked of the </p>
<p>Iraqis. In his view the weakness of Iraqi structures remained “a real problem”.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> In advice to Mr Straw on 19 January, Mr Asquith identified three “immediate </p>
<p>threats” as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the elections being declared illegitimate, most likely because of low Sunni </p>
<p>turnout;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Sunni Arab community refusing to participate in the post-election political </p>
<p>process; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>excessive delay in establishing a government following the elections, with </p>
<p>a consequential squeeze on the timetable for developing and agreeing the </p>
<p>Constitution.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>426. </b> The second of these was, in Mr Asquith’s view, the most serious. He recommended </p>
<p>that the UK, working closely with the UN and other governments, should act to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage Sunni leaders to participate fully in the political process;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that Sunni Arabs were included in senior positions within the </p>
<p>government; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support engagement with Sunni rejectionist groups by members of the </p>
<p>Transitional National Assembly and Iraqi Transitional Government members.</p>
<p><b>427. </b> The last of these should include being prepared to “be more forward on MNF-I </p>
<p>timelines”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>464</p>
<p><b>428. </b> The same day, a JIC Assessment said that Sunni turnout might be as low as </p>
<p>one third of the eligible voters, which would give Sunni Arabs a disproportionately low </p>
<p>representation in elected institutions.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p><b>429. </b> The policy implications of that were, in the view of the JIC, that: “Sunni outreach </p>
<p>will need to intensify after the elections to ensure that Sunnis do not opt out of the </p>
<p>political and constitution drafting process altogether.”</p>
<p><b>430. </b> Sir William Ehrman told the Inquiry that the JIC had consciously sought to flag up </p>
<p>to policy makers the risk that the Sunnis would be significantly under-represented in the </p>
<p>TNA as a result of likely low turnout.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Between 17 and 19 January the UK deployed approximately 350 personnel from </p>
<p>1st Battalion, the Royal Highland Fusiliers to Iraq to provide additional security across </p>
<p>MND(SE) during the election period.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> They began returning to Cyprus on 21 February.</p>
<p><b>432. </b> In mid January, senior US and UK officials were discussing the role of the MNF-I </p>
<p>after the election, taking account of both security forecasts and the likely stance of the </p>
<p>incoming ITG.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> Both the UK and US Governments considered that it was important to </p>
<p>“strike the right balance between showing support for the transitional government and </p>
<p>the development of the ISF on the one hand, while on the other hand not giving any </p>
<p>impression of ‘cut and run’”.</p>
<p><b>433. </b> In preparation for a planned discussion on 20 January on the UK’s military </p>
<p>contribution in Iraq, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told him that Mr Hoon would want to </p>
<p>discuss the UK military deployment in Iraq in 2005 and whether to backfill after the </p>
<p>Dutch withdrew from Muthanna province.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p> He explained that Mr Hoon wanted to be </p>
<p>able to tell the US as soon as possible that the UK could not make significant additional </p>
<p>troop contributions or take on deployments outside MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>434. </b> The Private Secretary recommended that Mr Blair’s response to Mr Hoon should </p>
<p>be that “we will need to handle this issue carefully with the US” and that he should set </p>
<p>out a “gameplan” for doing so.</p>

<p><b>436. </b> Mr Collis commented: “While all this suggests widespread determination to vote, </p>

<p>232</p>
<p> At the meeting,</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Gen Walker advised that the US campaign against the insurgency had stalled and the </p>
<p>US was reviewing its operations. The UK “needed to recognise that if our voice was to </p>
<p>count with the US we would have to offer to play a part in the plan that emerged”.</p>
<p><b>438. </b> If the UK wanted to resist the likely request to extend its operation beyond </p>
<p>MND(SE), it would need to accept reduced influence in strategic discussions about </p>
<p>MNF-I strategy. Gen Walker did not consider the insurgency to be growing, but popular </p>
<p>support for it was.</p>
<p><b>439. </b> The record of the meeting stated:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister said the bottom line was that we had to complete the mission. </p>
<p>The key question was when we could hand responsibility for security over to the </p>
<p>ISF. CDS [Gen Walker] said it very much depended on the environment. Muthanna </p>
<p>and Basra were reasonably calm. But it was not clear that they would stay that way </p>
<p>without any MNF presence …</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister said he was only prepared to redeploy UK forces beyond our </p>
<p>current area of operations if there was a viable plan or product. But he was not </p>
<p>prepared simply to follow along with US wishes. We needed to have a coherent plan </p>
<p>to do the job … Simply asking us to take over MND(CS) was not a plan.”</p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 25 January and </p>
<p>discussed messaging around the imminent election.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p> Mr Blair considered that talking </p>
<p>publicly about withdrawal would smack of defeat. Rather, he suggested that: “Our aim </p>
<p>was to make our role redundant.”</p>
<p><b>441. </b> Mr Blair said that he would speak to Mr Annan before the election and encourage </p>
<p>him to be positive about the impact of the vote. White House and No.10 staff would </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>466</p>
<p><b>443. </b> The FCO reported that the number of registered candidates was impressive, and </p>
<p>one third were women; technical preparations were on track, including for out of country </p>
<p>voting and results would likely be known by 10 February and certified 10 days later. </p>
<p>The level of Sunni participation remained “the key variable” with turnout predictions </p>
<p>between five and 40 percent, although the FCO considered that a key message for the </p>
<p>period was “we should not judge the success of elections by the Sunni turnout”.</p>
<p><b>444. </b> On 27 January, Mr Hoon told Parliament:</p>
<p>“Dutch forces have made good progress in Muthanna, both in ensuring the stability </p>
<p>of the province and building the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). This </p>
<p>means a significantly smaller force package is now able to perform these tasks and </p>
<p>the General Officer Commanding (GOC) MND (SE) has concluded that a force of </p>
<p>some 600 personnel will be adequate to support and mentor Iraqi Security Forces </p>
<p>in providing general security in Muthanna, as well as providing protection for the </p>
<p>Japanese reconstruction battalion located there.</p>
<p>“The majority of the personnel required will come from UK units already deployed </p>
<p>in Iraq.”</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>445. </b> Mr Hoon explained that an additional 220 UK troops would be deployed temporarily </p>
<p>to assist with logistics and other essential support functions. That number would reduce </p>
<p>by 70 once the initial deployment had been completed.</p>
<p><b>446. </b> Elections for the TNA and Provincial Assemblies took place across Iraq on </p>

<p>237</p>
<p><b>447. </b> The 5,232</p>
<p>238</p>

<p>130,000 Iraqi Security Forces personnel, supported by 184,500 MNF-I troops.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>448. </b> Mr Quarrey reported to Mr Blair that “crucially, the ISF reported for duty in large </p>
<p>numbers”.</p>

<p><b>449. </b> Maj Gen Riley described election day in southern Iraq as “extraordinary” with an </p>
<p>almost festive atmosphere.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> He observed that:</p>
<p>“We should not forget that this was an Iraqi election and in the end, it was Iraqis </p>
<p>who organised it and whose forces secured it. The ISF needed our help but their </p>
<p>momentum gathered. They had the courage to stand up and be counted. This is the </p>
<p>heaviest blow that Iraqis could deliver to everything that the insurgency represents.”</p>

<p><b>450. </b> In a Parliamentary Statement the following day, Mr Straw commented that the </p>
<p>elections had been:</p>
<p>“… a moving demonstration that democracy and freedom are universal values to </p>
<p>which people everywhere aspire.”</p>
<p>242</p>
<p><b>451. </b> A report on the elections sent to Mr Blair on 31 January suggested that overall </p>
<p>turnout might exceed 60 percent and recounted a number of anecdotes “pointing to </p>
<p>Iraqis’ courage and determination”, including:</p>
<p>“… in Sadr city, people wounded by a mortar attack rejoined the queue to vote; </p>
<p>villagers near Abu Ghraib sought US military protection as they went to vote; </p>
<p>relatives of terrorist victims told the media that voting was their duty to the memory </p>
<p>of those who had died.”</p>
<p> 243</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Reflecting on the election in a telephone call with President Bush on 31 January, </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that the media had reported events positively, and had recognised the </p>
<p>importance of the occasion.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> He considered that it was vital to use the elections to </p>
<p>generate “some real momentum” in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>February 2005</b></p>
<p><b>453. </b> On 1 February, Mr Blair suggested to President Bush that they should focus on </p>
<p>four areas in order to exploit post-election momentum:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqiisation, including ensuring that the ITG had 8-10,000 “crack troops who </p>
<p>could deal with any situation”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>political outreach, including “whittling away at the opposition, so that the hard </p>
<p>core were left isolated”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing in the international community; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction, including areas in which there could be a quick impact (eg power </p>
<p>generation).</p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Blair proposed that these areas should be drawn into a plan by the ITG, which </p>
<p>the UK and US could then support.</p>
<p><b>455. </b> The UK provided a draft of such a statement to the US in early April, where it met </p>
<p>“some scepticism at official level”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>468</p>
<p><b>456. </b> On 3 February, just before the election results were announced, the JIC assessed </p>
<p>the nature and strength of insurgents in Iraq, the threat they posed and the response of </p>
<p>both the ISF and the MNF-I.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> It judged:</p>
<p>“The scale and intensity of the Sunni insurgency continues to put at risk the </p>
<p>achievement of a unified and democratic Iraq. In Sunni areas the military campaign </p>
<p>is not containing the insurgency … While the political process offers an opportunity </p>
<p>to detach some insurgents from the hard core, a significant Sunni insurgency will </p>
<p>continue through 2005 and beyond.</p>
<p>“Foreign jihadists continue to form a small minority of insurgents, but have been </p>
<p>responsible for many of the most serious attacks. However, al-Zarqawi’s violent </p>
<p>Islamist message, including his rejection of democracy, is not accepted by most </p>
<p>Iraqis – including by some Sunni Arab insurgents.</p>
<p>“Shia insurgents are largely dormant. The threat of some Shia violence, however, </p>
<p>will persist …</p>
<p>“Insurgents are not unified among the Sunni or nationally, although they have </p>
<p>a common enemy: the MNF and those Iraqis associated with supporting the </p>
<p>‘occupation’. This has led to possibly increasing local cooperation between some </p>
<p>groups, notably foreign jihadists and Iraqi Sunni Arabs.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“… the military campaign is not effectively containing the insurgency in Sunni areas. </p>
<p>Law and order, the pace of economic reconstruction, the availability of jobs and </p>
<p>general quality of life have not matched expectation … Sunni ‘hearts and minds’ are </p>
<p>being lost.”</p>
<p><b>458. </b> The JIC reported that there had been around 300 security incidents on election day </p>
<p>itself, which had killed 30 Iraqis, but “the effect on the elections was not as significant as </p>
<p>had been feared or as al-Zarqawi and others had threatened”.</p>
<p><b>459. </b> On 3 February, Mr Straw told Cabinet that the elections had gone “better than </p>
<p>anticipated”, which “provided an opportunity to shift the debate about Iraq”. The ISF had </p>
<p>also performed better than had been expected.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry that substantial numbers of Sunni Arabs boycotted the </p>
<p>election, and those who voted did so largely on sectarian lines.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> He judged that there </p>
<p>were a number of reasons why Sunnis felt unable to participate:</p>
<p>“One was security; another was I think they hoped until quite late on that the </p>
<p>elections wouldn’t take place because of insecurity, and I think they felt very sore </p>

<p>and very excluded … not just because of the attacks on Fallujah, but because of </p>
<p>their exclusion from the process – what they saw as the government not paying </p>
<p>enough attention to their particular concerns.”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p><b>461. </b> On 3 February, Mr Chaplin wrote to Mr Crompton setting out a “snapshot” </p>
<p>of progress in drafting the new Iraqi Constitution and thoughts about the role the UK </p>
<p>might play.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Chaplin reminded Mr Crompton that they said that the TNA’s core task, as set </p>
<p>out in Articles 60 and 61 of the Transitional Administrative Law, was to:</p>
<p>“… prepare a draft of a permanent Constitution, following public debate, by </p>
<p>15 August and to present it to the Iraqi people in a referendum by 15 October 2005. </p>
<p>Our assumption is that the intervening period is for further debate and explanation, </p>
<p>not for amendment. There is scope to extend the drafting process by six months </p>
<p>by a majority vote in the TNA, but little indication of what the steps of that drafting </p>
<p>process should be. Presumably this will be decided when the TNA draws up its </p>
<p>own internal procedures and structures …”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> On the UK role in the process, Mr Chaplin wrote that it should include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging the UN to take a leading role in co-ordinating the form of the </p>
<p>Constitution and the drafting process with the TNA;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging broad political involvement and contributions from civil society; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>exploring practical support such as funding the production of useful material.</p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Chaplin suggested that “it would be good to do some rapid internal thinking, </p>
<p>or commission others to think about the pros and cons of certain constitutional options </p>
<p>in the Iraqi context” although any UK advocacy of a specific proposal would need to </p>
<p>be “discreet”.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> On 7 February, in response to a Parliamentary Question from Mr Bob Spink, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon said that the additional 220 troops for Muthanna which he had announced on </p>
<p>27 January would be found by re-deploying other UK forces in MND(SE).</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> Mr Hoon </p>
<p>said that the total number of UK troops in Iraq was 8,150 and was expected to fall to </p>
<p>around 7,900 by March.</p>
<p><b>466. </b> Ms Aldred and her team in the Cabinet Office co-ordinated a strategy paper for the </p>
<p>9 February meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq which focused on how to </p>
<p>achieve coalition objectives in post-election Iraq.</p>

<p>Paper Cabinet Office, 7 February 2005, ‘Iraq Strategy for 2005’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>467. </b> The paper defined the key elements for the coming year as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capability of the Iraqi Security Forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>outreach by the ITG to bring in those currently supporting the insurgency;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing in the international community and giving it a new sense of purpose; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reviewing reconstruction to find ways to make a difference quickly.</p>
<p><b>468. </b> The paper concluded that the UK should not increase force numbers in Iraq and </p>
<p>should not provide personnel for operations outside its current area of operations. </p>
<p>Instead, it should continue with the training effort in MND(SE), develop a strategy for </p>
<p>the Iraqi police service and offer support to the Iraqis in developing their intelligence </p>
<p>capability, and in maximising and co-ordinating international assistance.</p>
<p><b>469. </b> According to the paper, outreach to insurgents was primarily the responsibility of </p>
<p>the ITG. The UK and US should encourage the active involvement of Sunni Arabs within </p>
<p>the ITG, a relaxation of the de-Ba’athification rules and ensure that the arrangements for </p>
<p>drafting the Constitution were inclusive. Further work to accelerate reconstruction was </p>
<p>also essential, along with:</p>
<p>“… a clear <b>declaratory plan for MNF drawdown</b>, agreed with the ITG, which </p>
<p>includes milestones on the progressive handover to Iraqi control. It may not, at this </p>
<p>stage, require a timetable as such.”</p>
<p><b>470. </b> The Chairman’s Brief produced for Mr Blair ahead of the meeting on 9 February </p>
<p>emphasised the need to “task MOD to lead work with FCO and DFID to prepare more </p>
<p>detailed thinking on what we can offer” in relation to increasing the UK’s contribution </p>
<p>on “training, police policy, intelligence structures, and capacity building”.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Mr Quarrey advised Mr Blair to press Mr Hoon on the proposals for Iraqiisation, </p>
<p>observing that not all in the MOD were persuaded that the SSR effort should focus on </p>
<p>developing counter-insurgency capacity in the ISF, arguing instead that a broader-based </p>
<p>generalist capacity was more appropriate.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Mr Quarrey also advised that Mr Blair should press for agreement on as much </p>
<p>of the detail in the strategy paper as possible, and that it should be sent to the US as </p>
<p>“the basis for a US/UK strategy review”.</p>
<p><b>473. </b> When it met on 9 February, the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq approved the </p>
<p>strategy paper and agreed that No.10 should share an updated version with the US.</p>

<p>471</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Ministers agreed that when sharing the paper, No.10 should also raise the question </p>
<p>of US funding for reconstruction projects in southern Iraq, which had been diverted to </p>
<p>other parts of the country.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr Hoon said that proposals in the paper should be applied “vigorously” in the UK </p>
<p>area, where the UK had not yet made enough progress and there was a risk of providing </p>
<p>a pool of supporters for Shia dissidents.</p>
<p><b>476. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent a copy of the paper, updated to reflect the discussion and </p>
<p>including a list of niche contributions that other countries might be pressed to provide, to </p>
<p>Mr Hadley on 11 February.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> He suggested that they might consider a video conference </p>
<p>between the White House and No.10 to discuss it.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> In early February, Mr Asquith reported to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that </p>
<p>US priorities for the political process included ensuring that the ITG did not remove </p>
<p>personnel or structures (such as Committees) that worked well, outreach to the Sunni </p>
<p>community and establishing effective co-ordination with Provincial Councils.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>478. </b> Mr Asquith’s own view was that “the security policies will be rendered ineffective </p>
<p>unless the political process is adequately handled now”.</p>
<p><b>479. </b> Sir David Manning reported from Washington that President Bush’s policy was that </p>
<p>the US would not support specific parties or individuals in the process of forming the </p>
<p>new government.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>480. </b> The election results were announced on 13 February.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Abdul al-Hakim’s United Iraqi Alliance won 48 percent of the vote and 140 of the </p>
<p>275 seats, two more than were required to achieve a majority. In second place was the </p>
<p>Kurdistan Alliance, led by Mr Jalal Talabani, with 75 seats and nearly 26 percent of </p>
<p>the vote. Mr Allawi’s Iraqi List secured 40 seats and just under 14 percent of the vote. </p>
<p>The Sadrist group National Independent Cadres and Elites secured three seats.</p>
<p><b>482. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad told the FCO:</p>
<p>“We don’t yet know the final number of Sunnis who will be taking up seats in the </p>
<p>TNA. But in addition to Sunni Kurds, there are significant numbers of Sunnis on the </p>
<p>UIC (some six to eight Sunnis in their top 140 candidates) and Allawi lists, as well as </p>
<p>Ghazi’s five seats [Iraqis] and the Liberation and Reconciliation Gathering’s one seat.”</p>

<p><b>483. </b> In a telephone call with President Bush on 15 February, Mr Blair described the </p>
<p>electoral turnout in Sunni areas as “extraordinary”.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the elimination of the threat from Abu Musab al-Zarqawi </p>
<p>– the most visible part of the insurgency – would make a big difference and offered the </p>
<p>view that:</p>
<p>“Basically we had to reduce the insurgency to the hard core and then eliminate it.”</p>
<p><b>485. </b> On 16 February, the JIC issued an Assessment of the emerging political landscape </p>
<p>and of key political and security issues.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>486. </b> The JIC assessed that perhaps fewer than 10 percent of voters had probably </p>
<p>turned out in the Sunni heartlands, and only two percent in Anbar province. </p>
<p>Overall turnout was 58 percent.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> The JIC judged that the UIA was “likely to stick together long enough to decide </p>
<p>on the new Prime Minister and makeup of the Presidency”. Prime Minister Allawi was </p>
<p>unlikely to retain his post.</p>
<p><b>488. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“II. There are already encouraging signs of Shia outreach to the Sunnis, but the test </p>
<p>will be the degree to which the Shia are willing to include them in the Government </p>
<p>and in drafting the Constitution, and the extent to which Sunnis are willing to </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.3  |  July 2004 to May 2005</p>
<p>473</p>
<p>respond. Inclinations towards inclusiveness by Shia leaders will have to be balanced </p>
<p>against wider Shia expectations of dominating the Government and transforming </p>
<p>years of repression into real power.</p>
<p>“III. Without Sunni engagement in the political process, it will not be possible </p>
<p>significantly to undermine the insurgency …</p>
<p>“IV. The insurgents will maintain their attempts to derail the process. Sectarian </p>
<p>attacks, especially on the Shia, and attacks on Iraqis associated with the coalition </p>
<p>will continue. The announcement of the Assembly and the Government will give </p>
<p>the insurgents a new range of targets.”</p>
<p><b>489. </b> The JIC also assessed that Iran would want the new Shia-led Government </p>
<p>to succeed but would try to influence it. A perception of strong Iranian influence or </p>
<p>control over the Iraqi Transitional Government would undermine the potential for </p>
<p>Sunni engagement.</p>
<p><b>490. </b> In early 2005, consideration began to be given to whether the UK should seek to </p>
<p>make contact with those close to the Sunni insurgency who would “retain a malign and </p>
<p>potentially decisive influence unless squared”.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p><b>491. </b> To avoid creating distrust, Mr Asquith’s advice to Mr Straw on 17 February was </p>
<p>that the UK’s work should be undertaken with the full knowledge (though not necessarily </p>
<p>explicit agreement) of both the US and Iraqi authorities.</p>
<p><b>492. </b> On 22 February, the Australian Prime Minister Mr John Howard announced that </p>
<p>a 450-strong Australian Muthanna Task Group would be deployed to southern Iraq, </p>
<p>to “provide a stable and secure environment for the Japanese Reconstruction and </p>
<p>Support Group” and assist in training the Iraqi Army.</p>

<p>President’s visit to NATO and the EU.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> The record of their discussion indicates that </p>
<p>they did not discuss the strategy for 2005.</p>
<p><b>494. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald observed to officials across Whitehall and in diplomatic posts:</p>
<p>“You will have noticed that his [President Bush’s] formulations on Iraq, Iran and G8 in </p>
<p>particular owed a good deal to the advice he had sought from the Prime Minister.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>495. </b> On 24 February, the FCO briefed the AHMGIR on the election outcome.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> In </p>
<p>discussion, the point was made that the elections would “change the feel of our bilateral </p>
<p>relationship with the new Iraqi Government as they would now have the confidence that </p>
<p>came from having a mandate”.</p>
<p><b>496. </b> The FCO reported that several Sunni groups appeared to have recognised that </p>
<p>boycotting the elections had been “counter-productive” and there were signs some were </p>
<p>looking to join the political process.</p>
<p><b>497. </b> In discussion it was suggested that a “key objective” for the UK would be to protect </p>
<p>the provision in the TAL that the three provinces could veto the Constitution. Originally </p>
<p>seen as safeguarding Kurdish interests, this was now even more important for the Sunni.</p>
<p><b>498. </b> Ministers asked for a plan for “co-ordinated bilateral contacts” with the new Iraqi </p>
<p>Government as soon as it was in place.</p>
<p><b>499. </b> On 25 February the JIC considered the links between Syria and the Iraqi </p>
<p>insurgency.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> It judged that:</p>
<p>“Syria’s policy towards Iraq is one of limited support for the insurgency … Its attitude </p>
<p>to jihadists and Iraqi Ba’athists differs markedly: some concern and action against </p>
<p>jihadists; tolerance, even encouragement, of Ba’athists.”</p>
<p><b>500. </b> Mr Blair wrote a note to his Private Secretary on 25 February instructing that </p>
<p>Mr Straw be “put in charge” of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq and asked to </p>
<p>minute him each week with actions on “eg reconstruction in the South; Sunni outreach; </p>
<p>progress on security plan”.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Ms Aldred chaired a video conference discussion of the strategy for 2005 paper </p>
<p>with the US on 28 February.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> It was agreed that the UK should send the US further </p>
<p>papers setting out areas to be covered by a national policing plan for Iraq; a high level </p>
<p>security plan; and on a possible further international conference to follow on from the </p>
<p>one held in Sharm el Sheikh in November 2004.</p>
<p><b>March 2005</b></p>
<p><b>502. </b> Referring to negotiations on the formation of the ITG, Mr Blair commented to </p>

<p><b>503. </b> On 7 March, UK forces assumed command from the Dutch battalion in </p>
<p>Muthanna.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Glenn Torpy told the Inquiry that there was “considerable </p>
<p>concern” when the Dutch Government, an important contributor to MND(SE), announced </p>
<p>its intention to withdraw:</p>
<p>“Despite the serious gap this would leave in the force structure, which potentially </p>
<p>risked having to be filled by the UK, the FCO (and MOD) were slow to engage the </p>
<p>Dutch diplomatically to persuade them to stay, to the extent that when they were </p>
<p>eventually engaged preparations for their departure were too far advanced to </p>
<p>reverse. Although the Australians stepped into the breach the outcome could have </p>
<p>had serious implications for the UK, which could possibly have been avoided by </p>
<p>earlier and more substantive action in Whitehall.”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Lt Gen Riley told the Inquiry the Dutch withdrawal was disruptive for the MNF-I.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his view, the disruption was exacerbated by:</p>
<p>“… a great reluctance in Foreign Office circles to admit that what the Dutch were </p>
<p>saying publicly was actually what would happen and somehow we could persuade </p>
<p>them to stay, whereas it would have been much less disruptive to have recognised </p>
<p>the reality and either talked early to the Australians, who had given indication that </p>
<p>they would be willing to help if asked, or got on and made a contingency plan using </p>
<p>British forces, which we were having to do with the help of PJHQ and elements of </p>
<p>the MOD covertly anyway.”</p>
<p><b>506. </b> In Baghdad, negotiations on the formation of the ITG continued.</p>
<p><b>507. </b> In conversation with President Bush on 8 March, Mr Blair said that the US and UK </p>
<p>should not seek to influence the selection of the new Government, but that they should </p>
<p>try to “shape” how it would address certain issues, such as Iraqiisation.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>508. </b> On 10 March, Mr Charles Heatly, a former Adviser to Prime Minister Allawi, </p>
<p>reported to Mr Blair that the lack of a government was:</p>
<p>“… down to a combination of the Shi’a coalition list being badly divided with no </p>
<p>obvious leader … the Kurds making … unreasonable demands, and the large </p>
<p>number of groups/individuals getting involved directly or indirectly.”</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Heatly considered that protracted negotiations over the formation of the ITG </p>
<p>had exposed tensions between the political groupings in Iraq, which he thought would </p>
<p>be evident as the process of writing the Constitution got under way. He predicted </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>476</p>
<p>that Sunni/Shia and religious/secular tensions could be exacerbated by the fact of a </p>
<p>predominantly Shia religious government coming into power, with the new Government </p>
<p>set to take early decisions (including on the de-Ba’athification process) which would </p>
<p>confirm a sceptical Sunni audience’s worst fears. Raised political tension and increased </p>
<p>violence risked feeding off each other.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> On 10 March, at the first meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>since Mr Straw became Chair, Mr Straw explained that Mr Blair “had asked a core </p>
<p>group of Ministers to meet on a weekly basis to focus more closely on the delivery of </p>
<p>policy in Iraq”.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p><b>511. </b> The meeting discussed Iraqiisation, the political process, broadening international </p>
<p>engagement and reconstruction. Ministers agreed that the FCO and MOD would </p>
<p>circulate an outline of a possible security strategy announcement by the end of 14 March </p>
<p>and that the FCO would circulate a note on forthcoming international events on Iraq. </p>
<p>They asked the FCO to follow up concerns over the safety of judges, prosecutors and </p>
<p>witnesses in the Iraqi Special Tribunal.</p>
<p><b>512. </b> On 11 March, Mr Sawers sent Mr Straw a minute covering impressions from his </p>
<p>visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Sawers wrote that the situation was encouraging, which he attributed to the </p>
<p>“boost” from elections. Politics remained “firmly on a confessional basis”, but:</p>
<p>“… each community is getting organised, good quality people are emerging as chief </p>
<p>negotiators, and they are working for a consensus, building on existing agreements, </p>
<p>above all the TAL.”</p>
<p><b>514. </b> The Shia list had settled on Dr Ibrahim Ja’afari as its candidate for Prime Minister. </p>
<p>Mr Sawers noted that “the Kurds are the most cohesive group”, and “the Sunni Arabs are </p>
<p>beginning to sort themselves out too”, recognising in some cases that they had missed </p>
<p>out by boycotting the elections. One of the keys to the next phase would be for each of </p>
<p>the four main factions – Shia Islamists, Sunni Arabs, Kurds and Allawi’s secularists – </p>
<p>to be able to negotiate authoritatively on the constitution.</p>
<p><b>515. </b> Prime Minister Allawi had absented himself from the political negotiations</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and Mr Sawers suggested Mr Blair should call him to encourage him to take part.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Mr Sawers’ view, there was a need for a secular force bringing together Shia and </p>
<p>Sunni Arabs, to keep the Shia Islamists in check. He also considered that the Sunni </p>
<p>Islamists were uncomfortably strong.</p>

<p><b>516. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry that Dr Allawi was seen as “a genuinely secular figure </p>
<p>who was Shia but not sectarian, seen as non-ideological; a tough man, someone who </p>
<p>would have some credibility with the military”.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> For these reasons, Mr Asquith told </p>
<p>the Inquiry, it had been the view of “quite a large number, yes, from the Prime Minister </p>
<p>downwards” that it would have been better if Dr Allawi had stayed in government.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Mr Blair telephoned Dr Allawi on 14 March and encouraged him to remain in </p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>282,283</p>
<p><b>518. </b> The TNA met for the first time on 16 March.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p><b>519. </b> Mr Chaplin reported concerns about the impact of the delay in forming the ITG:</p>
<p>“… the longer the delay, the more frustrations grow and goodwill between the parties </p>
<p>dissipates … We have continued to press all our contacts hard to conclude their </p>
<p>negotiations, at least on the core package, before the inevitable break for Kurdish </p>
<p>New Year on 21 March … pointing to the loss of credibility both internationally </p>
<p>and domestically … The parties assure us that they are keen to conclude their </p>
<p>negotiations, and intend to wrap up a deal by the end of March at the latest. If they </p>
<p>show signs of overshooting that target as well, we may need to step up the pressure </p>
<p>with some co-ordinated high level UK/US messages.”</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>520. </b> On 18 March, Mr Blair reminded Mr Quarrey: “I need J[ack] S[traw] to do me a note </p>
<p>each week on progress (to keep him at it).”</p>

<p>288</p>
<p> He summarised their content as:</p>
<p>“The shape of an early Iraqi statement on their security strategy is under discussion </p>
<p>with the US, with a view to early agreement with the ITG. MOD work to deliver </p>
<p>Military Transition Teams in MND(SE), as part of the move towards regional control, </p>
<p>is well advanced. The continuing delay in the establishment of the ITG is a serious </p>
<p>concern, and we are working closely with the US to push for speedy resolution. </p>
<p>Plans for early engagement with the ITG are already in place. The concept of the </p>
<p>International Conference is being fleshed out, with a focus on inclusivity and donor </p>
<p>co-ordination. We are looking at how we can achieve both short and medium-term </p>
<p>improvements in the power situation.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Mr Straw described the benefits of an early announcement on a security strategy </p>
<p>as being “a sense of direction for the Iraqi people; and the beginning of a plan for </p>
<p>draw-down for coalition partners”.</p>
<p><b>523. </b> On the political process, Mr Straw reported that messages to Iraqi contacts </p>
<p>had emphasised “the importance of getting good people into the key security related </p>
<p>Ministerial positions (Defence and Interior)” and of the “enormous damage that could </p>
<p>be done to efforts at outreach by a significant renewal of the de-Ba’athification drive”.</p>
<p><b>524. </b> On international engagement, Mr Straw wrote that the objectives of a conference </p>
<p>would be “ensuring an inclusive approach to build a wide base of support for the Iraqi </p>
<p>political process; and a reformed approach to donor co-ordination”. The scope for </p>
<p>bringing other international partners into key activities in Iraq was also being considered.</p>
<p><b>525. </b> In the last week of March, the US and UK Governments were encouraging the Iraqi </p>
<p>parties to conclude negotiations to form a new Government.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>526. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told Mr Hadley that the UK was increasingly frustrated with the </p>
<p>stalemate and concerned about its consequences.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p><b>April 2005</b></p>
<p><b>527. </b> Lieutenant General Robin Brims, who had commanded 1 (UK) Armoured Division </p>
<p>during the invasion of Iraq in 2003, succeeded Lt Gen Kiszely as SBMR-I in April 2005.</p>
<p><b>528. </b> On 6 April, the JIC assessed the state of the insurgency in Iraq after the January </p>
<p>elections.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>529. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“A significant Sunni insurgency will continue through 2005 and beyond, but the </p>
<p>opportunities for reducing it appear greater than we judged in early February.”</p>
<p><b>530. </b> The JIC confirmed its earlier assessment that “there is no unified Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency”. Although a high level of violence remained, the atmosphere created by the </p>
<p>January election had encouraged some opposition groups, including some insurgents, </p>
<p>to rethink their strategy. The actions of the ITG would be critical in changing Sunni </p>
<p>perceptions. If it failed to respond effectively to Sunni concerns it would play into the </p>
<p>hands of the insurgents and deepen the violence. But if the political process gained </p>
<p>momentum, Sunni support for the insurgency would diminish.</p>
<p><b>531. </b> The JIC reported that the week of the Iraqi elections had seen more than 1,000 </p>
<p>recorded attacks by insurgents, one of the highest weekly totals since the invasion.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.3  |  July 2004 to May 2005</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>532. </b> Since the election the number of recorded attacks had reduced, and by the end of </p>
<p>March had fallen to below 400 a week, the lowest level since March 2004. Attacks on the </p>
<p>MNF-I, which made up 75 percent of the total, were down slightly whereas attacks on </p>
<p>Iraqi citizens had increased slightly. The weekly average number of casualties was 300.</p>
<p><b>533. </b> The JIC assessed the Shia militias as “largely dormant”. Muqtada al-Sadr was </p>
<p>concentrating on the political process but his organisation remained “fractious” and </p>
<p>the risk of some Shia violence by Sadrists and others was expected to persist. </p>
<p>Foreign jihadists remained “capable of mounting attacks with disproportionate impact”.</p>
<p><b>534. </b> On 7 April, the TNA elected its first Speaker and swore in the Presidential </p>
<p>Council and Prime Minister Designate.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> Mr Jalal Talabani, leader of the PUK, </p>
<p>became President. Mr Adel Abdul-Mahdi (Shia) and Mr Ghazi Yawer (Sunni) were </p>
<p>both appointed Vice-President. Dr Ibrahim al-Ja’afari, of the Dawa Party, was sworn  </p>
<p>in as Prime Minister Designate.</p>
<p><b>The Dawa Party</b></p>
<p>The Dawa Party, to which both Prime Minister Ja’afari and his successor Mr Nuri al-Maliki </p>
<p>belonged, is the oldest of the two Shia Islamist movements in Iraq.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>Although there are differing accounts of the details of the party’s formation, it emerged </p>
<p>in the late 1950s and was initially dominated by a young Shia scholar, Muhammed Baqir </p>
<p>as-Sadr, who sought to reverse the decline of Islam within Iraqi society.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>The Dawa Party’s ideology is based on technocratic rule within the framework of an </p>
<p>Islamic state.</p>
<p>After its formation, Dawa expanded rapidly until the Ba’ath Party took power in Iraq in </p>
<p>1968 and began a crackdown on Shia political activism, resulting in the imprisonment </p>
<p>and execution of Dawa members throughout the 1970s. In 1977, despite a government </p>
<p>ban, the party organised a religious procession (the marad al-ras) which was attacked by </p>
<p>police, leading to a wave of protests in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Dawa formed a military wing in 1979 and was proscribed by Saddam Hussein’s regime in </p>
<p>March 1980. Following a failed attempt to assassinate Tariq Aziz, as-Sadr was detained </p>
<p>and later executed.</p>
<p>At this time many Dawa members, including Dr Ja’afari and Mr Maliki, fled Iraq, and </p>
<p>branches of the party were established in Tehran, Damascus and London.</p>
<p>After narrowly avoiding detention, Mr Maliki left Iraq in October 1979, settling first in Syria </p>
<p>and then in Iran.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> He left Iran for Syria in the late 1980s, when Iranian security services </p>

<p><b>535. </b> Mr Straw reported the election of President Talabani to Cabinet on 7 April and </p>
<p>observed that it would be important to generate momentum for the new government, </p>
<p>and to ensure “people understood how much progress had been made”.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>536. </b> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon agreed that Iraq was moving towards a position where </p>
<p>a drawdown of British troops could, in time, be possible.</p>
<p><b>537. </b> In April 2005, an FCO delegation led by Mr Asquith had initial discussions with </p>
<p>a group judged to have influence on the political leadership of the Sunni insurgency.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Asquith’s report of the discussions concluded that:</p>
<p>“This was a worthwhile exercise … They were appreciative of the opportunity … </p>
<p>However, the opposition remains incoherent … Sunni distrust of the Shia political </p>
<p>leadership of the ITG is matched by exasperation with US forces whose practices </p>
<p>are strengthening support for rejectionists. The Sunni opposition leadership look </p>
<p>on us as the only honest broker around with the necessary influence on the relevant </p>
<p>parties. I made clear … that we were not in the business of imposing outcomes </p>
<p>and that this was an Iraqi affair, for Iraqis themselves to sort out.</p>
<p>“We need to encourage their political networking efforts, giving due weight to the </p>
<p>established Sunni political leadership. Left to themselves, the Iraqi parties will not </p>
<p>sort this out … We need to push the parties together, while avoiding appearing to </p>
<p>interfere in the democratic process. Discretion is key.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> Mr Asquith recommended that the UK should continue its contacts with this and </p>
<p>similar groups and press the US and Iraqi Government to make a similar effort.</p>
<p><b>539. </b> In a meeting with Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 13 April, Mr Paul Wolfowitz, US Deputy </p>
<p>Secretary of Defense, warned that there was a danger of losing the momentum </p>
<p>generated by the January elections.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> In his view, “Iraq was going in the right direction, </p>
<p>but not fast enough”. Sir Nigel agreed.</p>

<p><b>540. </b> The JIC assessed the impact of Iraq on the threat from global Islamic terrorism on </p>
<p>13 April.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I.  </p>
<p>The conflict in Iraq has exacerbated the threat from international terrorism and </p>
<p>will continue to have an impact in the long term. It has confirmed the belief of </p>
<p>extremists that Islam is under attack and needs to be defended using force. It </p>
<p>has reinforced the determination of terrorists who were already committed to </p>
<p>attacking the West and motivated others who were not.</p>
<p>“II.  </p>
<p>The Iraq conflict has resulted in an increase in co-operation between terrorist </p>
<p>networks …</p>
<p>“III.  Some jihadists who leave Iraq will play leading roles in recruiting and organising </p>
<p>terrorist networks … It is inevitable that some will come to the UK.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“V.  </p>
<p>Iraq is likely to be an important motivating factor for some time to come in the </p>
<p>radicalisation of British Muslims and for those extremists who view attacks </p>
<p>against the UK as legitimate.</p>
<p>“VI.  An Iraqi government that includes strong Sunni representation and speaks </p>
<p>out clearly against the jihadists would carry considerable credibility in the </p>
<p>Muslim world, and the ejection of foreign jihadists by them would be a powerful </p>
<p>message.”</p>
<p><b>541. </b> The JIC judged that Al Qaida had “capitalised on the Iraq jihad” and had benefited </p>
<p>in particular from co-operation between terrorist networks to gain access to a broader </p>
<p>range of operatives and support. New relationships across networks were allowing the </p>
<p>exchange of expertise and skills.</p>
<p><b>542. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely completed his tour as SBMR-I and sent his “hauldown” report to </p>
<p>Gen Walker on 16 April.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> Looking back at six months in Iraq, he wrote:</p>
<p>“… the insurgency has been confined to Sunni areas or to Sunni interfaces with Shia </p>
<p>or Kurd communities. What little violence has been seen elsewhere – 10 out of 18 </p>
<p>provinces see only 2 percent of the violence – can be categorised as terrorism.”</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Progress in MND(SE) had been good, with all four provinces likely to be under </p>
<p>Provincial Iraqi Control by March 2006, offering “the potential for considerable reductions </p>
<p>in UK force levels”. Set against that was the possibility that other troop contributors </p>
<p>would withdraw, creating a need to backfill, and the “yet to be articulated” US desire for </p>
<p>the UK to take on MND(CS).</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>482</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely reflected that:</p>
<p>“As a nation which contributes only about 5 percent of the forces and 1 percent </p>
<p>of the money, UK continues to exert influence on campaign direction and conduct </p>

<p><b>545. </b> Of the 27 nations with the coalition, only the UK sought to exert influence over the </p>
<p>US by committing significant numbers of officers to MNF-I and MNC-I headquarters. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Kiszely considered that the ability to do so “results largely from identifying key </p>
<p>posts and filling them with the right officers”. He suggested that the influence and </p>
<p>effectiveness of some officers would be enhanced by increased tour lengths:</p>
<p>“With the US military on 12-month tours, the 6-month UK tours create turbulence </p>
<p>and attract criticism. This is particularly the case for appointments involved in </p>
<p>developing relationships with host-nation officers and officials. We should identify </p>
<p>posts requiring longer tour-lengths, increase them to 9-12 month tours, and provide </p>
<p>appropriate support packages.”</p>
<p><b>546. </b> On 19 April, a CIG assessed the threat posed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s </p>
<p>organisation to British interests in Iraq, prompted by a statement claiming to be from </p>
<p>AQ-I which had appeared on several websites, some of which had previously been used </p>
<p>by al-Zarqawi for similar purposes.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p><b>547. </b> The statement threatened intensive military attacks against UK forces and </p>
<p>their allies in the south of Iraq, and also attacks against Iraqi “agents and spies” and </p>
<p>“collaborators” working with the UK.</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Although the authenticity of the statement could not be verified, the JIC judged </p>
<p>that “it must be taken seriously”. The JIC assessed that the threat posed in Iraq was </p>
<p>“diverse”, as al-Zarqawi had in the past been responsible for suicide bombings, complex </p>
<p>attacks and kidnappings.</p>
<p><b>549. </b> The JIC judged that non-military UK interests in Iraq, although not specifically </p>
<p>mentioned in the statement, could be under threat as well as military and civilian targets </p>
<p>in the South. Attacks on UK interests outside Iraq could not be ruled out.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> On 19 April, the Iraq Senior Officials Group was briefed that delays in forming the </p>
<p>ITG were having an impact on the constitutional process, “putting its already ambitious </p>
<p>timetable under even greater pressure”.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p><b>551. </b> Further delay was possible because of the TAL’s “lack of resonance as an Iraqi </p>
<p>document”. Delays to the parliamentary elections scheduled for December would mean </p>
<p>additional costs for the MNF-I in maintaining security.</p>

<p>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, Ms Aldred wrote to Sir Nigel Sheinwald: “as there is no </p>

<p>“… made the point that in circumstances where we were benefiting from the </p>

<p>very hard to explain why an increase in force levels of this magnitude was required </p>

<p><b>554. </b> On 28 April, Prime Minister Designate Ja’afari presented the majority of his Cabinet </p>
<p>to the TNA for ratification.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>555. </b> The list, which was approved by 180 of the 185 TNA members present, covered </p>
<p>two of the four Deputy Prime Minister positions and 27 of the 32 Ministerial posts. </p>

<p><b>556. </b> On 2 May, Mr Chaplin reported that many Sunnis had:</p>
<p>“… responded critically to the announcement of the new government … They are </p>
<p>unhappy that Ja’afari chose to put his Cabinet to the vote before a satisfactory </p>
<p>agreement had been reached on acceptable Sunni representation.”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>557. </b> Negotiations between the political parties on how to fill the remaining posts had </p>
<p>continued right up to the last moment. The British Embassy Baghdad reported that in the </p>
<p>end Dr Ja’afari had concluded that announcing a nearly-complete list was better than </p>
<p>announcing nothing.</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Dr Ja’afari emphasised to the TNA that the Ministers were chosen for their </p>
<p>competence and willingness to work as part of the team. Ministries were not fiefdoms </p>
<p>and a Minister was “not an emperor”. Speaking about efforts to ensure Sunni Arab </p>
<p>participation, he said the election results should be honoured but “the unfairness done </p>
<p>to our brother Sunni Arabs in those elections” should also be acknowledged.</p>
<p><b>559. </b> Mr Chaplin commented that, although the main Sunni parties had put forward a </p>
<p>number of prospective candidates for Ministerial posts, very few had been appointed. </p>
<p>Some suspected that Dr Ja’afari’s party intended to “impose” their own Sunni Arab </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>484</p>
<p>candidate for Minister of Defence. Mr Chaplin reported that UK and US officials were </p>
<p>continuing to encourage negotiation.</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Mr Chaplin reported that many Sunni Arabs were unhappy about the way in which </p>
<p>the new Government had been formed but were continuing negotiations in a “last ditch </p>
<p>attempt to secure acceptable Sunni representation”.</p>
<p><b>561. </b> The atmosphere had been soured by a series of incidents on 29 and 30 April. </p>
<p>A raid on the Baghdad office of the National Council for Dialogue on 29 April was </p>
<p>followed by a car-bombing of the same office the following day.</p>
<p><b>562. </b> Several senior politicians (including the TNA Speaker, Hajim al-Hassani, and one </p>
<p>of the Vice-Presidents, Ghazi Al Yawer) had complained about the Iraqi security forces’ </p>
<p>violent entry into a number of Sunni mosques, and the arrest of 32 Sunni imams on </p>
<p>29 April. Mr Chaplin had seen no evidence that the arrests had sectarian motives, but </p>
<p>they were perceived by the Sunni Arab community as such.</p>
<p><b>563. </b> Looking forward to the months ahead, Mr Chaplin commented:</p>
<p>“It remains clear that significant Sunni figures are seeking a way back into the </p>
<p>political process for their community. They attach more importance to having a voice </p>
<p>in the constitutional debate and retrieving their position in the next elections than </p>
<p>the formation of this government. But having been led to believe that government </p>
<p>positions are on offer, there will be a correspondingly negative reaction if these </p>
<p>hopes are dashed, which will not help the next stage of negotiations over the </p>
<p>constitutional process. The Shia meanwhile find the Sunnis disorganised and </p>
<p>unreasonably demanding, given their boycott of the elections, and even those </p>
<p>who do not share fears of re-Ba’athification believe that many Sunnis have not yet </p>
<p>adjusted to the new realities of having to share power. The Kurds have made clear </p>
<p>publicly their support for Ja’afari’s government, but would be very uncomfortable </p>
<p>if credible Sunni representatives were not included.” </p>

<p>312</p>
<p><b>567. </b> Mr Asquith commented in his evidence to the Inquiry that the momentum injected </p>

<p><b>568. </b> Lt Gen Brims told the Inquiry that the delay forming the ITG had created a political </p>
<p>vacuum that had been filled by street violence.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p><b>569. </b> In a telegram dated 6 May, Mr Chaplin outlined the key challenges facing </p>
<p>Prime Minister Ja’afari:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a progressive handover from the MNF-I to the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improvement in public services;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>managing the economy, including keeping inflation under control;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>progress on the Constitution; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>managing public expectations.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p><b>570. </b> Mr Chaplin added that the ITG had a clear electoral mandate and some </p>
<p>experienced Ministers, but also a number of serious handicaps, including the risk </p>
<p>of discord within Prime Minister Ja’afari’s political grouping, the possibility that the </p>
<p>Kurdish members of the TNA would seek to have him replaced, and other issues </p>
<p>(such as de-Ba’athification) “which could stoke up tensions within government to the </p>
<p>point of collapse”.</p>
<p><b>571. </b> Mr Chaplin concluded that “there are reasons to hope that the political imperative </p>
<p>of delivering results, and the awfulness of the alternatives, will force the necessary </p>
<p>compromises to be made”.</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Mr Chaplin reported on 6 May that there was “a widespread assumption that the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>486</p>
<p><b>The UK General Election</b></p>
<p>In the UK General Election of May 2005, Mr Blair’s Labour Party was returned for a third </p>
<p>term in office.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p>Following the election, Mr Jack Straw remained as Foreign Secretary and Mr Hilary Benn </p>
<p>remained as Development Secretary. Dr John Reid was appointed Defence Secretary, </p>
<p>succeeding Mr Geoff Hoon, who became Leader of the House of Commons.</p>
<p><b>573. </b> In May 2005, a note to Dr Reid as incoming Defence Secretary from </p>
<p>Sir Kevin Tebbit, said:</p>
<p>“Internally, your immediate focus will be on Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq, the </p>
<p>US-led coalition’s main effort will this year shift from providing direct security to </p>
<p>building the capability and capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces … significant </p>
<p>reductions in Coalition force levels (including UK forces) are unlikely to be possible </p>
<p>until 2006. This is 6-12 months later than our initial hopes. It inevitably has </p>
<p>knock-on consequences for the next planned increase in our military effort – </p>
<p>expanded stabilisation operations in Afghanistan – and the size of our force there.” </p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>574. </b> On 13 May 2005, Dr Reid’s Private Secretary advised Mr Blair’s Private Secretary </p>
<p>that the rotation of troops in progress in Iraq would result in an increase of 435 UK </p>
<p>military personnel in Iraq.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> This was a result of UK forces:</p>
<p>“… shifting their main effort from framework security to security sector reform … to </p>
<p>create the conditions to transfer responsibility for provincial security to the Iraqis </p>
<p>from autumn this year.”</p>
<p><b>575. </b> The Private Secretary added:</p>
<p>“At this stage, it is too early to accurately predict the force levels required for the rest </p>
<p>of 2005, but the next force level review, which will take place over the summer, will </p>
<p>provide greater clarity. This review is expected to report in September.”</p>
<p><b>576. </b> Mr Chaplin’s valedictory report, dated 16 May, observed that a “certain gloom </p>
<p>seems to have descended in London and Washington about prospects for Iraq”.</p>
<p>319 </p>
<p>He acknowledged that there was “certainly plenty of bad news around”, citing the surge </p>
<p>of violence that had followed the formation of the new government (around 70 attacks a </p>
<p>day with a “nasty sectarian tinge to much of the killing”). But, despite acknowledging that </p>
<p>his own perspective was limited to what he saw in the “Green Zone”, he pointed also to:</p>
<p>“… some encouraging signs … credible Sunni figures in the Cabinet … key Ministers </p>
<p>look competent and have been saying all the right things about delivering results </p>

<p>and inclusiveness … There are at last serious numbers of trained and equipped ISF </p>
<p>to deploy … With UK help, a coherent national policing plan should soon be in place </p>
<p>… Opinion polls show most Iraqis determinedly optimistic about the future.”</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Mr Chaplin saw two key risks:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the constitutional process would be insufficiently inclusive, so that the </p>
<p>debate “instead of being an instrument for bringing Iraqis together, will drive </p>
<p>them apart, with moderate Sunnis retreating into the arms of the extremists”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the Alliance would split into factions, with Muqtada al-Sadr deciding that </p>
<p>he could gain more influence by opposing the government: “Coping with Shia </p>
<p>unrest in the south as well as a Sunni insurgency in the centre and north </p>
<p>remains the nightmare scenario for any Baghdad government, and for the MNF.”</p>
<p><b>578. </b> Mr Chaplin considered that both risks needed to be taken seriously, although </p>
<p>in his view the second was unlikely to materialise unless Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani </p>
<p>died. Although there was an aspiration to agree a Constitution that would be inclusive, </p>
<p>“the missing bit is an inclusive constitutional process”.</p>
<p><b>579. </b> On 19 May, Mr Blair commented to President Bush that the delay in forming the </p>
<p>ITG had created uncertainty over its effectiveness.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>580. </b> Reporting a recent visit to Iraq to Cabinet on 19 May, Dr Reid observed that the </p>
<p>inclusion of Sunni Ministers in the ITG was encouraging, as was “their desire to be </p>
<p>identified as Iraqis rather than by their religious or ethnic background”.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>581. </b> Less comforting was the lack of Sunni participants in the Constitutional Committee, </p>
<p>which needed to be addressed if the process was to be successful.</p>
<p><b>582. </b> Mr Blair confirmed the strategic importance of Iraq to both regional security and the </p>
<p>establishment of democracy in the region. It was therefore essential to continue the fight </p>
<p>against terrorism and to defeat the “campaign of destabilisation”.</p>
<p><b>583. </b> On 25 May, Dr Reid told Parliament that after the forthcoming troop rotation </p>
<p>there would be approximately 8,500 UK military personnel in Iraq, an increase of just </p>
<p>over 400.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> He explained that:</p>
<p>“The reason for this small increase is in order to allow greater effort to be put into </p>
<p>the training, development and mentoring of the Iraqi security forces: this will enable </p>
<p>them to take on ever greater responsibility for their own security and so pave the </p>
<p>way for UK troops to withdraw.”</p>

<p>“we stood ready to help in any way we could”, in particular on developing the ISF.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>585. </b> Mr Blair committed to reinforcing the ITG’s message that it was “an inclusive </p>
<p>Government for all Iraq’s communities”.</p>
<p><b>586. </b> On 26 May, Mr Blair told President Bush that he was concerned about increasing </p>
<p>sectarian tensions in Iraq, and how they might be exploited by insurgents.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> He thought </p>
<p>that the US and UK should make sure that the programme of Sunni outreach was </p>
<p>pursued “with real vigour”.</p>
<p><b>587. </b> The newly formed Iraq Sub Committee of the Defence and Overseas Policy </p>
<p>Committee (DOP(I)) met for the first time on 26 May, chaired by Mr Blair.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p><b>588. </b> The Committee was briefed by Mr Ehrman on attitudes within the Sunni community </p>
<p>to the political process, and by Gen Walker on the military campaign and Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform.</p>
<p><b>589. </b> In discussion it was observed that the number of sectarian attacks was </p>
<p>increasing, and that in considering force posture in Iraq, the UK would also need </p>
<p>to consider the “strategic balance with UK military activity in Afghanistan”. It was </p>
<p>essential that operations in Iraq and Afghanistan each had sufficient military and </p>
