<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the military covenant and the Harmony Guidelines, which provided a framework </p>
<p>for the provision of welfare support to Service Personnel, including Reservists, </p>
<p>and their families;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the provision of welfare support during deployments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>changes to the welfare support available to Service Personnel, including </p>
<p>Reservists, and their families; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the consideration given to the effects on Service Personnel in decisions to </p>
<p>deploy troops, in particular in terms of the Harmony Guidelines.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> The provision of medical care, in particular for seriously injured Service Personnel, </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 16.2.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The preparations made for repatriating the bodies of those who lost their lives </p>
<p>serving on Operation TELIC, how their deaths were investigated, and the support </p>
<p>provided for bereaved families is addressed in Section 16.3.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> The problems caused by deployments consistently exceeding the Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions in respect of the provision of military equipment are addressed in Sections </p>
<p>6.3 and 14.</p>
<p><b>5. </b> The decision to deploy to Helmand province in Afghanistan, and the implications of </p>
<p>that decision, are addressed in Section 9.</p>
<p><b>The military covenant and the Harmony Guidelines</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> The concept of a “covenant between the Army and its soldiers” was first articulated </p>
<p>in the March 2000 British Army publication, <i>Values and Standards of the British Army</i>.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The foreword to that publication, written by General Sir Roger Wheeler,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> Chief of the </p>
<p>General Staff, stated:</p>
<p>“As a soldier in the British Army, much is expected of you. You may be required </p>
<p>to deploy on operations which will be dangerous, to obey orders which could put </p>
<p>your life at risk, and to live and work for long periods under extremely challenging </p>
<p>conditions. Your comrades, your commanders and ultimately the Nation will depend </p>
<p>on your courage, loyalty and commitment. They will rely on you to maintain the </p>
<p>highest standards of professionalism and self-discipline at all times. In short, they </p>
<p>must trust you and you need to trust them.</p>
<p>“This two-way obligation forms a covenant between the Army and its soldiers … </p>
<p>By volunteering as a soldier in the British Army you accept that, by putting the needs </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>Ministry of Defence, <i>Values and Standards of the British Army, </i>March 2000.</p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>General Sir Roger Wheeler was the military adviser to the Iraq Inquiry.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.1  |  The welfare of Service Personnel</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>of the Service before your own, you will forgo some of the rights enjoyed by those </p>
<p>outside the Armed Forces. But in return you can at all times expect fair treatment, </p>
<p>to be valued and respected as an individual, and to be rewarded by reasonable </p>
<p>terms and conditions of service.”</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The Armed Forces’ capacity to deploy and sustain expeditionary operations was </p>
<p>determined by decisions in the 1998 <i>Strategic Defence Review</i> (SDR 98).</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>8. </b> SDR 98 set out the UK’s defence policy and translated that policy into detailed </p>
<p>guidance for defence planning by using a number of “planning assumptions” which </p>
<p>defined the required level of forces, or scale of effort, required for specific Military Tasks </p>
<p>(see Section 6.1).</p>
<p><b>9. </b> SDR 98 stated that the UK should be able to:</p>
<p>“ – respond to a major international crisis which might require a military effort and </p>
<p>combat operations of a similar scale and duration to the Gulf War when we deployed </p>
<p>an armoured division, 26 major warships and over 80 combat aircraft.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>– undertake a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale (as over the </p>
<p>last few years in Bosnia) while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial </p>
<p>deployment – which might involve a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air </p>
<p>forces – if this were made necessary by a second crisis. We would not, however, </p>
<p>expect both deployments to involve war fighting or to maintain them simultaneously </p>
<p>for longer than six months.”</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The principal scales of effort defined in SDR 98 were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Small scale: “a deployment of battalion size or equivalent”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Medium scale: “deployments of brigade size or equivalent” for war-fighting </p>
<p>or other operations.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Large scale: deployments of division size or equivalent. The most recent </p>
<p>example was the UK contribution to the 1991 Gulf Conflict, “although on that </p>
<p>occasion the British division deployed with only two of its three brigades”. This </p>
<p>was “the maximum size of force we would plan to be able to contribute to peace </p>
<p>enforcement operations, or to regional conflicts outside the NATO area”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Very large scale and full scale: all the forces that would be made available to </p>
<p>NATO to meet a major threat such as significant aggression against an ally.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> SDR 98 also defined:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Endurance: the likely duration of individual Military Tasks. Each Service needed </p>
<p>to be able to sustain tasks for the required period, including where necessary by </p>
<p>3 </p>
<p>Ministry of Defence, <i>Strategic Defence Review</i>,<i> </i>July 1998.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>rotating individual units deployed and, where units were deployed on operations, </p>
<p>allowing units a period of respite between each deployment as set out in the </p>
<p>Service’s Harmony Guidelines.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concurrency: the number of operations of a given scale of effort and duration </p>
<p>that could be sustained by the force structure. SDR 98 concluded that “not to </p>
<p>be able to conduct two medium scale operations at the same time would be an </p>
<p>unacceptable constraint on our ability to discharge Britain’s commitments and </p>
<p>responsibilities”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>12. </b> SDR 98 also considered the “underlying problems of under-manning and overstretch </p>
<p>that we have inherited”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> It defined overstretch as “trying to do too much with too little </p>
<p>manpower”. One result was that units and individuals were separated from their families </p>
<p>too often and for too long. Another was that preparation for other tasks and longer-term </p>
<p>training suffered. The additional pressures from “persistent overstretch” contributed </p>
<p>to higher exit rates from the Armed Forces, which exacerbated under-manning. </p>
<p>SDR 98 concluded:</p>
<p>“We must break this vicious circle. To do so we must match the commitments we </p>
<p>undertake to our planned resources, recognising that there will always be the risk </p>
<p>of additional short-term pressures if we have to respond rapidly to an unforeseen </p>
<p>crisis. We need to improve recruitment and retention so that our units are properly </p>
<p>manned. And we need to use our manpower in the most effective manner, </p>
<p>particularly seeking to avoid unnecessary separation or disruption to individuals and </p>
<p>their families.</p>
<p>“The Review [SDR 98] has designed a future force structure matched to the level of </p>
<p>commitments we plan to be able to undertake. These structural changes, combined </p>
<p>with measures to increase recruiting and retention, will ease overstretch.”</p>
<p><b>13. </b> The Harmony Guidelines described the maximum time that Service Personnel </p>
<p>should spend away from their families (known as Individual Separated Service)</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> and </p>
<p>the minimum time that they should have between operational deployments (known as </p>
<p>tour intervals).</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that the Harmony Guidelines were developed to help it </p>
<p>“get the work/life balance right” for Service Personnel and that, as the name suggested, </p>
<p>these were for guidance and were not “rules”.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Each Service (the Royal Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force) derived its own </p>
<p>Harmony Guidelines based on an “analysis of historical norms and judgements, training </p>

<p>leisure at the normal place of duty/residence at place of duty”.</p>

<p><b>17. </b> On 17 January 2003, Mr Blair agreed the deployment of a large scale UK ground </p>
<p>force, comprising the headquarters 1st (UK) Armoured Division and three combat </p>
<p>brigades, to Iraq (see Section 6.2).</p>
<p><b>18. </b> There is no indication that the potential pressure on Service Personnel, including </p>
<p>with respect to the Harmony Guidelines, was a consideration in that decision.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The Service Personnel Board (SPB), chaired by Lieutenant General Anthony </p>
<p>Palmer, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel) (DCDS(Personnel)), discussed </p>
<p>the effect of current operations on personnel welfare on 21 January 2003.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The SPB </p>
<p>commented that the “shift to expeditionary operations was having a significant impact on </p>
<p>people”. The lesson from Operation FRESCO</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> was that “wider welfare considerations </p>
<p>needed to be taken into account in advance of decisions on commitments”.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed Forces (Min(AF)), told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that the Government knew that the invasion of Iraq would put additional strain on the </p>
<p>Harmony Guidelines:</p>
<p>“… we had been involved in both Iraq and Afghanistan, still engaged in Northern </p>
<p>Ireland, still having people in Cyprus, still having people in Sierra Leone and other </p>
<p>parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and still having a significant lay-down in the Falklands.</p>
<p>“All of that made it very difficult to meet harmony guidelines, although it varied </p>
<p>between the Services – the Army under most strain … and significant key enablers </p>

<p>within the Army … They would be under quite considerable stretch. So medics, </p>
<p>engineers, a raft of people who were under very significant strain. We knew that.</p>
<p>“However, what was the solution? That [Iraq] was then something we then had </p>
<p>to attend to.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>Early priorities and concerns</b></p>
<p><b>Operational Welfare Package</b></p>
<p><b>21. </b> The MOD provided an Operational Welfare Package (OWP) to deployed Service </p>
<p>Personnel. Although tailored to each deployment, it typically included access to </p>
<p>television and films, books, the internet, and a weekly telephone allowance.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> This support was provided “consistent with the operational and environmental </p>
<p>circumstances in which they [Service Personnel] are placed, and the availability of </p>
<p>resources”.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> In late January 2003, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), </p>
<p>asked senior officers to scrutinise the lessons identified during Op JACANA (a UK </p>
<p>operation in Afghanistan in 2002), and to report on progress in addressing lessons </p>
<p>relevant to Op TELIC.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>24. </b> Lt Gen Palmer responded on 31 January, outlining progress towards addressing </p>
<p>several of the lessons that had been identified, including the importance of a workable </p>
<p>“Welfare Telephone” system early in an operation.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The Permanent Joint Headquarters </p>
<p>(PJHQ) had made this, along with the delivery of mail, their priority for Op TELIC. The </p>
<p>ratio of Welfare Telephones had been increased from one to 50 to one to 30 to meet the </p>
<p>needs of manoeuvre forces.</p>
<p><b>Review of allowances</b></p>
<p><b>25. </b> From 1 April 2003, all units (Regular and Reserve) from which more than five </p>
<p>Service Personnel had deployed received a Family Welfare Support Enhancement </p>
<p>(FWSE) of £1 per week per individual deployed.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> The FWSE was to be used by the </p>
<p>unit to improve communications between families and deployed Service Personnel </p>
<p>(for example by providing internet and telephone facilities) and to support welfare </p>
<p>activities for families.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised the Chiefs of Staff on 9 April 2003 that he had reviewed the </p>
<p>MOD’s allowance policy “in support of Op TELIC Service Personnel and their families”, </p>

<p>individual cases.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> A number of changes had been agreed, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Longer Separated Service Allowance and Longer Service at Sea Bonus </p>
<p>enhancements would be introduced earlier than planned;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the introduction of new arrangements to support close relatives of injured </p>
<p>Service Personnel hospitalised in the UK; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enhanced support for Service Personnel and their dependants evacuated from </p>
<p>permanent posts in the Middle East.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The new arrangement to support close relatives of injured Service Personnel </p>
<p>referred to by Lt Gen Palmer was the extension of the Dangerously Ill Forwarding of </p>
<p>Relatives (DILFOR) scheme (which previously provided for two people to visit seriously </p>
<p>injured Service Personnel in hospitals overseas for up to 10 days, at public expense) </p>
<p>to include hospitals in the UK.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> The support provided to injured Service Personnel and </p>
<p>their families is described in Section 16.2.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The MOD reported in December 2003 that the FWSE had been well received.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A survey undertaken by the Army Families’ Federation (AFF) suggested that </p>
<p>communication between families and deployed Service Personnel was good.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The FWSE was increased from £1 to £2.20 per week per person deployed on </p>
<p>1 November 2008.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> The increase meant that a typical infantry battalion could expect </p>
<p>to receive in the region of £30,000 to support families during an operational tour.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>Delivery of the Operational Welfare Package</b></p>
<p><b>30. </b> Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that, rather than deliver a fixed OWP for Op TELIC, </p>
<p>he worked closely with PJHQ to ensure that the OWP evolved over time to reflect “the </p>
<p>views from soldiers on the ground”.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>The free parcel service</b></p>
<p>On 24 March 2003, in an exchange with Mr Frank Roy in the House of Commons, Mr Blair </p>
<p>undertook to try to ensure that arrangements to provide a free parcel service to troops in </p>
<p>the Gulf were put in place as soon as possible.</p>
<p>21</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… free parcels, two kilograms, engraved on my heart … this was a debate about </p>
<p>how far we could stretch the logistic operation. I mean, delivering two kilograms of </p>
<p>parcels to everybody in theatre over distances with … not enough helicopters for </p>
<p>operations, let alone for administration, was a real issue, but it was critical for the </p>
<p>families back in the UK that they could send to their loved ones … things that would </p>
<p>remind them of home.” </p>
<p>23</p>
<p>The free service was terminated in April 2004.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> In a written statement to Parliament, </p>
<p>Mr Ingram stated:</p>
<p>“The provision of a free packet service recognised the difficult conditions Service </p>
<p>Personnel were operating in and that it was not possible to provide the full spectrum </p>
<p>of welfare support normally available to Service Personnel on operations. Whilst </p>
<p>southern Iraq is not yet a benign environment, the level of welfare support and the </p>
<p>facilities available on Operation TELIC are now comparable to those provided in other </p>
<p>operational theatres.</p>
<p>“It has therefore been decided that from 8 April 2004 … this free service will cease.”</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Ingram visited Iraq from 13 to 15 May 2003.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p> His Military Assistant reported that </p>
<p>the Minister had been impressed by the morale of the troops, but he had been briefed </p>
<p>that it could be undermined by (unspecified) small-scale and easily rectified “irritants”. </p>
<p>Mr Ingram’s Military Assistant concluded:</p>
<p>“The Minister would be disappointed if we lost opportunities for ‘quick wins’ here </p>
<p>(though he appreciates that troops in theatre examine these issues from one end </p>
<p>of the telescope).”</p>
<p><b>32. </b> On 22 May, Major General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations </p>
<p>(Operations) (DCJO(Ops)), listed those irritants and the actions being taken to rectify </p>
<p>them in a report for Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Sir Anthony Bagnall, Vice Chief of Defence </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>insufficient portaloos (more could be supplied);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insufficient fresh rations (sufficient fresh rations were available; commanders </p>

<p>inadequate access to TVs (the absence of a final UK “disposition plan” for </p>

<p>of what was happening in Iraq, including by talking to soldiers in theatre.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>35. </b> A small team from the Army’s Personnel Directorate and PJHQ visited MOD civilian </p>
<p>staff in Iraq from 18 to 20 May.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> They reported that comments on the OWP:</p>
<p>“… ranged from a claim that there wasn’t a package in existence to the fact that in </p>
<p>reality it didn’t run smoothly. At Basra there was only one internet terminal available </p>
<p>from 0000 to 0700 for [military and civilian] staff to send messages home … </p>
<p>Telephone facilities were similarly limited …”</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The team reported that other issues such as the availability of exercise equipment </p>
<p>were being addressed by local purchases in theatre.</p>
<p><b>37. </b> The 28 May meeting of the SPB was advised that Service Personnel were currently </p>
<p>living in “basic tented accommodation, existing Iraqi buildings, or fighting vehicles”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>39. </b> Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that, initially, R&amp;R was taken in theatre but, as the </p>
<p>situation stabilised and in response to the needs of Service Personnel and their families, </p>
<p>this was extended to allow Service Personnel to travel back to the UK.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> Lt Gen Palmer </p>
<p>highlighted the costs of the initiative, particularly in terms of removing Service Personnel </p>
<p>from their roles and the demand placed on air transport.</p>
<p><b>40. </b> The R&amp;R allowance established in Iraq was two weeks, including travel time from </p>
<p>and to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Air Marshal (AM) David Pocock, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel) from </p>
<p>2005 to 2007, told the Inquiry that the practice of flying Service Personnel back to the </p>
<p>UK for R&amp;R had evolved over the first years of Op TELIC:</p>
<p>“… as far as I can tell, there was never a careful policy discussion about what we </p>
<p>were going to do and why. It started off as a means of getting the troops away from </p>
<p>particular areas of danger, hardship. They could have a break, clean up, a rest and </p>
<p>go back again, and then it gradually evolved from moving back from the actual areas </p>
<p>of fighting to perhaps out of the country …</p>
<p>“… it was never actually, so far as I could tell a formal policy. Like Topsy, it grew.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>42. </b> The demands placed on air transport by that practice are considered later in this </p>
<p>Section.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Lt Gen Palmer visited Iraq in early June 2003. He reported to General Sir Michael </p>
<p>Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, on 20 June that the OWP had been “well received”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The main effort now was to provide air-conditioned accommodation as temperatures </p>
<p>in Iraq rose.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> An MOD official advised Mr Ingram on 27 June that many of the “welfare irritants” </p>
<p>had already been resolved.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> In general, problems in delivering the OWP had been </p>
<p>caused by the rapid pace of operational deployment. The advice concluded:</p>
<p>“Overall, the OWP policy has held up well given the scale of operation and the </p>
<p>specific demands imposed in Op TELIC.”</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The MOD reported in July that, owing to the austere nature of the deployment and </p>
<p>the lack of infrastructure in some locations, the OWP had been implemented in stages.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The first stage comprised:</p>

<p><b>47. </b> Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that, over time, the MOD delivered a “very </p>
<p>good” OWP.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>48. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Alistair Irwin, the Adjutant General from 2003 to 2005, </p>
<p>added that a key factor in delivering the OWP was managing and meeting increasing </p>
<p>expectations.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>49. </b> The Inquiry heard mixed reports on the OWP from families and veterans of </p>
<p>Op TELIC. Limited access to telephones early in the campaign and the fragility of the </p>
<p>air bridge between Iraq and the UK were particular sources of frustration.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> The Inquiry put those concerns to Mr Ingram.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> On the issue of limited access </p>
<p>to telephones, he told the Inquiry:</p>
<p> “… at the beginning of a war phase, and shortly after it, it is very hard to deliver </p>
<p>full communication and infrastructure. Indeed, even the military infrastructure, </p>
<p>ie in terms of operational demand, was pretty fragile as well.</p>
<p>“So you couldn’t honour the commitment in terms of the amount of time that each </p>
<p>soldier … would have to phone back to their family, but as the lay-down became </p>
<p>more established, and investment could then be made in communications, and when </p>
<p>we had the communications infrastructure, we could then improve the availability </p>
<p>and the time …”</p>
<p>THE AIR BRIDGE</p>
<p><b>51. </b> In January 2004, in response to concerns over the increasing threat to Air Transport </p>
<p>(AT), the Chiefs of Staff agreed that only aircraft fitted with a Defensive Aids Suite </p>

<p> should fly into Basra.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>52. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, visited Iraq from 10 to </p>
<p>13 October 2005.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> In his report to Gen Walker, he set out the heavy demands on the </p>
<p>UK’s Support Helicopter (SH) fleet, and continued:</p>
<p>“If our SH capability is inadequate, our AT fleet is worse. The air bridge to theatre is </p>
<p>now so fragile that sustaining an efficient R&amp;R schedule is nigh on impossible. Quite </p>
<p>apart from the morale effect of inordinate delays, the difficulties with R&amp;R are now </p>
<p>beginning to impact significantly on the operational effectiveness of the Division. </p>
<p>The situation is so bad that I am asking HQ Land to re-examine, at least in principle, </p>
<p>whether we might not re-adopt 4 month operational tours without R&amp;R. Since I </p>
<p>suspect there will be very many reasons against this – continuity and our current </p>
<p>training cycle to name but two – we really need to take stock of our AT capability </p>
<p>in the round, especially in light of our impending commitment to Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Later that month, the Chiefs of Staff “noted” that the UK’s AT capability was </p>
<p>“unable to meet current and prospective demands”, and that General Sir Timothy </p>
<p>Granville-Chapman, Vice Chief of Defence Staff, would undertake a stocktake and </p>
<p>scope increased availability.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Gen Granville-Chapman reported to Gen Walker in December that the main </p>
<p>constraint on AT was the lack of DAS-equipped passenger aircraft to support current </p>
<p>operations.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> The decision that only DAS-equipped aircraft could carry passengers to </p>
<p>Iraq and Afghanistan meant that only three RAF TriStar aircraft were currently available </p>
<p>to support the air bridge.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Gen Granville-Chapman described the work that was under way to address the </p>
<p>shortfall in AT availability. A further three TriStar would be fitted with DAS, and a fourth </p>
<p>for DAS. Those aircraft would become available between May 2006 and February 2007. </p>
<p>The MOD had chartered civil aircraft to shuttle between the UK and a “hub” at Al Udied </p>
<p>airbase in Qatar, reducing the burden on TriStar. The first charter flight had been on </p>
<p>6 December.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> The deployment of additional forces to Afghanistan in 2006 would “demand a surge </p>
<p>in AT requirement”. To handle that demand, the MOD was exploring the possibility of </p>
<p>establishing a Forward Mounting Base (FMB) for TriStar that shortened the transit time </p>
<p>to and from theatre.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Gen Granville-Chapman also addressed a number of “more radical approaches” </p>
<p>including using civil aircraft fitted with DAS to fly into theatre, and procurement of </p>
<p>additional aircraft. On the latter, the only viable option that would make a difference to lift </p>
<p>capacity within two years was the early acquisition of a fifth C-17 (currently scheduled </p>

<p>for procurement in 2011). The MOD was considering “innovative finance arrangements”, </p>
<p>including leasing arrangements.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Gen Granville-Chapman provided Gen Walker with an update on the stocktake on </p>
<p>6 January 2006.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> After further work, the early acquisition of a fifth C-17 remained a </p>
<p>possibility. The “less good news” was that the Treasury now contended that fitting the </p>
<p>additional TriStar with DAS was not a legitimate charge to the Reserve, given that the </p>
<p>“hub and spoke” arrangement using Al Udied was now operational. Officials advised that </p>
<p>the MOD should continue fitting DAS “at risks”.</p>
<p><b>59. </b> In his post-operational tour report on 18 January, Major General James Dutton, </p>
<p>General Officer Commanding Multi-National Division (South-East), wrote:</p>
<p>“The reliance on only 3 suitably equipped TriStar C-2 aircraft to support the UK-BAS </p>
<p>[Basra Air Station] air bridge task has again created significant problems, especially </p>
<p>as one aircraft has been in long term major maintenance for most of the period and </p>
<p>the others have occasionally been required for Op HERRICK tasks … consequently </p>
<p>there is an indisputable need for additional Defensive Aids Suite (DAS) equipment </p>
<p>for air transport assets.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Gen Walker directed on 24 January that the MOD should “explore innovative </p>
<p>funding operations for the early procurement of a fifth C-17 aircraft”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>61. </b> In April 2006, the MOD’s Directorate of Operational Capability (DOC) published </p>
<p>its third report of Op TELIC lessons, covering the period from 1 December 2004 to </p>
<p>28 February 2006.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> The report is described in detail in Section 14.1.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> On AT, the DOC reported:</p>
<p>“The availability of air transport assets became critical in October 2005. The strategic </p>
<p>and tactical requirement for all aircraft to be equipped with Defensive Aids Suite </p>
<p>(DAS) in theatre has compounded the problem. The air bridge to theatre became so </p>
<p>fragile that the Rest and Recuperation (R&amp;R) plot became close to untenable in Oct/</p>
<p>Nov 2005 … This affected morale and the operational effectiveness of the British </p>
<p>personnel in MND(SE). The situation became so pronounced that HQ LAND was </p>
<p>tasked to look at initiatives that would allow a shortened tour length without R&amp;R … </p>
<p>the Op HERRICK deployment [to Helmand province, Afghanistan] brings with it more </p>
<p>pain rather than respite and, as a result, the imperative to improve our AT capacity is </p>
<p>stronger than ever.”</p>

<p>14</p>
<p><b>63. </b> The DOC recommended:</p>
<p>“There is a requirement to assess and improve our AT capacity as an operational </p>
<p>priority. The UK should consider civilian air charter to off-load capacity …”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> The House of Commons Defence Committee visited Iraq from 4 to 8 June.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p> On the </p>
<p>air bridge, the Committee wrote:</p>
<p>“During our visit to Iraq, we heard that air bridge reliability remained a key concern </p>
<p>among UK Service Personnel. We witnessed at first hand the disruption caused </p>
<p>by delays of flights in and out of, and around, theatre. The difficulties stem from </p>
<p>problems both with the commercial service between the UK and Al Udeid and with </p>
<p>the C-130 Hercules in theatre and the availability of RAF air bridge TriStar, VC10 </p>
<p>and C-17. Troops travelling home on leave are frequently delayed and this reduces </p>
<p>their time on leave.”</p>
<p><b>65. </b> The Defence Committee concluded:</p>
<p><b>“It is unacceptable that Servicemen and women, many of whom are serving </b></p>
<p><b>greatly in excess of Harmony Guidelines, should have their leave disrupted </b></p>
<p><b>by the MOD’s inability to provide a reliable air bridge.”</b></p>
<p><b>66. </b> The MOD ordered a fifth C-17 aircraft in July 2006, and took delivery of that aircraft </p>
<p>in February 2008.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>67. </b> In its 2009 report entitled<b> <i></b>Support to High Intensity Operations, </i>the National Audit </p>
<p>Office (NAO) wrote:</p>
<p>“The Department’s [the MOD’s] air transport fleet is small, consists of aircraft types </p>
<p>that are old by comparison to modern civilian fleets and is therefore susceptible to </p>
<p>mechanical breakdown. In addition, the integration of modern Defensive Aids Suites </p>
<p>on to these aircraft has caused reliability problems. The availability of the TriStar </p>
<p>fleet, the Department’s main passenger carrying aircraft, has been low. Of the seven </p>
<p>TriStar passenger-carrying aircraft, on average 45.5 percent since January 2006, </p>
<p>have been unavailable to support operations. Significant effort by those responsible </p>
<p>for the air transport fleet has enabled the Department to deliver the overall task but </p>
<p>the air bridge remains under considerable strain.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p><b>68. </b> On the fragility of the air bridge, Mr Ingram told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The air bridge … was very fragile. We were dealing with ageing aircraft, you just </p>
<p>need an aircraft to break down for a few hours and the whole thing is thrown into </p>

<p>personnel hoping to get home and then being contained somewhere else, whether </p>
<p>it was Cyprus or Oman or Kuwait or wherever …</p>
<p>“These were real issues, and there were not easy solutions to it.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>69. </b> AM Pocock, DCDS(Personnel) from 2005 to 2007, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The first time I went out to Iraq … the subject [the air bridge] was raised with me </p>
<p>more often than anything else and, when I came back, I immediately went to see </p>
<p>the Chief of the Air Staff, and he was already aware of it, but I made plain to him </p>
<p>that, apart from it being a morale issue generally, it was disastrous for the reputation </p>
<p>of the Royal Air Force. He understood completely.”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>70. </b> AM Pocock told the Inquiry that the problems with the air bridge were very well </p>

<p> He commented that </p>
<p>“if there had been a solution, it would have been implemented”.</p>
<p><b>Concerns over the effect of Operation TELIC on retention</b></p>
<p><b>71. </b> In late April 2003, Lt Gen Palmer wrote to Rear Admiral (RAdm) Timothy </p>
<p>McClement, Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff, Major General David Richards, Assistant </p>
<p>Chief of the General Staff, and Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Philip Sturley, Assistant Chief </p>
<p>of the Air Staff, requesting a subjective assessment of the likely impact of current </p>
<p>operations on retention over the short, medium and long term, and how retention could </p>
<p>be improved.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> RAdm McClement assessed that Op TELIC would have a positive impact on </p>
<p>retention in the Royal Navy in the short term (though there might be a slightly negative </p>
<p>impact in some areas, including the Royal Marines).</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> A key factor in retention would </p>
<p>be ensuring that Service Personnel had a period of “relative programme stability” after </p>
<p>operations, to enable them to take leave and spend time with family and friends.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Maj Gen Richards assessed that there would be a “net benefit” on retention in the </p>
<p>Army.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> However, much would depend on how the recovery and recuperation phases </p>
<p>were managed; the demobilisation of Reservists required particular attention. Measures </p>

<p><b>76. </b> Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that, as DCDS(Personnel), his “major preoccupation” </p>
<p>was to reduce the number of troops in Iraq quickly, to reduce the pressure on individual </p>

<p> The assessments of the impact of current commitments on retention </p>

<p>The MOD defines pinch point trades as trades or areas of expertise where there is not enough trained </p>
<p>strength to perform operational tasks without encroaching on the time provided between deployments for </p>
<p>recuperation, training and leave.</p>

<p>accommodation … The process had to be placed on a more scientific basis.”</p>
<p><b>79. </b> In advance of the 26 November meeting of the SPB, Lt Gen Palmer circulated a </p>
<p>personal “think-piece” on STP04.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> It described STP03 as “relatively good for personnel”, </p>
<p>although “recruiting and retaining Service Personnel is becoming increasingly difficult </p>
<p>and expensive as demographics change, expectations rise and technology evolves”.</p>
<p><b>80. </b> Looking ahead to STP04, Lt Gen Palmer assessed that, while the Services had </p>
<p>made significant progress towards achieving manning balance targets and premature </p>
<p>voluntary retirement (PVR) rates remained relatively low, “the current level of operational </p>
<p>commitments … is threatening to undermine or reverse the progress made”.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Emerging problems were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Army reported that Op TELIC was having a “marked impact” on tour </p>
<p>intervals, rendering it unable to meet Harmony/Separated Service Guidelines.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The RAF reported a significant worsening in their figures for Separated Service.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Across all three Services, pressure on pinch point trades was increasing. </p>
<p>Medical services continued to be a specific concern.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The number of Reservists available for mobilisation was falling.</p>
<p><b>82. </b> Lt Gen Palmer concluded that the MOD’s forthcoming planning round was likely </p>
<p>to be particularly challenging; the SPB would need to give direction on which personnel </p>
<p>priorities should be “reprieved”.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Mr Ingram visited Basra in December 2003.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> He reported to Mr Geoff Hoon, the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary, that, while UK Armed Forces were in “excellent shape”, he had </p>
<p>concerns for the future:</p>
<p>“Some units in Iraq have had exceptionally busy operational and training cycles </p>
<p>before deployment … I detected signs that the pressures of repeated long </p>
<p>separations may be building in some areas. We will need to manage this carefully </p>
<p>in the New Year …”</p>
<p><b>Supporting Reservists</b></p>
<p><b>84. </b> There are two key types of Reserve Forces:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces (VRF) who serve within VRF units </p>
<p>and usually train in the evenings, at weekends and for at least two weeks each </p>

<p>who still have a liability for mobilisation.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>85. </b> The VRF comprises the Royal Naval Reserve, the Territorial Army (TA), the </p>
<p>Royal Marines Reserve and the Royal Auxiliary Air Force.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> In 2003, there were approximately 40,000 members of the VRF, of whom 35,000 </p>
<p>were in the TA.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>87. </b> The Reserve Forces have three primary roles:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to augment Regular Forces for enduring operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to provide additional capability for large scale operations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to provide specialist capability.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Lieutenant General Mark Mans, the Deputy Adjutant General from 2005 to 2008, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that for Op TELIC, as for other operations, Reservists were:</p>
<p>“… more often than not mobilised as individuals to support regular Army units. </p>
<p>Sometimes they were mobilised in teams of 10 to 20, but that was quite unusual.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Lt Gen Mans described the welfare support provided to members of the TA:</p>
<p>“As far as the support to the Territorial Army, when they were mobilised, they got </p>
<p>exactly the same as the Regulars. So there was no distinction whatsoever. As far </p>
<p>as support to their families, the same applied, but of course, it is more difficult, </p>
<p>because the families of Territorial [Army] soldiers are spread far and wide …</p>
<p>“… when they are mobilised, the [Territorial Army] soldiers do support a Regular </p>
<p>unit of one form or another and, therefore, it is incumbent upon that Regular unit, </p>
<p>and particularly the rear party back at the home base, to make sure that those </p>
<p>individuals within the TA, and their families, are appropriately looked after in terms </p>
<p>of maintaining contact, and also making sure they are aware of all the support and </p>
<p>sustenance they can achieve.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Lt Gen Mans added that once a member of the TA was demobilised, responsibility </p>
<p>for their welfare reverted to their TA unit.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that it had considered providing a separate “welfare </p>
<p>pathway” for Reservists, but concluded that it would not aid integration.</p>

<p><b>92. </b> The initial call-out notice for Reservists for Op TELIC was issued in early </p>
<p>January 2003.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> By 19 March (when military operations against Iraq began), over </p>
<p>5,000 Reservists had been mobilised (comprising some 12 percent of total UK forces).</p>
<p><b>93. </b> All TA and Regular Reservists deployed for Op TELIC 1 (the major combat </p>
<p>phase of operations) were mobilised through the Reserves Training and Mobilisation </p>
<p>Centre (RTMC) at Chilwell in Nottingham.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> The briefing and preparation process at </p>
<p>RTMC Chilwell provided Reservists with medical and dental examinations, additional </p>
<p>operation-specific equipment, and information on pay and allowances.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> In early June, the DOC produced a short note on lessons identified on personnel </p>
<p>issues during Op TELIC 1; the note was sent to Mr Ingram’s office on 11 June.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>DOC stated that, although the mobilisation of Reservists had gone well, Op TELIC had </p>
<p>thrown up “many issues” including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Many Reservists had found themselves “financially disadvantaged” because </p>
<p>of mobilisation and deployment, or had not been paid properly.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some medical Reservists had been compulsorily mobilised from key NHS </p>
<p>jobs but were not subsequently deployed where they could use their specialist </p>
<p>skills. For many medical Reservists, it was their second or third operational </p>
<p>deployment in recent years and this might affect retention.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In some areas it had proved difficult to provide “active support” to the families </p>
<p>of deployed Reservists, because of the dispersed and isolated locations of </p>
<p>people’s homes, particularly in relation to other Reservists and military bases.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> The lessons identified were:</p>
<p>“A review of Reservist pay procedures is required to eliminate inefficiencies and </p>
<p>to take into account the financial penalties likely to be incurred by Reservists as </p>
<p>a result of mobilisation.</p>
<p>“A review of the mobilisation and employment of Reservist medical personnel </p>
<p>on operations is required.</p>
<p>“A review of practical and emotional support to Reservist families is required.”</p>
<p><b>96. </b> The MOD has not been able to provide the Inquiry with papers on a number of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>97. </b> The Inquiry asked Lt Gen Palmer what lessons had been learned from the </p>
<p>mobilisation of Reserves for Op TELIC 1. He told the Inquiry that there were “big </p>
<p>changes” between Op TELIC 1 and Op TELIC 2:</p>
<p>“We put in place a mounting centre at Chilwell, in order to try to administer them </p>
<p>better, because there were issues definitely about inadequacies in handling Reserve </p>
<p>mobilisation to do with their pay, to do with their jobs, and we were very involved in </p>
<p>trying to make sure … they could get their jobs back. Actually, I think we did have to </p>
<p>resort to law on a couple of occasions.</p>
<p>“We also made sure that they had access to the same packages as the Regulars </p>
<p>and obviously the same training, but I did take a number of criticisms from </p>
<p>Reservists who did not feel they had been properly looked after administratively or, </p>
<p>indeed, in a training sense, but … they performed magnificently during the operation, </p>
<p>and we simply could not have done without them.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>98. </b> In October, the Army issued instructions on welfare provision for Op TELIC 3.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>instructions detailed the specific support available for mobilised Reservists, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A TA cell had been established in theatre to handle any employment, </p>
<p>administrative and pay concerns.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All TA units were to ensure that they had a “proper focus established” to support </p>
<p>the families of mobilised Reservists, and that there was regular contact with </p>
<p>those families. The FWSE was designed to help with that work.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All units were reminded that on mobilisation, “a Reservist becomes a Regular </p>
<p>soldier”. There had been a number of cases where a mobilised Reservist had </p>
<p>not been given full access to medical and dental care.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The instructions directed recipients to take “particular note” of the “aftercare policy” </p>
<p>for demobilised Reservists. On demobilisation, TA soldiers should be advised that </p>
<p>they should re-establish contact with their TA unit or the Reserve Force and Cadet </p>
<p>Association (RFCA) if they experienced any difficulties associated with their operational </p>
<p>service. The formal departure interview should impart “the clear understanding” that the </p>
<p>Army remained engaged in their welfare.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> In December, an MOD report on lessons from Op TELIC highlighted the particular </p>
<p>difficulties faced by families of Reservists:</p>
<p>“The families of Reservists need particular consideration, as they may have had </p>
<p>little or no contact with the Services and may not understand Service structures, </p>
<p>administrative procedures, roles or jargon. Such families knew whom to contact, </p>
<p>but … still found it much more difficult than Regular Army families to find the </p>

<p>information and answers they wanted. This will be borne in mind in considering how </p>
<p>best to improve the support they need.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>101. </b> The report also stated that, in order to preserve the volunteer ethos of Reservists </p>
<p>and the goodwill of families and employers, the MOD had revised the “desired notice” </p>
<p>period for mobilisation from 14 to 21 days. Operational requirements meant that for </p>
<p>Op TELIC 1, some Reservists received only four days’ notice.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> The report did not specify what action would be taken to address these difficulties.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> In the same month, an NAO report on Op TELIC stated that some Reservists </p>
<p>received as little as two or three days’ notice, due to absence from home, postal times </p>
<p>and incorrect addresses.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p><b>104. </b> The MOD set out the role of the Reserve Forces in the February 2005 publication </p>
<p><i>Future Use of the UK’s Reserve Forces</i>.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> The paper stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In recognition of the fact that most members of the VRF joined to undertake </p>
<p>activities which were a contrast to their civilian employment, the MOD would not </p>
<p>mobilise a Reservist to take advantage of his or her civilian skills except with the </p>
<p>express agreement of the Reservist and their employer. This would not preclude </p>
<p>a commander on operations ordering an already mobilised Reservist to carry out </p>
<p>a task for which he or she was qualified, as a short-term expedient and where </p>
<p>no other alternative existed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While the Reserve Forces Act 1996 set a limit on the time any Reservist </p>
<p>could be mobilised (generally one year over a three-year period), the MOD </p>
<p>believed that this level of mobilisation was “unsustainable”. The MOD would </p>
<p>therefore, where possible, limit the time that any Reservist would be mobilised </p>
<p>to one year over a five-year period.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD would seek to provide 28 days’ notice of mobilisation </p>
<p>(21 days previously).</p>
<p><b>105. </b> In April 2005, the MOD introduced a new remuneration package for Reservists </p>
<p>deployed on operations.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> Under the new scheme, if Reservists were mobilised and </p>
<p>their civilian pay was higher than their Service pay, they could claim the difference, </p>
<p>including certain benefits in kind. There were additional allowances to compensate </p>
<p>for other losses.</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Reservists had previously applied for allowances to cover the additional costs </p>
<p>of deployment. The scheme required a Reservist to collate a great deal of evidence </p>
<p>of personal earnings and expenditure in the short time available before deployment.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>107. </b> The NAO reported that the new scheme was “generous and less bureaucratic, </p>
<p>and has been generally welcomed by the Reservists”.</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The NAO published a report on the MOD’s use of the Reserve Forces in </p>
<p>March 2006.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> The NAO highlighted the finding from its survey of Reservists, that </p>
<p>41 percent of those intending to leave within one year agreed that inadequate support </p>
<p>(relating to welfare and administration) played a part in their decision to leave. The NAO </p>
<p>reported that, while the most used form of support was the unit’s welfare representative, </p>
<p>some units had no full-time welfare representative to support deployed Reservists and </p>
<p>their families.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> The NAO recommended that the MOD should focus its attention and resources on </p>
<p>those welfare services which were most used by Reservists and their families, especially </p>
<p>those provided by local Reserve units. In particular, it should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that information supplied to Reservists’ families was written in plain </p>
<p>English;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that all TA regiments had adequate, dedicated welfare support, and that </p>
<p>similar measures were available for Royal Naval Reservists and Royal Auxiliary </p>
<p>Air Force Personnel; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve the welfare support available to the families of deployed Volunteer </p>
<p>Reservists who lived far away from the Reserve unit with which they trained and </p>
<p>those Regular Reservists who had no unit.</p>
<p><b>110. </b> The NAO also highlighted the lack of medical support for Reservists after their </p>
<p>demobilisation, and recommended that the MOD should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>undertake to provide medical treatment to all Reservists injured on operations </p>
<p>to enable them to rejoin their civilian lives and careers as quickly as possible; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>institute procedures for the diagnosis and treatment, through Defence Medical </p>
<p>Services (DMS), of Reservists who develop mental health problems after the </p>
<p>demobilisation process had been completed, as a result of an operational </p>
<p>deployment.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> In November 2006, the MOD established the Reserves Mental Health Programme </p>
<p>(RMHP), to provide enhanced mental health care for current and former Reservists </p>
<p>who had been demobilised since 1 January 2003 following deployment on an overseas </p>
<p>operation. The RMHP is described in Section 16.2.</p>

<p><b>June 2004</b></p>
<p><b>112. </b> In mid-April 2004, the US made an informal request to the UK to send additional </p>
<p>troops to Iraq.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> Section 9.2 describes the Government’s consideration of that proposal, </p>
<p>which focused on the question of the contribution that those troops might make to </p>
<p>achieving strategic success.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> On 12 May, Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff </p>
<p>(Commitments) (DCDC(Commitments)), advised the Chiefs of Staff meeting that the </p>
<p>effect of an additional deployment on “Harmony”, previously identified as one of the main </p>
<p>concerns, was now assessed to be “less stressing”.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Lt Gen Palmer wrote to Lt Gen Fry the following day:</p>
<p>“You know my serious concerns about increasing the current level of commitments … </p>
<p>At best, deployment of an additional brigade would reduce average unit separation </p>
<p>from our target of 24 months to 12 months. Within this, some trades and individuals </p>
<p>(including pinch point trades) will inevitably suffer considerably shorter tour intervals. </p>
<p>While recruitment and retention currently remain satisfactory in most areas, the </p>
<p>situation is potentially fragile not least because the risk is difficult to quantify.”</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Lt Gen Palmer suggested that, if a “do nothing” option was judged to be </p>
<p>unacceptable, the MOD should develop a “battlegroup only” option which would </p>
<p>minimise “the stretch on our people”. He also highlighted the difficulty of following a </p>
<p>decision for an additional deployment with the announcement of planned measures </p>
<p>to reduce manpower costs.</p>
<p><b>116. </b> The Chiefs of Staff considered the US request for additional UK military assets </p>
<p>to Iraq on 19 May.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> Although they recognised there were risks and benefits to all the </p>
<p>possible options, they agreed that the “best military option” was the deployment of </p>
<p>HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (HQ ARRC) and a brigade to replace US forces in </p>
<p>the provinces of Najaf and Qadisiyah (option six).</p>
<p><b>117. </b> During the meeting, Lt Gen Fry cautioned against the long-term effects on </p>
<p>the Armed Forces of an additional deployment, which militated against that option. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Palmer rehearsed the arguments he had set out in his 13 May minute to </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry, adding that he feared a “precipitant retention problem”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Gen Walker summarised the conclusion of the Chiefs of Staff, that option six was </p>
<p>the “best military option” although “there was current doubt whether it could be delivered </p>
<p>and sustained”.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs on 25 May, setting out the Chiefs of Staff’s advice.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary </p>
<p>stated that the option which would have the greatest effect and the least military risk was </p>
<p>the deployment of HQ ARRC with an associated battlegroup, and a brigade to replace </p>
<p>US forces. However, that option carried “significant penalties” including with regard to </p>
<p>the wider impact on the Armed Forces.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary set out those penalties. Deploying HQ ARRC with an </p>
<p>associated battlegroup would further reduce tour intervals for many Service Personnel. </p>
<p>Some 40 percent of infantry soldiers already had tour intervals of less than 12 months </p>
<p>(against a guideline of 24 months). The deployment would reduce tour intervals for </p>
<p>combat service support units to an average of less than 10 months; some units would </p>
<p>have even less.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Reduced tour intervals would effect training and future capability, and also </p>
<p>significantly reduce the time that Service Personnel and their families could spend </p>
<p>together. The letter concluded:</p>
<p>“For some, this may be the straw that breaks the camel’s back and leads to </p>
<p>experienced personnel leaving the Service.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> Holding a brigade at readiness, even if it was not deployed outside the UK, </p>
<p>would have even more significant impacts.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Given those penalties, and the fact that the situation in Iraq would evolve, Chiefs </p>
<p>recommended that the Government should deploy HQ ARRC and an associated </p>
<p>battlegroup now, but retain the brigade in the UK to be deployed if necessary.</p>
<p><b>124. </b> In late May, Lt Gen Palmer asked the Chiefs of Staff to agree that he should </p>
<p>develop a costed package of measures, focused on protecting untaken leave and </p>
<p>enhanced allowances, to ameliorate the “worst consequences” of the increasing </p>
<p>“operational load”.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> It was conceivable that an increase in the UK’s commitment in </p>
<p>Iraq would reduce tour intervals for some units, including medical units, to six months.</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Lt Gen Palmer advised that the MOD did not have the management information </p>
<p>to determine the extent to which increasing pressure on Service Personnel would </p>
<p>translate into worsening retention, or when a “tipping point” in retention would be </p>
<p>reached (work was under way to generate that information). Recruitment and retention </p>

<p>were holding up well, but there was already evidence that people were starting to feel </p>
<p>undervalued, particularly over the issue of pay.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Lt Gen Palmer concluded: “Every time we increase the operational load we </p>
<p>increase the risk of a sudden, serious downturn in retention.”</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Section 9.2 describes discussions between Mr Blair, Ministers and senior officials </p>
<p>on the deployment of additional troops between late May and mid-June. The extent to </p>
<p>which personnel issues featured in those discussions is not clear.</p>
<p><b>128. </b> On 15 June, Mr Blair, Mr Hoon, Mr Jack Straw (the Foreign Secretary), </p>
<p>Mr Hilary Benn (the International Development Secretary), Mr Paul Boateng </p>
<p>(Chief Secretary to the Treasury), Gen Walker and others met to discuss Iraq.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The meeting concluded that the UK:</p>
<p>“… should not close the door to the possibility of sending further UK troops. We </p>
<p>should keep the option open until around the time of the NATO Summit [28-29 June]. </p>
<p>But there was no pressing military reason to send them, nor were we coming under </p>
<p>much pressure from the US to do so.”</p>
<p><b>129. </b> On 24 June, Lt Gen Palmer provided an update on his work to develop a </p>
<p>package of welfare measures for Mr Ingram, at his request.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> Lt Gen Palmer advised </p>
<p>that, with only a limited understanding of the relationship between operational tempo, </p>
<p>separation and behaviour, he was taking a “broad view” of potential measures. These </p>
<p>might include new financial incentives for groups under “critical stress”, enhanced </p>
<p>separation allowances, improvements to Service Accommodation and measures to </p>
<p>protect untaken leave.</p>
<p><b>The decision to deploy troops to Afghanistan</b></p>
<p><b>130. </b> In February 2005, Mr Hoon announced that the UK intended to switch its existing </p>
<p>military effort in Afghanistan (around 1,000 Service Personnel based in northern </p>
<p>Afghanistan) to Helmand province.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser from 2003 to 2007, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that “this was a proposal … which came from the Chiefs of Staff”.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>132. </b> The 21 July meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy </p>
<p>(DOP) agreed in principle proposals presented by Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, </p>
<p>for both the transfer to Iraqi control of the four provinces in southern Iraq for which the </p>
<p>UK had security responsibility, and for the redeployment of the UK effort in Afghanistan </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>from the north to Helmand province in the south, with an infantry battlegroup and full </p>
<p>helicopter support.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> Section 9.4 addresses the decision in detail.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> The MOD paper which informed the decision advised that this option, which </p>
<p>comprised “around 2,500 personnel in total”, would:</p>
<p>“Place greatest pressure on internal MOD resourcing. It would impact on the </p>
<p>individual personnel deployed, particularly those in ‘pinch-point’ trades who may </p>
<p>have been deployed on operations significantly more than Departmental guidelines </p>
<p>advise; stretch the MOD’s logistic capability at a time when force level reductions in </p>
<p>Iraq cannot be guaranteed; and place strain on key enablers …”</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>134. </b> The MOD paper concluded with a brief report on plans for UK military drawdown </p>
<p>in Iraq. It cautioned that:</p>
<p>“… any substantial prolongation of the UK military commitment in Iraq at current </p>
<p>force levels would have significant impact on individual personnel, the logistic </p>
<p>feasibility of any commitment in Afghanistan, and overall resourcing.”</p>
<p><b>135. </b> The minutes of the DOP meeting do not indicate that there was any discussion of </p>
<p>the specific impact on the Iraq campaign of the proposed deployment to Helmand.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Gen Jackson was briefed, in advance of a 17 January 2006 meeting with the </p>
<p>House of Lords Defence Group, that:</p>
<p>“Depending on campaign progress in Iraq, there is potential for some </p>
<p>‘concurrency challenges’ in 2006/07. We must try to avoid ‘overstretch’, but not end </p>
<p>up ‘under stretched’ – particularly when the competition for resources in Whitehall </p>
<p>is so fierce.”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p><b>137. </b> On the same day, Dr Roger Hutton, MOD Director Joint Commitments Policy, </p>
<p>provided Dr Reid with advice on the timing and detail of the deployment of UK forces </p>
<p>to Helmand province.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> Dr Hutton advised that the Chiefs of Staff recommended the </p>
<p>immediate deployment of the full Helmand Task Force (HTF). That recommendation was </p>
<p>“crucially dependent” on fulfilling three criteria, including:</p>
<p>“Achievability within current UK commitments. The HTF, taken together with the </p>
<p>HQ ARRC deployment, calls on a variety of capabilities, and a lengthy and complex </p>
<p>logistic tail. With the continued commitment to Iraq through 2006, this presents </p>
<p>significant but manageable challenges, particularly for logistic enablers (including </p>
<p>air transport). During this period we will still be able to undertake immediate </p>
<p>contingency operations, but on a limited basis.”</p>

<p><b>138. </b> Annex C to Dr Hutton’s briefing provided more detail on key issues, including the </p>
<p>sustainability of the proposed deployment. It stated:</p>
<p>“It remains the case that, with likely timelines for transition in Iraq, the HTF </p>
<p>deployment is achievable without serious damage to Harmony, though certain niche </p>
<p>trades and capabilities (particularly air transport) will be placed under increased, </p>
<p>but manageable, stress.”</p>
<p><b>139. </b> The decision to deploy to Helmand was approved in Cabinet on 26 January.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The minutes record that Dr Reid “was looking carefully at where the burden on our </p>
<p>troops could be reduced, including in Iraq and Bosnia and hoped to be able to report </p>
<p>troop and cost reductions in coming months”.</p>
<p><b>140. </b> There were different views within the MOD over the effect of the deployment </p>
<p>on personnel. Lt Gen Palmer, DCDS(Personnel) from 2002 to August 2005, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that, as he left post, he expressed his concern that deploying two brigades </p>
<p>simultaneously (to Iraq and Afghanistan) would breach the Harmony Guidelines and </p>
<p>the Defence Planning Assumptions, and was “too big a risk”.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary from 2001 to 2005, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was apprehensive [about the deployment of UK forces to Helmand] and I made </p>
<p>my concerns known to my planning staff and to the Chiefs of Staff. I think their </p>
<p>view was that they could do it and it was manageable … since it was [the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff] who would actually have to ensure they could do this, I did not press my </p>
<p>objections fully.”</p>
<p>96</p>
<p><b>142. </b> The impact of the decision on the availability of key equipment capabilities for Iraq </p>
<p>is addressed in Section 14.1.</p>

<p><b>Concern that the Army is “running hot”, autumn 2006</b></p>
<p><b>144. </b> In August 2006, concerns emerged over the treatment of injured Service Personnel </p>
<p>being treated on civilian wards at Selly Oak hospital in the UK, and the adequacy of </p>
<p>the welfare package provide to them and their families. The concerns are described </p>
<p>in Section 16.2.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>145. </b> General Sir Richard Dannatt, Commander-in-Chief Land Command, wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, on 31 August setting out his most serious </p>
<p>concerns.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> His letter focused on the pressures on Service Personnel:</p>
<p>“… as an Army, we are running hot, and our operational deployments are well above </p>
<p>planned levels set out in current Defence Planning Assumptions … you should be </p>
<p>aware that, in my opinion, the demands of the organisation are currently greater </p>
<p>than our ability to provide satisfactorily for the needs of the individuals … Quite </p>
<p>properly, we often talk about an implied contract – the ‘military covenant’ – that as an </p>
<p>Army we have with our soldiers and their families and I fear that it is somewhat out </p>
<p>of balance.”</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Gen Dannatt stated that the concerns might seem misplaced, given that current </p>
<p>“outflow levels” of personnel (which he described as the classic gauge of morale) were </p>
<p>low. But the cumulative effect of the high tempo of operations, short tour intervals, hectic </p>
<p>training and activity between tours, and under-manning gave rise to “a severe risk akin </p>
<p>to a cliff-edge experience”.</p>
<p><b>147. </b> Gen Dannatt identified several pre-emptive actions to prevent any increase in </p>
<p>outflow, including:</p>
<p>“Away from the field, I sense that basic pay for our more junior people is becoming </p>
<p>an issue, as are some allowances, particularly those that are related to operational </p>
<p>deployment. I am not at all sure that a take home pay of £1,150 a month is fair return </p>
<p>for a month’s work in Helmand or Basra. But it is the standard of both single and </p>
<p>family accommodation when our people are back home that is probably the most </p>
<p>emotive issue …”</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Improvements in those areas would require a “modest shift” of resources from the </p>
<p>Equipment Programme into the Short-Term Programme.</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Gen Dannatt took up post as Chief of the General Staff the following month.</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Gen Dannatt told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“When the military covenant is in balance, then the engine [the Army] can do a </p>
<p>lot of work. When the covenant is out of balance, we have problems. I think we </p>
<p>progressively got out of balance as the amount of work we were being asked to </p>
<p>do increased through 2005 and 2006.</p>
<p>“I say this not in any shape or form as a criticism of any of my predecessors, but </p>
<p>merely as a reflection of the additional work that we were being asked to do as a </p>
<p>consequence of decisions taken to stay in Iraq until we had successfully completed </p>
<p>our operations there, but also take on Afghanistan as well.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>16.1  |  The welfare of Service Personnel</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>“The way to bring the covenant back into balance was to make sure we were </p>
<p>expending sufficient resources on looking after the legitimate needs of individuals, </p>
<p>soldiers and their families in terms of their pay allowances, accommodation, and the </p>
<p>equipment … you would want to give these people.</p>
<p>“That’s where I think we were deficient. That’s where we had to work quite hard </p>
<p>to get it back in balance. I know I said in 2006 the army was running hot. That is </p>
<p>correct … I think we were getting quite close to a seizing-up moment in 2006.”</p>
<p>98</p>
<p><b>151. </b> The Inquiry asked Gen Dannatt whether work to bring the military covenant back </p>
<p>into balance should not have begun earlier.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry that he had no criticism </p>
<p>of his predecessor, and that it was:</p>
<p>“… often easier to start something at the start of an appointment when you have </p>
<p>had the chance to survey the landscape … and coming from the position of </p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief … with time to go round the Army, [I] could sense both at </p>
<p>home and abroad the pressures building on soldiers and their families and deciding </p>
<p>something had to be done.”</p>
<p><b>Introduction of the Operational Allowance</b></p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Browne’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10 on 9 October, setting out proposed </p>
<p>new arrangements for supporting Service Personnel on operations.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> The letter reported </p>
<p>that, to reflect the current, high operational tempo and provide an immediate boost </p>
<p>to the lowest paid Service Personnel, Mr Browne had agreed with Mr Gordon Brown, </p>
<p>the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the Government would introduce a tax-free </p>
<p>Operational Allowance of £2,400 for all Service Personnel who completed a six-month </p>
<p>tour in either Iraq, Afghanistan, the Balkans or certain other operations. Proportional </p>
<p>amounts would be paid to those who completed shorter tours. The Allowance would </p>
<p>be backdated to 1 April 2006.</p>
<p><b>153. </b> The MOD had considered offering tax-free pay while on operations, but had </p>
<p>concluded that this would not target the lowest paid and would be difficult to administer.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> The letter also advised that the MOD would discuss the scope for abating Council </p>
<p>Tax charges for Service Personnel deployed on operations with the Department of </p>
<p>Communities and Local Government (DCLG). The failure of Local Authorities to exercise </p>
<p>discretion on those charges was a “regular complaint”.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> The letter also advised that the free telephone call allowance would be raised from </p>
<p>20 to 30 minutes a week.</p>

<p>30</p>
<p><b>156. </b> In his autobiography, Gen Dannatt described the Operational Allowance as the </p>
<p>product of “some journalistic pressure and keen discussions with the Treasury”.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He also described it as the beginning of his campaign to “improve the soldiers’ lot”.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Mr Browne announced the introduction of the Operational Allowance on </p>
<p>10 October.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Mr Browne raised the issue of Council Tax charges for deployed Service Personnel </p>
<p>with Ms Ruth Kelly, the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, on </p>
<p>19 October.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> MOD and DCLG officials subsequently met to explore options for abating </p>
<p>Council Tax charges. The MOD’s preferred option was a statutory discount of 25 percent </p>
<p>(which would equate to a discount of £132 based on the average Council Tax bill).</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Browne announced in September 2007 that Service Personnel serving in </p>
<p>Iraq and Afghanistan would receive a £140 rebate on their Council Tax bill (based </p>
<p>on a six-month tour).</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>Reports on recruitment and retention</b></p>
<p><b>160. </b> The NAO published a report entitled <i>Recruitment and Retention in the Armed </i></p>
<p><i>Forces</i> in November 2006.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> The report stated that, at July 2006, the trained strength </p>
<p>of the Armed Forces stood at around 180,690 Service Personnel, a shortfall of some </p>
<p>5,170 (2.8 percent) against the MOD’s estimated requirement.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> This figure masked significant shortages in 88 “pinch point” trades, where there </p>
<p>was insufficient trained strength to perform operational tasks while enabling the </p>
<p>Harmony Guidelines to be met. While 14.5 percent of the trained strength of the Army </p>
<p>had exceeded the Harmony Guidelines at some point in the previous 30 months, this </p>
<p>percentage rose to more than 33 percent for some pinch point trades.</p>
<p><b>162. </b> The NAO concluded:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although the Armed Forces had consistently operated at or above the most </p>
<p>demanding combination of operations envisaged by the Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions (DPAs) since 2001, and the MOD expected that this would </p>
<p>continue to be the case for some time, the Armed Forces’ manning requirements </p>
<p>had not been adjusted to reflect the current levels of activity. The NAO reported </p>
<p>that, while the MOD accepted that operating at that level could result in it placing </p>
<p>additional strains on its people, the DPAs were guidelines only and were not </p>
<p>intended to constrain decisions taken on the employment of the Armed Forces.</p>

<p>16.1  |  The welfare of Service Personnel</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were signs that the numbers of Service Personnel choosing to leave the </p>
<p>Armed Forces early were beginning to increase for some key groups.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A variety of factors influenced Service Personnel in their decisions to leave </p>
<p>the Services, but workload, separation and the impact on family life were </p>
<p>key factors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Service Personnel considered that the increased operational tempo had led </p>
<p>to heavier workloads and more separation from families.</p>
<p><b>163. </b> The NAO reported that the MOD was successfully using a range of short-term </p>
<p>measures (including financial incentives) to improve retention and alleviate </p>
<p>under-manning.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> The NAO also reported that the MOD was facing current and future challenges </p>
<p>to its ability to recruit sufficient numbers of new entrants as a result of demographic </p>
<p>changes, changing attitudes to careers, and negative publicity affecting public </p>
<p>perceptions of the Armed Forces. The MOD was taking steps to respond to each of </p>
<p>those challenges.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The NAO made a number of recommendations, including:</p>
<p><b>“The Department should review the overall manning requirements within </b></p>
<p><b>individual operational pinch point trade groups to determine whether they are </b></p>
<p><b>set at sufficient levels to support enduring operational commitments.</b></p>
<p><b>“The Department is constrained in its ability to reduce the operational tempo, </b></p>
<p><b>which is impacting on personnel, but should look to investigate measures to </b></p>
<p><b>provide greater stability and certainty of work patterns for personnel between </b></p>
<p><b>operational deployments. Whilst recognising the limitations in how much </b></p>
<p><b>workload can be reduced, the Department should look to improve its ability </b></p>
<p><b>to let serving personnel know their work patterns over a longer time horizon.”</b></p>
<p><b>166. </b> Mr Bill Jeffrey, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, responded to these conclusions </p>
<p>later that month in his evidence to the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) during its </p>
<p>consideration of the NAO’s report.</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> He argued that frequency of deployment was only </p>
<p>one factor in people’s decisions to stay or leave, and that polling and opinion survey </p>
<p>evidence suggested that it was not quite as significant a factor as it might appear.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Jeffrey told the PAC that he agreed with the view expressed by Ministers, that </p>
<p>the Armed Forces were “stretched quite significantly, by the combination of deployments </p>
<p>in Iraq and Afghanistan with other things”, but not overstretched. He described </p>
<p>overstretch as the inability of the Armed Forces to fulfil the tasks allocated to them.</p>

<p>32</p>
<p><b>168. </b> He also stated that there was not a direct link between the MOD’s Defence </p>
<p>Planning Assumptions and the “degree of stretch”. Each operation was different and </p>
<p>required different capabilities. Deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan had stretched </p>
<p>different capabilities to different degrees; it was a “matter of military judgement” whether </p>
<p>the Armed Forces were overstretched. Manning requirements (which flowed from the </p>
<p>Defence Planning Assumptions) would be reviewed at the next spending review.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> In early March 2007, Gen Dannatt wrote to Mr Browne:</p>
<p>“Two overall themes dominated my introductory letter [of 31 August 2006]: the Army </p>
<p>is running hot; and the ‘military covenant’ is out of balance. I am pleased to say </p>
<p>that I think both these concerns are now well understood across the Department </p>
<p>and, importantly, we are taking steps to address both. Nevertheless … the level </p>
<p>of operational commitments is still well above Defence Planning Assumptions and </p>
<p>looks set to remain so for some years. There is now an acceptance, however, </p>
<p>that the Army is effectively <i>fully</i> operationally committed and hence any rebalance </p>
<p>between theatres – as we will undertake this year in Iraq and Afghanistan – has </p>
<p>to be a ‘zero sum’…”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Gen Dannatt:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>welcomed the Operational Allowance and the recent pay award which together </p>
<p>sent Service Personnel a “powerful message” on how highly they were valued;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirmed that the “general care” provided to casualties was, slowly, improving; </p>
<p>the issue would continue to require constant, senior level attention; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>restated his concerns that there was a risk of a “cliff-edge fall” in Army manning </p>
<p>(although retention was holding up, recruitment was falling).</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The PAC published its report on recruitment and retention in the Armed Forces </p>
<p>in June 2007.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> It echoed the conclusions and recommendations of the NAO’s </p>
<p>November 2006 report. The PAC reported that:</p>
<p>“Deployments overseas have been more frequent because the Department has </p>
<p>been operating above Defence Planning Assumptions for several years and </p>
<p>manning levels have not kept pace with commitments … Decisions about whether </p>
<p>the Armed Forces can undertake operations above the Assumptions are matter </p>
<p>of military judgement. The Department intends to review [the] Defence Planning </p>
<p>Assumptions and the funding of the Armed Forces in the light of the demands </p>
<p>placed on them, as part of the next Comprehensive Spending Review.”</p>

<p><b>away from home are factors causing people to leave the Armed Forces. </b>More </p>
<p>than 15 percent of Army Personnel are away from home more often than is planned </p>
<p>for under the Department’s ‘Harmony’ Guidelines which are being consistently </p>
<p>broken. The Department has little scope to reduce the operational tempo which is </p>
<p>impacting on personnel but in case of enduring operations, such as those in Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan, it needs to provide people with greater stability of work patterns.</p>
<p><b>“There are indicators of overstretch in specific areas, such as the severe </b></p>
<p><b>shortfalls in personnel in some specialist trades, such as nurses, linguists </b></p>
<p><b>and leading hands, and the routine breaking of harmony guidelines.</b> The longer </p>
<p>this situation continues the more it will begin to affect operational capability. The </p>
<p>Department maintains that the Armed Forces are stretched, but not overstretched, </p>
<p>and would only be overstretched if there was a failure to meet military commitments. </p>
<p>But the Department also needs to ascertain the ‘tipping points’ where the degree </p>
<p>of stretch itself precipitates the loss of scarce skills, putting operational capability </p>
<p>at risk.”</p>
<p><b>173. </b> The Inquiry asked AM Pocock what he understood by the concept of </p>
<p>“overstretch”.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“This is a subject where it is easy to let the heart rule the mind. If we are going </p>
<p>to be completely objective about it, I would say there are two things … can we </p>
<p>retain our people? And … are we doing them long-term harm? The first one, for </p>
<p>virtually the whole period of the 2000’s, certainly up to 2007, retention was virtually </p>
<p>static. The Services were short of people, yes, but that was largely down to </p>
<p>recruitment issues …</p>
<p>“On the subject of, ‘Were we doing our people harm?’ we didn’t know, but we were </p>
<p>looking really hard [at that issue] …”</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Vice Admiral (VAdm) Peter Wilkinson, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Personnel) </p>
<p>from 2007, added that, in his view, the Harmony Guidelines provided a useful, objective </p>
<p>measure of the degree of stretch:</p>
<p>“I think they [the Harmony Guidelines] were a very good check on the department </p>
<p>to make sure they understood, perhaps better than before, what actually they were </p>
<p>asking of their people.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>34</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Lt Gen Mans told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… recruiting is quite a complex area, so although … on balance, I think Iraq was </p>
<p>positive [for recruitment], there were some other issues which made recruiting more </p>
<p>difficult. At this stage, the economy in the country was doing very well and, therefore, </p>
<p>unemployment was comparatively low. Therefore, we were competing for recruits in </p>
<p>quite a difficult market in that respect. There were other issues associated with the </p>
<p>phrase that has been used before, ‘gatekeepers’, parents and teachers. Were they </p>
<p>actually going to encourage either their children or their pupils to join the military? </p>
<p>Well, on balance, they probably weren’t, in terms of that sort of overall perception. </p>
<p>So overall, you had to take into consideration all these other rather complex factors, </p>
<p>because the army was under-recruited during the period in question.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p><b>The impact of operations on the Harmony Guidelines</b></p>
<p><b>176. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that, since 2002, the Armed Forces had been </p>
<p>consistently operating at or above the level of concurrency defined in SDR 98.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That had “inevitably constrained” their ability to meet Harmony Guidelines particularly for </p>
<p>Service Personnel in “Pinch Point specialist trades”.</p>
<p><b>177. </b> The MOD provided the Inquiry with figures for the percentage of Service Personnel </p>
<p>in each Service for whom the Harmony Guidelines on Individual Separated Service </p>
<p>were breached between 2002 and 2009; these figures are presented at the end of this </p>
<p>Section.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> The Navy’s Guidelines were breached in respect of less that 1 percent of </p>
<p>Navy Personnel in each of the years covered by the Inquiry. The Army’s Guidelines were </p>
<p>breached in respect of over 18 percent of Army Personnel in early 2004 (the first period </p>
<p>for which data is available), falling to 10 percent in early 2007. The RAF’s Guidelines </p>
<p>were breached in respect of between 2 and 10 percent of RAF Personnel over the </p>
<p>period covered by the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>178. </b> Professor Christopher Dandeker, Professor of Military Sociology at King’s College </p>
<p>London and Co-Director of the King’s Centre for Military Health Research, told the </p>
<p>House of Commons Defence Committee in March 2008:</p>
<p>“… so far as our own research is concerned … I think that the Harmony Guidelines </p>
<p>have been well constructed because the evidence suggests that if you stay within </p>
<p>them they [Service Personnel] do not suffer; if you go beyond them there is a </p>
<p>20 to 50 percent likelihood that they will suffer in terms of PTSD [Post Traumatic </p>
<p>Stress Disorder].”</p>

<p>35</p>
<p><b>179. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, AM Pocock questioned whether Professor Dandeker </p>
<p>was right to suggest that the Harmony Guidelines were an appropriate basis for </p>
<p>assessing the effect of operational deployment on individuals.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> The Guidelines had </p>
<p>been derived in a straightforward way from the planning assumptions used in SDR 98 </p>
<p>(“what operations have we got? How many people have we got? … that means that they </p>
<p>can spend this long away”). AM Pocock’s focus had been on the broader relationship </p>
<p>between time deployed on operations and the risk of mental health issues.</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Lt Gen Palmer told the Inquiry that, while his “prime concern” with regard to </p>
<p>reducing tour intervals was for individuals, he was also concerned that reduced tour </p>
<p>intervals could affect operational capability, as units would not be able to undertake </p>
<p>collective training and other development and preparatory activities.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>Rebuilding the military covenant</b></p>
<p><b>181. </b> In September 2007, in response to growing concerns that the military covenant </p>
<p>was being steadily undermined, the Royal British Legion (RBL) launched its “Honour </p>
<p>the Covenant” campaign.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> The RBL argued that the covenant was being breached with </p>
<p>respect to three key issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the operation of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>healthcare and welfare support for serving Service Personnel, their dependants </p>
<p>and veterans; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for bereaved families at inquests.</p>
<p><b>182. </b> In July 2008, partly in response to that campaign and the support it generated, </p>
<p>the Government published a command paper entitled <i>The Nation’s Commitment: </i></p>
<p><i>Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and Veterans </i></p>
<p>(known as the <i>Service Personnel Command Paper</i>).</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> The paper was underpinned </p>
<p>by two principles:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to end any disadvantage that armed service imposes upon Service Personnel, </p>
<p>their families and veterans; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to better support and recognise those who have been wounded in the service </p>
<p>of their country.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> The paper covered a wide range of topics: compensation, health, housing, </p>
<p>education and skills, transport, support for families, benefits, careers and pay.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>184. </b> Mr Bob Ainsworth, the Minister of State for the Armed Forces, described the </p>
<p>production of the Command Paper to the Inquiry as an:</p>
<p>“… opportunity … to get for the first time at every single area of Government </p>
<p>and deal with the things that had never been given the importance that they had </p>
<p>been given before. There are lots of ways in which Government accidentally, local </p>
<p>Government and central Government, discriminates against our Armed Forces </p>
<p>because of the juxtaposition of the way that services are delivered and the way that </p>
<p>we make them work and the way that we keep moving them around … So in the </p>
<p>Services Personnel Command Paper what I wanted to try to do was sweep up as </p>
<p>many of those complaints as there were, analyse them, see whether or not there </p>
<p>was a reality to them and have them dealt with as a one-off process, but set up an </p>
<p>ongoing process.”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Mr Ainsworth went on to describe how the Command Paper was used to </p>
<p>co-ordinate the Government’s response to veterans’ needs, including on issues which </p>
<p>had not been explicitly considered in the paper:</p>
<p>“We had the Prime Minister’s stamp on the <i>Service Personnel Command Paper</i>. </p>
<p>We were able to use that as we went round different departments and say ‘This </p>
<p>is the Government’s intent’ …</p>
<p>“I had problems from different Departments, but that’s understandable … </p>
<p>Government tends to work in silos … So you have to go political in order to get those </p>
<p>things sorted out.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>186. </b> VAdm Wilkinson told the Inquiry that the implementation of the Command Paper </p>
<p>had been challenging, but that progress had been made:</p>
<p>“The challenges were that there was very little new money attached to the proposals </p>
<p>and therefore, to gain the support of other Government departments was very </p>
<p>difficult … the second challenge was to make the gains made enduring. I think we </p>
<p>have achieved both of those, in that other Government departments were made to </p>
<p>change their plans and programmes to take account of the Command Paper …”</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>187. </b> In May 2010, the new Government committed to “work to rebuild the Military </p>
<p>Covenant”.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>188. </b> An independent Task Force on the Military Covenant, chaired by Professor </p>
<p>Hew Strachan, was established in summer 2010 to inform that work.</p>

<p>Reference of the Task Force were to identify innovative ways in which the Government, </p>
<p>and society as a whole, could fulfil its obligation to rebuild the covenant.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> The Government published a written <i>Armed Forces Covenant </i>in May 2011.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <i>Covenant</i> incorporated a number of the Task Force’s recommendations. The </p>
<p><i>Covenant</i> stated that members of the Armed Forces should expect respect, support </p>
<p>and fair treatment in return for the sacrifices they made on behalf of the nation. The </p>
<p><i>Covenant </i>set out two core principles:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No current or former member of the Armed Forces, or their families, should be </p>
<p>at a disadvantage compared with other citizens in the provision of public and </p>
<p>commercial services.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Special consideration was appropriate in some cases, particularly for those who </p>
<p>had been injured or bereaved.</p>
<p><b>190. </b> These core principles were enshrined in law in the Armed Forces Act 2011.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Act did not create legally enforceable rights for Service Personnel, but required the </p>
<p>Defence Secretary to report annually to Parliament on the Covenant with a particular </p>
<p>focus on four areas: healthcare, education, housing and the operation of inquests.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions and lessons on the pressures on Service Personnel and </p>
<p>the support provided to them and their families are set out in Section 16.4.</p>
