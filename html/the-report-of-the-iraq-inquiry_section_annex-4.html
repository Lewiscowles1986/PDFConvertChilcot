<p><b>Map 2. Ethnic distribution</b></p>
<p>This map was produced from information used in the compilation of Iraq: Map Book, Defence Intelligence Staff, 17 March 2006.</p>
<p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
<p>•   There is little reliable demographic data for Iraq.  </p>
<p>In addition, the most recent census in 1997 was  </p>
<p>based on ethnicity only and did not record  </p>
<p>confessional differences.</p>
<p>•   Arab Shia estimated to be 60% of population.</p>
<p>•   </p>
<p>Many, especially in cosmopolitan areas such as  </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra are intermarried with  </p>
<p>Sunni Arab.</p>
<p>•   </p>
<p>Unknown number of Kurdish Shia.</p>
<p>•   </p>
<p>Sunnis present in all Southern Provinces,  </p>
<p>mainly in urban areas.</p>

<p><b>Map 3. Iraq: Multi-National Division boundaries, June 2003 </b></p>
<p><b>to May 2004</b></p>
<p>After the declared end of major combat operations, Iraq was divided into six divisional areas:</p>
<p>Multi-National Division (North) (MND(N)), Multi-National Division (North-Central) (MND(NC)), Multi-National Division (Baghdad) (MND(B)), </p>
<p>Multi-National Force (West) (MNF(W)), Multi-National Division (Center-South) (MND(CS)) and Multi-National Division (South-East) (MND(SE)).</p>
<p>In late 2004 MND(N) was divided into MND(NE) and MNF(NW).</p>
<p>In late 2005 MNF(NW) and MND(NC) were merged to create a new MND(N).</p>
<p>In early 2007 a new Multi-National Division (Center) was established relieving MND(B) of responsibility for security south of Baghdad.</p>
<p>In late 2008 MND(NE) was dissolved and became part of MND(N).</p>
<p>In early 2009 MND(CS) was dissolved and became part of MND(C).</p>
<p>The boundary of MND(SE) remained unchanged from 2003 to 2009 until the withdrawal of UK troops.</p>
