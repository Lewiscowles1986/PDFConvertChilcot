<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Section 10 addresses the UK contribution to humanitarian assistance and </p>
<p>reconstruction in Iraq between 2003 and 2009:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>This Section (10.1) covers the period between March 2003 and the end of the </p>
<p>Occupation of Iraq in June 2004.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 10.2 continues the story from July 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Sections 10.1 and 10.2 consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development and implementation of UK reconstruction policy, strategy  </p>
<p>and plans;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with the US on reconstruction, including with the US-led </p>
<p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and the Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Authority (CPA); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with successive Iraqi governments on reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> Section 10.3 addresses five issues in more detail:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK policy on Iraq’s oil and oil revenues; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s support for UK business in securing reconstruction contracts; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>debt relief; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asylum; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reform of the Government’s approach to post-conflict reconstruction and </p>
<p>stabilisation.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Those issues are addressed separately from the main reconstruction narrative, in </p>
<p>order to provide a clearer account of the development of the UK’s engagement. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> This Section does not consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparing to provide humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, </p>
<p>which is addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the financial and human resources available for post-conflict reconstruction, </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 13 and 15 respectively; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification and Security Sector Reform (SSR), addressed in Sections 11 </p>
<p>and 12 respectively; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>wider UK policy towards Iraq in the post-conflict period, addressed in Section 9. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> During the period covered by the Inquiry, the Government used a number of different </p>
<p>terms to describe post-conflict activity in Iraq, including “reconstruction”. It did not </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>generally define those terms. The Inquiry uses the term “reconstruction” in line with the </p>
<p>Government’s common usage:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to include work to repair and build infrastructure, deliver essential services and </p>
<p>create jobs; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to include work to build the capacity of Iraqi institutions and reform Iraq’s </p>
<p>economic, legislative and governance structures; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to exclude SSR. </p>
<p><b>UK post-conflict objectives and planning assumption</b></p>
<p><b>7. </b> Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, issued a Written Ministerial Statement setting </p>
<p>out the UK’s strategic objectives for Iraq on 7 January 2003.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> The objectives included </p>
<p>a definition of the UK’s desired end state for a post-Saddam Iraq: </p>
<p>“We would like Iraq to become a stable, united and law abiding state, within  </p>
<p>its present borders, co-operating with the international community, no longer  </p>
<p>posing a threat to its neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its </p>
<p>international obligations and providing effective and representative government to  </p>
<p>its own people.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The development of the UK’s objectives for post-conflict Iraq is addressed in detail </p>
<p>in Sections 6.4 and 6.5. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The ‘Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ issued by Mr Blair, President Bush and </p>
<p>Mr José María Aznar, the Prime Minister of Spain, at the Azores Summit on 16 March, </p>
<p>included a number of specific commitments on post-conflict reconstruction.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> The three </p>
<p>leaders declared:</p>
<p>“We will work to prevent and repair damage by Saddam Hussein’s regime to  </p>
<p>the natural resources of Iraq and pledge to protect them as a national asset of  </p>
<p>and for the Iraqi people. All Iraqis should share the wealth generated by their </p>
<p>national economy … </p>
<p>“In achieving this vision, we plan to work in close partnership with international </p>
<p>institutions, including the United Nations … If conflict occurs, we plan to seek the </p>
<p>adoption, on an urgent basis, of new United Nations Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>that would affirm Iraq’s territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian </p>
<p>relief, and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq. We will also </p>
<p>propose that the Secretary-General be given authority, on an interim basis, to ensure </p>
<p>that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people continue to be met through the </p>
<p>Oil-for-Food program.</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>“Any military presence, should it be necessary, will be temporary and intended to </p>
<p>promote security and elimination of weapons of mass destruction; the delivery of </p>
<p>humanitarian aid; and the conditions for the reconstruction of Iraq. Our commitment </p>
<p>to support the people of Iraq will be for the long term.”</p>
<p><b>10. </b> On 25 March, Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of the Cabinet Office Overseas </p>
<p>and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), sent a draft paper to senior officials in the Foreign </p>
<p>and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and the Department </p>
<p>for International Development (DFID) setting out “British Post-Conflict Objectives”.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>11. </b> The draft included Mr Straw’s formulation of 7 January, adding:</p>
<p>“Our objective is to create conditions for a future Iraqi government which will act to </p>
<p>make this aspiration a reality. We will work with the Iraqi people, the UN and other </p>
<p>international organisations, and the wider international community to this end.”</p>
<p><b>12. </b> The draft stated: </p>
<p>“British forces will continue to contribute, for no longer than is necessary at a </p>
<p>sustainable level, to the US-led Coalition military presence in the interests of </p>
<p>promoting a secure environment in Iraq …</p>
<p>“We have made plans with our international partners to assist the Iraqi people </p>
<p>in the process of transition. With others, we will assist in the return to full Iraqi </p>
<p>sovereignty …</p>
<p>“With others, we will help revive the Iraqi economy and assist reform by: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working with the UN to manage Iraq’s oil revenues in order to achieve </p>
<p>the maximum benefit for the Iraqi people in an accountable and </p>
<p>transparent manner;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting an international programme for the reconstruction and repair  </p>
<p>of Iraq’s infrastructure …; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>fostering economic reform …; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreeing a comprehensive financial framework of transitional support </p>
<p>for Iraq …; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping reform Iraq’s public administration …; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the observance of human rights, and legal and judicial reform …; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping Iraq generate reformed and accountable security forces acting in </p>
<p>accordance with international human rights standards.”</p>
<p><b>13. </b> There is no indication that the objectives were ever adopted formally. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The transition from conflict (Phase III) to post-conflict (Phase IV) military operations </p>
<p>in Iraq started as soon as Coalition troops began to occupy Iraqi territory. </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Section 6.5 concludes that, when that transition began: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government had not taken firm decisions on the nature or duration of the </p>
<p>UK’s military commitment in post-conflict Iraq or on the extent of the UK Area </p>
<p>of Responsibility (AOR).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been no systematic analysis of the UK’s military or civilian capacity </p>
<p>to fulfil its likely obligations in the South in a range of circumstances, including: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>in the prolonged absence of an authorising Security Council resolution;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>in the absence of additional Coalition partners; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>in a hostile security environment with low levels of Iraqi consent; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>over different timescales, in particular the medium and long term. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Ministers, officials and the military continued to assume that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there would be early agreement on a post-conflict resolution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>levels of consent would rise steadily across most of Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>despite the scale of the undertaking, the international community would </p>
<p>succeed in realising the Azores vision for Iraq’s social, political and economic </p>
<p>transformation of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> Above all, despite UK concerns that the US had not prepared a satisfactory plan </p>
<p>for post-conflict Iraq and that ORHA, the body responsible for immediate post-conflict </p>
<p>administration and reconstruction, was not up to the task, it was assumed that the US </p>
<p>could act as guarantor of the UK’s objectives in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Definition and use of Area of Operations (AO) and Area of </b></p>
<p><b>Responsibility (AOR)</b></p>
<p>Area of Operations (AO) refers to the UK military’s area of combat operations during the </p>
<p>invasion of Iraq (Phase III of operations). It is the term applied during conflict and, in terms </p>
<p>of time, space and force, is the area in which lethal force can be applied for a designated </p>
<p>period of time.</p>
<p>Area of Responsibility (AOR) is usually applied in peace support operations. In Iraq, it </p>
<p>refers to the area of southern Iraq for which the UK military was responsible during the </p>
<p>post-conflict Occupation of Iraq (Phase IV of operations). </p>
<p>The two terms were not used consistently within government and were sometimes applied </p>
<p>interchangeably in the same document. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>Humanitarian assistance</b></p>
<p><b>18. </b> Section 6.5 addresses the UK’s pre-invasion preparations, led by DFID and the </p>
<p>military, for the provision of humanitarian assistance during and in the immediate </p>
<p>aftermath of conflict. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Ms Clare Short, the International Development Secretary, described DFID’s </p>
<p>humanitarian contingency plan in a Written Ministerial Statement to Parliament on  </p>
<p>13 March 2003.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>20. </b> In the Statement, Ms Short stated that DFID would have two roles in the event </p>
<p>of conflict:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to help advise UK Armed Forces on their obligations under the Hague and </p>
<p>Geneva Conventions; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to use the funds, expertise and influence available to it to support delivery </p>
<p>of humanitarian assistance by the international community.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Ms Short advised that DFID was deploying staff to key locations in the region, had </p>
<p>brought DFID’s stockpile of non-food items, vehicles and equipment “to immediate </p>
<p>readiness”, was procuring additional supplies, and was positioning some of its stocks </p>
<p>in Kuwait and elsewhere in the region. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> On 17 March, at Ms Short’s request, DFID’s Conflict and Humanitarian Affairs </p>
<p>Department (CHAD) prepared a paper on shortcomings in humanitarian preparations </p>
<p>and steps needed to address them.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Officials identified seven problems:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“UN funding needs insufficiently met. Preparedness incomplete …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Red Cross Movement preparing but requires substantial funding support …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>NGOs [Non-Governmental Organisations] beginning to establish presence but </p>
<p>not fully prepared …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US preparedness for response lacks local experience and based on optimistic </p>
<p>assumptions …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How to maintain the Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How to support humanitarian agencies [to] gain early access to Iraq …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How Coalition Forces can provide effective humanitarian response …”</p>

<p>an effective humanitarian response and what would it take to address that?’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The proposed solution for the first three problems was to provide “immediate </p>
<p>additional funds to DFID”. The proposed solution for the fourth was continued liaison </p>
<p>between DFID, the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and ORHA.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Ms Short sent the paper to Mr Blair with the comment: “This summarises what </p>
<p>needs to be done to improve humanitarian preparedness. Perhaps we could really focus </p>
<p>on this next week.” </p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>26. </b> A No.10 official advised Mr Blair that the main problems identified by DFID were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>underfunding of humanitarian agencies;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agencies not ready to respond effectively and lacking experience outside </p>
<p>northern Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for Coalition Forces to provide humanitarian assistance until there was </p>
<p>a permissive security environment; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the risk that the OFF programme might break down.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>27. </b> DFID’s proposed solutions included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increased funding for DFID and the MOD;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>rapidly securing a permissive security environment; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a resolution transferring management of the OFF programme to the UN </p>
<p>Secretary-General.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The official advised that DFID’s analysis was “probably about right”. The MOD had </p>
<p>been pressing DFID to help for some weeks, so it was useful that DFID now recognised </p>
<p>the need to help. DFID was seconding two people to work with the US and the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office was working to broker a deal on additional funding with the Treasury. The funding </p>
<p>made available to the MOD to provide humanitarian assistance in the UK’s AOR is </p>
<p>described in Section 13.1. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> The military role in providing humanitarian assistance was summarised in a joint </p>
<p>minute from Mr Straw and Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, to Mr Blair on </p>
<p>19 March.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> The letter is described in more detail in Section 6.5. Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Mr Hoon advised:</p>
<p>“The military task will be to facilitate a secure environment … to enable immediate </p>
<p>humanitarian relief to be conducted. To help UK forces win hearts and minds, HMT </p>
<p>[the Treasury] have allocated them £30m for humanitarian purposes in the first </p>
<p>month as well as £10m for quick win projects. (Clare [Short] has allocated £20m for </p>

<p>reserve for humanitarian operations. But this is a drop in the ocean; in the worse </p>
<p>case, if the Oil-for-Food programme ground to a halt, Iraq could need as much as </p>
<p>a billion dollars a month for humanitarian aid).”</p>
<p><b>Extending the Oil-for-Food programme</b></p>
<p>Before the 2003 invasion, the UN Oil-for-Food (OFF) programme was the principal </p>
<p>mechanism for Iraqi procurement of humanitarian goods. </p>
<p>The OFF programme was established by resolution 986 in April 1995. Implementation </p>
<p>began in May 1996 after the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the </p>
<p>UN and the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The programme allowed for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the export of Iraqi oil;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the deposit of oil revenues into a UN-controlled account; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the use of those revenues to procure food, medicine and other goods approved by </p>
<p>the UN. </p>
<p>Section 6.5 describes how, in January 2003, the UK began discussions with the US on </p>
<p>adapting the OFF programme to the circumstances of post-conflict Iraq. </p>
<p>The UK approach was set out in background papers for the Azores Summit, sent to </p>
<p>No.10 by the FCO on 15 March:</p>
<p>“If the Iraqi regime falls, new arrangements will need to be put in place to enable the </p>
<p>OFF [programme] to keep functioning. Our current plan is to table a resolution soon </p>
<p>after conflict starts … We are seeking to amend some of the procedures to speed up </p>
<p>the process for humanitarian goods …” </p>
<p>10</p>
<p>Resolution 1472, adopted unanimously on 28 March, transferred authority for </p>
<p>administering the OFF programme, including authority to purchase medical supplies and </p>
<p>Iraqi goods and services, to the UN Secretary-General for a period of 45 days, with the </p>
<p>possibility of further renewal by the Security Council.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Military operations against Iraq began on the night of 19/20 March. Military </p>
<p>operations during the invasion are described in Section 8.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Ms Short visited New York and Washington on 19 and 20 March for talks with the </p>
<p>UN, US, World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>32. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that Ms Short had pressed the US </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>33. </b> Ms Short wrote to Mr Paul Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, on  </p>
<p>21 March to request £120m from the Reserve for humanitarian assistance in Iraq.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>That amount would cover an initial contribution to the anticipated UN appeal, support </p>
<p>the Red Cross and NGOs, and fund DFID’s bilateral contribution. Ms Short stated </p>
<p>that her bid did not include any funds for reconstruction; those costs would need to </p>
<p>be considered in the “longer term”. </p>

<p> Ms Short said </p>
<p>that Iraq had been in a frail humanitarian state before the conflict. The big risks now </p>
<p>were inadequate water supplies and failed sanitation systems. The military would have </p>
<p>responsibility for providing humanitarian assistance once the shooting stopped.</p>

<p>was in poor but working condition.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>62. </b> Ms Short informed Parliament on 10 April that food supplies were “not currently </p>
<p>a major problem” in most of Iraq and there were not the large numbers of internally </p>
<p>displaced people that had been feared.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>63. </b> In the past few days, there had been reports of an increasingly serious humanitarian </p>
<p>situation in Baghdad; the ICRC had reported “violent looting” and warned of a </p>
<p>breakdown in law and order there. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> Ms Short continued that with 16m Iraqi citizens dependent on the OFF programme </p>
<p>and most families at least partially dependent on it, it was “critical” to get the OFF </p>
<p>programme and its distribution network working again as quickly as possible.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Ms Short told the 11 April Ad Hoc Meeting that the ICRC and UN agencies were </p>
<p>concerned about lawlessness in Baghdad and elsewhere.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> Hospitals in particular </p>
<p>needed to be secured. The systems in place for the distribution of food and the </p>
<p>restoration of the water supply were disabled by the lack of security.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Blair concluded the meeting by saying that the security situation in the cities had </p>
<p>to be stabilised, particularly for hospitals. Although a violent release of anger in response </p>
<p>to the fall of the regime was inevitable, the humanitarian situation had to be improved. </p>
<p>The three basics were food, water and healthcare; DFID should provide advice on both </p>
<p>the current situation and the strategy for the future. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> DFID sent a paper to No.10 later on 11 April, advising that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi health system was functioning, but was under severe strain in </p>
<p>Baghdad and other towns that had suffered heavy casualties. There were </p>
<p>localised shortages of medical supplies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Water, sanitation and power systems were fragile. UK forces, the ICRC and the </p>
<p>United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) were working together to reinstate </p>
<p>services in the South; services in Baghdad were under severe strain. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Food supply remained a concern: stocks distributed before the conflict under </p>
<p>the OFF programme were expected to last until the end of April. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Population movements had so far been limited and managed adequately by </p>
<p>the local authorities. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Key concerns were the breakdown in law and order and the future of </p>
<p>the OFF programme beyond 12 May, when the authority provided under </p>
<p>resolution 1472 expired. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the South, the UK military, drawing on the £30m allocated to them to provide </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance, had been distributing food, water and medical </p>
<p>supplies. Looting and disorder in Basra had been halted, and work was under </p>
<p>way to restore key elements of local public administration. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID maintained daily contact with the ICRC and UN agencies, but almost all </p>
<p>other interventions, including deployment of DFID humanitarian advisers into </p>
<p>Iraq, were awaiting an improvement in security. The ICRC was the only agency </p>
<p>to have been in Iraq throughout the conflict: UN agencies and NGOs were </p>
<p>awaiting their own security assessments before deploying widely. ORHA,  </p>
<p>which had “a very limited capability to deliver humanitarian assistance”, was </p>
<p>similarly constrained.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>68. </b> The Cabinet Office round-up of events on 11 April reported that the ICRC  </p>
<p>was “profoundly alarmed by the chaos currently prevailing in Baghdad and other parts  </p>
<p>of Iraq”.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, passed the Cabinet Office’s </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Publicising humanitarian assistance </b></p>
<p>The Government sought to generate positive publicity for the Coalition’s humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance.</p>
<p>Mr Hoon proposed to Secretary Rumsfeld on 3 April that the Coalition needed to highlight </p>
<p>its humanitarian work for as long as it remained engaged in a propaganda war with the </p>
<p>Iraqi regime.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>Sir David Manning discussed establishing a medical “air bridge” to Baghdad with Mr Hoon </p>
<p>and, separately, with Dr Condoleezza Rice, US National Security Advisor, on 12 April.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David reported that he had suggested to Dr Rice that “we” should bring planes into </p>
<p>Baghdad packed with medical equipment and specialist medical teams.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> The initiative </p>
<p>would have an immediate impact on local hospitals and on Iraqi and international public </p>
<p>opinion. The flights should be undertaken with “much fanfare, and for the cameras”.  </p>
<p>In practice, the initiative might not amount to much more than giving a much higher profile </p>
<p>to what was already happening. </p>
<p>Sir David suggested to Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, that,  </p>
<p>if the idea prospered, “we should try to ensure that the UK is clearly associated with it.  </p>
<p>We might send British equipment and personnel on the flights, and secure maximum </p>
<p>publicity for our contribution.” </p>
<p>Later that day, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, informed  </p>
<p>Sir David that US and Australian aircraft loaded with medical supplies would land in </p>

<p>52</p>
<p> Further flights were expected in the coming days and Coalition </p>
<p>commanders would try to ensure flights were highlighted to the media. </p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen no evidence of further discussion of the air bridge. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> The Cabinet Office reported on 13 April that “despite media reporting of widespread </p>
<p>looting and disruption”, the humanitarian situation continued to show “signs of </p>
<p>stabilisation”.</p>

<p> The ICRC had said that security remained the greatest concern in </p>
<p>Baghdad. Liaison between Coalition Forces and Iraqi technicians and managers on </p>
<p>restoring and maintaining utilities had begun.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> In his conversation with President Bush on 14 April, Mr Blair identified the need to </p>
<p>improve conditions in hospitals as the top humanitarian priority and the main focus of </p>
<p>media interest.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> Baghdad was still not a safe environment for humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>72. </b> By the middle of April, USAID and DFID were beginning to look beyond </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance to longer-term recovery and reconstruction.</p>

<p>resources from humanitarian assistance to reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>75. </b> UKDEL IMF/IBRD also reported that: “US reconstruction plans are comprehensive, </p>

<p>As soon as security permits, UN agencies and NGOs are ready to begin operations </p>

<p><b>91. </b> On 27 March, the British Embassy Washington reported that the US had invited </p>
<p>representatives of around 47 Embassies to attend an inter-agency briefing intended </p>
<p>to generate military and civilian contributions to Phase IV.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> The Embassy commented: </p>
<p>“Given that we have been thinking ourselves about an exercise to generate support </p>
<p>for the UK sector in Phase IV, we will need to make sure that we deconflict this from </p>
<p>the US effort.” </p>
<p><b>92. </b> The Embassy also commented that this was separate from the US initiative </p>
<p>to convene a small core group of countries to manage Iraq’s humanitarian and </p>
<p>reconstruction needs. The UK, Spain, Australia, Japan and possibly a Gulf State  </p>
<p>would be approached to participate in the group.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, advised Mr Lee on  </p>
<p>28 March that Mr Hoon agreed that “given the likely scale of the Phase IV task, there </p>
<p>are good practical as well as political reasons to engage early with potential partners” </p>
<p>and that Mr Hoon had, after discussion with Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under </p>
<p>Secretary (PUS), written to the Defence Ministers of the “most willing” countries.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>94. </b> On the same day, Mr Hoon informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq that he had written </p>
<p>to selected Defence Ministers asking them to consider a military contribution to the </p>
<p>post-conflict phase.</p>
<p>69 </p>
<p><b>95. </b> On 1 April, the Cabinet Office reported that, during the core group’s first conference </p>
<p>call, the UK, Spain, Australia and Japan had suggested that “reconstruction must go </p>
<p>through the UN, with an early new UNSCR [resolution] and the IFIs engaged”.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>96. </b> On 10 April, the FCO issued instructions to overseas posts to seek military </p>
<p>contributions from host governments to support Phase IV in the UK sector of Iraq.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The FCO stated that the UK hoped to be able to reduce its military deployment by </p>
<p>two-thirds during Phase IV, but advised posts to: </p>
<p>“… base your approaches on the need for widespread international support for </p>
<p>consolidating security and stability and getting Iraq back on its feet, which should be </p>
<p>a more powerful argument for potential contributors than offsetting the effects of a </p>
<p>UK drawdown.</p>
<p>“We intend to continue to provide a discrete self-supporting military capability in </p>

<p> Mr Gooderham had declined a US request to “abort” the lobbying telegram. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> Later that day, Mr Gooderham reported that while there was still “consternation” </p>

<p>77</p>
<p> Although reconstruction had not been explicitly </p>
<p>mentioned, the EU had undertaken to contribute to a “post-Saddam Iraq”, and had </p>
<p>directed the Commission and Council Secretariat to start planning for that. The UK </p>
<p>needed to build on this in order to “start to heal EU divisions”, and make progress on </p>
<p>post-conflict resolutions. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> On 26 March, during the early stages of discussion in between the UK and US </p>
<p>delegations in New York on the text of what was to become resolution 1483 (see </p>
<p>Section 9.1), Sir Paul Lever, British Ambassador to Germany, raised concerns with </p>
<p>Mr Peter Ricketts, FCO Political Director, about the UK’s failure to engage EU allies </p>
<p>from the outset.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> Sir Paul recalled that Mr Blair had stated in the House of Commons </p>
<p>on 18 March, that, with the wisdom of hindsight, it would have been best if Europe had </p>
<p>adopted a common position on Iraq, including with respect to the use of force provided </p>
<p>the US acted through the UN and engaged seriously on Israel/Palestine. Sir Paul </p>
<p>commented that Mr Blair’s advice had not been followed on reconstruction:</p>
<p>“… I hope that you [Mr Ricketts] and others will, before we get inextricably locked in </p>
<p>to a common UK/US bilateral position on post-conflict Iraq, have the opportunity to </p>
<p>consider whether, after our experience over the last six months, this is really where </p>
<p>we want to be.”</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Ricketts relayed those views, together with those of Sir John Holmes </p>
<p>(British Ambassador to France) and Sir Roderic Lyne (British Ambassador to the </p>
<p>Russian Federation), to Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Ricketts reported that a meeting of FCO officials earlier that day had agreed </p>
<p>that it made sense to engage with European countries at the formative stage of the </p>
<p>resolution, “both because we needed their support to get it through the Security </p>
<p>Council, and because it was potentially an important part of re-establishing a good </p>
<p>working relationship”. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> On 27 March, Sir John Holmes added:</p>
<p>“… the bottom line is that we will need French (and German) support if a UN </p>
<p>resolution is to pass. We are more likely to get it if we share our thinking with </p>
<p>them at an early stage. They see the need, as we do, to save the Americans (or </p>
<p>at least the Pentagon) from too much of a military administration which could go </p>
<p>disastrously wrong …”</p>

<p>81</p>
<p> The prospects of that had been </p>
<p>“mildly enhanced” by useful co-operation during negotiations on the resolution extending </p>
<p>the OFF programme. Sir Jeremy added: </p>
<p>“The difficult calculation, of course, is how to take forward any thought of working </p>
<p>closely with the Europeans when we have to be joined at the hip to the Americans </p>
<p>as well. </p>

<p> Mr Blair </p>

<p>for Phase IV should help.</p>

<p>the world to know that a resolution for a UN mandate was coming.” </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Officials reported a sense among departments that a resolution on reconstruction </p>

<p>request that the Attorney General’s advice be committed to paper. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> Ms Short reported that “the Prime Minister had given her responsibility for </p>
<p>reconstruction in Iraq”. That role should be underpinned by a Cabinet Office Committee </p>
<p>chaired by Mr Chakrabarti. Ms Short added: “This area was our lead in Whitehall and </p>

<p>intact. The sooner the oil could flow again, the sooner the profits could be used for the </p>

<p>international activities needed to help Iraq recover from conflict, sanctions and years </p>
<p>of misrule.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> Mr Fernie advised that the paper had been revised to take account of Ms Short’s </p>
<p>comments on “getting the multilateral system working to support Iraqi institutions, the </p>
<p>importance of sustainable debt and reparations strategy, and focusing on using and </p>
<p>developing Iraqi talent rather than bringing in too many international consultants”. </p>

<p>what the UK would do if there were no resolution authorising reconstruction; </p>
<p>Mr Fernie advised that, with the Attorney General’s advice now in writing, </p>

<p>next day, when: </p>
<p>“We will discuss the process for the more comprehensive paper … it will be useful </p>
<p>to show to No.10 and the Cabinet Office that DFID is not only the natural lead on </p>

<p>securing international consensus behind that approach. DFID’s view was that the UK </p>
<p>needed to “start working now on a broader strategy which binds together the many bits </p>
<p>of work going on across Whitehall”.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> The paper stated that it was based on the assumption that “an adequate </p>
<p>international mandate, agreed by the UN Security Council, will exist for the UK to play a </p>
<p>full role in reforming and restructuring Iraq and its administration”.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> It also stated that it </p>
<p>was focused on DFID’s contribution to reconstruction, but had set that within a “broader </p>
<p>context, which should be the subject of a further, more overarching UK Government </p>
<p>strategy paper”. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> While reconstruction planning needed to be informed by a long-term perspective of </p>
<p>a country’s needs, decisions were likely to be taken soon on new governance structures </p>
<p>and policies for Iraq, and the international community (in particular the IFIs, UN and US) </p>
<p>were already considering what kind of reconstruction support should be provided. ORHA </p>
<p>was likely to take decisions within a matter of days which would set the context for future </p>
<p>reconstruction planning. </p>
<p><b>129. </b> The paper adopted the (broad) objectives defined in the version of the UK’s ‘Vision </p>
<p>for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ which had been produced for the 16 March Azores Summit. </p>
<p><b>130. </b> DFID’s “core focus” in assisting Iraq’s reconstruction would be:</p>
<p>“… the elimination of poverty, and in particular ensuring the Iraqi Government was </p>
<p>able to address its people’s poor health indicators and other social problems. </p>
<p>After an initial period of continuing dependence on humanitarian assistance, Iraq’s </p>
<p>status as a middle-income country will make it more appropriate for DFID to support </p>

<p>technical assistance for the economic and institutional reforms which will underpin </p>
<p>the reconstruction process, and help the Iraqi Government to stimulate the private </p>
<p>sector growth, foreign investment and international lending which will enable them to </p>
<p>address poverty.”</p>
<p><b>131. </b> In pursuing those objectives, DFID would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work though multilateral channels. DFID’s “overriding aim” should be to ensure </p>
<p>that Iraq received comprehensive and prompt support from international </p>
<p>institutions and the wider international community. DFID would “wherever </p>
<p>possible … seek to channel the bulk of our financial contributions through </p>
<p>multilateral arrangements … and complement this with targeted technical </p>
<p>assistance in areas where DFID has expertise”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Tackle dependence on humanitarian assistance. Emergency relief and </p>
<p>rehabilitation should blend with immediate reconstruction priorities. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Plan for a short-term engagement: “given its potential wealth, we should </p>
<p>aimfor Iraq to be self-sufficient as quickly as possible, perhaps within three </p>
<p>years, though some continuing technical assistance may prove appropriate </p>
<p>beyond that”. </p>
<p><b>132. </b> The paper stated that experience in Afghanistan had shown that the international </p>
<p>community was slow to create tangible benefits on the ground which might demonstrate </p>
<p>the “dividends of peace” to communities during “politically and culturally unstable </p>
<p>post-conflict times”. DFID had “a justified reputation for relatively speedy response”, </p>
<p>and would consider whether its existing humanitarian programme in Iraq and the </p>
<p>additional emergency work it might fund after the conflict might provide a useful base to </p>
<p>support wider reform in the water/sanitation and health sectors, to ensure that tangible </p>
<p>benefits were provided to the Iraqi people relatively quickly. </p>
<p><b>133. </b> The UK would find itself in a “critically responsible role” in Iraq, having been </p>
<p>involved from the start in the military campaign. As the main ally of the US, the UK </p>
<p>would be in a unique position to influence its engagement.</p>
<p><b>134. </b> The paper concluded:</p>
<p>“Iraq is different to many developing countries which face shortages of well-educated </p>
<p>and technically competent people. Using Iraq’s existing talent pool (including, with </p>
<p>some political caution, returning exiles) as far as possible, and ensuring its relatively </p>
<p>young population is educated to replace that pool, will be an essential investment </p>
<p>and reduce political tension.”</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Eight days after the start of the invasion, officials recommended the creation of a </p>
<p>Cabinet Committee to oversee the UK approach to reconstruction.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>26</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Sir Michael Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), discussed the Whitehall </p>
<p>machinery for overseeing reconstruction with Sir Andrew Turnbull on 27 March.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>137. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull suggested “a Cabinet Committee chaired by the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary which would settle all the fundamental key questions about the reconstruction </p>
<p>of Iraq (e.g. what sort of political system)”, with sub-committees looking at specific </p>
<p>issues. He would ask Mr Bowen to come up with a proposal.</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Sir Michael said that it was important that the Foreign Secretary was “clearly in the </p>
<p>lead”, that DFID reconstruction activity was “restrained until the ‘big picture’ decisions” </p>
<p>had been taken, and that the IPU was included in the architecture.</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Sir Michael Jay wrote to Mr Straw later that day, proposing improvements to </p>
<p>Whitehall co-ordination on reconstruction.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> Sir Michael repeated his concern, prompted </p>
<p>by a conversation with Mr Chakrabarti, that DFID was “still hankering after the leadership </p>
<p>of the Iraq reconstruction agenda”. Sir Michael had discussed this concern with Sir </p>
<p>Andrew Turnbull, who had agreed that “it was right that the FCO should take the overall </p>
<p>Whitehall lead on reconstruction”. The “ideal structure” would be:</p>
<p>“–  a Cabinet Committee chaired by you [Mr Straw] to oversee the overall </p>
<p>reconstruction effort in Iraq;</p>
<p>–  a senior officials’ committee chaired by Desmond Bowen or David Manning, </p>
<p>which would feed into the Ministerial Group; and oversee the work of a series of </p>
<p>sub-groups, each dealing with specific aspects of the reconstruction agenda …”</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Sir Michael concluded: </p>
<p>“It would obviously be helpful if you could secure the Prime Minister’s endorsement </p>
<p>for our approach in advance. We cannot guarantee that Clare Short will accept it </p>
<p>without argument.”</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Later on 27 March, Mr Bowen sent Sir Andrew Turnbull a draft minute addressed </p>
<p>to Mr Blair, recommending the creation of an “Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>Reconstruction” chaired by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> Mr Bowen advised that he had opted for an ad </p>
<p>hoc group because it was “inherently more flexible and less ponderous than a formal </p>
<p>sub-group of DOP [the Ministerial Committee on Defence and Overseas Policy]”. </p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head (Foreign Affairs) OD Sec, sent Mr Bowen some </p>
<p>first thoughts on the “reconstruction agenda” for the new Ministerial Group on 28 March: </p>

<p>others, Sir David Manning’s agreement on a slightly revised version of the draft minute </p>
<p>produced by Mr Bowen on 27 March.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> Sir Andrew advised that the revised draft had </p>
<p>already been agreed with Sir Michael Jay and Mr Chakrabarti.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> The only change to Mr Bowen’s draft was the substitution of the word </p>
<p>“rehabilitation” for “reconstruction” in the name of the group. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull’s draft stated that as the UK moved towards the post-conflict </p>
<p>phase, it needed “a coherent policy on an enormous range of issues, including the </p>
<p>role of the UN, Iraqi political process, rehabilitation and reform, economic and financial </p>
<p>issues (including debt and reparations), security sector reform and reducing our own </p>
<p>military role”.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> Sir Andrew Turnbull therefore proposed:</p>
<p>“… a new Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation reporting to you [Mr Blair]. </p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary should chair … Its terms of reference would be: ‘to formulate </p>
<p>policy for the rehabilitation, reform and development of Iraq’.”</p>
<p><b>147. </b> The new Ministerial Group would be supported by an officials group, led by the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office and including the Head of the IPU. </p>

<p>28</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Chakrabarti wrote to Sir Andrew Turnbull on 1 April, confirming that the new </p>
<p>groups proposed in Sir Andrew’s draft minute to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… seem the best way to take forward the detailed implications of any SCR’s </p>
<p>content, and what can be done before its passing … The key will be to agree </p>
<p>very quickly on the work programme and to task those with the knowledge and </p>
<p>experience in the subject areas to take the lead while consulting others with an </p>
<p>interest in ensuring all the workstreams fit together into a coherent – and affordable – </p>
<p>strategy. We must draw on the lessons learnt from other post-conflict situations such </p>
<p>as Afghanistan, Kosovo, East Timor, Sierra Leone and Bosnia.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Chakrabarti attached a short note setting out some thoughts on how such a </p>
<p>strategy might be developed and structured. He continued: </p>
<p>“The Cabinet Office will pull all this together, but DFID is already working on issues </p>
<p>in our area of expertise under several of the workstreams listed. We are keen to </p>
<p>work more closely with HMT [the Treasury], MOD and FCO on areas such as debt </p>
<p>and reparations rescheduling, the use of oil revenues, security sector reform, and </p>
<p>the diplomatic and financial strategy for building consensus around what needs to </p>
<p>be done. Nicola Brewer will take the lead for DFID in the Cabinet Committee senior </p>
<p>officials’ group. I hope there will be increased cross-membership of the various </p>
<p>workstreams, and that we will use the interdepartmental machinery at our disposal </p>

<p>“In looking at our areas of expertise, we are consulting the [World] Bank and </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>154. </b> On 17 March, Mr Huw Llewellyn, an FCO Legal Counsellor, advised the IPU on </p>
<p>the compatibility of various post-conflict activities with the rules of military occupation.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>155. </b> Mr Llewellyn explained that Security Council authorisation was not required for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. The position was more complicated for “rehabilitation” and </p>
<p>“reconstruction”:</p>
<p>“Rehabilitation</p>
<p>“As I understand it, this means essential repair work, (for example to schools, </p>
<p>hospitals, government buildings, roads). It is closely connected with basic </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance. </p>
<p>“… Article 55 of the Hague Regulations requires the Occupying Power to ‘safeguard’ </p>
<p>the capital of public buildings etc. Repair work would be consistent with that </p>
<p>obligation …</p>
<p>“Reconstruction</p>
<p>“You list under this heading matters such as reform of the judiciary, security sector </p>
<p>and police reform, demobilisation, reform of government and its institutions, the </p>
<p>education system, and the banking system … it might also include the building of </p>
<p>new roads and other structures to assist the regeneration of Iraq.</p>
<p>“Construction of entirely new roads and buildings may in some circumstances </p>
<p>be permissible – where this is necessary for the relief effort or, for example for </p>
<p>maintaining security or public order. As you know, the scope for action on the other </p>
<p>issues … is limited. Any action going beyond these limits would require Security </p>
<p>Council authorisation.”</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Llewellyn offered further observations on 18 March, in which he emphasised </p>
<p>that “sweeping” institutional and personnel changes would not be permitted.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>157. </b> On 26 March, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, sent Mr Blair advice </p>
<p>requested at the Ad Hoc Meeting the previous day.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> It covered:</p>
<p>“… the need for UN Security Council authorisation for the Coalition or the </p>

<p><b>158. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s view was that:</p>
<p>“… a further Security Council resolution is needed to authorise imposing reform </p>
<p>and restructuring of Iraq and its Government. In the absence of a further resolution, </p>
<p>the UK (and US) would be bound by the provisions of international law governing </p>
<p>belligerent Occupation … the general principle is that an Occupying Power does not </p>
<p>become the government of the occupied territory. Rather, it exercises temporary de </p>
<p>facto control …” </p>
<p><b>159. </b> The principles of international law as they applied to the UK and US as Occupying </p>
<p>Powers in Iraq before and after the adoption of resolution 1483 on 22 May 2003 are </p>
<p>summarised in the Box ‘The legal framework for Occupation’ later in this Section.</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Those principles are addressed in more detail in Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Section 9.1 also addresses UK efforts to agree with the US a Memorandum of </p>

<p><b>162. </b> In advance of the meeting between Mr Blair and President Bush at Camp David on </p>
<p>26 and 27 March, Mr Straw’s Private Office sent Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private </p>

<p>the resolution defining the roles of the UN and the Coalition in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>163. </b> The negotiating brief, prepared by the IPU, described what was known  </p>
<p>about what would happen during the “first few weeks” after the combat phase of the </p>
<p>military campaign: </p>
<p>“Immediately after the conflict, the Coalition will be in control of Iraq. </p>
<p>“As soon as it is safe to do so, [Lieutenant General (retired)] Jay Garner [the Head </p>
<p>of ORHA] and his Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) </p>
<p>will arrive behind the military and become a transitional administration. Their aim will </p>
<p>be to work with the existing Iraqi public administration, so far as possible. Garner </p>
<p>will then take forward the reconstruction process. His people will be inserted into the </p>
<p>top of the Iraqi ministries, with senior US officials being assigned to each ministry as </p>
<p>‘shadow ministers’ … </p>
<p>“ORHA is understaffed and begun preparing for its task only a few weeks ago.  </p>
<p>There are now some ten or so UK secondees embedded in it. Garner would like </p>
<p>to be out of Iraq within 90-120 days. Whether ORHA will be able to get any reform </p>
<p>programme started in that time is moot. This period is likely to be dominated by </p>
<p>humanitarian and security concerns.”</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>164. </b> ORHA and the Coalition might enjoy a “brief honeymoon”, but not if the Coalition </p>
<p>seemed set on administering Iraq for more than a brief period. It was therefore </p>
<p>necessary to put in place interim arrangements for post-conflict administration that would </p>
<p>be accepted by the Iraqi people and the Arab and Islamic world.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> A resolution would be required to authorise those interim arrangements, and to </p>
<p>provide a legal basis for “reconstruction and reform”: </p>
<p>“Without a UNSCR, other countries, international organisations, the IFIs, UN </p>
<p>agencies and NGOs will be comparatively limited in what they can do … That would </p>
<p>leave US/UK with no viable exit strategy from Iraq and a huge bill.”</p>
<p><b>166. </b> The IPU negotiating brief stated that the task for Camp David was to build on five </p>
<p>areas where there was already agreement between the UK and US:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Coalition, through ORHA, would be responsible for the administration of Iraq </p>
<p>for the first few weeks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN should not be asked to run Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The objective should be Security Council authorisation or endorsement for an </p>
<p>international presence that would include the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition, not UN troops would provide security on the ground.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As soon as possible, Iraq should govern itself. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> The IPU stated that differences between the UK and US positions remained </p>
<p>significant. The IPU explained that the US approach amounted to:</p>
<p>“… asking the UNSC to endorse Coalition military control over Iraq’s transitional </p>
<p>administration, its representative institutions and its revenues until such time as a </p>
<p>fully-fledged Iraqi government is ready to take over. It would marginalise the role of </p>
<p>a UN Special Co-ordinator. These ideas are a non-starter for the Security Council, </p>
<p>would be denounced by the Iraqis and the wider Arab/Islamic world, and would not </p>
<p>provide the stability needed to develop the new Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>168. </b> The IPU stated that there was “still some distance to go if we are to agree a way </p>
<p>forward to avoid an inchoate start to Phase IV”.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> The IPU set out a number of “propositions” which it hoped Mr Blair and President </p>
<p>Bush could agree. Those propositions and the progress of the negotiations on resolution </p>
<p>1483 are addressed in Section 9.1. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>170. </b> Mr Straw sent Mr Blair an FCO paper on Phase IV issues in advance of Camp </p>
<p>David.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> Mr Straw said that he hoped Mr Blair would counter any tendency by President </p>
<p>Bush to conclude that the UN had failed over Iraq:</p>
<p>“… the US will need to go on working through the UN, both to authorise the post-</p>
<p>conflict work in Iraq so that a wide range of countries can join the peacekeeping and </p>
<p>reconstruction effort, and to provide an exit strategy for the US/UK and because the </p>
<p>UN itself and its agencies have important expertise to offer.”</p>
<p><b>171. </b> The FCO paper on Phase IV issues stated that, in addition to US agreement on a </p>
<p>UN resolution, the UK needed US agreement on a number of other important political, </p>
<p>humanitarian and economic issues, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Baghdad Conference. The US was still thinking of a Coalition conference with </p>
<p>the UN in a supporting role. That was the wrong way round for international </p>
<p>acceptability.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The role of the Interim Iraqi Administration (IIA). An early statement of intent to </p>
<p>hand over power to an IIA while helping the Iraqi people to build a democratic </p>
<p>future “should go down well”. The UN Special Co-ordinator should have veto </p>
<p>power over the IIA’s decisions. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humanitarian issues. UK and US efforts were substantial: “we should play them </p>
<p>up in the media”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economic issues. After several wars and 12 years of sanctions, Iraq’s oil </p>
<p>revenues alone would not meet the “very heavy” cost of reconstruction, </p>
<p>particularly in the short term. “We need to share the burden with other developed </p>
<p>countries … But contacts with them tell us they will make <b>their contribution </b></p>
<p><b>conditional on there being an authorising UNSC resolution for Phase IV.</b>”<b> </b></p>
<p>The World Bank would need to prepare a rigorous needs assessment, but that </p>
<p>too would probably need UN cover.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>172. </b> On the UK’s bilateral effort, the paper stated that Ms Short was considering where </p>
<p>the UK might help with the longer-term contribution to “reform and reconstruction”. </p>
<p>SSR and reform of the public service were two areas where the UK had a comparative </p>
<p>advantage. UK public finances were “tight”. If the UK was to keep armed forces in Iraq, </p>
<p>“the scope for a major effort on reform and reconstruction will be limited”. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush met at Camp David on 26 and 27 March.  </p>

<p>101</p>
<p> The question about what sort of resolution was needed for the administration </p>
<p>and reconstruction of Iraq should be parked. Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“The time to debate this would come when we had secured victory, and were </p>
<p>in a position of strength.”</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Mr Blair raised Phase IV issues with President Bush the next day. They </p>
<p>discussed the need to push for a quick agreement on the resolution to continue the </p>
<p>OFF programme, and for a separate resolution that would free up financial and troop </p>
<p>contributions from other nations, secure World Bank and IMF involvement and put </p>
<p>reconstruction on the right footing.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>176. </b> Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair had identified the main issue as being whether </p>
<p>the UN formed the future Iraqi government or whether the Coalition did so with UN </p>
<p>endorsement, but that he had said “it was not helpful to expose this distinction yet”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> On 31 March, Mr Llewellyn advised Mr Dominick Chilcott, Head of the IPU, that UK </p>
<p>military lawyers based in Kuwait were becoming alarmed at ORHA’s activities.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> ORHA </p>
<p>had issued three orders in relation to the port of Umm Qasr, including the application of </p>
<p>US labour and customs laws, for which there was no clear legal authority. The position </p>
<p>of UK forces, if asked to participate in related activities, was therefore uncertain. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Mr Llewellyn concluded: “If it cannot be sorted out, we may well need a decision </p>
<p>from Ministers about whether UK forces should decline to take part in actions that we </p>
<p>consider unauthorised or unlawful.”</p>
<p><b>179. </b> The IPU sent recommendations on the UK’s future engagement with ORHA to </p>
<p>Mr Straw on 1 April.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>180. </b> The IPU advised that the UK objective of an IIA acting under UN authorisation </p>
<p>was unlikely to be in place sooner than 90 days after the end of hostilities.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> Until then, </p>
<p>mechanisms were needed to deliver humanitarian assistance and, within the relevant </p>
<p>legal constraints, civil administration. Without such mechanisms, those tasks would fall </p>
<p>on the military, which had other priorities and limited resources. </p>
<p><b>181. </b> The IPU listed three options:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working through ORHA and doing what was possible to increase ORHA’s </p>
<p>institutional capacity; UK/US differences over legal issues would be likely to </p>
<p>have an impact on the UK’s ability to achieve that; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>finding other ways to fulfil those tasks, for example through NGOs or </p>
<p>international agencies.</p>
<p><b>182. </b> The IPU noted that ORHA would administer the whole of Iraq as part of an </p>
<p>integrated US-led approach and had large resources at its disposal, and concluded: </p>
<p>“We may wish to support 1 Div’s capacity to carry out specific actions (eg repairing </p>
<p>the water supply) in areas where we are responsible for maintaining security. </p>
<p>But the logic of ORHA – a nation-wide approach to Phase IV – limits the UK’s </p>
<p>responsibilities and exposure. Carving out a separate approach in a UK sector would </p>
<p>make no sense.</p>
<p>“The third option is not incompatible with this or with the second option. Indeed, </p>
<p>DFID may well wish to go down this route as the primary means of delivering </p>
<p>humanitarian and, in due course, reconstruction assistance. We shall need to keep </p>
<p>under review where the balance of our overall effort lies.</p>
<p>“But ORHA remains the Coalition’s transitional civil administration in waiting and </p>
<p>is its primary means for delivering humanitarian assistance. And at least until the </p>
<p>UN agencies and NGOs are present on the ground, only ORHA/Coalition Forces </p>
<p>will be in a position to do this. This paper thus focuses exclusively on ORHA as </p>
<p>the means for adding value and exerting UK influence in the immediate </p>
<p>post-conflict environment.”</p>
<p><b>183. </b> The IPU advised that ORHA, which was then in Kuwait, had approximately </p>
<p>200 staff, expected to rise to over 1,000 by the time it deployed to Iraq. The UK and </p>
<p>Australia had each seconded six officers. Five more UK secondees were “in the pipeline” </p>
<p>and one was working in ORHA’s back office in the Pentagon. The UK secondees </p>
<p>were “fully integrated” and “adding significant value”. At ORHA’s request, the IPU was </p>
<p>considering whether to strengthen UK representation, particularly in the areas of public </p>
<p>relations, civil administration and humanitarian operations.</p>
<p><b>184. </b> The IPU advised that Lt Gen Garner was reported to be expecting ORHA to act </p>
<p>as the transitional administration for 30 to 90 days. The priority for the first 30 days was </p>
<p>likely to be dealing with immediate humanitarian needs, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>restoration of food supplies;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>payment of public sector salaries; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-establishment and rehabilitation of essential public services; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working closely with UN staff to restart the OFF programme.</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Depending on the circumstances, the UK could quite quickly be faced with “a grey </p>
<p>area of possible activities which could move ORHA beyond the UK’s understanding of an </p>
<p>Occupying Power’s rights and obligations”, perhaps including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>initiation of a small business loan programme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>abolition of Iraqi Government restrictions on private business;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>significant changes to the exchange or trade regimes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>significant changes to the structure of the state budget; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SSR.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> In addition, the US Department of Defense (DoD) continued to consider that the </p>
<p>absence of a resolution need not prevent “thorough-going political and economic reform, </p>
<p>including in areas the UK would consider to be clearly outside the UK’s understanding of </p>
<p>an Occupying Power’s rights and responsibilities”. </p>
<p><b>187. </b> The IPU concluded that, while ORHA was “in many ways a sub-optimal </p>
<p>organisation for delivering the UK’s Phase IV objectives”, it was “the only game in town”. </p>
<p>There was “ample scope” to use UK secondees to exert leverage over US Phase IV </p>
<p>planning and implementation. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> The IPU recommended that “the UK should continue to commit resources to </p>
<p>ORHA where we can add real value and exert influence over emerging US perspectives </p>
<p>and plans”. Only by “full, constructive engagement” could the UK “hope to shape the </p>
<p>outcomes in ways that stay within UK red lines”. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> The IPU also recommended that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to make clear to the US the limits within which the UK, including UK </p>
<p>personnel within ORHA, could operate;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seek close consultation on ORHA’s plans, to ensure that they did not cross UK </p>
<p>“red lines”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>subject to those points, confirm Major General Tim Cross, the senior UK </p>
<p>secondee to ORHA, as Deputy to Lt Gen Garner. </p>
<p><b>190. </b> The Inquiry has seen no response to the IPU paper. </p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Straw considered the question of UK support for ORHA at the first meeting of </p>
<p>the AHMGIR on 10 April. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> On 1 April, Mr Straw described the UK’s commitment to reconstruction in a speech </p>
<p>to the Newspaper Society Annual Conference:</p>
<p>“Today our primary focus has to be the military campaign … But we have given – </p>
<p>and we are giving – a huge amount of thought to the post-conflict situation …</p>
<p>“I don’t underestimate the scale of the task. Saddam has led his country to ruin …</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>“Turning things round in a fully comprehensive way will not be the work of months.  </p>
<p>It is likely to take years …</p>
<p>“Today I want to assure all the Iraqi people that our belief in their future prosperity </p>
<p>is as strong as our belief in their liberation. In the short term, our approach to </p>
<p>humanitarian relief and reconstruction will be founded on four key commitments …</p>
<p>“First: there will be emergency relief over the coming days and weeks …  </p>
<p>The Ministry of Defence has been allocated £30m … DFID has earmarked £210m …</p>
<p>“Second: we will ensure that the United Nations oversees the medium and long-term </p>
<p>international aid programme to Iraq … A central role for the UN will also be crucial in </p>
<p>attracting the expertise and funds from the major international financial institutions </p>
<p>and aid donors …</p>
<p>“Third: we will work with the United Nations and others on the long term </p>
<p>redevelopment and rehabilitation of Iraq …</p>
<p>“And fourth: we will ensure that Iraq’s oil wealth will be used for the benefit of  </p>
<p>the Iraqi people, to develop the infrastructure and services the country so </p>
<p>desperately needs.”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Mr Llewellyn confirmed on 2 April that UK forces were now an Occupying Power  </p>
<p>in that part of Iraq in their physical control.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The legal framework for Occupation</b></p>
<p>It was widely understood by both the US and UK that once they had displaced the regime </p>
<p>of Saddam Hussein, Coalition Forces would exercise authority over – and, under </p>
<p>international law – be occupiers in Iraq. </p>
<p>The rules of international law on belligerent occupation relevant to reconstruction are set </p>
<p>out principally in the 1907 Hague Regulations.</p>
<p>In Iraq in April 2003, the UK was considered, at a minimum, the Occupying Power in that </p>
<p>part of South-East Iraq where its forces were physically present and exercised authority </p>
<p>(see Section 9.1). The UK’s role alongside the US in ORHA (and then the Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Authority (CPA)) raised questions about whether the UK was also jointly </p>
<p>responsible for the actions of those organisations throughout Iraq.</p>
<p>Article 43 of the Hague Regulations provides that the Occupying Power “shall take all the </p>
<p>measures in his power to restore, and ensure, as far as possible, public order and safety </p>
<p>while respecting, unless absolutely prevented, the laws in force in the country”. </p>
<p>Sir Michael Wood, the FCO Legal Adviser from 1999 to 2006, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“While some changes to the legislative and administrative structure may be </p>
<p>permissible if they are necessary for public order and safety, more wide-reaching </p>

<p>the imposition of major economic reforms.”</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 (2003), which was adopted on 22 May </p>
<p>2003, changed the legal framework for the Occupation of Iraq.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Resolution 1483 confirmed that the administration of Iraq was the responsibility of “the </p>
<p>Authority” (the Occupying Powers).</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> It also specified the role of the UN, exercised </p>
<p>through a Special Representative to the Secretary-General (SRSG).</p>
<p>In June, the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers advised that the resolution clarified the </p>
<p>legitimate scope of activity of the Occupying Powers and authorised them to undertake </p>
<p>actions for the reform and reconstruction of Iraq going beyond the limitations of Geneva </p>
<p>Convention IV and the Hague Regulations.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> In some cases, such actions had to </p>
<p>be carried out in co-ordination with the SRSG or in consultation with the Iraqi interim </p>
<p>administration. </p>
<p>Particular actions that the resolution appeared to mandate were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promoting economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable development;</p>

<p>promoting human rights; and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>196. </b> As part of the preparation for his meeting with President Bush at Hillsborough </p>
<p>on 7 and 8 April, Mr Blair requested information on six issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the duration of each post-conflict phase;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a summary of the tribes, regions and governorates of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a summary of exile groups and their credibility;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s “vision” of how the UN Special Co-ordinator might work with Coalition </p>
<p>Forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an assessment of “how ORHA and then the IIA will actually run Iraqi ministries”; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an assessment of the state of the Iraqi civil service and bureaucracy.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>197. </b> The FCO sent papers on each of those issues to No.10 on 4 April.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> Three had </p>
<p>been produced by the IPU and three by FCO Research Analysts. </p>
<p><b>198. </b> The IPU paper on the post-conflict phases emphasised the timetable’s </p>
<p>dependence on a range of factors: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the permissiveness of the security environment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the emergence of credible Iraqi leaders; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi attitudes towards the Coalition; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the extent of Phase III damage to infrastructure.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>199. </b> The IPU stated that the Iraqi people were likely to be more co-operative after </p>
<p>a “swift and relatively clean collapse” of Saddam Hussein’s regime. Lt Gen Garner’s </p>
<p>working assumption was that ORHA would fulfil its role for 30 to 90 days. Over time, its </p>
<p>legitimacy in Iraqi eyes would decline and pressure would increase for it to get involved </p>
<p>in reconstruction and reform work that exceeded what was legal for an Occupying Power. </p>
<p>The UK would therefore want “a fairly rapid transition to an Iraqi Interim Authority – while </p>
<p>allowing some time for credible leaders to emerge from within Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>200. </b> In a paper on “How ORHA and then the IIA will actually run the Iraqi ministries”, </p>
<p>the IPU stated that the UK’s vision for Iraq was a transition from a command economy </p>
<p>with a corrupt public administration to a democratic state with a liberal, market economy </p>
<p>and a public sector that served the interests of its people, “something comparable to the </p>
<p>transformations of central European countries after the fall of the Berlin wall”.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>201. </b> The IPU reported that Lt Gen Garner planned to deploy ORHA to Baghdad as </p>
<p>soon as it was safe to do so and to establish, with the Coalition military, a “Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Administration” with control over the civil administration of Iraq. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>39</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The US intended to put a senior US official and a small group of Iraqi exiles </p>
<p>into each ministry, having removed “undesirable elements”. US officials would work </p>
<p>as advisers to Iraqi ministries, which would be “headed by Iraqi secretaries-general”. </p>
<p>In practice, the advisers would oversee the work of the ministries and, in due course, </p>
<p>begin their reform and restructuring. The US understood the importance of calling those </p>
<p>officials “advisers”, rather than “shadow ministers”. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> The IPU reported that there was “a bitter inter-agency dispute in Washington” </p>
<p>over the list of US officials and Iraqi exiles. The UK had been invited to nominate British </p>
<p>advisers, but had made clear the need to be sure of the legal basis for their activities.</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Once the IIA had been established, there would be a phased transfer of </p>
<p>“the direction” of Iraqi ministries. The US intended that the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Administration should retain “considerable control” over the IIA’s handling of ministries. </p>
<p>The UK considered that to be “politically unsellable” and “unlawful”. </p>
<p><b>205. </b> The UK model for the IIA was based on the Supreme National Council for </p>
<p>Cambodia (the model proposed in the FCO paper ‘Models for Administering a Post-</p>
<p>Saddam Iraq’ in October 2002, see Section 6.4), which met regularly and took decisions </p>
<p>that would be implemented provided the UN Special Representative did not object.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> The IPU concluded:</p>
<p>“All the evidence suggests that the IIA will assert its independence vigorously from </p>
<p>the outset. A stately transfer of ministries’ powers from the Coalition to it may not be </p>
<p>politically possible. But a light supervisory role for a UN Special Co-ordinator may </p>
<p>be acceptable as the price the Iraqis have to pay for the international community’s </p>
<p>support to nation building. This might finally convince the US too.”</p>
<p><b>207. </b> The IPU paper on the UN Special Co-ordinator envisaged the appointee  </p>
<p>co-ordinating humanitarian and reconstruction assistance, exercising “a light degree  </p>
<p>of supervision” over the IIA, and helping with preparations for the Central Iraq </p>
<p>Conference (a consultative conference that took place in Baghdad on 28 April,  </p>
<p>described in Section 9.1).</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> Direct UN administration of Iraq would cross “a red line </p>
<p>for the US and, probably, the Iraqis themselves”.</p>
<p><b>208. </b> The FCO Research Analysts’ paper on tribes, regions and governorates </p>
<p>described the role of Iraq’s tribes as “a question for the future”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> Too much autonomy </p>
<p>and they could become a rival to the state. If they were ignored, “a potentially useful </p>
<p>counterweight to religious leaderships with political ambitions could be lost in the period </p>
<p>during which the new state will be forming”. Iraqi interlocutors maintained that, unlike in </p>
<p>Afghanistan, because much of the country was flat, it was “relatively easy for control to </p>
<p>be exercised over the whole country (the Kurdish mountains being the main exception)”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p><b>209. </b> The Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) produced a more detailed paper on tribal </p>
<p>dynamics in Iraq and the UK AOR for the Chiefs of Staff on 11 April.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>210. </b> The FCO Research Analysts’ paper on opposition groups distinguished between </p>
<p>those that were credible in Iraq and those that had courted US support, with the two </p>
<p>main Kurdish groups straddling the divide.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p> The UK needed to balance the views of </p>
<p>“external oppositionists who have experience of working in free democratic structures” </p>
<p>with the need “immediately” to involve those in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> The third paper by FCO Research Analysts, on the state of the Iraqi civil service </p>
<p>and bureaucracy, described “a very mixed picture”.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> A large number of able technocrats </p>
<p>had kept the country going in difficult circumstances, while corruption and nepotism had </p>
<p>been given free rein at different levels. The UK had: </p>
<p>“… a fairly clear idea of how big the civil service is (about 1 million employees), </p>
<p>how it is structured and how … employees are paid. We do not have any deep </p>
<p>knowledge about which levels of the administration are so highly politicised as to </p>
<p>need immediate reform, nor which individuals might have to be retired or stood </p>
<p>down. This in any case cannot realistically be assessed until after liberation.</p>
<p>“Once Saddam Hussein’s regime has been ousted, it will certainly be necessary to </p>
<p>remove those who effectively enabled the regime to stay in power. Others, even if </p>
<p>members of the Ba’ath or guilty of minor transgressions, should probably be left in </p>
<p>place if possible in order to keep the machinery of the state running. However, our </p>
<p>(as yet limited) experience inside Iraq gives the warning that officials may in any </p>
<p>case abandon their posts, possibly to seek sanctuary with relatives of their tribes …</p>

<p><b>The MOD’s Red Team </b></p>
<p>Section 6.5 describes the creation of a small “Red Team” in the MOD Defence Intelligence </p>
<p>Staff (DIS) in February 2003. The Red Team was intended to give the Chiefs of Staff and </p>
<p>key planners in the MOD and Whitehall an independent view of intelligence assumptions </p>
<p>and key judgements, to challenge those if appropriate and to identify areas where more </p>
<p>work was needed.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Red Team produced two reports before the invasion (see Section 6.5). Three more </p>
<p>were produced before the Red Team was disbanded on 18 April:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘What will Happen in Baghdad?’;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘The Future Governance of Iraq’;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘The Strands of the Rope’ (an assessment of the steps needed to achieve an effective </p>
<p>Iraqi Interim Administration and hand over to a representative government of Iraq).</p>
<p>On 7 April, the Red Team issued a report on the likely developments in Baghdad in the </p>
<p>days, weeks and months ahead:</p>
<p>“The security apparatus works on fear, not professionalism. With the removal of fear </p>
<p>there may well be a widespread law and order problem. The police are all Ba’ath </p>
<p>members and cannot initially be trusted until the worst Ba’athists are identified and </p>
<p>removed. According to one military interlocutor, the RA [regular army] is the only </p>
<p>respected national institution and could be used for internal security duties, if better </p>
<p>trained and equipped.</p>
<p>“Once Saddam is gone there is likely to be widespread and apparently random </p>
<p>violence between Iraqis. Specific attacks against Coalition Forces are likely to </p>
<p>come later (perhaps some months later) if particular individuals or groups feel they </p>
<p>are being cut out of contracts, administration positions etc. They may then hire </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>42</p>
<p>On the role of the Ba’ath Party, the Red Team stated: </p>
<p>“To be a Ba’athist does not necessarily mean an individual is a hard core supporter of </p>
<p>the regime. Most joined to advance their careers or under duress (mostly government </p>
<p>employees). In every government department there is a hard-core … </p>
<p>“It will require detailed inside knowledge to identify the ‘bad apples’ in any </p>
<p>organisation; it may not necessarily be the head of the organisation, it could be </p>
<p>the number two or three, or someone even further down the hierarchy. Outsiders, </p>
<p>particularly Westerners – who lack detailed knowledge of pre-war political agendas </p>
<p>which are unconnected with the Saddam regime – may need to exercise caution to </p>
<p>ensure they do not become unwitting agents in any infighting in any existing Iraqi </p>
<p>organisations that are kept in place.”</p>
<p>The Red Team concluded:</p>
<p>“Historically there is trouble in Iraq whenever central authority is weakened. It may </p>
<p>therefore be advisable to maintain a Coalition military government longer than </p>
<p>currently envisaged …”</p>
<p>On 11 April, in a report on the future governance of Iraq, the Red Team listed five steps for </p>
<p>the successful establishment of a long-term representative Iraqi government: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establishing a peaceful and secure environment. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Answering immediate humanitarian needs. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establishing an effective Interim Administration. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Re-establishing the rule of law … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A constitutional process leading to elections and the withdrawal of Coalition </p>
<p>Forces.”</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>The Red Team concluded that the Coalition would have to make use of indigenous Iraqi </p>
<p>security forces to establish and maintain law and order. The Iraqi Army was described </p>
<p>as the “most trusted and least corrupt national security institution”. It was “Iraq’s oldest </p>
<p>institution and a focus of national pride. Some senior officers and units have remained </p>
<p>sufficiently detached from the regime to be of use.” The Iraqi Army could not be used </p>
<p>everywhere. In the south-east “the Marsh Arabs have cause to hate them”, but they  </p>
<p>would be respected and preferred to Coalition Forces in many areas. In contrast, the civil </p>
<p>police were “a largely discredited and demoralised force … viewed as auxiliaries to the </p>
<p>Ba’athist security apparatus”. However, the Red Team assessed that, in the short term, </p>
<p>it might be worth “making use of them with appropriate direction and supervision from </p>
<p>Coalition forces”.</p>
<p>In its final report, ‘The Strands of the Rope’, issued on 18 April, the Red Team emphasised </p>
<p>the immediate need to re-institute the rule of law in Iraq, using ex-Ba’ath personnel </p>
<p>(“accompanied by a well-publicised and effective screening process that will remove </p>

<p>elements introduced by Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> The Red Team judged that:</p>
<p>“If the IIA can provide a secure environment (including the rule of law), resolve </p>
<p>short-term economic problems and address immediate humanitarian needs, </p>
<p>future Iraqi-led government structures and a process of justice and reconciliation </p>
<p>will emerge naturally, given time.” </p>
<p><b>Decisions to increase UK support for ORHA</b></p>
<p><b>216. </b> On 9 April, in his budget statement to the House of Commons, Mr Gordon Brown, </p>
<p>the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced that he had set aside “an additional </p>
<p>US$100m” to “back up the UN and the work of reconstruction and development”  </p>
<p>(see Section 13.1).</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>217. </b> On 15 April, Mr Boateng advised Ms Short how those funds could be drawn </p>
<p>down.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> He understood that DFID did not need access to additional funds immediately, </p>
<p>given that humanitarian and reconstruction work was at a very early stage, and that </p>
<p>DFID had £95m of uncommitted resources, but he fully expected DFID to bid for </p>
<p>additional funding for Iraq “in the next few months”. Before DFID drew on the new </p>
<p>allocation, Ms Short should write to him, setting out her proposals for how the additional </p>
<p>money would be spent. </p>
<p><b>218. </b> Mr Straw chaired the first meeting of the AHMGIR on 10 April.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> Mr Straw told  </p>
<p>the meeting:</p>
<p>“The prospects for further UN Security Council resolutions were uncertain and </p>
<p>negotiations were very likely to take weeks.”</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Lord Goldsmith said that he was content for ORHA to undertake humanitarian, </p>
<p>security and public order duties and to restore civilian administration but “it must be </p>
<p>careful not to impose reform and restructuring without further legal authority”. US and </p>
<p>UK lawyers would try to agree a Memorandum of Understanding to define how the UK </p>
<p>would be consulted. </p>
<p><b>220. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Straw described the meeting’s agreement that </p>
<p>“the UK should retain a right of veto in extremis” on ORHA activities. UK support should </p>
<p>increase and be formalised through: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirmation of Maj Gen Cross’s position as one of Lt Gen Garner’s deputies;</p>

<p>Mr Malik reported: </p>
<p>“… ORHA is incredibly awful – badly conceived; badly managed; US driven; failing; </p>

<p>support it, but it would be a political judgement (and a big political risk).”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Mr Malik also reported that he was:</p>

<p><b>225. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 15 April, following his return from Kuwait, </p>

<p>136</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>In return, the UK wanted the US to commit to transparency and joint decision-making </p>
<p>(see Section 9.1).</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Mr Straw stated that the US’s intention was:</p>
<p>“… that ORHA will oversee the Phase IV humanitarian and reconstruction effort and </p>
<p>restore normal functioning of Iraqi ministries and provinces, with the aim of phased </p>
<p>restoration of full control of government to the Iraqis themselves. In doing so, the </p>
<p>US intends that it will work as far as possible with and through existing ministries in </p>
<p>Baghdad. A team within ORHA will work on constitutional issues including setting up </p>
<p>the Iraqi Interim Authority (IIA). The US also envisage the establishment of ORHA </p>

<p>45</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Mr Straw reported that the UK’s approach to ORHA had been “cautious”. The UK </p>
<p>would have preferred an organisation less closely tied to the Pentagon and less subject </p>
<p>to US inter-agency politics. There were also significant legal questions. Against that </p>
<p>background, the UK had seconded 12 military and civilian officers to ORHA in Kuwait </p>
<p>and the Pentagon. Their role was to influence ORHA’s thinking on key Phase IV issues </p>
<p>and to ensure that information flowed from theatre to the UK Government, including on </p>
<p>commercial opportunities. </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Mr Straw continued:</p>
<p>“… whatever its shortcomings, ORHA will be the essential element in the ability of </p>
<p>the Coalition to carry its military successes into the post-conflict phase. The legal </p>
<p>constraints are unlikely to be a problem in the first stage of ORHA’s work, which </p>
<p>will be focused on immediate humanitarian and reconstruction needs, including the </p>
<p>restoration of a functioning civil administration …</p>
<p>“I therefore recommend a step change in the resources and personnel we offer … </p>
<p>We are working urgently to establish where we can best make a contribution and </p>
<p>how this will be funded.</p>
<p>“We now need an immediate effort across Government and with the private sector to </p>

<p>that we should appoint people to the economic ministries …”</p>

<p>central Iraq, and advisers in the oil and finance sectors. </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Maj Gen Cross advised that, if all the recommendations were accepted, </p>
<p>the number of UK staff would rise from 19 to “about 100” within an ORHA total of </p>
<p>1,500 (including force protection and support staff).</p>

<p><b>236. </b> Section 15 addresses the recruitment of additional UK secondees to ORHA.  </p>
<p>It shows that there were no contingency preparations for the deployment of more than  </p>

<p>the role of the Coalition and uncertain about the future. Initial reporting shows that </p>
<p>concerns arise quickly about the breakdown of law and order and the need for food </p>
<p>and water. Some pre-war reports suggested that the Iraqi population has high, </p>
<p>perhaps exaggerated, hopes that the Coalition will rapidly improve their lives by </p>
<p>improving their access to clean drinking water, electricity and sanitation. However, </p>
<p>even without any war damage, there are severe shortfalls in the infrastructure of </p>
<p>these sectors, and in healthcare. Looting has made matters worse …</p>
<p>“There is no sign yet of widespread popular support for opposition to the Coalition. </p>
<p>We judge that, at least in the short term, the details of the post-Saddam political </p>

<p>142</p>
<p> Section 9.1 describes </p>
<p>how the creation of the CPA signalled a major change in the US approach to Iraq, from </p>
<p>a short military Occupation to an extended civil administration, and concludes that the </p>
<p>UK was slow to recognise that change. </p>

<p>northern and eastern border provinces, central Iraq and southern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> The IPU stated that the UK remained concerned that US policy in Iraq would not be </p>
<p>consistent with the UK’s understanding of the rights and responsibilities of an Occupying </p>
<p>Power. If a UK-led ORHA region included within it areas occupied by US forces, the UK </p>
<p>would have legal responsibility for their actions but no practical way to control them.</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The IPU advised that the UK therefore needed to decide whether in principle </p>
<p>it wanted to lead a regional office covering a region coterminous with that in which </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div was responsible for maintaining security. If Ministers wanted to pursue that </p>

<p><b>246. </b> The arguments against were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the reputational risks associated with creating a region where the UK had a </p>
<p>high profile (“If the Coalition Provisional Authority ran into difficulty … this would </p>
<p>impact on the UK’s standing in Iraq to a greater degree than if we remained a </p>
<p>(junior) partner in ORHA without a clear regional responsibility”); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>limited resources; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>if ORHA/the US failed to provide resources for activities in the UK-led region, the </p>
<p>UK could be faced with the choice of finding resources itself or “being seen to </p>
<p>fail in the eyes of the local population and more widely”.</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Sir David advised Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“I think you will have to give firm direction. My own view is that we should accept </p>
<p>the risks and lead a regional office to cover area for which we have military </p>
<p>responsibility.”</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>248. </b> Mr Blair chaired the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 17 April.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>249. </b> Ms Short expressed reservations about suggestions that DFID should fund the </p>
<p>extra staff for ORHA. </p>
<p><b>250. </b> Mr Blair concluded that ORHA:</p>
<p>“… was important in getting Iraq back on its feet. We should have influence inside </p>
<p>it. He was sympathetic to the British taking a regional lead in the Office, and wanted </p>
<p>the scoping study completed quickly so that final decisions could be made on our </p>
<p>participation. On the proposal for an additional contribution to the Office [ORHA], </p>
<p>work should proceed quickly to identify posts and potential candidates. The issue of </p>
<p>funding should be addressed … before Ministers met on 24 April. There should be </p>
<p>no bureaucratic hold up in sorting out this priority.”</p>

<p>Priority areas included:</p>

<p>volunteers to reach Baghdad on around 5 May, to allow them to shape ORHA’s work </p>
<p>and approach from the start …</p>
<p>“In all cases, enthusiasm and personal qualities are likely to be just as important as </p>
<p>specific expertise.” </p>
<p><b>259. </b> The IPU list attached to Sir Michael’s letter drew heavily on Maj Gen Cross’ earlier </p>
<p>“must/should/could” list, but incorporated a number of changes including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>upgrading the Oil Ministry to “must fill”, citing UK commercial interests and the </p>
<p>presence of major Iraqi oil installations in the UK’s AOR; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>upgrading infrastructure ministries to “must fill”, citing the “important </p>
<p>commercial dimension”.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> The IPU list only considered ORHA’s work to strengthen Iraqi ministries. It did </p>
<p>not identify staffing requirements for ORHA’s regional offices or for ORHA’s senior </p>
<p>management team. Maj Gen Cross had listed UK support for ORHA regional offices as </p>
<p>“must fill”, the provision of a UK civilian to lead an ORHA regional office as a “should </p>
<p>fill”, and had identified a senior individual to join Garner’s senior management team as </p>
<p>a “must fill”. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> On the same day as Sir Michael Jay’s request for volunteers, Ms Short’s Private </p>
<p>Office sent Mr Malik’s report on his visit to ORHA in Kuwait to No.10, the Cabinet </p>

<p>Attorney General’s Office.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>262. </b> Mr Malik’s report stated that ORHA was “simply not prepared” to meet the </p>
<p>immediate recovery needs in Iraq; those would need to be addressed by the military </p>
<p>and, security permitting, by UN agencies and NGOs. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Malik assessed that ORHA was more focused on longer-term reconstruction </p>
<p>and reform. A number of large USAID contracts had been let, and there was “some  </p>
<p>good thinking” in a number of reform areas, but it remained to be seen whether ORHA’s </p>
<p>plans and contracts were flexible enough to respond to conditions on the ground. </p>
<p>ORHA’s teams and pillars were not well co-ordinated and there was “little sense of  </p>
<p>a unifying strategy”. </p>
<p><b>264. </b> ORHA’s plans for reconstruction and civil administration were broad and not </p>
<p>obviously limited to those of an Occupying Power; UK collaboration would therefore </p>
<p>require further legal advice. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>265. </b> The ORHA(South) team had, to date, proved largely ineffective. UK forces had </p>
<p>now begun to plan on the basis that they would get little practical support from ORHA </p>
<p>in the immediate recovery phase. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> The covering letter from Ms Short’s Private Office stated: </p>
<p>“The visit report … has clear implications for the planned Ministerial discussion </p>
<p>[at the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation on 25 April] regarding UK </p>
<p>secondments to ORHA. Given the competing claims on scarce resources to support </p>
<p>Iraq, Ministers will wish to prioritise any staff deployments carefully. Ministers and </p>
<p>Accounting Officers will also wish to satisfy themselves that any UK secondments </p>
<p>to ORHA meet the usual standards of effectiveness and cost efficiency.” </p>
<p><b>267. </b> Sir David Manning commented: “Very unhelpful. More than a whiff of ‘not invented </p>
<p>here’ so won’t support/try to improve.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p><b>268. </b> An annex to Mr Malik’s report, marked “Not for circulation outside DFID” and not </p>
<p>sent to No.10 or other departments, added:</p>
<p>“Overall, engagement with ORHA is very high risk. Across the board, staffing is </p>
<p>thin, management is weak, officials are frustrated, there is poor strategy/planning, </p>
<p>weak internal communications and decision making. Equally, it could be argued that </p>
<p>engagement would help address these weaknesses.</p>
<p>“Poorly worked out plans could do damage on the ground. Equally, there are areas </p>
<p>in which good teams have been assembled and good planning is underway. In these </p>
<p>areas, ORHA will set the agenda or reform for some years to come.</p>
<p>“The key judgement is whether UK policy makers can influence an ORHA that is and </p>
<p>will remain dominated by US DoD.”</p>
<p>154</p>
<p><b>269. </b> The annex identified three options for DFID:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>No engagement. This would marginalise DFID within the UK Government and in </p>
<p>ORHA. It would, however, “safeguard” DFID and leave it free to engage with the </p>
<p>UN, IFIs and NGOs and pursue a “more normal DFID country operation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Full engagement “as proposed by the Foreign Secretary and General  </p>
<p>Tim Cross”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Limited engagement in carefully chosen areas, in an “eyes and ears” role as </p>
<p>directed by Ms Short. That would comprise three or four DFID secondees.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Ms Short chaired a meeting with Ms Sally Keeble, DFID Parliamentary Under </p>
<p>Secretary of State, and DFID officials on 23 April, to discuss DFID planning and support </p>
<p>for ORHA.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>271. </b> Ms Short agreed a suggestion from Mr Chakrabarti that other departments should </p>
<p>be given access to the £60m announced by Mr Brown in his 9 April budget statement to </p>
<p>pay for their secondments to ORHA. That would mean that they, rather than DFID, would </p>
<p>have to pass the Treasury’s tests on value for money and effectiveness.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> A DFID official suggested that DFID needed to develop a “game plan for the </p>
<p>coming weeks and months”, to help DFID’s planning, enable it to influence the </p>
<p>wider international system and to help agree roles and responsibilities within the UK </p>
<p>government. Ms Keeble agreed that such a plan could be useful, but stated that DFID </p>
<p>“would need to be very clear that all parts of such a plan which related to DFID were </p>
<p>owned and managed by us, and not by No.10 or a Cabinet Office structure we could not </p>
<p>trust”. Ms Short agreed, noting that aiming for a cross-Whitehall plan risked producing </p>
<p>an end result that did not tally with DFID’s view on its own or others’ roles.</p>
<p><b>273. </b> Ms Short stated that DFID “should not start from a presupposition that we  </p>
<p>would work with ORHA, but begin by looking at the tasks which needed to be achieved, </p>
<p>and within that framework whether it made sense to engage with ORHA”. The first </p>
<p>priority was to establish law and order, which was a task for the military, not ORHA. </p>
<p>Second was immediate assistance, a task for the ICRC rather than ORHA. The third </p>
<p>priority, paying wages, was a task for ORHA and the UK needed to understand their </p>
<p>plans, but key recovery issues, including financing needs, would emerge from the IFI </p>
<p>needs assessment. </p>
<p><b>274. </b> Ms Short concluded that DFID needed “one or two people” within ORHA to act as </p>
<p>DFID’s “eyes and ears”. DFID “should not bow to external pressure to put people into </p>
<p>ORHA for the sake of it”, but test each proposal individually.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> On 24 April, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), advised </p>
<p>the AHMGIR that the US planned to divide Iraq into five sectors.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> The UK military would </p>
<p>lead one sector, comprising four provinces in south-eastern Iraq. That was “manageable </p>
<p>… provided that other countries offered troops to work with us” and the UK could take </p>
<p>on a fifth province “if others contributed the necessary forces for it”. The southern region </p>
<p>of ORHA would follow the boundaries of the UK’s sector. </p>
<p><b>276. </b> Ministers agreed that “the size of the UK military sector will depend on the </p>
<p>permissiveness of the environment and the extent of other nations’ contributions, but </p>
<p>the current assumption was that it would comprise four, or possibly five provinces in the </p>
<p>South”. The MOD was instructed to report progress at the next meeting.</p>

<p><b>277. </b> Ministers also agreed that departments should continue to recruit additional </p>
<p>secondees to ORHA, “with a view to a significant increase by 5 May”, and that the UK </p>
<p>should offer to play “a leading role in ORHA south-eastern regional HQ, provided that </p>
<p>ORHA leaders confirm that it would be coterminous with the emerging UK-led security </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Chilcott reported to Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle East and North </p>
<p>Africa, that Maj Gen Cross was “a star act” but was “frustrated and angry at Whitehall’s </p>
<p>slowness to support him”, particularly DFID and the MOD. Mr Chilcott hoped that the </p>
<p>progress now being made would show Maj Gen Cross that “Ministers’ enthusiasm for </p>
<p>ORHA is finally being translated into extra staff”. </p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Chilcott also reported that security and communications were the biggest </p>
<p>problems facing ORHA staff. </p>
<p><b>281. </b> The FCO has not been able to provide the Inquiry with a copy of Mr Chilcott’s </p>
<p>report on the case for reinforcing ORHA(South).</p>

<p><b>284. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Cross described both his time with ORHA </p>
<p>in Kuwait and his initial experience in Baghdad: </p>
<p>“Garner had made it clear that he wanted me to be his ‘Coalition’ Deputy, </p>
<p>notwithstanding the fact that the UK had still not confirmed publicly that we had </p>
<p>anyone in his team. I was still a LO [liaison officer] with a very small team, and  </p>
<p>I was not receiving any clear direction from Whitehall, other than not to commit the </p>
<p>UK to anything! </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>“My UK team was strengthened a little, including a very useful media team provided </p>
<p>by Alistair Campbell, effectively from within No 10. But my attempts to get significant </p>

<p>“We established good links into the UK Division. Garner wanted to establish an </p>
<p>ORHA office/footprint in or around Basra as soon as events allowed, and he wanted </p>
<p>it to be UK led – initially by me. Whitehall seemed to refuse to countenance the idea; </p>
<p>it was never explained to me why this was so, but I sensed a fear that this would </p>
<p>lead to [the] UK having to bear the brunt of reconstruction costs in the South/South </p>
<p>West area. I was given fairly clear direction not to agree to this – just about the only </p>
<p>clear direction I received on any issue!”</p>
<p>159</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Maj Gen Cross told the Inquiry that, once in Baghdad, Lt Gen Garner’s authority </p>
<p>became “brutally exposed”: </p>
<p>“The [ORHA] ministry teams fanned out and each reported back, initially quite </p>
<p>positively. Most found Iraqis prepared to work with us, buildings standing and files </p>
<p>etc available – many having been secured at the homes of various officials. But as </p>
<p>the security situation began to deteriorate the US military commanders refused to </p>
<p>provide sufficient escort vehicles, and then stopped anyone moving around without </p>
<p>an escort. Meetings were disrupted and, most crucially, the Ministry buildings began </p>
<p>to be targeted and burnt and looted – Garner repeatedly asked for crucial key points </p>
<p>to be guarded but his pleas met with little response. Linked to this the contractual </p>
<p>support from the USAID reconstruction effort failed to materialise. There were few </p>
<p>resources to work with, and a vacuum of inactivity was created. </p>
<p>“… Garner realised that we couldn’t possibly run the country – we had nowhere </p>
<p>near enough people to do that – so we had to enable them [the Iraqi people] to </p>
<p>do it themselves. But his efforts were undermined and he got little support from </p>
<p>Washington. I received no direction from the UK on our policy on this.”</p>
<p>160</p>
<p><b>286. </b> Maj Gen Cross also told the Inquiry that, as security in Baghdad worsened, he </p>
<p>secured equipment, vehicles and personal protection through personal contacts in the </p>
<p>UK Armed Forces.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> He received little support from the UK Government: </p>
<p>“To be fair communications were difficult, but I was given little support – still no idea </p>
<p>what our UK strategic intent was, no response to my ‘Must-Should-Could’ paper. </p>
<p>If it had not been for my personal contacts within the UK military I would have had </p>
<p>virtually no support … my impression was that Whitehall was uncertain of where to </p>
<p>go from here, and I sensed that the FCO felt it better not to be implicated too much </p>
<p>in what was happening – rather let the MOD get it wrong!!”</p>

<p>55</p>
<p><b>288. </b> The paper stated that Iraq’s oil fields had been undamaged by the fighting, </p>
<p>although a few wells had been sabotaged. Those fires were now all extinguished. There </p>
<p>had been some looting and damage to pipelines and oil refineries. </p>
<p><b>289. </b> There was a growing shortage of gas (for power stations), fuel and cooking gas, </p>
<p>particularly in the South. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> The paper stated that, within the Security Council, oil remained a contentious </p>
<p>issue. Council members had different motivations. The UK and US were keen to get </p>
<p>Iraqi oil flowing again as soon as possible “to meet humanitarian/reconstruction needs”. </p>
<p>France and Russia wanted to protect the interests of their companies that had existing </p>
<p>contracts under the OFF programme. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> The UK was proposing a three-phase approach to dealing with Iraqi oil and the </p>
<p>OFF programme:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To extend resolution 1472 to 3 June (the end of the current OFF programme </p>
<p>phase), and possibly extend the OFF programme itself beyond 3 June. If </p>
<p>the OFF programme continued “for any length of time”, the UN Secretary-</p>
<p>General would need enhanced powers to sell Iraqi oil and buy the full range </p>
<p>of humanitarian supplies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To pass control of Iraqi oil and gas revenues to a “credible interim </p>
<p>administration” once one had been established, subject to certain checks to </p>
<p>protect against mismanagement or “unfairness”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To hand over full control over oil and oil revenues to a democratically elected </p>
<p>Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>292. </b> The UK and the US agreed that all strategic decisions on the development of </p>
<p>the oil industry should be left to a “representative Iraqi government” and that, in the </p>
<p>meantime, all oil business should be handled in as transparent a manner as possible. </p>
<p><b>293. </b> Introducing the paper at the AHMGIR meeting, an FCO official said that Iraq’s oil </p>

<p><b>297. </b> On 24 April, Sir Michael Jay recommended to Mr Straw that the Iraq Planning Unit </p>
<p>(IPU) should merge with the Iraq Section of the FCO’s Middle East Department (MED) </p>
<p>and be renamed the Iraq Policy Unit.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> The mechanisms in place since mid-January</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p>had worked well, but were not sustainable indefinitely. There was a need for “a stable </p>
<p>structure which will enable us to sustain the considerable effort which will now be </p>
<p>needed for quite a while yet”. </p>
<p><b>298. </b> Sir Michael proposed retaining the Iraq Planning Unit’s Whitehall-wide character, in </p>
<p>particular by recruiting a high proportion of staff on secondment from other departments. </p>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<p>“This will be a high priority for the Office [FCO] over the next months at least. We </p>
<p>shall find the necessary resources, though this will have to be at the expense of </p>
<p>lower priority work elsewhere.” </p>

<p><b>301. </b> Ms Short described the UK role in Basra as “exemplary, but life was still disrupted”. </p>
<p>In Baghdad, conditions were more difficult and residual anti-American feeling was </p>

<p> AM Burridge had </p>
<p>described DFID as “a disgrace, a bloody disgrace”. He had been frustrated by DFID’s </p>
<p>reaction to military action from the outset: </p>
<p>“DFID’s officials had attended planning meetings, apparently under instructions </p>
<p>not to participate in discussions or make preparations for the humanitarian </p>
<p>consequences of military action. As a result, DFID was unprepared when military </p>
<p>action finally started. Since then they have been trying to catch up. Sometimes the </p>
<p>inadequacy of preparations was hampering rather than helping aid distribution in the </p>
<p>southern region. In Burridge’s view DFID needed to get involved – and quickly. The </p>
<p>lack of co-operation with ORHA was of concern.</p>
<p>“Reconstruction was the key area where DFID could be involved in a highly visible </p>
<p>way. But so far nothing seemed to be happening.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>311. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Lord Boyce echoed AM Burridge’s criticism of </p>
<p>DFID.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> Lord Boyce described DFID as “particularly un-co-operative, particularly as led </p>
<p>by Clare Short”. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… you had people on the ground who were excellent operators for DFID, who </p>
<p>were told to sit in a tent and not do anything because that’s the instruction they had </p>
<p>received and I actually met them.”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> Lord Boyce also told the Inquiry that the UK military “had hoped DFID would be </p>
<p>showing up in force” to work alongside Major General Robin Brims, General Officer </p>
<p>Commanding (GOC) 1 (UK) Div.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>313. </b> In response to a question about the steps taken by the MOD to ensure that </p>
<p>sufficient civilian capacity would be available, Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I don’t know is the short answer … [T]his is an area … where there was a </p>
<p>breakdown, because … we didn’t get the introduction of civilian aid in the way </p>
<p>that we actually expected it, and General Brims who did have a DFID officer in his </p>
<p>headquarters, and to whom I spoke on the ground in Iraq after the invasion or during </p>
<p>the invasion, was frustrated by the fact that … the person was not getting the sort of </p>
<p>support from head office that they were expecting and I know that General Brims felt </p>
<p>equally frustrated.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Gen Brims, who left Basra in May 2003, told the Inquiry that, although the DFID </p>
<p>adviser in his headquarters reported back to DFID as Phase IV began:</p>
<p>“I didn’t see a result coming back … I don’t think during my time in Basra I received </p>
<p>any UK finance to help the reconstruction at that stage. I think that the initial finance </p>
<p>to help the reconstruction all came from Baghdad, ie it was American or it was Iraqi </p>
<p>money from Baghdad coming down, for example, to pay policemen.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Gen Brims said that what he “really needed” in his headquarters was a Consul </p>
<p>General and “some people with experience of running large cities”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>316. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that there had been “absolutely no </p>
<p>instruction … for anyone to sit in their tents and do nothing”.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> He had spoken to the </p>
<p>DFID advisers concerned, who had said that they had not told anyone that they had </p>
<p>been instructed to sit in their tents and do nothing. Sir Suma suggested that Lord </p>
<p>Boyce’s criticism related to the poor personal relationship between Lord Boyce and </p>
<p>Clare Short. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>317. </b> On the wider question of the level of DFID advice to and support for the military,  </p>
<p>Sir Suma told the Inquiry that “the military were right to expect more DFID support than </p>
<p>they perhaps got in terms of civil military advisers in the field”. Sir Suma suggested that:</p>
<p>“If you open up the operational security barrier on planning earlier, you engage  </p>
<p>more in joint planning earlier, I think … the deployments would probably have </p>
<p>happened earlier.” </p>
<p><b>318. </b> On 1 May, Mr O’Brien sent Mr Straw a report of his visit, describing ORHA as “the </p>
<p>only game in town”.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> Mr O’Brien was “convinced that we either need to be fully involved </p>
<p>with supporting ORHA, or get the UN into Iraq”. The former would be easier to achieve, </p>
<p>and the UK could provide much-needed support. </p>
<p><b>319. </b> Mr O’Brien highlighted the need to deploy a senior UK official to ORHA </p>
<p>immediately to take an active role in policy formation. </p>
<p><b>320. </b> Mr O’Brien also highlighted the need to strengthen the IPU: </p>
<p>“<b>In tandem we need to ensure that we give the IPU the necessary manpower </b></p>
<p><b>to be able to service ORHA properly</b>. Too much is falling on Dominick Chilcott’s </p>
<p>shoulders. He needs more support. <b>Urgent policy decisions need to be taken at </b></p>
<p><b>Ministerial level</b>.” </p>
<p><b>321. </b> In a statement to Parliament on 30 April, Mr Hoon announced that:</p>
<p>“Decisive combat operations in Iraq are now complete, and Coalition Forces are </p>
<p>increasingly focusing upon stabilisation tasks. It will therefore be possible to make </p>
<p>further force level adjustments over the coming weeks while continuing to meet our </p>
<p>responsibilities to the Iraqi people.” </p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Mr Hoon concluded:</p>
<p>“While details continue to be clarified, we envisage that by mid-May 25,000-30,000 </p>
<p>UK Service personnel will remain deployed in the Gulf region, continuing to fulfil our </p>
<p>responsibilities towards the Iraqi people. The planned replacement of forces is clear </p>
<p>evidence of our commitment to them.</p>
<p>“Our aim is to leave an Iraq that is confident, secure and fully integrated with </p>
<p>the international community. The planning process to establish the precise level </p>
<p>of the continuing UK presence needed to achieve this aim is a dynamic one, and </p>
<p>is kept under review. We will also need to take account of the contributions of </p>
<p>Coalition partners. We will continue to withdraw assets and personnel from the </p>
<p>region where possible, but we will maintain an appropriate military presence for </p>
<p>as long as necessary.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>323. </b> On 1 May, after consultations between Mr Straw and Mr Per Stig Møller, the </p>
<p>Danish Foreign Minister,</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> the Danish Government announced the appointment of </p>
<p>Mr Ole Olsen, Danish Ambassador to Syria, as Head of ORHA(South) for a term of  </p>
<p>six months.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>324. </b> The Inquiry has seen no record of those consultations. The Cabinet Office update </p>
<p>for Ministers on 1 May stated only that the Danes had been told the UK was “happy that </p>
<p>their candidate (Ole Olsen) should lead the office”.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>325. </b> Overnight on 1/2 May, the UK military’s AO was adjusted to be coterminous with </p>
<p>the boundaries of Basra and Maysan Provinces.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>326. </b> On 2 May, Secretary Rumsfeld and Mr Hoon met at Heathrow, before the Defense </p>
<p>Secretary flew back to the US.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> Mr Hoon stressed the necessity for ORHA to make </p>
<p>tangible progress. Secretary Rumsfeld was reported to have:</p>
<p>“… played down expectations somewhat, and cautioned against waiting for a  </p>
<p>fully formed organisation with a large pot of money. We should keep going </p>
<p>pragmatically and keep scratching round for contributions where they were available. </p>
<p>This could be done by the UK in their own area. Imposing order within the country </p>
<p>would take time; it would take effort to get the ministries up and running and the </p>
<p>people back to work.”</p>
<p><b>327. </b> On 2 May, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft to propose that </p>
<p>Mr John Sawers, then British Ambassador to Egypt, should be appointed as the </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq to “take the lead for the UK in guiding </p>
<p>the political processes leading to the establishment of an Iraqi Interim Authority”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Mr Sawers’ appointment is addressed in Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>Reconstruction strategy and funding</b></p>
<p><b>328. </b> On 2 May, Ms Anna Bewes, Ms Short’s Principal Private Secretary, sent Mr Rycroft </p>
<p>an “Interim DFID Strategy” for the next three to six months as Iraq transitioned from </p>
<p>“relief/recovery to reconstruction”.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> </p>

<p>61</p>
<p>that the Interim Strategy drew on the conclusions of the AHMGIR and discussions with </p>
<p>other departments and development agencies. </p>
<p><b>330. </b> The Interim Strategy stated that the pledge made to the Iraqi people in the ‘Vision </p>
<p>for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ issued at the Azores Summit would: </p>
<p>“… require a full, democratically elected government with control over a  </p>
<p>unified and transparent budget, free from sanctions and integrated into the </p>
<p>international economy, pursuing a programme of sustainable economic growth and </p>
<p>poverty reduction.”</p>
<p>DFID’s aim was:</p>
<p>“… to help Iraq reach its development potential, to secure a stable future where the </p>
<p>needs of the whole population are met equitably and sustainably.” </p>
<p><b>331. </b> The Interim Strategy stated that, while the expected humanitarian crisis had  </p>
<p>not materialised, four “immediate recovery tasks” needed to be addressed in the next </p>
<p>three months: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>getting public services running again, including by paying salaries;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-establishing law and order, with Coalition support and using Iraqi civilian </p>
<p>police where available;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>meeting the needs of the vulnerable by maintaining the OFF food distribution </p>
<p>system beyond 3 June (with or without the OFF programme itself); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>restoring public infrastructure, including power and water supplies and sanitation </p>
<p>and sewerage systems.</p>
<p><b>332. </b> Drawing on DFID’s experience in other post-conflict and transition countries, and </p>
<p>given Iraq’s characteristics as an oil-rich economy with a well-educated population, DFID </p>
<p>would consider support (but did not anticipate playing the leading role) in four areas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic management; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SSR;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>public administration reform; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the political transition process. </p>
<p><b>333. </b> DFID would also help to ensure effective co-ordination of international </p>
<p>development assistance, including between ORHA, the IMF, the World Bank and  </p>
<p>the UN. </p>
<p><b>334. </b> During the six-month transitional period, DFID would need to establish a small, </p>
<p>temporary presence in Basra and a presence in Baghdad. Its presence thereafter  </p>
<p>would be determined by “emerging needs” and the UK’s relationship with the </p>
<p>Government of Iraq. Given Iraq’s oil wealth and human capital, DFID’s engagement was </p>
<p>likely to be limited to about five years and focused on “strategic technical assistance </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>inputs”. That longer-term presence would be considered in a strategy review scheduled </p>
<p>for October 2003.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> The Interim Strategy stated that DFID had earmarked £210m for “relief, recovery </p>
<p>and reconstruction activities” during 2003/04.</p>
<p>188</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>336. </b> Drawing on figures provided by DFID, the Inquiry calculates that DFID committed </p>
<p>£117.8m to the humanitarian relief effort in the period up to May 2003, of which £89m </p>
<p>had been disbursed: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£78m to UN agencies (£64m disbursed);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£32m to the ICRC and the Iraqi Red Crescent (£18m disbursed);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£6.2m to NGOs (£5.4m disbursed); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£1.6m for DFID’s bilateral effort (all disbursed).</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>337. </b> Approximately £90m therefore remained available for “recovery and reconstruction” </p>
<p>and further contributions to the humanitarian relief effort.</p>
<p><b>338. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indication of any assessment of whether that budget </p>
<p>for recovery and reconstruction was sufficient to achieve the UK’s aspirations and </p>
<p>objectives.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> US funding for reconstruction was of a different magnitude.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> In April 2003, the US Congress approved US$2.4bn for the newly created Iraq </p>
<p>Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF1), to pay for “humanitarian assistance” and </p>
<p>“rehabilitation and reconstruction in Iraq”.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>341. </b> Over 70 percent of the fund (US$1.82bn) was allocated to USAID. By early May, </p>
<p>USAID had awarded US$1.5bn in contracts for projects to restore infrastructure and </p>
<p>support initiatives for health, education, agriculture and economic reform. The largest </p>
<p>contract, worth US$680m, was secured by Bechtel to restore infrastructure. </p>
<p><b>Concerns over the scale of the reconstruction challenge and </b></p>
<p><b>ORHA’s response</b></p>
<p><b>342. </b> In early May, the UK Government became increasingly concerned about the scale </p>

<p><b>343. </b> Mr Rycroft sent Mr Blair the DFID Interim Strategy, Mr O’Brien’s and Mr Chilcott’s </p>
<p>reports from Iraq, and an IPU update on ORHA on 2 May.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p> Mr Rycroft commented:</p>
<p>“… ORHA is not yet up to the job. It has no effective management. There is no </p>
<p>clear understanding of who is making policy … A State Department Ambassador, </p>
<p>Bremmer [sic], is due to take over from Jay Garner. </p>
<p>“UK input remains insufficient. But Whitehall has at last got your message that we </p>
<p>need to send good people into all bits of ORHA …”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> Mr Rycroft identified some immediate points for Mr Blair’s attention:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO was appointing Mr John Sawers to work “in or very closely with” </p>
<p>ORHA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK would seek to persuade the US to keep ORHA for the short term, before </p>
<p>handing over to the IIA and a UN-led mission to support the IIA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA should “get the Iraqi ministries operating again, and improve their media </p>
<p>work so that improvements in infrastructure are visible”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA should develop a plan for SSR.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Blair indicated that he agreed with those points. He commented: “I want to hear </p>
<p>from Tim Cross that his concerns are being met next week”.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p><b>346. </b> Mr Rycroft informed the FCO on 6 May that Mr Blair remained concerned that </p>
<p>ORHA lacked proper management, but welcomed the increase in UK support.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft asked for further advice by 9 May on the UK’s contribution to ORHA, ORHA’s </p>
<p>internal management and priorities, and an assessment of whether Maj Gen Cross’s </p>
<p>concerns were now being met. </p>
<p><b>347. </b> Mr Sawers arrived in Baghdad on 7 May.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p><b>348. </b> The FCO advised No.10 on 9 May that good progress had been made in stepping </p>
<p>up UK military and civilian support for ORHA.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> So far, 34 public sector volunteers had </p>
<p>completed pre-deployment training; 11 more would be trained the following week.  </p>
<p>A first batch of 22 was scheduled to leave for Iraq on 13 May with a similar-sized group </p>
<p>to follow a week later. The key to ORHA’s success would be achieving results with </p>
<p>the Iraqi ministries in Baghdad; support for that work would be the UK’s “main effort”, </p>

<p><b>349. </b> The FCO also advised that ORHA’s top priority was “restore what is left of Iraqi </p>
<p>public administration, so that people can return to work and basic services can be </p>
<p>delivered once again”. </p>
<p><b>350. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by telephone on 7 May on a broad range of </p>
<p>foreign policy issues.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> Mr Blair commented that ORHA “must grip the nuts and bolts </p>
<p>of reconstruction, not just focus on politics”.</p>
<p><b>351. </b> On 9 May, the IPU informed Mr Straw’s Private Office that it was now clear that </p>
<p>negotiations between the US and UK for an MOU covering ORHA’s operations were </p>
<p>unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> The implications for the UK of that situation are addressed in </p>
<p>Section 9.1. </p>
<p><b>352. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff (CGS), visited Iraq from  </p>
<p>7 to 10 May. He reported his concerns about the pace of reconstruction, especially in </p>
<p>the South, to General Sir Michael Walker, Adm Boyce’s successor as CDS, on 13 May: </p>
<p>“Despite recovering some of the essential public utilities to pre-war standards, </p>
<p>it is startlingly apparent that we are not delivering that which was deemed to be </p>
<p>promised and is expected … 1 (UK) Armoured Div have formulated a sound plan </p>
<p>involving all the lines of operation and effect that are required to create a viable </p>
<p>state. However, they have reached the limit of their technical capabilities and </p>
<p>desperately need subject matter experts … They have had an embedded DFID </p>
<p>representative since initial deployment who has made all the right requests for some </p>
<p>time, but no action follows … This situation is compounded by a comprehensive </p>
<p>stripping of the public sector infrastructure, an inability to pay public sector </p>
<p>employees, a lack of NGO support and planning, and a complete lack of direction </p>
<p>and effective action from ORHA.”</p>
<p>198 </p>
<p><b>353. </b> Gen Jackson concluded: </p>
<p>“We must release the financial, personnel and infrastructure resources to effect </p>
<p>a quicker delivery of reconstruction. If not we will lose the consent we have so </p>
<p>successfully achieved.” </p>
<p><b>354. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indication that the report was sent outside the MOD. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> On 11 May, Mr Sawers reported: </p>
<p>“Four days in Iraq has been enough to identify the main reasons why the </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq is so slow. The Coalition are widely welcomed, but are </p>
<p>gradually losing public support.</p>

<p>“Garner’s outfit, ORHA, is an unbelievable mess. No leadership, no strategy, </p>
<p>no co-ordination, no structure, and inaccessible to ordinary Iraqis … </p>
<p>“I have not yet been out of the capital, but it is clear that Baghdad is the biggest </p>
<p>problem … Baghdad has the worst security, a poor level of essential services, </p>
<p>and no information flow. I will recommend to Bremer a Baghdad First strategy. We </p>
<p>can afford some of the regions to languish. But failure in Baghdad would fatally </p>
<p>undermine our success in the conflict.”</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>356. </b> Mr Sawers listed the main challenges:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be no progress until security improved.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There needed to be a clear and credible de-Ba’athification policy. ORHA had </p>
<p>made mistakes by appointing “quite senior” Ba’ath Party figures as their main </p>
<p>partners in the Trade and Health Ministries, and at Baghdad University.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With security and credible de-Ba’athification would come the chance for </p>
<p>“durable reconstruction”. Bechtel was moving far too slowly. It needed “to </p>
<p>swamp Baghdad with engineers and skilled labour”. Quick impact projects were </p>
<p>also needed to demonstrate that progress was being made. Those were not a </p>
<p>substitute for long-term development, but would meet genuine needs and were </p>
<p>a “political requirement”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Coalition needed to do more to get out its messages.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Money needed to be found to pay public sector workers. US$740m in seized </p>
<p>Iraqi funds that could be used was held up in Washington.</p>

<p>on 1 June, at which point ORHA would be incorporated into the CPA.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>358. </b> The names ‘ORHA’ and ‘CPA’ continued to be used interchangeably in documents </p>
<p>seen by the Inquiry for some time after Ambassador Bremer’s appointment. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> Sir John Sawers told the Inquiry that, although he was “the senior Brit on the </p>

<p>202</p>
<p> Rather, he was a representative of the UK Government </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>360. </b> On 12 May, Ms Short resigned from the Government. In her letter of resignation </p>
<p>to Mr Blair she said that she thought the run-up to the conflict had been mishandled, </p>
<p>but had agreed to stay to support the reconstruction effort.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> However:</p>
<p>“… the assurances you gave me about the need for a UN mandate to establish a </p>
<p>legitimate Iraqi government have been breached. The Security Council resolution </p>
<p>that you and Jack [Straw] have so secretly negotiated contradicts the assurances I </p>
<p>have given in the House of Commons and elsewhere about the legal authority of the </p>
<p>Occupying Powers, and the need for a UN-led process to establish a legitimate Iraqi </p>
<p>government. This makes my position impossible.”</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Ms Short was succeeded by Baroness Amos, who had previously been Minister of </p>
<p>State for International Development. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> Mr Hilary Benn was appointed Minister of State. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Ms Short’s resignation and the Mr Blair’s response are addressed in more detail </p>
<p>in Section 9.1.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Baroness Amos attended the 15 May meeting of the AHMGIR.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>365. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR meeting stated that UK forces in southern </p>
<p>Iraq generally enjoyed the goodwill of the local population and emerging political </p>
<p>leaders, but that a continued permissive environment and, in the medium term, the </p>
<p>withdrawal of UK forces “depends in part on the local population receiving real benefits </p>
<p>from Coalition occupation”.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> The scale of the reconstruction challenge was “enormous”. </p>
<p>Large projects would fall to ORHA and subsequently the Iraqi authorities. But there was </p>
<p>a case now for “smaller refurbishment projects”. ORHA had plans for such projects but </p>
<p>had been slow to implement them. “In the meantime, given the relatively benign security </p>
<p>situation, UK forces have spare capacity to turn to reconstruction efforts.” </p>
<p><b>366. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that, of the £10m allocated to the UK military </p>
<p>for quick impact projects (QIPs), only £50,000 had been spent. Of the £30m allocated </p>
<p>to the UK military for humanitarian relief operations in the UK’s AO, only £3m had been </p>
<p>committed and £1m spent. The remainder could be used for other purposes. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> In discussion, Mr Boateng agreed that the MOD could spend the balance of </p>
<p>the £10m allocated for QIPs, but said that “other funds for reconstruction” had been </p>
<p>allocated to DFID.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> The MOD and DFID needed to discuss the issue.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Baroness Amos said that ORHA needed some quick wins to establish its </p>
<p>reputation. DFID would put ideas to Ministers the following week. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>369. </b> Ministers agreed that DFID should discuss with the MOD, the Permanent Joint </p>
<p>Headquarters (PJHQ), 1 (UK) Div, ORHA and the IPU “measures to achieve a step </p>
<p>change in rehabilitation in the South”, before discussing funding with the Treasury </p>
<p>and presenting a plan to the AHMGIR on 22 May.</p>
<p><b> </b></p>
<p><b>370. </b> On 16 May, Ambassador Bremer issued CPA Regulation No.1.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> It stated: </p>
<p>“The CPA shall exercise powers of government temporarily in order to provide for </p>
<p>the effective administration of Iraq during the period of transitional administration, </p>
<p>to restore conditions of security and stability, to create conditions in which the Iraqi </p>
<p>people can freely determine their own political future, including by advancing efforts </p>
<p>to restore and establish national and local institutions for representative governance </p>
<p>and facilitating economic recovery and sustainable reconstruction and development.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>371. </b> The DFID team in Basra sent DFID a stock-take of the situation in the South on </p>
<p>19 May.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> ORHA(South) was suffering from the lack of policy guidance, support and </p>
<p>specialist staffing from ORHA(Baghdad). Danish staff in ORHA(South) had received </p>
<p>US$500,000 from the Danish Government; that appeared to be all of ORHA(South)’s </p>
<p>“immediately accessible” funding. ORHA(South) barely had enough staff to cover the </p>
<p>most urgent tasks, such as the payment of salaries; more support was required. There </p>
<p>was a risk that neglect by ORHA(South) in these initial months would allow “alternative </p>
<p>structures” to emerge. </p>
<p><b>372. </b> The DFID team also reported that “many military units” had said that they did not </p>
<p>have the capacity to implement QIPs to the extent that they would like. 1 (UK) Div was </p>
<p>aware of the “disconnect” between their capacity and the need to implement £29m worth </p>
<p>of QIPs. The DFID team recommended that military capacity should be augmented. </p>
<p><b>373. </b> Sir David Manning visited Baghdad and Basra for the first time from 20 to 21 May. </p>
<p>In his report to Mr Blair, he echoed Mr Sawers’ assessment that Baghdad was key, </p>
<p>observing that Basra was “way ahead” of Baghdad. Joining the growing chorus of critics </p>
<p>of ORHA, Sir David described it as a “shambles”.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>374. </b> Sir David described Ambassador Bremer as “impressive”. One way of helping him </p>
<p>would be to get DFID:</p>
<p>“… properly and energetically engaged. (There is a residue of bitterness about </p>
<p>their lack of involvement: they have committed few people and have apparently just </p>
<p>completed their third independent reconnaissance about security for staff before </p>
<p>deploying more people). Valerie [Amos] will make things change. I hope she will get </p>
<p>experts to ORHA very fast.” </p>

<p>210</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>376. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 22 May meeting of the AHMGIR stated that </p>
<p>the arrival of Ambassador Bremer, who was “working closely” with Mr Sawers, had </p>
<p>made a significant impact on ORHA’s efficiency, but not yet its performance on the </p>
<p>ground.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> Officials were close to agreeing with Mr Andy Bearpark, UN Deputy Special </p>
<p>Representative in Kosovo, that he should succeed Maj Gen Cross, who was due to </p>
<p>leave ORHA in June. Mr Bearpark needed to be given the right job to “maximise UK </p>
<p>influence in ORHA”. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that 24 UK secondees had arrived in Iraq on </p>
<p>16 May, making a total of 61 UK secondees to ORHA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>11 of those were based in the </p>
<p>ORHA(South) office in Basra.</p>
<p><b>378. </b> Ministers agreed that Maj Gen Cross should be replaced by “a senior UK civilian </p>
<p>experienced in humanitarian and reconstruction work, placed in a senior position”.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>379. </b> Mr Bearpark was subsequently appointed CPA Director of Operations and </p>
<p>Infrastructure. He arrived in Baghdad on 16 June.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Section 9.2 describes how, although UK officials in Whitehall regarded Mr Bearpark </p>
<p>as the UK’s senior representative in the CPA, Mr Bearpark saw his primary loyalty as </p>
<p>lying with the CPA and Ambassador Bremer. </p>
<p><b>381. </b> The 22 May meeting of the AHMGIR also considered a joint DFID/MOD paper on </p>
<p>achieving a “step change” in reconstruction in the South, requested by the AHMGIR the </p>
<p>previous week.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> The paper, entitled ‘Iraq: Rehabilitation in ORHA Region Lower South’, defined the </p>
<p>UK’s role in the South: </p>
<p>“The ORHA Lower South sector will be closely associated with the UK. Although the </p>
<p>ORHA regional office is headed by a Dane … the presence of a UK two-star regional </p>
<p>military headquarters will make the UK’s role in the area pre-eminent. The UK will </p>
<p>have the greatest number of military personnel in the region and, as one of two initial </p>
<p>Occupying Powers, will be seen by other nations to have leading responsibility for </p>
<p>the Lower South Region. If there are difficulties in the Lower South region it will be </p>
<p>the UK (and, immediately, the UK military) that will have to face them first.”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>383. </b> The paper also set out the rationale for UK assistance. ORHA’s “mobilisation” was </p>
<p>proceeding slowly, and the UK was concerned that its use of large enabling contracts </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>would not prove sufficiently flexible or responsive, although there were no realistic </p>
<p>options until the IFIs and World Bank engaged. Much of ORHA’s funding had to come </p>
<p>through a US bureaucratic process which even senior members of the US Administration </p>
<p>described as “frustratingly slow”. </p>
<p><b>384. </b> The paper stated: </p>
<p>“It is in the UK’s self-interest (quite aside from, although coincident with, the interests </p>
<p>of the Iraqis) that rehabilitation and reconstruction proceed smoothly and rapidly. </p>
<p>Without rapid and visible rehabilitation and reconstruction it is possible that there </p>
<p>will be an erosion of the consent to the presence of the Coalition Forces. This is a </p>
<p>particular concern to 1(UK) Div as reconstruction is off to a slow start … </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“There is thus a near-term gap in the provision of rehabilitation and reconstruction </p>
<p>assistance to Iraq. Inasmuch as the UK is responsible for the Lower South Region, </p>
<p>the UK is responsible for filling that gap.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>385. </b> The paper concluded that the success of the Lower South ORHA office would </p>
<p>depend on UK direction and capacity in a manner analogous to ORHA’s reliance on the </p>
<p>US, and that the UK required a plan to address immediate rehabilitation needs and to </p>
<p>encourage greater long-term investment and engagement in reconstruction activities. </p>
<p>The plan should comprise:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support for the ORHA Lower South regional office, including help to draw  </p>
<p>up an operational plan for rehabilitation, additional staff to help manage  </p>
<p>projects, and running costs. The paper also proposed that the UK Government </p>
<p>should establish sufficient capability in the UK to manage its support for </p>
<p>rehabilitation; PJHQ would be able to offer advice to the FCO on how such a </p>
<p>team should be structured.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reallocation of the £20m allocated to the military to support Internally </p>
<p>Displaced People (IDPs), to fund QIPs. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Funding for short, discrete projects to build the capacity of the Iraqi </p>
<p>administration capacity in key areas. </p>
<p><b>386. </b> Ministers were invited to agree the “concept” described in the paper. </p>
<p><b>387. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR meeting invited Ministers to agree that the </p>
<p>UK should step up the reconstruction effort in the “southern military sector” by: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in the short term, encouraging UK forces, with the assistance of DFID advisers, </p>
<p>to identify and implement QIPs; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>over the next month, building the capacity of ORHA(South) to identify and </p>
<p>implement reconstruction projects, including by seconding additional staff where </p>
<p>necessary and developing an operational reconstruction plan;</p>

<p>on DFID’s role in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> Much of this appeared to have been inspired by UK </p>
<p>military personnel in Iraq or Doha, although direct feedback from the UK military was </p>
<p>that DFID’s support was “highly valued”. </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Malik commented:</p>
<p>“There is some frustration amongst military personnel in Basra that they have not </p>
<p>been able to hand over the post conflict effort to civilian agencies quickly enough. </p>
<p>However, to a large extent this reflects the security environment … and the failure of </p>
<p>ORHA to deliver. Over the coming days we will be reinforcing advisory support to the </p>
<p>military and ORHA, and will be assessing what more we can do.”</p>

<p><b>397. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that Ms Short’s resignation, the exchanges </p>
<p>within the UK Government that had preceded it, and the adoption of resolution 1483 led </p>
<p>to a significant shift in DFID’s attitude to ORHA: </p>
<p>“… we [DFID] didn’t think ORHA would be actually the lead in terms of post-conflict </p>
<p>work. We thought the UN would take that role on. The UN was geared up to do so, </p>
<p>putting more staff into Iraq at the time … </p>
<p>“The penny dropped that … ORHA was going to be the only game in town when </p>
<p>1483 was passed. It probably dropped actually with Clare Short’s resignation </p>
<p>… because it was at that point we realised that perhaps there wasn’t a shared </p>
<p>objective on UN leadership in the British Government because the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>conversation with Clare Short made that clear. From that point on, we had to try and </p>
<p>make ORHA work better whether we liked it or not.”</p>

<p><b>399. </b> DFID advised that the humanitarian situation was improving steadily, although </p>
<p>security remained a key concern.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> Without security, it would be difficult to achieve </p>
<p>progress in other areas. In many parts of Iraq, water and power services were “almost at </p>
<p>pre-conflict levels”. Looking ahead, rebuilding Iraqi public institutions would be the main </p>
<p>challenge. ORHA had a central role to play; DFID had stepped up its “staff support” for </p>
<p>ORHA in Baghdad and Basra and was looking at additional areas to support. </p>
<p><b>400. </b> The FCO advised that Ambassador Bremer’s arrival had yet to translate into </p>
<p>improvements on the ground.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> The UK now had 61 secondees in ORHA (including in </p>
<p>Basra), most of whom were working with Iraqi ministries. </p>
<p><b>401. </b> Success in ORHA(South) was “crucial to achieving UK national objectives in Iraq”. </p>
<p>The UK had provided a Deputy to Ambassador Olsen and 10 other secondees, and </p>
<p>planned to further reinforce ORHA(South) by: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing more secondees; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing an operational plan compatible with ORHA’s national plan; and </p>

<p>and the UN” and humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> The briefing on humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>reported that there was no humanitarian crisis in southern Iraq: </p>
<p>“Food, water, power and other essentials are available in towns across the UK’s </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Our priority is the provision of a safe and secure environment. </p>
<p>“UK forces will continue to deliver emergency relief where it is needed, and where </p>
<p>they are able to do. However, as the security situation stabilises enough for civilian aid </p>
<p>agencies to fully deploy, we are rightly handing some responsibilities over to them.”</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Nicholas Cannon, Mr Blair’s Assistant Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, </p>
<p>passed the briefings to Mr Blair on 27 May, with the comment: “you may encounter </p>

<p>are already better than pre-conflict levels) and about the law and order situation”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>404. </b> Mr Blair met Ambassador Bremer in Basra on 29 May.</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>told Mr Blair that the first phase of the CPA’s work would involve demonstrating that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime had definitively disappeared, by delivering improvements in </p>
<p>basic services (which were already mostly up to pre-conflict levels) and maintaining law </p>
<p>and order. The second phase would include the revival of the economy, the first stage </p>
<p>of establishing a free Iraqi Government, and the revival of civil society. Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer’s “target economic end state” was a liberal, open market economy. </p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Blair asked about resources. Ambassador Bremer confirmed that he had no </p>
<p>resource constraints; the CPA had between US$4bn and US$5bn available to spend. </p>
<p><b>406. </b> Ambassador Bremer discussed the inadequacy of ORHA’s strategic </p>
<p>communications in a separate meeting with Mr Alastair Campbell, Mr Blair’s Director </p>
<p>of Communications and Strategy.</p>

<p> Mr Campbell suggested that Mr John Buck, Head </p>

<p>Iraq shortly, should take on the task of drawing up a strategic communications plan. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer agreed. </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Buck described the situation he faced on his arrival in Iraq in his evidence </p>
<p>to the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… there was no coherent communications operation. The US Army were doing one </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>408. </b> A Cabinet Office update for Ministers on 29 May reported that (unspecified) recent </p>
<p>initiatives by Ambassador Bremer and the DoD underlined the need to press the US </p>
<p>to consult more systematically with the UK.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> The UK was having some success at </p>
<p>influencing US thinking, including through Mr Sawers, the British Embassy Washington, </p>
<p>an FCO Legal Adviser seconded to the CPA, and regular contacts between US and UK </p>
<p>lawyers (in the last few days, those contacts had persuaded the US to drop the death </p>
<p>penalty from a CPA Penal Order), but consultation remained “haphazard”. Ministers </p>
<p>should be prepared for “further abrupt changes in US policy”.</p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Sawers reported by telegram on 1 June: </p>
<p>“ORHA is no more, replaced by the Coalition Provision Authority …</p>
<p>“Jay Garner departed on 1 June … ORHA, with its reputation as a failure, is being </p>
<p>buried with him. Bremer’s brisk management style and additional powers have </p>
<p>enabled him to impose a new structure with a new name that should lead to a more </p>
<p>coherent approach to re-building Iraq.”</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>410. </b> Mr Sawers advised that Mr Andy Bearpark would be the CPA’s Director of </p>
<p>Operations, with: “Across the board responsibility for policy implementation, leading on </p>
<p>top priority tasks, managing the CPA’s regional structure, and operational co-ordination </p>
<p>with the UN.” Mr Bearpark arrived in Baghdad on 16 June; his role is considered later in </p>
<p>this Section.</p>
<p><b>411. <i></b> Hard Lessons </i>recorded that ORHA had 600 staff when it was absorbed by the CPA </p>
<p>during May.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p> That fell “far short of what it [the CPA] needed to manage its burgeoning </p>
<p>relief and reconstruction program”. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> Also on 1 June, the Deputy to Ambassador Olsen in ORHA(South), a UK official, </p>
<p>sent two reports to Mr Chilcott. The first offered her first impressions: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Office infrastructure was (and still is) virtually non-existent, living conditions </p>
<p>were (and still are) pretty miserable …” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA(South) had no operating budget and was running, “sparsely”, on funding </p>
<p>from the Danish Foreign Ministry and Ambassador Olsen’s own bank account.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA(South) had no security guards or caterers, and had been forbidden </p>
<p>from contracting them directly. UK pressure on ORHA(Baghdad) to provide that </p>
<p>support would be appreciated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA(South) had 21 staff (eight UK civilians, five UK military officers, five </p>
<p>Danish civilians, two US military officers, and one Japanese civilian). Additional </p>
<p>staff were arriving “in trickles” but were predominately military officers and had </p>

<p>were useful as “stopgaps”, but ORHA(Baghdad) needed to provide expert staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA(Baghdad) was “dysfunctional and totally pre-occupied with Baghdad”. </p>
<p>There had been no attempt to engage with ORHA(South), including on policy </p>
<p>issues. Communication was virtually non-existent (it remained impossible to </p>
<p>telephone anyone in Baghdad).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ambassador Olsen was “very unhappy” with the seeming indifference of </p>
<p>ORHA(Baghdad) and the lack of resources. It was not out of the question that </p>
<p>he would leave if things did not improve. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ORHA(South)’s “concept of operations” was to work jointly with the military  </p>
<p>and, once it had built its knowledge base and secured the necessary resources, </p>
<p>to move into the lead allowing the military to focus on security and their  </p>
<p>exit strategy. That would not happen until ORHA(South) had considerably  </p>
<p>more people.</p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Her second report provided an assessment of ORHA(South)’s staffing </p>
<p>requirement.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> Additional support was required in 15 areas; in most of those, three or </p>
<p>four specialists would be required to make a discernible difference across the region. </p>
<p>The areas included: electricity; water and sewerage; infrastructure/reconstruction; the </p>
<p>judiciary; human rights; gender issues; the economy (two DFID advisers were due to </p>
<p>arrive in Basra shortly); political analysis; and the media. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> ORHA(South) itself needed an office manager, a logistics manager, a finance </p>
<p>officer, an information manager and security staff (both for the office and to enable </p>
<p>moves outside Basra).</p>
<p><b>415. </b> After returning to the UK, Mr Blair sent a personal Note to President Bush.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair wrote: </p>
<p>“I met Jerry Bremer and others in Iraq. He is very impressive, got a real grip and is </p>
<p>doing a great job. But the task is absolutely awesome and I’m not at all sure we’re </p>
<p>geared for it. This is worse than re-building a country from scratch. </p>
<p>“We start from a really backward position. In time, it can be sorted. But time counts </p>
<p>against us …” </p>
<p><b>416. </b> Mr Blair went on to suggest that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security in Baghdad had to be dealt with at once. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The Coalition’s communications strategy had to be put on a more energetic </p>
<p>footing.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CPA needed greater administrative capacity. Mr Blair proposed a small  </p>
<p>US/UK team “with one of our people from our own circle” to act as a rapid </p>
<p>conduit to President Bush and himself, enabling them to clear the bureaucratic </p>
<p>obstacles immediately.</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Mr Blair concluded his Note by stating that he would be “going back to almost </p>
<p>a war footing” in order to ensure focus on issues in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed Iraq over breakfast on 2 June.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> Mr Blair </p>
<p>emphasised the “huge scale” of the reconstruction task. Saddam Hussein had left an </p>
<p>“appalling” legacy and reduced a potentially rich country to third world levels of poverty. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer was being asked to take on “a shattered country with decrepit </p>
<p>infrastructure and a population that had developed a dependency culture”. That was </p>
<p>“a very tall order”. He should be given whatever he wanted for capacity building.</p>
<p><b>419. </b> Mr Blair also argued that a clear political vision and timetable was needed, together </p>
<p>with a media strategy to avoid “a dangerous information vacuum”. </p>
<p><b>420. </b> On 3 June, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on Iraq attended by Mr Hoon, Baroness </p>
<p>Amos, Sir Michael Jay (in Mr Straw’s absence) and No.10 officials.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that </p>
<p>he had returned from Iraq convinced that “an enormous amount needed to be done”.  </p>
<p>He told the meeting: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CPA lacked grip and organisation, rather than money or staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK should “beef up” its involvement in the CPA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a White House/No.10 team to work alongside Mr Sawers and </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a strong civilian team in the South.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The CPA and US decision-making processes were too slow. Contracts needed </p>
<p>to be processed faster.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>British companies needed to be energised to take up opportunities in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Blair also said that he believed that Whitehall should go back to “a war footing” </p>
<p>for the next two to three months to avoid “losing the peace in Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>422. </b> Following the meeting, Mr Cannon commissioned a number of papers to be </p>
<p>ready before a further meeting on 6 June. Those included a list of 10 to 15 outstanding, </p>
<p>practical issues for Mr Blair to raise with President Bush that would “make a big </p>

<p>Iraqi media. </p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Rycroft subsequently told Mr Chilcott, who had been tasked to produce that list </p>
<p>of outstanding practical issues, that Mr Blair was “looking for some really big ticket items </p>
<p>to push”, along the lines of:</p>
<p>“1.  Get x people in to sort out the police.</p>
<p>2.  Move y US forces from a to b to improve security.</p>
<p>3.  Get Bechtel to build by X date a new power station in place y.</p>
<p>4.  Ask x big figure person to go to Iraq to sort out the TV.</p>
<p>5.  currency.</p>
<p>6.  CPA internal.</p>
<p>7.  setting up IIA.</p>
<p>8.  Basra – give CPA Basra $x million, and … etc etc.” </p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Mr Rycroft added that Mr Blair did not need “lots of analysis of what’s going wrong </p>
<p>… he knows that”. He needed “things that are concrete and ambitious enough so that  </p>
<p>if/when they happen they really transform the place”. </p>
<p><b>425. </b> Mr Chilcott replied that he could not produce a “serious paper” with the specific </p>
<p>detail requested:</p>
<p>“To offer advice on where to build big infrastructure projects … requires a lot more </p>
<p>knowledge than we have in the IPU about local conditions … and some sense of </p>
<p>an overall development plan for Iraq – something the World Bank will presumably </p>
<p>draw up once they have got themselves engaged. These judgements will have to </p>
<p>be carefully considered by development experts.</p>
<p>“In my view, the two most important things the PM should raise with the President </p>
<p>now are (a) security and (b) the functioning of the CPA. Until these are solved, there </p>
<p>is little chance of any infrastructure work making much impact.”</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There should be a process to identify and resolve “logjams”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK needed “urgently to think through:</p>
<p>{</p>

<p>what are the key priorities? (Infrastructure? Water? Power?)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>what are the blockages?</p>

<p>where, how big, how much it would cost and let the contracts asap.” </p>
<p><b>428. </b> Baroness Amos commented that “the Prime Minister’s thinking seemed to be that </p>
<p>the UK would put in the people; US the money”, and that he did not seem to accept that </p>
<p>President Bush might not be able to produce immediate funding. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Baroness Amos stated that DFID should think “carefully but urgently” about the </p>
<p>concerns and proposals presented by Mr Blair. DFID should not simply “reflect back” </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s proposals, if those were not exactly what were needed. This could be a very </p>
<p>good opportunity to address (unspecified) difficult issues. </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Baroness Amos added that she did not believe that the main problem with the CPA </p>
<p>was a lack of people, or that it could be solved by putting more people in. It was more </p>
<p>likely to be a lack of strategic thinking. </p>
<p><b>431. </b> Baroness Amos also reported that, after the meeting with Mr Blair, she had agreed </p>
<p>with Mr Hoon and Sir Michael Jay that a cross-departmental paper should be produced </p>
<p>for the next meeting of the AHMGIR, addressing the points raised by Mr Blair. </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Later on 3 June, Baroness Amos sent Mr Blair a report on her visit to Washington </p>

<p>242</p>
<p> She reported that:</p>
<p>“… US inter-agency conflicts are making for bad policy on Iraq, with negligible </p>
<p>co-ordination and a potentially dangerous lack of leadership. There is no strategic </p>
<p>direction, and no sense of what the US wants to achieve.” </p>
<p><b>433. </b> The solution was for the UK “to set out a clear vision for Phase IV, sell it to </p>
<p>President Bush (and hence Rumsfeld) and use it to build alliances beyond the Coalition”. </p>
<p><b>434. </b> Baroness Amos also reported that the World Bank and the IMF had started work </p>
<p>on a reconstruction needs assessment. Work was Washington-based, but experts were </p>
<p>ready to visit Iraq “as soon as the security situation permits”. </p>
<p><b>435. </b> Baroness Amos confirmed that she would visit Iraq shortly. To maintain the </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>436. </b> A draft version of the list of 10 to 15 outstanding, practical issues requested by </p>
<p>Mr Blair on 3 June, produced by the IPU, was considered by the 5 June meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR, chaired by Mr Straw.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>437. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair later that day:</p>
<p>“We [the AHMGIR] fully shared your view that an enormous amount of work remains </p>
<p>to be done. We were concerned that the US was not showing the same energy, </p>
<p>focus and drive in the reconstruction effort that they did in the military campaign. </p>
<p>“Colleagues also felt strongly that the US must not be allowed to take UK support </p>
<p>for granted. Otherwise, as the US ultimately called the shots, we risked being </p>
<p>caught in a position of sharing responsibility for events in Iraq without holding the </p>
<p>corresponding power to influence them. In that context, the Treasury expressed </p>
<p>worries about the provisional arrangements for disbursing oil revenues from the </p>
<p>Development Fund for Iraq …”</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Mr Straw attached a revised IPU paper, which he described as “setting out what </p>
<p>needs to be done to make reconstruction work, containing ideas which would make a big </p>
<p>difference to the people of Iraq”. He highlighted the importance of preventing looting and </p>
<p>criminality and turning the CPA into an efficient, functioning organisation, adding: </p>
<p>“Unless we put these two foundation stones in place, reconstruction will continue  </p>
<p>to falter.”</p>
<p><b>439. </b> The IPU paper, entitled ‘Iraq Reconstruction: 30 Day Priorities’, stated that the US </p>
<p>and UK needed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear, coherent strategic plan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a timetable for delivering it; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regular contact between Mr Blair, President Bush and Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>to review progress and agree next steps. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> The IPU proposed “some specific targets we [the US and UK] should now set </p>
<p>ourselves, for delivery within 30 days”, in six areas:</p>
<p>“1.  Restore security …</p>
<p>2.  Agree and implement a strategic plan for the CPA</p>
<p> </p>
<p> a)   Agree specific targets for reconstruction direct with Bremer, and agree the </p>
<p>resources needed to deliver them. And then let him get on with his job.</p>

<p>right skills …</p>
<p> </p>
<p> d)   </p>
<p>Make the regional network of CPA offices function – with access to funds, good </p>
<p>communications, inputs into central policy making …</p>
<p>3.  A clear, transparent Coalition decision-making process</p>
<p>…</p>
<p> </p>
<p> b)  Development Fund for Iraq: we must get the decision-making right. We </p>
<p>are jointly responsible for this, legally and politically … Need transparent and </p>
<p>accountable mechanisms for setting Iraq’s budget, priorities for expenditure, and </p>
<p>procedures for disbursement – not just post facto auditing.</p>
<p>4.  Power, water and sewage</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Repairs to essential infrastructure, and provision of essential services, must </p>
<p>be top of CPA’s agenda. We need to speed up decision-making process and </p>
<p>awarding of sub-contracts … </p>
<p>5.  Restoring normal economic life …</p>
<p>6.  Security sector reform …” </p>
<p><b>441. </b> In the paper, the IPU did not consider the resources that would be required to </p>
<p>achieve those targets or the particular role of the UK.</p>
<p><b>442. </b> Mr Straw also attached a list of projects “which urgently need to be taken forward </p>
<p>in and around Basra”, and commented that he, Baroness Amos and Mr Hoon were </p>
<p>“keen to get cracking” on them.</p>
<p><b>443. </b> Mr Straw’s letter was copied to Baroness Amos, Mr Hoon and other Ministers. </p>
<p><b>444. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that a paper on the Iraqi media was produced </p>
<p>for Mr Blair (as No.10 had requested on 3 June). The IPU paper listing “30-day priorities” </p>
<p>identified the need to “communicate to the Iraqi population what we have already done </p>
<p>and what we are trying to achieve”, but did not recommend any associated actions. </p>
<p><b>445. </b> On the same day, Mr Straw sent a personal letter to Mr Blair asking him to raise </p>
<p>a number of points “very forcefully” with President Bush, including: </p>
<p>“Contracts: As you know, the US are completely ruthless on favouring US </p>
<p>companies, and will not help UK companies unless you play hardball with Bush.” </p>
<p>245</p>
<p><b>446. </b> Mr Straw offered as an example of this behaviour, a Bechtel sub-contract to install </p>
<p>170 megawatts (MW) of power capacity in Baghdad. Siemens UK had almost secured </p>
<p>that contract, but it had now “gone cold”.</p>

<p><b>448. </b> Mr Rycroft passed the IPU paper and the list of projects in Basra to Mr Blair on  </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>82</p>
<p><b>450. </b> Mr Cannon reported the main points from the meeting to Mr McDonald. The </p>
<p>meeting had identified “over-zealous” de-Ba’athification and the CPA’s failure to provide </p>
<p>funding for the South as causes of insecurity there. It had agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair should tell President Bush that the UK needed “the decision-making </p>
<p>process on a different footing, so that problems are rapidly referred to the </p>
<p>highest level and obstacles short-cut”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair should write to Ambassador Bremer listing specific projects in the Basra </p>
<p>area needing immediate CPA funding.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Baroness Amos would visit “the UK sector” to enhance DFID operations. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Hewitt should try to visit Iraq to promote the involvement of UK business.</p>
<p><b>451. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush later that day.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> In his report to Mr McDonald </p>
<p>of the conversation, Mr Cannon wrote that Mr Blair had said his main concern was </p>
<p>administration; Ambassador Bremer needed to be able to break through the bureaucratic </p>
<p>obstacles that he faced.</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Mr Blair raised the difficulty Ambassador Bremer was having accessing the funding </p>
<p>he needed. UK projects in Basra had been affected. Mr Blair said that he would write to </p>
<p>both Ambassador Bremer and President Bush setting out those projects. </p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr Blair raised delays in Bechtel’s operations, including unnecessary delays in </p>
<p>agreeing a contract for Siemens UK. The US was chasing Bechtel.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Blair also raised the need for action on replacing Iraq’s currency. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that Mr Blair wrote to Ambassador Bremer and </p>
<p>President Bush, listing the projects requiring immediate CPA funding. </p>
<p><b>456. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 11 June meeting of the AHMGIR stated that the </p>
<p>list of projects “which urgently need to be taken forward in and around Basra”, which </p>
<p>Mr Straw had sent to Mr Blair on 5 June, would “for the most part be implemented as </p>
<p>quick impact projects, once additional engineering staff are in place (DFID is undertaking </p>
<p>urgent recruitment)”.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>457. </b> The Cabinet Office produced a draft proposal for a new, DFID-led Iraq </p>
<p>Rehabilitation Operations Group (IROG) on 10 June.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> The Cabinet Office proposal </p>
<p>stated that, while current administrative structures were “satisfactory and worth keeping”, </p>
<p>now that the UK was moving into an “increasingly operational phase” they were no </p>
<p>longer sufficient. DFID should lead a new Group with a remit to oversee: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>priorities for expenditure from the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI), including the </p>
<p>process of reaching decisions on such expenditures;</p>

<p><b>458. </b> The IPU would continue to have responsibility for administering UK secondments </p>
<p>to the CPA and for SSR. </p>
<p><b>459. </b> DFID sought the FCO’s agreement to the draft proposal.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> An IPU official advised </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that, while there was a good case for setting up a DFID-led </p>
<p>Group to co-ordinate and implement development activity in Iraq, the proposal as drafted </p>
<p>risked fragmenting UK policy-making. It should explicitly state that the IPU remained the </p>
<p>“policy lead for CPA issues as a whole” (and not just for administering UK secondments </p>
<p>and SSR). </p>
<p><b>460. </b> Sir Michael Jay agreed with that advice.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Straw agreed that DFID should set up the IROG but, to ensure a coherent UK </p>
<p>interface with the CPA, stated that it should report to the AHMGIR through the IPU.</p>
<p>253</p>

<p><b>Advice on the UK’s responsibilities as an Occupying Power</b></p>
<p><b>463. </b> A paper on the management of the DFI was submitted to the 5 June meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR (chaired by Mr Straw).</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>464. </b> The paper stated that while resolution 1483 made the UK jointly responsible (with </p>
<p>the US) for disbursements from the DFI, it contained little detail on how the DFI should </p>
<p>be managed. The UK needed to settle that issue quickly with the US; spending decisions </p>
<p>could start being made in the next few weeks. The management arrangements needed </p>
<p>to meet the UK’s objectives in terms of transparency and accountability; in particular, the </p>
<p>arrangements needed to meet the commitments in the resolution to use resources in the </p>
<p>DFI “in a transparent manner” and to ensure that oil sales were “made consistent with </p>
<p>international best practice”. </p>
<p><b>465. </b> The Annotated Agenda stated that the CPA had circulated a draft regulation which </p>
<p>gave the US Administration “sole oversight” over DFI spending.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>would marginalise UK influence and risk presentational problems, but was not settled US </p>
<p>policy. The UK was lobbying in Washington and Baghdad to amend the draft regulation. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Jon Cunliffe, Treasury Managing Director for Macroeconomic Policy and </p>
<p>International Finance, advised Mr Brown the following day that resolution 1483 made </p>
<p>the US and UK jointly responsible, as Occupying Powers, for governing Iraq including, </p>
<p>specifically, for disbursements from the DFI.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> The resolution changed the basis </p>
<p>on which the UK engaged with the US, but the current framework for making and </p>
<p>implementing decisions did not reflect that. As far as economic and financial policy was </p>
<p>concerned, it was “a mess” because: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not clear what decisions Ambassador Bremer could take without approval </p>
<p>from Washington.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer reported to Secretary Rumsfeld; there was no clear </p>
<p>framework in Washington for involving other US departments.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had no clear involvement in decision-making; what UK-US consultation </p>
<p>there was tended to be between No.10 and the White House.</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Mr Cunliffe suggested that this mattered because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had responsibility without power. If money was wasted on a large scale, </p>
<p>or there was an economic policy failure, or the CPA acted in a way that cut </p>
<p>across its mandate under resolution 1483, the UK would be accountable. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Treasury had no way to ensure that the right economic and financial policies </p>
<p>for Iraq were pursued. Attempts to give the IMF and World Bank a direct role in </p>
<p>the use of the DFI had failed. </p>
<p><b>468. </b> Mr Cunliffe reported that he had raised his concerns at the AHMGIR meeting </p>
<p>the previous day; Mr Straw and Baroness Amos had been sympathetic. Mr Cunliffe </p>
<p>understood that No.10 was considering proposing a joint White House/No.10 group, </p>
<p>to which the CPA would report. </p>
<p><b>469. </b> On 9 June, Ms Cathy Adams from the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers sent </p>
<p>a reply to a letter of 21 May from FCO Legal Advisers seeking advice on resolution </p>
<p>1483.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> The advice relating to the formation of a representative government is described </p>
<p>in Section 9.2. </p>
<p><b>470. </b> Ms Adams advised that the resolution clarified the legitimate scope of activity of </p>
<p>the Occupying Powers and authorised them to undertake actions for the reform and </p>
<p>reconstruction of Iraq going beyond the limitations of Geneva Convention IV and the </p>
<p>Hague Regulations. In some cases, such actions had to be carried out in co-ordination </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>with the Special Representative of the Secretary-General (SRSG) or in consultation with </p>
<p>the Iraqi interim administration. </p>
<p><b>471. </b> Particular actions that the resolution appeared to mandate were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promoting economic reconstruction and the conditions for sustainable </p>
<p>development;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promoting human rights; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging international efforts to promote legal and judicial reform. </p>
<p><b>472. </b> To the extent that such actions were not otherwise authorised elsewhere in the </p>
<p>resolution or under occupation law, then there was a clear requirement to act only in  </p>
<p>co-ordination with the SRSG.</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Ms Adams also advised that the resolution clearly imposed joint US/UK </p>
<p>responsibility for disbursements from the DFI, and that it was therefore important to </p>
<p>ensure that the US Government did not take actions in relation to the DFI which were </p>
<p>incompatible with the resolution. She continued: </p>
<p>“The fact that the resolution imposes joint responsibility gives the UK a locus to </p>
<p>argue with the US that we should be fully involved in the decision-taking process. </p>
<p>Anything less would be legally risky.”</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Ms Adams concluded that the resolution did not grant the Coalition full legislative </p>
<p>and executive authority in Iraq, so there was still a need to consider the legality  </p>
<p>of specific proposals against the requirements of occupation law and the terms of  </p>
<p>the resolution.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> The following day, 10 June, the CPA issued a regulation that gave Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer, as “Administrator of the CPA”, authority to oversee and control the </p>
<p>establishment, administration and use of the DFI and to direct disbursements from </p>
<p>the DFI “for those purposes he determines to be for the benefit of the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>476. </b> The regulation also established a Program Review Board (PRB) to develop funding </p>
<p>plans and make recommendations to Ambassador Bremer on expenditures from the </p>
<p>DFI, “in consultation with the Iraqi interim administration, when established”.</p>
<p><b>477. </b> On 12 June, Mr Brenton wrote to Sir David Manning addressing the “considerable </p>
<p>concern around Whitehall that our views are not being taken sufficiently into account in </p>
<p>the formulation of policy on governing Iraq”.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> Mr Brenton described the CPA regulation </p>
<p>on the DFI as “obviously flawed” from the UK’s perspective, and the latest and most </p>

<p><b>479. </b> An IPU update on reconstruction, which was sent to No.10 on 20 June, advised </p>
<p>that the DFI Regulations “met some, but not all of our key requirements”.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>480. </b> The FCO’s covering letter to that update cited the DFI Regulations as one example </p>
<p>of the continuing lack of proper consultation with the UK by the US, but added that the </p>
<p>Regulations did not cross the UK’s “legal red lines”.</p>

<p><b>The first UK plan for reconstruction in the South, 12 June</b></p>
<p><b>482. </b> Ministers agreed the UK’s first plan for reconstruction in CPA(South) on 12 June. </p>
<p>Although the focus remained on securing US and CPA(Baghdad) resources, the plan </p>
<p>provided limited, additional UK support for CPA(South) and QIPs. The plan identified a </p>
<p>need to agree a source of UK funding to meet the costs of being an Occupying Power, </p>
<p>until other (US or Iraqi) sources of funding became available. </p>
<p><b>483. </b> A 12 June PJHQ briefing reported that there was “a trend of intelligence reporting </p>
<p>from the UK AOR showing increasing dissatisfaction of the civil populace”.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>briefing attributed that to a lack of food, failure to ensure essential services “such as </p>
<p>water, electricity and security”, a general increase in anti-Coalition rhetoric from Shia </p>
<p>clerics, a lack of accurate information/news reporting, and a lack of progress in the </p>

<p>improving public communications; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>internationalising the Coalition effort.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> This required urgent action by CPA(Baghdad), in particular to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarify CPA(South)’s remit;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure US companies delivered on their contracts to provide operational support </p>
<p>to CPA(South) and repair essential infrastructure; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide “operating/emergency” funding for Iraqi institutions.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> The paper assessed: </p>
<p>“CPA(South) is unable to deliver in terms of determining priority needs, overseeing </p>
<p>implementation, or supporting the political transition. There is a lack of vision; </p>
<p>CPA(South) is severely undermanned; and has almost no systems or resources in </p>
<p>place to deliver any tangible improvements soon. In consequence, 1 (UK) Div retains </p>
<p>almost all executive authority in the UK area of operations (AO). In turn, locals look </p>
<p>to the British military, not CPA(South), to address local problems. To the extent that </p>
<p>these functions are being carried out at present, it is due to the unstinting efforts of  </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div, the few UK secondees in the South, and, more importantly, the high </p>
<p>quality of the Iraqi counterparts they are working with.”</p>
<p><b>488. </b> UK actions to strengthen CPA(South) included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Exploring the possibility of establishing a CPA(South) Liaison Team in </p>
<p>CPA(Baghdad), to track policy development and champion the South. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CPA(South) needed more senior staff. DFID/FCO would “look for” a “Director of </p>
<p>Operations” to support Ambassador Olsen. The UK should provide at least one </p>
<p>and ideally two of the CPA representatives in the Governorates.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CPA(South) also needed more staff at working level. DFID would “look to recruit” </p>
<p>additional specialist staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The lack of an effective CPA(South) communications operation was a major </p>
<p>constraint. 1 (UK) Div and DFID would complete a joint assessment of needs </p>
<p>by 11 June.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While discussions continued between CPA(South) and CPA(Baghdad) </p>
<p>on securing operating funds for CPA(South), 1 (UK) Div would provide </p>
<p>administrative support to CPA(South) and DFID would look to deploy an office </p>
<p>management team as soon as possible. That team would have access to </p>
<p>operating funds for up to three months, if required. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>88</p>
<p><b>489. </b> The paper assessed that a functioning Iraqi public administration was essential </p>
<p>for “a return to normalcy”. UK actions to restore it included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>CPA(South) and UK representatives would continue to press CPA(Baghdad) </p>
<p>to release funds for the operating budget; this would also require a “high level </p>
<p>political push”. There was a risk that those funds would not immediately be </p>
<p>forthcoming: “We [the UK] therefore need to identify a line of funding that will – </p>
<p>effectively – cover the costs of being an Occupying Power until other sources </p>
<p>are freed up. Realistically, this might be for three months.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1 (UK) Div would continue to focus QIPs on restoring public infrastructure, and </p>
<p>DFID would continue to fund similar activity through UN agencies and NGOs.</p>
<p><b>490. </b> The paper stated that the “total UK package” would be worth £26m over the </p>
<p>six-month period to October, comprising:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£5m from DFID for QIPs</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> (in addition to the £10m already held by the  </p>
<p>UK military);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>up to £10m from DFID for additional senior and support staff, equipment and </p>
<p>if necessary operating costs for CPA(South); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£1m from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool for police training. </p>
<p><b>491. </b> The paper also stated that the UK’s AOR would expand to four Governorates </p>
<p>to match the CPA(South) area. </p>
<p><b>492. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had “a fluctuating contingent” of around 70 secondees in the CPA.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security in the South remained fragile. Iraqi frustration with the pace of progress </p>
<p>could cause the situation to deteriorate. The UK’s ability to “push the pace” </p>
<p>would be constrained by the reduction in UK military force strength following the </p>
<p>transition to the 3rd (UK) Mechanised Division.</p>
<p><b>493. </b> Ministers noted the main recommendations in the DFID/MOD paper and agreed </p>
<p>the UK should: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p> press CPA headquarters to agree the mandate for CPA(South), to ensure </p>
<p>US firms deliver on their contracts, and to provide budgets so that Iraqi public </p>
<p>institutions are able to get back to work;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seek to co-ordinate the UK and CPA reconstruction efforts in the South with the </p>
<p>armies and development agencies of incoming military contingents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase the number of DFID advisers and other staff in CPA(South), particularly </p>
<p>in the area of project management;</p>
<p>265 </p>
<p>The DFID/MOD paper also stated that DFID would provide £6m for QIPs. The Inquiry concludes that </p>
<p>£5m is the correct figure.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>spread UK experience and best practice to the two new provinces in the UK-led </p>
<p>military sector.”</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>494. </b> Closing the meeting, Mr Straw commissioned “a short Iraq strategy paper” for the </p>
<p>next meeting, “agreed at UK official level prior to seeking agreement with the US”. </p>
<p><b>495. </b> The Cabinet Office wrote to the IPU on 16 June to propose that work on that </p>
<p>strategy paper should not continue because: “It now transpires that the CPA is in the </p>
<p>process of drafting its own strategy/vision document.”</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> It would be more sensible to </p>
<p>feed UK views into that document. </p>
<p><b>496. </b> The meeting of the AHMGIR officials’ group on the following day invited </p>
<p>departments to send comments on the CPA’s strategy paper to the IPU.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> Comments </p>
<p>should include the need to consider:</p>
<p>“… environmental and sustainable development issues, the role of women in the </p>
<p>political process and reconstruction generally, the need for a more prominent </p>
<p>reference to the role of UN and the IFIs, and more specific legal wording; UNSCR </p>
<p>1483 did not give the CPA carte blanche.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>497. </b> The officials’ group agreed that the UK needed to impress on Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>and the US “our right to be consulted” on such a fundamental joint Coalition document. </p>
<p><b>498. </b> The CPA’s strategy documents – ‘Vision for Iraq’ and ‘Achieving the Vision’ – were </p>
<p>finalised in July and are described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>499. </b> Mr Andy Bearpark arrived in Baghdad on 16 June to take up the post of CPA </p>
<p>Director of Operations.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> He was the most senior UK official within the CPA. </p>
<p><b>500. </b> Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry that he had received “very straightforward” instructions </p>
<p>during a meeting with Baroness Amos and Mr Chakrabarti before his deployment:</p>
<p>“‘Look, Andy, it is chaos out there. Nobody has the faintest idea of what’s going </p>
<p>on … We know you have got sharp elbows when you need to. Go out there and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>501. </b> He had also been told that he should “owe his allegiance” to the CPA rather than </p>
<p>the UK Government.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> Ambassador Bremer had appreciated and welcomed  </p>
<p>that position. </p>
<p><b>502. </b> Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry that Ambassador Bremer had described his role as </p>
<p>“like a chief operations officer in a private company”.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> That included responsibility for </p>
<p>staffing, life support and the flow of funds to CPA regional offices. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> Mr Bearpark also told the Inquiry that, shortly after arriving in Baghdad, </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer asked him to take on responsibility for all the Iraqi infrastructure </p>
<p>ministries with the exception of the Ministry of Oil.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> At that point, his title had changed </p>
<p>to Director of Operations and Infrastructure. </p>
<p><b>504. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Bearpark why the oil sector had not been included in his </p>
<p>remit.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> He replied: </p>
<p>“It was never, ever said to me officially – and it was certainly never, ever put in </p>
<p>writing, but every member of my staff … said that it was perfectly obvious that I </p>
<p>couldn’t be put in charge of oil because I really wasn’t American … [and] oil would </p>
<p>remain an American interest. </p>
<p>“So it was a very specific instruction from Bremer that I was not in charge of the Oil </p>
<p>Ministry.”</p>
<p><b>505. </b> The UK’s exclusion from oil sector policy during the CPA period is described in </p>
<p>Section 10.3.</p>
<p><b>506. </b> The UN Development Programme hosted technical consultations on Iraq’s </p>
<p>reconstruction needs on 24 June.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>507. </b> The UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New York (UKMIS New York) reported </p>
<p>that Mr Cunliffe, the head of the UK delegation at the consultations, had set out four </p>
<p>priorities including agreement on a multi-donor mechanism for channelling external </p>
<p>resources to reconstruction projects. UKMIS New York commented that Japan, Australia </p>
<p>and the European Commission in particular wanted “an alternative to the DFI”. </p>
<p><b>508. </b> UKMIS New York reported that the event was “a positive first step towards the </p>
<p>internationalisation of the reconstruction effort”, with the UN and IFIs now “proactively </p>
<p>engaged”. There was agreement to hold a formal donor conference, probably in October </p>
<p>2003. Donor interventions were “upbeat”, reflecting a widespread commitment to </p>
<p>reconstruction. But there were important caveats; donors wanted to see early progress </p>

<p>in establishing a representative Iraqi Government and assurances from the CPA that </p>
<p>there would be budgetary transparency and accountability.</p>
<p><b>509. </b> On 24 June, Mr Blair held a meeting to discuss Iraq, attended by Mr Straw, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon, Baroness Amos, CDS and officials.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>510. </b> Mr Hoon reported that Ambassador Olsen, Head CPA(South), was considering </p>
<p>resigning over the lack of funding provided for CPA(South) by CPA(Baghdad).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This was </p>
<p>an opportunity to replace him with a British official. Mr Cannon’s record of the meeting, </p>
<p>which was copied to Baroness Amos, asked the FCO for advice on that point. </p>
<p><b>511. </b> A draft of the CPA’s strategic plan was provided to the 26 June meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> The Annotated Agenda described the draft as “a good basis for further work” </p>
<p>but “still deficient”; it did not include dates for the restoration of a full sovereign Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, lacked reference to macro-economic management and the environment, </p>
<p>exaggerated the role of the free market, did not include proper linkage to resolution </p>
<p>1483, and was “not in a form digestible to Iraqi and regional audiences”.</p>
<p><b>512. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that officials should push for improvements to the CPA’s </p>
<p>strategic plan, particularly on macro-economic issues and linkage to resolution 1483.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>513. </b> The AHMGIR also asked for a weekly assessment of progress in “each of the key </p>
<p>areas” and a daily update. Reports should bring out what was being done in the South, </p>
<p>what the MOD and DFID could do and what would need CPA intervention.</p>
<p><b>514. </b> The first of those weekly assessments was produced for the next meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR, on 3 July. </p>
<p><b>515. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 26 June.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> Mr Blair set out the huge scale of </p>
<p>the reconstruction task and suggested that he and President Bush should hold a video </p>
<p>conference to work through all the reconstruction issues. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> Dr Condoleezza Rice, US National Security Advisor, called on Mr Blair on the </p>
<p>same day.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> Mr Blair emphasised the need for the CPA to be “empowered”. Problems </p>
<p>remained in moving funds from CPA(Baghdad) to CPA(South). Mr Blair hoped that, with </p>
<p>some “easy wins” on infrastructure, the South could become a “showcase”, since the </p>
<p>situation was easier there.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Dr Rice called on Mr Hoon on 27 June.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> Reflecting on Mr Blair’s conversation </p>
<p>with President Bush the previous day, she said that they had agreed that “we were </p>

<p>the problem of moving funds from CPA(Baghdad) to CPA(South) in Washington. </p>
<p><b>518. </b> Mr Hoon said that the South could be an example of progress for the whole of Iraq. </p>
<p>Dr Rice responded that it was important that the South should be a success. </p>
<p><b>519. </b> Dr Rice asked if the drawdown of UK forces in southern Iraq meant a lessening </p>
<p>of UK commitment to the area. Mr Hoon replied that force levels were based on an </p>
<p>assessment of the security situation. He added that it was important that “significant </p>
<p>funds” for reconstruction flowed into the area if a successful outcome was to be achieved.</p>
<p><b>520. </b> Dr Rice called on Sir David Manning on the same day. Sir David expressed </p>
<p>concern about the lack of consultation by the US with the UK.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> Dr Rice indicated that </p>
<p>she had heard about the problems, and had “taken these on board”.</p>
<p><b>Making CPA(South) a model</b></p>
<p><b>521. </b> Baroness Amos visited Iraq from 25 to 26 June, the first visit to Baghdad by a </p>
<p>Cabinet Minister since the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> She met a range of Iraqi </p>
<p>officials, a group of Iraqi women, Mr Vieira de Mello, Ambassador Bremer and  </p>
<p>UK officials.</p>
<p><b>522. </b> In her initial report to Mr Blair on 27 June, Baroness Amos advised that life in Basra </p>
<p>had regained an air of normality.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> However, Iraqi expectations were high; restoring </p>
<p>services to pre-war levels would not be enough. CPA(South) was administratively very </p>
<p>weak. The UK could make the South “a ‘model’”, but this would require a clear vision of </p>
<p>what should be done and strong leadership. Baroness Amos recommended Ambassador </p>
<p>Olsen’s immediate replacement. </p>
<p><b>523. </b> Baroness Amos also highlighted the lack of communication between the CPA and </p>
<p>the Iraqi people, both in Basra and Baghdad: “Rumours of our intent and motives feed </p>
<p>insecurity. People still think we are in it for the oil.”</p>
<p><b>524. </b> On the same day, the FCO advised No.10 that the UK should seek to replace </p>
<p>Ambassador Olsen with a UK official, if he carried out his threat to resign.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> An effective </p>
<p>UK official could improve CPA(South)’s performance and give a boost to reconstruction. </p>
<p>The UK would in any case probably want to provide a successor to Ambassador Olsen </p>
<p>when his tour ended in October. The FCO’s advice was not copied to other government </p>
<p>departments. </p>

<p>93</p>
<p><b>525. </b> Baroness Amos appeared before the International Development Committee (IDC) </p>
<p>on 30 June.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> Mr Tony Worthington invited Baroness Amos to clarify the Government’s </p>
<p>“aspirations” in Iraq, including “about having a sort of British zone”, enabled by some </p>
<p>devolution of powers from CPA(Baghdad). Baroness Amos replied:</p>
<p>“… we see the South very much as a European zone … rather than just a British </p>
<p>zone. The Italians are coming in soon. There is a Dane [Ambassador Olsen] who </p>
<p>is running CPA(South) … The Coalition effort is now very broad.”</p>
<p><b>526. </b> Baroness Amos sent a fuller report of her visit to Iraq to Mr Blair on 2 July.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p> In </p>
<p>her covering letter, she advised that security was the “overwhelming – and immediate – </p>
<p>priority”. The UN planned to scale back the number of international UN staff in Baghdad, </p>
<p>from 300 to 200, on security grounds. Baroness Amos commented: </p>
<p>“This will send an extremely negative signal to both Iraqis and the international </p>
<p>community and – if it takes effect for more than a few weeks – it will also have a </p>
<p>major impact on our recovery and reconstruction effort … We should look again </p>
<p>at the number of troops in theatre and be prepared to put more Coalition (or other </p>
<p>international) troops on the ground if that is required.” </p>
<p><b>527. </b> Baroness Amos stated that the UK’s focus on security in the South (leaving </p>
<p>security in Baghdad largely to the US) was not good enough. Security across Iraq was </p>
<p>the single most important factor in determining the success or failure of political and </p>
<p>reconstruction efforts. The Coalition was running out of time.</p>
<p><b>528. </b> Baroness Amos highlighted three priorities from her report:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreeing a clear timetable for political transition and communicating it to the Iraqi </p>
<p>people; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“urgent actions to effect palpable, significant and immediate improvements in the </p>
<p>lives of the Iraqi people”. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Baroness Amos concluded by asking that Mr Blair raise two issues with President </p>
<p>Bush when they spoke the following day:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the urgent need to grip security in Baghdad; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a public and well-communicated timetable for the political transition. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> Baroness Amos’s report stated that, in many respects, life in Basra and Baghdad </p>
<p>was “returning to normal”. In Basra, water and sanitation services were back at </p>

<p><b>531. </b> CPA(Baghdad) was functioning more effectively, helped by the good relationship </p>
<p>between Mr Sawers and Ambassador Bremer and the arrival of Mr Bearpark. However, </p>
<p>across the CPA, there were: </p>
<p>“… still too many people with the wrong skill set – policy focus rather than </p>

<p><b>537. </b> Sir David Manning sent a note to Mr Blair on 2 July, in advance of a video </p>
<p>conference between Mr Blair and President Bush, offering advice on the conversation.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<p>“This is a key exchange.”</p>
<p><b>538. </b> Of the messages that were vital to get across, Sir David identified security as the </p>
<p>top priority and suggested (noting that the MOD would probably disagree) a surge of </p>
<p>large numbers of troops into Iraq to get through the “security crisis”. This should be </p>
<p>accompanied by an accelerated reconstruction programme and a “very vigorous political </p>
<p>programme” plus an effective media strategy. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> Cabinet met on 3 July, before the video conference.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> In the course of the meeting, </p>
<p>Mr Straw, Baroness Amos and Mr Hoon all emphasised that security was the main issue. </p>
<p>Mr Blair concluded that the UK should make CPA(South) “a model”.</p>
<p><b>540. </b> The video conference took place later that day. In addition to the President and </p>
<p>Mr Blair, Mr Hoon, Mr Rumsfeld, Vice President Cheney and senior UK and US officials </p>
<p>joined the conference in London and Washington. Ambassador Bremer, Mr Sawers </p>
<p>and General Ricardo Sanchez, Commander Combined Joint Task Force – 7, dialled in </p>
<p>from Iraq. </p>
<p><b>541. </b> Mr Blair began by congratulating Ambassador Bremer on the “remarkable </p>
<p>performance” of the CPA.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>542. </b> Mr Blair then listed areas of concern, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security. This was hampering CPA efforts at reconstruction; what more did the </p>
<p>CPA need?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction. Mr Blair underlined the urgency of rebuilding power and water </p>
<p>infrastructure and asked whether there were particular obstacles that needed </p>
<p>to be removed. He observed that Iraqi public expectations were outrunning the </p>
<p>CPA’s capacity to respond. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Communications. It was essential to improve the CPA’s capacity to communicate </p>
<p>with the people of Iraq and handle the local and international media. </p>
<p><b>543. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the UK would do its “level best to meet any demand for </p>
<p>additional resources. If there were any obstacles that needed clearing, Sawers/Bremer </p>
<p>should tell him.”</p>

<p><b>544. </b> The AHMGIR met later on 3 July, chaired by Mr Hoon. </p>
<p><b>545. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting, prepared by the Cabinet Office, reported </p>
<p>that the security situation was “constraining the reconstruction work of the CPA, the UN </p>
<p>and other international actors”.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> As a result of security concerns, UK CPA secondees </p>
<p>were operating a night-time curfew. </p>
<p><b>546. </b> On CPA(South), the Annotated Agenda stated that Ambassador Olsen was leaving </p>
<p>soon; the UK was looking for a strong UK replacement. There had been some progress </p>
<p>in resolving funding and other issues between CPA (South) and CPA(Baghdad), but </p>
<p>operational funding had still not arrived. </p>
<p><b>547. </b> In discussion, Ministers said that “there was no need, at present, to increase  </p>
<p>UK forces”.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>548. </b> Mr Hoon, as Chair of the AHMGIR, summed up the discussion stating “real </p>

<p>reconstruction”. </p>
<p><b>549. </b> The AHMGIR was also provided with: </p>

<p>297</p>

<p>expended surface but not sub-soil DU “on an opportunity basis”.</p>
<p><b>555. </b> The Annotated Agenda stated that the UK was assisting explosive clearance by </p>
<p>providing information, advice and £5m in DFID funding to UN agencies and NGOs. </p>
<p>The MOD was providing information on sites where DU had been used to international </p>
<p>agencies and local communities. </p>
<p><b>556. </b> Ministers agreed that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Environmental issues should be factored into overall policy towards Iraq and that </p>
<p>the UK should consider part-funding the UNEP assessment. </p>

<p>The UK should tackle depleted uranium (and unexploded ordnance) “on the </p>

<p>298</p>
<p><b>The focus of the CPA’s media operations </b></p>
<p>Mr John Buck deployed to Iraq at the end of May 2003, as the CPA’s interim Director of </p>
<p>Strategic Communications. </p>
<p>He provided an assessment of the CPA’s communication effort on his departure from </p>
<p>Baghdad at the end of June.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> Considerable progress had been made. A single structure </p>
<p>had been established and a single information campaign (focusing on getting the Iraqi </p>
<p>people accurate messages about key CPA policies on security, the economy, and </p>
<p>infrastructure and salary payments) had been agreed. The major challenge was to ensure </p>
<p>that this new structure was fully staffed; a successor to Mr Buck had not yet been nominated.</p>
<p>Mr Buck told the Inquiry that, at the time he left Iraq, there was an “embryo” of an effective </p>
<p>CPA media operation.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> However, from his perspective as the new FCO Director Iraq, that </p>
<p>operation subsequently became much less effective:</p>
<p>“… it was something we [the FCO] agonised over a lot, but it was never something </p>
<p>that we had a great deal of control over, and I think part of the problem was that over </p>
<p>time during the autumn, the focus of the US became very much the Presidential </p>
<p>elections. So the whole focus of the media operation became far more domestic … </p>
<p>relaying back to the US what was happening [rather] than actually communicating </p>
<p>with the Iraqi people.”</p>
<p>Mr Andy Bearpark, CPA Director of Operations and Infrastructure, echoed that assessment, </p>
<p>and also set out the danger of not communicating effectively with the Iraqi people: </p>
<p>“At that stage … the CPA strategic communications effort was entirely directed at the </p>
<p>American people. So there was an enormous effort to explain back to the States what </p>
<p>was happening, but zero effort to explain to the Iraqi people what was happening. </p>

<p>banknotes had been in circulation since at least 1990, and were falling apart. </p>

<p><b>562. </b> Sir Michael asked colleagues for advice on possible successors to Ambassador </p>
<p>Olsen. Sir Michael commented that, while he could “see the arguments” for a British </p>

<p>UK citizen, to demonstrate the international dimension to Iraq’s reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>563. </b> Mr Neil Crompton, Mr Chilcott’s successor as Head of the IPU, replied on 9 July.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He recalled that Sir Michael had discussed the question of whether to seek a British or </p>
<p>international replacement with Mr Chaplin and others, and had concluded that the FCO </p>
<p>should seek a British replacement. That conclusion had strong support across Whitehall:</p>
<p>“… where there is desire for a leader with strong political and managerial skills, who </p>
<p>can gain Bremer’s trust, and lead the whole operation in the British AOR.”</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Mr Crompton identified a number of possible candidates for Ambassador Olsen’s </p>
<p>successor, including Sir Hilary Synnott. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 10 July meeting of the AHMGIR invited Ministers </p>
<p>to note and agree that the UK should:</p>

<p><b>replacing Ambassador Olsen with a suitably strong UK figure.”</b> </p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>566. </b> The AHMGIR agreed:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>312</p>
<p> The </p>

<p><b>570. </b> The Annotated Agenda reported that Mr Bearpark recommended against </p>

<p>Baghdad.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> A spread of representation would also give the UK sight of developments </p>

<p>proposed that UK and US media professionals should work out a media plan. If more </p>
<p>resources were needed, they should be made available. </p>

<p><b>581. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 17 July meeting of the AHMGIR advised that </p>
<p>the CPA’s ‘Vision for Iraq’ had been finalised.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>583. </b> The ‘Vision for Iraq’ was underpinned by an implementation plan, ‘Achieving the </p>

<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>584. </b> ‘Achieving the Vision’ defined the CPA’s “primary goal” as:</p>

<p><b>586. <i></b> Achieving the Vision</i> also defined a large number of subsidiary objectives, and </p>
<p>set targets for those objectives for October 2003, January 2004 and “February 2004 </p>
<p>onwards”. The target for power generation was to generate 4,000MW by October 2003 </p>
<p>and 5,000MW by January 2004 (from a base of 2,700MW in May 2003). </p>
<p><b>587. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> assessed:</p>
<p>“The CPA’s <i>Achieving the Vision </i>suffered from some serious flaws. First, Iraqis were </p>
<p>not sufficiently consulted on it. The Iraqi Governing Council … was never given a </p>
<p>chance to provide advice on it … The CPA also had established overly ambitious </p>
<p>infrastructure outcomes before ascertaining baseline conditions and before </p>
<p>determining costs. Moreover, the outcomes had unrealistic completion dates, some </p>
<p>by October 2003, just three months later.”</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>588. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Bearpark if the CPA saw the ‘Vision for Iraq’ as a framework </p>
<p>for delivering an international or just a Coalition reconstruction effort.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> He replied: </p>
<p>“Paradoxically, I think both of those things are true. I think in terms of designing </p>
<p>of the strategy, that was – it was nothing to do with the Coalition. It was a purely </p>
<p>American-led document. So this was the American vision of what should happen, </p>
<p>what the objectives should be.</p>
<p>“There was, however, even at that stage, a recognition on the part of the CPA that </p>
<p>the delivery of these objectives would, in some cases, be impossible without the </p>
<p>wider involvement of the international community.</p>
<p>“So if you like, the CPA viewed the international community as having no role </p>
<p>whatsoever in terms of setting the objectives, but as having a fairly useful role in </p>
<p>terms of delivering some of the objectives, and the easiest way of expressing that </p>
<p>would, as ever, be, in financial terms …”</p>
<p><b>589. </b> In his memoir, Sir Hilary Synnott, who would take up post as Head of CPA(South) </p>
<p>on 30 July, recalled:</p>
<p>“My task was to do my best to manage the region according to Bremer’s plans. </p>
<p>Bremer had the awful task of formulating the plan itself … I forced myself to sit </p>
<p>down and try to read the Vision’s electronic manifestation … The trouble was it </p>
<p>did not amount to an operational plan of action, only a list of subsidiary objectives </p>
<p>under each of these headings. There were no indications about how in practice they </p>
<p>would be achieved: no details of funding, of personnel involved, of support systems </p>
<p>or of timing. It was particularly notable that the ultimate objective, of handing full </p>
<p>sovereignty back to the Iraqi people, had no timing attached to it at all.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>104</p>
<p><b>590. </b> Ms Emma Sky, CPA Governorate Co-ordinator in Kirkuk from June 2003 to </p>
<p>February 2004, told the Inquiry that she had not been engaged in development of the </p>
<p>‘Vision for Iraq’ or ‘Achieving the Vision’:</p>
<p>“I recall … in September 2003 going down to Baghdad [for Mr Bremer’s monthly </p>
<p>meeting of commanders and Governorate Co-ordinators] … and there was a CPA </p>
<p>strategy that was, ‘This is what we are going to do’, but none of us had known about </p>
<p>it before, weren’t involved in the development of it.”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>591. </b> On 23 July, the DFID Office in Basra produced a ‘Review of the Humanitarian </p>
<p>Situation and DFID-Funded Operations in the Lower South Area of Iraq’.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> The Review, </p>
<p>which had been developed in consultation with CPA(South), the UK military, Iraqi </p>
<p>government bodies, UN agencies, the ICRC and NGOs, described itself as:</p>
<p>“…the first comprehensive operational monitoring exercise undertaken by DFID </p>
<p>in the lower South since the conflict.”</p>
<p><b>592. </b> In the Review, DFID concluded that the humanitarian phase of operations had </p>
<p>rapidly passed, although some elements of humanitarian vulnerability remained. </p>
<p>Despite continuing insecurity, a tendency by some agencies to over-assess and </p>
<p>under-implement, an over-emphasis on Basra at the expense of other provinces, </p>
<p>and poor co-ordination within the South and between the South and Baghdad, significant </p>
<p>progress had recently been made “in providing quick-fixes to immediate problems, and </p>
<p>in finally gearing up the … reconstruction process”.</p>
<p><b>593. </b> DFID assessed that the new CPA model – whereby CPA(Baghdad) would deal </p>
<p>directly with each governorate through CPA Governorate Teams (GTs), rather than </p>
<p>indirectly through CPA regional offices such as CPA(South) – was more consistent with </p>
<p>Iraq’s existing centralised model of government. CPA(South) would continue to exist, </p>
<p>but as a “regional hub” providing expertise to the four governorates, and without explicit </p>
<p>authority. DFID commented:</p>
<p>“Such a dramatic change in direction typifies the uncertain and ad hoc evolution of </p>
<p>the CPA … and whilst eminently sensible, poses an entirely new set of challenges </p>
<p>in terms of establishing and staffing … and ensuring that four offices rather than just </p>
<p>one receive adequate support and guidance from Baghdad.”</p>
<p><b>594. </b> Security remained the single most important factor in determining progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction. The security situation remained “at best fragile, at worst anarchic”, </p>
<p>fuelled by rising expectations, poor service provision and criminality. There had been </p>
<p>some improvements in recent weeks, including the deployment of small numbers of </p>
<p>Iraqi police onto the streets. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>595. </b> The Review also provided a detailed assessment of the state of health services, </p>
<p>nutrition and food distribution, water supply, sanitation, power, infrastructure, education </p>
<p>services, agriculture and livestock, Internally Displaced People (IDPs) and refugees, </p>
<p>mines and unexploded ordnance, public information, and co-ordination. </p>
<p><b>596. </b> On co-ordination in the South, DFID advised that the UN and CPA remained </p>
<p>“at arms length” leading to a dysfunctional approach in the South and no real leadership: </p>
<p>“The elements of an effective strategy are distributed among the players </p>
<p>and co-ordination is not yet sufficient to harness resources (primarily USAID </p>
<p>contractors), and experience (UN) under the current authority (CPA). </p>
<p>… </p>
<p>“The shadow of Baghdad looms over all co-ordination issues, with local solutions </p>
<p>regularly undermined by unilateral decisions or lack of direction from the centre.” </p>
<p><b>597. </b> DFID assessed that the decision to establish GTs had further undermined </p>
<p>CPA(South)’s ability to exert its authority. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that the Review was circulated to other </p>
<p>departments. </p>
<p><b>599. </b> Mr Sawers’ 28 July valedictory report from Baghdad offered a generally positive </p>
<p>assessment of progress in the three months since the invasion.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“The Coalition didn’t exactly help itself. The needs of the post-conflict planning never </p>
<p>received sufficient attention … We wasted not only the first month after Saddam fell, </p>
<p>but also the six months before that when we should have been planning realistically.” </p>
<p><b>600. </b> There was real progress on security, the political process and the economy </p>
<p>(salaries were being paid, food was being distributed, commerce on the street was lively, </p>
<p>and there was a strong commitment to economic reform backed by the World Bank and </p>
<p>the IMF). Although there was still a long way to go in all three areas: </p>
<p>“… the CPA under Jerry Bremer has plans in place on all fronts. ‘Drift’ isn’t a word in </p>
<p>his vocabulary. We may only be at the five mile mark in this marathon, but the route </p>
<p>ahead is mapped out, and the runners know what they have to do.”</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Sawers did not consider the progress in the South. </p>
<p><b>602. </b> Mr David Richmond succeeded Mr Sawers as the Prime Minister’s Special </p>
<p>Representative on Iraq on an interim basis, and remained in post until Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock arrived in September (see Section 9.2). Mr Richmond remained in Iraq </p>
<p>as Sir Jeremy’s deputy. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by telephone on 31 July.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> The conversation </p>
<p>turned to the media, and Mr Blair commented that better Iraqi media would make a </p>
<p>difference in achieving accurate reporting of events in Iraq. They agreed that if there </p>
<p>was no real improvement in a couple of weeks “top level US/UK media people” would </p>
<p>be asked to work up and implement a plan. </p>
<p><b>604. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft on 4 August to advise him that </p>
<p>MOD Ministers had agreed that an additional (130-strong) infantry company and a small </p>
<p>(30-strong) riverine capability were required in Iraq (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> The letter stated:</p>
<p>“Paradoxically we are having to deploy more personnel partly because our </p>
<p>reconstruction efforts are being successful (there is more worth securing and more </p>
<p>civil activity to safeguard).”</p>
<p><b>Sir Hilary Synnott arrives in Basra, 30 July</b></p>
<p><b>605. </b> Ambassador Olsen resigned as Head of CPA(South) on 28 July.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>606. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott arrived in Basra on 30 July.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>607. </b> At that time, the UK had approximately 100 officials seconded into the CPA, </p>
<p>including 30 in CPA(South) (see Section 15.1). </p>
<p><b>608. </b> Shortly before he deployed, Sir Hilary called on Mr Blair.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p> In his evidence to the </p>
<p>Inquiry, Sir Hilary recalled that during that meeting he had pointed out that he would have </p>
<p>no secure communications in Basra. The Inquiry has not seen a record of that meeting. </p>
<p><b>609. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that he had several Terms of Reference: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>formal Terms of Reference, agreed by Ambassador Bremer; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the British Government’s idea of what my responsibilities should be”, which </p>
<p>were not shown to Ambassador Bremer and related to keeping London </p>
<p>informed; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“some objectives” set personally by Mr Blair, which included the statement that </p>
<p>“if I had any difficulties at all, I should let him know personally”.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>610. </b> In his memoir, Sir Hilary described the first and second of those Terms of Reference:</p>
<p>“My mission statement … entailed giving ‘leadership and direction’ to the work of the </p>

<p>to the work of the military commanders in the South. I would be ‘accountable directly </p>
<p>to Ambassador Bremer’.</p>
<p>“But there was also a covering letter, marinated in subtleties. From a Whitehall </p>
<p>perspective, it read, despite [Ambassador] Bremer’s decision to create 18 Provincial </p>
<p>Co-ordinators who reported directly to him, ‘the UK Supremo in the South concept </p>
<p>still holds.’”</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>611. </b> The Inquiry has not seen that covering letter. </p>
<p><b>612. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I was always very clear with our people out there, ‘If you have got a real problem, </p>
<p>pick up the phone, if necessary, and if you start to get messed around with </p>
<p>bureaucracy, come to me directly’.” </p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>613. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that he did not take up Mr Blair’s offer to call him, but </p>
<p>said that his reporting telegrams were directed at No.10 and Ministers (rather than </p>
<p>middle-ranking officials).</p>
<p>337</p>
<p><b>614. </b> On his third day in Iraq, Sir Hilary called on Ambassador Bremer in Baghdad:</p>
<p>“… he [Bremer] didn’t give me any instructions, so I offered him three priorities, </p>
<p>which he agreed with. The first was I needed to find out what Baghdad’s priorities </p>
<p>were, which we didn’t know in the South. The second was to make sure that our </p>
<p>priorities … in the South were consistent with Baghdad’s priorities, and the third was </p>
<p>to change the location of where we worked, which was in every sense dangerous to </p>
<p>health, and for that I got tremendous support from Baghdad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ultimately, we continued really to have no direct</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>on from Baghdad, which was a pity </p>
<p>in one sense but a blessing in another, because unless I had an instruction not to do </p>
<p>something, I felt able to do whatever we were able to do.”</p>
<p>338 </p>
<p><b>615. </b> In his memoir, Sir Hilary wrote:</p>
<p>“I was particularly surprised and dismayed in my first encounters in Baghdad with </p>
<p>the lack of interest in the political and social situation in the four southern provinces, </p>
<p>and by Bremer’s declared intention to concentrate exclusively on Baghdad.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>616. </b> Sir Hilary reported his first impressions from Basra on 7 August.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> He wrote that </p>
<p>CPA(South) was not well thought of in the CPA. Mr Bearpark had told him that it was </p>
<p>the least effective of the CPA’s regional offices “by a long way”. Feelings in CPA(South) </p>
<p>about CPA(Baghdad) were equally negative. Sir Hilary assessed that much of the </p>
<p>problem stemmed from poor communication in both directions, leading to a high level </p>
<p>of mutual misunderstanding. </p>
<p><b>617. </b> In that context, Sir Hilary reported:</p>
<p>“I have no secure communication at all with Baghdad or London (both deficiencies </p>
<p>are now on their way to being rectified, although I may yet call for a push from </p>
<p>the FCO); e-mails are usually by means of free Yahoo or Hotmail ISPs; there are </p>
<p>no telephone landlines; mobile coverage is sketchy, which leaves a few sat[ellite] </p>
<p>phones. All of this should have improved by the end of the month.”</p>
<p><b>618. </b> Sir Hilary also reported that Ambassador Bremer had agreed his three “procedural </p>
<p>priorities”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to improve the information flow and consultation between Baghdad and Basra; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to set priorities for work in the South, in line with wider CPA objectives; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to upgrade living and working conditions in CPA(South).</p>
<p><b>619. </b> On the second point, Sir Hilary reported that he had agreed a proposal from </p>
<p>Major General Graeme Lamb, GOC MND(SE), to establish a Joint Co-ordination Board </p>
<p>comprising the UK Division, CPA(South) and the UN. The first meeting had revealed a </p>
<p>“heartening commonality of approach and attitude”.</p>
<p><b>620. </b> Sir Hilary wrote in his memoir that his arrival, along with the British military </p>
<p>command of MND(SE), established “some sort of British Fiefdom” in the South, but one </p>
<p>which he saw as “still entirely dependent on American resources for its lifeblood”.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that one major benefit of his appointment as Head of </p>
<p>CPA(South) was that he and Maj Gen Lamb were able to work “formally very close </p>
<p>together”, increasing their influence with the CPA and London.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> One difficulty was </p>
<p>the tendency of some UK Cabinet Ministers to make public statements about the UK’s </p>
<p>exemplary approach in the South, which overlooked CPA(South)’s dependence on US </p>
<p>financial resources: </p>
<p>“… I know that the Americans in Baghdad were pretty upset with this British … </p>
<p>boasting. As I was, because I was worried that this would freeze up the flow  </p>
<p>of resources.” </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>109</p>
<p><b>622. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Bearpark if the UK’s assumption of “lead responsibility” for </p>
<p>the South had given rise to an American assumption that the UK would provide a higher </p>
<p>level of financing for CPA(South) than it did.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> Mr Bearpark said that at a senior level the </p>
<p>US believed that the UK was making a “reasonable and fair contribution” in the South, </p>
<p>in terms of both personnel and funding. There was a problem, however, at the “middle </p>
<p>level”, which was exacerbated by repeated stories in the UK media that the US could </p>
<p>learn from the exemplary job that the UK was doing in the South:</p>
<p>“A result of that was that … there were certainly American officials within </p>
<p>CPA(Baghdad) who would say to me, ‘Look, why are you coming whinging at us yet </p>
<p>again … to try to get some resources for CPA(South)? You Brits know how to do it </p>
<p>so well, why don’t you fund it as well, if you are that clever about it?’”</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Mr Bearpark also told the Inquiry that, while in theory his responsibilities included </p>
<p>staffing, life support and the flow of funds to all CPA regional offices, in practice there </p>
<p>was “a big difference between CPA(South) … and the other CPA regional offices, </p>
<p>because CPA(South) was British and run in a particular way … as a British operation”.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I think we did a good job in the early stages in Basra. But we [the UK] were </p>
<p>very short of money, and we got virtually no American money because DFID </p>
<p>concentrated on that. The Americans said let the Brits look after Basra.”</p>
<p>345</p>
<p><b>Responding to deteriorating security</b></p>
<p><b>625. </b> Security in Iraq deteriorated in August 2003. Concerns about progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction in the South and the implications for the level of consent enjoyed by </p>
<p>UK forces led the UK to develop the Essential Services Plan, which aimed to improve </p>
<p>essential services rapidly and visibly. </p>
<p><b>626. </b> On 10 and 11 August, Basra experienced severe rioting.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> Mr Richmond reported: </p>
<p>“The immediate cause of the disturbances is clear. Supplies of petrol and diesel in </p>
<p>Basra’s service stations ran out on 9 August … This was combined with a major </p>
<p>blackout in Basra because of a failure in the transmission line which rippled through </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>110</p>
<p><b>627. </b> A Cabinet Office update for Ministers on 14 August reflected the same analysis: </p>
<p>“… the Basra demonstrations are evidence of increasing frustration with the </p>
<p>Coalition’s failure to restore basic services. Attacks on MND(SE) are widening.”</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott wrote in his memoir:</p>
<p>“… Riots erupted outside our Electricity Accounts building. Instead of just stones and </p>
<p>rocks, there was now gunfire … </p>
<p>… Within a day, however, the Army had stepped in to organise the fuel distribution </p>
<p>network … The violence subsided to a normal level as quickly as it had blown up.”</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>629. </b> Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Commitments), </p>
<p>advised the Chiefs of Staff on 18 August:</p>
<p>“Iraqi consent to the Coalition presence in MND(SE) is declining because supplies </p>
<p>of fuel, power and water are failing to meet expectations.”</p>
<p>349</p>
<p><b>630. </b> He reported that UK troops were being diverted to “fuel security” tasks; </p>
<p>19 Mechanised Brigade was now dedicating four patrols to fuel security tasks for </p>
<p>every one patrol to general security tasks. </p>
<p><b>631. </b> Lt Gen Fry identified three courses of action for the UK: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accelerate reconstruction by the CPA; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>step in to lead the reconstruction effort in MND(SE); or </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>step in temporarily to alleviate the situation, before handing over to the  </p>
<p>CPA/Iraqi ministries. </p>
<p><b>632. </b> Lt Gen Fry concluded that if an acceleration of the CPA’s reconstruction effort did </p>
<p>not check the deterioration, then a shift to the third course of action would be essential. </p>
<p><b>633. </b> The Chiefs of Staff meeting on 20 August agreed that the first course of action </p>
<p>should be pursued, although contingency planning should be undertaken for the third </p>
<p>course of action.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>634. </b> An update for the AHMGIR, produced on 20 August, advised that Basra was now </p>
<p>calmer, although that calm might be “short-lived if the Coalition cannot maintain at least </p>
<p>the current level of service delivery”.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> Security across MND(SE) remained volatile, and </p>
<p>security concerns had led to the withdrawal of Japanese staff in CPA(South).</p>

<p>111</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Concern over the apparent failure of the CPA’s plans to restore electricity prompted </p>
<p>Mr Richmond to commission Mr Nick Horne, a UK consultant working in the CPA, to </p>
<p>produce a report on electricity supply problems in the Basra area.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Horne’s report identified the immediate causes of the blackout across the Basra </p>
<p>area on 9 August, and made recommendations to address them.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> It also identified the </p>
<p>medium- and long-term measures required to accelerate restoration of a reliable supply </p>
<p>of electricity across Iraq.</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Mr Richmond sent copies of the report to the FCO, the MOD, DFID, the DTI and </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office on 20 August.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s electricity infrastructure suffered decades of neglect. Though little damaged </p>
<p>by the war, subsequent looting and sabotage have caused massive damage to </p>
<p>transmission lines. This goes some way to explain why electricity supplies have </p>
<p>been so unreliable. But Coalition plans to restore power to pre-war levels were  </p>
<p>not properly staffed, funded or implemented. Two or three months have been  </p>
<p>largely wasted.”</p>
<p><b>638. </b> Mr Richmond reported that the CPA’s electricity team was small (eight people, </p>
<p>of whom only three were specialists) and poorly managed. In contrast, a UN project in </p>
<p>northern Iraq employed 80 international experts and several thousand Iraqis to run a </p>
<p>small network that relied on a single hydro-electric power station. </p>
<p><b>639. </b> The CPA had been working to a plan to achieve pre-war levels of generation </p>
<p>(4,400MW) by the end of September. That plan comprised “a single sheet [of paper] </p>
<p>with no activities, timescales, parts requirements etc”. </p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Richmond suggested that the riots in Basra had drawn attention to the </p>
<p>CPA’s failure to meet electricity targets. Ambassador Bremer had been “horrified” by </p>
<p>Mr Horne’s report and had directed that a “proper plan” should be developed. A revised </p>
<p>plan to generate 4,400MW by the end of September had now been agreed; a plan to </p>
<p>generate 6,000MW (Iraq’s estimated need) by May 2004 was being developed. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Mr Richmond recommended that the UK should support this effort by providing </p>
<p>technical experts in a number of areas.</p>
<p><b>642. </b> Mr Richmond also reported that a major conference would take place at </p>
<p>CENTCOM Headquarters at the end of August to discuss electricity and oil.</p>
<p><b>643. </b> On 19 August, the UN Headquarters at the Canal Hotel, Baghdad, was bombed; </p>
<p>22 UN staff and visitors including Mr Vieira de Mello were killed (see Section 9.2).</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>112</p>
<p><b>644. </b> One member of DFID staff was slightly injured in the attack.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>645. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 28 August meeting of the AHMGIR reported that:</p>
<p>“World Bank and IMF Missions, which were working from the UN building, have </p>
<p>been withdrawn. A number of NGOs are withdrawing their international staff. The </p>
<p>ICRC is thinning out its staff. The UN is maintaining operations, but some staff </p>
<p>have been withdrawn from Baghdad temporarily while decisions on future security </p>
<p>arrangements are made.”</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>646. </b> The Annotated Agenda continued that, in the absence of some UN and NGO </p>
<p>international staff, and with additional constraints on remaining staff:</p>
<p>“… local staff should be able to continue to implement most existing humanitarian </p>
<p>and reconstruction programmes, including running the food distribution system, </p>
<p>at least in the short-term. However, there will be an immediate impact on new </p>
<p>programmes, which in many cases will not now go ahead.” </p>
<p><b>647. </b> A report into the incident commissioned by the UN recorded that, at the time of the </p>
<p>bombing, there were between 350 and 550 UN international staff in Baghdad.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> Although </p>
<p>most of those staff were withdrawn following the bombing, the UN Secretary-General </p>
<p>declined two recommendations from UN officials, on 2 and 22 September, to evacuate </p>
<p>all UN international staff from Iraq. By early October, there were between 20 and 30 UN </p>
<p>international staff in Baghdad and between 5 and 10 across the rest of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>648. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry: </p>
<p><i>“</i>After the attack … the Spanish and Japanese Governments ordered their civilians </p>
<p>to leave. And on 30 August, of course, the UN ordered their expatriates to leave </p>
<p>also. Everybody else stayed.” </p>
<p>358</p>
<p><b>649. </b> Mr Bearpark described the effect of the bombing in his evidence to the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… on that day, an enormous body of knowledge, wisdom and ability was lost.</p>
<p>“But the other factors were even more important than that. The first one was that, for </p>
<p>entirely understandable and probably correct reasons, the UN system … [including] </p>
<p>the World Bank and the IMF withdrew from Iraq. It is very difficult to overstate the </p>
<p>chaos that caused for the CPA, because all your interlocutors suddenly vanished … </p>
<p>“… that leads me on to the third factor .. which is that it recreated the animosity </p>
<p>within the CPA to the UN system … it did enable the UN-disliking elements of the </p>
<p>CPA to feel justified in their original behaviour, even though very slowly, carefully and </p>

<p>113</p>
<p>patiently during that period, June, July, August, the relationships had started coming </p>
<p>together very well.”</p>
<p>359</p>
<p><b>650. </b> The Cabinet Office advised Ministers on 21 August that, conscious of growing </p>
<p>public frustration in the South with living conditions and the underlying causes of </p>
<p>the riots earlier in the month, the UK was taking action both in CPA(South) and with </p>
<p>CPA(Baghdad) to improve the delivery of basic services.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p> CPA(South) and MND(SE) </p>
<p>were increasing fuel stocks, exploring ways to improve water supply, and working to </p>
<p>improve the electricity supply to the Basra oil refinery. </p>
<p><b>651. </b> There had been a series of meetings in CPA(Baghdad) on electricity and  </p>
<p>utilities. Ambassador Bremer had accepted “all recommendations related to the </p>
<p>electricity problem in the South” and authorised US$200m for immediate remedial work. </p>
<p>Electricity generation and transmission were to have top priority. The UK was seeking </p>
<p>further details.</p>
<p><b>652. </b> On the same day, Mr Benn met informally with Mr Dennis McShane, FCO Minister </p>
<p>for Europe, and Mr Adam Ingram, MOD Minister for Armed Forces.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p> The meeting </p>
<p>agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott needed “operations support”. DFID hoped to give Sir Hilary </p>
<p>delegated authority to spend UK funds when CPA(South) was fully staffed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A strong UK delegation should attend the CENTCOM infrastructure  </p>
<p>Conference the following week, which would produce a strategy for improving </p>
<p>Iraq’s infrastructure. In parallel, a team from engineering firm Mott MacDonald </p>
<p>would visit Basra to prepare shorter-term proposals to improve power supply in </p>
<p>the South.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Thereafter, the UK “should decide fast on remedial action”. That might require </p>
<p>more UK expenditure if the CPA could not respond fast enough. </p>
<p><b>653. </b> The Ministers directed officials to report to the 28 August meeting of the AHMGIR </p>
<p>on why so little of the funding allocated to CPA(South) had been spent.</p>
<p><b>654. </b> An MOD official produced an informal record of the meeting for MOD colleagues </p>
<p>only.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> He commented: </p>
<p>“DFID (Benn/[DFID junior official]) v[ery] helpful and forward leaning, going so far </p>
<p>as to identify fact that c. £30m of DFID allocation for Iraq remains unspent and that </p>
<p>perhaps now, and on utilities in the South, is the time and place to spend it … </p>
<p>“This prompted a sensible discussion (first I have heard at an Ad Hoc Group) of the </p>
<p>consequences of the CPA actually not delivering in the medium term in the South … </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>Again FCO line was that Synnott would sort it out. Min(AF) made the point about us </p>
<p>expecting a lot from one man …</p>
<p>“… there is no dispute that there is a problem, that something needs to be done and </p>
<p>that it may well involve spending money – this is a significant step forward … Most </p>
<p>significant appears to be [the] developing DFID thaw on [its] doctrinaire approach to </p>

<p><b>655. </b> The CENTCOM Iraqi Power Generation and Distribution Conference took place </p>
<p>in the US from 25 to 27 August.</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> The objective of the Conference was to develop a </p>
<p>practical response to the challenges in Iraq, and encourage co-ordination. </p>
<p><b>656. </b> The Inquiry has not seen a record of the Conference. </p>
<p><b>657. </b> The 27 August meeting of the Chiefs of Staff was advised that the estimated cost </p>
<p>of the third course of action identified by Lt Gen Fry on 18 August – that the UK should </p>
<p>step in to lead reconstruction in the South until the CPA could begin to deliver results – </p>
<p>was US$91m.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> A decision on whether to proceed would depend on the results of the </p>
<p>CENTCOM Conference. </p>
<p><b>658. </b> Mr Crompton advised Mr Straw in advance of the 28 August meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR:</p>
<p>“There is a head of steam within the MOD about the lack of progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction. As the military see it, the CPA in general, and CPA(South) in </p>
<p>particular, have failed to deliver. As a result, the Coalition is losing consent, the </p>
<p>military are having to take on tasks which should be undertaken by civilians, and </p>
<p>in the process the military are becoming over-stretched and vulnerable.”</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>659. </b> Mr Crompton offered four conclusions:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to maintain pressure on DFID to deliver quick results. Their approach </p>
<p>so far has been too theological … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Fixing these problems will require more staff (not less), particularly in the South. </p>
<p>Hilary Synnott … has just requested an additional 34 secondees to work on </p>
<p>reconstruction issues. He should get many of these.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Concerns about security argue against putting in more staff, but holding staff </p>
<p>back … will only compound the problem. The immediate solution is to strengthen </p>
<p>security measures in CPA(South) … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All of this is going to cost a lot of money. I am not sure we will be able to do all </p>
<p>we need to do within current budgets … The Treasury may have to look again </p>
<p>at the sums they are providing.”</p>

<p>115</p>
<p><b>660. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry that he requested 37 additional staff (“not </p>
<p>generalists but experts”) and 20 armoured vehicles.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>661. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 28 August meeting of the AHMGIR reported that the </p>
<p>situation in southern Iraq remained “volatile”.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> There was no evidence of a “significant </p>
<p>change in local consent to the UK-led military presence, but the time available before </p>
<p>dissatisfaction with the pace of CPA delivery of services overflows is shrinking”. </p>
<p><b>662. </b> Ministers agreed that, “subject to security concerns”: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Officials should consider and implement measures to improve the power </p>
<p>situation in south-eastern Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ministers should be advised on the impact on reconstruction of the withdrawal </p>
<p>of international staff and measures to mitigate the impact.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sir Hilary Synnott should be given “such assistance and staff as he deemed </p>
<p>necessary to improve the workings of CPA(South)”.</p>
<p>368</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>663. </b> Ministers were advised on 29 August that the MOD had commissioned and now </p>

<p>Bremer’s request to Congress</p>
<p>371</p>
<p>); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving utilities, most immediately electricity generation in the South;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving CPA media handling: a CPA media director (Mr Gary Thatcher, who </p>

<p><b>665. </b> Mr Blair wrote on Sir Nigel’s advice:</p>
<p>“This isn’t really working at present. I will have to reflect on how we progress …  </p>
<p>I need a meeting next week.”</p>
<p>373</p>
<p><b>666. </b> On 1 September, Sir Hilary sent two telegrams from Basra, in response to a </p>
<p>request from No.10 for an immediate report, in advance of the meeting requested by </p>
<p>Mr Blair, on what he needed. </p>
<p><b>667. </b> In the first telegram, Sir Hilary assessed that: </p>
<p>“The main immediate need is a vastly increased effort, well beyond the present </p>
<p>capabilities of CPA(South) or MND(SE), to provide visible improvements in the </p>
<p>provision of power, water and fuel in a short timescale.” </p>
<p>374</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>668. </b> Under his direction, CPA(South) and MND(SE) had developed an Emergency </p>
<p>Plan for Essential Services in Southern Iraq (the Essential Services Plan), costed at </p>
<p>US$127m. This would be discussed with DFID officials visiting Iraq and Mr Bearpark, </p>
<p>and then submitted to the AHMGIR for approval. However: </p>
<p>“More generally, the scale and nature of the problem is well beyond CPA(South)’s </p>
<p>present capabilities, if we are to truly act as an ‘Authority’ and provide direction  </p>
<p>to others. I have bid for more staff and ancillary back-up and will be bidding for  </p>
<p>more …” </p>
<p><b>669. </b> Sir Hilary reported that CPA(Baghdad) had “responded magnificently” to his </p>
<p>request to bring forward the move to safer and larger premises from mid-November to </p>
<p>mid-October but, until then, CPA(South) was unsafe and overcrowded, despite DFID </p>
<p>holding back staff from returning after their breaks and the withdrawal of the Japanese. </p>
<p><b>670. </b> Sir Hilary also reported that he had insufficient military protection vehicles to </p>
<p>carry out essential tasks, and that MND(SE) was proving “most unwilling to the point of </p>
<p>refusal, to dedicate more of their forces for this purpose”. </p>
<p><b>671. </b> Sir Hilary’s comments on the provision of secure accommodation and transport for </p>
<p>CPA(South) personnel are considered in Section 15.1.</p>
<p><b>672. </b> Sir Hilary’s second telegram contained a draft covering submission for the </p>
<p>Essential Services Plan.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> Sir Hilary advised that the Plan was based on work </p>
<p>undertaken by MND(SE) but had been “meshed with” a wider CPA(South) strategy for </p>
<p>the medium and long term. It was “formally” for CPA(Baghdad) to own and resource the </p>
<p>Plan “but that is not quite how things work in practice … there is a certain expectation </p>

<p> He advised that, </p>

<p>problem.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer had decided the answer was “simple: a massive injection </p>
<p>of funds to kick start the renewal of Iraq’s infrastructure”, and had bid to the US </p>
<p>Congress for up to US$18bn for that purpose. Whether or not Congress approved that </p>
<p>funding was likely to have a decisive impact on Iraq’s future. </p>
<p><b>675. </b> Mr Richmond commented that, while the UK could not match US spending power, </p>
<p>it would have to commit more financial and human resources, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more money for essential services, especially in the South; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing proper support and funding for the new UK staff in Iraq. Mr Richmond </p>

<p><b>684. </b> To ensure a co-ordinated approach, CPA(South) would chair an “Essential </p>
<p>Services Steering Group” made up of Iraqi Directors General, MND(SE), relevant UN </p>
<p>agency Heads, NGOs and other relevant agencies. The Plan would be directed, at least </p>
<p>initially, by the MND(SE) Chief Engineer on behalf of Sir Hilary Synnott, supported by the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>talking in terms of tens of billions of dollars; the UK needed to be thinking in terms of </p>
<p>much larger figures than it had to date, “hundreds of millions of pounds, if not more, plus </p>
<p>a significant increase in staffing in the South and Governorates”. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> UK staffing in CPA(Baghdad) was “about right”, but CPA(South) and the other CPA </p>
<p>regions were “woefully under-staffed”. The UK would have to staff CPA(South) itself. The </p>
<p>Government should try to meet all of Sir Hilary’s requests for additional staff. </p>
<p><b>692. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott described the genesis of the Essential Services Plan in his </p>
<p>memoir.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> In early August, the UK military, spurred by security concerns and “deeply </p>
<p>unimpressed” by the available civilian capability, had contracted Mott MacDonald to </p>
<p>design a package of quick-impact, carefully targeted infrastructure projects, without </p>
<p>consultation with CPA(South) or other partners. Sir Hilary commented that, while </p>
<p>understandable, “the furtive manner in which the [military’s] plan was conceived </p>
<p>amounted to a challenge to the civilian role in the South”. </p>
<p><b>693. </b> Once the military’s plan was completed, it could no longer be kept hidden. </p>
<p>Sir Hilary immediately realised that funding would have to come from CPA(Baghdad) or </p>
<p>London, and that they would provide funding only if the package was perceived to be </p>
<p>compatible with existing plans. He therefore convened a meeting between MND(SE) </p>
<p>and CPA(South) to develop a joint Essential Services Plan. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott also realised that the CPA’s contracting and accounting </p>
<p>procedures were unlikely to produce the funds within the necessary timescale and that </p>
<p>CPA(Baghdad) might baulk at providing additional funding for CPA(South), which it </p>
<p>regarded as a “side-show”. DFID would not normally provide such a large amount of </p>
<p>money. Sir Hilary therefore proposed that DFID should “kick-start” the project with a </p>
<p>contribution of £20m, and then the UK should press the CPA to provide the balance. </p>
<p>However, “if Baghdad proved obdurate, we could shame DFID into providing it”. </p>
<p><b>695. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Hilary said that the Essential Services Plan was </p>
<p>informed by his previous experience of reconstruction: </p>
<p>“When I went round Baghdad in the early days … the view I got from USAID and </p>
<p>others was that this place is broken … and we have let out contracts to big American </p>
<p>firms to put it all right. My heart sank at that point because … I knew how long big </p>
<p>projects took to get going, and I was also increasingly aware of the unpermissive </p>
<p>security environment. That reinforced me in my view that we should be going for </p>
<p>more of an emergency plan rather than big contracts, and I think, indeed, history </p>
<p>shows that virtually none of the big contracts ever came to fruition.”</p>

<p><b>696. </b> In early September, Ambassador Bremer published a “Seven Step Plan” for the </p>
<p>restoration of Iraqi sovereignty (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> The Plan did not include a timescale, </p>
<p>although to most observers it appeared to mean at least a two-year Occupation. </p>
<p><b>697. </b> On 5 September, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note from Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush ahead of their video conference later that day.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>698. </b> In the Note, Mr Blair proposed doubling the number of Iraqi police and speeding </p>
<p>up the process of letting reconstruction contracts. In the South, he had “authorised” the </p>
<p>CPA to “just spend the money and recoup later from CPA(Centre)”. Mr Blair expressed </p>
<p>support for Ambassador Bremer, and queried whether he had all the administrative and </p>
<p>technical support he needed. </p>
<p><b>699. </b> On the media, Mr Blair wrote: </p>
<p>“Media: My obsession. I understand that Gary Thatcher is making a big difference. </p>
<p>But there are five terrestrial channels to fill … apparently, there is a fear that bringing </p>
<p>in outside i.e. US/UK networks would be a problem for the Governing Council. </p>
<p>That’s a pity, if true. Because the obvious solution is for us … to task one of the </p>
<p>big companies to sort it out. We need this fast. It is essential to keep building Iraqi </p>
<p>consent and understanding.”</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>700. </b> Mr Blair concluded: </p>
<p>“So my basic point is: the problem is not complex to identify: it is security. The best </p>
<p>solution is not us or at least us alone but the Iraqis. It is speed in building their </p>
<p>capacity – security, intelligence, infrastructure, media – that we need.” </p>
<p><b>701. </b> Mr Cannon reported to Mr Straw’s Private Office on 5 September that, during the </p>
<p>video conference, Mr Blair had recommended to President Bush that “a new impetus </p>
<p>should be given to infrastructure reconstruction, both short-term and longer-term </p>
<p>projects”, and had expressed concern that there were problems in transferring funds for </p>
<p>infrastructure projects from CPA(Baghdad) to CPA(South).</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> Mr Blair had also asked </p>
<p>whether Ambassador Bremer needed more administrative/technical support, including </p>

<p>UK had contributed US$30m to the US$127m Essential Services Plan; the balance </p>
<p>would come from the CPA. No other UK actions were identified. </p>
<p><b>705. </b> On the media, the objective was to counter distorted reporting by Al Jazeera and </p>
<p>other satellite channels. The UK would provide support to the Iraqi Media Network, the </p>
<p>CPA, and for the longer-term development of indigenous Iraqi media.</p>
<p><b>706. </b> On CPA personnel, the objective was to provide more specialist support for the </p>
<p>CPA in Baghdad and the provinces. The UK was recruiting 37 specialists for CPA(South) </p>
<p>and would provide more “as requested”, had selected four individuals to head CPA </p>
<p>Governorate Teams, and would provide additional information and SSR specialists for </p>
<p>CPA(Baghdad). </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>123</p>
<p><b>711. </b> Treasury officials advised Mr Brown on 5 September that pressure was building </p>
<p>for significant, additional UK contributions to reconstruction and security in Iraq, both </p>
<p>from international partners and from within Whitehall.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> That pressure was generated </p>
<p>by emerging reports on the substantial size of Iraq’s financing gap for 2004 (now </p>
<p>estimated at between US$1bn and, according to new figures from the CPA, US$20bn) </p>
<p>and Mr Blair’s emphasis on the need to deliver tangible and rapid progress through both </p>
<p>additional military resources and reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>712. </b> Treasury officials advised that DFID were developing a case for a substantial UK </p>
<p>contribution to meeting the financing gap, which could be announced at the forthcoming </p>
<p>Madrid Donors Conference. The US had approached the FCO to ascertain the UK’s </p>
<p>position on additional financing for reconstruction, and discussions were beginning </p>
<p>between international development ministries. </p>
<p><b>713. </b> Treasury officials commented:</p>
<p>“There is a growing and costly perception in Whitehall (and potentially parts of the </p>
<p>CPA and the US Administration) that if the UK wants to pull its weight, it should cover </p>
<p>10% of all costs … In purely fiscal terms we cannot afford a contribution of this size </p>
<p>without a very substantial re-prioritisation of existing spending allocations … </p>
<p>“ … [Sir] Jeremy Greenstock, UK Special Representative in Iraq [sic], has hinted </p>
<p>that if we want to influence the outcome in Iraq and in particular the decision-making </p>
<p>process at the centre of the CPA, we have to buy our way in. We refute this. Our </p>
<p>military contribution was crucial to the success of the initial operation … and our </p>
<p>ability to influence through political leverage should not be diminished significantly. </p>
<p>“The main cause of agitation in the South, and in turn pressure on the UK to </p>
<p>increase troop levels and to contribute additional resources, is the fact that </p>
<p>resources are not arriving quick enough from CPA(Centre) to CPA(South). There </p>
<p>is a danger that this is because the US controls CPA(Centre) and are allocating </p>
<p>resources to their priority areas and are squeezing the areas where they perceive </p>
<p>the UK to lead. This backs up the view that we do not have enough influence in </p>
<p>CPA(Centre).” </p>
<p><b>714. </b> Treasury officials also advised that they were increasingly concerned over the </p>
<p>lack of a “comprehensive, long-term strategy” for Iraq, which led to continued ad hoc </p>
<p>spending. DFID’s recent decision to provide £20m to fund the Essential Services Plan </p>
<p>was an example of this. The decision left the UK exposed to providing further funding if </p>
<p>CPA resources remained inaccessible and/or costs escalated. The UK should continue </p>
<p>to push for CPA(Baghdad) to mobilise resources for use in the South rather than taking </p>
<p>on more of the burden itself.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>124</p>
<p><b>715. </b> Mr Chaplin advised Sir Michael Jay on 9 September that the ideal way to  </p>
<p>meet Ministers’ demands for quicker results in Iraq would be to put the new DFID  </p>
<p>Iraq Directorate into an FCO-based structure.</p>
<p>394</p>
<p> There was, however, very little chance </p>
<p>of DFID agreeing to that. The “next best thing” would be an enhanced FCO unit and </p>
<p>strengthened liaison with other Whitehall departments. The FCO would have to  </p>
<p>“rely on the Sheinwald group [the Iraq Strategy Group] to crack the whip over DFID </p>
<p>when necessary”. </p>
<p><b>716. </b> Later that day, Mr Straw approved the creation of a new FCO Iraq Directorate </p>
<p>as the inter-departmental body responsible for co-ordinating the growing volume of </p>
<p>Iraq-related work across Whitehall. The Directorate is described in more detail later </p>
<p>in this Section. </p>
<p><b>717. </b> Baroness Amos wrote to Mr Boateng on 10 September to request £6.5m from the </p>
<p>Reserve to cover immediate further needs in Iraq, and that a further £33.5m should be </p>
<p>“ear-marked” for anticipated requirements later in the financial year.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> Baroness Amos </p>
<p>stated that DFID’s budget for Iraq for 2003/04 was now fully committed. Of the £33.5m, </p>
<p>£20m could be required for a further contribution to the Essential Services Plan if US </p>
<p>funding proved insufficient. </p>
<p><b>718. </b> Baroness Amos wrote to Mr Blair the following day to advise that DFID’s immediate </p>
<p>operational priorities were to ensure that the Essential Services Plan was fully funded </p>
<p>and to help the UN return to Iraq.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> On the former, Baroness Amos advised: </p>
<p>“… our overall approach has been predicated on CPA delivering more than it  </p>
<p>has, and we have had negligible influence on them, or the Pentagon, to try and  </p>
<p>turn it around. Immediate measures are now needed to maintain the Iraqi </p>
<p>population’s consent.” </p>
<p><b>719. </b> The Essential Services Plan would help to improve essential services, but solving </p>
<p>the underlying problems in infrastructure would require billions of dollars and an Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to determine policy. Systemic problems within the CPA continued to delay </p>
<p>the transfer of promised CPA resources to the South. Baroness Amos concluded:</p>

<p>priorities were “self-evident”: robust macro-economic policy planning and budget </p>
<p>management; reform of the public service; encouragement of civil society; and </p>
<p>facilitation of private investment. Specific activities would be informed by sectoral </p>
<p>assessments being undertaken by the World Bank, the IMF and UN agencies. As a </p>

<p><b>722. </b> On 16 September, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Baroness Amos agreed that officials </p>

<p><b>723. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott reported to the IPU on 17 September that, setting aside </p>
<p>difficulties securing CPA funding for the Essential Services Plan, sources of funding </p>
<p>for CPA(South), including the US Commanders Emergency Response Program </p>
<p>(CERPs), were “starting to be unblocked” in Baghdad.</p>
<p>398</p>
<p> Progress was largely because </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>725. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that the US had decided to establish a Program </p>

<p>response to the persistent problems in transferring funds from CPA(Baghdad) and CPA </p>
<p>regional offices, however: </p>
<p>“Our initial response is sceptical: the PMO will manage predominantly US  </p>
<p>funds, which will require US contracting and procurement procedures to be followed. </p>
<p>The prospect of developing Iraqi capacity, and of opening up contracts to include  </p>
<p>UK companies (in the interests of effectiveness and value for money) remains </p>

<p>would need to be approached. </p>
<p><b>730. </b> Ministers asked officials to consider the UK’s involvement in the PMO further. </p>

<p>In contrast, my organisation’s position was not … If we were to travel to meet Iraqis </p>
<p>and visit the other provinces … our staff now needed to be escorted by military </p>
<p>vehicles …</p>
<p>“From then on, we had a steady and reliable system of escorts. They were inevitably </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>734. </b> Gen Jackson called on Baroness Amos on 18 September. </p>
<p><b>735. </b> Baroness Amos’ briefing for the meeting advised that, while the relationship </p>
<p>between the military and DFID was “strengthening”, there had been a number of </p>
<p>misunderstandings, many of which stemmed from the difference in approach between </p>
<p>the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) and DFID:</p>
<p>“… the military could draw on ODA financing in support of UK political (and thus </p>
<p>military) objectives. The International Development Act now ties DFID down to much </p>
<p>more stringent conditions for funds disbursement …”</p>
<p>403</p>
<p><b>736. </b> The briefing warned that Gen Jackson might draw unfavourable comparisons </p>
<p>between the UK’s reconstruction effort in Kosovo and Iraq: </p>
<p>“Without the CPA delivering … There is a reasoned argument that HMG should  </p>
<p>have planned to support its military effort with a civilian ‘colonial’ effort, and </p>
<p>[Gen] Jackson may be of the view that DFID should have mounted a bilateral UK </p>
<p>operation similar to Kosovo, carrying out immediate infrastructure work, repairing </p>
<p>schools, hospitals and so on. Not only was this not the strategy adopted by </p>
<p>HMG [Her Majesty’s Government], but a similar DFID effort would not have been </p>
<p>possible. Kosovo’s size, population, level of local consent, and interim governance </p>
<p>arrangements were entirely different. A wider ‘colonial’ role is neither DFID’s role nor </p>
<p>our comparative advantage.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>737. </b> During the meeting, Gen Jackson said that the International Development Act (IDA) </p>
<p>had created “conceptual and procedural difficulties which worked against a centralised </p>
<p>HMG effort”.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>738. </b> Baroness Amos responded that, while the IDA had changed the way that  </p>
<p>DFID worked, it was still able to work with the military effectively. There was a need to </p>
<p>prepare and plan better for post-conflict reconstruction “particularly in the very fragile </p>
<p>transition stage”.</p>
<p><b>739. </b> Baroness Amos continued:</p>
<p>“We had all been failed by the CPA … HMG’s decision to put so much faith in the </p>
<p>CPA was compounded by our failure to understand the US way of doing things … </p>
<p>DFID’s £20m infrastructure project in the South in expectation of a further and </p>
<p>larger funding allocation for infrastructure from CPA(Baghdad) was moving in the </p>
<p>right direction – but we could not be complacent and had to make contingency </p>
<p>arrangements in case CPA funding did not come through.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>128</p>
<p><b>740. </b> Mr Benn and Mr Chakrabarti visited Iraq from 17 to 19 September.</p>
<p>405</p>
<p> On his return, </p>
<p>Mr Benn wrote to Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“Security remains <i>the</i> concern. Provided we get this right alongside the politics, </p>
<p>reconstructing Iraq is possible … The Iraqis need to be helped to take charge. We </p>
<p>need to support them … and to persuade the Americans (who hold very fixed views) </p>
<p>that this is both desirable and feasible.</p>
<p>“Improving life for ordinary Iraqis is the main priority. Electricity, water and jobs </p>
<p>will maintain consent and therefore security. It is in the South that the UK can, </p>
<p>and must, deliver. Expectations are high. There is progress now on the Essential </p>
<p>Services Project … and we are working on the right issues in the very short term – </p>
<p>infrastructure, policing, and improving information to Iraqis … In the medium term  </p>
<p>we should focus our support on helping key Iraqi ministries rather than </p>
<p>CPA(Baghdad). Long term, we need to think about how we organise ourselves for </p>
<p>this kind of operation. </p>
<p>“We have to recognise that our influence is limited with the CPA and Bremer, </p>
<p>although the UK presence there, and in particular Jeremy Greenstock’s role in </p>
<p>Baghdad, is vital in staying alongside both. Therefore it’s what we can do in the </p>
<p>South that should occupy our practical, as opposed to our diplomatic, efforts.</p>
<p>“We are still not getting our achievements across back in the UK … </p>
<p>“We must now turn our attention to the Madrid Donors Conference. We made </p>
<p>the point forcefully to Bremer, and encouragingly to the Iraqis, that the Governing </p>
<p>Council and the Minister of Finance should be on the top table … We will need to </p>
<p>lobby other donors hard, and have a credible pledge to make ourselves … </p>
<p>“One major concern is the continuing problem with setting up the Independent </p>
<p>Advisory and Monitoring Board for the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI). Bremer </p>
<p>seems unconcerned, but it is going to make it very hard to get countries to put </p>
<p>money in if the international guardian of the DFI can’t start work. It’s embarrassing, </p>
<p>and someone will have to tell Bremer to sort it out, because he won’t do so on his </p>
<p>own. In the light of the Conference, and our own pledge, we can then consider the </p>
<p>next stage of the UK reconstruction effort.</p>
<p>“As we reflect on the Iraq experience, we do need to think about how HMG is geared </p>
<p>up to respond to the reconstruction phase of such operations. We are beginning to </p>
<p>do some thinking on this, but we need to learn lessons for the future.”</p>
<p><b>741. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott reported from Basra on 22 September that, while in Basra, </p>
<p>Mr Benn and Mr Chakrabarti had agreed “extraordinary procedures” for the </p>
<p>disbursement of DFID’s £20m contribution to the Essential Services Plan, which meant </p>

<p>129</p>
<p>that DFID’s funds should be available that day.</p>
<p>406</p>
<p> Implementation of the Plan would start </p>
<p>at once. Sir Hilary reported: </p>
<p>“In front of the Minister [Mr Benn], Gen Lamb instructed his staff that the pins were </p>
<p>to be removed from the DFID doll.”</p>
<p><b>742. </b> Two days later, in the context of an update of developments in Baghdad, Sir </p>
<p>Jeremy Greenstock, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq, reported:</p>
<p>“London will hate me for saying this, but it is something keenly felt by the best </p>
<p>senior people in our military … the UK has not yet put the intensity of resources into </p>
<p>the civilian side of our operation, in terms of both personnel and project money, to </p>
<p>convince the Americans that our analysis … has to be listened to. If we watch our </p>
<p>housekeeping too carefully in this respect, we may be forced down the wrong road </p>
<p>… I shall have to come back to this quite soon.”</p>
<p>407</p>
<p><b>743. </b> A Treasury official provided advice to Mr Boateng on 18 September on  </p>
<p>how the Treasury intended to deal with the expected surge in Iraq-related claims on  </p>
<p>the Reserve.</p>
<p>408</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>744. </b> Departments had seen Mr Blair’s call for a step-change in the UK effort in Iraq </p>
<p>(on 3 June) as “a legitimate invitation” to bid for more resources. Departments were </p>
<p>developing or considering seven bids. The largest of those was a bid being prepared </p>
<p>by DFID for around £250m, as the UK’s additional contribution to Iraq’s reconstruction. </p>
<p>The UK would need to make a pledge at the forthcoming Madrid Donors Conference. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> The official advised that it was vitally important to maintain pressure on </p>
<p>departments, both at Ministerial and official level, not to submit claims in the first </p>
<p>place. The Treasury would also continue to push for greater co-ordination between </p>
<p>departments in funding Iraq programmes. </p>
<p><b>746. </b> Treasury officials had concluded that the best course of action in the short-term </p>
<p>would be to continue to scrutinise claims on a case-by-case basis, in terms of value-</p>
<p>for-money, impact, robustness of the costing, and robustness of the risk management. </p>
<p>Departments would also have to provide “clear evidence” on the extent to which they </p>
<p>had reprioritised their existing resources to accommodate Iraq. </p>
<p><b>747. </b> The availability of CPA funding was key. Some officials in CPA(South) had </p>
<p>stated that it was easier to secure funding from London than from CPA(Baghdad). The </p>
<p>Treasury should therefore continue to push for CPA(Baghdad) to fund initiatives in the </p>
<p>South, rather than providing a significant increase in UK funding, which could create </p>

<p>“expenditure overlaps” and alleviate the pressure on CPA(Baghdad) to resolve the </p>
<p>problem of transferring resources to the regions. </p>
<p><b>748. </b> Mr Boateng replied to Baroness Amos’ request for £40m from the Reserve on </p>
<p>25 September.</p>
<p>409</p>
<p> He agreed to provide an additional £6.5m from the Reserve to cover </p>
<p>immediate further needs in Iraq, but rejected the request to earmark £33.5m for DFID’s </p>
<p>anticipated future needs, citing “recent reports that … [US] sources of funding are now </p>
<p>starting to be unblocked”. </p>
<p><b>749. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Suma Chakrabarti suggested that the exchange </p>
<p>had not occurred in isolation:</p>
<p>“We had discussions [with] the Treasury but it was quite obvious to us that they </p>
<p>weren’t going to give any more than they already had … They had put some money </p>
<p>in upfront [in late March 2003, for humanitarian assistance], but, after that, they said </p>
<p>it is time to reprioritise.”</p>
<p>410</p>
<p><b>750. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson, Director General in charge of Public Expenditure from </p>
<p>2001 to 2005 and then Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, told the Inquiry that, </p>
<p>although it was “totally open” to Baroness Amos to challenge that response, she did </p>
<p>not.</p>
<p>411</p>
<p> He pointed out that the US$100m announced by Mr Brown in his 9 April budget </p>
<p>statement was never fully claimed by departments. </p>
<p><b>751. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 16 September, Mr Blair commented </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Staffing the CPA and new structures in London</b></p>
<p><b>755. </b> The FCO sent an update on UK staffing in the CPA to Sir Nigel Sheinwald on </p>
<p>9 September.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> Staffing in CPA(Baghdad) was “about right”, at 60 secondees. A major </p>
<p>rotation of staff over the next two months would be an opportunity to increase the </p>
<p>UK’s focus on “Ministerially-agreed priorities of Governance, Security Sector Reform, </p>
<p>Reconstruction and the Economic/Oil Ministries”. There might also be a requirement to </p>
<p>place a few additional staff in the CPA’s Information Directorate. </p>
<p><b>756. </b> The FCO’s priority was staffing CPA(South) and the Governorate Teams. The </p>
<p>37 specialists for CPA (South) requested by Sir Hilary Synnott would be sourced through </p>
<p>a DFID consultancy contract. The aim was to have them ready to deploy by mid-October. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> Heads had been selected for the four UK-led Governorate Teams (Basra and </p>
<p>Dhi Qar in the south, Wasit in central Iraq, and Kirkuk in the north). The first, Mr John </p>
<p>Bourne, had deployed to Baghdad for a familiarisation briefing before taking up post </p>
<p>in Dhi Qar (Nasiriyah). The other three would follow later in the month. The FCO had </p>
<p>planned to fill just four slots in each team, but it was clear that “the CPA bank of staff is </p>
<p>dry and that we should plan on filling our Governorates ourselves”. The objective was to </p>
<p>have all staff in place by the end of September. </p>
<p><b>758. </b> The remaining three Governorate Co-ordinators deployed to Iraq by the UK were:</p>

<p>420</p>

<p>overwhelmed by the scale of their responsibilities”.</p>
<p>424</p>

<p><b>First cross-Whitehall Strategy for Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>768. </b> A draft ‘UK Iraq Strategy’ was circulated to members of the AHMGIR for comment </p>
<p>on 26 September.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>769. </b> The final version was issued to members of the AHMGIR by the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>on 8 October after “those Private Offices who responded indicated their Ministers’ </p>
<p>endorsement”. </p>
<p><b>770. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald annotated his copy: “I don’t see a need for PM [Mr Blair] </p>
<p>to see this”.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>771. </b> The Strategy acknowledged the CPA Strategy published in July 2003 and </p>
<p>stated that this was a longer-term UK Strategy for Iraq that was broadly consistent </p>
<p>with the CPA Strategy, but which set the framework for specific UK activities towards </p>
<p>a common objective.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p><b>772. </b> The Strategy identified the UK objective as:</p>
<p>“Iraq to become a stable, united and law-abiding state, within its present borders, </p>
<p>co-operating within the international community, no longer posing a threat to its </p>
<p>neighbours or to international security, abiding by all its international obligations and </p>
<p>providing effective representative government, sustainable economic growth and </p>
<p>rising living standards to its entire people.” </p>
<p><b>773. </b> The Strategy stated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Successful reconstruction required the “widest possible” international support. </p>
<p>Getting the UN and IFIs engaged would increase the chances of securing that </p>
<p>support.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had far greater resources than the UK, but UK influence over US policy </p>
<p>was limited and the UK’s approach would be “vulnerable to shifts in US thinking”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was active at a national level, but UK assets were concentrated in the </p>
<p>South where the UK was most exposed to the consequences of failure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were few quick fixes for essential services. Improvement would </p>
<p>require multi-year projects “even beyond the scope of the CPA if it receives </p>
<p>US$20bn from Congress”. Nevertheless, the UK needed to demonstrate </p>
<p>some visible progress in improving living standards in order to maintain local </p>
<p>consent. For the UK in CPA(South), that would require more funding and more </p>
<p>skilled personnel.</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>135</p>
<p><b>774. </b> The Strategy stated that “to help planning”, Iraq’s recovery should be considered </p>
<p>in three phases: stabilisation, to December 2003; recovery, to December 2004; and </p>
<p>normalisation, from January 2005. The Strategy defined “UK objectives” for each phase </p>
<p>in relation to security, the political process and reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>775. </b> The UK’s over-arching reconstruction objective for the stabilisation phase  </p>
<p>(to December 2003) was that Iraq would reach pre-conflict levels of “development  </p>
<p>and order”. </p>
<p><b>776. </b> The objective for the recovery phase, to December 2004, was that Iraq </p>
<p>would exceed pre-conflict levels of development and order, and plans would be </p>
<p>being implemented to develop Iraq’s own capacity to lead economic and physical </p>
<p>reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>777. </b> The objective for the normalisation phase, from January 2005, was that Iraq </p>
<p>would be “largely self-supporting”, providing its own public services and with a growing </p>
<p>market-based economy. </p>
<p><b>778. </b> The Strategy acknowledged that this scenario was “ambitious”. Risks to progress </p>
<p>included resistance to the Coalition and slow progress on the political process and </p>
<p>reconstruction. A protracted occupation would be costly, increase anti-Western sentiment </p>
<p>across the region and provide further reason for terrorist attacks in US and UK interests. </p>
<p><b>779. </b> The UK would continue to be active in a number of areas but would, as Ministers </p>
<p>had directed, focus its engagement on economic management, SSR and oil. An Action </p>
<p>Plan covering the stabilisation phase was being developed. </p>
<p><b>780. </b> On resources, the Strategy stated that the UK military occupation force would cost </p>
<p>around £1bn in 2003/04 (and less in future years). The DFID programme for 2003/04 </p>
<p>was £201m and was fully committed. Of the £60m provided by the Treasury in April, the </p>
<p>FCO had been allocated £21m to cover CPA staff and security costs, and DFID had bid </p>
<p>for the remaining £40m.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>781. </b> Looking ahead, the Strategy stated that departments’ bids for funding for Iraq for </p>
<p>2004/05 would be subject to negotiation with the Treasury. An “appropriate” level of UK </p>
<p>contribution to reconstruction and development was being considered in the light of </p>
<p>Iraq’s needs, Iraqi and international contributions, and the UK’s resource position. </p>
<p><b>782. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that the UK Strategy was:</p>
<p>“Very important, but quite high-flown sort of stuff and not really linked to operational </p>
<p>detail.”</p>
<p>432</p>
<p>431 </p>
<p>The Treasury had agreed on 25 September to provide DFID with an additional £6.5m from the Reserve, </p>
<p>but rejected its request to earmark £33.5m for anticipated future needs. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>783. </b> Sir Suma added that, as the UK Strategy did not satisfy DFID’s need for </p>
<p>operational detail, DFID produced its own strategy (the Interim Country Assistance Plan) </p>
<p>at the beginning of 2004. </p>
<p><b>Lobbying for a level playing field for UK businesses</b></p>
<p><b>784. </b> The UK Government continued to lobby the US and the CPA for a level playing </p>
<p>field for UK companies bidding for CPA contracts in Iraq (see Section 10.3). </p>
<p><b>785. </b> Trade Partners UK (TPUK), the division of British Trade International (BTI) </p>
<p>responsible for promoting UK exports, produced an update on commercial issues on </p>
<p>Iraq for Mr Blair on 10 October.</p>
<p>433</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>786. </b> TPUK advised that their strategy was:</p>
<p>“… to position UK firms as best we can through the provision of information about </p>
<p>contacts, procurements issues, etc, and to press the US authorities (and the CPA) </p>
<p>to ensure a level playing field on which UK companies can compete.” </p>
<p><b>787. </b> In response, the US had made it clear that, while it welcomed the participation of </p>
<p>UK companies, there was “no ‘special deal’”. </p>
<p><b>788. </b> The update concluded that UK firms were doing “quite well” given that most of the </p>
<p>work so far had been US-funded. </p>
<p><b>789. </b> UK Government lobbying on behalf of UK business intensified in early 2004, in </p>
<p>anticipation of the contracts that would flow from the additional funding for reconstruction </p>
<p>requested by the CPA and against a background of growing press and Parliamentary </p>
<p>criticism that UK companies were at a disadvantage in bidding for US-funded contracts. </p>
<p><b>Madrid Donors Conference, 23 and 24 October 2003</b></p>
<p><b>790. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 2 October meeting of the AHMGIR stated that the </p>
<p>UK’s primary objective for the Madrid Donors Conference, which would be held on  </p>
<p>23 and 24 October, was to broaden international support for reconstruction in Iraq and </p>
<p>secure the necessary funding for it.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> The Conference should also: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrate international support for Iraqi proposals for political and economic </p>
<p>progress;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognise the Governing Council and Ministers as the principal interlocutors for </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>agree finance for Iraq’s reconstruction, preferably using the Multi-Donor Trust </p>
<p>Fund; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>note the Paris Club process for addressing Iraq’s external debt problems.</p>
<p><b>791. </b> The Annotated Agenda stated that many donors felt excluded from the Madrid </p>
<p>process, “disaffected by the lack of a clear political process and disinclined to pledge </p>
<p>before it is sorted out”. There were a number of issues to resolve before UK objectives </p>
<p>could be achieved:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarity on financing needs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear timetable to Iraqi sovereignty;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear financing mechanism; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreement on the role of the IAMB;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>engaging IFIs and “quality donors” to ensure reconstruction was effective;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a more inclusive approach to managing the Conference; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a credible UK pledge to leverage others. </p>
<p><b>792. </b> If the Conference did not deliver the necessary international support, the US might </p>
<p>need to fund “the major requirements for 2004 with limited help from Coalition partners, </p>
<p>including the UK”. </p>
<p><b>793. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that Ministers and Mr Blair should lobby their counterparts </p>
<p>on the lines proposed.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p><b>794. </b> The AHMGIR also agreed that the CPA should be funding projects in CPA(South). </p>
<p>UK funding was small compared with US funding, and the Reserve was already under </p>
<p>pressure.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>795. </b> The UN and World Bank presented the main findings of their Joint Needs </p>
<p>Assessment (JNA) to the Conference’s Core Group (the United Arab Emirates, the US, </p>
<p>the EU and Japan) on the same day.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> The JNA estimated that Iraq’s “overall stock of </p>
<p>reconstruction needs” over the period 2004 to 2007 was US$36bn. In addition, the CPA </p>
<p>had estimated that US$20bn was needed in critical sectors not covered by the JNA, </p>
<p>including security and oil. Iraqi oil and tax revenues and private sector financing would </p>
<p>reduce the need for external financing.</p>
<p><b>796. </b> Baroness Amos wrote to Mr Boateng on 3 October, to propose that DFID could </p>
<p>provide up to £130m from its core budget for financial years 2004/05 and 2005/06, as </p>
<p>part of a UK pledge at Madrid.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> That figure included £70m from DFID’s contingency </p>
<p>reserve, £50m from funds reallocated from other middle-income countries, and the </p>
<p>existing planned provision for Iraq. </p>

<p><b>797. </b> Baroness Amos advised that this contribution reflected Iraq’s needs and DFID’s </p>
<p>commitments, including its commitment to increase the proportion of bilateral spend </p>
<p>allocated to low-income countries to 90 percent by 2005/06 and to establish a </p>
<p>£1bn assistance programme for Africa by 2005/06. </p>
<p><b>798. </b> Baroness Amos also advised that a “significant” amount of the pledge should be </p>
<p>allocated to the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, which would focus on the social sectors and </p>
<p>encourage similar contributions from other donors. </p>
<p><b>799. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Brown later that day that DFID could probably </p>
<p>find £390m from its existing resources, and the Global Conflict Prevention Pool </p>
<p>(GCPP) a further £30m, giving a UK pledge of £420m for 2004/05 and 2005/06.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> She </p>
<p>recommended that the Treasury push DFID hard to find more from its existing resources. </p>
<p><b>800. </b> No.10 responded to Baroness Amos’s letter to Mr Boateng on 4 October.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft said that Mr Blair: </p>
<p>“… would like the UK to play a leading role within the international community </p>
<p>in this area. So he thinks that the UK pledge should be significantly larger than </p>
<p>Departments appear to be contemplating, in the order of £500m. This will need </p>
<p>to include genuinely new money, not the result of creative accounting.” </p>
<p><b>801. </b> The JNA was published on 9 October.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>809. </b> The UN Security Council adopted resolution 1511 on 16 October (see </p>
<p>Section 9.2).</p>
<p>447</p>
<p> The resolution urged Member States and international and regional </p>
<p>organisations to support Iraq’s reconstruction, including by making substantial pledges </p>
<p>at the Madrid Donors Conference. </p>
<p><b>810. </b> The IAMB was formally established on 24 October.</p>
<p>448</p>
<p> It would not hold its first </p>
<p>meeting until early December. </p>
<p><b>811. </b> Representatives from 73 countries, 20 international organisations and </p>
<p>13 non-governmental organisations and associations attended the Madrid Donors </p>
<p>Conference on 23 and 24 October.</p>
<p>449</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>812. </b> Donors pledged a total of between US$32.2bn and US$35.9bn, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US, the largest contributor, pledged US$18.649bn.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Japan pledged US$4.914bn, US$1.414bn on grant terms and up to </p>
<p>US$3.5bn on concessional loan terms, with the amount dependent on </p>
<p>security, political progress and progress on reconstruction and resolution of </p>
<p>Iraq’s debt issue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The World Bank pledged between US$3bn and US$5bn.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IMF pledged between US$2.55bn and US$4.25bn.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia and Kuwait each pledged US$500m; the UK US$452m, Italy </p>
<p>US$236m, the European Commission US$235m, Spain US$220m, the United </p>
<p>Arab Emirates US$215m and South Korea US$200m. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A number of countries, including Germany, offered assistance in kind. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France did not make a pledge.</p>
<p>451</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>813. </b> The recorded UK pledge of US$452m excluded the UK’s allocations for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance, amounts that had previously been pledged, and the UK’s </p>
<p>attributed share of European Commission development expenditure. </p>
<p><b>814. </b> The Conference noted that an International Reconstruction Fund Facility for </p>

<p><b>815. </b> The Inquiry considers and refers to the IRFFI in terms of its two component parts – </p>
<p>the World Bank Trust Fund and the UN Trust Fund. </p>
<p><b>816. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 6 November meeting of the AHMGIR reported that </p>
<p>the Conference had been “more successful than first imagined”, not least because of the </p>
<p>“political commitment” shown by the international community.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> The JNA and increased </p>
<p>certainty over the scale of resources available for reconstruction would enable DFID to </p>
<p>begin drafting a Country Assistance Plan. </p>
<p><b>817. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that the Conference was “probably the </p>
<p>key milestone in financing the reconstruction effort” and had “galvanised international </p>
<p>support for reconstruction”.</p>

<p><b>818. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, DFID Director Iraq from September 2003 to December 2004,</p>
<p>455</p>
<p> </p>
<p>identified the Conference as one of DFID’s successes in the CPA period: </p>
<p>“I think we [DFID] had helped to galvanise the international donor community </p>
<p>to contribute in Madrid. I think tha</p>
<p>t</p>
<p> was quite a success. Delivering after Madrid </p>
<p>became more of a challenge because of security, but in terms of bringing the </p>
<p>international community back together after what had been a fairly controversial </p>
<p>phase, then Madrid was a good point.”</p>
<p>456</p>
<p><b>819. </b> Mr Drummond also told the Inquiry that the proportion of the Madrid pledges to </p>
<p>reach Iraq “varied quite a lot from country to country. With a lot of countries finding </p>
<p>it – because they didn’t have the capacity to spend – difficult to deliver.”</p>
<p>457</p>
<p><b>Priorities for the last six months of Occupation</b></p>
<p><b>820. </b> Section 9.2 describes: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the growing insurgency from October 2003 in Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the increasing US and UK concerns that Ambassador Bremer’s Seven Step Plan </p>
<p>for the restoration of Iraqi sovereignty would not lead to credible elections on the </p>
<p>basis of a legitimate constitution sufficiently quickly to retain the consent of the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>822. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported to Mr Blair on 15 October that, in contrast to </p>
<p>Baghdad and the Sunni Triangle: </p>
<p>“… a virtuous circle seemed to be building up in the South, with locals supporting the </p>
<p>reconstruction process and turning in to the Coalition outsiders who disrupted it.”</p>
<p>458</p>
<p><b>823. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that, despite the success of British efforts in the South, the </p>
<p>success or failure of the Coalition project would be decided in Baghdad. It was vital </p>
<p>that the UK took a strong policy interest there. Limited UK funding (which Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>estimated at two percent of the US contribution) curtailed UK influence. </p>
<p><b>824. </b> Sir Jeremy reported on 24 October that Gen Sanchez had ordered a </p>
<p>“comprehensive review of security to try to regain operational momentum”.</p>
<p>459</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>commented that the review represented “a clear move from stabilisation towards </p>
<p>counter-insurgency operations”.</p>
<p><b>825. </b> On 26 October, the al-Rashid Hotel in the Green Zone of Baghdad, used as a </p>
<p>Coalition military base, was hit by a number of rockets.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p> The attack killed a US soldier </p>
<p>and injured 15 other people, including a UK Treasury secondee to the CPA. </p>
<p><b>826. </b> Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry that he viewed the attack as a turning point:</p>
<p>“We [the CPA] were very, very clearly on an upward slope until then … We believed </p>
<p>that the CPA was getting better at what it was meant to do and we were all optimistic </p>
<p>… From [that point] onwards, then the graph just went sharply down.”</p>
<p>461</p>
<p><b>827. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that the attack prompted the withdrawal </p>
<p>of all Treasury officials from Iraq.</p>
<p>462</p>
<p> Some would return in January 2004, once secure </p>
<p>accommodation had been provided. </p>
<p><b>828. </b> A 5 November JIC assessment advised that, by attacking a wider set of targets, </p>
<p>extremists aimed to undermine the Coalition’s political objectives.</p>
<p>463</p>
<p> Those targets </p>
<p>included international organisations: </p>
<p>“Many NGOs have already withdrawn from Iraq and the International Committee </p>
<p>of the Red Cross (ICRC), like the UN, intends to pull out most international staff. </p>
<p>Medecins Sans Frontieres has already decided to do so and others may follow.”</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>143</p>
<p><b>829. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference on 6 November, he </p>
<p>commented that the question was “how quickly could we move to elections”.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p> Mr Blair </p>
<p>thought the quicker the better, “but both the Iraqis and we needed to be able to handle it”.</p>
<p><b>830. </b> Mr Blair commented that “with progress on infrastructure etc, we were now down </p>
<p>to a specific problem of how to deal with a small group of terrorists”. Mr Blair suggested </p>
<p>that some Sunni were “desperate to be on our side” and that infrastructure projects that </p>
<p>would benefit the Sunni community should be completed.</p>
<p><b>831. </b> Mr Richmond attended a meeting with Ambassador Bremer, General John Abizaid, </p>
<p>Commander US Central Command (CENTCOM), and Gen Sanchez to discuss </p>
<p>“Sunni strategy” the following day.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>832. </b> At Ambassador Bremer’s request, Mr Richmond summarised the CPA’s work </p>
<p>so far. Sunnis felt economically and politically excluded. The CPA was seeking to </p>
<p>address this by allocating more money for job creation and quick impact projects, and </p>
<p>by stepping up recruitment efforts for the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC), police and </p>
<p>army in Sunni communities. There were “no quick fixes”. The CPA had to reassure Sunni </p>
<p>communities that their interests would be safeguarded, but that was difficult without </p>
<p>clarity on the political and constitutional process. </p>
<p><b>833. </b> Gen Abizaid agreed that there needed to be a long-term strategy, but said that </p>
<p>he was more concerned with “the next few weeks – how to prevent the insurgency </p>
<p>from growing”. He had met Sunni leaders in Mosul, and had come away with a </p>
<p>clear message: “jobs and money”. There also needed to be more flexibility on </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification. </p>
<p><b>834. </b> Gen Abizaid went on to outline the “tough” military plans to tackle the insurgency, </p>
<p>including in Fallujah. Mr Richmond warned that any military action had to be carefully </p>
<p>targeted; “a carrot and stick approach had to leave room for the carrot”. </p>
<p><b>835. </b> The AHMGIR agreed on 6 November that officials should continue to oppose the </p>
<p>CPA’s privatisation policy.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Challenging the CPA’s privatisation plans</b></p>
<p>In mid-October, the CPA shared with the UK an early draft of an Order on Iraqi Ownership </p>
<p>Transformation, which covered the privatisation of Iraqi State-Owned Enterprises </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>Mr Huw Llewellyn, an FCO Legal Counsellor, advised the IPU on 22 October that he did </p>
<p>not consider that there was a basis either under occupation law or resolution 1483 for the </p>
<p>proposed Order.</p>
<p>468</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 24 October, the IPU instructed UK officials in Baghdad and Washington to raise </p>
<p>the UK’s concerns on the draft Order with US interlocutors.</p>
<p>469</p>
<p> The IPU advised that </p>
<p>privatisation was “the most fundamental economic policy difference we have with the US”. </p>
<p>The UK shared the US interest in building the Iraqi private sector, “but not to the extent of </p>
<p>supporting privatisation of Iraqi state assets by the CPA”. US enthusiasm for privatisation </p>
<p>was not shared in Iraq. The UK believed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were significant risks in privatising SOEs before a functioning private sector </p>
<p>had been established. SOEs were unlikely to flourish, the Iraqi Government was </p>
<p>unlikely to secure a good return, and unemployment could increase.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economic reform on the scale proposed had to be led by a representative Iraqi </p>
<p>Government. </p>
<p>The UK also had significant legal concerns about the legitimacy of the draft Order and the </p>
<p>CPA’s authority to transfer ownership of Iraq state assets. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq, called on </p>
<p>Mr Tom Foley, CPA Director for Private Sector Development, on 29 October to pass </p>
<p>on the UK’s concerns.</p>
<p>470</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy reported to the FCO that Mr Foley had repeated </p>
<p>that all privatisations would take place under a sovereign Iraqi Government. Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>commented that Mr Foley’s assurances contrasted with “other analysis” that UK officials </p>
<p>had seen. </p>
<p><b>836. </b> On 6 November, Congress approved the CPA’s request for additional funds, </p>
<p>allocating US$18.4bn to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF2).</p>
<p>471</p>
<p> The funds </p>
<p>were available for two years. Congress had allocated US$2.4bn to the Iraq Relief and </p>
<p>Reconstruction Fund (IRRF1) in April 2003. </p>
<p><b>837. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> recorded that Congress imposed greater controls on IRRF2 that </p>

<p> Those included a requirement to provide, by 5 January 2004, </p>
<p>a complete list of proposed projects. <i>Hard Lessons</i> highlighted the scale of the task </p>
<p>facing the CPA: </p>
<p>“The CPA now had less than two months to compile a list of projects, develop </p>

<p>473</p>
<p> He reported to Mr Blair </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the failure of the Governing Council to “get a grip” and “develop a political </p>
<p>profile”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued CPA civilian weaknesses; strategic communications in particular </p>
<p>remained a serious problem.</p>
<p><b>840. </b> Sir Nigel also advised that he had “put down some markers” with Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer on the pace of privatisation, which Ambassador Bremer had accepted.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>846. </b> The two-year timetable was a reference to the period covered by IRRF2, which </p>
<p>Congress had approved just over a week earlier.</p>
<p><b>847. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the Inquiry that the whole idea of an early transfer to a </p>
<p>transitional Iraqi Government came as a surprise to him: </p>
<p>“In the middle of November, much to our surprise, and in many – well, in some </p>
<p>senses disappointment, it was decided that the CPA should wind up at the end of </p>
<p>June, and I was due to leave … [at] the end of January. It became clear to me a </p>
<p>couple of months before that that the entire focus of Baghdad’s attention had shifted </p>
<p>from trying to make something work into, ‘What are we going to do to run down?’”</p>
<p>478</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>848. </b> Mr Etherington described the effect of the decision in Wasit: </p>
<p>“The November 15 agreement abruptly turned [our] plans upside down. It arrived </p>
<p>without warning …</p>
<p>“… We understood the political reasons behind it all, but my overwhelming feeling </p>
<p>at the time was of professional shame. Gone were our projections about training </p>
<p>and capacity-building, our carefully thought-through project work, and our plans to </p>
<p>nurture each of the Councils and steadily reform the branch ministries. We would </p>
<p>run out of time …”</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>849. </b> Mr Bearpark told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… most decisions were being made by default, what was possible and what wasn’t </p>
<p>possible. But to the extent that decisions were being taken, my view was that they </p>
<p>didn’t look particularly stupid and that some of the sillier parts of these strategic </p>
<p>visions were just being quietly forgotten about …</p>
<p>“I don’t think that the truncated timetable was an issue. I think the real issue was </p>
<p>just that, by then, security was spiralling out of control … The only aspect where the </p>
<p>truncation had an impact … was that it reopened the battle between the Department </p>
<p>of Defense and the State Department, and … the final three months of the CPA’s </p>
<p>existence were just one permanent battleground as to who would handle the </p>
<p>[US$]18.4bn, and in what way, after the CPA was abolished.”</p>

<p>“All agree on the need to build the capacity of central Government. CPA advisers </p>
<p>praise the competence and qualifications of individual Ministry staff, but there is a </p>
<p>culture of central direction, outdated paper-based processes, and de-Ba’athification </p>
<p>has left inexperienced staff in senior positions. </p>

<p><b>855. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott told the 25 November Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) that the </p>

<p>(see Section 9.2).</p>
<p>487</p>

<p><b>858. </b> In the paper, Sir Jeremy argued that security must be the Coalition’s highest </p>
<p>priority until the transition.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> He then set out a number of areas that needed to be </p>
<p>addressed, including:</p>
<p><b>“Sunni strategy </b></p>
<p><i>• </i></p>
<p><i>Sunni outreach remains critical even while pursuing crackdown on FRE </i>[Former </p>
<p>Regime Elements] <i>activities in these areas</i>. Civic and economic development </p>

<p><b>859. </b> Mr Blair gave President Bush a slightly revised version of the paper.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>860. </b> On 19 November, the Cabinet Office informed Ministers that a combination </p>
<p>of effective lobbying by the UK in Washington and with the CPA, and similarly </p>
<p>strong reservations from the US Treasury, had led the CPA’s plans to privatise SOEs </p>
<p>to be “taken off the policy agenda”.</p>

<p> The “reconstruction” of Iraqi ministries appeared to </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Ministers’ authority was unclear.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Patchy de-Ba’athification had left many staff uncertain of their future and </p>
<p>ministers uncertain of their staff’s loyalty. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Rationalisation of staffing and pay scales had been “slow to non-existent”, </p>
<p>leaving officials hanging around ministries with no real job. </p>
<p><b>865. </b> The British Office in Baghdad commented that the new political timetable had only </p>
<p>added to the uncertainty. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>that signals from the CPA on the desired pace and scope of economic reform before </p>
<p>transition were “mixed”.</p>
<p>499</p>
<p> Some in the CPA had seen the accelerated political timetable </p>
<p>as a reason to accelerate the pace of economic reform. The UK believed that reform </p>
<p>over the next six months should be limited, but that did not mean inaction. The Coalition </p>
<p>should focus on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building Iraqi capacity including in the budgeting system;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging the IFIs to engage; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparatory work on “removing barriers and stimulating growth”, including debt </p>
<p>relief, fuel price liberalisation and SOE reform.</p>
<p><b>871. </b> Ministers agreed that approach.</p>
<p>500</p>
<p><b>872. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> recorded that the CPA’s progress towards free-market reforms </p>
<p>stalled in the face of “disagreement within the Coalition’s ranks”, concern in the IMF and </p>
<p>opposition from Iraqis.</p>
<p>501</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>873. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Sir Nicholas Macpherson highlighted the role that </p>
<p>Treasury secondees to the CPA had played in successfully challenging “some proposed </p>
<p>[CPA] policies that were not thought to be the right course of action – notably negotiating </p>
<p>a wind-down on the policy of mass privatisation of Iraqi state assets”.</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>151</p>
<p><b>876. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 18 December meeting of the AHMGIR stated that </p>
<p>the CPA was taking forward ideas for a National Reconciliation Strategy.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p> Following the </p>
<p>capture of Saddam Hussein, this was:</p>
<p>“… a determined effort by the CPA and the Iraqi Interim Administration to engage </p>
<p>Sunni leaders, alongside establishment of targeted job creation schemes and more </p>
<p>flexible implementation of the de-Ba’athification policy.”</p>
<p><b>877. </b> Also on 18 December, Mr James T Baker III, former US Secretary of State, and </p>
<p>President Bush’s personal envoy on Iraqi debt, called on Mr Blair as part of a series </p>
<p>of meetings with major creditors.</p>
<p>505</p>
<p> Mr Baker told Mr Blair that the US objective was to </p>
<p>get up to 80 percent debt reduction for Iraq, though that might be “overly optimistic”. He </p>
<p>agreed with Mr Blair’s proposal that debt reduction should be handled through the Paris </p>
<p>Club (rather than bilaterally). </p>
<p><b>878. </b> Section 10.3 describes the UK’s efforts to secure generous debt relief for Iraq </p>
<p>through the Paris Club, based on its analysis that debt relief would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase Iraq’s ability to fund its own reconstruction (and hence reduce the </p>
<p>pressure on the UK to contribute to reconstruction);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide a means of sharing the burden of financing Iraq’s recovery (as most of </p>
<p>Iraq’s debt was owed to non-combatant countries including Russia and France); </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clear the way for multilateral lending to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>879. </b> DFID approved the £3m Emergency Public Administration Project (EPAP) in late </p>

<p>506</p>
<p> The project aimed to improve policy-making, public administration and </p>
<p>public financial management by providing technical support to key institutions at the </p>
<p>centre of the Iraqi Government, including the Prime Minster’s Office and the Council of </p>
<p>Ministers Secretariat (comparable to the UK Cabinet Office).</p>
<p>507</p>
<p> Technical support was </p>
<p>provided by consultants from Adam Smith International Ltd. </p>
<p><b>880. </b> The EPAP was the first of three DFID projects during the period covered by the </p>
<p>Inquiry which aimed to improve Iraqi public administration.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>882. </b> His review of 2003 assessed that the post-conflict administration had started badly, </p>
<p>but that Ambassador Bremer had “picked it up”.</p>
<p>508</p>
<p> While political violence pervaded </p>
<p>everything, and reconciliation should have been pursued earlier: </p>
<p>“… in stimulating the supply of essential services, in improving community law and </p>
<p>order, in organising the remarkable currency exchange and in generating economic </p>
<p>activity which is livelier than the statistics or the media show, Bremer has returned </p>
<p>many of the components of a semi-normal life to most Iraqis. The majority can at </p>
<p>least perceive that the opportunity to create a new life, and a new Iraq, might be </p>
<p>worth investing in.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>883. </b> On the CPA’s media effort, Sir Jeremy assessed that:</p>
<p>“… the prize for CPA ineptness … has to go to the Iraqi Media Network, now </p>
<p>re-christened Al Iraqiya. With billions to spend and the world’s most powerful media </p>
<p>industry to draw from, the CPA has … produced a mouse, then another mouse and </p>
<p>finally, at end-year, a mouse. Subservience to Washington’s … requirements and </p>
<p>sheer dysfunctionality seem to have been the causes.” </p>
<p><b>884. </b> In his look ahead to the end of Occupation, Sir Jeremy wrote that the Coalition </p>
<p>faced a significant challenge as it prepared to transfer sovereignty.</p>
<p>509</p>
<p> In addition  </p>
<p>to the “violent opposition” and the fragility of the political process, the principal  </p>
<p>hurdles included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the very slow flow of donor money, including US money, for reconstruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>essential utilities and services being below target, leading to a loss of support </p>
<p>and consent for the Coalition; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an unemployment rate close to 50 percent.</p>
<p><b>885. </b> Sir Jeremy concluded that the situation was “poised”. To come out well, the </p>
<p>Coalition needed “one more heavy investment of effort” in three areas: military forces; </p>
<p>donor funding; and civilian staffing.</p>
<p><b>UK concern over the CPA’s media operation </b></p>

<p>not fixed by February. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock reported on 4 January 2003 that the CPA was making “yet another </p>
<p>fresh start” on its media office.</p>
<p>511</p>
<p> Given those changes, there was currently no place for a </p>
<p>senior British secondee. </p>
<p>Mr Blair and President Bush discussed progress on the media on 6 January.</p>
<p>512</p>
<p> Dr Rice </p>
<p>had now taken over responsibility for Iraqi media from Secretary Rumsfeld and there was </p>
<p>a bridging strategy to take the media through the next couple of months, while building </p>
<p>up media capacity in Baghdad. Mr Blair regretted the low media profile of Governing </p>
<p>Council members and Ministers, which meant that the public received information through </p>
<p>religious and tribal leaders.</p>
<p>The meeting of the ISOG on the same day concluded that given the US lead in the media </p>
<p>sector there was little scope for UK involvement.</p>
<p>513</p>
<p> The US was resisting the secondment </p>
<p>of senior UK staff. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> Mr Blair visited Basra to meet Coalition troops and staff in CPA(South) on </p>
<p>4 January. In advance of the visit, CPA(South) advised that: </p>
<p>“News in the South generally good, on security, politics and economy. But no room </p>
<p>for complacency on any of these and much remains to be done if we are to play our </p>
<p>part in securing an effective transition.”</p>
<p>514</p>
<p><b>887. </b> CPA(South) reported that delays caused by the CPA’s complex contracting </p>
<p>procedures made it harder to “secure the level of visibility” for CPA activity that the </p>
<p>UK and Iraqis wanted. Local expectations were high and the UK, boosted by steadily </p>
<p>increasing numbers of professional staff in CPA(South), would need to work hard to </p>
<p>meet them. </p>
<p><b>888. </b> Mr Blair met Ambassador Bremer in Basra.</p>
<p>515</p>
<p> Ambassador Bremer said that he </p>
<p>had re-examined economic priorities and intended to focus on job creation and essential </p>
<p>services, in particular electricity. The CPA already planned to deliver 6,000MW of </p>
<p>capacity by June 2004; he wanted to deliver 7,000MW. He confirmed that he would not </p>
<p>liberalise energy prices, monetarise the food ration (polls showed that 90 percent of </p>
<p>the public were opposed) or privatise SOEs, other than some small-scale management </p>
<p>buy-outs. Those would be hard decisions for the next Government to take.</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>UK’s priorities over the next six months were to keep the CPA focused on job creation </p>
<p>schemes and to build capacity in Iraqi ministries and institutions. The Treasury and DFID </p>
<p>were providing support on budget execution and financial management. </p>
<p><b>897. </b> The paper concluded that the UK’s work in all areas “must be supported by </p>
<p>continued progress on reconstruction”. DFID were producing a paper on the links </p>
<p>between the political process and reconstruction over the next year.</p>
<p><b>898. </b> Mr Blair annotated the paper: “This is excellent and seems the right strategy”.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>899. </b> Also on 22 January, Sir Hilary offered proposals from Basra on a “post-30 June </p>
<p>strategy” to maintain the benefits and momentum of CPA(South)’s work.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> In his view, </p>
<p>the priority was to manage CPA(South)’s US$212m programme of work to completion (it </p>
<p>had never been intended to complete by 30 June), using broadly the same management </p>
<p>structures and (predominately British) personnel. The US would need to be persuaded to </p>
<p>continue to provide accommodation and security, and to agree to a single international </p>
<p>“Co-ordinator” for the South, “ideally but not essentially British”. The UK would need to </p>
<p>continue to provide broadly the same level of staffing in the South. </p>
<p><b>900. </b> A bilateral UK programme should complement rather than “diminish” that  </p>
<p>priority effort. </p>
<p><b>901. </b> An early decision on how the UK intended to work in the South after transition </p>
<p>would enable the UK to influence US planning. Sir Hilary warned that the US might be </p>
<p>planning to take over CPA(South)’s existing programme of the work. The US would be </p>
<p>unlikely to be able to find replacement staff quickly and would have no experience of </p>
<p>operating in the South; there was therefore a risk that the “majority of effort” would fail.  </p>
<p>A clear UK proposal might head off any such planning.</p>
<p><b>902. </b> Sir Hilary advised that he had discussed the options with Sir Michael Jay and </p>
<p>Gen Jackson during their recent visits. </p>
<p><b>903. </b> The DFID paper on the links between the political process and reconstruction was </p>
<p>tabled at the 30 January meeting of the ISG.</p>
<p>520</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>904. </b> The paper, which drew on comments from Sir Hilary Synnott, Mr Bearpark, the </p>
<p>FCO and the Treasury, identified three potential flashpoints:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Unemployment. 90 percent of demonstrations were about jobs or salaries. </p>

<p>the South, the Essential Services Plan would help to ensure demand was met. </p>
<p>The priority should be to implement US-funded programmes and encourage </p>
<p>Japanese investment in the power sector, recognising that little would be </p>

<p>157</p>
<p><b>910. </b> Before the AHMGIR meeting, Mr Drummond advised Mr Benn that discussion at </p>
<p>ISOG had focused on concerns about benefits for communities outside the “Shia South” </p>
<p>and cautiousness about DFID’s intention to publish the I-CAP.</p>
<p>524</p>
<p> MOD officials had </p>
<p>endorsed the draft I-CAP “but for the wrong reasons”. </p>
<p><b>911. </b> Mr Drummond suggested that at the AHMGIR meeting, Mr Benn should highlight </p>
<p>the need for DFID to focus its effort: </p>
<p>“We have listened and as a result of consultation are willing to engage in oil sector </p>
<p>governance to help ensure transparency in the use of oil revenues. But we will lose </p>
<p>effectiveness if we spread ourselves too thinly. Our poverty agenda directs us to the </p>
<p>South. Other communities can benefit through [the UN and World Bank Trust Funds] </p>
<p>… and the political and NGO funds.”</p>
<p><b>912. </b> Mr Hoon’s briefing for the AHMGIR meeting recommended that he should endorse </p>
<p>DFID’s draft I-CAP.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> Because of DFID’s focus on poverty reduction, the draft I-CAP </p>
<p>was heavily directed towards the South: “This is welcome in terms of the additional force </p>
<p>protection benefits for UK military, although they [DFID] may not thank us for pointing </p>
<p>this out.” </p>
<p><b>913. </b> The draft I-CAP defined the UK’s “development goal” as “an inclusive, Iraqi led </p>
<p>reconstruction process that brings sustained benefits to all citizens, particularly the poor </p>
<p>and vulnerable”.</p>
<p>526</p>
<p> It set out three “strategic objectives”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to promote rapid, sustainable and equitable economic growth;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage effective and accountable governance; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to promote social and political cohesion and stability. </p>
<p><b>914. </b> To achieve those objectives, DFID would work at three levels: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>internationally, to improve the effectiveness of aid, including by disbursing </p>
<p>a “significant amount” through the UN and World Bank Trust Funds and </p>
<p>encouraging others to do the same, and by helping multilateral organisations, </p>
<p>including the IMF and World Bank, to engage; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>nationally, to support policies and reforms which benefited the poor, promoted </p>
<p>economic reform, strengthened public administration capacity and justice, and </p>
<p>promoted social cohesion and stability; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in southern Iraq, to help reduce poverty and restore the South’s links with the </p>
<p>centre so that it could benefit from national programmes; this would include work </p>
<p>on infrastructure and job creation, regional media and political participation. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>158</p>
<p><b>915. </b> The draft I-CAP stated that the UK had pledged £544m at the Madrid Donors </p>
<p>Conference. Channelling DFID resources through the World Bank and UN Trust Funds, </p>
<p>which had proved effective in Afghanistan, should reduce administrative costs and </p>
<p>promote donor co-ordination. The (unspecified) “remainder” of DFID’s funds would be </p>
<p>used for bilateral programmes. </p>
<p><b>916. </b> The I-CAP re-stated DFID guidance that progress against a CAP should be </p>
<p>assessed annually, and that a CAP should be subject to a “major review” every three or </p>
<p>four years. It also stated that, given the rapidly changing situation in Iraq, it would need </p>
<p>a “substantial” review after one year. </p>
<p><b>917. </b> The draft I-CAP did not offer an annual budget for DFID’s Iraq programme, for the </p>
<p>three strategic objectives, or for the three levels of activity. </p>
<p><b>918. </b> The I-CAP was published in February.</p>
<p>527</p>
<p> Three changes had been made from the </p>
<p>final draft submitted to the 22 January meeting of the AHMGIR: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Risks were recast as assumptions. For example, the risk that the security </p>
<p>situation would not improve become an assumption that it would.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The section on security included the statement that there were signs that </p>
<p>security was improving. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The section on lessons no longer included the caveat that DFID’s knowledge </p>
<p>of Iraq was limited. </p>

<p>Sir Hilary also reflected on the state of CPA(South) when he arrived in July 2003, and his </p>
<p>efforts to secure additional staff and resources: </p>
<p>“The UK’s pre-planning fell short of making practical dispositions, and political </p>
<p>direction of resources was complicated by deep differences at Cabinet level.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We borrowed computers from the Americans and scrounged Kuwaiti mobiles </p>
<p>from where we could. None were available through the FCO. DFID were generous </p>
<p>with sat phones and laptops to their contracted staff … London asked for frequent </p>
<p>reporting. I sent it over an unclassified and temperamental Yahoo link … All this was </p>

<p>18 of the 37 new staff had still not arrived.</p>
<p>“It was fortunate that both the Danish and Italian Governments chose the South in </p>

<p>“I was sent the record of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Committee [of 28 August] … and </p>
<p>it was recorded there that Synnott should be provided with everything he thought </p>

<p><b>Lobbying for US reconstruction contracts</b></p>
<p>UK Government lobbying on behalf of UK business intensified in early 2004, in </p>
<p>anticipation of the US contracts that would be funded from the US$18.4bn Iraq Relief </p>
<p>and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF2) and against a background of growing press and </p>
<p>Parliamentary criticism that UK companies were at a disadvantage in bidding for </p>
<p>US-funded contracts. Section 10.3 describes the UK Government’s support for UK </p>
<p>business in detail. </p>
<p>The 20 January 2004 meeting of the ISOG concluded that the UK needed a “proper </p>
<p>campaign plan” involving Ministers and the British Embassy Washington, targeting </p>
<p>the next tranche of US-funded contracts that would be awarded by the US Program </p>
<p>Management Office (PMO) in March.</p>
<p>532</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) submitted a paper on UK access to US-funded </p>
<p>reconstruction contracts to the 22 January meeting of the AHMGIR.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> UKTI assessed </p>
<p>that UK companies had good access to most US-funded contracts, but had achieved only </p>
<p>limited success so far. The recent award of two US-funded oil contracts to US companies </p>
<p>(bids with significant UK components had not been successful, despite lobbying by </p>
<p>Ministers) suggested that the UK needed to take a “stronger and more active political line” </p>
<p>in Washington to lobby for UK commercial interests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Mike O’Brien, FCO Parliamentary Under Secretary of State circulated a core script for </p>
<p>a lobbying campaign targeting the US to Mr Straw, Ms Hewitt, Mr Boateng, Mr Benn and </p>
<p>senior officials on 9 February.</p>
<p>534</p>
<p> The core script highlighted the strengths of UK industry </p>
<p>and expressed the hope that UK companies would be given the opportunity to display </p>
<p>those strengths in the reconstruction process. </p>
<p>In his covering note, Mr O’Brien stated that UK companies assessed that US procurement </p>
<p>procedures were “essentially fair”, were not critical of the UK Government’s support,  </p>
<p>but were convinced that there was now a window of opportunity to press the US. </p>
<p>Mr O’Brien stated that all Ministers needed to ensure that the US was “in no doubt about </p>
<p>the political importance we attach to UK firms being seen to contribute actively to the </p>
<p>reconstruction process”.</p>
<p>Mr Straw wrote to US Secretary of State Colin Powell on 17 February, expressing the </p>

<p>not been sorted out by now), Condi Rice will not admit failure; Bremer would resist </p>
<p>strongly; and Bush will not in fact hand us a baton which could be of such political </p>
<p>importance to him.</p>
<p>“So we must make the best of a bad job. The work our press officers are doing </p>
<p>on the development and implementation of the different [CPA] sectoral strategies, </p>
<p>and our assistance to IMN [Iraqi Media Network/Al Iraqiya], are the most valuable </p>
<p>contributions we can make.” </p>
<p><b>931. </b> The FCO paper was passed to Mr Blair on 12 February, under a covering note </p>
<p>from Mr Cannon.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> Mr Cannon commented: </p>
<p>“… our resources cannot match those of the Americans. Things at last seem to  </p>
<p>be moving in the right direction … So we recommend that we continue to support  </p>
<p>the US effort rather than taking over full responsibility for the media strategy. </p>
<p>Do you agree?” </p>
<p><b>932. </b> Mr Blair commented on this recommendation: “Yes but at the end of Feb I want </p>
<p>an update and if necessary, will move in.”</p>
<p>542</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>933. </b> The FCO provided No.10 with a further update on efforts to improve the CPA’s </p>
<p>media operation and Al Iraqiya on 1 March.</p>
<p>543</p>
<p> The CPA now had a tighter grip, and </p>
<p>was undertaking more strategic planning. The FCO concluded: </p>
<p>“There remains a lot of ground to make up, and the focus is still heavily on the </p>
<p>domestic US audience. But things are moving in the right direction, and more </p>
<p>systemic thought is being given to the Iraqi audience.” </p>
<p><b>934. </b> Mr Cannon wrote to the FCO on 10 March:</p>
<p>“As you know, the Prime Minister wants to improve the presentation of Iraq policy </p>
<p>in the UK and international media. He would like us to work for more broad and </p>
<p>positive coverage of Iraq …”</p>
<p>544</p>
<p>Mr Cannon listed a number of actions to improve the presentation of Iraq policy, </p>
<p>and reported that Mr Blair considered that it could best be delivered by a short-term </p>
<p>strengthening of the No.10 Press Office. </p>

<p>163</p>
<p><b>Planning and preparing for the transfer of sovereignty</b></p>
<p><b>936. </b> The 12 February meeting of the AHMGIR considered an FCO paper entitled </p>
<p>‘UK Representation in Iraq Post-Transition’.</p>
<p>545</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>937. </b> In the paper, the FCO set out proposals for an Embassy in Baghdad, a Consulate </p>
<p>General in Basra and a representative in the North.</p>
<p>546</p>
<p> The FCO also suggested that the </p>
<p>UK needed to consider how international assistance in the South should be co-ordinated </p>
<p>after CPA(South) closed on 30 June.</p>
<p><b>938. </b> The AHMGIR agreed the shape of British representation and tasked officials to </p>
<p>consider the practicalities, and requested a paper on co-ordination of the international </p>
<p>effort in the South, for discussion at its next meeting. </p>
<p><b>939. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott paid a farewell call on Mr Blair on 17 February.</p>
<p>547</p>
<p> Sir Hilary </p>
<p>told Mr Blair that reconstruction was the key to maintaining consent in the South. </p>
<p>Reconstruction projects had a long lead-time but were now kicking in. Political transition </p>
<p>and the dismantling of CPA(South) could lead to a loss of momentum and civil unrest. </p>
<p>Sir Hilary’s particular worry was the portfolio of projects conceived and initiated by the </p>
<p>UK but funded by the US. Those could suffer if the US focused on new projects and </p>
<p>DFID on UK-funded projects. He hoped there would still be a “locally co-ordinated (and </p>
<p>ideally UK-led) international effort” in the South. Mr Blair agreed on the need to maintain </p>
<p>momentum on reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>940. </b> Sir Hilary told the Inquiry that Mr Blair’s response to his concerns had been  </p>
<p>“non-committal”.</p>
<p>548</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>941. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, although anxiety and concern were occasionally </p>
<p>flagged up very strongly in Sir Hilary’s reports from Basra, when Sir Hilary left Iraq he </p>
<p>was, on balance, optimistic rather than pessimistic.</p>
<p>549</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>942. </b> Sir Hilary’s response to Mr Blair’s assessment is described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>943. </b> Mr Nixon offered his first impressions from Basra on 24 February (after some  </p>
<p>three weeks in post as Head of CPA(South)).</p>
<p>550</p>
<p> He described himself as “guardedly </p>
<p>optimistic”. Economic activity was increasing and there was an air of excitement around </p>
<p>the political process. </p>
<p><b>944. </b> CPA(South) now had “almost a full house of specialist experts” and was working </p>
<p>closely with MND(SE). By the end of February, CPA(South) would have committed </p>
<p>US$280m to more than 1,300 projects designed to create jobs, make a quick and visible </p>

<p>easing the return of the UN and other donors to the South; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthening the capacity of the Iraqi Government. </p>

<p><b>UK contributions to the World Bank and UN Trust Funds</b></p>
<p>DFID contributed £65m (later increased to £70m) to the World Bank and UN Trust Funds </p>
<p>at the end of February. </p>
<p>International donors met in the United Arab Emirates from 28 to 29 February for the first </p>
<p>International Reconstruction Financing Facility for Iraq (IRFFI) Donor Committee Meeting.</p>
<p>552</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One objective of the meeting was to agree contributions to the World Bank and UN Trust </p>
<p>Funds, within the pledges announced at the Madrid Donors Conference in October 2003. </p>
<p>At the meeting, donors committed approximately US$1bn to the two Funds, with the </p>
<p>largest contributions from Japan (US$500m) and the EU (US$190m).</p>
<p>553</p>
<p> DFID committed </p>
<p>£65m (US$120); it did not specify how that contribution was to be allocated between the </p>
<p>World Bank and UN Funds. </p>
<p>On 12 March, Mr Drummond sought Mr Benn’s agreement to increase that contribution </p>
<p>to £70m.</p>
<p>554</p>
<p> Mr Drummond advised that the original contribution of £65m represented </p>
<p>the balance of funds that DFID had available for Iraq as the end of the UK financial year </p>
<p>2003/04 approached. It was now clear that a further £5m was available. </p>
<p>Mr Drummond advised that the UK’s contribution should be transferred to the Trust Funds </p>
<p>by the end of March: </p>
<p>“We cannot be certain how long it will take to disburse money from the Trust Funds, </p>
<p>but both the [World] Bank and the UN need money up front before they can start </p>

<p><b>948. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 1 March meeting of the AHMGIR stated that </p>
<p>modified versions of the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) and International Advisory </p>
<p>and Monitoring Board (IAMB) should be retained after the transition, in order to </p>
<p>“ensure accountability and transparency”.</p>
<p>556</p>
<p> Otherwise, there was a substantial risk of </p>
<p>mismanagement of oil revenues. The arrangement could also ensure that Iraqi assets </p>
<p>remained immune from claims. The US supported the idea of a modified DFI.</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Such an arrangement might be seen in Iraq as a constraint on sovereignty, but </p>
<p>conversely many Iraqis might welcome arrangements which enhanced transparency and </p>
<p>restricted the ability of transitional Ministers to mismanage oil revenues. </p>
<p><b>950. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that the DFI currently held US$8.8bn and paid </p>
<p>for 95 percent of the Iraqi budget. In addition, “substantial DFI funds had been spent </p>
<p>off-budget on the approval of the CPA with intermittent Iraqi representation”. </p>
<p><b>951. </b> The Annotated Agenda did not contain any further detail on the “off-budget” </p>
<p>disbursement of DFI funds. </p>
<p><b>952. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the UK should press for the establishment of transparent </p>
<p>and accountable arrangements for the management of oil and other Iraqi revenues </p>
<p>through the transition period.</p>
<p>557</p>
<p><b>953. </b> Sir Jon Cunliffe told the Inquiry that, although the US and the CPA were “very </p>
<p>resistant to external monitoring and external accountability” undertaken by the IAMB: </p>
<p>“When the Iraqi Government itself arrived, I think both Occupying Powers decided </p>
<p>there was joint interest in having transparency, accountability and control [over oil </p>
<p>revenues] and, indeed, I think that the US were with us in pushing for the interim </p>
<p>Iraqi Government to take on the DFI with all of its monitoring machinery.”</p>

<p>(see Section 9.2).</p>
<p><b>956. </b> The 8 March meeting of the ISOG was advised that the UK civilian presence in </p>
<p>Basra after the transition could not yet be defined, pending PMO decisions.</p>
<p>559</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>957. </b> The ISOG was also advised that the UK was opposed to US plans for a “Transition </p>
<p>Board”, reporting to the US Ambassador, to co-ordinate international advisers in Iraqi </p>
<p>ministries after the transition. More broadly, the UK was against any “US-led post-</p>
<p>Occupation structures whether they be in the political, security or development fields, </p>
<p>whatever the extent of de facto US influence”. </p>
<p><b>958. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock called on Mr Blair on 11 March.</p>
<p>560</p>
<p> Sir Jeremy reported that </p>
<p>the flow of US funds remained slow, even to the security forces. In the electricity sector, </p>
<p>the gap between supply and demand would widen over the summer. Economic progress </p>
<p>in poorer districts remained slow and unemployment was high. The South, starting from </p>
<p>a lower baseline, was “more contented”, but managing expectations was crucial. </p>
<p><b>959. </b> Sir Jeremy thought that presentation of policy to Iraqis had improved, although </p>
<p>much ground had been lost to Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera. CPA communications </p>
<p>remained fixated on the US audience. </p>
<p><b>UK Transition Plan for Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>960. </b> The 12 March meeting of the ISG discussed a draft Transition Plan for Iraq </p>
<p>produced by the FCO.</p>
<p>561</p>
<p> The ISG concluded that:</p>
<p>“One of our main concerns was what the CPA would turn into. A gap in programmes </p>
<p>between the end of CPA and the formation of the interim Government would cause </p>
<p>problems, not least for security. Continuity was therefore essential and capacity </p>
<p>needed to be maintained. The answer was for [international] advisers to shift into </p>
<p>[Iraqi] ministries …”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>961. </b> The 18 March meeting of the AHMGIR considered a revised version of the </p>
<p>Transition Plan.</p>
<p>562</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>962. </b> The Plan stated that the transition had to be seen as a clear transfer of  </p>
<p>power, although the new Iraqi Government would still need wide-ranging assistance. </p>
<p>Issues included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establishing a transparent and robust framework for managing Iraqi funds </p>
<p>(including oil revenues). The CPA was drafting an organic Budget Law, which </p>
<p>UK officials were lobbying to improve. Higher than expected oil revenues </p>

<p><b>966. </b> Mr Benn also reported that there were tensions within the US system over how </p>
<p>much control they should try to retain after transition.</p>
<p><b>967. </b> Mr Drummond, who accompanied Mr Benn, produced a separate report for DFID </p>
<p>colleagues only.</p>
<p>566</p>
<p> He reported that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer had not seen how, politically, the Coalition could retain </p>
<p>control over Iraq’s oil revenues after transition. The Ambassador had agreed </p>
<p>with Mr Benn on the importance of managing those revenues transparently.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Interlocutors in the Ministries of Finance, Development Co-operation and </p>
<p>Industries had all favoured bilateral projects over the World Bank and UN Trust </p>
<p>Funds, because of the high UN administration fee and the lack of UN and World </p>
<p>Bank presence in Baghdad. Mr Benn and Mr Drummond had set out the merits </p>
<p>of the Trust Funds, including low transaction costs. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On the future of CPA(South), Mr Benn and Mr Drummond had been “pressed on </p>
<p>the need for some continuity on the handover of authority, both by CPA(South) </p>
<p>staff and Adm Nash. We said that from 1 July things had to be different with </p>
<p>the Iraqis in the lead supported by well-targeted advice; the big money for </p>
<p>reconstruction would come from the [US] Supplemental, the Japanese and the </p>
<p>Trust Funds.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Benn and Mr Drummond had also been lobbied by MND(SE) on funding for </p>
<p>QIPs. MND(SE) had said that their budget for QIPs would be almost exhausted </p>
<p>by 30 June, but UK forces could still play a valuable role after transition. </p>

<p>Ministers first considered reopening Basra International Airport (BIA) to commercial traffic </p>
<p>in December 2003.</p>
<p>567</p>
<p> In a joint paper, the Cabinet Office and IPU advised that reopening </p>
<p>the airport would signal a return to normality and help stimulate reconstruction. The threat </p>
<p>to aviation in Iraq was severe, however, and as an Occupying Power the UK would have </p>
<p>overall liability for commercial flights. </p>
<p>Ministers agreed in January 2004 that BIA should not be reopened to commercial flights </p>
<p>before there was an Iraqi Government in place (at the end of June 2004), at which time </p>
<p>the decision (and direct liability) would be theirs.</p>
<p>568</p>

<p>“The preparations for the post-conflict stage were abject; wrong analysis, wrong </p>
<p>people … And the volume of resources required on the ground, especially in military </p>
<p>terms, was and continues to be misjudged.”</p>
<p>570</p>
<p><b>970. </b> Sir Jeremy listed the Coalition’s major failings, including “complacency and </p>
<p>constant overselling of the true picture”.</p>
<p><b>971. </b> In early April, US forces began operations in Fallujah. Section 9.2 describes UK </p>
<p>concerns about the operation and its effect on Sunni opinion. </p>
<p><b>972. </b> On 7 April, Mr Blair received an (unattributed) report on media and communications </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>571</p>
<p> It assessed that the Iraqi media was “free, but also chaotic”: 190 newspapers, </p>
<p>25 TV stations and 70 radio broadcasters operated with almost no regulation. Where </p>
<p>satellite television was available, Iraqi citizens preferred it to terrestrial television or the </p>
<p>print media; where it was not, Al Iraqiya dominated. The major satellite channels were </p>
<p>Al Arabiya and Al Jazeera. Although Al Iraqiya was improving, “the abiding impression is </p>
<p>too little, too late”. It could not hope to rival regional satellite channels in the near future, </p>
<p>but in the long term had the potential to become a credible public service broadcaster. </p>
<p>Rumour and word of mouth remained disproportionately powerful. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>974. </b> On 8 April, the FCO tightened their travel advice, to read: “Even the most </p>
<p>essential travel to Iraq should be delayed, if possible.”</p>
<p>573</p>
<p> Companies involved in </p>
<p>reconstruction were encouraged to “ensure that they have made the appropriate security </p>
<p>arrangements”. </p>
<p><b>975. </b> On 14 April, the UK company Foster Wheeler Energy Ltd, which had been </p>
<p>contracted by the PMO to provide oil and gas project management services in Iraq, </p>
<p>informed the PMO that it intended to postpone the deployment of its staff to Iraq, citing </p>
<p>the 8 April FCO travel advice.</p>
<p>574</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>976. </b> Section 10.3 describes the exchanges between Foster Wheeler, the PMO and the </p>
<p>UK Government, leading to the (delayed) deployment of Foster Wheeler staff to Iraq </p>
<p>from late May. </p>
<p><b>977. </b> Also on 14 April, the JIC assessed that kidnapping was now being used as a </p>
<p>tactic by anti-Coalition forces.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p> The kidnappings, together with the rise in attacks </p>
<p>on foreigners over the past month, were persuading “many” foreign contractors to </p>
<p>leave Iraq. That could affect the Coalition’s reconstruction effort and, in the short term, </p>
<p>precipitate power shortages and further public discontent. </p>
<p><b>978. </b> On 15 April, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a “personal paper” from Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush, which Mr Blair hoped the President might read before their conversation </p>
<p>the next day.</p>
<p>576</p>
<p> Mr Blair summarised his strategy for Iraq as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>local engagement by Iraqis to sort the Sunni and MAS [Muqtada al-Sadr] </p>
<p>problems, with Fallujah critical;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>backed by a specific set of offers to deal with grievances;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>backed by an Iraq-wide campaign of communication, led and fronted by Iraqis”. </p>
<p><b>979. </b> Mr Blair acknowledged Dr Rice’s “heroic efforts” and recent improvements in the </p>
<p>CPA’s communications work. But:</p>
<p>“My point, simply, is that this issue [communications] is not just important; it is </p>
<p>crucial. It is at the core of whether we succeed or fail … We need a wholly more </p>
<p>professional and organised response. We can’t leave the field to Al Jazeera and </p>
<p>Al Arabiya as the satellite channels watched by the people; or fail to use the </p>
<p>terrestrial channels adequately.”</p>
<p><b>980. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush met in Washington on 16 April.</p>
<p>577</p>
<p> Mr Blair stressed to </p>
<p>President Bush the importance of standing firm, setting out a clear political vision and </p>
<p>implementing it competently. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>981. </b> Mr Blair said that there needed to be a clear strategy for addressing the grievances </p>
<p>of both the Sunnis and the Al Sadr supporters, including tackling poverty in Sadr City. </p>
<p>He added that “large amounts of money were available, but very little was being spent”.</p>
<p><b>982. </b> Mr Blair again emphasised the importance of better communication with the Iraqi </p>
<p>population. After the transition, the Iraqi Government would have increased responsibility </p>
<p>in this area and would need real help from the US and UK. </p>
<p><b>983. </b> No specific actions were agreed.</p>
<p><b>984. </b> On 18 April, Mr Richmond reported from Baghdad on the challenges of “designing </p>
<p>and executing post-conflict reconstruction in what effectively remains a conflict zone”.</p>
<p>578</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drawing on discussions with Mr Bearpark, Adm Nash and USAID, Mr Richmond advised </p>
<p>that there was:</p>
<p>“Probably less activity on the ground than CPA are prepared to admit, as aid </p>
<p>agencies and contractors withdraw personnel to safer areas pending decisions to </p>
<p>re-engage. Main foreign contractors operating at 50 – 75 percent staffing levels. </p>
<p>Some NGOs well below that.”</p>
<p><b>985. </b> Washington had directed the CPA to accelerate spending, and specifically to </p>
<p>“ameliorate conditions in Fallujah”. Of the US$18.4bn committed to IRRF2:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US$8.8bn was available now for construction projects, of which US$1.5bn had </p>
<p>been “obligated” (contracts issued); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US$5.8bn was available for non-construction projects, of which US$770m had </p>
<p>been obligated. </p>
<p><b>986. </b> The problem was translating those figures into work on the ground against the </p>
<p>timetable required by the political process. </p>
<p><b>987. </b> The PMO’s aim was to be in a position to deliver once security conditions allowed. </p>
<p>Adm Nash was advising contractors to bring in the minimum necessary number of </p>
<p>staff to “establish a bridgehead”. He had also created incentives for contractors to </p>
<p>sub-contract to lower-profile and local companies. </p>
<p><b>988. </b> Mr Richmond advised that the UK needed to consider the advice it gave to UK </p>
<p>development partners and contractors regarding travel to Iraq, and in particular to </p>
<p>consider the divergence of advice between the US and UK. The US Government </p>
<p>issued stricter guidance on travel than the UK, but did not seem to enforce it. The UK’s </p>
<p>travel advice gave him “no option but to counsel caution” to UK contractors. The </p>
<p>problems experienced by Foster Wheeler encapsulated the dilemma: “Risk coming out </p>
<p>or losing out.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>989. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote to the FCO on 19 April, advising that Mr Blair was </p>
<p>concerned by the picture painted by the briefing he had received in advance of his </p>
<p>meeting with President Bush.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p> Mr Blair believed that a renewed effort was needed </p>
<p>by the CPA and by departments in London. He had asked for 15 urgent reports, which </p>
<p>should be:</p>
<p>“… unvarnished accounts of where things stand, with as much local colour  </p>
<p>as possible; and with clear recommendations, where appropriate, for how to  </p>
<p>improve things.”</p>
<p><b>990. </b> The accounts included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the media;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction, spending and disbursement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>everyday life;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>women’s groups; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>schools, universities and hospitals.</p>
<p><b>991. </b> Sir Nigel advised that Mr Blair was prepared to put specific points directly to </p>
<p>President Bush, and suggested that Mr Richmond might draw the reports together into </p>
<p>a weekly or fortnightly “hit list of priorities”. </p>
<p><b>992. </b> The 20 April meeting of the ISOG was advised that Mr Blair considered that </p>
<p>progress needed to be accelerated in all areas of reconstruction in order to make </p>
<p>transition a success.</p>
<p>580</p>
<p> He had decided to follow developments more closely himself. </p>
<p>Sir Nigel had therefore commissioned a number of reports and recommendations for </p>
<p>improvements “to be written by the practitioners in Iraq themselves”. </p>
<p><b>993. </b> On 21 April, Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, wrote to </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, and Permanent Secretaries to set out the </p>
<p>arrangements for looking after civilian personnel in Iraq.</p>
<p>581</p>
<p> Detailed contingency plans </p>
<p>for the evacuation of UK staff in Bagdad were being drawn up, as “a matter of prudent </p>
<p>planning: the security situation in Iraq is tense, but no worse in most places than it has </p>
<p>been previously”.</p>
<p><b>994. </b> Referring to concerns expressed by Permanent Secretaries at their recent </p>
<p>Wednesday morning meeting, that the withdrawal of civilian contractors could undermine </p>
<p>the reconstruction effort and hence exacerbate the security situation, Sir Kevin advised:</p>
<p>“The impact on reconstruction would indeed be serious if contractors began </p>
<p>to withdraw, although there is little evidence that this is happening on a large </p>
<p>scale … You may have seen David Richmond’s telegram of 18 April which assess </p>

<p><b>UK Transition Plan for Southern Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>996. </b> Mr Drummond circulated a report to members of ISOG on 16 April, setting out </p>
<p>DFID’s plan to support Iraq after transition.</p>
<p>582</p>
<p> In Baghdad, DFID planned to maintain </p>
<p>its support for key ministries (including the Ministries of Finance, Planning and </p>
<p>Development Co-ordination, and Municipalities and Public Works) at around the same </p>
<p>level, at up to 20 advisers. </p>
<p><b>997. </b> The ‘UK Transition Plan for Southern Iraq’, which had been commissioned by the </p>
<p>AHMGIR on 18 March, was submitted to the 22 April meeting of the AHMGIR.</p>
<p>583</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>998. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting reported that security had deteriorated </p>
<p>“markedly” over Easter (9-12 April) and the risks to UK civilian staff in Iraq were high.</p>
<p>584</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The deployment of civilians had been reviewed and, as a temporary measure, new </p>
<p>deployments to Baghdad had been suspended and staff unable operate in the current </p>
<p>security environment had been withdrawn. </p>
<p><b>999. </b> The AHMGIR approved the recommendation that all other staff should remain in </p>
<p>Iraq subject to continuing review.</p>
<p>585</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1000. </b> The ‘UK Transition Plan for Southern Iraq’ considered the security, political, </p>
<p>reconstruction and representational aspects of transition.</p>
<p>586</p>
<p> It stated that the UK’s </p>
<p>focus should on “helping the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own future.” The main </p>
<p>challenges would be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping Iraqi citizens in the four Southern governorates to participate in the </p>
<p>national political process; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promoting economic recovery including job creation, and rebuilding </p>
<p>Governorates and local institutions. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>1002. </b> The Plan stated that the UK hoped that the US would retain a strong presence in </p>
<p>Basra, but the US had not yet finalised its plans.</p>
<p><b>1003. </b> On reconstruction in the South, the Plan reported that good progress had been </p>
<p>made “given the constraints”. Power production had improved sharply, the ports were </p>
<p>operating above pre-war capacity and the private sector was active, particularly in </p>
<p>Basra. The next phase would require major new capital investment, and the creation </p>
<p>of more jobs. </p>
<p><b>1004. </b> DFID’s projects to rehabilitate government buildings and restore power, fuel and </p>
<p>water services in the South</p>
<p>587</p>
<p> should be complete by 30 June, provided the security </p>
<p>situation remained stable. A phased exit was planned for the 50 DFID-funded staff and </p>
<p>contractors in CPA(South) and for the UK secondees supported by the FCO, beginning </p>
<p>in mid-June. </p>
<p><b>1005. </b> Other donors and the private sector would provide the main funds for </p>
<p>infrastructure after the transition. The US, through its PMO, would be by far the </p>
<p>largest donor and was likely to spend at least US$3bn in the South over the next three </p>
<p>years. The PMO was expected to take over the CPA(South) compound and base up </p>
<p>to 300 staff there; those would almost all be “contractors with little or no knowledge </p>
<p>of the local context”. The PMO had shared some reconstruction plans with the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, but “only briefly so far”. Japan, Denmark and Italy were the other major </p>
<p>bilateral donors in the South. Unless security improved dramatically, it was unlikely that </p>
<p>the UN would make a substantial impact.</p>
<p><b>1006. </b> The capacity of Iraqi central and local authorities, which would assume full </p>
<p>executive authority once CPA(South) was dissolved, was “mixed”. The PMO was </p>
<p>not currently incorporating capacity-building elements into its programmes. RTI, a </p>
<p>consultancy company funded by USAID to build local government capacity, was </p>
<p>withdrawing most of its staff on security grounds. </p>
<p><b>1007. </b> DFID had agreed in principle to provide up to £25m over two years for the </p>
<p>Governorates Capacity Building Project (GCBP) to strengthen planning, financial </p>
<p>management and other core functions in the four southern governorates. The project </p>
<p>was scheduled to start in May. </p>
<p><b>1008. </b> DFID would also fund an eight-person Transitional Advisory Team</p>
<p>588</p>
<p> to work </p>
<p>with the PMO, to help “bridge the local knowledge gap” between PMO contractors </p>
<p>and Iraqi technical directorates. The team would be deployed for six months in the </p>
<p>first instance. </p>

<p>programmes. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>1010. </b> The possibility of a “reconstruction gap”, which had been identified by Sir Hilary </p>
<p>Synnott on 22 January, was not explicitly acknowledged in the Plan. </p>
<p><b>1011. </b> In a briefing for Mr Straw (as Chair of the AHMGIR), the Cabinet Office warned </p>
<p>that DFID’s intended focus on capacity-building, leaving capital and large-scale </p>
<p>rehabilitation projects to other donors, might be controversial: </p>
<p>“This formation is fine in principle but depends on other donor funds, particularly </p>
<p>from the US Supplemental [IRRF2], being disbursed on time. US contracts are being </p>
<p>let now but if there are delays in implementation due to security or bureaucracy there </p>
<p>could be a reconstruction gap in the South this autumn.”</p>
<p>589</p>
<p><b>1012. </b> Ministers endorsed the Plan and agreed that the UK should press the US to reach </p>
<p>decisions on its future support in southern Iraq.</p>

<p><b>1015. </b> The report on the Iraqi media identified three key challenges (tackling the </p>

<p>confidence that water supply to major cities would not be interrupted even in times of </p>
<p>peak demand.</p>
<p><b>1018. </b> The report on gender issues stated that this was a “major emphasis” for the </p>

<p>595</p>
<p> Civil society organisations were </p>
<p>developing strongly, though political organisations were only now emerging. Women </p>
<p>had taken on visible leadership roles in Iraq and the TAL set a goal of 25 percent </p>
<p>representation in the Transitional Government. Funding was not an issue; the key </p>
<p>challenges were security and opportunities in education and employment.</p>
<p><b>1019. </b> The report on “schools, universities, hospitals” (from Mr Chris Segar, Head of the </p>
<p>British Office Baghdad) stated that the Ministries of Health and Education were both </p>
<p>regarded as having good political and strategic leadership and competent management </p>
<p>staff, and had established “normal” relationships with international donors.</p>
<p>596</p>
<p> US funds </p>
<p>were available for infrastructure; UK support was provided through the World Bank and </p>
<p>UN Trust Funds. Nearly all the 240 hospitals in Iraq were functioning, though many </p>
<p>faced (unspecified) difficulties. Drug supply continued to fall below Iraqi expectations, </p>
<p>but drugs were more widely available, especially to the poor, than before the conflict. </p>
<p>2,300 schools had re-opened in time for the new school year (on 1 October 2003), </p>
<p>staffed and equipped with textbooks and materials.</p>
<p><b>1020. </b> The report on oil sector development stated that production was rising ahead </p>
<p>of schedule, but future capacity was threatened by an early, mistaken focus on repair </p>
<p>rather than modernisation and development.</p>
<p>597</p>
<p> Discussions between the Ministry of </p>
<p>Oil and the CPA on raising gasoline prices continued, with the Ministry avoiding any </p>
<p>commitment on a politically contentious issue. Discussions on restructuring the oil </p>
<p>industry “remained mired in politics”. There were persistent but unconfirmed allegations </p>
<p>of corruption in both the State Oil and Marketing Organisation and the Ministry of Oil. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer had recently appointed a new Inspector General to the Ministry, </p>
<p>but after 30 June his capacity to monitor financial flows would be tested. International </p>
<p>oil companies were watching carefully, but wanted to see greater security and a stable </p>

<p>Office and UK officials in Iraq and the US:</p>
<p>“The conclusion the Prime Minister draws … is that the problem we face is not </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>177</p>
<p><b>1022. </b> Mr Rycroft outlined how Mr Blair thought existing activity could be improved, </p>
<p>including by:</p>
<p>“(a)  Iraqi-isation. We must do whatever it takes to get the ICDC [Iraqi Civil Defence </p>
<p>Corps] and Iraqi police into shape. Every main road has to be guarded, oil </p>
<p>refineries rebuilt, electricity generation on target …</p>
<p>(b)  Communications. There needs to be a concerted campaign in Iraq and abroad  </p>
<p>to explain what the security problem actually is, and how it is a deliberate </p>
<p>attempt to prevent the Iraqi people from getting the benefit of what we are doing. </p>
<p>We need to provide top security for Al Iraqiya’s reporters and staff; strengthen </p>
<p>the Coalition’s Arabic media capability; improve the coordination between military </p>
<p>and political to give real time information to spokesmen; and vastly improve the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government’s communications capability.</p>
<p>(c)  Reconstruction spending. There is a damaging gap between ‘obligated’ funds </p>
<p>and actual spending. Any suspension of … projects must be temporary. We need </p>
<p>urgent clarity and agreement on what will replace the CPA outside Baghdad after </p>
<p>30 June.”</p>
<p><b>1023. </b> On the same day, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice another Note from Mr Blair, </p>
<p>and asked her to show it to President Bush before their video conference the next day.</p>
<p>599</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his Note, Mr Blair set out the detailed analysis that Mr Rycroft had communicated </p>
<p>across Whitehall, including the need for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a vast uplift in the Iraqi Government’s capability to communicate”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a massive, concerted campaign” to explain the security problem: Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that he would “like to send a couple of people I really trust to give a proper sense </p>
<p>of what could be done”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a ‘whatever it takes’ attitude to ensure that obligated funds were spent”.</p>
<p><b>1024. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 27 April.</p>
<p>600</p>
<p> The discussion focused on </p>
<p>security, the presence of Coalition Forces after the transition, and the political process. </p>
<p>They discussed the need for the reconstruction process to continue while the Coalition </p>
<p>resolved the security situation. Mr Blair also highlighted the importance of continuing to </p>
<p>make progress on the Iraqi media.</p>
<p><b>1025. </b> In mid-April, the US had requested that the UK send additional troops to Iraq (see </p>

<p><b>1026. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Rycroft with “initial advice” on the US </p>
<p>proposal on 29 April.</p>
<p>601</p>
<p> The letter reflected Mr Hoon’s view that:</p>
<p>“… any significant increase in our military commitment in Iraq would need to be </p>
<p>considered in the context of the whole cross-Government effort … if we were to </p>
<p>take on Najaf and Qadisiyah we would need FCO and DFID to help ensure that </p>
<p>acceptable arrangements are in place on the CPA (and post-CPA) side.”</p>
<p><b>1027. </b> In late April, allegations of abuse by Coalition soldiers in Abu Ghraib prison </p>
<p>become public. Section 9.2 describes the effect of those and other allegations of abuse.</p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Major General Andrew Stewart, GOC MND(SE) at that time,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>was one of several </p>
<p>witnesses who told the Inquiry that the pictures of Abu Ghraib had had a “significant </p>
<p>effect” on MND(SE), where the public began turning against Coalition Forces.</p>
<p>602</p>
<p><b>1029. </b> Mr Drummond and Mr Mark Lowcock, DFID Director General Corporate </p>
<p>Performance and Knowledge Sharing, visited Iraq from 27 to 30 April.</p>
<p>603</p>
<p> They reported </p>
<p>that, while the security situation had deteriorated, there were encouraging signs </p>
<p>of progress on the economy. The foundations of a market economy had been laid, </p>
<p>including through the currency exchange, but the reforms were “only half done”; fuel and </p>
<p>utility price subsidies had not been reduced and the Public Distribution System for food </p>
<p>had not been reformed. They concluded that:</p>
<p>“… whether Iraq will remain a single resource (oil) economy with the potential for a </p>
<p>small elite to recapture the revenue or broaden out into a modern market economy </p>
<p>is still to play for.”</p>
<p><b>1030. </b> Mr Drummond and Mr Lowcock also reported that the DFID programme was </p>
<p>focused on building the capacity of the Iraqi Government in Baghdad and the South. </p>
<p>Most DFID funding for reconstruction was flowing through the World Bank and UN </p>
<p>Trust Funds, “thereby encouraging both to engage fully in Iraq”. Mr Drummond and </p>
<p>Mr Lowcock commented that that seemed right.</p>
<p><b>1031. </b> Mr Richmond reported by telegram on 30 April that security remained the “key </p>
<p>threat” to development and reconstruction:</p>
<p>“The PMO remains optimistic about project implementation but others are sceptical. </p>
<p>NGOs report many international staff out of the country; USAID are still below </p>
<p>full strength, with few staff outside Baghdad, and the PMO reports at least some </p>
<p>pull out/pull back by key construction companies including Bechtel, Siemens and </p>
<p>possibly GE [General Electric].”</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>1032. </b> Mr Richmond reported that Mr Drummond and Mr Lowcock had pressed CPA and </p>
<p>US officials on US transition plans, but key decisions had not yet been made. That lack </p>
<p>of clarity was making it difficult for the UK and others to plan their reconstruction efforts </p>
<p>beyond the transition, which was delaying implementation.</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> Mr Richmond offered his view on 2 May, as part of a DFID/Treasury exercise, on </p>
<p>whether unblocking funding streams would improve the security situation.</p>
<p>605</p>
<p> He advised </p>
<p>that his answer was:</p>
<p>“For now … probably no – given absorptive capacity and the security conditions.”</p>
<p><b>1034. </b> Mr Richmond continued:</p>
<p>“A disaffected, unemployed Tikriti can be bought for a few dollars to launch an attack </p>
<p>on a member of the Coalition. It has passed no one by that project planning, fund </p>
<p>disbursement and employment generation might help direct the Tikriti’s efforts to </p>
<p>more productive ends. There was a physical cash flow problem in the first quarter of </p>
<p>2004 which meant that even monthly salaries were being delayed. Those have been </p>
<p>largely unblocked.” </p>
<p><b>1035. </b> Mr Richmond highlighted the recent approval by the CPA of a “seven cities” </p>
<p>initiative, which would rapidly inject up to US$30m into each of seven areas which posed </p>
<p>significant security problems in order to increase employment. A “new but refreshing” </p>
<p>condition of approval had been the existence of a robust monitoring and evaluation </p>
<p>programme, on which DFID and USAID had provided advice. </p>
<p><b>1036. </b> Mr Richmond concluded:</p>
<p>“In the immediate term, therefore, disbursing significant extra funds into projects </p>
<p>is not the key issue. Indeed, to do so risks exacerbating a growing concern abut </p>
<p>inadequate quality control of proposals which can lead to wastage of resources and </p>
<p>corruption. More thought must also be given to how to meet the additional running </p>
<p>costs … created by capital/project expenditure …” </p>
<p><b>1037. </b> Mr Richmond also reported that: </p>
<p>“CPA statistical analysis does not show a correlation between areas of highest </p>
<p>unemployment and violence. Promoting employment in and directing projects to </p>
<p>specific trouble spots will not produce immediate results. Longer-term, effective </p>
<p>distribution of funding is therefore required.”</p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Mr Richmond reported by telegram on 4 May that US intentions regarding </p>
<p>international advisers had been misunderstood.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> Some 200, mainly US, advisers would </p>
<p>remain after the transition. They would not be “running the Government” but providing </p>

<p>advice, and mainly on technical rather than policy issues. They would only serve as long </p>
<p>as their Iraqi Minister wanted them to. </p>
<p><b>1039. </b> The main conclusions of the US transition planning process were formalised on </p>
<p>11 May in US National Security Presidential Directive 36.</p>
<p>607</p>
<p> <i>Hard Lessons</i> summarised </p>
<p>those conclusions: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After the dissolution of the CPA, the US Secretary of State would be responsible </p>
<p>for all activities in Iraq, except for military operations and the development of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Two new organisations would be established to manage the US reconstruction </p>
<p>programme (taking over the mission of the PMO). The Iraq Reconstruction </p>
<p>and Management Office (IRMO) would provide technical assistance to </p>
<p>Iraqi ministries and the Project and Contracting Office (PCO) would provide </p>
<p>procurement and project management support for the US Supplemental </p>
<p>(IRRF2). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>13 of the 17 CPA provincial offices would be closed. Basra was one of the four </p>
<p>that would remain.</p>
<p><b>1040. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that Ministers or senior officials were briefed </p>
<p>on the Directive, or the key changes it described, until July. </p>
<p><b>1041. </b> Mr Richmond and Mr Sawers met Ambassador Bremer in Baghdad on 6 May.</p>
<p>608</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Richmond reported by telegram that Mr Sawers had expressed concern that the CPA </p>
<p>would not meet its targets for basic services. Ambassador Bremer replied that it should </p>
<p>get “within shouting distance” of its 6,000MW target for power generation. Sewage was </p>
<p>a particular problem, “they were shovelling it off the streets in Sadr City”. Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer also commented:</p>
<p>“If we could even get security back to October/November 2003 levels, then effective </p>
<p>reconstruction would be possible.” </p>
<p><b>1042. </b> On the same day, the AHMGIR was advised that reconstruction had been  </p>
<p>delayed by the downturn in security, adding to Iraqi frustration with the Coalition’s </p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p>609</p>
<p> In Baghdad, UK reconstruction staff had only been able to move outside </p>
<p>the Green Zone sporadically, and hardened accommodation was in short supply. Staff </p>
<p>numbers had been “thinned slightly” as a result. CPA(South) staff had been unable to </p>
<p>travel for nearly a week. Despite that, reconstruction was continuing. During April,  </p>
<p>120 projects worth US$37m had been contracted, including clearance of rubbish and </p>
<p>road building. Those should provide employment for 17,000 people and many would </p>
<p>have a quick and visible impact.</p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>181</p>
<p><b>1043. </b> The AHMGIR was also advised that the disbursement of reconstruction funds </p>
<p>was “progressing steadily”, with security and absorptive capacity the key constraints. </p>
<p>Work was “well advanced” to ensure rapid disbursement of US funds by the PMO, and </p>
<p>through the World Bank and UN Trust Funds. </p>
<p><b>1044. </b> Ministers were invited to, and did, note this “positive progress”.</p>
<p>610</p>
<p><b>1045. </b> The 11 May meeting of the ISOG discussed Mr Nixon’s concern (first expressed </p>
<p>in his first impressions report from Basra at the end of February) that there would be a </p>
<p>gap in reconstruction activity in the South between the end of the CPA and the launch of </p>
<p>major infrastructure projects in August.</p>
<p>611</p>
<p> The number of UK reconstruction staff would </p>
<p>also fall from 51 to seven after the transition. </p>
<p><b>1046. </b> A DFID official said that DFID believed that PMO programmes would come on </p>
<p>stream in time, and that DFID had programmes that bridged the transition period. </p>
<p><b>1047. </b> Mr Richmond reported on 13 May that recent attacks on Iraq’s power </p>
<p>infrastructure indicated that the “saboteurs” had a co-ordinated plan to squeeze fuel </p>
<p>supplies to Baghdad’s power plants as summer approached.</p>
<p>612</p>
<p> Parts of Baghdad had </p>
<p>experienced a 48 hour blackout. MNF-I Commanders had been tasked to refocus </p>
<p>patrolling on the most important infrastructure sites. The Iraqi Facilities Protection </p>
<p>Service, which was just beginning to take shape, had also been retasked. </p>
<p><b>1048. </b> The 19 May meeting of the ISOG considered a DFID paper on reconstruction </p>
<p>funding and activity in the South after the transition.</p>
<p>613</p>
<p> The paper stated that the main </p>
<p>external sources of funding for reconstruction in the South after the transition would be </p>
<p>the PMO, the World Bank and UN Trust Funds, the Japanese, and DFID. Funding from </p>
<p>these sources would:</p>
<p>“… take some time to begin to show real impact in terms of improved services </p>
<p>(probably around 4-6 months), although some job creation should come sooner.” </p>
<p><b>1049. </b> In the interim, although the CPA would be dissolved on 30 June, a significant </p>
<p>number of CPA-administered/DFI-funded projects would continue beyond that date. </p>
<p>DFID was recruiting a “‘residual’ CPA team” to ensure that those projects could continue </p>
<p>(although it was not yet clear who would have legal authority to manage those projects </p>
<p>after 30 June). </p>
<p><b>1050. </b> DFID reported that the PMO had stated that, by the time those CPA/DFI </p>
<p>projects completed in late August/early September, many of its contractors would have </p>
<p>established themselves in Basra and new job opportunities should be starting to emerge. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>1054. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the coming few weeks were the last chance to move things </p>
<p>into place before the new Iraqi Government took power, and proposed a timetable for </p>
<p>the political process. He also proposed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>better protection of oil and power installations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more help for Al Iraqiya and high-quality media support for the new Iraqi  </p>

<p>616</p>

<p><b>1056. </b> Mr Blair was advised on 21 May that US and UK officials had met to discuss </p>
<p>communications issues surrounding the transition.</p>
<p>617</p>
<p> The CPA was establishing a </p>
<p>communications office for the incoming Iraqi Prime Minister. Staffing that office might be </p>
<p>problematic; the incoming Prime Minister would probably not accept staff nominated by </p>
<p>the US or UK but might have few of his own. </p>
<p><b>1057. </b> Mr Richmond reported from Baghdad on the same day that the CPA was working </p>
<p>“intensively” to establish the new administrative arrangements that the incoming Iraqi </p>
<p>Prime Minister would need:</p>
<p>“Iraq no longer has anything we would recognise as a functioning centre of </p>
<p>government; these structures require setting up from scratch.</p>
<p>“The straitjacket of a CPA Order has been rejected in favour of presenting an outline </p>
<p>proposal to an incoming Prime Minister, allowing strong Iraqi ownership of all </p>
<p>structures and staffing, though [Ambassador] Bremer has directed that some core </p>
<p>staff be in place from the day the [Prime Minister] is appointed. It will be made clear </p>
<p>that this is advice, not prescription.”</p>

<p><b>1058. </b> Mr David Quarrey, a Private Secretary in No.10, passed Mr Blair’s comments </p>
<p>on those reports to the FCO on 24 May.</p>
<p>619</p>
<p> Mr Blair thought that it was vitally important </p>
<p>that the new Iraqi Prime Minister and President had “first-class support services and </p>
<p>an immediate media plan”. It was also vital that the Coalition had a plan to protect and </p>
<p>repair Iraq’s oil and electricity infrastructure, especially as the transition and summer </p>
<p>approached. </p>
<p><b>1059. </b> On 24 May, Mr Bob Morgan, an adviser to the Iraqi Oil Ministry employed by the </p>
<p>FCO, and his bodyguard Mr Mark Carman, were killed in Baghdad.</p>
<p>620</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1060. </b> Mr Blair held a video conference with President Bush on 26 May.</p>
<p>621</p>
<p> Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that there had been a good meeting between the US and UK media teams, focused on </p>
<p>getting the right support for the new Iraqi Prime Minister. </p>
<p><b>1061. </b> Lt Gen John McColl, Senior British Military Representative, Iraq, advised the </p>
<p>28 May meeting of the ISG that there were “dangers of discontinuities” between the </p>
<p>end of the CPA and the start of the IIG.</p>
<p>622</p>
<p> The CPA was ensuring co-ordination between </p>
<p>Iraqi ministries and between Baghdad and the provinces; there could be problems </p>
<p>after the dissolution of the CPA which could not be entirely overcome by the remaining </p>
<p>international advisers. Separately, there was a risk that key Iraqi Government employees </p>
<p>would not be paid during the transition. </p>
<p><b>1062. </b> Lt Gen McColl also warned of the risk of a gap between the end of CPA </p>
<p>reconstruction projects and the start of PMO projects, leading to a dip in employment </p>
<p>during the summer which would impact on the security situation. He recommended that </p>
<p>military commanders be given access to further, and larger scale, funding for QIPs to fill </p>
<p>the gap. </p>
<p><b>1063. </b> The ISG asked DFID to look again at the risk of a reconstruction gap, and MOD </p>
<p>to approach the Treasury about further funding for QIPs. </p>
<p><b>1064. </b> On 1 June the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) was sworn in, with Dr Ayad Allawi </p>

<p> In addition to the Embassy in Baghdad, there would be </p>
<p>four “Regional Hubs”: Mosul, Kirkuk, Hillah and Basra. There was a growing realisation </p>
<p>within the US Government that the mission after transition would be very different. </p>

<p>the four southern Provinces during June, to discuss the transition and help prepare them </p>
<p>to assume “real and heavy administrative responsibilities”.</p>
<p>627</p>
<p> </p>
<p>An MOD official reported on 4 June on their visits to Maysan and Dhi Qar: </p>
<p>“… the Provincial administrations have yet to understand the implications of the </p>
<p>transfer of authority, i.e. that they will soon be fully responsible for Provincial </p>
<p>government. Inexperienced and uninformed in governance, the assumption of </p>
<p>administrative responsibility makes them uneasy. They are unhappy that the support </p>
<p>and advice that they receive from the CPA over the past year will end. Central </p>
<p>government in Baghdad is unreliable, and cannot be depended on to provide </p>
<p>uninterrupted finance and other support in absence of the kind of mediation that CPA </p>
<p>officials have provided. We are thinking of using MOD civil servants (policy advisers) </p>
<p>to help fill the gap until FCO/DFID or US project personnel are available, as planned.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maj Gen Stewart reported to No.10 on 10 June that, in contrast, the Governor of </p>
<p>Muthanna, a “dominant figure in the Province”, was eager to take on full responsibility </p>
<p>after 30 June.</p>
<p>628</p>
<p> He was, however, “likely to limit the emergence of genuinely effective </p>
<p>representative political institutions”. </p>
<p>The joint visit to Basra was delayed by ongoing attempts to reconstitute the Provincial </p>
<p>Council and the need to appoint a new Governor. </p>

<p><b>1069. </b> The UN Security Council adopted resolution 1546 (2004) on 8 June (see </p>
<p>Section 9.2).</p>
<p>629</p>
<p> The resolution: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Endorsed the formation of a sovereign Interim Government of Iraq (generally </p>
<p>known as the Iraqi Interim Government or IIG) which would assume full </p>
<p>responsibility and authority for governing Iraq by 30 June 2004, while refraining </p>
<p>from taking any actions “affecting Iraq’s destiny” beyond the limited interim </p>
<p>period (until an elected Transitional Government of Iraq assumed office). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reaffirmed the right of the Iraqi people freely to determine their own political </p>
<p>future and “to exercise full authority and control over their financial and  </p>
<p>natural resources”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Decided that the Special Representative to the Secretary-General (SRSG) and </p>
<p>the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI), at the request of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government, should: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>{{</p>
<p>advise the Government of Iraq in the development of effective civil and </p>
<p>social services;</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>and legal reform in order to strengthen the rule of law in Iraq; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>advise and assist the Government of Iraq on initial planning for the </p>
<p>eventual conduct of a comprehensive census”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Recognised that the IIG would assume the primary role in co-ordinating </p>
<p>international assistance to Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Noted that, upon the dissolution of the CPA, funds in the Development Fund for </p>
<p>Iraq (DFI) “shall be disbursed solely at the direction of the Government of Iraq, </p>
<p>and <i>decides</i> that the Development Fund for Iraq shall be utilised in a transparent </p>
<p>and equitable manner and through the Iraqi budget … that the arrangements for </p>
<p>the depositing of proceeds from export sales of petroleum, petroleum products, </p>
<p>and natural gas established in paragraph 20 of resolution 1483 (2003) shall </p>
<p>continue to apply, and that the International Advisory and Monitoring Board </p>
<p>(IAMB) shall continue its activities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Welcomed the commitment of many creditors, including those of the Paris </p>
<p>Club, to identify ways to reduce substantially Iraq’s debt, called on Members </p>
<p>States, international and regional organisations to support Iraq’s reconstruction </p>
<p>effort, urged international financial institutions and bilateral donors to provide </p>
<p>their full range of loans and other financial assistance and arrangements, and </p>

<p>UN Security Council resolution 1546 (2004).</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>1070. </b> The resolution also requested Member States, international financial institutions </p>
<p>and other organisations to strengthen their efforts to support reconstruction and </p>
<p>development. </p>
<p><b>1071. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Brown and Mr Boateng that the resolution  </p>
<p>had significant implications for Iraq’s development.</p>
<p>630</p>
<p> To maintain transparency in  </p>
<p>the management of oil revenues, the resolution provided for the continuation of the  </p>
<p>DFI under the control of the Iraqi Government. At the UK’s request, the resolution </p>
<p>explicitly mentioned transparency and provided that DFI funds could only be spent </p>
<p>through Iraq’s budget.</p>
<p><b>1072. </b> The IAMB would continue to monitor oil sales and provide an external audit </p>
<p>function, and would include an additional member designated by the Government of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1073. </b> Oil revenues held in the DFI would continue to enjoy immunity from attachment. </p>
<p>The UK had pressed unsuccessfully to extend that immunity to foreign exchange </p>
<p>reserves held in the Central Bank of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1074. </b> The resolution recognised the IIG’s authority to conclude and implement loan </p>
<p>agreements and other financial assistance and arrangements. That should enable the </p>
<p>IGI to negotiate and agree an IMF programme and conclude a Paris Club debt deal. </p>
<p><b>1075. </b> The resolution called for IFIs to engage fully in assisting reconstruction and </p>
<p>development. Since the bombing of the UN Headquarters in Baghdad in August </p>
<p>2003, they had provided technical assistance through seminars outside Iraq and by </p>
<p>commenting on draft economic legislation and the management of donor funds. That </p>
<p>was no substitute for working in country; the UK would continue to press them to return </p>
<p>as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>1076. </b> The official also advised that the Financial Management Law signed by </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer on 5 June was “a key piece of economic legislation” that regulated </p>
<p>the preparation and execution of Iraq’s budget. UK Treasury officials had been </p>
<p>extensively involved in its drafting.</p>
<p><b>1077. </b> The 17 June meeting of the AHMGIR considered DFID’s second paper on funding </p>
<p>reconstruction in the South after transition.</p>
<p>631</p>
<p> It was more detailed and less reassuring </p>
<p>than the paper considered by ISOG on 19 May.</p>
<p><b>1078. </b> In the paper, DFID assessed that the first few months after transition would be a </p>
<p>critical period for establishing stability under new Iraqi structures, building credibility in </p>
<p>the political process, and maintaining consent for multinational military forces after the </p>
<p>end of Occupation.</p>

<p>power and fuel – was likely to have a significant impact on those issues, particularly over </p>
<p>the hot summer months. The level of employment would also be important. </p>
<p><b>1079. </b> DFID reviewed the sources of reconstruction funding for southern Iraq. The last </p>
<p>CPA(South) projects would be completed by 30 September. The PMO would become </p>
<p>by far the largest source of funding (some US$3.1bn of the US$18.4bn IRRF2 was </p>
<p>allocated for the four Southern provinces), but it remained unclear when it would deploy </p>
<p>to the South and it was unlikely to have “substantial” activity under way before the </p>
<p>autumn. The IIG would have responsibility for spending DFI and other Iraqi revenues </p>
<p>from 30 June, but the UK should not expect the IIG to provide substantial funds for </p>
<p>reconstruction “in the short-term”. The World Bank and UN Trust Funds were not </p>
<p>expected to “become major players” until 2005. </p>
<p><b>1080. </b> DFID concluded that there was “a risk of a lull in funding” between the beginning </p>
<p>of the CPA wind-down in August and November, when it was “reasonable to hope” that </p>
<p>both PMO funding and IIG activity would have picked up. </p>
<p><b>1081. </b> DFID reported that actions being taken to mitigate the gap were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deploying a seven-person Project Continuity Team (PCT) to work in the PMO to </p>
<p>administer CPA projects beyond 30 June. DFID had filled most of the posts and </p>
<p>Mr Nixon was attempting to secure the CPA’s agreement to deploy the team. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Securing a “full share” of US CERPs funding.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Helping the PMO become operational in the South as soon as possible, by </p>
<p>deploying a Transitional Advisory Team to help PMO contractors adjust to local </p>
<p>conditions and engage with Iraqi counterparts. The Team should be in place by </p>
<p>late July, before most PMO contractors had arrived. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Helping Iraqi institutions to become operational quickly by focusing the work of </p>
<p>DFID’s £20m GCBP on directorates involved in basic service provision and job </p>
<p>creation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pressing the UN and World Bank Trust Funds to become operational quickly. </p>
<p>DFID was continuing to lobby both organisations. </p>
<p><b>1082. </b> DFID proposed that the UK could also consider: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing additional funding for QIPs; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing small-scale funding for Iraqi municipal councils, to enable them to fund </p>
<p>reconstruction projects; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seeking to influence PMO expenditure plans in favour of the South, possibly by </p>
<p>seconding a senior officer into the PMO.</p>
<p><b>1083. </b> DFID also advised that: </p>
<p>“CPA’s limited data shows no direct relationship between reported levels of </p>
<p>unemployment and violence. Likewise, there is no apparent correlation between lack </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>of basic services (e.g. water) and violence. But it is a widely accepted assumption </p>
<p>that employment and economic well-being will increase support for the Government </p>
<p>and a pool of un- and under-employed men will pose a security risk.”</p>
<p><b>1084. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR meeting stated that delays to PMO </p>
<p>mobilisation raised the risk of a shortfall in funding for reconstruction over the summer.</p>
<p>633</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The US remained confident that PMO contractors would deploy to Basra shortly; the UK </p>
<p>believed that was optimistic.</p>
<p><b>1085. </b> The AHMGIR noted the DFID paper, and agreed that the UK should lobby the US </p>
<p>to ensure that IRRF2 funds flowed to the South and to agree additional funding for quick </p>
<p>impact projects.</p>
<p>634</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The state of Iraq on the eve of transition</b></p>
<p><b>1086. </b> Mr Richmond reported on 17 June that the threat to staff in Baghdad was at its </p>
<p>highest level since April 2003.</p>
<p>635</p>
<p> Journeys outside the Green Zone were only being </p>
<p>approved under exceptional circumstances, seriously handicapping operational capacity </p>
<p>(although work to support the Prime Minister’s Office and some other programmes were </p>
<p>continuing). He had asked all staff who were not staying beyond 30 June to leave by  </p>
<p>21 June.</p>
<p><b>1087. </b> Mr Nixon reported on the same day that the security situation in the South had </p>
<p>improved since April, and was generally quiet.</p>
<p>636</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1088. </b> Mr Richmond reported separately, also on the same day, that attacks on oil </p>
<p>pipelines continued despite enhanced security measures, with four major attacks in </p>
<p>the past few days.</p>
<p>637</p>
<p> There were simply not enough resources to protect Iraq’s oil </p>
<p>infrastructure against determined insurgents with expertise. </p>
<p><b>1089. </b> Mr Hoon told the 17 June meeting of the AHMGIR that UK forces in Maysan were </p>
<p>sustaining 22 percent casualties.</p>
<p>638</p>
<p> That could not continue indefinitely, and root causes </p>
<p>such as unemployment needed to be examined. </p>
<p><b>1090. </b> Mr Benn told the meeting that DFID continued to look at the scope for targeting </p>
<p>factors that contributed to insecurity, such as unemployment. DFID was also looking </p>
<p>flexibly at how it provided assistance. One option was to fund provincial authorities </p>
<p>directly (although there were clearly risks, including that such funding might be diverted).</p>
<p><b>1091. </b> On 21 June, Mr Richmond reported the headline results of a CPA-commissioned </p>

<p>poll reported that 64 percent of Iraqi citizens said that their life was about the same </p>
<p>or better than a year ago; the comparable figure from the March 2004 report was </p>
<p>81 percent. The availability of schools and basic goods were regarded as the most </p>
<p>positive changes; the provision of electricity and jobs the least positive. </p>
<p><b>1092. </b> Mr Quarrey advised Mr Blair on 22 June, in advance of a video conference with </p>
<p>President Bush, that reconstruction was “still a worry”.</p>
<p>640</p>
<p> The US and UK needed to </p>
<p>make sure there was no dip in activity over the summer as CPA projects wound down </p>
<p>and new projects under the PMO and IIG started up. </p>
<p><b>1093. </b> The 25 June meeting of the ISG judged that preparations for transition were “on </p>
<p>course”.</p>
<p>641</p>
<p> The risk of a dip in reconstruction activity through the summer remained. </p>
<p>However, the Iraqi Ministry of Finance had now agreed that CPA projects funded by the </p>
<p>DFI could be managed by the PMO through to their completion, and QIPs and CERPs </p>
<p>were available to commanders for short-term projects when a specific business case </p>
<p>was put forward. </p>

<p><b>1095. </b> On the same day, as he prepared to leave Baghdad, Mr Richmond sent a </p>
<p>valedictory telegram to the FCO in London in which he assessed the failures and </p>
<p>achievements of the CPA: </p>
<p>“After security, services have been the CPA’s main failing. Baghdad presently </p>
<p>has fewer than 12 hours per day of electricity – no different from a year ago. The </p>
<p>Iraqis had inflated expectations of what CPA could deliver; the Coalition seriously </p>
<p>underestimated the scale of the problem. Sabotage and increasing demand have </p>
<p>compounded the problem but disorganisation and delays in securing funds have </p>
<p>played their part.”</p>
<p>642</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1096. </b> Mr Richmond also set out what had gone right, including establishing a political </p>
<p>process and reforming the economy: </p>
<p>“… [a] new and stable currency has been introduced; an independent Central Bank, </p>
<p>sound monetary policy and budgetary discipline and controls are in place. Higher </p>
<p>wages have resulted in a mini consumer boom. New bank regulations and a new </p>
<p>code of foreign direct investment will, once security improves, position the economy </p>
<p>for rapid growth. The black spot is unemployment (on which estimates differ) but </p>
<p>as the US supplemental [IRRF2] and other donor money kicks in this should be a </p>
<p>diminishing problem.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>1097. </b> Mr Richmond reported that CPA advisers had made progress in re-establishing </p>
<p>the machinery of government, reforming ministries, drawing up strategies and putting </p>
<p>proper financial controls in place. There was still some way to go, but there was now </p>
<p>a functioning system to hand on to the IIG.</p>
<p><b>1098. </b> A Treasury official who had been seconded to the CPA told a July 2004 Treasury </p>
<p>seminar on Iraq that the CPA’s scorecard on economic reform was “pretty evenly </p>
<p>balanced”.</p>
<p>643</p>
<p> Early, good progress (including establishing a single, stable currency) had </p>
<p>been undermined by the CPA’s loss of control over the fiscal situation over the last six </p>
<p>months. Some CPA reforms, including “unfettered” foreign direct investment and full </p>
<p>interest rate liberalisation, had been too ambitious and had irritated Iraqi counterparts. </p>
<p><b>1099. </b> The same official provided advice to Mr Brown on 28 July on UK economic </p>
<p>strategy in Iraq to the end of 2004.</p>
<p>644</p>
<p> In that context, the official advised that the CPA </p>
<p>had made substantial progress in establishing a new macroeconomic policy framework </p>
<p>and in liberalising the economy. In particular, the introduction of a new currency and </p>
<p>creation of an independent central bank had proved “more successful than expected”. </p>
<p>There had also been some substantial failures, including the unfinanced deficit in the </p>
<p>2005 budget and “ducking the subsidy issue”. </p>
<p><b>1100. </b> The official also reported that the CPA had missed its target for electricity </p>
<p>generation of 6,000MW (generation was currently peaking at 5,000MW) and for oil </p>
<p>production of 2.5m barrels per day (production was “several hundred thousand  </p>
<p>barrels” less).</p>
<p><b>1101. </b> In June 2004, the CPA published a review of their accomplishments in helping </p>
<p>the Iraqi authorities assume responsibility for security, establish effective representative </p>
<p>governance, improve essential services, and build a market-based economy.</p>
<p>645</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1102. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> described the review as “a glowing report card” which “missed the </p>
<p>mark”.</p>
<p>646</p>
<p> <i>Hard Lessons</i> assessed that the Coalition’s record was “very mixed”. The most </p>
<p>serious threat to continuing reconstruction was insecurity. </p>
<p><b>1103. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Ambassador Bremer highlighted the difficulties </p>
<p>created for the CPA by the Coalition military’s inability to provide security, and continued:</p>
<p>“Despite these handicaps, and chronic understaffing [of the CPA], the historic record </p>
<p>of the CPA’s accomplishments is clear. When the CPA left, Iraq’s economy was </p>
<p>rebounding smartly, not just from post war levels, but well beyond the pre-war levels. </p>

<p>647</p>
<p><b>Sir Hilary Synnott’s assessment</b></p>
<p><b>1104. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, although anxiety and concern were occasionally </p>
<p>flagged up very strongly in Sir Hilary’s reports from Basra, when Sir Hilary left Iraq at the </p>
<p>end of January 2004, he was, on balance, optimistic rather than pessimistic.</p>
<p>648</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1105. </b> In response, Sir Hilary wrote to the Inquiry to clarify that his judgement that “the </p>
<p>balance of probability is positive” had referred only to southern Iraq, the region for which </p>
<p>he had some responsibility, not to the country as a whole, about which he was in no </p>
<p>position to make such an assessment.</p>
<p>649</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1106. </b> Sir Hilary also emphasised that his judgement should be viewed in the context of </p>
<p>the recommendation he put forward at the time, including at his meeting with Mr Blair </p>
<p>in February 2004, that maintaining momentum in CPA(South) could best be achieved </p>
<p>by retaining a multinational development presence in the South, able to draw on the </p>
<p>expertise, contacts and trust built up during the CPA period. However: </p>
<p>“In the event, my strategy was not accepted. The international team, who included </p>
<p>a large number of British specialists, was disbanded. While DFID managed a small </p>
<p>number of British-owned projects, the vast majority of the projects which were being </p>
<p>pursued by the CPA failed, as I had feared.</p>
<p>“I would not suggest that the alternative approach such as I had proposed would </p>
<p>have prevented the subsequent build-up of violence. But it is possible that the </p>
<p>attitudes of the people of the South would have been more positive if they had </p>
<p>experienced the benefits of the projects as they came on stream … Had I known that </p>
<p>the civilian capital, experience and impetus built up over the previous year would be </p>
<p>allowed to fall away … I would no doubt have offered a different judgement.”</p>
<p><b>Resources available for reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>1107. </b> At least US$19.4bn was spent on the relief and reconstruction of Iraq during the </p>
<p>Occupation. Of that, US$16.4bn – almost 85 percent – was Iraqi funding. </p>

<p>10.1  |  Reconstruction: March 2003 to June 2004</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>UK funding for humanitarian assistance and reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>1113. </b> Section 13.1 describes how the UK Government allocated funds for humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance and reconstruction before and during the Occupation. The allocations were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In March 2003, the MOD ear-marked £10m for QIPs. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In March 2003, the Treasury agreed that the MOD could spend up to £30m on </p>
<p>humanitarian operations in the UK’s AO.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>By the end of March 2003, DFID had allocated a total of £210m to humanitarian </p>
<p>relief in Iraq in 2002/03 and 2003/04. In the event, the humanitarian crisis </p>
<p>that had been feared did not materialise. By May, DFID had made available </p>
<p>the uncommitted balance of that funding – some £90m – for “recovery and </p>
<p>reconstruction”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 9 April 2003, Mr Brown announced that he had set aside an additional </p>
<p>US$100m (£60m) to “back up the UN and the work of reconstruction and </p>
<p>development”.</p>
<p>652</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In August 2003, Ministers agreed an Iraq Strategy within the Global Conflict </p>
<p>Prevention Pool (GCPP) with an allocation of £7.5m in 2003/04 and in 2004/05. </p>
<p><b>1114. </b> Section 13.1 (Table 10) sets out UK expenditure on humanitarian assistance and </p>
<p>development assistance (reconstruction) by UK financial year (1 April to 31 March). The </p>
<p>UK spent:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£110m on humanitarian assistance in 2003/04 (and £19m in 2002/03, to enable </p>
<p>humanitarian agencies to prepare to respond to a humanitarian crisis in Iraq);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£99m on development assistance in 2003/04; in addition, the UK’s “imputed </p>
<p>share” of development expenditure by multilateral organisations to which it </p>
<p>contributed was £11m; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£5m from the GCPP. </p>
<p><b>UK support for the CPA</b></p>
<p><b>1115. </b> Departments have been unable to disaggregate figures for their support for the </p>
<p>ORHA and the CPA from their total expenditure in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1116. </b> The Inquiry estimates that the UK provided at least £60m, comprising: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£29.2m secured by the FCO from the Treasury Reserve to support the CPA.</p>
<p>653</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The FCO cannot provide a figure for their (non-Reserve) support for ORHA/CPA. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>DFID told the Inquiry that it spent “about £28m” on staff secondments to the CPA </p>
<p>and associated security costs between mid-2003 and 28 June 2004.</p>
<p>654</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Other departments will have incurred costs in relation to the salaries of their staff </p>
<p>seconded to the CPA. </p>
<p><b>Reflections on the level of resources available for reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>1117. </b> A number of witnesses told the Inquiry that reconstruction during this period was </p>
<p>not constrained by a lack of funds. Mr Andy Bearpark, the CPA’s Director of Operations, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… we [the CPA] were not in any way resource-constrained in terms of amount of </p>
<p>money. We may have been very constrained in terms of our ability to spend the </p>
<p>money.” </p>
<p>655</p>
<p><b>1118. </b> Mr Blair echoed this view in his biography: </p>
<p>“We had enough money, effort and people to have rebuilt Iraq within a year of </p>
<p>conflict’s end.</p>
<p>“What happened was that the security situation deteriorated …”</p>
<p>656</p>
<p><b>1119. </b> Mr Blair continued:</p>
<p>“… a bigger pre-planned effort and a massive civilian reconstruction programme would </p>
<p>have filled an early vacuum. It would have been an immediate jobs programme for </p>
<p>unemployed Iraqis. But … it would be naive in the extreme to believe that this in itself </p>
<p>would have stopped the violence, the origins of which were profound and political.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“With a manageable security situation, any shortcomings [in the reconstruction effort] </p>
<p>could quickly have been overcome …”</p>
<p>657</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1120. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that Iraq had been the “number one </p>
<p>recipient” of British assistance in 2003/04.</p>
<p>658</p>
<p> He agreed with the Inquiry suggestion that </p>
<p>this was sufficient to do a “high-quality” job in southern Iraq:</p>
<p>“… so long as we had also got the money that the Coalition Provisional Authority </p>
<p>was meant to allocate as well to the southern region. That was more of the problem.” </p>
<p><b>1121. </b> Looking beyond the CPA period, Mr Benn told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… ultimately it wasn’t about the availability of money. There were very considerable </p>
<p>sums that the Americans put in; this was in 2003/04 the biggest DFID bilateral </p>
