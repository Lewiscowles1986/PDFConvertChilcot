<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>425</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the post-invasion search for evidence of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </p>
<p>in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s response to the failure to find stockpiles of WMD in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demands for an independent judge-led inquiry into pre-conflict intelligence on </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD and the decision to establish the Butler Review; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s involvement with the preparation and publication of the series </p>
<p>of reports produced by the Iraq Survey Group.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section summarises, but does not include, detailed comment on findings relating </p>
<p>to pre-conflict intelligence on Iraqi WMD and the post-conflict search for WMD published </p>
<p>between 2003 and 2005 by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Hutton Inquiry;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Butler Review;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraq Survey Group;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US Senate Committee on Intelligence; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US Commission on Intelligence Capabilities.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The pre-invasion intelligence on Iraqi WMD and the withdrawal three lines of </p>
<p>reporting by the Secret Intelligence Service in 2003 and 2004 are addressed in </p>
<p>Sections<i> </i>4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The search for evidence of WMD in Iraq was started during the military campaign </p>
<p>by Exploitation Task Force-75 and was carried forward from June 2003 by the Iraq </p>
<p>Survey Group (ISG). The UK participated in both. By June 2004, the ISG had a staff </p>
<p>of 1,787, of whom 54 came from the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As the insurgency developed, the ISG’s operating conditions became increasingly </p>
<p>difficult. There was competition for resources between counter-terrorism operations </p>
<p>and the search for WMD evidence, and some ISG staff were diverted to the former.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair took a close interest in the work of the ISG and the presentation of its reports </p>
<p>and the wider narrative about WMD. He raised the subject with President Bush.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government was confident that pre-conflict assessments of Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>capabilities would be confirmed once Saddam Hussein’s regime had been removed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that it was unlikely that significant stockpiles would </p>
<p>be found. This led to challenges to the credibility of both the Government and the </p>
<p>intelligence community.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were soon demands for an independent judge-led inquiry into the pre-conflict </p>
<p>intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government was quick to acknowledge the need for a review, rejecting an </p>
<p>independent inquiry in favour of reviews initiated by the House of Commons </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) and the Intelligence and Security Committee of </p>
<p>Parliament (ISC).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government’s reluctance to establish an independent public inquiry became </p>
<p>untenable in January 2004 when President Bush announced his own decision to set </p>
<p>up an independent inquiry in the US.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Faced with criticism of the pre-conflict intelligence and the absence of evidence of a </p>
<p>current Iraqi WMD capability, Mr Blair sought to defend the decision to take military </p>
<p>action by emphasising instead:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>the regime’s breaches of Security Council resolutions; and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>the positive impact of military action in Iraq on global counter-proliferation efforts.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG’s principal findings – that Iraq’s WMD capability had mostly been destroyed </p>
<p>in 1991 but that it had been Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent to preserve the </p>
<p>capability to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction – were significant, but did </p>
<p>not support statements made by the UK and US Governments before the invasion, </p>
<p>which had focused on Iraq’s current capabilities and an urgent and growing threat.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 drew on </p>
<p>the ISG’s findings, but was not the explanation given before the conflict.</p>
<p><b>Planning and preparation for the post-conflict search </b></p>
<p><b>for WMD</b></p>
<p><b>4.  In February 2003, Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, approved UK </b></p>
<p><b>participation in a US-led rehearsal for the post-conflict search for evidence of </b></p>
<p><b>WMD in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>5.  Before approving UK participation in the search itself, Mr Hoon requested advice </b></p>
<p><b>on how to ensure the impartiality of the exercise, including through the possible </b></p>
<p><b>early involvement of the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection </b></p>
<p><b>Commission (UNMOVIC) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> During and immediately after the invasion of Iraq, the search for WMD was the </p>
<p>responsibility of Exploitation Task Force-75 (XTF-75), a US-led military unit, with small </p>
<p>UK and Australian contingents.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>7. </b> XTF-75 was deployed to carry out Sensitive Site Exploitation (SSE), a military term </p>
<p>for the exploitation of “personnel, documents, electronic files, and material captured at </p>
<p>the site, while neutralizing the site or any of its contents”.</p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>427</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Officials had begun to consider the UK contribution to SSE in early February 2003.</p>
<p><b>9. </b> On 4 February, Mr Tim Dowse, Head of FCO Non-Proliferation Department (NPD),</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p>chaired a meeting with officials from the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and the </p>
<p>Ministry of Defence (MOD) to discuss post-conflict WMD issues and the possible  </p>
<p>role of UNMOVIC.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>10. </b> The MOD outlined US plans for intelligence exploitation and clean-up over a period </p>
<p>of several years, and explained that the plans envisaged unilateral action by the US with </p>
<p>no role for the UN or other UN Member States.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> Participants at the meeting agreed that it was very unlikely that US views could </p>
<p>be shifted significantly, but that the US must be made aware of the potential value of </p>
<p>internationalising the clean-up.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> On 10 February, Mr David Johnson, Head of MOD Iraq Secretariat, sent Mr Hoon </p>
<p>briefing for a visit to Washington (see Section 6.2).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> The briefing included a paper on </p>
<p>“dealing with WMD”.</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Mr Johnson stated that there had been a good deal of “military-to-military” planning </p>
<p>between the UK and the US on WMD, and that the UK had identified the specialist </p>
<p>contributions it could make at various stages during and after the conflict.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> The attached paper on WMD stated that SSE required specialist expertise that was </p>
<p>“in very short supply”. To secure maximum value from scarce resources, the US planned </p>
<p>to establish a Coalition Intelligence Exploitation Base (IEB) in southern Iraq reporting </p>
<p>to Lieutenant General David McKiernan, Commander of the Coalition Forces Land </p>
<p>Component Command (CFLCC). IEB capabilities would include:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Site Survey Teams for initial analysis of sites secured by ground forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mobile Exploitation Teams to collect evidence;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Disablement Teams to put facilities out of action;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>laboratories to verify and catalogue evidence; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>elimination and disposal of WMD.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> The paper stated that SSE was important to the UK for two reasons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>achieving the UK’s prime objective of eliminating Iraq’s WMD; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>securing the hard evidence needed retrospectively to demonstrate the case </p>
<p>for military action, especially if it were to take place without UN authorisation.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>16. </b> The paper stated that it was in the UK’s interest to contribute and that the US was </p>
<p>“very keen” for it to do so. But the UK needed to be clear that its willingness to help was </p>
<p>conditional on resolving two issues:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘Impartiality mechanisms’ to ensure that Coalition activity has international </p>
<p>credibility.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The involvement of UNMOVIC and the IAEA once the situation is stable; as with </p>
<p>the aftermath generally, the Pentagon’s hang-ups about the UN are getting in </p>
<p>the way of common sense and our long-term interests.”</p>
<p><b>17. </b> The paper stated that, if those conditions were met, during the conflict the UK </p>
<p>should contribute:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>liaison officers in the IEB and the CFLCC SSE Fusion Cell;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Squadron HQ of the Joint NBC (Nuclear Biological Chemical) Regiment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Battlefield Intelligence Recovery Team of Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) and </p>
<p>Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) personnel;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a DIS counter-terrorism expert;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an RAF Provost</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> and Security Services Forensic Science Team to interrogate </p>
<p>computer hardware; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seven scientists with a mobile laboratory to provide a limited analytical capability.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Additional contributions could be made on an on-call basis through Air Marshal </p>
<p>Brian Burridge, the UK National Contingent Commander (NCC).</p>
<p><b>19. </b> In the post-conflict phase, the UK could contribute the Joint NBC Regiment HQ, </p>
<p>detection assets and other Specialist Monitoring Teams.</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Hoon discussed the UK’s objectives and its potential contribution to the search </p>
<p>for WMD with Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Secretary of Defense, and Dr Condoleezza </p>
<p>Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, in Washington on 12 February </p>
<p>(see Section 6.5).</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>21. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported agreement that “broad UN cover for day </p>
<p>after management in Iraq would bring political, financial and legal benefits” and would </p>
<p>“facilitate an UNMOVIC and IAEA role in verifying WMD clear-up”.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> During the talks, Mr Jack Dyer Crouch II, Assistant Secretary of Defense </p>
<p>(International Security Policy), told Mr Hoon that Iraqi scientists would be key to </p>
<p>identifying the whereabouts of Iraq’s WMD. Because the public in the US and elsewhere </p>
<p>would expect early results, there would be “a heavy forensic input” at the start of </p>
<p>the programme.</p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>429</p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Crouch also agreed with Mr Hoon that UNMOVIC and the IAEA should help </p>
<p>verify WMD discoveries in order to counter speculation that they had been planted.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> On 17 February, the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) informed Mr Hoon of </p>
<p>the deployment the next day of 74 personnel to participate in SSE “mission rehearsal </p>
<p>training” in Kuwait, and that up to 92 more personnel assigned to military operations in </p>
<p>Iraq might be “co-opted” to participate in SSE operations as necessary.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>25. </b> PJHQ stated that the priority was to ensure that any UK contribution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was coherent with wider policy objectives;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>did not put at risk the response to any chemical, biological, radiological and </p>
<p>nuclear (CBRN) incident in the UK;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was “efficient and effective”: no more than needed to achieve the UK’s aim and </p>
<p>support the US; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>took account of the significant Home Base and Force Protection demands on </p>
<p>the UK’s EOD and CBRN resources.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr Hoon approved the deployment of 74 UK personnel.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> With planning “still at </p>
<p>an early stage”, he asked for further advice on SSE operations after the rehearsal, </p>
<p>including on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>operational management of specialists in the SSE teams, including those from </p>
<p>other agencies;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“impartiality mechanisms”, including the early involvement of UNMOVIC and the </p>
<p>IAEA; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>evidence handling procedures.</p>
<p>PJHQ was also asked to reiterate to the US the UK’s concerns about impartiality.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Hoon requested that further Ministerial approval be sought for the participation of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>430</p>
<p><b>Operation ROCKINGHAM</b></p>
<p>The MOD Defence Intelligence Staff (DIS) set up Operation ROCKINGHAM to provide the </p>
<p>focus for UK intelligence support to UN disarmament activities in Iraq established under </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991).</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>An Op ROCKINGHAM cell in the DIS continued to exist after UN inspectors withdrew from </p>
<p>Iraq in December 1998, but was reduced to a single member of staff who maintained a </p>
<p>watching brief on matters related to possible future UN inspections in Iraq.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>The cell was subsequently expanded to provide UNMOVIC and the IAEA “with all-source </p>
<p>UK intelligence assessments on the extent of Iraq’s nuclear, biological, chemical and </p>
<p>ballistic missile programmes and information about sites of potential significance”.</p>
<p>In mid-March 2003, the Op ROCKINGHAM cell was expanded to encompass the </p>
<p>results of SSE and “WMD/delivery-related information from the DIS in-theatre Battlefield </p>
<p>Intelligence Recovery Team”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p><b>28. </b> On 17 March, after the failure of the Security Council to agree a “second” resolution </p>
<p>on Iraq (see Section 3.8), Mr Kofi Annan, the UN Secretary-General, announced the </p>
<p>withdrawal of all UN staff from the country.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>29. </b> UNMOVIC and the IAEA suspended inspections in Iraq on 18 March.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), issued the Execute </p>
<p>Directive authorising UK military operations in Iraq on 18 March.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>31. </b> The Execute Directive included an instruction to Lieutenant General John Reith, </p>
<p>Chief of Joint Operations (CJO), to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Support international efforts to find and eliminate Iraqi WMD capacity, its means </p>
<p>of delivery and infrastructure”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… to provide support, as appropriate, to SSE activities during Phase 3 </p>
<p>operations, but this must not be detrimental to overall FP [force posture] </p>
<p>adopted”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>40. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p><b>Chemical Weapons</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq is capable of producing the chemical agents mustard gas, tabun, sarin, </p>
<p>cyclosarin and VX.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Exact quantities of agent available are unknown, but we judge it is likely to be </p>
<p>between 10 and 100 tonnes (3.5 tonnes of nerve agent would fill 1,000 artillery </p>
<p>shells). We continue to judge that Iraq has produced chemical agent since </p>
<p>UNSCOM [UN Special Commission] left in 1998, although intelligence suggests </p>
<p>that agent production stopped prior to UNMOVIC’s deployment last autumn. We </p>
<p>do not know where this activity took place, but it is probable that it used dual-use </p>
<p>chemical facilities.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We know from intelligence that the regime expended a great deal of effort in </p>
<p>cleaning up all WMD associated sites, and dispersing equipment and material </p>
<p>in advance of UN inspections.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Details on chemical munitions are scarce. UNSCOM could not account for over </p>
<p>30,000 special munitions (both chemical and biological) although it is unlikely </p>
<p>that all of these remain.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We judge the most likely delivery means are artillery and battlefield rockets. </p>
<p>[Reference to reporting of retention of shells] mustard filled artillery shells from </p>
<p>a batch of 550 supposedly destroyed by Coalition air attack in 1991 …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Other means of delivery include aerial bombs, sprayers and missiles. </p>
<p>UNMOVIC could not account for 6,500 aerial bombs (which could easily be </p>
<p>hidden in a large hangar).”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Despite some reports that such munitions have been deployed to Republican </p>
<p>Guard units, we judge that they probably remain under tight control … in the </p>
<p>area of Baghdad.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Over last few days there have been a number of reports concerning chemical </p>
<p>weapons … But the nature of the sources makes the veracity … difficult to </p>
<p>judge.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “few reports from senior Iraqi security officials” suggested that Iraq could not </p>
<p>“prepare or produce chemical weapons”, and that its stocks were “dispersed, </p>
<p>and that therefore such weapons will not be used”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In assessing these statements it is necessary to take into account the limited </p>
<p>access these individuals appear to have to military planning, their lack of </p>
<p>technical expertise and accompanying comments which are less credible.”</p>
<p><b>Biological Weapons</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “capable of producing biological agents, including anthrax, botulinum </p>
<p>toxin, aflatoxin and ricin”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>433</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The exact quantities of agent and munitions available are unknown.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We have no intelligence that biological munitions have been deployed.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The location of mobile production facilities was not known, but they were “likely </p>
<p>to be within areas tightly controlled by the regime”.</p>
<p><b>Missiles</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was “still unclear” about the “state of readiness/assembly” of up to </p>
<p>20 Al Hussein missiles “or the numbers of launchers available. Some or all </p>
<p>of these missiles could have been dismantled to aid concealment. While we </p>
<p>believe Iraq retains the technical expertise to maintain and re-assemble … the </p>
<p>speed with which this can be achieved depends on the extent to which they </p>
<p>have been disassembled, and the degree to which they might need access to </p>
<p>specialised equipment.”</p>
<p><b>Sensitive Site Exploitation</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The bulk of the sites which might yield results are located in the Baghdad </p>
<p>area. But … most sites previously associated with WMD production have been </p>
<p>cleansed over the last six to nine months.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC continued to judge that “key documents on Iraqi WMD programmes” </p>
<p>had been “dispersed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Given the recent Iraqi emphasis on clean-up, dispersal and concealment, the </p>
<p>best prospect of exposing the full extent of the WMD programmes rests in free </p>
<p>contact with scientists, and other individuals, involved in the WMD programmes </p>
<p>and the (extensive) concealment activity …”</p>
<p><b>41. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair and Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Chief of Staff:</p>
<p>“Chances of finding WMD evidence slim before Baghdad falls and/or regime </p>
<p>collapses.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p><b>42. </b> On 3 April, SIS reissued to Mr Scarlett and a wider readership, two reports, from </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>434</p>
<p><b>Possible find of CBW agents</b></p>
<p>On 7 April, <i>The New York Times</i> reported that US troops had found several drums near </p>
<p>Karbala that might contain nerve agents and mustard gas.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>Mr Hoon’s Private Office informed No.10 that initial US tests had “indicated the presence </p>
<p>of nerve and blister agents, but the chemicals could yet prove innocuous”.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p>Four duplicate sets of samples would be taken from the drums by a specialist US team, </p>
<p>one of which would be passed to the UK. Perceptions of the sampling process would be </p>
<p>hugely important to the Iraq campaign. Openness and independent verification would be a </p>
<p>counter to those ready to believe evidence had been faked. The UK would:</p>
<p>“… press US colleagues for their sampling process to include additional samples that </p>
<p>can be passed to independent laboratories, and for sites to be maintained as ‘scenes </p>
<p>of crimes’ so that third parties can verify there was no undue Coalition interference. </p>
<p>Verification by a suitable non-Coalition laboratory will be essential if the results are </p>
<p>to be credible in international (and domestic) opinion. There is clearly a role here for </p>
<p>UNMOVIC or a successor organisation.”</p>
<p>Mr Scarlett informed the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 8 April that there was no definitive </p>
<p>information about the find by Coalition Forces of material which could be chemical and </p>
<p>biological warfare agent.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>Mr John Prescott, the Deputy Prime Minister, who was chairing the meeting in Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>absence, concluded that opportunities to conduct interviews with scientists who had been </p>
<p>engaged on Iraq’s WMD programmes should be “pursued when the fighting stopped”.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Concluding discussion at the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 9 April, Mr Blair stated </p>
<p>that the proposition that the UN weapons inspectors should return to Iraq could not be </p>
<p>decided at present.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>45. </b> When Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 10 April, they discussed the need to warn </p>
<p>Syria not to give refuge to regime figures or to scientists who knew about Iraq’s WMD.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p><b>46.  In mid-April, Sir David Manning advised Mr Blair of the need for a coherent </b></p>
<p><b>plan and greater urgency in the search for WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>47.  The UK Government sought to reconcile differing UK and US views on the </b></p>
<p><b>potential roles of UNMOVIC and the IAEA in the verification and monitoring of </b></p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>435</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On 10 April, Sir David Manning chaired a meeting to discuss the search for WMD.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Participants included Sir Richard Dearlove (Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service </p>
<p>(SIS)), Mr Scarlett, Mr William Ehrman (FCO Director General Defence and Intelligence), </p>
<p>Air Marshal Sir Joe French (Chief of Defence Intelligence (CDI)) and Air Vice Marshal </p>
<p>Clive Loader (Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations)).</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Sir David identified three areas where co-ordination was necessary:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the search for material on the ground;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>tracking down and interviewing Iraqi personnel involved in WMD programmes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>public presentation of the issue and media handling of finds.</p>
<p><b>51. </b> Sir David commented that “US handling of those issues did not seem particularly </p>
<p>structured. We could no doubt do better than the UNMOVIC inspections.”</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove underlined that co-ordination with the US, which might want to </p>
<p>control the search for WMD, was the key. He reported that SIS experts were already in </p>
<p>Iraq. SIS was re-examining old material in the hope that it would generate leads.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mr Scarlett identified four problems:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the large number of Iraqis involved in WMD programmes and their concealment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the volume of documentation, much of which had been dispersed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the munitions, which UNMOVIC assessed had been concealed and dispersed in </p>
<p>a disorganised manner; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>co-ordination in the UK and with the US.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Sir David commissioned further advice from Mr Martin Howard, Deputy Chief of </p>
<p>Defence Intelligence (DCDI), including whether there were any points Mr Blair would </p>
<p>need to raise directly with President Bush.</p>
<p><b>55. </b> Sir David concluded that the group would meet again to discuss the Whitehall </p>
<p>machinery that should be established “to track and drive forward work in this area”.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Mr Howard sent advice on next steps to Mr Hoon the following day.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> This addressed </p>
<p>both the response to Sir David Manning and US proposals for a new organisation, the </p>
<p>ISG, to take forward activity in the post-conflict phase.</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Mr Howard recommended that Mr Hoon:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>approve a letter to Sir David Manning emphasising the need for Coalition </p>
<p>commanders to give priority to WMD detection and elimination, and informing </p>
<p>No.10 of the MOD’s intention to offer elements of the UK WMD expertise already </p>
<p>in Iraq to the ISG and to consider what more could made available; and</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>436</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agree that the MOD should be prepared to approach former UNMOVIC, IAEA </p>
<p>and UNSCOM inspectors from the UK to reinforce the UK effort.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, wrote to Sir David Manning </p>
<p>on 11 April:</p>
<p>“As high intensity military action begins to draw to a close … our strategic priority </p>
<p>in Iraq should be the detection and elimination of undeclared WMD and delivery </p>
<p>systems.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that the evidence on WMD would “come in a number of forms </p>
<p>ranging from WMD materials through research facilities to documentation and IT </p>
<p>records”. Interviews of scientists and other Iraqi staff were “likely to be one of the </p>
<p>most fruitful source[s] of evidence”. It would also be essential to minimise the risks of </p>
<p>proliferation of expertise. US and UK commanders had been given directions to search </p>
<p>out and hold “personnel of interest”.</p>
<p><b>60. </b> Mr Watkins reported US proposals to create an organisation called the ISG, under </p>
<p>the auspices of the US Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), and that the US was:</p>
<p>“… keen to integrate UK and Australian expertise into this organisation. We </p>
<p>intend, in the first instance, to offer elements of the UK’s WMD expertise already </p>
<p>deployed in theatre … The total of our personnel currently deployed … is some 100, </p>
<p>increasing to 120 later this month.”</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Mr Watkins added that it was important the UK did not limit its work with the ISG </p>
<p>to “the UK Area of Responsibility where sites and personnel of interest are thinner on </p>
<p>the ground”.</p>
<p><b>62. </b> A public handling strategy would be needed, including “to moderate expectations </p>
<p>of very early progress”. Mr Watkins warned that the search for WMD and its eventual </p>
<p>destruction was “likely to be a long haul … months if not years”.</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Mr Watkins also reiterated concerns about the credibility of the Coalition’s </p>
<p>verification process should WMD be found:</p>
<p>“Given suspicions about Coalition motives, positive results would have considerably </p>
<p>more force if they were verified ‘separately’ by a non-US/UK laboratory. Ultimately, </p>
<p>we would like to see UNMOVIC or a successor body back in play. But US aversion </p>
<p>to the UN means that this is unlikely to be achievable in the short/medium term.”</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Mr Watkins reported that the FCO was approaching the Netherlands to explore </p>
<p>whether an independent laboratory there would be a possible alternative.</p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>437</p>
<p><b>65. </b> The points which the MOD suggested Mr Blair might make to President Bush </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Detection and elimination of WMD … now becoming our top political priority. </p>
<p>Need to build on current efforts and demonstrate that our casus belli has </p>
<p>substance.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition commanders “should give high priority to identifying and detaining” </p>
<p>Iraqi scientists and other staff with information about Iraq’s activities.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support for an ISG and the hope that it could deploy “as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Independent verification of US/UK WMD finds would be extremely useful </p>
<p>politically, although clearly a complicating factor.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s “ultimate objective” was UN involvement, but it recognised “that [the] </p>
<p>US had reservations”.</p>
<p><b>66. </b> Sir David Manning showed Mr Blair the advice from Mr Howard to Mr Hoon, </p>
<p>including the draft letter from Mr Hoon to Sir David, which differed little from the version </p>
<p>that was sent. Sir David commented:</p>
<p>“We need a coherent plan for Iraqi WMD. This is work in progress … We need </p>
<p>to inject greater urgency; and I am not yet convinced that we need do everything </p>
<p>as part of one large US-led organisation. Finding people [involved in Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes] is key. That doesn’t depend on CENTCOM [Central Command].”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>67. </b> In an interview for the Spanish newspaper <i>El País</i>, published on 9 April,  </p>
<p>Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC, made a number of points about </p>
<p>the role of UNMOVIC and the events preceding military action in Iraq.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK had told UNMOVIC that Iraq possessed weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction. UNMOVIC never accepted that statement as an established fact; </p>
<p>its job was to establish the facts.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had visited sites identified by the US and UK and found “nothing that </p>
<p>had to do with weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US intelligence services had provided information to the IAEA about </p>
<p>“contracts for a presumed purchase of enriched uranium from Niger” which were </p>
<p>a “crude lie” (see Box, ‘Uranium and Niger’, later in this Section).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After his report to the Security Council on 27 January criticising Iraq it had </p>
<p>begun to co-operate and provide “significant data”, including the names of many </p>
<p>technicians and scientists who had participated in the development of biological </p>
<p>and chemical weapons in 1991. UNMOVIC “needed some months to work on it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had welcomed his report on 27 January, but the “great paradox” was that </p>
<p>from then on Iraq began to co-operate and the US began to criticise him (Dr Blix).</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>438</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US and UK had become “very impatient in the first days of March”, and </p>
<p>UNMOVIC had not been left “to finish the task”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The presumed threat from Iraq could have been controlled through inspections.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He did not accept the US view that “the war with Iraq was a way of sending </p>
<p>a sign to other countries to preclude their acquisition of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction”. If a country felt its security was assured, it would not have the need </p>
<p>to think about WMD. That was the first line of defence against the proliferation of </p>
<p>WMD. North Korea now wanted nuclear arms to fend off others.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> At the Ad Hoc Meeting on Iraq on 12 April, Mr Straw stated that the UK Permanent </p>
<p>Mission to the UN in New York (UKMIS New York) would be challenging Dr Blix on the </p>
<p>media story that the British had fabricated evidence about Iraq’s WMD.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p><b>69. </b> UKMIS New York reported that, at the meeting of the Security Council on 22 April, </p>
<p>Dr Blix had said:</p>
<p>“… some recent reports of his comments – translated from foreign languages </p>
<p>into English – had contained serious errors. It was true that he had pointed to </p>
<p>weaknesses in intelligence provided, but he had also always stressed the need </p>
<p>for intelligence and the difficulties agencies faced. He had not suggested that </p>
<p>any government had fabricated evidence. In addition he had indeed said that </p>
<p>US patience seemed to run out at the same time as the Iraqis had become more </p>
<p>proactive. But if asked about the causal link, his view would be that the Iraqis had </p>
<p>become more active when they had seen that time was running out.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p><b>70. </b> In a statement to the House of Commons on 14 April, Mr Blair reported:</p>
<p>“… of 146 possible sites known to us, investigations have begun in seven but, in any </p>
<p>event, we know that for six months before the return of UN inspectors, Saddam put </p>
<p>in place a systematic campaign of concealment of weapons of mass destruction. </p>
<p>Until we are able to interrogate the scientists and experts who worked on the </p>
<p>programmes, and the UN has a list of some 5,000 names, progress is bound to be </p>
<p>slow. A specialised team, however, is beginning work and we are in discussion with </p>
<p>allies and the UN as to what the future role of the UN in such a process may be.”</p>
<p>33</p>
<p><b>71. </b> In his conversation with President Bush on 14 April, Mr Blair stated that there was a </p>
<p>need to manage media expectations in the search for WMD and suggested there should </p>
<p>be no hesitation in offering amnesty in exchange for concrete information on WMD.</p>

<p>439</p>
<p><b>72. </b> On 16 April, Mr Scarlett informed Sir David Manning of the content of his </p>
<p>discussions with CIA officials earlier that day, which covered a number of issues, </p>
<p>including the use of available intelligence in the exploitation process.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>IAEA report, April 2003</b></p>
<p>The IAEA’s 15th report on Iraq, covering the period between 1 October 2002 and  </p>
<p>1 April 2003, was submitted to the Security Council on 14 April 2003.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> The report stated:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“As of 17 March 2003, the IAEA had found no evidence or plausible indication of the </p>
<p>revival of a nuclear weapons programme In Iraq”; but the time available “for the IAEA </p>
<p>before inspections were suspended was not sufficient to permit it to complete its </p>
<p>overall review and assessment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Provided that Iraq’s co-operation had remained active, and barring unforeseen </p>
<p>circumstances, the IAEA would have been able to provide the Security Council with </p>
<p>credible assurance regarding the absence of such revival within two to three months </p>
<p>of continuing verification activities.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Many areas of Iraqi expertise seemed to have been significantly depleted, and the </p>
<p>“core of expertise” on centrifuge enrichment that existed in 1990 appeared to have </p>
<p>been “largely disbanded”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA, “with the concurrence of outside experts”, had concluded that documents </p>
<p>provided “by a number of States that pointed to an agreement between Niger and </p>
<p>Iraq on the sale of uranium to Iraq between 1999 and 2001… were in fact forged”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had therefore concluded that those specific allegations were “unfounded”, </p>
<p>but “it could not be automatically extrapolated … that Iraq had never sought to import </p>
<p>uranium”. The IAEA “would continue to investigate the matter”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Extensive field investigation and document analysis had failed to uncover any </p>
<p>evidence” that the aluminium tubes sought by Iraq were intended for use in “any </p>
<p>project other than the reverse engineering of rockets”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>440</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “provided an updated list of 430 key technical staff involved in the past </p>
<p>programme and their current work locations. The list covered the great majority of </p>
<p>essential staff.” The IAEA was “able to interview 17 individuals selected by the IAEA </p>
<p>at locations chosen by the IAEA”. Some restrictions were imposed at the beginning, </p>
<p>“when interviewees first refused to be seen without the presence of an Iraqi observer. </p>
<p>Subsequently interviewees accepted to be seen alone, but requested that their </p>
<p>interviews be taped. Ultimately, two individuals accepted to be interviewed in private </p>
<p>and without being taped. Most of the interviews proved to be of significant help in </p>
<p>improving the IAEA’s understanding of the current state of Iraq’s nuclear related </p>
<p>capabilities.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before inspections were suspended, the IAEA was “able to resolve the modalities” </p>
<p>for interviews outside Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since the inception of a system to review applications to sell or supply single or </p>
<p>dual-use items, in May 2002, the IAEA had examined 9,965 contract communications. </p>
<p>Of those, 0.1 percent had contained prohibited items.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IAEA had “repeatedly called on States to provide actionable information of </p>
<p>direct and current value” relevant to its mandate. “Towards the end of the recent </p>
<p>inspections”, there had been “an increase in the provision of such information”, </p>
<p>but the “nature and extent of that information remained limited”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi declaration submitted on 7 December 2002 “did not provide any significant </p>
<p>new information” relevant to the issues outstanding since December 1998.</p>
<p>The report concluded that “as the sole legal authority to verify Iraq’s nuclear activities”, </p>
<p>the IAEA remained “ready, subject to Security Council guidance, to resume its verification </p>
<p>activities as soon as conditions permit”.</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Mr Tony Brenton, Chargé d’Affaires at the British Embassy Washington, discussed </p>
<p>the role of UNMOVIC with Mr John Bolton, US Under Secretary of State for Arms Control </p>
<p>and International Security, on 15 April.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Brenton reported that the UK should not expect the US to agree any role </p>
<p>for UNMOVIC in the short term. The US had particular concerns about UNMOVIC </p>
<p>inspectors handling sensitive intelligence on countries outside Iraq that revealed details </p>
<p>about global WMD networks, including procurement and financing. Even in the longer </p>
<p>term, UNMOVIC would have to be reformed before the US would consider involving it. </p>
<p>The US was willing to work with the UK on other ways to validate WMD finds.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Brenton advised that the US argument about intelligence had evident force. </p>
<p>The UK would need to have a good answer if it was to maintain its current position </p>
<p>on UNMOVIC.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> The Cabinet Office reported to Sir David Manning that there was a “consensus that </p>
<p>UNMOVIC/IAEA should not – and cannot – return to Iraq in the immediate future”, but in </p>
<p>a meeting on 16 April officials had:</p>

<p>way of certifying elimination … While US private statements on Blix/Baradei </p>
<p>[Dr Mohamed ElBaradei, Director General of the IAEA] have been harsh, we have </p>
<p>seen nothing to suggest the Administration would rule out the inspectors returning </p>
<p>after a period of time, without Blix, restructured, and in co-operation with the </p>
<p>Coalition (though the precise mechanics of the last will no doubt prompt debate). </p>
<p>The time to restructure/recruit could cover the period until Blix’s retirement in June.”</p>
<p>38</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Responding to Mr Brenton on 16 April, the FCO stated that the UK agreed with the </p>
<p>US on the immediate next steps, and on the need for credible third-party verification.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The UK did not want the future role of UNMOVIC to become a UK/US problem. </p>
<p>Conditions in Iraq were such that it could be argued the return of inspectors was not </p>
<p>an issue. The UK was happy to discuss options for verifying Coalition discoveries, but </p>
<p>it was important to keep in mind the need for credibility, and “what the market will bear </p>
<p>in New York”. UNMOVIC and the IAEA were the bodies likely to carry most weight in </p>
<p>verifying and validating Coalition finds. The UK would look at alternatives, but they </p>
<p>must be sufficiently credible not to be dismissed as US/UK stooges and there were </p>
<p>“no obvious candidates”.</p>
<p><b>78. </b> The FCO stated that US officials had previously indicated that they were “prepared </p>
<p>to consider the verification/validation task being performed by a ‘restructured’ UNMOVIC </p>
<p>and INVO [the IAEA’s Iraq Nuclear Verification Office]”. UNMOVIC’s leadership also </p>
<p>needed to change. Dr Blix had said he would not extend his contract when it expired </p>
<p>in June.</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The FCO believed that the type of restructuring it had in mind could take place </p>
<p>“without adjustment to UNMOVIC/INVO’s mandates”. It was:</p>
<p>“… reluctant to offer more scope than absolutely necessary for others to make </p>
<p>difficulties for us in the Council. And, presentationally, it strikes us as an own goal for </p>
<p>the Coalition to start trying to re-write the very UNSCRs which we took military action </p>
<p>to uphold.”</p>
<p><b>80. </b> The FCO saw “substantial practical advantages” in UNMOVIC and the INVO </p>
<p>retaining responsibility for the destruction of WMD, which “could be a lengthy, hazardous </p>
<p>and very expensive task”. There would also be a need to consider whether long-term </p>
<p>monitoring arrangements could be required.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The FCO concluded that “a successful intrusive inspection regime tailored to </p>
<p>the post-war Iraqi circumstances could be a useful precedent for dealing with other </p>
<p>proliferators”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>442</p>
<p><b>Security Council debate on the future role of UNMOVIC</b></p>
<p><b>82. </b> In a meeting in New York on 22 April, Mr Bolton told Sir Jeremy Greenstock, </p>
<p>UK Permanent Representative to the UN, that “the US did not disagree with credible </p>
<p>inspections and getting WMD finds into the public domain”.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> But it was:</p>
<p>“… concerned about involving UNMOVIC too soon or too extensively … The </p>
<p>UNMOVIC issue should be left on the backburner – it would become less of a </p>
<p>problem as the Coalition made discoveries.”</p>
<p><b>83. </b> Sir Jeremy replied that the UK was “less neuralgic” than the US about involving </p>
<p>UNMOVIC, but would “not force the issue”. The UK wanted to ensure that there were </p>
<p>“credible arrangements that left no doubt over Coalition discoveries”. He also said that:</p>
<p>“US reluctance would be seen as a general reluctance to have the UN involved </p>
<p>in post-conflict Iraq (this was manageable). We had not identified any credible </p>
<p>alternatives … [I]f international verification emerged strengthened from the Iraq issue </p>
<p>it could be used in other cases.”</p>
<p><b>84. </b> The Security Council discussed UNMOVIC on 22 April.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock described the discussion as “subdued”. He reported that </p>
<p>Dr Blix told the Security Council that it was evident that civilian inspections could </p>
<p>not operate in Iraq. In addition, some of the assumptions on which the Council had </p>
<p>established UNMOVIC had changed, and it was entirely natural that the Coalition should </p>
<p>establish units to search for WMD.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> The draft UNMOVIC work programme could be adapted to assume that UNMOVIC </p>
<p>would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>verify and corroborate Coalition findings;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to supervise destruction of WMD; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>carry out longer-term monitoring.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that almost all members of the Security Council accepted </p>
<p>the need for UNMOVIC to return to Iraq and most highlighted the link with the lifting </p>
<p>of sanctions, but none pressed the US hard. The IAEA representative reported that </p>
<p>Dr ElBaradei’s view was that the IAEA should resume inspections as soon as possible; </p>
<p>it was the only body with legal powers to verify nuclear disarmament.</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Sir Jeremy told the Security Council that the UK saw a role for UNMOVIC and </p>
<p>the IAEA in verifying disarmament and long-term monitoring. He added that Coalition </p>
<p>Forces were “fully aware of the need to be active, professional, and to treat all relevant </p>

<p>uncovered.”</p>
<p><b>89. </b> Ambassador John Negroponte, the US Permanent Representative to the UN, </p>
<p>made no reference to UNMOVIC. He said that the Coalition had been focused on </p>
<p>re-establishing security and would now intensify the search for WMD. This was  </p>
<p>“likely to take time”. The US:</p>
<p>“… recognised the need for transparency … But … the disarmament regime needed </p>
<p>to be reassessed given the new facts on the ground … [T]he Coalition was still </p>
<p>very much in the stabilisation phase and the principal efforts in the search for WMD </p>
<p>remained ahead of us.”</p>
<p><b>90. </b> Responding to comments made during the discussion, Dr Blix made a number of </p>
<p>points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“For independent verification, UNMOVIC would need access to locations and </p>
<p>persons.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… UNMOVIC was the only international body which had a role and expertise </p>
<p>in inspections of biological weapons and missiles. If we were moving to a </p>
<p>WMD free zone there was a question of whether we should extend rather than </p>
<p>dismantle that capability.”</p>

<p><b>91.  In mid-April, the US invited the UK and Australia to participate in the ISG.</b></p>
<p><b>92.  At the end of April, Mr Hoon approved the deployment of specialist UK units </b></p>

<p><b>93. </b> On 16 April, AM Burridge’s Private Office informed PJHQ that 119 UK personnel </p>

<p><b>94. </b> AM Burridge’s Private Office proposed a number of additional UK contributions to </p>
<p>support the creation of the ISG, including appointment of a UK deputy head of the ISG </p>
<p>and additional life support to UK SSE personnel.</p>
<p><b>95. </b> In its meeting on 16 April, the JIC was informed:</p>

<p>four weeks. It was clear that the US placed a different priority on WMD, which was </p>
<p>near the very top of the UK political agenda. Mr Howard would lead a UK team to </p>
<p>Washington … and would listen to American views, clarify their intentions … and </p>
<p>emphasise the importance the UK placed on the WMD issue. He would report </p>
<p>back to the Committee at their next meeting, after which the Chairman would brief </p>
<p>the PM.”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>96. </b> Mr Scarlett subsequently asked Mr Howard to report on whether the activities to </p>
<p>establish the existence and scope of Iraq’s capabilities was being given a sufficiently </p>
<p>high priority in all parts of the US Administration. Depending on his report, the JIC might </p>
<p>want to recommend the possible appointment of a senior political figure to oversee the </p>
<p>Coalition effort on WMD.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>97. </b> On 21 and 22 April, Mr Howard led a UK team from the MOD, the FCO and SIS to </p>
<p>Washington to discuss the ISG with a US team including Major General Keith Dayton, </p>
<p>its future military commander.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p><b>98. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported after the talks that the ISG would be </p>
<p>“substantial”, with up to 2,000 personnel, and its task would be to “piece together the </p>
<p>deeds of Saddam’s regime, in particular the WMD programmes”. The US Department </p>
<p>of Defense (DoD) expected to have an initial operating capability in Iraq by the end of </p>
<p>May and that its work would take about six months. Maj Gen Dayton would welcome </p>
<p>“a substantial UK input”, including providing his Chief of Staff.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The talks had highlighted several “pressing issues”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>gaining access in the short term to scientists and those involved in concealment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the flow of information between theatre and capitals;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>managing public expectations about WMD discoveries; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>third-party validation of those discoveries.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> US and UK officials agreed that:</p>
<p>“… Coalition forces in theatre needed to start to shift their attention away from the </p>
<p>(well-known) sensitive sites and onto finding the right people to interview. High value </p>
<p>targets were only part of the picture. Piecing together the puzzle would depend just </p>
<p>as much on the co-operation of mid-ranking officials.</p>
<p>“… The immediate priority should be for the commanders in theatre to set up safe </p>
<p>zones and reception points for Iraqis who wanted to provide information … Former </p>
<p>UNSCOM inspectors could then assist in interviews.”</p>

<p>be long and technical.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Mr Dowse, the FCO member of the UK delegation, highlighted a number of points </p>
<p>to Mr Straw, including:</p>
<p>“The immediate need is to ensure that both US and UK are making best use of </p>
<p>the quite substantial specialist military assets we have in theatre now, to pursue </p>
<p>the search for evidence of WMD programmes. Our understanding is that the UK </p>
<p>assets are not being used at all in their intended roles; the (500-strong) US 75th </p>
<p>Exploitation Task Force is searching sites, but largely on an opportunity basis rather </p>
<p>than in accordance with a coherent set of priorities. The commanders on the spot </p>
<p>have – understandably been focused on … [other issues]. They now need to make </p>
<p>a further gear-change, and put WMD at the top of their priorities. DCDI [Mr Howard] </p>
<p>will visit theatre early next week to make sure this message gets across to UK </p>
<p>commanders. The Americans are taking parallel action with CENTCOM.”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Dowse reported that, contrary to the reporting telegram from Washington, the </p>
<p>ISG was expected “to roll out incrementally from the start of May”, and:</p>
<p>“Subject to Mr Hoon’s approval, MOD have agreed in principle to a UK contingent in </p>
<p>the ISG of about 100 specialist personnel, including the Chief of Staff.”</p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Desmond Bowen, the Deputy Head of OD Sec, held a meeting on 24 April </p>
<p>“to focus on the very short term, before the ISG is fully up and running at the end </p>
<p>of May”.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> He informed Sir David Manning that three main obstacles to early progress </p>
<p>had been identified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the search for WMD not being CENTCOM’s priority and the military operating </p>
<p>“in a piecemeal fashion”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>poor security, especially in Baghdad, making it difficult and dangerous to </p>
<p>interview some of those known to be involved; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of incentives for scientists and others to come forward.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The meeting produced two ideas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>immediate establishment of a pilot scheme in Basra, using UK resources, to take </p>
<p>advantage of the fact that many WMD scientists were “likely to have been Shia </p>
<p>and may have gone home to the South”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>development of an incentives package.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>agreed the need to redirect US and UK resources in theatre while the ISG was </p>
<p>still building its capacity;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accepted “the political desirability of third party validation” of finds and did “not </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>448</p>
<p>“We may not ultimately need to be able to point to vast stockpiles of agent, missiles </p>
<p>or warheads. But we would at the least need hard evidence of a programme that </p>
<p>could be mobilised at short notice and concealment activity.”</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr Howard also reported that there had been strong support for a scheme to </p>
<p>incentivise and attract scientists to speak to the Coalition.</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Separately, Mr Howard advised Mr Scarlett that he saw no need to appoint a senior </p>
<p>political figure to oversee the Coalition effort on WMD detection.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> His impression was </p>
<p>that Secretary Rumsfeld and Mr Stephen Cambone, US Under Secretary of Defense </p>
<p>for Intelligence, had a firm political grip on policy and execution. The difficulty lay in </p>
<p>transmitting the sense of priority and urgency into action on the ground.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> A paper prepared by the MOD on 3 May for the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>Rehabilitation (AHMGIR) on 8 May, stated that, by 30 April, investigations had begun at </p>
<p>19 of the 147 highest-priority potential WMD-related sites identified by the US and UK </p>
<p>before the invasion, and at a further 42 ad hoc sites.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> There were 400 lower-priority </p>
<p>potential WMD sites remaining to be investigated.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> The MOD stated that the proposed mission of the ISG was to:</p>
<p>“Co-ordinate and conduct intelligence exploitation throughout Iraq and locate, </p>
<p>disable and eliminate Iraqi CBRN/M [chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear/</p>
<p>missile] production, storage facilities and materials in order to: complete the removal </p>
<p>of the Iraqi regime; enable the prosecution of war crimes and crimes against </p>
<p>humanity; determine the status of Kuwaiti POWs … remove the threat from Iraqi </p>
<p>WMD and assist the Global War on Terrorism.”</p>
<p><b>122. </b> The concept of operations for the ISG was “still fluid” and could pose some </p>
<p>difficulties for the UK.</p>
<p><b>123. </b> The FCO and the MOD were “developing proposals for a reconstitution of </p>
<p>UNMOVIC tailored to the new permissive environment in Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>124. </b> The Cabinet Office’s Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR stated that “US </p>
<p>investigation efforts are currently ad hoc but will be established on a sounder footing </p>
<p>from the end of May”. The ISG would have over 1,000 specialist staff. Officials invited </p>
<p>Ministers to “note the progress made and the time likely before investigations produce </p>

<p><b>125. </b> AM Burridge criticised CENTCOM’s handling of SSE operations in his ‘Hauldown </p>
<p>Report’ of 8 May.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“The scale and complexity of SSE was underestimated by CENTCOM who primarily </p>
<p>focused on sites with WMD connections. They became fixated on the Weapons of </p>
<p>Mass Destruction Master Site List (WMSL) and there was unfounded confidence </p>
<p>that the ‘smoking gun’ would be found during the exploitation of early Priority 1 </p>
<p>sites. With the rapid collapse of the regime and the failure to find any evidence </p>
<p>of WMD, there was a realisation that the number of non-WMD sites was far in </p>
<p>excess of capability. These needed rapid exploitation before looting destroyed any </p>
<p>potential evidence. The diversity of agencies … and forces … involved resulted </p>
<p>in a fragmented approach … In addition, reporting mechanisms were developed </p>
<p>well after the start of operations, which resulted in confusion and inability to </p>
<p>track progress.”</p>
<p><b>126. </b> AM Burridge also criticised the US decision to embed media in XTF-75. The “delay </p>
<p>in establishing the facts associated with many discoveries” had led to friction in the </p>
<p>command chain.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> On 11 May, an article published in <i>The Washington Post </i>described the </p>
<p>replacement of XTF-75 by the ISG as “a milestone in frustration for a major declared </p>
<p>objective of the war”, but recognised that:</p>
<p>“Even the sharpest sceptics do not rule out that the hunt may eventually find </p>
<p>evidence of banned weapons. The most significant unknown is what US </p>
<p>interrogators are learning from senior Iraqi scientists, military industrial managers </p>
<p>and Iraqi government leaders now in custody … Publicly, the Bush Administration </p>
<p>has declined to discuss what the captured Iraqis are saying. In private, US officials </p>
<p>provide conflicting reports, with some hinting at important disclosures.”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>128. </b> The article attracted wide coverage and prompted sharply contrasting headlines in </p>

<p>• </p>

<p><b>129. </b> The work of XTF-75 was summarised in the introduction to the final report of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>450</p>
<p>prevailed with concern about force protection primary. The work of XTF-75 was </p>
<p>therefore aimed at discovery of possible WMD locations (to eliminate a threat), not </p>
<p>the compilation of evidence to build a picture of what happened to the weapons </p>
<p>and programs.</p>
<p>“This early approach, perhaps logical if the goal was simply to find hidden weapons, </p>
<p>undermined the subsequent approach of piecing together the evidence of the Iraqi </p>
<p>WMD programs such as they existed. In fact, combined with the chaos of the war </p>
<p>and the widespread looting in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, it resulted in </p>
<p>the loss of a great amount of potentially very valuable information and material for </p>
<p>constructing a full picture of Iraqi WMD capabilities. Sites were looted. Documents </p>
<p>were either ignored or collected haphazardly or burned by either the Regime or </p>
<p>Coalition forces.”</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>130. </b> In his memoir, Mr George Tenet, the US Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), </p>
<p>wrote that a lot of time had been lost by the time the ISG was established:</p>
<p>“… the Iraqis had been deliberately destroying records … government files were </p>
<p>being seized by the truckload by groups such as the Iraqi National Congress … </p>
<p>raising questions about the validity of any information that might later be discovered </p>
<p>in these documents”.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>131. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of Joint Operations during the </p>
<p>invasion, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We certainly had special processes: Sensitive site exploitation … and as the </p>
<p>conventional advance went on there were a series of sites that were pre-identified </p>
<p>that were then searched for evidence of WMD.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Asked what proportion of the military operation was geared to finding WMD,  </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry said:</p>
<p>“It was small … subordinate to decisive manoeuvre. Getting to Baghdad, winning the </p>
<p>conventional phase was what it was all about and this was very much a subtext, but </p>
<p>an important subtext.”</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think that some of us expected that there would be some finds relatively quickly, </p>
<p>you know, whilst the trail was still hot. So it was very frustrating, in the early </p>
<p>weeks after the military conflict finished, when there was absolutely no progress </p>
<p>made at all.</p>

<p>451</p>
<p>“What we hoped was that maybe a military unit would run into something. But I also </p>
<p>remember the figure for the number of unguarded Iraqi ordnance dumps across Iraq, </p>
<p>and strictly speaking, all of those should have been inspected, but it was completely </p>
<p>impossible to do so.”</p>
<p>66</p>
<p><b>134. </b> SIS4 told the Inquiry what he had expected to be found when the search began:</p>
<p>“It seemed to me that we had to get a fire blanket over the proliferation hazards, and </p>
<p>very quickly indeed …</p>
<p>“Secondly, while not expecting gleaming arrays of kit to be found, just curiosity </p>
<p>meant that we longed to get in there and find out what we had been tinkering with.</p>
<p>“Lastly, the Whitehall political question, ‘Well, SIS, you have been party to this high </p>
<p>tension pursuit of WMD. Where is it then?’</p>
<p>“So the need to orchestrate immediate follow-up inside Iraq on all that we knew, all </p>
<p>the leads, seemed to me to be very, very, very important. I was concerned that the </p>
<p>lead on this was going to MOD and in America, and my anxieties were borne out by </p>
<p>what happened. There were ammo dumps in Iraq covering square kilometres … It </p>
<p>was a huge task, and it needed very, very skilful and dynamic generalship to run the </p>
<p>follow-up. I’m afraid that didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Asked whether SIS had a plan to deal with the situation, SIS4 said that he </p>
<p>recognised:</p>
<p>“… it wouldn’t be up to us. We didn’t have the staff. We didn’t have the authority. But </p>
<p>I did make the point repeatedly in conversations with people in Whitehall, particularly </p>
<p>with the military, that this needed gripping. The plan needed to be written, and </p>
<p>command and control put in place to make sure the plan was implemented.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Movement inside Iraq was very tightly controlled by the military. People were being </p>
<p>arrested. My memory is that we did try to get access, but it was very muddled … </p>
<p>We put people on the ground quite quickly to be there to follow things up, but I don’t </p>
<p>recall any good coming out of it. At this time, of course, the military were on the </p>
<p>ground in Iraq. Force protection and military requirements, operational requirements </p>
<p>took priority.”</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>136. </b> SIS4 expressed surprise at the relative lack of concern about WMD after the </p>
<p>military operation ended: “deployments remained, things were put in place, but they </p>
<p>weren’t being driven from the very top”.</p>

<p><b>137. </b> SIS3 told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I assumed, as others did, that there was indeed WMD. I mean, it was very swiftly </p>
<p>shown that the nuclear reporting was pretty accurate and the missile reporting was </p>
<p>accurate. But the CBW, obviously, that became clear within a few weeks that there </p>
<p>was a problem. We had expected to come across facilities or shells and so on, and </p>
<p>we didn’t. Therefore there was already political clamour, if you like.”</p>

<p><b>Managing public expectations</b></p>
<p><b>138.  On 21 April, Mr Straw expressed scepticism to Mr Blair about the likelihood </b></p>
<p><b>that physical evidence of Saddam Hussein’s WMD would be found.</b></p>
<p><b>139.  On 28 April, Mr Blair told the media “we can take our time about this and so </b></p>
<p><b>we should”. He expressed confidence that WMD would be found.</b></p>
<p><b>140. </b> On 21 April, Mr Straw told Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“I am very worried that, inexorably, we are being pushed into a position where we </p>
<p>accept that the war will only have been justified if a significant WMD find is made. </p>
<p>This is exactly the place where our opponents, at home and abroad, and the media </p>
<p>want us. We should not go there.</p>
<p>“The military action was justified the day we took it, on the grounds that:-</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Saddam regime had had chemical and biological weapons – we know </p>
<p>that for sure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it had failed to meet a mountain of UN obligations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a huge number of questions about its WMD position and capabilities </p>
<p>remained unanswered (Blix’s 173 page report), and Iraq simply refused to </p>
<p>co-operate properly, raising entirely legitimate issues in the minds of most </p>
<p>members of the Security Council that they had a lot to hide.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Mr Straw continued:</p>
<p>“However, I remain sceptical that physical evidence of WMD will be found:-</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam had every motive, and months of notice before the fall of Baghdad </p>
<p>to destroy all WMD evidence; so did his collaborators;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remarkably little circumstantial evidence has so far been forthcoming;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>I was struck by General Franks’ caution on this when I saw him ([Mr Colin] </p>
<p>Powell [US Secretary of State] has been dubious about finds going back to </p>
<p>last summer and I think this reflects a wide view in the US military);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Your point that our experience in Northern Ireland … shows that large arms </p>
<p>caches can be concealed for years …”</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“Yes, we did take military action in order to disarm Iraq of its WMD. But if it turns </p>
<p>out that under the pressure of the US/UK military build up, he disarmed himself, </p>
<p>so be it.”</p>
<p><b>143. </b> Mr Straw wrote that he understood that public appreciation of why military action </p>
<p>had been taken would be “enhanced” if there were “good finds”:</p>
<p>“But if we carry on saying confidently that the material is there … and have 1,000 </p>
<p>men doing nothing but search for the next six months … and still nothing is found, </p>
<p>what then? Knowing it was there is not the same as knowing it is there.”</p>
<p><b>144. </b> Mr Straw concluded that, in the absence of significant finds, it would become </p>
<p>“all the more important” to demonstrate that post-Saddam Hussein Iraq was a far better </p>
<p>place than before. He was “wondering whether the whole US Administration” really </p>
<p>appreciated the imperative of “getting the water and power back on” and the hospitals </p>
<p>working fully.</p>
<p><b>145. </b> Mr Straw said that he would call Mr Blair “to discuss all this”.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> In relation to WMD, Sir David Manning commented to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“The key is to find people not materiel – who can talk about Saddam’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes/aspirations/deceptions.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>147. </b> During the visit to London on 23 April by Mr José María Aznar, the Prime Minister </p>

<p>a dozen of the 146 suspect sites identified as a priority by the Government had  </p>
<p>been visited.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>149. </b> On third-party validation of findings, Mr Dowse reported that the UK delegation to </p>
<p>the talks:</p>
<p>“… made the point that what constituted credibility was inevitably going to be </p>
<p>subjective – ie what was sufficient for the UK and US Governments might not be </p>
<p>enough for the audiences we really need to convince, including the Security Council </p>
<p>(and UK media). Like it or not, it was hard to escape the fact that a UN seal of </p>
<p>approval would be the most difficult for the critics to dismiss …</p>
<p>“The Americans did not seriously try to argue the point, but I doubt that we entirely </p>
<p>overcame the deep reluctance – particularly in the Pentagon – to contemplate a </p>
<p>further role for UNMOVIC.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Mr Straw welcomed Mr Dowse’s advice, stating that it highlighted some of his own </p>
<p>key concerns, on which he had already written to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>75</p>

<p>be sent to Sir David Manning, and for Mr Dowse to prepare a draft minute to Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Mr Straw discussed WMD with Secretary Powell on 24 April.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> UNMOVIC was </p>
<p>rising up the agenda quickly. The US and UK had argued consistently for UNMOVIC, </p>
<p>setting it up in resolution 1284 (1999) and enhancing its role in resolution 1441 (2002). </p>
<p>Mr Straw did not see how they could now argue for it to be set aside. It was important to </p>

<p> </p>
<p>On the question: “Iraqi WMD: Where’s the evidence?”, the points made by Mr Miller </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition Forces were actively pursuing the issue but the investigation would </p>
<p>not be “a quick process”. Saddam Hussein had had “ample time to conceal his </p>
<p>WMD programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The process would be “painstaking and detailed: we want to establish the truth </p>
<p>beyond any doubt”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Given the emphasis on concealment” it was “hardly surprising that concrete </p>
<p>evidence of WMD” had “yet to come to light”.</p>

<p>The “testimony of scientists and documentation about WMD development </p>

<p>And as I say every time I am asked, I remain confident that they will be found.”</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Asked about why Saddam Hussein had not used weapons of mass destruction and </p>
<p>whether the UN needed to be involved to verify any finds, Mr Blair made a number of </p>
<p>points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Independent verification needed to be discussed “with the UN and amongst </p>
<p>allies”, but he had “no doubt at all that … some process of independent </p>
<p>verification” was needed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There wasn’t “any doubt that Iraq has had” WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Before the return of the inspectors, “there was a six-month campaign of </p>
<p>concealment”. That was “borne out by sufficient intelligence” that there was </p>
<p>“no doubt” in his mind that was what happened.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That meant it was “going to be far more difficult for them to reconstitute that </p>
<p>material to use”, and “we were giving very strong warnings to commanders in </p>
<p>the fields as to what would happen if they did”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The Government was “anxious not to start making the claims until we have </p>
<p>absolutely bottomed out anything by way of information that comes to us”.</p>
<p><b>156. </b> In response to a suggestion that WMD had not been as big a threat as he thought, </p>
<p>Mr Blair pointed out that Iraq could have reconstituted concealed weapons “had we all </p>
<p>left Iraq and the weapons inspectors not being able to carry out their job”. He added </p>
<p>that he thought there would be “increasing evidence of links between the previous Iraqi </p>
<p>regime and terrorist organisations”.</p>
<p><b>157.  On 2 May, Mr Straw sent Mr Blair further thoughts on what might be found </b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq. Evidence might take the form of testimony or documents rather than </b></p>
<p><b>materiel.</b></p>
<p><b>158.  On the role of UNMOVIC and the IAEA, Mr Straw advised that it would be </b></p>
<p><b>“odd” if the Coalition refused to co-operate with the weapons inspectors having </b></p>
<p><b>made that the centrepiece of the case against Saddam Hussein.</b></p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Straw wrote again to Mr Blair on 2 May reiterating his concerns that the </p>
<p>plans for handling the detection and elimination of Iraqi WMD “should not become the </p>
<p>foundation on which critics of our military action in Iraq” could “build a new case to </p>
<p>attack us”.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Mr Straw welcomed the action being taken to impress on commanders in Iraq </p>
<p>the importance of the issue and that work was in hand to identify a substantial UK </p>
<p>contribution to the ISG. But the timeframe for ISG deployment highlighted the need to </p>
<p>manage expectations:</p>
<p>“This is not a matter of suggesting that we may not, in the event, find any evidence </p>
<p>of WMD programmes. On the contrary, as you told the media on 28 April, we are </p>
<p>confident that we will. But we must keep drumming home three messages:</p>
<p>–  </p>
<p>we already have substantial evidence: both from before the fighting and </p>
<p>what we have discovered since. There is 173 pages of evidence in Blix’s </p>
<p>7 March report. Examples since include the discoveries of large stockpiles </p>
<p>of protective suits and atropine: Coalition forces were well known not to </p>
<p>possess chemical weapons, so what reason would Iraq have had for such </p>
<p>stockpiles other than to protect its forces against its own chemical weapons?</p>
<p>–  </p>
<p>this will not be a quick process. Saddam has had twelve years to hide the </p>
<p>evidence and it is unreasonable to expect us to uncover it in a few weeks. </p>
<p>We should be stressing that the process of discovery and validation cannot </p>
<p>be rushed: we must be extremely thorough to minimise the risk of false </p>
<p>alarms …</p>
<p>–  </p>
<p>evidence can take many forms. It may well not be in the form of finished </p>
<p>materiel (stockpiles of munitions, barrels of nerve agent etc); it is equally if </p>

<p>not more likely to come in the form of testimony from scientists and other </p>
<p>Iraqi personnel, and documentation. That sort of evidence is no less valid.”</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Straw noted MOD concern that the last point “might be interpreted as moving </p>
<p>the goalposts”. It needed “to be deployed with care”, but it was “not new”. It was “why </p>
<p>we placed such emphasis on the UN inspectors conducting secure interviews”. In </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s view, it carried “more weight than the claim raised in some US newspapers </p>
<p>that the Iraqis may have destroyed their WMD in the days immediately prior to the war. </p>
<p>For that to carry any credibility at all it would have to be backed with very convincing </p>
<p>evidence of such destruction.”</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Mr Straw recommended that the UK should, more realistically for the medium </p>
<p>rather than the short term, continue to try “to change US minds” about credible </p>
<p>independent validation of WMD discoveries by UNMOVIC or the IAEA. Dr Blix would </p>
<p>“retire from the scene in June” and the task had:</p>
<p>“… now changed, to one essentially of observation and reporting. Coalition forces </p>
<p>will do the detective work. But the fact is that the inspectors still carry the most </p>
<p>weight with the audiences we need to convince, in the Security Council or the media. </p>
<p>It would be odd if the Coalition was now to refuse to co-operate with the weapons </p>
<p>inspectors after we made this a centrepiece of our case against Saddam.”</p>

<p>that Mr Blair say that: “suitably reconstituted – UN inspectors would confer maximum </p>

<p>Rumsfeld returned to the US.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>168. </b> Mr Hoon said that the UK had not seen significant output from the debriefing </p>
<p>of high-value individuals and scientists. There could be information emerging that </p>
<p>was of operational use and should be shared with commanders on the ground. </p>
<p>Secretary Rumsfeld agreed that this was an area that could be improved.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Mr Straw raised verification with Mr Richard Armitage, US Deputy Secretary of </p>
<p>State, on 6 May.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> The key question was: “did the US want UNMOVIC back in?” The </p>
<p>issue could not be sidestepped indefinitely. Mr Armitage said that he was not keen.</p>
<p><b>170. </b> In discussion at the AHMGIR on 8 May, Mr Hoon stated that, given the role WMD </p>
<p>had played in the justification for action against Saddam Hussein, it would be important </p>
<p>to link any finds back to the pre-conflict evidence.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>171. </b> Other points made were that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Military action was justified by the continued failure of the Iraqi Government to </p>
<p>meet its obligations set out in UN resolutions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the UK Government faced criticism if further WMD were not found, the </p>
<p>response should be that Saddam Hussein could have avoided war by, for </p>
<p>example, delivering scientists.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the Security Council had held together, there might not have been a need for war.</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Straw concluded that it would be some time before WMD investigation would </p>

<p>A paper prepared by the MOD on 3 May, for the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>

<p>[heavy goods vehicle] trailer” near Irbil where an “initial assessment” closely matched </p>
<p>“earlier descriptions (from intelligence) of a vehicle that supported mobile BW agent </p>
<p>production”.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>The discovery of a “BW factory” was discussed in Mr Blair’s conversation with </p>
<p>President Bush on 7 May.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>The British Embassy Washington reported overnight on 7/8 May that the US had used </p>
<p>a general briefing on Iraqi WMD by Mr Cambone to address growing press speculation </p>
<p>about the discovery of the suspected mobile BW laboratory.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>Mr Cambone had emphasised the scale and complexity of the task facing the Coalition in </p>
<p>uncovering and destroying Iraq’s WMD, and explained that the resources deployed would </p>
<p>be “substantially enhanced” with the arrival of the ISG.</p>
<p>Mr Cambone said that the mobile laboratory was “very similar” to that which had been </p>
<p>described in Secretary Powell’s presentation to the Security Council on 5 February 2003, </p>
<p>and that, while some of the equipment on the trailer could have been used for purposes </p>
<p>other than BW production, “US and UK technical experts have concluded that the unit </p>
<p>does not appear to perform any function beyond what the defector said it was for, which </p>
<p>was the production of biological agents”.</p>
<p>Asked whether the trailer represented the smoking gun, Mr Cambone had stated that he </p>
<p>was sure that, as time went by, Iraq’s WMD programmes would be found to have been as </p>
<p>extensive as described to the Security Council by Secretary Powell in February 2003.</p>
<p>The Embassy added that it had raised the need for independent third-party verification </p>
<p>of the find with the National Security Council (NSC) earlier in the day. Although that </p>
<p>suggestion had been rejected on the grounds that it was highly unlikely that samples </p>
<p>worth verifying would be found in a trailer that had been scrubbed clean, the principle of </p>
<p>third-party verification, once samples had been found, was recognised as “a good one”.</p>
<p>The SIS letter of 9 May described the suspect BW trailer as “an encouraging find” that </p>
<p>would be reinforced through exploitation of other related leads in co-operation with other </p>
<p>Coalition officials.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>The briefing note attached to the letter stated that the suspect BW trailer “remained the </p>
<p>most significant find to date” and had received some media attention. There were differing </p>
<p>views on the function of the trailer, however, it was believed to be part of a transportable </p>
<p>production system (TPS). SIS would be contributing to the Coalition efforts to investigate </p>
<p>the trailer’s provenance, with the aim of obtaining “a high-level view of how it related to </p>
<p>other parts of the BW programme”. There was speculation about whether anthrax was the </p>
<p>original intended product. Further debriefing and computer exploitation were ongoing.</p>

<p>On 13 May, Mr Scarlett informed Mr Powell that a “second possible mobile BW trailer” </p>
<p>had been found in Northern Iraq on 9 May; and that imagery indicated “a third suspicious </p>
<p>trailer in the Mosul area”.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett wrote:</p>
<p>“It is not yet clear whether we will be able to prove that these trailers were used </p>
<p>for BW agent production … But our assessment is that the first trailer at least (and </p>
<p>probably the second) were capable of producing micro-organisms as part of a </p>
<p>biological process … It is not impossible that they are capable of producing a crude </p>
<p>(liquid) form of agent …”</p>
<p>“A great deal of thought has been given to other possible applications for these </p>
<p>trailers. So far none has been identified …”</p>
<p>Mr Scarlett added that “our experts” had ruled out the possibility that the first trailer might </p>
<p>have been part of a mobile pesticide unit.</p>
<p>Mr Scarlett concluded:</p>
<p>“These are significant finds. There is a serious chance (I should not put it more </p>
<p>strongly) that the trailers form part of the covert production facilities for which we have </p>
<p>been looking. Whatever their function … [they] should have been declared under …  </p>
<p>[resolution] 1441. At the right moment, and once we have reached the firmest  </p>
<p>judgement possible … it will be necessary to explain their significance …”</p>
<p>Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“This is good + we should keep a careful note of all we are finding. How are the </p>
<p>interviews going?”</p>

<p>Mr Scarlett also provided a more detailed note produced by the DIS and a minute </p>
<p>addressing claims made on <i>NBC News,</i> which could not be substantiated and appeared to </p>
<p>be based on the views of Dr David Kay. Dr Kay was described as “formerly nuclear Chief </p>

<p>On 15 May, an official in the FCO Non-Proliferation Department (NPD) advised  </p>
<p>Mr Tim Dowse, Head of NPD, that Dr David Kelly, MOD Special Adviser Counter-</p>

<p>101</p>
<p> The FCO official was </p>
<p>concerned about the implications of Dr Blix casting doubt on the UK’s analysis.</p>
<p>SIS stated on 16 May that the most important piece of evidence found so far was “the </p>

<p>Mr Scarlett added that a preliminary draft of the team’s report had stated that the trailers, </p>
<p>as presently configured, could not be used as a biological production system. That report </p>
<p>had been withdrawn. Mr Scarlett commented: “It really does seem that it has no status. </p>
<p>Confusing nonetheless.”</p>
<p>Mr Scarlett concluded that there would be a further assessment of Iraq’s BW capabilities, </p>
<p>but a formal assessment could and should be issued only when “we feel confident that we </p>
<p>have enough data”.</p>
<p>Subsequent assessments of the purpose of the trailers are set out later in this Section.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s two most senior BW scientists were denying knowledge of recent Iraqi </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The head of Iraq’s National Monitoring Directorate was claiming that all SCUD </p>
<p>missiles had been destroyed between 1991 and 1993.</p>

<p>There was “considerable frustration” about the absence of UK involvement in </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>464</p>
<p><b>193. </b> On the search for evidence, the letter stated:</p>
<p>“People who are prepared to discuss WMD are gradually emerging to provide </p>
<p>information. Most have only small pieces of the jigsaw, but these do confirm some of </p>
<p>the original judgements: continued CW production until mid-late 2002; replacement </p>
<p>of the large, static BW programme with a covert, transportable capacity; a massive </p>
<p>effort in the months before the conflict to break up and conceal much of the WMD </p>
<p>(which may thus have been inaccessible when the conflict began); the start of work </p>
<p>to develop extended range missiles, beyond UN-sanctioned limits; and the highly </p>
<p>restricted circle of those really in the know. Further interviewing of senior detainees </p>
<p>is likely to deliver more insights …”</p>
<p><b>194. </b> SIS assessed that the most important piece of evidence found so far was “the </p>
<p>various BW trailers, which we are now firmly of the view are part of the transportable </p>
<p>production system (TPS) for BW agent”. New information was also emerging on Iraq’s </p>
<p>CW and missile programmes.</p>
<p><b>195. </b> The letter stated that, despite the emergence of new information, the UK and </p>
<p>international media continued to report that there was no evidence to justify the claims </p>
<p>made by the UK and the US before the war. It was not in the interests of the Government </p>
<p>or SIS to allow that to become received wisdom. SIS was working on a media strategy </p>
<p>with the FCO, the MOD and others to address those points.</p>
<p><b>196. </b> SIS also reported that <i>BBC Television</i>’s <i>Panorama</i> planned to make a programme </p>
<p>on Iraqi WMD for broadcast later that year. SIS suggested that the Government provide </p>
<p>assistance to the programme-maker while taking care not to hijack the programme. </p>
<p>The onus would still be on the programme-maker to seek independent expert advice. </p>
<p>SIS advised that there was a greater risk in the programme being made without the </p>
<p>Government’s help, and that the programme-maker “might take at face value the denials </p>
<p>of senior detainees and be without the technical knowledge and guidance we can offer”.</p>
<p><b>197. </b> A copy of the SIS letter was shown to Mr Blair by Sir David Manning, with the </p>
<p>comment: “Evidence beginning to build. Suggestions here too for media – that need to </p>
<p>be reviewed with Alastair [Campbell]”.</p>

<p>progress in uncovering hard evidence of prohibited Iraqi weapons programmes on </p>

<p> He agreed:</p>
<p>“… that we have pro-actively to confront some of the negative media about the lack </p>
<p>of Iraqi WMD, and work to ensure that some of the evidence that is coming to light </p>
<p>finds its way into the public domain. Or, as you say, the media will remain camped </p>
<p>on the position of No evidence, No justification. In the absence of independent </p>
<p>validation of Coalition WMD finds, the media are playing a crucial role in setting </p>
<p>public opinion. Having an effective media strategy, agreed interdepartmentally, will </p>
<p>help address this …”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr McDonald added:</p>
<p>“The idea of working with the <i>BBC Panorama</i> programme … seems an excellent </p>
<p>way to take the strategy forward in the short term. Providing background briefing and </p>
<p>unobtrusively helping point the programme makers in the right direction […] should </p>
<p>help to bring to light some of the hard evidence that is being uncovered. It will be </p>
<p>important to ensure that <i>Panorama </i>maintains its overall independence … However, </p>

<p><b>207. </b> Mr Howard added that there was:</p>
<p>“… growing pressure for the Government to provide an assessment of how the </p>

<p>No.10 have made accommodating statements on this: the US are understood to </p>
<p>be undertaking their own ‘post-mortem’ exercise in this area. There have been </p>
<p>problems that US briefings … are not properly cleared with us …”</p>
<p><b>208. </b> Mr Howard stated that there was a need for urgent work to develop a coherent PR </p>

<p><b>211. </b> Mr Watkins reported that the US was planning to expand and better co-ordinate </p>
<p>the existing Coalition effort by bringing together current WMD and other post-conflict </p>

<p>“Organise, direct and apply capabilities and expertise in Iraq to discover, take </p>

<p>more work on public handling. There had been problems with US briefings in theatre </p>
<p>and in Washington not being properly cleared with the UK. The UK had taken steps to </p>
<p>ensure co-ordination was as good as possible. There was also a more general need for </p>

<p><b>234. </b> In its advice on UK plans for third-party verification, the FCO stated that the media </p>
<p>would “provide some independent witnesses for finds in Iraq” but, “without independent </p>
<p>validation”, the Coalition might “well be accused of planting evidence”.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> UN validation, </p>
<p>ideally by UNMOVIC inspectors, would carry the most weight where it really mattered </p>
<p>to the UK, in the Security Council and with UK media. Ideally, the UK would like to give </p>
<p>UNMOVIC inspectors access to any relevant finds. At the least, the Coalition should </p>
<p>undertake to provide a full report of its investigation to the UN, including any test results.</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The FCO added that the US remained “neuralgic” on UNMOVIC. Officials  </p>
<p>were seeking to engage with the US to revitalise and reform UNMOVIC when  </p>
<p>Dr Blix’s contract expired on 25 June. US officials had not yet replied to a UK paper on </p>
<p>restructuring UNMOVIC passed to them on 20 May. The US had, however, agreed that </p>
<p>IAEA experts could check the security of a store of radioactive material.</p>
<p><b>236. </b> The FCO was examining other options for independent validation, including using </p>
<p>a laboratory in the Netherlands to test CBW samples, but the Dutch wanted UN cover </p>
<p>for doing so.</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair that UNMOVIC would be the most credible </p>
<p>option for verification, but the US would “not permit that, at least not without a new </p>
<p>leadership/mandate/organisation”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>238. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that comments from US media </p>
<p>and prominent Senators were largely sympathetic to the US Government.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> Most </p>
<p>had argued that it was too early to draw conclusions, but some were calling for an </p>
<p>independent inquiry into US intelligence on Iraqi WMD.</p>
<p><b>239. </b> The Embassy also reported that the Chairmen of the Senate Armed Services and </p>
<p>Intelligence Committees had agreed to conduct a joint inquiry into the pre-conflict use </p>
<p>of intelligence by the US Administration. In addition, the White House was “crafting a </p>
<p>line” on whether there should be an independent inquiry. The Embassy had “strongly </p>
<p>encouraged” that it should be discussed in advance with the UK.</p>
<p><b>240. </b> Mr Rycroft reported to Mr Blair that the two US Committees were “part of the </p>
<p>normal Congressional oversight of the Administration”.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> The first hearing would be </p>
<p>later in June.</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Mr Rycroft also told Mr Blair that:</p>

<p>presentation [on 5 February 2003]. This is in response to a request from the </p>
<p>House [of Representatives] Intelligence Committee. Congressional Committees </p>
<p>do not normally have access to raw intelligence, but they have done occasionally </p>
<p>in the past: […]”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Campbell recorded in his diaries that he had spoken to Mr Powell on 3 June </p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>“… agreed a way forward was for the ISC to trail an inquiry before T[ony] B[lair] </p>
<p>formally announced it and John S[carlett] to make clear nothing improper took place.”</p>
<p>139</p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Campbell also sent Mr Blair a note advising that Parliamentary debates on Iraq </p>
<p>on 4 June were :</p>
<p>“… about both the substance of the issue and the manner in which you deal with it. </p>
<p>The overall aim must be to give explanation and context, calm the frenzy, and regain </p>
<p>support for our basic position …”</p>
<p>140</p>
<p><b>244. </b> In relation to the substance, Mr Campbell wrote:</p>
<p>“… the current frenzy flows from the fact that apart from the two mobile labs nothing </p>
<p>new has been found … so tomorrow is in part about saying as much as you can </p>
<p>about the process towards discovery … The fact there are other more pressing </p>
<p>issues – security, humanitarian, basic services – is relevant …</p>
<p>“What reasonable MPs will want is a signal that you understand the nature of the </p>
<p>concern. We’ve had a week essentially of saying people are being ridiculous … but it </p>
<p>won’t go away … [A]s WMD was the stated reason for war, people want to know the </p>
<p>full story, and that you set out the process as to how they’re going to get it.”</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Campbell added:</p>
<p>“The second issue relates to the intelligence services, and in particular the false </p>
<p>charge that we wrongly used intelligence material, or asked the Agencies to do </p>
<p>something they should not have, or that they were not happy with … [T]he media, </p>
<p>particularly the <i>BBC</i>, are trying to create a ‘no smoke without fire’ atmosphere.”</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that the views of Mr Scarlett and others “that nothing improper </p>
<p>took place – should be made public forcefully”. He recommended Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… say that, in the light of the controversy, you asked the JIC to set out for you </p>
<p>a detailed analysis of the dossier from inception to publication, and as result not </p>
<p>only you, but more importantly the JIC, are 100 percent clear that nothing wrong </p>
<p>took place.”</p>

<p><b>247. </b> The dossier had been:</p>
<p>“… drafted and redrafted by the JIC … in consultation with Allies. It was presented </p>
<p>to No.10 as a JIC document and remains so. Obviously there were discussions with </p>
<p>No.10, not least because you were writing a foreword and you were going to be </p>
<p>presenting it to Parliament. But these discussions related primarily to your frontpiece </p>
<p>printing, briefing materials, preparation of Q&amp;A, in other words the normal stuff of </p>
<p>presentation.”</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Mr Campbell stated that that part of the response would give Mr Blair:</p>

<p><b>249. </b> The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) announced on 3 June </p>
<p>that it would hold an inquiry into “The Decision to go to War in Iraq”.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> The FAC stated:</p>
<p>“The inquiry will consider whether the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, within the </p>
<p>Government as a whole, presented accurate and complete information to Parliament </p>
<p>in the period leading up to military action in Iraq, particularly in relation to Iraq’s </p>
<p>weapons of mass destruction. The Committee will hear oral evidence from several </p>

<p>Section 4.2, concluded:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>House of Commons debates on Iraq, 4 June 2003</b></p>
<p><b>252.  The House of Commons held two debates on Iraq on 4 June.</b></p>
<p><b>253.  During the second debate, the House of Commons rejected an Opposition </b></p>
<p><b>motion calling for an independent inquiry into the use of intelligence.</b></p>
<p><b>254.  Iraq was also raised during PMQs and in response to Mr Blair’s statement </b></p>
<p><b>about the G8 summit in Evian, France, from 1 to 3 June.</b></p>
<p><b>255.  During the exchanges on Iraq on 4 June, MPs raised repeatedly:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the failure to find WMD in Iraq;</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>statements made by the Government before the conflict about the </b></p>
<p><b>intelligence on Iraq’s capabilities and intent; and</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>the need for an independent, judge-led, inquiry.</b></p>
<p><b>256.  Mr Blair told the House of Commons that:</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>It was “accepted” by the international community and the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>that Saddam Hussein had possessed WMD and had been “a threat to the </b></p>
<p><b>world”.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>He welcomed the ISC inquiry into the role of intelligence in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>There had been no attempt at any time to override “the intelligence </b></p>
<p><b>judgements” of the JIC.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The ISG had “just gone into Iraq” and “should be allowed to get on with </b></p>
<p><b>its job”.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>He had “no doubt” that the ISG would find “the clearest evidence” of </b></p>
<p><b>Saddam Hussein’s WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>The alternative thesis, that Saddam Hussein had decided to get rid of the </b></p>
<p><b>WMD, was difficult to accept.</b></p>
<p><b>257. </b> In the first House of Commons debate on Iraq on 4 June, Ms Joan Ruddock </p>
<p>(Labour) and Dr Jenny Tonge (Liberal Democrat) called for the urgent return of UN </p>
<p>inspectors. Dr Tonge expressed concern about the danger of WMD, if it existed, being </p>
<p>found and used.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>258. </b> During PMQs Mr Blair was asked a series of questions about Iraq.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>475</p>
<p><b>259. </b> In response to a question from Ms Oona King (Labour) about the “strong </p>
<p>presumption” of the UN inspectors that Saddam Hussein had not destroyed biological </p>
<p>and chemical agents and his view of the allegations that the threat had been </p>
<p>exaggerated, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… that it was accepted by the entire international community, and not least by </p>
<p>the UN Security Council, that Saddam Hussein did indeed have weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction and was a threat to the world … [T]he Iraq Survey Group … is literally </p>
<p>now just beginning its work, because the priority after the conflict was to rebuild Iraq </p>
<p>and to make sure that the humanitarian concerns of the Iraqi people were achieved.”</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“Perhaps I can now take this opportunity to inform the House that the Intelligence </p>
<p>and Security Committee … contacted the Government in early May to conduct an </p>
<p>inquiry into the role of intelligence in Iraq. I welcome this and I can assure the House </p>
<p>that the Government will co-operate fully with it.”</p>
<p><b>261. </b> Asked by Mr Iain Duncan Smith, the Leader of the Opposition, about remarks </p>
<p>made by Dr John Reid, the Leader of the House, during an interview on the <i>BBC</i>’s<i> </i></p>
<p><i>Today</i> programme, that “rogue elements within the intelligence services are undermining </p>
<p>the Government and their numbers are growing”, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“It is obvious from what the <i>Today </i>programme has said – if that source is to </p>
<p>be believed – that of course there was somebody from within the intelligence </p>
<p>community who spoke to the media. But I want to say that the security services and </p>
<p>intelligence services do a superb job …”</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Asked how senior he thought the people making the allegations were and </p>
<p>how many of them there were, Mr Blair told Mr Duncan Smith that the source was </p>
<p>anonymous, but he:</p>
<p>“… did not believe that the person who is talking is a member of the Joint </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee and … I have spoken and conferred with the Chairman of the </p>
<p>… Committee – that there was no attempt, at any time, by any official, or Minister, </p>
<p>or member of No.10 Downing Street staff, to override the intelligence judgements of </p>
<p>the Joint Intelligence Committee. That includes the judgement about the so-called </p>
<p>45 minutes [see Section 4.2]. It was a judgement made by the Joint Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee and by that committee alone.”</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Referring again to the allegations made by Dr Reid, and allegations from others </p>
<p>that Mr Blair had “misled Parliament and the country”, Mr Duncan Smith asked  </p>
<p>Mr Blair to publish “the dossier given to him by the JIC before the one that he published </p>
<p>in September”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>476</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“In relation to all those issues, the Intelligence and Security Committee is at full </p>
<p>liberty to go through all the Joint Intelligence Committee assessments and produce a </p>
<p>report on them. Because of the importance of the issue, it is only right that a report is </p>
<p>published so that people can make a judgement on it. However the claims that have </p>
<p>been made are simply false …”</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr Duncan Smith stated that Mr Blair would allow the ISC to see “only the </p>
<p>intelligence reports that he wanted it to see” and that, as the Committee was being </p>
<p>“asked to investigate the Prime Minister’s role and that of his closest advisers … surely </p>
<p>the only way to clear up the problem is to have an independent inquiry”.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Blair replied that Mr Duncan Smith:</p>
<p>“… was not making an allegation about the intelligence being wrong. On the </p>
<p>contrary, he was rebutting the allegation that the intelligence was wrong … it </p>
<p>is not true that I will withhold from it [the ISC] the Joint Intelligence Committee </p>
<p>assessments. In addition, the Committee can, in accordance with its normal practice, </p>
<p>interview those people in the security services who drew up the JIC reports. That is </p>
<p>surely a fair way to proceed. I will then publish the report.”</p>
<p><b>267. </b> In response to further questioning from Mr Duncan Smith, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I have already said that we will produce all the evidence for the Intelligence and </p>
<p>Security Committee. I really think that is the sensible and right way to proceed. It can </p>
<p>then come to a considered judgement and I will publish the report.”</p>
<p><b>268. </b> Mr Blair also rebutted the allegation that the source for “the 45 minute claim  </p>
<p>was an Iraqi defector of dubious reliability”, stating that “he was an established and </p>
<p>reliable source”.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Addressing a question from Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, </p>
<p>about why people should allow more time and show patience in the search for WMD, </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… The reason I ask people to be patient is that the group has just gone into Iraq: it </p>
<p>should be allowed to get on with its job, investigate the sites, interview the witnesses </p>
<p>and then report back to us.”</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Mr Kennedy also asked for “a fully independent judicial review of what has just </p>
<p>gone on”.</p>
<p><b>271. </b> Mr Elfyn Llwyd (Plaid Cymru) also called for “a full public inquiry”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>477</p>
<p><b>272. </b> During his subsequent statement about the G8 summit in Evian, France, from  </p>
<p>1 to 3 June, Mr Blair was asked repeatedly about the search for WMD and to consider </p>
<p>an independent inquiry.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p><b>273. </b> In response to Mr Duncan Smith, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“… the Iraq Survey Group is the body that will be able to … interview the scientists </p>
<p>and visit the sites. There are literally thousands of sites … information is coming up </p>
<p>the entire time, but it is only now … that a dedicated team of people, which includes </p>
<p>former UN inspectors … will be able to go in and do the job properly … I have </p>
<p>no doubt that they will find the clearest evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction.</p>
<p>“The alternative thesis is that, having for years obstructed the UN, having had 12 </p>
<p>years of sanctions, having kicked out the inspectors in 1998, and having invited </p>
<p>an invasion by defying the UN, Saddam decided to get rid of the weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction anyway. That is an odd thesis to accept.”</p>
<p><b>274. </b> Referring to the press reporting of remarks made by Secretary Rumsfeld and </p>
<p>Mr Wolfowitz, Mr Blair added that the full transcripts of the interviews showed they were </p>
<p>“arguing that it will be difficult to say exactly what has happened to the weapons until we </p>
<p>collect the evidence”; and that it had always been the UK Government’s case that there </p>
<p>had been “a systematic campaign of concealment once Saddam knew the inspectors </p>
<p>were going back in”.</p>
<p><b>275. </b> In response to points raised by Mr Ken Clarke (Conservative), including on the </p>
<p>wider consequences if it turned out that the Government’s assertion that military force </p>
<p>was needed to disarm Iraq turned out not to be true, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… the basis on which we went to conflict was that in resolution 1441, Iraq was given </p>
<p>a final chance to comply … and the conclusion that we drew six months later was </p>
<p>that it was not doing so. The problem in the UN Security Council is that we could </p>
<p>not get agreement even to the fact that, if it [Iraq] carried on not complying fully </p>
<p>and unconditionally … we could take action. That was obviously an unacceptable </p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>“… I stand entirely by the dossier that we issued and the intelligence contained in </p>
<p>it … When we get a proper and fully documented account of what it [the ISG] has </p>
<p>found, we will present it … [It] would be sensible to suspend our judgement until that </p>
<p>time, but I stand fully by what our intelligence agencies put out …”</p>
<p><b>276. </b> Asked by Ms Barbara Follett (Labour) about the role of the UN, Mr Blair stated that </p>
<p>“for obvious reasons there will have to be some independent verification” at the end of </p>
<p>the process; and that was being discussed by Mr Straw with his counterparts.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>277. </b> Asked by Mr Brian H Donohoe (Labour) if he would allow the Foreign Affairs </p>
<p>Committee to have the same access to the evidence and witnesses as the ISC, Mr Blair </p>
<p>stated that “it would not be sensible to have two inquiries competing”.</p>
<p><b>278. </b> Asked by Mr Denzil Davies (Labour) whether the “failure of the Coalition to look </p>
<p>for” weapons of mass destruction “as a matter of the highest priority in the immediate </p>
<p>aftermath of the war could well have provided the opportunity for many of the weapons – </p>
<p>if they are there – to find their way into the hands of the various terrorist groups that are </p>
<p>operating in and around the Middle East”, Mr Blair replied that that was a crucial issue </p>
<p>but he did not think it was wrong:</p>
<p>“… for the Coalition to have said that our first priority at the end of the conflict … had </p>
<p>to be reconstruction and the humanitarian position of the Iraqi people. Indeed we </p>
<p>would have been criticised roundly if we had not done so.”</p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Blair’s statement about the G8 summit was followed by a second debate </p>
<p>on Iraq.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>280. </b> The Liberal Democrat motion tabled for the debate stated:</p>
<p>“That this House recalls the Prime Minister’s assertion that Iraq possessed weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction capable of being used at 45 minutes’ notice; further recalls </p>
<p>the Government’s contention that these weapons posed an imminent danger to </p>
<p>the United Kingdom and its forces; notes that to date no such weapons have been </p>
<p>found; and calls for an independent inquiry into the handling of the intelligence </p>
<p>received, its assessment and the decisions made by Ministers based upon it.”</p>
<p><b>281. </b> In his speech opening the debate, Mr Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Spokesperson, set out in detail his interpretation of the case which had </p>
<p>been made by the Government before the conflict; questioned whether military action </p>
<p>was “truly a last resort” and if action to bring an end to the regime of Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>was proportionate; and set out the rationale for an independent Inquiry which would be </p>
<p>answerable to the public, “not just to the Prime Minister or the House”.</p>
<p><b>282. </b> The Government tabled an amendment to the Liberal Democrat motion stating </p>
<p>that the ISC was “the appropriate body to carry out any Inquiry into intelligence relating </p>
<p>to Iraq” and asking the House to note the terms of resolution 1483 “in relation to Iraq’s </p>
<p>disarmament obligations”, which had been adopted while Parliament was in recess.</p>
<p><b>283. </b> In his speech in support of the amendment, which addressed a wide range of </p>
<p>issues, not just WMD, Mr Straw stated that the Government had not, so far as he was </p>
<p>aware, used some of the words in the Liberal Democrat motion. It had not referred to </p>
<p>Iraq’s weapons posing an “imminent danger”; it had:</p>
<p>“… talked about a threat to international peace and security, as had the </p>
<p>United Nations.”</p>

<p><b>284. </b> Mr Straw also stated that the September 2002 dossier had said “that Iraq’s military </p>
<p>planning allowed for some of the weapons of mass destruction to be readied within 45 </p>
<p>minutes of an order to use them”.</p>
<p><b>285. </b> Subsequently, Mr Straw said that the Foreword was:</p>
<p>“… subject to discussion and agreement from the head of the JIC to ensure, plainly </p>
<p>that what was in the Foreword was entirely consistent with what was in the body of </p>
<p>the document.”</p>
<p><b>286. </b> Asked by Mr Michael Portillo (Conservative) whether “any intelligence officers” </p>
<p>had remonstrated with Mr Blair or any other Minister that the 45 minutes point should </p>
<p>not have been included in the Foreword to the dossier, because it was based only on a </p>
<p>single source, Mr Straw replied “no”.</p>
<p><b>287. </b> Pressed by Mr Robin Cook (Labour) to acknowledge that the policy of containment </p>
<p>had been successful and that the statement was wrong because no weapons ready for </p>
<p>use within 45 minutes had been found in Iraq, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“I do not accept that, because we have not yet been able to find physical evidence of </p>
<p>the possession of such weapons, these weapons did not therefore exist. That flies in </p>
<p>the face of all the other evidence …”</p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr Straw stated that the 45 minutes point was not “a key factor in the decision to </p>
<p>go to war”, and “The basis for action was not an intelligence dossier that had been put </p>
<p>before the House six months before”.</p>
<p><b>289. </b> In response to an intervention from Mr Kennedy pointing out what Mr Blair had </p>
<p>said in his speech to the House on 24 September about Iraq’s WMD programmes, </p>
<p>Mr Straw stated that the international community had judged that Iraq posed a threat to </p>
<p>international peace and security and it was:</p>
<p>“… impossible to explain Saddam’s behaviour unless he had weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction.</p>
<p>“Dr Blix is just about to publish a further report … The chief weapon inspector said </p>
<p>that Baghdad had supplied his team with increasingly detailed information but that: </p>
<p>even at the end, Iraq failed to allay suspicions that it had something to hide, and </p>
<p>its trend of withholding pertinent information meant that the suspicions mounted </p>
<p>and mounted.</p>
<p>“That was true for Dr Blix and it was also true for the Security Council … It is </p>
<p>impossible to read those reports [from the inspectors to the Security Council] and </p>
<p>to set them against the evidence of Saddam’s behaviour without coming to the </p>
<p>conclusion that, in Dr Blix’s words, there was a strong presumption for the holding </p>
<p>of those weapons.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>480</p>
<p><b>290. </b> In the concluding section of his speech, Mr Straw asked the critics of the </p>
<p>Government:</p>
<p>“… whether they seriously believed that when Saddam Hussein chose confrontation </p>
<p>rather than co-operation, he possessed no weapons of mass destruction following </p>
<p>our decision on 18 March? Do they seriously argue that Saddam had disposed of all </p>
<p>his poisons and toxins and missiles, and then deliberately chosen not to prove their </p>
<p>destruction but to go down a path that led to his downfall? …</p>
<p>“Even if we make the most extreme allowances … how can we possibly believe </p>
<p>that he cheated and deceived the international community year after year, until we </p>
<p>had no option but military action, and yet that he possessed no weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction?</p>
<p>“… Is it not more likely that Saddam, knowing the game was up and realising that </p>
<p>we meant what we said, went to extraordinary lengths to dismantle, conceal and </p>
<p>disperse the weapons and any evidence of their existence? … Saddam had spent </p>
<p>years perfecting the art of concealment and carried that out so completely that it will </p>
<p>take some time to search hundreds of sites, interview thousands of scientists and </p>
<p>locate and evaluate what remains of the documentary and physical evidence.”</p>
<p><b>291. </b> In his speech, Mr Michael Ancram, the Shadow Foreign Secretary, referred to five </p>
<p>questions posed by Mr Duncan Smith in a letter to Mr Blair the previous day.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> The questions posed by Mr Ancram can be summarised as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether the dossier’s original conclusion had been deleted and a new </p>
<p>preamble, reportedly written by the Prime Minister, inserted?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the 45 minutes point was not significant, why did the information appear </p>
<p>three times in the dossier; why had Mr Blair referred to it in his speech on </p>
<p>24 September 2002; and was it usual to use single-source intelligence?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A request for a “categorical assurance that there was no disagreement between </p>
<p>Downing Street and the intelligence Services on the handling of intelligence </p>
<p>information”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was the new, but so far unpublished, information referred to by Mr Blair in </p>
<p>an interview on 1 June?</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Mr Ancram stated that the Opposition proposed:</p>
<p>“… a resolution in both Houses of Parliament under the Tribunals of Inquiry </p>
<p>(Evidence) Act 1921. That is the most powerful form of inquiry and is appropriate for </p>
<p>an issue of this gravity. The tribunal would be chaired by a senior judge …”</p>
<p><b>294. </b> Mr Ancram also made clear that such an inquiry was required to address the way </p>
<p>intelligence had been used. It was “not about the justification for action in Iraq; nor … </p>
<p>about the conduct of that action”.</p>

<p><b>296.  Demands for an independent judge-led inquiry persisted through the </b></p>
<p><b>summer.</b></p>
<p><b>297. </b> Responding to a question from Mr Kennedy at PMQs on 18 June about whether </p>
<p>the Government had been told by SIS that Iraq did not possess WMD “capable of posing </p>
<p>a direct threat to British security”, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“The intelligence that we put out in the dossier last September described absolutely </p>
<p>accurately the position of the Government … that Saddam was indeed a threat to his </p>
<p>region and the wider world. I always made it clear that the issue was not whether he </p>
<p>was about to launch an immediate strike on Britain: the issue was whether he posed </p>
<p>a threat to his region and to the wider world.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>298. </b> Asked by Mr Kennedy whether he thought the issue could be “adequately </p>
<p>investigated by a Foreign Affairs Committee to which he refuses to give evidence and </p>
<p>a Joint Intelligence Committee which he controls”, and whether there could not be “a </p>
<p>proper independent judicial inquiry”, Mr Blair stated that the ISC was “entirely capable of </p>
<p>investigating all the facts and getting to the truth”.</p>

<p><b>301. </b> In presenting the report to the Council on 5 June, Dr Blix highlighted a number of </p>
<p>points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Commission had not at any time “found evidence of the continuation or </p>
<p>resumption of programmes of weapons of mass destruction or significant </p>
<p>quantities of proscribed items”, whether from pre-1991 or later.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That did “not necessarily mean that such items could not exist. They might”. </p>
<p>Long lists of items remained “unaccounted for”, but it was “not justified to jump </p>
<p>to the conclusion that something exists just because it is unaccounted for”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The list of unaccounted for items had “not been shortened by inspections or Iraqi </p>
<p>declarations, explanations or documentation”; and it was Iraq’s task to convince </p>
<p>the inspectors that the items did not exist. Without that, the international </p>

<p>community could not “have confidence that past programmes or any remaining </p>
<p>part of them have been terminated”. An “effective presence of international </p>
<p>inspectors” would, however, “serve as a deterrent against efforts aimed at </p>
<p>reactivating or developing new programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had “made considerable efforts to provide explanations, to begin inquiries </p>
<p>and to undertake exploration and excavations” during the month and a half </p>
<p>before UNMOVIC’s withdrawal.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [T]hose efforts did not bring the answers needed … We did not have </p>
<p>time to interview the large number of persons who were said by Iraq to have </p>
<p>participated in the unilateral destruction of biological and chemical weapons </p>
<p>in 1991. Such interviews might have helped towards the resolution of some </p>
<p>outstanding issues, although one must be aware that the totalitarian regime in </p>
<p>Iraq continued to cast a shadow on the credibility of all interviews.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The programme to destroy the Al Samoud 2 missiles had not been completed, </p>
<p>and “there was no time to assess whether the Al Fatah missile stayed within the </p>
<p>range allowed”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The report showed that the weapons destroyed before the inspectors left in 1998 </p>
<p>“were, in almost all cases declared by Iraq, and that the destruction occurred </p>
<p>before 1993 in the case of missiles, and before 1994 in the case of chemical </p>
<p>weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The existence and scope of the biological weapons programme was uncovered </p>
<p>by UNSCOM in 1995, “despite Iraq’s denials and concealment efforts”; “only a </p>
<p>few remnants” of the programme were subsequently found. “A great deal – Iraq </p>
<p>asserts all – was unilaterally destroyed in 1991.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The lack of significant finds over many years “could be because the items </p>
<p>were unilaterally destroyed by the Iraqi authorities or else they were effectively </p>
<p>concealed by them”. In the “new environment in which there is full access </p>
<p>and co-operation, and in which knowledgeable witnesses should no longer be </p>
<p>inhibited from revealing what they know, it should be possible to establish the </p>
<p>truth”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors had looked for sites where mobile facilities could be operated </p>
<p>and Iraq had presented some information about the mobile systems they </p>
<p>possessed which did not match “the description which has recently been made </p>
<p>available to us, as well as the media, by the United States”. UNMOVIC could not </p>
<p>“make a proper evaluation of the depicted vehicles on the basis of the published </p>
<p>material alone”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC remained “ready to resume work in Iraq as an independent verifier or </p>
<p>to conduct long-term monitoring, should the Council so decide”.</p>

<p> Mr Blair said there was “an urgent problem” over WMD. The scientists and </p>
<p>technicians who would tell the truth about the WMD programme needed to be found. </p>
<p>That meant being ready to promise immunity, otherwise they would be too frightened to </p>

<p>Baghdad Airport. The draft of “a preliminary inter-agency report” suggested that “one of </p>
<p>the trailers was not capable of producing BW agent”. That was, however, “likely to be </p>

<p>and UK public positions.</p>
<p><b>326. </b> The “public position could be reinforced” if it were possible in due course to </p>
<p>“involve the UN [in] the verification process”. The ISG would host at least one embedded </p>
<p>journalist. Mr Hoon had offered a UK communications adviser in response to a US </p>
<p>request for assistance with ISG communications.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that a “more radical approach … could be to play down WMD … </p>
<p>and focus on other areas”; but Mr Hoon doubted that would work. In his view, “the </p>
<p>WMD issue would not go away, particular[ly] in the UK. Any attempt to brush it aside or </p>

<p>incentives for Iraqi WMD personnel for Mr Blair to send to President Bush.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The paper stated that UNSCOM had produced a list of “around 6,500 Iraqis who </p>
<p>had been involved in … prohibited weapons programmes”, but “the true figure could be </p>
<p>considerably higher”. Coalition Forces had captured a few high-ranking individuals, but </p>
<p>there had been “no contact with the great mass of personnel”, which “should be a high </p>
<p>priority” for the ISG.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>488</p>
<p><b>331. </b> The paper recommended a combination of carrots and sticks. Proposed incentives </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>immunity from prosecution;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>personal security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>financial security; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>job security.</p>
<p><b>332. </b> The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) de-Ba’athification programme </p>
<p>(see Section 11) and the dissolution of Saddam Hussein’s security apparatus was </p>
<p>“a strong perverse incentive for anyone affected … not to co-operate with the Coalition”.</p>
<p><b>333. </b> The paper stated that the threat of prosecution in the Iraqi courts for concealing </p>
<p>evidence might be sufficient to encourage personnel to come forward.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> The paper highlighted the need for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a public information campaign explaining how people should get in touch;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>facilities in Iraq to receive, filter and interview personnel; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an ISG ability to respond quickly to credible information. Looting and arson could </p>
<p>already have destroyed valuable evidence.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> On 5 June, at Sir David Manning’s request, Sir Richard Dearlove sent No.10 an </p>
<p>outline for Mr Blair on “what SIS will do additionally over the next six to eight weeks to </p>
<p>uncover evidence of Iraqi WMD”.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p><b>336. </b> Sir Richard hoped that, by the end of July, the ISG would be fully functional and  </p>
<p>able to take activity forward with intelligence support from SIS. If necessary, SIS should  </p>
<p>be able to sustain its own effort once the ISG was operational. In the meantime,  </p>
<p>Sir Richard intended:</p>
<p>“… to put more SIS staff (or staff borrowed from other Agencies) on the ground and </p>
<p>to boost the WMD-related effort in concert with the MOD. Our aim is primarily to </p>
<p>identify Iraqi scientists who will attest in public to what is in the intelligence record. </p>
<p>As regard logistics (ground penetrating radar, transport etc) I believe MOD can offer </p>
<p>us all we need.”</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Sir Richard explained that, over the next six to eight weeks, SIS aimed to pursue </p>
<p>to a conclusion all CBW and missile leads involving more junior scientists and officers. </p>
<p>In pursuing those individuals, it would be important to agree a common position on </p>
<p>adequate incentive and immunities with the US. Mr Bowen was pursuing the issue, but </p>
<p>it would probably be necessary “to cut through the US bureaucracy to achieve a rapid </p>
<p>satisfactory outcome”.</p>

<p>489</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Sir Richard added that SIS had been “closely involved in the protracted saga of </p>
<p>the [BW] trailers”. The extended debate over the trailers’ function “served to underline </p>
<p>the importance of controlling publicity and of co-ordination both with the US and within </p>
<p>the US system”. He hoped that would become easier to manage once the ISG was up </p>
<p>and running.</p>
<p><b>339. </b> In conclusion, Sir Richard said that, over the next week, SIS would be refining </p>
<p>requirements for the “surge effort” described in his letter.</p>
<p><b>340. </b> During his conversation with President Bush on 6 June, Mr Blair stressed the </p>
<p>importance of offering inducements to Iraqis involved in WMD programmes.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> He said </p>
<p>that he was relaxed about the ISG and confident it would get results.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> At its meeting on 6 June, the Evidence and Elimination Task Force was informed </p>
<p>that, in relation to the recruitment of inspectors, Dr David Kelly, MOD Special Adviser </p>
<p>Counter-proliferation and Arms Control, was conducting “a recce to theatre”, which </p>
<p>would “inform a further briefing of prospective UK ISG inspectors on 13 June”.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>342. </b> The Task Force was also informed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“All BW samples” had, “so far, been negative or inconclusive”. The official report </p>
<p>on samples from the bio-trailer was “inconclusive”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Vice Chief of the Defence Staff had “formed a ‘Tiger Team’ to look into WMD </p>
<p>lessons learned”.</p>
<p><b>343. </b> Reporting the main points to have emerged from the meeting, Mr Dowse wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [d]espite all previous assurances, the US have done no further investigation </p>
<p>of the first two bio-lab trailers and – incredibly – have lost the third … it was left </p>
<p>unguarded and disappeared”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The DoD was suggesting “adopting as ‘hypotheses’ that Iraq either destroyed </p>
<p>all its WMD before the war, or hid it in Syria (and Sudan) – and then focusing </p>
<p>intelligence collection efforts on finding evidence to prove this. This looked </p>
<p>dangerous …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG had “no clear lines of command … or of reporting back to Washington”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “clear competition between US agencies”.</p>

<p><b>344. </b> Mr Blair discussed the ISG with Mr Straw and Mr Hoon on 9 June.</p>

<p><b>345. </b> In his conversation with Dr Rice on 9 June, Sir David Manning reported Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>view.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> He assured Dr Rice that the UK would give its best resources to the intelligence </p>
<p>component of the ISG, but the UK needed access to all the relevant information.</p>
<p><b>346. </b> Sir David reported that Dr Rice had assured him that she had been asked to </p>
<p>take action after Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush on 2 June, and that </p>
<p>responsibility for WMD had been transferred from Secretary Rumsfeld to Mr Tenet, who </p>
<p>was to ensure that the ISG concentrated on two priorities: the search for WMD and the </p>
<p>search for Saddam Hussein and his sons. Mr Tenet intended to recruit Dr David Kay, a </p>
<p>former inspector, to help shape the WMD effort.</p>
<p><b>347. </b> Sir David also reported that he had told Dr Rice that action on incentives and </p>
<p>immunities was “extremely urgent”. The absence of interviews had been a “major </p>
<p>weakness” in UNMOVIC’s approach.</p>
<p><b>348. </b> Sir David commented that Mr Blair’s concerns had clearly registered with </p>
<p>President Bush and that Sir Richard Dearlove would be in touch with Mr Tenet “shortly”.</p>
<p><b>349. </b> Mr Cannon informed Sir Richard Dearlove’s Private Office that, in response to </p>
<p>the US “shake-up” of oversight of the ISG, Sir David Manning thought that the “most </p>
<p>appropriate channel” to follow up Mr Blair’s conversation with President Bush would be </p>
<p>for Sir Richard to write to Mr Tenet setting out the UK’s views.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett agreed.</p>
<p><b>350. </b> As the basis for a letter, Mr Cannon provided a draft, which had been cleared with </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett, together with a copy of the FCO paper on incentives to encourage Iraqi </p>
<p>WMD personnel to come forward.</p>
<p><b>351. </b> The draft identified six “key priority areas” for the success of the ISG:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a clear command structure, with clear priorities and an effective flow of </p>
<p>information;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an intelligence-led campaign with resources put to best use; the UK had </p>
<p>“some skills in this area” and was “keen to contribute”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>complete sharing of intelligence generated by the ISG “without restrictions of </p>
<p>access at any level”; the UK was “keen to play its full part”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inducements and immunity; there was “some experience in this area which … </p>
<p>could be helpful”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a sense of drive and urgency”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>logistic support.</p>

<p><b>352. </b> The draft concluded:</p>
<p>“We agree that we need to take this investigation forward patiently and prudently, </p>
<p>without letting the media and the anti-intervention lobby rattle us. But we have to </p>
<p>move fast to secure the physical evidence of WMD and more importantly the people, </p>
<p>the scientists and administrators with the knowledge of the programmes, before they </p>
<p>have time to get together and work out a co-ordinated strategy for dealing with us … </p>
<p>[and] before they start taking their proliferation skills somewhere else.”</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Following a discussion with Mr Tenet on 11 June, Sir Richard Dearlove sent him </p>
<p>the two papers provided by Mr Cannon.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> Sir Richard explained that SIS had made </p>
<p>arrangements to reinforce and reorganise in Iraq to bridge the gap until the ISG was </p>
<p>fully operational. He also asked Mr Tenet for details of the new command and control </p>
<p>arrangements for the ISG so that decisions could be made on adjustments needed </p>
<p>in the UK.</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Tenet announced Dr Kay’s appointment as “Special Advisor for Strategy </p>
<p>regarding Iraqi Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs” (commonly known as the </p>
<p>Head of the ISG) on 11 June 2003.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p><b>355. </b> In his memoir, Mr Tenet wrote:</p>
<p>“Military personnel would have to do the lion’s share of the actual searching and </p>
<p>provide almost all of the physical security for those engaging in the mission. To </p>
<p>get around that hurdle, we carefully negotiated a memorandum of understanding </p>
<p>with DOD, spelling out how a senior advisor appointed by me would work with, </p>
<p>but not command, what was called the Iraq Survey Group (ISG), which would </p>
<p>stay technically under the command of a two-star general reporting to the </p>
<p>Secretary of Defense.”</p>
<p>171</p>
<p><b>356. </b> Mr Tenet also wrote:</p>
<p>“Our instructions to Kay were simple. Find the truth. We promised him the resources </p>
<p>he needed and an absence of interference from the home front. I am confident that </p>
<p>we delivered both.”</p>
<p><b>357. </b> Mr Tenet added, “We protected Kay’s independence fiercely.”</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Senior US, UK and Australian military officers and civilians involved with the ISG </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>492</p>
<p><b>359. </b> On 12 June, Mr Straw told Cabinet that the ISG was starting work. Incentives and </p>
<p>immunities to encourage Iraqi co-operation were being sorted out.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>360. </b> There is no record in the minutes that Mr Straw explained the UK’s role or </p>
<p>responsibilities to Cabinet.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p><b>361. </b> Sir Richard Dearlove sent Sir David Manning a copy of the letter to Mr Tenet </p>
<p>on 16 June.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>362. </b> In a covering letter to Sir David Manning, Sir Richard suggested:</p>
<p>“With CIA in the ISG driving seat on WMD, SIS will need to take a more prominent </p>
<p>role in the co-ordination of the UK effort, as we are best placed to liaise with CIA </p>
<p>here, in Washington and on the ground in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>363. </b> Depending on what Mr Tenet told Sir Richard about command, control and </p>
<p>communications arrangements for the ISG, it might be necessary to “re-jig” the Whitehall </p>
<p>arrangements on WMD to reflect a more prominent SIS role. Any changes would need to </p>
<p>avoid detracting from the “key contribution of DIS/MOD, who are providing the major UK </p>
<p>input of resources and expertise, here and in the field”.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> Sir Richard suggested setting “some review deadlines”, with a first review at the </p>
<p>end of July to assess the impact of the joint SIS/DIS “surge effort” and the interface </p>
<p>between that effort and the start of the ISG. He suggested a date around the end of </p>
<p>September for a first formal review of the ISG.</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Sir Richard commented:</p>
<p>“Although the UK will be the junior partner in the ISG, and we may need to manage </p>
<p>expectations on both sides of the Atlantic about what it can achieve, I hope that we </p>
<p>will be able to influence its focus and pace of activity.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Sir David Manning endorsed Sir Richard Dearlove’s proposals and asked </p>
<p>Sir Richard to discuss the streamlining of Whitehall machinery with Mr Scarlett.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir David envisaged the JIC Sub-Committee on Iraq/WMD remaining the focal point </p>
<p>for the overall Whitehall effort, “but it will clearly need to work very closely with the  </p>
<p>SIS/CIA liaison machinery”.</p>
<p><b>367. </b> SIS3 reported, after visiting Iraq in June, that logistical obstacles were likely to </p>
<p>delay ISG operation until mid-July.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> He had observed some confusion on the ground </p>
<p>as a consequence of recent leadership changes and some “institutional rivalries and </p>
<p>disconnects”, confirming SIS3 in the view that the UK should reinforce its independent </p>

<p>SIS would take stock.</p>
<p><b>368. </b> SIS3 reported that co-ordination between UK agencies and units and between </p>

<p><b>370. </b> Mr Howard sent Mr Bowen a progress report on 20 June.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> It was now clear that </p>
<p>Mr Tenet would exercise strategic oversight of the ISG’s work on WMD and would be </p>
<p>represented in Iraq by Dr Kay. Maj Gen Dayton had been tasked to support Dr Kay. </p>
<p>The ISG would continue to work within the military chain of command to ensure it </p>
<p>received the necessary security, logistics and life support. There was evidence that </p>
<p>CENTCOM was now giving the ISG the support it needed.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> Mr Howard reported that, during calls on SIS and the DIS on 19 June, Dr Kay had </p>

<p>It is part of the United States-led military forces in Iraq and is therefore accountable </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>494</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Major General Tim Tyler, British Deputy Commander of the ISG from early January </p>
<p>to late March 2004, told the Inquiry that Maj Gen Dayton explained this arrangement by </p>
<p>describing himself as the “taxi driver” for Special Advisors Dr Kay and Mr Duelfer, who </p>
<p>“paid the fare”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Maj Gen Tyler described how the separate chains of military and intelligence </p>
<p>oversight worked from a British perspective:</p>
<p>“As senior UK rep, I had two lines of reporting, formal ones … I reported directly </p>
<p>back to the ROCKINGHAM cell for the intelligence aspects … and then to PJHQ on </p>
<p>all military aspects.”</p>
<p><b>376. </b> Maj Gen Tyler added: “From my point of view it was straightforward and therefore </p>
<p>did work.”</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Howard told the Inquiry that, although he had been concerned that the ISG </p>
<p>would end up with a split command, the arrangement had worked quite well:</p>
<p>“Keith Dayton got on, ran the ISG, did the tasking, sent people out, made sure </p>
<p>they were properly protected and, as it were, managed the administration, and </p>
<p>David really concentrated on the analytical effort and targeting the analysis, saying </p>
<p>this is where we need to concentrate our efforts, and I think that actually worked </p>
<p>reasonably well.</p>
<p>“I thought that the industrial handling of documents and other sources by the ISG </p>
<p>was very good. I think there were problems, nevertheless, of record-keeping, </p>
<p>and problems of actually really bringing a vast amount of material into a single </p>
<p>cohesive report.</p>
<p>“So it was a mixed picture, but the general approach, I think, was right.”</p>

<p>There was “a great deal of interest in this paper and it would be important to get </p>

<p>situation was still developing. It was “too early to make firm judgements about </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD. Nothing had so far been found to disprove earlier JIC judgements.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The draft “should be structured to refer to previous JIC judgements and describe </p>
<p>new evidence, but it should state that it could only provide a snapshot of work in </p>
<p>progress”. The inclusion of Key Judgements was “not warranted”.</p>

<p>focused approach to conducting the search process is only now being put into place. </p>
<p>Implementation will have to allow for the difficulties of operating in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>“A number of lines of investigation … continue to be pursued. Limited new </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“In initial interviews senior detainees are maintaining that Iraq’s chemical </p>
<p>weapons programme ended in 1991 and that no weapons were retained.”</p>
<p><b>Biological weapons</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Very little new intelligence relating to biological weapons alone has been </p>
<p>received … Detainees assessed to be involved continue so far to insist that the </p>
<p>programme stopped in 1991.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Confirmation of the exact purpose” of the suspect trailers would require further </p>
<p>work. The trailers were “consistent with, although not optimally designed for, </p>
<p>hydrogen production”. Analytical results had “revealed organic chemicals … </p>
<p>inconsistent with the hydrogen process alone. Even if hydrogen production is </p>
<p>confirmed, technical analysis of the trailers has not undermined the assessment </p>
<p>that they are capable of being used, with only minor modifications, for the </p>
<p>production of micro-organisms.”</p>
<p><b>Nuclear weapons</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Since the start of the conflict limited information relating to a nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme has been uncovered in Iraq. One recent report implies that some </p>
<p>activity which could be associated with a centrifuge programme was undertaken </p>
<p>between 1999-2002 …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Mahdi al-Ubaidi, the former head of the gas centrifuge programme, had </p>
<p>“stated that documentation was concealed from the IAEA” and centrifuge </p>
<p>components had been found buried at his residence. He “claimed that the </p>
<p>nuclear weapons programme was not reconstituted after 1991” but “there was </p>
<p>an intention to do so once UN sanctions were lifted”.</p>
<p><b>Ballistic missiles</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been “no new information” about Al Hussein missiles.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr al-Huwaish, former head of the Military Industrial Commission (MIC) and </p>
<p>a senior member of the National Monitoring Directorate, had claimed the Al </p>
<p>Husseins were “unilaterally destroyed in 1992”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Post-conflict interviews and some supporting documentation confirmed previous </p>
<p>judgements that Saddam Hussein “had ordered the development of missiles with </p>
<p>ranges far in excess of the permitted 150km range”. There were “discrepancies” </p>
<p>about when the programme had started and the planned range, but all the </p>
<p>interviewees appeared “to agree that the programme was still at the design stage”.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The missile designs described were “different to some of those previously </p>
<p>highlighted in intelligence, because they are claimed to be based on Volga </p>
<p>engine technology rather than SCUD”.</p>
<p><b>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The former Director of the Centre responsible for the UAV programme had </p>
<p>confirmed that an Iraqi UAV flew 500km in June 2002. He continued to state that </p>
<p>they were not designed for the delivery of chemical or biological agent.</p>
<p><b>Proliferation</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We remain concerned about the proliferation of material, equipment and </p>
<p>technical knowledge from Iraq to third parties … We have not been able to </p>
<p>substantiate intelligence and media reporting of missiles and other related </p>
<p>material being sent to Syria or other countries.”</p>
<p><b>385. </b> Addressing why there had been no finds of chemical and biological munitions or </p>
<p>stocks of agent, or Al Hussein missiles or parts, the Assessment stated:</p>
<p>“A number of high value detainees claim that these munitions and systems do not </p>
<p>exist. However, there are serious doubts are [sic] their openness and co-operation. </p>
<p>The weight of intelligence prior to the conflict, and the fact that the investigative </p>
<p>process is at a very early stage, lead us to maintain our previous judgements.</p>
<p>“A number of other explanations have been proposed about the fate of Iraq’s WMD </p>
<p>munitions and systems, some of which are supported by intelligence:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>munitions were deployed but have not yet been found, because they were </p>
<p>either destroyed or hidden on the battlefield;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they were destroyed to ensure they were not discovered by UNMOVIC </p>
<p>inspections – […] This would be more extreme than the concealment </p>
<p>measures considered by the JIC in its paper of 11 October 2002 on </p>
<p>inspections. There has also been a suggestion that some munitions were </p>
<p>destroyed just prior to the conflict but intelligence on this has yet to be </p>
<p>verified;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s concealment operation was so comprehensive that it did not allow for </p>
<p>rapid reconstitution of an effective CBW or Al Hussein missile capability – </p>
<p>[…] The gap between UN weapons inspectors leaving and the start of the </p>
<p>conflict was only three days.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the political decision-making process in Iraq was paralysed by the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>386. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that the Assessment “sort of logged the picture </p>
<p>at that moment, which was more or less when the ISG was seriously getting going”.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He added:</p>
<p>“So in the end of June Assessment it was just stated that no munitions of stocks or </p>
<p>agent had been found for CW … That was set against the fact that even during the </p>
<p>conflict there had been continuing intelligence about tactical deployment of CW. This </p>
<p>was early on, after the end of the conflict, and it was still seen as very early days.</p>
<p>“For BW it was slightly different at that point because it’s important to say that in late </p>
<p>April, early May, trailers were found in Iraq …</p>
<p>“So in the BW context, it wasn’t a case that nothing had been found, because it was </p>
<p>thought that possibly something pretty serious had been found, and of course it played </p>
<p>into a major line of reporting which was still being taken seriously at that time …</p>
<p>“So initially … it was said in bold terms, straight away, up front to customers what </p>
<p>was not being found and what might be being found, and at that stage, emphasis </p>
<p>was placed on it was too early to review judgments or change judgments because it </p>
<p>was very early days in the search.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“It’s quite difficult to tell from the reporting notes going backwards and forwards at </p>
<p>what point, if you like, the psychological mood changed, because clearly almost from </p>
<p>the beginning when nothing was found, the possibility that nothing would be found </p>
<p>was there …”</p>

<p>• </p>

<p><b>390. </b> The FCO sent its initial response to the FAC report in November.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no doubt whatever that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction”, and that, when the UN inspectors “finally had to leave” in </p>
<p>December 1998, “they made it quite clear that in their view ‘unaccounted for’ </p>
<p>meant that he had not revealed them”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “no doubt at all” that the ISG would find “evidence of weapons of mass </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The policy of containment “was not working”. Saddam Hussein’s strategy “was </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The September dossier had stated that Saddam Hussein would engage in a </p>
<p>programme of concealment and he (Mr Blair) believed, from the information now </p>
<p>available, that was “precisely what he did”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He reiterated the validity of the intelligence in relation to the statement that Iraq </p>
<p>had chemical and biological weapons that could be activated within 45 minutes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He suggested that the alternative hypothesis to the one he had set out was that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein had decided to get rid of the weapons but had not told anyone; </p>
<p>he did not think that was “a very serious hypothesis”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He regretted that the dossier that had been produced in February had not </p>
<p>correctly attributed the information which had been drawn from published </p>
<p>sources; but that information was correct. The first and third parts of the dossier </p>
<p>were based on intelligence information.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The information in the September dossier on Iraqi attempts to procure uranium </p>
<p>from Niger was not based on the “so-called ‘forged’ documents” seen by the </p>
<p>IAEA, but on separate intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG should be allowed time to do its work. It would be addressing the issues </p>
<p>“in a systematic way”, which Dr Blix “was unable to do”. “[C]hasing round trying </p>
<p>to find the stuff” was “always going to be incredibly difficult”. The only way to “get </p>
<p>to the truth” was “by interviewing the people involved”.</p>

<p>“The Prime Minister and the Government have an overriding duty to be scrupulous </p>
<p>and consistent in the way that they provide intelligence material to Parliament. Over </p>
<p>these last months that has clearly not been the case. Two key areas exist … the </p>
<p>status of the evidence on weapons of mass destruction, and … the way in which the </p>
<p>Government have handled and made public the material.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“For example, there was a claim about uranium from Niger going to Iraq. The claim </p>
<p>was stated as a fact in the September dossier but was subsequently shown to have </p>
<p>been partially based on forged documents. There was no explanation of who forged </p>
<p>them and why. There is no mention of CIA concerns in the Government’s response. </p>
<p>We now have a belated explanation that there were other sources of intelligence </p>
<p>that apparently cannot be disclosed. Even more unusually we are told such sources </p>
<p>cannot be shared with the United States.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Some will ask whether the dodgy dossier really matters. The fact that the Prime </p>
<p>Minister misrepresented its provenance goes to the heart of the trust that Parliament </p>
<p>can put in what he tells it is, or is not, intelligence …</p>
<p>“The erosion of public confidence is gathering pace and beginning to damage the </p>

<p>“I.  Information that Iraq was pursuing a number of designs for prohibited ballistic </p>
<p>missiles between 2000 and 2002 is, despite some discrepancies, credible.</p>
<p>“II.  The missiles were designed to reach ranges between 500-600km and 900-</p>
<p>1,000km. Initial examination indicates that the designs produced and the four to five </p>
<p>year timeframe envisaged to reach full production appear technically credible.</p>
<p>“III.  Senior figures in the ballistic missile programme were actively engaged in </p>
<p>concealing this design work from UNMOVIC, both physically and in interviews with </p>
<p>inspectors. The aim was to preserve the designs for future use.</p>
<p>“IV.  Some of the individuals are not being entirely forthcoming on sensitive issues, </p>
<p>such as chemical and biological warhead designs, possibl[y] out of fear of the </p>
<p>consequences for them.”</p>
<p><b>404. </b> The Assessment stated that two consistent themes had emerged from the </p>
<p>interviews that had been conducted so far:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq worked on a number of missile designs between late 2000 and early 2002 </p>
<p>… but no missile hardware was produced;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Orders were received in mid 2002 to conceal all signs of such design work from </p>
<p>UN weapons inspectors and these orders were carried out.”</p>

<p>504</p>
<p><b>405. </b> The Assessment contained statements relating to the development of missile </p>
<p>systems including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was using multiple Volga engines (the Al Samoud missile had only one </p>
<p>engine). The missile designs were judged to be “credible”; Iraq had “previous </p>
<p>experience with multiple engine systems”. The twin engine missile “would have </p>
<p>had a range approaching that of the Al Hussein (650km)”, but “a much smaller </p>
<p>payload”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work had not been undertaken after early 2002.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “currently no evidence to link the 380 illicitly procured Volga engines </p>
<p>to these designs, although the number purchased was probably in excess of that </p>
<p>required for the Al Samoud programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence pre-conflict had indicated possible work on a long-range derivative </p>
<p>of the SCUD missile, with a range of around 1,200km, but all those interviewed </p>
<p>had stated that they were unaware of any continuing work on a SCUD-based </p>
<p>system.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been design work on developing the short-range Al Fatah </p>
<p>(Ababil 100) missile.</p>
<p><b>406. </b> The Assessment concluded that it was not clear why development of the designs </p>
<p>for prohibited missile systems had been halted. There was a clear intent to preserve the </p>
<p>designs for future use and UNMOVIC inspectors had been deceived during interviews. </p>
<p>Areas for further investigation included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the issue of chemical and biological warheads”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the purpose of missile infrastructure such as the Al Rafah test stand”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the extent of foreign technical and material assistance”.</p>
<p><b>407. </b> Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry that after this Assessment:</p>
<p>“… there wasn’t a further formal JIC Assessment until the end of the following year, </p>
<p>23 December 2004, when there was a formal review of JIC judgements in 2002, </p>
<p>which took account of the ISG final report which had been issued in October 2004.</p>
<p>“But in case anybody thinks that therefore the JIC wasn’t looking at it at that time, it </p>
<p>certainly was, but it was doing it through the process of reporting from, contact with, </p>
<p>monitoring of, participation in, through British representatives, the work of the ISG </p>
<p>on the ground. There were regular reports coming in and then being disseminated to </p>
<p>No.10 and to JIC members, and that is how the work of the ISG was tracked.”</p>

<p><b>The ISG builds momentum</b></p>
<p><b>408.  On 16 July, Mr Howard reported that the ISG was now focusing its effort </b></p>
<p><b>on debriefings and document exploitation, but that it was still “very much at the </b></p>
<p><b>beginning” of its task.</b></p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Howard visited the ISG in Baghdad and Qatar in the second week of July.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported to Mr Scarlett that:</p>
<p>“A lot of emphasis is being placed on human intelligence and interviews and </p>
<p>debriefings both of high value detainees and low ranking individuals. Another main </p>
<p>area of effort, which is beginning to produce some results, is document and other </p>
<p>media exploitation. Major centres for this have been set up both in Baghdad and </p>
<p>in Qatar which bring together subject matter experts, linguists and, in the case </p>
<p>of Baghdad, some powerful IT tools to sift what is a vast quantity of material for </p>
<p>interesting information and leads.</p>
<p>“… But, it is still true to say that we are very much at the beginning of the task and </p>
<p>the ISG has only really reached its current state of effectiveness in the last fortnight.”</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Mr Howard provided a copy of the ISG’s four “Operating Hypotheses”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had an active WMD development program separate and apart from WMD </p>
<p>production</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq hid CW/BW weapons and agents, delivery systems, and WMD program </p>
<p>information within Iraq away from sites known to the Coalition, or outside Iraq</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq destroyed existing stockpiles (but likely retained a mobilization or production </p>
<p>capability that could produce CW/BW agents and delivery systems)</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Iraq destroyed its stockpile (or most of it), it would have taken place at remote </p>
<p>locations or areas with no previous link to the WMD program.”</p>
<p><b>411. </b> Mr Howard advised that, with the exception of evidence of Iraqi attempts to extend </p>
<p>the range of anti-ship cruise missiles to 180km, there needed to be “a good deal more </p>
<p>exploitation and investigation before a rounded picture in any of the key areas can be </p>
<p>pulled together”.</p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Howard reported that Dr Kay wanted to avoid “drip-feeding” material to London </p>
<p>or Washington for fear of leaks and of raising expectations unjustifiably. Dr Kay was </p>
<p>also very wary of making anything public in the near future, but was “pretty bullish” that </p>
<p>he would have “a reasonably convincing BW package for use in public by early to mid </p>
<p>September”. He would understand if the UK wanted to publicise the missile programme </p>
<p>before then, but believed it would have more impact combined with something on BW or </p>
<p>CW in September. Mr Howard agreed.</p>

<p>the security situation (addressed in more detail in the Box, ‘Deteriorating </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>an “insufficiently flexible detention policy”, which was being exploited by former </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the “lack of an immunity component to the incentives package”.</p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Scarlett reported Mr Howard’s conclusions to Sir David Manning together with </p>
<p>an outline of the draft JIC Assessment of Iraq’s prohibited missile systems.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Scarlett advised Sir David that evidence on Iraq’s missile, nuclear and BW </p>

<p>“physical and oral deception”.</p>

<p>213</p>
<p><b>417. </b> Asked how the absence of evidence of WMD in Iraq was presented to Mr Blair, </p>
<p>Sir John Scarlett told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The advice from the Cabinet Office and from the Assessments Staff and the JIC </p>
<p>was straight down the middle. He [Mr Blair] was told what was being found and what </p>
<p>was not being found, and he was given the best advice about the significance of </p>
<p>what was being found and not being found … [T]here was nothing in the advice that </p>

<p>216</p>
<p> In the face of an offensive on the issue by the </p>
<p>Democratic Party and in the media, mutual distrust between the White House and the </p>
<p>CIA was palpable. All the Democrat presidential candidates were raising questions about </p>

<p><b>The death of Dr David Kelly and the Hutton Inquiry</b></p>
<p>Following the controversy surrounding the allegations by the <i>BBC</i> journalist Mr Andrew </p>
<p>Gilligan that the September 2002 intelligence dossier had been “sexed up”, Dr David Kelly, </p>
<p>MOD Special Adviser Counter-proliferation and Arms Control, was invited to give evidence </p>
<p>to the House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee on 15 July 2003 and the Intelligence </p>
<p>and Security Committee of Parliament on 16 July.</p>
<p>On 18 July 2003, Dr Kelly’s body was found near his Oxfordshire home.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>Later on 18 July, Lord Hutton was asked by Lord Falconer, the Secretary of State for </p>
<p>Constitutional Affairs, “urgently to conduct an investigation into the circumstances </p>
<p>surrounding the death of Dr Kelly”.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>Lord Hutton concluded that his Terms of Reference should include investigation of the </p>
<p>two allegations that had drawn Dr Kelly into the controversy surrounding Mr Gilligan’s </p>
<p>broadcasts on the <i>Today</i> programme:</p>
<p>“… (1) that the Government probably knew, before it decided to put it in the dossier </p>
<p>of 24 September 2002, that the statement was wrong that the Iraqi military were </p>
<p>able to deploy weapons of mass destruction within 45 minutes of a decision to do so </p>

<p>The <i>Report of the Inquiry into the Circumstances Surrounding the Death of Dr David Kelly </i></p>

<p><b>Revised Directive on UK military co-operation with the ISG</b></p>
<p>On 30 July, General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, issued a revised </p>
<p>Directive for Op TELIC, superseding the version issued on 18 March and the </p>
<p>supplementary material on the ISG issued on 18 June.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>The revised Directive included a revised strategic military objective that, for the first time, </p>

<p>“To support the Coalition effort, within allocated resources, to stabilise Iraq, find/</p>
<p>secure WMD, alleviate humanitarian needs, and help create the conditions for the </p>
<p>achievement of the strategic end state.”</p>
<p>The Directive included instructions on co-operation with the ISG:</p>
<p>“The shift towards a pro-active WMD finding, evidence handling and elimination </p>
<p>(of soft and hard components) continues and will be led by the ISG. WMD will not </p>
<p>be located only at SSEs [locations of Sensitive Site Exploitation], we will encounter </p>
<p>it <i>ad hoc</i>, and we will have to extend search activities beyond SSEs. WMD ‘soft’ </p>
<p>components and particularly scientists and military experts are very important to the </p>
<p>evidence and elimination programme and HUMINT [human intelligence] is an area </p>
<p>where the UK contribution is highly valued … You should note that ISG incorporates </p>

<p>interest in Dr Kelly and the Hutton Inquiry, and that there was likely to remain “a deep </p>
<p>vein of scepticism” about what might be found.</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Mr Howard added:</p>
<p>“… a progress report which focuses mainly on evidence of programmes and intent </p>
<p>and is short on actual hardware is likely to provoke a mixed reaction. It certainly will </p>
<p>not persuade the sceptics. But it may be enough to persuade the mainstream that </p>

<p>that the ISG was making progress, but cautioned that Dr Kay had a “tendency to </p>
<p>overstate potential leads”. ISG efforts were focused on BW, but there was also progress </p>
<p>in other areas. Developments included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>BW: the ISG was developing a clearer picture of the role of the Iraqi Intelligence </p>
<p>Service (IIS). It had concluded that the UN would not have been able to discover </p>
<p>the full extent of Iraq’s BW programme because of “the comprehensive nature </p>
<p>of Iraq’s concealment and deception policy”. The 97 vials recovered from the </p>
<p>home of a BW scientist had tested positive for traces of live type B clostridium </p>
<p>botulinum, the cause of botulism in humans. Iraq had never declared possession </p>
<p>of the type B strain.</p>

<p>513</p>
<p>Lieutenant General Andrew Ridgway, Chief of Defence Intelligence, told the Chiefs of Staff </p>
<p>on 20 August:</p>
<p>“Further attacks were expected. The bombing would affect coalition building, NGO </p>
<p>confidence, and the reconstruction of utilities, which if not expedited could lead to a </p>
<p>significant loss of consent.”</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>On 26 August, the DIS reported the disruption of an ISG deployment following an attack </p>
<p>on a nearby US military convoy.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>As security deteriorated, the US sought to transfer some of the ISG’s analysis capabilities </p>
<p>to counter-terrorism activities.</p>
<p>The Op ROCKINGHAM weekly update for 21-28 August reported that Secretary Rumsfeld </p>
<p>and US General John Abizaid, Commander CENTCOM, had indicated that they wanted </p>
<p>some of the ISG’s HUMINT and analysis capability dedicated to counter-terrorism tasks.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>In early September, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“The security environment will remain poor, and will probably worsen over the next </p>
<p>year, unless the Coalition, in conjunction with Iraqis, can reverse current trends. </p>
<p>There are likely to be more spectacular attacks.”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>In October, the DIS reported two direct attacks on ISG convoys.</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>In his memoir, Mr George Tenet, the US Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), wrote:</p>
<p>“A senior military officer later told me he … was ‘flabbergasted’ … when [in November </p>
<p>2003] Kay refused to lend some of the ISG’s experienced intelligence analysts to help </p>
<p>him find insurgents <i>‘that are killing us’… </i>Had he been a regular CIA officer, I would </p>
<p>have relieved Kay of his command and ordered him home.”</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>Major General Tim Tyler, British Deputy Commander of the ISG from early January to late </p>
<p>March 2004, told the Inquiry “there were lots of … constraints on the operations and the </p>
<p>most predominant one was the security situation”.</p>

<p>improve the system for dealing with it; and WMD.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p><b>446. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“… this must tie in with the way we deal with Hutton. I assume that though the judge </p>
<p>may be critical of certain aspects of our handling, he will basically find for us. That </p>
<p>may be optimistic. But if right, Hutton must be the chance to get our integrity back </p>
<p>on Iraq. So whatever NS [Sir Nigel Sheinwald] does must include a timetable that </p>
<p>incorporates: Hutton, Interim Report on WMD, improvement in Iraq, and other WMD </p>
<p>issues (eg Iran, NK [North Korea] and Libya).”</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Mr Straw informed Parliament on 1 September that:</p>
<p>“Coalition forces and specialist personnel of the Iraq Survey Group are actively </p>
<p>pursuing sites, documentation and individuals connected with Iraq’s weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction programmes. We are investing significant effort in the search. </p>
<p>The process will be painstaking.</p>
<p>“There have been some successes: the discovery of mobile laboratories which bear </p>
<p>a striking resemblance to those described in US Secretary of State Colin Powell’s </p>
<p>presentation to the UN Security Council in March 2003; and the recent recovery of a </p>
<p>large quantity of documents relating to Iraq’s nuclear programme together with parts </p>
<p>of a gas centrifuge which had been hidden since 1991 by an Iraqi scientist formerly </p>
<p>engaged on Iraq’s nuclear programme. We anticipate that more scientists previously </p>
<p>employed on Iraq’s WMD programmes will start to come forward with evidence </p>
<p>and equipment.</p>
<p>“Any finds clearly must be very carefully analysed and assessed. This process is </p>
<p>continuing. When we have collated the evidence, it will be presented appropriately </p>
<p>and properly.”</p>

<p>“There have been a number of reports, of varying degrees of reliability, that WMD </p>

<p><b>455. </b> Following the discussion, a small number of amendments were made to the Note, </p>
<p>including the addition of the judgement that it was “too early to conclude that there were </p>

<p>251</p>
<p> An Annex to the paper stated:</p>
<p>“So far no chemical or biological munitions or stocks of agent have been found, nor </p>

<p>these munitions and systems do not exist. However, there are serious doubts over </p>
<p>their openness and co-operation”.</p>
<p><b>456. </b> A number of other possible explanations as to why no munitions or systems had </p>
<p>been found were identified, some supported by intelligence, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>destruction or concealment on the battlefield;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>destruction to ensure they were not discovered by UNMOVIC inspections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a concealment operation “so comprehensive that it did not allow for the rapid </p>
<p>reconstitution of an effective CBW or Al Hussein missile capability”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a political decision-making process paralysed by the Coalition attack;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>exaggeration of Iraq’s capabilities by Iraqi opposition groups, “possibly through </p>

<p><b>460. </b> After the meeting, Mr Scarlett wrote to Sir Nigel Sheinwald about the need urgently </p>
<p>to address the handling of the ISG Interim Report once it reached Washington.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>461. </b> Mr Scarlett told Sir Nigel that the ISG Interim Report was not expected to differ </p>
<p>significantly from the UK assessment, set out in a revised Discussion Note following the </p>
<p>JIC meeting on 10 September. Mr Scarlett identified the main points as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the working environment in Iraq has proved much more difficult than expected </p>
<p>(poor security situation, more denial, deception and intimidation);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the evidence so far has not shown that WMD programmes were active pre-</p>
<p>conflict. Nor has any firm evidence emerged of Iraq possessing WMD;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq maintained an intention to restart its nuclear weapons programme when UN </p>
<p>sanctions were lifted, and concealed equipment and documentation in support of </p>
<p>this (much of this is already in the public domain);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there is credible evidence confirming Iraq’s pursuit of ballistic and cruise missile </p>
<p>programmes with ranges well in excess of the UN’s permitted limit (this will </p>
<p>receive some publicity through <i>Panorama</i> in late September/early October);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it is not yet possible to establish any firm picture of Iraq’s chemical and biological </p>
<p>weapons capability. The compartmented, highly concealable, and dual-use </p>
<p>nature of such programmes means that there are fewer firm leads to follow … </p>
<p>It is too early to conclude that there were no programmes, and we expect more </p>
<p>information to become available. But this will be a long and difficult process;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there is clear evidence that Iraq was in breach of UN Security Council </p>
<p>Resolutions.”</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Scarlett advised that an ISG report along those lines, however interim, would </p>
<p>raise difficult questions. That underlined the need to ensure it was handled correctly, </p>
<p>with US and Australian agreement in advance. Mr Scarlett recommended publication </p>
<p>of a short executive summary, with the full Interim Report being treated as a “classified </p>
<p>stocktake for intelligence experts”. The summary should get across three “fundamental </p>
<p>messages”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Interim Report was “far from a considered final assessment”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ISG was operating in a difficult security environment and after years of </p>
<p>deception and denial by Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there was a good deal more work to do.</p>

<p>The JIC’s independence and impartiality had “not been compromised in any </p>
<p>way”. The dossier had not been “sexed up”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Use of the phrase “continued to produce chemical and biological weapons” in </p>
<p>the foreword could have given the impression that Saddam Hussein had been </p>
<p>actively producing chemical and biological weapons and significant amounts of </p>
<p>agents. The dossier should have highlighted uncertainty about what had been </p>
<p>produced and in what quantities to give a balanced view of Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>chemical and biological capacity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier should have highlighted that battlefield rather than strategic </p>
<p>weapons were the most likely chemical and biological munitions to be used </p>
<p>against Western forces.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The dossier had been for public consumption, not experienced readers of </p>
<p>intelligence. It should have highlighted that the 45 minutes claim referred to </p>
<p>battlefield chemical and biological munitions, not to any other form of attack. </p>
<p>That omission had allowed speculation as to the exact meaning of the claim and </p>
<p>had been unhelpful to an understanding of the issue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The initial failure by the MOD to disclose that some staff had put their concerns </p>
<p>about the dossier in writing to their line managers was “unhelpful and potentially </p>
<p>misleading”.</p>

<p>If individuals in the intelligence community wrote formally to their line managers </p>

<p><b>The ISG Interim Report, 2 October 2003</b></p>
<p><b>473. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald discussed the ISG with Dr Rice in Washington on </p>
<p>14 September.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> After the meeting, he informed Mr Blair that the timing of the ISG </p>
<p>Interim Report was unclear, but it was said to be detailed and long. There would be a </p>
<p>short pause for analysis; Dr Kay would be obliged to brief Congressional Committees </p>
<p>in private; and there would be leaks. The Report was likely to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirm Iraqi deception and Iraqi intention to restart a nuclear weapons </p>
<p>programme once sanctions were lifted;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirm Iraqi pursuit of ballistic and cruise missile programmes with ranges well </p>
<p>beyond UN limits;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide little new information on BW or CW, “though there are some leads”.</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Sir Nigel advised that there was a risk an Interim Report of that kind would be </p>
<p>used to show there had been no immediate threat from Iraqi WMD. He and Dr Rice had </p>
<p>agreed that handling should be low-key, stress the Interim Report’s preliminary nature, </p>
<p>point out the difficulty of amassing evidence, and note that the Report showed Iraq had </p>
<p>been in breach of UN resolutions.</p>
<p><b>475. </b> Sir Nigel concluded:</p>
<p>“The idea of an Interim Report was conceived when we thought there would be more </p>
<p>to say in the autumn. We are now stuck with it, and are not in control of its use. We </p>
<p>can’t suppress it – its existence is too widely known. Nor did I seek to delay Kay’s </p>
<p>Congressional meetings, or any public statement about the Report – this too would </p>
<p>be likely to leak. But it is possible that there will be a delay anyway – to the week of </p>
<p>22 September, or later. And we should avoid publication of a redacted version and </p>
<p>go, if possible, for something shorter. <b>Do you agree this approach?</b>”</p>
<p><b>476. </b> Mr Hoon discussed the ISG with Secretary Rumsfeld on 15 September.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He observed that the forthcoming Interim Report “looked as though it was not going </p>
<p>to be particularly exciting”. Mr Rumsfeld said that the process was “chugging along”, </p>
<p>but the real issue was whether the ISG had enough people. Mr Hoon offered any further </p>
<p>support that was needed.</p>

<p><b>481. </b> Initially, Mr Wood suggested that Mr Howard take the opportunity to call on  </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>522</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Access to Dr Kay’s text before its release remained a concern. The Interim Report </p>
<p>was likely to be presented to Mr Tenet that day and Mr Howard was:</p>
<p>“… expected to have access to (but not copies of) the Report on Monday </p>
<p>[22 September] in Washington, and possibly a chance on Tuesday to help draft a </p>
<p>summary to be made public …”</p>
<p><b>485. </b> In the meantime, No.10 would continue to ask the White House for a copy of the </p>
<p>Interim Report.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> The meeting concluded that the Government’s position with the media should </p>
<p>be neither to heighten expectations nor to take a negative line in advance: “<b>The key </b></p>
<p><b>question was whether the Report disclosed additional evidence that the Saddam </b></p>
<p><b>regime had breached UNSCRs.</b>” Additional material would be needed on areas </p>
<p>expected to feature in the Interim Report as breaches of UNSCRs: “ballistic missiles, </p>
<p>nuclear programme, UAVs, botulism”. That material should be presented in a “facts-</p>
<p>based, forensic manner”.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Mr Howard read the Interim Report in Washington on 22 September.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>488. </b> On 24 September, Mr Howard reported to a meeting of officials in London, chaired </p>
<p>by Mr Miller, that the aim was “to complete the drafting process by the end of the week. </p>
<p>A copy of the full Report would be sent electronically to C.” It was likely that Dr Kay </p>
<p>would brief the US oversight Committees the following week in private session, following </p>
<p>which a very short public statement would be made, probably by Dr Kay and the </p>
<p>Committee Chairs.</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Mr Howard understood that:</p>
<p>“The US were keen that the approach in the three countries [UK, US and Australia] </p>
<p>was broadly in line; there was currently no intention in the US for the Administration </p>
<p>to lead on presenting it … The UK and Australian preference was for a fuller </p>
<p>executive summary to be produced which could be put in the public domain. </p>
<p>One possibility was to make public the summary section of Kay’s Report perhaps </p>
<p>accompanied by a note of Iraqi breaches of UN resolutions (being prepared by </p>
<p>the ISG) and evidence such as photographs of targeted locations and destruction. </p>
<p>This approach would need to be agreed by Tenet and the White House.”</p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>490. </b> Mr Rycroft told Mr Blair:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The draft ISG Interim Report was “a good, thorough, professional piece of work”, </p>
<p>which, helpfully, included a table setting out all the breaches of UN resolutions.</p>

<p>CW was the “thinnest area”, with a “preliminary conclusion” that there were </p>

<p>“As expected”, the nuclear section included “evidence of plans to reconstitute </p>

<p>270</p>
<p><b>491. </b> On the process of publication, Mr Rycroft explained:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was “pushing” the US to see whether Dr Kay’s Congressional and public </p>
<p>appearances could be brought forward from 9 to 8 October, to expand Dr Kay’s </p>
<p>public remarks, and to get him to publish at least his summary.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Australia was “helpfully, pushing for a big public presentation”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Efforts to press the US on those and other points were “hampered by the arms </p>
<p>length approach the Administration are taking”.</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Mr Rycroft added that some aspects of handling the Interim Report had been </p>
<p>overtaken by the “Andrew Neil leak”, which Mr Blair had already discussed with Mr David </p>
<p>Hill, Mr Campbell’s successor as Mr Blair’s Director of Communications and Strategy. </p>
<p>The Government was saying that it was Dr Kay’s Report, the Government did not have </p>
<p>it, and any comment was speculation on “an incomplete Interim Report”.</p>

<p>272</p>
<p> Sir David had also explained that there was “an </p>

<p><b>496. </b> Mr Wood told Mr Scarlett on 25 September that President Bush’s critics were:</p>
<p>“… primed to portray the Kay Report as more bad news from Iraq for the </p>
<p>Administration. Leaks will get worse next week when the Report is circulated … </p>
<p>The media focus will inevitably be on the failure to find weapons. The more of </p>
<p>Kay’s Report is in the public domain, the less freedom critics will have to engage in </p>
<p>inaccurate speculation.</p>
<p>“There may be more bad news round the corner in Congress, where … the Senate </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee may be coming to the conclusion that the judgements on Iraq </p>
<p>WMD in the US National Intelligence Estimate of October 2002 were not justified by </p>
<p>the raw intelligence.”</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>497. </b> SIS3 responded to No.10’s request [for additional material needed before the </p>
<p>publication of the ISG Interim Report] on 26 September. SIS recognised:</p>
<p>“… the need to bolster Kay’s Interim Report on publication but … the release of any </p>
<p>of our material on the Iraqi ballistic missile programme into the public domain would </p>
<p>give us severe difficulty. This is a matter not just of source protection in relation to </p>
<p>individual items, but of SIS being perceived by Iraqis and others to have received </p>
<p>material in confidence and then been involved in releasing it in raw form to the </p>
<p>press. This could damage SIS’s reputation and make it even harder, in already </p>
<p>adverse circumstances, to induce Iraqis to reveal the hard core secrets of the former </p>
<p>regime’s WMD programmes.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p><b>498. </b> On 29 September, Mr Wood reported that:</p>
<p>“… despite pressing hard … we have not been able to get any further clarity from </p>
<p>the NSC or CIA on what the Administration plan to make publicly available of </p>
<p>David Kay’s Report or of his testimony to Congress”.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Mr Wood explained that the Iraq WMD story was “now running full-bore in the US </p>
<p>media”. Democratic sources in Congress had leaked a letter from the House Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee to Mr Tenet arguing that the judgements on Iraqi WMD in the US National </p>
<p>Intelligence Estimate (NIE) of October 2002 were based on outdated, fragmentary and </p>

<p>30 September.</p>
<p><b>502. </b> Before Dr Kay delivered his unclassified testimony to Congress on 2 October, </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft sent an advance copy of the text to Mr Blair at the Labour Party Conference </p>
<p>in Bournemouth. Mr Rycroft commented:</p>
<p>“There is better than expected detail in this, particularly on missiles, nuclear + BW. </p>
<p>Even the CW section is not bad. And the Report makes clear the interim nature, + </p>
<p>the difficulties of the WMD search”.</p>

<p>Office on a draft core script for use by the Government in response to Dr Kay’s </p>
<p>testimony.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> The draft stated:</p>
<p>“The ISG have discovered dozens of WMD-related programme activities in breach of </p>
<p>UNSCRs and significant amounts of equipment in Iraq concealed from the UN.</p>
<p>“Six things in the ISG Report:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a clandestine network of laboratories and safe houses within the </p>
<p>Iraqi Intelligence Service that contained equipment subject to UN monitoring </p>
<p>and suitable for continuing CBW research. None of these were declared.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>They have found a prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human </p>
<p>testing of BW agents, which Iraqi officials were explicitly told not to declare </p>
<p>to UN inspectors.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A vial of a strain from which botulinum can be produced was hidden in the </p>
<p>home of an Iraqi scientist, along with … other vials. The same scientist </p>
<p>says he was asked to hide a further large cache of agents and refused. </p>
<p>That cache is still missing. NB it takes just 1-10 nanograms of botulinum to </p>
<p>kill an adult.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… [T]here was R and D work that paired overt work with surrogates for </p>
<p>prohibited agents, such as anthrax and ricin. NB it takes just 1-7 micrograms </p>
<p>of ricin to kill an adult. These are consistent with a BW programme ready for </p>
<p>surge production.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi scientists and senior government officials have told the ISG that </p>
<p>Saddam remained firmly committed to acquiring nuclear weapons, and that </p>
<p>he would have resumed nuclear weapons development as soon as the West </p>
<p>relaxed … Nuclear work had restarted under Dr Said.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is clear that Saddam ordered the development of ballistic missiles with a </p>
<p>range up to 1,000km … SCUD fuel production continued until at least 2001. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>526</p>
<p>Iraq tried to procure missiles from North Korea with a range of 1,300km. </p>
<p>And Iraq was continuing to develop Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with ranges </p>
<p>over 500km.</p>
<p>“Even in the area of CW, where the ISG have not yet found the unaccounted </p>
<p>for … and other material, there is emerging evidence of Iraqi attempts to restart </p>
<p>production, and many leads for the ISG to follow up.</p>
<p>“All of these are breaches of UNSCRs. Any one of them, had it been known at the </p>
<p>time, would surely have triggered a report back to the UN Security Council and an </p>
<p>explicit authorisation from the UNSC for the use of military force following UNSCR </p>
<p>1441.</p>
<p>“Yet this is just the tip of the iceberg:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>This is just an interim report …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG’s working environment has been very difficult … Some WMD </p>
<p>personnel left Iraq during the conflict.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Above all, there is now clear evidence of a pattern of deliberate deception </p>
<p>and concealment, probably centrally organised … Scientists were </p>
<p>threatened with death to stop them talking to UN inspectors. Some are still </p>
<p>under threat now.</p>
<p>“So the Kay Report is not a final reckoning of Iraq’s WMD. He concludes that we </p>
<p>cannot say definitively either that weapon stocks do not exist or that they did exist </p>
<p>before the war. We are not at the point where we can close the file on any of these </p>
<p>programmes, he says. But what is clear already, after only three months, is that </p>
<p>– at the very least – Saddam kept in place the programmes and the deception/</p>
<p>concealment techniques so that he could revive his chemical, biological and nuclear </p>
<p>weapons capability when the coast was clear. The ISG’s work must go on before we </p>

<p>exist or that they existed before the war”. Search efforts were being hindered by six main </p>
<p>factors:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deception and denial were built into each Iraqi WMD programme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there had been deliberate dispersal and destruction of material and </p>
<p>documentation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>looting, some of it systematic and deliberate;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>some WMD personnel had left Iraq immediately before and during the conflict;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>any weapons or material were likely to be small and difficult to find; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the environment in Iraq was “far from permissive”.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Dr Kay stated that the ISG had discovered “dozens of WMD-related program </p>
<p>activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United </p>
<p>Nations during the inspection that began in late 2002”, and listed examples.</p>
<p><b>511. </b> Dr Kay explained that, although he had resisted drawing conclusions in the Interim </p>
<p>Report, a number of things had become clearer as a result of the ISG’s work:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein “had not given up his aspirations and intentions to continue to </p>
<p>acquire weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “well advanced, but undeclared, ongoing activities” in the area of </p>
<p>delivery systems that “would have resulted in the production of missiles with </p>
<p>ranges up to 1,000km” if Operation Iraqi Freedom had not intervened.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG was confident that there had been ongoing clandestine CBW research </p>
<p>and development activities embedded in the Iraqi Intelligence Service.</p>
<p><b>512. </b> Discussion of the Interim Report at the JIC Sub-Committee on Iraq/WMD </p>
<p>on 3 October focused on media coverage.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> The response from UK defence </p>
<p>correspondents had been encouraging and there were no plans for Mr Blair to comment </p>
<p>publicly. The meeting judged that press interest in the UK was likely to die down.</p>
<p><b>513. </b> The meeting concluded that there was “no benefit in producing a JIC Assessment” </p>
<p>of the Interim Report, but a “community wide analysis” should be made through a </p>
<p>CIG meeting.</p>

<p><b>514. </b> Mr Scarlett discussed handling of the ISG Interim Report with Mr Tenet, </p>
<p>Mr Stephen Hadley (Deputy National Security Advisor) and others in Washington  </p>
<p>on 2 and 3 October.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>515. </b> Mr Scarlett reiterated to all those he met:</p>
<p>“… the extreme political sensitivity of the issues in London and the need to bear </p>
<p>UK political interests in mind, even when partisan and interagency tensions in </p>
<p>Washington were high.”</p>
<p><b>516. </b> Mr Wood reported that Dr Kay had stated publicly that he would need six to nine </p>
<p>months’ work before he could begin to draw firm conclusions.</p>
<p><b>517. </b> Mr Wood also commented on the tensions between senior members of the </p>
<p>US Administration about the responsibility for inserting a reference to yellowcake into </p>
<p>President Bush’s 2003 State of the Union speech, which provoked “public warfare” and:</p>
<p>“… looming over the horizon, the potentially much more serious matter of the </p>
<p>Congressional Oversight Committees concluding after detailed review that the </p>
<p>entire October 2002 NIE was flawed. The potential for renewed, and more serious, </p>
<p>internecine warfare is very clear.”</p>
<p><b>518. </b> In his memoir, Mr Tenet wrote:</p>
<p>“Collectively, Kay’s interim testimony was a damning portrait of deception and </p>
<p>dissembling … Yet in the resulting headlines, the press stressed only what Kay </p>
<p>had <i>not</i> found. None of it, however was the ‘smoking gun’ that would justify our NIE </p>
<p>estimates …”</p>
<p>283</p>
<p><b>519. </b> On 5 October, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note written by Mr Blair for </p>
<p>President Bush about their common political interest in addressing the problems related </p>
<p>to Iraq.</p>

<p> The Note and the wider background of the deteriorating position in Iraq are </p>
<p>addressed in Section 9.2.</p>
<p><b>520. </b> In relation to WMD, Mr Blair wrote that the failure to find “enough on WMD” and the </p>
<p>losses to terrorist attacks meant the public was led to doubt whether the invasion had </p>
<p>been:</p>
<p>“… worth it, or even worse is persuaded we misled them. And in the international </p>
<p>community there is a sense of Schadenfreude …</p>
<p>“We need a coherent strategy to get us back on the high ground and get the public, </p>
<p>at home and abroad, to focus on the big picture.”</p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>529</p>
<p><b>521. </b> Mr Blair characterised the position as “a battle for legitimacy” which had to be won. </p>
<p>The issue of WMD was about more than Iraq, it was a global threat. Iraq had been the </p>
<p>“starting place”:</p>
<p>“… because of the history. But the reason for action was never Iraq in isolation. It </p>
<p>was Iraq as a test case of how determined we were to confront the threat.</p>
<p>“My worry now is that the world thinks: well, Iraq was a tough deal, so they won’t try </p>
<p>that again.</p>
<p>“I think we must be absolutely unapologetic. This is the security threat. We must deal </p>
<p>with it. This means:</p>
<p>(a) </p>
<p> The Libya deal is really important …</p>
<p>(b) </p>
<p> Iran and North Korea should not be put on the back burner … We need to </p>
<p>be, if anything, stronger on this. Not that we’re about to go to war. But that </p>
<p>it’s only as a result of Iraq that these nations know we’re serious and we </p>
<p>can resolve it peacefully.</p>
<p>(c) </p>
<p> A public disruption of the trade in WMD …”</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Mr Blair suggested that the UK and US needed a “strategic plan to re-highlight the </p>
<p>terrorism/WMD issue”, and to:</p>
<p>“Get our confidence in our story back. Iraq is better without Saddam. WMD/terror </p>
<p>remains the 21st century threat. Our global agenda is the only way to a better future </p>
<p>not just for us but for the world. We’re not going soft on it. We’re going to be utterly </p>
<p>determined on it, because it’s right.</p>
<p>“… [M]y political position is very clear. I won’t win re-election on Iraq alone. But if </p>
<p>Iraq is wrong or people don’t get the security threat, it will be a major problem. On </p>
<p>the other hand, if Iraq comes right and people do get the threat, my opponents will </p>
<p>have a lot of explaining to do.”</p>
<p><b>523. </b> In a letter on 6 October, Mr Blair wrote that he was:</p>
<p>“… very grateful for SIS’s remarkable contribution both to the Iraq campaign and on </p>
<p>the complex political and diplomatic manoeuvrings which preceded it”.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>524. </b> In his video conference with President Bush on 7 October, Mr Blair commented </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>530</p>
<p><b>Follow-up to the ISG Interim Report</b></p>
<p><b>525.  In October, UK officials identified Iraq’s CW and BW programmes as the </b></p>
<p><b>issues needing most work. The ISG had opened up several lines of investigation </b></p>
<p><b>on BW. There had been little progress on CW.</b></p>
<p><b>526. </b> On 9 October, Mr Howard sent Mr Scarlett a paper on the future direction of the </p>
<p>ISG, agreed with members of his WMD Task Force, suggesting that the ISG focus its </p>
<p>effort on areas where knowledge was “most incomplete”.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>527. </b> Although work remained to be done on every subject, BW and CW were the most </p>
<p>challenging. The most comprehensive areas of the Interim Report were: nuclear and </p>
<p>long-range missile programmes; denial, deception and destruction; and procurement </p>
<p>networks.</p>
<p><b>528. </b> The ISG’s findings on BW had opened up several lines of investigation which </p>
<p>“should continue to be pursued with vigour”. Efforts to find evidence of CW research </p>
<p>and production had yielded little. Mr Howard suggested that it might be better “to focus </p>
<p>on the other end of the food chain and concentrate on amassing evidence of possible </p>
<p>deployment, or plans for deployment of CW”.</p>
<p><b>529. </b> Further work would be needed in two important supporting areas:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging sources to come forward; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring that relevant information on Iraqi WMD generated outside Iraq was fed </p>
<p>into the ISG.</p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Howard reported that Dr Kay was hinting that “the final reckoning may not </p>
<p>happen for another six to nine months”, which was “probably realistic”. He recommended </p>
<p>striking a balance between producing further interim reports with something substantive </p>
<p>to say and allowing the ISG to continue its work out of the public gaze. A number of </p>
<p>“external drivers”, including the <i>Panorama</i> programme on WMD, the outcome of the </p>
<p>Hutton Inquiry and the need to make the case to Congress for additional funding for the </p>
<p>ISG could have an impact.</p>
<p><b>531. </b> Mr Howard also wrote that the probability that force protection and counter-</p>
<p>terrorism would soon be given equal status with the search for WMD in the ISG’s work </p>
<p>was a “potential complicating factor”. His major concern was that the ISG should be </p>
<p>given sufficient security and logistical support to carry out the investigative work needed.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> The JIC Sub-Committee on Iraq/WMD discussed Mr Howard’s paper on </p>
<p>10 October.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> It was agreed that he should produce a version for the US and that the </p>
<p>importance of offering immunity or amnesty to witnesses should be emphasised at the </p>

<p><b>House of Commons debate on Iraq, 22 October 2003</b></p>
<p><b>533.  On 22 October, the House of Commons rejected a third Opposition motion </b></p>
<p><b>calling for an independent judge-led inquiry into pre-conflict intelligence.</b></p>
<p><b>534. </b> On 22 October, the House of Commons debated an Opposition motion to set up </p>
<p>“a comprehensive independent judicial inquiry into the Government’s handling of the </p>
<p>run-up to the war, of the war itself, and of its aftermath, and into the legal advice which </p>
<p>it received”.</p>
<p>289</p>
<p><b>535. </b> The Opposition motion was defeated by 303 votes to 190.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> The Government </p>
<p>amendment, adopted by 293 votes to 141, stated:</p>
<p>“That this house notes that the Intelligence and Security Committee … the </p>
<p>appropriate body to consider the intelligence relating to Iraq, and the Foreign Affairs </p>
<p>Committee have both carried out inquiries into matters relating to the decision to </p>
<p>go to war in Iraq; further notes that substantial oral and written evidence, by and on </p>
<p>behalf of the Government, was provided to both inquiries; believes that there is no </p>
<p>case for a further inquiry, including a judicial inquiry …”</p>
<p>291</p>
<p><b>536. </b> During the debate Mr Straw was asked by Mr Tony Wright (Labour) whether he still </p>
<p>believed that the Iraqi regime had represented “a clear and present danger” to the UK. </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, I do … It [the ISG] has done a great deal of work and found a good deal of </p>
<p>evidence. I regret that, because of the environment in which it has been working, it </p>
<p>has not so far been able to find more. However, nothing that it has found so far has </p>
<p>diminished my view of the threat.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>532</p>
<p><b>538. </b> Maj Gen Dayton announced during an ISG video conference on 21 October that </p>
<p>counter-terrorism had been given equal status with WMD in the ISG’s work, but that no </p>
<p>extra US resources were being made available.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p><b>539. </b> On 22 October, Mr Howard informed the Chiefs of Staff of the ISG’s decision.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>540. </b> Mr Oakden reported that the UK contribution to the ISG would gradually change to </p>
<p>include a counter-terrorism element.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>541. </b> On 30 October, Op ROCKINGHAM reported another IED attack on an ISG convoy:</p>
<p>“Although the number of ISG missions attacked is still small, and no serious injuries </p>
<p>have yet been sustained, the incidents do appear to be occurring more frequently.”</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>542. </b> Mr Howard told the JIC Sub-Committee on Iraq/WMD on 4 November that a </p>
<p>number of US document exploitation experts, case officers and analysts were being </p>
<p>diverted to counter-terrorism work.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> Maj Gen Dayton was reported to be satisfied that </p>
<p>this could happen without damaging the WMD effort; Dr Kay was less sure. DIS would </p>
<p>be deploying some analysts shortly “who could be applied to either target”.</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Mr Scarlett and Mr Dowse expressed concern about an apparent loss of ISG </p>
<p>momentum since the Interim Report. Op ROCKINGHAM reports were “very thin these </p>
<p>days”.</p>
<p><b>544. </b> Members of the Sub-Committee agreed that media interest had moved on from </p>
<p>WMD, pending publication of the Hutton Report. The <i>BBC Panorama</i> report on the ISG </p>
<p>would air on 29 November. SIS reported that the programme would focus heavily on </p>
<p>missiles, but also show the difficult conditions under which the ISG was working.</p>
<p><b>545. </b> On 11 November, Mr Howard reported to Mr Scarlett that the ISG’s “operational </p>
<p>tempo remains at a very high level, though some site missions have been postponed </p>
<p>due to the increased security threat. The ISG functional teams are all continuing </p>
<p>to conduct debriefing and site exploitation operation.”</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> There had also been a </p>
<p>considerable increase in the ability to exploit documents and different media formats.</p>
<p><b>546. </b> Mr Howard added that the apparent reduction in reporting was the result of the </p>
<p>move away from large-scale acquisition of data characteristic of the initial months of </p>
<p>operation. Staff turnover and fatigue had also contributed. Measures were in hand to </p>
<p>address that. The DIS had now “lowered reporting thresholds” for Op ROCKINGHAM </p>
<p>daily and weekly reports so that they reflected better the tempo of activity.</p>

<p><b>547.  On 10 November, Sir Nigel Sheinwald informed Mr Blair that Dr Kay </b></p>
<p><b>expected to report to Congress again in February or March 2004. Dr Kay hoped </b></p>
<p><b>to have more evidence of WMD programmes, but expected the basic story to be </b></p>
<p><b>unchanged.</b></p>
<p><b>548. </b> During a meeting with Sir Nigel Sheinwald in Baghdad on 8 November, Dr Kay said </p>
<p>that the ISG had uncovered more material since the Interim Report:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>evidence of development of a ceramic warhead for CW use in 2001:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>details of the movement of suspect items to Syria immediately before the war;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work on the stability of CW precursor agents between July 2002 and January </p>
<p>2003;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>laboratory testing of advanced chemical agents; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an anthrax stimulant production line “up to the outbreak of war”.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>549. </b> Dr Kay was reported to have criticised Coalition handling of detainees. Many had </p>
<p>been debriefed for tactical information only and there was a severe shortage of trained </p>
<p>interrogators.</p>
<p><b>550. </b> Dr Kay envisaged that, by June 2004, the ISG would have about 80 percent of </p>
<p>the picture on Iraqi WMD. At that point, it might be appropriate to reconsider its role. He </p>
<p>did not want it to have an open-ended, diminishing role, or to see it refocused on other </p>
<p>tasks. By June 2004, he would also expect Iraq to perceive the ISG as very intrusive.</p>
<p><b>551. </b> As part of his wider report on his visit to Iraq (see Section 9.2), Sir Nigel Sheinwald </p>
<p>told Mr Blair that Dr Kay expected to report to Congress again in February or March </p>
<p>2004.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> Dr Kay hoped to have further specific evidence of WMD programmes, but the </p>
<p>basic story would be unchanged. Sir Nigel had told Dr Kay that, if there was a further </p>
<p>interim report, better handling would be needed: “a proper strategy with the key points </p>
<p>identified in advance so that we were not put on the back foot by leaks”.</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Sir Nigel asked Mr Blair whether there was anything else he wanted said to Dr Kay </p>
<p>or the CIA. Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“Just keep me informed as to what he’s finding; &amp; surely we must now know what </p>
<p>happened to WMD. What do our pre-war contacts say?”</p>

<p><b>554. </b> At its meeting on 28 November, the JIC Sub-Committee on Iraq/WMD concluded </p>
<p>that the <i>BBC Panorama</i> programme, broadcast on 23 November, “had presented a </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s programme to extend the range of the Al Samoud missile;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s programme to produce even longer-range missiles;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>558. </b> On 19 November, Mr Donald Anderson, Chairman of the FAC, asked Mr Straw </p>
<p>for answers to a number of questions arising from the Government’s response to the </p>
<p>15 July report, including on lessons learned from the ISG.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>559. </b> On WMD, Mr Anderson wrote:</p>
<p>“… the Committee asked that the Government set out in detail the lessons that </p>
<p>can be learnt from the experience of UN weapons inspections in Iraq for the future </p>
<p>monitoring of BW programmes. The Committee now requests a memorandum </p>
<p>setting out the lessons learnt from the Iraq Survey Group. It also wishes to learn </p>
<p>how the past year’s weapons inspections process will contribute to developing policy </p>
<p>towards monitoring and addressing the threat of WMD from Iran, Syria and other </p>
<p>states of concern.”</p>
<p><b>560. </b> FCO officials recommended that Mr Straw inform Mr Anderson that, in relation to </p>
<p>the ISG, it would not be appropriate to divert resources from an ongoing operation or to </p>
<p>try to present lessons learned from an incomplete process.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p><b>561. </b> In his response to Mr Anderson on 2 December, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“The Iraq Survey Group is part of an ongoing operation. I do not believe it would be </p>
<p>appropriate at this stage to divert resources away from the ISG’s operational role or </p>
<p>to attempt to present lessons learned from an incomplete process.</p>
<p>“Her Majesty’s Government … has not been given access to UNMOVIC’s records … </p>
<p>It is not, therefore, possible to carry out any full analysis of what lessons have been </p>
<p>learned. The UK has … encouraged UNMOVIC to carry out such an exercise.  </p>
<p>If UNMOVIC does conduct an analysis, it is by no means certain that we would have </p>
<p>access to the results.</p>
<p>“What has become clear from the experience of weapons inspections in Iraq since </p>
<p>1991 is the need for intrusive inspection regimes to generate confidence that no </p>
<p>illegal activities are taking place.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>536</p>
<p><b>563. </b> At the beginning of December, UK officials learned from their US counterparts that </p>
<p>Dr Kay was considering not returning to Iraq after his visit to the US in the second week </p>
<p>of December.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p><b>564. </b> Mr Scarlett told Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the reasons were not clear, but Dr Kay </p>
<p>was reported to have objected strongly to the transfer of some of the ISG’s resources </p>
<p>from WMD to work on the security situation and to be concerned about the difficulty and </p>
<p>danger of ISG activity in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>565. </b> On 5 December, Mr Scarlett reported that Sir Richard Dearlove had been told that </p>
<p>Dr Kay’s departure was not certain and that, if he did go, there would be “a heavyweight </p>
<p>replacement”.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> Sir Richard had also received confirmation that there would be no </p>
<p>reduction in resources devoted to the ISG’s WMD work and the job would be done </p>
<p>thoroughly.</p>
<p><b>566. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald commented to Mr Blair on 8 December:</p>
<p>“… it now seems that Kay has to be persuaded to stay on. It seems unlikely that he’ll </p>
<p>stay, as planned, until next summer.”</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>567. </b> Mr Howard discussed the ISG with Mr John McLaughlin, Deputy Director for </p>
<p>Central Intelligence, in Washington on 11 December.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> Mr Howard said that he was </p>
<p>“scouring the barrel” to meet a request from Mr McLaughlin to find more people for </p>
<p>the ISG. The UK would be able to supply an additional four former UN inspectors </p>
<p>with BW expertise and was looking to see if it could provide more good analysts. The </p>
<p>principal UK BW experts could not be spared full-time, but could continue to deploy to </p>
<p>the ISG in short bursts. Mr Howard suggested that better use could be made of the UK </p>
<p>mobile laboratory.</p>
<p><b>568. </b> Mr Howard also reiterated that the UK would need “full consultation on timing, </p>
<p>content and presentation of any interim report”.</p>
<p><b>569. </b> On 15 December, Mr Cannon sent Mr Blair a list of “key points” from the ISG </p>
<p>Interim Report for use at PMQs.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> It largely repeated the draft core script sent out by </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft on 2 October. The key additions, taken from the Interim Report, were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“<i>Two key former BW scientists confirmed that Iraq under the guise of legitimate </i></p>
<p><i>activity developed refinements of processes and products relevant to BW </i></p>
<p><i>agents. The scientists discussed the development of improved, simplified </i></p>

<p><b>571. </b> In an interview with the <i>British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), </i>reported in </p>

<p>“… the Iraq Survey Group has already found massive evidence of a huge system of </p>

<p>missiles. Now frankly, these things weren’t being developed unless they were </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>538</p>
<p><b>573. </b> Brigadier Garry Robison, Brig Deverell’s successor as ISG Deputy Commander, </p>
<p>reported on 7 January 2004 that the preparation of cases against High Value Detainees </p>
<p>(HVDs) for the forthcoming human rights tribunal had not yet had a direct impact on </p>
<p>the ISG, but had the potential to do so.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> Rules preventing UK ISG personnel from </p>
<p>direct involvement in the preparation of evidence and testimony for the tribunal were </p>
<p>well understood.</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Mr Scarlett informed No.10 on 7 January that the US had confirmed that Dr Kay </p>
<p>would be leaving the ISG “probably by the end of next week”.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>575.  In January 2004, in the absence of compelling finds in Iraq, the Government </b></p>
<p><b>sought to emphasise the impact of military action in Iraq on wider counter-</b></p>
<p><b>proliferation efforts.</b></p>
<p><b>576. </b> On 11 January, Mr Blair was asked by Sir David Frost on <i>BBC Television</i>’s </p>
<p><i>Breakfast with Frost</i> whether he should apologise for apparently being wrong about </p>
<p>WMD in Iraq. Mr Blair replied: “What they’ve [the ISG] found already is a whole raft </p>
<p>of evidence about clandestine operations that should have been disclosed to the </p>
<p>United Nations.”</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>577. </b> Pressed by Sir David Frost on the absence of weapons, Mr Blair said: “there is … </p>
<p>something bizarre about the idea that Saddam had these weapons, got rid of them and </p>
<p>then never disclosed the fact that he got rid of them.”</p>
<p><b>578. </b> Asked if he thought there was still a chance that WMD would be found, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“I believe that we will but I agree … there were many people who thought we were </p>
<p>going to find this during the course of the actual operation … In a land mass twice </p>
<p>the size of the UK it may well not be surprising that you don’t find where this stuff is </p>
<p>hidden because part of the intelligence was that it was hidden and concealed. But </p>
<p>you know we just have to wait and see.”</p>
<p><b>579. </b> On 13 January, Mr Scarlett told No.10 that Dr Kay’s departure had been delayed </p>
<p>“to distance it from a spate of critical WMD articles in last week’s US media”.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett reported that draft US press lines focused on three points:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The departure does not mean Kay has concluded that no weapons will be found.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG has more work to do on WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ideally, Kay would have preferred ISG resources not to be diverted (as to some </p>
<p>extent they have been) to counter terrorism …”</p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>539</p>
<p><b>580. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed Dr Kay’s departure in their video </p>
<p>conference on 14 January.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that Dr Kay’s departure would have an impact </p>
<p>in the UK media. He hoped the CIA would work with the UK on handling.</p>
<p><b>581. </b> In a Cabinet discussion of the situation in Iraq on 15 January, a number of points </p>
<p>were made on WMD, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Public opinion continued to focus on the absence of WMD discovered in Iraq, </p>
<p>while the broader counter-proliferation story was inadequately covered.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The report by Dr Blix in early 2003 (the “clusters” document of 6 March, see </p>
<p>Section 3.7) had provided 173 pages of material about Iraq’s WMD programme, </p>
<p>including 10,000 litres of anthrax unaccounted for. There was a “strong </p>
<p>presumption of its continued existence”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The counter-proliferation progress in other countries, and “Libya in particular” </p>
<p>was “dramatic”. The military action in Iraq had had a “hugely beneficial effect on </p>
<p>the international climate, but this was insufficiently recognised at home”.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>582. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the counter-proliferation successes which had been </p>
<p>registered since the invasion of Iraq were “considerable and he hoped that there would </p>
<p>be further developments in the next few weeks. The Government’s supporters need to </p>
<p>be briefed accordingly.”</p>
<p><b>583. </b> On 16 January, Mr Scarlett informed No.10 of the dates of a series of US </p>
<p>Congressional hearings in February and March relevant to Iraqi WMD.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> Potentially the </p>
<p>most controversial was Mr Tenet’s appearance on 4 March at a closed session of the </p>
<p>Senate Intelligence Committee on pre-conflict Iraq-related intelligence, and there would </p>
<p>almost certainly be an open session. It would be important to stay in contact with US </p>
<p>briefing plans.</p>
<p><b>584. </b> In his State of the Union address on 20 January, President Bush reported that:</p>
<p>“We’re seeking all the facts. Already the Kay report [the ISG Interim Report] </p>
<p>identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and </p>
<p>significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. </p>
<p>Had we failed to act, the dictator’s weapons of mass destruction programs would </p>
<p>continue to this day. Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq </p>
<p>would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations and </p>
<p>encouraging defiance by dictators around the world.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>585.  In January, with no timetable for the publication of the next ISG report, </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Howard proposed a number of options. He recommended that the best </b></p>
<p><b>approach might be to draw a line under the issue of WMD by summer 2004.</b></p>
<p><b>586. </b> On 21 January, after visiting the ISG in Qatar, Baghdad and Basra, Mr Howard </p>
<p>reported “a sense of uncertainty and lack of strategic direction” at the ISG headquarters </p>
<p>in Baghdad: Dr Kay’s successor had not been identified; the timing of future ISG </p>
<p>reports was not known; and there was continuing debate about the extent of the ISG </p>
<p>contribution on counter-terrorism.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> Security remained an issue, but ISG staff morale </p>
<p>seemed high and people were working “incredibly hard”.</p>
<p><b>587. </b> Mr Howard assessed that, despite the good work being done, the overall picture </p>
<p>was not fundamentally different to that described in the Interim Report.</p>
<p><b>588. </b> On the future of the ISG, Mr Howard suggested that the right option might be to </p>
<p>draw a line under the issue of Iraqi WMD by summer 2004. There was no guarantee that </p>
<p>the new Iraqi Government would be prepared to allow the ISG to continue after it took </p>
<p>office and there was a possibility that the ISG’s final analysis would look like the Interim </p>
<p>Report: clear Iraqi intent to preserve and conceal an ability to reconstitute programmes, </p>
<p>but no operational or current production capability.</p>
<p><b>589. </b> Mr Howard identified three options for the next ISG report:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a single, final report around June;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the major substantive report in March or April, with loose ends tied up in June or </p>
<p>July; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a low-key report focused on context and operating environment in March, with a </p>
<p>substantive report in June.</p>
<p><b>590.  On 22 January, Mr Scarlett produced a summary of the ISG’s findings and </b></p>
<p><b>possible points for Mr Blair to make in public.</b></p>
<p><b>591. </b> Mr Scarlett sent No.10 a paper summarising the “current understanding” of the </p>
<p>ISG’s findings on 22 January.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> The paper had been prepared within the Assessments </p>
<p>Staff, in consultation with Mr Howard, but it had been given a limited distribution. It was </p>
<p>not the result of a full JIC Assessment and had not been considered by a CIG.</p>
<p><b>592. </b> The paper summarised what had been found, what remained to be done and </p>
<p>questions raised by the ISG’s work:</p>

<p>“<b>What has been established?</b></p>
<p>“<b>Nuclear Programmes</b></p>
<p>“The ISG have found documents and equipment, related to Iraq’s pre-1991 nuclear </p>
<p>programme … not declared to the UN/IAEA … Iraqi scientists and senior officials </p>
<p>have stated that Saddam intended to reconstitute such a programme once sanctions </p>
<p>were lifted. There is no evidence however, that Saddam explicitly ordered that </p>
<p>research activity should continue for this specific purpose.</p>
<p>“<b>Chemical and biological weapons</b></p>
<p>“The ISG have found documents and equipment at 13 undeclared laboratories and </p>
<p>facilities … There is no clear evidence of a link to a military programme.</p>
<p>“… Legitimate work on biopesticides and other BW stimulants meant that expertise </p>
<p>and production techniques … were maintained …</p>
<p>“The exact purpose of the two trailers discovered by the ISG in May 2003 has yet to </p>
<p>be determined …</p>
<p>“<b>Delivery systems</b></p>
<p>“… ISG have found substantial evidence of research and design work on longer </p>
<p>range delivery systems (up to 1,000km range), and of substantial illegal procurement </p>
<p>for all aspects of Iraq’s missile programme …</p>
<p>“<b>Concealment and destruction</b></p>
<p>“Iraq had failed to declare its programmes and equipment to the UN, and to comply </p>
<p>with its obligations under successive UNSCRs …</p>
<p>“In addition … the ISG have found substantial evidence of the targeted destruction </p>
<p>of documents, equipment and computer files …</p>
<p>“<b>What is still to be done?</b></p>
<p>“… We do not have a complete picture; the ISG continues with its work despite the </p>
<p>difficult operational environment …</p>
<p>“<b>What has not been established?</b></p>
<p>“The ISG have not found chemical or biological weapons, agents or precursors in </p>
<p>militarily significant quantities, nor any long range missiles. They cannot confirm the </p>
<p>existence of active programmes for the development or production of chemical or </p>
<p>biological weapons, or of steps to reconstitute the nuclear programme, after 1998. </p>
<p>They have found nothing to substantiate the repeated reports that WMD was moved </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>542</p>
<p><b>What major questions does this raise?</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Why is the account … different from the intelligence picture before the </p>
<p>conflict, which was broadly agreed by virtually all Western Governments …?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Why did the Iraqi regime undertake such an extensive programme of </p>
<p>concealment and deception at the UN? What were they trying to conceal </p>
<p>and what did they destroy?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Why, when UNMOVIC returned to Iraq in 2002, were so many obstacles </p>
<p>placed in its way …?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was Saddam’s key aim … to preserve the capability to reconstitute his </p>
<p>programmes rapidly once UN sanctions were lifted …?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… Did the fear of appearing weak drive Saddam’s continuing denial and </p>
<p>deception of the international community?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Did Saddam, his colleagues and senior officials believe their own </p>
<p>disinformation?”</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Mr Scarlett suggested a list of points Mr Blair could make in public:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG had not so far found chemical or biological weapons or “evidence of the </p>
<p>continued production of such weapons, or that the nuclear weapons programme </p>
<p>was being reconstituted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It had found “evidence of efforts to maintain BW and nuclear capabilities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a “lot of evidence of planning and design work for missiles well </p>
<p>beyond the permitted range”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG had “also found evidence that equipment and documentation were </p>
<p>destroyed – including to deceive the UN inspectors in the final period before </p>
<p>the conflict – and that Iraq failed to declare activities or otherwise comply with </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG had a lot of work still to do.</p>
<p><b>594. </b> Those points raised “some big questions including”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What was Saddam trying to conceal and why did he take such risks to do it? … </p>
<p>Why did the regime continue to obstruct and defy the inspectors right up to the </p>
<p>last minute?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was Saddam Hussein trying to preserve his capabilities and programmes while </p>
<p>trying to get sanctions lifted as quickly as possible?</p>

<p>would be found, the answer could be: “a lot of work has been going on, there is a lot of </p>
<p>work still to do, and a lot of questions still to answer. We do not know how it will turn out </p>
<p>in the end.”</p>
<p><b>596. </b> If asked whether the Government stood by the intelligence assessment in the </p>

<p>has happened. Again, we do not know what the ISG’s eventual assessment will be.”</p>
<p><b>597. </b> Mr Scarlett described the purpose of the points offered as “a way of looking ahead </p>
<p>to the future”, building on Mr Blair’s comments in his interview with Sir David Frost on </p>
<p>11 January. If they were to be used, the UK “must warn the Americans first”.</p>
<p><b>598. </b> Mr Rycroft described Mr Scarlett’s note to Mr Blair as:</p>
<p>“The first draft of a narrative on WMD to move our position on slightly, by floating </p>
<p>possible explanations for the lack of WMD found so far, through questions rather </p>
<p>than assertions.”</p>

<p><b>606. </b> In an interview for <i>Reuters</i> shortly after his resignation, widely reported in the UK </p>

<p>“I don’t think they [WMD] existed. What everyone was talking about is stockpiles </p>
<p>produced after the end of the last Gulf War and I don’t think there was a large-scale </p>
<p>production program in the nineties.”</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>607. </b> The UK media also gave extensive coverage to comments by Secretary Powell  </p>
<p>on 24 January, including that it was an “open question” whether Iraq held any  </p>
<p>stocks of WMD.</p>
<p>333</p>

<p>“The more that we see the absence of weapons of mass destruction, the more we </p>
<p>see both the Prime Minister and the President of the United States qualify what it is </p>
<p>that the Iraq Survey Group may or may not uncover.”</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Mr Rycroft spoke to the White House to underline the difficulties Secretary Powell’s </p>
<p>comments were causing in the UK.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> Dr Rice urged that, as soon as possible, all public </p>
<p>comments should refer back to resolution 1441: Saddam Hussein had WMD, had used </p>
<p>them in the past and had obligations to destroy them. Resolution 1441 had given him a </p>
<p>final opportunity to comply with his international obligations, which he had failed to take.</p>
<p><b>610. </b> In an interview for <i>The New York Times</i> published on 25 January, Dr Kay said that </p>
<p>Iraq had been “a dangerous place” with the ability to produce WMD, terrorist groups </p>
<p>“passing through” and no central control.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p> But the CIA had missed signs of the “chaos” </p>
<p>in the Iraqi regime that had corrupted Iraq’s weapons capabilities. Iraqi scientists </p>

<p>“Bush was sounding a bit less bullish and a bit more nuanced (‘I think it’s very </p>
<p>important for us [the US Administration] to let the Iraq Survey Group do its work so </p>

<p><b>617. </b> Sir David concluded:</p>
<p>“From the point of view of a White House political strategist, Kay’s line looks </p>
<p>probably not too unhelpful: it is lowering public expectations of future WMD </p>
<p>finds, increasing the pressure for this issue to be brought to closure before the </p>
<p>election season gets going in earnest after Easter, and placing the blame for any </p>

<p><b>Dr Kay’s evidence to the Senate Armed Services Committee, </b></p>
<p><b>28 January 2004</b></p>
<p><b>618. </b> On 28 January, Dr Kay gave evidence to the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In his opening remarks, he stated:</p>
<p>“A great deal has been accomplished by the [ISG] team … I think it important that it </p>
<p>goes on and it is allowed to reach its full conclusion. In fact, I really believe it ought </p>
<p>to be better resourced and totally focused on WMD …</p>
<p>“But I also believe that it is time to begin the fundamental analysis of how we got </p>
<p>here …</p>
<p>“It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgement, and that is most </p>
<p>disturbing …</p>
<p>“In my judgement … Iraq was in clear violation of the terms of resolution 1441…</p>
<p>“We have discovered hundreds of cases, based on both documents, physical </p>
<p>evidence and the testimony of Iraqis, of activities that were prohibited under the </p>
<p>initial UN resolution 687 [1991] and that should have been reported under 1441, with </p>
<p>Iraqi testimony that not only did they not tell the UN about this, they were instructed </p>
<p>not to do it and they hid material.</p>
<p>“I had innumerable analysts who came to me in apology that the world we were </p>
<p>finding was not the world they had thought existed …</p>
<p>“I wish it had been undue influence, because we know how to correct that … </p>
<p>The fact that it wasn’t tells me we’ve got a much more fundamental problem of </p>
<p>understanding what went wrong …</p>
<p>“I regret to say that I think at the end of the work of the ISG there’s still going to be </p>
<p>an unresolvable ambiguity about what happened.</p>
<p>“A lot of that traces to the failure on April 9 [2003] to establish immediately physical </p>
<p>security in Iraq – the unparalleled looting and destruction, a lot of which was directly </p>
<p>intentional, designed by the [Iraqi] security services to cover the tracks of the Iraq </p>
<p>WMD program and their other programs as well …”</p>
<p><b>619. </b> Asked whether it was too early to pronounce that everyone had been wrong, that </p>
<p>weapons might still be hidden, Dr Kay replied:</p>
<p>“It’s theoretically possible … When the ISG wraps up its work … there are still going </p>
<p>to be people to say, ‘You didn’t look everywhere. Isn’t it possible it was hidden </p>
<p>someplace?” and the answer has got to be honestly, ‘Yes, it’s possible’ …</p>

<p><b>620. </b> Mr Blair discussed the ISG with President Bush on 28 January.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that the first ISG Report showed that Saddam Hussein had been in breach of multiple </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions. When the next report came it would be necessary to </p>
<p>ensure that it was properly presented.</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Mr Duelfer wrote in his memoir that Dr Kay’s testimony, “We were all wrong”, had </p>
<p>sounded conclusive even though Dr Kay had been declaring that Iraq was violating UN </p>
<p>resolutions throughout the 1990s and in the lead-up to the war:</p>
<p>“Aside from angering the staff he left in Iraq, Kay’s declarations made it much </p>
<p>more difficult to collect information from Iraqi sources. Once the world had heard </p>
<p>the decrees of the former ISG leader, why should any of the Iraqis provide further </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>548</p>
<p>about Iraq’s biological and chemical weapons, the Government stated that the JIC had </p>
<p>followed convention: “The Key Judgements section is not intended to be a summary of </p>
<p>the main facts in the paper.”</p>
<p><b>627. </b> The Government stated that the September 2002 dossier did present “a balanced </p>
<p>view of the Iraq’s CBW capability based on the intelligence available”, but acknowledged </p>
<p>that presentation of the 45 minutes issue “allowed speculation as to its exact meaning”.</p>
<p><b>628. </b> The Government took “careful note” of the ISC conclusion that the inhibiting effect </p>
<p>of UN inspections was not fully reflected in JIC Assessments, but observed that JIC </p>
<p>Assessments produced in October and December 2002 and in March 2003 did reflect </p>
<p>the point.</p>
<p><b>629. </b> In response to the ISC recommendation that, if individuals in the intelligence </p>
<p>community formally wrote to their line managers with concerns about JIC Assessments </p>
<p>those concerns should be brought to the attention of the JIC Chairman, the Government </p>
<p>stated that it was “important to preserve the line management authority of JIC members </p>
<p>in judging what should be brought to the attention of the JIC Chairman”.</p>
<p><b>630. </b> After the publication of the Hutton Report, the FCO also sent its deferred response </p>

<p>2003 FAC report on the decision to go to war in Iraq.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> The FCO stated:</p>
<p>“We disagree that the 45 minute claim was given undue prominence. The </p>
<p>45 minutes claim came from an established, reliable and long-standing line of </p>
<p>reporting. It was included in an early September Joint Intelligence Committee </p>
<p>(JIC) Assessment as soon as the underlying intelligence had become available. </p>
<p>It was consistent with previous JIC judgements on Iraq’s command and control </p>
<p>arrangements. Other issues were given a similar level of prominence in the dossier: </p>
<p>for example the judgement that Iraq was building up its weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>(WMD) capability and that it was concealing its programmes.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Had Saddam used chemical and biological weapons (CBW) munitions during the </p>
<p>conflict we have no reason to doubt he could have deployed them in this timeframe.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We welcome the Committee’s conclusion that the claims in the September dossier </p>
<p>were well founded … We also welcome the conclusion that allegations of politically </p>
<p>inspired meddling cannot credibly be established.”</p>

<p><b>The decision to establish the Butler Review</b></p>
<p><b>631.  In late January, officials advised Mr Blair that there was “a clear risk” that </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush would set up an inquiry into Iraq intelligence before he was forced </b></p>
<p><b>to do so by Congress.</b></p>
<p><b>632. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald discussed the mounting pressure for inquiries in the UK </p>
<p>and the US with Dr Rice on 29 January.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> He recommended that No.10 and the </p>
<p>White House stay “in the closest touch” to ensure public lines were co-ordinated.</p>
<p><b>633. </b> Sir Nigel told Mr Straw’s office that the US Administration would prefer to make an </p>
<p>announcement itself rather than be pushed into one by Congress or the media. It was </p>
<p>clear that something was “stirring” in Washington. The announcement of an inquiry there </p>
<p>would make it very difficult to hold the line in the UK.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> Mr Powell sent a copy of Sir Nigel’s letter to Mr Blair with the advice:</p>
<p>“You must decide on this with Bush on Tuesday [3 February] before the </p>
<p>[Parliamentary] debate on Wednesday.”</p>
<p>349</p>
<p><b>635. </b> In a minute to Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 30 January, Mr Scarlett set out his </p>
<p>understanding of developments in the US, including concern about a “Notification to </p>
<p>Congress that one piece of intelligence underpinning” Secretary Powell’s presentation to </p>
<p>the UN on 5 February 2003 “came from an unreliable source”, and that CIA analysts had </p>
<p>missed a “fabrication warning”.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Scarlett commented:</p>
<p>“This discredited report was sent to SIS but not issued by them so it was not </p>
<p>reflected in our classified assessments or in the dossier. There is one reference in </p>
<p>the dossier (the Executive Summary) to mobile ‘laboratories’. This was a general </p>
<p>term to cover mobile facilities and was not meant to be distinct from ‘production’ </p>
<p>units. In terms of any press lines it will be sufficient to say that the discredited report </p>
<p>was not issued by SIS.”</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Mr Scarlett added:</p>
<p>“The ground is audibly shifting in Washington. There is a clear risk that the </p>
<p>Administration will set up an Inquiry into the Iraq intelligence. This will take many </p>
<p>months to report and push the whole issue beyond November. It might have the side </p>
<p>effect of prompting an early winding up of the ISG.”</p>

<p>351</p>
<p> He had also argued against an </p>

<p>to go down that route. There was a strong chance that the US would do so, possibly </p>

<p><b>640. </b> On 31 January, Sir David Manning reported growing political pressure on President </p>
<p>Bush to admit intelligence failure and announce an inquiry.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> Asked for his views on </p>
<p>whether there should be an inquiry, President Bush had told the press:</p>
<p>“… I too, want to know the facts. I want to be able to compare what the Iraq Survey </p>
<p>Group has found with what we thought prior to going into Iraq. One thing is for </p>
<p>certain – one thing we do know from Mr Kay’s testimony, as well as from the  </p>
<p>years of intelligence that we had gathered, is that Saddam Hussein was a … </p>
<p>growing danger.”</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Sir David Manning advised that President Bush’s remarks suggested he was </p>

<p><b>646. </b> On the former, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“We know Saddam had WMD. We know the ISG has not yet found weapons, though </p>
<p>it has found evidence of programmes. The truth is that we anticipated finding the </p>
<p>weapons during or shortly after the conflict. So to say we are surprised at the ISG’s </p>
<p>findings is no less than the truth.</p>
<p>“The issue of US/UK good faith can be laid to rest. We received the intelligence. We </p>
<p>honestly believed it.</p>
<p>“The issue now is: was it right; and if it wasn’t, what can we learn about the </p>
<p>difficulties of gathering intelligence in these situations?</p>
<p>“What we can say is this:</p>
<p>“(a) there is no doubt that Saddam had WMD. It was not just US/UK intelligence </p>
<p>agencies that said so, it was many others around the world. In any event, Saddam </p>
<p>used them. The UN when it left in 1998 found stockpiles unaccounted for. That </p>
<p>is why UN resolution 1441 unanimously described his weapons as a threat to </p>
<p>world peace.</p>
<p>“(b) we should exercise some caution in saying definitely no stockpiles now exist. In </p>
<p>the 1990s despite intensive investigation, the full extent of his programmes remained </p>
<p>concealed for years. We know from intelligence pre-war that he intended to conceal </p>
<p>them. The ISG has found ample evidence of an intention to conceal. Look at what </p>
<p>we know now Libya is co-operating, compared with what we could speculate on, on </p>
<p>the basis of intelligence.</p>
<p>“I don’t concede there are no weapons. But I do concede we expected to find them </p>
<p>sooner and there is plainly a legitimate issue about the accuracy of the intelligence.</p>
<p>“(c) let us get it clear what the ISG has said so far and what Dr Kay has said.</p>
<p>“The ISG has found:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Evidence of efforts to maintain BW and nuclear capabilities including </p>
<p>equipment, documents and organisms. Teams of scientists were retained to </p>
<p>work on them.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Planning and design work for missiles of up to 1,000km in range.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Equipment and documentation being systematically destroyed …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undeclared laboratories and facilities that have a potential for BW and CW </p>
<p>production, that should have been declared to the UN.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In 2002, Iraq successfully tested an UAV with a range of 500km.</p>
<p>“All of these things are a breach of the UN resolutions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>552</p>
<p>“Therefore, though the ISG have not found evidence of actual weapons, they have </p>
<p>found evidence of programmes. Any of this would have triggered a justification for </p>
<p>conflict.</p>
<p>“Dr Kay has said:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He believes no major new production of weapons occurred post-1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He speculates that Saddam may have been told tales about the </p>
<p>programmes or that some stuff moved to Syria.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>But some old stockpiles may well exist and the capabilities and </p>
<p>determination remained intact.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That Iraq was ‘a very dangerous place’.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the conflict was justified, and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That the US/UK did not interfere with the intelligence.</p>
<p>“He makes a claim also that Saddam was trying to manufacture ricin up to the last </p>
<p>minute … but UK services at least don’t seem to know the provenance of this.</p>
<p>“(d) however, in view of the fact that we certainly thought production of new weapons </p>
<p>was continuing and it may be that it wasn’t, it is sensible to learn the intelligence </p>
<p>lessons.</p>
<p>“Therefore, the US is going to have a Commission of Experts look into it.</p>
<p>“The UK will refer the issue back to the Intelligence and Security Committee …</p>
<p>“Meanwhile the ISG will continue its work on the ground since there are at least </p>
<p>26 million pages of documents and many unvisited sites still to follow up.”</p>
<p><b>647. </b> On the wider threat from WMD, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“Whatever the intelligence from Iraq, let us be in no doubt about the threat.</p>
<p>“The threat of terrorism and proliferation of WMD continues. It would be disastrous if </p>
<p>doubts about the strength of intelligence in Iraq blinded us to the danger. We know </p>
<p>that Iran and North Korea are trying to develop nuclear weapons and it is only since </p>
<p>Iraq that real pressure on them has started to pay off.</p>
<p>“We now know that Libya was far closer then we thought to nuclear capability and on </p>
<p>CW than we thought; and, since Iraq they are working with us to eliminate it …”</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“If we have to accept that some of the Iraq intelligence was wrong, we will do so. </p>
<p>But let us not either (a) lurch to the opposite extreme and start pretending Iraq </p>
<p>had nothing; or (b) let any intelligence inaccuracy move us off confronting the </p>
<p>WMD issue.</p>

<p>“So we need:</p>
<p>To put ourselves in the right place on accepting some intelligence may have been </p>
<p>wrong and letting that be looked into.</p>
<p>To get across what Kay and the ISG are actually saying.</p>
<p>To reassert the importance of the WMD question.”</p>
<p><b>649. </b> On 1 February, US media reported that President Bush would shortly be </p>
<p>announcing “a bipartisan, independent commission to investigate apparent flaws in </p>
<p>intelligence used to justify the Iraq war”.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>650. </b> Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Powell on 1 February.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> Secretary Powell explained </p>
<p>that the US planned to make an announcement about the independent commission, </p>
<p>probably on 2 February. Mr Straw briefed Secretary Powell on the discussion in the UK. </p>
<p>It would be important, if possible, to make announcements at the same time.</p>
<p><b>651. </b> Following a discussion with Dr Rice that evening, Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote to </p>
<p>Mr Geoffrey Adams, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary, reporting that Mr Blair, </p>
<p>Mr Straw and others had been “reflecting on how to handle the issue of intelligence on </p>
<p>Iraqi and other WMD in the light of developing US plans”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>554</p>
<p><b>654. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Straw met early on 2 February.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> Sir Andrew Turnbull (Cabinet </p>
<p>Secretary), Sir David Omand, Mr Scarlett, Sir Richard Dearlove, Dr David Pepper </p>
<p>(Director, GCHQ), Mr Ehrman, Mr Powell, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Baroness Morgan  </p>
<p>(No.10 Director of Political and Government Relations), and other officials from No.10 </p>
<p>were present.</p>
<p><b>655. </b> The meeting concluded that the Government would set up a committee to review </p>
<p>the intelligence on WMD, and agreed its Terms of Reference and membership.  </p>
<p>It “should be wider than the ISC”; and it “should look at intelligence on WMD in general, </p>
<p>not just Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>656. </b> In their video conference on 2 February, Mr Blair and President Bush discussed </p>
<p>their intentions to establish commissions to examine aspects of the pre-conflict </p>
<p>intelligence on Iraq and WMD.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p> They also discussed the timescale for the ISG to </p>
<p>produce its final report and whether, in the meantime, further material from the ISG’s </p>
<p>Interim Report could be used in public.</p>
<p><b>657. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, the ISG had already found weapons programmes, plans to </p>
<p>restart programmes after the UNMOVIC inspectors left and hitherto undiscovered </p>
<p>breaches of UN resolutions. The public and media had not digested the implications </p>
<p>of the reports and Dr Kay’s remarks. There was enough in the ISG’s findings to justify </p>
<p>US/UK military action. When the findings were linked to the wider picture, it would </p>
<p>have been irresponsible not to take action on Iraq.</p>
<p><b>658. </b> Following the discussion, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent draft Terms of Reference for </p>
<p>the UK committee to Dr Rice, stating that they had been revised in the light of the video </p>
<p>conference, but were “very much a working draft”.</p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>659. </b> In a subsequent letter, Sir Nigel wrote that he had made clear that the UK </p>
<p>Terms of Reference, which Dr Rice had not yet seen, were narrower that those </p>
<p>under consideration in the White House, and the aim was to complete the review </p>
<p>“as soon as possible”.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p><b>660. </b> On 2 February, Mr Scarlett sent Mr Powell suggested amendments to Mr Blair’s </p>

<p>Mr Scarlett’s amendments underlined, was passed to Mr Blair as part of the brief for his </p>
<p>appearance before the House of Commons Liaison Committee.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> The amendments </p>
<p>included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… The UN when it left in 1998 noted that large stockpiles of weapons and </p>
<p>agents were unaccounted for. They are still unaccounted for. That is why UN </p>
<p>resolution 1441 unanimously recognised the threat posed to international peace </p>
<p>and security by Iraq’s proliferation of WMD and long range missiles.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… Look at what we know about Libya’s CW weapons, now that they are co-</p>
<p>operating compared with what we could obtain through intelligence.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [T]hough the ISG has not found evidence of actual weapons, they have </p>
<p>found substantial evidence of prohibited activities”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Three additions to the list of points made by Dr Kay:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“Iraq was in clear violation of the terms of UNSCR 1441”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“Iraq deliberately waged a policy of destruction and looting”.</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“[T]he ISG has learned things about Iraq’s WMD programmes that no UN </p>
<p>inspector could have learned”.</p>
<p><b>662. </b> On 2 February, UK news media reported the imminent announcement of a decision </p>
<p>to set up a UK inquiry into intelligence on WMD.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>663. <i></b> The Guardian </i>described the forthcoming announcement as “a major u-turn” </p>
<p>which had been “forced upon” Mr Blair by President Bush’s decision to hold an inquiry </p>
<p>in the US.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p><b>664. </b> In his evidence to the Liaison Committee on 3 February, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“The whole reason why we took this action in Iraq was because of the risk posed by </p>
<p>an unstable state with weapons of mass destruction capability and the risk that at </p>
<p>some point, not necessarily immediately, but at some point in the future, that then </p>
<p>gets into the hands of those who are terrorists with terrorist intent.”</p>

<p>accuracy of intelligence on Iraqi WMD up to March 2003, and to examine any </p>
<p>discrepancies between the intelligence gathered, evaluated and used by the </p>
<p>Government before the conflict, and between that intelligence and what has been </p>
<p>discovered by the Iraq Survey Group since the end of the conflict; and to make </p>
<p>recommendations to the Prime Minister for the future on the gathering, evaluation </p>
<p>and use of intelligence on WMD, in the light of the difficulties of operating in </p>
<p>countries of concern.”</p>
<p><b>666. </b> Mr Straw explained that, while the ISC, FAC and Hutton inquiries had been </p>
<p>under way:</p>
<p>“… three proposals were put before the House in June, July and late October on </p>
<p>Opposition motions calling for wider inquiries into aspects of the Government’s </p>
<p>handling of events in the run-up to the Iraq war. At the time, the Government resisted </p>
<p>those calls, including on the ground that the inquiries already under way should be </p>
<p>allowed to complete their work. Later, both the Prime Minister and I also referred to </p>
<p>the continuing activities of the Iraq Survey Group.</p>
<p>“Over the past week, we have seen the publication of the Hutton Report and </p>
<p>the evidence of Dr David Kay, former head of the Iraq Survey Group, to a US </p>
<p>Congressional Committee. It has also emerged that the Iraq Survey Group may take </p>
<p>longer to produce a final report than we had all originally envisaged. All that has led </p>
<p>the Government now to judge that it is appropriate to establish this new inquiry of </p>
<p>Privy Councillors.”</p>

<p>The section of the draft speech on good news stories of intelligence work </p>
<p>against Libya and AQ Khan</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> appeared to pre-empt plans for co-ordinated </p>
<p>speeches by President Bush and Mr Blair which had been under discussion for </p>
<p>some time.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was uncomfortable with the draft’s presentation of the role played by </p>
<p>intelligence from allies in the US assessment. The implication was that it had </p>
<p>been the crucial factor: “Examples: ‘Now, did this information make a difference </p>
<p>in my thinking? You bet it did …’”</p>
<p>375</p>
<p><b>673. </b> In his speech, Mr Tenet explained that intelligence analysts’ differences on several </p>
<p>important aspects of Iraq’s WMD programmes were spelt out in the NIE:</p>
<p>“They never said there was an ‘imminent’ threat. Rather, they painted an objective </p>
<p>assessment for our policy-makers of a brutal dictator who was continuing his efforts </p>
<p>to deceive and build programs that might constantly surprise us and threaten </p>
<p>our interests.”</p>
<p><b>674. </b> Mr Tenet compared the ISG’s interim findings with the October 2002 NIE, </p>
<p>emphasising that any comparison was provisional: the ISG’s work was “nowhere near </p>
<p>85 percent finished”. The ISG needed more time and more data.</p>
<p><b>675. </b> The references to the impact of intelligence received from foreign partners, on </p>
<p>which Mr Dowse had commented, remained unchanged. Mr Tenet stated:</p>
<p>“Several sensitive reports crossed my desk from two sources characterized by our </p>
<p>foreign partners as ‘established and reliable’.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Now, did this information make a difference in my thinking? You bet it did. As </p>
<p>this and other information came across my desk, it solidified and reinforced the </p>

<p><b>676. </b> Mr Tenet concluded that, based on the data collected over the previous 10 years, </p>
<p>it would have been difficult for analysts to reach conclusions other than those in the NIE. </p>
<p>But the intelligence community needed to reflect on a number of questions, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Did the history of Saddam Hussein’s behaviour cause the intelligence </p>
<p>community to overlook alternative scenarios?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Did the failure to spot how close Saddam Hussein came to acquiring a nuclear </p>
<p>weapon in the early 1990s lead to over-estimation of his programmes in 2002?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the absence of information flowing from a repressive regime considered </p>

<p>“Blair was very well informed on the WMD issue, and I had the opportunity to go </p>
<p>into greater depth about my plans and tactics than I had with President Bush or </p>
<p>Condoleezza Rice … I highlighted that I felt it was important to take this historic </p>
<p>opportunity to record the <i>reasons</i> for Saddam’s decisions on WMD and to </p>
<p>understand where the regime was headed …</p>
<p>“Prime Minister Blair asked questions about the sources of information and how </p>
<p>I would arbitrate between the views of differing experts. He did not make strong </p>
<p>suggestions, but carefully inquired where I was headed and asked about rough </p>
<p>estimates on timing. I said I felt … that when sovereignty was returned to Iraq </p>
<p>on 30 June, this would greatly affect ISG operations. I promised to keep the UK </p>
<p>Government fully informed.”</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>682. </b> During a wider discussion on Iraq on 9 February, Sir Nigel Sheinwald told Dr Rice </p>
<p>about Mr Blair’s meeting with Mr Duelfer.</p>
<p>378</p>
<p> Mr Blair remained concerned about the </p>
<p>nature of the public debate, which Sir Nigel stated was “either there were stockpiles </p>
<p>of WMD, or nothing at all. We needed to publicise the reality of the position. The next </p>
<p>interim ISG report … would be very important.” Dr Rice agreed the need to “keep </p>
<p>repeating our position”, and to work together on the next report.</p>
<p><b>683. </b> Mr Dowse updated Sir Nigel Sheinwald on the survey of five sites where </p>
<p>intelligence suggested WMD-related items had been hidden underwater.</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> It had been </p>
<p>suggested during Mr Blair’s video conference with President Bush on 2 February that </p>
<p>the ISG was hopeful of finding objects hidden in the Tigris River. Mr Dowse reported </p>
<p>that specialist divers had failed to find six rectangular metal objects located by sonar </p>
<p>on 21 and 22 January and that the survey of a second site had not located anything </p>
<p>suspicious.</p>
<p><b>684. </b> Mr Scarlett discussed co-ordination between the UK and US with Mr McLaughlin </p>
<p>and Mr Hadley in Washington on 9 February.</p>
<p>380</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett said that, from a London </p>
<p>perspective, there was an urgent need to get more detailed factual information about </p>
<p>the work of the ISG into the public domain. The next ISG report would need to be better </p>
<p>presented and less indigestible than the last.</p>
<p><b>685. </b> In a meeting the following day with Ms Jami Miscik, CIA Deputy Director of </p>
<p>Intelligence, Mr Scarlett set out “the broad gameplan for getting some balance back into </p>
<p>the public debate on WMD”.</p>

<p>He stated that “[m]ore widely”, a “succession of speeches, articles and media events” </p>
<p>were needed “to highlight the wider proliferation problem”.</p>
<p><b>686. </b> Mr Scarlett commented on Mr Tenet’s “spotlighting” in his speech:</p>
<p>“… particular intelligence from a trusted intelligence partner (ie the UK). The </p>
<p>media of course were watching like hawks for any signs of UK/US splits. Some </p>
<p>had interpreted Tenet’s comments as laying the ground to shift the blame for faulty </p>
<p>intelligence to SIS.”</p>
<p><b>687. </b> Mr Scarlett also discussed the debate in Washington and its focus on whether </p>
<p>intelligence had been politicised, and whether the assessments had been wrong. On the </p>
<p>former, there were comments about the highly politicised environment and the extent </p>
<p>to which “very persistent lines of questioning” from politicians might have led analysts </p>
<p>“further towards particular judgements than they would have moved of their own accord”.</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Wood, who accompanied Mr Scarlett to the meeting, commented afterwards </p>
<p>that, in the wake of Mr Tenet’s speech, there remained “ample potential for a serious </p>
<p>public CIA/White House blame game between now and the [US presidential] election”.</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Mr Blair described his meeting with Mr Duelfer to President Bush during their video </p>

<p> Mr Blair said that, if there were an ISG interim report </p>
<p>by the end of March, it would define the issue for some time. It therefore needed to be </p>
<p>detailed, with factual backing, and carefully handled. Mr Duelfer had a clear idea of </p>
<p>what was needed, including background on the Iraqi concealment effort, destruction of </p>
<p>documentation, and the compartmentalisation of the WMD programmes.</p>
<p><b>690. </b> SIS sent No.10 a copy of a senior officer’s speaking note dated 10 February for an </p>

<p><b>694. </b> On 13 February, the British Embassy Washington reported that, although </p>
<p>President Bush’s “big pitch on proliferation” had had some success in broadening the </p>
<p>political debate about WMD, a poll in <i>The Washington Post</i> suggested that a majority </p>
<p>of Americans believed the President had intentionally exaggerated evidence that Iraq </p>
<p>had WMD.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>695. </b> The Embassy also reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee had decided </p>
<p>to broaden its investigation, previously restricted to the performance of the intelligence </p>

<p>388</p>

<p>The CIA had released an internal speech by Ms Miscik to <i>The</i> <i>Washington </i></p>

<p>several occasions when analysts mistakenly believed that Iraq weapons data </p>
<p>had been confirmed by multiple sources when in fact it had come from a single </p>
<p>source” and that Mr Tenet had “ordered an end to the long-standing practice of </p>
<p>withholding from analysts details about the clandestine agents who provide the </p>
<p>information”.</p>

<p><i>The New York Times</i> on 13 February had quoted “senior intelligence officials” </p>

<p>391</p>
<p> It was “very different from </p>

<p><b>700. </b> The No.10 briefing for Mr Blair’s video conference with President Bush on </p>

<p> Mr Blair should inform President Bush that he was </p>
<p>working on his own speech “to produce a philosophical rationale for our action on WMD </p>

<p>“They do not require you or your report to come to conclusions about these lines of </p>

<p><b>716. </b> The material proposed for inclusion by Mr Scarlett included:</p>

<p>ricin for weaponisation and that as of March 2003 it was being developed into </p>
<p>stable liquid to deliver as aerosol in small rockets, cluster bombs and smoke </p>
<p>generators.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>of white phosphorous, a potential precursor for nerve and blister agents.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>do his drafting for him.”</p>
<p>403</p>
<p><b>719. </b> In his memoir, Mr Duelfer described the relationship with Mr Scarlett:</p>
<p>“I met … John Scarlett … and stayed in touch with him and his office throughout the </p>
<p>process … He wanted to be certain that the ISG had access to the same data that </p>
<p>the United Kingdom had …</p>
<p>“I valued the direct involvement of Scarlett. Some questioned his suggestions for </p>

<p><b>720. </b> Mr Duelfer also wrote:</p>
<p>“Scarlett and I had spoken in person in London and I had requested that he bring </p>
<p>to my attention any aspects that I might have overlooked. The particular points </p>
<p>he recalled from the earlier Kay Report had been further investigated since their </p>
<p>publication and found to be without consequence. The nuggets were fool’s gold, </p>

<p><b>722. </b> Mr Blair said that Mr Duelfer must remain in charge of production of the next </p>

<p>the next report should lead people to the conclusion that “<i>something</i>” was going on in </p>
<p>Iraq in breach of UN resolutions, even if the material did not lead to concrete evidence of </p>
<p>actual weapons. The next step, probably in a further report, would be to set out exactly </p>

<p>found v[ery] persuasive in the Oct 2003 background draft?”</p>
<p>407</p>
<p><b>726. </b> In a note to No.10 officials on 15 March, Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“As for the ISG, the problem is that they don’t seem to understand that, at present, </p>
<p>opinion thinks there is either a WMD finding or nothing. Actually there is a mystery </p>
<p>as to what happened to the physical evidence but it was plain much was going on </p>
<p>in breach of UN resolutions. It is the latter point that the further interim report could </p>
<p>deal with, eg by disclosing transcripts of interviews with Iraqi scientists and officials </p>
<p>as per the background paper in October. We need to work intensively on this with </p>
<p>the US this week.”</p>
<p>408</p>
<p><b>727.  Mr Blair’s initial view of the draft ISG Status Report was that it was better </b></p>
<p><b>than expected.</b></p>
<p><b>728.  Mr Blair was clear that the principal messages – that Saddam Hussein had </b></p>
<p><b>been in breach of Security Council resolutions and that his behaviour had raised </b></p>

<p><b>729. </b> The first copy of the draft ISG Status Report was received in London on </p>

<p>BW – “This is weaker and lacking detail. Almost all the points from Kay’s </p>

<p><b>731. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that Mr Duelfer had included only a few of the UK’s suggestions </p>
<p>and seemed to be trying to avoid going into detail, especially if it came from Dr Kay’s </p>
<p>Interim Report. There were “numerous instances” where Mr Duelfer could have brought </p>
<p>out breaches of resolutions, but did not.</p>
<p><b>732. </b> Mr Scarlett concluded:</p>
<p>“Overall, this is a carefully written, ‘strategic’ document designed to restore or to </p>
<p>reinforce the credibility of the ISG and to lay the groundwork for future conclusions in </p>
<p>a final report …”</p>
<p><b>733. </b> Addressing tactics, Mr Scarlett added:</p>
<p>“We will concentrate on repeating our previous proposals for inclusion of further </p>
<p>detail … We will also point up the many opportunities for emphasising breaches of </p>
<p>UNSCRs …”</p>
<p><b>734. </b> Mr Scarlett reported that his US interlocutors were:</p>
<p>“… very clear that ‘comments’ must come from the intelligence community and not </p>
<p>the policy makers … Duelfer is already feeling sensitive to ‘pressure’ from London …”</p>
<p><b>735. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed the impact of the next ISG interim report </p>
<p>on 16 March.</p>
<p>410</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that the first draft was better than expected. Although it </p>
<p>contained nothing completely new, it showed that Iraq had been in clear breach of UN </p>
<p>resolutions. It was important to keep some of the “colour” in the report, but even as it </p>
<p>stood it was quite powerful: “it helped attack the argument that the Coalition should find </p>
<p>physical evidence or the war was unjustified”.</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Mr Blair chaired a meeting to discuss the ISG on 17 March, attended by </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett, Mr Howard, Mr Dowse, a senior SIS official and officials from No.10.</p>
<p>411</p>
<p><b>737. </b> In response to Mr Scarlett’s advice on the timetable for the next interim report, </p>
<p>Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“There could be no question of our seeking to influence the material in the report. </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer must set out the facts as he saw them.</p>
<p>“But (a) an interim report was necessary (b) the material should be set out clearly </p>
<p>(c) presentation of the report was important.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>568</p>
<p><b>738. </b> Mr Blair’s initial view of the draft was that it was:</p>
<p>“… better than expected. The whereabouts of the physical evidence remained </p>
<p>unresolved. But an unbiased reader could only conclude that Saddam had been in </p>
<p>breach of SCRs and that he was involved in highly suspicious activities.”</p>
<p><b>739. </b> In discussion of the detailed text, the following points were identified:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair thought the section on procurement needed more detail and clarity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett thought the points on Iraq’s nuclear activities were “too firm”. The </p>
<p>report “needed to point out the possible non-nuclear dual use potential for some </p>
<p>of this equipment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair “wanted background explanations on ‘dual use goods’: the regime had </p>
<p>gone to elaborate lengths to obtain material allegedly for fertiliser or insecticide </p>
<p>production and the suspicious nature of this should be picked up”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The report should make clear that “deception and concealment operations </p>
<p>continued right up to the outbreak of the conflict” and ask “why such elaborate </p>
<p>deception was needed if there was nothing to hide”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need to “underline that Blix had been systematically hindered”, including </p>
<p>over interviews with scientists.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Quotations from interviewees would add verisimilitude to the report.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“We should underline the deliberate destruction of evidence and sanitisation of </p>
<p>sites eg repairing of buildings during the conflict.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There should be more material on Korean missile technology.</p>
<p><b>740. </b> Mr Scarlett said that the interim report would “flag up problems over eg the alleged </p>
<p>BW mobile laboratories and the unexpected absence of battlefield CW”.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> Mr Blair concluded that Mr Duelfer “needed to be clear about the ‘top line’ of his </p>
<p>report”. Based on the draft, that was that Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“(a) had been in clear breach of SCRs and (b) his behaviour raised immense </p>
<p>suspicions, even if we had yet to pin down the exact nature of his machinations … </p>
<p>[T]here could be no question of influencing the material that appeared in the report. </p>
<p>But it was important that, as a document, it held together as a logical, coherent and </p>
<p>well-documented whole.”</p>
<p><b>742. </b> Mr Scarlett discussed the ISG report in a video conference with Mr Duelfer, </p>
<p>Maj Gen Dayton and the CIA on 18 March.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>743. </b> Mr Scarlett told Sir Nigel Sheinwald that Mr Duelfer felt the report would need to </p>
<p>be “heavily sanitised” to avoid public exposure of operational details of lines of enquiry </p>

<p>being pursued by the ISG. Two options were under consideration: sanitising the draft for </p>
<p>public release, or producing a three- to five-page executive summary.</p>
<p><b>744. </b> Mr Rycroft commented to Mr Blair that Mr Duelfer’s suggested approach was </p>
<p>“worrying”, and that Mr Scarlett and Sir Nigel Sheinwald would be pursuing the issue </p>
<p>with the US.</p>
<p>413</p>
<p><b>745. </b> On 22 March, Mr Scarlett told Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the ISG had reported the </p>
<p>previous day that Mr Duelfer had decided that the sanitised version of the full report </p>
<p>would need to remove all the paragraphs on the direction of future investigation, as </p>
<p>well as the items that were policy and source sensitive.</p>
<p>414</p>
<p> As a result, he had directed </p>
<p>that work should focus on a short summary, which was “broadbrush” and gave “little </p>
<p>supporting detail”.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> Mr Scarlett added that the points which stood out were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a focus on the use of illicit funds for procurement” although there was “a big </p>
<p>gap between the funds raised (several billion dollars) and those allocated to the </p>
<p>Military and Intelligence Commission ($500m)”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“no CBW weapons found nor any agent production facilities”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“unresolved questions over research into CBW agents and planned chemical </p>
<p>agent production, but little detail given”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“items on the high speed rail gun and explosive test facilities which have </p>
<p>possible nuclear weapons implications”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“little new information in the section on delivery systems”.</p>
<p><b>747. </b> Mr Scarlett “wondered” whether the change in Mr Duelfer’s position reflected </p>
<p>“advice from Washington”, but he had “no evidence”, and it might well have been </p>
<p>“generated within the ISG on operational grounds”.</p>
<p><b>748. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that he had “made it clear” to Mr Duelfer and to the CIA in </p>
<p>Washington “that the clear preference for policy makers in London is for publication  </p>
<p>of a sanitised version of the full report”.</p>
<p><b>749. </b> On instruction from Mr Blair, Sir Nigel Sheinwald raised UK concerns about the </p>
<p>drafting of the report with Dr Rice on 22 March.</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> Sir Nigel told Dr Rice that:</p>
<p>“Duelfer now seemed to have decided against publishing any of the report itself, </p>
<p>and had circulated a five page summary in the form of his intended Congressional </p>
<p>testimony. This was in fact similar to the technique used last October by David Kay, </p>
<p>which had not worked at the time. But Kay’s unclassified summary was a good deal </p>
<p>more detailed than Duelfer’s draft. We seemed to be going backwards.”</p>

<p><b>750. </b> Sir Nigel explained that the UK was “not asking for the report to be over-egged. We </p>
<p>should be honest and say that there were no clear answers on what had happened.” But </p>
<p>it was important that Mr Duelfer should be able to conclude that, at the very least, Iraq </p>
<p>was in breach of UN resolutions.</p>
<p><b>751. </b> Sir Nigel commented:</p>
<p>“The problem is that the draft is getting worse, not better from our point of view; and </p>
<p>it will be difficult to secure a substantial change of direction at this stage. But we will </p>
<p>try. John Scarlett is in touch separately with the CIA.”</p>
<p><b>752. </b> Mr Scarlett discussed the ISG draft report at a video conference on 23 March with </p>
<p>Mr McLaughlin, Ms Miscik, Mr Duelfer, Maj Gen Dayton, Mr Howard and an Australian </p>
<p>representative.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> Mr Duelfer was working on three documents: the classified report; an </p>
<p>unclassified summary; and his personal statement to the Congressional Committees. </p>
<p>The UK had seen the first two and was expecting the third shortly. Mr Duelfer </p>
<p>emphasised that his personal statement would make clear that Iraq had been in breach </p>
<p>of UN resolutions.</p>
<p><b>753. </b> Mr Duelfer also reported that three senior analysts had left the ISG, unhappy with </p>
<p>what they expected the report to cover. They had felt that Mr Duelfer’s reluctance to </p>
<p>draw conclusions reflected political interference rather than his stated position that he </p>
<p>needed to familiarise himself with his new responsibilities first. There were concerns that </p>
<p>the three might make their views public.</p>
<p><b>754. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald discussed the draft report with Dr Rice later on 23 March.</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He said that the “key” was “a clear message that, whatever construction was to be </p>
<p>placed on what the ISG had found or not found, UNSCRs had been breached and </p>
<p>suspicious activity was continuing under Saddam”.</p>
<p><b>755. </b> Sir Nigel commented that the discussion had been more encouraging than might </p>
<p>have been expected. It could still prove difficult to persuade Mr Duelfer “to change tack </p>
<p>completely”, but Sir Nigel’s contacts with Dr Rice and Mr Scarlett’s with the CIA seemed </p>
<p>to have “shaken up” the CIA to some extent. There should now be an opportunity to </p>
<p>strengthen the text to some degree.</p>
<p><b>756. </b> Mr Duelfer visited London on 26 March to discuss the ISG Status Report.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>757. </b> Mr Scarlett reported that the position had moved on significantly. Two documents </p>
<p>had been prepared:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the full, classified Status Report, addressed to Mr Tenet and to be copied to </p>
<p>Congress; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer’s testimony to the Congressional Committee hearings on 30 and </p>
<p>31 March.</p>
<p><b>758. </b> Mr Scarlett wrote that the testimony replaced an earlier unclassified summary </p>
<p>of the Status Report. It was a “more forceful” document and would need only light </p>
<p>adjustment for public release.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> Mr Scarlett also reported that Mr Duelfer intended to draft a final report over the </p>
<p>summer and was looking to “surge” additional staff. Mr Howard was considering how the </p>
<p>UK might help.</p>
<p><b>760. </b> Mr Blair, who was shown Mr Scarlett’s report by Sir Nigel Sheinwald, commented </p>
<p>in the margin that the additional staff were “obviously vital”.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p><b>761. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald advised Mr Blair that the text of Mr Duelfer’s testimony was </p>
<p>an improvement on earlier texts, but the media was “still likely to judge it thin” and the </p>
<p>points Mr Duelfer intended to emphasise were “very process-oriented”.</p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>762. </b> Sir Nigel wrote:</p>
<p>“… our pressure should now shift from the substance of the report (where we have </p>
<p>made little headway) to the handling. If you agree I suggest the following steps on </p>
<p>Monday [29 March]:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need to ensure that the CIA take as little as possible out for the sanitised </p>
<p>version. We need all the detail we can secure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Duelfer should prepare a short summary … This must include a clear </p>
<p>statement of breach of SCRs … The summary needs to bring out new and </p>
<p>suspicious evidence.The Assessments Staff should pass a draft to the </p>
<p>Americans.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… [H]e needs to prepare a clear brief statement for the broadcast media …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We need supporting media appearances in both the US and UK, in parallel. </p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary is being lined up here. We need to ensure that the </p>
<p>Americans have made a similar plan – last time it was all last minute.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>This will require action on several fronts: Hill/Bartlett, Scarlett/CIA, me/</p>
<p>Condi, possibly Jack [Straw]/Powell. It will be too late by the time you speak </p>

<p>“<b>Do you agree that these are the main things we should be focusing on?</b>”</p>
<p><b>763. </b> Mr Blair replied: “Yes but if the report is weak it will be v[ery] hard to succeed.”</p>
<p>421</p>
<p><b>764. </b> No.10 sent a separate record of the meeting between Mr Duelfer and Sir Nigel </p>
<p>Sheinwald and Mr Scarlett to Mr Straw’s Private Office.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> The record stated:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Duelfer said that he hoped to put together a ‘compelling case’ that the Saddam </p>
<p>regime had put in place a system to ‘sustain the intellectual capital’ for a </p>
<p>WMD programme, with a ‘break-out capacity’ once a decision to reinstate the </p>
<p>programme was taken.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Duelfer said that, while he was slightly more optimistic than when he took up </p>
<p>the job that actual WMD might be found, the odds were still that they would not </p>
<p>be located. He was looking into the possibility that some had been smuggled </p>
<p>into Syria.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had not realised the extent of the fears of potential interviewees, either of </p>
<p>prosecution by the Americans or of assassination by former colleagues.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If stocks of WMD did not exist, then they would have been destroyed long before </p>
<p>the Iraq campaign.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The core group around Saddam had been remarkably successful in eroding </p>
<p>sanctions up to 9/11, including by manipulating some members of the Security </p>
<p>Council. He believed that the ISG would be able to demonstrate that the regime </p>
<p>had been thwarting UN sanctions and making plans to resuscitate its WMD </p>
<p>programmes … It was clear that the regime’s ultimate goal had been to obtain </p>
<p>nuclear weapons. There had been a policy of continuing WMD development </p>
<p>under the cover of ‘dual use’ programmes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Duelfer said that Washington might have misled us about his touchiness about </p>
<p>UK advice: in fact he welcomed advice although he could not guarantee he </p>
<p>would take it. He would take into account advice on public perceptions in the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The interim report would be a status report, with no new revelations, and a </p>
<p>forward look … Duelfer would certainly not be pulling back on Kay’s fundamental </p>
<p>contention that Saddam had been in clear breach of resolution 1441.”</p>
<p><b>765. </b> Mr Blair commented that Mr Duelfer “still needs to list any UN breaches with </p>

<p>424</p>
<p><b>767. </b> The key points included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq was remarkably successful in eroding UN sanctions. Containment strategy </p>
<p>was being systematically undermined by several countries including key </p>
<p>members of the UNSC.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq derived billions of dollars between 1999 and 2003 from oil smuggling, </p>
<p>kickbacks and abuse of the Oil-for-Food [OFF] programme. This was outside the </p>
<p>control of the UN and free for the regime to spend without restriction.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ISG has information regarding dual-use facilities and ongoing research suitable </p>
<p>for a capability to produce CBW at short notice.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“ISG has also found evidence to indicate Iraqi interest in preserving and </p>
<p>expanding the knowledge needed to design and develop nuclear weapons.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In addition … the ISG has continued to uncover very robust programmes for </p>

<p>426</p>
<p><b>770. </b> The Status Report incorporated many of the key points sent to Mr Duelfer  </p>
<p>by the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Challenges. Iraqi managers, scientists and engineers were extremely reluctant </p>

<p>Nuclear weapons. ISG analysis suggested “Iraqi interest in preserving and </p>
<p>expanding the knowledge needed to design and develop nuclear weapons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Delivery systems. The ISG had continued to uncover “a very robust program for </p>
<p>delivery systems that were not reported to the UN. New information has been </p>
<p>discovered relating to long range ballistic missile development and Unmanned </p>
<p>Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Regime intent. Mr Duelfer had instilled a new focus on the question of regime </p>
<p>intent. It was “critically important to understand the intentions of the regime” </p>
<p>when putting other activities into context.</p>
<p><b>771. </b> Mr Blair commented on the absence of media coverage of Mr Duelfer’s testimony:</p>

<p><b>773. </b> On 8 April, Mr Quarrey advised Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“The Report received little coverage, although it did usefully get some information </p>

<p>security in Baghdad and Basra was affecting ISG operational planning.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> A shortage </p>
<p>of vehicles with armoured protection was complicating efforts to complete outstanding </p>

<p><b>779. </b> On 13 May, Mr Howard wrote to Mr Scarlett about the future of the ISG.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>advised that the ISG still had much work to complete, including collection activities at </p>
<p>suspect sites, interviews of HVDs, and analysis of millions of documents. Its ability to </p>
<p>continue those tasks after 30 June was uncertain and future command and control </p>
<p>arrangements were in a state of “flux”.</p>
<p><b>780. </b> Mr Howard reported that Mr Duelfer expected to “produce a detailed report” in the </p>
<p>late summer/early autumn. While that would “not necessarily draw the line underneath </p>
<p>the question of WMD in Iraq” it was “likely to make provisional conclusions”. That would </p>
<p>“almost certainly signify in the public mind the ‘final word’ from the ISG on Iraq WMD”.</p>
<p><b>781. </b> After the transfer of sovereignty on 30 June, the ISG would focus increasingly </p>
<p>on analysis of Iraq’s intentions and future WMD programmes, and decision-making </p>
<p>in Saddam Hussein’s regime. The report was “unlikely to focus on whether Iraq has </p>
<p>disarmed, which was of course UNMOVIC’s focus”.</p>
<p><b>782. </b> Mr Howard also wrote that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG was “likely to survive” to deal with other tasks after the release of its </p>
<p>“final report” on WMD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had “benefited considerably” from having the ISG Deputy Commander </p>
<p>post.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deteriorating security in Iraq had impeded the ISG’s effectiveness. The UK </p>
<p>continued to fulfil its duty of care to staff and would monitor closely the post-</p>
<p>transfer of sovereignty security situation.</p>

<p>436</p>
<p><b>784. </b> Mr Dowse covered much the same ground as Mr Howard. He wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISG planning since March had been hampered significantly by poor security </p>
<p>throughout Iraq, high staff turnover, difficulty in filling posts and some equipment </p>
<p>shortages.</p>

<p>networks to develop and use chemical weapons against Coalition forces”. </p>

<p>The ISG believed insurgent groups were “looking to draw on the knowledge and </p>
<p>experience of people previously engaged with Iraq’s CW programme”, although </p>
<p>the scale of that effort was “unclear”. The use of mustard and sarin artillery </p>
<p>shells in two recent improvised explosive devices was “not a reliable indicator”. </p>
<p>Those using the weapons were “probably unaware of their nature”. The rounds </p>
<p>were in “a very poor condition and almost certainly part of Iraq’s pre-1991 </p>
<p>stockpile”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Two consistent themes were emerging from the debriefing of HVDs:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“CW was used in the Iran-Iraq war, but remaining stocks had been </p>
<p>destroyed in 1991, without records”; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>after 1991 Saddam Hussein was “determined to maintain scientific </p>
<p>expertise for post-sanctions reconstruction of WMD programmes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had stated that the ISG mission would not change after 30 June, the </p>
<p>end of the CPA, but Maj Gen Dayton would be replaced by a one-star US Marine </p>
<p>Corps officer.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The next report would be the ISG’s last. Mr Duelfer’s aim was to have a draft </p>
<p>ready by the end of June, to be worked on during July and released in August.  </p>
<p>It was likely to focus on:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>“Iraqi contravention of sanctions in the procurement of goods that could be </p>
<p>used to support WMD programmes”;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>diversion of OFF funds; and</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>a broader picture of the regime’s “strategic intent” towards WMD.</p>
<p><b>785. </b> In his note to No.10 officials on 23 May, Mr Blair wrote in relation to the ISG that it:</p>
<p>“… seems to be doing nothing. Surely it is absurd that they will say nothing is found, </p>
<p>though there was strategic intent; when, in reality, they have been unable to look. </p>
<p>They need to leave actual WMD an open issue. Also can I have an assessment of </p>
<p>the conventional stockpiles in Iraq at the end of the war.”</p>
<p>437</p>
<p><b>786. </b> In response to the update from Mr Dowse, Mr Blair commented:</p>
<p>“… the ISG should not just conclude that there was strategic intent but no WMD </p>
<p>were found, when it is clear that they have been unable to look. They need to leave </p>
<p>WMD as an open issue.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>578</p>
<p><b>789. </b> Mr Duelfer called on Mr Scarlett and Mr Tony Pawson, Mr Howard’s successor </p>
<p>as DCDI, on 28 May.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> Mr Scarlett reported the main points from both discussions to </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISG work. Interviews with HVDs, including Saddam Hussein, remained a priority </p>
<p>but were yielding little specific information. The ISG was still trying to establish </p>
<p>whether there were specific Iraqi policies to maintain or develop industrial </p>
<p>capacity with an embedded or inherent WMD production capability. High priority </p>
<p>was being given to work on terrorists’ and insurgents’ capacity to obtain or </p>
<p>produce WMD for immediate use.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISG status. Mr Tenet had assured Mr Duelfer that the ISG’s status would not </p>
<p>change while Mr Duelfer remained in charge. For legal purposes, after 30 June </p>
<p>the ISG would have to fall under the remit of the Multi-National Force – Iraq </p>
<p>(MNF-I). Day-to-day operational command should remain with CENTCOM.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISG report. Mr Duelfer envisaged that a first draft would be ready by June but </p>
<p>a final text would “not be ready until August”. This would be a “comprehensive” </p>
<p>report, but not a “final” one. It would have much to say on regime intent and </p>
<p>would make clear many questions remained open. Mr Duelfer would not commit </p>
<p>to specific dates for publication or his departure from the ISG.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Management. Mr Duelfer was anxious to work with the UK. He was open to </p>
<p>comments and views on content and presentation, but was clear that the report </p>
<p>would be his own. Mr Pawson and Mr Dowse would stay in close touch with </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer and Washington.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Release of HVDs. There was concern that, with the release of most HVDs </p>
<p>before 30 June, some might go to the press to allege mistreatment and </p>
<p>press the case that WMD had never existed. There was a danger that could </p>
<p>undermine the authority of the ISG report.</p>
<p><b>790. </b> In his memoir, Mr Duelfer explained that support for the ISG was at its highest </p>
<p>during June 2004, in the weeks leading up to the transfer of sovereignty:</p>
<p>“ISG analysts developed new targeting packages … Planning for a final pulse of </p>
<p>raids was accelerated … All the agencies in Washington and the military in the field </p>
<p>understood the importance of getting to the bottom of the WMD question.”</p>
<p>441</p>
<p><b>791. </b> Maj Gen Dayton handed over command of the ISG to Brigadier General </p>
<p>Joseph McMenamin on 12 June.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p><b>792. </b> Before his departure, Maj Gen Dayton discussed the future of the ISG with </p>
<p>Mr Pawson. Mr Pawson reported to Mr Scarlett that, while some reconfiguring of the ISG </p>

<p><b>793. </b> On 6 June, the Security Council adopted resolution 1546 (2004) (see Section 9.2). </p>
<p>The resolution welcomed the beginning of a new phase in Iraq’s transition to a </p>
<p>democratically elected government, and looked forward to the end of the Occupation </p>
<p>by 30 June 2004.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p><b>794. </b> In operative paragraph (OP) 21, the Security Council decided that the prohibition </p>
<p>on the sale and supply of arms to Iraq would “not apply to arms or related material </p>
<p>required by the Government of Iraq or the multinational force to serve the purposes of </p>
<p>this resolution”.</p>
<p><b>795. </b> In OP22, the Council noted that OP21 did not affect material prohibited by or </p>
<p>the obligations in paragraphs 8 and 12 of resolution 687 (1991) and paragraph 3(f) </p>
<p>of resolution 707 (1991). It also reaffirmed “its intention to revisit the mandates” of </p>
<p>UNMOVIC and the IAEA.</p>
<p><b>796. </b> A letter from Secretary Powell to the President of the Security Council was </p>
<p>annexed to the resolution. Secretary Powell confirmed that:</p>

<p><b>801. </b> At the end of June, the ISG comprised 1,787 personnel: 1,722 from the US, </p>
<p>54 from the UK and 11 from Australia.</p>
<p>449</p>
<p><b>802. </b> On 1 July, Mr Straw was advised that the only grounds for internment after 30 June </p>
<p>should be “imperative reasons of security or criminal activity”.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p> FCO legal advice made </p>
<p>clear that internment for intelligence exploitation alone was not sufficient. The British </p>
<p>Embassy Washington had already been instructed to raise with the US UK concerns </p>
<p>about the basis for continued US internments that did not fall into the two categories </p>
<p>recognised by the UK.</p>
<p><b>803. </b> The FCO stated that restrictions on the activities of UK personnel in the ISG were </p>
<p>unlikely to affect its overall operational capability, but were likely to be unwelcome to the </p>
<p>US military at a time when US and UK resources were under considerable pressure. </p>
<p>There was a risk that, during a critical time for the preparation of the next ISG report, the </p>
<p>UK might be fully involved only in the ISG’s assessment work and missions compatible </p>
<p>with UK policy.</p>
<p><b>804. </b> The FCO also reported that Dr Ayad Allawi, the Iraqi Prime Minister, had expressed </p>
<p>strong support for the ISG which he hoped would remain active for the next six months </p>
<p>or so. There had not, however, been detailed discussions between the ISG and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Interim Government (IIG) about how the ISG would operate. Prime Minister Allawi was </p>
<p>reported to be “convinced that WMD will be found”.</p>
<p><b>805. </b> Mr Ehrman advised Mr Straw’s Private Office:</p>
<p>“We pressed the US to address the future of ISG operations when SCR 1546 was </p>

<p><b>The Butler and Senate Intelligence Committee Reports, </b></p>
<p><b>July 2004</b></p>
<p><b>807.  In a Note for President Bush on 16 June, Mr Blair stated that the truth on </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s WMD was probably that Saddam Hussein:</b></p>
<p><b>“ … was developing long range ballistic missile capability in breach of UN </b></p>
<p><b>resolutions; he probably had no or no large stockpiles of tactical CW or </b></p>
<p><b>BW weapons; but he retained the capability and expertise to recommence </b></p>
<p><b>production as soon as he could, again in breach of UN resolutions.”</b></p>
<p><b>808.  Mr Blair’s “hunch” was that the Butler Review would reach similar </b></p>
<p><b>conclusions. Both Lord Butler and the Senate Intelligence Committee were </b></p>
<p><b>“bound to be critical … in certain respects”.</b></p>
<p><b>809. </b> On 16 June, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Dr Rice a Note written by Mr Blair for </p>

<p><b>810. </b> In relation to the need “to deal with any WMD/intelligence issues”, Mr Blair wrote </p>
<p>that he remained “deeply concerned” about WMD:</p>
<p>“The public need an explanation and there will linger a real trust/truth issue …</p>
<p>“At present the public debate lurches between the two extremes: pro-war people </p>
<p>insist the intelligence was right, but the plain fact is no WMD has been found; anti-</p>
<p>war people claim it was all a fraud, as if Saddam never really had any WMD, which </p>
<p>is plainly fatuous … [T]he ISG thinking, and probably the truth, is somewhere in </p>
<p>between. He was developing long range ballistic missile capability in breach of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>582</p>
<p>So he had strategic intent and capability on WMD; and an active programme on </p>
<p>ballistic missiles.</p>
<p>“Such an explanation would mean that some of the intelligence upon which we acted </p>
<p>was wrong; but that nonetheless the threat was there, as was the breach of UN </p>
<p>resolutions. It would also explain why the picture was so confused and why, whilst </p>
<p>the exact basis of action was not as we thought, the action was still justified.”</p>
<p><b>811. </b> Mr Blair’s “hunch” was that the Butler Review would reach similar conclusions. </p>
<p>Both Lord Butler and the Senate Intelligence Committee were “bound to be critical … </p>
<p>in certain respects”. But the US and UK had “to avoid the absurd notion that therefore </p>
<p>there was no threat at all, as if 12 years of history and UN resolutions never existed”.</p>
<p><b>812. </b> Mr Blair suggested that, if Mr Duelfer were thinking along those lines, it made </p>
<p>sense urgently to investigate the possibility of publishing the ISG report at the same </p>
<p>time as the Senate and Butler Reports. That would “provide the clear evidential basis for </p>
<p>saying there was indeed a threat, even if it was not the threat that had been anticipated”.</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“It may be impossible but if at all possible we should have this issue dealt with and </p>
<p>lanced all at the same time.”</p>
<p><b>814. </b> During a video conference with President Bush on 22 June, Mr Blair said that </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer seemed to be planning to publish in August. That was up to him, but with </p>
<p>other WMD reports due to be published earlier, it might make sense to bring the </p>
<p>date forward.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>815. </b> Reporting on a meeting in London on 2 July, Mr Landsman wrote that Mr Duelfer </p>
<p>had been insistent that there was still plenty for ISG to do and that he had “repeatedly </p>
<p>mentioned CW/terrorism”.</p>
<p>455</p>
<p><b>816. </b> Mr Duelfer was reported to have said:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The timing for his next report “could slip a little”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “potentially a good story to tell on the Saddam regime strategic </p>
<p>intent”, but he was “unhappy about the quality of the drafting produced in </p>
<p>the ISG”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He “wanted to use his report to challenge assumptions”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime was “highly arbitrary and personalised: we should not </p>
<p>expect to find carefully set out plans and consultation exercises”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He “hoped to be able to point to a ‘sharp breakout capability’”.</p>

<p>He was “surprised” by Prime Minister Allawi’s optimism that “WMD were there </p>
<p>to be found”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UNMOVIC’s “excellent information base was ‘about an Iraq which no longer </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“[W]e should begin to consider to what extent responsibility could eventually go </p>
<p>to the Iraqis themselves”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A possible cache in Syria was “not out of the question”, but “Syria was ‘well </p>
<p>covered’ and something should have come to light by now”.</p>
<p><b>817. </b> Mr Blair discussed Iraq with President Bush again during a video conference </p>
<p>on 6 July.</p>
<p><b>818. </b> The briefing for Mr Blair advised that President Bush might raise the Butler </p>
<p>and Senate Intelligence Committee Reports, but that there was “no point in pushing </p>
<p>again on the ISG – Duelfer will not report before August and further pressure will not </p>
<p>change this”.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p><b>819. </b> The record of the video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush on </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s evidence to the Liaison Committee, 6 July 2004</b></p>
<p><b>820. </b> During his appearance before the Liaison Committee on 6 July, Mr Blair was asked </p>
<p>about the implications of the failure to find WMD.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p><b>821. </b> In his responses, Mr Blair made a number of points, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He had “to accept that we have not found them [stockpiles of WMD] and that </p>
<p>we may not find them. What I would say very strongly, however, is that to go to </p>
<p>the opposite extreme and say, therefore, that no threat existed from Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein would be a mistake. We do not know what has happened to them; they </p>
<p>could have been removed, they could have been hidden, they could have been </p>
<p>destroyed.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG had already indicated “quite clearly that there have been breaches” of </p>
<p>UN resolutions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The purpose of military action “was in order to enforce” the UN resolutions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “absolutely clear from the evidence that has already been found … that </p>
<p>he [Saddam] had the strategic capability, the intent and that he was in multiple </p>
<p>breaches”.</p>

<p>He genuinely believed “that those stockpiles of weapons were there; I think </p>
<p>that most people did, and that is why the whole of the international community </p>
<p>came together and passed the United Nations resolution it did [1441 adopted in </p>
<p>November 2002], but that is a very different thing from saying that Saddam was </p>
<p>not a threat; the truth is he was a threat, to the region and to the wider world, </p>
<p>and the world is a safer place without him.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He “would not accept” that Saddam Hussein “was not a threat and a threat in </p>
<p>WMD terms”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He did “not believe we would have got the progress on Libya, on AQ Khan, on </p>
<p>Iran and on North Korea” without Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In his view, “the reason … it was important that we took a stand on the WMD </p>
<p>issue, and the place … to take that stand was Iraq because of the history of </p>
<p>breaches of UN resolutions and the fact that they used WMD … is that if you </p>
<p>carry on with this proliferation of WMD with these highly repressive states </p>
<p>developing it … at some point you would have this new form of global terrorism </p>
<p>and those states with WMD coming together.”</p>

<p>The intelligence community did not accurately or adequately explain to policy-</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The intelligence community suffered from a collective presumption that Iraq </p>
<p>had an active and growing WMD programme. This “group think” led intelligence </p>
<p>community analysts, collectors and managers both to interpret ambiguous </p>
<p>evidence as conclusively indicative of a WMD programme and to ignore or </p>
<p>minimise evidence that Iraq did not have active and expanding weapons of </p>

<p>On 13 July, at the request of the Cabinet Office, the CIG produced an Assessment </p>
<p>reviewing the links between Al Qaida and Saddam Hussein’s regime.</p>
<p>461</p>
<p>The Key Judgements were:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Nothing we have learnt since the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime has invalidated </p>
<p>previous JIC judgements on the possible links between the regime and Al Qaida.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were some contacts between the regime and Al Qaida during the 1990s, </p>
<p>but they did not progress beyond the exploratory stage and the degree of practical </p>
<p>co-operation, if any, was limited.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Some sources … asserted that Al Qaida was seeking chemical and biological (CB) </p>
<p>expertise. But the intelligence is not strong. Al Qaida did not receive CB material </p>
<p>from Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime was not involved with the 9/11 attacks.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Al Qaida associates such as [Abu Musab] al-Zarqawi and members of Ansar al-Islam </p>
<p>were known by the regime to be operating in Iraq and the Kurdish Autonomous Zone </p>
<p>(KAZ) before Coalition action in 2003, but the exact relationship between the regime </p>
<p>and Al Qaida-linked terrorists remains unclear.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Al-Zarqawi made Iraq his base for jihad on his own initiative, but with plans in line </p>
<p>with the Al Qaida global jihadist agenda.”</p>
<p>The additional points in the Assessment included:</p>
<p><b>Pre 9/11</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After its defeat in 1991, the Iraqi regime “sought to make contact with a number of </p>
<p>Islamist groups”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Senior Al Qaida detainees have revealed that Bin Laden was personally against any </p>
<p>formal alliance with the Iraqi regime, but that others … believed some contact would </p>
<p>be useful.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The exact nature of early contacts remained “unclear”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Intelligence indicated that “further contacts took place in the late 1990s”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was doubt about the reliability of some of the reporting, but “sufficient </p>
<p>intelligence to assess there was some contact throughout the 1990s”.</p>
<p><b>Post 9/11</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After the fall of the Taliban in Afghanistan, “reports suggested that Iraq was being </p>
<p>used as a transit route for Islamist terrorists”, and: “By 2002 Al Qaida-linked terrorists </p>
<p>had established a presence … some involved in the development of CB substances </p>
<p>at a facility near Halabjah, run by Ansar al-Islam.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “likely that the regime knew these Islamist terrorists were operating in Iraq, </p>
<p>though it would not have been able to act against them in the KAZ”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Post war intelligence” suggested that “in Baghdad and elsewhere some effort … was </p>
<p>made to arrest Al Qaida-linked terrorists”.</p>
<p><b>The Butler Report, 14 July 2004</b></p>

<p>462</p>
<p> Sir David Omand stated that it “would be the first time that such an extensive </p>
<p>list of JIC reports had been made public”. It was “in the JIC’s interests that the Report </p>
<p>showed that the right kind of warnings” had been given, and that “there was a depth </p>
<p>to the intelligence and assessment on Iraq”. There were, however, “serious security </p>
<p>implications” and the danger of setting precedents. Redactions to the extracts from </p>
<p>JIC Assessments would need to be agreed before publication.</p>
<p><b>825. </b> The Butler Report was published on 14 July.</p>
<p>463</p>
<p><b>826. </b> In the House of Commons, Mr Blair assessed the Report’s implications for two </p>
<p>questions that had persisted throughout the debate on Iraq:</p>
<p>“One is an issue of good faith – of integrity. This is now the fourth exhaustive </p>
<p>inquiry that has dealt with the issue. This Report, the Hutton Inquiry, the Report of </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>587</p>
<p>the Intelligence and Security Committee before it, and that of the Foreign Affairs </p>
<p>Committee before that, found the same thing. No one lied. No one made up the </p>
<p>intelligence. No one inserted things into the dossier against the advice of the </p>
<p>intelligence services. Everyone genuinely tried to do their best in good faith for </p>
<p>the country in circumstances of acute difficulty. That issue of good faith should </p>
<p>now be at an end.</p>
<p>“But there is another issue. We expected – I expected – to find actual usable </p>
<p>chemical or biological weapons shortly after we entered Iraq …</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lord Butler, in his </p>
<p>Report, says: ‘We believe that it would be a rash person who asserted at this stage </p>
<p>that evidence of Iraqi possession of stocks of biological or chemical agents, or even </p>
<p>of banned missiles, does not exist or will never be found.’ However, I have to accept </p>
<p>that, as the months have passed, it has seemed increasingly clear that, at the time </p>
<p>of invasion, Saddam did not have stockpiles of chemical or biological weapons ready </p>
<p>to deploy. The second issue is therefore this: even if we acted in perfectly good faith, </p>
<p>is it now the case that in the absence of stockpiles of weapons ready to deploy, the </p>
<p>threat was misconceived and therefore the war was unjustified?</p>
<p>“I have searched my conscience … to answer that question. My answer would </p>
<p>be this: the evidence of Saddam’s weapons of mass destruction was indeed less </p>
<p>certain and less well founded than was stated at the time … However … he retained </p>
<p>complete strategic intent on WMD and significant capability … He had no intention </p>
<p>of ever co-operating fully with the inspectors, and he was going to start up again </p>
<p>the moment the troops and the inspectors departed, or the sanctions eroded. I say </p>
<p>further that if we had backed down in respect of Saddam, we would never have </p>
<p>taken the stand that we needed to take on weapons of mass destruction, we would </p>
<p>never have got the progress on Libya, for example, that we achieved, and we would </p>
<p>have left Saddam in charge of Iraq, with every malign intent and capability still </p>
<p>in place, and with every dictator with the same intent everywhere immeasurably </p>
<p>emboldened.”</p>
<p>464</p>
<p><b>827. </b> Mr Blair commented on the Butler Report’s statement that:</p>
<p>“… with hindsight making public that the authorship of the dossier was by the JIC </p>
<p>was a mistake. It meant that more weight was put on the intelligence than it could </p>
<p>bear, and put the JIC and its chairman in a difficult position. It recommends in </p>
<p>future a clear delimitation between Government and the JIC, perhaps by issuing </p>
<p>two documents. I think this is wise, although I doubt that it would have made </p>
<p>much difference to the reception of the intelligence at the time. The Report also </p>
<p>enlarges on the criticisms of the ISC in respect of the greater use of caveats about </p>
<p>intelligence both in the dossier and in my foreword, and we accept that entirely.</p>

<p>“The Report also states that significant parts of the intelligence have now been  </p>
<p>found by the Secret Intelligence Service to be in doubt. The Chief of the SIS, </p>
<p>Sir Richard Dearlove, has told me that it accepts all the conclusions and </p>
<p>recommendations of Lord Butler’s Report that concern the Service. The SIS will  </p>
<p>fully address the recommendations that Lord Butler has made about its procedures </p>
<p>and about the need for the Service properly to resource them. The Service  </p>
<p>has played and continues to play, a vital role in countering worldwide the tide  </p>
<p>of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Indeed, its successes are evident in </p>
<p>Lord Butler’s Report.</p>
<p>“I accept the Report’s conclusions in full. Any mistakes should not be laid at the </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Findings on the serious doubts about other lines of reporting and the eventual </p>

<p><b>832. </b> Mr Blair raised the ISG report during a video conference with President Bush on </p>
<p>22 July.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> He said that Mr Duelfer needed to prove that Saddam Hussein had been </p>
<p>“procuring the means to develop WMD, had missiles to deliver it, and the intent to </p>
<p>use it”. The ISG report could prove to be a powerful argument in support of the war.</p>
<p><b>833. </b> Mr Blair suggested that, with the ISG report and the Butler Review, which had </p>
<p>made clear that Al Qaida had been present in Iraq, “we could clearly argue that it would </p>
<p>have been wrong to let Saddam go unchecked”. The timing of the ISG report had to be </p>
<p>right. Sir Nigel Sheinwald noted that early September looked realistic.</p>
<p><b>834. </b> Mr Dowse discussed the ISG report with Mr Duelfer at a meeting hosted by the </p>
<p>US Embassy in London on 31 August.</p>
<p>467</p>
<p> Mr Duelfer stated that he did not expect the </p>
<p>report to satisfy those wanting evidence of WMD, but thought it would disappoint those </p>
<p>who said that sanctions and containment had been working. There would be plenty of </p>
<p>very clear evidence that Iraqi abuse of OFF had allowed the regime to siphon off “huge </p>
<p>amounts” of money.</p>
<p><b>835. </b> Mr Dowse reported that it was Mr Duelfer’s “firm intention” to deliver the report to </p>
<p>Mr McLaughlin by the end of September in a form suitable for immediate publication. </p>
<p>A draft should be ready for review by governments in Washington, London and </p>
<p>Canberra in about two weeks.</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Mr Blair commented that Mr Duelfer needed:</p>
<p>“… a conclusion on WMD weapons themselves. How clear is it that they didn’t exist; </p>
<p>is it an open question; how has the security situation post May 03 &amp; now affected the </p>
<p>search? He will need answers to this.”</p>
<p>468</p>
<p><b>837. </b> Mr Dowse responded on 10 September. The UK had not seen the latest text, but </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer was expected to say that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ISG had “not been able to determine conclusively whether Saddam </p>
<p>possessed WMD in 2003”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the likelihood was that “even if some did exist, they were not of military </p>
<p>significance”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>590</p>
<p><b>839. </b> The JIC Sub-Committee on Iraq/WMD, chaired by Mr Ehrman, who took up his </p>
<p>appointment as Chairman of the JIC at the end of August, discussed Mr Duelfer’s draft </p>
<p>Comprehensive Report on 17 September.</p>
<p>470</p>
<p><b>840. </b> The meeting was also informed that Washington planned to reduce the size of the </p>
<p>ISG in Baghdad, culminating in its merger with MNF-I. During the drawdown period it </p>
<p>could follow up a number of lines “including reporting on the chemical laboratory network </p>
<p>and links with Syria”.</p>
<p><b>841. </b> Mr Ehrman reported to Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the DIS had received five of the </p>
<p>six chapters of the draft Comprehensive Report, which would be considered for factual </p>
<p>accuracy and intelligence source protection.</p>
<p>471</p>
<p> Mr Duelfer had made it clear he would </p>
<p>not accept any attempt to alter the judgements in the Report. Mr Ehrman stated that no </p>
<p>such attempts were being made.</p>
<p><b>842. </b> Mr Ehrman explained that the JIC was:</p>
<p>“… preparing a table showing key conclusions set against what the dossier and </p>
<p>JIC assessments said before the war … [T]he headline points can be summarised </p>
<p>as follows:</p>
<p>a) Strategic intent</p>
<p>Duelfer concludes that Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq’s WMD capability after </p>
<p>sanctions were removed. Though there was no formal written strategy or plan for </p>
<p>this, the ISG say they have clear evidence of his intent to do it. Saddam aspired to </p>
<p>develop a nuclear capability but intended to focus on ballistic missile and tactical </p>
<p>CW capabilities.</p>
<p>Iraq never intended to meet the spirit of the UNSC’s resolutions … By mid-2000 </p>
<p>elements within Saddam’s regime boasted that the UN sanctions regime was slowly </p>
<p>eroding.</p>
<p>b) WMD capabilities</p>
<p>Duelfer judges that Iraq’s WMD capability was mostly destroyed in 1991 …</p>
<p>Saddam’s perceived requirement to bluff about WMD … made it too dangerous to </p>
<p>reveal this to the international community …</p>
<p>Duelfer says that the ISG has not judged conclusively whether or not Saddam </p>
<p>possessed WMD in 2003 …</p>

<p>591</p>
<p>c) CW</p>
<p>… There are no indications that Baghdad resumed production of chemical munitions </p>
<p>[after 1991] …</p>
<p>… the Iraqi Intelligence Service maintained from 1991 to 2003 a set of undeclared </p>
<p>covert laboratories to research and test various chemicals and poisons, primarily for </p>
<p>intelligence operations …</p>
<p>The ISG judges that Iraq had a capability to produce large quantities of sulphur </p>
<p>mustard agent within three to six months.</p>
<p>d) Nuclear</p>
<p>Saddam ended the nuclear programme in 1991. The ISG found no evidence to </p>
<p>suggest concerted efforts to restart the programme …</p>
<p>The ISG has uncovered no information to support allegations of Iraqi pursuit of </p>
<p>uranium from abroad in the post-Operation Desert Storm era …</p>
<p>e) Delivery systems</p>
<p>The ISG has uncovered no evidence that Iraq retained SCUD-variant missiles  </p>
<p>(ie Al Husseins) …</p>
<p>… The ISG assesses that Saddam clearly intended to reconstitute long range </p>
<p>delivery systems and that the systems were potentially for WMD.</p>
<p>The ISG has substantial documentary evidence and source reporting indicating that </p>
<p>the regime intentionally violated various international resolutions and agreements in </p>
<p>order to pursue its delivery systems programmes.”</p>
<p><b>843. </b> Mr Ehrman recommended that the Government’s public lines on the </p>
<p>Comprehensive Report should focus on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Report’s confirmation of Saddam Hussein’s breaches of resolution 1441;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent to reconstitute his WMD when sanctions were </p>
<p>lifted; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the conclusion that sanctions and therefore containment were becoming </p>
<p>progressively less effective.</p>
<p><b>844. </b> Mr Ehrman advised that many of the ISG’s points had already been covered in </p>
<p>the Butler Report, but the ISG’s “central judgement, that Iraq’s WMD capability was </p>
<p>essentially destroyed in 1991 and not reconstituted by March 2003”, was “firmer than the </p>
<p>judgement Lord Butler had reached”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>592</p>
<p><b>845. </b> On 21 September, Mr Ehrman informed Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the UK had </p>
<p>received the final, BW, chapter of the draft Comprehensive Report.</p>
<p>472</p>
<p> He explained </p>
<p>that the JIC had also been able to look at the detail of the section on illicit finance and </p>
<p>procurement.</p>
<p><b>846. </b> Mr Ehrman wrote that, on BW:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG judged that Iraq appeared “to have destroyed its undeclared stocks of </p>
<p>BW agent”, but it lacked “evidence to document complete destruction”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq retained some BW-related seedstocks until their discovery after Operation </p>
<p>Iraqi Freedom.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After Operation Desert Storm, in 1991, Iraq “sought to save what it could of </p>
<p>its BW infrastructure and covertly to continue BW research, as well as to hide </p>
<p>evidence of that and earlier efforts”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG judged that Iraq “abandoned its existing BW programme, destroying the </p>
<p>facility at al Hakam” when the Iraq economy was “at rock bottom in 1995”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG had “found no direct evidence that Iraq, after 1996, had plans for a new </p>
<p>BW programme or was conducting BW-specific work for military purposes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG judged that BW applicable research since 1996 “was not conducted in </p>
<p>connection with the development of a BW programme”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The Iraqi intelligence service had a series of laboratories that conducted </p>
<p>biological work including research into BW agents for assassination purposes </p>
<p>until the mid-1990s.” Experiments had been conducted on human beings, </p>
<p>who died, but there was “no evidence to link these tests with the development </p>
<p>of BW”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“In spite of exhaustive investigation”, the ISG had “found no evidence that Iraq </p>
<p>possessed or was developing, BW agent production systems mounted on road </p>
<p>vehicles or railway wagons”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG judged that “the two trailers captured in 2003” were “almost certainly </p>
<p>designed and built exclusively for the generation of hydrogen”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The ISG judged that “Iraq could have re-established an elementary BW </p>
<p>programme within a few weeks to a few months of a decision to do so, but it has </p>
<p>discovered no indications that the regime was pursuing such a course”.</p>
<p><b>847. </b> On illicit finance and procurement, Mr Ehrman reported that the findings included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Private companies from Jordan, India, France, Italy, Romania and Turkey </p>
<p>appeared to have engaged in possible WMD-related trade with Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Governments of Russia, Syria, Belarus, North Korea, the Federal Republic </p>
<p>of Yugoslavia and Yemen directly supported or endorsed private companies’ </p>

<p><b>Mr Blair’s speech to the Labour Party conference, </b></p>
<p><b>28 September 2004</b></p>
<p>In his speech to the Labour Party conference on 28 September, Mr Blair raised the issue </p>
<p>of trust and the decisions he had made on future security in the preceding three years.</p>
<p>473</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that he wanted to deal with the issue of Iraq “head on”. He stated:</p>
<p>“The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, as </p>
<p>opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong.</p>
<p>“I acknowledge that and accept it.</p>
<p>“I simply point out, such evidence was agreed by the whole international community, </p>
<p>not least because Saddam had used such weapons against his own people and </p>
<p>neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>“And the problem is, I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, </p>
<p>but I can’t, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam.</p>
<p>“The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power.”</p>
<p>Mr Blair challenged the “belief that the basic judgement I have made since September </p>
<p>11th [2001], including on Iraq, is wrong, that by our actions we have made matters worse </p>
<p>not better”. He acknowledged that the issue had “divided the country”, but set out his view </p>
<p>of the need to deal with the threat from the “wholly new phenomenon of worldwide global </p>
<p>terrorism”, including in Iraq, and the importance of the alliance with the US.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>594</p>
<p><b>848. </b> On 28 September, Mr Ehrman sent Sir Nigel Sheinwald draft “lines to take” on the </p>
<p>ISG Comprehensive Report, excluding the section on illicit finance and procurement, </p>
<p>which Mr Duelfer was reported to be rewriting.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>849. </b> Mr Ehrman proposed that the focus should be on the three themes he had </p>
<p>identified in earlier minutes:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam’s strategic intent to reconstitute his WMD when sanctions were lifted;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>his repeated breaches of Security Council resolutions, including 1441;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the ISG conclusions on the progressive erosion of sanctions.”</p>
<p><b>850. </b> Mr Ehrman added:</p>
<p>“The lines to take also seek to deal with the main point which many will make (put </p>
<p>crudely ‘no WMD’) – mainly by reference to Lord Butler’s conclusions. We will be </p>
<p>asked: ‘Do you endorse/accept the ISG Report?’ I recommend that we stick to the </p>
<p>reference back to Butler, whose conclusions were very close to the ISG’s, and to the </p>
<p>fact that the Government accepted these. We cannot go further because we do not </p>
<p>accept Duelfer’s conclusion on uranium and Niger, which is the opposite of Butler’s. </p>
<p>Nor has Duelfer in most cases made clear the full reasoning behind his conclusions.”</p>
<p><b>851. </b> Mr Ehrman sent a further update on 1 October, explaining that the chapter on </p>
<p>procurement was still being worked on.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p><b>852. </b> Mr Anthony Phillipson, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, sent </p>
<p>Mr Blair a minute on developments later the same day.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> Formal publication of the ISG </p>
<p>Comprehensive Report would be at 1500 UK time on 6 October. The US Government </p>
<p>would brief the US press at 1900 UK time on 5 October. The FCO was leading on UK </p>
<p>press handling and intended to take “a low-key, defensive, approach”. It was not a UK </p>
<p>report and there would be no UK pre-briefing. Mr Straw would issue a Written Statement.</p>
<p><b>853. </b> Mr Phillipson wrote that Mr Blair would:</p>
<p>“… want to discuss this on Monday [4 October], particularly if you want to take a </p>
<p>more proactive approach to get across the positive aspects of the Report regarding </p>
<p>Saddam’s strategic intent to develop WMD.”</p>
<p><b>854. </b> Mr Phillipson added that the US had decided that there would be two printed </p>
<p>versions of the Comprehensive Report, not one:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “not for publication” version for Congress and the US Government; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>595</p>
<p><b>855. </b> Mr Phillipson wrote that the US Government had rejected Mr Duelfer’s argument </p>
<p>that it should be sufficient to issue a disclaimer stating that naming companies in the </p>
<p>Report was not an indication of guilt or complicity; a published official CIA report could </p>
<p>not mention named US individuals or entities. The UK had pressed for the exclusion of </p>
<p>all such references, but the US position was that the legal restriction did not apply to </p>
<p>non-US entities. Presentationally, that approach was better than removing only US and </p>
<p>UK names; it emphasised that it was not the UK’s report.</p>
<p><b>856. </b> The other issue still to be addressed was the withdrawal of intelligence used </p>
<p>before the invasion to support assessments about Iraqi WMD programmes. No.10 was </p>

<p><b>857. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Dr Rice discussed the ISG Comprehensive Report on </p>
<p>4 October.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> Sir Nigel said that there had been good co-ordination between the US and </p>
<p>UK. He set out Mr Blair’s view on handling: the failure to find WMD stockpiles it should </p>
<p>be presented as “yesterday’s story” and the media should be encouraged to focus on the </p>
<p>new material about strategic intent, concealment and sanctions busting.</p>
<p><b>858. </b> Mr Blair raised the ISG Comprehensive Report with President Bush during a video </p>
<p>conference on 5 October.</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>859. </b> Mr Blair’s brief for the conversation suggested that he tell President Bush that </p>
<p>the UK was focusing on the positive aspects of the ISG Report rather than the lack </p>
<p>of WMD.</p>
<p>479</p>
<p><b>860. </b> During his wider discussion with President Bush on Iraq on 5 October (see </p>
<p>Section 9.3), Mr Blair stated that the ISG Report “showed that Saddam had a clear </p>
<p>strategic intent to develop WMD” and that “terrorists had now chosen to make  </p>
<p>Iraq the battleground”.</p>
<p>480</p>
<p> It would be naive to say that Iraq had been stable and  </p>
<p>non-threatening before March 2003 and would still be so if no action had been taken. </p>
<p>Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“We needed to focus on the fact that sanctions had not been working, Saddam had </p>
<p>strategic intent to rebuild his capability, and even if he had no deployable weapons, </p>
<p>the enforcement regime wasn’t working and Saddam was gearing up for when it was </p>
<p>removed. We had to focus on the whole story.”</p>

<p><b>862. </b> In the ‘Scope Note’ introducing <i>The Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor </i></p>
<p><i>to the DCI on Iraq’s WMD</i> (the ISG Comprehensive Report), Mr Duelfer stated that </p>
<p>the Report covered the ISG’s findings between June 2003 and September 2004.</p>
<p>481</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Since there remained “the possibility (though small) of remaining WMD”, reports of </p>
<p>WMD-related material in the future would continue to be investigated.</p>
<p><b>863. </b> The Comprehensive Report was divided into six sections, each opening with a </p>
<p>summary of key findings.</p>
<p>482</p>
<p> Those included:</p>
<p>Regime Strategic Intent:</p>
<p>•<i><b> </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>“Saddam Hussein so dominated the Iraqi regime that its strategic intent </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>was his alone. He wanted to end sanctions while preserving the capability </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when sanctions </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>were lifted.”</b></i></p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“<i>Saddam wanted to recreate Iraq’s WMD capability – which was essentially </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>destroyed in 1991 – after sanctions were removed and Iraq’s economy </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>stabilized, but probably with a different mix of capabilities to that which </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>previously existed. Saddam aspired to develop a nuclear capability – in </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>resulting economic risks – but he intended to focus on ballistic missile </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>and tactical chemical warfare (CW) capabilities</b></i>.<b>”</b></p>
<p>Regime Finance and Procurement:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam directed the regime’s key ministries and governmental agencies to </p>
<p>devise and implement strategies, policies and techniques to discredit the UN </p>
<p>sanctions, harass UN personnel in Iraq, and discredit the US. At the same time, </p>
<p>according to reporting, he also wanted to obfuscate Iraq’s refusal to reveal </p>
<p>the nature of its WMD and WMD-related programs, their capabilities, and his </p>
<p>intentions.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq under Saddam successfully devised various methods to acquire and import </p>
<p>items prohibited under UN sanctions …”</p>
<p>Delivery Systems:</p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“Desert Storm and subsequent UN resolutions and inspections brought </b></p>
<p><b>many of Iraq’s delivery programs to a halt.”</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“While other WMD programs were strictly prohibited, the UN permitted Iraq to </p>
<p>develop and possess delivery systems provided their range did not exceed </p>
<p>150km. This freedom allowed Iraq to keep its scientists and technicians </p>

<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“<i>Procurements supporting delivery system programs expanded after the </b></i></p>

<p><b>significance of the pre-1991 Iraqi Nuclear program but found that Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>ability to reconstitute a nuclear weapons program progressively decayed </b></p>
<p><b>after that date.”</b></p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“In the wake of Desert Storm, Iraq took steps to conceal key elements of </b></p>
<p><b>its program and to preserve what it could of the professional capabilities </b></p>
<p><b>of its nuclear scientific community.”</b></p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“As with other WMD areas, Saddam’s ambitions in the nuclear area were </b></p>

<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“<i>ISG found no direct evidence that Iraq, after 1996, had plans for a new BW </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>program or was conducting BW-specific work for military purposes.</i>”</b></p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“<i>Nevertheless, after 1996 Iraq still had a significant dual-use capability </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>– some declared – readily useful for BW if the regime chose to use it to </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>pursue a BW program. Moreover, Iraq still possessed its most important </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>BW asset, the scientific know-how of its BW cadre.</i>”</b></p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“<i>Depending on its scale, Iraq could have re-established an elementary </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>BW program within a few weeks to a few months of a decision to do so, </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>but ISG discovered no indications that the regime was pursuing such a </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>course.</i>”</b></p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>“<i>The IIS</b></i> [Iraqi Intelligence Service] <i><b>had a series of laboratories that </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>conducted biological work including research into BW agents for </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>assassination purposes until the mid-1990s. ISG has not been able … to </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>determine whether any of the work was related to military development of </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>BW agent</b></i>.<b>”</b></p>
<p><b>864. </b> In his memoir, Mr Duelfer wrote:</p>
<p>“I [did not] want the Report to tell people what to think up front: There was no </p>
<p>executive summary with a predetermined conclusion. The story of Iraq, sanctions, </p>
<p>and WMD was too intricate for that: It deserved to be seen in its entirety, without </p>
<p>single aspects being taken out of context.”</p>

<p><b>The Government’s response to the ISG Comprehensive Report</b></p>
<p><b>865.  In the House of Commons on 12 October, Mr Straw described the ISG </b></p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Report as providing “chapter and verse as to why the policy of </b></p>
<p><b>containment was not working”.</b></p>
<p><b>866.  The following day, Mr Blair told the Commons:</b></p>
<p><b>“Those people who want to pray in aid the Iraq Survey Group in respect </b></p>
<p><b>of stockpiles of weapons must also accept the other part of what the </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq Survey Group said, which is that Saddam retained the intent and the </b></p>
<p><b>capability … and was in breach of United Nations resolutions. That is what </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Duelfer expressly said.”</b></p>
<p><b>867. </b> In the House of Commons on 12 October, Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“The [ISG] Report concludes that by the mid-1990s, Iraq was essentially free </p>
<p>of weapons of mass destruction, but it goes on to describe a sophisticated and </p>
<p>systematic campaign by Saddam Hussein to bring down the United Nations </p>
<p>sanctions regime and to reconstitute his weapons programme.</p>

<p>484</p>
<p><b>868. </b> At PMQs on 13 October, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“We know from the Iraq Survey Group that he [Saddam Hussein] indeed had the </p>
<p>intent and capability and retained the scientists and desire, but that he might not </p>
<p>have had stockpiles of actually deployable weapons. We have accepted that  </p>
<p>and I have already apologised for any information that subsequently turned  </p>
<p>out to be wrong.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Those people who want to pray in aid the Iraq Survey Group in respect of stockpiles </p>
<p>of weapons must also accept the other part of what the Iraq Survey Group </p>
<p>said, which is that Saddam retained the intent and the capability – the teams of </p>

<p>that was and is the reason for going to war.”</p>

<p><b>869. </b> On 28 October, in response to a Written Parliamentary Question from  </p>
<p>Mr Llew Smith (Labour) asking for a list of the conclusions of the ISG Comprehensive </p>
<p>Report with which the Foreign Secretary did not agree, Mr Denis MacShane,  </p>
<p>Foreign Office Minister, set out three principal areas of disagreement:</p>
<p>“The Iraq Survey Group (ISG) Report concludes that there is no evidence to suggest </p>
<p>that Iraq sought to procure uranium from Africa in the 1990s. The Government </p>
<p>continues to believe that credible evidence exists to support the assertion made in </p>
<p>the September 2002 dossier. Lord Butler of Brockwell’s Review upheld that belief. </p>
<p>The UK was not in a position to share all the intelligence on this issue with the ISG.</p>
<p>“The ISG also expressed doubt that the aluminium tubes referred to in the </p>
<p>September dossier were evidence of a resumption of Iraq’s nuclear programmes. </p>
<p>Again, Lord Butler’s Review assessed this, and concluded that the Joint Intelligence </p>
<p>Committee were right to include reference to the tubes in the dossier and that </p>
<p>it properly reflected doubts about the use of the tubes in the caution of its </p>
<p>assessments. The Government fully accepts the findings of Lord Butler’s Review.</p>
<p>“The ISG also report that they found no evidence to support the claim in the dossier </p>
<p>that Iraq ‘is almost certainly seeking an indigenous ability to enrich uranium’ based </p>
<p>on gas centrifuge technology. They do, however, admit that elements of useful and </p>
<p>relevant technologies were being developed.”</p>

<p>600</p>
<p><b>Closure of the ISG and Addendums to the </b></p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Report</b></p>
<p><b>870. </b> Mr Duelfer visited London on 15 October on his way back to Iraq.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p> He told a </p>
<p>DIS official that he expected to remain in Baghdad until about Christmas to work on </p>
<p>the remaining unresolved issues, including cross-border movement into Syria.</p>
<p><b>871. </b> In his memoir, Mr Duelfer described the energy for ISG activities as “almost </p>
<p>completely extinguished”.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> Mr McLaughlin and the White House supported the idea </p>
<p>of the ISG collecting more information to “close out the remaining uncertain issues”, </p>
<p>including the reported movement of WMD to Syria before the invasion, but most ISG </p>
<p>staff were now focused on the insurgency.</p>
<p><b>872. </b> On 28 October, Op ROCKINGHAM reported that the ISG continued to investigate:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>remaining stocks of CBW agents;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>WMD infrastructure and associated individuals of concern; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Syrian connection.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p><b>873. </b> The ISG was also revisiting priority WMD-related sites to document and secure </p>
<p>equipment of proliferation concern.</p>
<p><b>874. </b> On 8 November, two US military protection officers were killed in a convoy taking </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer and his deputy to a meeting in Baghdad to discuss the Syrian connection.</p>
<p>490</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the incident, the US instructed that all ISG data-gathering missions should stop.</p>
<p><b>875. </b> Mr Duelfer left Baghdad on 16 December.</p>
<p>491</p>
<p><b>876.  In April 2005, the ISG published additional material as Addendums to the </b></p>
<p><b>Comprehensive Report.</b></p>
<p><b>877. </b> On 23 December 2004, Mr Ehrman informed Sir Nigel Sheinwald that Mr Duelfer </p>
<p>planned to publish a version of the Comprehensive Report with a number of new </p>
<p>annexes, in the second half of January.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> The UK had received four annexes for factual </p>
<p>checking. The key points in the annexes included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Residual proliferation risks from people and equipment/materials. Mr Duelfer had </p>
<p>concluded that the threat of proliferation of WMD skills beyond Iraq was “small”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The value of Iraqi detainees to the ISG investigation. If the US agreed to </p>
<p>publication, this could cause the most interest. The draft annex stated that </p>
<p>pre-conflict intelligence on people in the WMD programme was as inaccurate </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Residual pre-1991 stocks in Iraq. The ISG believed that any remaining chemical </p>
<p>munitions did not pose a militarily significant threat to Coalition Forces. Iraq </p>
<p>had “never successfully formulated” BW agents “for long term storage”. Any </p>
<p>remaining BW agents thus posed little or no risk to Coalition Forces or civilians.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s Military Industrial Commission. Reports that Qusay Hussein had asked </p>
<p>for a list of Iraqi BW experts to be compiled for him to pass to Syria and that an </p>
<p>Iraqi computer hacker claimed to be able to hack into US military satellites might </p>
<p>arouse some interest.</p>
<p><b>878. </b> A fifth annex containing an outline plan for future investigation of possible WMD </p>
<p>links with Syria was under consideration.</p>
<p><b>879. </b> Mr Ehrman did not expect publication of the annexes to attract major media </p>
<p>interest. He advised that the ISG would “effectively wind up” in January 2005, with </p>
<p>responsibility for WMD issues passing to the MNF in Baghdad.</p>
<p><b>880. </b> The ISG continued into 2005 as Mr Duelfer completed work, in Washington, on the </p>
<p>Addendums to the September 2004 Comprehensive Report.</p>
<p>493</p>
<p><b>881. </b> On 25 February 2005, Mr Ehrman reported to Sir Nigel Sheinwald that the text had </p>
<p>been sent to the printers and was expected to be published in early to mid-March.</p>
<p>494</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>He explained that the final version included an additional one-page annex on possible </p>
<p>pre-conflict movement of WMD out of Iraq. The ISG had been unable to rule out </p>
<p>unofficial movement of limited WMD materials, but judged it unlikely that an official </p>
<p>transfer had taken place.</p>

<p>He advised that the main points remained unchanged:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam had strategic intent to reconstitute Iraq’s WMD programmes when </p>
<p>sanctions were lifted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Iraq repeatedly breached Security Council Resolutions, including 1441”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[S]anctions were progressively eroding before the conflict”.</p>
<p><b>883. </b> Mr Ehrman advised:</p>
<p>“If asked about the Report’s conclusion that, by the mid-1990s Iraq was essentially </p>
<p>free of WMD, we will refer to the Prime Minister’s statement of 28 September 2004 </p>
<p>in Brighton that ‘evidence about Saddam having actual BW and CW weapons, as </p>
<p>opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong’.”</p>

<p>would retain WMD as a secondary role, after counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism.</p>
<p><b>885. </b> Shortly before the eventual publication of the final edition of the Comprehensive </p>

<p>to the US for “one last check” that they did not conflict with US lines.</p>

<p><b>886. </b> The main points included:</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>‘Residual Proliferation Risks: People’. There remained a danger that hostile </p>

<p>individuals was small, but they remained “an important concern”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>‘Residual Pre-1991 CBW Stocks in Iraq’. The ISG assessed that small numbers </p>

<p>“We conclude that the Intelligence Community was dead wrong in almost all of its </p>

<p>604</p>
<p><b>893. </b> The Assessment stated that, in southern Iraq, “Some 545 sarin nerve agent </p>
<p>warheads for 122mm rockets had been recovered.” The UK did not know the original </p>
<p>sources or the sites from which the weapons had been recovered. The Assessment </p>
<p>judged that they had been produced before 1991 and were probably from forward </p>
<p>ammunition supply points, not the principal CW storage depot at Al Muthanna or any </p>
<p>other large depot. The warheads did “<b>not constitute evidence of a concerted Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>plan to retain chemical weapons covertly post-1991 in a viable state for future </b></p>
<p><b>use</b>”. Their existence could be explained by a number of reasons, including careless </p>
<p>disposal, poor accounting or simple loss or abandonment. The Assessment also stated </p>
<p>that Iraqi sarin “had a relatively short shelf life”.</p>
<p><b>894. </b> The munitions recovered at Taji were “CW-capable” but no CW agents had been </p>
<p>identified.</p>
<p><b>895. </b> The Assessment stated that small numbers of munitions designed to carry agents </p>
<p>other than sarin had been recovered, “including 11 or 12 155mm mustard-based artillery </p>
<p>rounds”. None contained “more than residual traces of mustard”.</p>
<p><b>896. </b> The Assessment also stated:</p>
<p>“It is unlikely ever to be possible to reconcile the tens of thousands of 122mm </p>
<p>chemical weapons that the former regime declared it had manufactured, used and </p>
<p>destroyed with figures from UNSCOM or the findings of the Iraq Survey Group. </p>
<p><b>We judge that further recoveries of sarin-based chemical weapons are highly </b></p>

<p>605</p>
<p><b>Reporting to President Bush, the Commission stated that “the [US] Intelligence </b></p>
<p><b>Community was dead wrong in almost all of its pre-war judgments about Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>weapons of mass destruction. This was a major intelligence failure.”</b></p>
<p><b>900.  The evidence in this Section shows that, after the invasion, the UK </b></p>
<p><b>Government, including the intelligence community, was reluctant to admit, and to </b></p>
<p><b>recognise publicly, the mounting evidence that there had been failings in the UK’s </b></p>
<p><b>pre-conflict collection, validation, analysis and presentation of intelligence on </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq’s WMD.</b></p>
<p><b>901.  Despite the failure to identify any evidence of WMD programmes during pre-</b></p>
<p><b>conflict inspections, the UK Government remained confident that evidence would </b></p>
<p><b>be found after the Iraqi regime had been removed.</b></p>
<p><b>902.  Almost immediately after the start of the invasion, UK Ministers and officials </b></p>
<p><b>sought to lower public expectations of immediate or significant finds of WMD </b></p>
<p><b>in Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>903. </b> At the end of March 2003, Mr Scarlett informed No.10 that the Assessments Staff </p>
<p>considered that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>most sites associated with WMD production had been “cleansed over the last six </p>
<p>to nine months”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the best prospect of exposing the full extent of the WMD programmes rests </p>
<p>in free contact with scientists, and other individuals, involved in the WMD </p>
<p>programmes and the (extensive) concealment activity”.</p>
<p><b>904. </b> On 21 April, Mr Straw expressed concern to Mr Blair that the Government was </p>
<p>being pushed into a position where it accepted that war would only have been justified if </p>
<p>there was a significant find of WMD.</p>
<p><b>905. </b> The post-invasion search for WMD did not start well. XTF-75, the US-led military </p>
<p>unit responsible for locating and securing personnel, documents, electronic files, and </p>
<p>material, achieved little on WMD. It failed to make significant finds or to prevent the loss </p>
<p>of potentially valuable information.</p>
<p><b>906. </b> By May, when the US announced the creation of the ISG to take over the search </p>
<p>for WMD, the absence of significant finds in Iraq was already generating critical media </p>
<p>comment on the nature of the pre-invasion intelligence.</p>
<p><b>907. </b> The UK Government employed the same arguments used to explain the </p>
<p>inspectors’ lack of finds – the regime’s skill at cheating and concealment and the need to </p>
<p>conduct interviews with key personnel – to explain the lack of any significant finds from </p>
<p>the early post-invasion searches.</p>
<p><b>908. </b> The Government sought to emphasise the complexity of the exercise and the time </p>
<p>needed for work to be completed.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>606</p>
<p><b>909. </b> The early discovery of two mobile trailers was the most significant find, but the </p>
<p>trailers’ use for BW production remained unproven.</p>
<p><b>910.  The lack of evidence to support pre-conflict claims about Iraq’s WMD </b></p>
<p><b>challenged the credibility of the Government and the intelligence community, and </b></p>
<p><b>the legitimacy of the war.</b></p>
<p><b>911.  The Government and the intelligence community were both concerned about </b></p>
<p><b>the consequences of the presentational aspects of their pre-war assessments </b></p>
<p><b>being discredited.</b></p>
<p><b>912. </b> Although the US proposed the creation of the ISG in April, it was not launched </p>
<p>until 30 May. Mr Tenet appointed Dr Kay as the ISG’s first Head on 11 June and it was </p>
<p>another two months before Mr Scarlett was able to inform No.10 on 10 August that the </p>
<p>ISG was “fully operational”.</p>
<p><b>913.  By June, the Government had acknowledged the need for a review of </b></p>
<p><b>the UK’s pre-conflict intelligence on Iraq. It responded to demands for an </b></p>
<p><b>independent, judge-led inquiry by expressing support for the reviews initiated by </b></p>
<p><b>the ISC and the FAC.</b></p>
<p><b>914.  The announcement of the Hutton Inquiry into the circumstances surrounding </b></p>
<p><b>the death of Dr David Kelly on 18 July reinforced the Government’s position that </b></p>
<p><b>additional reviews were not needed.</b></p>
<p><b>915.  The Government maintained that position until January 2004, backed </b></p>
<p><b>by three votes in the House of Commons (on 4 June, 15 July and 22 October) </b></p>
<p><b>rejecting a succession of Opposition motions calling for an independent inquiry </b></p>
<p><b>into the use of pre-war intelligence.</b></p>
<p><b>916.  Mr Blair’s initial response to growing criticism of the failure to find WMD was </b></p>
<p><b>to counsel patience.</b></p>
<p><b>917. </b> In Washington on 17 July, Mr Blair told the media that he believed “with every </p>
<p>fibre of instinct and conviction” that he would be proved right about the threat from Iraqi </p>
<p>WMD, but that it was important to wait for the ISG to complete its work.</p>
<p><b>918. </b> In his Interim Report to Congress on 2 October, Dr Kay stated that the ISG had </p>
<p>not found stocks of weapons. He judged that, although it was “far too early” to reach </p>
<p>definitive conclusions, Saddam Hussein “had not given up his aspirations and intentions </p>
<p>to continue to acquire weapons of mass destruction”.</p>
<p><b>919. </b> Despite finding that Saddam Hussein had breached Security Council resolutions </p>
<p>and that he had intended to restart his WMD programmes as soon as he was able, the </p>
<p>ISG Interim Report did not change the tone of the public debate.</p>
<p><b>920.  After the publication of the ISG Interim Report, the Government’s focus </b></p>
<p><b>shifted from finding stockpiles of weapons to emphasising evidence of the Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>regime’s strategic intent.</b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>607</p>
<p><b>921. </b> Mr Blair sought to redefine the public debate, shifting focus away from the failure </p>
<p>to find WMD and concerns about the reliability of intelligence towards efforts to counter </p>
<p>global proliferation and what he assessed to be the positive impact of military action in </p>
<p>Iraq on those efforts.</p>
<p><b>922. </b> On 5 October, in response to the failure to find “enough on WMD” and the </p>
<p>deteriorating security situation in Iraq, Mr Blair outlined to President Bush a new strategy </p>
<p>“to get us back on the high ground and get the public … to focus on the big picture”. </p>
<p>He concluded:</p>
<p>“WMD/terror remains the 21st century threat. Our global agenda is the only way to a </p>
<p>better future not just for us but for the world. We’re not going soft on it. We’re going </p>
<p>to be utterly determined on it, because it’s right.”</p>
<p><b>923. </b> In autumn 2003, the ISG faced increasing obstacles to its WMD investigations, </p>
<p>caused mostly by the deteriorating security situation, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>constraints on ISG staff mobility;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a reluctance among Iraqi experts to talk openly about Saddam Hussein’s WMD </p>
<p>programmes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>growing pressure from Washington to transfer resources from the search for </p>
<p>WMD to counter-insurgency.</p>
<p><b>924. </b> The diversion of resources from WMD to counter-insurgency was reported to have </p>
<p>contributed to Dr Kay’s decision in December to resign as Head of the ISG.</p>
<p><b>925. </b> On 11 January 2004, in an interview with Sir David Frost, Mr Blair drew attention </p>
<p>to emerging evidence from the ISG of “clandestine operations that should have been </p>
<p>disclosed to the United Nations”. Mr Blair still believed weapons would be found, but </p>
<p>commented that “we just have to wait and see”.</p>
<p><b>926. </b> Points made in a Cabinet discussion on Iraq on 15 January included the </p>
<p>observation that public opinion continued to focus on the absence of WMD, while </p>
<p>the broader counter-proliferation story was inadequately covered.</p>
<p><b>927. </b> Pressure for an independent inquiry in the UK continued to grow.</p>
<p><b>928. </b> Secretary Powell’s comment on 24 January that it was an “open question” </p>
<p>whether Iraq held any stocks of WMD, widely reported in the UK media, caused the </p>
<p>UK Government considerable difficulty.</p>
<p><b>929. </b> The Government’s response was to try to keep “in very close step” with the US. </p>
<p>As late as 26 January, UK officials informed their US counterparts that the Government </p>
<p>would continue to argue that, after the ISC, FAC and Hutton, there was no need for a </p>
<p>further inquiry on intelligence.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>608</p>
<p><b>930.  Once President Bush made clear his decision to set up an independent </b></p>
<p><b>inquiry, Mr Blair’s resistance to a public inquiry became untenable.</b></p>
<p><b>931. </b> By 29 January, the day after the publication of the Hutton Report, it was clear </p>
<p>to Mr Blair that President Bush intended to set up an independent US inquiry into </p>
<p>pre-conflict intelligence before he was forced to do so by Congress.</p>
<p><b>932. </b> In his ‘Note on WMD’, sent to President Bush on 31 January, Mr Blair concluded </p>
<p>that, if it proved necessary to accept that some of the intelligence on Iraqi WMD was </p>
<p>wrong, it would be important not to “start pretending” that Iraq had nothing, or to </p>
<p>allow inaccuracies in the intelligence to distract the UK and US from “confronting the </p>
<p>WMD issue”.</p>
<p><b>933. </b> On 2 February, the same day as President Bush confirmed the imminent </p>
<p>announcement of a “bipartisan independent commission”, Mr Blair agreed to set up </p>
<p>a committee of Privy Councillors with wider Terms of Reference than the ISC inquiry, </p>
<p>looking at “intelligence on WMD in general, not just Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>934. </b> Mr Straw announced the creation of the Butler Review to Parliament on 3 February, </p>
<p>three days before President Bush signed the Executive Order establishing the </p>
<p>US Commission.</p>
<p><b>935.  After the announcement of the Butler Review, the UK Government’s focus </b></p>
<p><b>shifted to the content of the next ISG report, the Status Report.</b></p>
<p><b>936.  The Government, still concerned about the nature of the public debate on </b></p>
<p><b>WMD in the UK, sought to ensure that the Status Report included existing ISG </b></p>
<p><b>material highlighting the strategic intentions of Saddam Hussein’s regime and </b></p>
<p><b>breaches of Security Council resolutions.</b></p>
<p><b>937. </b> Mr Duelfer began work on the ISG Status Report shortly after replacing Dr Kay as </p>
<p>Head of the ISG on 23 January.</p>
<p><b>938. </b> During his call on Mr Blair in London on 9 February, Mr Duelfer stated that it was </p>
<p>his hypothesis that the regime’s strategy had been to outlast UN sanctions. He did not </p>
<p>believe that any judgements could be made until that was proven.</p>
<p><b>939. </b> In his memoir, Mr Duelfer recorded that, at that meeting, Mr Blair had been “very </p>
<p>well informed on the issue of WMD” and had given him the opportunity to go into the </p>
<p>issue in more depth than had been possible with President Bush or Dr Rice. Mr Duelfer </p>
<p>stated that Mr Blair had not made strong suggestions.</p>
<p><b>940. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald reported to Mr Blair on 4 March that Mr Duelfer had made it </p>
<p>clear that he would not accept “joint drafting” of his report. Sir Nigel had asked the FCO </p>
<p>and SIS to press their US counterparts and said that he and Mr Blair and he should raise </p>
<p>the issue with President Bush and Dr Rice.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>609</p>
<p><b>941. </b> Mr Scarlett sent Mr Duelfer “nuggets” from the September 2003 ISG Interim </p>
<p>Report, including on strategic intent, explaining that they were not intended as </p>
<p>drafting suggestions, but to identify existing ISG material worth highlighting. Many of </p>
<p>Mr Scarlett’s suggestions were incorporated into Mr Duelfer’s testimony to Congress </p>
<p>on 30 March.</p>
<p><b>942. </b> Mr Duelfer’s testimony received little publicity. Mr Blair was advised that, given </p>
<p>the security situation in Iraq, it would be extremely difficult to get further coverage in </p>
<p>anything other than negative terms.</p>
<p><b>943.  Mr Blair remained concerned about continuing public and Parliamentary </b></p>
<p><b>criticism of the pre-conflict intelligence, the failure to find WMD and the decision </b></p>
<p><b>to invade Iraq. After the reports from the Hutton Inquiry, the ISG and the US </b></p>
<p><b>Commission, he sought to demonstrate that, although “the exact basis for action </b></p>
<p><b>was not as we thought”, the invasion had still been justified.</b></p>
<p><b>944. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush on 16 June that he remained “deeply concerned” </p>
<p>about WMD. He expressed the wish that “if at all possible”, the reports of the Senate </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee, the Butler Review and the ISG “should have this issue dealt with </p>
<p>and lanced all at the same time”.</p>
<p><b>945. </b> Mr Blair suggested to President Bush that the truth on Iraq’s WMD was probably </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein:</p>
<p>“… was developing long range ballistic missile capability in breach of UN resolutions; </p>
<p>he probably had no or no large stockpiles of tactical CW or BW weapons; but he </p>
<p>retained the capability and expertise to recommence production as soon as he </p>
<p>could, again in breach of UN resolutions …</p>
<p>“Such an explanation would mean that some of the intelligence upon which we acted </p>
<p>was wrong; but that nonetheless the threat was there, as was the breach of UN </p>
<p>resolutions. It would also explain why the picture was so confused and why, whilst </p>
<p>the exact basis of action was not as we thought, the action was still justified.”</p>
<p><b>946. </b> Mr Blair suggested that it might make sense to publish the ISG Comprehensive </p>
<p>Report at the same time as the Senate Intelligence Committee and Butler Reports to </p>
<p>“provide the clear evidential basis for saying there was indeed a threat, even if it was not </p>
<p>the threat that had been anticipated”.</p>
<p><b>947. </b> Immediately before and after the publication of the Senate Intelligence Committee </p>
<p>and Butler Reports on 7 and 14 July respectively, Mr Blair restated his conviction that </p>
<p>Iraq had posed a threat and that military action had been necessary to make progress in </p>
<p>Libya and elsewhere.</p>
<p><b>948. </b> On 6 July, Mr Blair told the Liaison Committee of the House of Commons that he </p>
<p>had to accept that stockpiles of WMD “might not be found”, but it was “absolutely clear” </p>
<p>that Saddam Hussein had the “strategic capability, the intent” and that he had committed </p>
<p>multiple breaches of UN sanctions.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>610</p>
<p><b>949. </b> Mr Blair said that he still believed that Saddam Hussein had posed a threat. </p>
<p>Without military action against Iraq, there would not have been the progress there had </p>
<p>been on Libya, AQ Khan, Iran and North Korea.</p>
<p><b>950. </b> In his statement to the House of Commons after the publication of the Butler </p>
<p>Report, Mr Blair said that Saddam Hussein “retained complete strategic intent on WMD </p>
<p>and significant capability”.</p>
<p><b>951. </b> In July, Mr Blair told President Bush that the forthcoming ISG Comprehensive </p>
<p>Report could be a powerful argument in support of the war.</p>
<p><b>952. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald set out Mr Blair’s views on handling to Dr Rice on 4 October: </p>
<p>that the failure to find stockpiles of WMD should be presented as “yesterday’s story” and </p>
<p>the media encouraged to focus on new material about strategic intent, concealment and </p>
<p>sanctions busting.</p>
<p><b>953. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush on 5 October that the ISG Comprehensive Report </p>
<p>“showed that Saddam Hussein had a clear strategic intent to develop WMD” and that </p>
<p>“terrorists had chosen to make Iraq the battleground”.</p>
<p><b>954. </b> The ISG Comprehensive Report was published on 6 October. It stated that it had </p>
<p>been Saddam Hussein’s strategic intent to “end sanctions while preserving the capability </p>
<p>to reconstitute his weapons of mass destruction (WMD) when sanctions were lifted”, and </p>
<p>that in seeking to preserve that capability his regime had breached UN sanctions.</p>
<p><b>955. </b> Addressing the state of Iraq’s WMD programmes in the years between the 1991 </p>
<p>Gulf Conflict and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Report concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s WMD capability had mostly been destroyed in 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “no credible indications” that Iraq had resumed production of </p>
<p>chemical munitions after 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was “no direct evidence” that, after 1996, Saddam Hussein had plans </p>
<p>for a new BW programme or was conducting BW-specific work for military </p>
<p>purposes.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s ability to reconstitute a nuclear weapons programme had “progressively </p>
<p>decayed” after 1991.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The 1991 Gulf War and subsequent UN resolutions and inspections had brought </p>
<p>many of Iraq’s delivery programmes to a halt, but because the UN had permitted </p>
<p>development and possession of delivery systems with a range of up to 150km, </p>
<p>Iraq was “positioned … for a potential breakout capability”.</p>
<p><b>956. </b> Mr Blair told the House of Commons on 13 October that:</p>
<p>“Those people who want to pray in aid the Iraq Survey Group in respect of stockpiles </p>
<p>of weapons must also accept the other part of what the Iraq Survey Group </p>
<p>said, which is that Saddam retained the intent and the capability – the teams of </p>

<p>4.4  |  The search for WMD</p>
<p>611</p>
<p>scientists and so on – and was in breach of United Nations resolutions. That is what </p>
<p>Mr Duelfer expressly said. It was the breach of UN resolutions and their enforcement </p>
<p>that was and is the reason for going to war.”</p>
<p><b>957.  The ISG’s findings were significant, but did not support past statements by </b></p>
<p><b>the UK and US Governments, which had focused on Iraq’s current capabilities and </b></p>
<p><b>an urgent and growing threat.</b></p>
<p><b>958.  The explanation for military action put forward by Mr Blair in October 2004 </b></p>
<p><b>was not the one given before the conflict.</b></p>
