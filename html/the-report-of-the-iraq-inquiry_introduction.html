<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>Establishing the Inquiry</b></p>
<p><b>Purpose of the Inquiry</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> On 15 June 2009, Mr Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister, told the House of Commons:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“With the last British combat troops about to return home from Iraq, now is the right </p>
<p>time to ensure that we have a proper process in place to enable us to learn the </p>
<p>lessons of the complex and often controversial events of the last six years. I am </p>
<p>today announcing the establishment of an independent Privy Counsellor committee </p>
<p>of inquiry which will consider the period from summer 2001, before military </p>
<p>operations began in March 2003, and our subsequent involvement in Iraq right up </p>
<p>to the end of July this year. The Inquiry is essential because it will ensure that, by </p>
<p>learning lessons, we strengthen the health of our democracy, our diplomacy and  </p>
<p>our military.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>2. </b> Addressing the scope of the Inquiry, Mr Brown said: </p>
<p>“No Inquiry has looked at such a long period, and no Inquiry has the powers to look </p>
<p>in so much breadth … the Iraq Inquiry will look at the run-up to conflict, the conflict </p>
<p>itself and the reconstruction, so that we can learn lessons in each and every area.” </p>
<p><b>3. </b> In his statement, Mr Brown announced that the Inquiry Committee would be made up </p>
<p>of “non-partisan public figures acknowledged to be experts and leaders in their fields”.  </p>
<p>It would be chaired by Sir John Chilcot and would include Baroness Usha Prashar,  </p>
<p>Sir Roderic Lyne, Sir Lawrence Freedman and Sir Martin Gilbert. Their biographies can </p>
<p>be found on the Inquiry’s website. It is a matter of deep regret that Sir Martin was taken </p>
<p>ill in April 2012 and was unable thereafter to participate in the Inquiry’s work. Sir Martin </p>
<p>died on 3 February 2015. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> Prior to 2009, some specific aspects of the UK’s involvement in Iraq had already been </p>
<p>examined:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee published <i>The Decision to </i></p>
<p><i>go to War in Iraq</i> on 3 July 2003. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Intelligence and Security Committee of Parliament published <i>Iraqi Weapons </i></p>
<p><i>of Mass Destruction – Intelligence and Assessments</i> on 10 September 2003. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Hutton published his <i>Report of the Inquiry into the Circumstances </i></p>
<p><i>Surrounding the Death of Dr David Kelly CMG</i> on 28 January 2004. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Committee of Privy Counsellors, chaired by Lord Butler of Brockwell, </p>
<p>published its <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> on </p>
<p>14 July 2004. Sir John Chilcot was a member of Lord Butler’s Committee. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Baha Mousa Inquiry, chaired by Sir William Gage, was established in May </p>
<p>2008 and published its conclusions on 8 September 2011.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Before the formal launch of the Iraq Inquiry, Sir John Chilcot met leaders of the </p>
<p>main opposition parties and chairs of relevant House of Commons select committees </p>
<p>(Defence, Foreign Affairs and Public Administration) as well as the Intelligence and </p>
<p>Security Committee. Those discussions helped to shape the Inquiry’s thinking on its </p>
<p>remit and approach. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> At a news conference to launch the Inquiry on 30 July 2009, Sir John Chilcot set out </p>
<p>the Terms of Reference to which the Inquiry Committee would work: </p>
<p>“[The Inquiry] will consider the period from the summer of 2001 to the end of </p>
<p>July 2009, embracing the run-up to the conflict in Iraq, the military action and its </p>
<p>aftermath. We will, therefore, be considering the United Kingdom’s involvement </p>
<p>in Iraq, including the way decisions were made and actions taken, to establish as </p>
<p>accurately and reliably as possible what happened, and to identify the lessons that </p>
<p>can be learned.”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>7. </b> Describing how the Inquiry intended to go about its work, Sir John said: </p>
<p>“… we will adopt an inquisitorial approach to our task, taking evidence direct from </p>
<p>witnesses, rather than conducting our business through lawyers. The Inquiry is not </p>
<p>a court of law and nobody is on trial, but I want to make one thing absolutely clear. </p>
<p>This Committee will not shy away from making criticisms. If we find that mistakes </p>
<p>were made, that there were issues which could have been dealt with better, we will </p>
<p>say so frankly.” </p>
<p><b>8. </b> From the outset, the Inquiry Committee took the view that it was in the public interest </p>
<p>for its work to be conducted with the greatest possible openness. This included hearing </p>
<p>witnesses in public whenever that was not precluded by security considerations, and </p>
<p>publishing as much evidence as possible alongside the Inquiry’s Report. Sir John set out </p>
<p>the Inquiry’s approach in a letter to the Prime Minister dated 21 June 2009.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Support to the Inquiry Committee</b></p>
<p><b>9. </b> In October 2009, the Inquiry announced the appointment of Sir Roger Wheeler,  </p>
<p>Chief of the General Staff from 1997 to 2000, and Dame Rosalyn Higgins, President </p>
<p>of the International Court of Justice from 2006 to 2009, as Advisers to the Inquiry </p>
<p>Committee on military matters and international law respectively. </p>
<p>2 </p>
<p>A number of other relevant inquiries or investigations were subsequently launched, including the </p>
<p>Al-Sweady Public Inquiry (which took place between November 2009 and December 2014), the Detainee </p>
<p>Inquiry (which ran from July 2010 to December 2013) and the MOD’s Iraq Historic Allegations Team, which </p>
<p>was established in March 2010. </p>

<p>Letter, Chilcot to Prime Minister, 21 June 2009, [untitled].</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Sir Roger and Dame Rosalyn provided advice to the Committee in areas where their </p>
<p>specialist professional knowledge was required to understand fully the issues involved. </p>
<p>They contributed to the development of detailed lines of questioning ahead of public </p>
<p>hearings and offered expert advice on the interpretation of evidence in relevant areas  </p>
<p>of the Inquiry’s work as the Inquiry Committee formulated its conclusions. </p>
<p><b>11. </b> Throughout its work, the Inquiry has been supported by a small Secretariat. </p>
<p>Members of staff have been drawn from a range of government departments, including </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office, the Department for International Development (DFID), the Foreign </p>
<p>and Commonwealth Office (FCO), the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence (MOD), </p>
<p>the Ministry of Justice and the Serious Fraud Office. The Inquiry has employed a small </p>
<p>number of support staff from outside government and from time to time has also drawn </p>
<p>on a small amount of additional resource from within the Civil Service. </p>
<p><b>12. </b> The Secretariat was headed by Ms Margaret Aldred, who was named as Secretary </p>
<p>to the Inquiry in July 2009. The Inquiry had three Deputy Secretaries during the course </p>
<p>of its work – Ms Alicia Forsyth (2009 to 2011), Ms Claire Salters (2009 to 2012) and  </p>
<p>Ms Katharine Hammond (2012 to 2016) – and two Legal Advisers – Ms Sarah Goom </p>
<p>(2009 to 2012) and Mr Stephen Myers (2011 to 2016). </p>
<p><b>13. </b> The Secretariat has provided essential administrative, logistical and research </p>
<p>assistance to the Inquiry in arranging and managing hearing sessions; obtaining, </p>
<p>processing and declassifying evidence; and preparing material for consideration by  </p>
<p>the Inquiry Committee. </p>
<p><b>Avoiding conflicts of interest</b></p>
<p><b>14. </b> From the start, the Inquiry has sought to be transparent about potential conflicts  </p>
<p>of interest and has taken steps to ensure that they have not affected its work. In this,  </p>
<p>the Committee and Secretariat have been conscious of the Civil Service core values  </p>
<p>of integrity, honesty, objectivity and impartiality.</p>
<p><b>15. </b> All members of the Committee have had long careers in which they have at times </p>
<p>worked in or with government and in other areas of public affairs. Their experience </p>
<p>means that many of the witnesses who gave evidence to the Inquiry were previously </p>
<p>known to members of the Committee as colleagues or professional contacts. The </p>
<p>Inquiry has been scrupulous to ensure that no-one has received different or preferential </p>
<p>treatment as a result. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Sir Roderic Lyne served as British Ambassador to the Russian Federation between </p>
<p>2000 and 2004, during which time he acted on UK Government instructions in relation  </p>
<p>to Iraq and reported in several telegrams on the Russian Government’s approach.  </p>
<p>Those telegrams have been declassified and are published alongside the Report.</p>
<p><b>17. </b> On 18 January 2010, the Inquiry published a letter on its website from Sir Lawrence </p>
<p>Freedman to Sir John Chilcot outlining the advice he provided ahead of Mr Blair’s </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>1999 Chicago speech (see Section 1.1). That advice is also published on the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>website. Sir Lawrence also participated in expert seminars before the invasion of Iraq. </p>
<p>Other than as the official historian of the Falklands Campaign, Sir Lawrence has never </p>
<p>held a position of paid employment in government. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> When Sir Gus O’Donnell, the Cabinet Secretary, nominated Ms Margaret Aldred </p>
<p>to be Secretary to the Inquiry he did so in full knowledge of Ms Aldred’s role as Deputy </p>
<p>Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat in the Cabinet Office between 2004 </p>
<p>and 2009.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> Given the values of the Civil Service, Sir Gus saw no conflict of interest in </p>
<p>Ms Aldred’s appointment, a point repeated by Sir John Chilcot in his evidence to the </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 4 February 2015.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The Inquiry has considered a number of documents produced by the Overseas </p>
<p>and Defence Secretariat during Ms Aldred’s tenure as Deputy Head. The Committee </p>
<p>has had full access to these papers, including minutes written by Ms Aldred and papers </p>
<p>she approved. Ms Aldred’s name is clearly identifiable where any such evidence is cited </p>
<p>in the Report. </p>
<p><b>The Inquiry’s approach</b></p>
<p><b>Initial meetings</b></p>
<p><b>20. </b> At the start of its work, the Inquiry held meetings in Belfast, Bristol, Edinburgh, </p>
<p>London and Manchester with some of the families of members of the Armed Forces </p>
<p>who died on, or as a result of, military operations in Iraq. The Inquiry also met serving </p>
<p>and former Service Personnel in London, Manchester, Shrivenham and Tidworth and </p>
<p>at Headley Court. The Inquiry wanted to hear directly from both groups about their </p>
<p>experiences, and in particular about the issues on which they considered the Inquiry </p>
<p>should focus. </p>
<p><b>21. </b> Those discussions were extremely valuable in shaping the Inquiry’s work, and the </p>
<p>Inquiry is grateful to all those who took part for their contribution. The Inquiry has sought </p>
<p>to address in its Report many of the points that were raised in the meetings and which </p>
<p>fell within its Terms of Reference. Where the Inquiry’s Report makes specific reference </p>
<p>to a point that was raised, it has not attributed it to an individual. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> In November 2009, the Inquiry held two seminars with a range of experts on Iraq to </p>
<p>inform the Inquiry’s approach to its task ahead of witness hearings. The first considered </p>
<p>the evolution of international policy towards Iraq between 1990 and 2003 as well as the </p>
<p>state of Iraq and the region on the eve of the invasion, and the second considered the </p>
<p>causes and consequences of Iraq’s descent into violence after the invasion.</p>
<p>5 </p>
<p>From June 2007, the Overseas and Defence Secretariat was known as the Foreign and Defence Policy </p>
<p>Secretariat.</p>

<p>Foreign Affairs Committee, 4 February 2015, <i>Oral Evidence: Progress of the Iraq Inquiry</i>, HC 1027.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The papers produced to inform those seminars are available on the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>website. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> The foundation for the Inquiry’s conclusions is an account of the decisions </p>
<p>and actions that were taken by the UK between 2001 and 2009 in relation to Iraq. </p>
<p>As Mr Brown told the House of Commons in 2009, the scope of this account </p>
<p>is unprecedented in duration and breadth and constitutes a large part of the </p>
<p>Inquiry’s Report.</p>
<p><b>Issues not addressed by the Inquiry</b></p>
<p><b>25. </b> There are a number of issues that have not been addressed in the Report because </p>
<p>they lie outside the scope of the Inquiry or are subject to continuing investigation </p>
<p>elsewhere. They include: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Responsibility for the events of 11 September 2001.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s role in Afghanistan, except where decisions on Afghanistan had an </p>
<p>impact on options available in Iraq, or where the Government sought to apply </p>
<p>lessons from Afghanistan in Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the death of Dr David Kelly. The Inquiry has no </p>
<p>statutory powers and is not qualified to decide on Coronial matters.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the deaths of individual Service Personnel.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The effect of the sanctions regime on the civilian population of Iraq, except </p>
<p>where it had an impact on UK policy on Iraq in the period before the invasion.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The compulsory return of asylum seekers from the UK to Iraq is touched on,  </p>
<p>but not examined in detail. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The details of the Government’s operational response to the kidnapping of UK </p>
<p>citizens. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> One further aspect of the UK’s involvement in Iraq which has generated a great deal </p>
<p>of public concern has been the alleged, and in some instances proven, ill treatment of </p>
<p>detainees.</p>
<p><b>27. </b> The Inquiry’s Terms of Reference did not require it to examine individual cases of </p>
<p>detention; nor, as a non-statutory public inquiry, was it constituted or equipped to do so. </p>
<p>The Inquiry took the view, moreover, that its role was to consider the development and </p>
<p>implementation of government policy, rather than to examine operational decisions and </p>
<p>actions affecting individual cases. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> The Inquiry did consider whether it might examine systemic issues relating to the </p>
<p>detention and treatment of military and civilian prisoners. For the reasons set out below, </p>
<p>it was decided not to do so.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> When the Inquiry was established in July 2009, the Government had already </p>
<p>established a Public Inquiry led by Sir William Gage to investigate the death, on </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>15 September 2003, of Mr Baha Mousa, an Iraqi citizen who had been held in the British </p>
<p>Temporary Detention Facility in Basra.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Although the purpose of that Inquiry was to examine a specific incident, it was clear </p>
<p>that in doing so, and in order to report as required, Sir William would examine the basis </p>
<p>and framework for detention in Iraq and would, if appropriate, make recommendations  </p>
<p>to the Defence Secretary.</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Mousa’s relatives had been party to proceedings which, in due course, resulted </p>
<p>in appeals to the Court of Appeal and House of Lords and, on 7 July 2011, in a ruling in </p>
<p>the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>32. </b> A Public Inquiry was also sought by a separate group of claimants in proceedings in </p>
<p>the High Court during April, May and July 2009. In these proceedings, it was alleged that </p>
<p>UK forces murdered Iraqi detainees at Camp Abu Naji in southern Iraq and subjected </p>
<p>others to ill treatment both at Camp Abu Naji and at the Divisional Temporary Detention </p>
<p>Facility at Shaibah on 14 and 15 May 2004.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The Inquiry was also aware in 2009 that a number of other cases of alleged </p>
<p>mistreatment of detainees had been brought to the attention of the MOD. Some of  </p>
<p>these had been the subject of civil claims and had been settled; others were pending. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> On 1 March 2010, Mr Bill Rammell, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, laid </p>
<p>a Written Ministerial Statement announcing the establishment of the Iraq Historic </p>
<p>Allegations Team (IHAT). Its purpose was to ensure that these cases were investigated </p>
<p>“thoroughly and expeditiously, so that – one way or another – the truth behind them  </p>
<p>is established”.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>35. </b> In view of these continuing Inquiries and investigations, the Inquiry Committee </p>
<p>decided that it should not examine issues relating to the question of detention. It </p>
<p>appeared to the Committee that, if it was to do so, there was a danger that it might </p>
<p>duplicate the work of these other Inquiries and investigations or otherwise impede  </p>
<p>their progress, or the reverse.</p>
<p><b>36. <i></b> The Report of the Baha Mousa Inquiry</i> was published on 8 September 2011.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It examined the events which resulted in Mr Mousa’s death but also wider issues </p>
<p>concerning the detention and treatment of individuals, including training and the chain  </p>
<p>of command. It made 73 recommendations. </p>

<p>9 </p>
<p>It was announced on 25 November 2009 that a Public Inquiry would be established, led by Sir John </p>
<p>Thayne Forbes, to examine these allegations. Named after the First Claimant in the civil proceedings,  </p>
<p>it was known as “The Al Sweady Inquiry”.</p>

<p><b>37. <i></b> The Report of the Al Sweady Inquiry</i> was published on 17 December 2014.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It examined in detail (and rejected) the allegations of ill treatment at Camp Abu Naji.  </p>
<p>It made a limited number of further recommendations, noting that the MOD had </p>
<p>accepted 72 of the recommendations made by Sir William Gage and was in the </p>
<p>process of implementing them.</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The work of the IHAT is continuing.</p>
<p><b>Hearings</b></p>
<p><b>39. </b> The Inquiry took evidence from more than 150 witnesses from a range of </p>
<p>backgrounds, in more than 130 sessions of oral evidence, in order to assist it in building </p>
<p>a balanced and accurate account of events. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The principles on which hearings were run are described in the <i>Protocol for </i></p>
<p><i>Witnesses giving evidence to the Iraq Inquiry</i> (hereafter, the Witness Protocol) which  </p>
<p>is available on the Inquiry’s website. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> Hearings began in November 2009, and were conducted in four tranches, in </p>
<p>between which the Committee received and assessed other sources of evidence.  </p>
<p>The rounds were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>13 November 2009 to 8 February 2010;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>5 March 2010 to 8 March 2010;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>29 June 2010 to 30 July 2010; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>18 January 2011 to 4 February 2011.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> In his opening statement on 13 November 2009, Sir John Chilcot explained that the </p>
<p>first five weeks of hearings would be used to establish, from those who were directly </p>
<p>involved, the essential features of the UK’s involvement in Iraq and how they developed. </p>
<p>Future sessions would probe matters in further detail, or re-examine issues in the light  </p>
<p>of subsequent evidence seen by the Committee.</p>
<p><b>43. </b> The majority of witnesses gave evidence in a public session. The Inquiry wanted </p>
<p>hearings to be as accessible to the public as possible, so in addition to having ticketed </p>
<p>(free) public access, sessions were also available for broadcast on television and over </p>
<p>the internet. The recordings can still be viewed on the Inquiry’s website. The first public </p>
<p>hearing was held on 24 November 2009 and the last on 2 February 2011.</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Sir John made clear at the start of each hearing that the witness was giving </p>
<p>evidence based on his or her recollection of events, which the Inquiry would then </p>
<p>compare with the contemporary documentary record. After the hearing, witnesses  </p>
<p>were asked to review the transcript of their evidence, and certify that the evidence  </p>
<p>given was truthful, fair and accurate. Those transcripts appear on the Inquiry’s website. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>9</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The Inquiry heard from 35 witnesses in private. The circumstances in which the </p>
<p>Inquiry agreed to hold private hearings are laid out in the Witness Protocol. In some </p>
<p>cases, evidence was heard in private because of a risk of damage to national security  </p>
<p>or other vital national interests. In others, it was due to the personal circumstances of </p>
<p>the witnesses, or because of the organisations for which they worked. The names of </p>
<p>some witnesses therefore do not appear, and are replaced by ciphers. Transcripts of these </p>
<p>sessions, reviewed and certified by the witnesses as truthful, fair and accurate, can also </p>
<p>be found on the Inquiry’s website. In many cases some material has been redacted by the </p>
<p>Government in order to prevent potential harm to national security or international relations. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> In order to hear the experiences of more junior civilian staff who had served in Iraq </p>
<p>between 2003 and 2009, the Inquiry issued invitations to a series of group meetings. </p>
<p>A total of 48 people from a range of departments, including the FCO, the MOD and </p>
<p>DFID, attended. No contractors responded to the Inquiry’s invitation. Discussions at </p>
<p>the meetings focused on strategy and delivery, and the support provided to civilian staff </p>
<p>working in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>47. </b> The Inquiry has addressed a number of the points that were raised in these </p>
<p>meetings, but has not attributed those points to any individual. </p>
<p><b>Written evidence</b></p>
<p><b>48. </b> In identifying areas to explore with witnesses and in drafting its account of events, </p>
<p>the Inquiry has necessarily relied heavily on official documents as the most reliable </p>
<p>record of government business, the factors which led to major decisions and the </p>
<p>substance of those decisions. </p>
<p><b>49. </b> The Inquiry recognises that the documentary record cannot by itself provide  </p>
<p>a comprehensive account of all that happened, but contemporary documents have </p>
<p>particular weight when their explicit purpose was to provide a formal record: for instance, </p>
<p>minutes of formal meetings or papers and submissions to Ministers which sought </p>
<p>approval for a specific decision. </p>
<p><b>50. </b> Individual documents necessarily reflect the purpose for which they were produced </p>
<p>and the knowledge and perspective of their authors. Minutes of meetings are necessarily </p>
<p>selective and depend on judgements about what needs to be recorded and what can </p>
<p>be omitted. Dissenting views are likely to be under-represented, not least because the </p>
<p>focus may be on recording conclusions rather than the discussion. Records of formal </p>
<p>meetings would, however, have been circulated to the participants who were able to </p>
<p>seek amendments if they wished. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Each document has been considered and interpreted in the context of the events </p>
<p>and issues being addressed, its relationship to other contemporary documents, and with </p>
<p>an understanding of the language and professional background of the author. Different </p>
<p>government departments have their own styles and approaches.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>52. </b> When he established the Inquiry, Mr Brown stated that it would have access to all </p>
<p>government records. The Inquiry has received more than 150,000 such documents </p>
<p>during the course of its work. Where it has not been possible for the relevant department </p>
<p>to supply a document that the Inquiry believes existed, that is indicated in the text.  </p>
<p>The Inquiry has no reason to believe that any document has been deliberately withheld. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> The Inquiry has examined material produced before summer 2001 and after July </p>
<p>2009 where that is necessary for a full understanding of the Government’s response  </p>
<p>to events between those dates. </p>
<p><b>54. </b> The Inquiry’s access to, and ability to publish material from, documents produced </p>
<p>by the UK Government has been governed by the <i>Protocol between the Iraq Inquiry </i></p>
<p><i>and Her Majesty’s Government regarding Documents and Other Written and Electronic </i></p>
<p><i>Information</i>. The Protocol can be found on the Inquiry’s website and on www.gov.uk.  </p>
<p>It applies a test to determine when material may be disclosed publicly which is specific </p>
<p>to this Inquiry, and which differs from the criteria set by the Freedom of Information Act </p>
<p>2000. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Throughout its duration, the Inquiry has sought the Government’s permission to </p>
<p>publish material under the terms of the Protocol. It has done so by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asking for the declassification of whole documents where they are considered </p>
<p>to be particularly significant. Around 1,800 of these documents, including </p>
<p>any redactions required by the Government, appear on the Inquiry’s website </p>
<p>alongside this Report. Redactions appear as blank white space, not as black </p>
<p>lines.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Asking for agreement to disclose a limited amount of material from documents, </p>
<p>either in the form of a directly quoted extract, a summary of the document’s </p>
<p>contents (known as a “gist”) or a mixture of the two. The source for a quote or </p>
<p>gist is included as a footnote in the Report. The Inquiry has used material from </p>
<p>around 7,000 documents in this way. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> The material agreed by the Government for disclosure by the Inquiry is highly </p>
<p>unusual in its scale and sensitivity.</p>
<p>PUBLICATION OF THE MOST SENSITIVE DOCUMENTS</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Some categories of document to which the Inquiry considered it necessary to refer </p>
<p>raise difficult issues of principle for the Government. </p>
<p><b>58. </b> This Report therefore contains, exceptionally, material of a kind which would </p>
<p>normally be regarded as highly sensitive and confidential, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extracts from Cabinet minutes;</p>
<p>13 </p>
<p>In JIC Assessments, which have been retyped by the Inquiry at the Government’s request, redactions </p>
<p>appear as “[…]”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>extracts from, or summaries of, exchanges between former Prime Ministers and </p>
<p>the former US President; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>material drawn from or otherwise relating to very sensitive security and </p>
<p>intelligence sources, including a large number of Assessments by the Joint </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee (JIC). </p>
<p><b>59. </b> This information is central to understanding the UK Government’s strategic  </p>
<p>decision-making in Iraq, and is therefore essential to the Inquiry’s work. Disclosure  </p>
<p>of such information is undertaken under the terms of the Protocol agreed between the </p>
<p>Government and the Inquiry at the outset of the Inquiry. In agreeing to the inclusion  </p>
<p>of this material, the Government has had regard to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the exceptional nature of the Inquiry (a once in a generation Public Inquiry that is </p>
<p>entirely independent of government); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the exceptional public interest in the matters which the Inquiry was established </p>
<p>to examine;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of the Inquiry being able to consider these matters in the round </p>
<p>and to give a proper and sufficient account of them in its Report; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the consequent justification of the inclusion of such material in the Report to the </p>
<p>extent strictly necessary to enable the Inquiry to fulfil its task. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> In reaching agreement to the publication of material necessary for the purposes of </p>
<p>the Inquiry, the Government has made clear that the publication of this material in these </p>
<p>exceptional circumstances does not involve the setting of any precedent, that any future </p>
<p>decisions about the disclosure of comparable material (including under the Freedom of </p>
<p>Information Act 2000) must be taken on their merits, and that the concept of precedent </p>
<p>has no place in relation to disclosure decisions.</p>
<p><b>61. </b> Sir Jeremy Heywood’s letters of 21 January 2014 and 22 May 2014, which record </p>
<p>his agreement to the publication of material from Cabinet minutes and communications </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and President Bush, can be read in full on the Inquiry’s website.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MINUTES OF CABINET MEETINGS</p>
<p><b>62. </b> The Inquiry recognises the importance of the principle of protecting the </p>
<p>confidentiality of Cabinet discussions in order to support collective Cabinet responsibility </p>
<p>and effective government. But, for the reasons set out above, it also considered that it </p>
<p>would not be possible to complete its task effectively without the ability to refer to the </p>
<p>records of Cabinet meetings (entitled Cabinet Conclusions) or the records of relevant </p>
<p>Sub-Committees of Cabinet. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>63. </b> This report refers to 92 records of the meeting of Cabinet itself. Of those records, </p>
<p>the Inquiry considered that five were of such significance that the text recording </p>
<p>discussion of Iraq should be published in its entirety. Those extracts appear on  </p>
<p>the Inquiry’s website and relate to Cabinet meetings held on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>7 March 2002;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>23 September 2002;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>16 January 2003;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>13 March 2003; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>17 March 2003. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> The Inquiry has also reviewed extracts from the notebooks of the Cabinet Secretary </p>
<p>and Cabinet Secretariat relating to Cabinet discussions of Iraq between 2001 and </p>
<p>20 March 2003 to satisfy itself that there were no material omissions from the formal </p>
<p>minutes.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> The committee structure below Cabinet, which usually changes after the arrival of  </p>
<p>a new Prime Minister, is described in Section 2. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> This Report includes descriptions of discussions and decisions in 111 meetings of </p>
<p>Cabinet Committees, held between 2002 and 2009. </p>
<p>COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE UK PRIME MINISTER AND US PRESIDENT</p>
<p><b>67. </b> As already described, in many instances the approach taken by the UK Government </p>
<p>can only be understood in the context of its dialogue with Washington and the evolution </p>
<p>of US policy. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> As a consequence, some of the clearest expressions of Mr Blair’s thoughts on Iraq </p>
<p>are to be found in his oral and written exchanges with President Bush.</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Discussions between Prime Minister and President – by telephone, by video </p>
<p>conference or in person – were in most cases recorded by a No.10 Private Secretary  </p>
<p>or Adviser in the form of a letter to the department(s) with a policy interest in the content </p>
<p>of the conversation, in line with normal Civil Service practice.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> This report refers to 212 of those records, covering discussions held by both Mr Blair </p>
<p>and subsequently Mr Brown with President Bush, and a small number of conversations </p>
<p>between Mr Brown and President Obama. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Mr Blair also, throughout his time in office, wrote ‘Notes’ directly to President Bush. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> This report refers to 30 Notes from Mr Blair to President Bush, all but one of which </p>
<p>are published as documents in their own right on the Inquiry’s website. Redactions which </p>
<p>the Government has considered necessary in order to approve their publication are </p>
<p>included as blank white space, not as black lines. </p>

<p>Introduction</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PRIVILEGE AND THE LAW OFFICERS’ CONVENTION</p>
<p><b>73. </b> A further category of sensitive document which the Inquiry has considered relates  </p>
<p>to legal advice provided to the Government. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> The Government is entitled to obtain legal advice in confidence, and to be certain </p>
<p>that the advice it receives will remain confidential unless the right to confidentiality is </p>
<p>expressly waived. This is in accordance with a long-established principle known as  </p>
<p>Legal Professional Privilege (LPP). </p>
<p><b>75. </b> In addition, there is a long-standing convention, adhered to by successive </p>
<p>governments and reflected in the Ministerial Code, that neither the fact that the  </p>
<p>Law Officers have been consulted in relation to a particular matter, nor the substance  </p>
<p>of the advice they have given, is disclosed outside government without their authority.</p>
<p><b>76. </b> On 12 January 2004, in response to a question asked by Lord Alexander,  </p>
<p>Baroness Amos told the House of Lords that she was:</p>
<p>“… aware of only two cases in which Law Officers’ advice was disclosed. In both </p>
<p>cases, disclosure was made for the purposes of judicial proceedings. In 1993, </p>
<p>Law Officers’ advice relevant to the subject matter of the Arms to Iraq Inquiry was </p>
<p>disclosed to the Scott Inquiry. The advice was published in an annex to the Inquiry </p>
<p>report. Law Officers’ advice on the 1988 Merchant Shipping Act was disclosed to the </p>
<p>other parties in the course of the Factortame litigation in which Spanish fishermen </p>
<p>were seeking damages from the Government for a breach of Community Law.</p>
<p>“I am aware of three other cases in which the views of the Law Officers on a </p>
<p>particular matter were disclosed, but not the actual advice. In February 1971, the </p>
<p>substance of the Law Officers’ advice relating to the UK’s obligations to supply arms </p>
<p>to South Africa under the Simonstown Agreement was published in a command </p>
<p>paper (Cmnd 4589). In February 1993, the views of the Law Officers’ advice were </p>
<p>disclosed in the debate in the other House on the Maastricht Treaty. In March this </p>
<p>year the Attorney General set out in a Written Answer a summary of his view of  </p>
<p>the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq.”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>77. </b> In his <i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction</i> Lord Butler<i> </i>reported </p>
<p>that his Committee had read Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March 2003 and referred very </p>
<p>briefly to its contents.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> His report did not, however, disclose details of the advice.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> In the </p>
<p>spring of 2005, Lord Goldsmith’s advice was leaked and, following a number of Freedom </p>
<p>of Information Act requests, the Government disclosed the full advice on 28 April 2005. </p>

<p>16 </p>
<p><i>Review of Intelligence on Weapons of Mass Destruction </i>[“The Butler Report”], 14 July 2004, HC 898, </p>
<p>page 94. </p>
<p>17 </p>
<p>Lord Butler identified one other occasion when Law Officers’ advice had been disclosed: during the </p>
<p>“Westland Affair”, which resulted in the resignation of two Cabinet Ministers, a letter from the Solicitor </p>
<p>General to the Defence Secretary, which had already been leaked in part, was published. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>78. </b> In October 2009, Baroness Scotland, the Attorney General, agreed to waive LPP </p>
<p>in respect of legal advice given to Government up to the commencement of military </p>
<p>action on 20 March 2003. Baroness Scotland also confirmed that she was content for </p>
<p>witnesses called by the Inquiry to give evidence, notwithstanding the Law Officers’ </p>
<p>Convention, on an exceptional basis. </p>
<p><b>79. </b> In June 2010, following the Inquiry’s request for the declassification of Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith’s draft advice of 14 January 2003 on the legal basis for military action, </p>
<p>Sir Gus O’Donnell wrote to Sir John Chilcot setting out the Government’s position. </p>
<p>Sir Gus advised that the Government had decided to declassify the draft legal advice, </p>
<p>but emphasised the exceptional nature of that decision, and that it reflected the </p>
<p>exceptional and unusual circumstances of the Iraq Inquiry. He stated that the legal basis </p>
<p>for military action might be considered to hold a unique status and emphasised that the </p>
<p>Government’s position remained that there is a strong public interest in protecting both </p>
<p>the convention that neither the advice of the Law Officers, nor the fact that they have </p>
<p>been consulted, is disclosed outside government, and the principle of LPP. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Sir Gus asked the Inquiry to publish his letter on its website in order to clarify </p>
<p>publicly the grounds on which the decision had been taken, and the Inquiry did so. </p>
<p>The Inquiry accepts the Government’s position that there is a strong public interest </p>
<p>in protecting the principle of LPP and the Law Officers’ Convention. The Inquiry also </p>
<p>recognises the exceptional nature of the Government’s decision to declassify legal </p>
<p>advice on the basis for military action. The Inquiry accepts that there is a distinction </p>
<p>between legal advice on the decision to take military action, which we agree has a </p>
<p>unique status, and legal advice on the numerous issues that arose during the course </p>
<p>of the UK’s joint Occupation of Iraq, and the continued presence of UK troops in </p>
<p>sovereign Iraq.</p>
<p><b>81. </b> The Government subsequently agreed to the declassification of a number of other </p>
<p>documents from the pre-invasion period to which the Law Officers’ Convention applied. </p>
<p><b>82. </b> In a letter to the Inquiry dated 9 June 2014, the Attorney General’s Office confirmed </p>
<p>that, without prejudice to the importance of the convention governing the disclosure of </p>
<p>Law Officers’ advice, it would consider requests for permission to publish material drawn </p>
<p>from Law Officers’ documents relating to the post-invasion period on a case-by-case </p>
<p>basis. It would do so on the basis that the Inquiry agreed that the use of direct quotation </p>
<p>from the documents should be the minimum necessary to enable the Inquiry to articulate </p>
<p>its conclusions.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>83. </b> On that basis, the Inquiry sought and received permission to make reference to  </p>
<p>a number of further documents covered by LPP and the Law Officers’ Convention.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>84. </b> The Inquiry is satisfied that it has been provided with copies of all relevant legal </p>
<p>advice and other legal papers to which it has sought access. It is entirely satisfied that it </p>
<p>has been allowed to draw on such material to the extent that it considers necessary both </p>
<p>to report its findings and explain the basis on which those findings have been made.</p>
<p><b>Open source material</b></p>
<p><b>85. </b> Although the Inquiry relied heavily on official documents as the most reliable record </p>
<p>of government business, it also drew on a wide variety of open source material to </p>
<p>produce its account. </p>
<p><b>86. </b> That material particularly includes: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>diaries, memoirs, books and articles published by key participants; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>books and articles published by academics, experts and commentators; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>newspaper articles and reports, and transcripts of speeches and interviews; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>records of Parliamentary proceedings and reports by Parliamentary Committees;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>documents published by UK government departments, including annual reports;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>records of discussions in the UN Security Council and reports to the Security </p>
<p>Council;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>documents published by UN agencies, international institutions and international </p>
<p>non-governmental organisations; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reports produced by and for the US Congress, and US Government departments </p>
<p>and agencies; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>evidence offered to previous Inquiries and their analysis and conclusions. </p>
<p><b>87. </b> Especially when considered alongside official documents, such material provided </p>
<p>valuable insights into and context for the events considered by the Inquiry. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> The Inquiry recognises that open source material reflects the purpose for which </p>
<p>it was produced and the knowledge and perspective of its author. In a number of </p>
<p>cases, the Inquiry has not been able to take evidence from the author to explore their </p>
<p>perspective. The Inquiry has therefore considered carefully the nature of the open </p>
<p>source material that it has used, and how it has presented such material in its account. </p>
<p>Wherever possible, it has compared open source material to the documentary record, </p>
<p>and in many cases (for instance Mr Alastair Campbell’s diaries) there is a high degree  </p>
<p>of consistency. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> The conclusions reached in the Inquiry’s Report remain the Inquiry’s own.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>Submissions to the Inquiry</b></p>
<p><b>90. </b> In October 2009, before the Inquiry held its first evidence hearings, Sir John Chilcot </p>
<p>invited anyone with information relevant to its Terms of Reference to get in touch. </p>
<p>Sir John said:</p>
<p>“There may be someone out there with a crucial bit of information which could show </p>
<p>an issue in a different light. It would be a great shame if that opportunity was missed.”</p>
<p><b>91. </b> In response, almost 1,500 contributions were received between 2009 and 2016.  </p>
<p>The Inquiry has considered every submission carefully and is very grateful to all those </p>
<p>who took the time to write.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> A small number of articles submitted for a series of seminars with experts on Iraq </p>
<p>were published in 2009. After considering which other submissions to publish, the </p>
<p>Inquiry decided:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to publish those submissions that offered suggested questions for, or </p>
<p>analysis of, evidence hearings, although they were of value whilst hearings were </p>
<p>taking place;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to publish submissions offering suggestions on the conduct of the Inquiry;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to publish submissions concerning matters outside the Inquiry’s Terms </p>
<p>of Reference;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to publish details of personal experiences that were shared on a </p>
<p>private basis;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to re-publish information already in the public domain, for example </p>
<p>newspaper articles or published reports, although the Inquiry was grateful for </p>
<p>the many articles, books and papers it received; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>not to publish anything it deemed offensive or incomprehensible. </p>
<p><b>93. </b> The submissions published on the Inquiry’s website alongside this Report are </p>
<p>therefore those which provide evidence to the Inquiry. In many cases they are from </p>
<p>individuals or organisations with directly relevant expertise or experience. </p>
<p><b>94. </b> The fact of publishing a submission does not in any way imply the Inquiry’s </p>
<p>acceptance of the views or statements it contains. </p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL LAW SUBMISSIONS</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Between 12 July and 13 September 2010, the Inquiry extended an open invitation </p>
<p>to international lawyers to submit their analyses of the arguments relied upon by the </p>
<p>UK Government as the legal basis for military intervention in Iraq. In a small number of </p>
<p>cases, the Inquiry also approached expert individuals directly and invited them to submit </p>
<p>their views. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>96. </b> The Inquiry specifically invited analysis of the arguments set out in the Attorney </p>
<p>General’s advice of 7 March 2003, his written answer to a question asked in the House </p>
<p>of Lords on 17 March and the FCO memorandum ‘Iraq: Legal Basis for the Use of Force’ </p>
<p>of the same date. </p>
<p><b>97. </b> Respondents were asked not to address their submissions to the legal grounds </p>
<p>relied upon by countries other than the UK. Rather, they were asked to address the </p>
<p>issues of law relating to the UK’s position, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the legal effect of operative paragraphs (OPs) 1, 4, 11 and 12 of UN Security </p>
<p>Council resolution 1441 (2002);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the significance of the word “consider” in OP12;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether by virtue of resolutions 678 (1990), 687 (1991) and 1441 the elements </p>
<p>were in place for a properly authorised use of force;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the interpretation and effect of the statements made by the Permanent Members </p>
<p>of the Security Council following the unanimous vote on resolution 1441;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the correct approach to the interpretation of Security Council resolutions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith’s evidence that the precedent was that a reasonable case was a </p>
<p>sufficient lawful basis for taking military action. </p>
<p><b>98. </b> All 37 of the legal submissions received by the Inquiry which met the criteria set out </p>
<p>above are published on the Inquiry’s website alongside this Report. The Inquiry used </p>
<p>those submissions to inform its consideration of legal issues and is grateful to everyone </p>
<p>who took the time to offer their views.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The Inquiry has not expressed a view as to whether or not the UK’s participation </p>
<p>in the conflict was lawful. Although the Inquiry has had the benefit of advice from a </p>
<p>distinguished international lawyer, it was not constituted as a Court of Law and none  </p>
<p>of its members is legally qualified.</p>
<p><b>100. </b> The opinion of this Inquiry would in any case not resolve the issue of the legality </p>
<p>of the conflict, or the UK’s participation in it. In the Inquiry’s view, that issue can only </p>
<p>be resolved by a properly constituted and internationally recognised Court which has </p>
<p>considered the issue with the benefit of submissions from Counsel representing all those </p>
<p>parties with an interest in or affected by the issue.</p>
<p><b>The actions of other governments</b></p>
<p><b>101. </b> This Inquiry was asked to consider the actions of the UK Government, not those </p>
<p>of its allies. The existence of a Coalition of states working in Iraq, however, means that </p>
<p>this report inevitably considers the decisions and actions of other countries where they </p>
<p>affected choices made by the UK. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>102. </b> That is particularly true of the US: in many instances the approach taken by the  </p>
<p>UK Government can only be understood in the context of its dialogue with Washington </p>
<p>and the evolution of US policy.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> The Inquiry has not been given access to the closed official records of other states, </p>
<p>except when those documents were shared with the UK Government and so appear in </p>
<p>its files. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> In May 2010, members of the Iraq Inquiry Committee visited France and the US </p>
<p>for meetings with a range of individuals, to gain a wider international perspective on the </p>
<p>UK’s involvement in Iraq over the period covered by the Inquiry and to provide a context </p>
<p>for accounts given to the Inquiry by UK witnesses. Ambassador L Paul Bremer provided </p>
<p>a statement to the Inquiry, which is published on our website. </p>
<p><b>105. </b> Four members of the Iraq Inquiry Committee visited Iraq in September and October </p>
<p>2010, to receive an Iraqi perspective on the UK’s involvement in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> The Committee’s discussions in France, the US and Iraq were not formal evidence </p>
<p>sessions and therefore records of the discussions have not been published. The names </p>
<p>of the individuals that the Committee met during those visits, who have confirmed that </p>
<p>they are content for their names to be published, are listed on the Inquiry’s website. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Most senior members of the Bush Administration whom the Inquiry approached </p>
<p>declined the request for such a meeting but the Inquiry was nevertheless able to </p>
<p>meet a number of officials who had been closely involved with the development and </p>
<p>implementation of US policy. </p>
<p><b>The criticism of individuals and “Maxwellisation”</b></p>
<p><b>108. </b> One of the last activities the Inquiry completed before publishing its Report was  </p>
<p>the so-called “Maxwellisation” process. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> In the course of its work, the Inquiry formed judgements which are critical of the </p>
<p>decisions or actions of individuals who occupied positions of responsibility. Although the </p>
<p>main focus of this Inquiry has been on learning lessons, where the Inquiry has reached  </p>
<p>a critical view it has expressed it frankly. Such views can be found throughout this Report. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> When the Inquiry has felt it necessary to be critical, it has sought to be fair to </p>
<p>the individual in question. Fairness requires individuals to be given the opportunity to </p>
<p>respond to potential criticism. That is the purpose of the process often referred to as </p>
<p>“Maxwellisation”.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> The Inquiry has not criticised any individual who has not given evidence to it. All </p>
<p>those who gave evidence did so in accordance with the terms of the Witness Protocol, </p>
<p>paragraph<i> </i>10 of which says:</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>“The prime purpose of the Inquiry is to identify lessons to be learned. The Inquiry  </p>
<p>is not a court of law and nobody will be on trial, although the Committee will not shy </p>
<p>away from making criticisms if warranted. In the event that a particular witness may </p>
<p>be the subject of criticism by the Inquiry, the Inquiry Secretariat will, in accordance </p>
<p>with normal practice, notify that witness separately, in writing at least seven days  </p>
<p>in advance of the evidence session, of the nature of the potential criticism and  </p>
<p>the evidence that supports it.”</p>
<p><b>112. </b> Paragraph 30 of the Witness Protocol<i> </i>says that:</p>
<p>“If the Inquiry expects to criticise an individual in the final report, that individual  </p>
<p>will, in accordance with normal practice, be provided with relevant sections of the </p>
<p>draft report in order to make any representations on the proposed criticism prior  </p>
<p>to publication of the final report.”</p>
<p><b>113. </b> All witnesses who appeared before the Inquiry were told in advance of the areas </p>
<p>that would be covered during questioning. A small number were also notified of points </p>
<p>of potential criticism before they gave evidence to the Inquiry, in accordance with </p>
<p>paragraph 10. </p>
<p><b>114. </b> Material which now forms part of the Inquiry’s Report continued to be received and </p>
<p>assessed after the conclusion of its hearings. In July 2013, the Inquiry told a number of </p>
<p>individuals that they would be given an opportunity to make representations on points  </p>
<p>of potential criticism, in accordance with paragraph 30. </p>
<p><b>115. </b> Relevant extracts from the Inquiry’s draft report were sent to those individuals </p>
<p>on a confidential basis from October 2014, following completion of the process of </p>
<p>declassifying material from the minutes of Cabinet meetings and from communications </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and President Bush. A small number of individuals received further </p>
<p>material in early 2016. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> In the Inquiry’s view, this procedure was necessary to ensure fairness to those  </p>
<p>who might be criticised in the Report. The Inquiry appreciates the constructive manner  </p>
<p>in which all who were engaged in the Maxwellisation process responded. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> In reaching its final conclusions, the Inquiry has considered all representations </p>
<p>received with care. </p>
