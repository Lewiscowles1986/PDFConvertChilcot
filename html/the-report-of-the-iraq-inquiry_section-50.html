<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This section describes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how advice was sought from Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, regarding </p>
<p>the interpretation of UN Security Council resolution 1441 (2002) and the manner </p>
<p>in which that advice was provided;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the events and other influences that affected the timing of the advice;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the written advice provided by Lord Goldsmith in January 2003;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith’s discussions with Sir Jeremy Greenstock, UK Permanent </p>
<p>Representative to the UN in New York, in January 2003, his exchanges with </p>
<p>Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, in early February, and his meeting with </p>
<p>US lawyers in February 2003;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith’s written advice of 7 March 2003; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the legal basis on which the UK ultimately decided to participate in military action </p>
<p>against Iraq; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the presentation of the Government’s legal position to Cabinet and to Parliament </p>
<p>on 17 March 2003.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Finally, this section sets out the Inquiry’s conclusions regarding these events and the </p>
<p>legal basis on which the UK decided to participate in military action against Iraq.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On 9 December, formal “instructions” to provide advice were sent to Lord Goldsmith. </p>
<p>They were sent by the FCO on behalf of the FCO and the MOD as well as No.10. </p>
<p>The instructions made clear that Lord Goldsmith should not provide an immediate </p>
<p>response. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Until 27 February, No.10 could not have been sure that Lord Goldsmith would advise </p>
<p>that there was a basis on which military action against Iraq could be taken in the </p>
<p>absence of a further decision of the Security Council. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice of 7 March set out alternative interpretations of </p>
<p>the legal effect of resolution 1441. While Lord Goldsmith remained “of the opinion </p>
<p>that the safest legal course would be to secure a second resolution”, he concluded </p>
<p>(paragraph 28) that “a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 was </p>
<p>capable of reviving the authorisation in resolution 678 without a further resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith wrote that a reasonable case did not mean that if the matter ever </p>
<p>came to court, he would be confident that the court would agree with this view. </p>
<p>He judged a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 required a further Security </p>
<p>Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At a meeting on 11 March, there was concern that the advice did not offer a clear </p>
<p>indication that military action would be lawful. Lord Goldsmith was asked, after the </p>
<p>meeting, by Admiral Boyce on behalf of the Armed Forces, and by the Treasury </p>
<p>Solicitor, Ms Juliet Wheldon, in respect of the Civil Service, to give a clear-cut answer </p>
<p>on whether military action would be lawful rather than unlawful.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith concluded on 13 March that, on balance, the “better view” was </p>
<p>that the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this case, </p>
<p>meaning that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further resolution </p>
<p>beyond resolution 1441.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on 14 March:</p>
<p>“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution </p>
<p>of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply </p>
<p>with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 and has thus failed </p>
<p>to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council in that resolution. The </p>
<p>Attorney General understands that it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s view that </p>
<p>Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] paragraph 4 </p>
<p>of resolution 1441, but as this is a judgment for the Prime Minister, the Attorney would </p>
<p>be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on 15 March:</p>
<p>“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view that Iraq </p>
<p>is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 [operative paragraph 4] </p>
<p>of UNSCR 1441, because of ‘false statements or omissions in the declarations </p>
<p>submitted by Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure to comply with, and </p>
<p>co-operate fully in the interpretation of, this resolution’.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Senior Ministers should have considered the question posed in Mr Brummell’s </p>
<p>letter of 14 March, either in the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee or a </p>
<p>“War Cabinet”, on the basis of formal advice. Such a Committee should then have </p>
<p>reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its Members were asked to endorse the </p>
<p>Government’s policy.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to Baroness </p>
<p>Ramsey setting out the legal basis for military action. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position – it did </p>
<p>not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take “the final </p>
<p>opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by resolution 1441. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as the advice of 7 March </p>
<p>had done, the conflicting arguments regarding the legal effect of resolution 1441 and </p>
<p>whether, in particular, it authorised military action without a further resolution of the </p>
<p>Security Council. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The advice should have been provided to Ministers and senior officials whose </p>
<p>responsibilities were directly engaged and should have been made available to </p>
<p>Cabinet. </p>
<p><b>UNSCR 1441</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> On 8 November the United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted </p>
<p>resolution 1441 (2002). </p>

<p><b>Discussion, debate and advice, November to December 2002</b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s conversations with Mr Powell and Mr Straw, </b></p>
<p><b>November 2002</b></p>
<p><b>5.  After resolution 1441 was adopted, Lord Goldsmith warned both No.10 and </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Straw that he was “not optimistic” about the legal position for military action </b></p>
<p><b>in response to an Iraqi breach without a second Security Council resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>He offered to provide immediate advice.</b></p>
<p><b>6.  Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, assured Lord Goldsmith that </b></p>
<p><b>his views were known in No.10. The issue would be for consideration in the </b></p>
<p><b>longer term in the event of a report to the Security Council of a serious breach. </b></p>
<p><b>He suggested a meeting “some time before Christmas”.</b></p>
<p><b>7. </b> Lord Goldsmith telephoned Mr Powell on Monday, 11 November and conveyed his </p>
<p>congratulations to No.10 for having secured such a tough resolution.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>“mentioned the possibility of Iraq finding itself in breach of resolution 1441 at some future </p>
<p>stage but with no second Security Council resolution”; a “matter to which he had said he </p>
<p>would give further consideration” following his meeting with Mr Blair on 22 October.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> Lord Goldsmith also mentioned the “Chinese whispers” that had “come to his </p>
<p>attention … which suggested that he took an optimistic view of the legal position that </p>
<p>would obtain if such a situation arose”. The “true position was that he was not at all </p>
<p>optimistic”. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> Lord Goldsmith suggested that “against this background, it was desirable for him </p>
<p>to provide advice on this issue now”.</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Mr Powell noted what Lord Goldsmith said, “but was at pains” to assure him that </p>
<p>“No.10 were under no illusion as to the Attorney’s views” on that point. Mr Powell thought </p>
<p>that as “it was most unlikely that Iraq would not in the first instance accept resolution </p>
<p>1441, this was an issue for consideration in the longer term, in the event that at some </p>
<p>stage in the future we are faced with a breach by Iraq of resolution 1441 and the matter </p>
<p>is referred to the Security Council at that time”. </p>
<p><b>11. </b> Mr Powell proposed a meeting some time before Christmas to discuss the issue. </p>

<p>General and Jonathan Powell – Monday, 11 November 2002’.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>12. </b> Lord Goldsmith told Mr Powell that, in the meantime, he would obtain and consider </p>
<p>the statements made by members of the Security Council when resolution 1441 was </p>
<p>adopted. </p>
<p><b>13. </b> Asked whether he recollected Lord Goldsmith wishing to provide written advice and </p>
<p>being discouraged from doing so, Mr Powell told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“No, he gave written advice – I don’t know if you would call it written advice, he </p>
<p>expressed his opinions …”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“On a number of occasions before 1441 and after 1441, he set out his views in </p>
<p>writing on it, yes.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>14.  Lord Goldsmith told Mr Straw that the key question would be whether Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>non-compliance amounted to a material breach and who was to make that </b></p>
<p><b>determination. </b></p>
<p><b>15.  Lord Goldsmith’s initial view was that, notwithstanding the deliberate </b></p>
<p><b>ambiguity in the language of resolution 1441, the question of whether or not there </b></p>
<p><b>was a serious breach was for the Security Council alone to answer.</b></p>
<p><b>16.  Lord Goldsmith suggested that it would be desirable for him to provide advice </b></p>
<p><b>on the position if, at some point in the future, Iraq “found itself” in material breach </b></p>
<p><b>of resolution 1441 but the Security Council had not adopted a further resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>17.  Mr Straw agreed that formal “instructions” should be prepared asking for </b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s advice. </b></p>
<p><b>18. </b> Mr Straw telephoned Lord Goldsmith on 12 November, suggesting that resolution </p>
<p>1441 “made life easier” for the Government.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>19. </b> Lord Goldsmith agreed that it was an excellent achievement but added that he </p>
<p>would “need to study the resolution, together with the report of the debate and the </p>
<p>statements made”. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> In relation to “the possibility of Iraq finding itself in breach of resolution 1441 at some </p>
<p>future stage” but without a second resolution, Lord Goldsmith reported that he had told </p>
<p>Mr Powell that he was “pessimistic as to whether there would be a sound legal basis … </p>
<p>for the use of force”. Mr Powell had suggested a meeting before Christmas to discuss </p>
<p>the issues. Lord Goldsmith “indicated” to Mr Straw that “he would propose to give a </p>
<p>more definitive view … at that stage”. </p>

<p>3 </p>
<p>Minute Brummell, 12 November 2002, ‘Iraq: Note of telephone conversation between the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary and the Attorney General’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>8</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Straw shared Mr Powell’s view that it was unlikely that Iraq would refuse </p>
<p>to accept resolution 1441. He suggested two particular issues warranted further </p>
<p>consideration:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>First, both France and Russia had insisted that, in the event of an Iraqi </p>
<p>breach, the matter should be referred back to the Security Council for </p>
<p>further consideration before a decision on military action. The “UK’s current </p>
<p>understanding was that it was unlikely that, if it came to a vote, there would be </p>
<p>any veto by France … If there were to be any veto … this was likely to be only </p>
<p>by Russia.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Secondly, Mr Straw would be “interested” in Lord Goldsmith’s views on “the </p>
<p>effect of a resolution being adopted by the House of Commons … following </p>
<p>the contemplated debate on Iraq”. Mr Straw identified two options: a resolution </p>
<p>endorsing 1441 and one including “an acknowledgement that there would </p>
<p>inevitably be military action if peaceful resolution of the issue were not possible”. </p>
<p>His preference was for the former. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s initial view was that, leaving aside the political advantages, </p>
<p>a resolution of the House of Commons:</p>
<p>“… would not have any bearing on the position in international law as regards the </p>
<p>lawfulness of using force against Iraq. It might be that a case could be constructed </p>
<p>seeking to justify such action, if a number of other Parliaments in … countries who </p>
<p>are members of the Security Council were also to adopt such a resolution. But he </p>
<p>thought that … would be a rather subtle and speculative argument.” </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Straw thought that military action was some way further down the track but, </p>
<p>“if Iraq were to be found in breach” of resolution 1441, it would be “essential … we act </p>
<p>pretty swiftly to take military action”. One of the reasons “was that there might well be </p>
<p>a need for less military force if action was swift”. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> Lord Goldsmith “commented that, from the point of view of legality, the key question </p>
<p>would be whether Iraq’s non-compliance with resolution 1441 amounted to a material </p>
<p>breach and who was to make this determination”.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> Mr Straw “pointed out that it was clear to him that the US – despite its bellicose </p>
<p>rhetoric – would not wish to go to war for nothing”. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr Straw “mentioned that, reading resolution 1441 again as a layman, it was pretty </p>
<p>clear that the Security Council were basically telling Iraq – <i>‘Comply or else’</i>.” In response </p>
<p>to Lord Goldsmith’s observation that “the question was who was to decide the ‘or else’”, </p>
<p>Mr Straw pointed out that resolution 1441 could have: </p>
<p>“… said in terms that it was for the Security Council to decide whether there was a </p>
<p>material breach and what action would then ensue. However … [it] did not … France </p>
<p>and Russia had accepted the US/UK argument that this should be left open and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>that, while it was preferable, it was not essential for the Security Council to adopt </p>
<p>a second resolution.” </p>
<p><b>27. </b> Lord Goldsmith told Mr Straw it “seemed implicit” in resolution 1441 that, in the </p>
<p>event of non-compliance, “it would be for the Security Council to decide whether Iraq” </p>
<p>was in “material breach”.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Mr Straw suggested that “the reality was that members of the Security Council had </p>
<p>had to agree and ‘coalesce’ around a particular form of words … to the effect that, if </p>
<p>there were to be a breach, it would be for the Security Council to meet to discuss and </p>
<p>consider what should be done”. That “allowed for ‘a range of possibilities’, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the possibility that there would have to be a second resolution; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the possibility that there might be a general consensus or desire [amongst </p>
<p>the five Permanent Members of the Security Council] for military action,  </p>
<p>but a preference (in particular by Russia) that there should be no second </p>
<p>resolution …” </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Mr Straw again suggested that:</p>
<p>“… it was necessary to look at the negotiating background. For example … </p>
<p>[President] Jaques Chirac had originally insisted on there being a ‘lock’ against the </p>
<p>use of force unless this had been authorised by the Security Council by a second </p>
<p>resolution. But this … did not appear in the resolution … [W]hat France and Russia </p>
<p>were virtually saying was that they understood that there might well be a breach, but </p>
<p>while they would in fact support the need for military action, they would not be able </p>
<p>to support a resolution in terms authorising the use of force.” </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Lord Goldsmith responded that:</p>
<p>“… the position remained that only the Security Council could decide on whether </p>
<p>there had been a material breach (and whether the breach was such as to </p>
<p>undermine the conditions underpinning the cease-fire) and/or whether all necessary </p>
<p>means were authorised. The question of whether there was a serious breach or not </p>
<p>was for the Security Council alone. It was not possible to say that the unreasonable </p>
<p>exercise of the veto by a particular member of the Security Council would be </p>
<p>ineffectual …”</p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Straw “said that there would be a danger in going for a second resolution” </p>
<p>because, “if it were not obtained, then we would be in a worse position”. He “wondered </p>
<p>if there was any alternative option” between a general discussion in the Security Council </p>
<p>and the adoption of a resolution determining a material breach.</p>
<p><b>32. </b> Lord Goldsmith said that it “could be possible for a valid determination to be made </p>
<p>by means of a Presidential Statement”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>10</p>
<p><b>33. </b> Mr Straw and Lord Goldsmith agreed that the “different options should be explored”:</p>
<p>“Mr Straw … would arrange for all the details of the negotiating history … to be sent </p>
<p>to the Attorney General, so that the Attorney could consider further the legal position </p>
<p>in the event that Iraq were (as expected) sooner or later to fail to comply with </p>
<p>resolution 1441 and there were to be no second resolution.” </p>
<p><b>34. </b> On timing, Mr Straw “thought the crunch point” would come soon after 8 December, </p>
<p>the deadline for Iraq to make its declaration on its weapons of mass destruction (WMD) </p>
<p>programmes. There was a “high likelihood/probability that Iraq would produce only a </p>
<p>‘partial declaration’, with the likelihood that soon after … a report of Iraq’s inadequate/</p>
<p>incomplete/inaccurate declaration would be made to the Security Council (pursuant to </p>
<p>OP [operative paragraph] 4)”. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Asked about the conversations with Mr Powell and Mr Straw on 11 and </p>
<p>12 November 2002, Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“There is … I see this quite a lot in government … also the problem that sometimes </p>
<p>the qualifications to what you have said don’t seem to be heard as clearly as you </p>
<p>intended them to be. I have heard the expression about the ‘yes, but’ and the ‘but’ </p>
<p>is forgotten, in another context … [S]ometimes, therefore, you have to shout the ‘but’ </p>
<p>rather harder than you would normally, to make sure it is not forgotten.”</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>36. </b> Asked whether the Chinese whispers came from No.10, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“Wherever the ‘Chinese whispers’ had been coming from, what mattered was their </p>
<p>view, and each time I did say, ‘I want this to be understood’, the response I always </p>
<p>got was, ‘Yes, that is understood’, and sometimes afterwards you wondered if that’s </p>
<p>the way everyone was acting.</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>37. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that the conversation with Mr Straw on 12 November </p>
<p>was the point when it was agreed that he would receive a formal request for advice: </p>
<p>“I think there was an important moment after [resolution] 1441 when I had a </p>
<p>conversation with Mr Straw and I hadn’t at that stage received what I would call </p>
<p>instructions.”</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that barristers work by receiving “instructions”; that </p>
<p>is, a request to advise, including the detail of the question and the supporting materials, </p>
<p>often with the instructing solicitor’s views expressed. He said:</p>
<p>“… until I had had that, particularly the Foreign Office Legal Adviser’s point of view, </p>
<p>and been able to analyse that, I wasn’t really in a position to give a definitive point </p>
<p>of view … So I think there then came this moment when it was agreed that I would </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>47.  Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, did not regard the position that “we </b></p>
<p><b>would know a material breach when we see it” as a suitable basis for planning. </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon’s view was that agreement with the US on what constituted a trigger for </b></p>
<p><b>military action was needed quickly. </b></p>
<p><b>48.  The papers produced before Mr Straw’s meeting held in his Private Office on </b></p>
<p><b>20 November recognised that Lord Goldsmith’s advice would be needed to clarify </b></p>
<p><b>those issues; and that it would be useful to seek Lord Goldsmith’s advice sooner </b></p>
<p><b>rather than later. </b></p>
<p><b>49.  There is, however, no evidence of a discussion about the right timing for </b></p>
<p><b>seeking Lord Goldsmith’s views.</b></p>
<p><b>50. </b> A debate on what might constitute a material breach and what actions by Iraq might </p>
<p>trigger a military response had begun in the US before the adoption of resolution 1441. </p>
<p><b>The concept of “material breach”</b></p>
<p>The concept of “material breach” is central to the revival argument. </p>
<p>Material breach is a term derived from Article 60 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of </p>
<p>Treaties, 1969. In that context a material breach is said to consist in a repudiation of the </p>
<p>treaty or a violation of a provision essential to the accomplishment of the object or purpose </p>
<p>of the treaty. </p>
<p>A material breach of a bilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the other to invoke the </p>
<p>breach as a ground for terminating the treaty or suspending its operation in whole or in </p>
<p>part. </p>
<p>A material breach of a multilateral treaty by one of the parties entitles the other parties </p>
<p>by unanimous agreement to suspend the operation of the treaty in whole or in part, or </p>
<p>to terminate it either in relations between themselves and the defaulting State or entirely. </p>
<p>Resolution 707 (1991) was the first resolution in relation to Iraq to use the formulation, </p>
<p>condemning:</p>
<p>“Iraq’s serious violation of a number of its obligations under section C of </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991) and of its undertakings to cooperate with the Special </p>
<p>Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency, which constitutes a </p>
<p>material breach of the relevant provisions of that resolution 687 which established </p>
<p>a cease-fire and provided the conditions essential to the restoration of peace and </p>
<p>security in the region.” </p>
<p><b>51. </b> On 7 November, reporting conversations with senior officials in the US </p>
<p>Administration, Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington, said that the hawks in Washington saw the resolution as a defeat and </p>
<p>warned that they would be “looking for the least breach of its terms as a justification </p>
<p>for resuming the countdown to war”.</p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>13</p>
<p><b>52. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), subsequently spoke to Dr Condoleezza </p>
<p>Rice, President Bush’s National Security Advisor, on 15 November.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> Sir David stated </p>
<p>that the UK and the US should not be drawn on “hypothetical scenarios” about what </p>
<p>would constitute a material breach. Reflecting Mr Blair’s words to President Bush at </p>
<p>Camp David on 7 September that, “If Saddam Hussein was obviously in breach we </p>
<p>would know”, Sir David added that “the Security Council would know a material breach </p>
<p>when it saw it”. He reported that the US Administration would continue to insist on </p>
<p>“zero tolerance” to keep up the pressure on Saddam Hussein.</p>
<p><b>53. </b> A paper on what might constitute a material breach, which highlighted “a number </p>
<p>of difficult questions … on which we will need to consult the Attorney General”, was </p>
<p>prepared by the FCO and sent to Sir David Manning (and to Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>on 15 November.</p>
<p>11 </p>
<p><b>54. </b> The paper stated that “Most, if not all members of the Council will be inclined” to </p>
<p>take the view that a “material breach” should be interpreted in the light of the Vienna </p>
<p>Convention. Dr Hans Blix, the Executive Chairman of the UN Monitoring, Verification </p>
<p>and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC), had “made it clear” that he would “be using a </p>
<p>similar definition for the purposes of reporting under OP11”. The paper stated that it was </p>
<p>not for Dr Blix to determine what constituted a material breach, “but his decision (or not) </p>
<p>to report to the Council and the terms in which he reports” would “be influential”. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> The FCO paper stated that the US was “becoming more and more inclined to </p>
<p>interpret the 1441 definition downwards” and that: “Although, some weeks ago, NSC </p>
<p>[National Security Council] indicated that they would not regard trivial omissions in Iraq’s </p>
<p>declaration (or minor problems encountered by the UNMOVIC) as triggers for the use of </p>
<p>force, more recently DoD [Department of Defense] have indicated that they want to test </p>
<p>Saddam early.” It also drew attention to President Bush’s remarks on 8 November, which </p>
<p>it described as “zero tolerance” and his warning against “unproductive debates” about </p>
<p>what would constitute an Iraqi violation.</p>
<p><b>56. </b> An examination of past practice on seven separate occasions since 1991 showed </p>
<p>that the Council had determined Iraq to be in material breach of its obligations where </p>
<p>there seemed “to have been a conviction that an Iraqi act would seriously impede </p>
<p>inspectors in the fulfilment of their mandate and therefore undermine an essential </p>
<p>condition of the cease-fire”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>57. </b> Against that background, the FCO listed the following incidents as ones which the </p>
<p>UK would consider to be material breaches:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Any incident sufficiently serious to demonstrate that Iraq had no real intention </p>
<p>of complying”, such as “an Iraqi decision to expel UNMOVIC, or to refuse </p>
<p>access to a particular site, parts of a site or important information”, “discovery </p>
<p>by UNMOVIC/IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] of a concealed </p>
<p>weapons programme, or of a cache of WMD material not declared …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Efforts to constrain UNMOVIC/IAEA’s operations in significant ways contrary to </p>
<p>the provisions of SCR 1441 (2002) … and other relevant resolutions. Systematic </p>
<p>efforts to deter, obstruct or intimidate the interview process would need to be </p>
<p>particularly carefully watched.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Systematic Iraqi harassment of inspectors … which jeopardised their ability to </p>
<p>fulfil their duties …”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Failure to accept resolution 1441.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“A pattern of relatively minor Iraqi obstructions of UNMOVIC/IAEA.” </p>
<p><b>58. </b> On the last point, the FCO paper added:</p>
<p>“We would not take the view that a short (hours) delay in giving UNMOVIC access </p>
<p>to a site would constitute a material breach unless there was clear evidence that the </p>
<p>Iraqis used such a delay to smuggle information out of a site or to coach potential </p>
<p>witnesses. But repeated incidents of such obstruction, even without evidence of </p>
<p>accompanying Iraqi deception, would cumulatively indicate that the Iraqis were not </p>
<p>fully co-operating, and thus cast doubt upon whether UNMOVIC would ever be able </p>
<p>to implement its mandate properly.”</p>
<p><b>59. </b> The FCO stated that a similar US list would “probably … be even tougher”. “Given </p>
<p>the opportunity” in the resolution for the US to make its own report to the Council, the </p>
<p>UK needed “to be clear in our own minds where the dividing lines” were. The paper </p>
<p>recommended that the UK would need to work out “where to draw our red lines” with </p>
<p>the US; and that “in the interests of maintaining maximum Council support for use of </p>
<p>force, we should try to persuade the Americans to focus on the more serious possible </p>
<p>violations, or to establish a pattern of minor obstruction”. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> The FCO did not address the issue of whether a Council decision would be </p>
<p>needed “to determine that Iraq’s actions justify the serious consequences referred to </p>
<p>in OP13 of 1441”. That would be “a matter on which we will need the Attorney’s views”.</p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>15</p>
<p><b>61. </b> An undated, unsigned document, headed ‘Background on material breach’ and </p>
<p>received in No.10 around 20 November 2002, raised the need to address three, primarily </p>
<p>legal, issues: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to clarify whether OP4 “must be construed” in the light of the Vienna </p>
<p>Convention and past practice as that suggested “a much higher bar than the </p>
<p>US”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to seek Lord Goldsmith’s advice “on how OPs 1 and 2 (and 13) and </p>
<p>the declaration of material breach they contain – affect the legal situation of Iraq </p>
<p>and our authority to use force”; and specifically whether it could be argued that </p>
<p>“1441 itself (especially OPs 1, 2 and 13 taken together) contains a conditional </p>
<p>authority to use force … which will be fully uncovered once that Council </p>
<p>discussion has taken place”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What happens if a second resolution is vetoed?”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>62. </b> The document appears to have drawn on the analysis in the FCO paper of </p>
<p>15 November. </p>
<p><b>63. </b> On the second issue, the author wrote:</p>
<p>“If this [the argument that 1441 contains a conditional authority to use force] has </p>
<p>merit (and the most we can hope for in the absence of an express Chapter VII </p>
<p>authorisation is a reasonable argument) it would be helpful to know that now. </p>
<p>We would not have to impale ourselves and Ministers on the difficult point of </p>
<p>what happens if the US/UK try and fail to get an express authorisation.</p>
<p>“… we think London seriously needs to consider revising its thinking on 1441. </p>
<p>“… from the point of view of OP4 the question is ‘What does Iraq have to do to put </p>
<p>itself beyond the protection of the law? At what point does its conduct amount to </p>
<p>material breach?’ Innocent until proved guilty. </p>
<p>“But if you come at it through OPs 1 and 2 the question is ‘When has Iraq blown its </p>
<p>last chance? (regardless of whether OP4 is ever breached)’. Compliance with OP4 </p>
<p>is strictly irrelevant: Iraq is guilty but released on a suspended sentence/parole. </p>
<p>This seems to us to have huge presentational angles – as well as whatever legal </p>
<p>deductions can be made. <b>If we are not careful, we are in danger of losing the </b></p>
<p><b>key advantage of the resolution and turning a provision which we thought of </b></p>
<p><b>deleting as unnecessary into the main operational paragraph of the text …</b>”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>16</p>
<p><b>65. </b> On what would happen in the event of a veto, the author of the document wrote that </p>
<p>it was: </p>
<p>“… probably too difficult [to say] at this stage – everything depends on the circs … </p>
<p>But knowing the answer to the legal implications of 1441 … would either (i) leave us </p>
<p>no worse off than we are – if the AG [Attorney General] thinks the argument doesn’t </p>
<p>run or (ii) radically improve the situation if the AG thinks we have a case.” </p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, commented to </p>
<p>Sir David Manning that the document was:</p>
<p>“… helpful. Of course a S[ecurity] C[ouncil] discussion is needed if there is a material </p>
<p>breach. But as the PM has said all along that discussion must be in the context of </p>
<p>an understanding that action must follow.”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p><b>67. </b> On 15 November, Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary, sent </p>
<p>Sir David Manning an update on military discussions with the US setting out the themes </p>
<p>which had emerged.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> Mr Watkins registered a number of concerns including:</p>
<p>“Lack of clarity in US thinking about possible triggers for military action needs to be </p>
<p>resolved quickly …” </p>
<p><b>68. </b> Mr Watkins added:</p>
<p>“To some extent, triggers are now under Saddam’s control and so cannot be slotted </p>
<p>into any firm timetable. Moreover, what constitutes a ‘violation’ and/or ‘material </p>
<p>breach’ remains undefined: many in the US are reduced to saying ‘we’ll know when </p>
<p>we see it’, which is not a suitable base for planning.”</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Mr Hoon believed that the UK response should include working “quickly to reach </p>
<p>an agreed US/UK view on triggers … well before we are confronted with it in practice”. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> A copy of the letter was sent to Mr Straw’s Private Office.</p>
<p><b>71. </b> Mr Straw held a Private Office meeting on 20 November to discuss Iraq </p>
<p>policy with Sir Michael Jay, the FCO Permanent Under Secretary (PUS), </p>

<p>Political Director.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>72. </b> Sir Jeremy told Mr Straw that he “believed we could get a second resolution </p>
<p>provided the Americans did not go for material breach too early”. The “facts to convince </p>
<p>nine members of the Security Council” would be needed. He thought that the Council </p>
<p>“would not … need much persuading”. </p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>73. </b> Sir Jeremy proposed that “When the time came”, the UK should put down a draft </p>
<p>resolution and, “if we could show that we had done everything possible, then we would </p>
<p>be in the best possible position if – in the end – there were no resolution”. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> Sir David suggested that France should be invited to co-sponsor the resolution. </p>
<p>Mr Straw agreed.</p>
<p><b>75. </b> Sir Jeremy advised that “the real strength” of resolution 1441 lay in its first two </p>
<p>operative paragraphs: OP1 reaffirming Iraq’s material breach up to the adoption of 1441, </p>
<p>and OP2 suspending that material breach to give Iraq a final opportunity. Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>stated that OP4 (and 11 and 12) were, therefore, not needed to reach the “serious </p>
<p>consequences” in OP13. He was already using that argument in the Security Council </p>
<p>and cautioned Mr Straw that focusing too much on OP4 brought a danger of weakening </p>
<p>OPs 1 and 2. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> Sir Michael Jay took a different view, advising that the UK could use all the OPs </p>
<p>in resolution 1441. Mr Straw agreed that it would be a mistake to focus exclusively on </p>
<p>OPs 1 and 2.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Given the reference to “London” and the content of Sir Jeremy’s advice to Mr Straw </p>
<p>in the Private office meeting on 20 November, the unsigned and undated document </p>
<p>‘Background on material breach’ was most probably produced in the UK Mission in </p>
<p>New York.</p>

<p><b>78.  When the House of Commons debated Iraq on 25 November, it voted to </b></p>

<p><b>“to comply fully” with its provisions, “the Security Council should meet in order </b></p>
<p><b>to consider the situation and the need for full compliance”.</b></p>
<p><b>79.  Mr Straw assured Parliament that a material breach would need to be serious.</b></p>
<p><b>80.  Mr Straw’s interpretation was consistent with the advice given to him by FCO </b></p>
<p><b>Legal Advisers, and properly recognised the need for a material breach to be </b></p>
<p><b>sufficiently serious to undermine the basis for the cease-fire in resolution 687 </b></p>
<p><b>(1991). </b></p>
<p><b>81.  But Mr Straw explicitly did not address the role of the Security Council in </b></p>
<p><b>assessing whether any report of non-compliance or obstruction would amount </b></p>
<p><b>to a material breach. </b></p>
<p><b>82.  Mr Straw’s reference to a judgement having “to be made against the real </b></p>

<p><b>83.  As Lord Goldsmith’s subsequent advice confirmed, whether a specific failure </b></p>

<p>17</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Mr Straw’s draft opening statement was sent to No.10 for comment. Mr Powell </p>
<p>questioned two points in the text:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a statement that the UK would prefer a second resolution, which Mr Powell </p>
<p>described as “not our position up to now”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that we didn’t “absolutely need one [a second resolution]”, which Mr Powell </p>
<p>commented would “force the Attorney General to break cover”.</p>

<p>19</p>
<p><b>87. </b> In his opening speech, Mr Straw set out the inspection process and the answers </p>
<p>to four “key questions” which arose from the resolution:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What constituted a material breach? Mr Straw referred to operative paragraph 4 </p>
<p>of the resolution, but went on to say: “As with any definition of that type, it is </p>
<p>never possible to give an exhaustive list of all the conceivable behaviours </p>
<p>that it covers. That judgement has to be made against the real circumstances </p>
<p>that arise, but I reassure the House that material breach means something </p>
<p>significant: some behaviour or pattern of behaviour that is serious. Among such </p>
<p>breaches could be action by the Government of Iraq seriously to obstruct or </p>
<p>impede the inspectors, to intimidate witnesses, or a pattern of behaviour where </p>
<p>any single action appears relatively minor but the actions as a whole add up to </p>
<p>something deliberate and more significant: something that shows Iraq’s intention </p>
<p>not to comply.”</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Who would decide what happened if there was a material breach? Mr Straw </p>
<p>argued that if a “material breach” was reported to the Security Council, “the </p>

<p>will undoubtedly then act.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Would there be a second Security Council resolution if military action proved </p>
<p>necessary? Mr Straw stated: “the moment there is any evidence of a material </p>
<p>breach … there will be a meeting of the Security Council at which it is … open </p>
<p>for any member to move any resolution … Our preference is for a Security </p>

<p><b>FCO advice, 6 December 2002</b></p>
<p><b>88.  The FCO advised on 6 December that there was no agreement in the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council on precise criteria for what would constitute a material breach. Each case </b></p>
<p><b>would need to be considered in the light of the circumstances. </b></p>
<p><b>89.  The UK position remained that deficiencies in Iraq’s declaration on its WMD </b></p>
<p><b>programmes could not constitute a casus belli but if an “audit” by the inspectors </b></p>
<p><b>subsequently discovered significant discrepancies in the declaration, that could </b></p>
<p><b>constitute a material breach.</b></p>
<p><b>90.  The FCO position was, increasingly, shifting from a single specific </b></p>
<p><b>incident demonstrating a material breach, to the need to establish a pattern of </b></p>
<p><b>non-co-operation over time demonstrating that Iraq had no intention of complying </b></p>
<p><b>with its obligations.</b></p>
<p><b>91. </b> In response to a request from Sir David Manning on 29 November, Mr Straw’s office </p>
<p>provided advice on handling the Iraqi declaration.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> The FCO also provided a refined </p>
<p>version of the advice in its letter to Sir David of 15 November about what might comprise </p>
<p>a material breach. </p>
<p><b>92. </b> That was further refined in a letter from Mr Straw’s office on 6 December responding </p>
<p>to Sir David’s request for further advice on what would constitute a “trigger” for action.</p>

<p>Gulf War [1991] cease-fire”. That position had been reflected in Mr Straw’s remarks in </p>
<p>the House of Commons on 25 November. The FCO expected most members of the </p>
<p>Security Council to take a similar view.</p>
<p><b>94. </b> Consistent with the advice sent to Sir David on 15 and 29 November, the FCO </p>
<p>wrote that there were two broad areas where Iraqi behaviour could amount to a material </p>
<p>breach:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Non-compliance with its disarmament obligations</b> – if Iraq concealed WMD. </p>
<p>Evidence might take the form of discovery of WMD material not included in the </p>
<p>declaration or evidence which Iraq could not satisfactorily explain which clearly </p>
<p>pointed to a concealed WMD programme (e.g. a yellowcake receipt). </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Non-co-operation with UNMOVIC/IAEA</b> – if Iraq’s behaviour demonstrated </p>
<p>that it had no intention of co-operating fully with UNMOVIC in fulfilling its </p>
<p>mandate under resolution 1441 (2002) or other relevant resolutions. Evidence </p>
<p>might comprise a single incident such as denying access to a particular site, </p>
<p>information or personnel. Evidence of coaching witnesses or smuggling </p>
<p>information out of potential sites would be “pretty damming”. Attempts to impede </p>
<p>the removal and destruction of WMD or related material would potentially be </p>
<p>a material breach. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> The FCO view was that there would be no need for “a single specific instance”. </p>
<p>A “pattern of lower level incidents” could amount to a demonstration of non-co-operation </p>
<p>sufficiently serious to constitute a material breach. Indications of concealment could </p>
<p>include “a series of unanswered questions identified by UNMOVIC/IAEA which </p>
<p>suggested a concealed WMD programme” or “failure … to demonstrate convincingly </p>
<p>that the WMD material identified by UNSCOM [United Nations Special Commission] </p>
<p>in 1998 had been destroyed and properly accounted for”; “Much would depend on the </p>
<p>circumstances and whether the incidents demonstrated deliberate non-co-operation </p>
<p>rather than inefficiency or confusion.”</p>
<p><b>96. </b> The FCO concluded that there were:</p>
<p>“… bound to be grey areas over whether Iraqi failures are sufficiently serious to </p>
<p>constitute a material breach. There is no agreement in the Council on the precise </p>
<p>criteria. We would need in each case to look at the particular circumstances. </p>
<p>Moreover, some incidents of non-compliance may be susceptible to remedial action </p>
<p>by UNMOVIC/IAEA (e.g. by destroying weapons etc). In such cases, those seeking </p>
<p>to trigger enforcement action would need to explain how such action would be </p>
<p>necessary to enforce Iraqi compliance.”</p>

<p><b>Obtaining Lord Goldsmith’s opinion</b></p>
<p><b>Instructions for Lord Goldsmith to advise</b></p>
<p><b>97.  On 9 December, after receipt of the Iraqi declaration, the FCO issued a formal </b></p>
<p><b>request seeking Lord Goldsmith’s advice on whether a further decision by the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council would be required before force could be used to secure Iraq’s </b></p>
<p><b>compliance with its disarmament obligations. </b></p>
<p><b>98.  Mr Wood set out the “two broad views” on the interpretation of resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441 and whether a further decision was required by the Security Council to </b></p>
<p><b>authorise the use of force. </b></p>
<p><b>99.  Mr Straw asked Mr Wood to make clear to Lord Goldsmith that his advice was </b></p>
<p><b>not needed “now”. </b></p>
<p><b>100. </b> Several drafts of the instructions for Lord Goldsmith were prepared and circulated </p>
<p>within the FCO. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> Mr Wood sought the views of senior FCO officials on 21 November, including Sir </p>
<p>Michael Jay and Mr Iain Macleod, the Legal Counsellor in the UK Permanent Mission to </p>
<p>the UN in New York (UKMIS New York). He also wrote that he planned to give Mr Straw </p>
<p>the opportunity to comment on the draft the following week.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Ms Cathy Adams, Legal Counsellor to Lord Goldsmith between 2002 and 2005, </p>
<p>informed Lord Goldsmith on 29 November that the letter from Mr Wood had “been in </p>

<p>to extensive comments from UKMIS New York”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of FCO UN Department, told the Inquiry that all those </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>22</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Mr Wood’s letter incorporating instructions for Lord Goldsmith was sent to </p>
<p>Ms Adams on 9 December 2002, with a copy to Mr Martin Hemming, the MOD Legal </p>
<p>Adviser.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> It briefly described the provisions of resolution 1441, the history of the </p>
<p>negotiation and adoption of resolution 1441 and subsequent developments, and </p>
<p>the legal background. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Wood wrote: </p>
<p>“The main legal issue raised by the resolution … is whether a further decision by the </p>
<p>Security Council would be required before force could lawfully be used to ensure </p>
<p>Iraqi compliance with its disarmament obligations. (This question is often put in the </p>
<p>form ‘Is a second resolution required?’, but a further decision by the Council could </p>
<p>take other forms, in particular it could be a statement made on behalf of the Council </p>
<p>or its members.)”</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Describing resolution 1441 as a “consensus text” and stating that, “as is often the </p>
<p>case, the drafting leaves something to be desired”, Mr Wood wrote (paragraph 5 of his </p>
<p>letter) that there were two broad views of the interpretation of resolution 1441: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the first was that resolution 1441 “does not authorise the use of force or revive the </p>
<p>Council’s earlier authorisation; a further Council decision is needed for that”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the second was that “taking account of previous Council practice, the negotiating </p>
<p>history and the statements made on adoption”, resolution 1441 “can be read as </p>
<p>meaning that the Council has already conditionally authorised the use of force </p>
<p>against Iraq; the conditions being (a) that Iraq fails to take the final opportunity </p>
<p>if it has been offered and (b) that there is Council discussion (not necessarily </p>
<p>a decision) under paragraph 12 of the resolution. If these conditions are met, </p>
<p>the material breach is uncovered and (on the ‘revival of authorisation’ argument </p>
<p>based on Security Council resolutions 678 (1990) and 687 (1991)) force can be </p>
<p>taken to be authorised under SCR 1441.”</p>
<p><b>The revival argument</b></p>
<p>The UK justification for the use of military force against Iraq in 1993 and in December </p>
<p>1998 (Operation Desert Fox) relied on the concept that the use of force authorised in </p>
<p>resolution 678 (1990) could be “revived” by a Security Council determination that Iraq was </p>
<p>in “material breach” of the cease-fire provisions in resolution 687 (1991). </p>
<p>Resolution 678, adopted on 29 November 1990, demanded:</p>
<p>“… that Iraq comply fully with resolution 660 (1990) [which required its immediate </p>
<p>withdrawal from Kuwait] and all subsequent resolutions”; and</p>
<p>“unless Iraq on or before 15 January 1991 fully” implemented those resolutions, </p>
<p>authorised:</p>

<p>23</p>
<p>“… Member States co-operating with the Government of Kuwait … to use all </p>
<p>necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent </p>
<p>relevant resolutions and to restore international peace and security in the area.”</p>
<p>The resolution stated that the Security Council was “acting under Chapter VII of the </p>
<p>Charter”. Chapter VII is the only part of the United Nations Charter governing the use </p>
<p>of force, and it does so in the context of: “Action with respect to threats to the peace, </p>
<p>breaches of the peace, and acts of aggression.” </p>
<p>After the suspension of hostilities at the end of February 1991, resolutions 686 and 687 </p>
<p>of 1991 contained a number of demands which Iraq had to fulfil in relation to the cessation </p>
<p>of hostilities and the commencement of reparations. </p>
<p>The obligations included provisions in relation to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraq/Kuwait border; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>repatriation of Kuwaiti nationals and property, and the payment of compensation </p>
<p>by Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>sanctions; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disarmament of WMD, and inspections.</p>
<p>It was expressly stated that the authority to use force in resolution 678 (1990) remained </p>
<p>valid during the period required for Iraq to comply with those demands.</p>
<p>In resolution 707 of August 1991 the Security Council condemned Iraq’s serious </p>
<p>violations of its disarmament obligations as a “material breach” of the relevant provisions </p>
<p>of resolution 687 (1991), “which established a cease-fire and provided the conditions </p>
<p>essential to the restoration of peace and security in the region”. </p>
<p>In January 1993, two further serious incidents arose in relation to Iraq’s implementation </p>
<p>of resolution 687 (1991). This led to the adoption of two further Presidential Statements, </p>
<p>on 8 and 11 January, which contained a direct warning of serious consequences.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Within </p>
<p>days the US, UK and France carried out air and missile strikes on Iraq. </p>
<p>In August 1992, Dr Carl-August Fleischhauer, then the UN Legal Counsel, provided advice </p>
<p>to the UN Secretary-General on the legal and procedural basis for the use of force against </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The key elements of Dr. Fleischhauer’s advice included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The authorisation to use all necessary means in resolution 678 (1990) was limited </p>
<p>to the achievement of the objectives in that resolution - “to uphold and implement </p>
<p>resolution 660 (1990) and all subsequent relevant resolutions and to restore </p>
<p>international peace and security in the area” - but was not limited in time; it was </p>
<p>not addressed to a defined group of states except for “the vague notion of ‘states </p>
<p>cooperating with Kuwait’”, and it was clear by the words “all necessary means” that </p>
<p>it was understood to include the use of armed force. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 687 (1991) permitted the conclusion that once the Security Council </p>
<p>was satisfied that Iraq had complied with all its obligations under the resolution, </p>
<p>the authorisation to use force would lapse. But resolution 687 (1991) did not itself </p>
<p>terminate that authorisation, expressly or by inference. That followed from the fact </p>
<p>that the preambular paragraphs (PPs) of resolution 687 (1991) affirmed all the </p>
<p>Security Council’s previous resolutions on Iraq, including resolution 678 (1990). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A cease-fire is by its nature a transitory measure but, during its duration, the </p>
<p>cease-fire superseded the ability to implement the authorisation to use force. </p>
<p>The promise contained in the cease-fire to cease hostilities under certain conditions </p>
<p>created an international obligation, which, as long as those conditions pertained, </p>
<p>excluded the recourse to armed force. Under general international law the obligation </p>
<p>created could be terminated only if the conditions on which it had been established </p>
<p>were violated. In other words, the authority to use force had been suspended, but not </p>
<p>terminated. A sufficiently serious violation of Iraq’s obligations under resolution 687 </p>
<p>(1991) could withdraw the basis for the cease-fire and re-open the way to a renewed </p>
<p>use of force. That possibility was not limited by the passage of time that had then elapsed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Authority to use force could be revived in circumstances where a two-part </p>
<p>pre-condition was met: the Security Council should be in agreement that there was </p>
<p>a violation of the obligations undertaken by Iraq; and the Security Council considered </p>
<p>the violation sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the cease-fire. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those findings need not be in the form of a resolution, but could be recorded in the </p>
<p>form of a Presidential Statement. But the content must make clear that the Council </p>
<p>considered that the violation of resolution 687 (1991) was such that all means </p>
<p>deemed appropriate by Member States were justified in order to bring Iraq back </p>
<p>into compliance with resolution 687 (1991). Under no circumstances should the </p>
<p>assessment of that condition be left to individual Member States; since the original </p>
<p>authorisation came from the Council, the return to it should also come from that </p>
<p>source and not be left to the subjective evaluation made by individual Member States </p>
<p>and their Governments. </p>
<p>In January 1993, two further serious incidents arose in relation to Iraq’s implementation of </p>
<p>resolution 687 (1991), which led to the adoption of two further Presidential Statements on </p>
<p>8 and 11 January.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike resolution 707 (1991) and the Presidential Statements in 1992, in which the </p>
<p>warning of serious consequences had been conveyed in indirect language, the statements </p>
<p>in 1993 contained a direct warning of serious consequences. Within days the US, UK and </p>
<p>France carried out air and missile strikes on Iraq. </p>
<p>On 14 January 1993, in relation to military action on the previous day, the UN </p>
<p>Secretary-General was reported as having said: </p>
<p>“The raid yesterday, and the forces which carried out the raid, have received a </p>
<p>mandate from the Security Council, according to resolution 678 and the cause of </p>
<p>the raid was the violation by Iraq of resolution 687 concerning the cease-fire. So, as </p>
<p>Secretary-General of the United Nations, I can say that this action was taken and </p>
<p>conforms to the resolutions of the Security Council and conforms to the Charter of the </p>
<p>United Nations.”</p>

<p>25</p>
<p>In essence, the statement was an explicit acknowledgement that the authority to use force </p>
<p>in resolution 678 (1990) had been “revived”.</p>
<p>From June 1997, Iraq had begun to interfere with the activities of the UN Special </p>
<p>Commission (UNSCOM), which had been established to monitor Iraq’s WMD. Reports </p>
<p>of Iraqi failures to comply with the obligations in resolution 687 (1991) were made by </p>
<p>UNSCOM to the UN Security Council (see Section 2.2). Several resolutions were adopted </p>
<p>and Presidential Statements were issued condemning Iraqi actions.</p>
<p>In March 1998, the Security Council adopted resolution 1154, stating that the Council was </p>
<p>acting under Chapter VII of the Charter, and stressing the need for Iraq to comply with its </p>

<p>It stated that “any violation would have severest consequences for Iraq”. That resolution </p>
<p>did not, however, make a finding that Iraq was in breach of its obligations. </p>
<p>In October 1998, Dr Richard Butler, UNSCOM’s Executive Chairman, reported to the </p>
<p>Security Council that Iraq had suspended its co-operation; Iraq’s decision to suspend </p>
<p>co-operation made it “impossible for the Commission to implement its disarmament and </p>
<p>monitoring rights and responsibilities”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 5 November, the Security Council adopted resolution 1205, condemning Iraq’s </p>
<p>decision to cease co-operation with UNSCOM as a “flagrant violation” of resolution 687 </p>
<p>(1991) and other relevant resolutions. In the final paragraph of the resolution the Security </p>
<p>Council decided “in accordance with its primary responsibility under the Charter for the </p>
<p>maintenance of international peace and security, to remain actively seized of the matter”. </p>
<p>Diplomatic contact between the UN and Iraq continued, as did discussions within the </p>
<p>Security Council, but on 16 December 1998, the US and UK launched air attacks against </p>
<p>Iraq, Operation Desert Fox.</p>
<p>Mr John Morris (Attorney General from 1997 to 1999), supported by Lord Falconer </p>
<p>(as Solicitor General), advised Mr Blair in November 1997:</p>
<p>“Charles [Lord Falconer] and I remain of the view that, in the circumstances </p>
<p>presently prevailing, an essential precondition of the renewed use of force to </p>
<p>compel compliance with the cease-fire conditions is that the Security Council has, </p>
<p>in whatever language – whether expressly or impliedly – stated that there has been </p>
<p>a breach of the cease-fire conditions and that the Council considers the breach </p>
<p>sufficiently grave to undermine the basis or effective operation of the cease-fire.”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Recognising that “final decisions” could “only be made in the light of circumstances </p>
<p>at the time (including what transpires in the Council)”, Mr Wood addressed the </p>
<p>provisions of the resolution and the rules for their interpretation. As regards the latter, </p>
<p>he wrote: </p>
<p>“The rules for treaty interpretation set out in Articles 31 to 33 of the Vienna </p>
<p>Convention on the Law of Treaties are a useful starting point, but these have to be </p>
<p>applied in a way that takes into account the different nature of resolutions of the </p>

<p>with the ordinary meaning given to its terms in their context and in the light of its </p>
<p>object and purpose.” </p>
<p><b>The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties </b></p>
<p><b>Articles 31-33</b></p>
<p>“ARTICLE 31: GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning </p>
<p>to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and </p>
<p>purpose.</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition </p>
<p>to the text, including its preamble and annexes:</p>
<p>(a)  any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in </p>
<p>connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;</p>
<p>(b)  any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the </p>
<p>conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related </p>
<p>to the treaty.</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>There shall be taken into account, together with the context:</p>
<p>(a)  any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the </p>
<p>treaty or the application of its provisions;</p>
<p>(b)  any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the </p>

<p>work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning </p>
<p>resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the </p>
<p>interpretation according to article 31:</p>
<p>(a)  leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or</p>
<p>(b)  leads to a result which is manifestly absurd.</p>

<p>TWO OR MORE LANGUAGES</p>
<p>When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages the text of each version </p>
<p>is equally authoritative unless the parties to the treaty have agreed otherwise.</p>
<p>The terms of each version are presumed to have the same meaning.</p>
<p>If a difference in meaning should emerge, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, </p>
<p>having regard to the objects of the treaty, shall be the meaning adopted.”</p>
<p><b>109. </b> Referring to a number of telegrams describing the formal and informal negotiation </p>
<p>of the resolution, Mr Wood cautioned:</p>
<p>“If the matter were ever brought to court, none of these records would be likely </p>
<p>to be acceptable as travaux preparatoires</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> of the resolution, since they are not </p>
<p>independent or agreed records, and the meetings themselves were behind closed </p>
<p>doors.” </p>
<p><b>110. </b> Mr Wood set out the arguments relevant to the two broad views of the </p>
<p>interpretation of resolution 1441. For the first, Mr Wood identified the considerations </p>
<p>which suggested that, taken as a whole, the resolution meant that, in the event of </p>
<p>non-compliance, the Council itself would decide what action was needed.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> In relation to the second, Mr Wood wrote: “UKMIS New York are of the view </p>
<p>that this argument is consistent with the negotiating history, and requires serious </p>
<p>consideration”. He set out four supporting points for the second view before identifying </p>
<p>a number of “possible difficulties”. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> Mr Wood concluded: “Whichever line of argument is adopted” it would “still be </p>
<p>necessary” to address what “type of Iraqi non-compliance” would be “of a magnitude </p>
<p>which would undermine the cease-fire”. He also re-stated the governing principles of </p>
<p>necessity and proportionality for the use of force.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> On receipt of Mr Wood’s letter of 9 December, Ms Adams prepared advice for Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith, including a full set of background papers.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Addressing the “two alternative views” on the legal effect of resolution 1441, </p>
<p>Ms Adams wrote that, while Mr Wood did not “say so expressly”, she understood </p>
<p>Mr Wood believed the first view, that resolution 1441 “does not authorise the use of force </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>expressly or revive the authorisation in resolution 678 (1990)”, to be “the better analysis </p>
<p>of the resolution”.</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Commenting on the way in which Mr Wood had addressed the “second view”, that </p>
<p>resolution 1441 had conditionally authorised the use of force, Ms Adams wrote: “I am not </p>
<p>convinced that he puts the arguments in support of this view at their strongest.”</p>
<p><b>116. </b> Setting out an alternative analysis, Ms Adams wrote that “one thing is clearer </p>
<p>following adoption” of resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… the existence of the ‘revival argument’ did not seem to be doubted within the </p>
<p>Security Council. The whole basis of the negotiation … was that the words ‘material </p>
<p>breach’ and ‘serious consequences’ were code for authorising the use of force. </p>
<p>There is now therefore a much sounder basis for relying on the revival argument </p>
<p>than previously.</p>
<p>“… [T]he question of whether resolution 1441 alone satisfies the conditions for </p>
<p>reviving the authorisation in resolution 678 without a further decision of the Council </p>
<p>is far from clear from the text … It is therefore not easy to ascertain the intention of </p>
<p>the Security Council.” </p>
<p><b>117. </b> Ms Adams continued:</p>
<p>“What advice you give … may therefore depend on the view you take as to your role </p>
<p>in advising on use of force issues. For example, you might give a different answer </p>
<p>to the question: what is the better interpretation of resolution 1441? than to the </p>
<p>question: can it reasonably be argued that resolution 1441 is capable of authorising </p>
<p>the use of force without a further Council decision? </p>
<p>“You have previously indicated that you are not entirely comfortable with advising </p>
<p>that ‘there is a respectable argument’ that the use of force is lawful, given your </p>
<p>quasi-judicial role in this area. Previous Law Officers have of course advised in </p>
<p>these terms …”</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Ms Adams concluded:</p>
<p>“For my own part, I think that the first view is the better interpretation, but that the </p>
<p>arguments in favour of the second view are probably as strong as the legal case </p>
<p>for relying on the revival argument in December 1998 when the UK participated in </p>
<p>Operation Desert Fox.” </p>
<p><b>119. </b> Ms Adams wrote that she understood the statement that Lord Goldsmith’s advice </p>
<p>was not “required now” reflected Mr Straw’s views, and:</p>
<p>“While it is certainly true that definitive advice could not be given at this stage on </p>
<p>whether a further Council decision is required (because such advice would need </p>
<p>to take account of all the circumstances at the time, including further discussions </p>
<p>in the Council), there is no reason why advice could not be given now on whether </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>resolution 1441 is capable in any circumstances of being interpreted as authorising </p>
<p>the use of force without a further Security Council decision.”</p>
<p><b>120. </b> Ms Adams added:</p>
<p>“… I think a serious issue for consideration is whether, if you were to reach the view </p>
<p>that resolution 1441 was under no circumstances capable of being interpreted as </p>
<p>authorising force without a further Council decision … this should be relayed to the </p>
<p>Foreign Office and No.10.”</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Observing that “the Foreign Secretary (and other Ministers) have gone beyond </p>
<p>the neutral line suggested … stating that resolution 1441 does not ‘necessarily’ </p>
<p>require a further Council decision”, Ms Adams suggested that if Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>was “not minded” to give advice: “An alternative option … might be for me to reply </p>
<p>to Michael [Wood]’s letter confirming that you do not propose to advise at this stage, but </p>
<p>stressing the need for neutrality in HMG’s public line for so long as you have not advised </p>
<p>on the interpretation of the resolution.” </p>
<p><b>122. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that the instructions set out both arguments </p>
<p>“without expressing a view between them, although I think I knew what view Sir Michael </p>
<p>took about it”.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he had asked Mr Wood to ensure Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>was given a balanced view.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>124. </b> Mr Straw added that, if Sir Michael had thought there was only one view, that was </p>
<p>“what he would have written” to Lord Goldsmith. Mr Straw stated that he:</p>
<p>“… had no input, as far as I recall – and we have been through the records – </p>
<p>whatsoever in what he [Sir Michael] wrote to the Attorney General. Quite properly. </p>
<p>I don’t think I, so far as I recall, ever saw the letter until after it had been written, and </p>
<p>that’s entirely proper.</p>
<p>“If his view had been, ‘There is no doubt we require a second resolution’ … then </p>
<p>that’s what he should have written, but he didn’t.”</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>125. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Pattison wrote: </p>
<p>“With hindsight, the letter … probably steered [Lord Goldsmith] in a particular </p>
<p>direction: although it set out competing interpretations of SCR 1441, it was loaded </p>
<p>in favour of one.”</p>

<p><b>126. </b> Sir Michael Wood disagreed with Mr Pattison’s conclusion: </p>
<p>“This is not so. I set out the arguments as fairly as I could, taking full account of </p>
<p>extensive comments from UKMIS New York.”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Sir Michael wrote in his statement: </p>
<p>“I was instructed … that the Foreign Secretary was content for me to send the letter </p>
<p>provided I did not include in the letter a statement of my own view of the law; and </p>
<p>provided that I made it clear in the letter that no advice was needed at present.  </p>
<p>I was not happy with these instructions …</p>
<p>“There are broadly two ways for a departmental lawyer to consult the Attorney: by </p>
<p>setting out the different possibilities, without expressing a view; or, and this is much </p>
<p>more common and usually more helpful, by setting out the differing possibilities </p>
<p>and giving a view. In the present case, I was instructed to do the former, though the </p>
<p>Attorney was anyway well aware of my views.”</p>
<p><b>128. </b> In the final version of the “instructions” for Lord Goldsmith, Mr Wood wrote: </p>
<p>“No advice is required now. Any decisions in the future would clearly need to take </p>
<p>account of all the circumstances, including any further deliberation in the Security </p>
<p>Council.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>129. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Lord Goldsmith wrote that he had been told that it </p>
<p>was the view of Mr Straw that the instructions of 9 December should make clear that no </p>
<p>advice was needed at that time.</p>
<p>43</p>
<p><b>130. </b> The Inquiry sought the views of a number of witnesses about whether Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith’s advice should have been available at an earlier stage.</p>
<p><b>131. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Sir Michael Wood wrote that he did not agree with </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s view that advice was not needed until later:</p>
<p>“While it may not have been essential to have advice at that time, it was in my view </p>
<p>highly desirable … FCO Legal Advisers were in a very uncomfortable position … </p>
<p>We were having to advise on whether SCR 1441 authorised the use of force without </p>
<p>a further decision of the Security Council without the benefit of the Attorney’s advice. </p>
<p>It would have been possible for the Attorney to have given advice on the meaning </p>
<p>of SCR 1441 soon after its adoption, since all the relevant considerations were then </p>
<p>known, though that advice would no doubt have had to be kept under review in the </p>
<p>light of developments.”</p>

<p><b>132. </b> Sir Michael added that he had explained in a meeting with Lord Goldsmith “as </p>
<p>late as January 2003” that his “position within the FCO was becoming very difficult” </p>
<p>since he was still having to advise Mr Straw and others “without being able to refer to” </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith’s advice, even though he was “aware of his [Lord Goldsmith’s] thinking </p>
<p>at that time”.</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Sir Michael told the Inquiry</p>
<p>:</p>
<p>“… it was certainly a problem for me within the Foreign Office, because I was having </p>
<p>to react to public statements by Ministers, to prepare briefings for people, on the </p>
<p>basis of my views, without having a definitive view from the Attorney, although I think </p>
<p>I know what his thinking was at that time. </p>
<p>“So I think it was a problem in terms of giving legal advice within the Foreign Office </p>
<p>… in the broader sense … it was a problem for government as a whole, because </p>
<p>they really needed advice, even if they didn’t want it at that stage, in order to develop </p>
<p>their policy in the weeks leading up to the failure to get the second resolution.”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>134. </b> Asked what he meant, Sir Michael added:</p>
<p>“I think it was clear to me that the Attorney would give advice when he was asked for </p>
<p>it, and there were various stages when he was not asked for it … [M]y impression </p>
<p>was that there was a reluctance in some quarters to seek the Attorney’s advice too </p>
<p>early.”</p>
<p>46 </p>
<p><b>135. </b> Asked whether it would have helped if his advice had been provided earlier, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he did not think so. He said he had:</p>
<p>“… been at pains, as you have seen, to try to make sure that those who were </p>
<p>moulding the policy didn’t have a misunderstanding about, at least, what my view </p>
<p>might be and I had been involved …”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“My view was, if I thought it was necessary for a Minister to know, I would tell them, </p>
<p>whether they wanted to hear it or not.” </p>
<p><b>137. </b> Asked if he had been involved at the right time in terms of policy development, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith stated:</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I don’t know what difference, if any, it would have made. My own </p>

<p>48</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Asked about whether the legal issues were folded into the developing policy </p>
<p>questions, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“I think in the event that did happen. As you have heard, on two occasions I insisted </p>
<p>on offering a view, even though it wasn’t being asked for, to make sure the policy, as </p>
<p>it were, took account of that.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>139. </b> Ms Elizabeth Wilmshurst, a Deputy FCO Legal Adviser, identified a particular risk </p>
<p>that arose from the lateness of the definitive advice: </p>
<p>“… on the process of obtaining the Law Officers’ advice, it was clearly far from </p>
<p>satisfactory, and it seemed to have been left right until the end, the request to him </p>
<p>for his formal opinion, as if it was simply an impediment that had to be got over </p>
<p>before the policy could be implemented, and perhaps a lesson to be learned is that, </p>
<p>if the Law Officers’ advice needs to be obtained, as it always does for the use of </p>
<p>force issues, then it should be obtained before the deployment of substantial forces. </p>
<p>For the Attorney to have advised that the conflict would have been unlawful without </p>
<p>a second resolution would have been very difficult at that stage without handing </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein a massive public relations advantage. It was extraordinary, frankly, </p>
<p>to leave the request to him so late in the day.”</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Asked if it would have been useful to have had the formal advice of the Attorney </p>
<p>General during the period after resolution 1441 when the Armed Forces were preparing </p>
<p>for military action, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“No. I think what was important for him to do was to explain to us what his concerns </p>
<p>were … Peter was quite rightly saying to us, ‘These are my concerns. This is why </p>
<p>I don’t think 1441 in itself is enough’. </p>
<p>“… [W]e had begun military preparations even before we got the … 1441 resolution. </p>
<p>We had to do that otherwise we would never have been in a position to take military </p>
<p>action. But let me make it absolutely clear, if Peter in the end had said, ‘This cannot </p>
<p>be justified lawfully’, we would have been unable to take action.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>141. </b> Asked if he had any observations on the process by which Lord Goldsmith’s advice </p>
<p>had been obtained, Lord Turnbull, Cabinet Secretary between September 2002 and </p>
<p>September 2005, said: “I can see that it would have been better if this had been done </p>

<p><b>147. </b> Mr Brummell recorded that Mr Powell had sketched out three “possible scenarios”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Saddam Hussein does something very stupid and the weapons inspectors </p>
<p>find some WMD, which leads to a UN … resolution finding material breach and </p>
<p>authorising the use of force.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The inspectors catch out Saddam Hussein in some way but the response of </p>
<p>members of the Security Council is such that there is no second resolution.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“… [T]he US become frustrated with the UN process and decide to take military </p>
<p>action regardless, i.e. without UN support.” </p>
<p><b>148. </b> Mr Brummell wrote that Mr Powell had commented: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“if the US and UK were to decide that military action was justified, the British </p>
<p>Cabinet would be unanimous in their support”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“There would be no question of the UK supporting military action” in the third </p>
<p>scenario; and “it was unlikely that the US would proceed” in the “absence of UK </p>
<p>support”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>military action could start as early as mid-February. </p>
<p><b>149. </b> Mr Brummell reported that Sir David Manning had confirmed that the UK was </p>
<p>pushing for a second resolution and he thought there was a “reasonably good prospect </p>
<p>(i.e. a 50:50 or so chance)” of success. Iraq had also made the “mistake of alienating </p>
<p>Russia” by cancelling an oil contract which “would change the political weather”. </p>

<p><b>150. </b> Sir David had also confirmed that the “basic assumption” was that Dr Blix would </p>
<p>report any evidence of breaches to the Security Council and:</p>
<p>“The SC would then debate whether the reported breaches were serious or trivial. </p>
<p>It would then be for the Security Council, in the light of that debate, to decide what </p>
<p>action should be taken. It was noted that this would suggest that it was expected </p>
<p>that the SC would have to express its view.”</p>
<p><b>151. </b> Mr Brummell recorded that Lord Goldsmith had agreed that the adoption of </p>
<p>resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… which represented a ‘complex compromise’ had been a considerable </p>
<p>achievement. He thought that a key question arose in relation to the interpretation </p>
<p>of OP4 … What could the phrase ‘for assessment’ mean if it did not mean an </p>
<p>assessment as to whether the breach was sufficiently material to justify resort to use </p>
<p>of force?” </p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Brummell also recorded that there would be “a full Cabinet discussion on Iraq </p>
<p>some time in the middle of January, i.e. before the Security Council met at the end of </p>
<p>January”. It had been agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith would be invited to attend Cabinet “for this purpose”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it would be useful for him to speak to Sir Jeremy Greenstock “to get a fuller </p>
<p>picture of the history of the negotiation of resolution 1441”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith “was not being called on to give advice at this stage. But he </p>
<p>would be giving further consideration to all these issues”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it “might be helpful” if Lord Goldsmith “were to discuss a legal advice paper in </p>

<p><b>153. </b> There is no No.10 record of the meeting. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he was concerned about what was meant by </p>
<p>the expression “for assessment” in OP 4, which seemed “to be an essential issue”.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>155. </b> Lord Goldsmith said:</p>

<p>35</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Asked if this request could have been channelled through Ms Adams to the Foreign </p>
<p>Office Legal Advisers, Lord Goldsmith explained:</p>
<p>“There are a number of ways it could have been done, and I’m not sure that the </p>
<p>Foreign Office would have been able to deal ultimately with the US side, but it could </p>
<p>have been.”</p>
<p>57</p>
<p><b>157. </b> Lord Goldsmith said:</p>
<p>“I wasn’t expecting to discuss it with Jonathan Powell. That wasn’t the point. I did </p>
<p>want to discuss that with the Prime Minister, with the Foreign Secretary, who had </p>
<p>been very closely involved in the negotiations, and this was a channel.”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>158. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he wanted to have “from the client, you know, </p>
<p>‘What do you say in relation to certain of these arguments?’”</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he viewed Mr Blair as “ultimately” the client for </p>
<p>his advice.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>160. </b> Asked whether the client was, at that stage, “expressing a view on how soon” the </p>

<p>“I don’t recall. Certainly there wasn’t … any request at that stage for final advice, but </p>
<p>given what I said about needing to understand certain further matters … it obviously </p>
<p>wasn’t going to be then and there.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>161. </b> Asked whether the client was concerned that he should not “come in too soon” </p>

<p><b>163. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that he, Admiral Sir Michael Boyce, Chief of the </p>

<p>Goldsmith’s advice.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> The characterisation of Mr Blair as the client was not “a very good </p>
<p>description of the importance of this advice”.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> In his written statement, Lord Goldsmith cited his telephone call with Mr Powell </p>
<p>on 11 November and the meeting on 19 December as occasions when he had been </p>
<p>“discouraged from providing” his advice.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p><b>165. </b> Asked if he was aware that Lord Goldsmith felt he was being discouraged, Mr Blair </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think it was more that we knew obviously when we came to the point of decision </p>
<p>we were going to need formal advice. We knew also this was a very tricky and </p>
<p>difficult question. It was important actually that he gave this advice. I think the only </p>

<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice of 14 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>166.  As agreed with Mr Powell on 19 December 2002, Lord Goldsmith handed his </b></p>
<p><b>draft advice to Mr Blair on 14 January 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>167.  The draft advice stated that a further decision by the Security Council would </b></p>
<p><b>be required to revive the authorisation to use force contained in resolution 678 </b></p>
<p><b>(1990) although that decision did not need to be in the form of a further resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>168.  Lord Goldsmith saw no grounds for self-defence or humanitarian </b></p>

<p><b>identified by the Law Officers in 1997, of other “exceptional circumstances” </b></p>
<p><b>arising if the international community “as a whole” had accepted that Iraq had </b></p>
<p><b>repudiated the cease-fire, but the Security Council was “unable to act”. </b></p>

<p><b>171. </b> Ms Adams informed Lord Goldsmith on 10 January that a meeting with Mr Blair </p>
<p>had been arranged, at No.10’s request, for noon on 14 January. There would be </p>
<p>a full Cabinet discussion on 16 January and arrangements were being made for </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith to attend. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> Ms Adams told the Inquiry she had prepared a submission analysing the </p>
<p>arguments as she saw them and including her own view, which was essentially the </p>
<p>same as that of Mr Wood. Lord Goldsmith then made comments on it which she adopted </p>
<p>to produce a draft advice.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>173. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice stated that it was “clear that resolution 1441” </p>
<p>contained “no express authorisation by the Security Council for the use of force”.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>174. </b> The revival argument had been relied on by the UK in the past but it would:</p>
<p>“… not be defensible if the Council has made it clear either that action short of the </p>
<p>use of force should be taken to ensure compliance with the cease-fire or that it </p>
<p>intends to decide subsequently what action is required …”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that OP1 contained a finding that Iraq was in material breach </p>
<p>of its obligations, but it was accepted that the effect of the “firebreak” in OP 2 was that </p>
<p>resolution 1441 did not immediately revive the authorisation to use force in resolution </p>
<p>678. In his view:</p>
<p>“The key question in relation to the interpretation of resolution 1441 is whether the </p>
<p>terms of [operative] paragraph 12 … indicate that the Council has reserved to itself </p>
<p>the power to decide on what further action is required to enforce the cease-fire in the </p>
<p>event of a further material breach by Iraq.</p>
<p>“… to answer this question, it is necessary to analyse the terms of resolution 1441 </p>
<p>as a whole …” </p>
<p><b>176. </b> In his analysis, Lord Goldsmith made the following observations:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The references to resolution 678 (1990) and resolution 687 (1991) in preambular </p>
<p>paragraphs 4, 5 and 10 of the resolution suggested “that the Council had the </p>
<p>revival argument in mind” when it adopted the resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The reference to “material breach” in OP1 signified “a finding by the Council of a </p>
<p>sufficiently serious breach of the cease-fire conditions to revive the authorisation </p>
<p>in resolution 678”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “final opportunity” in OP2 implied that the Council had “determined that </p>
<p>compliance with resolution 1441” was Iraq’s “last chance before the cease-fire </p>
<p>resolution will be enforced”.</p>

<p>69 </p>
<p>Minute [Draft] [Goldsmith to Prime Minister], 14 January 2003, ‘Iraq: Interpretation of Resolution 1441’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The first part of OP4, that false statements or omissions in the Iraqi declaration </p>
<p>and failure to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of </p>
<p>resolution 1441 would “constitute a further material breach”, suggested that the </p>
<p>Council had “determined that any failure by Iraq to comply with or co-operate in </p>
<p>the implementation of the resolution will be a material breach”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The later reference in OP4 to a requirement to report that breach “to the Council </p>
<p>for assessment under paragraphs 11 and 12” raised the “key question” as to </p>
<p>whether that was “merely a procedural requirement for a Council discussion </p>
<p>(the stated US/UK position)” or whether it indicated “the need for a determination </p>
<p>of some sort … that force was now justified”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It appeared “to be accepted that only serious cases of non-compliance would </p>
<p>constitute a material breach, on the basis that it would be difficult to justify </p>
<p>the use of force in relation to a very minor infringement of the terms of the </p>
<p>resolution”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Straw had told Parliament on 25 November that a material breach would </p>
<p>need “as a whole to add up to something deliberate and more significant: </p>
<p>something that shows Iraq’s intention not to comply”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If that was the case, “then any Iraqi misconduct must be assessed to determine </p>
<p>whether it is sufficiently serious as to constitute a material breach”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The question then was “who is to make that assessment”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the event of a reported breach, OP12 stated that the Council would “consider </p>
<p>the situation and the need for compliance with all relevant resolutions in order to </p>
<p>secure international peace and security”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Proposals to amend OP12 “which would have made clear that a further decision </p>
<p>was required were rejected”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The previous practice of the Council and statements made during the </p>
<p>negotiation” of resolution 1441 demonstrated that the phrase “serious </p>
<p>consequences” in OP13 was “accepted as indicating the use of force”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> In the light of that examination, Lord Goldsmith identified two critical questions:</p>
<p>“(a)  whether it would be legitimate to rely on the revival argument; and </p>
<p>(b)  what are the conditions for revival.” </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He considered “in relation to OP1” that “a finding of ‘material breach’” </p>
<p>constituted a “determination of a sufficiently serious breach of the terms of the </p>
<p>cease-fire resolution [resolution 687] to revive the authorisation to use for[ce] </p>
<p>in resolution 678”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If OP4 had stopped after the words “breach of Iraq’s obligations”, there “would </p>
<p>have been a good argument that the Security Council was authorising the use </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>of force in advance if there was a failure by Iraq to comply and co-operate fully </p>
<p>with the implementation of the resolution”.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> Considering the words “for assessment under paragraphs 11 and 12”, which </p>
<p>had been added at the end of OP4, Lord Goldsmith observed that they “must mean </p>
<p>something”. He wrote that it was “hard not to read these words as indicating that it is </p>
<p>for the Council [to] assess if an Iraqi breach is sufficiently significant in light of all the </p>
<p>circumstances”. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Lord Goldsmith explained that “three principal factors” had led him to that </p>
<p>conclusion:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The words “for assessment” implied the “need for a substantive assessment”. </p>
<p>The view that OP12 required “merely a Council discussion … would reduce </p>
<p>the Council’s role to a procedural formality, so that even if the majority of the </p>
<p>Council’s members expressed themselves opposed to the use of force this </p>
<p>would have no effect”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was “accepted that” OP4 did “not mean that every Iraqi breach would </p>
<p>trigger the use of force, so someone must assess whether or not the breach </p>
<p>is ‘material’”. It was “more consistent with the underlying basis of the revival </p>
<p>argument” to interpret OP4 as meaning that it was “for the Council to carry out </p>
<p>that assessment”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>He did not find the “contrary arguments concerning the meaning of ‘for </p>
<p>assessment’ sufficiently convincing”. </p>
<p><b>181. </b> While Lord Goldsmith described the fact that French and Russian attempts to </p>
<p>“make it plain” that a further breach would “only be ‘material’ when assessed as such </p>
<p>by the Council” had not been accepted as the “strongest” point in favour of the view that </p>
<p>a determination by the Council was not required, he cautioned:</p>
<p>“But what matters principally in interpreting a resolution is what the text actually </p>
<p>says, not the negotiation which preceded its adoption.”</p>
<p><b>182. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that he did “not find much difference” between the French </p>
<p>proposals and the final text of the resolution. </p>
<p><b>183. </b> Addressing the Explanations of Vote (EOVs) provided when resolution 1441 was </p>
<p>adopted on 8 November 2002, Lord Goldsmith wrote that they “did not assist greatly </p>
<p>in determining the correct interpretation of the text of OPs 4 and 12”. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> Lord Goldsmith concluded: </p>
<p>“… my opinion is that resolution 1441 does not revive the authorisation to use of [sic] </p>
<p>force contained in resolution 678 in the absence of a further decision of the Security </p>
<p>Council. The difference between this view of the resolution and the approach which </p>
<p>argues that no further decision is required is narrow, but key.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>“The further decision need not be in the form of a further resolution. It is possible that </p>
<p>following a discussion under OP12 of the resolution, the Council could make clear </p>
<p>by other means, e.g. a Presidential statement, that it believes force is now justified </p>
<p>to enforce the cease-fire.”</p>
<p><b>185. </b> Addressing the principle of proportionality, Lord Goldsmith emphasised that:</p>
<p>“Any force used pursuant to the authorisation in resolution 678:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>must have as its objective the enforcement of the terms of the cease-fire </p>
<p>contained in resolution 687 (1990) [sic] and subsequent relevant resolutions; </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>be limited to what is necessary to achieve that objective; and </p>
<p> </p>
<p>–</p>
<p>must be proportionate to that objective, i.e. securing compliance with Iraq’s </p>
<p>disarmament objectives. </p>
<p>“That is not to say that action may not be taken to remove Saddam Hussein from </p>
<p>power if it can be shown that such action is necessary to secure the disarmament </p>
<p>of Iraq and that it is a proportionate response to that objective. But regime change </p>
<p>cannot be the objective of military action. This should be borne in mind in making </p>
<p>public statements about any campaign.”</p>
<p><b>186. </b> As he had promised following the meeting on 22 October, when Mr Blair had asked </p>
<p>about the consequences of a perverse or unreasonable veto “of a second resolution </p>
<p>intended to authorise the use of force”, Lord Goldsmith also addressed other legal bases </p>
<p>for military action.</p>
<p><b>187. </b> In her minute of 14 October 2002, Ms Adams had drawn Lord Goldsmith’s attention </p>
<p>to the Law Officers’ advice to Mr Blair in 1997 which identified the possibility that there </p>
<p>could be:</p>
<p>“… exceptional circumstances in which although the Council had not made a </p>
<p>determination of material breach it was evident to and generally accepted by the </p>
<p>international community as a whole that Iraq had in effect repudiated the cease-fire </p>
<p>and that a resort to military force to deal with the consequences of Iraq’s conduct </p>
<p>was the only way to ensure compliance with the cease-fire conditions.”</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Ms Adams added:</p>
<p>“I understand this passage was included in the advice to cover the sort of situation </p>
<p>where the Council was unable to act. But of course the counter view would be that </p>
<p>if the Council has rejected a resolution authorising the use of force, then under the </p>
<p>scheme of the Charter, it cannot be said that force is legally justified.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>41</p>
<p><b>189. </b> In the “lines to take” provided for Lord Goldsmith’s meeting with Mr Blair, </p>
<p>Ms Adams wrote:</p>
<p>“It is impossible to give a firm view on this now. We should certainly not plan on </p>
<p>being able to rely on such a justification. There does not seem to [be] wide support </p>
<p>for military action among the wider international community at present.”</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>190. </b> In his draft advice of 14 January 2003, Lord Goldsmith wrote that:</p>
<p>“In ruling out the use of force without a further decision of the Council, I am not </p>
<p>saying that other circumstances may not arise in which the use of force may be </p>
<p>justified on other legal grounds, eg if the conditions for self-defence or humanitarian </p>
<p>intervention were met. However, at present, I have seen nothing to suggest there </p>
<p>would be a legal justification on either of these bases.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>191. </b> In relation to the “Kosovo Option”, Lord Goldsmith wrote that the UK had been </p>
<p>“able to take action … because there was an alternative legal base which could be </p>
<p>relied on which did not depend on Council authorisation, namely intervention to avert </p>
<p>an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe”. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> Lord Goldsmith did not, however, address whether any other “exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances” could arise which might provide the basis for action against Iraq. </p>
<p><b>193. </b> Lord Goldsmith also addressed the question of whether, in the event that, </p>
<p>“following a flagrant violation by Iraq”, one of the five Permanent Members (P5) of the </p>
<p>Council “perversely or unreasonably vetoed [a] further Council decision intended to </p>

<p>Council authorisation. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that the scheme of the UN Charter clearly envisaged “the </p>
<p>possibility of a P5 veto” and did “not provide that such vetoes may only be exercised on </p>
<p>‘reasonable grounds’”. In those circumstances, he did not believe that there was:</p>
<p>“… room for arguing that a condition of reasonableness can be implied as a </p>
<p>precondition for the lawful exercise of a veto. Thus, if one of the P5 were to veto </p>
<p>a further Council decision pursuant to OPs 4 and 12 of resolution 1441, there would </p>
<p>be no Council authorisation for military action.” </p>

<p>there was some discussion, but he did not think there had been a long discussion:</p>
<p>“The one thing I do recall was that he [Mr Blair] said … ‘I do understand that your </p>

<p><b>197.  Mr Powell proposed that Sir Jeremy Greenstock should be asked to suggest </b></p>
<p><b>alternatives to Lord Goldsmith.</b></p>
<p><b>198.  Mr Blair’s response to Mr Powell indicated that he himself was not confident </b></p>
<p><b>that resolution 1441, of itself, provided a legal basis for the use of force. Mr Blair’s </b></p>
<p><b>response suggested a readiness to seek any ground on which Lord Goldsmith </b></p>
<p><b>would be able to conclude that there was a legal basis for military action.</b></p>
<p><b>199.  Given the consistent and unambiguous advice of the FCO Legal Advisers </b></p>
<p><b>from March 2002 onwards and Lord Goldsmith’s advice from 30 July 2002, that </b></p>
<p><b>self-defence could not provide a basis for military action in Iraq, the Inquiry has </b></p>
<p><b>seen nothing to support Mr Blair’s idea that a self-defence argument might be </b></p>
<p><b>“revived”. </b></p>
<p><b>200. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice stated that:</p>
<p>“It was proposed before Christmas that it would be worthwhile to discuss the </p>
<p>negotiation of the resolution and particularly the genesis of the words ‘for </p>

<p>to come to London for such a meeting.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>201. </b> Mr Powell sent an undated note to Mr Blair advising: “We should get Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock over to suggest alternatives to him.”</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>202. </b> Mr Blair replied to Mr Powell:</p>
<p>“We need to explore, especially (a) whether we c[oul]d revive the self-defence etc </p>
<p>arguments or (b) whether the UNSCR [sic] c[oul]d have a discussion, no resolution </p>

<p><b>203. </b> Asked whether his response to Mr Powell’s manuscript note on Lord Goldsmith’s </p>
<p>draft advice of 14 January was mostly about Lord Goldsmith understanding the </p>
<p>negotiating history, or whether he was keen to find an alternative that might persuade </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith that there was a basis for military action, Mr Blair told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>he thought it was “both”.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>204. </b> Mr Blair added that he thought Lord Goldsmith himself had suggested meeting </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy: </p>
<p>“So in a sense he had already raised that issue … I think I was simply casting about </p>
<p>… I was saying ‘Have a look at this point. Have a look at that’, but the key thing was </p>
<p>indeed that he was to speak to Jeremy.”</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Mr Brummell’s record of Lord Goldsmith’s meeting with No.10 officials on </p>

<p>of resolution 1441”.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>206.  Despite Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice, Mr Blair continued to say in public </b></p>
<p><b>that he would not rule out military action if a further resolution in response to an </b></p>

<p><b>210. </b> Asked whether the Government’s position was that a second resolution was </p>
<p>preferable or, as Ms Clare Short, the Development Secretary, had said, essential. </p>
<p>Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… we want a UN resolution. I have set out continually, not least in the House on </p>
<p>18 December [2002], that in circumstances where there was a breach we went back </p>
<p>to the UN and the spirit of the UN resolution was broken because an unreasonable </p>
<p>veto was put down, we would not rule out action. That is the same position that </p>
<p>everybody has expressed, and I think it is the right position. However … it is not </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>44</p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Blair emphasised that the UN route had been chosen “very deliberately” </p>
<p>because it was “important” that Saddam Hussein was “disarmed with the support of </p>
<p>the international community”. He hoped that the House would unite around the position </p>
<p>that if the UN resolution was breached, “action must follow, because the UN mandate </p>
<p>has to be upheld”. The Government’s position was that a “second UN resolution” was </p>
<p>“preferable”, but it had:</p>
<p>“… also said that there are circumstances in which a UN resolution is not necessary, </p>
<p>because it is necessary to be able to say in circumstances where an unreasonable </p>
<p>veto is put down that we would still act.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>212. </b> In his evidence to the Liaison Committee on 21 January, Mr Blair was asked about </p>
<p>the impact of taking action without a second resolution.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p><b>213. </b> In his responses, Mr Blair emphasised a second resolution would be highly </p>
<p>desirable, but argued that action should not be “unreasonably blocked”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “easier in every respect” if there was a second resolution, but </p>
<p>there could not be “a situation where there is a material breach recognised by </p>
<p>everybody and yet action is unreasonably blocked”. Without that “qualification”, </p>
<p>the discussion in the Security Council was “not likely to be as productive as it </p>
<p>should be”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “highly desirable” to have a second resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be “more difficult” to act without one, but if the inspectors said that they </p>
<p>could not do their job properly or they made a finding that there were weapons </p>
<p>of mass destruction, it would “be wrong” in the face of a veto “if we said ‘Right, </p>
<p>well there is nothing we can do, he can carry on and develop these weapons.’ </p>
<p>… We must not give a signal to Saddam that there is a way out of this … [It] is </p>
<p>best done with the maximum international support but it will not be done at all </p>
<p>if Saddam thinks there is any weakness …” That “would be disastrous”.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Lord Goldsmith was asked by the Inquiry about the timing and substance of his </p>
<p>advice to Mr Blair on the impact of a veto.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>215. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“… I do not think that there was any doubt about my view. I had been clear at the </p>
<p>meeting with the Prime Minister on 22 October 2002, and I provided a written record </p>
<p>of my view in David Brummell’s letter of 23 October 2002. Although I said I would </p>
<p>consider the issue further, the sense that I conveyed was that I would look at the </p>
<p>issue again to see if anything changed my mind. To that end, I did have a discussion </p>

<p><b>216. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s meeting with Mr Blair on 22 October 2002 is described in Section 3.5.</p>
<p><b>217. </b> Asked whether that advice was draft or definitive, Lord Goldsmith wrote: “In one </p>
<p>sense the whole of the advice of 14 January 2003 was draft”, but he “was clear” that, in </p>
<p>relation to the exercise of a veto, “that must have been understood by the Prime Minister”.</p>
<p><b>218. </b> Asked whether that was clear to Mr Blair, Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“I believe so.”</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Asked whether Mr Blair’s words that it was “necessary to be able to say in </p>
<p>circumstances where an unreasonable veto is put down that we would still act”, and </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s later comments</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> during a <i>BBC Newsnight </i>interview on 6 February, were </p>
<p>compatible with his advice, Lord Goldsmith replied: “No.”</p>
<p><b>220. </b> Asked if he was aware of Mr Blair’s statements at the time, and, if so, what he </p>
<p>thought of them, and what action he had taken, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“I became aware at some stage of the statements the Prime Minister made, though </p>
<p>I cannot recall precisely when. I was uncomfortable about them, and I believe that </p>
<p>I discussed my concerns with Jack Straw and my own staff, though I can find no </p>
<p>record of a formal note of any such conversations. I understood entirely the need to </p>
<p>make public statements which left Saddam Hussein in no doubt about our firmness </p>
<p>of purpose. It was more likely that he would co-operate if he thought that there was </p>
<p>a real likelihood of conflict. My concern was that we should not box ourselves in by </p>
<p>the public statements that were made, and create a situation which might then have </p>
<p>to be unravelled.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>221. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair:</p>

<p>whether his view that action could be taken was derived from the use of force </p>

<p>83 </p>
<p>“If the inspectors do report that they can’t do their work properly because Iraq is not co-operating there’s </p>
<p>no doubt … that is a breach of the resolution. In those circumstances there should be a further resolution. </p>

<p>46</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>given that the need to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe would </p>
<p>not provide the basis for action in Iraq, the legal basis on which he thought the </p>
<p>UK would act.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>222. </b> In his statement for the Inquiry, Mr Blair did not address the substance of Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith’s advice that, in the event of a veto, there would be no Security Council </p>
<p>authorisation for the use of force.</p>
<p>86 </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“I never believed that action in Iraq could be on the same legal basis as Kosovo … </p>
<p>So I never raised Kosovo as a direct precedent. However in Kosovo, we had had </p>
<p>to accept we could not get a UN resolution even though we wanted one because </p>
<p>Russia had made it clear it would wield a political veto. So we, not the UNSC, made </p>
<p>the judgement that the humanitarian catastrophe was overwhelming.</p>
<p>“… [I]f it were clear and accepted by a UNSC member that there was a breach of </p>
<p>[resolution] 1441, but nonetheless they still vetoed, surely that must have some </p>
<p>relevance as to whether a breach had occurred, and thus to revival of resolution 678 </p>
<p>authorising force … I was not suggesting that we, subjectively and without more, </p>
<p>could say: this is unreasonable, but that a veto in circumstances where [a] breach </p>
<p>was accepted, surely could not override the consequences of such a breach set out </p>
<p>in 1441 ie they could not make a bad faith assessment.” </p>
<p><b>223. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“I was aware … of Peter Goldsmith’s advice on 14 January … but … I was also </p>
<p>aware that he had not yet had the opportunity to speak to Sir Jeremy Greenstock or </p>
<p>to the US counterparty. </p>
<p>“I had not yet got to the stage of a formal request for advice and neither had he </p>
<p>got to the point of formally giving it. So I was continuing to hold to the position </p>
<p>that another resolution was not necessary. I knew that the language of 1441 had </p>
<p>represented a political compromise. But I also knew it had to have a meaning and </p>
<p>that meaning, in circumstances where lack of clarity was the outcome of a political </p>
<p>negotiation, must depend on what was understood by the parties to the negotiation. </p>
<p>“I knew that the US had been crystal clear and explicit throughout. This was the </p>
<p>cardinal importance of not just including the phrase ‘final opportunity’ which to me </p>
<p>meant ‘last chance’; but also the designation in advance of a failure to comply fully </p>
<p>and unconditionally, as a ‘material breach’ – words with a plain and legally defined </p>
<p>meaning. </p>
<p>“Peter’s view at that time was, because of the word ‘assessment’ in OP4 of 1441, </p>
<p>there should be a further decision. But I was aware that … had been precisely </p>
<p>and openly rejected by the US and UK when negotiating the text. That is why </p>

<p>his provisional advice was always going to be influenced by what was said and </p>
<p>meant during the course of the negotiation of 1441. So I asked that he speak to </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock and later to the US.” </p>
<p><b>224. </b> Asked if he had understood that his answer in Parliament was inconsistent with the </p>
<p>legal advice he had been given, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was making basically a political point. However I accept entirely that there was </p>
<p>an inconsistency between what he was saying and what I was saying … but I was </p>
<p>saying it not … as a lawyer, but politically.”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>225. </b> Asked if he could really distinguish between making a political point and a legal </p>
<p>point when presenting a legal interpretation to the House of Commons, Mr Blair told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I understand that … I was trying to hold that line … I was less making a legal </p>
<p>declaration … because I could not do that, but a political point, if there was a breach </p>
<p>we had to be able to act … throughout this period of time … we were going for this </p>
<p>second resolution. It was always going to be difficult to get it, but we thought we </p>
<p>might …”</p>

<p><b>227. </b> Mr Blair made similar points justifying the position he had taken in his discussion </p>

<p>48</p>
<p><b>231.  Mr Blair’s decision to ask for Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice and his invitation </b></p>
<p><b>to Lord Goldsmith to attend Cabinet suggest that he intended the advice to inform </b></p>
<p><b>discussion in Cabinet on 16 January.</b></p>
<p><b>232.  But Mr Blair did not reveal that he had received Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice </b></p>
<p><b>which indicated that a further determination by the Security Council that Iraq was </b></p>
<p><b>in material breach of its obligations would be required to authorise the revival of </b></p>
<p><b>the authority to take military action in resolution 678. </b></p>
<p><b>233.  As the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith was the Government’s Legal </b></p>
<p><b>Adviser not just the Legal Adviser to Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>234.  There is no evidence that Mr Straw was aware of Lord Goldsmith’s draft </b></p>
<p><b>advice before Cabinet on 16 January, although he was aware of Lord Goldsmith’s </b></p>
<p><b>position.</b></p>
<p><b>235.  There is no evidence that Lord Goldsmith had communicated his concerns </b></p>
<p><b>to Mr Hoon or to any other member of Cabinet.</b></p>
<p><b>236.  Mr Blair’s decision not to invite Lord Goldsmith to speak meant that Cabinet </b></p>
<p><b>Ministers, including those whose responsibilities were directly engaged, were not </b></p>
<p><b>informed of the doubts expressed in Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice about the legal </b></p>
<p><b>basis of the UK’s policy. </b></p>
<p><b>237.  It may not have been appropriate for Lord Goldsmith to challenge the </b></p>
<p><b>assertions made by Mr Blair and Mr Straw, which repeated their previous public </b></p>
<p><b>statements, during Cabinet.</b></p>
<p><b>238.  Notwithstanding the draft nature of his advice, it would have been advisable </b></p>
<p><b>for Lord Goldsmith to have told Mr Straw and Mr Hoon of his concerns.</b></p>
<p><b>239.  Lord Goldsmith could also have expressed his concerns subsequently in </b></p>
<p><b>private. Other than his conversations with Mr Straw in early February, there is </b></p>
<p><b>no evidence that he did so.</b></p>
<p><b>240. </b> Ms Adams’ brief for Lord Goldsmith for Cabinet on 16 January stated:</p>
<p>“In the light of our discussion yesterday, if asked for your views on the interpretation </p>

<p>“you have not given advice”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“you are waiting for further briefing from the FCO before finalising your views </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“it is therefore premature to express a view”; and</p>

<p>49</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“in any event, interpretation of resolution [1441] may be influenced by </p>
<p>subsequent Council discussion following further Iraqi non-compliance”.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p><b>241. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s manuscript comments indicated that he had reservations about </p>
<p>the first bullet point in Ms Adams’ proposed “lines to take”.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>242. </b> At Cabinet on 16 January, Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… he wanted to make the United Nations route work. The inspectors were doing </p>
<p>their job inside Iraq and he was optimistic that they would discover weapons of </p>
<p>mass destruction and their associated programmes which had been concealed. </p>
<p>They needed time to achieve results, including from better co-ordinated intelligence. </p>
<p>If Iraq was not complying with the demands of the United Nations, he believed the … </p>
<p>Security Council would pass a second resolution.”</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> Mr Blair told his colleagues that evidence from the inspectors would make a veto of </p>
<p>a second resolution by other Permanent Members of the Security Council “less likely”:</p>
<p>“Meanwhile, British and American forces were being built up in the Gulf. If it came </p>
<p>to conflict, it would be important for success to be achieved quickly. The [military] </p>
<p>build up was having an effect on the Iraqi regime, with internal support dwindling for </p>
<p>President Saddam Hussein … The strategy remained to pursue the United Nations </p>
<p>course.” </p>
<p><b>244. </b> Mr Blair concluded by telling Cabinet that he would be meeting President Bush </p>
<p>at the end of the month to discuss Iraq, after Dr Blix’s report to the Security Council </p>
<p>on 27 January.</p>
<p><b>245. </b> Mr Straw said:</p>
<p>“… he was aware of anxieties about the possibility of having to diverge from the </p>
<p>United Nations path. There was a good prospect of achieving a second resolution. </p>
<p>Many had been doubtful about achieving the first resolution; in the event, the … </p>

<p><b>247. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“… the strategy based on the United Nations route was clear, although the </p>
<p>uncertainties loomed large and there was a natural reluctance to go to war. It was </p>
<p>to be expected that the public would want the inspectors to find the evidence before </p>
<p>military action was taken. Pursuing the United Nations route was the right policy, but </p>
<p>we should not rule out the possibility of military action without a second resolution. </p>
<p>The priorities for the immediate future were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improved communications, which would set out the Government’s strategy and </p>
<p>be promoted by the whole Cabinet;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparatory work on planning the aftermath of any military action and the role of </p>
<p>the United Nations in that, which should in turn be conveyed to the Iraqi people </p>
<p>so that they had a vision of a better life in prospect; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contingency work on the unintended consequences which could arise from </p>
<p>the Iraqi use of weapons of mass destruction, environmental catastrophe or </p>

<p>51</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock wrote to Sir David Manning on 24 January with his </p>
<p>perspective on the discussion with Lord Goldsmith.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>252. </b> Sir Jeremy recorded that the “central issue” debated was whether the wording </p>
<p>of OP4 “meant that the Council had something substantive to do in the second stage </p>
<p>(viz determining that a breach was material and deciding on consequent action) before </p>
<p>action could be taken on the further material breach; or whether further discussion/</p>
<p>consideration in the Council … sufficed”. </p>
<p><b>253. </b> Sir Jeremy said he had told Lord Goldsmith that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the negotiations had “settled the wording of OPs 11-13 before a draft OP4 was </p>
<p>ever proposed”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>in that “tussle”, the “French/Russians/ Chinese lost (their … EOVs were </p>
<p>indicative in this respect) an explicit requirement for a new decision by the </p>
<p>Council”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France “wanted ‘further material breach, when assessed’, and accepted with </p>
<p>difficulty the final wording. This suggested they saw the difference between the </p>
<p>two”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US had come to the UN “to give the Security Council a further opportunity </p>
<p>to be the channel for action”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “intention of the sponsors was that the fact of a further material breach would </p>
<p>be established in a report from the inspectors”. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> Sir Jeremy had argued that Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice “took insufficient account </p>
<p>of the alternative routes to OP12 … The fact that OP4 was a late addition was an </p>
<p>indication that the route through OPs 1, 2, 11, 12 and 13 had separate validity.”  </p>
<p>There was “no question in the co-sponsors’ minds of … conceding that the Council had </p>
<p>to assess what was a breach”. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> Sir Jeremy’s view was that “the natural interpretation of ‘assessment’ … was that </p>
<p>the Council would assess the options for the next steps … after a material breach had </p>
<p>occurred”. </p>
<p><b>256. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s position had been to argue “the opposite case, that the late </p>
<p>addition of ‘assessment’ … must add something significant”.</p>
<p><b>257. </b> Sir Jeremy identified “an intermediate interpretation, whereby the fact of </p>
<p>the material breach particularly if reported by the inspectors as directed in OP11, </p>
<p>automatically brought the final opportunity to an end”. Sir Jeremy suggested that </p>
<p>“interpretation was … given weight by the absence of clear wording in OP12 on  </p>
<p>the need for a further decision. And it had a close precedent in the US/UK action on  </p>
<p>16 December 1998 …” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>52</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Sir David Manning submitted the letter to Mr Blair, commenting: “To be aware that </p>
<p>Jeremy G[reenstock] is in debate with the AG.”</p>
<p>97</p>
<p><b>259. </b> A copy of Sir Jeremy’s letter was sent only to Lord Goldsmith’s office. </p>
<p><b>260. </b> In a minute to Lord Goldsmith on 24 January, Ms Adams addressed the points </p>
<p>made by Sir Jeremy on the textual arguments; the history of the negotiations; the </p>
<p>precedent provided by resolution 1205 (1998); and references that had been made by </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy to a paper submitted by Professor Christopher Greenwood Q.C., Professor </p>
<p>of International Law, LSE, to the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) in October 2002.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>261. </b> Ms Adams concluded:</p>
<p>“Overall, although I don’t believe that the arguments can all be taken without </p>
<p>challenge, I certainly think they strengthen the case for the second view and make </p>
<p>the balance of view as to which is the better of the two alternative interpretations </p>
<p>rather closer.” </p>
<p><b>262. </b> Ms Adams suggested that Lord Goldsmith “might want to consider” whether he </p>
<p>“would like to put these arguments to Michael Wood”. Although that would “probably </p>
<p>mean disclosing to him your provisional view of the resolution and perhaps even the </p>
<p>draft advice”.</p>
<p><b>263. </b> Ms Adams commented to Lord Goldsmith that Sir Jeremy’s letter to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning “helpfully sets out his view of the arguments, although I don’t think there are </p>
<p>any points which are not covered in my minute of 24 January”.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>264. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s undated minute to Ms Adams, inviting her to draft a note setting </p>
<p>out his views, suggested that he did not share Sir Jeremy’s view that the wording of OP4 </p>
<p>was the “central issue”.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>265. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that Sir Jeremy’s main argument had been that there was </p>
<p>“no need to focus on the words ‘for assessment’ in OP4 because there is a trigger in </p>
<p>OP1 suspended by OP2 but which suspension will be lifted if Iraq ‘fails to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity’”. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that he did “not consider that this argument can in fact work </p>
<p>to create a form of automaticity if the final opportunity is not taken”. He focused on </p>
<p>the fact that OPs 4 and 11 both led to OP12 and the need for the Security Council to </p>
<p>meet “to consider the situation … and the need for full compliance with all the relevant </p>

<p>Security Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security”; and </p>
<p>that the resolution had to be read as a whole. In his view, that meant the Council had </p>
<p>to “consider what is needed in order to secure international peace and security and, </p>
<p>in particular, whether full compliance is necessary”. OP12 required “a determination </p>
<p>by the Security Council of what is now required”.</p>
<p><b>267. </b> Lord Goldsmith also addressed Sir Jeremy’s argument that resolution 1205 (1998) </p>
<p>provided a precedent. Lord Goldsmith wrote that the point was not that the resolution </p>
<p>validated the revival argument; he did not regard the fact that there was “strong evidence </p>
<p>of disagreement of other States with the proposition” as “a matter of concern”. The </p>
<p>question was “not whether such an argument exists but what are the conditions which </p>
<p>attach to its existence”. </p>
<p><b>Mr Blair’s interview on <i>BBC Breakfast with Frost</i>, 26 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>268.  In an interview on 26 January, Mr Blair stated explicitly that failure to </b></p>
<p><b>co-operate with the inspectors would be a material breach of resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>269. </b> In an extended interview on <i>BBC TV </i>’s<i> Breakfast with Frost</i> on 26 January, </p>
<p>Mr Blair set out in detail his position on Iraq.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>270. </b> Pressed as to whether non-compliance rather than evidence of weapons of mass </p>
<p>destruction justified “a war”, Mr Blair replied that he “profoundly” disagreed with the idea </p>
<p>that a refusal to co-operate was of a “lesser order”:</p>
<p>“… if he fails to co-operate in being honest and he is pursuing a programme of </p>
<p>concealment, that is every bit as much a breach as finding, for example, a missile </p>
<p>or chemical agent.” </p>
<p><b>271. </b> Asked whether a second resolution was needed, required or preferred, Mr Blair </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“Of course we want a second resolution and there is only one set of circumstances </p>
<p>in which I’ve said that we would move without one … all this stuff that … we’re </p>
<p>indifferent … is nonsense. We’re very focused on getting a UN resolution.</p>
<p>“… [Y]ou damage the UN if the UN inspectors say he’s not co-operating, he’s in </p>
<p>breach, and the world does nothing about it. But I don’t believe that will happen …”</p>
<p><b>Options for a second resolution</b></p>
<p><b>272.  Intensive discussions on a second resolution took place at the end of </b></p>
<p><b>January. </b></p>
<p><b>273. </b> Ms Wilmshurst wrote to Ms Adams on 27 January with draft texts for two options </p>
<p>for a second resolution, one expressly authorising the use of force, the other containing </p>

<p>implicit authority.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> Ms Wilmshurst wrote that no decisions had been taken on the drafts </p>
<p>and no discussions had begun with the US, but the FCO would welcome any comments </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith might wish to make on the options. </p>
<p><b>274. </b> Ms Adams replied that, having regard to the terms of resolution 1441 and the </p>
<p>previous practice of the Council, Lord Goldsmith considered that “where the Security </p>
<p>Council determines that Iraq had committed a sufficiently serious breach of the </p>
<p>conditions of the cease-fire imposed by resolution 687 (1991)” to revive the authorisation </p>
<p>in resolution 678(1990), an implicit resolution would be sufficient to revive the </p>
<p>authorisation to use force in resolution 678.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>275. </b> The “critical element” was that “there has been a finding, in whatever form, by the </p>
<p>Security Council itself”, and that “A Presidential Statement would also be sufficient”. </p>
<p><b>276. </b> Ms Adams wrote that Lord Goldsmith did not at that stage intend to offer any </p>
<p>detailed drafting comments on the proposed text, “given that it is likely that they will </p>
<p>change in discussions with the US”. </p>
<p><b>277. </b> In relation to the possibility of issuing an “ultimatum”, Lord Goldsmith’s view was </p>
<p>that “would need to be expressed in very clear terms so there is no room for doubt </p>
<p>whether or not Iraq had met the Council’s demands. Otherwise there is a risk of opening </p>
<p>up a debate about whether there is a need for a further determination by the Council that </p>
<p>Iraq had failed to comply with the new ultimatum.” </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Ms Adams recorded that Lord Goldsmith wished to make clear that a second </p>
<p>resolution authorising the use of force “would not give an unlimited right to use force </p>
<p>against Iraq”. Lord Goldsmith considered that any use of force would have to be directed </p>
<p>towards the objective of securing compliance with the disarmament obligations, which </p>
<p>the Security Council had already determined in resolution 687(1991) and subsequent </p>
<p>relevant resolutions were “necessary requirements for restoring international peace </p>
<p>and security in the area”. The use of force would, moreover, have to be limited to what </p>
<p>was “necessary to enforce those obligations, and be a proportionate response to Iraq’s </p>
<p>breach”. </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Ms Adams explicitly stated that Lord Goldsmith’s comments were “made without </p>
<p>prejudice to the separate question … of whether a second resolution is legally required”. </p>
<p>He had also asked to be “kept closely informed of developments” and wished “to have </p>
<p>the opportunity to comment on any draft which is to be tabled for discussion with other </p>
<p>members of the Council”.</p>

<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s advice, 30 January 2003</b></p>
<p><b>281. </b> Ms Adams had written to Sir David Manning on 28 January, recording that Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith had found Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s letter of 24 January “a useful record of </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy’s arguments on which the Attorney is reflecting”; but that Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… would like to make clear, in order to avoid any doubt about his position, that </p>
<p>the purpose of the meeting was to allow the Attorney to hear the best arguments </p>
<p>which could be made in support of the view that resolution 1441 can be interpreted </p>
<p>as authorising the use of force, under certain conditions, without a further Council </p>
<p>decision. The Attorney was therefore principally in listening mode …”</p>
<p>105</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Ms Adams wrote that there was “one point on which Lord Goldsmith would find it </p>
<p>helpful to have further information”. Sir Jeremy’s arguments had relied “heavily on the </p>
<p>negotiating history … and the fact that other delegations sought, but failed to obtain, </p>
<p>certain language in OPs 4 and 12”. Lord Goldsmith wanted to know “if possible, to </p>
<p>what extent other members of the Council were aware of these bilateral discussions </p>
<p>and therefore the significance of the language”. Lord Goldsmith also wished to take up </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy’s suggestion to meet US counterparts, including to “hear their views on what </p>
<p>is necessary in practice to trigger the authorisation to use force”. </p>
<p><b>283. </b> Ms Adams concluded that Lord Goldsmith was conscious that Mr Blair was due to </p>
<p>meet President Bush later that week. The letter stated:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is aware of the Attorney’s provisional view of the interpretation </p>
<p>of the resolution. However, if the Attorney is to consider the arguments of his US </p>
<p>counterparts before reaching a definitive view, he will not be in a position to finalise </p>
<p>his advice this week. The Attorney would therefore like to know whether you see any </p>
<p>difficulty with this and whether the Prime Minister would wish to have the Attorney’s </p>
<p>considered advice before he departs for the US.” </p>

<p>56</p>
<p><b>288. </b> The points made by Sir Jeremy included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the early drafts of what became resolution 1441 “were discussed among </p>
<p>members of the P5, bilaterally, and in extensive and frequent conversations at </p>
<p>Ministerial level”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a text was not finally “agreed by” all members of the P5 until 7 November; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>he had “convened meetings with the non-Permanent Members during </p>
<p>the drafting process to make sure they were aware of developments. </p>
<p>The significance of the proposals for what became OP 4, 11 and 12 were </p>
<p>fully discussed on these occasions.” </p>
<p><b>289.  Despite being told that advice was not needed for Mr Blair’s meeting with </b></p>
<p><b>President Bush on 31 January, Lord Goldsmith wrote on 30 January to emphasise </b></p>
<p><b>that his view remained that resolution 1441 did not authorise the use of military </b></p>
<p><b>force without a further determination by the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>290.  That was the third time Lord Goldsmith had felt it necessary to put his advice </b></p>
<p><b>to Mr Blair in writing without having been asked to do so; and on this occasion he </b></p>
<p><b>had been explicitly informed that it was not needed.</b></p>
<p><b>291.  Lord Goldsmith had made only a “provisional” interpretation of resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441, but his position was firmly and clearly expressed. </b></p>
<p><b>292.  It was also consistent with the advice given by Mr Wood to Mr Straw.</b> </p>
<p><b>293. </b> Despite the message that his advice was not needed before the meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush, Lord Goldsmith decided to write to Mr Blair on 30 January, stating: </p>
<p>“I thought you might wish to know where I stand on the question of whether a further </p>
<p>decision of the Security Council is legally required in order to authorise the use of </p>
<p>force against Iraq.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>294. </b> Lord Goldsmith informed Mr Blair that the meeting with Sir Jeremy Greenstock </p>
<p>had been “extremely useful”, and that “it was in fact the first time that the arguments in </p>
<p>support of the case that there is no need for a further Council decision had been put to </p>
<p>me in detail”. He had “considered carefully” the “important points” Sir Jeremy had made. </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith wrote that he was “preparing a more detailed note of advice” which </p>
<p>would set out his “conclusions in relation to those arguments”. </p>
<p><b>295. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that he had “indicated to Sir David Manning” that he “would </p>
<p>welcome the opportunity, if arrangements can be made in time, to hear the views of </p>
<p>my US counterparts on the interpretation of resolution 1441”. He was “not convinced” </p>
<p>that it would “make any difference to my view”, but he remained “ready to hear any </p>

<p><b>296. </b> Lord Goldsmith concluded:</p>
<p>“… notwithstanding the additional arguments put to me since our last discussion, </p>
<p>I remain of the view that the correct legal interpretation of resolution 1441 is that it </p>
<p>does not authorise the use of military force without a further determination by the </p>
<p>Security Council, pursuant to paragraph 12 of the resolution, that Iraq has failed to </p>
<p>take the final opportunity granted by the Council. I recognise that arguments can </p>
<p>be made to support the view that paragraph 12 of the resolution merely requires </p>
<p>a Council discussion rather than a further decision. But having considered the </p>
<p>arguments on both sides, my view remains that a further decision is required.” </p>
<p><b>297. </b> Sir David Manning commented: “Clear advice from Attorney on need for further </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Asked by the Inquiry why he had written to Mr Blair at that point, Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I discovered that Mr Blair was going to see President Bush again at the end of </p>
<p>January and there was concern again about views being expressed that I had now </p>
<p>been persuaded by Sir Jeremy, so I did send a short minute to the Prime Minister </p>

<p>58</p>
<p><b>303.  The issue that Lord Goldsmith was addressing in his advice to Mr Blair was </b></p>
<p><b>not what the UK’s objective had been in negotiating resolution 1441 but its legal </b></p>
<p><b>effect in the circumstances of early 2003.</b></p>
<p><b>304. </b> Mr Blair referred again to this manuscript comment in his oral evidence when </p>
<p>recalling the No.10 meeting which had taken place on 17 October 2002, “which we then </p>
<p>minuted out, including to Peter”; and his meeting with Lord Goldsmith on 22 October 2002. </p>
<p><b>305. </b> Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“… we had agreed on 17 October that there were clear objectives for the resolution </p>
<p>and those objectives were, I think we actually say this very plainly, the ultimatum </p>
<p>goes into 1441. If he breaches the ultimatum action follows. So this was the </p>
<p>instruction given. I mean, I can’t remember exactly what I said after the 22 October, </p>
<p>but I should imagine I said “Well, you had better make sure it does meet our </p>
<p>objectives …”</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>306. </b> Mr Blair added: </p>
<p>“… the thing that was problematic for me throughout, and it is why I wrote … ‘I just </p>
<p>don’t understand this’ is that the whole point about our instructions to our negotiators </p>
<p>was, ‘Make sure that this resolution is sufficient because we can’t guarantee we are </p>
<p>going to go back into a further iteration of this or a second resolution’.”</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Mr Blair’s meeting on 17 October and the meeting between Lord Goldsmith and </p>
<p>Mr Blair on 22 October are described in Section 3.5.</p>
<p><b>US agreement to pursue a second resolution</b></p>
<p><b>308.  In the meeting on 31 January, President Bush agreed to support a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution to help Mr Blair. </b></p>
<p><b>309. </b> A briefing paper prepared by the FCO Middle East Department on 30 January </p>
<p>described the objectives for Mr Blair’s meeting with President Bush as: </p>
<p>“to convince President Bush that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>our strategy, though working, needs more time;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the military campaign will be very shocking in many parts of the world, especially </p>
<p>in its opening phase (five times the bombing of the Gulf war);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a second UN Security Council resolution (i) would greatly strengthen the US’s </p>
<p>position, (ii) is politically essential for the UK, and almost certainly legally </p>
<p>essential as well;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>we should support Saudi ideas for disarmament and regime change with UN </p>
<p>blessing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US needs to pay much more attention, quickly, to planning on ‘day after’ </p>
<p>issues; and that the UN needs to be central to it.”</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>310. </b> On the legal position, a background note stated:</p>
<p>“There are concerns that a second resolution authorising the use of force is needed </p>
<p>before force may lawfully be employed against Iraq to enforce the WMD obligations </p>
<p>in the UNSCRs. If a draft resolution fails because of a veto (or indeed because it </p>
<p>does not receive nine positive votes), the fact that the veto is judged ‘unreasonable’ </p>
<p>is immaterial from a legal point of view.” </p>
<p><b>311. </b> In the meeting on 31 January, Mr Blair confirmed that he was:</p>
<p>“… solidly with the President and ready do whatever it took to disarm Saddam.”</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>312. </b> Mr Blair said he firmly believed that it was essential that we tackle the threats </p>
<p>posed by WMD and terrorism. He wanted a second resolution if we could possibly get </p>
<p>one because it would make it much easier politically to deal with Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>He believed that a second resolution was in reach. A second resolution was an </p>
<p>insurance policy against the unexpected. </p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Blair set out his position that the key argument in support of a second resolution </p>
<p>must rest on the requirement in 1441 that Saddam Hussein must co-operate with </p>
<p>the inspectors. Dr Blix had already said on 27 January that this was not happening; </p>
<p>he needed to repeat that message when he reported to the Security Council in </p>
<p>mid-February and at the end of February/early March. That would help to build the case </p>
<p>for a second resolution. </p>
<p><b>314. </b> Mr Blair added that there were various uncertainties:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein might claim at the eleventh hour to have had a change of </p>
<p>heart; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>we could not be sure that Dr Blix’s second and third reports would be as helpful </p>
<p>as his first. </p>
<p><b>315. </b> Mr Blair was, therefore, flexible about the timing of the second resolution. The key </p>
<p>was to ensure that we secured it. We had taken the UN route in the expectation that </p>
<p>the UN would deal with the Iraq problem, not provide an alibi for avoiding the tough </p>
<p>decisions. The resolution was clear that this was Saddam Hussein’s final opportunity. </p>
<p>We had been very patient. Now we should be saying that the crisis must be resolved in </p>
<p>weeks, not months. The international community had to confront the challenges of WMD </p>
<p>and terrorism now.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Mr Blair argued that the second resolution:</p>
<p>“… was not code for delay or hesitation. It was a clear statement that Saddam </p>
<p>was not co-operating and that the international community was determined to do </p>
<p>whatever it took to disarm him. We needed to put the debate in a wider context. </p>
<p>The international community had to confront the challenges of WMD and terrorism </p>
<p>now, whether in Iraq or North Korea, otherwise the risks would only increase.”</p>
<p><b>Public statements by Mr Blair, February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>317.  In early February, Mr Blair made public statements implying that the UK </b></p>
<p><b>could take part in military action if a second resolution was vetoed.</b></p>
<p><b>318. </b> In the House of Commons on 5 February, Mr Chris Mullin (Labour) told Mr Blair </p>
<p>that he:</p>
<p>“… could not support an attack on Iraq unless it was specifically endorsed by </p>
<p>a second resolution of the United Nations Security Council.”</p>
<p>119</p>
<p><b>319. </b> Mr Blair responded:</p>
<p>“I have set out my position … on many occasions. Surely, the position has to be </p>
<p>this: if there is a breach of the original United Nations resolution 1441, a second </p>
<p>resolution should issue.</p>
<p>“That was the anticipated outcome. What resolution 1441 says is that the inspectors </p>
<p>go into Iraq, and if they notify the facts that amount to a material breach, a second </p>
<p>resolution should issue. That is why I believe that if the inspectors continue to say, </p>
<p>as they are now, that Iraq is not co-operating, there will be a second resolution. </p>
<p>The only circumstances in which I have left room for us to manoeuvre are those in </p>
<p>which it is clear that the inspectors are finding that Iraq is not co-operating, so it is </p>
<p>clear that Iraq is in material breach, but for some reason someone puts down what </p>
<p>I would describe as an unreasonable and capricious use of the veto.</p>
<p>“I do not believe that that will happen and I hope that it will not, but I do not think </p>
<p>that it is right to restrict our freedom of manoeuvre in those circumstances because </p>
<p>otherwise, the original spirit and letter of resolution 1441 would itself be breached. </p>
<p>I believe and hope that we will resolve this issue through the United Nations.”</p>

<p>61</p>
<p><b>321. </b> During the interview Mr Jeremy Paxman challenged Mr Blair on a number </p>
<p>of issues, including whether Mr Blair would “give an undertaking” that he would </p>
<p>“seek another UN resolution specifically authorising the use of force”.</p>
<p><b>322. </b> Explaining his position on a second resolution, Mr Blair stated that “the only </p>
<p>circumstances in which we would agree to use force” would be with a further resolution, </p>
<p>“except for one caveat”. That was:</p>
<p>“If the inspectors do report that they can’t do their work properly because Iraq is not </p>
<p>co-operating, there’s no doubt that under the terms of the existing United Nations </p>
<p>resolution that that’s a breach of the resolution. In those circumstances there should </p>
<p>be a further resolution.</p>
<p>“… If a country unreasonably in those circumstances put down a veto then I would </p>
<p>consider action outside of that.”</p>
<p><b>323. </b> Pressed whether he considered he was “absolutely free to defy the express will </p>
<p>of the Security Council”, Mr Blair responded that he could not “just do it with America”, </p>
<p>there would have to be “a majority in the Security Council”, and:</p>
<p>“… the issue of a veto doesn’t even arise unless you get a majority in the Security </p>
<p>Council. Secondly, the choice … is … If the will of the UN is the thing that is most </p>
<p>important and I agree that it is, if there is a breach of resolution 1441 … and we do </p>
<p>nothing then we have flouted the will of the UN.”</p>
<p><b>324. </b> Asked if he was saying that there was already an authorisation for war, Mr Blair </p>
<p>responded:</p>
<p>“No, what I am saying is … In the resolution [1441] … we said that Iraq … had … </p>
<p>a final opportunity to comply.</p>
<p>“The duty of compliance was defined as full co-operation with the UN inspectors. </p>
<p>The resolution … say[s] ‘any failure to co-operate fully is a breach of this resolution </p>
<p>and serious consequences i.e. action, would follow’ … [W]e then also put in that </p>
<p>resolution that there will be a further discussion in the Security Council. But the clear </p>
<p>understanding was that if the inspectors say that Iraq is not complying and there is </p>
<p>a breach … then we have to act.</p>
<p>“… [I]f someone … says … I accept there’s a breach … but I’m issuing a veto, I think </p>
<p>that would be unreasonable … I don’t think that’s what will happen. I think that … if </p>
<p>the inspectors do end up in a situation where they’re saying there is not compliance </p>
<p>by Iraq, then I think a second resolution will issue.” </p>
<p><b>325. </b> Asked whether he agreed it was “important to get France, Russia and Germany </p>
<p>on board”, Mr Blair replied, “Yes … That’s what I am trying to get.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>62</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Asked if he would “give an undertaking that he wouldn’t go to war without their </p>
<p>agreement”, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“… supposing in circumstances where there plainly was [a] breach … and everyone </p>
<p>else wished to take action, one of them put down a veto. In those circumstances </p>
<p>it would be unreasonable.</p>
<p>“Then I think it [not to act] would be wrong because otherwise you couldn’t uphold </p>
<p>the UN. Because you would have passed your resolution and then you’d have failed </p>
<p>to act on it.” </p>
<p><b>327. </b> Asked whether it was for the UK to judge what was “unreasonable”, Mr Blair </p>
<p>envisaged that would be in circumstances where the inspectors, not the UK, had </p>
<p>reported to the Council that they could not do their job. </p>
<p><b>328. </b> Asked if the US and UK went ahead without a UN resolution would any other </p>
<p>country listen to the UN in the future, Mr Blair replied that there was “only one set of </p>
<p>circumstances” in which that would happen. Resolution 1441 “effectively” said that if the </p>
<p>inspectors said they could not do their job, a second resolution would issue: “If someone </p>
<p>then … vetoes wrongly, what do we do?”</p>
<p><b>329.  In his evidence to the Inquiry Mr Blair explained the position he had adopted </b></p>
<p><b>in his meeting with President Bush and subsequent public statements. He drew </b></p>
<p><b>the Inquiry’s attention to the political implications of acknowledging publicly the </b></p>
<p><b>legal advice he had been given while there was still an unresolved debate within </b></p>
<p><b>the UK Government.</b></p>
<p><b>330.  Mr Blair also emphasised that he had specifically said that action would be </b></p>
<p><b>taken only in circumstances where the inspectors had reported that they could no </b></p>
<p><b>longer do their job.</b> </p>
<p><b>331. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the main objective of the meeting on 31 January was </p>
<p>to convince President Bush that it was necessary to get a second resolution.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>“was obviously going to make life a lot easier politically in every respect”. Mr Blair added: </p>
<p>“we took the view that that was not necessary, but, obviously, politically, it would have </p>
<p>been far easier”. </p>
<p><b>332. </b> Asked why he had not told President Bush that he had been advised that a further </p>
<p>determination of the Security Council would be necessary to authorise the use of force, </p>
<p>Mr Blair wrote in his witness statement:</p>
<p>“In speaking to President Bush on 31 January 2003 I was not going to go into </p>
<p>this continuing legal debate, internal to the UK Government. I repeated my strong </p>
<p>commitment, given publicly and privately to do what it took to disarm Saddam.”</p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>333. </b> Mr Blair subsequently told the Inquiry that, in the context of trying to sustain an </p>
<p>international coalition: </p>
<p>“My desire was to keep the maximum pressure on Saddam because I hoped we </p>
<p>could get a second resolution with an ultimatum because that meant we could avoid </p>
<p>the conflict altogether, or then have a clear consensus for removing Saddam.  </p>
<p>So I was having to carry on whilst this internal legal debate was continuing and try </p>
<p>to hope we could overcome it.”</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>334. </b> Asked if he had felt constrained in making a commitment to President Bush by the </p>
<p>advice Lord Goldsmith was continuing to give him, Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“No. I was going to take the view, and I did right throughout that period, there might </p>
<p>come a point at which I had to say to the President of the United States, to all the </p>
<p>other allies, ‘I can’t be with you.’ I might have said that on legal grounds if Peter’s </p>
<p>advice had not, having seen what the Americans told him about the negotiating </p>
<p>process, come down on the other side. I might have had to do that politically. I was </p>
<p>in a very, very difficult situation politically. It was by no means certain that we would </p>
<p>get this thing through the House of Commons.</p>
<p>“… I was going to continue giving absolute and firm commitment until the point at </p>
<p>which definitively I couldn’t …”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p><b>335. </b> Mr Blair added he had taken that position:</p>
<p>“… because had I raised any doubt at that time, if I had suddenly said ‘Well, I can’t </p>
<p>be sure we have got the right legal basis’. If I started to say that to President Bush, </p>
<p>if I had said that publicly, when I was being pressed the whole time ‘Do you need </p>
<p>a second resolution, is it essential …?’ … but I wasn’t going to be in a position </p>
<p>where I stepped back until I knew I had to, because I believed that if I started to </p>
<p>articulate this, in a sense saying ‘Look, I can’t be sure’, the effect of that both on </p>
<p>the Americans, on the coalition and most importantly on Saddam, would have been </p>
<p>dramatic.” </p>
<p><b>336. </b> Mr Blair acknowledged that holding that line was uncomfortable, “especially in the </p>
<p>light of what Peter [Goldsmith] had said”.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that President Bush:</p>
<p>“… knew perfectly well that we needed a second resolution. We had been saying </p>
<p>that to him throughout … [W]e had not had the final advice yet …</p>
<p>“… I was not going to … start putting the problem before the President … until I was </p>
<p>in a position where I knew definitely that I had to.”</p>

<p>64</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Mr Blair added:</p>
<p>“If I had started raising legal issues at that point with the President, I think it would </p>
<p>have started to make him concerned as to whether we were really going to be there </p>
<p>or not and what was really going to happen. </p>
<p>“Now I would have had to have done that because in the end whatever I thought </p>
<p>about the legal position, the person whose thoughts mattered most and definitively </p>
<p>were Peter’s, but I wasn’t going to do that until I was sure about it.”</p>
<p>127</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Subsequently, Mr Blair added that it had been “very, very difficult”. He was </p>
<p>answering questions in the House of Commons and giving interviews and:</p>
<p>“… having to hold the political line in circumstances where there was this unresolved </p>
<p>… debate within the UK Government … </p>
<p>“If I had … in January and February said anything that indicated there was a breach </p>
<p>in the British position … it would have been a political catastrophe for us.”</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>340. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that these difficulties explained why he had wanted to get </p>

<p><b>A disagreement between Mr Straw and Mr Wood</b></p>
<p><b>341.  Mr Straw had visited Washington on 23 January and had repeated the </b></p>

<p><b>342. </b> In a meeting on 23 January, Mr Straw and Mr Colin Powell, US Secretary of </p>
<p>State, discussed the inspectors’ reports due to be presented to the Security Council on </p>
<p>27 January, the need to “shift the burden of proof to Iraq”, and the need to ensure that </p>
<p>there were no differences between the US and UK.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>343. </b> In his subsequent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr Straw said that </p>
<p>“the key question was how to navigate the shoals between where we were today and </p>
<p>a possible decision to take military action”.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> The UK would be “fine” if there was a </p>
<p>second resolution; and that it would be “ok if we tried and failed (a la Kosovo). But we </p>
<p>would need bullet-proof jackets if we did not even try”. In response to Vice President </p>
<p>Cheney’s question whether it would be better to try and fail than not to try at all, </p>

<p><b>344.  Mr Wood had warned Mr Straw on 24 January that “without a further decision </b></p>
<p><b>by the Council, and absent extraordinary circumstances”, the UK would not be </b></p>
<p><b>able lawfully to use force against Iraq.</b></p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Wood wrote to Mr Straw on 22 and 24 January about the terms of the </p>
<p>discussions on a second resolution. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Commenting on advice to Mr Straw for his visit to Washington, Mr Wood wrote:</p>
<p>“The Foreign Secretary will know that the legal advice is that a second resolution </p>
<p>authorising the use of force is needed before any force may lawfully be employed </p>
<p>against Iraq to enforce the WMD obligations in the SCRs. If a draft resolution fails </p>
<p>because of a veto (or indeed because it does not receive nine positive votes), the </p>
<p>fact that the veto (or failure to vote in favour) is ‘unreasonable’ is neither here nor </p>
<p>there from a legal point of view. Further, who is to judge what is ‘unreasonable’?”</p>
<p>132</p>
<p><b>347. </b> In his second minute, Mr Wood expressed concern about Mr Straw’s reported </p>
<p>remarks to Vice President Cheney.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Mr Wood wrote that Kosovo was “no precedent”: the legal basis was the need to </p>
<p>avert an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe; no draft resolution had been put to the </p>
<p>Security Council; and no draft had been vetoed. He hoped there was:</p>
<p>“… no doubt in anyone’s mind that without a further decision of the Council, and </p>
<p>absent extraordinary circumstances (of which at present there is no sign), the United </p>
<p>Kingdom cannot lawfully use force against Iraq to ensure compliance with its SCR </p>
<p>WMD obligations. To use force without Security Council authority would amount to </p>

<p><b>353. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“I am as committed as anyone to international law and its obligations, but it is an </p>
<p>uncertain field. There is no international court for resolving such questions in the </p>
<p>manner of a domestic court. Moreover, in this case, the issue is an arguable one … </p>
<p>I hope (for political reasons) we can get a second resolution. But there is a strong </p>
<p>case to be made that UNSCR 678, and everything which has happened since </p>
<p>(assuming Iraq continues not to comply), provides a sufficient basis in international </p>
<p>law to justify military action.”</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Straw sent copies of his letter to Lord Goldsmith and to Sir David Manning as </p>
<p>well as to senior officials in the FCO.</p>
<p><b>355.  Lord Goldsmith reminded Mr Straw of the duties of Legal Advisers and that </b></p>
<p><b>the principal mechanism for resolving an issue when a Minister challenged the </b></p>
<p><b>legal advice he or she had received was to seek an opinion from the Law Officers.</b></p>
<p><b>356. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote to Mr Straw on 3 February stating that he was not </p>
<p>commenting “on the substance of the legal advice in relation to Iraq”, which he would </p>
<p>“deal with separately”, but on the points Mr Straw had made in his letter to Mr Wood of </p>
<p>29 January about the role of Government Legal Advisers. They had already discussed </p>
<p>that issue, but Lord Goldsmith thought it right to record his views. </p>
<p><b>357. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“It is important for the Government that its lawyers give advice which they honestly </p>
<p>consider to be correct … they should give the advice they believe in, not the advice </p>
<p>which they think others want to hear. To do otherwise would undermine their function </p>
<p>… in giving independent objective and impartial advice. This is not to say … that </p>
<p>lawyers should not be positive and constructive in helping the Government achieve </p>
<p>its policy objectives through lawful means and be open-minded in considering other </p>
<p>points of view. </p>
<p>“But if a Government legal adviser genuinely believes that a course of action </p>
<p>would be unlawful, then it is his or her right and duty to say so. I support this right </p>
<p>regardless of whether I agree with the substance of the advice which has been </p>
<p>given. Where a Minister challenges the legal advice he or she has received, there </p>
<p>are established mechanisms to deal with this. The principal such mechanism is to </p>
<p>seek an opinion from the Law Officers.”</p>

<p><b>358. </b> Mr Straw responded on 20 February to Lord Goldsmith’s letter of 3 February, </p>
<p>acknowledging that the substantive issue – Iraq – was being dealt with separately, </p>
<p>and stating:</p>
<p>“For the record, I want to make it completely clear that I fully respect the integrity </p>
<p>of Michael Wood and his colleague legal advisers. I believe that officials always </p>
<p>offer their best advice. At the same time Ministers must be able to raise legitimate </p>
<p>questions about the advice they receive. As far as the implementation of Iraq </p>
<p>UNSCRs is concerned, this is an uncertain area of law. The US, Netherlands and </p>
<p>Australian Government legal advisers all, I understand, take the view that SCR 1441 </p>
<p>provides legal sanction for military operations. The full range of views ought to be </p>
<p>reflected in the advice offered by our Legal Advisers.”</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>359.  Mr Straw, Lord Goldsmith and Sir Michael Wood all conceded that this </b></p>
<p><b>correspondence was unusual.</b></p>
<p><b>360. </b> Sir Michael Wood told the Inquiry why he had felt it necessary to send his note of </p>
<p>24 January:</p>
<p>“It is something I didn’t normally have to do, but I did it quite frequently during this </p>
<p>period. It was because of the statement that he was recorded as saying to the </p>
<p>[US] Vice President [about Kosovo]. That was so completely wrong, from a legal </p>
<p>point of view, that I felt it was important to draw that to his attention … [W]e had a </p>
<p>bilateral meeting at which he took the view that I was being very dogmatic and that </p>
<p>international law was pretty vague and that he wasn’t used to people taking such </p>
<p>a firm position.”</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>361. </b> Sir Michael emphasised that the meeting had been very amicable and that </p>
<p>although it was quite unusual to receive a minute like the one from Mr Straw, he had not </p>
<p>taken it amiss. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> Ms Wilmshurst told the Inquiry that Sir Michael’s view that 1441 did not authorise </p>
<p>the use of force and that a second resolution was required was shared by all the FCO </p>
<p>Legal Advisers dealing with the matter.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was unhappy when I saw that [Mr Straw’s minute of 29 January], not because </p>
<p>I thought it followed that Sir Michael was right and Mr Straw was wrong about the </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>364. </b> Mr Straw submitted a ‘Supplementary Memorandum’ addressing this exchange </p>
<p>before his hearing on 8 February 2010.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p><b>365. </b> Mr Straw wrote that following a “private meeting in mid-January” with Vice </p>
<p>President Cheney:</p>
<p>“… the usual rather cryptic summary of my conversation was issued in a confidential </p>
<p>FCO telegram … Reading this Sir Michael sent me his minute of 24 January which, </p>
<p>with my response, has been the subject of considerable interest by the Inquiry, and </p>
<p>publicly.</p>
<p>“Far from ignoring this advice, as has been suggested publicly, I read Sir Michael’s </p>
<p>minute with great care, and gave it the serious attention it deserved. So much so </p>
<p>that I thought I owed him a formal and personal written response, rather than simply </p>
<p>having a conversation with him.”</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he had “never sent a minute like that before or </p>
<p>since”.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Straw also acknowledged that Lord Goldsmith’s letter of 3 February was </p>
<p>“very unusual”.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> In his view, it had been sent because Lord Goldsmith thought Mr Straw </p>
<p>was “questioning the right of legal advisers to offer me advice”. Mr Straw had told </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith that he was not, and had subsequently put that in writing.</p>
<p><b>368.  Mr Straw explained that his comment to Vice President Cheney about </b></p>
<p><b>Kosovo was about military action in the absence of a Security Council resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>369. </b> Mr Straw’s minute did not address the substance of Mr Wood’s advice on the </p>
<p>Kosovo issue.</p>
<p><b>370. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that Kosovo itself was not a precedent and he fully </p>
<p>accepted the legal basis was different.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> It was relevant “only to this extent, that … there </p>
<p>was an effort made to gain Security Council agreement and that failed, but the military </p>
<p>action went ahead”.</p>
<p><b>371. </b> In his ‘Supplementary Memorandum’, Mr Straw wrote that he had reached the </p>
<p>view that he needed to respond to Mr Wood in writing because he had been “struck </p>
<p>by the categorical nature of the advice … and its contrast with the very balanced and </p>

<p>detailed advice the same Legal Adviser had proffered to the Attorney General”.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> It was </p>
<p>“incorrect to claim that there was ‘no doubt’ about the position” because two views had </p>
<p>been set out in Mr Wood’s letter of instructions to Lord Goldsmith on 9 December 2002 </p>
<p>and the issue “was at the heart of the debate on lawfulness”. That, “In turn and in part … </p>
<p>depended on the ‘negotiating history’”, of the resolution. </p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr Straw subsequently told the Inquiry that, if Mr Wood had thought there was </p>
<p>“no doubt”, that was what he should have written in the instructions to Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>of 9 December.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> The purposes of that document and Mr Wood’s minute of 24 January </p>
<p>“were the same, to offer legal advice and … the legal advice he had offered … was </p>
<p>contradictory”. In Mr Straw’s view he was “entitled to raise that”.</p>
<p><b>373.  The evidence set out in this Report demonstrates that Mr Wood fully </b></p>
<p><b>understood that Lord Goldsmith’s response to the letter of instruction of </b></p>
<p><b>9 December 2002 would provide the determinative view on the points at issue </b></p>
<p><b>and he was not seeking to usurp that position. </b></p>
<p><b>374.  Mr Wood had referred to the need to seek Lord Goldsmith’s advice on </b></p>
<p><b>several previous occasions and it should not have been necessary to reiterate </b></p>
<p><b>the point in every minute to Mr Straw.</b></p>
<p><b>375.  Until Lord Goldsmith had reached his definitive view, FCO Legal Advisers </b></p>
<p><b>had a duty to draw the attention of Ministers to potential legal risks; and Lord </b></p>
<p><b>Goldsmith’s minute of 3 February confirmed that duty.</b></p>
<p><b>376.  Mr Wood’s advice to Mr Straw was fully consistent with views previously </b></p>
<p><b>expressed by Lord Goldsmith. </b></p>
<p><b>377.  Lord Goldsmith’s response, insisting on the duty of Government lawyers to </b></p>
<p><b>provide frank, honest and, if necessary, unwelcome legal advice without fear of </b></p>
<p><b>rebuke from Ministers, was timely and justified.</b></p>
<p><b>378. </b> In his ‘Supplementary Memorandum’, Mr Straw wrote that the:</p>
<p>“… decision was one for the Attorney General alone – a fact to which no reference </p>
<p>was made nor qualification offered in the Legal Adviser’s minute to me …”</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>379. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“It would surely be a novel, and fundamentally flawed, constitutional doctrine that a </p>
<p>Minister was bound to accept any advice offered … by a Departmental Legal Adviser </p>
<p>as determinative of an issue, if there were reasonable grounds for taking a contrary </p>
<p>view. Such a doctrine would wholly undermine the principles of personal Ministerial </p>
<p>responsibility and give inappropriate power to a Department’s Legal Advisers.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>380. </b> In the subsequent hearing, Mr Straw told the Inquiry he had responded to Mr Wood </p>
<p>because: </p>
<p>“… where I disagreed with him was that he had the right over and above the </p>
<p>Attorney General to say what was or was not unlawful … it is a most extraordinary </p>
<p>constitutional doctrine that, in the absence of a decision by the Attorney General </p>
<p>about what was or was not lawful, that a Departmental Legal Adviser is able to say </p>
<p>what is or is not unlawful.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>381. </b> Mr Straw added: </p>
<p>“But in the absence of a decision by the Attorney General … there has to be doubt. </p>
<p>That was what I thought was strange, and, as I say, he is fully entitled to send me </p>
<p>the note. I never challenged his right to do that, and if I may say so, there is some </p>
<p>suggestion in the notes that I ignored the advice. I never ignore advice. I gave it the </p>
<p>most careful attention.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Sir Franklin Berman, Sir Michael Wood’s predecessor as the FCO Legal Adviser, </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“I have to confess (once again) to some astonishment at seeing a former Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary implying in recent evidence to the Inquiry that he was not bound by legal </p>
<p>advice given to him at the highest level, but was entitled to weigh it off against other </p>
<p>legal views as the basis for policy formulation. If Ministers begin to think that they </p>
<p>can shop around until they discover the most convenient legal view, without regard </p>
<p>to its authority, that is a recipe for chaos.”</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>383.  As Lord Goldsmith remarked in his letter of 3 February, the remedy in case </b></p>
<p><b>of dispute was to ask for his opinion, but he did not at that stage have Mr Blair’s </b></p>
<p><b>agreement to share his draft views.</b></p>
<p><b>384.  Mr Straw’s evidence makes clear his concern that Lord Goldsmith should </b></p>
<p><b>not at that stage take a definitive view without fully considering the alternative </b></p>
<p><b>interpretation advocated by Mr Straw and set out in his letter of 6 February 2003. </b></p>
<p><b>385. </b> The balance of the evidence set out later in this Section suggests that neither </p>
<p>Mr Straw nor Mr Wood had, by 29 January, seen Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice of </p>
<p>14 January.</p>
<p><b>386. </b> In his ‘Supplementary Memorandum’ Mr Straw pointed out “the huge difference </p>
<p>between the normal run of the mill legal advice on usual issues and legal advice on </p>
<p>whether it was legal for the United Kingdom to take military action”.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> That was “why, </p>
<p>on all sides, this issue was so sensitive”. </p>

<p>71</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Mr Straw added that he “had an intense appreciation” of the negotiating history </p>
<p>of resolution 1441 and “an acute understanding” of what France, Russia and China had </p>
<p>said in their EOVs and the subsequent Ministerial meetings of the Security Council and </p>
<p>“crucially – what they had not said”. That needed to be “weighed in the balance before </p>
<p>a decision”.</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Mr Straw wrote:</p>
<p>“Once the Attorney General had uttered on this question, that would have been the </p>
<p>end of the matter; as on any other similar legal question. It would be wholly improper </p>
<p>of any Minister to challenge, or not accept, such an Attorney General decision, </p>
<p>whatever it was. But we were not at that stage.”</p>
<p><b>389. </b> The Inquiry asked a number of witnesses to comment on Mr Straw’s assertion that </p>
<p>international law was an uncertain field and there was no international court to decide </p>
<p>matters. </p>
<p><b>390. </b> Mr Straw emphasised that it meant the responsibility rested on Lord Goldsmith’s </p>
<p>shoulders.</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Addressing that point, Sir Michael Wood told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… he is somehow implying that one can therefore be more flexible, and that </p>
<p>I think is probably the opposite of the case … because there is no court, the Legal </p>
<p>Adviser and those taking decisions based on legal advice have to be all the more </p>
<p>scrupulous in adhering to the law … It is one thing for a lawyer to say, ‘Well, there </p>
<p>is an argument here. Have a go. A court, a judge, will decide in the end’. It is quite </p>
<p>different in the international system where that’s usually not the case. You have </p>
<p>a duty to the law, a duty to the system. You are setting precedents by the very fact </p>
<p>of saying and doing things.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>392. </b> Ms Wilmshurst took a similar view: “I think that, simply because there are no </p>
<p>courts, it ought to make one more cautious about trying to keep within the law, not </p>
<p>less.”</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>393. </b> On the question of whether international law was an uncertain field, Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>stated:</p>
<p>“I didn’t really agree with what he was saying about that. There obviously are areas </p>
<p>of international law which are uncertain, but this particular issue, at the end of the </p>
<p>day, was: what does this resolution mean?”</p>

<p><b>394. </b> In his ‘Supplementary Memorandum’, Mr Straw wrote: </p>
<p>“In this area of international law, recourse to the courts is not available. This means </p>
<p>that international law must be inherently less certain, and that, given the seriousness </p>
<p>of the issues, great care has to be taken in coming to a view. But the absence of </p>
<p>an external tribunal means that a view has in the end to be taken by the Attorney </p>
<p>General, on whose shoulders rests a great weight of responsibility.”</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>395. </b> Asked whether there was a responsibility to be “all the more scrupulous in adhering </p>
<p>to the law” in circumstances where there was no court with jurisdiction to rule on the use </p>
<p>of force in Iraq, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. You have to be extremely scrupulous because it is a decision which </p>
<p>is made internally without external determination … but that’s a very separate point </p>
<p>from saying that … the correct view is on one side rather than the other. The correct </p>
<p>view was the correct view.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Straw’s letter to Lord Goldsmith, 6 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>396.  In a letter of 6 February, Mr Straw took issue with a number of the provisional </b></p>
<p><b>conclusions in Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice of 14 January. </b></p>
<p><b>397.  Mr Straw attached great importance to concessions made by France, Russia </b></p>
<p><b>and China (which he described as a defeat for them).</b></p>
<p><b>398.  But Mr Straw dismissed concessions made by the UK and the US as a </b></p>
<p><b>trade-off which merely offered other members of the Security Council “some </b></p>
<p><b>procedural comfort”. </b></p>
<p><b>399.  That considerably understated the importance of the concessions by all </b></p>
<p><b>members of the P5 to create sufficient ambiguity about the meaning of the </b></p>
<p><b>resolution to command consensus in the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>400.  The UK had explicitly recognised during the negotiation of resolution </b></p>
<p><b>1441 that the inclusion of a provision for the Security Council to “consider” a </b></p>

<p><b>402. </b> A minute from Ms Adams to Lord Goldsmith, in preparation for a meeting with </p>

<p>157</p>
<p> </p>

<p>several attempts. We do not therefore know whether No.10 is content for you to </p>
<p>pass your draft advice to the Foreign Secretary.”</p>
<p><b>404. </b> There is no record of the meeting on 3 February. There was no copy of Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith’s minute to Mr Blair of 30 January in the papers provided by the FCO to the </p>

<p><b>405. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office sent Mr Brummell, “as promised”, the draft of a letter from </p>
<p>Mr Straw to Lord Goldsmith on 4 February.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> The letter was also sent to Sir Christopher </p>
<p>Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, Sir David Manning and Mr Powell. </p>

<p>that he had been asked by Lord Goldsmith in the last week of January if he had seen </p>

<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Straw had seen Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice, but he:</p>
<p>“… had not had a chance to study it in detail. This I have now done. I would be very </p>
<p>grateful if you would carefully consider my comments below before coming to a </p>
<p>final conclusion and I would appreciate a conversation with you as well. As you will </p>
<p>be aware I was immersed in the line-by-line negotiations of the resolution, much of </p>
<p>which was conducted capital to capital with P5 Foreign Ministers.” </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Mr Straw continued:</p>
<p>“It goes without saying that a unanimous and express Security Council authorisation </p>
<p>would be the safest basis for the use of force against Iraq. But I have doubts about </p>
<p>the negotiability of this in current circumstances. We are likely to have to go for </p>
<p>something less. You will know the UK attaches high priority to achieving a second </p>
<p>resolution for domestic policy reasons and to ensure wide international support for </p>
<p>any military action. This was the case the Prime Minister was making in Washington </p>
<p>[on 31 January]. We are working hard to achieve it.” </p>
<p><b>409. </b> Referring to his minute to Mr Wood of 29 January, Mr Straw stated that he “had </p>

<p>that the less certain the law is, the more certain in their views they become”.</p>

<p><b>410. </b> Mr Straw wrote: </p>
<p>“Jeremy Greenstock has given you the negotiating history of OP4 and of how the </p>
<p>words ‘for assessment’ were included. It is crucial to emphasise, as Jeremy spelt </p>
<p>out, that the overwhelming issue between US/UK and the French/Russians/Chinese </p>
<p>(F/R/C) was whether a second resolution was required to authorise any use of </p>
<p>force or not. As Jeremy told you the F/R/C lost on this, and they knew they had lost. </p>
<p>To achieve this, however, we had to show that the discussions on the first resolution </p>
<p>would not be the end of the matter. So the trade-off … for the F/R/C defeat on the </p>
<p>substantive issue of a second resolution was some procedural comfort – provided in </p>
<p>OPs 4, 11 and 12. If there were a further material breach this would be “reported to </p>
<p>the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 below …” </p>
<p><b>411. </b> Addressing Lord Goldsmith’s view that he did not “find much difference” between </p>
<p>the French text and the final wording of OP4, Mr Straw stated that there was “all the </p>
<p>difference in the world”. The French text</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> “would have given the Security Council … the </p>
<p>exclusive right to determine whether there had been an OP4 further material breach”. </p>
<p>The US and UK had resisted that. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> Mr Straw also challenged Lord Goldsmith’s view that the Council “must” assess </p>
<p>whether a breach was material. That was “to ignore both the negotiating history and the </p>
<p>wording. We were deliberate in not specifying who would determine that there had been </p>
<p>a material breach.”</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Addressing the meaning of the term “for assessment”, Mr Straw wrote that OP4 </p>
<p>itself offered “meaning by the following words ‘in accordance with paragraphs 11 </p>
<p>and 12 below’.” OP12 provided that the Council would “consider the situation”, which </p>
<p>Mr Straw argued stopped short of “decide”. Assessment was not, as Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>had characterised it, “a procedural ‘formality’”. That would be “to parody what we had </p>
<p>in mind; but certainly a process in which the outcome was quite deliberately at large”. </p>
<p>The resolution had given the F/R/C:</p>
<p>“… further discussions and time, further reports – and an ability to influence events, </p>
<p>in return for no automatic second resolution being necessary. And in return – a major </p>
<p>US concession – the US/UK agreed not to rely on 1441 as an authorisation for the </p>
<p>use of force immediately after its adoption (so called automaticity).” </p>
<p><b>414. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“Putting all this together, I think the better interpretation of the scheme laid out in </p>
<p>1441 is that (i) the fact of the material breach, (ii) (possibly) a further UNMOVIC </p>
<p>report and (iii) ‘consideration’ in the Council together revive 678. At the very least, </p>
<p>this interpretation, which coincides with our firm policy intention and that of our </p>
<p>160 </p>
<p>On 2 November, France proposed the words “shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq’s </p>
<p>obligations when assessed by the Security Council”. See Section 3.5.</p>

<p>the F/R/C the very legal prize they failed to achieve in the negotiation of 1441.”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he had “spent some time drafting” his letter to </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith, and that: </p>
<p>“Obviously I’m pretty certain that Sir Jeremy Greenstock would have seen the draft </p>
<p>and his legal adviser Iain Macleod, certainly Peter Ricketts … But … I then put it </p>

<p><b>Further advice on a second resolution</b></p>
<p><b>416.  Lord Goldsmith was asked on 4 February for urgent advice on a second </b></p>
<p><b>resolution determining that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered </b></p>
<p><b>in resolution 1441. </b></p>
<p><b>417. </b> Following a number of bilateral contacts about the nature of the second resolution, </p>
<p>Mr Grainger wrote to Ms Adams on 4 February warning that the indications were that </p>
<p>some key Security Council members, “such as France”, might not be persuaded that </p>
<p>the Council should adopt even an “implicit” resolution that mentioned material breach. </p>
<p>Mr Grainger sought Lord Goldsmith’s views “as soon as possible” on the elements </p>
<p>of a second resolution necessary to make clear that Iraq had failed to take the final </p>
<p>opportunity provided in resolution 1441 and that serious consequences would follow.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>418. </b> After rehearsing the key provisions of OPs 1, 2, 4, 11, 12 and 13, Mr Grainger </p>
<p>wrote:</p>
<p>“… the relationship between these various paragraphs is a matter of some </p>
<p>complexity. It is however clear that the serious consequences which the Council </p>
<p>has repeatedly warned Iraq it will face as a result of its continued violations of </p>
<p>its obligations … are to occur in the context of paragraph 12 – that is following </p>
<p>consideration of the situation by the Council in accordance with that paragraph. </p>
<p>The consideration … can take place only when a report – either of a material </p>
<p>breach under paragraph 4, or of the interference or failure to comply mentioned </p>
<p>in paragraph 11 – has been made. </p>
<p>“In our view once Council consideration has taken place, a specific reference to </p>
<p>material breach is not required in any decision by the Council: what is necessary </p>
<p>is that the Council should conclude that the serious consequences for Iraq referred </p>
<p>to in paragraph 13 are triggered. If the Council has considered a report under </p>
<p>paragraph 4, the finding of material breach will be implicit. If … the Council has </p>
<p>considered a report under paragraph 11, it will be clear that the new enhanced </p>
<p>inspections regime has not worked and therefore the material breach finding in </p>
<p>paragraph 1 is still operative.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>76</p>
<p><b>419. </b> Ms Adams responded on 6 February that Lord Goldsmith had agreed that:</p>
<p>“Provided the new resolution is linked back sufficiently to resolution 1441 so that it is </p>
<p>clear that the Council has concluded that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity </p>
<p>granted by resolution 1441, it should be possible to rely on the finding of material </p>
<p>breach in that resolution in order to revive the use of force in resolution 678.”</p>
<p>163</p>
<p><b>420. </b> Addressing draft text suggested by Mr Grainger, Ms Adams also recorded that </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… has some doubts about the generality of the wording ‘Iraq has still not complied’ </p>
<p>because not every incident of non-compliance will constitute a further material </p>
<p>breach under OP4 of resolution 1441 (see for example statements by the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary to Parliament</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>). Moreover, the Attorney recalls that Blix has indicated </p>
<p>that only serious cases of non-compliance would be reported to the Council </p>
<p>under OP11.”</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Ms Adams suggested that a better minimalist version for a resolution would be </p>
<p>one which:</p>
<p>“… stated simply that the Council has concluded that Iraq has failed to take the </p>
<p>final opportunity offered by resolution 1441. This would indicate that the finding of </p>
<p>material breach in OP1 of resolution 1441 is no longer suspended, thus reviving the </p>
<p>authorisation to use force in resolution 678. In this case there would be no need for </p>
<p>an operative paragraph on ‘serious consequences’ because this would follow from </p>
<p>the terms of resolution 1441.”</p>

<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s visit to Washington, 10 February 2003</b></p>
<p><b>422.  Lord Goldsmith’s discussions in Washington on 10 February confirmed that </b></p>
<p><b>the US position was that Iraq was in material breach of resolution 1441 and the </b></p>

<p><b>426. </b> Lord Goldsmith met Mr John Bellinger III (the NSC Legal Adviser), Judge Alberto </p>
<p>Gonzales (Counsel to the President), Dr Rice, Mr William Taft IV (Legal Adviser at the </p>
<p>State Department), Mr Marc Grossman (Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs) </p>
<p>and Mr William Haynes II (General Counsel at the DoD).</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>427. </b> Ms Adams’ record of the discussions set out the questions which had been </p>
<p>addressed and the US responses, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 contained two determinations of material breach (in OPs 1 </p>
<p>and 4) and the US view was that the conditions of OP4 had already been met. </p>
<p>There was, therefore, a Security Council determination of material breach by </p>
<p>Iraq, meaning that the conditions for the cease-fire were no longer in place.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of the term “material breach” had been avoided in 1998. Its use in </p>
<p>resolution 1441 strengthened the argument that the Council intended to revive </p>
<p>resolution 678.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The use of the term “co-operate fully” had been retained in the resolution </p>
<p>in order to ensure that any instances of non-co-operation would be material. </p>
<p>In the US view, “any” Iraqi non-compliance was sufficient to constitute a material </p>
<p>breach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US recognised the UK’s concerns about de minimis breaches (eg an hour’s </p>
<p>delay in getting access to a site), but considered that the situation was “well </p>
<p>past” that point.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inspectors were “reporters not assessors”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US would not have accepted a resolution implying that a further decision </p>
<p>was required.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>OP12 was not a “purely procedural requirement”. The members of the Council </p>
<p>were “under a good faith obligation to participate in the further consideration of </p>
<p>the matter within the meaning of OP12”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US had satisfied that requirement by the actions they had already taken, for </p>
<p>example Secretary Powell’s report to the Council on 5 February.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Brenton commented that there had been “no problem lining up a good range </p>
<p>of senior interlocutors” for Lord Goldsmith to meet, “underlining how important the </p>

<p><b>432.  Following discussion between Mr Blair and President Bush on 19 February, </b></p>

<p>it in resolution 1441 (2002)”.</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>438. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had told Ambassador Negroponte that the draft “was </p>
<p>thin on anything with which Council members could argue and would be less frightening </p>
<p>to the middle ground”. It did not refer to “serious consequences” and that “instead of </p>
<p>relying on OP4 of 1441”, the draft resolution “relied on OP1 of 1441, re-establishing </p>
<p>the material breach suspended in OP2”.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Sir Jeremy added that issuing the draft would signal the intent to move to a final </p>
<p>debate, which they should seek to focus “not on individual elements of co-operation </p>
<p>but on the failure by Iraq to voluntarily disarm” and avoid being “thrown off course by </p>
<p>individual benchmarks or judgement by Blix”. It should be accompanied by a “powerful </p>
<p>statement about what 1441 had asked for” which had “been twisted into partial, </p>
<p>procedural, and grudging co-operation from Iraq”; and that “substantive, active and </p>
<p>voluntary co-operation was not happening”. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> In response to a question from the US about whether the “central premise”, that </p>
<p>the final opportunity was “now over”, would be disputed, Sir Jeremy said that: </p>
<p>“… was where we would have to define our terms carefully: voluntary disarmament </p>
<p>was not happening.”</p>

<p> She pointed out that </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith did “not agree with the legal analysis” in Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s first </p>
<p>telegram. Lord Goldsmith considered:</p>
<p>“… that OP4 of resolution 1441 is highly relevant to determining whether or not Iraq </p>
<p>has taken the final opportunity granted by OP2 … Moreover, PP5 of the draft text </p>
<p>uses language drawn from OP4 to establish the fact that Iraq has failed to comply … </p>
<p>the Attorney does not consider that it is accurate to say that the draft text relies on </p>
<p>OP1 … rather than OP4.”</p>
<p><b>442. </b> On the draft text, Ms Adams wrote that Lord Goldsmith considered:</p>
<p>“… it would be preferable for any resolution to indicate as clearly as possible that </p>
<p>the resolution is intended to authorise the use of force. The clearer the resolution, </p>
<p>the easier it will be to defend legally the reliance on the ‘revival argument’, which </p>
<p>… is … controversial. A resolution which included the terms ‘material breach’ and </p>
<p>‘serious consequences’ … would therefore be desirable … However, the Attorney </p>

<p>regime; and the importance of maintaining the authority of the UN in the international </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>458. </b> Ms Adams advised Lord Goldsmith that the purpose of the meeting was to “discuss </p>
<p>the French veto”, which she interpreted as meaning “the scope for action in the absence </p>
<p>of a second resolution”. </p>
<p><b>459. </b> Ms Adams provided a speaking note for Lord Goldsmith, setting out the legal </p>
<p>arguments in detail, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the discussions with Mr Straw, Sir Jeremy Greenstock and the US Administration </p>
<p>“were valuable” and had given Lord Goldsmith “background information on the </p>
<p>negotiating history” which he had “not previously had”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US discussions were “particularly useful” as they gave “a clearer insight </p>
<p>into the important US/French bilateral discussions over the terms of OP12 of </p>
<p>resolution 1441”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that was “relevant to the interpretation of the resolution”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>while the revival argument was “controversial”, Lord Goldsmith had “already </p>
<p>made clear” that he agreed with the advice of his predecessors that it provided </p>
<p>“a valid legal basis for the use of force provided that the conditions for revival” </p>
<p>were “satisfied”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “arguments in support of the revival argument” were “stronger following </p>
<p>adoption of resolution 1441”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“elements” of resolution 1441 indicated that the Security Council “intended to </p>
<p>revive the authorisation in [resolution] 678”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>but the Council “clearly … did not intend 678 to revive immediately”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the procedure set out in OPs 4,11 and 12 “for determining whether or not Iraq </p>
<p>has taken the final opportunity” were “somewhat ambiguous”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it was “clear” that if Iraq did not comply there would be “a further Council </p>
<p>discussion” but it was “not clear what happens next”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it was “arguable” that OPs 4 and 12 indicated that “a further Council decision” </p>
<p>was “required”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had been “impressed” by the “strength and sincerity” of the US </p>
<p>view that they had “conceded a Council discussion and no more”;</p>

<p>the difficulty of relying on the assertions of US officials that the French knew </p>
<p>and accepted what they were voting for when there was little “hard evidence </p>
<p>beyond a couple of telegrams recording admissions by French negotiators that </p>
<p>they knew the US would not accept a resolution which required a further Council </p>
<p>decision”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the possibility remains that the French and others accepted OP12 because </p>
<p>in their view it gave them a sufficient basis on which to argue that a second </p>
<p>resolution was required (even if that was not made expressly clear)”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the statements made on adoption of the resolution indicated that “there were </p>
<p>differing views within the Council as to the legal effect of the resolution”.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Lord Goldsmith was advised to state that he remained “of the view that the safest </p>
<p>legal course would be to secure a further Security Council resolution” which, as he had </p>
<p>advised the FCO, need not explicitly authorise the use of force as long as it made clear </p>
<p>that the Council had “concluded that Iraq has not taken its final opportunity”. </p>
<p><b>461. </b> Ms Adams advised that he should further state:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, having regard to the further information on the negotiating history </p>
<p>which I have been given and to the arguments of the US administration which </p>
<p>I heard in Washington, I am prepared to accept – and I am choosing my words </p>
<p>carefully here – that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable </p>
<p>of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution if there are strong </p>
<p>factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity. </p>
<p>In other words we would need to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance </p>
<p>and non-co-operation.” </p>
<p><b>462. </b> Lord Goldsmith was also advised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that a court “might well conclude” that OPs 4 and 12 did “require a further </p>
<p>Council decision”, but that “the counter view can reasonably be maintained”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that the analysis applied “whether a second resolution fails to be adopted </p>
<p>because of a lack of votes or because it is vetoed. I do not see any difference </p>
<p>between the two cases”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>it was “important that in the course of negotiations on the second resolution </p>
<p>we do not give the impression that we believe it is legally required. That would </p>
<p>undermine our case for reliance on resolution 1441”. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> There is no No.10 record of the 27 February meeting. </p>
<p><b>464. </b> In his record of a telephone call from Lord Goldsmith reporting the meeting, </p>

<p>that was no more than “reasonably arguable”.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Mr Brummell also wrote:</p>
<p>“Jonathan Powell said that he understood the Attorney’s advice in summary to mean </p>
<p>that by far the safest way forward is to obtain a second resolution, but that, if we are </p>
<p>unable to obtain one, it might be arguable that we do not need one, although we </p>
<p>could not be confident that a court would agree with this.</p>
<p>“The No.10 representatives confirmed that the US and UK Governments were </p>
<p>continuing with their intensive efforts to secure the passage of a second resolution, </p>
<p>if at all possible. </p>
<p>“Jonathan Powell confirmed that No.10 did not wish the Attorney’s advice to become </p>
<p>public.” </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Powell told the Inquiry that he did not really remember the meeting.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he did not know why he had not informed </p>
<p>No.10 that there was a reasonable case before 27 February. He said:</p>
<p>“After I came back from the United States … I had taken the view there was a </p>
<p>reasonable case. A draft was produced which reflected that. I don’t know why it took </p>
<p>me until 27 February, but that may have been the first time there was a meeting. </p>
<p>I met with Jonathan Powell, Sir David Manning and Baroness Morgan and told them </p>
<p>that I had been very much assisted in my considerations by Jeremy Greenstock, </p>
<p>the Americans – I may have mentioned Jack Straw as well, and I was able to tell </p>
<p>them that it was my view that there was a reasonable case.”</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>468. </b> Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“Obviously, I had prepared what I was going to say. Then – so I told them – and </p>
<p>I had given them, therefore, as I saw it, and as I believe they saw it … the green </p>
<p>light, if you will, that it was lawful to take military action, should there not be a second </p>
<p>resolution and should it be politically decided that that was the right course to take.”</p>
<p><b>469. </b> Lord Goldsmith identified three main influences on his thinking which contributed to </p>
<p>the change in his position by the end of February that a reasonable case could be made </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>meetings in the US on 10 February. </p>
<p><b>470. </b> Lord Goldsmith described the purpose of his meeting with Sir Jeremy as:</p>
<p>“… to get first-hand from our principal negotiator at the United Nations his </p>
<p>observations on the negotiating history and on the text which had been agreed and </p>
<p>his understanding of what it meant, particularly to get his comments on the textual </p>
<p>arguments we had raised.</p>
<p>“ … It doesn’t mean I follow it, but it is helpful to me … because if you understand </p>
<p>what somebody is trying to achieve, you can then often look at the document with </p>
<p>that in mind, and then the words which are used become clearer to you.”</p>
<p>186</p>
<p><b>471. </b> Lord Goldsmith also told the Inquiry that Sir Jeremy: </p>
<p>“… was very clear in saying the French, Russians lost and they knew they had lost </p>
<p>… and his argument was – that’s why the resolution is worded the way that it is.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“… It was a compromise, but compromise in this sense: that the United States had </p>
<p>conceded a Council discussion but no more.”</p>
<p>187</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Sir Jeremy had made some good points and he had made some headway with me, </p>
<p>but, frankly there was still work for me to do and he hadn’t got me there, if you like, </p>
<p>yet.”</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>473. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that his letter of 6 February to Lord Goldsmith,<b> </b>was “really </p>

<p>189</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Following his meetings in the US on 10 February, Lord Goldsmith was impressed </p>
<p>by the fact that, in negotiating 1441, the US had a single red line which was not to lose </p>
<p>the freedom of action to use force that they believed they had before 1441, and their </p>
<p>certainty that they had not done so. </p>
<p><b>475. </b> Asked to explain how the US belief that it had preserved its “red line” had </p>
<p>influenced his considerations, Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that all his US interlocutors </p>
<p>had spoken with one voice on the issue of the interpretation of 1441: </p>
<p>“The discussion involved some detailed textual questions … On one point they were </p>
<p>absolutely speaking with one voice, which is they were very clear that what mattered </p>

<p>to them, what mattered to President Bush, is whether they would … concede a veto </p>
<p>… that the red line was that they shouldn’t do that, and they were confident that they </p>
<p>had not … </p>
<p>“… [T]he red line was ‘We believe’ they were saying ‘that we have a right to go </p>
<p>without this resolution. We have been persuaded to come to the United Nations’ … </p>
<p>‘but the one thing that mustn’t happen is that by going down this route, we then find </p>
<p>we lose the freedom of action we think we now have’ and if the resolution had said </p>
<p>there must be a further decision by the Security Council, that’s what it would have </p>
<p>done, and the United States would have been tied into that. </p>
<p>“They were all very, very clear that was the most important point to them and that </p>
<p>they hadn’t conceded that, and they were very clear that the French understood </p>
<p>that, that they said that they had discussed this with other members of the Security </p>
<p>Council as well and they all understood that was the position.”</p>
<p>190</p>
<p><b>476. </b> Lord Goldsmith stated:</p>
<p>“It was frankly, quite hard to believe, given what I had been told about the one red </p>
<p>line that President Bush had, that all these experienced lawyers and negotiators in </p>
<p>the United States could actually have stumbled into doing the one thing that they </p>
<p>had been told mustn’t happen … a red line means a red line. It was the only one, </p>
<p>I was told, that mattered. They didn’t mind what else went into the resolution, so </p>
<p>long as it did not provide a veto, and if it required a decision then one of the Security </p>
<p>Council members, perhaps the French, could then have vetoed action by the United </p>
<p>States, which, up to that point, they believed they could take in any event.”</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>477. </b> Asked whether his US interlocutors had been able to provide him with any </p>
<p>evidence that France had acknowledged the US position, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“I wish they had presented me with more. That was one of the difficulties, and </p>
<p>I make reference to this, that, at the end of the day we were sort of dependent upon </p>
<p>their view in relation to that … I looked very carefully at all the negotiating telegrams </p>
<p>and I had seen that there were some acknowledgements of that, acknowledgements </p>
<p>that the French understood the United States’ position, at least, in telegrams that </p>
<p>I had seen, and I was told of occasions when this had been clearly stated to the </p>
<p>French.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>478. </b> Correspondence between Ms Adams and the British Embassy Washington </p>

<p>to find a statement from the French acknowledging that a second resolution would not </p>
<p>be needed.</p>
<p>193</p>
<p><b>479. </b> Asked if he should also have sought the views of the French, Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“No I couldn’t do that. I plainly could not have done that … because, there we were, </p>
<p>plainly by this stage, in a major diplomatic stand-off between the United States and </p>
<p>France … you couldn’t have had the British Attorney General being seen to go to the </p>
<p>French to ask them ‘What do you think?’ The message that that would have given </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein about the degree of our commitment would have been huge.”</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>480. </b> Others had a different view. </p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that if Lord Goldsmith “had asked to talk to the French, </p>
<p>of course, we would have facilitated that … I have no recollection of that ever being </p>
<p>raised with me at all”.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>482. </b> Asked about Lord Goldsmith’s evidence that he could not speak to French officials </p>
<p>about the interpretation of resolution 1441, Sir John Holmes, British Ambassador to </p>
<p>France from 2002 to 2007, replied:</p>
<p>“I don’t see why he couldn’t have done, or at least somebody else ask the question </p>
<p>on his behalf. But I think what is true is that the French were, again, very wary about </p>
<p>ever saying what their own legal position was. They took a very strong political </p>
<p>position about no automaticity … but they were very careful, I don’t remember them </p>
<p>ever actually saying what their own legal position was.”</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>483. </b> Asked whether the legal position would have mattered as much to the French as it </p>
<p>did to us, Sir John responded: “No because the automatic assumption increasingly was </p>

<p><b>485.  Mr Straw also stated that a majority of members of the Security Council had </b></p>
<p><b>been opposed to the suggestion that resolution 1441 should state explicitly that </b></p>
<p><b>military action could be taken only if there were a second resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>486. </b> In his evidence to the FAC on 4 March, Mr Straw was asked a series of questions </p>
<p>by Mr Donald Anderson, the Chairman of the Committee, about the legality of military </p>
<p>action without a second resolution.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Asked about Mr Blair’s “escape clause” and that the Government “would not </p>
<p>feel bound to await” a second resolution “or to abide by it if it were to be vetoed </p>
<p>unreasonably”, Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“The reason why we have drawn a parallel with Kosovo is … it was not possible to </p>
<p>get a direct Security Council resolution and instead the Government and those that </p>
<p>participated in the action had to fall back on previous … resolutions and general </p>
<p>international law … to justify the action that was taken … We are satisfied that we </p>
<p>have sufficient legal authority in 1441 back to the originating resolution 660 [1990] … </p>
<p>to justify military action against Iraq if they are in further material breach.”</p>
<p><b>488. </b> Mr Straw added that that was “clearly laid down and it was anticipated when we </p>
<p>put 1441 together”. The Government would “much prefer” military action, if that proved </p>
<p>necessary, “to be backed by a second resolution”, but it had had to reserve its options if </p>
<p>such a second resolution did not prove possible. That was what Mr Blair had “spelt out”. </p>
<p><b>489. </b> Asked if the Government should proceed without the express authority of the UN, </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“We believe there is express authority … There was a … a very intensive debate </p>
<p>– about whether … 1441 should say explicitly … that military action to enforce </p>
<p>this resolution could only be taken if there were a second resolution. That … was </p>
<p>not acceptable to a majority of members of the Security Council, it was never put </p>
<p>before the … Council. Instead … what the Council has to do … is to consider the </p>
<p>situation …”</p>
<p><b>490. </b> Mr Straw told Sir Patrick Cormack (Conservative) that Iraq had “been in material </p>
<p>breach as a matter of fact for some weeks now because they were told they had to </p>
<p>co-operate immediately, unconditionally and actively”. He added:</p>
<p>“… we are anxious to gain a political consensus, if that can be achieved … which </p>
<p>recognises the state of Iraq’s flagrant violation of its obligations. As far as … </p>
<p>the British Government is concerned, that is a matter of fact; the facts speak for </p>

<p><b>498.  Despite Lord Goldsmith’s previous advice that, if a further resolution was </b></p>

<p>“politically and legally” UK participation in military action would be acceptable. “But if </p>

<p>91</p>
<p><b>504. </b> Ms Adams described the purpose of the meeting between Lord Goldsmith and </p>

<p>the concept of an “unreasonable” veto. The advice and Lord Goldsmith’s subsequent </p>

<p><b>505.  Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, raised the absence of an </b></p>
<p><b>agreed legal basis for military action with Sir Andrew Turnbull on 5 March.</b></p>
<p><b>506. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit wrote to Sir Andrew Turnbull on 5 March stating:</p>
<p>“I am sure you have this in hand already, but in case it might help, I should like to </p>
<p>offer you my thoughts on the procedure for handling the legal basis for any offensive </p>
<p>operations … in Iraq – a subject touching on my responsibilities since it is the CDS </p>
<p>[Chief of the Defence Staff] who will need to be assured that he will be acting on the </p>
<p>basis of a lawful instruction from the Prime Minister and the Defence Secretary.</p>
<p>“It is not possible to be certain about the precise circumstances in which this would </p>
<p>arise because we cannot be sure about the UN scenario involved … Clearly full UN </p>
<p>cover is devoutly to be desired – and not just for the military operation itself …</p>
<p>“My purpose in writing, however, is not to argue the legal merits of the case … but to </p>
<p>flag up … that the call to action from President Bush could come at quite short notice </p>
<p>and that we need to be prepared to handle the legalities so we can deliver …</p>
<p>“In these circumstances, I suggest that the Prime Minister should be prepared </p>
<p>to convene a special meeting of the inner ‘war’ Cabinet (Defence and Foreign </p>
<p>Secretaries certainly, Chancellor, DPM [Deputy Prime Minister], Home Secretary </p>
<p>possibly, Attorney General, crucially) at which CDS effectively receives his legal and </p>
<p>constitutional authorisation. We have already given the Attorney General information </p>
<p>and MOD briefings on objectives and rationale, and I understand that John Scarlett </p>
<p>[Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC)] is conducting further briefing on </p>
<p>the basis of the intelligence material. </p>
<p>“While it is not possible to predict the timing of the event precisely … [it] could </p>
<p>conceivably be as early as 10 March … in the event, albeit unlikely, that the </p>
<p>Americans lost hope in the UN and move fast. Michael Jay may have a better fix on </p>
<p>this, but I guess the more likely timing would be for Security Council action around </p>
<p>the weekend of 15/16 March, and therefore for a meeting after that.”</p>

<p><b>511.  At Cabinet on 6 March, Mr Blair concluded that it was for the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>to determine whether Iraq was co-operating fully.</b></p>
<p><b>512. </b> Summing up the discussion at Cabinet on 6 March, Mr Blair said it was “the </p>
<p>responsibility of the Chief Inspectors to present the truth about Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>co-operation with the United Nations, so that the Security Council could discharge its </p>
<p>responsibilities in making the necessary political decisions”. The UK was “lobbying hard </p>
<p>in favour of the draft Security Council resolution”. It was the duty of Saddam Hussein to </p>
<p>co-operate fully, “and it was for the Security Council to determine whether that had been </p>
<p>the case”.</p>

<p>that he had been asked for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without </p>
<p>another resolution of the Security Council, further to resolution 1441.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>516. </b> Lord Goldsmith identified three possible bases for the use of military force. </p>
<p>He explained that neither self-defence nor the use of force to avert overwhelming </p>
<p>humanitarian catastrophe applied in this case. </p>
<p><b>517. </b> As regards the third basis, he wrote that force may be used: </p>
<p>“… where this is authorised by the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VII </p>
<p>of the UN Charter. The key question is whether resolution 1441 has the effect of </p>
<p>providing such authorisation …” </p>
<p><b>518. </b> He wrote:</p>
<p>“As you are aware, the argument that resolution 1441 itself provides the </p>
<p>authorisation to use force depends on the revival of the express authorisation to </p>
<p>use force given in 1990 by Security Council Resolution 678.” </p>
<p>213 </p>
<p>Minute Goldsmith to Prime Minister, 7 March 2003, ‘Iraq: Resolution 1441’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>94</p>
<p><b>519.  Lord Goldsmith posed and answered two questions. First, he considered </b></p>
<p><b>whether the revival argument was a sound legal basis in principle. Second, he </b></p>
<p><b>considered the question of whether resolution 1441 had the effect of reviving the </b></p>
<p><b>authority to use military force in resolution 678 (1990).</b></p>
<p><b>The revival argument – a sound basis “in principle”</b></p>
<p><b>520. </b> Lord Goldsmith set out the basic principles of the revival argument and described </p>
<p>how, in January 1993 (following UN Presidential Statements condemning particular </p>
<p>failures by Iraq to observe the terms of the cease-fire resolution) and again in December </p>
<p>1998 (for Operation Desert Fox), following a series of Security Council resolutions, </p>
<p>notably 1205 (1998), the use of force had relied on the revival argument. </p>
<p><b>521. </b> He wrote:</p>
<p>“Law Officers have advised in the past that, provided the conditions are made out, </p>
<p>the revival argument does provide a sufficient justification in international law for the </p>
<p>use of force against Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>522. </b> Having referred to the opinion, expressed in August 1992, by then UN Legal </p>
<p>Counsel, Carl-August Fleischauer, as supportive of the UK view, Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>continued:</p>
<p>“However, the UK has consistently taken the view (as did the Fleischauer opinion) </p>
<p>that as the cease-fire conditions were set by the Security Council in resolution 687, </p>
<p>it is for the Council to assess whether any such breach of those obligations has </p>
<p>occurred.</p>
<p>“The US have a rather different view: they maintain that the fact of whether Iraq is in </p>
<p>breach is a matter of objective fact which may therefore be assessed by individual </p>
<p>Member States. I am not aware of any other state which supports this view. This is </p>
<p>an issue of critical importance when considering the effect of resolution 1441.” </p>
<p><b>523. </b> Lord Goldsmith concluded:</p>
<p>“The revival argument is controversial. It is not widely accepted among academic </p>
<p>commentators. However, I agree with my predecessors’ advice on this issue. </p>
<p>Further, I believe that the arguments in support of the revival argument are stronger </p>
<p>following adoption of resolution 1441.”</p>
<p><b>524. </b> Lord Goldsmith explained that this was because of the terms of the resolution </p>
<p>and the negotiations which led to its adoption. He noted that PPs 4, 5 and 10 of the </p>
<p>resolution recalled “the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 and that resolution </p>
<p>687 imposed obligations on Iraq as a necessary condition of the cease-fire”; that OP </p>
<p>1 provided that Iraq had been and remained in material breach of relevant resolutions </p>
<p>including resolution 687; and that OP13 recalled that Iraq had been “warned repeatedly” </p>
<p>that “serious consequences” would “result from continued violations of its obligations”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>95</p>
<p><b>525. </b> Lord Goldsmith noted:</p>
<p>“… Previous practice of the Council and statements made by Council members </p>
<p>during the negotiation of resolution 1441 demonstrate that the phrase ‘material </p>
<p>breach’ signifies a finding by the Council of a sufficiently serious breach of the </p>
<p>cease-fire conditions to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 and that ‘serious </p>
<p>consequences’ is accepted as indicating the use of force.”</p>
<p><b>526. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“ … I disagree, therefore, with those commentators and lawyers who assert </p>
<p>that nothing less than an explicit authorisation to use force in a Security Council </p>
<p>resolution will be sufficient.” </p>
<p><b>The revival argument – the effect of resolution 1441 (2002)</b></p>
<p><b>527.  Having accepted the validity of the revival argument Lord Goldsmith </b></p>
<p><b>addressed the question of whether resolution 1441 was sufficient to revive the </b></p>
<p><b>authorisation in resolution 678 without an assessment by the Security Council </b></p>
<p><b>that the basis of the cease-fire established in resolution 687 had been destroyed.</b></p>
<p><b>528. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“In order for the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 to be revived, there </p>
<p>needs to be a determination by the Security Council that there is a violation of the </p>
<p>conditions of the cease-fire and that the Security Council considers it sufficiently </p>
<p>serious to destroy the basis of the cease-fire. Revival will not, however, take place, </p>
<p>notwithstanding a finding of violation, if the Security Council has made clear either </p>
<p>that action short of the use of force should be taken to ensure compliance with </p>
<p>the terms of the cease-fire, or that it intends to decide subsequently what action </p>
<p>is required to ensure compliance.” </p>
<p><b>529. </b> He continued:</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding the determination of material breach in OP1 of resolution 1441,  </p>
<p>it is clear that the Council did not intend that the authorisation in resolution 678 </p>
<p>should revive immediately following the adoption of resolution 1441, since OP2 </p>
<p>of the resolution affords Iraq a ‘final opportunity’ to comply with its disarmament </p>
<p>obligations under previous resolutions by co-operating with the enhanced inspection </p>
<p>regime described in OPs 3 and 5-9. But OP2 also states that the Council has </p>
<p>determined that compliance with resolution 1441 is Iraq’s last chance before the </p>
<p>cease-fire resolution will be enforced.” </p>
<p><b>530. </b> On that basis, Lord Goldsmith expressed the view that:</p>
<p>“OP2 has the effect therefore of suspending the legal consequences of the OP1 </p>
<p>determination of material breach which would otherwise have triggered the revival </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>of the authorisation in resolution 678. The narrow but key question is: on the true </p>
<p>interpretation of resolution 1441, what has the Security Council decided will be the </p>
<p>consequences of Iraq’s failure to comply with the enhanced regime.”</p>
<p><b>531. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… without a firebreak, they [members of the Security Council] understood from past </p>
<p>practice, from what happened in 1998 after resolution 1205, that the United States </p>
<p>and the United Kingdom, and perhaps other states, would have then taken that as </p>
<p>saying ‘We now have the authority of the United Nations to move today’.”</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>532. </b> Lord Goldsmith identified OPs 4, 11 and 12 as the provisions relevant to the </p>
<p>question of whether or not Iraq had taken the final opportunity:</p>
<p>“It is clear from the text of the resolution, and is apparent from the negotiating </p>
<p>history, that if Iraq fails to comply, there will be a further Security Council discussion. </p>
<p>The text is, however, ambiguous and unclear on what happens next.”</p>
<p><b>533. </b> On that question, Lord Goldsmith identified and summarised the “two competing </p>
<p>arguments”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that provided there is a Council discussion, if it does not reach a conclusion, </p>
<p>there remains an authorisation to use force”; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“that nothing short of a further Council decision will be a legitimate basis for the </p>
<p>use of force”. </p>
<p><b>The first line of argument</b></p>
<p><b>534. </b> The first line of argument maintained that, provided there was a Council </p>
<p>discussion, whether conclusive or not, there remained an authorisation to use force. </p>
<p><b>535. </b> It relied on the following steps:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had been found to be in material breach of relevant resolutions including </p>
<p>resolutions 678 and 687. Its violations were therefore, in principle, sufficient to </p>
<p>revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had been given a final opportunity to comply and had been warned that it </p>
<p>would face serious consequences if it did not do so.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>OP4 of resolution 1441 had the effect of determining in advance that any false </p>
<p>statements by Iraq in its declaration and failure by Iraq at any time to comply </p>
<p>with and co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution would constitute </p>
<p>a further material breach and would thus revive the authority which had been </p>
<p>suspended without any further determination by the Security Council.</p>

<p>97</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was necessary, however, for the Security Council to meet “to consider the </p>
<p>situation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As the resolution had not specified that the Security Council should “decide” </p>
<p>what action should be taken, such a meeting would provide an opportunity for </p>
<p>further action by the Security Council, but it was not essential that it reach a </p>
<p>decision. Once the procedural requirement was satisfied, the authority to take </p>
<p>military action in resolution 678 was, once again, fully revived.</p>
<p><b>The second line of argument</b></p>
<p><b>536. </b> The second line of argument focused, by contrast, on the words in OP4 (“and </p>
<p>will be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and </p>
<p>12 below”) and on the requirement in OP12 for the Security Council to “consider the </p>
<p>situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions </p>
<p>in order to secure international peace and security”. According to the second line of </p>
<p>argument, these provisions implied a return to the Security Council for a decision.</p>
<p><b>537. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that one view in support of the second line of argument </p>
<p>was that the wording of OP4 “indicated the need for an assessment by the Security </p>
<p>Council of how serious any Iraqi breaches [were] and whether any Iraqi breaches [were] </p>
<p>sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the cease-fire”. He pointed out that this had </p>
<p>been the position taken by Mr Straw when he told Parliament on 25 November that </p>
<p>“material breach means something significant; some behaviour or pattern of behaviour </p>
<p>where any single action appears relatively minor but the action as a whole adds up to </p>
<p>something more deliberate and significant: something that shows Iraq’s intention not </p>
<p>to comply”. If that was so, the question was by whom such an assessment was to be </p>
<p>carried out. Lord Goldsmith noted that, according to the UK view of the revival argument, </p>
<p>it could only be the Security Council. </p>
<p><b>538. </b> Lord Goldsmith set out the counter position as:</p>
<p>“If OP4 means what it says: the words ‘co-operate fully’ were included specifically </p>
<p>to ensure that any instances of non-co-operation would amount to material breach. </p>
<p>This is the US analysis of OP4 and is undoubtedly more consistent with the view that </p>
<p>no further decision of the Council is necessary to authorise force, because it can be </p>
<p>argued that the Council has determined in advance that any failure will be a material </p>
<p>breach.” </p>
<p><b>539. </b> Lord Goldsmith advised that the critical issue was, nonetheless, what was to </p>
<p>happen when a report came to the Security Council under OP4 or OP11. “In other </p>
<p>words”, he wrote, “what does OP12 require”. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>

<p><b>The significance of OP12</b></p>
<p><b>540. </b> Lord Goldsmith noted that the language of OP12 was a compromise and was </p>
<p>unclear. But it did provide that there should be a meeting of the Council “to consider </p>
<p>the situation and the need for compliance in order to secure international peace and </p>
<p>security”.</p>
<p><b>541. </b> Thus, Lord Goldsmith observed, the Security Council was provided with an </p>
<p>opportunity to take a further decision expressly authorising the use of force or, </p>
<p>“conceivably, to decide that other enforcement measures should be used”. If it did not do </p>
<p>so, however, he stated that the “clear US view” was that “the determination” of material </p>
<p>breach in OPs 1 and 4 would remain valid, thus authorising the use of force without </p>
<p>a further decision.</p>
<p><b>542. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that his view was: </p>
<p>“… that different considerations apply in different circumstances. The OP12 </p>
<p>discussion might make clear that the Council view is that military action is </p>
<p>appropriate but that no further decision is required because of the terms of resolution </p>
<p>1441. In such a case, there would be good grounds for relying on the existing </p>
<p>resolution as the legal basis for any subsequent military action. The more difficult </p>
<p>scenario is if the views of Council members are divided and a further resolution </p>
<p>is not adopted either because it fails to attract 9 votes or because it is vetoed.”</p>
<p><b>543. </b> Lord Goldsmith rehearsed the arguments for and against the view that, in those </p>
<p>circumstances, no further decision of the Security Council was needed to authorise the </p>
<p>use of force.</p>
<p><b>544. </b> He identified the principal argument in favour of this interpretation to be that the </p>
<p>word “consider” had been chosen deliberately and that French and Russian proposals </p>
<p>to amend this provision so that the Security Council should be required to “decide” what </p>
<p>was to happen had not been accepted.</p>
<p><b>545. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that he had been impressed by the strength and sincerity </p>
<p>of the views of the US Administration on this point. At the same time, “the difficulty” was </p>
<p>that the UK was “reliant” on US “assertions” that France and others:</p>
<p>“… knew and accepted that they were voting for a further discussion and no </p>
<p>more. We have very little evidence of this beyond a couple of telegrams recording </p>
<p>admissions by French negotiators that they knew the US would not accept a </p>
<p>resolution which required a Council decision. The possibility remains that the French </p>
<p>and others accepted OP12 because in their view it gave them a sufficient basis on </p>
<p>which to argue that a second resolution was required (even if that was not made </p>
<p>expressly clear).”</p>

<p>99</p>
<p><b>546. </b> Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“A further difficulty is that, if the matter ever came before a court, it is very uncertain </p>
<p>to what extent the court would accept evidence of the negotiating history to support </p>
<p>a particular interpretation of the resolution, given that most of the negotiations were </p>
<p>conducted in private and there are no agreed or official records.” </p>
<p><b>547. </b> Lord Goldsmith identified three arguments in support of the view that a further </p>
<p>decision was needed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The word “assessment” in OP4 and the language of OP12 indicated that the </p>
<p>Council would be assessing the seriousness of any Iraqi breach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was special significance in the words “in order to secure international </p>
<p>peace and security” reflecting the responsibility of the Security Council under </p>
<p>Article 39 of the UN Charter and it could be argued that the Council was to </p>
<p>exercise a determinative role on the issue.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any other construction reduced the role of the Security Council to a formality.</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote: </p>
<p>“Others have jibbed at this categorisation, but I remain of the opinion that this </p>
<p>would be the effect in legal terms of the view that no further resolution is required. </p>
<p>The Council would be required to meet, and all members of the Council would be </p>
<p>under an obligation to participate in the discussion in good faith, but even if an </p>
<p>overwhelming majority of the Council were opposed to the use of force, military </p>
<p>action could proceed regardless.” </p>
<p><b>549. </b> Lord Goldsmith pointed out that the statements made by Security Council </p>
<p>members on the adoption of resolution 1441, which might be referred to in </p>
<p>circumstances when the wording of the resolution was not clear, were not conclusive. </p>
<p>He wrote:</p>
<p>“Only the US explicitly stated that it believed that the resolution did not constrain the </p>
<p>use of force by States ‘to enforce relevant United Nations resolutions and protect </p>
<p>world peace and security’ regardless of whether there was a further Security Council </p>
<p>decision. Conversely, two other Council members, Mexico and Ireland, made clear </p>
<p>that in their view a further decision of the Council was required before the use </p>
<p>of force would be authorised. Syria also stated that the resolution should not be </p>
<p>interpreted, through certain paragraphs, as authorising any State to use force.” </p>
<p><b>Other arguments rejected</b></p>
<p><b>550. </b> Lord Goldsmith rejected the argument that it was possible to establish that Iraq </p>
<p>had failed to take its final opportunity through the procedures in OPs 11 and 12 without </p>
<p>regard to the words “for assessment” in OP4. He accepted that the words “and shall be </p>
<p>reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12” were </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>added at a late stage, but noted that it was substituted for other language “which would </p>
<p>clearly have had the effect of making any finding of material breach subject to a further </p>
<p>Council decision”. He wrote:</p>
<p>“It is clear … that any Iraqi conduct which would be sufficient to trigger a report </p>
<p>from the inspectors under OP11 would also amount to a failure to comply with and </p>
<p>co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution and would thus be covered </p>
<p>by OP4. In addition, the reference to paragraph 11 in OP4 cannot be ignored. It is </p>
<p>not entirely clear what this means, but the most convincing explanation seems to be </p>
<p>that it is a recognition that an OP11 inspectors’ report would also constitute a report </p>
<p>of a further material breach within the meaning of OP4 and would thus be assessed </p>
<p>by the Council under OP12.”</p>
<p><b>551. </b> Addressing whether the differences between the US and UK objectives had any </p>
<p>impact on the interpretation of resolution 1441, Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“I have considered whether this difference in the underlying legal view means that </p>
<p>the effect of the resolution might be different for the US than for the UK, but I have </p>
<p>concluded that it does not affect the position. If OP12 of the resolution, properly </p>
<p>interpreted, were to mean that a further Council decision was required before force </p>
<p>was authorised, this would constrain the US just as much as the UK. It was therefore </p>
<p>an essential negotiating point for the US that the resolution should not concede the </p>
<p>need for a second resolution. They are convinced that they succeeded.” </p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>552. </b> In paragraphs headed “Summary”, Lord Goldsmith set out his conclusions.</p>
<p><b>553. </b> He wrote that the language of resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… leaves the position unclear and the statements made on adoption of the </p>
<p>resolution suggest that there were differences of view within the Council as to the </p>
<p>legal effect of the resolution. Arguments can be made on both sides. </p>
<p>“A key question is whether there is … a need for an assessment of whether Iraq’s </p>
<p>conduct constitutes a failure to take the final opportunity or has constituted a failure </p>
<p>fully to co-operate within the meaning of OP4 such that the basis of the cease-fire </p>
<p>is destroyed. If an assessment is needed of that sort, it would be for the Council to </p>
<p>make it. </p>
<p>“A narrow textual reading of the resolution suggests that sort of assessment is not </p>
<p>needed, because the Council has pre-determined the issue. Public statements, on </p>
<p>the other hand, say otherwise.” </p>
<p><b>554. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote that he remained “of the opinion that the safest legal course </p>
<p>would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force”, </p>
<p>and that he had “already advised” that he did “not believe that such a resolution need be </p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>101</p>
<p>explicit in its terms” if it established that the Council had “concluded” that Iraq had “failed </p>
<p>to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441”. </p>
<p><b>555. </b> Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“Nevertheless, having regard to the information on the negotiating history which </p>
<p>I have been given and to the arguments of the US Administration which I heard in </p>
<p>Washington, I accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is </p>
<p>capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution.”</p>
<p><b>556. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that that would:</p>
<p>“… only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq </p>
<p>has failed to take the final opportunity. In other words, we would need to be able </p>
<p>to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-co-operation. Given the </p>
<p>structure of the resolution as a whole, the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA will be </p>
<p>highly significant in this respect. In the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC, </p>
<p>you will need to consider extremely carefully whether the evidence … is sufficiently </p>
<p>compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity.” </p>
<p><b>557. </b> Lord Goldsmith wrote: </p>
<p>“In reaching my conclusions, I have taken account of the fact that on a number of </p>
<p>previous occasions, including in relation to Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 </p>
<p>and Kosovo in 1999, UK forces have participated in military action on the basis of </p>
<p>advice from my predecessors that the legality of the action under international law </p>
<p>was no more than reasonably arguable.</p>
<p>“But a ‘reasonable case’ does not mean that if the matter ever came before a court </p>
<p>I would be confident that the court would agree with this view. I judge that, having </p>
<p>regard to the arguments on both sides, and considering the resolution as a whole in </p>
<p>the light of the statements made on adoption and subsequently, a court might well </p>
<p>conclude that OPs 4 and 12 do require a further Council decision in order to revive </p>
<p>the authorisation in resolution 678. But equally I consider that the counter view can </p>
<p>reasonably be maintained. </p>
<p>“However, it must be recognised that on previous occasions when military action </p>
<p>was taken on the basis of a reasonably arguable case, the degree of public and </p>
<p>Parliamentary scrutiny of the legal issue was nothing like as great as it is today.”</p>
<p><b>558.  Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March did not present the “reasonable case” </b></p>
<p><b>as stronger or “better” than the opposing case.</b></p>
<p><b>559.  Nevertheless, in making that judgement, Lord Goldsmith took responsibility </b></p>
<p><b>for a decision that a reasonable case was sufficient to provide the legal basis for </b></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>102</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that it was:</p>
<p>“… very clear that the precedent in the United Kingdom was that a reasonable case </p>
<p>was a sufficient lawful basis for taking military action … I checked this at the time, </p>
<p>because this is what I had been told by my officials – it was the basis for the action </p>
<p>in Kosovo, it was also the basis for the action in 1998 … as a matter of precedent </p>
<p>it was standard practice to use the reasonable case basis for deciding on the </p>
<p>lawfulness of military action.”</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>561. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that he was saying that it was “the right test to use”, and </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“… as a matter of precedent it was standard practice to use the reasonable case </p>
<p>basis for deciding on the lawfulness of military action.”</p>
<p><b>562. </b> Asked to explain the meaning of the word “reasonable”, Lord Goldsmith told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“It means a case which not just has some reasoning behind it, put in practical </p>
<p>terms, it is a case that you would be content to argue in court, if it came to it, with </p>
<p>a reasonable prospect of success. It is not making the judgment whether it is right </p>
<p>or wrong …”</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>563. </b> Asked whether the reference in his 7 March advice to action being taken in Iraq in </p>
<p>Operation Desert Fox in 1998 and in Kosovo in 1999 on the basis that the legality of the </p>
<p>action was “reasonably arguable” was a “somewhat lesser standard” than others that he </p>
<p>might have liked to present, Lord Goldsmith replied that the distinction he was making:</p>
<p>“… was between the authority based on the assessment that there was a </p>
<p>reasonable case that it was lawful, to authority which is based upon having balanced </p>
<p>all the arguments and come down on one side or the other, is it, in fact, lawful?”</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>564. </b> Lord Goldsmith added: </p>
<p>“I had originally been not that instinctively in favour of this ‘reasonable case’ </p>
<p>approach, but these precedents were helpful, because, although Kosovo was a </p>
<p>different legal basis, the point was that the British Government had committed itself </p>
<p>to military action on the basis of legal advice that there was a reasonable case. </p>
<p>That was the precedent. It had been pressed upon me that that was the precedent in </p>
<p>the past. </p>

<p>“I can see … that, with hindsight, I was being overly cautious in expressing it in </p>
<p>this way, but that was the precedent that had been used and I went along with it. </p>
<p>Not ‘I went along with it’, I followed the same practice.”</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>565. </b> Asked about his advice to Mr Blair that he could not be confident that a court would </p>
<p>agree with the view that there was a “reasonable case”, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“I think … I’m explaining what I mean by ‘reasonable case’, and this is – if you </p>
<p>like – the ‘yes, but’ point. I wanted to … underline to the Prime Minister that I </p>
<p>was saying that reasonable case is enough. I’m saying it is a reasonable case. </p>
<p>So that is the green light … but I want to underline, ‘Please don’t misunderstand, </p>
<p>a reasonable case doesn’t mean of itself that, if this matter were to go to court, </p>
<p>you would necessarily win’. ‘On the other hand, the counter view can reasonably </p>
<p>be maintained’.”</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>566. </b> Ms Adams told the Inquiry that, when she arrived in Lord Goldsmith’s office, one </p>
<p>of her predecessors had already put together a file of previous Law Officers’ advice on </p>
<p>the use of force over the last “ten years or so” which “contained all the key advice on the </p>
<p>revival argument”.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> In her view, “it was self-evident from this file, that there had been a </p>
<p>number of occasions when the Law Officers had … endorsed … military action on the </p>
<p>basis of a reasonable case”.</p>
<p><b>567. </b> Addressing Lord Goldsmith’s reference to precedent, Ms Adams stated:</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a precedent in the sense of something that had to be followed; it was a </p>
<p>precedent in the sense of something which had, as a matter of fact, taken place.”</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>568. </b> Asked if the term “reasonable case” had a meaning in international law, Ms Adams </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that it did not, it was:</p>
<p>“… one which can be reasonably argued. Obviously, it has to have a reasoned basis </p>
<p>to it because otherwise it is not going to be reasonable to a court. There has to be </p>
<p>a reasonable prospect … of success for this argument, but it doesn’t mean to say </p>
<p>it is the better legal opinion. That would be my interpretation.”</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>569. </b> The Inquiry has seen the advice from the Law Officers on the use of force </p>
<p>described by Ms Adams, in which the formulation “respectable legal argument” is used. </p>
<p><b>570. </b> Asked whether there was any significant difference between a “reasonable case” </p>
<p>and a “respectable legal argument”, Lord Goldsmith wrote that he preferred the former, </p>
<p>though he treated “respectable case” as amounting to the same test in practice, and </p>
<p>“certainly not a higher test”.</p>

<p>104</p>
<p><b>571. </b> Asked how his “characterisation of his 7 March advice as a ‘green light’” sat with </p>
<p>his explanation that a “reasonable case does not mean that if the matter came before </p>
<p>a court” he “would be confident that the court would agree”, Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“I was relying on the precedent established in previous cases that a reasonable </p>
<p>or respectable case was sufficient. Precedent in the Law Officers’ department is </p>
<p>commonly followed. However I was careful to explain what I meant by the phrase </p>
<p>‘reasonable case’ and to highlight in my advice all the difficulties in interpreting the </p>
<p>effect of the resolution.”</p>
<p>224</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that, after delivering his advice of 7 March, he had:</p>
<p>“… continued to reflect on the position and on 13 March 2003 concluded that </p>
<p>the better view was there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further </p>
<p>resolution.”</p>
<p><b>573. </b> Asked how his “characterisation of his 7 March advice as a ‘green light’” sat </p>
<p>“with the number of difficulties with the argument that no further Security Council </p>
<p>determination” was needed which he had identified but not resolved in that advice, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>
<p>“I was well aware of the contrary arguments and had set them out in detail in my </p>
<p>advice. They could not be resolved because the language of the resolution lacked </p>
<p>clarity and the statements made on adoption revealed differences of view within </p>
<p>the Council on the legal effect of the resolution. The issue for me therefore was to </p>
<p>consider whether the argument that the resolution authorised the use of force was </p>
<p>of sufficient weight to reach the threshold of certainty that my predecessors had </p>
<p>concluded was necessary. I concluded that it was and I knew that therefore I was </p>

<p>225</p>
<p><b>574. </b> Asked how his view – that a “reasonable case” was sufficient to decide on the </p>

<p>by the Security Council in the circumstances set out in Chapter VII of the Charter, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith wrote:</p>

<p>that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution </p>
<p>to authorise the use of force … If we had achieved the second resolution that would </p>

<p><b>Other matters dealt with in Lord Goldsmith’s 7 March advice</b></p>
<p><b>575.  Lord Goldsmith reiterated the categorical advice, previously expressed in his </b></p>
<p><b>14 January draft, that there were no grounds for arguing that “an unreasonable </b></p>
<p><b>veto” would permit the US and UK to ignore such a veto. </b></p>
<p><b>576. </b> Addressing the effect of an “unreasonable” veto, Lord Goldsmith stressed:</p>
<p>“The analysis set out above applies whether a second resolution fails to be adopted </p>
<p>because of a lack of votes or because it is vetoed. As I have said before … there are </p>
<p>no grounds for arguing that an ‘unreasonable veto’ would entitle us to proceed on </p>
<p>the basis of a presumed Security Council authorisation. In any event, if the majority </p>
<p>of world opinion remains opposed to military action, it is likely to be difficult on the </p>
<p>facts to categorise a French veto as ‘unreasonable’.” </p>
<p><b>577.  Lord Goldsmith stressed the importance of the circumstances at the time </b></p>
<p><b>a decision was taken. </b></p>
<p><b>578. </b> Addressing the importance of circumstances, Lord Goldsmith concluded:</p>
<p>“The legal analysis may, however, be affected by the course of events over the next </p>
<p>week or so, e.g. the discussions on the draft second resolution. If we fail to achieve </p>
<p>the adoption of a second resolution, we would need to consider urgently at that </p>
<p>stage the strength of our legal case in the light of the circumstances at that time.”</p>
<p><b>579.  Lord Goldsmith recognised that there was a possibility of a legal challenge. </b></p>
<p><b>580. </b> Lord Goldsmith set out the possible consequences of acting without a further </p>
<p>resolution, in particular the ways in which the matter might be brought before a court, </p>
<p>some of which he described as “fairly remote possibilities”. </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Lord Goldsmith outlined the potential risks of action before both International and </p>
<p>UK Courts, concluding:</p>
<p>“… it would not be surprising if some attempts were made to get a case of some </p>
<p>sort off the ground. We cannot be certain that they would not succeed. The GA route </p>

<p>is necessary to achieve that objective; and must be a proportionate response to that </p>

<p>February, I was following precedent in giving the green light again, and I thought, </p>
<p>therefore, the issue was closed, and therefore, if, politically, the decision was taken </p>

<p>230</p>
<p> The article stated that Lord Archer would reject </p>
<p>the position “that resolution 1441 provided sufficient legal authority” for military action. </p>
<p>It also stated that civil servants were understood to be putting pressure on Sir Andrew </p>
<p>Turnbull to show them the Attorney General’s advice.</p>
<p><b>590. </b> On 9 March, an article in the <i>Sunday Times</i> warned that there would be </p>
<p>“a rebellion” of up to 200 Labour MPs if Mr Blair proceeded to military action without </p>
<p>a second UN resolution authorising military action.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>591. </b> The article stated: </p>
<p>“Conservatives urged the Government to say whether Lord Goldsmith, the </p>
<p>Attorney General, had given legal approval for military action to be taken under any </p>
<p>circumstances.”</p>
<p><b>592. </b> In an interview broadcast in the late evening of 9 March as part of the <i>BBC Radio 4 </i></p>
<p><i>Westminster Hour </i>programme, Ms Short was asked if she would resign if there was no </p>
<p>mandate from the UN for war.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> She said:</p>
<p>“Absolutely. There’s no question about that.</p>
<p>“If there is not UN authority for military action or if there is not UN authority for the </p>
<p>reconstruction of the country, I will not uphold a breach of international law or this </p>
<p>undermining of the UN and I will resign from the Government.”</p>

<p>to what the Government’s position would be in the event that three Permanent Members </p>

<p>“We have made it clear throughout that we want a second resolution for political </p>
<p>reasons, because a consensus is required, if we can achieve it, for any military </p>
<p>action. On the legal basis for that, it should be pointed out that resolution 1441 does </p>

<p><b>597. </b> Asked by Mr Simon Thomas (Plaid Cymru) to remind the House “exactly of which </p>
<p>part of resolution 1441 authorises war”, Mr Straw said:</p>
<p>“I am delighted to do so. We start with paragraph 1, which says that the Security </p>
<p>Council ‘Decides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations </p>
<p>under relevant resolutions, including resolution 687 … in particular through Iraq’s </p>
<p>failure to cooperate with United Nations inspectors and the IAEA, and to complete </p>
<p>the actions required under paragraph 8 to 13 of resolution 687’.</p>
<p>“We then go to paragraph 4, in which the Security Council ‘Decides that false </p>
<p>statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by Iraq pursuant to this </p>
<p>resolution and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with, and co-operate fully in </p>
<p>the implementation of, this resolution shall constitute a further material breach of </p>
<p>Iraq’s obligations” – Obligations of which it is now in breach. We turn to operative </p>
<p>paragraph 13, in which the Security Council ‘Recalls, in that context, that the Council </p>
<p>has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its </p>
<p>continued violations of its obligations’.”</p>

<p>Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… had done a long legal opinion and said he did not want TB to present it too </p>
<p>positively. He wanted to make it clear he felt there was a reasonable case for war </p>
<p>under 1441. There was also a case to be made the other way and a lot would </p>
<p>depend on what actually happened. TB also made clear that he did not particularly </p>
<p>want Goldsmith to launch a detailed discussion at Cabinet, though it would have to </p>
<p>happen at some time, and Ministers would want to cross-examine. With the mood </p>
<p>as it was, and with Robin [Cook] and Clare [Short] operating as they were, he knew </p>
<p>that if there was any nuance at all, they would be straight out saying the advice </p>
<p>was that it was not legal, that the AG was casting doubt on the legal basis for war. </p>
<p>Peter Goldsmith was clear that though a lot depended on what happened, he was </p>
<p>casting doubt in some circumstances and if Cabinet had to approve the policy of </p>
<p>going to war, he had to be able to put the reality to them. Sally [Morgan] said it was </p>
<p>for TB to speak to Cabinet, and act on the AG’s advice. He would simply say the </p>
<p>advice said there was a reasonable case. The detailed discussion would follow.</p>
<p>“… Peter G[oldsmith] told TB he had been thinking of nothing else for three weeks, </p>

<p><b>608. </b> Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat </p>

<p>“If no 2nd resolution is adopted (for whatever reason), and the PM decides that </p>

<p>offered by 1441, is he satisfied that the currently proposed use of force would be </p>
<p>lawful under international law?</p>
<p>“Comment: The AG’s minute to the PM is equivocal: he says ‘a reasonable case </p>
<p>can be made’ [for the revival argument] but also says that his view is that ‘different </p>
<p>considerations apply in different circumstances’ [meaning the nature of the Security </p>

<p>“If the answer is yes to the above, can it be assumed that the Attorney will be able </p>
<p>to confirm formally at the time that CDS’s order to implement the planned operation </p>
<p>would be a lawful order (anybody subject to military law commits an offence if he </p>
<p>disobeys any lawful command).</p>
<p>“Comment: Notwithstanding the current uncertainties, when it comes to the crunch, </p>
<p>CDS will need to be assured that his orders are lawful. As the Attorney points out </p>
<p>in his letter, ‘on previous occasions when military action was taken on the basis of </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>620. </b> Mr Straw set out his reasoning in some detail, making clear that it was predicated </p>
<p>on a veto only by France. That was “in practice less likely than two or even three vetoes. </p>
<p>The points made included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The upsides of defying “the” veto had been “well aired”. It would “show at least </p>
<p>we had a ‘moral majority’ with us”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In public comments he and Mr Blair had kept their “options open on what we </p>
<p>should do in the event that the resolution does not carry within the terms of </p>
<p>the [UN] Charter”. That had “been the correct thing to do”. “In private we have </p>
<p>speculated on what to do if we are likely to get nine votes, but be vetoed” by </p>
<p>one or more of the P5.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Although in earlier discussion he had “warmed to the idea” that it was worth </p>
<p>pushing the issue to a vote “if we had nine votes and faced only a French veto”, </p>
<p>the more he “thought about this, the worse an idea it becomes”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The intensive debate over Iraq in the last five months had shown how much </p>
<p>faith people had in the UN as an institution; and that “far from having the ‘moral </p>
<p>majority’ with us … we will lose the moral high ground if we are seen to defy the </p>
<p>very rules and Charter of the UN on which we have lectured others and from </p>
<p>which the UK has disproportionately benefitted”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “best, least risky way to gain a moral majority” was “by the ‘Kosovo route’ </p>
<p>– essentially what I am recommending. The key to our moral legitimacy then </p>
<p>was the matter never went to a vote – but everyone knew the reason for this </p>
<p>was that Russia would have vetoed. (Then, we had no resolution to fall back </p>
<p>on, just customary international law on humanitarianism; here we can fall back </p>
<p>on 1441.)”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The veto had been included in the UN Charter “for a purpose – to achieve </p>
<p>a consensus”. The UK could not “sustain an argument (politically, leave </p>
<p>aside legally) that a distinction can be made between a ‘reasonable’ and an </p>
<p>‘unreasonable’ veto”. That was a completely subjective matter.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The “three recent meetings of the Council more than fulfil the requirement </p>
<p>for immediate consideration of reports of non-compliance. So we can say </p>
<p>convincingly that the process set out in 1441 is complete. If we push a second </p>
<p>resolution to a veto, then the last word on the Security Council record is a formal </p>
<p>rejection of a proposal that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity.”</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Mr Straw advised that it would be “more compelling in Parliament and with public </p>
<p>opinion to take our stand on the basis of 1441, and the overwhelming evidence that Iraq </p>
<p>has not used the four months since then to co-operate ‘immediately, unconditionally </p>
<p>and actively’”; and that the UNMOVIC [clusters] document would be “a material help </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>114</p>
<p><b>622. </b> Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that he interpreted Mr Annan’s “important” statement </p>
<p>on 10 March:</p>
<p>“… essentially as a gypsies’ warning not to try and then fail with a second resolution. </p>
<p>If the last current act of the Security Council on Iraq is 1441, we can genuinely claim </p>
<p>that we have met Kofi’s call for unity and for acting within (our interpretation of) the </p>
<p>authority of the Security Council.”</p>
<p><b>623. </b> There was no reference in the minute to President Chirac’s remarks the previous </p>
<p>evening.</p>
<p><b>624. </b> Mr Straw advised Mr Blair that it would not be possible to decide what the </p>
<p>Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) and the House of Commons would agree until </p>
<p>deliberations in the Security Council had concluded. If a second resolution was agreed </p>
<p>it would be “fine”, but that was “unlikely”. He added:</p>
<p>“I sensed yesterday that sentiment might be shifting our way; but we would need to </p>
<p>be very clear of the result before putting down a resolution approving military action. </p>
<p>We could not possibly countenance the risk of a defeat …</p>
<p>“But it need not be a disaster for you, the Government, and even more important for </p>
<p>our troops, if we cannot take an active part in the initial invasion, provided we get on </p>
<p>the front foot with our strategy.</p>
<p>“I am aware of all the difficulties of the UK standing aside from invasion operations, </p>
<p>not least given the level of integration of our forces with those of the US. But </p>
<p>I understand that the US could if necessary adjust their plan rapidly to cope without </p>
<p>us … [W]e could nevertheless offer them a major UK contribution to the overall </p>
<p>campaign. In addition to staunch political support, this would include: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>intelligence co-operation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>use of Diego Garcia, Fairford and Cyprus, subject to the usual consultation on </p>
<p>targeting;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as soon as combat operations are over, full UK participation in the military and </p>
<p>civilian tasks, including taking responsibility for a sector and for humanitarian </p>
<p>and reconstruction work. We could also take the lead in the UN on securing the </p>
<p>… resolution to authorise the reconstruction effort and the UN role in it which the </p>
<p>US now agree is necessary.”</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“We will obviously need to discuss all this, but I thought it best to put it in your mind </p>
<p>as event[s] could move fast. And what I propose is a great deal better than the </p>
<p>alternatives. When Bush graciously accepted your offer to be with him all the way, </p>
<p>he wanted you alive not dead!”</p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><b>627. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Office had separately replied on 11 March to a request from </p>
<p>Sir David Manning for advice on the implications of the argument that a French veto </p>
<p>would be unreasonable.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>628. </b> In the reply, the FCO advised that there was “no recognised concept of an </p>
<p>‘unreasonable veto’”; and warned that: “In describing a French veto as ‘unreasonable’ </p>
<p>we would therefore be inviting others to describe any future vetoes as ‘unreasonable’ </p>
<p>too.” That could have implications in other areas “such as the Middle East”. In addition, </p>
<p>“describing the veto as unreasonable would make no difference to the legal position”. </p>
<p>There was “no implied condition” in the UN Charter that a veto was valid “only” if it was </p>
<p>reasonable. There was “already pressure at the UN to abolish veto rights”. And pressure </p>
<p>could be expected to increase “if the argument that certain vetoes were ‘unreasonable’ – </p>
<p>and could therefore be ignored – gained ground”. </p>
<p><b>629. </b> The UK was “on record as saying that the veto should only be used with restraint </p>
<p>and in a manner consistent with the principles of the Charter”.</p>
<p><b>Prime Minister’s Questions, 12 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>630.  During Prime Minister’s Questions on 12 March, Mr Blair stated that the UK </b></p>
<p><b>would not do anything which did not have a proper legal basis.</b></p>
<p><b>631. </b> In PMQs on 12 March Mr Blair focused on efforts to secure a second resolution </p>
<p>and the importance for the UN of being seen to act in response to Saddam Hussein’s </p>
<p>failure to co-operate as required by resolution 1441 and of achieving unity in the </p>
<p>international community.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p><b>632. </b> Mr Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats, asked if the Attorney </p>
<p>General had advised that a war in Iraq would be legal in the absence of a second </p>
<p>resolution authorising force; Mr Richard Shepherd (Conservative) asked why a UN </p>
<p>resolution was required; and Mr John Randall (Conservative) asked if Mr Blair would </p>
<p>publish the legal advice.</p>
<p><b>633. </b> In response, the points made by Mr Blair included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>As he had “said on many occasions … we … would not do anything that did </p>
<p>not have a proper legal basis”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Resolution 1441 provided the legal basis and the second resolution was “highly </p>
<p>desirable to demonstrate the will of the international community”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was not the convention to publish legal advice but it was “the convention to </p>
<p>state clearly that we have a legal base for whatever action we take, and … we </p>
<p>must have such a base”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>116</p>
<p><b>634. </b> In response to a question from Mr Kennedy about whether Mr Annan had said that </p>
<p>action without a second resolution would breach the UN Charter, Mr Blair stated that </p>
<p>Mr Annan had said that it was “important that the UN comes together”. Mr Blair added </p>
<p>that it was:</p>
<p>“… complicated to get that agreement … when one nation is saying that whatever </p>
<p>the circumstances it will veto a resolution.” </p>
<p><b>635. </b> Mr Kennedy wrote to Mr Blair later that day repeating his request that Mr Blair </p>

<p><b>636.  A UK proposal for a side statement setting out possible tests for Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>attracted little support amongst Security Council members. </b></p>
<p><b>637. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock suggested early on the afternoon of 12 March that in the </p>
<p>Security Council that day the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>table a revised draft resolution explaining that the UK was “setting aside the </p>
<p>ultimatum concept” in operative paragraph 3 of the draft of 7 March “because </p>
<p>it had not attracted Council support”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>distribute a side statement with tests for Saddam Hussein, “explaining that the </p>
<p>text was a national position to which the UK wanted as many Council Members </p>
<p>as possible to adhere to maintain the pressure on Saddam”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>state that the deadline of the 17 March by which it had been proposed that Iraq </p>
<p>should demonstrate full, immediate and active co-operation in accordance with </p>
<p>resolution 1441 was “being reviewed”.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>638. </b> Sir Jeremy favoured using the open debate in the Security Council later that day </p>
<p>to explain the UK move, adding: “At no point will I signal, in public or in private, that there </p>
<p>is any UK fallback from putting this new text to a vote within 24-36 hours.”</p>
<p><b>639. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had explained the gist of the plan to Ambassador </p>
<p>Negroponte who was briefing Secretary Powell for a conversation with President Bush. </p>
<p><b>640. </b> Sir Jeremy had spoken to Mr Annan and had explained the UK concept of a side </p>
<p>statement and tests which Saddam Hussein could meet “within the tight deadline we </p>
<p>would offer (ideally 10 days)” if he “was serious about disarming”. Council members </p>
<p>“should be able to agree the concept we were offering as a way out of the current </p>
<p>impasse”.</p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>117</p>
<p><b>641. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had stressed that the UK’s objective “was the </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq by peaceful means if possible”. The “aim was to keep a united </p>
<p>Security Council at the centre of attempts to disarm Iraq”, but calls for a “grace period for </p>
<p>Iraq” of 45 days or longer were “out of the question”. The UK would not amend the draft </p>
<p>resolution tabled on 7 March:</p>
<p>“… until it was clear that the new concept had a chance of succeeding. If the Council </p>
<p>was interested, we might be able to move forward in the next day or so; if not, we </p>
<p>would be back on the 7 March text and my instructions were to take a vote soon.” </p>
<p><b>642. </b> Sir Jeremy and Mr Annan had also discussed press reporting of Mr Annan’s </p>
<p>comments (on 10 March), “to the effect that military action without a Council </p>
<p>authorisation would violate the UN Charter”. Mr Annan said that he had been:</p>
<p>“… misquoted: he had not been attempting an interpretation of 1441 but merely </p>
<p>offering, in answer to a specific question, obvious thoughts about the basic structure </p>
<p>of the Charter. Nevertheless the Council was seized of the Iraq problem and working </p>
<p>actively on it. It had not yet reached a decision to authorise force; how … could it be </p>
<p>right for some Member States to take the right to use force into their own hands?” </p>
<p><b>643. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had “remonstrated that the Council was in paralysis: </p>
<p>at least one Permanent Member had threatened to veto ‘in any circumstances’. </p>
<p>The Council was not shouldering its responsibilities.” </p>
<p><b>644. </b> Asked what the UK would do if it failed to get even nine votes, Sir Jeremy said:</p>
<p>“… we would have to consider the next steps; but we believed we had a basis for </p>
<p>the use of force in existing resolutions (based on the revival of the 678 authorisation </p>
<p>by the material breach finding in OP1 of 1441, coupled with Iraq’s manifest failure to </p>
<p>take the final opportunity offered to it in that resolution) … OP12 … did not in terms </p>
<p>require another decision. This was not an accidental oversight: it had been the basis </p>
<p>of the compromise that led to the adoption of the resolution.”</p>
<p><b>645. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that he had “urged” Mr Annan “to be cautious about allowing </p>
<p>his name to be associated too closely with one legal view of a complicated and difficult </p>
<p>issue”. </p>
<p><b>646. </b> At Mr Annan’s suggestion, Sir Jeremy subsequently gave the UN Office of Legal </p>
<p>Affairs a copy of Professor Greenwood’s memorandum to the FAC of October 2002 and </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s evidence to the FAC on 4 March 2003.</p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Straw’s evidence to the FAC is referred to in more detail in Section 3.7.</p>
<p><b>648. </b> Sir Jeremy reported that Mr Annan had said “several times” that he “understood” </p>
<p>what Mr Straw and Mr Blair “were trying to do, and expressed sympathy for the </p>
<p>tough situation you found yourselves in”. Sir Jeremy reported that Mr José Maria </p>
<p>Aznar, the Spanish Prime Minister, was “in a similar predicament”. The “US did not </p>

<p>always realise how comments intended by US politicians for US domestic audiences </p>
<p>seriously damaged the position of their friends in other countries”. In a conversation </p>
<p>with President Chirac on 12 March, Mr Annan had “found him ‘tough but not closed’ to </p>
<p>possible compromises”. </p>
<p><b>649. </b> On the same day Mr Straw informed Mr Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister, </p>
<p>that the UK was about to table a revised resolution, omitting the paragraph from the </p>
<p>7 March draft which contained the deadline of 17 March for Iraq to demonstrate that it </p>
<p>had taken the final opportunity offered in resolution 1441 to comply with its obligations.</p>

<p><b>had prevented a resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>651.  Much of the discussion focused on managing UK politics.</b></p>
<p><b>652.  Mr Blair recognised that it would not be possible to agree a compromise </b></p>
<p><b>in the Security Council before 17 March and that the US would not extend the </b></p>

<p>to a meeting of Security Council members in New York on the evening of 12 March.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The draft omitted an identified date for a deadline and included the addition of a final </p>
<p>clause stating: </p>
<p>“The United Kingdom reserves its position if Iraq fails to take the steps required of it.”</p>
<p><b>658. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that the initiative had resulted in:</p>
<p>“</p>

<p>• </p>

<p>258</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>659. </b> But:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK had not achieved “any kind of breakthrough. The French, Germans </p>

<p>first steps had been taken. The non-permanent members of the Security Council were </p>
<p>uncomfortable with a situation where, “following the French decision to veto”, the </p>
<p>Permanent Members were “not shouldering their responsibilities properly”. The “outcome </p>
<p>in the Security Council remained open”. If the United Nations process broke down, </p>
<p>difficult decisions would be required and there would be another Cabinet meeting at </p>
<p>which the Attorney General would be present.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>665. </b> Mr Straw said that, although there were differences between members of the </p>
<p>Security Council, “none was saying that Iraq was complying with its international </p>
<p>obligations”; and that it “followed that Iraq continued to be in material breach” of those </p>
<p>obligations. </p>
<p><b>666. </b> On the legal basis for military action, Mr Straw said that he “was already on record </p>
<p>setting out the position to the Foreign Affairs Committee”. Mr Straw rehearsed the </p>
<p>negotiating history of the resolution 1441, stating that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“the French and Russians had wanted a definition of what would constitute a </p>
<p>material breach, but had settled for the facts being presented to the Security </p>
<p>Council”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“they had also wanted a statement that explicit authorisation was required for </p>
<p>military action and instead had settled for further consideration by the Security </p>
<p>Council …”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>failure by Iraq to comply with resolution 1441 “revived the authorisations </p>
<p>existing” in resolutions 678 (1990) and 687 (1991).</p>
<p><b>667. </b> Mr Straw noted that the Government’s supporters had “a clear preference” for </p>
<p>a second resolution but it “had not been seen as an absolute necessity”. There had </p>
<p>been “good progress” in New York in “gaining the support of uncertain non-permanent </p>
<p>members of the Security Council, including Mexico and Chile”. </p>
<p><b>668. </b> Quoting from her diary, Ms Short wrote that she had asked for “a special Cabinet </p>
<p>with the Attorney General present” and this had been agreed. She also reported saying, </p>
<p>“if we have UN mandate, possible progress on Palestine/Israel and try with the second </p>
<p>resolution process, it would make a big difference”. She was “hopeful of progress”.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p><b>669. </b> Ms Short had been advised by Mr Suma Chakrabarti, the DFID Permanent </p>
<p>Secretary, that she should focus her intervention in Cabinet on the need for “a proper </p>
<p>decision-making process”, which would be “important both in substance and … for the </p>
<p>politics”. In his view, there were two key points to make:</p>
<p>“Cabinet needs to discuss now the legal opinion of the Attorney General and how </p>
<p>to make it public. This is vital for Ministers, our Armed Services and the Civil Service.</p>

<p>the Attorney General. Either the Attorney has advised that to wage war in defiance </p>

<p>that it is not. The difference is very important and the public has a right to know </p>

<p><b>676. </b> MPs raised the issue of the Attorney General’s advice later that day when Mr Robin </p>
<p>Cook, Leader of the House of Commons, described the business of the House in the </p>
<p>week to follow.</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Mr Eric Forth (Conservative) asked:</p>
<p>“Given that there is an increasing belief that the Attorney General’s advice may </p>
<p>well be against military action by this country, certainly if that takes place without </p>
<p>United Nations cover, may we please have a statement in the House by the Solicitor </p>
<p>General … as to the position with regard to the advice being given to the Prime </p>
<p>Minister and the Government by the Attorney General on the legality of military </p>
<p>action in Iraq?”</p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Welcoming Conservative support for Mr Kennedy’s request for access to the </p>
<p>Attorney General’s advice, Mr Paul Tyler (Liberal Democrat) stated:</p>
<p>“… is it not right that the Law Officers are answerable to Parliament, not to the </p>
<p>Government of the day. Surely it must be an exceptional circumstance when very </p>
<p>important issues of international law are being challenged in the way implied by </p>
<p>the Secretary-General of the United Nations? Should there not be a second Security </p>
<p>Council resolution, is it not absolutely essential that the Law Officers make a </p>
<p>statement prior to any debate in this House?”</p>
<p>267</p>
<p><b>679. </b> Several MPs made reference to the authoritative work <i>Parliamentary Practice</i> </p>

<p>Thomas Erskine May’s <i>Parliamentary Practice</i> is an authoritative source of information </p>
<p>and guidance on Parliamentary practice and procedure and British constitutional law. </p>
<p>The 22nd edition, current in 2001, contained the following paragraph entitled “Law officer’s </p>
<p>opinions”:</p>
<p>“The opinions of the law officers of the Crown, being confidential, are not usually laid </p>
<p>before Parliament, cited in debate or provided in evidence before a select committee, </p>
<p>and their production has frequently been refused; but if a Minister deems it expedient </p>
<p>that such opinions should be made known for the information of the House, he is </p>
<p>entitled to cite them in the debate.”</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>680. </b> Mr Andrew Mackay (Conservative) asked:</p>
<p>“… is it not very important indeed that the Prime Minister should let us see this legal </p>

<p><b>681. </b> Referring to the fact there were precedents for the disclosure of the Law Officers’ </p>
<p>advice, Mrs Alice Mahon (Labour) said: “In these circumstances – these exceptional </p>
<p>circumstances – it is absolutely vital that we get that advice.”</p>
<p><b>682. </b> Mr Andrew Mitchell (Conservative) said that the Prime Minister “should bring into </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>683. </b> Mr Robert Wareing (Labour) asked:</p>
<p>“Is it not imperative that we have a statement about the advice given by the Attorney </p>
<p>General? Members of Parliament who vote for an aggressive war launched by </p>
<p>America and its collaborators and may be culpable and may be committing an </p>
<p>offence if the Attorney General’s advice were that Britain was going against </p>

<p><b>685.  Lord Goldsmith informed his officials on 13 March that, after further </b></p>
<p><b>reflection, he had concluded earlier that week that on balance the “better view” </b></p>
<p><b>was that there was a legal basis for the use of force without a further resolution.</b></p>
<p><b>686.  Lord Goldsmith reached this view after he had been asked by both Admiral </b></p>
<p><b>Boyce and Ms Juliet Wheldon, the Treasury Solicitor, to give a clear-cut answer </b></p>
<p><b>on whether the “reasonable case” was lawful rather than unlawful. </b></p>
<p><b>687.  This view was the basis on which military action was taken. </b></p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Martin Hemming had written to Mr Brummell on 12 March stating:</p>
<p>“It is clear that legal controversy will undoubtedly surround the announcement of </p>
<p>any decision by the Government to proceed to military action in the absence of the </p>
<p>adoption of a further resolution by the UN Security Council. The CDS is naturally </p>
<p>concerned to be assured that his order to commit UK Armed Forces to the conflict </p>
<p>in such circumstances would be a lawful order by him. I have informed the CDS that </p>
<p>if the Attorney General has advised that he is satisfied that the proposed military </p>
<p>action by the UK would be in accordance with national and international law, he </p>
<p>[CDS] can properly give his order committing UK forces. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>“In view of the rapidly developing situation, I thought that the Attorney would wish </p>
<p>to know what I have said on this question.”</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>689. </b> Lord Goldsmith met Mr Brummell and Ms Adams at 1300 on 13 March.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>690. </b> In a minute approved by Lord Goldsmith, Mr Brummell wrote that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>had told him that:</p>
<p>“… he had been giving further careful consideration to his view of the legal basis for </p>
<p>the use of force against Iraq … It was clear … that there was a sound basis for the </p>
<p>revival argument in principle …</p>
<p>“The question was whether the conditions for the operation of the revival doctrine </p>
<p>applied in this case. The Attorney confirmed that, after further reflection, he had </p>
<p>come to the clear view that on balance the better view was that the conditions for the </p>
<p>operation of the revival argument were met in this case, i.e. there was a lawful basis </p>
<p>for the use of force without a further resolution beyond resolution 1441.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>691. </b> Addressing the key provisions of resolution 1441, Mr Brummell reported that </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had stated: </p>
<p>“… the crucial point … was that OP12 did not stipulate that there should be a further </p>
<p>decision of the SC before military action was taken, but simply provided for reports </p>
<p>of any further breaches by Iraq to be considered by the SC. In the absence of a </p>
<p>further decision by the SC, the Attorney General thought that the better view was </p>
<p>that resolution 1441 itself revived resolution 678 and provided the legal basis for </p>
<p>use of force. (It was, moreover plain that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity </p>
<p>afforded to it and continued to be in material breach: not a single member of the </p>
<p>SC considered that Iraq had complied.)” </p>
<p><b>692. </b> Lord Goldsmith had:</p>
<p>“… fully taken into account the contrary arguments. In coming to his concluded view </p>
<p>… he had been greatly assisted by the background material he had seen on the </p>
<p>history of the negotiation of resolution 1441 and his discussions with both Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock and the US lawyers …” </p>
<p><b>693. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s view was:</p>
<p>“It was apparent from this background material that members of the Council were </p>
<p>well aware that a finding of material breach by the SC was tantamount to authorising </p>
<p>the use of force (through the operation of the revival doctrine). It was for this very </p>
<p>reason that the French had been keen to avoid the finding of a material breach </p>

<p>and had argued for the fire-break provision in OP2, so as to prevent automaticité. </p>
<p>And in relation to OP12 it was evident that the French, who had pressed hard for </p>
<p>a reference to a ‘decision’ (as a pre-condition to use of force), appreciated that, as </p>
<p>the final text provided only for the SC to ‘consider’ Iraq’s further breaches, the way </p>
<p>was left open for the operation of the revival argument in the event that the SC did </p>
<p>not come to any decision.”</p>
<p><b>694. </b> Lord Goldsmith had:</p>
<p>“… explained that in his minute of 7 March he had wanted to make sure that the </p>
<p>Prime Minister was fully aware of the competing arguments. He was clear in his </p>
<p>own mind, however, that the better view was that there was a legal basis without </p>
<p>a second resolution. He had come to this concluded view earlier in the week.” </p>
<p><b>695. </b> Lord Goldsmith and Mr Brummell agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be proper for Mr Brummell to confirm to Mr Hemming that the proposed </p>
<p>military action would be in accordance with national and international law.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It would be necessary to prepare a statement setting out the Attorney’s view </p>
<p>of the legal position which could be deployed at Cabinet and in Parliament the </p>
<p>following week. </p>
<p><b>696. </b> Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Hemming on 14 March to “confirm” that Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>was “satisfied that the proposed military action by the UK would be in accordance with </p>

<p>277</p>
<p><b>699. </b> In his memoir, Gen Jackson wrote that the Chiefs of Staff had discussed the issue </p>
<p>of the legal basis for military action and “collectively agreed that we needed to be sure </p>
<p>of the ground”.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> Adm Boyce had “on behalf of us all, sought the Attorney General’s </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>126</p>
<p><b>701. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he had reached his “better view” after he had </p>
<p>received a letter from the Ministry of Defence stating that Adm Boyce needed “a yes or </p>
<p>no answer” on whether military action would be lawful and, as requested by Sir Andrew </p>
<p>Turnbull, a visit from Ms Wheldon asking the same question on behalf of the Civil </p>
<p>Service.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p><b>702. </b> Lord Boyce told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the propriety and/or the legality of what we were about to do was obviously a </p>
<p>concern of mine, not least of it, since, somewhat against my better instincts, we had </p>
<p>signed up to the ICC [International Criminal Court]. I always made it perfectly clear to </p>
<p>the Prime Minister face-to-face, and, indeed, to the Cabinet, that if we were invited </p>
<p>to go into Iraq, we had to have a good legal basis for doing so, which obviously </p>
<p>a second resolution would have completely nailed.”</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>703. </b> Lord Boyce added:</p>
<p>“… that wasn’t new, it was something which I had told the Prime Minister that I would </p>
<p>need at the end of the day, long before March. This is back in January when we </p>
<p>started to commit our forces out there, and, as you say, I received that assurance. </p>
<p>This was an important issue, particularly because of the speculation in the press </p>
<p>about the legality or otherwise and, as far as I was concerned particularly for my </p>
<p>constituency, in other words, soldiers, sailors and airmen and their families had to be </p>
<p>told that what they were doing was legal. So it formed the first line of my Operational </p>
<p>Directive which I signed on 20 March, and it was important for me just to have a </p>
<p>one-liner, because that was what was required, as far as I was concerned, from </p>
<p>the Government Law Officer, which, as you say, I received.”</p>
<p>282</p>
<p><b>704. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… there were a number of things which happened after 7 March. It was becoming </p>
<p>clear, though it hadn’t yet become definitive, that the second resolution was going </p>
<p>to be very difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>“… But most importantly … I had been presented with a letter which had come from </p>
<p>the Ministry of Defence, which reflected the view of CDS, and which was … calling </p>
<p>for this clear view, a yes or no answer, as I think he has put it. </p>
<p>“At about the same time, I also received a visit from Juliet Wheldon … the Treasury </p>
<p>Solicitor. I understood her to be speaking on behalf of the Civil Service, and, indeed, </p>
<p>from what I now know, I suspect, believe, she would at least have been encouraged </p>
<p>to do that by the Cabinet Secretary on behalf of the Civil Service. </p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>“Both of them in a sense were saying the same thing. They were saying, ‘We are </p>
<p>potentially at risk personally if we participate’, or, in the case of the Civil Service, </p>
<p>‘assist in war, if it turns out to be unlawful, and therefore, we want to know whether </p>
<p>the Attorney’s view is yes or no, lawful’. </p>
<p>“That seemed to me to be actually a very reasonable approach for them to take …”</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>705. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he:</p>
<p>“… very quickly saw that actually this wasn’t satisfactory from their point of view. </p>
<p>They deserved more … than my saying there was a reasonable case. </p>
<p>“So, therefore it was important for me to come down clearly on one side of the </p>
<p>argument or the other, which is what I proceeded to do.”</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>706. </b> Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“… until the Civil Service and the … Services said they wanted this clear view, I </p>
<p>was working … I take full responsibility for this, but it was with the approval of my </p>
<p>office on the basis that saying there was a reasonable case was a green light. It was </p>
<p>sufficient for the Government, and if the Cabinet and, as it turns out, the House of </p>
<p>Commons, took the view that it was the right thing to do, then we had done enough </p>
<p>to explain what the legal basis was and to justify it. </p>
<p>“But when they came with their request, I then saw that actually that wasn’t fair </p>
<p>on them.” </p>
<p><b>707. </b> Asked how the case had suddenly become stronger, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“It is the decision you make about it. You make a judgment. You say ‘I’m asked to </p>
<p>advise whether there is a reasonable case’, and you examine all the evidence and </p>
<p>you say, ‘Yes there is a reasonable case’. You don’t need to go any further, and in </p>
<p>that respect, I can see with hindsight, that I was being overly cautious. </p>
<p>“Then somebody says to you, ‘Actually, I don’t want to know whether you say there </p>
<p>is a reasonable case, I want to know whether or not you consider that it will be </p>
<p>lawful.’ </p>
<p>“Well, I regard that as a different question and you then have to answer it.”</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>708. </b> Asked why he was able to give the Armed Forces a more certain answer without </p>
<p>providing more legal arguments, Lord Goldsmith replied:</p>
<p>“Well, not on the basis of more legal argument, but on the basis of asking a different </p>
<p>question. This is, in a sense, why I’m saying ‘with hindsight’. I would have liked to </p>

<p>wanted more, they wanted an unequivocal answer. Had I known that, then I would </p>
<p>have approached the question differently, and I’m simply saying that I was cautious </p>
<p>in not going further than I needed to do on 7 March.”</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>709. </b> Asked whether the difficulties in the Security Council had made it more important </p>
<p>to know if there was a sufficient legal basis for military action, Lord Goldsmith replied: </p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>287</p>
<p><b>710. </b> Asked whether Mr Blair had asked him to come up with a definitive position, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I don’t recall it that way. The way it may have been seen by others or interpreted </p>
<p>by others or recollected by others, I don’t know, but I don’t recall the Prime Minister </p>
<p>asking for that, no, definitely not.”</p>
<p>288</p>
<p><b>711. </b> Asked whether the huge pressure on the Government, including Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>personal future, had weighed on him, Lord Goldsmith said:</p>
<p>“The consequences for the Government did not … What did matter to me, of course, </p>
<p>was the United Kingdom as a country and the people that we would have been </p>
<p>asking to take part in this with a potential personal responsibility, and I did believe </p>
<p>it was right to respond to the request from the head of the Armed Services … That </p>
<p>weighed with me.”</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>712. </b> Asked whether the possibility of troops who had been deployed to the area being </p>
<p>withdrawn as a consequence of his advice weighed upon him Lord Goldsmith said: </p>
<p>“No. Those sorts of consequences are not what the lawyer has to take into account. </p>
<p>What the lawyer has to do is to weigh up the arguments and evidence carefully </p>
<p>and reach what he believes is the correct legal view, whatever the consequences </p>
<p>may be.”</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>713. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair what discussions he or others under his instruction had </p>
<p>with Lord Goldsmith between 7 March, when he had received Lord Goldsmith’s formal </p>
<p>advice, and 13 March. Mr Blair said:</p>
<p>“I can’t recall any specific discussions that I had. I don’t know whether others would </p>
<p>have had with him before 13 March, but essentially what happened was this: he </p>
<p>gave legal advice, he gave an opinion saying, ‘Look, there is this argument against </p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>Preparing the legal case</b></p>
<p><b>715.  Lord Goldsmith had several meetings on the afternoon of 13 March. </b></p>
<p><b>716.  The primary purpose of the meetings appears to have been discussion </b></p>
<p><b>of the arrangements for preparing statements on the legal basis for action for </b></p>

<p>debate in the House of Commons on 18 March.</p>
<p><b>719. </b> Mr Brummell recorded that Lord Goldsmith had agreed on 13 March to explore </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>“Is the revival argument valid?”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Is resolution 1441 sufficient?” </p>
<p>A “conference” with Lord Goldsmith had been arranged for 1630 that afternoon.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> Lord Goldsmith met Lord Mayhew, the Conservative Attorney General from  </p>
<p>1987 to 1992, late on the afternoon of 13 March.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p><b>724. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that Lord Mayhew had asked for the meeting </p>
<p>because he had wanted, and been given, Lord Goldsmith’s view; and that in the </p>
<p>debate on the legality of the use of force in Iraq in the House of Lords on 17 March, </p>
<p>Lord Mayhew had professed himself in agreement with Lord Goldsmith’s view.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>725. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s meeting with Lord Mayhew was followed by one with Mr Straw, </p>
<p>which Mr Brummell also attended.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>726. </b> In what was described as a “lengthy meeting”, Lord Goldsmith was reported to </p>
<p>have said that “having decided to come down on one side (1441 is sufficient), he had </p>
<p>also decided that in public he needed to explain his case as strongly and unambiguously </p>
<p>as possible”.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> A legal team under Professor Greenwood was “now working” on that. </p>
<p>Mr Straw arranged for Mr Macleod and Mr Patrick Davies, one of his former Private </p>
<p>Secretaries, to join the team.</p>
<p><b>727. </b> Mr Straw’s request that the team should produce a draft letter explaining the legal </p>
<p>position for him to send to the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) had </p>
<p>been agreed. Mr Straw’s Private Office also recorded that Lord Goldsmith had said </p>
<p>“he thought he might need to tell Cabinet when it met on 17 March that the legal issues </p>
<p>were finely balanced”. </p>
<p><b>728. </b> The record stated that Mr Straw had responded by saying that Lord Goldsmith:</p>
<p>“… needed to be aware of the problem of leaks from … Cabinet. It would be </p>
<p>better, surely, if the Attorney General distributed the draft letter from the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary to the FAC as the basic standard text of his position and then made a few </p>
<p>comments. The Attorney General agreed.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>730. </b> Asked if the record of the meeting on 13 March made by Mr Straw’s Private Office </p>

<p>Morgan wrote that the purpose of the meetings was to share information.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> Her role </p>
<p>was to explain her perception of the Parliamentary and political mood. She was aware </p>
<p>of claims that she had somehow exerted pressure on the Attorney General to alter </p>

<p>equivocation that such allegations were untrue:</p>
<p>“… at no point during any discussion at which I was present did I witness any effort </p>

<p><b>740. </b> On the UN draft resolution, Mr Blair commented that the “haggling over texts </p>
<p>in New York was frustrating and muddied the waters. But it was buying the vital time </p>
<p>we needed this weekend.”</p>
<p><b>741. </b> A discussion on the military timetable was reported separately.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> It was envisaged </p>
<p>that the withdrawal of the resolution on 17 March would be followed by a speech </p>
<p>from President Bush which would give Saddam Hussein an ultimatum to leave within </p>
<p>48 hours. President Bush would call for freedom for the Iraqi people and outline the legal </p>

<p><b>742. </b> There would be no military action before a vote in the UK Parliament on 18 March. </p>

<p><b>Confirmation of Mr Blair’s view</b></p>
<p><b>The exchange of letters on 14 and 15 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>743.  On 14 March, Lord Goldsmith asked for confirmation of Mr Blair’s view </b></p>
<p><b>that Iraq had “committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] </b></p>
<p><b>paragraph 4 of resolution 1441”.</b></p>
<p><b>744. </b> Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on 14 March:</p>
<p>“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further resolution </p>
<p>of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq has failed to comply </p>
<p>with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 and has thus </p>
<p>failed to take the final opportunity offered by the Security Council in that resolution. </p>
<p>The Attorney General understands that it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s </p>
<p>view that Iraq has committed further material breaches as specified in [operative] </p>
<p>paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, but as this is a judgement for the Prime Minister, </p>
<p>the Attorney would be grateful for confirmation that this is the case.”</p>
<p>309</p>
<p><b>745.  In his response on 15 March, Mr Rycroft recorded that it was Mr Blair’s </b></p>

<p><b>746. </b> Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on 15 March:</p>

<p>310</p>
<p><b>747.  Lord Goldsmith gave evidence to the Inquiry about the purpose of this </b></p>
<p><b>exchange of letters.</b></p>
<p><b>748. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… if this ever came to court … we would have to persuade a court of our </p>
<p>interpretation of 1441, but they would also say, ‘What’s the evidence that they [Iraq] </p>
<p>did actually fail?’, and I was saying, at that stage, there needs to be strong factual </p>
<p>evidence of failure.”</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>749. </b> Lord Goldsmith described a briefing from Mr John Scarlett focused on the question </p>
<p>of Iraqi compliance:</p>
<p>“… the clear intelligence, the clear advice I was being given by him was that </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein in Iraq had not complied with the resolution, not just that there </p>
<p>were specific elements of … serious non-co-operation, including, for example, </p>
<p>intimidation of potential interviewees …”</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>750. </b> Asked what his opinion was on the weight of the intelligence, Lord Goldsmith </p>
<p>replied:</p>
<p>“At the end of the day … like any lawyer who is dependent upon the facts from his </p>
<p>client - I was dependent upon the assessment by the Government which had all </p>
<p>the resources it had … and that was why I particularly wanted to be sure … the </p>
<p>week before the events, that the Prime Minister, who did have access to all that </p>
<p>information, was of the view that there had been a failure.”</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>751. </b> Lord Goldsmith stated that the UK Government did not have to decide whether </p>
<p>there had been a material breach, because: </p>
<p>“… the pre-determination had been made [by the Security Council in resolution </p>
<p>1441] that if there was a failure, it would be a material breach … we had to decide </p>
<p>whether there was a failure but, if there was a failure, then the Security Council’s </p>
<p>pre-determination would come in and clothe that with the character of material </p>
<p>breach.”</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>752. </b> Addressing the purpose of seeking Mr Blair’s views, Lord Goldsmith stated:</p>
<p>“First of all, because it did depend upon the failure, it was important to point out </p>
<p>you need to be satisfied about that and secondly, I wanted the Prime Minister, </p>

<p>consciously and deliberately to focus on that question. I wanted it to be a question </p>
<p>that he would really apply his mind to. Forgive me for even suggesting that he </p>
<p>wouldn’t have done. That wasn’t the point. That he should have focused his mind </p>
<p>on whether there was, in fact, a failure, and that was the purpose of saying, ‘I want </p>
<p>this in writing’, it was so there was a really conscious consideration of that.”</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>753. </b> Lord Goldsmith later stated:</p>
<p>“I think I’m saying two things. First of all, I wasn’t actually saying there needed to be </p>
<p>a declaration by him [Mr Blair]. I was saying ‘You need to be satisfied. You need to </p>
<p>judge that there really is a failure to take the final opportunity. You need to judge that </p>
<p>on the basis of the resources, the intelligence and the information that you have got’ </p>
<p>… This was going to be a very controversial decision, whichever way it went. There </p>
<p>would be a lot of scrutiny. We had had sort of legal actions bubbling up already. </p>
<p>So, ‘whereas in the past a reasonable case was sufficient, you can expect a degree </p>
<p>of scrutiny on this occasion’.”</p>
<p>316</p>

<p>318</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>756. </b> In response to the question whether Mr Blair could decide if Iraq was in further </p>
<p>material breach of resolution 1441, Lord Goldsmith wrote: “No.”</p>
<p>319</p>
<p><b>757. </b> Lord Goldsmith added:</p>
<p>“Only the Security Council could decide whether or not a particular failure or set of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>136</p>
<p><b>758. </b> Lord Goldsmith’s view that resolution 1441 authorised the use of force relied on </p>
<p>the conclusion that OP4:</p>
<p>“… constituted a determination in advance that if the particular set of circumstances </p>
<p>specified in it arose, so that Iraq failed to take the final opportunity it had been given, </p>
<p>that would constitute a further material breach.</p>
<p>“The resolution therefore constituted authority for the use of force provided that </p>
<p>such a factual situation had occurred, namely that Iraq had failed to comply with </p>
<p>and co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution. In that event a Council </p>
<p>discussion would need to take place. </p>
<p>“I had concluded that in any such Council discussion the assessment contemplated </p>
<p>by OP4 was not an assessment of the quality of the breaches, since the Council </p>
<p>had already resolved that any failure on Iraq’s part would constitute a material </p>
<p>breach, but rather an assessment of the situation as a result of those breaches </p>
<p>having occurred … Accordingly, the Council did not need to conclude that breaches </p>
<p>had taken place (though I believe that at the discussion no member of the Security </p>
<p>Council took the view that they had not occurred). </p>
<p>“Nonetheless the authorisation in resolution 678 could not revive unless in fact </p>
<p>breaches had occurred. We needed therefore to be satisfied that this factual </p>
<p>situation existed, and to be in a position if necessary to justify that to a court. </p>
<p>That was why I said … that there would have to be strong factual grounds for </p>
<p>concluding that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity.”</p>

<p><b>761. </b> Mr Blair told the Liaison Committee on 21 January 2003 that, if the reported breach </p>
<p>was a pattern of behaviour rather than conclusive proof would require “more considered </p>
<p>judgement”.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p><b>762.  As the Inquiry indicates in Sections 3.7 and 3.8, Mr Blair and his advisers in </b></p>
<p><b>No.10 had been very closely involved, particularly since the beginning of March, </b></p>
<p><b>in examining the reports of the UN weapons inspectors and had access to advice </b></p>
<p><b>from the JIC on the activities of the Iraqi regime. </b></p>
<p><b>763.  In his 7 March advice Lord Goldsmith had advised that Mr Blair “would have </b></p>
<p><b>to consider extremely carefully whether the evidence of non-co-operation and </b></p>
<p><b>non-compliance by Iraq [was] sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq had failed to take its final opportunity”.</b></p>
<p><b>764.  But Mr Blair did not seek and did not receive considered advice from </b></p>
<p><b>across government specifically examining whether the evidence was “sufficiently </b></p>
<p><b>compelling” to provide the basis for a judgement of this magnitude and </b></p>
<p><b>seriousness. </b></p>
<p><b>765.  In mid-March, UNMOVIC was reporting increased co-operation, and the </b></p>
<p><b>IAEA had confirmed that Iraq had no nuclear weapons or nuclear weapons </b></p>
<p><b>programmes.</b></p>
<p><b>766.  The Inquiry has not seen any evidence of consideration of whether the </b></p>
<p><b>reports by UNMOVIC and the IAEA to the Security Council during January to </b></p>
<p><b>March 2003 constituted reports to the Council under OP11 of resolution 1441; or </b></p>
<p><b>whether the subsequent Security Council discussions constituted “consideration” </b></p>
<p><b>as required by OP12.</b></p>
<p><b>767.  There was clearly no majority support in the Security Council for a </b></p>

<p>requested by Lord Goldsmith, Mr Blair told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“We went back over the Blix reports and it was very obvious to me, particularly on </p>
<p>the subject of interviews, that they weren’t co-operating. They were co-operating </p>
<p>more, as you rightly say. They started to give out a little bit more, but there was </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>138</p>
<p>absolutely nothing to suggest that this co-operation was full, immediate and </p>
<p>unconditional. It was actually not full, not immediate. In fact, even Blix himself said </p>
<p>it wasn’t immediate even on 7 March and was not unconditional. </p>
<p>“In addition to that I had I think JIC Assessments as well … where it was clear that </p>
<p>Saddam was putting heavy pressure internally on people not to co-operate …”</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>770. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Blair whether the process had involved only No.10 or if he </p>
<p>had consulted more widely, Mr Blair stated:</p>
<p>“I am sure I would have spoken to Jack [Straw] particularly at the time … I don’t </p>
<p>recollect … This literally was the whole time a conversation … [O]ur view was </p>
<p>that he [Saddam Hussein] was not co-operating in the terms of 1441, and that … </p>
<p>remains my view today that he wasn’t, and that he … never had any intention of </p>
<p>doing that.</p>
<p>“Now it is correct … that he was offering up more, but … even in February he wasn’t </p>
<p>offering up what they were asking him.”</p>
<p>327</p>
<p><b>771. </b> Asked whether he was comfortable with the situation whereby the Prime Minister </p>
<p>confirmed the existence of a further material breach at a time when the head of the IAEA </p>
<p>had reported there was no nuclear programme and the head of UNMOVIC was reporting </p>
<p>improved co-operation. Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“Yes … and if I had not been I wouldn’t have stayed in the Cabinet …”</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>772. </b> Mr Straw added that the two tests in OP4 were “conjunctive” not “disjunctive”, </p>
<p>and that:</p>
<p>“What OP4 talks about is false statements or omissions in the declarations. Well, the </p>
<p>declaration was incomplete. There was no question about that. And … </p>
<p>“… They did fail to comply fully. The obligation on them was not to comply a bit … </p>
<p>The obligation on Iraq was to comply fully. It is a positive obligation on them, not </p>

<p>on Lord Goldsmith’s behalf regarding the FCO paper being prepared:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Demonstration of breaches of UNSCR 1441 are critical to our legal case. </p>
<p>Therefore we must be scrupulously careful to ensure that the best examples </p>
<p>of non-compliance are referred to.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It would be distinctly unhelpful to our legal case if the examples of </p>
<p>non-compliance … were weak or inadequate; and it would be difficult – indeed </p>
<p>it would be too late – to seek to add further (better) examples ‘after the event’.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The FCO needed to check the document they were preparing “very carefully” </p>
<p>and subject it to “the tightest scrutiny”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The document should include “a caveat … acknowledging that the examples </p>
<p>of non-compliance … were not exhaustive but illustrative”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The submission to Mr Straw should reflect those points.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>785. </b> Mr Brummell’s record of his conversation with Ms Owen on 14 March also </p>
<p>stated that he had been informed that the FCO paper would be sent out with a letter </p>

<p>would also contain a “one page” summary of the legal position, which was “news” to </p>

<p>“Firstly there was the drafting of the Parliamentary answer. Secondly there was the </p>
<p>drafting of the longer note that the Foreign Secretary sent to members of Parliament, </p>
<p>the so-called Foreign Office note, but it was drafted at the Attorney’s … </p>
<p>“I think I was more or less on the sidelines, because my views were known, but </p>
<p>I probably did read through the drafts and no doubt in my usual way made editorial </p>
<p>suggestions and the like, but I don’t think I had a major part in the preparation of </p>
<p>those questions of … the Parliamentary Question and the longer FCO note … </p>
<p>I should stress that by that stage, as I saw it, we were in the advocacy mode as </p>

<p>“I think the understanding of everybody sitting round the table on 16 March was </p>

<p>was not that the Attorney General had gone to Parliament and said ‘This is lawful </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>806. </b> The text of Lord Goldsmith’s response is set out in the Box below.</p>
<p><b>Text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer of 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p>“Authority to use force against Iraq exists from the combined effect of resolutions 678, </p>
<p>687 and 1441. All of these resolutions were adopted under Chapter VII of the UN Charter </p>
<p>which allows the use of force for the express purpose of restoring international peace </p>
<p>and security:</p>
<p>1. </p>
<p>In resolution 678 the Security Council authorised force against Iraq, to eject it [Iraq] </p>
<p>from Kuwait and to restore peace and security in the area.</p>
<p>2. </p>
<p>In resolution 687, which set out the cease-fire conditions … the Security Council </p>
<p>imposed continuing obligations on Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction </p>
<p>in order to restore international peace and security in the area. Resolution 687 </p>
<p>suspended but did not terminate the authority to use force under resolution 678.</p>
<p>3. </p>
<p>A material breach of resolution 687 revives the authority to use force under resolution </p>
<p>678.</p>
<p>4. </p>
<p>In resolution 1441 the Security Council determined that Iraq has been and remains in </p>
<p>material breach of resolution 687, because it has not fully complied with its obligations </p>
<p>to disarm under that resolution.</p>
<p>5. </p>
<p>The Security Council in resolution 1441 gave Iraq ‘a final opportunity to comply with its </p>
<p>disarmament obligations’ and warned Iraq of the ‘serious consequences’ if it did not.</p>
<p>6. </p>
<p>The Security Council also decided in resolution 1441 that, if Iraq failed at any time to </p>
<p>comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441, that would </p>
<p>constitute a further material breach.</p>
<p>7. </p>
<p>It is plain that Iraq has failed so to comply and therefore Iraq was at the time of </p>
<p>resolution 1441 and continues to be in material breach.</p>
<p>8. </p>
<p>Thus the authority to use force under resolution 678 has revived and so continues </p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>Resolution 1441 would in terms have provided that a further decision of the Security </p>
<p>Council to sanction force was required if that had been intended. Thus, all that </p>
<p>resolution 1441 requires is reporting to and discussion by the Security Council of Iraq’s </p>
<p>failures, but not an express further decision to use force.”</p>

<p><b>808. </b> Mr Blair had replied on 14 March:</p>
<p>“There is a longstanding convention, followed by successive Governments and </p>
<p>reflected in the Ministerial Code, that legal advice to the Government remains </p>
<p>confidential. This enables the Government to obtain frank and full legal advice </p>
<p>in confidence, as everyone else can.</p>
<p>“We always act in accordance with international law. At the appropriate time the </p>

<p><b>809. </b> Mr Straw sent a copy of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to Mr Anderson, the </p>

<p>an FCO paper giving “the legal background in more detail”.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>810. </b> The Inquiry asked Ms Adams whether she agreed that the Attorney General was </p>
<p>not giving a Law Officer’s advice on 17 March. Ms Adams replied:</p>
<p>“He was essentially asserting the Government’s view of the legal position, which was </p>
<p>based on his advice … I think that [using the Attorney General to make the public </p>
<p>statement on the legal position] may have been a mistake.”</p>
<p>349</p>
<p><b>811. </b> Mr Macleod had expressed a similar view: </p>
<p>“There is a question whether it was right to place on the Attorney General the onus </p>
<p>of explaining the legal position publicly, so that he became perceived as the arbiter </p>
<p>of whether the war should take place or not. The general practice on other legal </p>
<p>issues is that the Attorney does not present the Government’s legal position:  </p>
<p>that is left to the Minister with policy responsibility for the issue under discussion. </p>
<p>That is what was done in relation to Kosovo or Iraq in 1998.”</p>

<p><b>812. </b> Sir Michael Wood explicitly endorsed Mr Macleod’s view.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p><b>813. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… there was a huge interest in what my view was in relation to the legality of war, </p>
<p>and I had had, for example, almost weekly calls from the Shadow Attorney General </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>“Normally, a Law Officer’s opinion is not disclosed. It was in fact, impossible in these </p>
<p>circumstances not to disclose what my conclusion was, because the clamour to </p>
<p>know … would have been frankly impossible to avoid. So I knew that I would have to </p>
<p>make some sort of statement as to what my position was. So that is the point about </p>
<p>the Parliamentary answer.”</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>814. </b> Parliamentary Questions and Parliamentary Committees after 2003 sought to </p>
<p>probe whether Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to Baroness Ramsey on 17 March </p>
<p>constituted the Attorney General’s advice, and by implication, whether the Government </p>
<p>had waived, in the case of the legal advice on the basis of military action in Iraq, the </p>
<p>convention that neither the fact that the Attorney General had advised nor the content </p>
<p>of that advice were disclosed.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>815. </b> In his responses, Lord Goldsmith was always very careful to point out that </p>
<p>Baroness Ramsey had asked for, and he had provided, his view of the legal basis for </p>
<p>the use of force, not his advice.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p><b>816. </b> The FCO paper, ‘Iraq: Legal Basis for the Use of Force’, stated that the legal basis </p>
<p>for the use of force in Iraq was the revival of the authorisation in resolution 678.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p><b>817. </b> Specifically, the paper stated that in resolution 1441:</p>
<p>“… the Security Council has determined – </p>
<p>(1)  that Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) constitutes </p>
<p>a threat to international peace and security;</p>
<p>(2)  that Iraq has failed – in clear violation of its legal obligations – to disarm; and</p>
<p>(3)  that, in consequence, Iraq is in material breach of the conditions for the </p>
<p>ceasefire laid down by the Council in SCR 687 at the end of hostilities in 1991, </p>
<p>thus reviving the authorisation in SCR 678.” </p>
<p><b>818. </b> Referring to the Security Council’s power under Chapter VII of the Charter to </p>
<p>authorise States to take military action, the paper set out the occasions during the 1990s </p>
<p>when action had been taken on the basis that Iraq’s non-compliance had broken the </p>
<p>conditions of the cease-fire in resolution 687 and the authority to use force in resolution </p>
<p>678 had been “revived”, as the “legal background” to resolution 1441. </p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>147</p>
<p><b>819. </b> The FCO paper stated that the preambular paragraphs of resolution 1441:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>confirmed “once more” by the reference to resolution 678 “that that resolution </p>
<p>was still in force”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“recognised the threat which Iraq’s non-compliance … posed to international </p>
<p>peace and security”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“recalled” that resolution 687 “imposed obligations on Iraq as a necessary </p>
<p>step for the achievement of its objective of restoring international peace and </p>
<p>security”.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>820. </b> The paper stated that operative paragraph one (OP1) of resolution 1441 decided </p>
<p>that “Iraq ‘has been and remains in material breach’ of its obligations” and, paraphrasing </p>
<p>the resolution, added:</p>
<p>“The use of the term ‘material breach’ is of the utmost importance because the </p>
<p>practice of the Security Council during the 1990s shows that it was just such a </p>
<p>finding of material breach by Iraq which served to revive the authorisation of force …</p>
<p>“On this occasion, however, the Council decided (paragraph two) to offer Iraq a </p>
<p>‘final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations’. Iraq was required to </p>
<p>produce an accurate, full and complete declaration of all aspects of its prohibited </p>
<p>programmes (paragraph three), and to provide immediate and unrestricted </p>
<p>access to UNMOVIC and IAEA (paragraph five). Failure by Iraq to comply with </p>
<p>the requirements of SCR 1441 was declared to be a further material breach of </p>
<p>Iraq’s obligations (paragraph four), in addition to the continuing breach identified in </p>
<p>paragraph one. In the event of a further breach (paragraph four), or interference by </p>
<p>Iraq with the inspectors or failure to comply with any of the disarmament obligations </p>
<p>under any of the relevant resolutions (paragraph 11), the matter was to be reported </p>
<p>to the Security Council. The Council was then to convene ‘to consider the situation </p>
<p>and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order </p>
<p>to secure international peace and security’ (paragraph 12). The Council warned Iraq </p>
<p>(paragraph 13) that ‘it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued </p>
<p>violations of its obligations’.” </p>
<p><b>821. </b> The paper stressed that the authority to use force did not revive immediately </p>
<p>and there had been “no ‘automaticity’”. The provision “for any failure by Iraq to be </p>
<p>‘considered’ by the Security Council” did not:</p>
<p>“… mean that no further action can be taken without a new resolution. Had that been </p>
<p>the intention, it would have provided that the Council would decide what needed to </p>
<p>be done … not that it would consider the matter. The choice of words was deliberate; </p>
<p>a proposal that there should be a requirement for a decision by the Council … was </p>
<p>356 </p>
<p>Paper FCO, 17 March 2003, ‘Iraq: Legal Basis for the Use of Force’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>not adopted. Instead the members of the Council opted for the formula that the </p>
<p>Council must consider the matter before action is taken.</p>
<p>“That consideration has taken place regularly since the adoption of resolution </p>
<p>1441. It is plain, including from UNMOVIC’s statement to the Security Council, its </p>
<p>Twelfth Quarterly Report and the so-called ‘Clusters Document’, that Iraq has not </p>
<p>complied as required … Whatever other differences there may have been in the </p>
<p>Security Council, no member of the Council questioned this conclusion. It therefore </p>
<p>follows that Iraq has not taken the final opportunity offered to it and remains </p>
<p>in material breach of the disarmament obligations which, for twelve years, the </p>
<p>Council has insisted are essential for the restoration of peace and security. In these </p>
<p>circumstances, the authorisation to use force contained in resolution 678 revives.”</p>
<p><b>822. </b> On 17 March, Mr Straw wrote to all Parliamentary colleagues with a copy of </p>
<p>the FCO paper on Iraq’s non-compliance, a copy of his letter to the Chairman of the </p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Committee, and copies of the statements made at the Azores Summit </p>
<p>the previous day.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>823. </b> Mr Straw wrote that the FCO paper on non-compliance stated that Iraq had </p>
<p>“failed to comply fully with 14 previous UN resolutions related to WMD” and assessed </p>
<p>Iraq’s “progress in complying with relevant provisions of UNSCR 1441 with illustrative </p>
<p>examples”. </p>
<p><b>824. </b> To supplement the Command Paper of UN documents published in February </p>
<p>(CM 5769) Mr Straw also published a further Command Paper (CM 5785) with UN </p>
<p>documents from early March.</p>

<p><b>Cabinet, 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>825.  A specially convened Cabinet at 1600 on 17 March 2003 endorsed the </b></p>

<p><b>House of Commons to endorse the use of military action against Iraq to enforce </b></p>
<p><b>compliance, if necessary.</b></p>
<p><b>826. </b> Mr Blair told his colleagues that he had called a meeting of Cabinet because </p>
<p>“an impasse” had been reached at the United Nations.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>827. </b> The Government had tried its “utmost”, and had “tabled a draft … resolution, </p>
<p>amended it, and then been prepared to apply tests against which Iraq’s co-operation </p>
<p>… could be judged”. Although the UK had been “gathering increasing support from </p>

<p>France, with Russia in support, “were not prepared to accept” that if Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>“did not comply with the United Nations obligations, military action should follow”. </p>
<p>The UK was in a situation it had “striven to avoid”: “There would be no second </p>
<p>resolution and military action was likely to be necessary … to enforce compliance </p>
<p>by Saddam Hussein with Iraq’s obligations.”</p>
<p><b>828. </b> Mr Blair stated that the US “had now undertaken to produce a ‘Road Map’ for the </p>
<p>Middle East Peace Process, once the new Palestinian Prime Minister’s appointment </p>
<p>had been confirmed”. That would “open the way to a full and final settlement within </p>
<p>three  years”. The US “had also confirmed” that it “would seek a UN mandate for the </p>
<p>post-conflict reconstruction of Iraq”, and that: “Oil revenues would be administered under </p>
<p>the UN’s authority.” </p>
<p><b>829. </b> Mr Blair stated: </p>
<p>“A lot of work was needed to repair the strains which had arisen internationally over </p>
<p>the past few weeks. He regretted that the international community had sent mixed </p>
<p>messages to Saddam Hussein, whose regime could have been disarmed peacefully </p>
<p>if confronted by international solidarity. The blockage we had encountered in the </p>
<p>United Nations impeded any progress.”</p>
<p><b>830. </b> Mr Straw said that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… had persuaded President Bush … to go down the United Nations route in order </p>
<p>to achieve the maximum authority for the disarmament of Iraq, but the diplomatic </p>
<p>process was now at an end.”</p>
<p><b>831. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“Progress had been made towards forging a consensus before the French and </p>
<p>Russians had indicated their intention to veto any Security Council resolution </p>
<p>proposed which indicated that military action would follow Saddam Hussein’s failure </p>
<p>to comply. His assessment was that President Chirac of France had decided to open </p>
<p>up a strategic divide between France and the United Kingdom; the row in Brussels </p>
<p>in late 2002 had been manufactured. Effectively, one member of the Security </p>
<p>Council had torpedoed the whole process.”</p>
<p><b>832. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“… the one chance now remaining to Saddam Hussein was to seek exile. If that </p>
<p>course failed, the Government would seek the support of the House of Commons </p>
<p>for military action against Iraq. There would be a substantive motion in a debate now </p>
<p>scheduled for Tuesday [18 March].”</p>
<p><b>833. </b> Lord Goldsmith told Cabinet that he had answered a Parliamentary Question in </p>
<p>the House of Lords that day “on the authority for the use of force against Iraq”; and </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>that Mr Straw had also sent a document “on the legal basis” to the Foreign Affairs </p>
<p>Committee. </p>
<p><b>834. </b> The minutes record that Lord Goldsmith informed Cabinet that:</p>
<p>“Authority existed from the combined effect of United Nations Security Council </p>
<p>resolutions 678, 687 and 1441, all of which were adopted under Chapter VII of the </p>
<p>United Nations Charter. The latter allowed the use of force for the express purpose </p>
<p>of restoring international peace and security … resolution 1441 determined that </p>
<p>Iraq had been and remained in material breach of … resolution 687 and gave Iraq </p>
<p>a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations, warning of serious </p>
<p>consequences if it did not do so. It was plain that Iraq had failed so to comply and </p>
<p>therefore continued to be in material breach. The authority to use force under </p>
<p>… resolution 678 was revived as a result … [R]esolution 1441 did not contain </p>
<p>a requirement for a further … resolution to authorise the use of force.” </p>
<p><b>835. </b> The points made during discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The attitude of France “had undermined the mechanism of the United Nations </p>
<p>to enforce the will of the international community”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Government’s supporters “needed a comprehensive statement to explain </p>
<p>the position”: a second resolution “had been politically desirable but not legally </p>
<p>essential”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“It was important to focus on Saddam’s failure to comply, and to avoid the </p>
<p>impression that the failure to gain a further … resolution was the issue”.</p>
<p><b>836. </b> Mr Prescott stated that Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“… had played a major role in upholding the credibility of the United Nations. French </p>
<p>intransigence had thwarted success in taking the United Nations process to its </p>
<p>logical conclusion. Nevertheless, the use of force against Iraq was authorised  </p>
<p>by existing … resolutions.”</p>
<p><b>837. </b> Mr Blair concluded:</p>
<p>“… the diplomatic process was now at an end. Saddam Hussein would be given an </p>
<p>ultimatum to leave Iraq; and the House of Commons would be asked to endorse the </p>
<p>use of military action against Iraq to enforce compliance, if necessary.”</p>
<p><b>838. </b> Cabinet “Took note.”</p>
<p><b>839. </b> Mr Cook’s decision to resign from the Government was announced during Cabinet, </p>
<p>which he did not attend.</p>

<p><b>840. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that he had attended Cabinet:</p>
<p>“… ready to answer any questions which were put to me and to explain my advice. </p>
<p>Certainly the view I took was that producing my answer to Parliament would be a </p>
<p>good framework for explaining to them what the legal advice was, and I would have </p>
<p>been happy to answer the questions which were put to me. I was ready, fully briefed, </p>
<p>ready to debate all these issues.</p>
<p>“What actually happened was that I started to go through the PQ [Parliamentary </p>
<p>Question], which had been handed out as this framework. Somebody, I can’t </p>
<p>remember who it was, said ‘You don’t need to do that. We can read it.’ I was actually </p>
<p>trying to use it as a sort of framework for explaining the position, and there was a </p>
<p>question that was then put. I do recall telling Cabinet, ‘Well there is another point of </p>
<p>view, but this is the conclusion that I have reached’, and then the discussion on the </p>
<p>legality simply stopped, and Cabinet then went on to discuss all the other issues, </p>
<p>the effect on international relations, domestic policy, and all the rest of it.</p>
<p>“So the way it took place was that I was ready to answer questions and to deal with </p>
<p>them and in the event that debate did not take place.”</p>
<p>361</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>841. </b> Lord Turnbull told the Inquiry that there was:</p>
<p>“… a kind of tradition which says you rely on the Attorney General to produce </p>
<p>definitive advice. Once he has done it, you don’t say, ‘I don’t think much of that’. </p>
<p>His job is to produce the version we can all work on.”</p>
<p>362</p>
<p><b>842. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The whole purpose of having the Attorney there … was so that he could answer </p>
<p>anybody’s questions …”</p>
<p>363</p>
<p><b>843. </b> Ms Short told the Inquiry that she thought that Lord Goldsmith had:</p>
<p>“… misled the Cabinet. He certainly misled me, but people let it through … I think </p>
<p>now we know everything we know about his doubts and his changes of opinion and </p>
<p>what the Foreign Office Legal Advisers were saying and that he had got this private </p>
<p>side deal that Tony Blair said there was a material breach when Blix was saying </p>
<p>he needed more time. I think for the Attorney General to come and say there is </p>
<p>an unequivocal legal authority to go to war was misleading.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>844. </b> Addressing the evidence given to the Inquiry by Lord Goldsmith and Mr Blair, </p>
<p>Ms Short stated: </p>
<p>“I see that both Tony Blair and he [Lord Goldsmith] said the Cabinet were given the </p>
<p>chance to ask questions. That is untrue.”</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>845. </b> Asked what she was trying to discuss and why she was not able to do so, Ms Short </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that she had asked for a meeting with Lord Goldsmith but:</p>
<p>“There was a piece of paper round the table. We normally didn’t have any papers, </p>
<p>apart from the agenda. It was the PQ answer, which we didn’t know was a PQ </p>
<p>answer then, and he started reading it out, so everyone said ‘We can read’ … and </p>
<p>then … everyone said, ‘That’s it’. I said, ‘That’s extraordinary. Why is it so late? </p>
<p>Did you change your mind?’ And they all said ‘Clare!’ </p>
<p>“Everything was very fraught by then and they didn’t want me arguing, and I was </p>
<p>kind of jeered at to be quiet. That’s what happened.”</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>846. </b> Asked if she then went quiet, Ms Short replied:</p>
<p>“If he won’t answer and the Prime Minister is saying, that’s it, no discussion, there </p>
<p>is only so much you can do … the Attorney, to be fair to him, says he was ready </p>
<p>to answer questions, but none was allowed.”</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>847. </b> Ms Short added that she had later asked Lord Goldsmith, “How come it was so </p>
<p>late?”, and that he had replied, “Oh, it takes me a long time to make my mind up.”</p>
<p>368</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>848. </b> Mr Campbell wrote that Ms Short had asked Lord Goldsmith “if he had any doubts”. </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith had replied that “lawyers all over the world have doubts but he was </p>
<p>confident in the position”.</p>
<p>369</p>
<p><b>849. </b> Dr Reid told the Inquiry: “everyone was allowed to speak at these [Cabinet] </p>

<p><b>850. </b> Addressing Ms Short’s evidence that she had been “kind of jeered at”, Mr Straw </p>
<p>told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… that’s not my recollection. Obviously if that’s what she felt … but this was a very </p>
<p>serious Cabinet meeting. People weren’t, as I recall … going off with that kind of </p>
<p>behaviour. We all understood the gravity of the situation.”</p>
<p>371</p>
<p><b>851. </b> Asked if he recognised Ms Short’s description of events, Lord Boateng, who was </p>
<p>Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 2002 to 2005, told the Inquiry that he did not.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>852. </b> Ms Short sent a letter to colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party the following </p>
<p>morning, explaining her reasons for deciding to support the Government.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> She wrote </p>
<p>that there had been “a number of important developments over the last week”, including: </p>
<p>“Firstly, the Attorney General has made clear that military action would be legal </p>
<p>under international law. Other lawyers have expressed contrary opinions. But for </p>
<p>the UK Government, the Civil Service and the military, it is the view of the Attorney </p>
<p>General that matters and this is unequivocal.”</p>
<p><b>853. </b> Asked at what point he had initiated the process of working out what he was going </p>
<p>to tell the Cabinet, and how much, Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“So far as Cabinet is concerned, I can’t remember at what stage I was told the </p>
<p>Cabinet was going to meet and I was going to be asked to come to Cabinet on that </p>
<p>occasion. I think it would have been the second occasion ever that I had attended </p>
<p>Cabinet.”</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>854. </b> Asked how it was decided that he would present the advice to Cabinet in the way </p>
<p>he did, and whether that decision was taken in discussion with Mr Blair or with Mr Straw, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry that it was his decision: </p>
<p>“… the point for me was to determine how to express my view to Parliament, and the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith stated that a number of the Cabinet Ministers present had seen his </p>
<p>7 March advice, although things had moved on since then. </p>
<p><b>857. </b> Lord Goldsmith added that the issues were well known in Parliament, but Cabinet </p>
<p>did not want to debate them:</p>
<p>“… thinking about it afterwards, I could sort of understand that … for this reason: that </p>
<p>actually debating the legal question with the Attorney General was a slightly sterile </p>
<p>exercise … because they could have put to me, ‘What about this and what about </p>
<p>that?’ and I would have answered them, but what mattered, I thought, was that they </p>
<p>needed to know whether or not this had the certificate, if you like, of the Attorney </p>
<p>General. Was it lawful? That was a necessary condition. Then they would need to </p>
<p>consider whether it was the right thing to do … So they were looking at the much </p>
<p>bigger question of ‘Is it right?’ not just ‘Is it lawful?’.”</p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>858. </b> Asked for his view on the proposition that there was never a full discussion </p>
<p>in Cabinet about his opinion which was “caveated and was finely balanced”, </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith replied that his advice was:</p>
<p>“… caveated in one respect … It takes the central issue of the interpretation of 1441 </p>
<p>and identifies that there are two points of view, and then I have come down in favour </p>
<p>of one of them. </p>
<p>“The Cabinet, I’m sure knew that there were two points of view because that had </p>
<p>been well-travelled in the press. The caveat was you need to be satisfied that there </p>
<p>really has been a failure to take the final opportunity. That, of course, was something </p>
<p>which was right in the forefront of Cabinet’s mind, I have no doubt, and I’m sure was </p>
<p>mentioned by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary and others in the course </p>
<p>of the debate. I would expect so.”</p>
<p>378</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>859. </b> Asked whether Cabinet should have had a discussion of Lord Goldsmith’s fuller </p>
<p>opinion before they came to a decision Lord Turnbull stated: “I think what they needed </p>
<p>was “yes” or “no”, and that’s what they got.”</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>860. </b> Asked if he thought that his Cabinet colleagues would have wished to have </p>
<p>a discussion of the considerations in Lord Goldsmith’s full advice, Mr Hoon replied:</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that it would be appropriate for Cabinet to have that kind of discussion, </p>
<p>because, in the end, what you would be inviting people to do was to speculate on </p>
<p>the legal judgment that the Attorney General had reached, and it is not the same as </p>
<p>having a political discussion about options or policies. </p>

<p>“This is someone whose decision is that this was lawful, and I can’t see how Cabinet </p>
<p>could look behind that and have the kind of discussion that you are suggesting. </p>
<p>This was not policy advice. This was not, ‘On the one hand … and on the other </p>
<p>hand, we might take this course of action’. What he was saying is that this was </p>
<p>lawful in his judgment, and I can’t see how we could have had a sensible discussion </p>
<p>going beyond that.”</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>861. </b> Mrs Beckett told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“Peter Goldsmith came to Cabinet. He made it clear what was his view. It was open </p>
<p>to people to ask questions … I was never the slightest bit surprised to learn that in </p>
<p>earlier iterations he had drawn attention to, ‘On the one hand … on the other hand’ </p>
<p>… that’s what lawyers do.”</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>862. </b> Mr Straw was asked whether it would have been better if Cabinet had had Lord </p>
<p>Goldsmith’s full opinion, whether he had persuaded Lord Goldsmith to present only the </p>
<p>(PQ) answer, whether it was incumbent on Cabinet to satisfy itself that it was be aware of </p>
<p>the arguments, and why Lord Goldsmith had reached his conclusion. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I did that, partly for the reasons I have explained … but also, because we were </p>
<p>concerned about leaks, and … what the military wanted to know wasn’t the process </p>
<p>by which a decision had been arrived at.”</p>
<p>382</p>
<p><b>863. </b> Asked whether he had been given the opportunity to look at the full legal opinion </p>
<p>of 7 March, Dr Reid told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I was given the opportunity, but I didn’t particularly want to look at some long </p>
<p>‘balancing’ legal opinion, I wanted to know ‘is what we are about to do lawful, or is it </p>
<p>illegal?’ … [A]s far as I was aware, the constitutional convention and legality in Great </p>
<p>Britain for the Cabinet is dependent on the judgment of the Attorney General.”</p>
<p>383</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>864. </b> In a statement he sent the Inquiry before his second hearing on 8 February 2010, </p>
<p>Mr Straw wrote that, in the absence of the ability to secure an authoritative determination </p>
<p>of the law from the courts, “a great weight of responsibility” rested on the shoulders of </p>
<p>the Attorney General, and that his role was to determine whether the UK Government </p>
<p>could consider the merits of taking military action.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>Memorandum’ for the Inquiry, without being fully alive to the fact that the legal issues </p>
<p>were finely balanced. Mr Straw replied:</p>
<p>“The Cabinet were fully aware that the arguments were finely balanced. It was </p>
<p>impossible to open a newspaper without being fully aware of the arguments.”</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>866. </b> In response to the point that newspaper articles were not legal advice, Mr Straw </p>
<p>added:</p>
<p>“With great respect, we had lawyers from both sides arguing the case in the public </p>
<p>print. So it was very clear … that there were two arguments going on. One was </p>
<p>about the … moral and political justification, and that, in many ways, in the public </p>
<p>print, elided with arguments about whether it was lawful … no one in the Cabinet </p>
<p>was unaware of the fact that there had been and was a continuing and intense legal </p>
<p>debate about the interpretation of 1441 … But the issue for the Cabinet was: was </p>
<p>it lawful or otherwise?</p>
<p>“… [W]hat was required … at that stage was essentially a yes/no decision from the </p>
<p>Attorney General, yes/no for the Cabinet, yes/no for the military forces. It was open </p>
<p>to members of the Cabinet to question the Attorney General … it wasn’t necessary </p>
<p>to go into the process by which Peter Goldsmith had come to his view. What they </p>
<p>wanted to know was what the answer was.”</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>867. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… any member of the Cabinet could easily have asked about the finely balanced </p>
<p>nature [of the legal arguments] … [T]he finely balanced arguments are part of the </p>
<p>process by which he came to that decision.</p>
<p>“… He was going through all the arguments …</p>
<p>“But there is nothing unusual about legal decisions being finely balanced … [W]hat </p>
<p>Cabinet wanted … and needed to know … was what was the decision.</p>
<p>“Nobody was preventing anybody from asking the Attorney … what the position was. </p>
<p>In the event they chose not to. A number of lawyers were around the table. The legal </p>
<p>issues had been extremely well aired in public, the press, and people were briefed </p>
<p>anyway.”</p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>868. </b> Asked for an assurance that Cabinet was sufficiently informed, separately and </p>
<p>collectively, to share responsibility for the risks a decision to invade Iraq entailed, </p>
<p>“including risks, individual and collective, to Crown Servants, and … themselves”, </p>
<p>Mr Straw replied: “yes”.</p>

<p>157</p>
<p><b>869. </b> Mr Straw added:</p>
<p>“… we were being publicly bombarded with the arguments, and arguments about the </p>
<p>consequences. We received detailed legal advice, for example, from CND saying </p>
<p>why it was unlawful and what the personal consequences would be.</p>
<p>“So everybody understood what the issues were and the level of responsibility, </p>
<p>personal and individual …”</p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>870. </b> Mr Straw also stated that Cabinet “was more involved in this decision” because </p>
<p>members of Cabinet had to “explain themselves in the House of Commons as well as </p>
<p>publicly and to their constituency parties”. </p>
<p><b>871. </b> Asked if he was fully satisfied with the advice that was given to Cabinet about the </p>
<p>legality of the conflict, Mr Brown told the Inquiry that Lord Goldsmith’s role was to give </p>
<p>Cabinet advice, and that “he was certain about the advice he gave” but it was Cabinet’s </p>
<p>job to “make our decisions on the basis, not simply of the legal advice, but the moral, </p>
<p>political and other case for taking action”.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>872. </b> Asked if he had been aware that Lord Goldsmith had earlier taken a different </p>
<p>view, Mr Brown replied that he was not aware of the details and that he had not been </p>
<p>involved in previous discussions with Lord Goldsmith. Mr Brown added: </p>
<p>“We had this straightforward issue. We were sitting down as a Cabinet, to discuss </p>
<p>the merits of taking action once the diplomatic avenues had been exhausted, </p>
<p>unfortunately, and we had to have straightforward advice from the Attorney General: </p>
<p>was it lawful or was it not? His advice in the Cabinet meeting was unequivocal.”</p>
<p>391</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>873. </b> Asked if he had seen Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March, Mr Brown replied:</p>
<p>“As I understand it, the constitutional position is very clear, that before a decision </p>
<p>of such magnitude is made, the Attorney General has to say whether he thinks it is </p>
<p>lawful or not. That was the straightforward question that we had to answer. If he had </p>
<p>answered equivocally … then of course there would have been questions, but he </p>
<p>was very straightforward in his recommendation. </p>
<p>“To me, that was a necessary part of the discussion about the decision of war, but it </p>
<p>wasn’t sufficient, because we had to look at the political and other case that had to </p>
<p>be examined in the light of the period of diplomacy at the United Nations.”</p>

<p>158</p>
<p><b>874. </b> After further questioning, Mr Brown told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think in retrospect, people, as historians … will look at it very carefully … and </p>
<p>what was said between different people at different times and what were the first </p>
<p>… second … and the third drafts. But the issue for us was very clear … Did the </p>
<p>Attorney General, who is our legal officer who is responsible for giving us legal </p>
<p>advice … have a position … that was unequivocal? And his position on this was </p>
<p>unequivocal.</p>
<p>“… [I]t laid the basis on which we could take a decision, but it wasn’t the reason that </p>
<p>we made the decisions. He gave us the necessary means … but it wasn’t sufficient </p>
<p>in itself.”</p>
<p>393</p>
<p><b>875. </b> Asked if his view would have changed if he had known that 10 days before the </p>
<p>Cabinet discussion Lord Goldsmith’s position had been equivocal, Mr Brown stated:</p>
<p>“I don’t think it would have changed my view, because unless he was prepared </p>
<p>to say that his unequivocal advice was that this was not lawful, then the other </p>
<p>arguments that I thought were important … the obligations to the international </p>
<p>community, the failure to honour them, the failure to disclose, the failure to discharge </p>
<p>the spirit and letter of the resolutions, particularly 1441 … But it seemed to me the </p>
<p>Attorney General’s advice was quite unequivocal.”</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>876. </b> Asked whether Cabinet was able to take a genuinely collective decision or if it was </p>
<p>being asked to endorse an approach at a time when the die had effectively been cast, </p>
<p>Mr Brown replied:</p>
<p>“I have got to be very clear. I believed we were making the right decisions for the </p>
<p>right cause. I believed I had sufficient information before me to make a judgement </p>
<p>… I wasn’t trying to do the job of the Foreign Secretary or trying to second guess </p>
<p>something that had happened at other meetings. I was looking at the issue on its </p>
<p>merits and … I was convinced of the merits of our case.”</p>
<p>395</p>
<p><b>877. </b> Asked if he thought he should have seen the full legal advice, Lord Boateng said: </p>
<p>“On reflection, I think it would have been helpful if we had seen it. I think we would </p>
<p>have had a fuller debate and discussion and I think that we ought to have been </p>
<p>trusted with it, frankly. But be that as it may, we weren’t, and we therefore acted </p>
<p>upon the best legal advice we had. I don’t think, if we had seen the full opinion, </p>
<p>we would necessarily have come to a different conclusion. I think it would have been </p>
<p>helpful if we had seen it. We didn’t.”</p>

<p><b>878. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that, in respect of Lord Goldsmith’s legal opinion:</p>
<p>“… the key thing really was … Cabinet weren’t interested in becoming part of the </p>
<p>legal debate, they just wanted to know, ‘Is the Attorney General saying it is lawful </p>
<p>or not?’”</p>
<p>397</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>879. </b> Mr Blair stated that the legal issues were “one aspect” of the Cabinet discussion, </p>
<p>but Cabinet was “really focused on the politics”.</p>
<p>398</p>
<p><b>880. </b> Asked whether Cabinet should have weighed up the legal risk, Mr Blair replied:</p>
<p>“I think they were weighing the risks up for the country, but … in respect of the law </p>
<p>… I don’t think members of the Cabinet wanted to have a debate … Peter was there </p>
<p>and could have answered any questions they had, but their basic question to him </p>
<p>was: is there a proper legal basis for this or not and his answer was, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>“… the reason why we had Peter there … he was the lawyer there to talk about it.”</p>
<p>399</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>881. </b> In a letter written to Lord Goldsmith in March 2005, Ms Short stated that the way </p>
<p>the legal advice had been presented to Cabinet was a breach of the Ministerial Code.</p>
<p>400</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>882. </b> In 2003, the relevant provision of the Ministerial Code stated: </p>
<p>“When advice from the Law Officers is included in correspondence between </p>
<p>Ministers, or in papers for the Cabinet or Ministerial Committees, the conclusions </p>
<p>may if necessary be summarised but, if this is done, the complete text of the advice </p>
<p>should be attached.”</p>
<p>401</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>883. </b> Lord Goldsmith told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… the Ministerial Code, which talks about providing the full text of the Attorney </p>
<p>General’s opinion, is actually dealing with a quite different circumstance. That’s </p>
<p>dealing with the circumstance where a Minister comes to Cabinet and says ‘I have </p>
<p>got clearance from the Attorney General. He says this is all right, or she says this </p>
<p>is all right’. In those circumstances, the Ministerial Code requires that the full text </p>
<p>should be there rather than just the summary. You can summarise it but you need </p>
<p>to produce the full text as well. </p>

<p><b>891. </b> Referring to the statement issued at the Azores Summit calling on all members </p>
<p>of the Security Council to adopt a resolution challenging Saddam Hussein to take </p>
<p>a strategic decision to disarm, Mr Straw told the House of Commons:</p>
<p>“Such a resolution has never been needed legally, but we have long had </p>
<p>a preference for it politically.”</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Mr Straw stated that there had been “intense diplomatic activity to secure that end </p>
<p>over many months, culminating in the last 24 hours”. Despite “final efforts” by Sir Jeremy </p>
<p>Greenstock the previous evening and his own conversations with his “Spanish, </p>
<p>American, Russian and Chinese counterparts that morning”, the Government had:</p>
<p>“… reluctantly concluded that a Security Council consensus on a new resolution </p>
<p>would not be possible. On my instructions, Sir Jeremy Greenstock made a public </p>
<p>announcement to that effect at the United Nations at about 3.15 pm UK time today.” </p>
<p><b>893. </b> Mr Straw continued that, since the adoption of resolution 1441 in November </p>
<p>2002, he, Mr Blair and Sir Jeremy Greenstock had “strained every nerve” in search of </p>
<p>a consensus “which could finally persuade Iraq by peaceful means, to provide the full </p>
<p>and immediate co-operation demanded by the Security Council”. </p>
<p><b>894. </b> Mr Straw stated that it was significant that “in all the discussions in the Security </p>
<p>Council and outside” no-one had claimed that Iraq was “in full compliance with the </p>
<p>obligations placed on it” and:</p>
<p>“Given that, it was my belief, up to about a week ago, that we were close to </p>
<p>achieving a consensus that we sought on the further resolution. Sadly, one country </p>
<p>then ensured that the Security Council could not act. President Chirac’s unequivocal </p>
<p>announcement last Monday that France would veto a second resolution containing </p>
<p>that or any ultimatum ‘whatever the circumstances’ inevitably created a sense of </p>
<p>paralysis in our negotiations. I deeply regret that France has thereby put a Security </p>
<p>Council consensus beyond reach.”</p>

<p><b>895. </b> Mr Straw told the House of Commons that the proposals submitted by France, </p>
<p>Germany and Russia for “more time and more inspections” sought to “rewrite” resolution </p>
<p>1441. They “would have allowed Saddam to continue stringing out inspections </p>
<p>indefinitely, and he would rightly have drawn the lesson that the Security Council was </p>
<p>simply not prepared to enforce the ultimatum … at the heart of resolution 1441”.</p>
<p><b>896. </b> Mr Straw pointed out that “in the event of non-compliance” Iraq should, as OP13 </p>
<p>spelt out, expect “serious consequences”. Mr Straw stated:</p>
<p>“As a result of Saddam Hussein’s persistent refusal to meet the UN’s demands, </p>
<p>and the inability of the Security Council to adopt a further resolution, the Cabinet </p>
<p>has decided to ask the House to support the United Kingdom’s participation in </p>

<p>military operations, should they be necessary, with the objective of ensuring the </p>
<p>disarmament of Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction, and thereby the maintenance </p>
<p>of the authority of the United Nations.”</p>
<p><b>897. </b> Mr Straw confirmed that Parliament “would have an opportunity to debate our </p>
<p>involvement in military action prior to hostilities” the following day; and that the debate </p>
<p>would be on a substantive motion “proposed by the Prime Minister and Cabinet </p>
<p>colleagues”. He also drew the attention of the House to Lord Goldsmith’s Written </p>
<p>Answer, which “set out the legal basis for the use of force against Iraq”, and the </p>
<p>documents provided earlier that day.</p>
<p><b>898. </b> Mr Straw concluded:</p>
<p>“Some say that Iraq can be disarmed without an ultimatum, without the threat or the </p>
<p>use of force, but simply by more time and more inspections. That approach is defied </p>
<p>by all our experience over 12 weary years. It cannot produce the disarmament of </p>
<p>Iraq; it cannot rid the world of the danger of the Iraq regime. It can only bring comfort </p>
<p>to tyrants and emasculate the authority of the United Nations …”</p>
<p><b>899. </b> Mr Straw’s statement was repeated in the House of Lords that day by </p>
<p>Baroness Symons during a debate on the legality of the use of armed force in Iraq </p>

<p>Saltaire, Baroness Symons stated that she believed: </p>
<p>“… the legality of the position is indeed settled. I do not think we have ever had such </p>
<p>a clear statement from the Attorney General at a juncture like this … I believe that </p>
<p>this Government have gone further than any other Government to put that advice </p>
<p>into the public arena, and the Law Officer with his principal responsibility has given </p>
<p>a clear statement of his opinion …</p>
<p>“… [W]e have already put into the public arena a full history of the United Nations </p>
<p>Security Council resolutions … That is in Command Paper 5769. We have also </p>

<p>163</p>
<p><b>901. </b> Responding to points made in the debate by Lord Goodhart and Lord Howell about </p>
<p>the absence of Lord Goldsmith, Baroness Symons stated in her speech closing the </p>
<p>debate:</p>
<p>“The Attorney General has been more open-handed than any of his predecessors </p>
<p>in publishing his advice in the way that he has. Furthermore … the Foreign </p>
<p>Secretary has also tried to help … by circulating a further paper.”</p>
<p>409</p>
<p><b>902. </b> Baroness Symons added that, “In recognition of the enormous importance of this </p>
<p>issue”, Lord Goldsmith had “decided to disclose his view of the legal basis for the use </p>
<p>of force”. That was:</p>
<p>“… almost unprecedented. The last time a Law Officer’s views were disclosed </p>
<p>concerned the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. It is right that what has happened today </p>
<p>remains the exception rather than the rule.” </p>
<p><b>Conclusions</b></p>
<p><b>The timing of Lord Goldsmith’s advice on the interpretation of </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441</b></p>
<p><b>903.  Following the adoption of resolution 1441, a decision was taken to delay </b></p>
<p><b>the receipt of formal advice from Lord Goldsmith.</b></p>
<p><b>904.  On 11 November Mr Powell told Lord Goldsmith that there should be </b></p>
<p><b>a meeting some time before Christmas to discuss the legal position. </b></p>
<p><b>905.  On 9 December, formal “instructions” to provide advice were sent to </b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith. They were sent by the FCO on behalf of the FCO and the MOD </b></p>
<p><b>as well as No.10.</b></p>
<p><b>906.  The instructions made it clear that Lord Goldsmith should not provide an </b></p>
<p><b>immediate response.</b></p>
<p><b>907.  When Lord Goldsmith met Mr Powell, Sir David Manning and Baroness </b></p>
<p><b>Morgan on 19 December, he was told that he was not, at that stage, being asked </b></p>
<p><b>for his advice; and that, when he was, it would be helpful for him to discuss a draft </b></p>
<p><b>with Mr Blair in the first instance.</b></p>
<p><b>908.  Until 7 March 2003, Mr Blair and Mr Powell asked that Lord Goldsmith’s </b></p>
<p><b>views on the legal effect of resolution 1441 should be tightly held and not shared </b></p>
<p><b>with Ministerial colleagues without No.10’s permission. </b></p>
<p><b>909.  Lord Goldsmith agreed that approach.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>164</p>
<p><b>910.  Lord Goldsmith provided draft advice to Mr Blair on 14 January 2003. </b></p>
<p><b>As instructed he did not, at that time, provide a copy of his advice to Mr Straw </b></p>
<p><b>or to Mr Hoon. </b></p>
<p><b>911.  Although Lord Goldsmith was invited to attend Cabinet on 16 January, there </b></p>
<p><b>was no discussion of Lord Goldsmith’s views.</b></p>
<p><b>912.  Mr Straw was aware, in general terms, of Lord Goldsmith’s position but he </b></p>
<p><b>was not provided with a copy of Lord Goldsmith’s draft advice before Cabinet on </b></p>
<p><b>16 January. He did not read it until at least two weeks later.</b></p>
<p><b>913.  The draft advice of 14 January should have been provided to Mr Straw, </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Hoon and the Cabinet Secretary, all of whose responsibilities were directly </b></p>
<p><b>engaged. </b></p>
<p><b>914.  Lord Goldsmith provided Mr Blair with further advice on 30 January.  </b></p>
<p><b>It was not seen by anyone outside No.10. </b></p>
<p><b>915.  Lord Goldsmith discussed the negotiating history of resolution 1441 </b></p>
<p><b>with Mr Straw, Sir Jeremy Greenstock, with White House officials and the </b></p>
<p><b>State Department’s Legal Advisers. They argued that resolution 1441 could be </b></p>
<p><b>interpreted as not requiring a second resolution. The US Government’s position </b></p>
<p><b>was that it would not have agreed to resolution 1441 had its terms required one. </b></p>
<p><b>916.  When Lord Goldsmith met No.10 officials on 27 February, he told them </b></p>
<p><b>that he had reached the view that a “reasonable case” could be made that </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441 was capable of reviving the authorisation to use force in </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 678 (1990) without a further resolution, if there were strong factual </b></p>
<p><b>grounds for concluding that Iraq had failed to take the final opportunity offered </b></p>
<p><b>by resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>917.  Until that time, No.10 could not have been sure that Lord Goldsmith would </b></p>
<p><b>advise that there was a basis on which military action against Iraq could be taken </b></p>
<p><b>in the absence of a further decision of the Security Council. </b></p>
<p><b>918.  In the absence of Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice, uncertainties about the </b></p>
<p><b>circumstances in which the UK would be able to participate in military action </b></p>
<p><b>continued, although the possibility of a second resolution remained.</b></p>
<p><b>919.  Lord Goldsmith provided formal written advice on 7 March.</b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>920.  Lord Goldsmith’s formal advice of 7 March set out alternative interpretations </b></p>
<p><b>of the legal effect of resolution 1441. He concluded that the safer route would be </b></p>
<p><b>to seek a second resolution, and he set out the ways in which, in the absence of </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution, the matter might be brought before a court. Lord Goldsmith </b></p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>165</p>
<p><b>identified a key question to be whether or not there was a need for an assessment </b></p>
<p><b>of whether Iraq’s conduct constituted a failure to take the final opportunity or a </b></p>
<p><b>failure fully to co-operate within the meaning of OP4, such that the basis of the </b></p>
<p><b>cease-fire was destroyed.</b></p>
<p><b>921.  Lord Goldsmith wrote (paragraph 26): “A narrow textual reading of the </b></p>
<p><b>resolution suggested no such assessment was needed because the Security </b></p>
<p><b>Council had pre-determined the issue. Public statements, on the other hand, say </b></p>
<p><b>otherwise.”</b></p>
<p><b>922.  While Lord Goldsmith remained “of the opinion that the safest legal course </b></p>
<p><b>would be to secure a second resolution”, he concluded (paragraph 28) that </b></p>
<p><b>“a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 was capable of reviving </b></p>
<p><b>the authorisation in resolution 678 without a further resolution”.</b></p>
<p><b>923.  Lord Goldsmith wrote that a reasonable case did not mean that if the matter </b></p>
<p><b>ever came to court, he would be confident that the court would agree with this </b></p>
<p><b>view. He judged a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 required a further </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678.</b></p>
<p><b>924.  Lord Goldsmith noted that on a number of previous occasions, including </b></p>
<p><b>in relation to Operation Desert Fox in Iraq in 1998 and Kosovo in 1999, UK forces </b></p>
<p><b>had participated in military action on the basis of advice from previous Attorneys </b></p>
<p><b>General that (paragraph 30) “the legality of the action under international law was </b></p>
<p><b>no more than reasonably arguable”.</b></p>
<p><b>925.  Lord Goldsmith warned Mr Blair (paragraph 29):</b></p>
<p><b>“… the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation </b></p>
<p><b>to use force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong </b></p>
<p><b>factual grounds for concluding that Iraq failed to take the final opportunity. </b></p>
<p><b>In other words, we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of </b></p>
<p><b>non-compliance and non-cooperation … the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA </b></p>
<p><b>will be highly significant in this respect.”</b></p>
<p><b>926.  Lord Goldsmith added:</b></p>
<p><b>“In the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC, you will need to consider </b></p>
<p><b>extremely carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-</b></p>
<p><b>compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>has failed to take its final opportunity.”</b></p>
<p><b>927.  Mr Straw, Mr Hoon, Dr Reid and the Chiefs of Staff had all seen Lord </b></p>
<p><b>Goldsmith’s advice of 7 March before the No.10 meeting on 11 March, but it is not </b></p>
<p><b>clear how and when it reached them.</b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>166</p>
<p><b>928.  Other Ministers whose responsibilities were directly engaged, including </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Brown and Ms Short, and their senior officials, did not see the advice.</b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s arrival at a “better view”</b></p>
<p><b>929.  At the meeting on 11 March, Mr Blair stated that Lord Goldsmith’s “advice </b></p>
<p><b>made it clear that a reasonable case could be made” that resolution 1441 was </b></p>
<p><b>“capable of reviving” the authorisation of resolution 678, “although of course </b></p>
<p><b>a second resolution would be preferable”. There was concern, however, that the </b></p>
<p><b>advice did not offer a clear indication that military action would be lawful. </b></p>
<p><b>930.  Lord Goldsmith was asked, after the meeting, by Adm Boyce on behalf of the </b></p>
<p><b>Armed Forces, and by the Treasury Solicitor, Ms Juliet Wheldon, in respect of the </b></p>
<p><b>Civil Service, to give a clear-cut answer on whether military action would be lawful </b></p>
<p><b>rather than unlawful.</b></p>
<p><b>931.  On 12 March, Mr Blair and Mr Straw reached the view that there was no </b></p>
<p><b>chance of securing a majority in the Security Council in support of the draft </b></p>
<p><b>resolution of 7 March and there was a risk of one or more vetoes if the resolution </b></p>
<p><b>was put to a vote. </b></p>
<p><b>932.  There is no evidence to indicate that Lord Goldsmith was informed of their </b></p>
<p><b>conclusion.</b></p>
<p><b>933.  Lord Goldsmith concluded on 13 March that, on balance, the “better view” </b></p>
<p><b>was that the conditions for the operation of the revival argument were met in this </b></p>
<p><b>case, meaning that there was a lawful basis for the use of force without a further </b></p>
<p><b>resolution beyond resolution 1441.</b></p>
<p><b>The exchange of letters on 14 and 15 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>934.  Mr Brummell wrote to Mr Rycroft on 14 March:</b></p>
<p><b>“It is an essential part of the legal basis for military action without a further </b></p>
<p><b>resolution of the Security Council that there is strong evidence that Iraq </b></p>
<p><b>has failed to comply with and co-operate fully in the implementation of </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441 and has thus failed to take the final opportunity offered by the </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council in that resolution. The Attorney General understands that </b></p>
<p><b>it is unequivocally the Prime Minister’s view that Iraq has committed further </b></p>
<p><b>material breaches as specified in [operative] paragraph 4 of resolution 1441, </b></p>
<p><b>but as this is a judgment for the Prime Minister, the Attorney would be grateful </b></p>
<p><b>for confirmation that this is the case.”</b></p>
<p><b>935.  Mr Rycroft replied to Mr Brummell on 15 March:</b></p>
<p><b>“This is to confirm that it is indeed the Prime Minister’s unequivocal view that </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations, as in OP4 of UNSCR 1441, </b></p>

<p>5  |  Advice on the legal basis for military action, November 2002 to March 2003</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>because of ‘false statements or omissions in the declarations submitted by </b></p>
<p><b>Iraq pursuant to this resolution and failure to comply with, and co-operate fully </b></p>
<p><b>in the interpretation of, this resolution’.”</b></p>
<p><b>936.  It is unclear what specific grounds Mr Blair relied upon in reaching his view. </b></p>
<p><b>937.  In his advice of 7 March, Lord Goldsmith had said that the views of UNMOVIC </b></p>
<p><b>and the IAEA would be highly significant in demonstrating hard evidence of </b></p>
<p><b>non-compliance and non-co-operation. In the exchange of letters on 14 and 15 </b></p>
<p><b>March between Mr Brummell and No.10, there is no reference to their views; the </b></p>
<p><b>only view referred to was that of Mr Blair.</b></p>
<p><b>938.  Following receipt of Mr Brummell’s letter of 14 March, Mr Blair neither </b></p>
<p><b>requested nor received considered advice addressing the evidence on which </b></p>
<p><b>he expressed his “unequivocal view” that Iraq was “in further material breach </b></p>
<p><b>of its obligations”.</b></p>
<p><b>939.  Senior Ministers should have considered the question posed in </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Brummell’s letter of 14 March, either in the Defence and Overseas Policy </b></p>
<p><b>Committee or a “War Cabinet”, on the basis of formal advice. Such a Committee </b></p>
<p><b>should then have reported its conclusions to Cabinet before its members were </b></p>
<p><b>asked to endorse the Government’s policy.</b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer of 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>940.  In Parliament during the second week of March, and in the media, there were </b></p>
<p><b>calls on the Government to make a statement about its legal position.</b></p>
<p><b>941.  When Lord Goldsmith spoke to Mr Brummell on 13 March, they agreed </b></p>
<p><b>that a statement should be prepared “setting out the Attorney’s view of the legal </b></p>
<p><b>position which could be deployed at Cabinet and in Parliament the following </b></p>
<p><b>week”. </b></p>
<p><b>942.  The message was conveyed to No.10 during the morning of 15 March that </b></p>
<p><b>Lord Goldsmith “would make clear during the course of the week that there is </b></p>
<p><b>a sound legal basis for action should that prove necessary”.</b></p>
<p><b>943.  The decision that Lord Goldsmith would take the lead in explaining the </b></p>
<p><b>Government’s legal position to Parliament, rather than the Prime Minister or </b></p>
<p><b>responsible Secretary of State providing that explanation, was unusual. </b></p>
<p><b>944.  The normal practice was, and is, that the Minister responsible for the policy, </b></p>
<p><b>in this case Mr Blair or Mr Straw, would have made such a statement. </b></p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>Cabinet, 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p><b>945.  Cabinet was provided with the text of Lord Goldsmith’s Written Answer to </b></p>
<p><b>Baroness Ramsey setting out the legal basis for military action. </b></p>
<p><b>946.  That document represented a statement of the Government’s legal position </b></p>
<p><b>– it did not explain the legal basis of the conclusion that Iraq had failed to take </b></p>
<p><b>“the final opportunity” to comply with its disarmament obligations offered by </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441. </b></p>
<p><b>947.  Lord Goldsmith told Cabinet that it was “plain” that Iraq had failed to comply </b></p>
<p><b>with its obligations and continued to be in “material breach” of the relevant </b></p>
<p><b>Security Council resolutions. The authority to use force under resolution 678 was, </b></p>
<p><b>“as a result”, revived. Lord Goldsmith said that there was no need for a further </b></p>
<p><b>resolution. </b></p>
<p><b>948.  Cabinet was not provided with written advice which set out, as the advice </b></p>
<p><b>of 7 March had done, the conflicting arguments regarding the legal effect of </b></p>
<p><b>resolution 1441 and whether, in particular, it authorised military action without </b></p>
<p><b>a further resolution of the Security Council.</b></p>
<p><b>949.  Cabinet was not provided with, or informed of, Mr Brummell’s letter to </b></p>
<p><b>Mr Rycroft of 14 March; or Mr Rycroft’s response of 15 March. Cabinet was not </b></p>
<p><b>told how Mr Blair had reached the view recorded in Mr Rycroft’s letter. </b></p>
<p><b>950.  The majority of Cabinet members who gave evidence to the Inquiry took </b></p>
<p><b>the position that the role of the Attorney General on 17 March was, simply, to tell </b></p>
<p><b>Cabinet whether or not there was a legal basis for military action. </b></p>
<p><b>951.  None of those Ministers who had read Lord Goldsmith’s 7 March advice </b></p>
<p><b>asked for an explanation as to why his legal view of resolution 1441 had changed. </b></p>
<p><b>952.  There was little appetite to question Lord Goldsmith about his advice, and </b></p>
<p><b>no substantive discussion of the legal issues was recorded. </b></p>
<p><b>953.  Cabinet was not misled on 17 March and the exchange of letters between </b></p>
<p><b>the Attorney General’s office and No.10 on 14 and 15 March did not constitute, </b></p>
<p><b>as suggested to the Inquiry by Ms Short, a “side deal”.</b></p>
<p><b>954.  Cabinet was, however, being asked to confirm the decision that the </b></p>
<p><b>diplomatic process was at an end and that the House of Commons should be </b></p>
<p><b>asked to endorse the use of military action to enforce Iraq’s compliance. Given </b></p>
<p><b>the gravity of this decision, Cabinet should have been made aware of the legal </b></p>
<p><b>uncertainties.</b></p>
<p><b>955.  Lord Goldsmith should have been asked to provide written advice which </b></p>
<p><b>fully reflected the position on 17 March, explained the legal basis on which the </b></p>
