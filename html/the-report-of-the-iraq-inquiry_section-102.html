<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>198</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Section 10 addresses the UK contribution to humanitarian assistance and </p>
<p>reconstruction in Iraq between 2003 and 2009:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 10.1 covers the period between March 2003 and the end of the </p>
<p>Occupation of Iraq in June 2004.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 10.2 continues the story from July 2004 to July 2009.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Sections 10.1 and 10.2 consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development and implementation of UK reconstruction policy, strategy </p>
<p>and plans;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with the US on reconstruction, including with the US-led </p>
<p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and the Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Authority (CPA); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with successive Iraqi governments on reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> Section 10.3 addresses five issues in more detail:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK policy on Iraq’s oil and oil revenues; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s support for UK business in securing reconstruction contracts; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>debt relief; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asylum; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reform of the Government’s approach to post-conflict reconstruction and </p>
<p>stabilisation.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Those issues are addressed separately from the main reconstruction narrative, in </p>
<p>order to provide a clearer account of the development of the UK’s engagement. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> This Section does not consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparing to provide humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, </p>
<p>which is addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the financial and human resources available for post-conflict reconstruction, </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 13 and 15 respectively; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification and Security Sector Reform (SSR), addressed in Sections 11 </p>
<p>and 12 respectively; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>wider UK policy towards Iraq in the post-conflict period, addressed in Section 9. </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>The transition from Occupation to an Iraqi Government</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> On 28 June 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) formally handed over to </p>
<p>a sovereign Iraqi Government. In the 11 months that followed, the governance of Iraq </p>
<p>was the responsibility of the Interim Iraqi Government (IIG), headed by Prime Minister </p>
<p>Ayad Allawi. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The security situation in Iraq remained difficult. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The core UK Ministerial team was unchanged: Mr Brown remained Chancellor </p>
<p>of the Exchequer, Mr Straw Foreign Secretary, Mr Hoon Defence Secretary, and </p>
<p>Mr Benn International Development Secretary. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> Mr Straw continued to chair the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation </p>
<p>(AHMGIR), which met seven times between July 2004 and February 2005, after which </p>
<p>its business was taken up by the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq (AHMGI). </p>
<p><b>10. </b> Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq, and </p>
<p>Ambassador Paul Bremer, the CPA Administrator, left Iraq shortly after the handover </p>
<p>ceremony.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> Ambassador John Negroponte, the new US Ambassador to Iraq, presented his </p>
<p>diplomatic credentials to the IIG on 29 June.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>12. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> described how, shortly after arriving in Baghdad and driven by </p>
<p>his concern about worsening security, Ambassador Negroponte put the US$18.4bn </p>
<p>Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF2) on hold and initiated a “thorough  </p>
<p>re-examination” of US priorities. </p>
<p><b>13. </b> Ambassador Negroponte concluded that implementing economic development </p>
<p>programmes would be fruitless while security remained a serious problem. Three </p>
<p>reallocations of IRRF2 funds took place in September 2004, December 2004 and </p>
<p>March 2005. Those reallocations provided additional funds for security, the political </p>
<p>process and “project sustainment” at the expense of infrastructure projects. The water </p>
<p>and sanitation sector lost nearly half its funding, and the electricity sector almost a </p>
<p>quarter of its funding.</p>
<p><b>14. </b> Mr Edward Chaplin arrived in Baghdad on 5 July to take up post as the first British </p>
<p>Ambassador to Iraq since 1990. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>200</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Ms Lindy Cameron, Deputy Head of DFID Baghdad from January to November </p>
<p>2004 (and subsequently Head of DFID Baghdad), described the transition:</p>
<p>“… it’s hard to describe how strange the CPA was. So in a sense this period in  </p>
<p>June/July 2004 when we were transitioning from the CPA to … an Iraqi Government </p>
<p>that was then sovereign, was a real transition because it is difficult to imagine how </p>
<p>strange it was to be in a building of thousands and thousands of foreign officials </p>
<p>effectively running a country, and then a very rapid transition from that to an Iraqi </p>
<p>Government which had some of the structures it needed, but then didn’t have some </p>
<p>of the others.” </p>
<p>3</p>
<p><b>Efforts to accelerate the pace of reconstruction</b></p>
<p><b>16. </b> On 1 July, at his request, the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) provided </p>
<p>General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS), with advice on </p>
<p>post-transition plans for infrastructure reconstruction.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. </b> PJHQ advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US Project and Contracting Office (PCO) would be the largest source of </p>
<p>funding for reconstruction in the short to medium term, but was still developing </p>
<p>its management structures and procedures and recruiting staff. It was likely that </p>
<p>the PCO would not be fully functioning until September. Concerns had been </p>
<p>expressed about a funding gap over the summer and the consequent potential </p>
<p>for “social unrest”. MND(SE) had explored the possibility of extending CPA </p>
<p>projects or increasing the US Commanders’ Emergency Response Programme </p>
<p>(CERPs) allocation for the South, but neither option appeared possible. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer had requested that additional UK resources should be </p>
<p>used to plug the potential gap between CPA and PCO activity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Since the emphasis in Iraq had shifted from reconstruction to development, the </p>
<p>bulk of the UK’s future contribution clearly fell “within the competence of DFID”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Essential Services Plan, which had been due to complete by 30 June </p>
<p>2004 but had now been extended to August, remained the “major vehicle for </p>
<p>infrastructure reconstruction” in MND(SE).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK military would continue to implement projects funded by the US CERPs </p>
<p>and UK allocations for Quick Impact Projects (QIPs). </p>
<p><b>18. </b> The 1 July meeting of the AHMGIR considered three papers on UK priorities for the </p>
<p>period up to the Iraqi elections (scheduled for January 2005), on the political process, </p>
<p>security, and reconstruction and development.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The MOD paper on security assessed that the security situation was unlikely </p>
<p>to improve in the immediate future.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> The key to improving the security situation was </p>
<p>achieving “buy-in” to the political process and making progress on reconstruction, at the </p>
<p>same time as developing the capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF). </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The paper highlighted the importance of job creation: </p>
<p>“A major Iraqi complaint is the failure to meet expectations on reconstruction. This </p>
<p>has the double negative effect of creating disaffection with the political process and </p>
<p>increasing the pool of unemployed … </p>
<p>“It will therefore be important that the reconstruction programme creates sufficient </p>
<p>jobs to significantly reduce the number of disaffected. In the short term, continuing </p>
<p>difficulties in the delivery of essential services could lead to serious disturbances </p>
<p>during the summer.” </p>
<p><b>21. </b> The DFID paper on reconstruction and development assessed that the next six </p>
<p>months would be critical for establishing stability.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> Better security would be “central if </p>
<p>there is to be sustained progress on reconstruction, effective engagement by the UN </p>
<p>and World Bank, and if the Iraqi economy is to take off as it should”. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Other key issues for reconstruction and development were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>minimising any potential slowdown in reconstruction and development in the </p>
<p>South over the summer, in particular as new US structures became established; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of Iraqi institutions to manage reconstruction; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>helping the IIG conclude debt relief negotiations and setting the foundations for </p>
<p>macro-economic stability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SSR and access to justice; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthening social cohesion by supporting Iraqi participation in the political </p>
<p>process, strengthening civil society’s ability to advocate for the poor, and </p>
<p>supporting the development of the Iraqi media.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> At the meeting, Mr Benn welcomed the fact that “Iraqis were clearly in charge and </p>
<p>their voices were being heard”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> The UK was moving “from a phase of doing things </p>
<p>for the Iraqis to supporting them doing it for themselves”. The UK’s focus was now on </p>
<p>engaging the UN and World Bank, plugging any funding gap over the summer, and </p>
<p>supporting Iraqi institutions to manage the reconstruction process and access funds. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>202</p>
<p><b>24. </b> The meeting endorsed the three papers, and commissioned the FCO to co-ordinate </p>
<p>an integrated UK strategy covering the period up to the Iraqi elections for discussion at </p>
<p>the meeting of the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (DOP), a sub-Committee </p>
<p>of the Cabinet, on 15 July. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> In his first report from Basra on 12 July, Mr Simon Collis, the British Consul </p>
<p>General, reported that no PCO staff had yet arrived in Basra to spend the South’s </p>
<p>US$2.3bn projected share of IRRF2.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> He continued: </p>
<p>“… no one here – including my US counterpart – knows yet how the third entirely </p>
<p>new organisation in just over a year</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> will organise itself and do business. There </p>
<p>must be a high risk that money will be spent slowly, inappropriately, and without </p>
<p>adequate consultation with ourselves or, more importantly, the Iraqis.” </p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr Collis also advised that there were still no effective mechanisms in place to </p>
<p>enable Iraqi ministries to release funds to Basra. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> The strategy paper commissioned by the AHMGIR on 1 July was circulated to </p>
<p>members of DOP on 13 July.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> The introduction to the paper said that it offered:</p>
<p>“… a strategic look at the position we want Iraq to be in at the end of January 2005; </p>
<p>risks to our strategy; and priority areas in which the UK can help ensure success.”</p>
<p><b>28. </b> The paper, which had been produced by the FCO, defined the political, security and </p>
<p>“reconstruction and economic” objectives for the period up to the Iraqi elections. The </p>
<p>three objectives for reconstruction and the economy were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a functioning Iraqi Government in Baghdad and at governorate level capable of </p>
<p>delivering basic services; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction programmes funded by the PCO, the UN and World Bank Trust </p>
<p>Funds, bilateral donors and the Iraqi Government which were delivering jobs and </p>
<p>improvements to infrastructure and services; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a reduction in subsidies and an agreed IMF programme leading to a debt </p>
<p>settlement by December.</p>
<p><b>29. </b> The paper identified security as the most significant risk to achieving those </p>
<p>objectives, in particular the risk of “a terrorist spectacular” against either the IIG </p>
<p>or the UN. Other risks included infrastructure failures over the summer leading to </p>
<p>popular discontent. </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Based on those objectives and risks, the two “reconstruction and development” </p>
<p>priorities were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To bridge funding shortfalls over the summer, when CPA and Development Fund </p>
<p>for Iraq (DFI) projects ended, by implementing DFID and MOD job creation </p>
<p>and infrastructure programmes. The UK had to maintain pressure on the US to </p>
<p>spend its money in the South, quickly. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To press the UN and the World Bank to send key staff back to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>31. </b> The paper identified monthly milestones on the political process, reconstruction, </p>
<p>and SSR tracks between July 2004 and January 2005. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> At the DOP meeting, chaired by Mr Blair, Ministers reported that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Progress was being made on reconstruction. Electricity production was at its </p>
<p>highest level so far (at 5,500 megawatts), the UK was providing expert advice </p>
<p>to the IIG, notably to Prime Minister Allawi’s office, and DFID and the MOD had </p>
<p>funds in place to mitigate a possible funding gap over the summer. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Implementation of the main infrastructure contracts was slow.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p><b>33. </b> DOP agreed the priorities set out in the paper, and commissioned DFID to </p>
<p>produce a note on infrastructure issues which Mr Blair might use in discussions with </p>
<p>President Bush. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> The FCO paper was not the integrated strategy that Ministers had requested on </p>
<p>1 July. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> The DFID note that was subsequently sent to No.10 welcomed the anticipated </p>
<p>arrival of the PCO Regional Co-ordinator in Basra, and continued: “But PCO  </p>
<p>[Co-ordinator] will need a team to support him. Little sign of Supplemental [IRRF2] </p>
<p>contractors on the ground. Needs impetus.”</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>36. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair spoke by video conference on 22 July. Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>briefing for the discussion, which had been produced by Mr Antony Phillipson, Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Private Secretary, recalled that Mr Blair had told DOP that he would speak to President </p>
<p>Bush about the pace of reconstruction spending.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> Since then, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, had discussed the issue with Dr Condoleezza Rice, </p>
<p>the US National Security Advisor. Mr Phillipson suggested that Mr Blair “might just </p>
<p>mention” UK concerns about the situation in the South.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>204</p>
<p><b>37. </b> The record of the video conference did not include any reference to reconstruction.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>38. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 22 July meeting of the AHMGIR stated that the </p>
<p>responsibility for IRRF2 had passed from the US Department of Defense (DoD) to </p>
<p>the US State Department.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> The State Department wanted to review US priorities to </p>
<p>ensure they were “developmentally sound” and to shift resources from infrastructure to </p>
<p>governance; the UK had urged quick decisions to avoid delaying disbursements. </p>
<p><b>39. </b> The Annotated Agenda advised that a PCO Regional Co-ordinator would arrive </p>
<p>in Basra at the end of July and projects would start in September. It appeared that the </p>
<p>US was giving priority to programmes “in ‘their’ areas”; there was therefore a risk of a </p>
<p>reconstruction gap in the South. The need to speed up US reconstruction in the South </p>
<p>had been raised at a recent video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The Annotated Agenda set out the action that the UK was taking, in addition </p>
<p>to lobbying the US to speed up their efforts, to address the possible short-term </p>
<p>funding gap:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD was seeking a further £10m from the Treasury for QIPs. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID was funding a five-person Project Continuity Team (PCT) based in the </p>
<p>PCO to help implement former CPA(South) projects. The PCT had already </p>
<p>deployed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID was funding a 10-person Technical Advisory Team (TAT) comprising </p>
<p>infrastructure and other specialists to help link Iraqi priorities and PCO plans. </p>
<p>The team was expected to deploy to Iraq in August.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID had developed a £16m programme to generate employment opportunities </p>
<p>and provide an emergency response facility to deal with critical failures in </p>
<p>essential services in the South over the next six months. The programme would </p>
<p>start immediately. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that the IMF was seeking early agreement on a </p>
<p>Stand-By Arrangement for Iraq (a precondition for a Paris Club deal on debt reduction). </p>
<p>DFID hoped to deploy advisers to support the Iraqi Government in its negotiations with </p>
<p>the IMF. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> A UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) secondee to the PCO told an official at the </p>
<p>British Embassy Baghdad on 7 August that he was not aware of any PCO policy to </p>
<p>withhold support from Basra in favour of US areas.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> The official described the secondee </p>
<p>as “generally very well informed on PCO policies”.</p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>43. </b> Section 9.3 describes the Sadrist uprising in Najaf in early August, and the </p>
<p>deteriorating security situation across Iraq. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Mr Blair concluded at the end of August that Prime Minister Allawi needed “help </p>
<p>now”. That help included accelerating the pace of reconstruction, so that Iraqis saw </p>
<p>improvements before the January 2005 elections. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr Phillipson wrote to the Cabinet Office on 20 August to commission a:</p>
<p>“… full picture of the situation in Iraq after the National Conference,</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> how we are </p>
<p>going to get from here to successful elections in January, and the challenges we </p>
<p>will face.” </p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Phillipson advised that the request followed a “long discussion” the previous day </p>
<p>with Mr Blair, who had observed that the security situation, the slow rate at which the ISF </p>
<p>was being trained and equipped, and “ongoing difficulties” with reconstruction posed a </p>
<p>real risk to the achievement of the UK’s objectives in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra reported by telegram on 24 August that the PCO </p>
<p>Regional Co-ordinator had now arrived.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> The Co-ordinator expected the PCO to “have </p>
<p>an impact on the ground” in the last quarter of 2004; the British Embassy Office doubted </p>
<p>that the PCO could meet that timeline. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> On 27 August, in response to Mr Phillipson’s commission, the IPU provided a paper </p>
<p>for the Cabinet Office.</p>

<p> Mr Neil Crompton, the Head of the IPU, advised Mr Straw’s </p>
<p>Private Office that the paper contained “little new in policy terms”.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> The IPU paper concluded that the strategy agreed by DOP on 15 July was the right </p>
<p>one, but would require regular fine-tuning.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> Its key judgements included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The IIG had made a good start, but needed to deliver results soon, particularly </p>
<p>on security but also on essential services.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was growing “disquiet” in the “previously benign” South, reinforced by </p>
<p>a sense that Baghdad and the US were neglecting its interests. Politically, </p>
<p>Basra and Maysan were paralysed by power struggles, hindering work on </p>
<p>reconstruction and security. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq was “awash with reconstruction funds”. The challenge was delivering </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>206</p>
<p><b>50. </b> The paper stated that President Bush was letting US officials in Baghdad “make the </p>
<p>running”, and recommended that the UK focus its effort with the President on a few key </p>
<p>areas where Washington could make a difference, including ensuring that the US did not </p>
<p>take reconstruction in the South for granted. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> The paper retained the three reconstruction objectives that DOP had agreed on </p>
<p>15 July (a functioning Iraqi Government, reconstruction programmes funded by others </p>
<p>delivering quickly and well, and a reduction in subsidies and an agreed IMF programme </p>
<p>leading to debt relief by December 2004). </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Mr Phillipson passed the IPU paper to Mr Blair, after discussing it with </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> Mr Phillipson’s covering minute stated that the IPU paper was </p>
<p>“too vague”, did not reflect the “loss of control” in Basra and elsewhere, and did not offer </p>
<p>a clear way forward. He recalled that Mr Blair had asked for the “unvarnished truth so </p>
<p>that we can engage in a frank discussion about how we can help the IIG restore control”. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> Mr Phillipson recommended that a new paper should be commissioned, broken into </p>
<p>three sections:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how to ensure that the elections took place, on time, in January 2005;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how the Sunni triangle could be brought “back under control”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how order could be restored in Basra.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Mr Phillipson continued that one aspect of the effort to bring the Sunni triangle back </p>
<p>under control should be “a short-term programme of intensive reconstruction to make a </p>
<p>visible impact to people’s lives – a Sunni outreach programme”. </p>
<p><b>55. </b> Mr Blair set out his analysis of the issues in a note to Sir Nigel Sheinwald, </p>
<p>Mr Phillipson, Mr Jonathan Powell (No.10 Chief of Staff) and a junior member of his </p>
<p>No.10 staff on 29 August.</p>
<p>24</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“Our strategy is fine in one sense: Iraqiisation of security and support for the </p>
<p>democratic political process. The problem is that the urgency of the situation may </p>
<p>overwhelm us and make our timelines for Iraqiisation naïve.</p>
<p>“The fact is Allawi needs help now; and there has to be a clear sense of our gripping </p>
<p>the situation now.”</p>
<p><b>56. </b> Mr Blair identified nine immediate actions, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing Prime Minister Allawi with “first-class political, media and strategic </p>
<p>capability … now”, drawing on “the best home-grown Iraqi talent” supported by </p>
<p>“our own people” who should be “hand-picked” immediately; </p>

<p> He reported to Mr Blair on 3 September that despite worsening security, </p>
<p>some progress was being made:</p>
<p>“But the pace of reconstruction is still too slow … </p>
<p>“DFID’s approach of encouraging the international system to help rebuild Iraq and </p>
<p>working through bilateral programmes at the national level (to build capacity in key </p>

<p>poverty) is still right. But I will want to see substantial progress on spending and </p>
<p>delivery before committing any more to the [World Bank and UN] Trust Funds. </p>
<p>I have therefore concentrated on new bilateral programmes this financial year.” </p>

<p>208</p>
<p><b>63. </b> The CIG judged that the situation in MND(SE) remained “fragile” and that there </p>
<p>had been considerable loss of public support for the MNF. Most Shia were likely to </p>
<p>continue to support the political process, but their consent depended on expectations </p>
<p>being met, including elections held on schedule and a government that reflected </p>
<p>their majority status. </p>
<p><b>64. </b> A continuing failure to improve public order, restore public services or create jobs </p>
<p>would also increase disillusionment, risking renewed unrest.</p>
<p><b>65. </b> During Mr Benn’s visit to Iraq, officials in the British Embassy Office Basra raised </p>
<p>concerns over the operation of the World Bank and UN Trust Funds.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>66. </b> DFID responded to those concerns on 6 September: </p>
<p>“Basra are right that getting PCO and Trust Fund programmes moving faster is </p>
<p>critical, but not that our contribution to the Trust Funds is pointless.” </p>
<p><b>67. </b> The Trust Funds had several purposes:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to deliver reconstruction on the ground;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to allow donors to pool resources and streamline procedures. This reduces </p>
<p>their overheads, and gives the Iraqis fewer donors with their own priorities </p>
<p>and procedures to negotiate with; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to encourage the UN and the World Bank to re-engage”.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> The World Bank and the UN had now started disbursing money from the Trust </p>
<p>Funds, and the Iraqi Minister for Planning and Development Co-ordination had told </p>
<p>Mr Benn that he was “much happier” with collaboration with the World Bank and UN. </p>
<p><b>69. </b> DFID concluded the Trust Funds had been set up “to deliver medium-term benefits </p>
<p>to Iraq rather than quick fixes”. The test now was delivery. </p>
<p><b>70. </b> On 9 September, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr David Quarrey, a Private Secretary to </p>

<p>see a major dividend before the elections in January.” </p>
<p><b>72. </b> During his visit, Sir Nigel met Prime Minister Allawi, who stated that the political, </p>

<p> A copy of the record of that meeting was sent to Mr Benn’s </p>

<p>had been able to “feel the difference” since the transfer of sovereignty.</p>

<p> Sunni outreach </p>
<p>was needed in the South, where the mood was one of “persistent victimisation”. </p>
<p>Reconstruction activity was continuing, but had been adversely affected by the </p>
<p>security situation.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> During his video conference with President Bush on 9 September, Mr Blair raised </p>
<p>both the need to accelerate Iraqiisation and for enhanced capacity within the IIG, without </p>
<p>which “too much fell on Allawi himself”.</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> The existing timelines for improved security and </p>
<p>services were “too long” and risked delaying the election. </p>
<p><b>75. </b> Mr Quarrey wrote to Mr Benn’s Principal Private Secretary on 14 September, </p>
<p>responding to Mr Benn’s 3 September visit report: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister believes that we must continue to do all we can on this </p>

<p>tangible benefit before the elections. We have a particular responsibility to deliver </p>

<p><b>83. </b> Mr Blair asked Prime Minister Allawi whether he had the “infrastructure” around </p>
<p>him to implement IIG policy. Prime Minister Allawi agreed there was a problem. Mr Blair </p>
<p>said that the UK would send “two or three people” to Baghdad to work on the issue. On </p>

<p>43</p>
<p> The Iraqi delegation said that there had been good </p>

<p>progress towards an agreement on debt relief. Mr Benn emphasised the importance of </p>
<p>reducing fuel subsidies if Iraq was to secure an IMF programme. Mr Hafez said that the </p>
<p>IIG was committed to reducing subsidies (which he estimated to account for 50 percent </p>
<p>of government expenditure), but there were political sensitivities. </p>
<p><b>89. </b> During a discussion of the World Bank and UN Trust Funds, Mr Benn encouraged </p>
<p>Prime Minister Allawi to press the UN to deploy staff to Iraq and to speed up </p>
<p>disbursements from their Trust Fund. The Iraqi delegation said that the reluctance of </p>
<p>the World Bank and IMF to engage raised questions about the value of multilateral (as </p>
<p>opposed to bilateral) assistance. Mr Benn said that “DFID was concentrating on bilateral </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s infrastructure had now been “stabilised” and some improvements had </p>
<p>been made. But Iraqi citizens did not see that; it was vital for security that visible </p>
<p>progress was made fast, and that the IIG told Iraqi citizens what was being </p>
<p>achieved. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There were “very few” PCO staff in the South. Could the US speed up the </p>
<p>deployment of PCO staff, and give USAID a bigger role? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi systems were not yet working. The US and UK needed to press Prime </p>
<p>Minister Allawi to get Iraqi oil revenues into the provinces, and press the UN and </p>
<p>World Bank to deploy experts.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> Mr Quarrey’s briefing for Mr Blair suggested that he could refer to Prime Minister </p>
<p>Allawi’s concern about the pace of delivery on reconstruction.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>93. </b> In a telephone conversation with President Bush on 24 September, Mr Blair set out </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>accelerating work to show the ISF had capacity to act; and </p>

<p>48</p>
<p><b>95. </b> There was as yet insufficient evidence to decide whether DFID should make </p>

<p>needed a quick agreement on debt relief and faster implementation of pledges made by </p>
<p>donors at the Madrid Donor Conference, in line with the priorities outlined in the NDS.</p>
<p><b>99. </b> The IMF and World Bank presented a “relatively positive” assessment of Iraq’s </p>
<p>economy, including higher than expected oil revenues. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> At the meeting, Mr Jim Drummond, DFID Director Iraq, underlined the importance </p>
<p>of Iraqi leadership of the reconstruction process, urged faster disbursement from the </p>
<p>World Bank and UN Trust Funds, and encouraged more donors to contribute to them. </p>
<p><b>101. </b> The British Embassy Tokyo reported that the international community had come </p>
<p>together behind “a good Iraqi-led strategy”. Germany and France had engaged “more </p>
<p>than previously, but not yet with significant support”. There had been no significant new </p>
<p>pledges, but that was not surprising given the US$32bn pledged at Madrid and rising </p>
<p>Iraqi oil revenues. </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Mr Quarrey passed the Cabinet Office’s paper on reconstruction in Najaf and other </p>
<p>key cities and the DFID paper on how to accelerate reconstruction on the ground in the </p>
<p>wake of the Tokyo Donor Conference to Mr Blair on 22 October.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>115. </b> The Cabinet Office paper concluded that “the general impression is that, as yet, </p>
<p>there is no systematic or co-ordinated approach to these key cities”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> It identified a </p>
<p>number of lessons, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was possible for political deals to hold long enough for the IIG/PCO to </p>
<p>deliver enough reconstruction to start building public support and discredit the </p>
<p>insurgents.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There needed to be a sufficient continuing ISF presence for the IIG to remain </p>
<p>in control and to facilitate reconstruction. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>IIG and to some extent PCO capacity to deliver reconstruction quickly was very </p>
<p>limited. CERPs delivered impact most quickly. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> The DFID paper on the follow-up to the Tokyo donors meeting advised that while </p>
<p>the procedural obstacles to spending US and Trust Fund allocations had largely been </p>
<p>overcome, the security situation was worse.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> To “get round” that problem, there was </p>
<p>now a greater emphasis on using Iraqi systems and contractors. In that context, to </p>
<p>accelerate the pace of reconstruction, the UK needed to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Persuade the World Bank and UN at the top level to move fast, and to send </p>
<p>development specialists to Iraq. Mr Benn had lobbied the UN Secretary-General </p>
<p>Kofi Annan on 19 October.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Provide funding and security for World Bank and UN liaison staff. DFID funded </p>
<p>and housed one liaison officer for each of the World Bank and UN in Baghdad, </p>
<p>and was considering funding a UN liaison officer in Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support the PCO. The Head of the US Iraq Reconstruction and Management </p>
<p>Office (IRMO) had told the UK that he wanted to work closely with the UK, but </p>
<p>that he did not want UK staff in the PCO.</p>
<p><b>117. </b> Mr Quarrey commented on the DFID paper:</p>
<p>“Lots of good points here about the UN and World Bank. But nothing on our bilateral </p>
<p>programme and what more we might be able to do with that …” </p>

<p><b>118. </b> Mr Quarrey commented on the Cabinet Office paper: </p>
<p>“Not an encouraging picture … It looks like we are a long way from the sort of </p>
<p>integrated political/security/reconstruction packages for these key cities that we, </p>
<p>the US and Allawi keep talking about.</p>
<p>“We must do better on this. The lack of any reference in the DFID note to this key </p>
<p>issue is striking.”</p>
<p><b>119. </b> Mr Blair replied: “We need to get tougher with DFID on this. Let me minute </p>
<p>Hilary [Benn]. It’s not good enough.” </p>

<p>US had allocated US$7m from CERPs for projects in the immediate aftermath of military </p>
<p>operations in Fallujah.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Blair wrote to Mr Benn on 26 October:</p>
<p>“I remain concerned that actual delivery of reconstruction on the ground is far </p>
<p>too slow … </p>
<p>“We must accelerate the pace of reconstruction, not least to support the political </p>
<p>process as we head towards the elections. The note [on the Tokyo donors meeting] </p>
<p>includes some good ideas on pressing the UN and World Bank. But we also need </p>
<p>to increase the impact of your bilateral programme in the short term. And we need </p>
<p>to find more effective ways of getting the US to spend their funds more quickly and </p>
<p>with greater impact. </p>
<p>“I am particularly concerned about the lack of follow-through on reconstruction in </p>
<p>those cities and towns where the IIG, with MNF support, has regained control from </p>
<p>insurgents (e.g. Najaf, Samarra, Tal Afar). These are, of course, not in the MND(SE) </p>
<p>region where our spending is concentrated. But DFID has considerable experience </p>
<p>of post-conflict situations which I would like to see us using across Iraq.” </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>122. </b> Mr Hoon briefed the 28 October meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>on US military plans for a “short, sharp campaign” in Fallujah.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>123. </b> At the meeting, Mr Benn said that DFID continued to press the PCO, but a recent </p>
<p>proposal to second a UK development adviser to the PCO had been turned down by the </p>
<p>US. It was difficult for the UK to offer additional assistance in cities like Fallujah “as the </p>
<p>US was already engaged and sufficient funds were available”. </p>

<p><b>124. </b> Mr Benn reported that he had spoken to UN Secretary-General Annan, and thought </p>
<p>it unlikely the UN would deploy more staff to Iraq before the elections (the UN currently </p>
<p>had two officers in Iraq, one supported by DFID). </p>
<p><b>125. </b> Mr Benn said that he would be happy to help the MOD with funding for QIPs if it </p>
<p>was better able to implement projects than civilian experts.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Cabinet Office, DFID, FCO and MOD officials met on the same day to consider, </p>
<p>at No.10’s request, how to “push forward” PCO reconstruction efforts.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> The meeting </p>
<p>agreed that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase efforts to monitor PCO activity across Iraq, although with a focus on </p>
<p>MND(SE); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>make an “open-ended” offer of support to the US for PCO programmes across </p>
<p>Iraq (not just in the South). </p>

<p><b>128. </b> Mr Quarrey advised Mr Blair on 2 November that “planning for the post-conflict </p>
<p>phase remains inadequate, and the US now seem resigned to this”.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>129. </b> A DFID official based in Basra advised Mr Drummond on 3 November that PCO </p>
<p>projects in the South remained “almost invisible” to the general public, and that Iraqi </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>130. </b> Mr Blair met Prime Minister Allawi in Brussels on 5 November. </p>

<p>needs to cover before he approves any military action” in Fallujah.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> Those included </p>
<p>“the follow-up package of political and economic measures”. The US said they had </p>
<p>funding ready, but the IIG’s own preparations looked inadequate. Prime Minister Allawi </p>
<p>had to take responsibility for those preparations. </p>
<p><b>132. </b> At the meeting, Mr Blair said that:</p>
<p>“… he [Prime Minister Allawi] knew the military commanders were keen to move </p>

<p><b>135. </b> Mr Benn replied to Mr Blair’s letter of 26 October on 10 November.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“I share many of your concerns about the pace of reconstruction and development in </p>
<p>Iraq. However, we should take encouragement from the Iraqi Interim Government’s </p>
<p>National Development Strategy, the extra resources (about US$3bn) that the high oil </p>
<p>price gives them, and the new arrangements that Allawi is making in his own office, </p>
<p>with DFID advice, to lead reconstruction … </p>
<p>“Security is much more difficult than we anticipated and is getting worse around </p>
<p>Baghdad. Many contractors, including those that we regularly use to work in </p>
<p>post-conflict environments such as Crown Agents, are unwilling to send staff outside </p>
<p>Baghdad or Basra at present. This is affecting all donors. But we can do more. Our </p>
<p>£6m employment generation project will start to create jobs this month … I have </p>

<p><b>137. </b> On Mr Blair’s suggestions that the UK needed to find more effective ways of getting </p>
<p>the US to spend its funds more quickly and with greater impact, and that DFID should </p>
<p>use its experience of post-conflict situations across Iraq (not just in the South), Mr Benn </p>
<p>responded: </p>
<p>“We will get closer to the Project Contracting Office (PCO). Our Basra sector </p>

<p>close relations with PCO counterparts in Baghdad, including the new (good) head, </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Crompton reported to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that Lt Gen Kiszely was </p>
<p>“calm, but clearly taken aback by the damage he had seen”. The IPU was:</p>
<p>“… in touch with DFID to see whether they can assist with the humanitarian effort, </p>
<p>and are feeding in some ideas to Kiszely on how best to approach the reconstruction </p>
<p>task, using lessons learnt in Kosovo and elsewhere”. </p>

<p>Lt Gen Kiszely’s conclusions, and that the Red Cross and Red Crescent were being </p>
<p>allowed into the city.</p>
<p>80</p>
<p> At least US$58m had been earmarked for reconstruction. The </p>
<p>IIG estimated that there were 250,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) from Fallujah, </p>
<p>about 95 percent of whom were staying with family or friends. The Iraqi Ministry of </p>
<p>Health reported that there were “no major humanitarian problems”. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> The Annotated Agenda stated that Prime Minister Allawi had established a Cabinet </p>
<p>Reconstruction Committee, whose first tasks would be to co-ordinate reconstruction </p>
<p>spending in cities won back from insurgent control and to spend US$200m of Iraqi </p>
<p>money for emergency reconstruction in the period up to the elections. DFID advisers </p>
<p>were “linked in well” and assisting the Committee. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that the PCO had declined DFID’s offer to </p>
<p>“second a senior reconstruction specialist or more technical help in Baghdad”. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> Gen Walker told the meeting there had been a slow start to reconstruction in </p>
<p>Fallujah.</p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald spoke to Dr Rice later that day, and expressed his concern that </p>
<p>humanitarian and reconstruction efforts in Fallujah had been slow to get off the ground.</p>
<p>82</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported that Dr Rice shared that concern, but thought that some humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance was now getting into the city, and “everyone was adamant” that there was </p>
<p>no humanitarian crisis. </p>
<p><b>151. </b> The FCO advised No.10 on 19 November that there were “plenty of resources </p>
<p>available” for Fallujah’s reconstruction.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> The IIG’s response was poorly co-ordinated. </p>
<p>The UK would monitor the IIG’s response, and would feed in advice on the best way to </p>
<p>reconstruct houses damaged in the fighting. The UK had advised Lt Gen Kiszely that the </p>
<p>most effective approach would be to give each family a sum of money “for them to go </p>
<p>and see to the re-building themselves”. That approach, used in Kosovo, would ensure </p>
<p>that the money was ploughed back into the Fallujah economy and secure residents’ </p>
<p>“buy-in” to reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> In his weekly report to Gen Walker on 21 November, Lt Gen Kiszely advised </p>
<p>that planning for reconstruction was “well developed” within the US Embassy, led by </p>
<p>IRMO, but almost none had taken place in the IIG.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> Prime Minister Allawi was now </p>
<p>“cracking the whip”, which should lead to greater Iraqi Ministerial engagement. With so </p>
<p>few inhabitants in the city, there was no humanitarian crisis, and the “vast majority” of </p>
<p>displaced people had found accommodation with extended family or friends. There were </p>
<p>some small tented camps around Fallujah, to which NGOs were delivering supplies. The </p>
<p>immediate priorities were to clarify the situation and co-ordinate activity; in the absence </p>
<p>of the IIG, that fell to MNF-I. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely also advised that his appointment as “MNF-I co-ordinator for </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance and reconstruction” had been prompted by Gen Casey’s </p>
<p>concern about the scale of the humanitarian and reconstruction challenge.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> Lt Gen Kiszely told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… by the end of November/early December, it was quite clear that this [military] </p>
<p>operation was going to be successful. And the big concern for the Americans </p>
<p>was what was going to happen afterwards: was this going to be a microcosm, if </p>
<p>you like, of the campaign as a whole in which the reconstruction phase was not </p>
<p>properly planned for, or were they going to ensure that it was properly planned </p>
<p>and managed? And they very much focused on getting this right.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>222</p>
<p><b>155. </b> President Bush and Mr Blair spoke by video conference on 30 November. </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s briefing stated that he should raise Prime Minister Allawi’s concern that </p>
<p>humanitarian and reconstruction assistance was not getting into Fallujah and other key </p>
<p>spots quickly enough.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p><b>156. </b> During the video conference, Mr Blair said that Fallujah “had gone well” and the </p>
<p>story of what US forces had found there – including evidence of torture chambers – </p>
<p>should be put into the public domain.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> He suggested that the operation had “sent a clear </p>
<p>message that the insurgents could not win”.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> The record of the video conference did not include any reference to the </p>
<p>humanitarian and reconstruction effort in Fallujah or other “key spots”. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> Ms Margaret Aldred, Deputy Head Overseas and Defence Secretariat in the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, advised Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 1 December, in the context of a </p>
<p>report on the situation in Fallujah, that she had received reports that a DFID adviser </p>
<p>and a DFID-funded consultant attached to the Cabinet Reconstruction Committee </p>
<p>were beginning to make a difference.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> Those individuals had been re-deployed from </p>
<p>within Iraq.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>159. </b> A second DFID-funded consultant, Dr Gilbert Greenall, had arrived in Iraq that day </p>
<p>to advise Lt Gen Kiszely on the phased return of IDPs to Fallujah.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>160. </b> Mr Suma Chakrabarti, the DFID Permanent Secretary, and Mr Drummond reported </p>
<p>to Mr Benn on 13 December:</p>
<p>“DFID provides the core of Allawi’s co-ordination team on Fallujah …</p>
<p>“Fallujah demonstrates that neither the IIG nor the US thought through the </p>
<p>humanitarian aspects of military actions, though they had allocated money for </p>
<p>reconstruction. For the next few weeks we need to have immediate post-conflict </p>
<p>expertise in the DFID Office in Baghdad …” </p>
<p>91</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Benn told the 16 December meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq </p>
<p>that the IIG, with the support of DFID advisers, had put together a package of basic </p>
<p>humanitarian support and funds for the reconstruction of homes in preparation for the </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>223</p>
<p><b>162. </b> Section 9.3 describes the impact of operations in Fallujah on security and the </p>
<p>political process. </p>
<p><b>163. </b> Five months later, on 12 May, the British Embassy Baghdad reported that Embassy </p>
<p>staff had visited Fallujah, hosted by US forces.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> The scale of destruction was apparent, </p>
<p>but there was also progress:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between 90,000 and 150,000 of Fallujah’s estimated 240,000 inhabitants </p>
<p>had returned.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>All water treatment plants, tanks and pipes had been restored and two new </p>
<p>pumping facilities had been installed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Electricity had been restored to between 80 and 100 percent of the main </p>
<p>residential area, but only to between 0 and 40 percent of the “industrial south”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Of the city’s 69 schools, 38 were open and 15 would open by the end of the </p>
<p>month. “Huge progress” had been made in restoring healthcare.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> The Embassy commented:</p>
<p>“This may be an over-rosy view of developments in Fallujah, it was a determined </p>
<p>PR [public relations] effort, but the signs of life around the town spoke volumes. </p>
<p>Likewise, the prominence of Iraqis throughout the visit and US willingness to let </p>
<p>them lead was not what we had expected. Congratulations to the US Marines!”</p>
<p><b>Lessons from Najaf </b></p>
<p>In late January 2005, Dr Greenall and another DFID-funded consultant visited Najaf to </p>
<p>review progress since the US intervention in August 2004 and to identify lessons for future </p>
<p>operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>94</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Their assessment was more positive than the Cabinet Office paper of 22 October 2004. </p>
<p>The consultants reported that although the short conflict had resulted in considerable </p>
<p>damage, there was a “permissive environment” on the streets. That could be attributed </p>
<p>largely to an effective post-conflict assistance strategy: US$48m had been allocated </p>
<p>for projects and “social payments”, with 156 projects being completed in the first </p>
<p>100 days after the uprising. Funding had come from CERPs, PCO funds re-directed </p>
<p>away from large infrastructure projects, and USAID. The impact on the local economy </p>
<p>had been substantial. </p>
<p>A key strength of the US military’s approach had been to engage directly with the </p>
<p>Provincial Governor and the Mayor to ensure local ownership. The Governor remained </p>
<p>frustrated, however, by the level of support from the Iraqi Government.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>Ms Lindy Cameron, the Head of DFID Baghdad, commented on the report that while Najaf </p>
<p>was not typical of “problem cities”: </p>
<p>“Nevertheless, it demonstrates the importance of having in place a clear strategy </p>
<p>for immediate post-conflict support so that the military can help civilian authorities </p>
<p>get instant access to funds, take immediate action, get essential services running </p>
<p>and put money into the local economy, starting a virtuous circle leading in the </p>
<p>longer-term (as in Najaf) to a conducive environment for large infrastructure projects, </p>
<p>re-establishment of normal market mechanisms and a benign force profile.” </p>
<p>There are no indications that Mr Blair or Ministers saw the report. </p>
<p><b>Agreement on debt relief for Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>165. </b> Section 10.3 describes the UK Government’s role in negotiations towards a deal </p>
<p>to reduce Iraq’s debt.</p>
<p><b>166. </b> On 24 September, as part of those negotiations, the Iraqi Government undertook </p>
<p>to begin to reduce fuel subsidies by the end of the year, and to raise prices to “cost </p>
<p>recovery levels” by the end of 2009.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>167. </b> On 21 November, Paris Club creditors agreed to reduce Iraq’s official debt by </p>
<p>80 percent (a reduction of US$31.1bn).</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> The deal would be delivered in three stages:  </p>
<p>30 percent immediately; 30 percent on IMF approval of a Stand-By Arrangement </p>
<p>(expected to be in 2005); and 20 percent on completion of the Stand-By Arrangement </p>
<p>(in 2008). Paris Club creditors also agreed generous terms for the repayment of the </p>
<p>residual debt. </p>
<p><b>168. </b> Under the agreement, the UK wrote off US$1.39bn (£954m) in Iraqi debt </p>
<p>(£337m in UK financial year 2004/05, £337m in 2005/06 and £280m in 2008/09).</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>171. </b> At the end of 2004, in response to continuing concerns that the US and the PCO </p>
<p>did not see the South as a priority and that the World Bank and UN Trust Funds were </p>
<p>not yet fully operational, DFID assessed that it would have to “take more of the strain </p>
<p>bilaterally in 2005”, in particular on infrastructure and job creation in the South. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> On 18 November, in response to a request from the FCO, Mr Collis reported on </p>
<p>the state of reconstruction in the South.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> The IIG was not funding any significant capital </p>
<p>projects in the South and the PCO remained a “weak and Baghdad-centric” organisation. </p>
<p>PCO projects would not have a significant impact on service delivery until well into 2005. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> DFID officials met senior PCO officials in Baghdad on 2 December.</p>
<p>100</p>
<p> The British </p>
<p>Embassy Baghdad reported that, in response to the security situation, the PCO planned </p>
<p>to focus on “low-hanging fruit” (visible projects such as repairs to schools and clinics) </p>
<p>at the expense of major longer-term reconstruction projects and building Iraqi capacity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, if the US Congress did not agree further funding for CERPs, the PCO was </p>
<p>likely to reallocate funds from stable to less secure areas. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The Embassy concluded: “We need to fight to keep PCO funding in the South.” </p>
<p><b>175. </b> At the 9 December meeting of the AHMGIR, Ministers commented that the PCO </p>
<p>was “large and unwieldy” and faced a difficult balance between quick fixes and long-term </p>
<p>reconstruction.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p> UK influence was limited: the PCO was a US organisation following US </p>
<p>rules “though it was sometimes open to UK advice”. Much of its effort was being pulled </p>
<p>into Fallujah and away from the South</p>
<p>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>176. </b> Mr Chakrabarti and Mr Drummond visited Baghdad and Basra from 6 to </p>
<p>8 December to review DFID’s programmes and assess priorities for 2005.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>177. </b> Their 13 December report to Mr Benn advised that with the PCO “diverted” to </p>
<p>immediate reconstruction work in cities around Baghdad, and the World Bank and </p>
<p>UN Trust Funds not yet fully operational, DFID would “have to take more of the strain </p>
<p>bilaterally in 2005”. DFID’s resources were, however, limited and “must be used to </p>
<p>support Iraqi initiatives and strengthen their capacity”. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> On PCO activity in the South, the report stated:</p>
<p>“As junior partners in the coalition, our ideas are listened to, but our influence over </p>
<p>US spending will remain limited. We need to face up to the fact: the South will not </p>
<p>be a strategic priority for the US.” </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a further contribution to the UN and World Bank Trust Funds when there was </p>
<p>hard evidence of delivery, and the UN was back on the ground. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> Copies of the report were sent to the FCO, the MOD, No.10, the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>and officials in Baghdad and Basra. </p>
<p><b>181. </b> DFID’s intentions were set out in more detail in a minute from Mr Drummond to </p>
<p>a DFID official two days later: </p>
<p>“… we will have to take more of the strain in 2005 on infrastructure. The TAT team </p>
<p>and others should begin thinking now about what can be done with UK resources </p>
<p>(possibly up to £50m) so that there are ideas ready to be appraised.” </p>
<p>103</p>

<p>Infrastructure Services Programme (IISP) in late February 2005.</p>
<p><b>183. </b> Mr Chaplin reported on 15 December that the US review of IRRF2 had reduced </p>
<p>funding for water and power projects in Basra.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> The reallocations had not been based </p>
<p>on Iraqi advice or geographical need, but on a US desire to avoid breaching existing </p>
<p>contracts and the PCO’s belief that larger projects in the South could be more easily </p>
<p>funded by other donors. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> Major General Jonathon Riley, General Officer Commanding (GOC) MND(SE), </p>

<p>set of complaints: that the promises made to them have been broken, that things are </p>

<p>but the amount of money cannot change the overall situation. DFID is working really </p>
<p>very efficiently, and we have a real partnership here, but this is not natural territory </p>
<p>for them and again, their funds will not change the overall situation. The solution </p>
<p>lies with Central Government in Baghdad and the PCO, which together have raided </p>

<p>struggling to maintain supplies of power and fuel as the insurgency took hold, and that </p>
<p>had abandoned hope of visible progress on reconstruction before the elections.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>187. </b> During his visit, Mr Blair asked Gen Riley for advice on “big-ticket” items that might </p>
<p>make a difference to the economy and essential services of southern Iraq.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p><b>188. </b> Mr Quarrey’s report on the visit recorded that “Iraqiisation and political outreach </p>

<p>109</p>
<p> Mr Blair remained “very concerned about the slow pace of </p>
<p>reconstruction spending, especially in the South” and about the funding available for </p>
<p>Iraqiisation, and wanted the UK to make a major effort to secure greater funding for </p>
<p>both, in particular from the US. A copy of the report was sent to Mr Benn’s Principal </p>

<p><b>189. </b> Gen Riley responded to Mr Blair’s request for big-ticket projects on 3 January </p>

<p>should aim to build a 200 megawatt (MW) gas turbine plant in the South at a cost of up </p>
<p>to US$100m.</p>

<p>USAID estimated that up to four additional power stations needed to be </p>
<p>constructed in Iraq each year to 2020, but only one was currently planned in the South, </p>
<p>which would be funded by Japan. A new power plant would be a visible contribution </p>

<p><b>Basra International Airport reopens to commercial traffic</b></p>
<p>UK forces continued to provide air traffic control and certain other services at Basra </p>
<p>International Airport (BIA) after the transition from the CPA to the IIG on 28 June 2004.</p>
<p>During the Occupation, the UK considered but rejected opening BIA to commercial flights, </p>
<p>due to the potential liability for the UK (see Section 10.1). </p>
<p>On 14 December, the UK and IIG signed a Memorandum of Understanding indemnifying </p>
<p>the UK Government and its agents against all claims arising from the provision of services </p>
<p>by UK personnel at BIA.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Following that agreement, BIA reopened to commercial traffic on 1 January 2005.</p>

<p>and the UK should support Prime Minister Allawi’s new security plan (see Section 9.3).</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A key issue would be funding. Reconstruction would not be a problem once the security </p>
<p>situation improved. Mr Blair asked if the US could, in the short term, redirect some US </p>
<p>reconstruction funding to security.</p>
<p><b>193. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Mr Stephen Hadley, US Deputy National Security </p>
<p>Advisor, a Note by Mr Blair on 10 January, and asked him to show it to President Bush </p>
<p>before their video conference the following day.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> Mr Blair’s Note covered “our most </p>
<p>pressing problems”. </p>
<p><b>194. </b> On Iraq, he judged:</p>
<p>“All the problems go back to security. Without it the politics are difficult, the </p>
<p>reconstruction shackled and the faith of Iraqis in the future undermined.”</p>
<p><b>195. </b> Mr Blair considered that four actions were necessary:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqiisation of security forces;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>spending money more quickly on reconstruction, especially of essential services;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>being “very tough indeed on the election”, including by ensuring it went ahead </p>
<p>on schedule and encouraging participation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>signalling a timetable for the withdrawal of US and UK forces “when and only </p>
<p>when, we can point to real indigenous Iraqi strength”.</p>

<p>for reconstruction.” However, in those parts of Iraq where security was reasonable, </p>
<p>reconstruction funds should be spent more quickly. This would have a powerful </p>

<p><b>199. </b> DFID provided the Inquiry with a version of the Delivery Plan marked “Draft”, </p>

<p>118</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>200. </b> In relation to Iraq, the draft Delivery Plan stated that DFID was seeking to “strike </p>
<p>a sensible balance between short-term fixes and longer-term development”.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> DFID </p>
<p>planned to scale down its assistance over the following three years, shifting from </p>
<p>“post-conflict reconstruction” towards targeted technical assistance. </p>
<p><b>201. </b> Limiting EMAD expenditure on Middle Income Countries (MICs), including </p>
<p>Iraq, would be a “key factor” in ensuring that DFID met its target of spending at least </p>
<p>90 percent of country programme resources on Lower Income Countries (LICs) in each </p>
<p>year from 2005/06 to 2007/08. Attaining the target for 2005/06 would require some </p>
<p>£20m of in-year savings from MIC budgets.</p>
<p><b>202. </b> The draft Delivery Plan stated that the current, agreed DFID budget for Iraq for </p>
<p>2005/06 was £86m (reducing to £45m and £30m in the subsequent financial years). </p>
<p>However:</p>
<p>“It has been agreed that £20m savings in MIC programmes should be found through </p>
<p>in-year and between-year management of spending. We expect the bulk of these </p>
<p>savings will be found from underspending on the Iraq budget; bringing the expected </p>
<p>spend on Iraq to closer to £66m than the full aid framework allocation of £86m …” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>204. </b> The 25 and 26 January 2005 meeting of DFID’s Management Board “noted that </p>
<p>the anticipated reduction (£20m) of <b>programme spend in Iraq</b> should enable … <b>LIC </b></p>
<p><b>commitments</b> to be met in 2005/06”.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>205. </b> A junior DFID official advised colleagues the following week that the Management </p>
<p>Board had imposed a “cap” on Iraq expenditure for 2005/06 of £65m.</p>
<p>121 </p>
<p>She commented </p>
<p>that the decision was “largely to ensure that we do not undermine the agreed MIC/LIC </p>
<p>targets”.</p>
<p><b>206. </b> The official also advised that DFID’s overall budget was “running very hot” and that </p>
<p>DFID’s Finance Department had “both eyes” on the £40m of Iraq’s 2004/05 budget that </p>
<p>had not yet been allocated. </p>
<p><b>207. </b> The £65m budget for Iraq for 2005/06 was formally confirmed on 14 March.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p><b>208. </b> DFID’s Iraq Directorate undertook internal exercises in February and March to </p>
<p>prioritise expenditure against the new, lower budget.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>209. </b> The March exercise estimated that “commitments and plans” for Iraq for 2005/06 </p>
<p>totalled £123m (against the budget of £65m), of which: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£59m was “firm”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£55m was high priority (including £40m for the planned Iraq Infrastructure </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>The apparent overspend against DFID’s 2005/06 budget was caused by the FCO charge </p>
<p>for life support costs. </p>
<p>DFID’s expenditure on infrastructure projects peaked in 2005/06. Of the £45m spent on </p>
<p>non-life support costs in 2005/06, £35m – over 75 percent – was spent on infrastructure.</p>

<p>In comparison, DFID spent £15m on infrastructure in 2004/05 and £14m in 2006/07. </p>
<p><b>Priorities for 2005</b></p>
<p><b>210. </b> In February, Ministers agreed UK priorities for 2005, including “reviewing </p>
<p>reconstruction to find ways to make a difference quickly”.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> On 21 January, No.10 commissioned the Cabinet Office to produce a paper on </p>
<p>Iraqiisation, the UK’s military options and a game plan for engaging the US, to support </p>
<p>a discussion on UK strategy after the Iraqi elections.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>212. </b> The 28 January meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) discussed a draft of that </p>
<p>paper.</p>
<p>129</p>
<p> Sir Nigel Sheinwald said that Mr Blair would also want the paper to consider </p>
<p>“what could be done to achieve quick and labour-creating results on reconstruction </p>
<p>including outside MND(SE)”. </p>
<p><b>213. </b> Sir Nigel asked that the paper also consider the involvement of the wider </p>
<p>international community in military, police and civil administrative capacity-building. </p>
<p><b>214. </b> The elections to the Transitional National Assembly (TNA) and Provincial </p>
<p>Assemblies took place across Iraq on 30 January 2005. The TNA did not convene until </p>
<p>16 March, after which negotiations to form the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) </p>
<p>continued into late April (see Section 9.3).</p>
<p><b>215. </b> On 1 February, Mr Blair suggested to President Bush that they should focus on </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>political outreach, including “whittling away at the opposition, so that the hard </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>232</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Mr Blair proposed that these areas should be drawn into a plan by the ITG, which </p>
<p>the UK and US could then support. </p>
<p><b>217. </b> On 3 February, just before the announcement of the election results, the Joint </p>
<p>Intelligence Committee (JIC) assessed the nature and strength of the insurgency.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite operational successes in Sunni areas:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“… the military campaign is not effectively containing the insurgency in Sunni areas. </p>
<p>Law and order, the pace of economic reconstruction, the availability of jobs and </p>
<p>general quality of life have not matched [Sunni] expectations. Most Sunnis perceive </p>
<p>themselves to be worse off economically, and in security terms than under Saddam. </p>
<p>Sunni ‘hearts and minds’ are being lost.” </p>
<p><b>218. </b> The JIC assessed that the election results were likely to be less important in </p>
<p>determining Sunni support for the insurgency than the degree to which credible Sunnis </p>
<p>could be brought into the political process, “the speed at which reconstruction is taken </p>
<p>forward” and the duration of the coalition’s presence in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> A revised Cabinet Office strategy, drawing on the JIC assessment, was submitted </p>
<p>to the 9 February Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq, chaired by Mr Blair.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> The key </p>
<p>elements of the strategy for the coming year were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capability of the ISF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>outreach by the ITG to bring in those currently supporting the insurgency;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing in the international community and giving it a new sense of purpose </p>
<p>(including getting the UN to do more on reconstruction); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“reviewing reconstruction to find ways to make a difference quickly”.</p>
<p><b>220. </b> The strategy identified key “governance and reconstruction” challenges in 2005, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the weak capacity of Iraqi Government institutions to drive reconstruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>sustained improvements in the availability of fuel and electricity needing difficult </p>
<p>reforms and a crackdown on corruption and sabotage;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the limited presence on the ground of international agencies and NGOs; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring all Iraq benefited (“the South is not a strategic priority for the US”).</p>
<p><b>221. </b> The six “governance and reconstruction” actions for the UK before the ITG was </p>
<p>formed were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparing key messages to the new government on reconstruction priorities, </p>
<p>focusing on developing a stronger relationship between Baghdad and the </p>
<p>governorates;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working with the US to make its reconstruction effort more effective. The US </p>
<p>should focus on rapid job creation, and directly fund Iraqi ministries;</p>

<p><b>222. </b> ITG ownership of governance and reconstruction would be crucial. The UK would </p>
<p>strengthen the ITG’s strategic communications capacity, to ensure that successes were </p>
<p>promulgated. </p>
<p><b>223. </b> The strategy also identified a number of economic priorities:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring the UK “plays its part” in achieving a “fair and sustainable” solution to </p>
<p>Iraq’s debt problems. Iraq would need to secure comparable debt relief from </p>
<p>non-Paris Club debtors;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encouraging Iraq to complete its IMF programme;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to support economic reform;</p>

<p>promoting an “efficient, outward looking and transparent” oil and energy industry </p>
<p>and the transparent management of Iraq’s oil reserves; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>advising on an effective response to inflationary risks.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> The strategy stated that the UK’s current posture in Iraq was costing around </p>
<p>£1bn a year, but did not comment on whether this amount was appropriate or sufficient. </p>
<p><b>225. </b> In discussion, Ministers commented that it was essential that the security, </p>
<p>political and reconstruction tracks were synchronised if the UK was to achieve its </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> If necessary, the UK should push ahead with plans for security and </p>
<p>reconstruction in MND(SE), in advance of developments in the rest of the country. </p>
<p><b>226. </b> The Group approved the strategy and agreed that No.10 should pass an updated </p>
<p>version to the US, raising the issue of diversion of US funding for reconstruction projects </p>
<p>from the South to other parts of the country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>227. </b> The Group also agreed that Mr Blair and Mr Benn should press Mr Annan and </p>

<p>234</p>
<p><b>229. </b> At the meeting of the ISG on the same day, Mr Martin Dinham, DFID Director </p>
<p>Europe, Middle East and Americas, set out what DFID would do “in response to </p>
<p>the renewed Ministerial mandate to press ahead with reconstruction, particularly in </p>
<p>MND(SE)”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> The £40m Iraq Infrastructure Services Programme (IISP) would be </p>
<p>approved in the next few weeks. More money was available for job creation if required. </p>
<p>But it was also key to get other donors engaged. Mr Benn and DFID officials were </p>
<p>lobbying the UN, World Bank and IMF. Officials in Basra were conducting a review of </p>
<p>infrastructure requirements to identify gaps. </p>
<p><b>230. </b> Mr Blair wrote to Mr Wolfensohn on 16 February, highlighting the slow pace of </p>
<p>delivery on Trust Fund projects and the value of having core World Bank staff (rather </p>
<p>than a contracted liaison officer) in Iraq, and offering to provide accommodation and </p>
<p>security for World Bank staff in Baghdad and Basra.</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>231. </b> Mr Benn wrote to Mr Wolfensohn the following day:</p>
<p>“We need to seek innovative ways of managing the difficulties and risks associated </p>
<p>with working in present-day Iraq. The [World] Bank might need to reallocate funding </p>
<p>to new projects that can be delivered … One way to do this might be to channel </p>
<p>funding directly through provincial government systems to their priority projects.” </p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>232. </b> Mr Benn repeated Mr Blair’s offer to provide support for World Bank staff in Iraq, </p>
<p>and highlighted the need for a strong World Bank presence in the power sector. </p>
<p><b>233. </b> Mr Dinham followed up those proposals in meetings with World Bank officials </p>
<p>during a visit to New York and Washington from 21 to 24 February.</p>

<p>number of staff supporting the election process. </p>

<p>might redirect some Trust Fund money into co-financing DFID’s IISP, or through the </p>
<p>provincial governments which DFID was supporting. </p>
<p><b>237. </b> In a meeting with IMF officials, Mr Dinham offered DFID support to help establish </p>
<p>an IMF presence in Iraq. He reported that the IMF was “more responsive” to the offer </p>
<p>than the World Bank. </p>
<p><b>238. </b> In Washington, US State Department officials briefed Mr Dinham on US plans </p>
<p>to re-programme some reconstruction funds to fund security in areas where no </p>
<p>reconstruction could take place, and to increase funding for projects that would have </p>
<p>more immediate impact on the ground. That meant cutting some larger infrastructure </p>
<p>projects, including in the South. The US objective was to encourage other donors, in </p>
<p>particular Japan, Arab states and possibly the European Commission (EC), to take on </p>
<p>longer-term infrastructure projects. </p>
<p><b>239. </b> In meetings with UN officials, Mr Dinham welcomed progress in implementing UN </p>
<p>Trust Fund projects (although he felt that it could be faster) and the news that two UN </p>
<p>senior development officials were now permanently based in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>240. </b> The DFID review of infrastructure requirements in the South referred to by </p>
<p>Mr Dinham at the 11 February meeting of the ISG was submitted to the 24 February </p>
<p>meeting of the AHMGIR.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>241. </b> The paper stated that a DFID team had recently assessed how DFID could help </p>
<p>improve infrastructure in southern Iraq. As a result, Mr Benn had “approved work to bring </p>
<p>forward quickly” DFID’s £40m IISP. </p>
<p><b>242. </b> The majority of IISP funds would be used to undertake repairs and improvements </p>
<p>to existing infrastructure. To ensure a visible impact on the ground, the programme </p>
<p>would fund larger projects (with a value of more than £500,000). Priority would be given </p>
<p>to projects which would have an impact within six to 12 months and generate significant </p>
<p>employment. 75 percent of the budget was earmarked for power, the rest to improve </p>
<p>water supplies and the fuel distribution network.</p>
<p><b>243. </b> The paper stated that an “alternative approach” would be to invest available </p>
<p>resources in new power generation. That would take several years to come on line and </p>
<p>would be “a drop in the ocean” of Iraq’s power needs. Substantially greater and quicker </p>
<p>impact could be achieved by well-targeted repairs and rehabilitation, and building </p>
<p>Iraqi capacity. </p>
<p><b>244. </b> The paper also stated that: “Taken with existing commitments, this new programme </p>
<p>[the IISP] means that there will be little scope for additional DFID initiatives in Iraq that </p>
<p>involve expenditure in 2005/06.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>236</p>
<p><b>245. </b> The Inquiry concludes that the (brief) consideration of investment in new power </p>
<p>generation may have been prompted by Gen Riley’s 3 February proposal, in response </p>
<p>to Mr Blair’s request for advice on “big-ticket” items, that the UK should aim to build a </p>
<p>200MW gas turbine plant in the South at a cost of up to US$100m.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Benn on 25 February, highlighting the need to ensure that </p>
<p>the UK did all it could to alleviate power shortages in the South over the summer (before </p>
<p>projects under the IISP would begin to come on stream).</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> Plans for a US$10m project </p>
<p>to provide point power generation throughout MND(SE), funded by CERPs, were well </p>
<p>advanced. Mr Benn’s offer to consider whether DFID could fund the project if CERPs </p>
<p>funding was not released was very welcome. </p>
<p><b>247. </b> Mr Blair wrote a note to Mr Quarrey on 25 February instructing that Mr Straw be </p>
<p>“put in charge” of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq and asking him to report each </p>
<p>week with actions on “eg reconstruction in the South; Sunni outreach; progress on </p>

<p><b>249. </b> Following a meeting with Mr Benn on 8 March, Mr Michael Anderson, Head of </p>
<p>DFID’s Middle East and North Africa Department, advised officials in the UK Delegation </p>
<p>to the World Bank that Mr Benn had “very little patience” with the Bank:</p>
<p>“The SoS [Mr Benn] is very clear in his view that the slow disbursement by the Bank </p>
<p>under the IRFFI [Trust Fund] is unacceptable … </p>
<p>“… if the Bank is not able to show a significant increase in its engagement in Iraq by </p>
<p>the end of March, we will be writing to the Bank to seek refund of the funds to the </p>
<p>UK for disbursement through our bilateral programme … </p>
<p>“His commitment to this line is strong, and we will need to find a way to carry forward </p>
<p>his views despite the legal and reputational risks that may arise.”</p>

<p><b>Mr Benn’s evidence to the  </b></p>
<p><b>International Development Committee, 10 March 2005 </b></p>
<p>Mr Benn gave evidence to the International Development Committee (IDC) on </p>
<p>10 March 2005, as part of its inquiry into development assistance to Iraq.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> His hearing </p>
<p>followed a visit by three members of the IDC (Mr Quentin Davies, Mr Tony Colman and </p>
<p>Ms Ann Clwyd) to Iraq. </p>
<p>Mr Davies reported that he had been struck by the progress made in reconstruction and </p>
<p>building Iraqi capacity, and by the “very good” co-operation between DFID and the military </p>
<p>on the ground. He challenged Mr Benn on two issues. First, that the separate budgets </p>
<p>held by DFID and the MOD for reconstruction could lead to “some muddle”. Second, that </p>
<p>some of DFID’s work to build the capacity of the Iraqi Government was inconsistent with </p>
<p>the 2002 International Development Act. </p>
<p>Mr Benn welcomed the IDC’s observation that DFID and the MOD were working well </p>
<p>together on the ground. He commented:</p>
<p>“DFID has come into Iraq and done things that traditionally we would not do … Why? </p>
<p>Because that was what was required in the circumstances. We had to dust down </p>
<p>some skills and the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit [PCRU] is one of the lessons </p>
<p>from this …” </p>
<p>The PCRU and its role in Iraq is described in Section 10.3. </p>
<p>Mr Benn strongly rejected the charge that some of DFID’s work was inconsistent with </p>
<p>the 2002 International Development Act, arguing that capacity-building was crucial for </p>
<p>poverty reduction: </p>
<p>“… having states that work … governments that can do their job, is absolutely </p>
<p>fundamental to improving services and the lives of poor people.” </p>
<p>The imminent dissolution of Parliament brought the inquiry to a close. The IDC did not </p>
<p>publish a report, but did publish the evidence it had gathered as part of its inquiry.</p>
<p>The IDC did not undertake another inquiry into the UK’s reconstruction effort in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>250. </b> Gen Riley reported on 16 March that he was “still worried” about providing </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>251. </b> While he waited for approval of the point power generation project, he had ordered </p>
<p>MND(SE) to search for additional sources of energy and funding. They had identified </p>
<p>131 generators across the region, of which only 22 were working. Most of the inoperable </p>
<p>generators had never been installed. MND(SE) had completed the installation of 32 of </p>
<p>those generators. </p>
<p><b>252. </b> Mr Quarrey passed Gen Riley’s update to Mr Blair on 18 March, with the comment: </p>
<p>“The situation is bleak, with generation levels this summer unlikely on current </p>
<p>predictions to be significantly higher than last year – and almost certainly matched </p>
<p>by higher demand.” </p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>253. </b> Mr Quarrey advised that funding for the point power generation project (which </p>
<p>would become Operation AMPERE) had now been approved. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> The funding was provided by DFID.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>255. </b> Mr Quarrey also advised that officials were working on a new strategy paper on </p>
<p>electricity, but it focused too much on the medium term and not enough on what the </p>
<p>UK could do to improve the situation over the summer. He recommended that the next </p>
<p>AHMGIR should focus on producing a short-term action plan. </p>
<p><b>256. </b> Mr Blair indicated that he agreed with Mr Quarrey’s proposal, and that he would </p>
<p>raise the issue of power generation with President Bush.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>257. </b> A report on a visit to Iraq by senior DFID officials alerted other departments to </p>
<p>pressures on DFID’s budget.</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Mr Dinham and Mr Anderson visited Iraq from 14 to 19 March.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>259. </b> Mr Dinham’s report to Dr Nemat Shafik, DFID Director General Programmes, </p>
<p>characterised the DFID programme as “a balance of capacity building and visible, </p>
<p>quick impact reconstruction activity, particularly in the South”. There was “accelerated </p>
<p>progress” on both capacity building and reconstruction, helped by “excellent </p>
<p>collaboration” with the FCO and MOD. </p>
<p><b>260. </b> Mr Dinham warned that:</p>
<p>“One side effect of the good progress we are making … is that our Iraq budget </p>
<p>allocation for 2005/06 is under extreme pressure. If activities to which we are already </p>
<p>committed plus extensions of existing high priority capacity building programmes </p>
<p>proceed at the current pace, we will exceed our existing budget ceiling, without any </p>
<p>new proposals already in the pipeline being taken into account.”</p>

<p><b>261. </b> He continued: </p>
<p>“The need to cut back our budget [for Iraq] in 2004/05 to help meet internal DFID </p>
<p>financial pressures related to the estimating adjustment; plus the MIC ceiling </p>
<p>constraint in 2005/06; plus escalating cost relating to security … have all contributed </p>
<p>to the pressures.”</p>
<p><b>262. </b> DFID would seek to deal with those pressures through “a variety of careful financial </p>
<p>management techniques” and an “active search for co-financing” with partners including </p>
<p>the World Bank and the EC. However:</p>
<p>“… the scope for new activity in 2005/06 is nil and we will have to delay until 2006/07 </p>
<p>some of the proposals in the pipeline with which we hoped to proceed in 2005/06.” </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Dinham also reported that Iraqi governorates did not yet have the capacity to </p>
<p>receive supplementary funding from sources such as the World Bank and the US, as </p>
<p>DFID had hoped. </p>
<p><b>264. </b> Copies of Mr Dinham’s report were sent to Mr Benn’s Private Secretary, </p>
<p>Mr Chakrabarti’s Private Secretary, other DFID officials, and officials in No.10, the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, the FCO, and the MOD. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> Mr Quarrey marked Mr Dinham’s report to Sir Nigel Sheinwald with the comment:</p>
<p>“This is worrying – we need to have some flexibility in 05/06, including to support </p>
<p>ITG ideas/priorities.” </p>
<p>152</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Straw made his first report to Mr Blair on the work of the Ad Hoc Ministerial </p>

<p> He attached a number of reports, included a joint  </p>
<p>FCO/DFID paper describing the state of the electricity sector, which he described as </p>
<p>a focus for the Group’s work. </p>
<p><b>267. </b> The FCO/DFID paper stated that the Iraqi Government was struggling to sustain </p>
<p>production at more than 4,000MW per day and was unlikely to meet its target of </p>
<p>producing 6,000MW per day by the summer. Demand had soared as the economy had </p>
<p>grown, and was now estimated to be 8,000MW per day (that figure would increase over </p>
<p>the summer). Power cuts would continue.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The paper identified four factors behind the failure to increase power production </p>
<p>above May 2003 levels:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued sabotage;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the unreliability and inefficiency of existing power infrastructure;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>poor management by the Iraqi Government; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of “strategic focus” by the CPA in the immediate post-conflict period.</p>
<p><b>269. </b> The paper advised that the Iraqi Government needed to develop a long-term </p>
<p>energy strategy which addressed subsidy and charging issues (power was free). The </p>
<p>World Bank had agreed to advise on strategy and co-ordination “with DFID facilitating”. </p>
<p><b>270. </b> Given limited UK funds, the UK was focusing on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>meeting key short-term needs. The US$10m provided to Gen Riley should </p>
<p>produce 25MW and £10m provided under the SIESP a further 50MW. In the </p>
<p>longer-term, the IISP should produce 160MW by April 2006; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>leveraging engagement from others, and;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing strategic advice to the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> The FCO/IPU concluded that planned work was unlikely to solve Iraq’s power </p>
<p>generation problem in time for the summer. The UK should encourage the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to plan now for next summer and the longer term, through the development </p>
<p>of a coherent strategy for the energy sector. </p>
<p><b>272. </b> In his covering letter to Mr Blair, Mr Straw stated that 55 percent of DFID’s budget </p>
<p>for Iraq for 2005/06 would be spent in the power sector.</p>

<p>156</p>
<p> MND(SE) had initially favoured diesel generators, DFID gas turbines. A “hybrid </p>
<p>proposal” had emerged, involving the purchase of diesel generators for fewer sites than </p>
<p>originally proposed and the refurbishment of existing gas turbines. MND(SE) estimated </p>
<p>that the project – Operation AMPERE – would produce an additional 16.5MW by 1 July. </p>
<p>It would only be a temporary solution. DFID’s IISP would help to maintain existing </p>
<p>capacity, but substantive improvement would only come through long-term restructuring, </p>
<p>institutional reform and major capital investment. That agenda would be pursued with </p>
<p>the ITG. </p>

<p><b>276. </b> Gen Riley reported on 5 April that a fire had completely shut down the main power </p>
<p>station in Nasiriyah, which supplied 50 percent of the electricity to the MND(SE) area.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He commented: </p>
<p>“This simply serves to point up the fragility of the national supply and to illustrate </p>
<p>that DFID and MND(SE) alone are never going to solve the electricity problem </p>
<p>in southern Iraq. While I still believe that DFID’s US$10m will make a small </p>
<p>difference this summer the symbolic nature of the money is as important as the </p>
<p>power it will produce.” </p>

<p>bigger problem in summer 2006. </p>
<p><b>DFID reviews its Interim Country Assistance Plan</b></p>
<p><b>278. </b> DFID had published its Interim Country Assistance Plan for Iraq (I-CAP) in </p>
<p>February 2004, at a time when the UK was a joint Occupying Power in Iraq and security </p>
<p>was improving.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>279. </b> The I-CAP re-stated DFID guidance that progress against a CAP should be </p>
<p>assessed annually, and that a CAP should be subject to a “major review” every three or </p>
<p>four years. The I-CAP stated that, given the rapidly changing situation in Iraq, it would </p>
<p>need a “substantial” review after one year. </p>
<p><b>280. </b> Mr Anderson circulated a note on the programme management issues identified </p>

<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Anderson highlighted the next 12 months as a critical period for DFID’s Iraq </p>
<p>programme and a “key window for donor impact”. US and UK development spending </p>
<p>was set to reduce after 2006 and the UK military presence, upon which donor activities </p>
<p>in the South relied, might draw down. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> Mr Anderson also highlighted two DFID policy papers with implications for DFID’s </p>
<p>programme in Iraq. The first, on fragile states, emphasised the importance of realistic </p>
<p>expectations of host government capacity and of prioritising and sequencing activities </p>
<p>to avoid overwhelming it. The second, on security and development, highlighted the </p>
<p>importance of personal safety and security for the poor, and emphasised that activities </p>
<p>to promote effective security systems were integral to development work. The DFID Iraq </p>
<p>team would meet to consider the implications of the papers in the next few months. </p>
<p><b>283. </b> Mr Anderson detailed the work required to bring DFID’s programme for 2005/06 </p>

<p>242</p>
<p><b>284. </b> A review of DFID’s I-CAP was under way. It was unlikely to result in major changes, </p>
<p>but existing activities would need to be “more focused” on the four UK objectives set out </p>
<p>in the UK paper ‘Iraq: Strategy for 2005’, which had been agreed on 9 February. </p>
<p><b>285. </b> On 6 April, the JIC assessed the state of the insurgency in Iraq following the </p>
<p>January election.</p>
<p>160</p>
<p> It judged that a significant Sunni insurgency would continue through </p>
<p>2005, but that there now appeared to be greater opportunities for reducing it. The ITG’s </p>
<p>early actions would be critical in changing Sunni perceptions and eroding support for </p>
<p>the insurgency. Sunni expectations included the direction of reconstruction money </p>
<p>to Sunni areas. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> Mr Blair met President Bush on 8 April. Mr Blair’s briefing for the meeting </p>
<p>suggested that he might raise four operational points with President Bush, including </p>
<p>power supply.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> It would be very damaging for the ITG if there was no improvement in </p>
<p>electricity supply that summer. The UK was looking to boost supply in the short term in </p>
<p>the South through a DFID/MOD programme; the US needed to do more quick-impact </p>
<p>work across Iraq.</p>

<p>assessed that progress in MND(SE) had been good, with all four provinces likely to </p>
<p>be under Provincial Iraqi Security Control by March 2006, offering “the potential for </p>

<p>“The starting point is that the I-CAP remains valid, but priorities within that </p>
<p>have moved on in the light of the substantially changed situation in Iraq since </p>
<p>last February [when the I-CAP was agreed], the 2005 Strategy and our budget </p>

<p><b>The Iraqi Transitional Government </b></p>
<p>The Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG), led by Prime Minister Dr Ibrahim al-Ja’afari, </p>
<p>formally took power in early May.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> The ITG was mandated to govern Iraq until a </p>
<p>government could be elected according to a new constitution in December 2005.</p>
<p>In his account of the Occupation of Iraq and the transition to democracy, Dr Ali A Allawi, </p>
<p>ITG Minister of Finance and former IIG Minister of Defence, described Iraqi people’s </p>
<p>expectations of the ITG: </p>
<p>“The public expected that the Transitional Government would immediately start to </p>
<p>remedy the services and security situations, and the message [delivered by Prime </p>
<p>Minister al-Ja’afari in the National Assembly] was that conditions would rapidly </p>
<p>improve. A realistic and cold-blooded assessment … would have led to a different </p>
<p>conclusion, one that might have been difficult for politicians to admit to, but which </p>
<p>was nevertheless necessary to make if the expectations of the public were not to be </p>
<p>raised too high.” </p>
<p>166</p>
<p>Dr Allawi wrote that problems with the power supply added to the feeling of “a country </p>
<p>under siege”.</p>
<p>167</p>
<p> Those problems “could not have possibly been resolved in the time-frame </p>
<p>of the Transitional Government” and the fact that the entire sector did not collapse “was </p>
<p>actually a sign of success”. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> DFID officials in London, Baghdad and Basra held a video conference on 17 May </p>
<p>to discuss the I-CAP review.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> The presentation made to the video conference by a </p>
<p>DFID official set out a number of “conclusions”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “de-facto” review had already been completed, in the form of the exchange </p>
<p>between Mr Blair and Mr Benn in October 2004, Mr Chakrabarti’s visit to Iraq in </p>
<p>December 2004, the 2005 UK Strategy, the “smaller than expected” budget for </p>
<p>Iraq, and increased life support costs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The process could have been much better. There should be a better process for </p>
<p>next year’s review. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> The official subsequently reported to Mr Anderson that the video conference had </p>
<p>agreed that the I-CAP review had “essentially been completed”. Work was now in hand </p>
<p>to produce a text for publication, after agreement by Mr Benn. The process had been </p>
<p>driven by events and had not been ideal. The official set out in detail the better review </p>
<p>process that should be undertaken the following year. </p>
<p><b>292. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 19 May. Mr Blair’s brief </p>

<p>Mr Benn attended the meeting. </p>
<p><b>296. </b> Mr Benn’s briefing for the meeting advised that, following his decision in December </p>
<p>2004 on priorities for 2005, DFID’s programme was now “substantially re-orientated </p>
<p>towards bilateral infrastructure support in the South”.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>297. </b> It also advised that in response to a larger-than-expected charge from the FCO for </p>
<p>life support costs and a “smaller-than-expected” budget allocation for Iraq for 2005/06: </p>
<p>“… we have trimmed back some work, notably consultancy, and are planning </p>
<p>25 percent slippage on the £40m infrastructure work [DFID’s Iraq Infrastructure </p>
<p>Services Programme – IISP]. We are also seeking co-financing, with US$20m </p>
<p>agreed in principle with the World Bank …” </p>
<p><b>298. </b> Even after that trimming, planned expenditure for 2005/06 exceeded the budget; </p>
<p>DFID would need to monitor spending very closely. It was, however, reasonable to </p>
<p>“over-programme” given the (unspecified) “uncertainties” and the potential military </p>
<p>drawdown in the second half of 2005/06, which might significantly affect what DFID </p>
<p>could do in the South. </p>
<p><b>299. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that other departments were informed of or </p>
<p>consulted on the decision to slip expenditure on the IISP. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> Mr Blair’s briefing for the meeting, which was produced by the Cabinet Office, </p>
<p>recommended that he focus on three issues: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>combating the insurgency; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the effectiveness of international assistance; and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the pace of reconstruction was still too slow and therefore the “political dividend” </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>power supply was “parlous”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK funding for 2005/06 was almost all committed, requiring “tough Ministerial </p>
<p>decisions” after further work by officials. </p>
<p><b>302. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting invited Ministers to consider: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What impact was US and international funding for reconstruction having on the </p>
<p>ground? Disbursement lagged behind stated international commitments. The </p>
<p>US was focusing on short-term impact. The UN was re-establishing a presence </p>
<p>in Iraq and was starting to “take on the role we would expect of them”. Donor </p>
<p>efforts had lacked focus; better donor co-ordination behind an Iraqi figure was </p>
<p>one of the planned outcomes of the Brussels International Conference in June.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What more the UK could do, to further improve UN, World Bank and </p>
<p>international bilateral reconstruction efforts? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What “concrete outputs” did the UK want from the Brussels International </p>
<p>Conference and the next donor meeting in Amman in July?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the funding available for reconstruction across Government adequate?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the UK investing at a level that supported its objective of creating stability </p>
<p>such that there could be troop withdrawals?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the UK delivering a short-term return which would boost the political </p>
<p>process?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What more the UK could do, to improve power supply over the summer and </p>
<p>boost investment in infrastructure? </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was the UK offering the necessary support to the ITG’s media effort?</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>303. </b> On funding, the Annotated Agenda stated that DFID’s allocation for Iraq was </p>
<p>£65m for 2005/06, but that it had already “programmed” £84.3m (£63m of which would </p>
<p>be spent in southern Iraq). The tri-departmental Global Conflict Prevention Pool (see </p>
<p>Section 12.1) was expected to allocate £25m for Iraq in 2005/06, of which £22m had </p>
<p>already been programmed. The MOD would be bidding to the Treasury for additional </p>
<p>funding for QIPs, having spent £27m on QIPs since 2003. The MOD’s budget for military </p>
<p>activity in Iraq in 2005/06 was £927m. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> In discussion, Ministers commented that the power situation was serious and </p>
<p>would get worse over the summer, but the UK was “doing what it could”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>305. </b> Summarising the outcome of the discussion, Mr Blair asked for more advice on </p>
<p>several issues, including a “short strategy” from DFID on engaging key donors.</p>
<p><b>306. </b> DFID sent its donor engagement strategy to the Cabinet Office on 3 June.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>DFID strategy advised that a significant portion of the US$32bn pledged at the Madrid </p>
<p>Conference in October 2003 remained unspent. Some donors had spread their money </p>
<p>over several years, some had offered soft loans that could only be activated after an </p>
<p>agreement on debt relief, some had been waiting for an elected Iraqi Government, and </p>
<p>many had experienced difficulties in implementing reconstruction projects in Iraq. One </p>
<p>or two donors were “simply back-sliding”. The paper identified 16 countries that the UK </p>
<p>should lobby to secure outstanding pledges. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> DFID advised that the US was committed to disbursing its funds as quickly as </p>
<p>possible. The UK had limited influence over US policy and did not question its “current </p>
<p>thrust”, but should seek to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>join up US and UK work in southern Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage the US to participate in donor co-ordination processes in Baghdad; </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>work with the US to encourage other donors and the multilateral agencies to </p>
<p>contribute more effectively. </p>
<p><b>308. </b> The UK was lobbying Japan to allocate the bulk of its soft loans (up to US$3.5bn) </p>
<p>to the power sector and exploring with Australia, Denmark and Canada the possibility of </p>
<p>co-funding DFID projects in southern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> France and Germany remained the “two missing donors”, although France had </p>
<p>taken a constructive approach on donor co-ordination and the Brussels International </p>
<p>Conference, and Germany was contributing to police training outside Iraq. </p>
<p><b>310. </b> Implementation of reconstruction projects by UN agencies had improved and the </p>
<p>UN was playing a valuable role supporting Iraqi-led donor co-ordination. DFID continued </p>
<p>to press for further improvements to UN Trust Fund operations. </p>
<p><b>311. </b> DFID also continued to press:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the World Bank urgently to establish a presence on the ground in Iraq, and to </p>
<p>find ways of implementing its projects; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the EC to open a permanent office in Baghdad. The EC was already making </p>
<p>use of UK life support</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> and security facilities for its increasingly frequent visits </p>

<p>“Ultimately, without an improvement in security, little progress could be made.”</p>
<p><b>315. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Sir David Manning met Dr Rice and Mr Hadley on the </p>

<p>182</p>
<p> Sir Nigel and Mr Hadley agreed that:</p>
<p>“ … there was scope for a major US/EU/UN initiative on developing the ability of the </p>
<p>international community to build capacity (governance, judiciary etc) in failing states </p>
<p>and post-conflict situations. This was the lesson of the Balkans and Iraq, and we still </p>
<p>did not have the means to deal with this. Some sort of international co-ordination </p>
<p>was necessary.”</p>

<p>Representative) and Ms Benita Ferrero Waldner (EU External Affairs Commissioner). </p>
<p>The British Embassy Baghdad reported that the Troika had brought three main </p>
<p>messages:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support for the political process, and the need for inclusion;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of the Brussels International Conference, as an opportunity for </p>
<p>Iraq to engage with the EU and wider donor community; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a shift in Europe. Europe had been divided over the war but was now united </p>
<p>in its desire to help the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>317. </b> The Embassy reported that, under pressure from Mr Straw, Mr Waldner had told </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>Fraud in the Southern Iraq Employment  </b></p>
<p><b>and Services Programme </b></p>
<p>DFID’s Southern Iraq Employment and Services Programme (SIESP) was approved </p>
<p>in July 2004, providing £10m for infrastructure services and £6m for employment </p>
<p>generation.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> £0.5m was allocated for programme administration. </p>
<p>In May 2005, the DFID Office in Basra closed the employment generation component </p>
<p>of the SIESP after an assessment identified “worrying issues”. The Office asked DFID’s </p>
<p>Internal Audit Department (IAD) to visit Basra to review the SIESP and identify lessons, in </p>
<p>particular for the implementation of DFID’s Iraq Infrastructure Services Programme (IISP). </p>
<p>The IAD identified several flaws in the design of the component. It concluded that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “key driver” of the SIESP had been “political (and consequent senior </p>
<p>management) pressure in Whitehall and beyond to achieve visible results … </p>
<p>In retrospect, these pressures appear unreasonable but at the time were generally </p>
<p>irresistible.” Warnings against proceeding with a programme of “such high </p>
<p>fiduciary risk and intangible benefit” had not been heeded. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been limited advisory input from DFID headquarters. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The initial decision to work through the newly formed (and unelected) Iraqi </p>
<p>Provincial Councils (PCs) had been a misjudgement. They had limited capacity </p>
<p>and there was evidence of widespread corruption in their operation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A later decision to work through local NGOs had not improved performance. Many </p>
<p>NGOs had been set up solely to secure funding from donors. They had limited </p>
<p>capacity, lacked local knowledge, and had proved to be “largely unreliable  </p>
<p>and/or corrupt”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The lack of physical monitoring had undermined implementation. The security </p>
<p>situation meant that there was little chance of DFID staff visiting projects funded </p>
<p>under the SIESP. In Maysan, where the security situation was particularly difficult, </p>
<p>the UK military had managed the employment generation component of the </p>
<p>SIESP directly (bypassing the PC). The military had undertaken some monitoring </p>
<p>as part of routine patrolling, but that had not been “adequate”. The IAD concluded </p>
<p>that the inability to monitor progress indicated that Iraq “was not ready for this type </p>
<p>of development intervention”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Weaknesses in the DFID Office in Basra had contributed to the problems within </p>
<p>the SIESP. The Office had been set up “hastily under pressure from UK and </p>
<p>locally to show a DFID presence”. It had proved very difficult to recruit staff for </p>
<p>Iraq, leading to the appointment of staff with “little or no experience in managing </p>
<p>programmes or staff”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The DFID Office in Basra had established “good controls” over SIESP finances. </p>
<p>The Office’s decision to close the employment generation component immediately </p>
<p>after its initial assessment had saved £3m (the amount remaining in the </p>
<p>employment generation budget). </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Of the £3m that had been spent, the IAD estimated that over £2m had been </p>
<p>spent in a way “that did not meet [the SIESP’s] objectives”. The lack of physical </p>
<p>monitoring made it difficult to be more precise. </p>
<p>The IAD assessed that the incident had soured the relationship between DFID and the </p>
<p>PCs and adversely affected DFID’s reputation and credibility with Iraqi interlocutors, the </p>
<p>UK military, other donors and “bona fide NGOs”.</p>
<p>The IAD report detailed a number of lessons for the IISP.</p>
<p>In May 2006, DFID conducted an internal review in order to determine the extent of the </p>
<p>loss from the SIESP employment component.</p>
<p>185 </p>
<p>The review concluded that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£254,105 had been spent on projects where there was clear evidence of full or </p>
<p>partial misuse of money, based on monitoring by DFID staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£296,187 had been spent on projects where there was “<b>no clear evidence </b></p>
<p><b>of either good use or misuse of money </b>(because there was no monitoring </p>
<p>information on file) but where anecdotal evidence from interviews suggested that </p>
<p>some percentage of the projects were not successfully completed”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£1,021,223 had been spent on projects which DFID was “reasonably confident” </p>
<p>had been successfully completed, based on information on file (in the form of </p>
<p>photographs or visit reports) or anecdotal evidence. </p>
<p>The review stated that even those projects where there was evidence of misuse had </p>
<p>“added economic value to Iraq, though less than was originally intended”. </p>
<p>The review set out the methodology it had used to categorise projects, including that in the </p>
<p>absence of information to the contrary, the existence of monitoring information on a project </p>
<p>was taken as evidence that the project had been successfully completed: </p>
<p>“For the remaining project … we have no monitoring reports in the file. However, there </p>
<p>is a CD [compact disc] in the file which shows a street with sewage and garbage, </p>
<p>and provides a commentary (in Arabic) which explains what work needs to be done. </p>
<p>Because we have no other information, and no reason to believe that funds were not </p>
<p>used according to the purposes intended, we assume that this project was successful.”</p>
<p>Dr Nemat Shafik, DFID Permanent Secretary from March 2008, told the Inquiry how DFID </p>
<p>had reacted to the fraud within the SIESP:</p>
<p>“We have a zero tolerance policy on corruption and we act on it immediately. The </p>
<p>then Provincial Council was very unhappy with us as a result … But on that, we don’t </p>
<p>compromise. </p>
<p>“That [the SIESP] is … the only case that we are aware of, where we had a </p>
<p>significant fraud, which, given the scale of the funds that we were disbursing, and </p>
<p>given the context, is, I think, a pretty good track record.</p>
<p>“In the case of the Iraq portfolio … we actually had a higher level of scrutiny than our </p>
<p>normal portfolio because of the risks involved. So we would get monthly reporting on </p>
<p>risks, security risk, staff risk, risks to our money …” </p>

<p>Both to ensure Iraqi capacity and consent during this process, and to meet Iraq’s </p>
<p>development needs, reconstruction on the ground needs to continue … However, </p>
<p>[the UK’s] resources for Iraq are already overstretched. Ministers will therefore need </p>
<p>either to agree a strict prioritisation of assistance, or consider whether additional </p>
<p>funds should be made available.” </p>
<p><b>319. </b> The Cabinet Office draft paper set out the funding currently available for Iraq </p>
<p>for 2005/06:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID had £65m available and had commitments of £86.6m.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The GCPP had £23.3m available (an accurate figure for commitments was not </p>
<p>yet available). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD forecast “military operational” costs of £927m (a figure for QIPs was </p>
<p>not yet available).</p>
<p><b>320. </b> An Annex to the draft paper advised that DFID would need to manage its </p>
<p>programme very carefully in order to come within the £65m budget. Some (unspecified) </p>
<p>spending could be delayed, and DFID was urgently seeking co-financing for projects </p>
<p>from other donors, including the World Bank. An improvement in the security situation </p>
<p>would help: £28m of the £86.6m was expected to be spent on security and life support.</p>
<p><b>321. </b> Of the £86.6m committed to existing high-priority activities:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£63.8m (74 percent ) was committed to projects in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£14.6m (17 percent) was committed to projects supporting central Government.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£7.2m (8 percent) was committed to projects supporting political participation </p>
<p>(“elections, media, support to civil society groups”). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£1m was committed to multilateral organisations. </p>
<p><b>322. </b> Ms Aldred told the 10 June meeting of the Iraq Senior Officials Group (ISOG) that </p>

<p>188</p>
<p> A Treasury official agreed, and said that any submission to Ministers on </p>

<p>He advised that “the US was well aware of its failings … and there was little we could </p>
<p>tell them that they didn’t already realise and were actively trying to change”. The most </p>
<p>significant impact DFID could have on the US was by working jointly with them in </p>

<p>and what, if any, additional force package should be deployed to support it (see </p>
<p>Section 9.4).</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>326. </b> The Cabinet Office paper, which was presented as an appendix to the main MOD </p>

<p>2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/08.</p>
<p><b>327. </b> On 17 June, a junior DFID official invited Mr Benn to endorse the “annual review” </p>
<p>of DFID’s Interim Country Assistance Plan (I-CAP).</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>328. </b> In his covering minute, the official advised that the I-CAP (which had been </p>
<p>published in February 2004) had been expected to remain in place for two years, and </p>
<p>contained a commitment to undertake a “substantial review” after one year.</p>
<p><b>329. </b> However, events had “pre-empted a pro-active review”. Those events were:</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the agreement in February 2005 of the 2005 UK Iraq Strategy. That Strategy </p>
<p>included “most of the items that we suggested”, and was in line with priorities </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The official also advised that: </p>
<p>“A major constraint to DFID’s programme, not highlighted in the I-CAP review, is the </p>
<p>limited capacity of Iraqi institutions to drive forward reform and reconstruction. This is </p>
<p>exacerbated by the short political horizons inherent in the Transitional Administrative </p>
<p>Law (TAL), which militate against far-reaching reform. Corruption is also becoming </p>
<p>increasingly apparent and might become the main constraint on reconstruction and </p>
<p>development if security were to improve significantly.” </p>
<p><b>331. </b> The I-CAP review comprised short reports on: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>political and economic progress in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>progress on reconstruction. Deteriorating security – identified as a key risk in the </p>
<p>I-CAP – was a major constraint. Projected costs of UK staff working in Iraq for </p>
<p>2005/06 were more than £500,000 per person-year; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the activities of other donors;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>key challenges for reconstruction in 2005/06. Those included the limited  </p>
<p>life-span of the IIG and the ITG, which affected their ability to implement major </p>
<p>reforms; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>examples of the impact of DFID projects in 2004/05. </p>
<p><b>332. </b> The I-CAP review stated that:</p>
<p>“DFID’s work programme has evolved to take account of the difficult security </p>
<p>situation and the absence of some traditional donors. The objectives and approach </p>
<p>set out in our I-CAP remained valid.” </p>
<p><b>333. </b> DFID would: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to promote broader and more effective international support; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue and deepen work at the national level to build Iraqi capacity and </p>
<p>encourage greater Iraqi leadership of reconstruction; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“expand and accelerate” DFID’s programme in the South, where high levels </p>
<p>of poverty persisted. </p>
<p><b>334. </b> There are no indications that other government departments or international </p>
<p>partners contributed to the production of the I-CAP review.</p>
<p><b>335. </b> The I-CAP review submitted to Mr Benn was not the “substantial review” promised </p>
<p>in the I-CAP. In particular, it did not:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide a comprehensive assessment of the political, economic and social </p>
<p>context in Iraq, reflecting the major changes since the I-CAP had been </p>
<p>produced, including the existence of a sovereign Iraqi Government (with its own </p>
<p>priorities and constraints) and the profound impacts of growing insecurity; </p>

<p>and how it would respond to them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consider how the reconstruction effort could and should contribute to broader </p>
<p>UK objectives; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consider whether the level of resources available to achieve DFID’s objectives </p>
<p>in Iraq was right, and whether DFID was working in the most effective way. </p>
<p><b>336. </b> In the absence of that analysis, the I-CAP review could not (and did not) test the </p>
<p>position that DFID had reached.</p>
<p><b>337. </b> Mr Anderson visited Iraq from 13 to 18 June.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p><b>338. </b> In his report to Mr Dinham, copies of which were sent to officials in DFID, the </p>
<p>FCO and the MOD, Mr Anderson identified a number of “strategic issues”, including </p>
<p>the expected decline in the amount of aid going to Iraq. US funding would decline from </p>
<p>US$18.4bn over two years (the current IRFF2 package) to around US$1bn in 2006/07. </p>
<p>Japanese grants were “now exhausted” and DFID’s programme would decline in </p>
<p>2006/07. There might be “modest increases” in UN and World Bank programmes but </p>
<p>“even in the most optimistic scenario, there will be a dramatic decline in aid levels due </p>
<p>to the changing US position”. </p>
<p><b>339. </b> That rapid decline raised three strategic issues:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>What impact would declining aid have on security?</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was this the right time for donors to be reducing aid? Research showed that </p>
<p>aid during or immediately following conflict tended to be wasted. It was most </p>
<p>effective between four and seven years after a conflict. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Was DFID right to treat Iraq as a MIC? The planned decline in DFID’s </p>
<p>programme was based on the “premise” that Iraq had adequate resources to </p>
<p>fund its own development. But did that hold true when security was poor and </p>
<p>oil revenues difficult to obtain? </p>
<p><b>340. </b> DFID has not been able to provide the Inquiry with any response from Mr Dinham, </p>
<p>or any record of a discussion of aid volumes.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>342. </b> The paper stated that there was a “clear UK military aspiration” to transfer security </p>

<p><b>The International Conference on Iraq, 22 June 2005 </b></p>
<p>Planning began in early 2005 for an International Conference on Iraq, to be co-hosted </p>

<p>Mr Straw advised Mr Blair on 24 March that the UK was working closely with the US to </p>

<p>195</p>
<p> Key objectives included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring an inclusive process to build a wide base of international support for the </p>
<p>Iraqi political process; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a reformed approach to donor co-ordination. </p>
<p>US and UK officials discussed the Conference on 31 March.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> The US saw the ITG </p>
<p>being in the lead, and using the Conference to set out their “broad direction” and secure </p>
<p>international support for it. Mr Crompton said that the UK agreed with that approach, and </p>
<p>suggested that “deliverables” from the Conference should include:</p>

<p>agreement on an improved mechanism for international assistance; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>346. </b> Mr Blair met Prime Minister Ja’afari on 27 June.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>347. </b> Mr Quarrey’s briefing for Mr Blair suggested that the main points to cover included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The International Conference. The UK judged that the Conference had been </p>
<p>a success, even if concrete outcomes had been thin.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction. The UK was constantly pressing for the better use of </p>
<p>reconstruction funds “so that we get a political dividend”. The UK should </p>
<p>encourage Prime Minister Ja’afari to take a similarly close interest. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Mr Quarrey’s record of the meeting indicates that the discussion focused on </p>
<p>security and the constitutional process, and that reconstruction was not raised.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>349. </b> On 5 July, the British Embassy Baghdad provided an assessment on progress </p>
<p>on donor co-ordination.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> Some progress had been made before and during the </p>
<p>International Conference, but a gap was emerging between Iraqi expectations (more </p>
<p>money) and what was needed (better Iraqi strategy and clearer priorities). The ITG </p>
<p>had advised donors to “do anything, because everything is a priority”. </p>

<p>201</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that the US and UK objective must be to divide Sunni </p>
<p>insurgents from foreign jihadists. </p>
<p><b>351. </b> At its meeting on 13 July, the JIC reviewed the effectiveness of efforts to bring </p>
<p>Sunni Arabs into the political process.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> It judged that: </p>
<p>“Winning over Iraq’s Sunni Arab population is key to reducing the insurgency </p>
<p>over time …”</p>
<p><b>352. </b> Sunni political and insurgent groups did not have a unified strategy. There was a </p>
<p>range of Sunni political objectives: demand for a timetable for MNF withdrawal and the </p>
<p>release of detainees featured strongly. The JIC continued:</p>
<p>“Sunnis also want to ensure they benefit economically from Iraq’s natural resources </p>
<p>(held in predominately Shia and Kurd areas), gain access to jobs and markets, and </p>
<p>see greater evidence of reconstruction – so far efforts to rebuild Sunni areas have </p>
<p>been disproportionally hampered by the security situation.”</p>

<p>256</p>
<p><b>353. </b> Mr Straw sent an Iraq Oil and Gas Strategy to Mr Blair on 12 July.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> The strategy, </p>
<p>which had been developed by FCO, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and DFID </p>
<p>officials over the previous month, defined three UK objectives: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“The development of an efficient, outward-looking and transparent oil and </p>
<p>gas industry, capable of delivering sustainable export revenues to meet the </p>
<p>development needs of the people of Iraq and meeting domestic needs for </p>
<p>energy in an efficient, equitable and secure manner.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increasing involvement of the private sector, leading to sustained investment </p>
<p>over the next five to 10 years and substantial business for UK companies … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To promote Iraq’s role in international oil and gas markets and as a constructive </p>
<p>influence within OPEC.”</p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Quarrey marked the strategy to Sir Nigel Sheinwald with the comment: “I do not </p>
<p>intend to put in the box! Looks OK.” </p>

<p>207</p>
<p> The IIG had launched an earlier national strategy in Tokyo in 2004. </p>
<p><b>358. </b> In his introductory remarks, Mr Salih said that the high level of unemployment in </p>
<p>Iraq was fuelling economic despair and insecurity. The reconstruction effort had focused </p>
<p>on large-scale, capital-intensive infrastructure projects. Those “mega-projects”, though </p>
<p>appropriate and essential, had not succeeded in providing Iraq’s basic needs quickly </p>
<p>enough. The answer was to complement them with “community-level” projects that </p>
<p>demonstrably changed people’s lives for the better. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> Mr Salih highlighted the shortfall in funding for electricity supply. The October </p>
<p>2003 World Bank/UN Joint Needs Assessment had estimated that US$20bn would be </p>
<p>required to restore power to 1990 levels. Less than half that amount had been allocated. </p>

<p>258</p>
<p><b>367. </b> The section on “handling” in the previous draft had been expanded to include </p>
<p>“NGOs”: </p>
<p>“The announcement [of] any drawdown of UK forces in the South will have to </p>
<p>be carefully managed to ensure that there is no loss of confidence by NGOs </p>
<p>(in particular the UN agencies and the World Bank), which might lead them to </p>
<p>postpone plans for greater engagement in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>368. </b> The section on resources had also been expanded:</p>
<p>“Other Government Departments operating in Iraq may … face increased security </p>
<p>costs as they are forced to seek commercial alternatives to military force protection.” </p>
<p><b>369. </b> DOP(I) agreed Dr Reid’s recommendation that, subject to the continuation of </p>
<p>current trends in the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and to there being no major </p>
<p>deterioration in the security situation, the UK should plan to implement transition to Iraqi </p>
<p>control in Maysan and Muthanna from around October 2005, and in Dhi Qar and Basra </p>
<p>from around March 2006.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>370. </b> DOP(I) commented that too much of the money allocated for reconstruction had </p>
<p>been spent on foreign contractors and security.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p> The UK should now be focusing on </p>
<p>delivering through Iraqi structures. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> DOP(I) also considered an FCO paper entitled ‘Splitting the Jihadists from the </p>
<p>National Opposition’.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> The FCO recommended action on eight “lines”, the last of which </p>
<p>was reconstruction:</p>
<p>“<b>Rapid implementation</b> of reconstruction projects, specifically following large scale </p>
<p>anti-insurgency operations or local cease-fires:</p>
<p>“Aims: Demonstrate ITG/MNF ability to rebuild and compensate following </p>
<p>operations/cease-fires. Quick support to Iraqi capacity to deliver. Installation of basic </p>
<p>services. Establishment of political and security structures. Employment creation. </p>
<p>Deny opportunity to insurgency to work up dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>“Means: … Key donors and ITG to review how to reprogramme/redefine donor </p>
<p>assistance to make available rapidly disbursable aid (eg. creation of a special fund </p>
<p>for quick impact projects in politically sensitive areas), including from the private </p>
<p>sector. Media (foreign and Iraq) coverage of successful redevelopment projects.”</p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>259</p>
<p><b>Responding to the new US Clear-Hold-Build strategy</b></p>
<p><b>373. </b> Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad succeeded Ambassador John Negroponte as the </p>
<p>US Ambassador to Iraq in June 2005.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p><b>374. </b> To assess the situation and propose a way forward, Ambassador Khalilzad </p>
<p>established a Joint Civil-Military Strategic Planning Group, generally known as the Red </p>
<p>Cell or Red Team. The Red Team was tasked to devise a plan that would break the back </p>
<p>of the insurgency within one year and defeat it within three. </p>
<p><b>375. </b> Before Ambassador Khalilzad’s his arrival in Iraq, the DoD and the State </p>
<p>Department had initiated independent reviews of reconstruction strategy (led by General </p>
<p>Gary Luck and Ambassador Richard Jones respectively). Those reviews informed the </p>
<p>new approach developed by Ambassador Khalilzad. </p>
<p><b>376. </b> A key issue was the amount of US funding that remained available. After a slow </p>
<p>start, the US reconstruction effort was “in high gear”. Of the US$18.4bn appropriated for </p>
<p>IRRF2, three-quarters had been obligated and one-third disbursed. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Ambassador Khalilzad met Mr Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed </p>
<p>Forces, on 20 July.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> The Ambassador raised the subject of Provincial Reconstruction </p>
<p>Teams (PRTs), some of which had worked well in Afghanistan, and asked whether there </p>
<p>was a role for them in Iraq. Mr Ingram wondered whether PRTs would, in many parts of </p>
<p>Iraq, be too exposed. He also commented that “one of the problems of even considering </p>
<p>such fresh approaches … was the risk that they could be leaked”. </p>
<p><b>378. </b> Ambassador Khalilzad offered to share US thinking on PRTs with the UK, </p>
<p>including on whether projects should be driven by “operational security” or longer-term </p>
<p>development goals. </p>
<p><b>379. </b> Mr William Patey, Mr Chaplin’s successor as British Ambassador to Iraq, reported </p>
<p>on 27 July that the availability of electricity and fuel was barely different from a year </p>
<p>earlier.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p> Progress was being made, but it would be “a long haul” and managing Iraqi </p>
<p>expectations would be key. He commented: </p>
<p>“Ordinary Iraqis are becoming increasingly frustrated that, over two years after </p>
<p>Saddam’s fall, there has been little discernible improvement to essential services …</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the Iraqis need to plan much longer term … There needs to be an </p>
<p>integrated energy strategy … The current focus – including from US advisers – is </p>
<p>short-term. DFID is funding two advisers to help the Ministry of Electricity (and </p>
<p>Ministry of Oil) develop a coherent longer-term strategy, including creating the legal </p>

<p>this as the only means of creating a sustainable electricity network in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Quarrey passed the report to Mr Blair, with the comment:</p>
<p>“The conclusion that the only solution is a long-term plan is consistent with </p>
<p>DFID’s approach but fails to address the damage done in the meantime to the </p>
<p>political process.” </p>
<p>221</p>
<p><b>381. </b> Lieutenant General Robin Brims, the Senior British Military Representative, Iraq, </p>
<p>reported to Gen Walker on 31 July that “the US with ourselves” were establishing a </p>
<p>“Red Cell” to examine critically counter-insurgency strategy.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Mr Anderson advised Mr Benn’s Private Secretary on 12 August that, despite </p>
<p>intensive efforts by DFID and MND(SE), Op AMPERE (the US$10m point power </p>
<p>generation project developed by MND(SE) and DFID and approved in March 2005) had </p>
<p>not met its objective of providing additional power during the summer months.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>failure had been due primarily to inexperienced suppliers, poor security and a lack of </p>
<p>access. Six of the planned 10 generators had now been commissioned; work continued </p>
<p>to commission the remaining four.</p>
<p><b>383. </b> The Red Team reported on 31 August.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> Section 9.4 describes the report and the </p>
<p>UK’s response in detail. </p>
<p><b>384. </b> The Red Team assessed that the coalition’s current strategy – based on </p>
<p>transitioning security responsibilities to the Iraqi Government – would enable coalition </p>
<p>forces to disengage from Iraq but would leave Iraqi Security Forces that would not be </p>
<p>able to defeat the insurgency in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p><b>385. </b> The Red Team proposed an alternative strategy, based on what it described </p>
<p>as the “classic ‘ink spot’ counter-insurgency model”, which sought to create success </p>
<p>in small areas and then steadily expand outwards until the areas flowed together </p>
<p>to form larger regions of security.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> Military operations were to be more closely </p>
<p>co-ordinated with “political-economic actions” tailored to the specific needs of local </p>
<p>communities. Action was also needed at the national level, to set the conditions for </p>
<p>the counter-insurgency campaign. </p>
<p><b>386. </b> The report proposed that a Joint Inter-Agency Counter-Insurgency Task Force </p>
<p>should be established to plan, co-ordinate and implement governance reform and </p>
<p>economic sector development work in support of the counter-insurgency campaign.</p>

<p>261</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s advice to Mr Blair on the Red Team report focused on </p>
<p>political and security aspects of the proposed strategy.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> On the economic aspect of </p>
<p>the proposed strategy, he commented:</p>
<p>“There is nothing new to say here. There will be no serious reconstruction effort for </p>
<p>as long as the security situation remains bad, and political engagement at national </p>
<p>and local levels remains poor … </p>
<p>“There is little point in talking about a new surge of economic reconstruction until </p>
<p>we see the shape of the next Iraqi Government.”</p>
<p><b>388. <i></b> Hard Lessons</i> identified the Red Team report as one important element of the US </p>
<p>strategy review and development process initiated by Ambassador Khalilzad which, by </p>
<p>the autumn of 2005, had produced a new approach comprising: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A renewed focus on broadening Sunni participation in the political process.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Defeating the insurgency using the “ink-spot” model (articulated by the Red </p>
<p>Team and others). That required closer integration of military and civilian </p>
<p>resources and the use of civilian reconstruction resources as part of a </p>
<p>military-led campaign, and a shift away from large infrastructure projects towards </p>
<p>smaller, Iraqi-led projects designed to deliver jobs and services to the most </p>
<p>vulnerable, violent and politically significant neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increased support for provincial governments, including through the deployment </p>
<p>of PRTs into provinces. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increased support for central government institutions, including by embedding </p>
<p>civilian advisers. The increased support for provincial and central government </p>
<p>reflected US analysis that their strategy of “pulling back to let the Iraqis </p>
<p>do it themselves” had failed; provincial governments remained weak and </p>
<p>disconnected from central government.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p><b>389. </b> The new strategy would become known as “Clear-Hold-Build”. </p>
<p><b>390. </b> On 19 September, two UK soldiers were arrested by the Iraqi Police Service in </p>
<p>Basra, following an incident in which they killed one Iraqi police officer and wounded </p>
<p>another (see Section 9.4). The soldiers, and six negotiators who had attempted to </p>
<p>secure their release and who had also been detained, were subsequently released </p>
<p>in an armed operation undertaken by MND(SE). The episode became known as the </p>
<p>Jameat incident.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>262</p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr James Tansley, the British Consul General in Basra from September 2005 to </p>
<p>April 2006, told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“The Jameat incident effectively destroyed working relationships between ourselves </p>
<p>and Basra Council and the governorate. Although we patched things up, there was </p>
<p>still an underlying suspicion, and it was difficult to build … particularly constructive </p>
<p>relations with the officialdom or the government in Basra province throughout </p>
<p>my time.” </p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>392. </b> Mr Tansley commented that the combination of deteriorating security and, </p>
<p>following the Jameat incident, political constraints limited the progress that the UK could </p>
<p>make on reconstruction, SSR and preparing for the transfer of provincial control to the </p>
<p>Iraqi authorities. </p>
<p><b>393. </b> Against a background of increasing insecurity, DFID continued to press the World </p>
<p>Bank to accelerate disbursement from its Trust Fund and to establish a presence in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>394. </b> Dr Shafik met Mr Chrik Poortman, World Bank Vice-President for the Middle East, </p>
<p>on 20 September.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> Mr Poortman argued that the rate of disbursement from the Bank’s </p>
<p>Trust Fund was comparable with other post-conflict countries and expressed concern </p>
<p>that faster disbursement could increase the risk of corruption. He also regretted the UK’s </p>
<p>“continual public criticism” of the rate of disbursement, which was damaging the Bank’s </p>
<p>ability to attract donor support. </p>
<p><b>395. </b> The report of the meeting was copied to DFID and Treasury officials. Mr Anderson </p>
<p>commented: </p>
<p>“Chrik’s arguments about disbursement rates are technically correct … </p>
<p>“That the Bank’s disbursement in Iraq is comparable to other … countries is beside </p>
<p>the point – aid to Iraq is not business as usual. That Iraq requires a different </p>
<p>approach … is the core point that Chrik does not accept.” </p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>396. </b> Mr Chakrabarti met Mr Poortman a few days later.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>397. </b> Mr Chakrabarti’s briefing for the meeting stated that the Bank’s presence in Iraq </p>
<p>comprised one international consultant (now funded by the Bank, formerly by DFID) </p>
<p>and seven local staff. Of the US$400m committed to the World Bank Trust Fund, only </p>
<p>US$31m had been disbursed by July. DFID still saw the Trust Fund “as an emergency </p>
<p>fund to be disbursed quickly”.</p>

<p><b>398. </b> The briefing also stated that the World Bank had agreed to channel US$21m from </p>
<p>its Trust Fund to a power project in Najibiyah, through DFID’s IISP. The Najibiyah project </p>
<p>had, however, floundered in the absence of Iraqi Government support; DFID was </p>
<p>exploring “all possible alternative options” for the funding. </p>
<p><b>399. </b> On 30 September, Mr Dinham sent Sir Nigel Sheinwald a paper providing an </p>
<p>“honest assessment” of progress on reconstruction, following a discussion between </p>
<p>Mr Dinham and Sir Nigel earlier that month.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>400. </b> The DFID paper listed the achievements that had been made in re-establishing </p>
<p>the economy, electricity generation, water and sanitation, employment, education, </p>
<p>health, and transport and communications. DFID also listed factors which had hindered </p>
<p>reconstruction:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>insecurity, which meant that few other donors had a presence on the ground </p>
<p>in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>poor co-ordination and little buy-in from the Iraqi Government and local </p>
<p>authorities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>limited capacity of Iraqi institutions and rapid turnover of political figures;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“large additional funds … are unlikely to accelerate progress on reconstruction </p>
<p>without corresponding policy and institutional reform and capacity building”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>security costs had “eaten into” reconstruction funds;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US had been “distracted by hotspot cities” at the expense of a “strategic </p>
<p>reconstruction programme”. Significant amounts of US funding had been </p>
<p>re-allocated from basic services to tackle security and oil;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>problems with the sustainability of large-scale projects; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>unrealistic Iraqi and international expectations. In other countries, DFID allowed </p>
<p>between five and 15 years for “the first phase of governance projects”, to allow </p>
<p>time for institutional culture to change. In Iraq, international partners were trying </p>
<p>to reform institutions in less than two years.</p>
<p><b>401. </b> DFID concluded:</p>
<p>“A carefully balanced approach is needed: on the one hand, an acceptance of the </p>
<p>realistic pace of reconstruction will help to manage expectations and encourage </p>
<p>more sustainable, long-term projects; on the other hand, some continuation of </p>
<p>high-profile, short-term activity will be needed to provide signs of visible progress </p>
<p>while longer-term activity is under way.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>264</p>
<p><b>402. </b> Mr Quarrey passed the DFID paper to Sir Nigel with the comment:</p>
<p>“This has more detail than we’ve seen for a while, and in some areas looks </p>
<p>reasonably encouraging. But overall the picture is still pretty bleak. What the paper </p>
<p>does not give is (a) much sense of what is happening now (eg what’s getting better </p>
<p>or worse); and (b) whether there is much we can do about it. I think we have other, </p>
<p>more immediate priorities for No.10 effort in the short term. Do you want to do </p>
<p>anything with this?” </p>
<p>233</p>
<p><b>403. </b> Sir Nigel was more critical:</p>
<p>“I take a less positive view. I see it as a lot of useless, mostly input, statistics. But </p>
<p>there’s little on outputs, no comparison of pre-invasion and now, no case studies, </p>
<p>no sense of Najaf then and now. ie not what I asked for.” </p>
<p>234</p>
<p><b>404. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indication that the paper was passed to Mr Blair, or that </p>
<p>No.10 or Sir Nigel responded to DFID. </p>
<p><b>405. </b> Also on 30 September, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary sent Mr Quarrey a </p>
<p>paper containing the joint advice of FCO, MOD and DFID officials on the implications </p>
<p>of the Jameat incident.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p> Mr Straw had not yet seen and agreed their advice.  </p>
<p>The FCO/MOD/DFID paper advised:</p>
<p>“The … incident … highlights what was previously more opaque, that we face acute </p>
<p>challenges in achieving our objectives in the south-east region. Stability in the </p>
<p>south-east is being threatened by intense rivalry among political parties and their </p>
<p>militias. Criminality, jockeying for patronage and leaders’ differing political visions </p>
<p>are being exacerbated by tribalism and increasing religiosity.” </p>
<p><b>406. </b> The paper concluded that “alternative options to our current policy are limited”: </p>
<p>“<b>Our only realistic option is to maintain our course and see the job through. </b></p>
<p>But<b> we need to make adjustments to our policy</b>, while sticking to our strategic </p>
<p>approach of ensuring in due course successful transition of responsibility for rule </p>
<p>of law in the south-east to the Iraqis.” </p>
<p><b>407. </b> An immediate problem was the threat of reprisal attacks. DFID and FCO staff were </p>
<p>“essentially locked down”. </p>

<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>“We may not be able to deliver, by next year, the minimum standards </b></p>

<p>“I don’t think the Red Team report is advocating a different strategy; just a means of </p>
<p>implementing the existing one … </p>
<p>“The ‘ink spot’ strategy is right. It isn’t what we have done so far. What we’ve done is </p>
<p>take a city, give it back to the Iraqis and hope. The ‘ink spot’ strategy is to take it and </p>
<p>then only when the Iraqi civilian capability of governance is properly established with </p>
<p>the necessary military back-up, do we withdraw.” </p>

<p><b>413. </b> Sir Nigel went on to set out in detail Mr Blair’s views in relation to policy on the </p>
<p>political process and security. The single paragraph on reconstruction read: </p>
<p>“It is unlikely that we will be able to enhance significantly the impact of reconstruction </p>
<p>activities in the period before elections. But he [Mr Blair] would be grateful if </p>
<p>Hilary Benn could work hard with the World Bank and UN in particular – their future </p>

<p>US agencies involved.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>414. </b> Sir Nigel reported that Mr Blair planned to chair a meeting of DOP(I) every fortnight </p>
<p>if possible. Sir Nigel would chair weekly meetings of senior officials. Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Dr Reid were also to chair regular Ministerial meetings in their areas. </p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Chakrabarti and Mr Dinham visited Iraq from 4 to 6 October to review DFID’s </p>
<p>programme and consider future plans in the light of the forthcoming Iraqi elections and </p>
<p>UK military transition planning.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>416. </b> Their report to Mr Benn, copies of which were sent to Sir Nigel Sheinwald, </p>
<p>senior officials in the Cabinet Office, MOD, FCO and the Treasury, and UK military </p>
<p>commanders and officials in Iraq, recommended that DFID should shift its focus from </p>
<p>the South and infrastructure projects to building institutional capacity in Baghdad. That </p>
<p>recommendation reflected “remarkable unanimity of advice from a range of interlocutors, </p>
<p>including our political and military colleagues in both Baghdad and Basra” on where </p>
<p>DFID’s comparative advantage lay in a “uniquely difficult environment”. </p>
<p><b>417. </b> Mr Chakrabarti and Mr Dinham reported that UN staff were back in Iraq and </p>
<p>playing a key role in donor co-ordination. The EC was “visible, albeit with a small and </p>
<p>focused presence”. A key gap remained the absence of a permanent World Bank or IMF </p>
<p>representative. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> The Iraqi Government remained unenthusiastic on the Najibiyah power plant </p>
<p>project (for which DFID had hoped to secure US$21m in funding from the World Bank </p>
<p>Trust Fund); there was no value in pressing this further. </p>
<p><b>419. </b> On funding, the US was now looking for other donors to “pick up the tab” for </p>
<p>reconstruction; none had yet stepped forward: </p>
<p>“A[n] … immediate worry for the first year of an incoming Government is the </p>
<p>likelihood of a funding crisis as US money thins out and the multilaterals are not </p>
<p>yet on stream.”</p>
<p><b>420. </b> If DFID was to focus on building institutional capacity in Baghdad, it would need </p>
<p>to consider whether its current model – using international consultants, with their </p>
<p>attendant high security costs – remained “fit for purpose”. The Iraqi Government was </p>

<p>starting to turn down offers of assistance, primarily on cost grounds. Mr Chakrabarti and </p>
<p>Mr Dinham reported that their initial feeling was that alternative models now needed to </p>
<p>be explored, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a greater use of consultants drawn from the Iraqi diaspora;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the use of current or former senior UK civil servants on short visits; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployment of additional DFID advisers to Baghdad and Basra.</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Chakrabarti and Mr Dinham concluded that DFID should produce a new </p>
<p>Country Assistance Plan (CAP) for Iraq, setting out its intentions.</p>
<p><b>422. </b> DFID told the Inquiry that it could not find any evidence of a response from </p>
<p>Mr Benn or of any documents relating to a consequent discussion of aid modalities, </p>
<p>and that work to produce a new CAP was not taken forward.</p>

<p><b>423. </b> On 10 October, the Joint Committee to Transfer Security Responsibility (JCTSR) </p>
<p>produced its “Conditions for Provincial Transfer”, which set the framework for MNF-I </p>
<p>to transfer security responsibility to an Iraqi civilian authority (see Section 9.4).</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The document set out a series of standards in four areas: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the insurgency threat, </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISF capability, </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>242</p>
<p> His report to Gen Walker, copies of which were sent to senior military </p>

<p>critical need to build the capacity of the Iraqi Government. The UK would be expected </p>
<p>to share “the PRT burden” in the South. </p>
<p><b>425. </b> Gen Jackson agreed with the Red Team’s argument that the insurgency would only </p>
<p>be defeated by a co-ordinated effort across all lines of operation, but cautioned that the </p>
<p>“ink spot” concept sounded similar to the “seven cities” and “Strategic Cities” initiatives </p>
<p>which had floundered in 2004:</p>
<p>“I am increasingly hearing the same strategic principles (undoubtedly sound </p>
<p>ones) being dressed up in different initiatives, but without ever being implemented </p>
<p>effectively on the ground. I suspect there are several reasons for this: certainly </p>
<p>a lack of resources for non-military LOO [lines of operation], but also, perhaps, </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>15 PRTs and one Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT), to cover the provinces </p>
<p>under the Kurdish Regional Government.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>429. </b> MND(SE) and DFID had fed in concerns over the introduction of PRTs, centred on </p>
<p>the lack of consultation with the Iraqi Government, coalition members and the UN. </p>
<p><b>430. </b> The first three PRTs would be established on 1 November. The US expected all the </p>
<p>PRTs and the RRT to be established by March/April 2006. </p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Patey advised that the US expected coalition partners to bear the running costs </p>
<p>of PRTs in their areas. Those costs would be significant.</p>
<p><b>432. </b> Dr Rice told the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 19 October that the </p>
<p>US strategy to “assure victory” in Iraq, working with the Iraqi Government, was to “clear, </p>

<p> She described the US strategy:</p>
<p>“With our Iraqi allies, we are working to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Clear the toughest places – no sanctuaries to the enemy – and disrupt </p>
<p>foreign support for the insurgents. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Hold and steadily enlarge the secure areas, integrating political and </p>
<p>economic outreach with our military operations. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Build truly national institutions working with more capable provincial and </p>
<p>local authorities. Embodying a national compact – not tools of a particular </p>
<p>sect or ethnic group – these Iraqi institutions must sustain security forces, </p>
<p>bring rule of law, visibly deliver essential services, and offer the Iraqi people </p>

<p><b>433. </b> The strategy required deeper integration of civilian and military activities, including </p>
<p>by restructuring part of the US Mission in Iraq as PRTs:</p>
<p>“These will be civil-military teams … training police, setting up courts, and helping </p>
<p>local governments with essential services like sewerage treatment or irrigation. </p>
<p>The first of these PRTs will take the field next month.”</p>
<p><b>434. <i></b> Hard Lessons </i>described the difficulties the US experienced in establishing PRTs: </p>
<p>“Coaxing the Departments of State and Defense to set the terms of their first </p>
<p>major operational collaboration in Iraq required a Herculean effort … A patchwork </p>
<p>quilt of memoranda of agreement, cables, and military orders – many of them at </p>
<p>cross-purposes – evolved to codify policy for PRTs. More than a year elapsed </p>
<p>before basic issues of budgets, the provision of security, and command and control </p>
<p>relationships were resolved, delaying full deployment of the PRTs and limiting their </p>
<p>early effectiveness in the field.” </p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>435. </b> The 3 November meeting of DOP(I) considered an IPU discussion paper on how </p>
<p>PRTs could be configured to “add value to current arrangements”.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p><b>436. </b> The IPU paper set out lessons from Afghanistan, and concluded that there was no </p>
<p>“fixed template” for a PRT. PRTs were most effective when:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they contained an appropriately resourced, integrated military and civilian team;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they had the support of local authorities, a close working relationship with </p>
<p>international organisations and NGOs, and sought to extend the reach of central </p>
<p>authorities; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>they operated in relatively benign security environments where they could seek </p>
<p>to contain rather than confront conflict. </p>
<p><b>437. </b> The IPU identified three major risks to the implementation of the US proposal: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of Iraqi “buy-in” at local and national level; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a perception among “local Iraqis” that PRTs represented a failure to deliver a </p>
<p>transfer of control to Iraqis; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a lack of resources. The success of the PRTs would be commensurate, to </p>
<p>some degree, with the financial resources available to them. The US planned </p>
<p>to fund the three pilot PRTs from within existing resources. The UK would </p>
<p>need to consider whether further PRTs could be established on that basis: </p>

<p><b>438. </b> DFID briefing for Mr Benn for the DOP(I) meeting stated:</p>
<p>“We and MOD are both concerned about the risks of this approach. It is expensive, </p>
<p>will divert funding from other priorities, and we do not believe it will make a dramatic </p>
<p>difference in outcomes. It may slow military transition … The agreed Whitehall </p>
<p>approach is that we will be constructive; find out more and try and influence the US </p>
<p>approach; and that we will repackage our effort in the South as a PRT but not do </p>
<p>very much differently.” </p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>439. </b> At DOP(I), Ministers commented that PRTs should be tailored to their environment, </p>
<p>and that Iraqi ownership and the involvement of international donors were essential.</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>440. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 8 November that the US Embassy </p>
<p>was happy to allow the UK time to develop its own ideas for PRTs in the South, and </p>
<p>to be fully engaged in planning.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> The strong preference of the US, however, was for </p>
<p>individual PRTs to be established in each of the four southern provinces (in line with the </p>
<p>US approach in the rest of Iraq). The Embassy had argued that the UK would need to </p>
<p>take account of existing governance arrangements in the South, and the effect of PRTs </p>
<p>on the transfer of security responsibility. </p>
<p><b>441. </b> An MOD briefing for Gen Walker described that effect:</p>
<p>“The [US] proposal sees the establishment of a … PRT in every Province for at least </p>
<p>two years. This would almost certainly undermine MND(SE) transition plans, with </p>
<p>a significant risk that UK forces would be fixed in Maysan and Muthanna into the </p>

<p><b>444. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad provided further advice on US views on </p>
<p>22 November.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> US Ambassador Dan Speckhard (Head of the IRMO) had told them that </p>
<p>Ambassador Khalilzad had no intention of running Iraq, but would not allow the mission </p>
<p>to fail because the Iraqi Government could not swiftly establish effective institutions at </p>
<p>national or local level. The UK should see PRTs as providing a “one-off structural shot </p>
<p>in the arm” to establish those institutions while international military forces remained to </p>
<p>support civilian activities. </p>
<p><b>445. </b> Ambassador Speckhard had said that the US remained content for the UK to offer </p>
<p>a way forward in the South, but there were “clear red lines”: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Civilian and military operations must be integrated. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“[T]here must be a ‘genuine’ PRT in each province – satellite PRTs served by </p>
<p>resources located in another Governorate would not be an adequate option for </p>
<p>substantive not just political reasons.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>PRTs must be a “new venture”, supported by additional resources. “Rebadging” </p>
<p>existing efforts under a PRT banner would not be well received. </p>
<p><b>446. </b> The Embassy commented that it should be possible to present a proposal for four </p>
<p>PRTs transitioning to two as consistent with US objectives. </p>
<p><b>447. </b> Following a visit to Iraq from 22 to 23 November, Gen Walker advised Dr Reid: </p>
<p>“The jury is out on the pilot PRTs – both amongst the military and the diplomats. </p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, I recommend an early bid to run them in the four </p>
<p>MND(SE) provinces to save us heartache later. If we don’t, they have the potential </p>
<p>to fix us through force protection requirements at places and for periods not </p>
<p>of our choosing.” </p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>448. </b> The DOP(I) meeting on 1 December considered an IPU paper on how the UK </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>449. </b> Mr Benn’s briefing for the meeting stated that, while the US wanted to see PRTs in </p>
<p>all of Iraq’s Provinces, financial constraints made it unlikely it would be able to establish </p>
<p>its own PRTs in the South.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>450. </b> The IPU paper identified three options for the UK:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support four PRTs in the four southern provinces until 2008 (the US envisaged </p>
<p>that PRTs would operate for two years with international staff, and then for a </p>
<p>further two years with Iraqi staff only). That would “match” the US initiative, but </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>would mean extending the UK military presence in the South beyond current </p>
<p>planned dates for transition (PRTs would require appropriate force protection </p>
<p>and Quick Response Forces), and require significant additional resources for </p>
<p>programmes and security.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establish one PRT in Basra to cover all of MND(SE). That would not affect UK </p>
<p>plans for transition in the other three southern provinces. The US might want to </p>
<p>establish its own PRTs in those provinces, increasing Iraqi resentment of the US </p>
<p>presence and raising presentational difficulties in the UK if the US was seen to </p>
<p>take over from the UK in the UK’s area.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Transition from “(mini) PRTs” in four provinces towards a single “super-PRT” in </p>
<p>Basra. That would ensure coverage across MND(SE) but would not affect UK </p>
<p>plans for transition.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>451. </b> The IPU assessed that while none of the options was “satisfactory”, the third option </p>
<p>was best. It would permit continued governance and capacity-building work in all four </p>
<p>provinces, would not affect UK military transition planning, and would minimise security </p>
<p>risks to civilian staff. </p>
<p><b>452. </b> The IPU recommended that DOP(I):</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Agree that the UK establish a PRT structure in southern Iraq, with Iraqi buy-in.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Agree that the focus of the PRT should be on improving co-ordination and </p>
<p>delivery of UK assistance, strengthening the links between the central authorities </p>
<p>and Governorates, and improving the UK’s “strategic oversight” of southern Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Accept that while there were “presentational advantages” in establishing a PRT </p>
<p>in MND(SE), improvements in the effectiveness of the UK’s engagement would </p>
<p>be “marginal”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Note that while the PRT models might encourage other coalition partners to </p>
<p>engage in reconstruction in the South (early indications were that Germany and </p>
<p>Japan might supply experts or funding), multilateral donors were known to be </p>
<p>sceptical about the PRT model and were unlikely to engage fully. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Adapt the US PRT model to suit local circumstances in the four southern </p>
<p>provinces:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>In Basra, the current effort should be “re-organised along PRT lines”, </p>
<p>with the addition of a UK senior civil servant as its head. This regional </p>
<p>“super-PRT” would comprise around 30 civilian staff, 21 military officers, </p>
<p>and between 20 and 30 locally engaged staff. </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>In Dhi Qar, the current effort should also be “re-organised along PRT lines”, </p>
<p>possibly staffed and led by Italy until transition.</p>

<p>be supported by surge capacity from Dhi Qar and Basra (and eventually </p>
<p>just Basra).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>453. </b> The IPU described this as the “4-2-1” model, as four PRTs reduced to two (Basra </p>
<p>and Dhi Qar) and then one (Basra) over time. </p>
<p><b>454. </b> The IPU advised that the US would need to agree the UK model, which might </p>
<p>require Ministerial-level discussions with US counterparts. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> At the meeting, Mr Straw said that the IPU paper “proposed that we went along </p>
<p>with the United States’ proposal but without disrupting our own plans for military </p>
<p>transition”.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> Dr Reid agreed that the UK response should be positive, but stressed the </p>
<p>need to keep control of and tailor developing PRT plans in the provinces where the UK </p>
<p>was directly involved. </p>
<p><b>456. </b> DOP(I) agreed the paper.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>457. </b> Officials revisited the decision to adopt a 4-2-1 model in January 2006. </p>
<p><b>458. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Benn at the end of November, reporting that the Deputy </p>
<p>Governor of Basra and members of the Basra Provincial Council had pressed for more </p>
<p>visible UK development projects, and had drawn attention to a number of DFID projects </p>
<p>that had recently been closed.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>459. </b> Mr Straw understood that those projects had been funded from the employment </p>
<p>generation component of the southern Iraq Employment and Services Programme </p>
<p>(SIESP), which DFID had closed down in August 2005. Mr Straw recognised the security </p>
<p>constraints and the need to ensure funds were properly used, but asked that DFID </p>
<p>officials look for some way to respond to the Councillors’ request for “highly visible, </p>
<p>‘flagship’ projects”.</p>
<p><b>460. </b> Mr Benn replied on 9 December, highlighting the work DFID was doing in Basra </p>
<p>and with the Provincial Council.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> He did not offer new proposals and cautioned that </p>
<p>DFID had to be “extremely careful” about publicising reconstruction projects, in case </p>
<p>such publicity made workers and projects more attractive targets for insurgents. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>462. </b> Papers for the final DOP(I) meeting of 2005, on 20 December, included a </p>
<p>post-election work plan by the IPU, an update on progress with Iraqiisation and a note </p>
<p>on the handover of security responsibility.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>463. </b> The IPU work plan described the UK’s immediate objectives post election as:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A short and well-managed interregnum between Transitional Government and </p>
<p>the next Government, leading to;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Rapid formation of a competent and representative Government, legitimate in </p>
<p>the eyes of all Iraq’s communities, followed by;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A limited number of key decisions (which serve the Iraqi people and partnership </p>
<p>between Iraq and the Coalition) taken quickly and visibly, in parallel with;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increasing Sunni Arab political participation and;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Smooth progress in the South-East towards transition</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Visible international commitment, in context of 2006 partnership with Iraq.” </p>
<p>266</p>
<p><b>464. </b> The IPU hoped that it might be possible for an Iraqi government to be formed by </p>
<p>the end of January, six weeks after the election.</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Negotiations to form a new government continued into spring 2006. Section 9.4 </p>
<p>describes UK efforts to encourage the formation of a broad and inclusive government of </p>
<p>national unity. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> One month after the DOP(I) decision to adopt a 4-2-1 model for PRTs in the South, </p>
<p>the UK adopted a new model which focused on Basra and Dhi Qar only. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Air Chief Marshal Glenn Torpy, the Chief of Joint Operations, advised Lt Gen Fry </p>
<p>on 21 December that the 4-2-1 model appeared to satisfy the US.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> The UK now </p>
<p>needed to press ahead quickly to keep the initiative. First indications were that neither </p>
<p>the FCO nor DFID could find additional financial resources; the MOD would have to </p>
<p>“bridge the gap”. Initial funding requirements might be “modest” and could be generated </p>
<p>by making savings elsewhere in MND(SE). The MOD would also need to push the other </p>
<p>departments to deploy the staff necessary to get the PRTs off the ground quickly.</p>
<p><b>468. </b> The 29 December IPU update for DOP(I) members stated that, faced with logistical </p>
<p>and financial difficulties, US enthusiasm for the PRT model was waning and their roll-out </p>
<p>timetable was slipping.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p> US officials were “increasingly flexible” about UK plans for the </p>
<p>PRT structure in the South and would “not look too closely at implementation (especially </p>
<p>in Maysan and Muthanna)”. That provided the UK with an opportunity to establish the </p>

<p>PRT structure which best fitted the situation in the South and to ensure that the PRTs </p>
<p>assisted rather than hindered “our main transition effort”. </p>
<p><b>469. </b> The Cabinet Office chaired a video conference of officials in London, PJHQ, Basra </p>
<p>and Baghdad on 5 January 2006 to discuss how to establish PRTs in the South.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>record of the meeting stated that: </p>
<p>“With the US in disarray over PRTs, and following further UK scoping work in </p>
<p>theatre, a 4-2-1 approach to PRTs no longer appears to be either a necessary </p>
<p>or best solution.” </p>
<p><b>470. </b> There was a fundamental mismatch between: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the timelines for UK military transition in Maysan and Muthanna (planned for </p>
<p>May 2006, only five months away);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the civilian and military resources available; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the time needed to recruit, train, deploy and get value from staff posted into </p>
<p>a new PRT. </p>
<p><b>471. </b> A focus on Basra and Dhi Qar was likely to be “sellable to the US”. </p>
<p><b>472. </b> The meeting concluded that Ministers should be invited to agree a revised </p>
<p>approach that focused on Basra and Dhi Qar. </p>
<p><b>473. </b> Ministers approved the new approach, comprising a UK-led PRT in Basra and </p>
<p>an Italian-led PRT in Dhi Qar, later that month.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>474. </b> A DFID official briefed Mr Benn on 31 January that:</p>
<p>“We [DFID] are working to ensure that management mechanisms and funding </p>
<p>remain shared responsibilities between the three departments [MOD, FCO and </p>
<p>DFID]. We would welcome a discussion with you about our ideas on how to remain </p>
<p>helpful and engaged, while avoiding being asked to lead on PRTs.” </p>
<p>271</p>
<p><b>475. </b> The UK-led PRT in Basra was established in May 2006. </p>
<p><b>476. </b> In her evidence to the Inquiry, Ms Cameron, who had visited Iraq over Christmas </p>
<p>2005 to help develop the UK’s response to the US PRT proposal, suggested that the </p>
<p>need to see off the “bad ideas” encapsulated in the proposal, and the need to develop </p>
<p>a response which did not undermine the UK’s plans for transition in the South, had </p>
<p>meant that the UK had not had the time to stand back and think through what it needed </p>
<p>to deliver in Basra.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> She concluded that the PRT model was an improvement on the </p>

<p>previous, more fragmented, arrangement, but less of a “step-change” than it might </p>

<p><b>477. </b> Mr Tansley agreed with that assessment.</p>

<p><b>Preparing for the transfer of security responsibility in Maysan </b></p>
<p><b>and Muthanna</b></p>
<p><b>478. </b> Section 9.4 describes planning and preparations for the transfer of lead </p>
<p>responsibility for security in Muthanna and Maysan to the Iraqi authorities (scheduled </p>
<p>for May 2006).</p>
<p><b>479. </b> Mr Patey issued his annual review of the state of Iraq on 10 January.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>characterised 2005 as a “year of democracy”, despite the persistent violence. The </p>
<p>development of the Constitution and elections had diverted attention from establishing </p>
<p>“effective governance”, and in a number of areas Iraq had regressed:</p>
<p>“The year ended with Baghdad on three hours of power a day and falls in oil exports. </p>
<p>The Government did just enough (courtesy of a high degree of flexibility from the </p>
<p>IMF and much help from us) to achieve an interim SBA [Stand-By Arrangement] that </p>
<p>keeps the debt relief programme in track but there is not much else to report by way </p>
<p>of achievements.” </p>
<p><b>480. </b> Mr Straw visited Iraq on 6 and 7 January. His report to Mr Blair focused on </p>
<p>progress in forming a new Iraqi Government but also highlighted the need to consider </p>
<p>how to increase international engagement.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>481. </b> The key would be to persuade the UN to play a more active role. The UK and US </p>
<p>were working on the problem of providing the UN with air assets and security. The UK </p>
<p>also needed to persuade the US “to take the UN more seriously into its confidence”: </p>
<p>the US had been receptive at official level but the message needed to be reinforced </p>
<p>at a political level. </p>
<p><b>482. </b> In discussion with President Bush on 10 January, Mr Blair said that it would </p>
<p>help to unlock outstanding aid pledges if the new Iraqi Government set out a “forward </p>
<p>programme” covering security, coalition posture and reconstruction, which the UN and </p>
<p>coalition could get behind.</p>

<p>277</p>
<p><b>484. </b> Mr Straw’s briefing for the meeting stated that the obstacles to deeper UN </p>
<p>engagement were “acute scepticism” within UN headquarters about Iraq and “justifiable” </p>
<p>UN concern that it lacked the transport and security assets it needed to do a decent </p>
<p>job.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> On the latter point, only the US had sufficient resources to help. The UK was </p>
<p>lobbying the US to engage with and support the UN, using the argument that an </p>
<p>empowered UN leading international engagement in 2006 offered the US (and the UK) </p>
<p>a way of gradually reducing their commitment. </p>
<p><b>485. </b> At the DOP(I) meeting, Ministers commented that a “new effort” was needed to </p>

<p><b>486. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary advised him on 17 January that the power situation </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>492. </b> On reconstruction and development, the UN was now a “key player”. UN </p>
<p>development agencies wanted to increase their presence in Iraq, but with a UN ceiling of </p>
<p>125 staff and priority consistently given to constitutional and political specialists, the UN </p>
<p>could “at best” accommodate only three development or humanitarian specialists at any </p>
<p>one time. The UK also wanted the UN to do more to help improve Iraqi observance of </p>
<p>human rights; at present, the UN appeared reluctant to engage. </p>
<p><b>493. </b> The UK would help secure increased UN engagement through Ministerial </p>
<p>and official level lobbying of the UN (to encourage them to play a greater role), the </p>
<p>US (to underline the value of the UN), and the EC, Japan and European countries </p>
<p>(to get them to lobby the UN to play a greater role, and to fund it to do so). </p>
<p><b>494. </b> In his letter to Mr Blair, Mr Straw described a transformed UN effort as “a catalyst </p>
<p>to broader and deeper international engagement”.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p><b>495. </b> The second paper considered how the UK could support transition in Iraq from a </p>
<p>“primarily security based coalition” to a broader international partnership.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> The UK’s </p>
<p>strategic objective would be to enable the Iraqi Government to assume more effective </p>
<p>control over Iraqi territory and the security, political and economic agendas. The UK </p>
<p>would seek to develop a broader international partnership, which would require improved </p>
<p>security and an increased UN presence. </p>
<p><b>496. </b> Mr Tansley reported from Basra on 20 January that the situation in Maysan and </p>
<p>Muthanna was likely to allow a transfer of security responsibilities in May.</p>
<p>287</p>
<p> Muthanna </p>
<p>was the poorest province in Iraq but essential services were “adequate” and “basic </p>
<p>governance structures” were functioning. Maysan had a weak economy but enjoyed </p>
<p>better essential services and more effective governance than Muthanna. Securing </p>
<p>effective links with central Government would be critical for both provinces. </p>
<p><b>497. </b> Mr Tansley commented on the decision not to establish PRTs in those provinces: </p>
<p>“The situation … in Maysan and Al-Muthanna underlines why PRTs in those </p>
<p>provinces are not required. Military transition will mean no international staff will </p>
<p>be stationed in Maysan and Muthanna, and travel there by them is likely to be only </p>
<p>possible with military escort (it would likely require a battle group). This will also </p>
<p>affect our international partners including the UN … and USAID … (this will need to </p>
<p>be factored into our discussions with the Americans on the 2-1 PRT formula).” </p>
<p><b>498. </b> The DOP(I) meeting on 2 February discussed transfer of security responsibility for </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>499. </b> Ministers commented that the UK needed to consider transition in the wider context </p>
<p>of the legacy that the UK would leave behind in those provinces. </p>
<p><b>500. </b> Ministers also commented that it would not be possible to retain DFID international </p>
<p>staff in Maysan and Muthanna after transition. In practice, their contribution was “useful </p>
<p>but not vital” and infrastructure projects would continue. Civilian control of both provinces </p>
<p>had been in the hands of the Iraqis since the dissolution of the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority (CPA) and even without the transition, the intention was to focus the </p>
<p>reconstruction effort in the South on Basra and Dhi Qar. The security challenges posed </p>
<p>by the transition have a significant impact on other donors, including the UN. </p>
<p><b>501. </b> DOP(I) commissioned the MOD to produce a paper on the transition reflecting </p>
<p>cross-departmental concerns about the transition, “based on a robust assessment of the </p>
<p>conditions in the two provinces”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>502. </b> Dr Reid presented that paper to DOP(I) on 15 February (see Section 9.4).</p>
<p>289</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>503. </b> The MOD paper recommended that both provinces should transition as soon as </p>
<p>possible, with the end of May as a target date. </p>
<p><b>504. </b> The MOD stated that the withdrawal of coalition forces would reduce the amount </p>
<p>of development assistance that could be provided to Muthanna and Maysan by the UK </p>
<p>and other donors, and confirmed that DFID was “content with this, recognising that their </p>
<p>existing support is useful, but not essential, to provincial stability”. The MOD continued: </p>
<p>“DFID will encourage other donors (e.g. the Japanese) to ensure that any </p>
<p>unfinished … projects are completed before closure of permanent bases or able </p>
<p>to be completed by local staff and contractors in slower time, and that plans for </p>
<p>operation and maintenance of completed projects have been made … DFID will </p>
<p>encourage donors with large numbers of local staff (USAID, the UN) to consider how </p>
<p>best they could deploy these in Maysan and Muthanna to continue capacity building </p>
<p>and governance support.”</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Commanders in MND(SE) were confident that they could facilitate travel by FCO, </p>
<p>DFID and international personnel into the provinces after transition. </p>
<p><b>506. </b> The MOD assessed that the UK’s legacy would be “considerable”. ISF </p>
<p>development was on track and would complete in October 2006. In addition:</p>
<p>“UK support has also helped Provincial Governments get on their feet. Working </p>
<p>with ministries in Baghdad, Provincial Councils are able to take decisions, deliver </p>
<p>services, manage budgets and work with donors at a basic level. They are </p>
<p>functioning, but fragile. Increased capacity and recent reforms may not survive </p>
<p>political rivalries and reduced levels of donor support. But in both Provinces we have </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>reached a point where we will achieve diminishing returns if we stay much longer. </p>
<p>The Iraqis are in a position to assume the mantle.”</p>
<p><b>507. </b> At the meeting, Dr Reid said that the political and developmental issues associated </p>
<p>with the transfer of security responsibility in Muthanna in May had been resolved.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>508. </b> DOP(I) agreed the approach set out in the paper.</p>

<p>291</p>
<p> The JIC concluded that the new Iraqi Government would be </p>
<p>judged largely by its ability to deliver security, fuel, electricity, jobs and a timeline for </p>
<p>MNF withdrawal, but that there would be little progress on the first four issues over the </p>
<p>next 12 months. The main obstacles to progress were:</p>
<p>“The security situation is the greatest immediate obstacle to economic recovery …</p>
<p>“The new government will be no more competent or united than its predecessor, at </p>
<p>least initially. The new Prime Minister … will have to develop policy within a more </p>
<p>complex political landscape … The tendency of new Ministers to replace the top tier </p>
<p>of officials with friends, family or tribal members will add to the difficulties. </p>
<p>“The Iraqi civil service lacks the ability to deliver at all levels … Although there are </p>
<p>talented individuals, institutional capacity was effectively destroyed under Saddam’s </p>
<p>dictatorship and in the aftermath of his overthrow: de-Ba’athification, which removed </p>
<p>many experienced bureaucrats, has been especially damaging … Endemic </p>
<p>corruption is a significant brake on economic development, pervading the highest </p>
<p>levels of government, but also reaching into provincial and local levels.” </p>
<p><b>510. </b> The JIC concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The new government would come under international pressure to revitalise </p>
<p>its oil sector and push ahead with economic reforms (including the reduction </p>
<p>of domestic fuel and food subsidies), but would proceed cautiously given the </p>
<p>potential for public discontent. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The fragile state of Iraq’s energy infrastructure and continuing insurgent </p>
<p>and criminal attacks would preclude any early progress on energy supplies. </p>
<p>Electricity production currently met only about 45 percent of demand. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There could be no “international solution” to improving essential services in Iraq. </p>
<p>The Iraqi government needed to adopt a strategy to increase growth and invest </p>
<p>in services and infrastructure. Bilateral and multilateral donors could play a </p>
<p>supporting role, for example by strengthening the budget process and providing </p>
<p>technical advice. </p>

<p><b>DFID’s Portfolio Quality Review, March 2006 </b></p>
<p>DFID undertook an internal review of the performance and “value-for-money” of its </p>
<p>projects in Iraq in March 2006.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The review’s main conclusions were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>71 percent of current, large (over £4m) projects in Iraq were “high risk”, compared </p>
<p>with just over 10 percent of DFID projects globally. Most projects were subject to </p>
<p>the same (political and security) risks, so scope to balance risk was limited.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Of the 14 current, large projects, nine were likely to completely or largely achieve </p>
<p>their objectives and five were likely to partly achieve their objectives or to achieve </p>
<p>their objectives only to a very limited extent.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>44 percent of all DFID projects in Iraq had achieved or were likely to completely </p>
<p>or largely achieve their objectives, compared with 68 percent of DFID projects </p>
<p>globally. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Many projects had benefits beyond their stated objectives, for example in terms </p>
<p>of setting policy agendas, leveraging in other donors’ resources, and “giving DFID </p>
<p>credibility to influence Whitehall”.</p>

<p>The review identified the strategies that DFID had pursued to improve project </p>
<p>performance: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>constant monitoring and management (though that was hampered by insecurity);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using innovative techniques to deliver projects, such as working through local </p>
<p>Iraqi engineers and helping the Ministry of Finance to set up an office inside the </p>
<p>International Zone (within which international consultants could work);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using the fragile states analysis to focus on a few immediate priorities. In Iraq, </p>
<p>DFID had focused on strengthening central Government and getting economic </p>
<p>reform on track;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>systematically tracking poor performance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adapting delivery methods to inside fiduciary risk;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building clear exit strategies into projects, including dedicating significant effort to </p>
<p>leveraging in other donors; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working closely with Whitehall. </p>
<p><b>515. </b> Mr Asquith advised the 7 April meeting of the ISG that following rocket attacks </p>

<p><b>521. </b> The Embassy reported that the Iraqi Government had discussed the 100-day plan </p>

<p>possible penalties for corruption. </p>
<p><b>523. </b> Sir Nigel said that the UK’s ability to help with reconstruction in Basra was </p>

<p>for them, even before security deteriorated. He advocated patience, waiting for local </p>
<p>elections that might bring change, and doing what the UK could to improve the economy. </p>

<p>284</p>
<p><b>526. </b> Mr Blair spoke to Mr Maliki on 28 April, to congratulate him and assure him of the </p>
<p>UK’s support.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that it was important that Mr Maliki had good, capable </p>
<p>people around him, and that the UK stood ready to offer advice and assistance, on both </p>
<p>policy and communications. </p>
<p><b>527. </b> The Cabinet Office circulated a draft FCO paper on Basra, which had been </p>
<p>produced for DOP(I), to members of the ISOG on 28 April.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> The draft FCO paper </p>
<p>stated that:</p>
<p>“Security and governance in Basra are bad and worsening. Attacks on us, and both </p>
<p>criminal and sectarian violence, are rising. Basic services are not being delivered. </p>
<p>Basra is one of the four provinces in Iraq judged by MNF(I) to be furthest away from </p>
<p>transition to full Iraqi control.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The UK civilian effort in Basra is increasingly hunkered down. We face a lack of </p>
<p>co-operation from the local authorities and severe restrictions on our movement. </p>
<p>Our local staff … suffer growing intimidation. Against this background, much of our </p>
<p>effort – notably the Provincial Reconstruction Team we are standing up in May – </p>
<p>can make little headway.”</p>
<p><b>528. </b> The FCO paper was not submitted to DOP(I), but did inform discussions on 22 May </p>
<p>between senior officials on how to achieve UK objectives in Basra. </p>
<p><b>529. </b> Mr Blair held a Cabinet reshuffle in early May 2006. Mr Benn remained </p>
<p>Development Secretary; Mr Des Browne replaced Dr Reid as Defence Secretary; and </p>
<p>Mrs Margaret Beckett replaced Mr Straw as Foreign Secretary. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> Mr Mark Lowcock, DFID Director General Policy and Programmes, and </p>
<p>Mr Anderson visited Baghdad from 2 to 5 May.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> They reported to Mr Chakrabarti that </p>
<p>the new Iraqi Government faced a daunting economic reform agenda. The 100-day plan </p>
<p>contained some of the necessary reforms, but it seemed unlikely that it would garner </p>
<p>wider political support given the fragile political deals underpinning the new Government. </p>
<p><b>531. </b> Iraq had enjoyed a “massive windfall” from the rising oil price, possibly an </p>
<p>additional US$20bn a year. That dwarfed the amount of aid provided to Iraq. While some </p>
<p>of that windfall had been used to increase the budget: </p>
<p>“… billions – some people say tens of billions – has been lost through large-scale </p>
<p>corruption and other leakage. Who has got the money and what do they plan to do </p>
<p>with it? And how is the Government going to regain control?” </p>
<p><b>532. </b> Mr Lowcock and Mr Anderson confirmed that DFID should “continue to move </p>
<p>towards more capacity building and … internationalising the effort in Iraq”.</p>

<p>operational within three weeks.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> Its first Head was Mr Mark Etherington (a consultant </p>
<p>contracted by PCRU). </p>
<p><b>536. </b> PCRU funded three new posts in the Basra PRT (its Head, a Communications </p>

<p>existing US, UK and Danish teams.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>537. </b> Mr Etherington wrote to a Cabinet Office official on 17 May outlining the challenges </p>
<p>facing the Basra PRT, the most significant of which was a lack of “operational </p>
<p>coherence”:</p>
<p>“Military and civilian lines of activity are not integrated, and the separation between </p>
<p>military headquarters … and the Consulate in Basra Palace [the British Embassy </p>
<p>Office Basra] has made the formulation and execution of sophisticated unitary </p>
<p>approaches … very difficult. Our outputs are hence fragmentary, prone to duplication </p>
<p>and intrinsically wasteful of resources; and neither are they subsumed to an </p>
<p>over-arching strategy.</p>
<p>“This is because no over-arching, integrated strategy has yet been articulated, </p>
<p>although the need for one has been identified … UK ‘policy’ in S[outhern] Iraq is </p>
<p>hence little more than an aggregation of departmental approaches …” </p>
<p>310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>538. </b> While the PRT’s work “must focus overwhelmingly upon Basra”, it should have a </p>
<p>“low-key southern Iraq co-ordination role”. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> Mr Etherington advised that “reporting was fragmented and lines of authority </p>
<p>divided”. He therefore intended to establish a “Basra Steering Group”, bringing together </p>

<p>for additional funding had been sent to PCRU. Mr Etherington estimated that the cost of </p>
<p>running the PRT (including the cost of the three consultants provided by PCRU) would </p>
<p>be US$1.74m per year. The US had allocated US$15m to each PRT for programme </p>
<p>costs but those funds were unlikely to appear before the summer and would in any </p>
<p>case be insufficient for a province of Basra’s size and challenges. In the meantime, </p>

<p>about the role of the Basra PRT. Mr Etherington believed that its role was to deliver </p>
<p>the “coherent UK cross-government approach” in the South that was currently lacking. </p>
<p>Others believed that the PRT should limit itself to reconstruction. Gen Jackson </p>
<p>commented:</p>
<p>“I sense that we, the UK, have not really thought what we want our PRT to achieve. </p>
<p>If we have, it is not clear in theatre.”</p>
<p><b>542. </b> Gen Jackson reported that his meetings in Basra had caused him to “reflect </p>
<p>once again on the extent to which our military progress in Iraq is mortgaged against </p>
<p>the economic and political LOO [line of operation]”. The constraints imposed on </p>
<p>the economic line of operation by the UK’s International Development Act were an </p>
<p>“enduring concern”:</p>
<p>“To be involved in two campaigns simultaneously [Iraq and Afghanistan] where one </p>
<p>of our three levers of national power is not sufficiently agile or flexible to deliver </p>
<p>immediate campaign effort seems absurd.”</p>

<p>reconstruction.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> Work to build the capacity of the Iraqi Government was progressing </p>
<p>but was “below the radar” and DFID’s infrastructure and essential services projects had </p>
<p>taken some time to “get off the ground”: </p>

<p>some visible effect.”</p>

<p>concerns over the situation in Basra”, for the 15 June meeting of DOP(I).</p>

<p>DFID was funding a World Bank adviser on energy sector management, and </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>leveraging World Bank loans for power projects in response to specific requests </p>
<p>from the Electricity Minister; and</p>

<p>offering a consultant to the Ministry of Electricity to advise on an electricity plan. </p>
<p><b>563. </b> On international support, US and UK officials were discussing options for a </p>
<p>compact between Iraq and the international community. </p>
<p><b>564. </b> The UK’s role in the development of the International Compact is described later </p>
<p>in this Section. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> On capacity building, the UK was supporting a number of key Iraqi institutions but </p>
<p>that effort was “<b>dwarfed by a very large … often overambitious US programme</b>”. </p>
<p>The US had offered to share work it was undertaking to map and improve its </p>
<p>capacity-building effort. That would provide a basis for discussions on a complementary </p>
<p>approach. </p>
<p><b>566. </b> On Basra, officials had been undertaking a “major review of policy” in MND(SE), </p>
<p>in response to concerns (shared by the US) that Basra was not on track to meet the </p>
<p>proposed transition timelines. The “work plan for Basra” had been organised around </p>
<p>four strands: political framework; security; Rule of Law and governance; and economic </p>
<p>development and reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> On the economic development and reconstruction strand, departments had been </p>
<p>reviewing their programmes to ensure that:</p>

<p>plans were in place for the Iraqi Government and the wider donor community </p>
<p>to tackle Basra’s medium- and long-term requirements; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>all projects were delivering a visible dividend to Baswaris. </p>
<p><b>568. </b> Funding had been found from existing resources for a number of new initiatives, </p>

<p>“There is a tension between, on the one hand, our growing conviction that </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>292</p>
<p><b>575. </b> Mr Browne also advised that in response to Mr Blair’s visit to Iraq in late May:</p>
<p>“… the southern Iraq Steering Group has been set up, chaired by [the] Consul </p>
<p>General with participation from across departments and agencies to co-ordinate </p>
<p>delivery of a coherent strategy for southern Iraq, focused on Basra. Much of the </p>
<p>work on governance, rule of law and infrastructure will now be delivered in a </p>
<p>coherent fashion through the new UK-led Provincial Reconstruction Team in Basra, </p>
<p>drawing together inputs from the US, Danes and other international partners.” </p>
<p><b>576. </b> The Basra PRT was now fully staffed, but lacked funding for project work </p>
<p>and would need funding for running costs from December 2006. US funds had not </p>
<p>yet arrived.</p>
<p><b>577. </b> The 6 July meeting of DOP(I) discussed Mr Browne’s letter to Mr Blair and agreed </p>
<p>his proposals in principle.</p>
<p>330</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>578. </b> Mrs Beckett and Mr Benn said that their budgets for Iraq were fully committed, </p>
<p>but were asked to look again at reprioritising their spending to fund the Better Basra </p>
<p>projects. </p>
<p><b>579. </b> Ministers agreed that there was a need for a comprehensive communications plan </p>
<p>to highlight UK activity on reconstruction to politicians in Baghdad and Basra. The plan </p>
<p>should include other donors’ activity, to give a clear picture of the totality of development </p>
<p>assistance that the UK presence was bringing to southern Iraq. </p>
<p><b>580. </b> Ministers also recognised the risk to locally engaged staff, who were being </p>
<p>targeted. At least three locally engaged members of staff working for the Coalition had </p>
<p>been killed. FCO and DFID locally engaged staff were being offered the chance to </p>
<p>resign, work at home, or work at a different location. </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Discussions on funding the Better Basra Action Plan continued into August.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>582. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Stephen Timms, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, </p>
<p>on 15 August that departments had agreed to provide a total of £20.4m from existing </p>
<p>resources to fund the Better Basra Action Plan, now costed at £26.5m (due to the later </p>
<p>start for some of the work).</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> The FCO had contributed £12.4m (of which £7m was from </p>
<p>the GCPP Reserve), the MOD £4m and DFID £4m. Negotiations had been difficult, with </p>
<p>the MOD offering “considerable resistance” to the need to find its contribution from the </p>
<p>core defence budget. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> Mr Timms wrote to Mr Browne the same day, welcoming the successful conclusion </p>
<p>of negotiations and agreeing to provide an additional £4m for the Plan from the central </p>

<p><b>584. </b> Mr Dinham told the Inquiry that the Better Basra Action Plan was a “proper, agreed, </p>
<p>bought-into, cross-Whitehall plan”, which had led to greater unity of purpose across the </p>
<p>UK effort.</p>
<p>333</p>
<p> He added that the Plan did not seek to reflect the totality of the UK effort; for </p>
<p>example, major DFID projects to increase power supply were starting to come on stream </p>
<p>and contributed to achieving the UK’s objectives. </p>
<p><b>585. </b> Mr Etherington told the Inquiry that the Better Basra Action Plan was “a set of </p>
<p>aspirations” rather than a plan.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>586. </b> Mrs Beckett told Cabinet on 13 July that responsibility for security in Muthanna </p>
<p>had been handed from British to Iraqi forces earlier that day.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>587. </b> On 19 July, the JIC judged that violence was at the highest sustained level since </p>
<p>April 2003, outpacing the Iraqi Government’s ability to respond.</p>
<p>336</p>
<p> “Spiralling sectarian </p>
<p>violence” was the most immediate threat to Iraq’s progress. </p>
<p><b>588. </b> Mr Patey’s valedictory report from Baghdad on 20 July opened with the warning: </p>
<p>“Strategic failure in Iraq a distinct possibility but not inevitable.” </p>
<p>337</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>589. </b> Mr Patey advised that:</p>
<p>“Without progress on security the encouraging start made by DPM [Deputy Prime </p>
<p>Minister] Barham Salih and his economic team will be stillborn. The exodus of </p>
<p>businessmen and the Iraqi middle class continues due to security concerns. They </p>
<p>will take some persuading to return a second time but their entrepreneurial skills </p>
<p>will be vital if the country is to thrive.” </p>
<p><b>590. </b> Mr Patey’s valedictory report was passed to Mr Blair on 21 July.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p><b>591. </b> The ISG reflected on reporting from Baghdad, and its implications for the existing </p>
<p>strategy, on 27 July.</p>
<p>339</p>
<p> The ISG agreed that although success or failure in Baghdad </p>
<p>would be critical to overall campaign success in Iraq and was therefore the coalition’s </p>
<p>highest priority, the “best way for the UK to contribute to the wider military campaign was </p>
<p>to continue to focus our limited resources on MND(SE), in particular, on Basra”. </p>
<p><b>592. </b> At the meeting, Mr Dinham argued that the UK should focus its future support on </p>
<p>central government and in particular on budgetary management and critical economic </p>
<p>reforms. Iraq was now enjoying increased revenue as a result of higher oil prices and </p>
<p>slowly rising exports; the challenge was to ensure those revenues were redirected from </p>
<p>wasteful and damaging subsidies to investment in public services. The security situation </p>

<p>“… an entirely sound approach, but noted the large gap between what we planned </p>
<p>to offer and Iraqi expectations. This would need careful management.” </p>
<p><b>593. </b> Dr Rosalind Marsden, the newly arrived Consul General in Basra, reported on </p>
<p>24 August that her first impression of the Basra political scene was of “stasis”.</p>
<p>340</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>Provincial Government had yet to show itself capable of responding to Basra’s major </p>
<p>security and economic challenges. Local leaders were comfortable blaming each other </p>
<p>and the coalition for the lack of progress, while pursuing their “criminal interests”. The </p>
<p>Better Basra Plan had “most of the ingredients” to break the log-jam, but the UK’s </p>
<p>influence was diminishing. </p>
<p><b>594. </b> Section 9.5 describes the development in August and September of Operation </p>

<p> </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that Op SALAMANCA comprised three major elements:</p>
<p>“… what we did was select different areas of the city, and … surging with </p>
<p>concentration of force, secure the area, put teams into the police stations to go </p>
<p>through the police stations with a fine-toothed comb, to establish the state of </p>
<p>police stations … </p>
<p>“We surged police training teams in, Royal Military Police and contract policemen </p>
<p>from elsewhere. At the same time we conducted a number of pre-planned </p>
<p>reconstruction and other projects, everything from levelling football pitches to </p>
<p>playgrounds, to refurbishing schools.” </p>

<p><b>596. </b> Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director General Operational Policy, told the 25 August </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The JIC judged that after five months in office:</p>
<p>“… the faction-based Iraqi Government is proving ineffective … Co-ordination </p>
<p>between and within Government ministries is poor. None of this looks likely to </p>
<p>improve in the near future. Meanwhile, sectarian and insurgent violence is at </p>
<p>a record high, and fuel, water and electricity shortages persist across much </p>
<p>of the country.”</p>
<p><b>601. </b> The 12 October meeting of DOP(I) received a paper by officials on the </p>
<p>medium-term prospects for Iraq.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>602. </b> A DFID official advised Mr Benn in advance of the meeting that the paper had </p>
<p>been “inspired by” Mr Patey’s valedictory telegram (which had assessed that strategic </p>
<p>failure in Iraq was a distinct possibility but not inevitable), and was set in the context of </p>
<p>increasing insecurity.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>603. </b> The official advised Mr Benn that discussions around the paper provided a good </p>
<p>opportunity for DFID to reassure departments – especially the MOD – that it was </p>
<p>“shouldering our share of the burden” in Iraq. DFID’s two current projects in the South, </p>
<p>the IISP and the Governorate Capacity Building Project, were due to finish in March </p>
<p>2007, when DFID would aim to close its office in Basra. Deteriorating security meant no </p>
<p>new projects could be designed or implemented. There was “little/no expectation” from </p>
<p>the MOD or FCO that DFID would continue to invest in infrastructure, given the flow of </p>
<p>US CERPs money and anticipated investments by Japan, the World Bank and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government itself. The official concluded:</p>
<p>“We have largely won the argument that DFID should shift focus from physical </p>
<p>investments in Basra to technical assistance in Baghdad to maximise our impact, </p>
<p>and the [medium-term] paper reflects this in its recommendations.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>296</p>
<p><b>604. </b> The medium-term prospects paper assessed that Iraq had reached a critical </p>
<p>juncture, with violence at its highest ever level, reconciliation making little headway and </p>
<p>public services still in a parlous state.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> The UK’s existing goal for Iraq was: </p>
<p>“A democratic, stable, united and law-abiding Iraq … providing effective, </p>
<p>representative and inclusive government for all its people.”</p>
<p>That was now likely to be the “best case outcome”, and unlikely to be achievable in full. </p>
<p>The best achievable outcome was likely to be:</p>
<p>“… an Iraq which can govern and sustain itself nationally and provincially, and </p>
<p>where sectarian and other violence is contained short of the point where it would </p>
<p>overwhelm Iraq’s institutions and precipitate chaos and/or civil war.”</p>
<p>Achieving that outcome lay primarily in the hands of the Iraqi Government. The UK’s </p>
<p>ability to influence its decisions would continue to decline. The coalition’s current </p>
<p>strategy of direct support combined with building Iraqi capacity remained the only </p>
<p>credible way to exert influence. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> The paper argued that Iraq’s economic success depended more on the policies </p>
<p>and actions of the Iraqi Government than on the backing of the international community. </p>
<p>High oil prices had bolstered Iraq’s finances, but the Iraqi Government needed </p>
<p>assistance in managing the economy, bringing about structural reforms, and unblocking </p>
<p>domestic investment to improve public services. The implications for the UK were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s effort in Basra should be channelled as far as possible through the </p>
<p>PRT, which might need to continue work into 2008 in line with the planned UK </p>
<p>military effort. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>DFID’s programme should increasingly be directed at enabling the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to tackle key challenges at the centre, including reconciliation, </p>
<p>economic management and critical capacity deficits. </p>
<p><b>606. </b> The DOP(I) meeting touched only very briefly on the paper, as Mr Browne </p>
<p>indicated he would like more time to discuss and agree it formally at a later date.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>607. </b> DOP(I) discussed the medium-term prospects paper at their next meeting, on </p>
<p>20 October.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> Mr Blair was not present, so Mr Browne chaired the meeting.</p>
<p><b>608. </b> Mr Browne began by saying that the existing goal would be difficult to achieve, but </p>
<p>Ministers had to be certain that there was not more the UK could do before accepting </p>
<p>anything less. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>609. </b> Mr Browne also said that DFID’s aspiration to move its focus to Baghdad was </p>
<p>well understood, but the UK had a significant stake in the South and needed a clearer </p>
<p>understanding of the impact of such a move on activity there. </p>
<p><b>610. </b> In discussion, a member of DOP(I) said that most DFID projects in the South were </p>
<p>likely to be completed by spring 2007 and that no new projects could be started under </p>
<p>current security circumstances. The UK’s medium-term legacy depended on getting </p>
<p>economic management and reconciliation going and Baghdad functioning, which meant </p>
<p>building capacity in central ministries. </p>
<p><b>611. </b> DOP(I) agreed that the UK should keep the existing policy goal, but recognise that </p>
<p>the best outcome achievable might fall short of it.</p>
<p><b>612. </b> It also agreed that a progressive reduction of UK forces to 4,500 in 2007, in concert </p>
<p>with US and other allies, was possible, with more ambitious reductions being considered </p>
<p>at the end of November. </p>
<p><b>613. </b> The medium-term prospects paper was discussed again at the 26 October meeting </p>
<p>of DOP, alongside an update from Mr Browne on security developments in Iraq.</p>
<p>353</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>614. </b> ACM Stirrup advised that Op SINBAD “could not be going better, although </p>
<p>there had been an increase in the number of indirect fire attacks on the Basra Palace </p>
<p>Compound”. The main concern of Basrawis was whether the success of the operation </p>
<p>could be sustained, which “would require engagement and funds from the Government </p>
<p>in Baghdad”.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> DOP agreed the analysis and recommendations contained in the medium-term </p>
<p>prospects paper. </p>
<p><b>616. </b> Section 15.1 describes the increasing threat posed by rocket and mortar fire to </p>
<p>Basra Palace Compound (BPC), and the discussions within the UK Government on how </p>
<p>to respond. </p>
<p><b>617. </b> At the 27 October meeting of the ISG, Mr Simon McDonald, FCO Director Iraq, </p>
<p>reported that the security situation in Basra had deteriorated to the point where Mrs </p>
<p>Beckett had decided it was necessary to withdraw the majority of civilian staff from the </p>
<p>BPC to Basra Air Station (BAS) or out of theatre.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>618. </b> The BPC housed the British Embassy Office Basra, the DFID Basra Office, </p>
<p>elements of the police and prisons teams, and the PRT.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> MND(SE) was already located </p>
<p>at BAS. </p>
<p><b>619. </b> The lack of hardened accommodation suitable for civilian staff at BAS meant that </p>
<p>not all staff could be relocated immediately. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>298</p>
<p><b>620. </b> The PRT withdrew to Kuwait and redeployed to BAS in mid-December, when </p>
<p>sufficient hardened accommodation had been constructed.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>621. </b> Mr Blair was advised by his Private Secretary later that day that “this move is likely </p>
<p>to be seen as a victory by those attacking us”.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> Dr Marsden and four FCO civilian staff </p>
<p>would remain in the BPC, while other staff would relocate elsewhere (the majority to </p>
<p>the BAS). </p>
<p><b>622. </b> The US Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) </p>
<p>published its audit of PRT capability on 29 October.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> The audit, which had been </p>
<p>conducted over the summer, concluded that while the creation of 10 PRTs and eight </p>
<p>satellite offices was a “noteworthy achievement”, many obstacles to effective operation </p>
<p>remained. Those included insecurity, delays in providing funding, the difficulty of </p>
<p>recruiting and retaining qualified civilian personnel, and the difficulty of integrating </p>
<p>civilian and military personnel. </p>
<p><b>623. </b> On the Basra PRT, SIGIR assessed that the unstable security situation meant that </p>
<p>PRT members had not been able to interact personally with their Iraqi counterparts, </p>
<p>significantly limiting the PRT’s ability to achieve its mission. It questioned “whether the </p>
<p>continued deployment of PRT personnel to … Basra … makes operational sense at </p>
<p>this time”. </p>
<p><b>624. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that the UK Government discussed the </p>
<p>SIGIR audit. </p>
<p><b>625. </b> The 2 November weekly update from GOC(MND)SE, which was sent by </p>
<p>Maj Gen Shirreff’s Chief of Staff, reported that the withdrawal of civilian personnel had </p>
<p>come as a surprise to MND(SE).</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> It was expected to have an adverse impact, including </p>
<p>by disrupting long-term reconstruction because of the “haste with which the PRT has </p>
<p>been evacuated”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>626. </b> On 7 November, the British Embassy Baghdad and the British Embassy Office </p>
<p>Basra responded to an IPU request for accounts of what life was like for ordinary Iraqi </p>
<p>citizens. Their replies warned that they could offer only an impressionistic view due to </p>
<p>the constraints under which they operated. </p>
<p><b>627. </b> The Embassy reported that: </p>
<p>“Our protected circumstances constrain our ability to interact with ordinary Iraqis </p>
<p>or even visit Baghdad. Our impressions can only be gleaned through the press, </p>
<p>or piecemeal, anecdotally and at second or third hand.” </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>299</p>
<p><b>628. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra offered a similar view:</p>
<p>“We cannot go into ordinary Iraqi homes, shops and schools or move freely around </p>
<p>the city (or even our own compound). Nearly all our local staff have left because of </p>
<p>death threats and intimidation.” </p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>629. </b> The accounts were passed to Mr Blair on 10 November.</p>
<p>362</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>630. </b> DOP(I) considered the impact of the withdrawal of civilian personnel on </p>
<p>16 November.</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> Mrs Beckett and Sir Suma Chakrabarti reported that the impact of the </p>
<p>withdrawal of civilian personnel from the BPC on the Better Basra Action Plan and on </p>
<p>DFID’s programmes had been “marginal”. </p>
<p><b>631. </b> Mrs Beckett summed up that officials should develop some clear and agreed </p>
<p>forward planning on the future of the civilian and military presence in Basra.</p>
<p><b>632. </b> A December 2006 joint DFID/PCRU report assessed that the impact of the PRT’s </p>
<p>withdrawal from the BPC to Kuwait on its work was “significant but not catastrophic”.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Little of its work required face-to-face contact with Iraqi citizens. </p>
<p><b>633. </b> The relocation of the PRT from Kuwait to BAS was under way, and the benefits of </p>
<p>co-location with MND(SE) were already apparent. The PRT’s access to military partners </p>
<p>went some way to overcoming problems caused by the lack of a common secure </p>
<p>communication system between civilians and the military. Informal contacts were also </p>
<p>helping to build mutual understanding of objectives and aims. </p>
<p><b>634. </b> A number of witnesses told the Inquiry that the move to BAS led to much greater </p>
<p>contact between UK civilian personnel and Iraqi citizens. Mr Robert Tinline, Deputy </p>
<p>Consul General in Basra, described BAS as a “neutral venue”:</p>
<p>“Because we were next to the airport, which was Iraqi obviously, but close enough </p>
<p>to our security … that meant they [our Iraqi interlocutors] didn’t have to come and </p>
<p>see us and we didn’t have to go and see them. So it was actually very good.” </p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>635. </b> Section 9.5 describes the wider implications of the withdrawal of civilian personnel, </p>
<p>including for US/UK relations. </p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Gordon Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, visited Basra on </p>
<p>18 November.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> During that visit, Maj Gen Shirreff expressed his concern that long-term </p>
<p>economic and development work was being prioritised above short-term interventions </p>
<p>that would yield more immediate results. He proposed that the UK should establish a </p>

<p>joint (civilian and military) taskforce, under a single (unspecified) command, to plan such </p>
<p>short-term interventions. </p>
<p><b>637. </b> Section 9.5 describes the development in October and November of the UK’s </p>
<p>Forward Plan, at Mr Blair’s request. </p>
<p><b>638. </b> Mr McDonald sent a draft Plan to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 24 November.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Copies of the draft were sent to Mrs Beckett, Mr Browne and SIS, but not Mr Benn. </p>
<p><b>639. </b> The draft Plan recognised that:</p>
<p>“The wider context … is the growing reality of Iraqi sovereignty. The Iraqi </p>
<p>Government and political class have their own priorities, which are not the same as </p>
<p>ours. Maliki’s highest priority now is accelerating the pace of security transition.”</p>
<p><b>640. </b> The draft Plan included proposed actions under three headings:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Political accommodation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Governance and economic development; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> On governance and economic development, the draft Plan identified the “core </p>
<p>problems” as a lack of political will and leadership and weak capacity across the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to drive forward a reform agenda and spend its budget. The immediate </p>
<p>objective was to impress upon Prime Minister Maliki and his senior Ministers and </p>
<p>advisers that economic management and reform required sustained attention and </p>
<p>visible leadership, as a strategic and security issue. Prime Minister Maliki also needed </p>
<p>to ensure that provincial governments were properly resourced and held to account, </p>
<p>as part of the process of forging a political settlement. </p>
<p><b>642. </b> Immediate actions that Prime Minister Maliki might take included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>striking a deal on oil revenue sharing and starting to restructure the oil sector </p>
<p>so it behaved more like a business;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>striking a deal on fiscal federalism, and getting Iraqi resources flowing to the </p>
<p>provinces to improve services; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>by early 2007, adopting the International Compact as a key part of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government’s reform agenda.</p>
<p><b>643. </b> The UK would also press Prime Minister Maliki to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish and chair an “economic Task Force” to give strategic direction </p>
<p>on economic management and reform and hold Ministers and provincial </p>
<p>governments to account; </p>

<p><b>644. </b> The draft Plan stated that that was an ambitious and complex agenda. Progress </p>
<p>on reform had so far been limited and the UK needed to be realistic about chances of </p>
<p>“widespread success” in the next six months, although traction was improving in some </p>
<p>areas as the quality of Ministers and political leadership improved. </p>
<p><b>645. </b> Responding to Mr McDonald, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary reported that he had </p>
<p>described the Forward Plan as “an excellent piece of work”.</p>

<p>deal had been achieved: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Over US$50m had been committed to more than 150 short- and medium-term </p>
<p>projects, creating over 12,000 jobs. The projects had been selected with the </p>
<p>relevant Iraqi authorities; that approach had won public and political consent </p>
<p>at the local, regional and national level.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been an improvement in the general security situation and in the </p>
<p>confidence and capability of the ISF. Further action was needed to reduce </p>
<p>indirect fire and tackle corruption in the Iraq Police Service. </p>
<p><b>648. </b> On reconstruction, Maj Gen Shirreff commented: </p>
<p>“… the area that will underwrite the success of Op SINBAD is reconstruction and </p>
<p>economic development. I have previously mentioned the need to fill the gap between </p>
<p>the immediate impact projects of Op SINBAD and whatever longer-term activity is </p>
<p>undertaken by the PRT as well as the requirement to co-ordinate the efforts of the </p>

<p><b>649. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff reported that he had agreed with Dr Marsden and the Head of </p>
<p>the DFID Office in Basra that to address that gap, the PRT needed to be directed to </p>
<p>work more closely with MND(SE), and that it needed clearer direction from London to </p>
<p>ensure it focused on delivering short-term projects rather than on long-term projects to </p>

<p>he spent US$80m.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>652. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff also told the Inquiry that while MND(SE) worked with the PRT as </p>
<p>much as it could, the PRT was in “some state of disarray” at that time.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> He had “pretty </p>
<p>close links” with Dr Marsden and the British Embassy Office Basra, including through a </p>

<p>MND(SE) and the British Embassy Office Basra were not co-located. </p>

<p>18 November, the Treasury convened a meeting with DFID, FCO and MOD officials </p>
<p>on 7 December to consider whether the UK should prioritise short-term economic </p>
<p>interventions in Basra.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>655. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Brown on 13 December that the meeting had </p>
<p>concluded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Money was not a “binding constraint” in the South. The “potential pool” </p>
<p>comprised US$176m from the Iraqi Government, US$260m from the US and </p>
<p>US$550m in soft loans from the Japanese. Money was available for short-term </p>
<p>interventions: only £1.1m of the £5m Rapid Reaction Fund (part of DFID’s </p>
<p>SIESP) had so far been spent.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inability to generate good project ideas was a constraint.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Bringing the southern Iraq Steering Group under a single command would be </p>
<p>possible and could be effective but might prove contentious.</p>

<p><b>UK plans for 2007, and the US surge</b></p>
<p><b>659. </b> Section 9.5 describes President Bush’s decision in late November to deploy </p>
<p>additional US troops to Iraq to conduct a full-scale counter-insurgency campaign in </p>
<p>Baghdad, the UK’s response to that decision, and US concerns over UK plans to draw </p>
<p>down troops in the South.</p>
<p><b>660. </b> In preparation for the 7 December meeting of DOP(I), officials prepared a paper on </p>
<p>military plans for southern Iraq in 2007 and a paper on the UK’s objectives and presence </p>
<p>in Basra.</p>
<p><b>661. </b> The MOD paper on military plans for southern Iraq reported that Op SINBAD </p>
<p>could create the conditions to achieve PIC in Basra as early as March 2007.</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>intention was to “re-posture” UK troops from bases in Basra City to BAS at the end </p>
<p>of Op SINBAD. From there, UK forces would perform a “Military Assistance Mission”. </p>
<p>That would lead to a reduction in troop numbers from 7,100 to 4,500 in May 2007, and </p>
<p>possible further reductions later in the year.</p>
<p><b>662. </b> The Basra paper, which was produced by the FCO, considered the implications </p>
<p>of that re-posturing and of the continuing security threat to civilian operations.</p>
<p>376</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>FCO paper recommended aiming for PIC in Basra at some point between March and </p>
<p>June 2007. The civilian effort would be led from BAS as there was no prospect of being </p>
<p>able to return to the BPC. Although this meant a limit on the number of civilian staff </p>
<p>and tougher conditions, there would be “significant advantages in co-location with the </p>
<p>military – making possible a more cohesive approach”.</p>
<p><b>663. </b> The FCO recommended that the main objectives of the civilian effort during 2007 </p>
<p>should be to: </p>

<p><b>664. </b> At the DOP(I) meeting, Mr Benn advised that the UK’s major development projects </p>
<p>were now reaching completion.</p>
<p>377</p>
<p> The arrival of a gas pumping plant in the next few </p>
<p>days would significantly increase gas supply and leave a positive legacy. Although the </p>
<p>water towers projects had been delayed by security risks, DFID planned to move its </p>
<p>focus to capacity-building. The main challenge now would be ensuring the Provincial </p>
<p>Council received the necessary funds from Baghdad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>665. </b> Mr Benn also said “a silent crisis” was unfolding in Iraq, as Iraqi citizens fled from </p>
<p>sectarian violence. That was putting increasing pressure on Iraqi services. DFID had </p>
<p>provided £1.4m to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). </p>

<p>378</p>
<p> He emphasised the </p>

<p>helping to create a more effective system for the disbursement of money within Iraq. </p>
<p><b>668. </b> On 5 January 2007, President Bush briefed Mr Blair ahead of his speech on Iraq </p>
<p>the following week.</p>
<p>379</p>
<p> During the call he described a significant increase in US and Iraqi </p>
<p>troops, and a number of personnel changes. </p>
<p><b>669. </b> Mr Blair said that it was vital to break the back of the violence in Baghdad. He </p>
<p>urged President Bush to focus on reconciliation and reconstruction as well as security, </p>
<p>suggesting that it might be helpful to designate individuals who would be accountable for </p>
<p>leading work on those areas.</p>
<p><b>670. </b> Mr Blair’s Private Secretary wrote to Mrs Beckett’s Private Secretary on 8 January:</p>
<p>“We are entering an important new phase in the Coalition effort in Iraq, as – </p>
<p>following the US review and in the light of our plans in Basra – we and the US </p>
<p>attempt to help the Iraqi Government entrench genuine change and progress in the </p>
<p>areas of security, reconstruction and reconciliation. The Prime Minister judges that </p>
<p>our present level of effort should be stepped up in response. He would like to see </p>
<p>a qualitative change in our ability to monitor progress in these key areas, to identify </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>a detailed report on reconstruction; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a weekly report on political development, security and economic activity </p>
<p>in Basra. </p>
<p><b>672. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke again on 9 January.</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> Mr Blair said that he had </p>
<p>asked for changes in the way that the UK system monitored and chased up progress </p>
<p>in Iraq. Information, for example on reconstruction, was incomplete. The US and UK </p>
<p>needed to be sure that everything that could be done on reconstruction was being done. </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that he wanted someone on the UK side “such as a senior military figure” to </p>
<p>travel around Iraq and report on what was actually happening, for example in Najaf. The </p>
<p>US and UK needed to improve delivery of assistance in calmer areas, to demonstrate </p>
<p>that peace brought dividends.</p>
<p><b>673. </b> An 11 January JIC Assessment judged that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There continued to be real economic growth in Iraq, but the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>had shown little commitment to economic reform and large-scale job creation </p>
<p>was highly unlikely in the next two years.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Government was not short of funds (the JIC estimated that the </p>
<p>Government had accumulated some US$12bn since 2003 as a result of unspent </p>
<p>budget allocations), but public investment was hampered by weak central </p>
<p>Government ministries and a lack of competent staff at all levels of Government. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The security situation remained the main obstacle to private sector development </p>
<p>and foreign investment.</p>
<p>382</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>674. </b> President Bush announced the new US strategy in an address to the nation on </p>
<p>10 January:</p>
<p>“The situation in Iraq is unacceptable to the American people – and it is </p>
<p>unacceptable to me …</p>
<p>“It is clear that we need to change our strategy in Iraq.” </p>
<p>383</p>
<p><b>675. </b> President Bush said that a successful strategy needed to combine robust military </p>
<p>operations with visible improvements in Iraqi neighbourhoods and communities. </p>
<p>As well as providing 20,000 additional US troops and increasing efforts to build the </p>
<p>capacity of the ISF, the US would also increase its efforts to build the capacity of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government, including by doubling the number of PRTs and giving US military </p>
<p>commanders and PRT leaders greater flexibility in how they used resources for </p>
<p>economic assistance. </p>

<p>306</p>
<p><b>676. </b> The result of the new strategy set out by President Bush is often referred to in </p>
<p>contemporary documents as the new Baghdad Security Plan. </p>
<p><b>677. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 11 January that the new Iraqi-led </p>
<p>Baghdad Security Plan was under way.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> In contrast to previous plans, there was </p>
<p>greater emphasis on reconstruction, with a focus on job creation. Five “mini-PRTs” had </p>
<p>been embedded with troops in Baghdad to assist with reconstruction operations. The </p>
<p>US also planned to inject funds into Iraqi State-owned enterprises to generate rapid job </p>
<p>creation (the Bradley Initiative). </p>
<p><b>678. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 26 March that the US had spent </p>
<p>US$1.6bn on 1,678 reconstruction projects as part of the new Baghdad Security Plan.</p>

<p><b>Major General Shirreff’s proposal for a military-led UK effort in </b></p>
<p><b>the South</b></p>
<p><b>679. </b> In parallel with discussions on the new US strategy, the UK Government </p>
<p>considered and rejected Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal for a military-led Joint Inter-Agency </p>
<p>Task Force in the South.</p>
<p><b>680. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff wrote to Mr Blair on 29 December to offer, in response to </p>
<p>Mr Blair’s request during his recent visit to Iraq, “some thoughts on how a Joint </p>
<p>Inter-Agency Task Force would deliver concentrated British effect in SE Iraq and improve </p>
<p>the prospects of achieving strategic success”.</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>681. </b> Surveys indicated that Op SINBAD was having a positive effect, but it could do no </p>
<p>more than: </p>
<p>“… create a window of opportunity that must be filled by mass economic effect, </p>
<p>a Rooseveltian New Deal for Basra. Only thus will the militia be defeated. This </p>
<p>requires the mass injection of Iraqi Government funds …” </p>
<p><b>682. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff proposed that to achieve that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government should establish a reconstruction committee for Basra with </p>
<p>authority and capability to spend central Government money; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the coalition should establish an organisation capable of providing the right </p>
<p>advice and planning capability. </p>
<p><b>683. </b> The current arrangement lacked unity of command and purpose. HQ MND(SE) had </p>
<p>the planning muscle, the energy, the staying power and the unity of command to execute </p>
<p>an overarching plan (such as Op SINBAD), but it lacked expertise on reconstruction. The </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>307</p>
<p>PRT, currently below strength and operating out of a hotel in Kuwait, preferred to focus </p>
<p>on long-term capacity-building. Co-location in the new year, when the PRT moved to the </p>
<p>BAS, would help but would not solve the underlying problems. </p>
<p><b>684. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff recommended that the UK should establish a Joint Inter-Agency </p>
<p>Task Force (JIATF) with coalition partners, combining military and reconstruction </p>
<p>expertise under single military command.</p>
<p><b>685. </b> Lt Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry that his proposal for a JIATF under military </p>
<p>command was a response to the fragmented UK effort at the time:</p>
<p>“… this was sort of desperate times and desperate measures. I’m not sure I would </p>
<p>necessarily propose the same solution today … But at the time, it seemed to be the </p>
<p>only way …” </p>
<p>387</p>
<p><b>686. </b> The ISG discussed Maj Gen Shirreff’s letter on 5 January 2007.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> Vice Admiral </p>
<p>Charles Style, Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Commitments), said the letter did not </p>
<p>reflect the “MOD corporate view”, but that he had some sympathy for the need for better </p>
<p>co-ordination and command: the southern Iraq Steering Group had met only five times </p>
<p>since May 2006, which was not good enough. Co-location at the BAS should solve much </p>
<p>of the problem, and the organisation needed to be tauter and more focused, but not </p>
<p>necessarily military-led. </p>
<p><b>687. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the ISF that Iraq was “entering a new phase, which </p>
<p>required a coherent structure under a single point of contact” and asked for the ISOG to </p>
<p>work on new structures. </p>
<p><b>688. </b> Sir Nigel reported to Mr Blair after the meeting that Maj Gen Shirreff’s views:</p>
<p>“… represent his frustration, shared by the MOD, that the civilian reconstruction </p>
<p>effort is uneven. We all agree that we need to make sure that we have an effectively </p>
<p>led Basra operation for the next year (at least).” </p>
<p>389</p>
<p><b>689. </b> Sir Nigel advised that co-location of HQ MND(SE), the PRT and the British </p>
<p>Embassy Office Basra at BAS from late February would help co-ordination enormously. </p>
<p>He had asked the departments concerned, led by PCRU, to advise on the right structure </p>
<p>for the British effort. The balance of opinion was that “it should be civilian-led, with strong </p>
<p>military input and follow-up”. </p>
<p><b>690. </b> Sir Nigel added that both DFID and the FCO were:</p>
<p>“… very fed up with Shirreff’s disparaging comments about the civilian effort </p>
<p>… But the fact is that there have been constant problems between the military </p>

<p> He looked forward to receiving advice from officials, and was “if necessary … </p>
<p>content that this should be delivered via a task force under military leadership”. </p>
<p><b>693. </b> At DOP(I) on 11 January, Ministers commented that “unbalanced reporting from the </p>
<p>military in theatre, disparaging the civilian effort” was “extremely unhelpful”.</p>
<p>392</p>
<p> It was not </p>
<p>the right time to create a new UK military-led structure when the UK was trying to put the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government in the lead. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> Mr Dinham, who attended the DOP(I) meeting, reported to DFID colleagues </p>
<p>that Mr Benn had spoken strongly against Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposal, arguing that </p>
<p>the UK should let existing, Iraqi-led organisations find their feet, accept that the </p>
<p>Iraq Government might not be that interested in our continued advice and help, and </p>
<p>recognise that the time for further UK bilateral pushes on reconstruction was coming to </p>
<p>an end.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> Mr Dinham added that ACM Stirrup had “agreed absolutely with everything </p>
<p>that Hilary [Benn] had said”. </p>
<p><b>695. </b> After receiving a further update from Basra on 12 January, Mr Blair wrote: “I still </p>

<p><b>696. </b> The meeting of the ISOG on the same day discussed the problems with civilian/</p>

<p> The ISOG agreed that there were a number of contributing </p>
<p>factors, “including personalities, departmental differences in duty of care, and too </p>
<p>infrequent meetings of the southern Iraq Steering Group”. There was a need to revise </p>
<p>structures, to balance the military effort with the civilian, to balance long- and short-term </p>
<p>efforts, and that “a military lead was not the right way to go at this time”. Dr Marsden </p>
<p>and Maj Gen Shirreff, supported by PCRU, were preparing recommendations on a </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>698. </b> ACM Stirrup said he did not agree with Maj Gen Shirreff’s proposals. It was too </p>

<p><b>700. </b> Maj Gen Shirreff told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… it was pretty clear to me that … looking over the period as a whole of my time </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>310</p>
<p><b>706. </b> At DOP(I) on 11 January 2007, Ministers commented that Internally Displaced </p>
<p>People (IDPs) were “principally an Iraqi Government responsibility – it should address </p>
<p>the violence and push forward reconciliation, and had the resources to address the </p>
<p>needs of the displaced”.</p>
<p>401</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>707. </b> Mr Benn wrote to Mr Blair on 24 January to provide an update on the situation: </p>
<p>“Displacement is causing a de facto geographical separation along sectarian lines, </p>
<p>as different ethnic groups move to areas in which they will be the majority. </p>
<p>“There is clearly a strong political dynamic to the situation and it is essential </p>
<p>that we address both the cause and the symptoms … We should press the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to address displacement issues as part of reconciliation, and to do </p>
<p>more itself to provide basic services to meet humanitarian needs. The picture is </p>
<p>unpalatable for the Iraqi Government … and indeed for the coalition (hence the </p>
<p>largely silent nature of the humanitarian crisis so far) …</p>
<p>“It is clear that while not letting the Iraqi Government off the hook, we must also </p>
<p>continue to respond to humanitarian needs in Iraq … ” </p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>708. </b> The first set of reports requested by Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 8 January </p>
<p>was passed to Mr Blair on 19 January.</p>
<p>403</p>
<p> It included a report from Dr Marsden on </p>
<p>developments in Basra.</p>
<p>404</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>709. </b> On the economy, Dr Marsden reported that the PRT “continues to focus on building </p>
<p>the capacity of the Provincial Council to identify priority investment, secure funding and </p>
<p>spend it in a transparent way”.</p>
<p><b>710. </b> DFID produced its first fortnightly update on reconstruction for Mr Blair on </p>
<p>25 January.</p>
<p>405</p>
<p> The paper, which he welcomed,</p>
<p>406</p>
<p> highlighted the need to persuade </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki to see reconstruction as a strategic issue:</p>
<p>“As the sectarian conflict in Iraq deepens, the coalition’s ability to buy consent </p>
<p>through quick impact reconstruction projects is waning. Alongside security, Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki’s Government must start providing basic services to help it win back </p>
<p>legitimacy from the militias and other armed groups …</p>
<p>“There are some signs that the Government is at last starting to grasp this agenda. </p>
<p>It has set up an economic committee … and a basic services committee … These </p>
<p>committees, with US support, aim to co-ordinate civil-military action to build local </p>

<p>support by delivering a reconstruction ‘peace dividend’. As yet, it is too early to judge </p>
<p>how successful this approach is likely to be.”</p>
<p><b>711. </b> DFID also reported that its aim in the run up to PIC in Basra was to help the </p>
<p>Provincial Council demonstrate that it was in charge and delivering services. The first </p>
<p>step was to secure Baghdad’s approval for Basra’s provincial strategy and associated </p>
<p>budget. The second was to get Baghdad to release the funds. The third was to help the </p>
<p>Council to communicate and deliver services. The US had adopted a similar focus. </p>
<p><b>712. </b> DFID’s second fortnightly update on 8 February expanded on the problems that </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government had in spending its money.</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> With oil prices topping US$60 per </p>
<p>barrel, the Iraqi Government was “cash rich”, but in the nine months to October 2006, it </p>
<p>had spent just 14 percent of the US$8.2bn allocated to public investment. The Ministry </p>
<p>of Oil had spent only one percent of the US$3.5bn allocated to it. DFID attributed the </p>
<p>underspend to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>poor security; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>poor planning by line ministries (and failure at the centre to demand plans); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>paralysis resulting from distrust between the Ministry of Finance (responsible for </p>
<p>disbursing and accounting for funds) and the Ministry of Planning (responsible </p>
<p>for reviewing plans and agreeing allocations). </p>
<p><b>713. </b> The Iraqi Government was considering setting up a National Council for </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Development, chaired by the Prime Minister, to accelerate </p>
<p>disbursement. The US was setting up a “Budget Execution Cell” in the Deputy Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s Office, which might increase disbursement in the short term but was unlikely </p>
<p>to be sustainable or to lead to significant improvements in services. DFID commented: </p>
<p>“In reality, there are few quick fixes to improving services in Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>714. </b> DFID also reported that the World Bank would open an office in Baghdad the </p>
<p>following week. It would have three full-time staff, “supported by DFID and protected </p>
<p>under the [UK] security umbrella”. As the coalition scaled back during 2007, the Bank </p>
<p>was likely to become the Iraqi Government’s “partner of choice”.</p>
<p><b>715. </b> On the Iraqi Government’s failure to disburse, Mr Blair commented, “we must get </p>
<p>this sorted out”; on Iraqi and US action to increase disbursement, he asked, “can’t we </p>
<p>provide the competence?”.</p>
<p>408</p>
<p><b>716. </b> Dr Marsden reported on 9 February that the centre of a “revamped” Better </p>
<p>Basra Action Plan would be a political plan for getting Basra to PIC and beyond. That </p>
<p>political plan would be supported by the other lines of operation (“military, police, </p>
<p>reconstruction etc”).</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>312</p>
<p><b>717. </b> Dr Marsden commented that it was important to acknowledge that the UK did not </p>
<p>have a sufficiently clear picture of Basrawi politics and their connection to Baghdadi </p>
<p>politics to be confident that any plan was credible.</p>
<p><b>718. </b> The MOD sent No.10 a report on the effects of Op SINBAD on 16 February, as </p>
<p>background material for Mr Blair’s statement to the House of Commons the following </p>
<p>week.</p>
<p>410</p>
<p> It concluded that “quick impact projects, short-term employment, and the </p>
<p>demolition of the Jameat police building” had improved consent levels and provided </p>
<p>an opportunity to make progress towards PIC. </p>
<p><b>719. </b> MND(SE) had spent US$77m on quick impact projects during Op SINBAD, </p>
<p>generating 25,000 short-term jobs. Those economic results had not been decisive; </p>
<p>many of the economic problems in southern Iraq stemmed from a lack of national and </p>
<p>Provincial Government capacity to prioritise and spend resources: </p>
<p>“The Provincial Council need to start leading and delivering projects for decisive </p>
<p>and sustained economic effect to be felt.”</p>
<p><b>720. </b> Mr Blair told the House of Commons on 21 February that the UK hoped that </p>
<p>Maysan could be transferred to full Iraqi control “in the next few months”, and Basra </p>
<p>in the second half of 2007.</p>
<p>411</p>
<p> The transfer of security responsibility would result in a </p>
<p>reduction in the level of UK forces from 7,100 to roughly 5,500. With the exception of </p>
<p>those troops which would remain at Basra Palace, UK forces would be based at the BAS </p>
<p>and be in a support role.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>721. </b> At the end of February, at Mr McDonald’s request, Dr Marsden produced a second </p>
<p>report on life for ordinary Iraqis in Basra.</p>
<p>412</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>722. </b> Drawing on over 100 interviews carried out in and around Basra by a member of </p>
<p>the PRT, poll data and other sources, she reported that life was “still grim”. Violence and </p>
<p>lawlessness were Basrawis’ overwhelming concern. Women were increasingly afraid to </p>
<p>leave the house, fearing kidnap, harassment or sexual violence. Many had been forced </p>
<p>to give up their jobs. The police were not trusted, with many interviewees telling stories </p>
<p>of intimidation, kidnapping and death squads. </p>
<p><b>723. </b> Support for the national Government and Prime Minister Maliki was high, support </p>
<p>for the Provincial Government low. Local politicians were seen as corrupt, unqualified </p>
<p>and linked to militias. No interviewee was able to give an example of something that </p>
<p>the Provincial Government had done to improve the lives of ordinary people. After </p>
<p>security, unemployment was the most commonly cited concern: polling indicated that </p>
<p>some 30 percent of Basrawis were employed. Few interviewees saw any improvements </p>
<p>in basic services: what work had been done was of poor quality. Most Basrawis had </p>

<p>electricity for between seven and 12 hours a day. Mains water was not suitable for </p>
<p>drinking; families that could afford it bought bottled water. Hospitals were dirty and poorly </p>
<p>staffed and equipped. Experienced doctors had left the country or been killed. Medicine </p>
<p>was expensive and in short supply. School standards were low. </p>
<p><b>724. </b> More positively, Dr Marsden reported that people still rejoiced in their greater </p>
<p>political freedom. Civil society was growing. The better off could enjoy new consumer </p>
<p>goods and the freedom to travel outside Iraq. There were signs of growth in the local </p>
<p>economy and public sector salaries had steadily increased. </p>
<p><b>725. </b> Dr Marsden sent Ms Aldred the third iteration of the Better Basra Action Plan </p>
<p>(BBP3) on 2 March.</p>
<p>413</p>
<p> In her covering letter, Dr Marsden advised that:</p>
<p>“For the first time we have got a fully integrated plan that has been drafted jointly </p>
<p>by the Consulate [British Embassy Office Basra], the PRT and MND(SE).” </p>
<p><b>726. </b> Dr Marsden also advised that BBP3 had also been discussed in detail with the </p>
<p>Head of the US Embassy Regional Office in Basra, who was content with it (though he </p>
<p>did not intend to clear it formally with Washington).</p>
<p><b>727. </b> BBP3 stated that it was “a comprehensive strategy for bringing Basra to the point </p>
<p>where it can transition to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC)”. It sought to ensure that all nine </p>
<p>“lines of operation” (political, security, rule of law, the judiciary, prisons, governance, </p>
<p>infrastructure, economic development and strategic communications) were integrated </p>
<p>under a single, overarching political strategy. BBP3 set out for each line of operation, key </p>
<p>benchmarks for March and June 2007, a detailed work plan, and an estimate of the cost </p>
<p>of implementing proposed new projects (which totalled some £21m in 2007/08). Delivery </p>
<p>of BBP3 would be “driven by” the southern Iraq Steering Group (SISG). </p>
<p><b>728. </b> The political and security lines of operation are described in Section 9.5 and the </p>
<p>rule of law, judiciary and prisons lines of operation in Section 12.1.</p>
<p><b>729. </b> On governance, BBP3 stated that the UK’s focus would continue to be to help the </p>
<p>Provincial Council to plan for, access and spend resources in a prioritised, transparent </p>
<p>and accountable way, and to develop an effective working relationship with Baghdad to </p>
<p>ensure that Basra got its share of the national budget. </p>
<p><b>730. </b> On infrastructure, the UK’s objective was to support the Provincial Council to </p>
<p>deliver better services using Iraqi resources, while continuing to use CERPs funding, </p>
<p>where appropriate, for “last mile service provision”.</p>
<p><b>731. </b> On economic development, the UK’s priorities were to boost job creation, lay </p>
<p>the foundations for more entrepreneurial activity and cross-border trade, support the </p>
<p>agricultural sector, and build the Provincial Government’s capacity to support economic </p>

<p>development. Activities included the establishment of a Basra Provincial Development </p>
<p>Agency and Development Fund.</p>
<p><b>732. </b> BBP3 stated that: </p>
<p>“We have to be realistic about what we can achieve. With the time and resources </p>
<p>available, we cannot address all Basra’s problems nor every falling in its </p>
<p>public administration and security forces. ‘Better Basra’ seeks to address those </p>
<p>identified as most critical to making progress against established transition </p>
<p>readiness indicators.” </p>
<p><b>733. </b> Mr Rob Tinline, Deputy Consul General in Basra from February 2007 to </p>
<p>February 2008 and one of the authors of BBP3, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… one of the great debates was: is it [BBP3] a British plan or is it a coalition plan? </p>
<p>And obviously with GOC MND(SE) saying, ‘Well, if it’s going to be mine, it’s going </p>
<p>to have to be a multi-national plan’, the Consul General saying, ‘Well, hang on, </p>
<p>we can’t clear this through the State Department, it will take forever’, what do </p>
<p>you do? I think I’m right in saying 90, 95 percent of the money that was spent </p>
<p>in Basra was American money. So if we wrote a British plan with five per cent of </p>
<p>the money, well …</p>
<p>“So how you wrote a plan was actually a ridiculously complicated thing, and we </p>
<p>ended up … with a sort of compromise where we’d shown it to the Americans and </p>
<p>they sort of said, ‘Yes, this is more or less right’, but it was a British plan … We </p>
<p>would never have got a multi-national plan for the South through the American </p>
<p>system.” </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>734. </b> A September 2008 review of the Basra PRT undertaken by the Stabilisation Unit, </p>
<p>the successor to the PCRU, offered a view on the Better Basra planning process at </p>
<p>this time:</p>
<p>“There is no [UK Government] wide strategy for Iraq … Although the Better Basra </p>
<p>Plans did go some way towards addressing this absence in 2006 and 2007, these </p>
<p>evolved in an incremental bottom-up way, hampered by a lack of strategic guidance </p>
<p>from Whitehall, and frequent change-over of personnel in theatre, and so eventually </p>
<p>fell by the wayside during the course of 2007.” </p>

<p><b>735. </b> Also on 2 March, Dr Marsden and Maj Gen Shaw wrote to Ms Aldred, in response </p>
<p>to Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s 25 January request for a note on civilian/military structures in </p>
<p>Basra.</p>
<p>416</p>
<p> They advised that:</p>
<p>“The profile of the security concerns in southern Iraq should not obscure the </p>
<p>fundamentally political nature of the end state we are pursuing. Military action must </p>
<p>be supportive of the political and civilian lines of operation.”</p>
<p><b>736. </b> Consistent with that assessment, the SISG, chaired by Dr Marsden, would oversee </p>
<p>delivery of the strategic objectives identified in BBP3. The SISG would take strategic </p>
<p>direction from and report to the ISG and the ISOG in London. </p>
<p><b>737. </b> Maj Gen Shaw told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… I had inherited a situation where the military commander and the Consul General </p>
<p>had joint ownership of the southern Iraq Steering Group. </p>
<p>“Well, I’ve always adhered to the principle that … if you can’t identify who is in </p>
<p>charge, you are in trouble, and joint ownership strikes me as a recipe for disaster </p>
<p>because you don’t know who is in charge. </p>
<p>“I said to the Consul General [Dr Marsden], ‘Listen, this is a political problem, not </p>
<p>a military one now. We’re supporting you in achieving a political end state for Iraq. </p>
<p>So you are in charge, I’m in support. What do you want me to do?’ …” </p>
<p>417</p>
<p><b>738. </b> Dr Howells briefed Ministers on the finalisation of BBP3 and the process for </p>
<p>implementing it at the 8 March meeting of DOP(I).</p>
<p>418</p>
<p> BBP3 would be circulated out of </p>
<p>committee the following day for Ministers “to note”. </p>
<p><b>739. </b> The 8 March meeting of DOP(I) also considered the deteriorating humanitarian </p>

<p> The Government’s response to the humanitarian situation is </p>
<p>addressed later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>740. </b> A DFID official advised Mr Benn on 13 March that Mr Tinline (the Deputy Consul </p>
<p>General) would “double-hat” as the PRT Team Leader from 1 April.</p>
<p>420</p>
<p> That should ensure </p>
<p>better co-ordination between civilian and military elements. PCRU officials had covered </p>
<p>the post since Mr Etherington’s departure in January.</p>
<p><b>741. </b> Mr Tinline told the Inquiry that, during his time in Iraq, the British Embassy Office </p>

<p><b>742. </b> Mr Benn was also advised that the final component of DFID’s IISP, the Basra </p>
<p>water towers, should be completed in October; that would conclude DFID’s direct </p>
<p>infrastructure work. </p>
<p><b>743. </b> Maysan transferred to PIC on 18 April. Maysan was the third province within </p>
<p>MND(SE) to transfer, Muthanna and Dhi Qar having done so in July and September </p>
<p>2006 respectively. This left Basra as the only province for which the UK retained </p>
<p>security responsibility. </p>
<p><b>744. </b> Section 9.5 describes the UK’s focus in early 2007 on encouraging the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to do more to promote reconciliation in Iraq, against a background of </p>
<p>continuing sectarian violence. The UK saw a Hydrocarbons Law as one element of an </p>
<p>effective reconciliation process. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> Mr Richard Jones, Dr Marsden’s successor as the British Consul General in Basra, </p>
<p>reported on 19 April that “out of the blue”, a demonstration against Governor Waili </p>
<p>“throws open the political future of Basra”.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> Mr Jones assessed that the demonstration </p>
<p>had been motivated in large part by “a straight power struggle” in Basra drawing on </p>
<p>concerns over corruption, and in part by national politics.</p>
<p><b>746. </b> Mr Robert Tinline, Acting Consul General in Basra, reported on 26 April that the </p>
<p>ongoing power struggle in Basra, centred on Governor Waili, was diverting energy </p>
<p>from other activity.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p> Several key meetings on development had been postponed. If the </p>
<p>uncertainty dragged on, the UK would begin to lose momentum on key strands of work. </p>
<p><b>747. </b> Mr Browne briefed Cabinet on 3 May that the political vacuum in Basra threatened </p>
<p>to undermine UK efforts and the gains made by Op SINBAD.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> Governor Waili was </p>
<p>assailed on all sides and was ineffective. Militias were vying for political power. </p>
<p><b>748. </b> On the same day, members of the international community gathered in Sharm </p>
<p>el-Sheikh, Egypt, to launch the International Compact with Iraq.</p>
<p>425</p>
<p> It was formally </p>
<p>launched by Prime Minister Maliki and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The UN </p>
<p>described the Compact as:</p>
<p>“… a five-year national plan that includes benchmarks and mutual commitments </p>
<p>from both Iraq and the international community, all with the aim of helping Iraq on the </p>
<p>path towards peace, sound governance and economic reconstruction.”</p>
<p><b>749. </b> At the launch, Mrs Beckett announced that the UK would spend at least an </p>
<p>additional £100m on rebuilding Iraq.</p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>317</p>
<p><b>750. </b> A DFID official advised Mr Benn that that commitment, added to the </p>
<p>£544m pledged at the Madrid Donors Conference in October 2003 and the </p>
<p>£100m announced by Mr Brown in November 2006 (when it had been thought the </p>
<p>launch of the Compact was imminent), brought the UK’s total “Iraq reconstruction </p>
<p>pledge” to £744m.</p>
<p>427</p>
<p> £660m of that had already been spent and £730m was forecast </p>
<p>to be spent by the end of 2008. The pledge therefore required only very modest </p>
<p>expenditure on Iraq between the end of 2008 and 2012 (the end of the Compact period).</p>
<p><b>The International Compact with Iraq, May 2007</b></p>
<p>The International Compact with Iraq was formally launched by Prime Minister Maliki and </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 3 May 2007.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Preparatory work on the Compact began in early 2006. The UK hoped that the Compact </p>
<p>would draw in international support (with the UN and World Bank at the centre) to help </p>
<p>Iraq deliver its National Development Strategy.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> Delivery of residual Madrid Donor </p>
<p>Conference pledges and non-Paris Club debt relief would complement the Compact. </p>
<p>The UK progressively lowered its expectations. Mr McDonald reported to ISOG on </p>
<p>3 November 2006 that there was a “clash of objectives”, with Iraq asking for funding and </p>
<p>the international community requesting “evidence of progress”.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> ISOG agreed the UK </p>
<p>should focus its effort on the period after the launch, to ensure “robust implementation”. </p>
<p>Later that month, a DFID official advised Mr Benn that the Compact was likely to have </p>
<p>“very little developmental value”.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> It did not reflect Iraq’s slide into sectarian conflict, and </p>
<p>Iraqi ownership of and commitment to reform was limited. </p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Barham Salih discussed the launch of the Compact with </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald on 12 April 2007.</p>
<p>432</p>
<p> Mr Salih requested the “UK’s leadership” in urging </p>
<p>Europe to commit resources to Iraq over the next four to five years. Sir Nigel agreed. </p>
<p>Mr Salih also asked the UK to lobby European partners to agree to write off 100 percent </p>
<p>of Iraqi debt. </p>
<p>Mr Blair was advised the following day that departments were considering what more </p>
<p>the UK and other European countries could do, but that encouraging investment in the </p>
<p>current security climate and in the absence of progress on the reconciliation agenda </p>
<p>would be difficult.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>318</p>
<p><b>752. </b> Mr Jones reported on 23 May that he understood that the Iraqi Minister of Finance </p>
<p>had instructed the Iraqi Central Bank to freeze all development funds in its Basra </p>
<p>accounts until the conflict between Governor Waili and the Provincial Council had </p>
<p>been resolved.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> He had done so because Governor Waili had written to the Central </p>
<p>Bank requesting that those funds be transferred from both his own and the Provincial </p>
<p>Government’s accounts to another, unspecified, bank account. The Provincial Council </p>
<p>had protested. Mr Jones commented that the UK had been working for months to </p>
<p>persuade Baghdad to provide the finance that Basra deserved for development work. </p>
<p>The freeze was another incentive to resolve the political impasse as soon as possible. </p>
<p><b>753. </b> Mr Jones also reported that:</p>
<p>“All of our contacts speak of deterioration in the security situation … The electricity </p>
<p>supply has also deteriorated … The lack of power has stopped the electric water </p>
<p>pumps from working. Potable water is scarce and 70 percent of the city is without </p>
<p>a mains supply (worst affected are poorer areas such as the Shia flats).”</p>
<p><b>754. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Jones characterised the poor relations between </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki and Governor Waili, and between Governor Waili and the </p>
<p>Provincial Council, as a challenge to UK engagement in Basra but not a constraint.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>755. </b> On 12 May, Mr Brown’s Principal Private Secretary commissioned advice for </p>
<p>Mr Brown on how the UK might increase support for economic development and </p>
<p>reconstruction in Iraq and, in particular, Basra.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>756. </b> A Treasury official provided that advice on 24 May.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> Economic growth and </p>
<p>job creation had a vital part to play in building sustainable peace and stability and </p>
<p>reconciling Iraq’s divided communities. The three priorities which would do most to </p>
<p>boost economic growth were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building on existing macroeconomic stability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>expanding and improving the efficiency of the oil industry. That required a </p>
<p>Hydrocarbons Law, improved security and an integrated energy strategy </p>
<p>covering investment and reform. </p>
<p><b>757. </b> The UK could also consider shorter-term initiatives (although those would become </p>
<p>harder to implement after the drawdown of UK forces), including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further initiatives on the lines of Op SINBAD; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>initiatives which aimed to revitalise Iraqi industry.</p>

<p><b>758. </b> The official also advised that there was a limit to the number of jobs that could be </p>
<p>created in the short to medium term and that “whilst more jobs may help to divert some </p>
<p>energies away from conflict, it will only be a small contributory factor to reducing the </p>
<p>violence, whose root causes are multifaceted”.</p>
<p><b>759. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Browne made a joint visit to Baghdad on 11 June and met </p>
<p>a number of key individuals, including Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> Mr Brown told Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki that:</p>
<p>“… the UK was keen to support the Prime Minister on changes to the Constitution, </p>
<p>new laws and reforms and economic infrastructure and support.”</p>

<p><b>761. </b> The International Organization for Migration (IOM) reported that the violence </p>
<p>caused hundreds of thousands</p>
<p> </p>
<p>of families to flee their homes; displacement peaked </p>
<p>in June 2006 when over 16,000 families fled their homes.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p><b>762. </b> A No.10 official sent Mr Blair a UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) </p>
<p>update on the situation on 1 December 2006.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> UNHCR advised that approximately </p>
<p>425,000 Iraqi citizens had been internally displaced since the Samarra bombing. In </p>
<p>total, there were at least 1.6m Iraqi citizens displaced within Iraq and between 1.6m and </p>
<p>1.8m Iraqi refugees in the region; there were also 50,000 refugees from other countries </p>
<p>in Iraq. The needs of Internally Displaced People (IDPs), returnees, refugees and their </p>
<p>host communities were “dramatic and to a large extent unmet”. </p>
<p><b>763. </b> On 11 January 2007, the British Embassy Baghdad reported that UNHCR had </p>
<p>launched an appeal for US$60m to meet the humanitarian needs of Iraqi refugees </p>
<p>and IDPs in 2007.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> UNHCR estimated that, of the 1.7m IDPs in Iraq, one million had </p>
<p>been displaced before 2003 and up to 490,000 since the Samarra bombing. Obtaining </p>
<p>accurate figures was difficult as many IDPs were living with extended family or not </p>
<p>registering with the Government. UNHCR expected that it would be difficult to raise </p>
<p>funds from donors, given Iraq’s budget surplus. </p>
<p><b>764. </b> At the 11 January meeting of DOP(I), Ministers commented that IDPs were </p>
<p>“principally an Iraqi Government responsibility – it should address the violence and push </p>
<p>forward reconciliation, and had the resources to address the needs of the displaced”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>320</p>
<p><b>765. </b> Mr Dinham, who attended the DOP(I) meeting, reported to DFID colleagues that </p>
<p>Mr Benn had said that he would be urging the UN to use unspent donor funds to meet </p>
<p>the UNHCR appeal.</p>
<p>444</p>
<p> Mr Browne had favoured pressing the Iraqi Government to </p>
<p>contribute to the UNHCR appeal; this was a problem for which the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>was responsible and there was no shortage of Iraqi money. </p>
<p><b>766. </b> The 11 January report from the British Embassy Baghdad was passed to Mr Blair </p>
<p>on 12 January.</p>
<p>445</p>
<p> A No.10 official commented on the report: “We are encouraging the </p>
<p>GoI [Iraqi Government] to get its act together, given that these are its citizens.” </p>
<p><b>767. </b> Mr Benn wrote to Mr Blair on 24 January, providing an update on the humanitarian </p>
<p>situation in Iraq:</p>
<p>“Displacement is causing a de facto geographical separation along sectarian lines, </p>
<p>as different ethnic groups move to areas in which they will be the majority.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“There is clearly a strong political dynamic to the situation and it is essential </p>
<p>that we address both the cause and the symptoms … We should press the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government to address displacement issues as part of reconciliation, and to do </p>
<p>more itself to provide basic services to meet humanitarian needs. The picture is </p>
<p>unpalatable for the Iraqi government … and indeed for the coalition (hence the </p>
<p>largely silent nature of the humanitarian crisis so far) …</p>
<p>“It is clear that while not letting the Iraqi Government off the hook, we must also </p>
<p>continue to respond to humanitarian needs in Iraq …” </p>
<p>446</p>
<p><b>768. </b> Mr Benn advised that he had therefore decided to contribute £4m to the </p>
<p>International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p><b>769. </b> On 23 February, a No.10 official advised Mr Blair that there had been little </p>
<p>improvement in the humanitarian situation, and that the Iraqi Government remained </p>
<p>“largely silent” on the issue.</p>
<p>447</p>
<p> The Iraqi Ministry of Displacement and Migration was </p>
<p>trying to help but it had little capacity to respond; its budget was “woefully inadequate”. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the international community was stepping up its response. DFID continued </p>
<p>to look at ways of unlocking unspent donor funding. </p>

<p>321</p>
<p><b>771. </b> In a briefing paper for the meeting, DFID reported that the number of people </p>
<p>displaced since the Samarra bombing had risen to 650,000.</p>
<p>449</p>
<p> UNHCR estimated that </p>
<p>the total number of IDPs in Iraq could rise to 2.3m by the end of 2007. The number of </p>
<p>Iraqi refugees in the region had risen from 1.8m to over 2m. </p>
<p><b>772. </b> The trend was of “increasing polarisation” along sectarian and geographical </p>
<p>lines, which would have a considerable impact on the political landscape and made </p>
<p>a national response more complex. In contrast to previous displacements, the moves </p>
<p>were permanent. </p>
<p><b>773. </b> In Iraq, security had compromised delivery mechanisms, and weak Iraqi public </p>
<p>services had not been able to keep up with demand. The Iraqi Government had failed </p>
<p>to recognise that this was a strategic issue with long-term political consequences. There </p>
<p>was an increasing risk that militias were being seen by Iraqi communities as guarantors </p>
<p>of local security. The UK’s objective remained to build Iraqi capacity to provide security </p>
<p>and basic services; however:</p>
<p>“It will take years for Iraq to undertake the necessary reforms and develop the </p>
<p>systems for effective service delivery. There is therefore a humanitarian imperative </p>
<p>for the international community to assist in the short term.” </p>
<p><b>774. </b> DFID stated that it would contribute a further £5m to humanitarian relief operations </p>
<p>in Iraq and the region (bringing DFID’s total contribution to the crisis for 2007 to £9m). </p>
<p><b>775. </b> Other major contributions were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Japan had pledged US$104m;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the EC had pledged €20m; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US had pledged US$23m. </p>
<p><b>776. </b> Introducing the DFID paper at the DOP(I) meeting, Mr Benn said that Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki remained more focused on security and his own political concerns, </p>
<p>but the UK continued to push the Iraqi Government to allocate adequate resources </p>
<p>to the problem.</p>
<p>450</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>777. </b> The DOP(I) meeting concluded that the UK should lobby the Iraqi Government, </p>
<p>UN, ICRC and the IOM to step up their actions to address the crisis. </p>
<p><b>778. </b> DFID made further contributions to the international humanitarian response later </p>
<p>in March and in November, bringing the UK’s total contribution for 2007 to £15m.</p>
<p>451</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>779. </b> On 18 April, a No.10 official advised Mr Blair that the UN assessed that the refugee </p>

<p>US$25m to the UN, but that amount was “fairly minimal, given the resources required, </p>
<p>and that it has primary responsibility for the well-being of Iraq’s citizens”.</p>
<p><b>780. </b> The IOM’s review of displacement in Iraq in 2007 reported that displacement had </p>
<p>slowed over the course of the year, due to improved security in some areas and the </p>
<p>“sectarian homogenization” of previously mixed neighbourhoods: “in other words, there </p>
<p>were fewer and fewer people to force out”.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> Conditions continued to deteriorate for the </p>
<p>2.4m IDPs in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> On 12 March 2008, a DFID official advised Mr Douglas Alexander, who had </p>
<p>succeeded Mr Benn as International Development Secretary, that the UN estimated that </p>
<p>there were now 2.2m IDPs in Iraq.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> The Iraqi Government had recently announced </p>
<p>a US$40m contribution to the UN’s US$265m Consolidated Appeal (which had been </p>
<p>launched in February), but was doing little to support vulnerable people inside Iraq. </p>
<p><b>782. </b> DFID contributed a further £29m to the international humanitarian response </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>Reconstruction under Mr Gordon Brown’s Premiership</b></p>
<p><b>784. </b> Mr Gordon Brown took office as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007. He appointed </p>
<p>Mr Douglas Alexander as Development Secretary, replacing Mr Benn, and Mr David </p>
<p>Miliband as Foreign Secretary, replacing Mrs Beckett. Mr Des Browne remained </p>
<p>Defence Secretary. </p>
<p><b>785. </b> The most pressing issues facing the UK in Iraq remained the timing of </p>
<p>the withdrawal of UK forces from Basra Palace, and Basra’s transition to PIC </p>
<p>(see Section 9.6). </p>
<p><b>786. </b> The introductory briefing produced by DFID officials for Mr Alexander described </p>
<p>Iraq as a wealthy country (with oil revenues of US$37bn in the current year) which was </p>
<p>unable to spend or manage its resources effectively to deliver public services because </p>
<p>of poor security, poor political leadership and a lack of technical ability.</p>
<p>457</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>787. </b> DFID’s priority was to build the capacity of the Iraqi Government to deliver public </p>
<p>services, by providing high-level policy and technical advice in Baghdad on economic </p>
<p>reform. DFID was also looking at options to provide further support for reconciliation, </p>
<p>and providing humanitarian assistance to the four million people displaced in Iraq and </p>
<p>neighbouring countries. </p>
<p><b>788. </b> In Basra, DFID’s power and water infrastructure programmes would end in late </p>
<p>2007, having delivered improved access to water for over one million people and added </p>
<p>or secured enough power to provide 700,000 people with 24-hour electricity. </p>
<p><b>789. </b> DFID was also seeking to promote economic growth and private sector investment </p>
<p>in Basra by supporting:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of a Basra Development Commission (BDC); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of a Basra Investment Promotion Agency (BIPA); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of a Basra Development Fund; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>those institutions’ priorities, including a Basra Economic Development Strategy, </p>
<p>investor visits and youth employment initiatives. </p>
<p><b>790. </b> Mr Alexander’s briefing for a trilateral meeting with Mr Miliband and Mr Browne </p>
<p>in early July highlighted the constraints on reconstruction, including the politicisation </p>
<p>of ministries and deteriorating security:</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Finance does not function effectively and is subject, like many </p>
<p>Ministries, to partisan control. Combined with an almost total lack of transparency, </p>
<p>the Ministry is able to withhold funding to certain ministries. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>“We are increasingly unable to visit key ministries in Baghdad … We need to be </p>
<p>realistic about what is achievable.” </p>
<p>458</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>791. </b> The briefing also stated that DFID’s budget for Iraq for 2007/08 was £30m, down </p>
<p>from £45m in 2006/07. Officials anticipated a “further tapering” over the next few years, </p>
<p>although that had not yet been announced. </p>
<p><b>792. </b> Mr Brown spoke to Prime Minister Maliki on 5 July.</p>
<p>459</p>
<p> On Basra, Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki said that he hoped it would be possible to reduce the burden on UK </p>
<p>forces and for Iraqi forces to take the lead within three months. </p>
<p><b>793. </b> Mr Brown said that he would like to discuss the scope for economic initiatives, </p>
<p>and promised to send suggestions in the next few days. No.10 asked DFID for a draft </p>

<p>establishing security;</p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>325</p>
<p><b>799. </b> In advance of the meeting, FCO and MOD officials produced a joint paper </p>
<p>setting out the latest “assessments and plans on security transition and the associated </p>
<p>re-posturing and drawdown of UK troops in Basra” (see Section 9.6).</p>
<p>462</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>800. </b> The FCO and MOD assessed that the UK had achieved “only some” of its </p>
<p>objectives in Iraq. Iraq had “the forms of democracy” but the constituent parts of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government were not working together to a genuine national unity agenda and there </p>
<p>was no commitment to reconciliation. In that context, the paper reported that:</p>
<p>“Ministers treat their Ministries as party and personal fiefdoms, sources of funds </p>
<p>and patronage. The writ of central Government runs weakly outside the Baghdad </p>
<p>International Zone.” </p>
<p><b>801. </b> The FCO and MOD set out the process by which judgements were reached (by </p>
<p>MNF commanders and Prime Minister Maliki) on whether provinces were ready for </p>
<p>PIC, and an assessment of Basra’s progress against the four PIC conditions (security </p>
<p>conditions and threat levels, ISF capacity, the Governor’s capacity to take responsibility </p>
<p>for security, and the coalition’s ability to re-intervene if necessary). The UK was also </p>
<p>monitoring progress against an additional condition, which it judged to be important:</p>
<p>“capability of the provincial authorities to direct reconstruction, and to spend their </p>
<p>budgets wisely and accountably”.</p>
<p><b>802. </b> The last UK military base in Basra city was the Basra Palace Compound (BPC), </p>
<p>which the paper described as “the most heavily mortared and rocketed place in Iraq”. </p>
<p>The UK planned to hand over the BPC to the Iraqi authorities, and withdraw UK troops </p>
<p>based there to Basra Air Station (BAS), on 31 August. That would represent the “de facto </p>
<p>handover of responsibility” to the Iraqi authorities, as UK forces would only be able to </p>
<p>intervene from BAS “in extremis”. </p>
<p><b>803. </b> PIC should take place as soon after the handover of the BPC as possible: a long </p>
<p>gap would place the UK in a difficult position, “responsible for security in Basra city, but </p>
<p>unable to deliver it except at high risk”. </p>
<p><b>804. </b> The FCO and MOD advised that the UK should stick to its transition strategy, </p>
<p>including PIC in Basra in the autumn. </p>
<p><b>805. </b> Looking ahead to Basra after PIC, the FCO and MOD advised: </p>
<p>“Our planning should assume that the UK civilian presence in Basra will have to </p>
<p>be wound up shortly before the removal of the UK military envelope which enables </p>
<p>it to operate (though if the US were to decide to move a military presence of their </p>
<p>own to Basra Air Station, and to retain a US civilian presence, we could expect US </p>
<p>pressure for us to maintain some sort of ongoing commitment to the Basra Provincial </p>
<p>Reconstruction Team).”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>326</p>
<p><b>806. </b> The FCO and MOD argued for “a long-term UK commitment in Iraq”, which would </p>
<p>include influencing the Iraqi Government and supporting the long-term development of </p>
<p>its capacity, in particular through the provision of advice to ministries in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>807. </b> The 19 July meeting of NSID(OD) was cancelled and not reinstated.</p>
<p>463</p>
<p><b>808. </b> On 11 July, a DFID official sent Mr Simon McDonald, Mr Brown’s Foreign Policy </p>
<p>Adviser, a draft letter for Mr Brown to send to Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>809. </b> The draft letter reflected guidance from Mr Alexander that the UK should be </p>
<p>realistic about the role of economic reform and only propose initiatives that had a good </p>
<p>chance of being realised.</p>
<p>465</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>810. </b> Mr McDonald passed the draft letter to Mr Brown on 27 July, after consulting the </p>
<p>FCO and the British Embassy Baghdad.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> Mr McDonald commented that the approach </p>
<p>set out in the draft letter was:</p>
<p>“… sensible and realistic but not particularly ambitious … But the Embassy argue </p>
<p>that, taking into account the security situation and the lack of political will … this is </p>
<p>as much as we would be able to get Maliki to consider.” </p>
<p><b>811. </b> Mr Brown wrote to Prime Minister Maliki on 29 July.</p>
<p>467</p>
<p> While establishing security </p>
<p>remained the “abiding priority”, it was vital that people were given a stake in their future. </p>
<p>Mr Brown suggested that the UK could help the Iraqi Government to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>secure a new IMF Stand By Arrangement by the end of 2007; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>develop an integrated energy strategy, alongside the World Bank;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reform the banking sector, also alongside the World Bank;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthen financial management, by continuing to fund an economic reform </p>
<p>team; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>establish the BIPA to identify and promote investment opportunities throughout </p>
<p>the province. The UK had allocated funds to help establish the Agency. If </p>
<p>successful, it could be replicated in other Provinces and inform the creation of a </p>
<p>National Investment Commission.</p>
<p><b>812. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… if you can show people that their economic prosperity is possible, then the risks </p>
<p>of returning to violence are seen by people to be too great to put at risk something </p>
<p>that they were now about to enjoy. So I wanted to show in Basra … that the chance </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>815. </b> Mr Asquith reported that Prime Minister Maliki warmly welcomed Mr Brown’s letter, </p>
<p>which was in line with his desire to deepen co-operation with the UK on issues other </p>
<p>than security and with his own Government’s focus on economic development. Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki said that he would approve a request from the Basra Provincial Council </p>
<p>to establish the BIPA. </p>
<p><b>816. </b> Prime Minister Maliki said that he was also interested in bigger projects in the </p>
<p>Basra region which were national in scope such as the Grand Port project in the oil </p>
<p>sector, which would attract large-scale international investment. </p>
<p><b>817. </b> Prime Minister Maliki also advised that the “troublesome” Governor Waili had been </p>

<p>“… the cease-fire for a month on 13 August worked straight away. There was an </p>
<p>immediate falling away of attacks, and it then carried on. It went beyond the month </p>
<p>and it became effectively a permanent feature. So it was remarkably successful.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>328</p>
<p><b>821. </b> Mr Jon Day, MOD Director General (Security Policy), told the Inquiry that the </p>
<p>cease-fire not only brought a reduction in attacks on coalition forces in Basra:</p>
<p><b>“</b>But the critical strategic dividend, as far as we were concerned, was that the overall </p>
<p>decline in violence helped encourage the resurgence of real political activity … </p>
<p>“Another consequence, which … was felt to be quite important by those on the </p>
<p>ground at the time … is that prior to the understandings, coalition-sponsored </p>
<p>reconstruction work in Basra had almost come to a stop. The understandings </p>
<p>reduced the threat to military and civilian workers and that allowed work on projects </p>
<p>such as the Basra Children’s Hospital to start up again and to enable us to plan to </p>
<p>do more work elsewhere in Basra.” </p>
<p>473</p>
<p><b>822. </b> Section 9.6 describes negotiations between the UK and JAM1.</p>
<p><b>823. </b> Mr Asquith’s 16 August valedictory letter to Mr Miliband focused on security and the </p>
<p>political process, but also reflected on the UK’s role in reconstruction:</p>
<p>“Outside the military contribution, our favoured route has been through providing </p>
<p>expertise. That will remain necessary, but insufficient. The Iraqis prize lasting </p>
<p>legacies … We should consider with an open mind taking a leaf out of the Japanese </p>
<p>book, making use of some of the savings on the defence side to establish a joint or </p>
<p>soft loan financial development fund for specific projects in the education or health </p>
<p>sectors. Easier, and more realistic, would be to establish a large trust fund for a </p>
<p>permanent scholarship scheme to supplement Chevening. Or we should switch our </p>
<p>… focus to an area where we can operate – namely the Kurdish region which we </p>
<p>have consistently and puzzlingly ignored.” </p>

<p>There was probably only a very narrow window of opportunity to reinforce the success </p>

<p>“When he [Mr Brown] came in October 2007, to be honest, we were doing quite a </p>
<p>few of those things, or struggling away at trying to do a lot of those economic things. </p>
<p>Things like the Basra Investment Promotion Agency was something we would have </p>
<p>been working on well before he came and visited. Likewise trying to establish the </p>
<p>Basra Development Fund, some discussions around Iraq/Kuwait borders. But … </p>
<p>there just wasn’t necessarily the environment to be able to do that or the impetus </p>
<p>behind it, and I think he came and gave far more impetus to that. We put more </p>
<p>resources towards it, and … with the … changing security in the following months, </p>
<p>it gave more opportunity to then really deliver some results on the ground.” </p>
<p>485</p>
<p><b>837. </b> Ms Reid also told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Each successive visit from Ministers, from Prime Ministers … gave us more clarity, </p>
<p>certainly in terms of timelines.</p>
<p>“When I arrived [in August 2007], there was no real sense of [whether] the PRT </p>

<p>Letter Maliki to Brown, 7 October 2007, [untitled]. </p>
<p>488 </p>
<p>Minute Cabinet Office [junior official] to Prime Minister, 5 October 2007, ‘NSID(OD) Iraq Meeting – </p>
<p>Steering Brief: Monday 8 October 09:30’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>332</p>
<p><b>840. </b> At the meeting, Mr Brown said that there had been little progress on political </p>
<p>reconciliation but economic reconstruction in Basra was making better progress, largely </p>
<p>as a result of the improved security environment.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>841. </b> According to Sir John Scarlett’s own account of the meeting, Mr Brown:</p>
<p>“… spoke very strongly on the ceasefire in Basra and the dramatic improvement </p>
<p>in the security situation. This represented a huge opportunity.” </p>
<p>490</p>
<p><b>842. </b> On the afternoon of 8 October, Mr Brown told the House of Commons that the UK </p>
<p>expected to establish PIC in Basra in the next two months.</p>
<p>491</p>
<p> The UK planned to reduce </p>
<p>the number of UK troops in southern Iraq from spring 2008 to around 2,500. </p>
<p><b>843. </b> Initial guidance on a new format and process for producing DFID Country </p>
<p>Assistance Plans (CAPs) was circulated to DFID officials on 11 October.</p>
<p>492</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>844. </b> Ms Barbara Hendrie, DFID Deputy Director Iraq, wrote to DFID Heads of </p>
<p>Department on the same day:</p>
<p>“We have only ever had a ‘rough and ready’ version of an I-CAP [Interim Country </p>
<p>Assistance Plan] for the Iraq programme, which is now well out of date. Minouche </p>
<p>[Dr Shafik] asked the team this summer to think of producing a ‘very light touch’ </p>
<p>CAP, as the programme is over £20m. We’ve been in the process of looking at </p>
<p>the CAP guidance and trying to adapt it to the Iraq context (not easy!)” </p>
<p>493</p>
<p>“Hence, the revisions to the CAP process are very welcome …”</p>
<p><b>845. </b> The following day, Ms Hendrie wrote to a junior DFID official:</p>
<p>“It seems pretty clear that we’re going to need to do some form of strategy </p>
<p>document/CAP … it would be great … for you to hold the pen on this.” </p>
<p>494</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>846. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that work on a new CAP was taken forward. </p>
<p><b>847. </b> DFID told the Inquiry that the I-CAP produced in February 2004 was not </p>
<p>superseded until February 2011, when DFID Iraq published its ‘Operational Plan </p>
<p>2011-2012’.</p>
<p>495</p>
<p> DFID closed its Iraq programme in March 2012.</p>

<p>333</p>
<p><b>848. </b> DFID also told the Inquiry that it decided not to revise the I-CAP because of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the consistency in DFID “strategic priorities” and funding between 2005 </p>
<p>and 2007;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the high turnover of Heads of DFID Baghdad; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>from 2007, DFID’s move away from producing published CAPs (under </p>
<p>Mr Douglas Alexander).</p>
<p><b>849. </b> A Cabinet Office official advised Mr Brown on 12 October that Governor Waili’s </p>
<p>appeal against his dismissal from post had been successful.</p>
<p>496</p>
<p> The UK planned to </p>
<p>“resume low-key co-operation with him in the interests of moving beyond the political </p>
<p>stand-off in Basra” while the Iraqi Government took other steps towards his dismissal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The security situation in Basra remained “relatively calm”.</p>
<p><b>850. </b> Major General Graham Binns, GOC MND(SE), reported on 18 October that </p>
<p>Gen Petraeus had agreed Lt Gen Odierno’s recommendation of PIC for Basra in </p>
<p>December.</p>
<p>497</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>851. </b> In a message to the FCO in London on 23 October, Mr Christopher Prentice, </p>
<p>British Ambassador to Iraq, set out some of the implications of Mr Brown’s 8 October </p>
<p>statement.</p>
<p>498</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>852. </b> Mr Prentice argued that given the UK’s strategic interests and the scale and cost </p>
<p>of its commitment to Iraq so far, “we [the UK] need to accept now that we are in this for </p>
<p>some years to come”. </p>
<p><b>853. </b> The UK would be judged by the progress Basra made following PIC. By the end </p>
<p>of 2008, key Basra economic initiatives would only just have started and would need </p>
<p>continuing UK support. There was also a case for the UK “planning a last high profile </p>
<p>project as visible proof for Basrawis of our continuing support and as a lasting UK </p>
<p>legacy”. </p>
<p><b>854. </b> Mr Prentice reported that the UK was already increasing its emphasis on the </p>
<p>“civilian development agenda”. In the longer term, DFID “understandably wish to </p>
<p>normalise its role in a wealthy oil-producing country i.e. close its programme”. It </p>
<p>would be right to do so – but only when the “whole Iraq project” was on track. Unless </p>
<p>the UK was “surprised by success”, 2009 was likely to be too early to begin to close </p>
<p>the programme. </p>
<p><b>855. </b> The conditions might be favourable by 2009 to re-establish a UK Trade and </p>
<p>Industry presence in Basra “to pursue the huge commercial opportunities there will </p>
<p>eventually be there”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>334</p>
<p><b>856. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq between 29 October and 2 November.</p>
<p>499</p>
<p> He reported to </p>
<p>Mr Brown that it had been “markedly the most encouraging of my seven visits to Basra”. </p>
<p>He continued:</p>
<p>“So progress there has been, but, as you well know, the space we have achieved is </p>
<p>fragile and temporary. We have a window of opportunity in Basra and it is vital that </p>
<p>both we and the Iraqis apply political and economic leadership to make the most of it.” </p>
<p><b>857. </b> Mr Browne had impressed upon everyone he met in Iraq the need to announce </p>
<p>“a detailed economic plan for Basra” to coincide with PIC in December. </p>
<p><b>858. </b> Mr Browne concluded: “If we are to deliver, and we must, this will need dedicated </p>
<p>and energetic UK resource in London, Basra and Baghdad.” </p>
<p><b>859. </b> Mr Browne’s visit prompted Maj Gen Binns to evaluate progress made since the </p>
<p>summer.</p>
<p>500</p>
<p> His 1 November weekly report advised that: </p>
<p>“We are now subject to far fewer attacks, are constructively engaged with the </p>
<p>Governor … and the Provincial Council, we transit through Basra in force … without </p>
<p>opposition … and are looking to make more of the large amount of reconstruction </p>
<p>work we are responsible for (through US resources) in Basra through good </p>
<p>information and media operations.”</p>
<p><b>860. </b> Mr Alexander sent Mr Brown an update on the Basra economic initiatives on </p>
<p>9 November.</p>
<p>501</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>861. </b> Mr Alexander advised that DFID had identified several UK business leaders willing </p>
<p>to help drive forward the work of the BDC, including Mr Michael Wareing, International </p>
<p>CEO of KPMG. The BDC (which Mr Alexander described as the “centrepiece” of the </p>
<p>Basra economic initiatives) would bring together national, regional and international </p>
<p>business knowledge to provide strategic advice to the Iraqi authorities on investment </p>
<p>and growth for Basra’s economy. DFID was planning a launch event for the BDC to </p>
<p>coincide with PIC in Basra. </p>
<p><b>862. </b> Mr Alexander agreed with Mr Browne’s assessment (in his 2 November letter to </p>
<p>Mr Brown) that dedicated UK resources were required to move the economic initiatives </p>
<p>forward. DFID had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployed a Project Manager to the Basra PRT to work on economic initiatives; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-orientated DFID’s Economic and Governance team in the PRT to support </p>
<p>the initiatives, and provided £750,000 to establish the BIPA and the Basra </p>
<p>Development Fund. </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>335</p>
<p><b>863. </b> DFID continued to support other initiatives that would promote growth and </p>
<p>investment in Basra, including Basra International Airport and leveraging in Japanese </p>
<p>loans. Officials were working closely with the Japanese Embassy in Baghdad to help </p>
<p>progress Japanese soft loans through a “complex” Iraqi Government approval process. </p>
<p>Japan had committed some US$2bn in soft loans to Iraq, of which US$1.2bn was for </p>
<p>Basra-based projects including US$254m for the rehabilitation of Umm Qasr port. </p>
<p><b>Japanese support for reconstruction</b></p>
<p>Japan pledged and disbursed more assistance for Iraq’s reconstruction than any country </p>
<p>other than the US. </p>
<p>Japan pledged up to US$5bn at the Madrid Donors’ Conference on 24 October 2003, </p>
<p>consisting of US$1.5bn in grants (increased to US$1.7bn by July 2009) for power </p>
<p>generation, education, water and sanitation, health and employment, and Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform, and up to US$3.5bn in concessional loans.</p>
<p>502</p>
<p> By July 2009, Iraq and Japan had </p>
<p>signed agreements for 12 loan projects worth up to US$2.43bn, of which US$1.37bn was </p>
<p>for seven projects in the South:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Umm Qasr Port Rehabilitation Project. Up to US$270m to dredge shipping lanes, </p>
<p>remove wrecked ships, rehabilitate port facilities, and provide equipment and </p>
<p>materials. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Samawah Bridges and Roads Construction Project. Up to US$30m to build and </p>
<p>rebuild bridges across the Euphrates River and to build connecting roads in the </p>
<p>vicinity of Samawah, in Muthannna. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Irrigation Sector Loan Programme. Up to US$90m for irrigation drainage pumps, </p>
<p>equipment and materials including in Muthanna.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra Refinery Upgrading Project. Up to US$20m to increase capacity.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Khor al-Zubair Fertiliser Plant Rehabilitation Project. Up to US$160m to supply </p>
<p>machinery for the Kohr Al-Zubair Fertiliser Plant in Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Crude Oil Export Facility Reconstruction Project. Up to US$430m for the </p>
<p>construction of an on-shore/off-shore pipeline to export oil and installation of off-</p>
<p>shore loading facilities in al-Faw, Basra.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra Water Supply Improvement Project. Up to US$370m to improve the water </p>
<p>supply facilities in and around Basra City. </p>
<p>In November 2005, following the Paris Club agreement on debt relief, Japan agreed to </p>
<p>reduce Iraq’s official debt to it by 80 percent, with a value of US$6.7bn.</p>
<p>From February 2004 to July 2006, Japan maintained an Iraq Reconstruction and </p>
<p>Support Group, comprising some 600 troops, in Samawah.</p>
<p>503</p>
<p> The Group was mandated </p>
<p>to deliver humanitarian and reconstruction assistance only; Australian and UK forces </p>
<p>provided protection. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>336</p>
<p><b>864. </b> NSID(OD) met on 20 November to take stock of the situation in Basra.</p>
<p>504</p>
<p> Cabinet </p>
<p>Office officials briefed Mr Brown that the main aim of the meeting was “to ensure that </p>
<p>the transfer to Iraqi control in Basra, scheduled for 17 December is not delayed” and </p>
<p>that the meeting would need to assess the security situation in Basra and look at how </p>
<p>to sustain the present reduction in violence, including through possible political or </p>
<p>economic measures. </p>
<p><b>865. </b> At the meeting, Mr Alexander reported that Mr Wareing had agreed to help drive </p>
<p>forward the work of the BDC. Several of the projects included within the BDC’s 2007 </p>
<p>plan had been requested by local militia leaders, which would help “lock them into the </p>
<p>economic and political process”. </p>
<p><b>866. </b> Mr Browne observed that, from a force protection perspective, it would be </p>
<p>important to keep local militia leaders engaged and bring them into the wider political </p>
<p>and economic process as much as possible. Sir John Scarlett agreed that it would be </p>
<p>important to find ways of broadening the dialogue to address a wider range of political </p>
<p>and economic issues. </p>
<p><b>867. </b> Summing up the meeting, Mr Brown said that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK should “press ahead” with the transfer of Basra to PIC on 17 December;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>economic projects should be agreed through proper discussion with local </p>
<p>representatives, rather than favouring any faction or individual, though that “did </p>
<p>not preclude using a coincidence of interest to draw local militia leaders into the </p>
<p>wider political process”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Alexander should write with plans for the launch of the BDC; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK should continue to encourage the Iraqi Government to hold provincial </p>
<p>elections as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b>868. </b> After the meeting, Sir John Scarlett’s Private Secretary produced a summary of </p>
<p>his account of the meeting.</p>
<p>505</p>
<p> The summary stated that Mr Alexander had expressed </p>
<p>concerns about development projects agreed with JAM1 drawing resources and </p>
<p>expertise away from existing projects. There was general support for resource decisions </p>
<p>to be taken in theatre where conflicts arose between priorities. </p>
<p><b>869. </b> Mr Jones told the Inquiry that:</p>
<p>“… there had been a debate in advance of PIC as to how we could be sure that the </p>
<p>whole situation in Basra remained stable. The economy was identified as the crucial </p>
<p>thing, and we had many hours of amusement discussing that in Basra with our </p>
<p>military colleagues, the degree to which we could help.” </p>

<p>337</p>
<p><b>870. </b> Section 9.6 describes negotiations between the UK and JAM1.</p>
<p><b>871. </b> Mr Miliband was advised on 7 December that Prime Minister Maliki and </p>
<p>Governor Waili had met on 5 December and “cleared the air between them”, paving </p>
<p>the way for PIC.</p>
<p>507</p>
<p><b>872. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported on 10 December that with Prime Minister Maliki and </p>
<p>Governor Waili now reconciled, the UK had to focus on how the promises to be made </p>
<p>at the Basra Development Forum would be kept:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“General Petraeus’ challenge, reiterated to each UK visitor, to fulfil our Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s intent has been very clear. Barham Salih [the Deputy Prime Minister] </p>
<p>underlined this point when he spoke to the MOD and FCO Permanent Secretaries </p>
<p>who visited this week along with the DFID Director covering the Middle East. He said </p>
<p>that while long term capacity building remained essential, ‘jump starting’ was now </p>
<p>necessary … That should give us our lead. The way that money has been poured </p>
<p>into Anbar, by both the US and the GOI [Iraqi Government], to reinforce success is </p>
<p>also setting the standard; recognising that in counter-insurgency operations, all the </p>
<p>lines of operation must be properly supported.” </p>
<p>508</p>
<p><b>873. </b> Prime Minister Maliki and Governor Waili jointly hosted a meeting of the Basra </p>
<p>Development Forum at Basra International Airport on 12 December.</p>

<p><b>874. </b> Mr Prentice reported the following day that the Forum had been a “hugely </p>

<p>agenda to complement the security handover” which was due to take place four days </p>
<p>later.</p>
<p>511</p>
<p> The Forum had:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>focused the attention of local and central Government on Mr Brown’s economic </p>
<p>initiatives, and what needed to be done to implement them;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>allowed Prime Minister Mailiki and Governor Waili to publicly bury the hatchet. </p>
<p>At Prime Minister Maliki’s insistence, Governor Waili had pledged to tackle </p>
<p>corruption and improve governance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>showed Basra that Baghdad cared. Prime Minister Maliki had not visited Basra </p>
<p>since July 2006; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>been “authentically Iraqi and Basrawi”, rather than a creation of the PRT. </p>

<p>a robust discussion with other Ministers about the UK’s strategy in Iraq:</p>

<p>“My sense is that he believes, in the absence of clear Ministerial guidance about </p>
<p>what HMG can and should be trying to achieve, [that] DFID are being landed with </p>
<p>pressure to deliver an enormous agenda on economic growth in southern Iraq which </p>
<p>a) we are not necessarily best-suited for and in any case cannot be viewed as the </p>
<p>responsibility of a single department, and b) cannot produce meaningful results in </p>
<p>the context of a ‘broken’ politics at the centre in Baghdad and a highly problematic </p>
<p>security environment. He plans to engage actively in the conversation about </p>
<p>what HMG’s ambitions on the economic front should be and the role of economic </p>
<p>development in relation to security and political reconciliation.” </p>

<p><b>882. </b> Mr Alexander sent Mr Miliband and Mr Browne an update on progress on </p>
<p>Mr Brown’s economic initiatives on 21 December.</p>
<p>517</p>
<p> He advised that the success of the </p>
<p>Basra Development Forum was due in part to the reconciliation of Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>and Governor Waili, but also reflected: </p>
<p>“… years of often invisible effort in building up capacity of provincial government </p>
<p>to spend Iraqi resources for reconstruction and development … This is the right </p>
<p>approach – helping to set up Iraqi institutions to spend Iraqi resources, and it is </p>
<p>bearing fruit.” </p>
<p><b>883. </b> Mr Alexander continued:</p>
<p>“My visit also confirmed that we cannot view economic development in isolation </p>
<p>from politics or security. They are inter-related and require an HMG-wide effort. We </p>
<p>should therefore guard against terminology that suggests a civilian or economic </p>
<p>surge will continue to be the driving force in determining Iraq’s stability and </p>
<p>prosperity … We need a conscious broadening of the effort across HMG, the </p>
<p>mechanisms for which need to be discussed; and we need to ensure that our civilian </p>
<p>and military plans for Iraq are co-ordinated. We also need to be clear about what we </p>
<p>are aiming to achieve.”</p>
<p><b>884. </b> Basra province transferred to PIC on 16 December.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> All of the four provinces </p>
<p>within MND(SE) had now transferred to PIC. </p>
<p><b>885. </b> Mr Brown met Prime Minister Maliki in the UK on 3 January 2008.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> On </p>
<p>reconciliation, Mr Brown said that he wanted to see rapid progress on the Hydrocarbons </p>
<p>Law and local elections. On economic reconstruction, he encouraged Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki to appoint Iraqi nationals to support Mr Wareing’s work. Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>replied that he would speak to Mr Salih; he also confirmed that he would double </p>
<p>Basra’s budget. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported on 14 January that the Iraqi Minister of Finance had signed </p>
<p>off the first eight Japanese soft loans.</p>
<p>520</p>
<p> The UK was working with the US Embassy </p>
<p>to ensure that the first loan, which covered Umm Qasr port, was taken forward </p>
<p>immediately. Lt Gen Rollo would continue to track the issue, but he remained of the view </p>
<p>that the “real answer” was a Basra Development Office in Baghdad. </p>

<p>for example at the port or airport”. </p>
<p><b>888. </b> Section 9.6 describes the development of the UK’s Short-Term Strategy for Iraq </p>
<p>between November 2007 and April 2008.</p>
<p><b>889. </b> Ms Sue Wardell, DFID Director Middle East, said that a choice needed to be </p>
<p>made between maintaining current levels of effort during 2008 or “surging resources </p>
<p>temporarily”. The surge might focus on the agricultural sector, its links with the oil sector, </p>
<p>and regional trade. </p>
<p><b>890. </b> Mr McDonald asked DFID to present options and recommendations to Ministers. </p>
<p><b>891. </b> Lt Gen Rollo reported on 3 February that there had been “positive discussions” </p>
<p>with DFID in Basra on the deployment of additional experts to Basra and Baghdad to </p>
<p>support Mr Brown’s economic initiatives.</p>
<p>522</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“Given that the initiative was originally announced in early October 2007 it would </p>
<p>be good to see decisions in London to turn these into effect. General Petraeus’ </p>
<p>enquiries into what hard measures are in place to support the PM’s words have </p>
<p>become pointed and public.”</p>
<p><b>892. </b> Maj Gen Binns left MND(SE) on 12 February and was succeeded by </p>
<p>Major General Barney White-Spunner.</p>
<p>523</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>893. </b> Reflecting on progress over the previous six months, Maj Gen Binns commented:</p>
<p>“It has taken me six months to develop an understanding of the Economic and </p>
<p>Political Lines of Operation. I have learned to measure economic redevelopment in </p>
<p>decades, to be patient, to listen to, and take the advice of, specialists in the PRT, </p>
<p>some of whom have been in Iraq for more than 3 years. We should stop beating up </p>
<p>on DFID; those, like me initially, who talk of ‘windows of opportunity’ and ‘economic </p>
<p>surges’ are misguided. Iraq is awash with money. The Iraqis need help in spending it </p>
<p>and overcoming corruption through good governance, which is exactly the approach </p>
<p>taken by our PRT. Of course we will continue to use CERPs money to buy consent </p>
<p>for military operations, but let us no</p>
<p>t</p>
<p> pretend that this is sustainable development, </p>
<p>because on some occasions it is the reverse. In 10 years time Basrawis will </p>
<p>remember that the US Army Corps of Engineers built their Children’s Cancer </p>
<p>Hospital; they will probably have forgotten Operation SINBAD.”</p>
<p><b>894. </b> In his formal end of tour report, Maj Gen Binns commented that co-operation </p>
<p>between departments in theatre was “superb”.</p>

<p><b>895. </b> The ISG discussed a further draft strategy for Iraq on 14 February.</p>
<p>525</p>
<p> Mr McDonald </p>
<p>again emphasised that Mr Brown was focused on achieving economic effect in 2008, </p>
<p>and that the UK should make every effort to do so in the limited time available. </p>
<p><b>896. </b> On 18 February, Lt Gen Rollo reported that Gen Petraeus had asked to see </p>
<p>Mr Wareing during his upcoming visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>526</p>
<p> The meeting would be a useful </p>
<p>opportunity to explain how the BDC would deliver on “what Petraeus sees as a British </p>
<p>commitment to kick-start the economy of the South”. Gen Petraeus believed that </p>
<p>campaign success in Iraq depended on the regeneration of the country’s economy. </p>
<p><b>897. </b> Lt Gen Rollo assessed that the UK could do more to support Mr Wareing and, </p>
<p>by extension, economic development in the South. This included establishing a Basra </p>
<p>Development Office in Baghdad “to leverage US and Iraqi initiatives and work to remove </p>
<p>the many legal and political obstacles to investment in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>898. </b> Mr Wareing made his first visit to Basra on 18 and 19 February, to participate in the </p>
<p>first meeting of the BDC.</p>
<p>527</p>
<p> Maj Gen White-Spunner described the visit as “excellent”: </p>
<p>Mr Wareing had met Governor Waili and had had a genuine exchange of views with his </p>
<p>Iraqi colleagues at the BDC and key opinion formers. The BDC had agreed to produce </p>
<p>a Basra Economic Development Strategy by June 2008, with the aim of stimulating the </p>
<p>economy and fostering private sector development. </p>
<p><b>899. </b> Mr Wareing was unable to travel to Baghdad to meet Gen Petraeus because of </p>
<p>bad weather.</p>
<p>528</p>
<p><b>900. </b> Section 9.6 describes the deteriorating security situation in Basra from the end </p>
<p>of January, and the development by the Iraqi Government of plans to confront militias </p>
<p>in Basra. </p>
<p><b>901. </b> Mr Alexander agreed on 20 February to increase DFID’s security headcount </p>
<p>limit (the number of staff allowed in post at any one time) from seven to nine for Basra </p>
<p>and from five to six for Baghdad.</p>
<p>529</p>
<p> The new post in Baghdad would have specific </p>
<p>responsibility for facilitating the Basra economic initiatives. A DFID official advised that </p>
<p>the increase: </p>
<p>“… should be characterised as organising ourselves to give the Basra economic </p>
<p>initiatives the best chance of delivering in the shortest timeframe. It is not a ‘surge’ </p>
<p>but nor is it business as usual.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>342</p>
<p><b>902. </b> Mr Browne visited Kuwait and Iraq from 12 to 14 March in conjunction with </p>
<p>Mr Wareing.</p>
<p>530</p>
<p> Mr Browne reported to Mr Brown that the mood in Iraq was optimistic, </p>
<p>reflecting the improved security situation, political progress and the new focus on </p>
<p>economic regeneration:</p>
<p>“Inevitably in Iraq, the pace of change is slower than we would wish and no-one </p>
<p>believes it is irreversible, but we have an opportunity over the next year or so </p>
<p>to contribute to a step-change in the country’s economy and to put our bilateral </p>
<p>relationship onto a sustainable long-term footing. That does, however mean we need </p>
<p>to redouble our efforts now … to exploit the progress we have already made.”</p>
<p><b>903. </b> On the economic initiatives, discussions in Iraq had identified three areas where </p>
<p>the UK could do more: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reinforcing the UK team in Basra and Baghdad. Gen Petraeus thought that the </p>
<p>UK was “under-gunned”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>re-doubling the UK effort to unblock the investment and hydrocarbons </p>
<p>legislation, and to encourage international business to invest in Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a diplomatic initiative, with the US, to encourage a constructive partnership </p>
<p>between Basra and Kuwait. </p>
<p><b>904. </b> Mr Browne commented that working alongside the US should help improve the </p>
<p>UK’s relationship with the US. Although Gen Petraeus had been polite during their </p>
<p>meeting, and also during his later meeting with Mr Wareing, he had previously been </p>
<p>critical of the scale of the UK’s non-military engagement in Basra. </p>
<p><b>905. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported that Gen Petraeus had spelt out his </p>
<p>concerns in his meeting with Mr Wareing: </p>
<p>“In his [Gen Petraeus] view the UK had not been aggressive enough in trying </p>
<p>to achieve development change in Basra, and we needed to ‘increase our </p>
<p>horsepower’… He felt that the PM [Mr Brown] and the Foreign Secretary </p>
<p>[Mr Miliband] had promised much, but that he hadn’t seen much delivery … he </p>
<p>would make his concerns clear to the PM when he comes through the UK in April.” </p>
<p>531</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>906. </b> The Embassy commented that Gen Petraeus wanted the UK to set up an office </p>
<p>in the Green Zone in Baghdad to promote Basra, and to increase the UK presence </p>
<p>in Basra. </p>
<p><b>907. </b> Mr Alexander sent Mr Brown a further update on progress on the economic </p>
<p>initiatives on 31 March, in advance of the planned discussion of the UK’s Iraq Strategy </p>

<p>working on the economic initiatives from four in January 2008 to 10. DFID would also </p>
<p>establish a Basra Support Office in Baghdad. DFID was recruiting internally to staff that </p>
<p>office, and was discussing with other departments including the FCO, the MOD and UK </p>
<p>Trade and Investment what role they could play. Mr Wareing had stated that this level of </p>
<p>staffing was “fully adequate” to deliver the initiatives. </p>
<p><b>909. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Mr Wareing highlighted three major successes within </p>
<p>the Basra economic initiatives:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the youth unemployment programme, which Prime Minister Maliki had </p>
<p>expressed interest in rolling out nationwide;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra International Airport and Umm Qasr port, where Mr Wareing had been </p>
<p>able to bring together the UK military, DFID and local Iraqi leaders; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the establishment of the National Investment Commission and the Basra </p>
<p>Investment Commission.</p>
<p>533</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>910. </b> Mr Keith MacKiggan, Head of the PRT from September 2008, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>the economic initiatives had been “very effective”, as evidenced by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the interest shown by the Iraqi Government in replicating the initiatives </p>
<p>country-wide; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the amount of investment that they attracted into Basra; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the economic confidence that they had helped to engender.</p>

<p><b>Charge of the Knights, March 2008</b></p>
<p><b>911. </b> On 25 March 2008, in response to growing concerns over the security situation in </p>
<p>Basra, Prime Minister Maliki launched a major offensive against Basra militias.</p>
<p>535</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>912. </b> Section 9.6 considers the genesis and implementation of that military operation, </p>

<p> He said </p>
<p>that the decision to launch the operation had come as a surprise to everyone. Mr Brown </p>
<p>said that Ministers would have a further discussion of the implications of recent events at </p>
<p>NSID(OD). </p>

<p>Cabinet Conclusions, 1 April 2008. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>344</p>
<p>decisions on force level options”.</p>
<p>537</p>
<p> The meeting was provided with three papers: a </p>
<p>Short-Term Strategy, a draft of Mr Browne’s planned statement to Parliament , and </p>
<p>Mr Alexander’s letter to Mr Brown of 31 March on progress on the economic initiatives. </p>
<p><b>915. </b> The Short-Term Strategy paper considered four options for drawing down UK </p>
<p>troops in Iraq, set out the civilian and military tasks that the UK could continue to </p>
<p>undertake in each case, and assessed the impact of withdrawing from Iraq on the </p>
<p>UK’s reputation.</p>
<p>538</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>916. </b> The paper suggested criteria which might be used to evaluate those options, but </p>
<p>did not attempt such an evaluation and made no recommendation on troop withdrawals. </p>
<p>The criteria for evaluation included the ability to deliver Mr Brown’s economic initiatives </p>
<p>and the provision of a secure platform for political and economic work.</p>
<p><b>917. </b> The paper also identified a number of areas in which the UK should continue to </p>
<p>work in the absence of a significant military presence in Basra. Those included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economics. In Baghdad, the UK had carved out a “niche role alongside the </p>
<p>massive US effort”. UK support for building Iraqi Government capacity for </p>
<p>economic policy and public finance/budget management was highly valued by </p>
<p>Iraqi officials and had given the UK a seat at the “coalition policy-making table”, </p>
<p>providing critical leverage to lobby for greater engagement by the World Bank </p>
<p>and other multilateral institutions. In Basra, Mr Brown’s economic initiatives were </p>
<p>making “real progress” under Mr Wareing’s leadership. The paper assessed the </p>
<p>work to be of high importance (because a successful economy was an important </p>
<p>driver of stability), but the UK’s impact to be “low to medium” (because of the </p>
<p>programme’s relatively small scale and the fact that real progress would depend </p>
<p>on the Iraqi Government).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Governance and security/justice sector reform. Both the US and the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government valued the UK’s work to build capacity in these areas. The work </p>
<p>was of medium importance (as DFID’s projects and the FCO policing mission </p>
<p>represented “niche added value”) and the UK’s impact “medium”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pressing for more substantive multilateral and regional engagement by the </p>
<p>UN, EU, IMF and World Bank. The work was of high importance (as more </p>
<p>substantive engagement by multilateral organisations would ease the burden </p>
<p>on the US and UK and positive regional engagement was crucial for Iraq’s </p>
<p>long-term stability) and the UK’s impact also “high” (as it had more leverage with </p>
<p>the EU, UN and World Bank than the US). </p>
<p><b>918. </b> At the meeting, Mr Brown recognised that it was difficult to take firm decisions on </p>
<p>longer-term options until there was a clearer assessment of events in Basra</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>539</p>
<p> It was </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>345</p>
<p>good that the Iraqi Army had sought to take control, but the way in which it had done so </p>
<p>threatened to have a negative impact on political and economic progress, as well as the </p>
<p>security gains achieved by UK forces. The UK “could not afford to be perceived to be </p>
<p>irrelevant to the situation in Basra”. </p>
<p><b>919. </b> Mr Browne said that there were now US forces involved in Basra, and they were </p>
<p>unlikely to leave. </p>
<p><b>920. </b> Ministers agreed that troop levels should remain at 4,100 until the situation </p>
<p>became clearer and that no decision on longer-term military commitment should be </p>
<p>taken at present. </p>
<p><b>921. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Brown said that hopes for political and economic </p>
<p>stability to take hold in Basra had been “set back”. The UK needed to wait and assess </p>
<p>the implications of events “but work to bring our political and economic objectives back </p>
<p>on line”. </p>
<p><b>922. </b> The Iraqi Government and the US moved quickly to boost reconstruction in Basra </p>
<p>in the wake of the Charge of the Knights. </p>
<p><b>923. </b> The UK was concerned that the wave of new money, the focus on short-term </p>
<p>projects, and the actions of central Government would undermine existing Provincial </p>
<p>Government structures and systems (which the UK had helped to establish). </p>
<p><b>924. </b> Mr Prentice attended the Iraqi Ministerial Committee on National Security on </p>
<p>6 April, and reported that the Iraqi Government’s main priority was finding civilian </p>
<p>employment for 25,000 unemployed Basrawis.</p>
<p>540</p>
<p> Acting Justice Minister Dr Safa al-Safi </p>
<p>had been appointed to co-ordinate the Iraqi Government’s economic efforts in Basra. </p>
<p><b>925. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra reported on 7 April that a nine-strong US Civil </p>
<p>Military Operating Centre (CMOC) would arrive later that day, and would be operational </p>
<p>within 24 hours.</p>
<p>541</p>
<p> The PRT had welcomed their arrival. The CMOC’s focus would be on </p>
<p>shorter-term employment schemes (“how to get young men off the payroll of JAM and </p>
<p>other militias”). </p>
<p><b>926. </b> The British Embassy Office Basra reported the following day that it would be </p>
<p>important that the CMOC shared the UK’s philosophy that “we not do things for the </p>
<p>Iraqis, but with them”.</p>
<p>542</p>
<p><b>927. </b> A DFID official in Baghdad reported to DFID colleagues on 9 April that the Iraqi </p>

<p><b>929. </b> The UK was lobbying the US on the need to engage with local government </p>
<p>and the PRT in order to avoid setting up parallel systems and losing the benefits of </p>

<p>designed to be Iraqi-led, and thus required a considerable amount of Iraqi engagement </p>
<p>and energy) would be “crowded out” as Iraqi counterparts focused on the larger and </p>
<p>more immediate US programmes. </p>
<p><b>930. </b> A UK official in the Basra PRT agreed with that assessment and commented:</p>
<p>“None of this is going to stop and it is going to be a big distraction for a small PRT </p>

<p><b>933. </b> Dr Turner also advised that the UK would need to redouble its effort on the </p>
<p>economy: </p>
<p>“Presentationally, the US effort risks overshadowing UK economic initiatives. The </p>
<p>likelihood is that the US will focus on quick impact projects … Funding will come </p>
<p>from the US military (up to US$70m) and the Government of Iraq (US$100m or </p>
<p>more).</p>
<p>“We will need to ensure our projects are co-ordinated and complementary. </p>
<p>Experience over the past five years in such [quick impact] projects is that they </p>
<p>provide short-term benefits, but are often not sustainable. DFID’s view remains that </p>
<p>economic recovery will require … a resolution to address the deep-seated problems </p>

<p>continued to focus on drawing as much US and Iraqi resource into Basra as possible in </p>

<p>548</p>
<p> Street-life in Basra was “noticeably more confident”, with pop </p>
<p>music and alcohol on sale. Dr al-Safi had set up a committee to review project proposals </p>
<p>from the Provincial Council, the Governor and local Sheikhs, but had said that he did not </p>
<p>want proposals from the coalition. He was determined that the Iraqi Government should </p>
<p>be seen to be in charge and favoured quick impact projects focused on infrastructure, </p>
<p>implemented through line ministries and tribal leaders. On the US side, “large numbers” </p>
<p>of people were flowing into the US CMOC. </p>
<p><b>936. </b> The major risk for the UK Government remained that the Provincial Government </p>
<p>would be undermined by the decision to channel funding through line ministries, </p>
<p>tribal leaders and NGOs. The UK continued to engage with the US and Dr al-Safi to </p>
<p>emphasise the advantages of engaging with the Provincial Government, the Provincial </p>
<p>Council and the PRT, rather than creating parallel systems. </p>
<p><b>937. </b> Mr McDonald told the 28 April meeting of the ISG that: “It was now clear that there </p>

<p>550</p>
<p> He wrote to Mr Brown on </p>
<p>29 April:</p>
<p>“However unfortunate its genesis, Maliki’s operation in Basra has created an </p>
<p>opportunity to reshape our approach there and set a new direction towards </p>
<p>transition. 2009 is the year we will need to move from a Basra military strategy to </p>
<p>an Iraq political and economic strategy.”</p>
<p><b>939. </b> The Iraqi Government was “for the first time since 2003” giving full attention </p>
<p>to Basra. In support of that, the US had committed “serious assets” to strengthen </p>
<p>MND(SE). Those combined US, UK and Iraqi resources would “accelerate the rate of </p>
<p>positive change in Basra”, paving the way for a “proper and respectable end” to the UK’s </p>
<p>role as “lead partner in the coalition” in the course of 2009.</p>
<p><b>940. </b> Mr Miliband identified seven goals towards which substantial progress would need </p>
<p>to be made if the UK was to make that “final transition”, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“reconstruction clearly under way; sturdy green shoots of economic revival;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Umm Qasr port better managed and with development plans in place”; and </p>

<p>the start of “a broad-based and natural relationship with the new Iraq, the ‘whole </p>

<p><b>941. </b> Maj Gen White-Spunner reported on 1 May that:</p>
<p>“What is becoming increasingly evident, as our situational awareness improves, is </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>349</p>
<p><b>945. </b> The Cabinet Office briefing for Mr Brown stated that Gen Petraeus believed that </p>
<p>the UK should mount a civilian surge, and had advocated a more hands-on (rather </p>
<p>than Iraqi-led) approach. Dr al-Safi and Prime Minister Maliki had both recently told </p>
<p>UK interlocutors that they did not think UK-led economic development in Basra was </p>
<p>proceeding quickly enough. Dr al-Safi was “resistant” to UK lobbying in favour of </p>
<p>channelling Iraqi Government funds through the Provincial Government. </p>
<p><b>946. </b> The DFID briefing for Mr Alexander stated that the US military was becoming </p>
<p>increasingly frustrated with the pace of the Provincial Government’s clear-up of the </p>
<p>streets after the fighting, and warned that the US might be tempted to take control of </p>
<p>the operation themselves.</p>
<p>555</p>
<p> That would be a significant step backwards. The PRT was </p>
<p>trying to resist, but the pressure to make things happen was strong. </p>
<p><b>947. </b> The briefing also advised that DFID feared that the Iraqi Government’s </p>
<p>reconstruction money was being used as a way of consolidating central Government or </p>
<p>Dawa party control over Basra. That would represent a patronage-based, unaccountable </p>
<p>way of managing Basra. </p>
<p><b>948. </b> The Iraqi Army and MND(SE) were now in control of Umm Qasr port </p>
<p>(previously under militia control) and corruption and smuggling had ended. With the </p>
<p>improved security environment, it would be possible to return to US plans for the </p>
<p>commercialisation of the port. </p>
<p><b>949. </b> Mr Brown’s meeting with Gen Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker covered a range </p>
<p>of political, security and economic issues (see Section 9.7).</p>
<p>556</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>950. </b> At the meeting, Mr Alexander described the 28 April investors’ reception as a </p>
<p>success, and identified the development of the port and airport and the capacity of </p>
<p>central Government to support Basra as priorities.</p>
<p><b>951. </b> Summing up the discussion, Mr Brown said that the central UK focus would be </p>
<p>accelerated training of Iraq’s 14 Division, preparations for provincial elections, progress </p>
<p>on handing control of Basra Airport to the Iraqis and economic reconstruction. Decisions </p>
<p>on troop numbers would be taken in the context of completion of these tasks.</p>
<p><b>952. </b> The record of the meeting did not report any criticism by Gen Petraeus of the scale </p>
<p>or nature of the UK’s engagement on economic development. </p>
<p><b>953. </b> Mr McDonald advised Mr Brown the following day that the UK would need to </p>
<p>retain around 4,100 troops in southern Iraq for the next six months to complete those </p>
<p>key tasks.</p>

<p><b>954. </b> Mr Nick McInnes, UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) Director International Group, </p>
<p>briefed UKTI colleagues on 3 May that there was growing pressure from the British </p>
<p>Embassy Baghdad and the MOD for a larger UKTI presence in Baghdad.</p>
<p>558</p>
<p> Their </p>
<p>arguments for that were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the increased interest in Iraq from UK companies;</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the likelihood that Mr Brown’s economic initiatives would stimulate further </p>
<p>interest; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of sales of UK military equipment to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>955. </b> Section 10.3 describes the UK Government’s efforts to promote UK businesses. </p>

<p>559</p>
<p> The JIC’s </p>
<p>Key Judgements included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki was enjoying broad political support following the success </p>
<p>of the Charge.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Charge had significantly weakened JAM in Basra. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In Basra, expectations were high. Prime Minister Maliki would need to deliver </p>
<p>improvements in public services and job creation “in weeks”. </p>
<p><b>957. </b> Mr Browne visited Iraq briefly, on his way to Afghanistan, at the end of May, </p>
<p>where he “realised a personal ambition by having a cup of tea downtown”, the result of </p>
<p>“a remarkable transformation of the security situation”.</p>
<p>560</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>958. </b> A DFID official briefed Mr Alexander on 30 May that, following Mr Browne’s visit </p>
<p>to Iraq, there were growing expectations among some military colleagues that UK </p>

<p>561</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Visits to Basra Palace by PRT and DFID staff were currently being undertaken at night, </p>
<p>by helicopter, and were approved on a case-by-case basis. The situation was not yet </p>
<p>good enough to enable PRT and DFID staff to visit Iraqi Government offices on a regular </p>
<p>basis, but DFID would keep the situation under review. </p>
<p><b>959. </b> Ms Reid told the Inquiry that shortly after the Charge of the Knights, Dr al-Safi </p>
<p>agreed to meet UK officials but not at the Basra Air Station: </p>
<p>“That basically forced a decision … It [the meeting] was something that was so </p>

<p>“So by the time I left in October [2008], decisions on moves to the Palace could be </p>

<p><b>960. </b> The 2 June meeting of the ISG focused on economic development.</p>
<p>563</p>
<p> Ms Aldred </p>
<p>said that “economic deliverables” would form a core part of the narrative that Mr Browne </p>
<p>had asked for following his visit to Basra, and asked DFID to lead on compiling it. </p>
<p>Mr McDonald said that Mr Brown would want to announce economic progress – or, at </p>
<p>the very least, a Basra economic plan – in his planned Parliamentary statement in July. </p>
<p><b>961. </b> Ms Hendrie reported that Dr al-Safi was making little progress in spending the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government’s reconstruction funds for Basra and that, despite UK lobbying, he </p>
<p>remained reluctant to use established structures. The Basra Support Office in Baghdad </p>
<p>would become operational on 7 June. UKTI had expressed interest in appointing a First </p>
<p>Secretary (Commercial) to Baghdad, but was reluctant to fund or staff the post. </p>
<p><b>962. </b> A 9 June Current Intelligence Group (CIG) Assessment of Basra’s economy, </p>
<p>commissioned by DFID, judged that the Charge of the Knights had secured “a window </p>
<p>of opportunity to create the conditions for economic growth” but that reconstruction and </p>
<p>development would continue to be constrained by:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the absence of any systemic approach to project and financial management </p>
<p>within the Iraqi Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>competing political agendas, which meant that reconstruction was subject to </p>
<p>“political manoeuvring”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>corruption, which would remain endemic under the present Government or any </p>
<p>likely successor;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the uncertain legislative environment, which continued to hold investors back. </p>
<p>International oil companies were in negotiation with the Ministry of Oil but they </p>
<p>were unlikely to make long-term investments until a Hydrocarbons Law had </p>

<p><b>963. </b> DFID deployed an aviation industry consultant to Basra International Airport on </p>
<p>11 June, with the long-term aim of achieving “international certification” within two </p>

<p>565</p>
<p> In the shorter term, the consultant aimed to raise the capacity of the airport </p>

<p><b>964. </b> Ms Hendrie and Mr Donal Brown, her successor as DFID Deputy Director Iraq, </p>

<p> Their report to Mr Anderson and DFID colleagues </p>
<p>focused on what could be done in the next 12 months (while there was likely still to be </p>
<p>a significant UK military presence) which would constitute “a reasonable package of </p>
<p>‘deliverables’” in Basra. Components of that package included: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Basra International Airport. There was “some confusion” over what the UK </p>
<p>could deliver. International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) accreditation was </p>
<p>done at a country level rather than for an individual airport (so the UK could not </p>
<p>hand over an accredited airport). Support for the airport was a joint DFID/MOD </p>
<p>responsibility. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Completion of Pumping Station 2 and the water towers. The last two of DFID’s </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>969. </b> A DFID official briefed Mr Alexander in advance of the meeting that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr al-Safi was drawing the BDC into “party political wrangling”, questioning the </p>
<p>validity of its constitution and the UK’s role in relation to it. Prime Minister Maliki </p>
<p>had recently said that the BDC was “colonialist inspired”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the BDC was drawing up a Basra Economic Development Plan </p>
<p>which “in practice … will be based on Wareing’s own ‘Key Goals’ document”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Dr al-Safi claimed to have allocated US$100m to 200 projects in Basra and to </p>
<p>have hired 15,000 people for public works, but there was little evidence of that </p>
<p>on the ground. DFID was lobbying for the funds to be spent through “transparent </p>
<p>channels”. </p>

<p>“Partners” had raised concerns about the capacity of the Basra PRT. The Deputy </p>

<p>Basra International Airport. The UK needed to “define objectives for success” </p>

<p>UKTI support for the Basra Support Office in Baghdad. UKTI had declined to </p>

<p><b>972. </b> Cabinet Office officials invited Ministers to agree that the UK’s key tasks for </p>
<p>2008/2009 should be:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training and mentoring the Iraqi Army’s 14 Division, until it is capable of </p>
<p>independent operations with minimal Coalition support – expected in about </p>
<p>April 2009;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting provincial elections, due by the end of 2008; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting economic development in Basra, based on Michael Wareing’s outline </p>
<p>Economic Development Strategy.” </p>
<p>572</p>
<p><b>973. </b> Officials also invited Ministers to agree that the UK should continue to press for </p>
<p>passage of the Hydrocarbons Law. </p>
<p><b>974. </b> Officials assessed that Basra’s economy was gaining momentum. Since the </p>
<p>No.10 reception on 28 April, foreign investors had begun to pursue projects with a </p>
<p>potential value of US$4.3bn. The UK had helped Basra Provincial Council to secure </p>
<p>US$400m from central Government for the current year. However, the UK was still </p>
<p>being criticised for not doing enough and local politics was slowing economic progress, </p>
<p>including on the Basra Development Fund and BIPA. The UK needed a focused effort </p>
<p>to deliver and demonstrate UK achievements by early 2009, based on the Economic </p>
<p>Development Strategy being developed by Mr Wareing and the BDC. </p>
<p><b>975. </b> At the meeting, Mr Alexander reported on Mr Wareing’s draft Economic </p>
<p>Development Strategy.</p>
<p>573</p>
<p> Mr Wareing was optimistic: four major companies were already </p>
<p>examining investment opportunities in Basra. </p>
<p><b>976. </b> Concluding the discussion, Mr Brown welcomed the opportunity that his 22 July </p>
<p>statement would provide to set out UK policy publicly. The UK’s key goals for the year </p>
<p>ahead should be to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>push for early provincial elections; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hand over Basra Airport by the end of 2008; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>produce an economic plan shortly; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>complete training of 14 Division by the end of May 2009.</p>

<p><b>978. </b> Mr Brown underlined the UK’s wish to help on key issues, including Basra port, </p>
<p>oil and the steel industry. Mr Brown said that UK forces would not stay longer than was </p>
<p>necessary to “finish the tasks we had started”, specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training 14 Division;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparing to make Basra Airport operational; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting local authorities with provincial elections. </p>
<p><b>979. </b> Mr Brown also visited Basra.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p> His programme focused on SSR, although he also </p>
<p>visited Basra Airport and met key economic figures. The British Embassy Office Basra </p>
<p>reported that Mr Brown was “particularly struck by the need for rapid development of </p>
<p>the airport and ports”. </p>
<p><b>980. </b> Mr Brown told Cabinet on 22 July that the UK was pursuing four key functions </p>
<p>with Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK forces had moved from a combat to an overwatch role. UK troops’ primary </p>
<p>role was training and mentoring Iraqi forces, with a last resort intervention </p>
<p>capability, though that was also gradually being taken over by Iraq.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Pursuing economic development, which was showing some evidence of </p>
<p>success, providing Iraqi citizens with work and a stake in their future.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Local government elections would give former members of the militia the </p>
<p>opportunity to engage in democratic politics. </p>

<p>576</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>981. </b> Mr Brown said that the BDC would produce an economic plan in the autumn and </p>
<p>he hoped that local elections would take place by the end of the year; likewise the </p>
<p>handover of Basra Airport. Training of 14 Division should also be completed by the end </p>
<p>of the year, with additional training of headquarters and specialist functions required in </p>
<p>early 2009. Mr Brown “expected that we would be able to make substantial reduction in </p>
<p>the number of British forces next year, but that would depend on circumstances. He was </p>
<p>not going to make an estimate of the numbers now.”</p>
<p><b>982. </b> Mr Brown concluded that if the UK had left Iraq a few months earlier, the job would </p>
<p>not have been finished; with the improvements in security, momentum for economic </p>
<p>development and a move towards local democracy once the elections were held, the </p>
<p>Iraqi people now felt that they had a stake in the future.</p>
<p><b>983. </b> In his statement to Parliament on 22 July, Mr Brown described the impact of the </p>
<p>UK’s reconstruction effort:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“British-led” projects in the South had helped to deliver electricity for </p>
<p>800,000 people and water for over one million people.</p>

<p><b>986. </b> Mr Nigel Haywood, UK Consul General in Basra from April 2008, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that: </p>
<p>“When [Major] General Salmon and I jointly went to call on the Governor in his office </p>
<p>in August, that was the first time anybody had called on the Governor’s office for two </p>
<p>years, nobody had been out really operating in the town [since] October 2006.” </p>
<p>579</p>
<p><b>987. </b> On 24 August, in his first weekly report from Basra, Maj Gen Salmon reported that </p>
<p>he was having “very positive” discussions with the PRT on how to enable the movement </p>
<p>of civilian staff.</p>
<p>580</p>
<p> He was also developing with the Consul General a “realistic six to nine </p>
<p>month programme of works that will deliver tangible effects, based on Iraqi need”. </p>
<p><b>988. </b> In his next weekly report, Maj Gen Salmon advised that:</p>
<p>“… the inability of central and provincial government to translate cash into essential </p>
<p>services, jobs and electricity could become a central security issue. A re-oriented </p>
<p>reconstruction strategy accompanied by imaginative information operations should </p>
<p>help mitigate this risk.” </p>
<p>581</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>989. </b> Maj Gen Salmon also reported that Basra needed a “Business Support Facility” to </p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>357</p>
<p><b>990. </b> The Stabilisation Unit (formerly the Post-Conflict Reconstruction Unit – PCRU) </p>
<p>undertook a review of the Basra PRT in August, at the request of the FCO. The aim of </p>
<p>the review was to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assess whether the PRT’s objectives remained valid in the light of developments </p>
<p>since the Charge of the Knights; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>evaluate the PRT’s performance.</p>
<p>582</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>991. </b> The “primary purpose” of the review was to ensure that the PRT functioned to its </p>
<p>full potential and delivered “tangible and sustainable benefits” over the next 12 months. </p>
<p>It seemed likely that the PRT would not exist in its current form once British troop levels </p>
<p>reduced in early or mid-2009, and that the US would take over the PRT at that time. </p>
<p><b>992. </b> The Stabilisation Unit review reported that while all PRTs in Iraq were constrained </p>
<p>by insecurity and a lack of Iraqi capacity, the Basra PRT faced a number of additional </p>
<p>challenges:</p>
<p>“… a part-time leader since January 2007, a dysfunctional structural legacy, limited </p>
<p>resources, and an absence of a long-term strategy due to uncertainty over its future </p>
<p>ever since its creation in April 2006.” </p>
<p><b>993. </b> Given those constraints, the Basra PRT had performed well in some areas, in </p>
<p>particular in securing Provincial Council ownership of the Provincial Development </p>
<p>Strategy and building Iraqi capacity on budget planning and execution. The PRT had </p>
<p>also responded well to reconfigure itself to support Mr Brown’s economic initiatives. </p>
<p><b>994. </b> It was, however, clear that the PRT was not performing as well as it could. </p>
<p>It also needed to respond to the priorities set out in Mr Brown’s 22 July statement </p>
<p>to Parliament. </p>
<p><b>995. </b> The Stabilisation Unit made 26 recommendations, of which one was highlighted </p>
<p>in the review’s Executive Summary: the appointment of a full-time Head for the PRT. </p>
<p>The Stabilisation Unit assessed that while the decision in 2007 to double-hat the </p>
<p>Deputy Consul General as the Head of the PRT had been reasonable, the increased </p>
<p>expectations on the PRT in the light of the improved security situation and from the </p>
<p>US, and the increased willingness of Iraqi citizens to meet members of the PRT both </p>
<p>on and off Basra Air Station, meant that “the PRT and PRT Head … could and should </p>
<p>be busier”. The double-hatting arrangement had led the US to express concern that </p>
<p>the UK did not attach sufficient importance to the Basra PRT, and that the PRT was </p>
<p>too concerned with delivering UK as opposed to coalition goals. The Stabilisation Unit </p>
<p>concluded that the arrangement was no longer credible. </p>
<p><b>996. </b> Maj Gen Salmon reported on 7 September that, together with Mr Haywood and </p>
<p>the Head of the PRT, he had launched a re-orientated reconstruction programme with </p>

<p>583</p>
<p> Resources would come from the </p>
<p>US CMOC and the PRT, and delivery would be through task-based Joint Reconstruction </p>
<p>Action Teams (JRATs). The JRATs would be under joint civilian-military leadership (each </p>
<p>having a military head and civilian deputy head or vice versa), and would work with the </p>
<p>appropriate Iraqi authorities. </p>
<p><b>997. </b> Mr Keith MacKiggan arrived in Basra in late September 2008 to take up post as the </p>
<p>Head of the Basra PRT.</p>
<p>584</p>
<p> His arrival signalled the end of the practice of double-hatting </p>
<p>the Head of the PRT and the Deputy Consul General. He described the situation in </p>
<p>Basra at that time: </p>
<p>“We were able to get out to meet … clients, NGOs, officials in the local </p>
<p>administration, local businesses and so on. Equally importantly, they were able to </p>
<p>come and visit us because they no longer felt the fear they had previously of being </p>
<p>associated with the Multi-National Force. </p>
<p>“It also meant that we could expand our capacity building work, both in a </p>
<p>geographical sense and also in a functional sense … we were now much more able </p>
<p>to get beyond the city [Basra] to the furthest reaches of the province … and dig </p>
<p>below the level of the Provincial Council to the level of the local Councils and really </p>
<p>start to stitch the different parts of the governance structures in Basra together.” </p>
<p><b>998. </b> In their evidence to the Inquiry, Maj Gen Salmon, Mr Haywood and Mr MacKiggan </p>
<p>agreed that the UK effort in Basra was well integrated during their time there.</p>
<p>585</p>
<p><b>999. </b> Maj Gen Salmon told the Inquiry that that integrated approach had emerged in the </p>
<p>context of clear UK objectives (as set out in Mr Brown’s 22 July statement to Parliament) </p>
<p>and a timetable for withdrawal, but in the absence of an overall UK strategic plan agreed </p>
<p>in London.</p>
<p>586</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1000. </b> Maj Gen Salmon described how the move to a more integrated approach had </p>
<p>been driven by decisions in Basra:</p>
<p>“Well, we had a set of objectives. There was no comprehensive strategic plan that </p>
<p>I ever saw. So what we decided to do – when I say ‘we’, that is the Consul General, </p>
<p>the Head of the Provincial Reconstruction Team … and to a certain extent the Head </p>
<p>of US Regional Embassy Office … [was] ensure that we had much more collective </p>
<p>consensus, joined-up approach, because nobody was in charge.</p>
<p>“So that was the only way that we could think of working out what the strategy </p>
<p>needed to be and how we were going to prosecute that strategy, run it, steer it, </p>

<p>592</p>
<p> The meeting asked for </p>

<p>“DFID to consider whether a presence only in Baghdad supported by a </p>

<p>with proposals worth over US$9bn submitted to, but not yet processed by, the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government. The Iraqi Government’s inability to process those proposals was the main </p>
<p>obstacle to international investment in Basra. </p>
<p><b>1013. </b> DFID’s infrastructure projects would be completed by the end of 2008, and its </p>
<p>work with the Basra provincial administration would come to a “natural conclusion” </p>
<p>by mid-2009. The key to achieving a positive legacy for the UK was securing </p>
<p>inward investment. Given that the key obstacles to such investment were in central </p>
<p>Government, DFID would focus its effort there. That was in line with Prime Minister </p>

<p><b>1015. </b> Mr Brown met ACM Stirrup on 4 December for a “personal and confidential” </p>
<p>discussion.</p>
<p>595</p>
<p> On Iraq, Mr Brown said that it would be important for the UK to show </p>
<p>that the withdrawal of UK troops was happening because the UK had completed all </p>
<p>the tasks it had set out. A “last push” on economic development was needed, along </p>
<p>with a communications plan for the next few weeks. </p>
<p><b>1016. </b> The 9 December meeting of NSID(OD) discussed a Cabinet Office paper </p>
<p>on arrangements for transition in Iraq.</p>
<p>596</p>
<p> The paper, which is considered in detail in </p>
<p>Section 9.7, included an annex listing the components of the UK’s future bilateral </p>
<p>relationship with Iraq and how they would be resourced. In addition to the diplomatic/</p>
<p>political and defence relationships, the components were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Economic/development: Influence Iraqi economic policy, including improving the </p>
<p>climate for foreign investment, help improve World Bank and IMF engagement </p>
<p>in Iraq, capacity-building on public finance management, continued support </p>
<p>for the Prime Minister’s [Mr Brown’s] economic initiatives and support to other </p>
<p>departments’ work on investment, trade and higher education.” Work would be </p>
<p>funded from DFID’s existing Iraq programme (£20m in 2009/10 and £10m in </p>
<p>2010/11) and, potentially, from the Stabilisation Aid Fund. Staffing levels would </p>
<p>be established according to programme needs, with all in-country staff based </p>
<p>in Baghdad. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Energy: ensure security of Iraq’s oil supply and long-term increase in oil output </p>
<p>through political lobbying on hydrocarbons legislation and national energy policy </p>
<p>and regional support.” Work would be undertaken primarily by FCO staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Commercial: support for trade missions, UK investor visits and political lobbying </p>
<p>to ensure a level playing field for UK experts/investors.” A new, short-term </p>
<p>International Business Specialist would provide recommendations in early 2009 </p>
<p>on exactly what resources were needed. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Educational: increased collaboration with Iraqi educational institutions, civil </p>
<p>society, student exchanges and English language training, to be funded by the </p>
<p>British Council.” </p>
<p><b>1017. </b> At the meeting, Mr Brown outlined “strong progress” on the UK’s four key tasks </p>
<p>(training the Iraqi Army, promoting economic development, readying Basra Airport for </p>
<p>transfer to Iraqi control and preparing for provincial elections).</p>
<p>597</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1018. </b> Mr Brown concluded that more should be done to improve economic development </p>
<p>and prospects for investment, including with ministries in Baghdad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A visit by Lord </p>
<p>Mandelson, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, would </p>
<p>be welcome. It would also be important to make progress with the Hydrocarbons Law. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>362</p>
<p>Mr Brown would raise those points with Prime Minister Maliki when he visited Iraq later </p>
<p>in the month. </p>
<p><b>1019. </b> NSID(OD) agreed that agreement to the UK’s new Long-Term Strategy for Iraq </p>
<p>would be sought out of committee. </p>
<p><b>1020. </b> Following the NSID(OD) meeting, and in advance of Mr Brown’s visit to Iraq, a </p>
<p>DFID official wrote to No.10 detailing four investment proposals, together worth over </p>
<p>US$5bn, which were currently awaiting agreement from the Iraqi Government.</p>
<p>598</p>
<p> The </p>
<p>letter did not state why there had been a delay in agreeing the proposals. </p>
<p><b>1021. </b> Mr Brown met Prime Minister Maliki in Baghdad on 17 December.</p>
<p>599</p>
<p> Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki repeated his call for a wider long-term relationship, including investment </p>
<p>and economic co-operation, and stronger cultural and educational links. He added </p>
<p>that UK companies should invest in all Iraq, not just Basra. Mr Wareing briefed Prime </p>
<p>Minister Maliki separately on the main investment proposals for Basra and handed over </p>
<p>DFID’s letter detailing the investment proposals awaiting an Iraqi Government response.</p>
<p><b>1022. </b> Mr John Tucknott, Deputy Head of Mission British Embassy Baghdad from </p>
<p>November 2007 to July 2009, described the change in the UK’s relationship with Iraq </p>
<p>and the challenge it presented to the UK Government: </p>
<p>“I think Basra remained important … but the messaging that was coming out of </p>
<p>London, which we were conveying to the Iraqis, was that we wanted to move, and </p>
<p>this was the message that Gordon Brown gave to Maliki in December 2008 when </p>
<p>he visited. You know, we are talking about a whole Iraq policy now. We want to do </p>
<p>things with you which we haven’t been able to do before. We want to move on to a </p>
<p>proper footing … a less military footing.</p>
<p>“The problem that we had in the Embassy was persuading some parts of Whitehall, </p>
<p>some Government departments, to recognise that we were moving to this, that we </p>
<p>wanted to increase trade, that it was important that visas were issued to students. </p>
<p>Part of Prime Minister Maliki’s education scheme was to send 10,000 postgraduates </p>
<p>or undergraduates to go to overseas universities to study. We need to provide a </p>
<p>proper visa regime, not the one that we cobbled together.</p>
<p>“So that was a difficulty we faced, actually getting that message out to the wider </p>
<p>Whitehall machinery, that Iraq is moving forwards, and if we want to play an </p>
<p>important role in this process, we had to move with it.</p>
<p>“Messages did get through in the end. We have got a trade and investment section </p>
<p>now … poor old DFID were doing their best in their absence …” </p>

<p><b>1023. </b> Section 10.3 describes the growing pressure on UKTI from spring 2008 to post </p>
<p>a Commercial Officer to Baghdad, in response to the increased interest in Iraq from </p>
<p>UK companies. </p>
<p><b>1024. </b> Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary wrote to Mr Richard Abel, Mr Mandelson’s </p>
<p>Principal Private Secretary, on 18 December informing him that Mr Brown believed, </p>
<p>following his visit to Iraq the previous day, that there were opportunities in Iraq and </p>
<p>interest from British companies that were not being exploited.</p>
<p>601</p>
<p> Mr Brown was </p>
<p>convinced that there was an urgent need for a significant UKTI presence in both </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra, both to consolidate security gains and to ensure that UK investors </p>
<p>had every chance to benefit from commercial opportunities in Iraq. Mr Brown asked </p>
<p>UKTI to start planning immediately for a long-term presence in Iraq, consulting </p>
<p>Mr Wareing and DFID. </p>
<p><b>1025. </b> Mr Abel replied to No.10 on 16 January 2009, advising that an International </p>
<p>Business Specialist would deploy to Iraq later that month and would make </p>
<p>recommendations on UKTI’s future footprint in Iraq by the end of March.</p>
<p>602</p>
<p> Mr Abel </p>
<p>added: “There will be no gap in our commercial representation in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>1026. </b> The International Business Specialist arrived in Baghdad at the end of January.</p>

<p><b>1027. </b> Iraqi authorities took control of Basra Airport in January 2009; transferring </p>
<p>control of the airport by the end of 2008 had been one of the UK’s key goals for 2008. </p>
<p>903 Expeditionary Air Wing had operated Basra Airport since 2003.</p>
<p>605</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1028. </b> Mr Brown was informed on 14 December 2008 that the transfer of control </p>
<p>was “effectively completed”.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> Since July, the Iraqi civil authorities at Basra Airport </p>
<p>had taken on control of air-traffic control, the airport fire brigade, and other services. </p>
<p>The final stage would be a formal transfer of legal responsibility for Basra Airport to </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>1029. </b> Control of Basra Airport was formally transferred to the Iraqi Government on </p>

<p><b>Long-Term Strategy for Iraq, February 2009</b></p>
<p><b>1031. </b> Mr Miliband’s Private Secretary circulated a draft strategy for “UK policy towards </p>
<p>and relations with Iraq following military drawdown” to No. 10 and the Private Offices </p>
<p>of NSID(OD) Ministers on 13 January 2009.</p>
<p>608</p>
<p> The draft strategy had been agreed by </p>
<p>officials from all interested departments and by Mr Miliband. </p>
<p><b>1032. </b> The draft strategy, which is described in detail in Section 9.7, stated that the UK </p>
<p>had a “strategic national interest in a strong, stable and non-hostile Iraq that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>acts in accordance with international law and does not threaten its neighbours;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provides a counterweight against Iran, ideally as a pro-Western state …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>is able to deny AQ-I [Al Qaida in Iraq] and other terrorist groups a safe haven in </p>
<p>its national territory; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>contributes positively to stable world energy markets by maximising its potential </p>
<p>as a producer and exporter of oil and gas, and increases EU energy security </p>
<p>through developing new supply routes.”</p>
<p><b>1033. </b> The draft strategy identified a number of “essential” and “highly desirable” factors </p>
<p>for achieving the UK’s strategic interest of a “strong, stable and non-hostile Iraq”. The </p>
<p>essential factors included a “functioning economy”, which would require agreement on </p>
<p>the Hydrocarbons Law. Highly desirable factors included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that Iraq should be “a broadly democratic state”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that Iraq should address critical humanitarian issues, in particular the large </p>
<p>number of refugees and displaced people; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that Iraq should develop a strong and open market economy. </p>
<p><b>1034. </b> The draft strategy listed a number of elements of a future Iraq/UK relationship, </p>
<p>including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Economic: the UK would help build Iraqi capacity to deliver economic growth </p>
<p>and opportunity (DFID to lead).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Energy: the UK would help Iraq to bring greater volumes of oil and gas to the </p>
<p>market (FCO and the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) to </p>
<p>lead, with MOD).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Commercial: the UK should ensure a level playing field for UK firms in Iraq </p>
<p>(UKTI/FCO to lead). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Education and culture: increased educational and cultural exchanges would </p>
<p>underpin other elements of the relationship.</p>

<p>10.2  |  Reconstruction: July 2004 to July 2009</p>
<p>365</p>
<p><b>1035. </b> The draft strategy stated that much of DFID’s work in Basra would come to a </p>
<p>“natural conclusion” by mid-2009. DFID would respond to changing conditions on the </p>
<p>ground, but anticipated “drawing down from Basra” by that date. It would continue to </p>
<p>provide some support to programmes through the Basra Support Office in Baghdad. </p>
<p>DFID resources for Iraq would reduce from £25m in the current financial year (2008/09) </p>
<p>to £20m in 2009/10 and £10m in 2010/11. </p>
<p><b>1036. </b> The Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF) and the FCO’s Peace-Keeping Budget (PKB) </p>
<p>were essential sources of funding for UK programmes in Iraq. There was unlikely to be </p>
<p>any PKB funding for Iraq in 2009/10. MOD, DFID and FCO officials were reprioritising </p>
<p>the £15m SAF allocation for Iraq for 2009/10, to support “initiatives which support key </p>
<p>Prime Ministerial deliverables” and the Rule of Law. </p>
<p><b>1037. </b> Mr Alistair Darling, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr John Hutton, the Defence </p>
<p>Secretary, and Mr Alexander confirmed their agreement to the strategy.</p>
<p>609</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1038. </b> Mr Donal Brown informed the 4 February meeting of the ISG that the US would </p>
<p>take over the Basra PRT on 31 March.</p>
<p>610</p>
<p> The US had agreed to retain programmes that </p>
<p>were important to UK objectives. </p>
<p><b>1039. </b> On 9 February, Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary told the Private </p>
<p>Secretaries to Mr Miliband and Lord Mandelson that Mr Brown had endorsed </p>
<p>the strategy, which was consistent with the approach described to Parliament on </p>
<p>18 December.</p>
<p>611</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>1040. </b> Mr Brown remained “keen to ensure maximum savings as we move to a normal </p>
<p>bilateral relationship”, but agreed that:</p>
<p>“… the UK will retain an important strategic interest in the emergence of a stable and </p>
<p>prosperous Iraq, able to contribute to regional stability and global energy security; </p>
<p>and that we will have important bilateral interests in Iraq which need to be secured </p>
<p>and promoted …</p>
<p>“In particular, the Prime Minister continues to believe that improving trade and </p>
<p>investment in Iraq is key both to consolidating the security gains that have been </p>
<p>made, and ensuring UK investors are able to benefit from the opportunities in </p>
<p>Iraq … We also need to ensure that investors in Basra continue to be supported </p>
<p>as our military hands over to US.”</p>
<p><b>1041. </b> A planned visit by Prime Minister Maliki to the Invest Iraq Conference in London </p>
<p>at the end of April would be “an important milestone for showcasing progress in the </p>
<p>transition to a new relationship with Iraq”. </p>

<p>366</p>
<p><b>1042. </b> Lord Mandelson visited Iraq on 6 April, at the head of a delegation of </p>
<p>23 companies.</p>
<p>612</p>
<p> The objectives of the visit included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>underlining the UK’s commitment to building a new broad-based, long-term </p>
<p>partnership with Iraq, with a strong emphasis on economic and trade </p>
<p>co-operation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>countering Iraqi complaints (from Prime Minister Maliki and others) about the </p>
<p>lack of interest from UK business, while assisting the business delegation </p>
<p>to build contacts with Iraqi Ministers and members of the Iraqi business </p>
<p>community; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting UK companies pursuing business in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>1043. </b> In Baghdad, Lord Mandelson and the delegation met Prime Minister Maliki.</p>
<p>613</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Prentice reported that the meeting had been “entirely positive” and a “powerful </p>
<p>demonstration of the new civilian focus to our bilateral relationship”. </p>
<p><b>1044. </b> In Basra, Lord Mandelson and the delegation attended an investment conference </p>
<p>at Basra Airport.</p>
<p>614</p>
<p> Mr Haywood reported that the event had been “timed perfectly” so </p>
<p>that the UK could “demonstrate that whilst the military were drawing down, the UK’s </p>
<p>commitment to Basra continued”. The mood at the event had been “optimistic”, reflecting </p>
<p>the mood in Basra: recent polling showed that over 80 percent of Basrawi businesses </p>
<p>thought that the economic environment had improved over the past year and would </p>
<p>continue to improve. </p>
<p><b>1045. </b> The Iraqi National Investment Commission, with support from DFID, hosted the </p>
<p>Invest Iraq Conference in London on 30 April.</p>
<p>615</p>
<p> Mr Prentice described the Conference </p>
<p>as the UK’s “headline initiative … demonstrating in a practical way our desire for a new </p>
<p>and normalised bilateral relationship”. </p>
<p><b>1046. </b> Mr Brown made a statement to Parliament on the UK’s involvement in Iraq on </p>
<p>15 June.</p>
<p>616</p>
<p> He reported that the objectives set out in his statement of 18 December, </p>
<p>including “to promote the reconstruction of the country, economic growth and basic </p>
<p>services”, “were being achieved”. On reconstruction, Mr Brown said:</p>
<p>“Since 2003, the UK has spent more than £500m in Iraq – for humanitarian </p>
<p>assistance, infrastructure and promoting economic growth. Support to the health </p>
<p>sector has included 189 projects in Basra, including the refurbishment of Basra </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>368</p>
<p>between 76 percent and 52 percent of DFID funding was allocated to programmes in the </p>
<p>South.</p>
<p>619</p>
<p> DFID’s expenditure in the South peaked in 2005/06. </p>
<p><b>1051. </b> UK forces also had access to significant amounts of US funding from the </p>
<p>Commander’s Emergency Response Program (CERPs) to spend on urgent relief and </p>
<p>reconstruction needs. </p>
<p><b>1052. </b> The Government has not been able to provide a full breakdown of the amount of </p>
<p>CERPs funding used by UK military commanders, but it appears to have been greater </p>
<p>than the total amount provided by the UK for reconstruction. The US allocated US$66m </p>
<p>from CERPs to MND(SE) in 2005/06.</p>
<p>620</p>
<p> In the same year, in MND(SE), DFID spent </p>
<p>some £35m on infrastructure and job creation</p>
<p>621</p>
<p> and the MOD spent £3m on QIPs.</p>
<p>622</p>
<p><b>1053. </b> By April 2009, the US had spent or allocated to ongoing projects US$351m from </p>
<p>CERPs in MND(SE), and spent or allocated to ongoing projects some US$3.3bn from </p>
<p>all sources in MND(SE).</p>
<p>623</p>
<p> Over the same period, in MND(SE), DFID spent at least </p>
<p>£100m</p>
<p>624</p>
<p> and the MOD spent £38m on QIPs.</p>
<p>625</p>
<p><b>1054. </b> UK funding was also available for Iraq from the Global Conflict Prevention Pool </p>
<p>(and subsequently the Stabilisation Aid Fund and the Conflict Pool). Most of that funding </p>

<p><b>Reflections on the impact of the UK’s reconstruction effort</b></p>
<p><b>1057. </b> From the available information, it is not possible fully to assess the impact of the </p>
<p>UK’s reconstruction effort.</p>
<p><b>1058. </b> One difficulty is that the Government never defined what contribution </p>
<p>reconstruction should make to achieving broader UK objectives and so what would </p>
<p>constitute success or failure. </p>
<p><b>1059. </b> The environment in Iraq made reconstruction very difficult. For almost all of the </p>
<p>period covered by the Inquiry, insecurity was the major constraint. Other constraints </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of capacity within the Iraqi Government, both in Baghdad and the South, </p>
<p>to support and lead reconstruction;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the form and implementation of de-Ba’athification;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the politicisation of Iraqi institutions, and corruption;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the series of relatively short-lived Iraqi administrations between 2004 and 2006 </p>
<p>(with limited remits to initiate reform and an inevitable churn of Ministers and </p>
<p>senior officials); </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>370</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an international community which, because of the circumstances of the invasion, </p>
<p>was not fully invested in the reconstruction of Iraq; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the persistent lack of co-ordination between the Iraqi Government and </p>
<p>international partners, and between international partners. </p>
<p><b>1060. </b> Staff and contractors developed a number of approaches to managing the risks </p>
<p>inherent in working in such an environment:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>using innovative techniques to deliver projects, such as working through local </p>
<p>Iraqi contractors, using the military (who were more frequently able to visit </p>
<p>project sites) to manage and monitor projects, and helping the Ministry of </p>
<p>Finance to set up an office inside the International Zone in Baghdad within </p>
<p>which international consultants could work;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>systematically tracking poor performance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adapting delivery methods to reduce fiduciary risk; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building clear exit strategies into projects, including dedicating significant effort </p>
<p>to bringing in other donors. </p>
<p><b>1061. </b> The Inquiry recognises the dedication and skill of the staff and contractors who </p>
<p>worked in Iraq, often in discomfort and at personal risk. </p>
<p><b>1062. </b> Witnesses to the Inquiry and contemporary documents identify three areas in </p>
<p>particular where the UK had made a significant contribution to Iraq’s reconstruction:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building Iraqi capacity at the centre of government (including the Prime </p>
<p>Minister’s Office and the Cabinet Office), and strengthening the linkages </p>
<p>between Baghdad and the provinces; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of the provincial administration in Basra; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building the capacity of successive Iraqi Governments to manage the economy </p>
<p>(including the launch of a new Iraqi currency in 2003) and engage effectively </p>
<p>with the IMF. </p>
<p><b>1063. </b> The Inquiry met a number of senior Iraqi politicians and officials, and asked </p>
<p>them for their views on the UK’s reconstruction effort. DFID’s focus on building Iraqi </p>
<p>Government capacity to plan and manage was recognised and welcomed. That was </p>
<p>contrasted with short-term activities, including building schools and hospitals, which Iraq </p>
<p>could do for itself. </p>
<p><b>1064. </b> In Basra, the Inquiry was told that there was little to show for the UK’s </p>
<p>reconstruction effort. A small number of projects were identified as continuing to have </p>
<p>a positive impact, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>training in the UK delivered by the PRT;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>job creation programmes supported by DFID; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improvements to the sewerage system supported by the UK military. </p>

<p>371</p>
<p><b>Key economic and social indicators</b></p>
<p><b>1065. </b> It is possible to consider the impact of the international community’s </p>
<p>reconstruction efforts in Iraq by looking at the changes in a number of key indicators. </p>
<p>The table below presents selected economic and social indicators. </p>
<p><b>1066. </b> In relation to the economy:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Electricity production fell from around 4,000 megawatts (MW) per day before </p>
<p>the invasion to 500MW in May 2003 (immediately after the invasion), before </p>
<p>recovering to around 4,000MW in June 2004 (the transition to a sovereign Iraqi </p>
<p>Government).</p>
<p>628</p>
<p> By July 2009, production was around 6,000MW. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Oil production fell from around 2.9m barrels a day (bpd) before the invasion to </p>
<p>around 0.3m bpd in May 2003, before recovering to 2.3m bpd by June 2004. </p>
<p>By 2009, production remained below pre-conflict levels. </p>
<p><b>1067. </b> The under-five mortality rate fell from 42 to 38 (per 1,000 live births) between </p>
<p>2003 and 2009. Other key social indicators remained stable. </p>
<p><b>1068. </b> Perceptions of corruption in Iraq worsened between 2003 and 2009. Iraq fell </p>
<p>from 113th out of 133 countries surveyed for Transparency International’s Corruption </p>
<p>Perceptions Index in 2003, to 176th out of 180 countries surveyed in 2009. </p>
<p><b>1069. </b> The UN’s 2009 Common Country Assessment concluded that, while Iraq had </p>
<p>fulfilled its constitutional mandate requiring 25 percent of Parliamentary seats to be </p>
<p>filled by women, women remained under-represented at higher levels within the </p>
<p>public sector and government.</p>
<p>629</p>
<p> Women also had higher illiteracy levels than men, </p>
<p>participated in smaller numbers in the labour force, were paid less and were segregated </p>
<p>into certain occupations. A disproportionate number of households in poverty were </p>
<p>headed by women. </p>
