<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>Introduction and key findings</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses conclusions in relation to the evidence set out in </p>
<p>Section 12.1.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address conclusions in relation to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>broader planning and preparation for the conflict in Iraq and its aftermath, which </p>
<p>are described in Section 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the decision to remove some members of the Ba’ath Party from public office, </p>
<p>a process known as “de&#8209;Ba’athification”, which are described in Section 11.2; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq, which are described in </p>
<p>Section 10.4; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the deployment of civilians to Iraq, which are described in Section 15.2.</p>
<p><b>Key findings</b></p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2009, there was no coherent US/UK strategy for Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform (SSR).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK began work on SSR in Iraq without a proper understanding of what it entailed </p>
<p>and hugely underestimated the magnitude of the task.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK was unable to influence the US or engage it in a way that produced an </p>
<p>Iraq&#8209;wide approach.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was no qualitative way for the UK to measure progress. The focus on the </p>
<p>quantity of officers trained for the Iraqi Security Forces, rather than the quality of </p>
<p>officers, was simplistic and gave a misleading sense of comfort.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After 2006, the UK’s determination to withdraw from Iraq meant that aspirations for </p>
<p>the Iraqi Security Forces were lowered to what would be “good enough” for Iraq. </p>
<p>It was never clear what that meant in practice.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The development of the Iraqi Army was considerably more successful than that of the </p>
<p>Iraqi Police Service. But the UK was still aware before it withdrew from Iraq that the </p>
<p>Iraqi Army had not been sufficiently tested. The UK was not confident that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army could maintain security without support.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>415</p>
<p><b>Pre&#8209;invasion planning and preparation</b></p>
<p><b>What is SSR?</b></p>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Co&#8209;operation and Development (OECD) defines SSR </p>
<p>as development work that helps societies to “escape from a downward spiral wherein </p>
<p>insecurity, crime and underdevelopment are mutually reinforcing”.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>In considering the SSR effort in Iraq, the Inquiry’s task was complicated by a lack of clear </p>
<p>terminology. That is indicative of the lack of clarity which hampered SSR activities from </p>
<p>the start. The term Security Sector Reform was not used in a consistent way, and was </p>
<p>sometimes used interchangeably with phrases such as “security system reform” and “Rule </p>
<p>of Law”. It was sometimes used to refer solely to police reform or to work to reform the </p>
<p>army. The term “Rule of Law” was often used to refer specifically to the justice sector.</p>
<p>The term “Security Sector Reform” (SSR) is used in this Report to refer to work to rebuild </p>
<p>and reform Iraq’s security and justice institutions. The evidence available to the Inquiry </p>
<p>reflects the UK’s overwhelming focus on the Iraqi Army (IA) and Iraqi Police Service </p>
<p>(IPS). Low&#8209;budget projects were undertaken in relation to the Iraqi judiciary and prison </p>
<p>system (see Box, ‘The justice sector’, later in this Section) but their scale was very small </p>
<p>by comparison. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> Before the invasion, UK Government departments recognised that Security Sector </p>
<p>Reform (SSR) would be an important component in reconstructing Iraq. </p>
<p><b>4. </b> The FCO acknowledged that SSR should be “at the centre of post&#8209;conflict work, </p>
<p>rather than outside it as happened in Afghanistan”,</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> and understood that the issues </p>
<p>raised by SSR would be complex and should be planned for as soon as possible. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Papers on SSR written by the FCO between October and December 2002 </p>
<p>demonstrated the range of fundamental questions on SSR in Iraq for which the UK did </p>
<p>not yet have answers. They included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“What security structures would be appropriate for a post S[addam] H[ussein] </p>
<p>Iraqi Government? How do we arrive at an answer? What are the threats, </p>
<p>internal and external? Should we undertake a comprehensive review of the </p>
<p>armed forces?”</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“How do we replace an excessively large security apparatus with something </p>
<p>‘right sized’? Reform or abolition? Which parts of the security apparatus might </p>
<p>be loyal to a new government and which not?”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>416</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How to reform the working culture of the security sector, “particularly the police </p>
<p>and the courts, so that it operates on the basis of humanitarian values in support </p>
<p>of a legitimate government”?</p>
<p>4</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Between December 2002 and March 2003, very little progress was made in </p>
<p>answering those questions. SSR was not always referred to in consideration of </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict operations. Specific plans were not developed for what would be done </p>
<p>on the ground. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The UK saw a need to understand the US strategy before developing its own. That </p>
<p>was consistent with the broad UK approach to post&#8209;conflict planning, on which the UK </p>
<p>assumed that the US would lead, as addressed in Section 6.5.</p>
<p><b>8. </b> The UK’s short and medium term objectives for SSR were articulated by the MOD in </p>
<p>February 2003. They were defined in very broad terms, with the desired end state: “to </p>
<p>include the restructuring of the intelligence agencies, armed forces, police and criminal </p>
<p>justice system. All elements of the Security Sector to be affordable and accountable”.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p><b>9. </b> From 7 February onwards, responsibility for the UK’s policy on SSR sat with the </p>
<p>FCO under the leadership of</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, and Sir Michael </p>
<p>Jay, the Permanent Under Secretary. From 10 April, Mr Straw also chaired the Ad Hoc </p>
<p>Ministerial Group on Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR). </p>
<p><b>10. </b> Two teams in the FCO had a key role in relation to SSR:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraq Planning Unit (IPU), established to improve Whitehall co&#8209;ordination on </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict issues and provide policy guidance on the practical questions that </p>
<p>UK civilian officials and military commanders would face in Iraq;<b> </b>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the United Nations Department (UND), which would help to identify, train and </p>
<p>deploy civilian police to Iraq.</p>
<p><b>11. </b> The US&#8209;led Coalition Military Assistance and Training Team (CMATT) was </p>
<p>responsible for the training of the New Iraqi Army. The UK provided nine military officers </p>
<p>in June 2003 to assist with that task, one of which was to act as the Deputy Commander </p>
<p>of CMATT. It appears from the evidence that, in practice, the MOD led on this aspect </p>
<p>of SSR.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> On the eve of the invasion, there was no coherent SSR strategy in place between </p>
<p>Coalition partners. That was described as a “high&#8209;level risk”</p>

<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>417</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Even though officials had warned that knowledge of conditions within Iraq was </p>
<p>incomplete, it was assumed that Iraq would have a functioning criminal justice system </p>
<p>and security forces which, after the removal of Ba’athist leadership, would have the </p>
<p>capacity to play their part in its reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> It was unclear how the international SSR effort would be co&#8209;ordinated and therefore </p>
<p>what contribution the UK would make.</p>
<p><b>Occupation</b></p>
<p><b>15. </b> Immediately after the fall of Saddam Hussein’s regime there was widespread looting </p>
<p>by the Iraqi population, including in Baghdad and Basra. As described in Section 9.8, </p>
<p>UK forces in Basra were not given instructions by their commanders in the UK on how to </p>
<p>deal with it. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Brigadier Graham Binns, commanding the 7 Armoured Brigade which had taken </p>
<p>Basra City, concluded that “the best way to stop looting was just to get to a point where </p>
<p>there was nothing left to loot”.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p><b>17. </b> As the need for a functioning police force to control lawless behaviour became </p>
<p>increasingly apparent, there remained no strategy for SSR. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> Officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) reported that the </p>
<p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) had drawn up extensive </p>
<p>plans for SSR but that those had been disregarded by the US and Coalition military.</p>
<p><b>19. </b> The UK recognised that an SSR strategy was needed. On 24 April, the AHMGIR </p>
<p>agreed that the UK should lobby the US to create a “comprehensive strategy”, and to </p>
<p>involve UK personnel in ORHA scoping studies. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> A paper produced for the AHMGIR on 8 May indicated that the UK’s approach </p>
<p>continued to be based on the assumption that “the UK will neither be required nor able </p>
<p>to develop an independent policy on SSR in Iraq”.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> The UK’s immediate priorities were </p>
<p>therefore to influence the development of US policy, recognising that:</p>
<p>“Reform across the full range of security activities (armed forces, intelligence </p>
<p>agencies, justice and law enforcement institutions) is an essential element of the </p>
<p>overall Coalition strategy to establish a united and representative Iraqi Government </p>
<p>and to create the conditions under which the Coalition can eventually disengage.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>CPA Order No.2: ‘Dissolution of Entities’</b></p>
<p>In May 2003, Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) Order No.2 “dissolved” a number of </p>
<p>military and other security entities that had operated as part of Saddam Hussein’s regime, </p>
<p>including the Armed Forces. Neither the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) nor the Ministry of </p>
<p>Interior (MOI) was dissolved. The UK’s role in the development of this Order is addressed </p>
<p>in Section 9.8.</p>
<p>There was nothing in CPA Order No.2 that prevented former employees of the military </p>
<p>from applying to join the New Iraqi Army (NIA), although the provisions of Order No.1 </p>
<p>(removing “full” members of the Ba’ath Party – see Section 11.1) would apply. </p>
<p>Sir David Manning, the Prime Minister’s Foreign Policy Adviser and Head of the Overseas </p>
<p>and Defence Secretariat, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… these were policies that added to the difficulties, because we might have </p>
<p>addressed the security vacuum by trying to encourage Iraqi police, Iraqi military, to </p>
<p>co&#8209;operate with us, instead of which, they are disbanded and then become natural </p>
<p>dissidents and potential insurgents.”</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>Disbanding the Iraqi Army automatically increased unemployment in Iraq. </p>
<p>In November 2003, Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on </p>
<p>Iraq,</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> reported that issue had dominated discussions during his recent visit to Ar Ramadi, </p>
<p>the capital of Anbar Province. He stated that “unemployment had forced many to do illegal </p>
<p>acts, including attacks on the Coalition”.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> De&#8209;Ba’athification had “made it impossible for </p>
<p>most of them to be employed by the State. The governor said that 50 percent had joined </p>
<p>the Ba’ath Party not out of conviction but because it was a condition of employment; </p>
<p>40 percent for material gain; and only some 10 percent because they supported </p>
<p>Ba’athist ideology”.</p>
<p>Although a monthly stipend for those with at least 15 years’ service (who were not senior </p>
<p>Ba’athists) had been introduced at the end of June, many struggled to gain access to the </p>
<p>payments. Ms Ann Clwyd, the Prime Minister’s Special Envoy to Iraq on Human Rights </p>
<p>from 2003 to 2009, told the Inquiry about a meeting with a senior army officer who had </p>
<p>queued for his stipend for two weeks without reaching the front of the queue. He had told </p>
<p>her: “if they want to humiliate us, this is the way of doing it”.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>Issuing Order No.2 was a key CPA decision which should have been considered between </p>
<p>Washington and London. It was to have a long&#8209;term impact on the development of the </p>
<p>insurgency in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> A more proactive UK strategy for policing in Iraq – produced by UND and sent to </p>
<p>No.10 by Mr Straw – was endorsed by Mr Blair in early June. Its immediate objective </p>
<p>was “to stabilise the security situation by creating an effective interim police force </p>
<p>with international civilian police working alongside Iraqi police and Coalition military </p>
<p>9 </p>

<p>Mr David Richmond was temporarily the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq. In September </p>

<p>forces”.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> The strategy’s longer&#8209;term objective was “to establish an effective, viable </p>
<p>and sustainable police force within a fully functioning security sector”.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The initial action would be deployment of “an armed International Police Monitoring </p>
<p>Force … to Baghdad and Basra, to conduct joint patrols with the current Iraqi police </p>
<p>force and Coalition military”, requiring 3,000 armed police officers. Once the Iraqi police </p>
<p>were considered to have received sufficient initial training, the international presence </p>
<p>would shift to a longer&#8209;term training focus, eventually taking on a mentoring role. UND </p>
<p>suggested agreeing a strategy on how to reform the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) by </p>
<p>14 June and that the international force should be in place by 31 August.</p>
<p><b>23. </b> The AHMGIR, under Mr Straw’s chairmanship, did not discuss how the strategy </p>
<p>would be implemented, or consider inconsistencies with the Coalition Provisional </p>
<p>Authority (CPA) plans for police reform, as highlighted by the MOD. The MOD had been </p>
<p>in touch with Mr Bernard Kerik, a former New York City Police Commissioner and the </p>
<p>CPA Director of Interior Affairs. As a result, the MOD considered that the FCO’s policing </p>
<p>strategy was “about three weeks behind the curve”</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> because Mr Kerik did not want an </p>
<p>international force – instead he wanted 7,000 trainers. UND suggested maintaining its </p>
<p>approach until the US produced a policing strategy.</p>
<p><b>24. </b> As set out in Section 9.8, the UK struggled to have a decisive impact on CPA </p>
<p>policies.</p>
<p><b>25. </b> In July, responsibilities for SSR within the CPA were divided. Mr Kerik took on </p>
<p>responsibility for the Iraqi Ministry of Interior (MOI), including policing, fire, customs, </p>
<p>border control, immigration, passports, citizenship and disaster relief. Mr Walt Slocombe, </p>
<p>CPA Senior Advisor for National Security and Defense, focused on the development </p>
<p>of the Iraqi armed forces. That split was seen by the UK as a set&#8209;back to agreeing a </p>
<p>coherent national SSR strategy. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> By mid&#8209;July, there were just four senior UK personnel in Iraq working across SSR </p>
<p>as a whole (including reform of the police and army).The FCO had deployed Acting </p>
<p>Deputy Chief Constable Douglas Brand to lead the UK’s attempt to influence the CPA </p>
<p>police reform programme and Acting Deputy Chief Constable Stephen White to lead on </p>
<p>policing in Basra. DCC White was accompanied by two MOD police officers. </p>
<p><b>27. </b> SSR strategies began to develop on a regional basis, largely in isolation from </p>
<p>each other.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> On 17 July, the AHMGIR discussed a paper by the IPU which stated that there “was </p>
<p>still no cohesive strategy”</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> but that this was “not necessarily a cause for current alarm” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>420</p>
<p>because it reflected the rapidly moving situation in Iraq. The Inquiry does not agree with </p>
<p>that analysis. A shared understanding of what sort of police force was required in Iraq </p>
<p>and how it could be delivered was essential to ensuring that SSR resources were used </p>
<p>effectively and coherently. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> The AHMGIR identified the requirement for approximately 7,000 international police </p>
<p>officers – of which it was intended that the UK would provide 100 – as “ambitious” but </p>
<p>did not commission further work to understand the impact on CPA plans if the total could </p>
<p>not be reached. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> In August, UND asked DCC Brand to lobby the US for the creation of a policing </p>
<p>strategy for Iraq. There was no established UK policy position at that point on what sort </p>
<p>of police force was appropriate for Iraq, the role of an Iraqi police officer, the ideal force </p>
<p>structure, or how police reform should be delivered. That hampered DCC Brand’s ability </p>
<p>to influence US strategy. </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Kerik estimated in early August that Iraq would need 65,000&#8209;75,000 police </p>
<p>officers and that it would take six years to develop a force of that size. There was no </p>
<p>Coalition plan to deliver that number of officers. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> By the end of August, the CPA’s plans for a 7,000&#8209;strong international training force </p>
<p>were recognised to be unachievable. The aspiration was now “1,500 to 2,000” officers.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>33. </b> A policing strategy for Iraq was also essential to ensure that the international effort </p>
<p>was coherent across the country. The lack of co&#8209;ordination between police reform in </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra could be seen in a report produced by DCC White on 26 August. </p>
<p>He assessed that 91 international officers would be required to support the policing </p>
<p>mission in Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) (MND(SE)) and an additional 48 would </p>
<p>be required to provide force protection. DCC White told the Inquiry that that caused </p>
<p>some controversy when the numbers were communicated to the CPA staff in Baghdad </p>
<p>as they were considered to be inconsistent with the new ‘MOI 60/90 day Strategic Plan’ </p>
<p>which DCC White had not seen.</p>
<p><b>34. </b> In the absence of a clear strategy for what type of force was needed, and a realistic </p>
<p>assessment of how it could be delivered, priority was given to pushing Iraqi police </p>
<p>officers through basic training in large numbers.</p>
<p><b>Initial problems deploying UK police officers</b></p>
<p>Mr Stephen Pattison, Head of UND until June 2003, told the Inquiry that the process of </p>
<p>recruiting officers to deploy overseas was “always a struggle”</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> and “not straightforward”. </p>
<p>The requirement was often for armed police which ruled out the majority of UK officers.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>421</p>
<p>The focus was therefore on getting UK officers into niche roles in which they could </p>
<p>use their experience without being operational. As any officers deployed would have </p>
<p>to be volunteers, certain security conditions also had to be met and funding identified. </p>
<p>Government officials do not appear to have appreciated the scope of that task before they </p>
<p>started recruiting officers for Iraq. </p>
<p>The UK’s target was to have deployed 100 UK officers to conduct basic training by the </p>
<p>end of September 2003.</p>
<p>On 18 July, Mr Straw wrote to Mr David Blunkett, the Home Secretary, asking him to seek </p>
<p>nominations of up to 200 officers for firearms training. By September, 260 had applied but </p>
<p>none had been deployed. </p>
<p>It is unclear whether that was because of a reluctance on the part of the Association of </p>
<p>Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and Chief Constables (concerned about breaching their duty </p>
<p>of care given the security situation in Iraq) to release officers or whether it was because </p>
<p>the officers who had applied were not suitably qualified. </p>
<p>In addition to the officers required to run basic training, DCC Brand had also requested </p>
<p>support staff and officers to address more specific training needs such as intelligence and </p>
<p>operational planning. He told the Inquiry how, after lobbying for a Special Branch system, </p>
<p>he was unable to find someone to make the concept a reality and consequently lost </p>
<p>the opportunity.</p>
<p>An email from DCC Brand on 21 September expressed frustration that officers had still </p>

<p>18</p>
<p>The FCO, and in particular UND, had prior experience of deploying officers overseas but </p>
<p>was unable to meet the large&#8209;scale requirements of Iraq. Sir Michael Jay should have </p>
<p>ensured that his department provided the resources that the senior UK officers needed. </p>
<p>In November, after meeting DCC White, Mr Bill Rammell, FCO Parliamentary </p>
<p>Under&#8209;Secretary of State, reported that DCC White’s assessment of progress was at odds </p>
<p>with the way the situation was being described in public. </p>
<p>The Home Office record of the Iraq Senior Officials Group of 4 November recorded that </p>
<p>Mr Straw’s initial reaction to DCC White’s complaints was to call a “special meeting of </p>
<p>Ministers to discuss what more could be done”</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> but that FCO officials had advised that </p>
<p>that was not necessary.</p>
<p>Following a visit in November, Mr Straw directed Mr John Sawers, FCO Director General </p>

<p><b>Iraqiisation</b></p>
<p><b>35. </b> From early June 2003, and throughout the summer, there had been signs that </p>
<p>security in both Baghdad and MND(SE) was deteriorating. As the summer wore on, </p>
<p>authoritative sources in the UK system, such as the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), </p>
<p>began to identify issues with the potential to escalate into conflict and to recognise the </p>
<p>likelihood that extremist groups would become more co&#8209;ordinated (see Section 14.1). </p>
<p><b>36. </b> In September Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US Defense Secretary, applied pressure on </p>

<p>US$173m to US$2.2bn. </p>
<p><b>The Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC)</b></p>
<p>The Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC) was created in July 2003 to:</p>

<p>give Coalition operations an Iraqi face;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>keep unemployed young men out of the insurgency; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increase the number of security forces available.</p>
<p>Established by CPA Order No.28, the ICDC was described as “a security and emergency </p>

<p>22</p>
<p> and was authorised to perform a wide range of constabularly duties. </p>
<p>It operated under the authority of the Administrator of the CPA but was subject to the </p>
<p>supervision of Coalition Forces. </p>
<p>The ICDC’s performance received mixed reviews but it became an important component </p>

<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>423</p>
<p><b>38. </b> On 2 September 2003, in a meeting of Ministers and senior personnel, Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that he believed that the key to the security situation in Iraq was “the rapid mobilisation </p>
<p>of an effective Iraqi police force”.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> That included increasing Iraqi police manpower to </p>
<p>70,000 within three months. That ambitious new target brought forward the timescale </p>
<p>set by the CPA for reaching that size of force by more than six months.</p>
<p><b>39. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence pre&#8209;dating 2 September of the origins of </p>
<p>the proposal to accelerate training so dramatically, or of analysis of whether it was </p>
<p>achievable. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The IPU advised that existing policy was to provide 70,000 police officers by </p>
<p>mid&#8209;2004 and train 40,000 for the New Iraqi Army within one year. It listed some ideas </p>
<p>for how SSR could be accelerated and improved but did not suggest any further </p>
<p>resources beyond those which were already in train. The advice did not assess how </p>
<p>those suggestions would be resourced and implemented and did not provide an analysis </p>
<p>of whether Mr Blair’s target of 70,000 officers was achievable. </p>
<p><b>41. </b> A briefing paper for Mr Blair by Mr Richmond stated that Ambassador Bremer did </p>
<p>not think that Mr Blair’s target was achievable. </p>
<p><b>42. </b> The IPU paper and Mr Richmond’s advice suggested that, at the very least, detailed </p>
<p>work was needed to assess whether it was possible to accelerate the training timetable </p>
<p>in the way Mr Blair proposed, and what resources that would require, before the idea </p>
<p>was pursued further. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> Sir Michael Jay, as the senior official accountable for the resourcing of the UK’s </p>
<p>police reform effort, should have ensured that such an assessment was made. The </p>
<p>AHMGIR, chaired by Mr Straw, failed to assess whether Mr Blair’s target and the IPU’s </p>
<p>suggestions could be achieved. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> Mr Blair pressed the idea of acceleration, including with President Bush, without </p>
<p>having requested or considered such detailed advice. Ahead of a video conference with </p>
<p>President Bush on 5 September, Mr Blair sent the President a Note which stated: </p>
<p>“Iraq has 37,000 police. We need to double that. Given the number of trainers and </p>
<p>their facilities, that will take a year. We cannot wait that long. So: if we need to treble </p>
<p>or quadruple the trainers and expand the numbers of Iraqi police even beyond that </p>
<p>contemplated, we should do it …”</p>
<p>24</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The record of the video conference between Mr Blair and President Bush stated that </p>
<p>Mr Blair had said a “big push” was required to boost numbers and speed up training of </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>424</p>
<p><b>46. </b> For the first meeting of the Iraq Senior Officials Group on 9 September, an IPU </p>
<p>paper maintained that the focus should be on the Iraqi Civil Defence Corps (ICDC) and </p>
<p>the police “as the most likely to produce quick results, while continuing to support the </p>
<p>longer&#8209;term development of the New Iraqi Army”.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> It did not address Mr Blair’s target </p>
<p>of doubling police officer numbers. It assessed that “the main problem in developing </p>
<p>the Iraqi Police is the slowness with which CPA is developing its strategy, concept and </p>
<p>timelines for reform” and that “in the absence of a central strategy, we are pursuing </p>
<p>regional options”. </p>
<p><b>47. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting of the AHMGIR on 18 September re&#8209;affirmed </p>
<p>the requirement for a “coherent overall policing strategy”.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> Cabinet Office officials </p>
<p>reported that the UK was lobbying Ambassador Bremer, and Washington, to expedite </p>
<p>creation of a strategy and operational plan, and was offering the services of DCC Brand </p>
<p>to write them. The Annotated Agenda did not reflect Mr Blair’s desire to double the </p>
<p>number of police officers. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Despite the IPU’s analysis that lack of strategic direction for police reform was </p>
<p>the “main problem”, it was not mentioned in a report to Mr Blair from Mr Straw’s office </p>
<p>on 17 October. That risked giving an unrealistic impression of both what had been </p>
<p>achieved and what might be achieved in the future. The report stated: “We judge that the </p>
<p>Coalition now has a credible and deliverable strategy to train 30,000 Iraqi police over </p>
<p>the next year.”</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> By that stage, around 40,000 police officers were considered to have </p>
<p>been trained.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Mr Straw told the Inquiry that he considered that judgement to be “reasonable”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> at </p>
<p>the time but that with hindsight he could see that it was not.</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Following the FCO Police Contributors conference in early October, it was clear </p>
<p>that sufficient additional international support to make plans for accelerated training </p>
<p>deliverable was unlikely to be forthcoming. </p>
<p><b>51. </b> In October, a public order incident in Basra demonstrated the continued </p>
<p>deficiencies of the local police. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Shortly afterwards, DCC White publicly expressed concerns about the SSR </p>
<p>programme in Iraq, and the UK’s resourcing of it, in a documentary broadcast by BBC </p>
<p>Northern Ireland. DCC White told the Inquiry that his remarks had caused controversy </p>
<p>in the UK and he was left “feeling unsupported and isolated”</p>
<p>30</p>
<p> but for the support of </p>

<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>425</p>
<p><b>53. </b> Following a review, Combined Joint Taskforce&#8209;7 (CJTF&#8209;7)</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> issued an Order on </p>
<p>27 October entitled ‘Acceleration of the Iraqi Police Services’ which envisaged enhanced </p>
<p>support from CJTF&#8209;7 for enlarged and accelerated police training programmes. It had </p>
<p>been developed without consultation with the UK.</p>
<p><b>54. </b> Sir Hilary Synnott reported that the Order had:</p>
<p>“ … considerable implications for military resources to be devoted to police training; </p>
<p>for our current plans, including the recently inaugurated Basra Regional Police </p>
<p>Academy; and for the significant Danish effort at present and in future. We had no </p>
<p>warning of this from CPA Baghdad (beyond a slight reference to such a possibility), </p>
<p>no subsequent information from them and no consultation.”</p>
<p>32</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>55. </b> On 6 November, the AHMGIR was told that the new approach included “accelerating </p>
<p>recruitment, training and deployment of Iraqi security forces”.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> The ICDC was set to </p>
<p>increase by April 2004 and the target for 70,000 police should be reached by August </p>
<p>2004 rather than March 2005. The training of the Iraqi Army would be slowed, but the </p>
<p>Army would “now be allowed to undertake internal as well as external security tasks”. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> Although the US military had produced plans for accelerating training, they had not </p>
<p>addressed DCC White’s concerns about the quality of that training. </p>
<p><b>57. </b> Former DCC Brand told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“Trying to persuade my military colleagues at two&#8209;star and three&#8209;star level that this </p>
<p>was a long&#8209;term investment of restructuring the police seemed to work against their </p>
<p>sort of short&#8209;term mission goals, and I very vividly remember the presentation that </p>
<p>was done to the Commanding General which was entitled ‘30,000 in 30 Days’ … </p>
<p>I had to say ‘Okay, in that case then, why don’t you give me the military to train? </p>
<p>I have read a few war books, I have seen a few war films, it can’t be as difficult as </p>
<p>that, or is that as ridiculous as what you are suggesting, which is we recruit 30,000 in </p>
<p>30 days, call them police, label them police, give them weapons and say ‘You are </p>
<p>now in the police’ but actually have no capability to do the things that policemen </p>
<p>should do at all?”</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>58. </b> In November, Chief Constable Paul Kernaghan, the lead on international affairs for </p>
<p>the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), told Mr Straw that police reform in Iraq </p>
<p>still lacked vision and that the UK contribution was insufficient. </p>
<p><b>59. </b> At about the same time, Mr Jim Daniel, a senior ex&#8209;Home Office adviser sent to </p>
<p>Iraq to help the CPA generate a policing strategy, decided to resign. The combination of </p>
<p>31 </p>
<p>CJTF&#8209;7, the Coalition HQ in Iraq, was a small command. It was led by Lieutenant General Ricardo </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>426</p>
<p>CC Kernaghan’s advice, DCC White’s views and Mr Daniel’s resignation were </p>
<p>sufficient to highlight that police reform – an essential part of the UK’s exit strategy – </p>
<p>was in serious difficulties. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> By the end of November 2003, Mr Straw had clear evidence that police reform in </p>
<p>Iraq lacked strategic direction. He should have instigated consideration of the UK’s </p>
<p>options for resolving the problem, including work to define a UK position on the right </p>
<p>strategy for Iraqi policing. </p>
<p><b>61. </b> The response of the AHMGIR, chaired by Mr Straw, was instead that the UK </p>
<p>should lobby the US to make improvements in police training. Mr Straw should have </p>
<p>recognised that lobbying alone would be insufficient to address the critical lack of a </p>
<p>strategy/vision for policing in Iraq. Mr Straw’s direction to Mr Sawers (see Box, ‘Initial </p>
<p>problems deploying UK police officers’, earlier in this Section) focused too narrowly on </p>
<p>the deployment of UK police officers rather than on the wider issues in police reform. </p>
<p>THE US MILITARY TAKE THE LEAD ON POLICE REFORM</p>
<p><b>62. </b> In mid&#8209;November, a new political timetable for Iraq was announced, which brought </p>
<p>forward the handover of power from the CPA to the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) </p>
<p>to June 2004.</p>
<p>35</p>
<p> Former DCC Brand told the Inquiry that the change of timetable critically </p>
<p>changed everyone’s outlook: “all the focus was on ‘Let’s get this over to the Iraqis’, and </p>
<p>so our longer&#8209;term intentions were almost squashed from there on”.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>63. </b> Towards the end of 2003, within the UK there was awareness that assessments </p>
<p>given by US commanders were “exaggerated”</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> and there were doubts about Iraqi </p>
<p>capacity. A significant gap in figures was highlighted by the FCO, which assessed </p>
<p>that there were around 45,000 operational police officers throughout Iraq, all requiring </p>
<p>some level of re&#8209;training. The US assessment was that there were 63,000 operational </p>
<p>police officers.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> In the absence of a coherent strategy, Coalition partners continued to work </p>
<p>independently of one another. An example of this occurred in February 2004, when </p>
<p>the UK started recruiting 40 retired UK officers to act as mentors. At the same time, </p>
<p>the US was developing plans to recruit around 500 police advisers from Dyncorps to </p>
<p>act as mentors, of which 50 were planned for deployment to the South. That was met </p>
<p>with some consternation by Mr Steve Casteel, who replaced Mr Kerik as CPA Director </p>
<p>of Internal Affairs in September 2003. He reportedly said: “This isn’t two countries, </p>
<p>you know.”</p>
<p>38</p>

<p>427</p>
<p>Karl Eikenberry, former US Security Co&#8209;ordinator and Chief of the Office of Military </p>
<p>Co&#8209;operation in Afghanistan. It was thought that the change would provide the unity of </p>
<p>command across the security sector that was needed. The report reiterated that the </p>
<p>Army’s focus should remain on external threats but its training rate be reduced to allow </p>
<p>the development of other security forces. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> The change in responsibilities led to the creation of a new umbrella structure, the </p>
<p>Office of Security Co&#8209;operation (OSC), commanded by Major General Paul Eaton, the </p>
<p>former commander of CMATT. CMATT and the newly named policing equivalent – the </p>
<p>Coalition Police Assistance Training Team (CPATT) – would report to the OSC and the </p>
<p>OSC would report to the CJTF&#8209;7. </p>
<p><b>67. </b> It appears that DCC Brand and Mr Casteel had not been consulted about that </p>
<p>significant change in approach. Former DCC Brand told the Inquiry that the creation of </p>
<p>the OSC was a shock to both him and Mr Casteel. He said that, while the military could </p>
<p>do “the volume stuff”,</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> they did not have the skill set to conduct basic training or the </p>
<p>policy advice on policing. That meant “they were making it up … from theatre, rather </p>
<p>than back at the policy headquarters”.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> On 25 March 2004, the FCO’s Weekly Update on Iraq for No.10 stated that a </p>
<p>CENTCOM review had concluded that transition to local control across Iraq was “likely </p>
<p>to be delayed by up to eight months from their original over optimistic target of May </p>
<p>2004”.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> The paper stated that was “not a surprise”:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Security Forces do not just have to be hired; they must be vetted, trained, </p>
<p>equipped, mentored and certified ie capability, not numbers, is the key … Bremer </p>
<p>has been pushing for quality for months, without the support in Washington, where </p>
<p>the emphasis has been on numbers. On the positive side, a lesson has now been </p>
<p>learned.”</p>
<p><b>69. </b> The Cabinet Office sent an update for Ministers on 2 April, stating that police training </p>
<p>was to be accelerated under the new structures with a target of completing in&#8209;service </p>
<p>training of 43,000 officers by January 2005.</p>
<p><b>70. </b> Although advice and information sent to Ministers consistently emphasised the </p>
<p>importance of training competent police officers, the focus of effort continued to be on </p>
<p>training officers in high numbers.</p>
<p>SECURITY DECLINES</p>
<p><b>71. </b> There was a significant worsening of security in the spring of 2004. Coupled with </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p>prison, this led many of the Inquiry’s witnesses to conclude that the spring of 2004 was </p>
<p>a turning point, as described in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>72. </b> In April, weaknesses in the ICDC and IPS were exposed as a result of uprisings </p>
<p>in Fallujah and Najaf. Some officers abandoned their posts and aided the insurgency. </p>
<p>Others mutinied when they came under fire. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> The ICDC was affected worst of all. 12,000 members deserted within two weeks. </p>
<p>Consideration was given to re&#8209;engaging military officers dismissed under the policy of </p>
<p>de&#8209;Ba’athification (see Section 11.1). Ambassador Paul Bremer, Presidential Envoy to </p>
<p>Iraq and Head of the CPA, maintained that the de&#8209;Ba’thification policy was correct, but </p>
<p>had been poorly implemented. Mr Blair told President Bush that the Coalition needed to </p>
<p>do “whatever it takes”</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> to get the ICDC and police into shape. He added: “I’m not sure </p>
<p>we really have our entire system focused on this; and it needs to be”.</p>
<p><b>74. </b> Mr Blair held a meeting with Ministers and senior officials on 13 May to discuss </p>
<p>security in Iraq. He expressed a clear view that there were two key issues in Iraq: the </p>
<p>political process and security, of which security was “fundamental”.</p>
<p>42</p>
<p> After the transfer of </p>
<p>sovereignty, Mr Blair felt that the Iraqis would be reluctant to ask the Coalition to manage </p>
<p>security for them and this “put a real premium on building capacity urgently”. </p>
<p><b>75. </b> At Mr Blair’s request, a team led by Major General Nicholas Houghton, Assistant </p>
<p>Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations), visited Iraq from 20 to 23 May to see what could </p>
<p>be done to speed up Iraqiisation of the security sector. </p>
<p><b>76. </b> Maj Gen Houghton’s frank assessment identified issues that should already </p>
<p>have been clear to Ministers and officials. He noted the lack of strategy, “bureaucratic </p>
<p>complexity”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> hindering access to funds and resources, “initiative overload” and a </p>
<p>short&#8209;term focus. He stated that the concept of acceleration was “misplaced”. It was </p>
<p>“‘Sustained Effort”, with some change in emphasis, that would produce the desired </p>
<p>capability. He highlighted the need for “honest acceptance” of the likely timescales.</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Maj Gen Houghton assessed that: </p>
<p>“The biggest single thing that will move the creation of capability forward is the </p>
<p>increased use of military and police assets in mentoring roles. This should involve, </p>

<p>429</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Maj Gen Houghton stated that over 80,000 police officers were operational with </p>
<p>approximately 20,000 having received training. An accelerated training programme was </p>
<p>being put in place by CPATT. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Blair tried to inject a new sense of urgency into Iraqiisation. In five meetings </p>
<p>and conversations with President Bush in May and June, Mr Blair raised Iraqiisation, </p>
<p>emphasising its importance and his hope that Lieutenant General David Petraeus, </p>
<p>Commanding General Multi&#8209;National Force – Iraq,</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> and Prime Minister Designate </p>
<p>Dr Ayad Allawi could agree a joint plan on Iraqiisation for publication. </p>
<p><b>81. </b> On 3 June, Mr Blair asked to be informed of “<i>any</i> obstacles or log jams”</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> which he </p>
<p>might need to raise with President Bush. He commissioned a round&#8209;up on Iraqiisation </p>
<p>every two weeks. </p>
<p><b>82. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, and General Sir Mike Walker, Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff, provided Mr Blair with an update on Iraqiisation two weeks later. Mr Blair </p>
<p>again asked to be informed of any issues automatically rather than having to ask.</p>
<p><b>83. </b> On 16 June, Mr Blair wrote to President Bush that the problem with Iraqiisation was </p>
<p>“obvious”: “The numbers in the police are there. But not the quality or equipment …”</p>
<p>46</p>
<p><b>84. </b> By the end of the Coalition’s Occupation in June 2004, Ministers were aware that </p>
<p>Iraqiisation was critical to the UK’s withdrawal and that it was the quality, not quantity, </p>
<p>of officers in the ISF that was critical. But the US and UK were no closer to achieving </p>
<p>a coherent SSR strategy for Iraq. As the CPA was disbanded and responsibility for </p>
<p>day&#8209;to&#8209;day interaction with the Iraqi Interim Government on civil affairs passed to the </p>
<p>newly appointed British and US Ambassadors, there was no plan to develop one. </p>
<p><b>The justice sector</b></p>
<p>For SSR, the UK’s overwhelming focus was on the army and police. The need for a robust </p>
<p>judicial system had been recognised but was poorly supported.</p>
<p>Prisons were listed as a “priority one area”</p>
<p>47</p>
<p> in April 2003 but by December it was reported </p>
<p>that “not much work had been done in this area”.</p>
<p>In June 2003, Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, told the AHMGIR that corruption and </p>
<p>intimidation had left the Iraqi judicial system in a worse state than expected and that it </p>
<p>would require a long&#8209;term commitment from the international community to rebuild it. </p>
<p>In March 2004, a report from Mr Robert Davies, Chief Police Adviser to the Ministry </p>
<p>of Interior, stated that only one out of five Iraqi Correctional Service facilities was </p>
<p>functioning in the UK’s Area of Responsibility. Even that facility was in poor condition </p>
<p>and overcrowded. In January, the prison held 478 prisoners against a capacity of 230. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>430</p>
<p>Part of the reason identified for this rise had been a weakness in the due process where </p>
<p>prisoners were kept on remand without judicial review.</p>
<p>SSR projects in the justice sector were small in comparison with efforts being made to </p>
<p>reform the Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police Service:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In January 2004, DFID approved a contribution of £2.2m over two years </p>
<p>towards the International Legal Assistance Consortium (ILAC). A review of </p>
<p>the programme in June 2006 stated “that the project was put together under </p>
<p>pressure rapidly to get programme activities started with some quick&#8209;win </p>
<p>activities … The pressure to move fast, however, may well have sown the seeds </p>
<p>for the eventual, limited impact”.</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A support programme for prisons in southern Iraq was approved during the </p>
<p>summer of 2004. The UK awarded £1.7m to the programme (after a bid of </p>
<p>£5.53m) to train and mentor staff. All prisons within the CPA(South) boundary </p>
<p>run by the Iraqi Prison Service were overseen and maintained by the UK.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK contributed some staff towards the EU JustLex programme that began </p>
<p>in February 2005. The programme was an integrated police and Rule of Law </p>
<p>mission for Iraq by Member States arranging senior management training for the </p>
<p>police, judiciary and prison service. Over four years, it comprised 40 staff from </p>
<p>across the EU and spent roughly €30m.</p>
<p>As with the majority of SSR programmes, success seemed to be measured by the </p>
<p>number of Iraqi staff trained. The programmes were not effective in solving the underlying </p>
<p>problems of corruption and intimidation that thwarted significant improvement.</p>
<p>Officials were still reporting in May 2006 that justice continued to be “the missing link”.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>In March 2007, the Better Basra plan described Iraq’s judiciary as “weak and unable to </p>
<p>prosecute serious crime”.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> Prisons were described as “old, overcrowded” and said to “not </p>
<p>meet minimum international human rights standards”. That assessment suggested that </p>
<p>little progress had been made from the UK’s early assessments of Iraq’s justice sector. </p>
<p>Severe overcrowding was still an issue in December 2007 when an FCO official reported </p>
<p>that: </p>
<p>“Through a combination of negligence, incompetence, poor co&#8209;ordination and </p>
<p>lack of adequate facilities it can take a long time to process detainees through the </p>
<p>investigative, judicial and correctional systems.”</p>
<p>51</p>
<p><b>Transition</b></p>

<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>431</p>
<p>The role of the Multi&#8209;National Force (MNF) was to continue building the capability of </p>
<p>the ISF and its institutions through a programme of recruitment, training, equipping, </p>
<p>mentoring and monitoring.</p>
<p><b>86. </b> During the CPA era, the metric used to measure progress in relation to the ISF had </p>
<p>been the number of personnel on duty. Immediately after the transition, that metric was </p>
<p>replaced by “trained and equipped”</p>
<p>52</p>
<p> personnel. The net result was a 75 percent drop in </p>
<p>the totals of force personnel attributed to the MOI from 181,297 “on duty” personnel on </p>
<p>15 June to 47,255 “trained and equipped” personnel on 25 August.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Shortly after transition, Mr Straw advised the Ministerial Committee on Defence and </p>
<p>Overseas Policy (DOP) that the SSR objective for the following six months should be </p>
<p>for the ISF to be in control across much of the country. That was the basis on which UK </p>
<p>troop reductions would be feasible. DOP agreed. It is not clear how Mr Straw reached </p>
<p>the conclusion that that was a viable objective. </p>
<p><b>88. </b> By early October, there was clear evidence that the SSR objective agreed by DOP </p>
<p>was unlikely to be achievable because:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Basra police chief was working with militants who were causing disruption </p>
<p>in the area.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There remained significant capacity issues within key ministries. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There was a need for more focused IPS training in areas of operational planning </p>
<p>and intelligence.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Warnings from theatre continued to stress that the focus on numbers was </p>
<p>misplaced – the morale and integrity of officers who had joined the ISF </p>
<p>was questionable and those issues needed to be addressed to deliver the </p>
<p>capabilities required.</p>
<p><b>89. </b> In November, FCO officials informed Mr Straw that they were factoring such </p>
<p>concerns into their planning. They assessed that the two most serious problems were </p>
<p>the dysfunctional MOI and the lack of equipment, both of which were being addressed </p>
<p>by UK&#8209;funded initiatives.</p>
<p><b>90. </b> It should have been clear to Mr Straw and FCO officials, for whose advice </p>
<p>Sir Michael Jay was accountable, that the ISF were unlikely to be able to provide </p>
<p>security and that troop reductions based on the assumption that Iraqiisation would be </p>
<p>successful needed to be reconsidered.</p>
<p><b>91. </b> On 9 December, despite evidence to the contrary, the FCO continued to advise that, </p>
<p>by the summer of 2005, the ISF could take the lead on security. It was overly optimistic </p>
<p>of the FCO, under Mr Straw’s leadership, to believe that would be the case. That </p>
<p>over&#8209;optimism distorted consideration of when UK forces should be withdrawn from Iraq. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>432</p>
<p><b>92. </b> A JIC Assessment of 15 December assessed that a credible ISF, capable of </p>
<p>managing the insurgency unaided, would not emerge until 2006 at the earliest.</p>
<p><b>93. </b> The JIC Assessment was discussed at the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq the </p>
<p>following day. Ministers agreed that a number of papers should be prepared, including </p>
<p>practical suggestions to adjust the Petraeus Plan</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> for SSR, ways of improving the Iraqi </p>
<p>Ministry of Defence and MOI, a list of security and funding issues for Mr Blair to raise </p>
<p>with President Bush and a list of useful activities that other countries could be asked to </p>
<p>undertake. The lack of a policing strategy for Iraq, which had been identified by the IPU </p>
<p>as early as July 2003, had still not been addressed. </p>
<p><b>94. </b> In February 2005, the FCO produced a paper for the AHMGIR that contained </p>
<p>proposals for a greater focus at the national level where there was “an urgent need </p>
<p>for an Iraqi national policing strategy, supported by an appropriate training syllabus </p>
<p>to address established weaknesses”.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> The proposals were for the development of a </p>
<p>National Police Plan and in the areas of forensics and intelligence. The FCO paper also </p>
<p>pointed to potential funding pressures if those new proposals were to be adopted and if </p>
<p>current projects were extended. </p>
<p><b>95. </b> The FCO told the AHMGIR that the key message from the paper was that funding </p>
<p>beyond September was extremely tight and tough decisions would need to be made. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> In the absence of an SSR strategy against which the merits and contribution of any </p>
<p>particular project or programme could be judged, the basis on which such decisions </p>
<p>could be made was unclear.</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Just three months after the JIC had raised concerns about the development of the </p>
<p>ISF, the MOD advised No.10 in March that the Petraeus Plan was “largely on track, </p>
<p>meeting the demands of a well&#8209;entrenched counter insurgency”.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> The ISF was expected </p>
<p>to achieve full strength by January 2006 and the transfer of regional control would be </p>
<p>under way. The view from No.10 was that the MOD’s advice was “rather insubstantial, </p>
<p>and almost certainly too optimistic in its assessment of the quality of much of the ISF”.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>98. </b> The MOD’s assessment was also contrary to other reports coming from Iraq around </p>
<p>that time and it became difficult for Ministers to know which evidence was most accurate. </p>
<p>In his Hauldown Report, Lieutenant General John Kiszely, Senior British Military </p>
<p>Representative, Iraq (SBMR&#8209;I) from October 2004 to April 2005, described the MOI as </p>
<p>dysfunctional and stated that any expectation that the IPS would be able to perform well </p>
<p>against the insurgency was unrealistic. </p>
<p>53 </p>
<p>The Petraeus Plan followed a ‘Troops to Task’ assessment carried out by Lt Gen Petraeus in the </p>
<p>summer of 2004. The resulting plan was to increase the Iraqi Police Service and Iraqi National Guard </p>
<p>by roughly 50 percent.</p>

<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>433</p>
<p><b>99. </b> During the summer of 2005, there is evidence that UK officials were not clear </p>
<p>about their departments’ role within the SSR effort and felt disconnected from what was </p>
<p>happening on the ground. That was exemplified in June when DFID commissioned </p>
<p>a consultant to assist the FCO in drawing together a cross&#8209;Whitehall strategy for UK </p>
<p>support to the development of Iraqi policing capacity. The FCO, the MOD and DFID </p>
<p>struggled to reach an agreement on what the strategy should say and acknowledged </p>
<p>they simply did not know whether policing was on track or not. </p>
<p><b>100. </b> Lieutenant General Robin Brims, SBMR&#8209;I, reported in July that, although the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army was steadily increasing in confidence, it did not yet have the ability to conduct </p>
<p>complex operations. The police were lagging behind the army and were of doubtful </p>
<p>quality but plans were in place to address that.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> Mr Blair saw Lt Gen Brims’ report and sought an honest assessment of the </p>
<p>progress of Iraqiisation, which suggests a lack of confidence in the MOD’s reporting. </p>
<p>Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, admitted that there was still a focus on quantity </p>
<p>rather than quality in stating “numerically, generation of ISF remains on track, but </p>
<p>significant development in key capability areas is still needed”.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>102. </b> The information on ISF numbers also masked other issues. In September, an </p>
<p>FCO transition plan for the IPS showed, when compared with earlier MOD papers, that </p>
<p>the overall figure of 55 percent of police trained masked considerable variations across </p>
<p>MND(SE) – although 90 percent of personnel in Dhi Qar province had received training, </p>
<p>the figures for Muthanna and Basra were considerably lower (40 percent and 42 percent </p>
<p>respectively).</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Mr Blair expressed his concerns about ISF capability, following reports of police </p>
<p>involvement in attacks on the Multi&#8209;National Forces in Basra. But despite concerns that </p>
<p>had been expressed about the capacity of the ISF, Dr Reid recommended a reduction in </p>
<p>UK forces should take place in October or November of 2005.</p>
<p><b>104. </b> A few days after Dr Reid made his recommendation the Jameat incident in Basra </p>
<p>on 19 September raised questions about the ISF in MND(SE). Officials from the FCO, </p>
<p>the MOD and DFID judged that the incident had highlighted the risks to achieving UK </p>
<p>objectives in MND(SE), and that those risks had implications for military resources. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, assumptions about ISF readiness were not re&#8209;examined by Ministers. </p>
<p>Reluctance to consider the potential implications of the Jameat incident obscured what </p>
<p>it had revealed about the security situation in MND(SE).</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, wrote: “It is clear that we </p>
<p>need to review whether our police training strategy in the South&#8209;East is working, and </p>
<p>whether the national policing strategy knits together.”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> Sir Nigel reported that Mr Blair </p>
<p>had agreed that Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary, </p>

<p>should be asked to visit Iraq and that he wanted a UK Minister to take ownership of the </p>
<p>overall policing strategy, including liaison with the US over national strategy, supported </p>
<p>by a dedicated team in London.</p>
<p><b>The MOD takes the lead for policing</b></p>
<p><b>106. </b> The critical importance of ISF capability in assessing readiness for transfer to </p>
<p>Provincial Iraqi Control, on which UK plans to draw down were based, was emphasised </p>
<p>by the ‘Conditions for Provincial Transfer’ published by the Joint Iraqi/MNF Committee </p>
<p>to Transfer Security Responsibility, and by Dr Reid, who told the Defence and Overseas </p>
<p>Policy Committee on Iraq (DOP(I)) on 12 October that “successful Iraqiisation remains </p>
<p>the key”.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> DOP(I) decided that Dr Reid should have lead responsibility for building the </p>
<p>capacity of the IPS in Basra in addition to his responsibility for the Iraqi Army.</p>
<p><b>107. </b> DOP(I) discussed the need “to do more to speed up the development of police” but </p>
<p>considered that “the plan for ISF development that was in place was largely sound”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Mr Blair asked for a major and sustained push to make progress on the ability of </p>
<p>the ISF to take the lead on security. </p>
<p><b>109. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, raised concerns about </p>
<p>ISF effectiveness in a minute to Gen Walker and concluded: “it is not to our credit </p>
<p>that we have known about the inadequacies of the IPS for so long and yet failed to </p>
<p>address them”.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>110. </b> At the same time, the JIC stated that the Iraqi armed forces stood at </p>
<p>91,000 personnel and MOI forces at 106,000 personnel, but that those figures did </p>
<p>not take account of absenteeism or provide an indication of true capability. The IPS </p>
<p>suffered from divided loyalties and a significant number were involved in criminality for </p>
<p>financial gain.</p>
<p><b>111. </b> In MND(SE), there was a lack of confidence that plans to tackle corruption </p>
<p>within the IPS were working. There were questions about whether the IPS should be </p>
<p>disbanded and started from scratch. Major General James Dutton, General Officer </p>
<p>Commanding MND(SE) (GOC MND(SE)) from June 2005 to December 2005, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry that was why he had proposed a three&#8209;point plan on 24 October. It was more </p>
<p>focused on reform than re&#8209;design and reflected the new approach that “we should be </p>
<p>aiming for a police force that is relevant and ‘good enough’ for this region”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>112. </b> The need for a single SSR strategy was raised again by Sir Ronnie Flanagan </p>
<p>when he visited Iraq in November to conduct another review of the effectiveness of the </p>
<p>UK’s policing strategy. In his final report of 31 January 2006, Sir Ronnie reported that a </p>

<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>435</p>
<p>broad strategic plan was being developed and the disconnected ways of working were </p>
<p>becoming a thing of the past. While that work may have been under way at that time, the </p>
<p>Inquiry has not seen any evidence of a national strategy being produced as a result.</p>
<p><b>113. </b> By the end of 2005, Whitehall remained overly optimistic about ISF development. </p>
<p>In papers prepared for DOP(I) on 20 December, the MOD stated that the development </p>
<p>of the Iraqi Army remained on track for the fully funded and trained figure of 130,000 by </p>
<p>December 2006 and the IPS was making an increasingly significant contribution </p>
<p>although it was behind the Iraqi Army in development terms. There remained a </p>
<p>significant issue about whether the Iraqi Government and ministries had the capacity </p>
<p>to direct and sustain the civil and military security forces. That was alongside the risk of </p>
<p>increasing sectarianism and militia infiltration. </p>
<p><b>114. </b> Mr Blair told President Bush on 23 December: “The two clear messages were: the </p>
<p>vital nature of leadership of the MOI and MOD; and 2006 being the year of the police.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p><b>Preparation for withdrawal</b></p>
<p><b>“Good enough”</b></p>
<p><b>115. </b> In late 2005, General George Casey, who became Commander of the CJTF&#8209;7 </p>
<p>in June 2004, designated 2006 as the “Year of the Police”, recognising that a national </p>
<p>police force was vital to any exit strategy.</p>
<p><b>116. </b> From 2006, the UK appears to have stopped lobbying for the creation of a national </p>
<p>SSR strategy and instead focused on what was necessary to enable the withdrawal of </p>
<p>troops. Without a means to measure progress objectively, success continued to mean </p>
<p>the number of officers trained.</p>
<p><b>117. </b> Acting Deputy Chief Constable Colin Smith, Chief Police Adviser Iraq, wrote about </p>
<p>the Year of the Police in January 2006 that “the strap line that ‘just enough is good </p>
<p>enough’ is, whilst probably realistic, not particularly encouraging”.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> He wrote that it could </p>
<p>be “a defining factor in the development of an effective Iraqi Police Service”. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> In March 2006, Dr Reid continued to press ahead with drawdown and announced </p>
<p>that troop levels would reduce in May 2006 from approximately 8,000 to around </p>
<p>7,200 based on “completion of various security sector reform tasks, a reduction in </p>
<p>the support levels for those tasks, and recent efficiency measures in theatre”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> That </p>
<p>rationale did not include an assessment of the effect of those tasks on the capability of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>436</p>
<p><b>119. </b> The assessment of ISF capability from other sources was still discouraging:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Operation CORRODE, an operation aimed at removing corrupt police, proved </p>
<p>difficult to implement with limited political engagement in Basra. The JIC </p>
<p>afterwards reported that it suspected that officers had been reassigned rather </p>
<p>than removed.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The JIC reported that the ISF could cope with low&#8209;level threats but its readiness </p>
<p>to handle Shia extremists or intra&#8209;Shia violence was uncertain. Army command, </p>
<p>control and logistics capabilities were all still developing, making major </p>
<p>operations without MNF support difficult.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Robin Lamb, British Consul General in Basra, reported that local staff </p>
<p>regarded the IPS “as at best ineffective, and at worst complicit in the </p>
<p>assassinations. We would support that assessment”.</p>
<p><b>120. </b> The security situation in MND(SE) continued to decline in 2006, and the UK </p>
<p>continued to plan for drawdown. That is addressed in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> The MOD’s assessment in June was that the ISF programme was “on target to </p>
<p>complete by December 2006 with 80 percent of the ISF trained and equipped (less </p>
<p>the forces in Anbar province and the Air Force and Navy capability)”.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> The police were </p>
<p>“some way behind” but “significant progress” was expected by the end of the year. Their </p>
<p>effectiveness rested on their credibility with the Iraqi people, which was “increasing but </p>
<p>remain[ed] an issue”. The ISF should “be capable of managing the threat that they will </p>
<p>face but could be quickly undermined by poor leadership”.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> On 1 September, an eGram from the British Embassy Baghdad reported an </p>
<p>“important step psychologically”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> for the Iraqi military: the Iraqi Ground Forces </p>
<p>Command and Iraqi Ministry of Defence would commence “a staggered handover” of </p>
<p>command and control functions from MNF&#8209;I on 3 September. The Embassy stated that </p>
<p>“while the assumption of responsibility looks gradual and sensibly phased, in reality the </p>
<p>pace will be demanding to both MNF&#8209;I and the IGFC [Iraqi Ground Forces Command]”. </p>
<p>As “life support and logistics capabilities” were “developing at their own, much slower, </p>
<p>pace”, the Embassy predicted that “IA Divisions will remain dependent on MNF&#8209;I for </p>
<p>some time to come”.</p>
<p>BETTER BASRA</p>
<p><b>123. </b> In summer 2006, in recognition of the need to stabilise Basra and prepare it </p>
<p>for transition to Iraqi control, the UK developed the Basra Security Plan and Better </p>
<p>Basra Plan. The former was “a plan to improve Basra through operations, high impact </p>

<p> the military element of </p>
<p>which became known as Operation SALAMANCA and included operations against </p>
<p>militia groups. </p>
<p><b>124. </b> Major General Richard Shirreff, GOC MND(SE) from July 2006 until January 2007, </p>
<p>anticipated that during Op SALAMANCA there would be “a concerted and sustained </p>
<p>effort by Police Training Teams”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> to “turn those police stations capable of improvement </p>
<p>into police stations that are capable of providing basic security in their local areas”. </p>
<p>His aim was “to cull the unredeemable and rehabilitate the ‘just about’ salvageable”. </p>
<p><b>125. </b> In September, as set out in Section 9.8, the scope of Op SALAMANCA was </p>
<p>constrained. It later became known as Operation SINBAD. </p>
<p><b>126. </b> While most reports from theatre indicated that Op SINBAD had progressed well, </p>
<p>it does not appear to have created the significant development in the Iraqi Army’s </p>
<p>capability that had been desired. On 27 October, Mr Blair was informed that the Iraqi </p>
<p>Army had performed well in some areas but it still lacked maturity.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> Operations designed to weed out corrupt officers were only able to achieve limited </p>
<p>success because a proper governance structure within the ministries and judicial </p>
<p>system was lacking. Operation THYME in December 2006 sought to purge the Serious </p>
<p>Crime Unit of corrupt officers, but the DOP(I) was told in January 2007 that, although </p>
<p>arrest warrants had been issued for members of the Serious Crime Unit, they had not </p>
<p>been actioned. There were signs that those members of the Serious Crime Unit were </p>
<p>“continuing to operate”.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p><b>128. </b> Mr Blair stated that, during his visit to Iraq at the end of 2006, “he had sensed, </p>
<p>for the first time, that Iraqi Generals felt that if they were given the right training and </p>
<p>equipment they would be able to do the job”.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p><b>129. </b> On 24 January 2007, Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary from May 2006 </p>
<p>to October 2008, wrote to Mr Blair to update him on the rationale behind a planned </p>
<p>reduction in troops from 7,000 to 4,500&#8209;5,000:</p>
<p>“There is no question of us leaving a vacuum in the city [Basra], as the IA and </p>
<p>IPS are already doing patrols and we will remain present in the Provincial Joint </p>
<p>Co&#8209;ordination Centre and military transition teams. Early evidence from the final </p>
<p>stages of Op SINBAD, where the IA are in some areas not just in the lead but </p>
<p>doing it by themselves, is that inevitably they enjoy a greater level of consent than </p>
<p>we do – but also that they are doing a decent job. They are far from the finished </p>

<p>they continue to develop.”</p>
<p>72</p>
<p><b>130. </b> The third iteration of the Better Basra Plan was produced on 2 March 2007. It </p>
<p>looked to develop capacity and capability across wider SSR components, such as </p>
<p>the judiciary and prison service. It repeated the benchmark that the police would be </p>
<p>brought to a “good enough” standard to transition to Provincial Iraqi Control (PIC). It also </p>
<p>announced that over the next six months, the UK would be deploying military transition </p>
<p>teams (MiTTs) within the 10th Division of the Iraqi Army (see Box, ‘MiTTs’, below).</p>
<p><b>131. </b> In June, Major General Jonathan Shaw, GOC MND(SE) from January 2007 to </p>
<p>August 2007, stated that he was not convinced that the ISF was ready for transition. </p>
<p>That was in the light of the continuing decline in security. The US and parts of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government had serious concerns over the ability of the ISF in Basra to cope with the </p>
<p>security situation. </p>
<p><b>132. </b> Concerns continued to be raised about the security situation in MND(SE) and </p>
<p>that the ISF would not be able to maintain security alone. Mr Dominic Asquith, British </p>
<p>Ambassador to Iraq, reported in July that Basrawis had expressed the view to the </p>
<p>visiting House of Commons Defence Committee that “a British withdrawal would </p>
<p>‘be followed by chaos sweeping the province like a hurricane’”.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p><b>133. </b> On 8 October 2007, Mr Gordon Brown, who had become Prime Minister in </p>
<p>June, announced plans for a significant troop drawdown over the next 12 months. </p>
<p>He described the need for two remaining phases: </p>
<p>“In the first, the British forces that remain in Iraq will have the following tasks: training </p>
<p>and mentoring the Iraqi Army and police force; securing supply routes and policing </p>
<p>the Iran&#8209;Iraq border; and the ability to come to the assistance of the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces when called upon. Then in the spring of next year – and guided as always </p>
<p>by the advice of our military commanders – we plan to move to a second stage of </p>
<p>overwatch where the coalition would maintain a more limited re&#8209;intervention capacity </p>
<p>and where the main focus will be on training and mentoring.”</p>
<p>74</p>
<p><b>134. </b> On 9 October, Lieutenant General Sir Nicholas Houghton, Chief of Joint </p>
<p>Operations, briefed the Chiefs of Staff that the plan for the Iraqi 14th Division</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> would </p>
<p>see initial operating capability by December 2007, with training complete by June 2008.</p>

<p>The 10th Division was the Iraqi Army division in MND(SE) which had been trained by UK personnel. </p>
<p>It was given an additional brigade in June 2007 to create a new Division: 14th Division, which would </p>
<p>assume responsibility for Basra while 10th Division would be responsible for the rest of the South&#8209;East, </p>
<p>across Muthanna, Dhi Qar and Maysan provinces. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>439</p>
<p><b>135. </b> Basra transitioned to Provincial Iraqi Control on 16 December 2007. Maj Gen Binns </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that the ISF “were well trained, as individuals, but their leadership was </p>
<p>not experienced, they were capable of conducting tactical, low&#8209;level operations, but </p>
<p>their ability to conduct manoeuvre, to sustain themselves logistically, was a challenge to </p>
<p>them”.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> The police were “a mixed bag”.</p>
<p><b>136. </b> Reports on the ISF’s capability did not change materially in the period leading </p>
<p>up to the UK’s withdrawal. There remained concern over their ability and willingness </p>
<p>to maintain security in the South. When Mr Brown and Mr Browne had breakfast with </p>
<p>the Chiefs of Staff on 6 March 2008, the Chiefs told them that “there was quality in the </p>
<p>ISF but it was not broadening as rapidly as hoped, so training and mentoring of 14Div </p>
<p>remained a vital job”.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>137. </b> On 2 April, a junior official in PJHQ wrote to Mr Browne, advising him that </p>
<p>MND(SE) was intending to embed MiTTs within 14th Division to strengthen some of the </p>
<p>key vulnerabilities that had been demonstrated during the recent operation, Operation </p>
<p>Charge of the Knights. That decision is addressed in the Box below. The operation and </p>
<p>its impact are described in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>MiTTs</b></p>
<p>The concept of military transition teams (MiTTs), in which US military personnel were </p>
<p>embedded within Iraqi fighting units, was first put forward by the US in early 2005. It was </p>
<p>seen as a successful tactic, and had been used by the UK in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Although the UK deployed MiTTs to work with 10th Division during the summer of 2007, </p>
<p>it did not adopt the same approach for 14th Division until April 2008, choosing instead to </p>
<p>focus on leadership and embedding UK personnel at brigade and divisional level.</p>
<p>The different approaches taken by the UK and the US between 2005 and 2007 again </p>
<p>demonstrated the lack of coherence across the SSR effort. It also created tensions with </p>
<p>the US who believed that the UK had not adopted the same approach because of an </p>
<p>aversion to casualties. </p>
<p><b>138. </b> By mid&#8209;April, confidence in the IPS was so low that Major General Barney </p>
<p>White&#8209;Spunner, GOC MND(SE) from February 2008 to May 2008, warned that there </p>
<p>were discussions in Multi&#8209;National Corps&#8209;Iraq (MNC&#8209;I) and the Iraqi Government over </p>
<p>whether to disband the Basra police entirely and start again. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> On 14 May, the JIC stated that public confidence in the ISF had grown but the </p>
<p>same concerns remained about how it would fare against Jaysh al&#8209;Mahdi (JAM) </p>
<p>resistance.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>440</p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr John Hutton, the Defence Secretary, wrote to Mr Brown after he visited Iraq </p>
<p>in October:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), the Army in particular, are looking confident and </p>
<p>capable. Their show of force in the areas which I visited, where they took the lead </p>
<p>in providing my security, was genuinely impressive. There is no doubt that Basra </p>
<p>itself has been transformed and the ISF now have complete freedom of movement </p>
<p>throughout the city. While they do not yet have all the capabilities that we would like </p>
<p>to see in a fully&#8209;formed Division, and there is important work still to do, we will soon </p>
<p>have reached the point where we can say with confidence that we have fulfilled our </p>
<p>training mission for 14 Division …”</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>141. </b> On 27 March 2009, a junior official informed Mr Brown that 14th Division was </p>
<p>considered to be effective and that all UK mentors and trainers had been withdrawn.</p>
<p><b>Security Sector Reform strategy</b></p>
<p><b>142. </b> Between 2003 and 2009, there was no coherent US/UK strategy for SSR in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> In 2003, the UK expected the production of an SSR strategy to be led by the </p>
<p>US and, when it was clear that one did not exist, was unable to exert the necessary </p>
<p>influence on the CPA in Baghdad to ensure that one was developed. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> As a consequence, instead of working within an SSR framework that was </p>
<p>understood and agreed between international partners, the UK developed its own SSR </p>
<p>policies and plans for MND(SE) without a clear understanding of how they contributed </p>
<p>to – or whether they were fully consistent with – the SSR approach across Iraq. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> Without a coherent US/UK strategy for SSR, the UK was unable to fully understand </p>
<p>its role and how or whether its plans contributed to the overall rebuilding of Iraq’s </p>
<p>security sector. It was unclear what success looked like and therefore how to measure it. </p>
<p><b>146. </b> The development of effective Iraqi Security Forces, which could take the lead on </p>
<p>security very rapidly, became a key element of the UK’s “exit strategy” for Iraq. In the </p>
<p>absence of a clearly defined end state, and driven by the desire to reduce UK troop </p>
<p>levels, the focus of SSR work became the quantity of officers trained, not their quality. </p>
<p>There were numerous warning signs that that was a flawed approach, including reports </p>
<p>directly from those on the ground and JIC Assessments. But there was a reluctance to </p>
<p>pause and consider what was required to deliver the quality needed. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> After June 2004, it became even more challenging to reach consensus on a </p>
<p>strategy for SSR with the establishment of the Interim Iraqi Government, another party </p>
<p>that was expected to take the lead on developing a national SSR strategy. That did not </p>
<p>happen.</p>
<p>78 </p>
<p>Letter Hutton to Brown, 23 October 2008, [untitled]. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>12.2  |  Conclusions: Security Sector Reform</p>
<p>441</p>
<p><b>148. </b> Underlying problems with SSR started to be more clearly visible: the simple metrics </p>
<p>used to gauge success during the CPA era had obscured the actual number of trained </p>
<p>police officers; the integrity of many police officers was in doubt; and the Iraqi ministries </p>
<p>responsible for the ISF were dysfunctional. These issues had not been gripped because </p>
<p>the Coalition had focused too simply on the number of officers.</p>
<p><b>149. </b> Sir Ronnie Flanagan’s review in November 2005 appears to be the last serious </p>
<p>attempt to argue that there should be a single, coherent policy on SSR in Iraq. Although </p>
<p>Sir Ronnie’s final report in January 2006 stated that a broad strategic plan was being </p>
<p>prepared in conjunction with the Interim Iraqi Government, subsequent SSR strategy </p>
<p>remained largely incoherent.</p>
<p><b>150. </b> Sir Ronnie’s final report came at a crucial time. The December 2005 Parliamentary </p>
<p>election signalled a shift to greater Iraqi political independence. In January 2006 the UK </p>
<p>Cabinet approved the deployment of UK troops to Helmand province in Afghanistan. The </p>
<p>UK’s SSR objective in Iraq became almost exclusively to demonstrate that the conditions </p>
<p>for withdrawal were met. The requirement for a coherent SSR strategy which would </p>
<p>establish viable long&#8209;term Iraqi Security Forces was set aside. </p>
<p><b>Measuring success</b></p>
<p><b>151. </b> After six years in Iraq, it was difficult to judge what the UK had achieved in the field </p>
<p>of SSR. While the number of police appeared to have increased and the Iraqi Army’s </p>
<p>confidence had undoubtedly grown, without a clearly defined end state for either there </p>
<p>was not an appropriate benchmark by which the UK could measure whether it had </p>
<p>achieved what it set out to do. </p>
<p><b>152. </b> The UK knew that the capability of the ISF was critical to withdrawal but did not </p>
<p>design an effective way by which it could measure that capability. Judgements were </p>
<p>based mainly on reports from theatre – the authors of which were also without a formal </p>
<p>means of measuring the ISF’s capability. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> Focusing on the number of trained officers was a problem in Iraq because it was </p>
<p>too simplistic. It hid many of the complexities that sat behind and skewed the numbers. </p>
<p>The UK was unable to adjust that approach in Iraq because, up to 2006 (after which </p>
<p>point its ambitions for SSR changed), it never truly understood what measurements </p>
<p>would indicate whether the ISF was capable of maintaining security in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> After 2006, “good enough” for Iraq informally became the benchmark. It was never </p>
<p>clear exactly what that meant. This loose benchmark was used as a justification for </p>
<p>continuing to plan for withdrawal in the face of contradictory evidence.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> In 2009, the fragility of the situation in Basra, which had been the focus of UK effort </p>
<p>in MND(SE), was clear. Threats to its security remained. The ISF continued to be reliant </p>
<p>on support from Multi&#8209;National Forces to address weaknesses in leadership and tactical </p>
<p>support. If the capabilities of the ISF had been good enough, it seems unlikely that the </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>442</p>
<p>US would have embarked on the action that it did – to deploy its own forces to Basra </p>
<p>when the UK withdrew, so as to secure the border and protect supply lines. The US and </p>
<p>the UK appear to have had different definitions of what “good enough” meant.</p>
<p><b>Lessons</b></p>
<p><b>156. </b> In Section 6.5, the Inquiry states that better planning and preparation for a </p>
<p>post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq would not necessarily have prevented the events that </p>
<p>unfolded in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. It would not have been possible for the UK </p>
<p>to prepare for every eventuality. However, better plans and preparation could have </p>
<p>mitigated some of the risks to which the UK and Iraq were exposed between 2003 and </p>
<p>2009 and increased the likelihood of achieving the outcomes desired by the UK and the </p>
<p>Iraqi people.</p>
<p><b>157. </b> The lessons identified by the Inquiry with regards to planning and preparation for </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict operations are described in Section 10.4. Those lessons, which focus on </p>
<p>the essential tasks that should be undertaken, also apply to SSR planning.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> An SSR strategy should define the functions of different elements of the relevant </p>
<p>security sector and the structures needed to perform those functions. Considering those </p>
<p>questions should drive a robust debate about how security requirements might change </p>
<p>over time. </p>
<p><b>159. </b> An understanding of the many different models that exist internationally for </p>
<p>internal security, policing and criminal justice is essential. But those models cannot </p>
<p>be considered in isolation because what works in one country will not necessarily </p>
<p>work in another which may have very different traditions. It is therefore critical for the </p>
<p>SSR strategy to take full account of the history, culture and inherited practices of the </p>
<p>country or region in question. The strategy also needs to be informed by the views and </p>
<p>aspirations of the local population. </p>
<p><b>160. </b> A strategy should set out the desired operating standard for each function and </p>
<p>state how that differs, if at all, from what exists. In doing so, the strategy should specify </p>
<p>where capacity needs to be developed and inform a serious assessment of how the </p>
<p>material resources available could best be deployed. </p>
<p><b>161. </b> It is essential that the UK has an appropriate way to measure the success of any </p>
<p>SSR plan. If a clear strategy is in place and has taken account of the views of the local </p>
<p>population, the indicators of that success should be obvious. It should rarely concentrate </p>
<p>on a one&#8209;dimensional set of numbers but instead be a more qualitative and rounded </p>
<p>assessment.</p>
