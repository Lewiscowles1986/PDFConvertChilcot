<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>374</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> Section 10 addresses the UK contribution to humanitarian assistance and </p>
<p>reconstruction in Iraq between 2003 and 2009:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 10.1 covers the period between March 2003 and the end of the </p>
<p>Occupation of Iraq in June 2004.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Section 10.2 continues the story from July 2004 to 2009.</p>
<p><b>2. </b> Sections 10.1 and 10.2 consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development and implementation of UK reconstruction policy, strategy and </p>
<p>plans;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with the US on reconstruction, including with the US-led </p>
<p>Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and the Coalition </p>
<p>Provisional Authority (CPA); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s engagement with successive Iraqi Governments on reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>3. </b> Section 10.3 addresses five issues in more detail:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK policy on Iraq’s oil and oil revenues; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Government’s support for UK business in securing reconstruction contracts; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>debt relief; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>asylum; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reform of the Government’s approach to post-conflict reconstruction and </p>
<p>stabilisation.</p>
<p><b>4. </b> Those issues are addressed separately from the main reconstruction narrative, </p>
<p>in order to provide a clearer account of the development of the UK’s engagement. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> This Section does not consider:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>planning and preparing to provide humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, </p>
<p>which is addressed in Sections 6.4 and 6.5;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the financial and human resources available for post-conflict reconstruction, </p>
<p>addressed in Sections 13 and 15 respectively; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification and Security Sector Reform, addressed in Sections 11 and </p>
<p>12 respectively; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>wider UK policy towards Iraq in the post-conflict period, addressed in Section 9. </p>

<p><b>UK policy on Iraq’s oil and oil revenues</b></p>
<p><b>Iraq oil reserves, production and export</b></p>
<p><b>6. </b> A January 2002 Ministry of Defence (MOD) Defence Intelligence Service (DIS) report </p>
<p>on Iraq’s infrastructure stated that Iraq held the second largest proven oil reserves in the </p>
<p>world at approximately 115bn barrels, equating to 11 percent of total world oil reserves.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It also held two percent of total world gas reserves. There were potentially larger </p>
<p>reserves as many areas were underdeveloped.</p>
<p><b>7. </b> The report estimated that crude oil production was approximately 2.8m barrels per </p>
<p>day (bpd). Of that, Iraq exported approximately 2.4m bpd under the Oil-for-Food (OFF) </p>
<p>programme. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> The report also stated that Iraq’s oil and gas infrastructure was in a generally poor </p>
<p>state of repair. </p>
<p><b>9. </b> A November 2002 Trade Partners UK (TPUK) paper advised that:</p>
<p>“… exploration in Iraq is relatively immature and yet-to-find (YTF) reserves have </p>
<p>been estimated at between 50[bn] and 200bn barrels of oil. This magnitude of </p>
<p>YTF reserves is unmatched anywhere in the world. </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Based on these reserves Iraq has the potential to be an extremely important future </p>
<p>player in the supply of oil and gas to world markets …</p>
<p>“Despite the vast sums required to develop Iraq’s reserves, there is a great deal of </p>
<p>interest from International Oil Companies to become involved in this [investment in </p>
<p>Iraq’s oil infrastructure]. This is based on the fact that, although modern technologies </p>
<p>will be required to undertake the work, Iraq’s reserves are considered amongst the </p>
<p>cheapest in the world to develop, driven by having large, onshore fields with simple </p>
<p>geological structure.”</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><b>10. </b> Iraqi oil production and revenues from oil exports for selected years between 1989 </p>
<p>and 2009 are set out in Table 1, later in this Section. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>376</p>
<p><b>The Oil-for-Food (OFF) Programme </b></p>
<p>The OFF programme was established by resolution 986 in April 1995.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> Implementation </p>
<p>began in May 1996 after the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between the </p>
<p>UN and the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p>The programme allowed for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the export of Iraqi oil;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the deposit of oil revenues into a UN-controlled account; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the use of those revenues to procure food, medicine and other goods approved by </p>
<p>the UN. </p>
<p>Under the UN sanctions regime, the OFF programme was the only legal way to export </p>
<p>Iraqi oil.</p>
<p>In the period running up to the invasion of Iraq, the UK assessed that 60 percent of Iraqi </p>
<p>people relied on supplies distributed under the OFF programme.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>UK energy security interests, 2001 to 2002</b></p>
<p><b>11. </b> Sections 1.1 and 1.2 describe the increasing challenges from 1999 to the US/UK </p>
<p>policy for the containment of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>12. </b> In January 2001, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s (FCO’s) Middle East </p>
<p>Department drew up an internal paper for a meeting of the FCO Policy Board, which </p>
<p>reassessed the UK’s “fundamental interests” in relation to Iraq and recommended a new </p>
<p>approach to promoting them.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> The UK’s interests were identified as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>regional stability, including through the non-proliferation of Weapons of Mass </p>
<p>Destruction (WMD);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>energy security: the region accounted for 33 percent of the world’s oil production </p>
<p>and 66 percent of world oil reserves;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “level playing field” for UK companies: at its peak, UK trade with Iraq was </p>
<p>US$500m a year;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preserving the credibility and authority of the UN Security Council; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining the coherence of UK policy, including on human rights, adherence </p>
<p>to UN Security Council resolutions, and non-proliferation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the humanitarian and human rights situation in Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>avoiding a US/UK split; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reducing the UK’s isolation in the European Union (EU). </p>

<p>10.3  |  Reconstruction: oil, commercial interests, debt relief, asylum and stabilisation policy </p>
<p>377</p>
<p><b>13. </b> Sections 3.1 and 3.2 describe how, following the attacks on the US by Al Qaida on </p>
<p>11 September 2001, the US moved away from pursuing a policy of containment and </p>
<p>towards a policy of taking direct action against Iraq, and the UK’s response to that shift. </p>
<p><b>14. </b> In February 2002, No.10 commissioned a “large number of papers”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>for the meeting </p>
<p>between President Bush and Mr Blair at Crawford, Texas, which was scheduled to be </p>
<p>held in early April.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>15. </b> Those papers included: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p><b>Iraq</b> … the options, the state of play on the UN Resolutions, the legal base and </p>
<p>the internal dimension – the state of the opposition groups etc.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>•<b> </b></p>
<p><b>Oil and energy</b> … who are the producers, which states are Europe and the US </p>
<p>most dependent on, the state of play in developing countries with oil reserves, </p>
<p>pipelines …”</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>16. </b> The Cabinet Office’s ‘Iraq: Options Paper’, which is described in detail in </p>
<p>Section 3.2, identified two broad policy options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>toughen the existing containment policy, or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seek regime change.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. </b> The paper defined the current objectives of UK policy towards Iraq, and set them </p>
<p>within the context of the broader UK objectives of “preserving peace and stability in the </p>
<p>Gulf and ensuring energy security”.</p>
<p><b>18. </b> Apart from that reference to energy security, the paper did not consider oil or energy </p>
<p>security. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The FCO’s Forward Strategy Unit (FSU) produced a paper on the security of global </p>
<p>oil supply which considered a number of risks to the supply of oil, including a “sustained </p>
<p>Allied attack on Iraq”.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> The paper concluded:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any step increase in price likely to be unsustainable.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sufficient production and substantial spare capacity in other oil producing </p>
<p>countries to meet demand.” </p>
<p><b>20. </b> The Options Paper and the FSU paper were submitted to Mr Blair on 8 March 2002 </p>
<p>alongside seven other “background briefs that you asked for”, for the meeting with </p>
<p>President Bush.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>378</p>
<p><b>21. </b> Mr Blair sent a minute to Mr Jonathan Powell, his Chief of Staff, on 17 March setting </p>
<p>out three points in response to the briefing papers that he had received:</p>
<p>“(1) </p>
<p>In all my papers I do not have a proper worked-out strategy on how we would </p>
<p>do it. The US do not either, but before I go [to Crawford], I need to be able to </p>
<p>provide them with a far more intelligent and detailed analysis of a game plan … </p>
<p>(2) </p>
<p>The persuasion job on this seems very tough … </p>
<p>(3) </p>
<p>Oil prices. This is my big domestic worry. We must concert with the US to get </p>
<p>action from others to push the price back down. Higher petrol prices really might </p>
<p>put the public off.”</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>A copy of the minute was sent to Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser </p>
<p>and Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec) in the Cabinet Office. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> Asked to clarify what “it” was that required a proper worked-out strategy, Mr Blair </p>
<p>told the Inquiry: “How we would either get Saddam to cease being a threat peacefully </p>
<p>or to get him out by force.”</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Michael Arthur, FCO Economic Director, sent Sir David a paper on the economic </p>
<p>effects of military action against Iraq on 26 March.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> Mr Arthur assessed that:</p>
<p>“Iraq produces c2.5m bpd, a bit over 3 percent of world supply. Military action may </p>
<p>well lead to a reduction or cut-off in its exports either directly or by way of Iraqi </p>
<p>retaliation.</p>
<p>“There is likely to be an immediate spike in oil prices … provided the conflict does </p>
<p>not spill over into the Gulf and threaten the flow of supplies through the Straits of </p>
<p>Hormuz – the spike could be very short-lived.”</p>
<p><b>24. </b> A protracted, regional conflict would pose a more serious threat to oil prices and </p>
<p>the world economy. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> The paper also highlighted the economic consequences for Iraq’s neighbours, </p>
<p>particularly Jordan.</p>
<p><b>26. </b> Mr John Scarlett, the Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), responded </p>
<p>to a request from Sir David for an update on Iraq’s oil production, the importance of oil </p>
<p>revenue to the Iraqi regime, and the effect of a halt in Iraqi oil exports on the world oil </p>
<p>market, on 4 April.</p>

<p>10.3  |  Reconstruction: oil, commercial interests, debt relief, asylum and stabilisation policy </p>
<p>379</p>
<p><b>27. </b> Mr Scarlett advised that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq exported considerable quantities of oil – perhaps as much as 400,000 bpd </p>
<p>in 2001 – illegally. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein’s regime gained some illegal revenue by applying surcharges </p>
<p>to OFF programme trade. It also controlled the distribution of goods purchased </p>
<p>under the OFF programme, adding to its ability to offer patronage. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>While a sudden cut in Iraqi oil exports would cause a temporary spike in the oil </p>
<p>price, the price rise would be “moderate” (less than US$5 a barrel).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The duration of the spike would be determined by market expectations which </p>
<p>were already influenced by “jitters over the Middle East and talk of war with </p>
<p>Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>28. </b> Sir David passed Mr Scarlett’s note to Mr Blair the following day.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs, sent Mr Blair </p>
<p>an updated briefing pack for the meetings at Crawford on 4 April.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p> For Iraq, that included </p>
<p>“further background papers on ensuring the security of energy supply”.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> Those further background papers are likely to have been the papers provided by </p>
<p>Mr Arthur and Mr Scarlett. </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Section 3.2 describes the discussions between President Bush and Mr Blair at </p>
<p>Crawford from 5 to 7 April. </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that there had been “a general discussion of the possibility </p>
<p>of going down the military route but obviously, we were arguing for that to be if the UN </p>
<p>route failed”.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that issues relating to energy security or oil </p>
<p>were discussed at the meetings. </p>
<p><b>Planning and preparing for a post-conflict Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>34. </b> In mid-June 2002, the MOD’s Strategic Planning Group issued a paper on UK </p>
<p>military strategic thinking on Iraq to a limited number of senior MOD addressees.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>35. </b> The paper stated that with significant potential oil revenues, Iraq’s reconstruction </p>
<p>should be “self-sufficient”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>380</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The paper listed likely immediate, medium-term and long-term military post-conflict </p>
<p>tasks. The immediate (up to six months) tasks included:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assist in restoration of key infrastructure elements; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>secure oilfields and oil distribution/refining infrastructure.” </p>
<p><b>37. </b> The medium-term (six months to two years) tasks included: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>begin transfer [of] security of oilfields and production facilities to Iraqi forces.”</p>
<p><b>38. </b> The paper was revised five times between June and December 2002. </p>
<p>The December 2002 version of the paper replaced the tasks listed above with a </p>
<p>single “Military Line of Operation” for infrastructure security, which extended into </p>
<p>the long term.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>39. </b> At his request, Mr Blair received a pack of reading material on Iraq at the beginning </p>
<p>of August 2002. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> The reading pack included a January 2002 DIS report on Iraq’s infrastructure.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The report had been produced in response to the ongoing requirement on DIS to </p>
<p>maintain and update information to support possible future military operations.</p>
<p><b>41. </b> The DIS report stated that Iraq’s oil and gas industry had suffered substantial </p>
<p>damage during the Iran/Iraq and Gulf wars, and recovery had been slow. A “recent </p>
<p>UN report” had assessed that the general state of the Iraqi oil industry had declined </p>
<p>seriously over the previous 18 months and that urgent measures were needed to avoid </p>
<p>further deterioration of oil wells and the petroleum infrastructure. Of the 12 oil refineries </p>
<p>in Iraq, only three were operational.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> An FCO Economic Adviser produced an assessment of short- and long-term </p>
<p>economic consequences of military action for the region and for Iraq on 29 August.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The assessment identified a number of potential short-term consequences of military </p>
<p>action including a rise in oil prices and the disruption of the OFF programme. </p>
<p><b>43. </b> Copies of the assessment were sent to FCO officials and, separately, to TPUK. </p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen no indication that copies were sent to other departments.</p>

<p>381</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The Treasury paper stated that Iraq’s economy was distinguished by the dominance </p>
<p>of oil and gas revenues. Iraq currently produced around 2.5m bpd, though this </p>
<p>“fluctuated wildly” as Iraq used oil production as a bargaining tool in negotiations with </p>
<p>the UN over the operation of the OFF programme. Around 2.25m bpd were exported. </p>
<p>Oil revenues represented 60 percent of Iraq’s GDP and 95 percent of its foreign </p>
<p>currency earnings.</p>
<p><b>46. </b> Oil markets already thought that war with Iraq was probable, driving up prices </p>
<p>to around US$27 per barrel. Globally, a conflict could lead to a rise in the oil price of </p>

<p><b>48. </b> The Treasury advised that recent experience suggested that the cost of “putting a </p>
<p>country back on its feet” could be high. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had already </p>
<p>received US$10bn in support. Iraq could be “even more expensive”, given:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility that a conflict could cause significant damage, and the existing </p>
<p>poor state of Iraq’s infrastructure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to stabilise the economy, including by addressing Iraq’s huge external </p>
<p>debt;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a large peace-keeping force “to keep a lid on the ethnic and </p>
<p>religious tensions that Saddam’s dictatorship has hidden for so long”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the pressure for a “generous [reconstruction] package, given the perception </p>
<p>in the region that invading Iraq is of dubious legality and worth”.</p>
<p><b>49. </b> On who would pay for that generous package, the Treasury assessed that: </p>
<p>“… the US might expect Iraq to pick up the bill after a short ‘bridging’ period, </p>
<p>especially as – with investment – oil revenues could quickly exceed US$20 billion </p>
<p>per year.</p>
<p>“But it is more likely that strong pressure will come to bear on the US and its allies </p>
<p>to pay the lion’s share, given their role in the war …”</p>

<p><b>66. </b> In his covering minute, Mr Cunliffe advised that the Treasury’s main concern related </p>
<p>to its “ability to maintain sound public finances, especially in the more pessimistic </p>
<p>cases”. There would be some risk to the “Golden Rule” in all three war scenarios; the </p>
<p>risk would be much greater if a war involved WMD. Mr Cunliffe concluded by suggesting </p>
<p>that Mr Brown might want to warn colleagues about the risk to public finances.</p>
<p><b>67. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence that Mr Brown took any action as a result of </p>
<p>Mr Cunliffe’s advice. </p>
<p><b>68. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Jon Cunliffe described the oil market as the </p>
<p>“main transmission mechanism” from a conflict in Iraq to the world economy:</p>
<p>“There are general confidence effects [on markets]; markets don’t like wars, they </p>
<p>don’t like political situations they can’t read, but … the more concrete transmission </p>
<p>channel through which a crisis … would impact the global economy, we thought </p>
<p>would be oil and oil price shock …</p>
<p>“We modelled that quite closely …”</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>69. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Jon whether the Treasury had done any work on the benefits </p>
<p>of a conflict in Iraq to UK energy supply or to the UK oil industry. He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“No, the only thing that I think comes close is that, in the fiscal impacts of a crisis, </p>
<p>a high oil price benefits the UK, because we are an oil producer and we have tax </p>
<p>and licence revenues, so we took that upside. That’s one of the reasons why the </p>
<p>impact on the UK economy is not straightforward. So we took into account what </p>
<p>would happen with an oil price spike. It would actually mean damage to the UK </p>
<p>economy, but more revenue coming in, but we weren’t trying to do an exercise about </p>
<p>the economic pros and cons of the war. That was not the object of the exercise.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>386</p>
<p><b>79. </b> Mr Blair and Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, held an off-the-record seminar </p>
<p>on Iraq with six academics on 19 November. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Rycroft advised Mr Blair that No.10 had issued a set of eight questions as an </p>
<p>agenda for the seminar, including:</p>
<p>“Post-Saddam, how quickly would the Iraqi economy revive? Who would control </p>
<p>the oil etc?”</p>
<p>36</p>
<p><b>81. </b> Mr Rycroft annotated that question in his advice to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“BP and others are fretting that they will lose out in the carve-up of contracts after </p>
<p>any military action, as the UK did after the Gulf war … We don’t need to get into the </p>
<p>detail of this, but we need to know what the main economic constraints would be </p>
<p>in rebuilding Iraq and how economic issues would drive the model of governance </p>
<p>chosen.”</p>
<p><b>82. </b> The concerns of UK oil companies and their discussions with the UK Government </p>
<p>are described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>83. </b> Not all the questions posed by No.10 were addressed at the seminar.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p> Mr Rycroft’s </p>
<p>record of the seminar reported the view that changing Iraq substantively would mean </p>
<p>tackling the political economy of oil, which led to a highly centralised bureaucracy and </p>
<p>the power of patronage. </p>
<p><b>84. </b> Mr Arnab Banerji, an adviser in No.10, sent Mr Blair a detailed assessment of the </p>
<p>economic impact on the UK of war in Iraq on 19 December.</p>
<p>38</p>
<p> Mr Banerji concluded: </p>
<p>“A short successful war with Iraq is likely to pose little strain on the UK economy. </p>
<p>Following such a conflict a combination of lower oil prices and increased business </p>
<p>confidence should provide a boost to the world economy. This in turn would feed into </p>
<p>higher UK growth in both 2003 and 2004.</p>
<p>“An extended or inconclusive conflict would have negative consequences for the </p>
<p>world economy and damage the UK. If oil prices remain in the US$30 – US$45 [per </p>
<p>barrel] range for a year then UK growth rates are expected to be about 1.0 percent </p>
<p>lower than anticipated for both 2003 and 2004.”</p>
<p>That price range compared with a UK forecast of US$20 to US$25 per barrel by the end </p>
<p>of 2003. </p>

<p>reported US State Department (but not yet agreed US Government) views by telegram </p>
<p>on 23 December.</p>
<p>39</p>
<p> The main policy points included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Provided the war was short, the US State Department did not anticipate </p>
<p>a dramatic impact on oil prices. They were ready to intervene in the market </p>
<p>as necessary. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Control of the oil sector should be put back into Iraqi hands as soon as possible. </p>
<p>As far as possible, any major decisions should be postponed until control was </p>
<p>handed back. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the interim there should be a clear international role to maximise transparency </p>
<p>and minimise charges that the US went to war for oil. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US would “respect the concerns of those countries with existing contracts”. </p>
<p><b>86. </b> A No.10 official wrote to Sir David Manning on 8 January 2003, to express his </p>
<p>concern about the US plan to set up a US-administered trust fund for Iraqi oil revenues.</p>
<p>40</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The official argued that:</p>
<p>“… we should be working hard to persuade the US that, whilst a trust fund to ensure </p>
<p>the Iraqi people benefit from oil export revenues is a good idea, it is very much in </p>
<p>the US’s (and by extension the UK’s) political interests to get this done through a UN </p>
<p>forum … If control was handed to the UN, it would be much more difficult to maintain </p>
<p>the argument that this is about oil.”</p>

<p> Mr Hoon stated that the US </p>
<p>had asked the UK to provide a ground force to take on a key role in southern Iraq. </p>
<p>He described the proposed UK Area of Responsibility in the south as “a coherent one”, </p>
<p>which included:</p>
<p>“… economic infrastructure critical to Iraq’s future, including much of its oil reserves, </p>
<p>critical communications nodes, a city (Basra) of 1.3 million people and a port (Umm </p>
<p>Qasr) about the size of Southampton. Although the establishment of UK control over </p>
<p>this area will require careful presentation to rebut any allegations of selfish motives, </p>
<p>we will be playing a vital role in shaping a better future for Iraq and its people.”</p>
<p><b>97. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair the following day in response to Mr Hoon’s letter, setting </p>
<p>out three concerns, including: </p>
<p>“… much greater clarity is required about US thinking and plans for the aftermath </p>
<p>… We need in particular far greater clarity on US thinking on management of the </p>
<p>oilfields.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>98. </b> Mr Hoon’s recommendations were endorsed by Mr Blair on 17 January,</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>100. </b> At the first FCO Iraq Morning Meeting after his return from Washington, Mr Ricketts </p>
<p>reported that:</p>
<p>“… the US show no sign of accepting our arguments on transitional administrations. </p>
<p>They are wedded to the idea of a prolonged US Occupation, and opposed to any </p>
<p>substantial role for the UN. We are likely to find the 22 January day after talks hard </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>390</p>
<p>number of issues still to be resolved, organised under five headings: security; relief and </p>
<p>reconstruction; political; economic; and environmental.</p>
<p><b>103. </b> Under the relief and reconstruction heading, the paper stated that the UK would </p>
<p>like the OFF programme, funded by Iraqi oil revenues, to continue to meet humanitarian </p>
<p>needs in the post-conflict period. Its ability to do so would depend on the extent of </p>
<p>the disruption caused by any conflict. Looking further ahead, the OFF programme </p>
<p>was not designed to support reconstruction. The extent of external funding required </p>
<p>for reconstruction would depend on Iraqi oil revenues, UN compensation claims and </p>
<p>external debt obligations. The UK would be able to provide only a limited contribution </p>
<p>to “total costs”. There might be scope for Iraq to borrow against future oil revenues to </p>
<p>finance reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Under the economic heading, the paper stated that a key task would be to </p>
<p>maximise Iraq oil revenues, consistent with the effect on the global market. The Coalition </p>
<p>would need to consider whether that was best achieved by returning control of Iraqi oil </p>
<p>exports from an international civilian administration to an Iraqi administration rapidly or </p>
<p>in slower time. The Coalition would also need to consider how the competing calls on </p>
<p>oil revenues of debt repayment and reconstruction should be balanced.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> Under the environmental heading, the paper asked whether there was an </p>
<p>environmental clean-up plan. </p>
<p><b>106. </b> On 20 January, President Bush issued National Security Presidential Directive 24, </p>
<p>consolidating all post-conflict activity in the new DoD-owned Office of Reconstruction </p>
<p>and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA).</p>
<p>55</p>
<p> President Bush had decided in principle to </p>
<p>place the DoD in charge of all post-conflict activity in December 2002. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> Lieutenant General (retired) Jay Garner was appointed to lead ORHA.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p><b>108. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on the outcome of the 22 January talks </p>
<p>on post-conflict planning: </p>
<p>“Overall, US Day After planning is still lagging far behind military planning.  </p>
<p>But they have agreed to two working groups: on the UN dimension; and on </p>
<p>economic reconstruction issues … </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The US were clear that the OFF [programme] would have to be maintained.  </p>
<p>There would need to be debt rescheduling. There were many questions to be </p>
<p>resolved on oil production and revenues. The US fully accepted the need for </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>109. </b> Mr Chaplin advised Mr Straw that: “Given that military action could start within a </p>
<p>few weeks, we agreed to have the first meetings of these [working] groups next week, </p>
<p>if possible.”</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>110. </b> Reports from the British Embassy Washington in late January highlighted the </p>
<p>question of who would manage the oil sector in the post-conflict period. </p>
<p><b>111. </b> A joint MOD/Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) delegation attended a </p>
<p>Phase IV planning conference at CENTCOM from 23 to 24 January.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> The conference </p>
<p>considered Phase IV planning in more detail than the 22 January talks. </p>
<p><b>112. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on the discussions on Phase IV </p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p> The “Energy and Infrastructure Planning Group” based in DoD was  </p>
<p>co-ordinating work on the oil sector. A comprehensive plan had been presented to </p>
<p>President Bush. A specialised contractor had been identified to carry out emergency </p>
<p>repairs. It had still not been decided “who or what” would be in overall charge of the </p>
<p>oil sector, although President Bush had agreed that a “CEO” would be needed. </p>
<p><b>113. </b> The Embassy reported that the “underlying” US objective was to get “operations </p>
<p>back in the hands of the local workforce as soon as possible”. The US Administration </p>
<p>recognised the need to restore oil production and exports to generate revenue; the </p>
<p>aim was to “quickly achieve” 2.1m bpd, and to be prepared to increase production </p>
<p>to 3.1m bpd. </p>
<p><b>114. </b> A BP team briefed UK Government officials on prospects for the Iraq energy sector </p>
<p>on 23 January.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> The briefing identified “two opposing views current in Washington”, </p>
<p>which it characterised as “hawkish” (espoused by the DoD, the NSC and others) </p>
<p>and “doveish” (espoused by the US State Department). The hawkish view sought a </p>
<p>significant increase in Iraqi oil production to push down oil prices, privatisation within </p>
<p>the oil sector, and external engagement led by the US (and possibly the UK) rather than </p>
<p>the UN. </p>
<p><b>115. </b> The BP team estimated that Iraqi oil production could rise from around 2.8m bpd </p>
<p>currently to around 3.5m bpd within two years and 4m bpd within five years. Significant </p>
<p>investment was required. UK officials pressed the BP team on whether this “fairly slow” </p>
<p>increase could be accelerated. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>392</p>
<p><b>116. </b> On 31 January, in advance of the first meeting of the US/UK/Australia Working </p>
<p>Group on Day After Economic on 5 February, a junior official in the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington advised the FCO that, on oil, “at present, the [US] Administration are </p>
<p>sharing little with us”.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> Much of the post-conflict planning relating to oil was being done </p>
<p>within the DoD. The official US line was that UK concerns about transparency and the </p>
<p>need for a level commercial playing field had been taken on board. </p>
<p><b>117. </b> The official reported that Mr Colin Powell, the US Secretary of State, had said </p>
<p>publicly that oil would be held “in trust” for the Iraqi people and that the underlying </p>
<p>US objective was to get operations back into the hands of the “local workforce”, but that </p>
<p>view might not be held in other (unspecified) parts of the US Administration. </p>
<p><b>118. </b> The official also reported that rumours persisted that contracts had already been </p>
<p>let for the initial clean-up phase (which could last anything from two to 18 months).</p>
<p><b>119. </b> The official concluded that key questions remained, including who would be in </p>
<p>overall charge of the oil sector after the initial clean-up. </p>
<p><b>120. </b> Mr Blair met President Bush and Dr Condoleezza Rice, President Bush’s National </p>
<p>Security Advisor, in Washington on 31 January to discuss post-conflict planning. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> A FCO briefing for Mr Blair included in its list of objectives for the meeting:  </p>
<p>“To convince President Bush … the US needs to pay much more attention, quickly, </p>
<p>to planning on ‘day after’ issues; and that the UN needs to be central to it.”</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Key messages included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UN could bring “significant advantages” after the conflict, including taking </p>
<p>on responsibility for oil revenues “to avoid accusations that aim of military action </p>
<p>was to get control of oil”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Restoring oil production would be “an immediate challenge”. The oil sector </p>
<p>would need “some technology and a lot of capital”. The US and UK should </p>
<p>“encourage an open investment regime and a level playing field for foreign </p>
<p>companies”.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> A short Cabinet Office paper offered Mr Blair a “few OD Sec points, just in case </p>
<p>they slip through the briefing”.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of the transparent use of oil revenues; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to argue for a level playing field for UK companies on new oil </p>
<p>exploration contracts. </p>

<p><b>123. </b> At the meeting with President Bush, Mr Blair suggested that a UN badge was </p>
<p>needed for what the US and UK wanted to do, and would help with the humanitarian </p>
<p>problems.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>124. </b> The record of the meeting between President Bush and Mr Blair does not show </p>
<p>any discussion of oil issues. </p>
<p><b>125. </b> The first meeting of the US/UK/Australia Working Group on Day After Economic </p>
<p>Issues took place in Washington on 5 February.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that the DoD had detailed contingency </p>
<p>plans to protect and restore the oil sector. The DoD was well aware of the importance </p>
<p>of the oil sector for reconstruction. In the best case (minimal damage, current levels of </p>
<p>outputs restored after two to three months), the DoD estimated that the sector could </p>
<p>make a net contribution of US$12bn in the first year after any conflict; in the worst case </p>
<p>it could impose a net cost of US$8bn.</p>
<p><b>127. </b> The Working Group agreed to co-operate on defining practical economic steps to </p>
<p>be taken in the first three to six months of military occupation. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> The FCO member of the UK delegation, the Economic Adviser for the Middle East </p>
<p>and North Africa, reported separately to Mr Drummond that:</p>
<p>“DoD are ploughing ahead with detailed contingency planning for the oil sector </p>
<p>in the initial military administration phase. But … there was a conspicuous </p>
<p>disconnect between this and civilian planning for economic management and policy </p>
<p>development within Iraq …”</p>
<p>67</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Mr Marc Grossman, US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, and </p>
<p>Mr Douglas Feith, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, gave evidence on US </p>
<p>post-conflict plans to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on 11 February.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>130. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that Mr Grossman’s and Mr Feith’s </p>
<p>message to the Foreign Relations Committee was “liberation not occupation”, with </p>
<p>an assurance that the US did not want to control Iraq’s economic resources. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>394</p>
<p><b>131. </b> The final paragraph of the Embassy’s report highlighted the degree of uncertainty </p>
<p>surrounding US plans:</p>
<p>“In the ensuing discussion, Feith said that military occupation could last two years. </p>
<p>Both admitted to ‘enormous uncertainties’. They said that they did not know how the </p>
<p>Iraqi oil industry would be managed, who would cover the costs of oil installation </p>
<p>reconstruction, or how the detailed transition to a democratic Iraq would operate. </p>
<p>The committee’s response was one of incredulity, with encouragement to plan for </p>
<p>the worst, as well as the best, case.”</p>
<p><b>132. </b> Sir David Manning commented to Mr Bowen and No.10 officials:</p>
<p>“Last para[graph] shows scale of problem post-Saddam. We must keep pushing </p>
<p>for this work to be done.”</p>
<p>69</p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Tom Dodd, Cabinet Office OD Sec, reported on 11 February on a US briefing </p>
<p>on the oil sector arranged by the Assessments Staff.</p>
<p>70</p>
<p> The briefing assessed that </p>
<p>Iraq’s oil infrastructure was “generally in terrible condition”. CENTCOM believed that </p>
<p>oil production could be increased to 6m bpd within three years, given massive new </p>
<p>investment. US officials believed that reaching that level of production would take </p>
<p>at least six years, “given benign political and security factors”. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> Mr Hoon discussed post-conflict issues with Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the US </p>
<p>Secretary of Defense, in Washington on 12 February. </p>
<p><b>135. </b> A briefing prepared by the MOD Iraq Secretariat for Mr Hoon listed eight </p>
<p>“Key Gaps/US-UK policy differences”, one of which was oil.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>136. </b> The MOD advised that the US plan for the insertion of a task force of US oil </p>
<p>experts and subsequent management of Iraqi oilfields “had to be handled carefully to </p>
<p>avoid accusations of theft”. The UK would press for transparency of oil management, </p>
<p>for greater UN involvement than was envisaged, and for the early transfer of control </p>
<p>of oilfields back to the Iraqis. </p>
<p><b>137. </b> The “task force” was probably a reference to Task Force Restore Iraq Oil (RIO), </p>
<p>established by the US Army Corps of Engineers.</p>

<p><b>138. </b> Separately, Mr Drummond sent Mr Ian Lee, MOD Director General Operational </p>
<p>Policy, a final version of the UK’s “key messages” on post-conflict Iraq, for Mr Hoon to </p>
<p>draw on in his meeting with Secretary Rumsfeld.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> The final two key messages were:</p>
<p>“Oil. Agree need to resume oil production and export as soon as possible.  </p>
<p>Welcome your plans to deal with any immediate environmental damage, and </p>
<p>commitment to use oil revenues for the benefit of the Iraqi people e.g. … by adapting </p>
<p>[the] Oil-For-Food programme. Essential that oil revenues managed transparently </p>
<p>and accountably. Perception of US/UK oil grab would rapidly increase hostility to </p>
<p>the Coalition. The UN could help us avoid this.</p>
<p>“Level playing field: Big contracts to rebuild Iraq. Putting UK lives on line. Expect </p>
<p>level playing field for UK business in oil and other areas.” </p>
<p><b>139. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on 13 February that Mr Hoon had </p>
<p>raised the issue of financing reconstruction with Secretary Rumsfeld, including using the </p>
<p>proceeds from oil sales.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> Secretary Rumsfeld had agreed that oil revenues were key to </p>
<p>financing reconstruction and should not be misinterpreted as a reason for the conflict. </p>
<p>The DoD would make it clear that Iraqi oil proceeds should go to Iraq’s people. The OFF </p>
<p>programme was a good basis on which to work. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Following the 5 February meeting of the US/UK/Australia Working Group on Day </p>
<p>After Economic Issues, on 14 February an FCO official sent the US State Department a </p>

<p> The official advised that the paper reflected FCO, Treasury and DFID </p>
<p>views, and was:</p>
<p>“… very much work in progress, not completely co-ordinated here [in London], and </p>
<p>at this stage reflects largely the views of economic and relief specialists here: it is </p>

<p><b>141. </b> The paper set out strategic and specific operational objectives for six issues, </p>
<p>including oil. The key strategic objective for oil was: “Maximum continuity in oil </p>
<p>production and exports.” The specific operational objectives for oil in the first 30 days </p>
<p>included:</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>arrange for “urgent work” on oil infrastructure; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>assess recent oil exports outside the OFF programme. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> The same version of the paper was sent to Mr Blair on 7 March.</p>
<p><b>144. </b> A Treasury official invited Mr Brown’s comments on officials’ “first thoughts” </p>
<p>on Treasury policies in a post-Saddam Iraq on 11 February (see Section 13.1).</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The Treasury assessed that the cost of ensuring Iraq’s prosperity and stability was </p>
<p>difficult to predict but “potentially massive”. Iraq was potentially a rich country and the </p>
<p>“obvious answer” was that Iraq should pay “the lion’s share” of its reconstruction from </p>
<p>its oil revenues. However, there were several reasons why that might not cover all – </p>
<p>or even the majority – of the cost of reconstruction:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s oil infrastructure could be damaged in any conflict, or sabotaged.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The price of oil could fall.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There would be pressure for Coalition countries to pay for reconstruction.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The OFF programme provided up to US$10bn a year for Iraq. That was enough </p>
<p>to keep Iraq “ticking over”, but it was not clear whether it was enough to pay for </p>
<p>reconstruction.</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>“… the Occupying Power acquires a temporary right of administration, but not </p>

<p>the reasonable operation of oil wells was likely to be permitted, at least up to </p>
<p>the rate at which they were previously operated, but there would be no right </p>
<p>to develop new wells; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the current OFF programme regime assumed a degree of Iraqi Government </p>

<p>“preliminary, official-level thinking”. It had been circulated “fairly widely” across </p>

<p><b>153. </b> The paper stated that the UK’s economic objectives should be the rapid relief of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>398</p>
<p><b>154. </b> In the immediate aftermath of any conflict, the military administration’s priorities </p>
<p>should be to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cap any oil well fires and prevent damage to oil infrastructure; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>restore production by repairing existing oil production facilities.</p>
<p><b>155. </b> The “interim administration” that followed would lead on the rehabilitation and </p>
<p>longer-term development of Iraq’s oilfields, including tendering contracts for the </p>
<p>exploration and exploitation of new areas. Deferring such work until a new Iraqi </p>
<p>Government was in place would “seriously delay the maximisation of Iraq’s oil revenue </p>
<p>and increase the cost to the international community of its reconstruction”. It would be </p>
<p>important to ensure that: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>any such moves were clearly in the interests of the Iraqi economy and people;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the interim administration had an appropriate UN mandate;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>everything was done in as transparent a manner as possible; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>production was not pushed beyond OPEC-type depletion rates, even though </p>
<p>that could be in the interests of the Iraqi people.” </p>
<p><b>156. </b> The paper stated that the OFF programme would need to be adjusted so that it </p>
<p>could operate effectively after any conflict. That could only be done through the Security </p>
<p>Council. The paper cautioned against seeking to use OFF programme funds to cover the </p>
<p>cost of military occupation, as some in the US were suggesting, as this would “inevitably </p>
<p>raise accusations that the military action was motivated by oil”. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> The paper concluded that in the aftermath of any conflict, the “international </p>
<p>administration” should seek to ensure that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi oil revenues were available to be used for the benefit of Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>all Iraqi oil industry business was handled in as transparent a manner as </p>
<p>possible, “to rebut allegations about oil motivations”.</p>
<p><b>158. </b> The paper identified a number of next steps for the UK, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to convene a meeting with UK oil companies to explore the UK’s ideas and tap </p>
<p>into their expertise;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to start preliminary work to ensure that UK firms were well placed to pick up </p>
<p>contracts. That work was already in hand;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to factor rapid assistance for oilfield installations into UK military planning; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to start thinking about appropriate wording for UN resolutions. That was also </p>
<p>already in hand. </p>

<p>(FCO Permanent Under Secretary) and other officials.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> The meeting is described in </p>
<p>detail in Section 6.5. </p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Brown received a number of papers from Treasury officials before the meeting, </p>
<p>including a draft “DFID paper rewritten by the Treasury” on humanitarian relief and </p>
<p>reconstruction costs.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> The draft paper stated that it was a “first attempt at charting the </p>
<p>likely costs of the first three years of the Iraqi reconstruction”. </p>
<p><b>164. </b> The draft paper stated that, while cost estimates would remain “very rough” until </p>
<p>the International Financial Institutions (IFIs) had completed a full needs assessment:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In year 1, humanitarian costs could be between US$2bn and US$12bn, </p>
<p>depending on the scale of the humanitarian crisis and the extent to which oil </p>
<p>exports and the OFF programme were disrupted.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In years 2 and 3, total reconstruction costs (before Iraq’s oil revenues were </p>
<p>taken into account) would be between US$2bn and US$15bn per year. </p>
<p>Oil revenues might allow Iraq to pay for most of this – if production levels and </p>
<p>prices were favourable, Iraq did not have to repay its debts, and rehabilitation </p>
<p>of Iraq’s oil infrastructure was cheap.</p>
<p><b>165. </b> The draft paper stated that sources of financing for relief and reconstruction </p>
<p>remained uncertain. The current US/UK approach was to maintain and expand the OFF </p>
<p>programme as the central source of financing. </p>
<p><b>166. </b> At the meeting, Mr Brown said that the burden of reconstruction should not </p>
<p>be borne by the US and UK alone; other countries and Iraqi oil revenues should be </p>
<p>tapped.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> In the longer term, Iraqi oil should fund the country’s reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Blair concluded that Mr Brown should draw up “a funding plan, including </p>
<p>securing funding from wider international sources, in particular the IFIs”. The Treasury </p>
<p>sent that plan to No.10 on 14 March.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>400</p>
<p><b>168. </b> On 8 March, the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) awarded a contract for the </p>
<p>repair of Iraq’s oil infrastructure, worth up to US$7bn, to the US engineering company </p>
<p>Kellogg, Brown and Root (KBR).</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> <i>Hard Lessons</i> reported that the contract was the </p>
<p>single largest reconstruction contract in Iraq and the largest known sole-source contract </p>
<p>in US history. </p>
<p><b>169. </b> Mr Mike O’Brien, FCO Minister of State, visited Washington on 13 March to </p>
<p>discuss post-conflict issues with US interlocutors.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>170. </b> A senior official from the NSC briefed Mr O’Brien on US plans for the oil sector.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The British Embassy Washington reported that the NSC was expecting Saddam Hussein </p>
<p>to inflict “massive damage” on Iraq’s oil infrastructure; contracts had been let to US </p>
<p>companies to control the damage. </p>
<p><b>171. </b> The NSC official advised that a small, US, senior management team for the </p>
<p>oil sector had been assembled. Its first task would be to assess reconstruction and </p>
<p>investment needs. The team would need to be headed by an Iraqi. </p>
<p><b>172. </b> The official said that the NSC agreed on the need for a UN role in ensuring </p>
<p>transparency, but thought that the UN was not able to run the oil sector. That would be </p>
<p>a job for the oil sector management team, “reporting first and foremost to the Coalition”. </p>
<p><b>173. </b> The official also advised that the NSC agreed with much of the UK’s oil policy </p>
<p>paper, but identified three points of disagreement:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US did not think it was sensible to commit to restoring pre-invasion levels of </p>
<p>production, when the Coalition could not know what damage would be inflicted </p>
<p>on the oil infrastructure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US foresaw legal problems in either the Coalition or the interim Iraqi </p>
<p>administration letting new oil development contracts (which would be long-term </p>
<p>commitments) during the “transitional phase”. Depending on the situation on </p>
<p>the ground, it might make more sense to suspend the existing six or seven oil </p>
<p>development contracts, with a view to them being renegotiated in due course by </p>
<p>a sovereign Iraqi Government. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The US thought it was unrealistic to envisage private finance emerging early on.</p>
<p><b>174. </b> The Inquiry has not seen the version of the oil policy paper passed to the US. </p>
<p><b>175. </b> Dr Rice gave Sir David Manning an account of White House thinking on the </p>
<p>handling of Iraqi oil on 13 March.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> The OFF programme should be left in place, </p>
<p>and phased out when there was an Iraqi entity ready to take control of oil revenues. </p>

<p>The US also wanted to make clear that military operations would not be paid for out of </p>
<p>Iraqi oil money. </p>
<p><b>176. </b> Ms Patricia Hewitt, the Trade and Industry Secretary, wrote to Mr Blair on </p>
<p>13 March seeking confirmation that she could, if necessary, signal the UK’s agreement </p>
<p>to the release of a modest amount of the IEA’s oil stocks, to reassure oil markets.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She described the oil markets as “extremely nervous”. </p>
<p><b>177. </b> No.10 replied the following day, confirming that while Mr Blair agreed the broad </p>
<p>approach proposed, he would like to be consulted before any final decision was taken.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>178. </b> On 14 March, the FCO instructed the UK Permanent Mission to the UN in New </p>
<p>York to start discussions with the US delegation on a possible resolution to modify the </p>
<p>OFF programme and sanctions regime in the event of military action and the absence of </p>
<p>an “effective Iraqi Government”.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> The FCO believed that that resolution might best be </p>
<p>tabled immediately after the start of military operations.</p>
<p><b>179. </b> The UK wanted the OFF programme to continue “for some time”, to enable Iraq to </p>
<p>export oil and import and distribute humanitarian goods until new government structures </p>
<p>existed that could take on those functions. </p>
<p><b>180. </b> The FCO proposed that to enable the OFF programme to continue, the UN </p>
<p>Secretary-General should fulfil a number of functions that were currently reserved for the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government, including the authority to spend OFF programme funds.</p>
<p><b>181. </b> The UK position was summarised in the FCO background papers for the Azores </p>
<p>Summit, sent to No.10 on 15 March:</p>
<p>“If the Iraqi regime falls, new arrangements will need to be put in place to enable </p>
<p>the OFF to keep functioning. Our current plan is to table a resolution soon after </p>
<p>conflict starts, transferring authority for ordering and distributing goods to the </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General … [W]e would hope that the Secretary-General would be </p>
<p>able to transfer full control over oil revenues to a properly representative Iraqi </p>
<p>Government as soon as possible (not as the US have suggested, an Iraqi ‘entity’, </p>
<p>which could, particularly if US appointed, fuel suggestions that the Coalition was </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>402</p>
<p><b>182. </b> On 14 March, in response to Mr Blair’s 6 March request, Mr Mark Bowman, </p>
<p>Mr Brown’s Principal Private Secretary, sent No.10 a Treasury paper on financing Iraq’s </p>
<p>reconstruction.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>183. </b> The Treasury estimated that the total cost of Iraq’s reconstruction could be up </p>
<p>to US$45bn for the first three years (US$15bn a year) and warned that, without UN </p>
<p>authorisation of arrangements for a transitional administration, Iraqi oil might pay for </p>
<p>only a fraction of that. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> The Treasury advised that the best way to pay for reconstruction would be to </p>
<p>spread the burden as widely as possible, drawing in contributions from non-combatants, </p>
<p>IFIs and Iraq itself, and ensuring Iraqi revenues were not diverted into debt or </p>
<p>compensation payments. By far the most significant factor in making that happen would </p>
<p>be political legitimacy conferred by the UN. </p>
<p><b>185. </b> The Treasury stated that the OFF programme provided “an obvious way to pay for </p>
<p>immediate humanitarian needs”, using the approximately US$4bn unspent in the OFF </p>
<p>account and by restarting oil exports. That depended on oil production facilities surviving </p>
<p>the conflict relatively intact. In the most benign circumstances, with rapidly increasing </p>
<p>production and high oil prices, oil revenues “could make a very significant contribution” </p>
<p>to ongoing relief and reconstruction. The securitisation of future oil revenues was </p>
<p>another possible source of funds, but Iraq had already accumulated “massive and </p>
<p>probably unsustainable debts” that way.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> President Bush, Mr José María Aznar, the Prime Minister of Spain, and Mr Blair </p>
<p>discussed Iraq at the Azores Summit on 16 March.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>187. </b> The FCO background papers sent to No.10 in advance of the Summit included a </p>
<p>revised version of the UK’s ‘A Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People’ (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The UK intended that the document, which would be launched at the Summit, would </p>
<p>reassure Iraqis and wider audiences of the Coalition’s intentions for Iraq after Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s departure. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> The revised version included a number of changes from the version produced </p>
<p>the previous month, including the addition of a reference to Iraq’s oil industry being </p>
<p>managed “fairly and transparently”.</p>
<p><b>189. </b> The statement issued by President Bush, Prime Minister Aznar and Mr Blair at the </p>
<p>Summit on 16 March shared much of the substance of the revised version of the UK’s </p>

<p> Key differences included the omission of any </p>
<p>explicit reference to oil. On post-conflict reconstruction, the three leaders declared:</p>
<p>“We will work to prevent and repair damage by Saddam Hussein’s regime to the </p>
<p>natural resources of Iraq and pledge to protect them as a national asset of and </p>

<p>be met through the Oil-for-Food program.”</p>
<p><b>190. </b> A specially convened Cabinet, the last before the invasion, was held at 1600 on </p>
<p>17 March.</p>
<p>99</p>
<p> Mr Blair told Cabinet that the US had confirmed that it “would seek a UN </p>

<p>under the UN’s authority. </p>

<p>had advised that, while the NSC fully understood the UK’s “desire for maximum UN </p>
<p>legitimacy and transparency in running the oil sector … other equities in the [US] </p>
<p>Administration continued to see no need for this”. </p>
<p><b>192. </b> In his speech in the House of Commons on 18 March, Mr Blair stated that: </p>
<p>“There should be a new United Nations resolution following any conflict providing not </p>

<p>“And this point is also important: that the oil revenues, which people falsely claim </p>

<p>406</p>
<p><b>213. </b> Ms Kara Owen, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary, wrote to Sir David Manning on </p>
<p>20 March, advising that the US envisaged that control of the OFF programme would </p>
<p>pass from the UN Secretary-General to “authorities in Iraq” within 90 days.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> Ms Owen </p>
<p>advised that that short time-scale suggested that the US was thinking that control </p>
<p>over the OFF programme should be handed over to either Coalition Forces or a </p>
<p>non-representative interim administration established by the US rather than, as the UK </p>
<p>wanted, a credible representative Iraqi Government. The US proposal was likely to run </p>
<p>into major objections in the Security Council, and would be likely to be perceived as an </p>
<p>attempt to “grab Iraqi oil”. </p>
<p><b>214. </b> Ms Owen suggested that Sir David might need to discuss the issue soon with </p>
<p>Dr Rice. </p>
<p><b>215. </b> Mr Bowen circulated draft ‘British Post-Conflict Objectives’ to senior officials in the </p>
<p>FCO, the MOD and DFID on 25 March.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p> The text incorporated earlier comments from </p>
<p>some departments.</p>
<p><b>216. </b> The draft stated:</p>
<p>“With others, we will help revive the Iraqi economy and assist reform by: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>working with the UN to manage Iraq’s oil revenues in order to achieve the </p>
<p>maximum benefit for the Iraqi people in an accountable and transparent </p>
<p>manner …”</p>
<p><b>217. </b> There is no indication whether the objectives were ever adopted formally. </p>
<p><b>218. </b> Resolution 1472 (2003) was adopted unanimously by the UN Security Council </p>
<p>on 28 March.</p>
<p>116</p>
<p> The resolution gave the UN Secretary-General authority to purchase </p>
<p>medical supplies and Iraqi goods and services under the OFF programme, for a period </p>
<p>of 45 days (until 10 May). The resolution did not give the UN Secretary-General authority </p>
<p>to sell Iraqi oil. </p>
<p><b>219. </b> The UK Government’s view was that until sanctions on Iraq were lifted or the </p>
<p>Security Council agreed a further resolution amending the OFF programme, the </p>
<p>Coalition did not have the power to export Iraqi oil.</p>

<p>407</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush discussed post-conflict issues at Camp David on </p>
<p>26 and 27 March.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p><b>222. </b> In advance of the meeting, Mr Straw’s Private Office sent Mr Rycroft a negotiating </p>
<p>brief for what was to become resolution 1483, the resolution defining the roles of the UN </p>
<p>and the Coalition in post-conflict Iraq.</p>
<p>119</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>223. </b> The negotiating brief, prepared by the IPU, identified five “key issues” on which US </p>
<p>and UK positions differed, including the arrangements for dealing with Iraqi oil revenues:</p>
<p>“Some in the US are … tempted to arrogate to themselves charge of the direction </p>
<p>of a Trust Fund for Iraqi oil and other revenues, which will be used for meeting the </p>
<p>costs of their administration of Iraq as well as for reconstruction … this will open </p>
<p>them (and by association us) to criticism that they are reneging on their promise </p>
<p>to devote the oil revenues exclusively to the Iraqis.”</p>
<p><b>224. </b> Such a proposition had “nil chance” of approval by the Security Council:</p>
<p>“Either the UN or the Iraqis themselves (perhaps with World Bank/IMF help) must  </p>
<p>be seen to be in control of Iraqi revenues – certainly not the Coalition.” </p>
<p><b>225. </b> The brief concluded that, overall, the US approach amounted to:</p>
<p>“… asking the UNSC [Security Council] to endorse Coalition military control over </p>
<p>Iraq’s transitional administration, its representative institutions and its revenues until </p>
<p>such time as a fully-fledged Iraqi government is ready to take over.”</p>
<p><b>226. </b> The brief set out a number of “propositions” which the IPU hoped Mr Blair and </p>
<p>President Bush would agree, including: </p>
<p>“The UN or the Iraqis, not the Coalition, should manage oil revenues.”</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Also as briefing for the meeting, Mr Straw sent Mr Blair an FCO paper on Phase IV </p>
<p>issues.</p>
<p>120</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> The FCO advised that, on oil sector management, the US and UK agreed that the </p>
<p>“overarching principles” were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disruption to the flow of Iraqi oil should be minimised;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s oil wealth should be used for the benefit of the Iraqi people; and</p>

<p>408</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraqi oil business should be handled in as transparent and even-handed a </p>
<p>manner as possible.</p>
<p><b>229. </b> The US and UK also agreed that all decisions on the development of the Iraqi oil </p>
<p>industry (such as privatisation and the exploration of new fields) should be deferred until </p>
<p>a new Iraqi Government was in place.</p>
<p><b>230. </b> The FCO advised that the US was considering setting up a trust fund for oil and </p>
<p>other revenues. Whatever the arrangement:</p>
<p>“… the key point is that <b>decisions on using the funds should not be taken by the </b></p>
<p><b>Coalition</b>. Until the Iraqi interim authority has the capacity to operate a budget, the </p>
<p>UN Secretary-General (or the UN Special Co-ordinator) should continue to decide </p>
<p>on spending priorities, as he will do under the amended OFF arrangements.”</p>
<p><b>231. </b> The FCO also advised that Iraq’s oil revenues would not cover the cost of </p>
<p>reconstruction, particularly in the short term. The cost of reconstruction needed to be </p>
<p>shared with other countries. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> The UK Treasury received a paper from the US Treasury on 26 March, proposing </p>
<p>the creation of two Trust Funds:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one to hold donor funds, to be administered by the World Bank; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>one – the Iraqi Economic Recovery Fund (IERF) – to hold oil revenues and </p>
<p>unfrozen Iraqi assets. The IMF would manage and invest the IERF’s assets, but </p>
<p>the “CPA/IIA” [Coalition Provisional Authority/Iraq Interim Authority] would have </p>
<p>sole authority over how IERF funds were spent.</p>

<p><b>233. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush met at Camp David on 26 and 27 March.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> At dinner </p>
<p>on the first evening, Mr Blair told President Bush that he did not want his visit to Camp </p>
<p>David to focus primarily on a resolution to deal with post-conflict Iraq. The question </p>
<p>about what sort of resolution was needed for the administration and reconstruction of </p>
<p>Iraq should be parked. </p>

<p>409</p>
<p><b>235. </b> The UK Treasury advised that the main problem with the US proposal was that it </p>
<p>assumed a certain interim governance arrangement for post-conflict Iraq which had not </p>
<p>yet been endorsed internationally. The “best outcome” for the UK would be:</p>
<p>“… a UN-authorised Transitional Administration or Iraqi Government, accompanied </p>
<p>by a ‘Consultative Group’ of donors … chaired by the World Bank.</p>
<p>“Initially oil funds might continue to be managed under the Oil-for-Food programme. </p>
<p>Gradually, and as sanctions are lifted, the UN-backed Iraqi authority would take </p>
<p>control of domestic resources under suitable safeguards, e.g. over transparency </p>
<p>of fiscal actions, contracts etc.”</p>
<p><b>236. </b> Mr Rycroft commented:</p>
<p>“We need to get the US back to what they said at Camp David was their policy: </p>
<p>returning Iraqi sovereignty to Iraqi people.”</p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush later that day.</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> Mr Blair stated that a clearer </p>
<p>picture was needed of the shape of a post-Saddam Iraq to “sketch out a political and </p>
<p>economic future and dispel the myth that we were out to grab Iraq’s oil”. </p>
<p><b>238. </b> After the discussion, Mr Blair sent President Bush two Notes, one on </p>
<p>communications and one entitled ‘Reconstruction’.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>239. </b> The Note on reconstruction set out the UK’s response to the two funds proposed </p>
<p>by the US. It stated that using the World Bank and the IMF to administer the funds was </p>
<p>sensible but would run into problems:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Channelling oil revenues through IFIs rather than straight to the IIA could “easily </p>
<p>be misrepresented”, and the proposal would need to be included in the next </p>
<p>resolution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Without UN agreement, the IFIs were unlikely to agree to administer the funds. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK, Japan and others could only unblock assets with UN authority. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Our posture should be for the IIA to take on responsibility as soon as possible, </p>
<p>i.e. Iraq for the Iraqis, not us or the UN.”</p>
<p><b>240. </b> The Note stated that an amended proposal had been submitted by the UK </p>
<p>Treasury, which envisaged some oil revenues going into a gradually declining OFF </p>
<p>programme and the remainder (plus unfrozen assets) going into “the reconstruction </p>
<p>account”, which would be administered jointly by the IMF and World Bank. Funds from </p>
<p>the account would be “directed to the IIA”. </p>

<p><b>242. </b> In preparation for the 8 April meeting between President Bush and Mr Blair at </p>
<p>Hillsborough, Mr Rycroft chaired talks between US and UK officials on 4 April.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>243. </b> The IPU provided Mr Rycroft with an annotated version of the agenda for the talks </p>
<p>and a commentary on the latest US draft resolution on 3 April.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>244. </b> The commentary described the UK’s problems with the US draft, including that </p>
<p>it specified that Iraqi oil revenues would be spent at the direction of the Coalition. </p>
<p>That would be unacceptable to the Security Council. </p>
<p><b>245. </b> The annotated agenda set out the UK position on that issue:</p>
<p>“We believe that, like the wider political process, this management [of oil revenues] </p>
<p>has to be legitimised by the UN; and that it will only be acceptable to the UNSC </p>
<p>[Security Council] if it involves some form of effective international oversight – </p>
<p>about whose details we do not as yet have a firm view – until a representative Iraqi </p>
<p>Government is ready to take over.”</p>
<p><b>246. </b> The annotated agenda also stated that: </p>
<p>“Any decisions concerning the management of Iraq’s oil reserves should be taken </p>
<p>either by the UN or by the new Iraqi institutions. The Coalition’s effort should focus </p>
<p>on rehabilitating Iraq’s existing infrastructure …”</p>
<p><b>247. </b> Mr Brenton reported by telegram on 4 April, to clarify US views on post-conflict </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> While discussions had been “disproportionately dominated by hard-line DoD </p>
<p>positions”, the reality was that “NSC rule” and it was close to the UK position on most </p>
<p>of the post-conflict agenda. There was considerable common ground between the US </p>
<p>(including DoD) and the UK, including on the need for oil revenues to be “in the hands of </p>

<p>130</p>
<p> The IPU advised:</p>
<p>“We agree that, as Condi [Dr Rice] said at Camp David, future oil arrangements </p>
<p>should be put into the hands of Iraqis, with international oversight, as soon as </p>
<p>possible. But<b> it is unrealistic to think that the UN Security Council, which </b></p>
<p><b>controls Iraq’s oil revenues, will agree to give directional power over them </b></p>
<p><b>to the Coalition</b>. It will need a new UNSCR to take control over the revenues from </p>
<p>the UN and give it to someone else. We don’t think that IIA should have unfettered </p>
<p>power over spending. We need to design a system where the IFIs have sufficient </p>

<p>131</p>
<p> On oil, short-term tasks for the Coalition should include: repairing the </p>
<p>oilfields; getting Iraqis back to work; and starting to pump oil. The long-term issues </p>
<p>would include future contracts. </p>
<p><b>254. </b> Mr Straw said that a UN role would be needed to regularise the sale of Iraqi oil.</p>

<p>The message referred to the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>412</p>
<p><b>258. </b> The IPU/FCO paper reported that the oil price had fallen by US$8 a barrel </p>
<p>since early March, and had stabilised in the “mid-twenties”. Iraq’s oilfields had been </p>
<p>undamaged by the fighting, although a few wells had been sabotaged. Those fires were </p>
<p>now all extinguished. There had been some looting and damage to pipelines and oil </p>
<p>refineries. There was a growing shortage of gas (for power stations), fuel and cooking </p>
<p>gas, particularly in the South. </p>
<p><b>259. </b> The IPU/FCO also reported that within the Security Council, oil remained a </p>
<p>contentious issue; Council members had different motivations. The UK and US </p>
<p>were keen to get Iraqi oil flowing again as soon as possible “to meet humanitarian/</p>
<p>reconstruction needs”. France and Russia wanted to protect the interests of their </p>
<p>companies that had existing contracts under the OFF programme. </p>
<p><b>260. </b> The UK was proposing a three-phase approach to dealing with Iraqi oil and the </p>
<p>OFF programme:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To extend resolution 1472 to 3 June (the end of the current OFF programme </p>
<p>phase), and possibly extend the OFF programme itself beyond 3 June.  </p>
<p>If the OFF programme continued “for any length of time”, the UN Secretary-</p>
<p>General would need enhanced powers to sell Iraqi oil and buy the full range of </p>
<p>humanitarian supplies. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To pass control of Iraqi oil and gas revenues to a “credible interim </p>
<p>administration” once one had been established, subject to certain checks: </p>
<p>“The checks would be those necessary to assure us (the UK) that oil and oil </p>
<p>revenues were protected against major mismanagement, corruption and national </p>
<p>bias, lack of transparency or other unfairness in the awarding of contracts.” </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those checks would have to be acceptable to the Security Council. They might </p>
<p>comprise oversight of contracts by a representative of the UN Secretary-General </p>
<p>or a committee of IFI representatives. Oversight by the Coalition would not be </p>
<p>politically acceptable or achievable in the Security Council. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To hand over full control over oil and oil revenues to a democratically elected </p>
<p>Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> The IPU/FCO advised that the UK had stressed to the US its legal concerns on </p>
<p>the limits to the authority of Occupying Powers to export oil outside the OFF programme </p>
<p>while sanctions were in place, and to alter Iraqi oil policy or to carry out any structural </p>
<p>reorganisation of the Iraqi oil industry. The US was “well aware” of the UK’s concerns. </p>
<p><b>262. </b> The UK and the US agreed that all strategic decisions on the development of </p>
<p>the oil industry should be left to a “representative Iraqi government” and that, in the </p>
<p>meantime, all oil business should be handled in as transparent a manner as possible. </p>
<p>The UK and the US also shared “a general concern” to avoid the centralisation of oil </p>
<p>revenues in the hands of a minority, and to help limit their corrosive effect on political life. </p>

<p><b>263. </b> Introducing the paper at the AHMGIR, an FCO official said that Iraq’s oil </p>
<p>infrastructure was in a better state than had been feared when the conflict began.</p>
<p>135</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The UK was clear that the OFF programme was the only legal means for exporting Iraqi </p>
<p>oil, “though some in the US wanted to find ways around this”. The UK’s strategy was to </p>
<p>extend the OFF programme, then transfer control of oil revenues to the IIA “with some </p>
<p>international oversight”, and then transfer full control to a democratically elected Iraqi </p>
<p>Government.</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Ms Hewitt said that UK companies wanted a future Iraqi Government to establish </p>
<p>a “level playing field” for oil industry contracts. </p>
<p><b>265. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the UK should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage Iraqi oil exports to recommence as soon as possible, but only after </p>
<p>an appropriate resolution had been adopted;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>offer UK oil expertise to ORHA and in the medium term to the IIA; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>leave future decisions on the shape of the Iraqi oil industry and the management </p>
<p>of oil revenues to the new Iraqi Government, while advising on international best </p>
<p>practice.</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr John Bellinger, NSC, sent a US draft of a post-conflict resolution to Sir David </p>
<p>Manning on 28 April.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> It provided for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the creation of an Iraqi Development Fund, which would be audited by </p>
<p>independent accountants and whose operations would be “monitored” by the  </p>
<p>UN Special Co-ordinator; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>funds in the Iraqi Development Fund to be disbursed “at the direction of the </p>
<p>Coalition Provisional Authority”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the resumption of oil sales at the market price; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the transfer of unspent OFF programme funds and oil revenues into the Iraqi </p>
<p>Development Fund. </p>
<p><b>267. </b> Section 9.1 describes negotiations between the UK and US on the draft resolution, </p>
<p>which increasingly focused on the mandate of the UN Special Co-ordinator and the </p>
<p>extension of the OFF programme. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>414</p>
<p><b>269. </b> Sir Jeremy Greenstock said that the US and UK needed to establish who would </p>
<p>have title to Iraqi oil, and who would control expenditure of oil revenues. Dr Rice </p>
<p>responded that the Coalition, as the Occupying Power, was responsible for administering </p>
<p>Iraq. It followed that control over Iraqi finances could not be transferred elsewhere.  </p>
<p>US legal advice was that the Coalition could sell Iraqi oil without UN cover if necessary. </p>
<p>She concluded:</p>
<p>“The CPA would be the Government until the IIA took over, and so would write </p>
<p>the cheques, even if this was dressed up with UN cover, or monitoring, or an </p>
<p>international board.”</p>
<p><b>270. </b> Mr Straw noted the presentational sensitivities of the Coalition using Iraq’s money. </p>
<p><b>271. </b> During the meeting, Mr Rycroft and Mr Bellinger were tasked to go through the </p>
<p>US draft in detail and produce a further version for discussion.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>272. </b> Mr Bellinger sent a revised draft to Mr Rycroft later that day. The revised draft </p>
<p>recorded separate UK and US language on who would control disbursement from </p>
<p>the Iraqi Development Fund, and how it would be administered. The UK language </p>
<p>gave control to “the authorities in Iraq, including the Interim Iraqi Administration when </p>
<p>established”, the US language to the “Occupying Powers/CPA”. </p>
<p><b>273. </b> Mr Straw, Sir David Manning, Sir Jeremy Greenstock and officials discussed the </p>
<p>latest draft resolution by video link with Dr Rice and US officials on 1 May.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>274. </b> On the Iraqi Development Fund, Sir Jeremy said that the lack of some provision for </p>
<p>oversight or disbursement by the IIA would be a major problem for the Security Council. </p>
<p>Dr Rice responded that the Security Council needed to recognise the facts on the </p>
<p>ground; the Coalition was the Occupying Power and would need to be able to manage </p>
<p>disbursement. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> The record of the video conference did not indicate that any resolution was </p>
<p>reached on the issue.</p>
<p><b>276. </b> Mr Bellinger sent through a further US draft of a post-conflict resolution on </p>
<p>4 May.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>277. </b> The draft stated that the Iraqi Assistance Fund should be disbursed “at the </p>
<p>direction of the Authority, in consultation with the Iraqi Interim Authority”.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> The Fund </p>
<p>would be audited by independent accountants, and established “with an international </p>

<p><b>280. </b> Later that day, Mr Straw chaired a video conference with Dr Rice, Secretary </p>

<p>144</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>281. </b> During the video conference, it was agreed that the draft should include reference </p>
<p>to monitoring, as well as auditing, oil sales. </p>
<p><b>282. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 15 May meeting of the AHMGIR stated that initial </p>
<p>discussions on a draft resolution in the Security Council had been as positive as could </p>
<p>be expected.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> Concerns had focused on a need for clarity in three areas:</p>

<p>the extent of the UN role; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the political process, in particular the exact nature of the IIA; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>arrangements for oversight of oil sales and disbursement of oil revenue, as well </p>
<p>as the fate of existing contracts under the OFF programme.</p>
<p><b>283. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that the US wanted the resolution adopted by </p>
<p>22 May, as this was the date by which they wished to start exporting oil to avoid a lack </p>
<p>of storage capacity affecting production and the local supply of gas and petrol. </p>
<p><b>284. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke on 16 May.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> Action in the UN seemed to be </p>
<p>going well and Mr Blair proposed two areas (a UN “Special Representative” rather than </p>
<p>“Special Co-ordinator” and greater transparency of oil sales) in which the resolution </p>
<p>might be amended if tactically necessary. </p>

<p>noted that disbursements from the DFI would be “at the direction of the Authority, </p>

<p>underlined that the DFI would be used “in a transparent manner to meet the </p>

<p>repair of Iraq’s infrastructure, for the continued disarmament of Iraq, and for the </p>
<p>costs of Iraqi civilian administration, and for other purposes benefiting the people </p>
<p>of Iraq”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>decided that all export sales of Iraqi petroleum, petroleum products and natural </p>
<p>gas should made “consistent with prevailing international market best practices”, </p>
<p>and that 95 percent of the revenue should be deposited into the DFI (with five </p>
<p>percent deposited into the UN Compensation Fund for victims of Saddam </p>

<p> The first sale was made on 22 June. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> Sir Jon Cunliffe told the Inquiry that the UK’s position in the negotiations </p>
<p>over resolution 1483 had been informed by its concern to maintain legitimacy and </p>
<p>accountability as an Occupying Power: </p>
<p>“… there was great suspicion that … the war was designed to get hold of Iraqi </p>
<p>oil revenues and was being inspired by the US oil industry … we thought it was </p>
<p>very important for the perception in the international community that these [oil] </p>
<p>resources were controlled transparently and at arm’s length and in a proper way </p>
<p>we could account for them. We thought it would make a huge difference as to </p>
<p>whether we could get other countries to join us in the reconstruction effort … and </p>
<p>we also thought that it was important for the UK generally to ensure they were used </p>
<p>efficiently on the ground in Iraq.</p>

<p>“So our view of how this should be managed, accounted for, was different to the US </p>

<p><b>289. </b> Ambassador Paul Bremer III arrived in Baghdad on 12 May, to lead the CPA. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> The names ORHA and CPA continued to be used interchangeably in documents </p>
<p>seen by the Inquiry for some time after the creation of the CPA. </p>
<p><b>291. </b> From late May, Ministers received reports that the CPA was not consulting the UK </p>
<p>on policy issues in the oil sector. </p>
<p><b>292. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 22 May meeting of the AHMGIR stated that the US </p>
<p>was driving decisions on the management of the oil sector.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> The Iraqi Ministry of Oil </p>
<p>was “run by” a US-appointed Interim Management Team, headed by an Iraqi official. </p>
<p>That official was “effectively steered by” an Oil Advisory Board (OAB) chaired by an </p>
<p>American (though the majority of Board members were Iraqis). The OAB planned a </p>
<p>strategic review of the oil sector; the UK hoped that the recent arrival in the CPA of a </p>
<p>DTI oil expert would increase its knowledge of CPA plans for the sector. </p>
<p><b>293. </b> Ms Hewitt’s briefing for the AHMGIR set out the problem more explicitly.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The UK had had considerable difficulty in getting hold of the OAB’s terms of reference, </p>
<p>and was not therefore able to establish whether it was legally constituted. A UK national </p>
<p>was being sounded out to sit on the OAB. That could bring a different perspective and </p>
<p>help encourage a transparent oil sector policy, but those advantages needed to be </p>
<p>weighed against the legal uncertainties surrounding the OAB and the presentational </p>
<p>issues of a more visible UK role in managing Iraq’s oil. </p>
<p><b>294. </b> The Annotated Agenda also stated that TPUK’s ability to promote Iraq to UK oil </p>
<p>companies was constrained by “political sensitivities and lack of ground knowledge”.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> </p>
<p>UK oil companies would only deal with a “legally acceptable authority” and remained to </p>
<p>be convinced that one was in place: </p>
<p>“But most of this will change if there is a new UN resolution,</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> and we are reaching </p>
<p>the stage where we and UK companies must engage or lose out. We are therefore </p>
<p>beginning to encourage UK companies to become more closely involved in the oil </p>
<p>sector in the same way as they are in other areas of rehabilitation.” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>418</p>
<p><b>295. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the DTI should encourage UK oil companies to “develop </p>
<p>strategies towards the Iraqi oil sector and otherwise help the UK take advantage of oil </p>
<p>opportunities”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>296. </b> A week later, Ministers were informed that the DTI planned a series of meetings </p>
<p>with the major oil companies, “to begin to discuss more general Iraq oil issues </p>
<p>discreetly”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>297. </b> Oil production was estimated at between 400,000 and 500,000 bpd; the target was </p>
<p>to reach between 2.5m and 2.8m bpd (described as the pre-conflict level) by the end </p>
<p>of 2003. </p>
<p><b>298. </b> From early June 2003, and throughout the summer, there were signs that security </p>
<p>in both Baghdad and the South was deteriorating (see Section 9.2).</p>
<p><b>299. </b> A paper on the management of the DFI was submitted to the 5 June meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR (chaired by Mr Straw).</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>300. </b> The paper stated that while resolution 1483 made the UK jointly responsible (with </p>
<p>the US) for disbursements from the DFI, it contained little detail on how the DFI should </p>
<p>be managed. The UK needed to settle that issue quickly with the US; spending decisions </p>
<p>could start being made in the next few weeks. The management arrangements needed </p>
<p>to meet the UK’s objectives in terms of transparency and accountability; in particular, the </p>
<p>arrangements needed to meet the commitments in the resolution to use resources in the </p>
<p>DFI “in a transparent manner” and to ensure that oil sales were “made consistent with </p>
<p>international best practice”. </p>
<p><b>301. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the meeting stated that the CPA had circulated a draft </p>
<p>regulation which gave the US Administration “sole oversight” over DFI spending.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>Such an arrangement would marginalise UK influence and risk presentational problems, </p>
<p>but was not settled US policy. The UK was lobbying in Washington and Baghdad to </p>
<p>amend the draft regulation. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>I couldn’t be put in charge of oil because I really wasn’t American … [and] oil would </p>
<p>remain an American interest. </p>
<p>“So it was a very specific instruction from Bremer that I was not in charge of the Oil </p>
<p>Ministry.”</p>
<p><b>312. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Jeremy Greenstock identified budgeting and oil </p>
<p>as the two clearest examples of issues on which the UK was not consulted by the CPA:</p>
<p>“We did not see anything whatsoever in the oil sector; they [the CPA] kept that very </p>
<p>closely American, because they wanted to run the oil sector.”</p>
<p>167</p>
<p><b>313. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Jeremy why the CPA sought to retain control of the oil sector. </p>
<p>He responded:</p>
<p>“I think they [the CPA] felt that they understood the oil sector. They brought in </p>
<p>American oil executives to advise them on this and to run that part of the CPA. </p>
<p>They knew that management of the oil sector was going to be vital for the supply </p>
<p>of finance into the Iraqi system and they wanted to be responsible for it themselves. </p>
<p>“There might have been a minor angle of thinking that they wanted access to </p>
<p>the contracts that might come out of the oil sector and the Iraqi economy at a </p>
<p>subsequent period, but the Americans were doing 95 percent of the work and putting </p>
<p>in more than 95 percent of the money. I wouldn’t like to say that they were not </p>
<p>justified in taking that approach.”</p>
<p>168</p>
<p><b>314. </b> Sir Jeremy continued: </p>
<p>“… the Americans had no intention to take over and own the oil sector. That was </p>
<p>always a canard in public criticism terms of what the invasion was about. It was not </p>
<p>about oil. I think they just felt it was such an important area that they would run it </p>
<p>themselves.” </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>422</p>
<p><b>326. </b> Ambassador Bremer signed CPA Order No.39 on 19 September.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> The Order </p>
<p>allowed for 100 percent foreign participation in business entities in Iraq:</p>
<p>“… except that foreign direct and indirect ownership of the natural resources sector </p>
<p>involving primary extraction and initial processing remains prohibited.”</p>
<p><b>Study on the Political Economy of Oil </b></p>
<p>In late July 2003, the London Middle East Institute produced a study on the political </p>
<p>economy of oil and democracy-building in Iraq, which had been commissioned by the </p>
<p>Department for International Development (DFID).</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>A junior DFID official circulated the study to DFID and Treasury officials only on 31 July. </p>
<p>He advised that the study evaluated a range of options for the allocation of oil revenues </p>
<p>and the ownership of the oil industry. A central message from the study was that any </p>
<p>arrangement would have long-term political, economic and social implications. There were </p>
<p>no “risk-free” options.</p>
<p>The official highlighted a number of the study’s conclusions, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “cautious, incremental” approach to unbundling upstream production and </p>
<p>downstream distribution systems to create a deconcentrated ownership structure, </p>
<p>which could eventually be incorporated into a graduated privatisation process, </p>
<p>was preferable to “rapid privatisation”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>while production-sharing agreements (PSAs) might be economically attractive in </p>
<p>terms of mobilising capital and technology, they were unlikely to have “positive </p>
<p>distributional benefits” and might constrain future political development. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> By August, the US was focusing its efforts on increasing oil production. The UK </p>
<p>believed there was also a need to develop sector policy and strategy. The US rebuffed </p>
<p>UK attempts to provide an oil policy expert. </p>
<p><b>328. </b> The DTI provided an update on the oil sector to the 7 August meeting of the </p>
<p>AHMGIR.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>329. </b> The DTI reported that oil production, hampered mainly by sabotage and power </p>
<p>shortages, was between 1m and 1.2m bpd – still less than half pre-conflict levels. </p>
<p>Despite significant imports, refined petroleum products, gasoline, petrol and gas for </p>
<p>cooking and heating remained in short supply. </p>

<p>Mr Adams’ appointment, but had been “less than enthusiastic” about Mr Fletcher’s, </p>
<p>possibly because of its view that longer-term issues should be left to the Iraqi authorities.</p>
<p><b>332. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the AHMGIR reported that the current Iraqi Ministry </p>

<p>“We are therefore seeking to engage the US Administration and CPA leadership </p>

<p><b>340. </b> Mr Adams deployed to Iraq in mid-September.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The Iraq Heritage Trust </b></p>
<p>In early September, the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) prepared a draft Order </p>
<p>expressing the intent to establish an “Iraq Heritage Trust” (IHT), to hold Iraq’s oil and gas </p>
<p>export revenues.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> The UK Government assessed that the draft Order clearly provided </p>
<p>for the IHT to continue to operate after the CPA had transferred power to a sovereign </p>
<p>Iraqi Government. </p>
<p>The UK Government argued that the decision on whether to operate an oil trust fund </p>
<p>should be left to a future Iraqi Government. The priority was to rebuild capacity and embed </p>
<p>best practice in the Iraqi Ministries of Finance and Oil; the CPA was working to establish </p>
<p>transparency and good governance in the oil sector, with “strong UK input”. </p>
<p>The proposal was “put on hold” after opposition from Washington and London and within </p>
<p>the CPA.</p>
<p><b>341. </b> From October, the DTI adopted a new approach to pursuing UK objectives in the </p>
<p>oil sector, focused on engaging directly with Iraqi interlocutors rather than with the CPA. </p>

<p><b>344. </b> There were a number of issues to which the DTI needed to respond, including </p>
<p>a “worrying” proposal for eight Iraqi citizens and eight “foreigners” to sit on the Iraq </p>
<p>National Oil Company (INOC) Executive Board. </p>
<p><b>345. </b> Ms MacNaughton proposed five “guiding principles” for the DTI’s engagement </p>
<p>in the oil sector. It should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provide objective information and “informed opinion” in response to Iraqi </p>
<p>requests, but not recommend policies;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>where necessary, work directly and build relationships with the Iraqi </p>
<p>management of INOC and the Ministry of Oil;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continue to seek to increase its sight of US policy and process, including by </p>
<p>continuing to try to deploy an oil policy expert to the CPA; although Mr Fletcher’s </p>
<p>deployment had been “rebuffed repeatedly”, it should remain a priority for the </p>
<p>UK; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ask the British Embassy Washington to redouble its efforts to engage with the </p>
<p>US; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“in extremis”, instruct Sir Jeremy Greenstock (the Prime Minister’s Special </p>
<p>Representative in Iraq) to intervene with the US if CPA policy developments </p>
<p>“contravene our overarching aim of an Iraqi oil industry which is accountable, </p>
<p>transparent, effective and profitable and entirely in the hands of the Iraqis as </p>
<p>soon as this is legally and operationally viable”. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> In a separate background briefing on oil issues, the DTI characterised this new </p>
<p>approach as:</p>
<p>“… dealing directly with the Iraqis … in our belief that the CPA is a transient body </p>
<p>and it is the Iraqis who will be running the business in the long run”.</p>

<p>UK needed better access to policy in the CPA (US officials in Washington were “equally </p>

<p><b>349. </b> ISOG agreed that the DTI should proceed on the basis of principles proposed </p>
<p>by Ms MacNaughton. It also agreed that the UK should lobby again for Mr Fletcher’s </p>

<p><b>350. </b> The Cabinet Office issued the final version of the UK Iraq Strategy (the UK’s first </p>
<p>cross-Whitehall strategy for Iraq) to members of the AHMGIR on 8 October.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>351. </b> The Strategy was set at a high level, was only broadly consistent with the CPA’s </p>
<p>strategy, and was extremely ambitious. Section 9.2 describes the development of the </p>
<p>Strategy, and Section 10.1 the elements relating to reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>352. </b> The Strategy stated that the US had far greater resources than the UK, that UK </p>
<p>influence over US policy was limited and the UK’s approach would be “vulnerable to </p>
<p>shifts in US thinking”.</p>
<p><b>353. </b> The Strategy stated that “to help planning”, Iraq’s recovery should be considered </p>
<p>in three phases: stabilisation, to December 2003; recovery, to December 2004; and </p>
<p>normalisation, from January 2005. The Strategy defined “UK objectives” for each phase </p>
<p>in relation to security, the political process, and reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>354. </b> The Strategy included UK objectives for oil production:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the stabilisation phase (to December 2003), Iraq would reach pre-conflict </p>
<p>levels of “development and order”. Oil production would reach 80 percent of </p>
<p>pre-conflict levels (2m bpd against 2.5m bpd in the pre-conflict period). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the recovery phase, to December 2004, Iraq would exceed pre-conflict levels </p>
<p>of development and order. Oil production would reach 3m bpd, and oil and other </p>
<p>natural resources would be “managed sustainably for the long-term”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the normalisation phase, from January 2005, Iraq would be largely </p>
<p>self-supporting. The Iraqi authorities would be in full control of oil production, </p>
<p>and operating in a transparent manner. </p>

<p><b>359. </b> TPUK advised that the UK’s strategy was:</p>
<p>“… to position UK firms … through the provision of information about contracts, </p>
<p>procurement issues, etc, and to press the US authorities (and the CPA) to ensure </p>
<p>a level playing field on which UK companies can compete.”</p>
<p><b>360. </b> TPUK advised that the US had made it clear that while they welcomed the </p>
<p>participation of UK companies, there was no “special deal”. </p>
<p><b>361. </b> The TPUK paper considered oil and gas contracts separately from other </p>
<p>reconstruction contracts. TPUK advised that oil and gas contracts were let by the DoD, </p>
<p>whose procedures were “opaque” and not as open to non-US companies as other </p>
<p>US-funded contracts. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> TPUK reported that the DTI’s efforts to understand and influence the CPA’s policy </p>
<p>on oil and gas had been “consistently unsuccessful” until Mr Adams’ arrival in the CPA </p>
<p>Oil Team. That had improved the DTI’s understanding to some extent, although they </p>
<p>believed that Mr Adams’ access to information and decision-making meetings had been </p>
<p>restricted by the CPA. </p>
<p><b>363. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 16 October meeting of the AHMGIR stated that the </p>

<p>“… behaved with a degree of secrecy towards the US Administration and Coalition </p>

<p>was for the INOC Executive Board to include eight Iraqi nationals and eight non-Iraqi </p>

<p>consultancy roles. </p>
<p><b>366. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the UK should press for greater access in Washington </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>428</p>
<p><b>367. </b> At the 17 October meeting of ISOG, Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that the </p>
<p>DTI had intervened too early with the US and CPA on oil strategy.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> The CPA Oil Team’s </p>
<p>focus was on reviving production. </p>
<p><b>368. </b> The 21 November meeting of ISOG was advised that Mr David Richmond, the </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s Deputy Special Representative on Iraq, had “again tried to sell a UK oil </p>
<p>policy secondee” to the US, to replace Mr Adams on the CPA Oil Team.</p>
<p>195</p>
<p> He had not </p>
<p>been successful. </p>
<p><b>369. </b> ISOG agreed that the UK should now “abandon this initiative”. ISOG asked the DTI </p>
<p>to consider what more it could do to foster long-term relations with the Iraqi oil industry, </p>
<p>given the CPA’s planned dissolution in summer 2004. </p>
<p><b>370. </b> The IAMB was formally established on 24 October.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> It would not hold its first </p>
<p>meeting until early December.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p><b>371. </b> On 6 November, the US Congress approved the CPA’s request for additional funds, </p>
<p>allocating US$18.4bn to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF2).</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> The funds </p>
<p>were available for two years. Of that, US$1.7bn was allocated for oil infrastructure.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p><b>372. </b> On 15 November, the Iraqi Governing Council unveiled a timetable for the transfer </p>
<p>of sovereignty to a transitional administration (‘the transition’) by 30 June 2004, at which </p>
<p>point the CPA would dissolve.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>373. </b> The OFF programme closed on 21 November, in line with the terms of </p>
<p>resolution 1483. The AHMGIR was advised that responsibility for remaining activity </p>
<p>had passed to the CPA and the Iraqi Ministry of Trade.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> It was not expected that there </p>
<p>would be a threat to food supply. </p>

<p>429</p>
<p><b>376. </b> The 6 January 2004 meeting of ISOG was advised that a forthcoming presentation </p>
<p>by the Iraqi Minister for Oil to the Iraqi Governing Council on the future of the oil sector </p>
<p>might not give due weight to “good governance issues”.</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> The UK would need to </p>
<p>consider whether it needed to intervene; poor governance would delay investment in the </p>
<p>oil sector and be a breach of resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>377. </b> Mr Neil Hirst, Head of the DTI’s Energy Markets Unit, wrote to the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>the following day to set out the issue in more detail.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> He advised that how the oil sector </p>
<p>was handled would have major implications for the future prosperity and stability of </p>
<p>Iraq. The UK Government had launched a major international initiative – the Extractive </p>
<p>Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), led by DFID – to achieve transparency of </p>
<p>natural resource accounting in the developing world. The principle of transparency of </p>
<p>accounting was also set down in resolution 1483. </p>
<p><b>378. </b> Mr Hirst identified two key principles that needed to be established:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a separation of powers between the Iraqi Government as owner and regulator </p>
<p>of energy resources, and the operating company (probably, at least initially, </p>
<p>nationally owned) which developed those resources; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>full transparency of oil accounts, payments and budgets.</p>
<p><b>379. </b> It was unclear to what extent the US would be prepared to exert their influence to </p>
<p>help achieve good governance in the oil sector, particularly in the light of their lukewarm </p>
<p>response to the EITI.</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Section 10.1 describes the development of DFID’s Interim Country Assistance Plan </p>
<p>(I-CAP) for Iraq in December 2003 and January 2004. The I-CAP set priorities for DFID’s </p>
<p>work in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>381. </b> The I-CAP was agreed at the 22 January 2004 meeting of the AHMGIR.</p>
<p>205</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>382. </b> Before the meeting, a DFID official advised Mr Hilary Benn, the International </p>
<p>Development Secretary, that as a result of consultation within Whitehall, DFID had </p>
<p>agreed to engage in oil sector governance to help ensure transparency in the use of </p>
<p>oil revenues.</p>
<p>206</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>383. </b> The I-CAP defined 10 priorities for 2004, including “establishing transparent </p>
<p>systems to ensure that oil revenues are spent for the benefit of all Iraqi people”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>430</p>
<p>leading up to the transition, to working with the US to establish principles of good </p>
<p>governance in the oil sector.</p>
<p>208</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>385. </b> Ms Hewitt reiterated that decisions on the development of Iraq’s oil resources </p>
<p>would be for the Iraqi people. But that was entirely compatible with trying to establish </p>
<p>principles of good governance before the transition. </p>
<p><b>386. </b> Mr Adams had played an important role in getting good governance onto the </p>
<p>CPA’s agenda. A study commissioned by the CPA on the modernisation of the oil </p>
<p>industry had identified a number of key governance principles, including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>properly defined and distinct roles for a national oil company, the Ministry of Oil, </p>
<p>and the Iraqi Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the national oil company to be run on commercial lines with transparent </p>
<p>accounting and auditing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>anti-corruption policies. </p>
<p><b>387. </b> After “considerable effort” by the UK, the US had agreed on the need to establish </p>
<p>those key governance principles. </p>
<p><b>388. </b> Ms Hewitt also reported Sir Jeremy Greenstock’s advice: that making progress </p>
<p>would not be easy “given the lack of a real constituency for good governance amongst </p>
<p>senior Iraqi figures”. </p>
<p><b>389. </b> Mr Straw replied on 29 January, agreeing that the UK should give a high priority to </p>
<p>establishing the principles of good governance in the oil sector before the transition.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>390. </b> As the end of Occupation approached, the UK considered how to ensure that oil </p>
<p>revenues would not be mismanaged under an Iraqi Government. Section 10.1 describes </p>
<p>UK planning for the transition. </p>
<p><b>391. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 1 March meeting of the AHMGIR advised that </p>
<p>a modified version of the DFI should be retained after the transition, in order to </p>
<p>“ensure accountability and transparency”.</p>
<p>210</p>
<p> Otherwise, there was a substantial risk of </p>
<p>mismanagement of oil revenues. The arrangement could also ensure that Iraqi assets </p>
<p>remained immune from claims.</p>
<p><b>392. </b> The Annotated Agenda reported that the DFI currently held US$8.8bn, and paid </p>
<p>for 95 percent of the Iraqi budget. In addition, “substantial DFI funds had been spent </p>
<p>off-budget on the approval of the CPA with intermittent Iraqi representation”. </p>
<p><b>393. </b> The Annotated Agenda did not provide any further details of the “off-budget” </p>
<p>disbursement of DFI funds. </p>

<p>10.3  |  Reconstruction: oil, commercial interests, debt relief, asylum and stabilisation policy </p>
<p>431</p>
<p><b>394. </b> The Annotated Agenda reported that the Treasury proposed:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a single external account for Iraqi oil and other revenue, managed by the </p>
<p>Iraqi Minister of Finance reporting to a Board of Ministers, operating “within </p>
<p>a framework established by a future UNSCR [resolution] which ensures </p>
<p>transparency and accountability”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disbursements solely for the purpose of financing the Iraqi budget; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing external audit by the IAMB, reporting to the Board of Ministers. </p>
<p><b>395. </b> Such an arrangement might be seen in Iraq as a constraint on sovereignty, but </p>
<p>conversely many Iraqis might welcome arrangements which enhanced transparency </p>
<p>and restricted the ability of transitional Ministers to mismanage oil revenues. The US </p>
<p>supported the idea of a modified DFI.</p>
<p><b>396. </b> The AHMGIR agreed that the UK should press for the establishment of transparent </p>
<p>and accountable arrangements for the management of oil and other Iraqi revenues </p>
<p>through the transition period.</p>
<p>211</p>
<p><b>397. </b> Sir Jon Cunliffe told the Inquiry that while the US and the CPA were “very resistant </p>
<p>to external monitoring and external accountability” undertaken by the IAMB: </p>
<p>“When the Iraqi Government itself arrived, I think both Occupying Powers decided </p>
<p>there was joint interest in having transparency, accountability and control [over oil </p>
<p>revenues] and, indeed, I think that the US were with us in pushing for the interim </p>
<p>Iraqi Government to take on the DFI with all of its monitoring machinery.”</p>
<p>212</p>
<p><b>398. </b> The 12 March meeting of the Iraq Strategy Group was advised that rising oil prices </p>
<p>meant that Iraq could fund its “recurrent costs”.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>399. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 14 March that CPA proposals to </p>
<p>improve governance and accounting standards within the Ministry of Oil “faced </p>
<p>resistance”.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> It might be difficult to overcome “vested interests” inside and beyond </p>
<p>the Ministry in the short time left before transition. </p>

<p>215</p>
<p> Mr Benn </p>

<p>after transition.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>402. </b> Section 9.2 describes the further deterioration in the security situation in Iraq from </p>
<p>late March. Attacks on oil infrastructure increased. </p>
<p><b>403. </b> Mr Rycroft sent 19 “unvarnished accounts” of the situation in Iraq, including </p>
<p>one from Mr Dominic Asquith, Deputy Chief Commissioner in the CPA, on oil sector </p>
<p>development, to Mr Blair on 23 April.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>404. </b> Mr Asquith reported that oil production was rising ahead of schedule, but future </p>
<p>capacity was threatened by an early, mistaken focus on repair rather than modernisation </p>
<p>and development.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> Oil production had reached an average of 2.3m bpd by the end of </p>
<p>2003, against a target of 2.0m bpd.</p>
<p><b>405. </b> Mr Asquith also reported that discussions between the Ministry of Oil and the CPA </p>
<p>on raising gasoline prices continued, with the Ministry avoiding any commitment on </p>
<p>a politically contentious issue. Discussions on restructuring the oil industry “remained </p>
<p>mired in politics”. There were persistent but unconfirmed allegations of corruption in </p>
<p>both the State Oil and Marketing Organisation and the Ministry. Ambassador Bremer </p>
<p>had recently appointed a new Inspector General to the Ministry, but after transition his </p>
<p>capacity to monitor financial flows would be tested. International oil companies were </p>

<p>a number of oil sector “liaison officers” within the US Iraq Reconstruction Management </p>
<p>Office (IRMO). The liaison officers “would obviously have less influence and leverage” </p>
<p>than the CPA Oil Team. Mr Thamir Ghadban, Iraqi Minister of Oil, “did not need </p>
<p>telling what to do, and would want to distance himself from the US advisers”. The US </p>
<p>understood that Mr Ghadban intended to set up his own Advisory Group.</p>
<p><b>411. </b> The Embassy assessed that the US remained focused on short-term production </p>
<p>issues, rather than “strategic industry restructuring and governance”. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> The Embassy also reported that policy responsibility for the oil sector within the US </p>
<p>Administration would transfer from the DoD to the State Department on 30 June. </p>

<p>US$14bn was spent.</p>
<p>225</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 10 June 2003, the CPA issued a regulation that gave Ambassador Paul Bremer, </p>
<p>as “Administrator of the CPA”, authority to oversee and control the establishment, </p>
<p>administration and use of the DFI and to direct disbursements from the DFI “for those </p>
<p>purposes he determines to be for the benefit of the Iraqi people”.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The regulation also established a Program Review Board (PRB) to develop funding </p>
<p>plans and make recommendations to Ambassador Bremer on expenditures from the DFI, </p>
<p>“in consultation with the Iraqi interim administration, when established”.</p>
<p>The CPA issued a further regulation on 18 June, detailing the operation of the PRB.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Voting members of the PRB included representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Finance and </p>
<p>the UK. </p>
<p>The Inquiry has seen the records of 60 meetings of the PRB (held between 7 June </p>
<p>2003 and 2 June 2004).</p>
<p>228</p>
<p> Of those records, 55 list the meeting’s attendees. A UK </p>
<p>representative attended 41 of the 55 meetings. The UK was represented by a junior </p>
<p>official on 36 occasions and by a senior official on five. </p>
<p>In March 2004, after an international competitive bidding process, the International </p>
<p>Advisory and Monitoring Board (IAMB) approved the appointment of KPMG to audit DFI </p>
<p>activities.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> A Treasury briefing stated that the CPA had used that process to re-open </p>
<p>debate on the scope of the IAMB’s mandate under resolution 1483.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>The CPA signed the contract with KPMG to audit the DFI on 5 April 2004 – almost </p>
<p>one year after resolution 1483 and less than three months before the CPA would be </p>
<p>dissolved.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> </p>
<p>KPMG delivered its first audit reports, covering oil export sales and DFI operations from </p>
<p>May to December 2003, to the IAMB at the end of June 2004.</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IAMB’s response to the KPMG reports stated:</p>
<p>“KPMG has concluded that all known oil proceeds, reported frozen assets, and</p>
<p> </p>
<p>transfers from the Oil for Food Program had been properly and transparently </p>
<p>accounted for in the DFI. At the same time, based on a review of KPMG reports, the </p>
<p>IAMB believes that CPA controls were insufficient to provide reasonable assurance </p>

<p>US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) audits published in 2004 </p>

<p>“… the CPA failed to exert adequate control of the DFI used to support the Iraqi </p>
<p>national ministries or reconstruction projects. An audit of DFI disbursements to </p>
<p>Iraqi ministries made through the national budget process concluded that the CPA </p>
<p>failed to enforce adequate management, financial, and contractual controls over </p>
<p>approximately US$8.8bn of DFI money. SIGIR found that there was ‘no assurance </p>
<p>that the funds were used for the purposes mandated by [UN] resolution 1483.’”</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer disagreed with SIGIR, arguing that they had failed to account </p>
<p>for the very difficult security environment and the steps taken to improve recognised </p>
<p>management weaknesses. SIGIR acknowledged the danger confronting the CPA, but </p>
<p>found that the CPA’s oversight of Iraqi funds was burdened by severe inefficiencies and </p>
<p>poor management. SIGIR concluded that the chaotic circumstances in Iraq required more </p>
<p>stringent oversight, not less, as the CPA suggested. </p>
<p><i>Hard Lessons</i> concluded that the CPA appeared to be averse to oversight of the DFI. </p>
<p>Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the Prime Minister’s Special Representative on Iraq from </p>
<p>September 2003 to March 2004, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“The UK was not allowed sight of any of the figures on the use of money by the CPA </p>
<p>… A lot of cash was going round in suitcases to be dispensed to Iraqis, not all of </p>
<p>which was accounted for, and I was uncomfortable that I had no sight of this, might </p>
<p>be felt by London to be in some respects responsible for this, and had to explain </p>
<p>clearly that I was not responsible for this, and London made it quite clear that they </p>
<p>didn’t expect me to be responsible for this.</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>“But as you have seen from books on this, from the report of the Special Inspectorate </p>
<p>for Iraq in the US [SIGIR], corruption crept into the system and I felt that I couldn’t do </p>
<p>anything about it.” </p>
<p>The Inquiry asked Sir Jeremy whether he was able to discuss his concerns with </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer. He replied:</p>
<p>“We discussed corruption in the Iraqi administration, but when I asked for details of </p>
<p>economic spending, it was made clear that non-Americans would not be given the </p>
<p>details.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>436</p>
<p>Ms Lindy Cameron, Deputy Head of DFID’s Baghdad Office in 2004, told the Inquiry </p>
<p>that, during the last six months of the CPA, UK officials “helped to do a level of </p>
<p>supervision of how some of the funding was spent that had come from the Iraqi oil </p>
<p>revenues”, but any influence was “more at the tactical level than at the strategic </p>
<p>level”.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Jon Cunliffe told the Inquiry that the CPA had been “very resistant to external </p>
<p>monitoring and external accountability”.</p>

<p><b>414. </b> The Occupation of Iraq formally came to an end on 28 June 2004, two days earlier </p>
<p>than had been originally planned. </p>
<p><b>415. </b> Power was transferred from the CPA and the Governing Council to the Iraqi Interim </p>
<p>Government (IIG) headed by Prime Minister Ayad Allawi.</p>
<p>238</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>416. </b> As set out in resolution 1546 (2004), the IIG took on responsibility for the </p>
<p>disbursement of oil revenues from the US and UK (as Occupying Powers). </p>
<p><b>417. </b> Although oil production remained below pre-war levels, the UK Government </p>
<p>expected that the high oil price (over US$35 per barrel against the budgeted level of </p>
<p>US$22 per barrel) would result in a significant surplus for the Iraqi budget in 2004.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>422. </b> Mr Chaplin made an introductory call on Mr Ghadban on 30 August.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> He reported </p>
<p>that Mr Ghadban’s main priority was maintaining and repairing Iraq’s oil infrastructure. </p>
<p>Attacks were taking place almost daily. Production was around 2.5m bpd; the IIG aimed </p>
<p>to produce 3.25m bpd by the end of 2005. </p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Chaplin reported that Mr Ghadban advocated a gradual and careful reduction </p>
<p>in fuel subsidies (although the IIG as a whole remained reluctant), and the privatisation </p>
<p>of the distribution system. Mr Chaplin had “encouraged” those views. </p>
<p><b>424. </b> Mr Ghadban stated that encouraging investment was key, for example through </p>
<p>internationally accepted models for production-sharing agreements (PSAs) or joint </p>
<p>ventures. He did not favour privatising upstream</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> activities.</p>
<p><b>425. </b> The IPU circulated a first draft of a UK Energy Strategy for Iraq on 18 August.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>426. </b> A junior official at the British Embassy Baghdad commented on the draft on </p>
<p>25 August, highlighting the need to be realistic about what the IIG could deliver in the </p>
<p>period before the January 2005 elections: </p>
<p>“While Ghadban and others may have every intention of looking longer term and </p>
<p>plotting a strategy for the industry, the day-to-day running of the network/fire-fighting </p>
<p>is taking up the bulk of everyone’s energies just now – and is likely to continue doing </p>
<p>so. The IIG is desperate to show improvements in the supply of electricity and fuel </p>
<p>as soon as possible. That means focusing efforts on ensuring that oil continues to </p>
<p>flow to the power stations and refineries, and stocks are built up.”</p>
<p>247</p>
<p><b>427. </b> The IPU circulated a final version of the UK Energy Strategy for Iraq on </p>
<p>6 September.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> The Strategy identified two UK objectives:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the development of an efficient, outward looking and transparent oil and energy </p>
<p>industry, capable of delivering both sustainable export revenues to meet Iraq’s </p>
<p>development needs and meeting domestic needs for energy in an efficient, </p>
<p>equitable and secure manner; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s energy sector development to be complemented by the increasing </p>
<p>involvement of UK firms, leading to sustained investment over the next five to </p>
<p>10 years and substantial business for the UK.” </p>
<p><b>428. </b> The Strategy stated that the IIG had established a Supreme Council for Oil and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>438</p>
<p>constrained by the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL) in its ability to make decisions </p>
<p>affecting Iraq’s “long-term destiny”. Key strategic decisions were therefore unlikely to be </p>
<p>taken until after January 2005. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> The Strategy stated that to meet the UK’s objectives, the main challenge for Iraq’s </p>
<p>oil industry would be to institute the structural, fiscal and regulatory reform needed to </p>
<p>attract foreign direct investment (FDI). In the absence of a “very high” oil price, Iraq </p>
<p>would only be able to finance the investment necessary to raise production if it achieved </p>
<p>a very generous debt relief deal and was prepared to cut government spending in other </p>
<p>areas. As the latter was “not realistic”, Iraq would need FDI. </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Improved governance in the energy sector also remained key to achieving the UK’s </p>
<p>objectives. </p>
<p><b>431. </b> The Strategy stated that the argument that Iraq’s energy development needs were </p>
<p>best served by FDI would be politically sensitive, both in Iraq (where it would touch </p>
<p>on issues of sovereignty) and internationally. The Iraqi Government was aware of the </p>
<p>scale of funding needed, but “less convinced” of the need for this to come through FDI. </p>
<p>The Strategy concluded:</p>
<p>“We will wish to push the message on FDI to the Iraqis in private, but it will require </p>
<p>careful handling to avoid the impression that we are trying to push the Iraqis down </p>
<p>one particular path.”</p>
<p><b>432. </b> The Strategy also set out the “key considerations” that shaped it:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s objectives on energy security: Iraq had the second or third largest </p>
<p>proven oil reserves in the world, and significant reserves of natural gas; </p>
<p>sustainable increases in Iraqi oil and gas production would contribute to global </p>
<p>energy security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK’s commercial objectives; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s need for fiscal stability, in particular given its high level of debt and the </p>
<p>continuing need to finance reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>433. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that the Strategy was seen by Ministers or </p>
<p>senior officials. </p>
<p><b>434. </b> A junior official at the British Embassy Baghdad reported on 8 September </p>
<p>that Prime Minister Allawi had recently issued ‘Guidelines on Petroleum Policy’ </p>

<p> The official summarised those guidelines as: </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>An independent, public, Iraqi National Oil Company (INOC) should be </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Foreign investment (combined where possible with domestic private capital) </p>
<p>should finance the development of new fields and refineries. Joint public/private </p>

<p>and promoting the continuation of a structure for the transparent management of oil </p>

<p>Government.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> The silence from the Ministry on the UK’s offer to help develop model </p>

<p><b>451. </b> The Iraqi official commented that the chief task of the new Iraqi Government would </p>
<p>be to agree a Constitution; the Ministry would, in parallel, develop a Petroleum Law. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>442</p>
<p><b>453. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 16 May that the new Minister of Oil, </p>
<p>Mr Ibrahim Bahr Al-Ulum, had now taken up his post.</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> Mr Al-Ulum had stated that </p>
<p>his priorities were to increase production and tackle corruption. Production averaged </p>
<p>2.1m bpd, consistently below the Ministry’s 2.5m bpd target. Fuel stocks were healthy.</p>
<p><b>454. </b> The Embassy also reported that insurgent attacks on oil infrastructure had “tailed </p>
<p>off” since the elections, although the effect of attacks could still be dramatic. </p>
<p><b>455. </b> The IPU provided an update on oil and commercial issues for Mr John Sawers, </p>
<p>FCO Political Director, on 25 May, at his request.</p>
<p>263</p>
<p> The IPU advised that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Petroleum Law would be a key piece of legislation, establishing the </p>
<p>regulatory framework for Iraq’s energy sector, including the approach to foreign </p>
<p>investment. Major international oil companies would want to see transparent </p>
<p>rules established. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Ministry of Oil would start drafting the Petroleum Law alongside the drafting </p>
<p>of the Constitution. The UK had not been asked for help in drafting the Law, </p>
<p>although the UK did plan to take forward the FCO project to help the Ministry </p>
<p>develop transparent petroleum contracts.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK Government’s view was that a high level of oil company involvement </p>
<p>in drafting the Petroleum Law could be counter productive: “This should be </p>
<p>an Iraqi-drafted law and it will be for them to decide their approach to foreign </p>
<p>investment.” The UK would, however, want to encourage the Iraqi Government </p>
<p>to consult widely in the process, including with oil companies. The UK could </p>
<p>facilitate that exchange.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>There had been no discussions with the Iraqi Government on a UK/Iraq </p>
<p>commercial agreement (which could provide a framework for trade and </p>
<p>investment), but such an agreement might be beneficial.</p>
<p><b>456. </b> Representatives from Shell advised officials from the British Embassy Washington </p>
<p>on 31 May that Shell wanted to see “a Constitution in place” before making a “serious </p>
<p>investment” in Iraq.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> Most major oil companies were similarly “keeping a low profile”.</p>
<p><b>457. </b> In June 2005, FCO, DTI and DFID officials developed an Iraq Oil and Gas </p>
<p>Strategy.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>458. </b> The Iraq Oil and Gas Strategy, the UK’s second post-Occupation oil strategy, </p>
<p>shared much of the analysis presented in the September 2004 UK Energy Strategy </p>
<p>for Iraq. It added a third UK objective – promoting Iraq’s role within the international </p>
<p>oil market and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). </p>

<p>443</p>
<p><b>459. </b> The Strategy defined three UK objectives: </p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The development of an efficient, outward-looking and transparent oil and </p>
<p>gas industry, capable of delivering sustainable export revenues to meet the </p>
<p>development needs of the people of Iraq and meeting domestic needs for </p>
<p>energy in an efficient, equitable and secure manner.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Increasing involvement of the private sector, leading to sustained investment </p>
<p>over the next five to 10 years and substantial business for UK companies … </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To promote Iraq’s role in international oil and gas markets and as a constructive </p>
<p>influence within OPEC.”</p>
<p><b>460. </b> The Strategy stated that, in the absence of an “extremely high” oil price, only </p>
<p>the international oil companies could provide the funding necessary to achieve rapid </p>
<p>rehabilitation or significant new development. </p>
<p><b>461. </b> The Strategy set out four considerations that shaped it:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Energy security. The UK was expected to be a net importer of oil by 2010. </p>
<p>Against a backdrop of volatile prices and limited spare global production </p>
<p>capacity, sustainable increases in Iraqi production would make a large </p>
<p>contribution to global energy security.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s commercial and international development goals, including Iraq’s fiscal </p>
<p>stability given the need to finance reconstruction. The idea that Iraq’s energy </p>
<p>development needs were best served through FDI would be politically sensitive, </p>
<p>both in Iraq and internationally. The UK would “promote the message on FDI to </p>
<p>the Iraqis in private, but it will require careful handling to avoid the impression </p>
<p>that we are trying to push the Iraqis down one particular path”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The need for energy price reform, required under the IMF programme.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Oil development and the Constitution. </p>
<p><b>462. </b> Mr Straw sent the Strategy to Mr Blair on 12 July.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> In his covering letter, Mr Straw </p>
<p>wrote: </p>
<p>“Oil and gas will inevitably form the economic foundation for Iraq’s future and </p>
<p>remains important for the UK commercially and in terms of energy security.  </p>
<p>Foreign investment is badly needed and we need to continue to support Iraq to </p>
<p>create the right framework for investment, while also supporting UK companies to </p>
<p>engage. And we should continue working with the Iraqi Government to ensure the oil </p>
<p>sector develops transparently and along lines of international best practice.”</p>
<p><b>463. </b> Mr David Quarrey, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary, sent the Strategy to Sir Nigel </p>

<p>268</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>465. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Blair on 5 July with an update on the constitutional </p>
<p>process.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p> Section 9.4 describes the development of the Iraqi Constitution from June </p>
<p>2005 to its adoption in October 2005. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Mr Straw attached a paper produced by the FCO Research Analysts which set out </p>
<p>the substantive issues that the Constitutional Committee needed to address, and the </p>
<p>UK’s view on those issues. He advised Mr Blair that the paper would serve as the UK’s </p>
<p>“reference point” during the negotiations on the Constitution. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> The paper recognised the importance of control over natural resources in the </p>
<p>debate on federalism.</p>
<p>270</p>
<p> The Kurdish authorities were expected to champion the </p>
<p>devolution of oil revenues and the ability to manage their own economic development. </p>
<p>Shia Arabs were increasingly calling for some sort of economic federalism for the South </p>
<p>and a greater share of Iraq’s oil revenues. The UK had “a strong interest in avoiding any </p>
<p>arrangement which would entrench sectarian divisions, e.g. a single large federation in </p>
<p>the South”.</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Mr Straw wrote to DOP(I) members on 13 October, advising them that “despite its </p>
<p>inevitable deficiencies, the draft Constitution represents a major achievement”.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>469. </b> Mr Straw attached an IPU paper which identified the “potential points of contention” </p>
<p>within the draft Constitution, including natural resources:</p>
<p>“The ambiguities in the text were necessary to secure agreement. But they also </p>
<p>pave the way for difficulties in the future. Perhaps the worst offender … is Article 109 </p>
<p>on oil and gas, which is a model of imprecision.”</p>
<p>272</p>
<p><b>470. </b> The IPU stated that Article 109 of the draft Constitution specified that the current </p>
<p>oil and gas resources would be managed by the federal Government “with the producing </p>
<p>governorates and regional governments” in a manner to be regulated by a law. </p>
<p><b>471. </b> The IPU commented that the law would need to clarify what “with” meant in that </p>
<p>context. </p>

<p>a UK company did the same.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>473. </b> Mr Dominic Asquith, FCO Director Iraq, advised officials on 6 December that, in </p>
<p>dealing with previous approaches from UK companies, he had said that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>any contract must be with the explicit agreement of the Iraqi Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>any contract must have the support of the KRG, rather than any one element </p>
<p>of it;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>even then, the legal position would be “fragile”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“so wait until things become clearer”.</p>
<p>274</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>474. </b> FCO and IPU officials agreed that those lines were appropriate.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr William Patey, British Ambassador to Iraq, reported on 13 December 2005 that:</p>
<p>“Oil is the critical factor in Iraq’s economic revival. Increased revenue in 2006 </p>
<p>will depend on a continued programme of rehabilitation of current wells and </p>
<p>infrastructure and, more importantly, improved security in the north.  </p>
<p>Serious increases will require more radical surgery. The new Government will need </p>
<p>to focus quickly on commercialising the oil industry and a legislative framework to </p>
<p>attract investment. The future will be complicated by discussions on constitutional </p>
<p>provisions.”</p>
<p>276</p>
<p><b>476. </b> The pace of rehabilitation was slow. The Ministry of Oil spent less than 10 percent </p>
<p>of its annual capital investment budget of US$3bn (the money was used instead to pay </p>
<p>for additional subsidised fuel imports). </p>
<p><b>477. </b> There were rumours that a number of draft Petroleum Laws existed, but no one </p>
<p>had seen them. The provisions in the Constitution on oil were unclear; ownership of </p>
<p>the oil and how it should be managed would need to be clarified by the Constitutional </p>
<p>Committee. </p>
<p><b>478. </b> In its dialogue with potential Prime Ministers, the Embassy had emphasised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of “getting the oil sector right” and of increasing production;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for greater World Bank involvement in the sector, which would give </p>
<p>access to additional financing on good terms and policy advice; and</p>

<p>277</p>
<p> Negotiations to form a new </p>
<p>government continued into spring 2006. </p>
<p><b>480. </b> On 2 March 2006, DOP(I) considered a joint FCO/DTI paper setting out the UK’s </p>
<p>objectives for Iraq’s oil and gas sector.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>481. </b> The UK’s third post-Occupation oil strategy set out a more cautious position on </p>
<p>the potential role of the private sector, including private financing. </p>
<p><b>482. </b> The FCO/DTI paper set out three “mutually reinforcing” UK objectives:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq’s successful economic development;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to promote Iraq’s contribution to global energy security, and its role as a </p>
<p>constructive influence within OPEC; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to support UK companies.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>483. </b> The paper stated that raising oil production would require significant new </p>
<p>investment. Iraq was unlikely to be able to finance that investment from its own </p>
<p>resources, and did not have recent experience of the regulatory, fiscal and administrative </p>
<p>framework needed to make optimal use of private investment or the technical and </p>
<p>managerial expertise to manage a rapid expansion of the industry. A key challenge </p>
<p>for the Iraqi Government was therefore to access external financing and expertise. </p>
<p>Iraq’s first step should be to engage with “experienced development partners”, and </p>
<p>specifically the World Bank, which could provide independent advice on the development </p>
<p>of an appropriate regulatory, fiscal and administrative framework. Its second step should </p>
<p>be to engage with international oil companies (IOCs) and oil service companies (OSCs), </p>
<p>which could bring in technical expertise and capital. </p>
<p><b>484. </b> Any form of engagement with the IOCs would be politically sensitive. The “most </p>
<p>straightforward” form, and the one most likely to result in a rapid increase in production, </p>
<p>was FDI; but the “appropriateness” of FDI and the contractual form it might take, along </p>
<p>with the internal distribution of oil revenues, would be hotly contested issues within the </p>
<p>constitutional review process. Neither Saudi Arabia nor Iran allowed PSAs, “the form of </p>
<p>FDI most favoured by IOCs”. The paper concluded that “other options such as debt/bond </p>
<p>finance and joint ventures should also be considered”. </p>
<p><b>485. </b> The paper stated that IOCs, including BP, Shell and other UK companies, were not </p>
<p>currently working in Iraq due to the security situation and the lack of a foreign investment </p>
<p>law. BP and Shell were engaged on technical studies of oilfields and were providing </p>
<p>training to Iraqi officials. </p>

<p>447</p>
<p><b>486. </b> The paper identified five risks to UK objectives, including: <b>“The US dominates the </b></p>
<p><b>field in advising Iraq on energy sector development.”</b></p>
<p><b>487. </b> Dr Kim Howells, FCO Minister of State, introduced the paper at the 2 March DOP(I) </p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> He highlighted the centrality of oil to Iraq’s economy, and reported that he </p>
<p>planned to visit southern Iraq shortly to look at issues relating to the southern oil fields. </p>
<p>Mr Malcolm Wicks, DTI Minister of State, described projections that Iraq could produce </p>
<p>7.9m bpd by 2030 as very significant in the global and UK context. The UK was already </p>
<p>working closely with IOCs and Iraq on energy issues. </p>
<p><b>488. </b> In discussion, Ministers commented that oil and gas would continue to be the </p>
<p>bedrock of Iraq’s economy, but diversification was essential in the medium term. </p>
<p><b>489. </b> DOP(I) agreed that Ministers should discuss the oil sector again after Dr Howells’ </p>
<p>visit to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>490. </b> Dr Howells visited Iraq later that month. He reported to Mr Straw on 23 March that </p>
<p>the delay in forming a Government and doubts over Iraq’s commercial legal framework </p>
<p>were constraining investment in the oil sector, but that the biggest barrier to investment </p>
<p>remained the security situation.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p> He recommended that the UK should consider what </p>
<p>its military forces could do to provide security for international investors:</p>
<p>“Such a joint operation [coalition military forces and Iraqi Security Forces] would </p>
<p>mean a different focus for our forces in the South. It would entail a shift from the </p>
<p>urban concerns of Basra to … desert-located oil installations … I suggest the FCO </p>
<p>discuss it at the earliest opportunity with the MOD.”</p>
<p><b>491. </b> There are no indications that Dr Howells’ proposal was discussed by Ministers or </p>
<p>senior officials.</p>
<p><b>492. </b> Following the 2 March DOP(I) meeting and Dr Howells’ visit, the IPU assessed that </p>
<p>Ministers would be keen to discuss the future of the oil sector again, and by the end of </p>
<p>March had begun work to develop a “comprehensive programme of engagement” for the </p>
<p>oil sector, covering:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>engagement with UK oil companies in support of their activities; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>engagement with the Iraqi Government on strategic policy issues.</p>

<p>Dr Hawramy asked the UK to stop discouraging IOCs from investing in the Kurdish </p>

<p><b>503. </b> An IPU official commented:</p>
<p>“While … IOCs such as Shell and BP are currently unwilling to invest in the KRG, </p>
<p>as the gap widens between the investment climate in the KRG and the rest of the </p>

<p>a KRG Petroleum Law is going to be increasingly tempting.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“We were expecting him [Dr Hawramy] to express irritation at being excluded from </p>

<p> It was the </p>

<p><b>505. </b> KRG Prime Minister Barzani told Dr Howells that relations between the KRG and </p>

<p><b>506. </b> Dr Hawramy outlined the KRG’s draft Oil Plan and Petroleum Law. Dr Howells </p>
<p>encouraged Dr Hawramy to “work through” the Oil Plan with the federal Government, </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>510. </b> The briefing also stated that the issue of corruption and transparency was rising </p>
<p>up the UK’s agenda in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>511. </b> At the meeting, Dr Shahristani said the Iraqi Government’s aim was to get the </p>
<p>Hydrocarbons Law through Parliament by the end of 2006.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> He asked Mr Wicks </p>
<p>whether the UK could play a role in lobbying for a national, rather than regional, </p>
<p>approach to signing oil exploration contracts. Mr Wicks agreed to reflect on how that </p>
<p>message could best be conveyed. </p>
<p><b>512. </b> A junior official in the British Embassy Baghdad reported on 21 September that </p>
<p>there was little support for the EITI within the Ministry of Oil.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> The official identified </p>
<p>a number of possible approaches to increase support, including asking the IOCs to </p>
<p>express their support for the EITI to the Iraqi Government, as: “The Oil Ministry cares </p>
<p>more about what they [the IOCs] think than about what we think.” </p>
<p><b>513. </b> The work to develop a “comprehensive programme of engagement” for the oil </p>
<p>sector that was initiated in March concluded in September with the production of a paper </p>
<p>entitled, ‘Iraq: Building a Framework for Oil Sector Development’.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>514. </b> The paper stated that:</p>
<p>“Our [the UK’s] starting point is that decisions on oil sector management could </p>
<p>support or fatally undermine efforts to preserve the territorial integrity and democratic </p>
<p>development of Iraq. Our key concern is therefore to preserve the integrity and </p>
<p>competence of the Iraqi state as a basis for national unity, as well as to create </p>
<p>a long-term basis for transparency and adequate investment in the sector.”</p>
<p><b>515. </b> The paper defined four principles which would guide the UK’s approach:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The oil industry should be structured to allow for managerial and financial </p>
<p>autonomy of business units, “within an environment principally regulated at </p>
<p>the federal (national) level”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The emphasis should be on creating an effective public sector national oil </p>
<p>company. Within that overall framework, and subject to decisions by the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government, private resources accessed through FDI, bonds, and commercial </p>
<p>and concessional lending were likely to be needed.</p>

<p>Any agreement on resource management must be accompanied by a </p>
<p>guaranteed revenue-sharing formula acceptable to the KRG and Iraq’s </p>
<p>governorates. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Transparency in the role of government institutions and in the collection and </p>
<p>disbursement of revenues was critical. The UK endorsed the principles of </p>
<p>the EITI. </p>
<p><b>516. </b> The paper set out the UK’s lobbying strategy in support of those principles, and </p>
<p>stated: </p>
<p>“The current situation is characterised by severe constitutional uncertainty, a low </p>
<p>level of trust between the key players and a lack of sense of urgency on the part </p>
<p>of the Ministry of Oil. </p>
<p>“On most interpretations, the current text of the Constitution leaves the federal </p>
<p>Government emasculated on oil sector management. Promoting the vision outlined </p>
<p>in the main body of this paper will therefore be difficult …” </p>
<p><b>517. </b> The paper stated that the KRG refused to countenance the possibility that </p>
<p>the “substantive” concessions they had won in the constitutional negotiations – </p>
<p>which gave regional authorities control over the development of new fields and on </p>
<p>some interpretations the rights to revenues from those fields – would be revisited. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the KRG was “putting facts on the ground” by signing PSAs with </p>
<p>“mainly small, high-risk” IOCs, and moving ahead quickly with its own Petroleum Law. </p>
<p><b>518. </b> A junior official at the British Embassy Baghdad commented that since 2003 </p>
<p>successive interim and transitional Iraqi Governments had not had the opportunity to </p>
<p>address oil sector management.</p>

<p> The issue was now “rising up the agenda” in Iraq, </p>
<p>and the UK had to be ready to engage at a senior level. </p>

<p>2006. </p>
<p><b>520. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported on 1 November that the Ministry of Oil </p>
<p>had sent a draft Hydrocarbons Law to the Council of Ministers, for consideration before </p>

<p>297</p>
<p> The Embassy had seen a version of </p>
<p>the draft Law. It made clear that oil resources must be controlled by central Government, </p>
<p>and cited Article 109 of the Constitution (which stated that oil and gas resources were </p>
<p>the property of the whole nation) in support of that position. The Embassy commented </p>
<p>that it was unlikely that the KRG would accept the draft. </p>

<p><b>521. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad produced a “core script” setting out the UK’s </p>
<p>response to the draft Hydrocarbons Law on 7 November.</p>
<p>298</p>
<p> Key messages for the UK </p>
<p>to relay to Iraqi contacts included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was crucial that an agreed national law was passed soon, given the </p>
<p>importance of oil to national economic and security interests.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraqi Constitution stated that oil resources belonged to all Iraqi citizens. </p>
<p>The federal Government was best placed to ensure that those resources were </p>
<p>developed to the maximum benefit for all Iraqi citizens.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A national law should be agreed before the KRG passed a regional law. </p>
<p><b>522. </b> UK officials continued to meet regularly with Ministers and senior officials </p>
<p>in the Iraqi Government and the KRG to discuss progress towards agreeing a </p>
<p>Hydrocarbon Law. </p>
<p><b>523. </b> The IPU provided Dr Howells with an update on negotiations on a Hydrocarbons </p>
<p>Law on 14 February 2007.</p>
<p>299</p>
<p> While there was not yet any agreement, there was a </p>
<p>“strong impetus to achieve consensus”. President Bush had indentified the passing of </p>
<p>the Hydrocarbons Law as a key indicator of progress in Iraq. The US Ambassador was </p>
<p>working hard to bring the key players together. The UK had “remained in close touch </p>
<p>with the key negotiators … in support”. </p>
<p><b>524. </b> The update advised that the latest draft Hydrocarbons Law addressed only two </p>
<p>of the four principles which the UK had defined in September 2006 (it would establish </p>
<p>a national public-sector oil company and contained helpful clauses on transparency). </p>
<p><b>525. </b> The update proposed that, while the UK’s influence was “limited”, it should, </p>
<p>alongside the US, continue to lobby key Iraqi players, and encourage the IMF and </p>
<p>World Bank to play an active role in providing assistance and advice on the more </p>
<p>technical aspects of the negotiations.</p>
<p><b>526. </b> Dr Howells accepted that proposal, and agreed that the UK’s influence was </p>
<p>limited.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>527. </b> Mr Asquith reported from Baghdad in May that disagreements continued over </p>
<p>the extent of regional authority in the oil sector and on the implications of foreign </p>
<p>investment.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“The political mood makes quick passage of the HCL [Hydrocarbons Law] unlikely. </p>
<p>Differences between the Kurds and Baghdad go beyond simple posturing, with </p>

<p>302</p>

<p> </p>
<p>There were three priorities to boost economic growth: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining macroeconomic stability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the public sector; and</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>535. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad provided an update on the oil sector in January </p>
<p>2008.</p>
<p>307</p>
<p> The Embassy reported that with negotiations stalled, the KRG had passed </p>
<p>its own regional Hydrocarbons Law in August 2007 and “vigorously resumed signing </p>
<p>contracts”. Dr Shahristani had pronounced those contracts illegal and void and the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government had threatened to boycott all companies that signed contracts with </p>
<p>the KRG.</p>
<p><b>536. </b> The Iraqi Government and the KRG continued to discuss a Hydrocarbons Law, but </p>
<p>“fundamental personality clashes and political obstacles” remained and early progress </p>
<p>was unlikely. The US continued to “shepherd” the negotiations, but to little effect. </p>
<p><b>537. </b> In the update, the Embassy did not report on or propose any UK action with </p>
<p>respect to the Hydrocarbons Law. </p>
<p><b>538. </b> The Embassy also reported that, as those negotiations continued, the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government was pursuing technical service agreements (TSAs) with IOCs to improve </p>
<p>oil production in five major oilfields. The Embassy commented that the TSAs were </p>
<p>less attractive to IOCs than PSAs and would increase production by only a “fraction” </p>
<p>of what might be achieved under PSAs. There remained substantial political resistance, </p>
<p>“on sovereignty grounds”, to PSAs within the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>539. </b> Oil production in 2007 had averaged 2.1m bpd, the same as in 2006. Higher oil </p>
<p>prices – US$73 a barrel in 2007 against US$65 in 2006 – had meant higher revenues – </p>
<p>US$41bn in 2007 against US$31bn in 2006. </p>

<p>sharing; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government’s reliance on oil revenues (which comprised more than </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>552. </b> Sir Mark Lyall Grant, FCO Political Director, told the Inquiry that the strategy </p>
<p>reflected the strategic importance of Iraq to the UK: </p>
<p>“There is no doubt in my mind that Iraq is a very important strategic country for </p>
<p>the United Kingdom … and that, therefore, we should have a long-term strategic </p>
<p>relationship with Iraq … </p>
<p>“The reason I say that on Iraq is because Iraq is a country which sits on the dividing </p>
<p>line between Persia and the Arab world. It sits on the dividing line between Sunni </p>
<p>and Shia communities. It is a neighbour of Turkey, and, therefore, could be a </p>
<p>neighbour of the European Union, if Turkey joins the European Union. It has got </p>

<p><b>556. </b> From 20 September 2002, the Cabinet Office-led Ad Hoc Group on Iraq (AHGI) </p>
<p>co-ordinated all non-military cross-government work on post-conflict issues. The focus </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>458</p>
<p><b>559. </b> The record of the first AHGI meeting stated that work should remain “as internal </p>
<p>thinking within departments” for the next few weeks.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>560. </b> The AHGI remained the principal Whitehall co-ordination mechanism for </p>
<p>non-military Iraq planning until the creation of the inter-departmental Iraq Planning Unit </p>
<p>(IPU) in February 2003. </p>
<p><b>561. </b> The AHGI did not commission or receive any papers relating to UK commercial </p>
<p>interests in a post-conflict Iraq during its operation. </p>
<p><b>562. </b> On 12 September 2002, Sir David Manning, the Head of OD Sec and Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>Foreign Policy Adviser, commissioned a paper from the FCO setting out what a post-</p>
<p>Saddam Government might look like.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p><b>563. </b> The FCO sent its paper on post-Saddam government in Iraq, entitled ‘Scenarios </p>
<p>for the future of Iraq after Saddam’, to Sir David on 26 September.</p>
<p>322</p>
<p> It was circulated </p>
<p>separately to the AHGI. </p>
<p><b>564. </b> The paper stated that to influence developments on Iraq, the UK needed “the </p>
<p>clearest possible sense of our objectives for Iraq”. The UK’s “fundamental interest </p>
<p>in a stable region providing secure supplies of oil to world markets” suggested four </p>
<p>overarching priorities: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>termination of Iraq’s WMD programme and permanent removal of the threat </p>
<p>it posed; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a more inclusive and effective Iraqi Government; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a viable Iraq which was not a threat to its neighbours; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an end to Iraqi support for international terrorism. </p>
<p><b>565. </b> The UK also had a number of “second order” objectives, including ensuring that </p>
<p>British companies benefitted from any post-war reconstruction contracts. </p>
<p><b>566. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer, British Ambassador to the US, responded to the paper </p>
<p>by questioning whether it was right to classify securing reconstruction contracts as a </p>
<p>second order objective.</p>
<p>323</p>
<p> Russia and France were, by all accounts, anxious about their </p>
<p>economic interests in Iraq after Saddam Hussein. UK interests were not something to </p>
<p>press immediately, but should be a “top priority” in post-Saddam contingency planning. </p>
<p>Mr Blair would have to pursue the issue with President Bush if the UK were to have </p>
<p>any impact.</p>

<p><b>568. </b> An oil industry representative called on Mr Edward Chaplin, FCO Director Middle </p>

<p> There were rumours that some countries would “sell their support” for US </p>

<p>Baroness Symons, joint Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)/FCO Minister of State </p>

<p>internal and at a very early stage”.</p>
<p>327</p>
<p> TPUK had made provision for a Commercial Officer </p>
<p>to be included in the initial stage of a re-established UK mission in Baghdad. There were </p>
<p>likely to be significant commercial opportunities for UK firms, although there were limits </p>
<p>on what TPUK could do to identify those opportunities:</p>
<p>“For the moment there is some sensitivity to giving prominence to the commercial </p>
<p>aspects. We are keen to avoid giving the impression that commercial interests are </p>
<p>driving our policy in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>572. </b> On 25 October, Mr Tony Brenton, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy </p>
<p>Washington, reported a conversation with Vice President Dick Cheney’s office, in which </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>460</p>
<p><b>573. </b> Representatives of BP, Shell and British Gas met Baroness Symons on 31 October </p>
<p>to discuss their concerns.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> Mr Christopher Segar, Head of the FCO’s Aviation Maritime </p>
<p>and Energy Department (AMED), reported that all three companies had argued that </p>
<p>they had been scrupulous in observing sanctions but were keen to play a part in any </p>
<p>reconstruction effort. They did not want a privileged position but equally did not want to </p>
<p>be “locked out” through deals done by the US for wider political purposes. They wanted </p>
<p>a “level playing field”.</p>
<p><b>574. </b> In response, Baroness Symons had said that, given the Russians’ considerable </p>
<p>economic interest in Iraq, it was “very possible that a deal or deals” might be under </p>
<p>discussion in the US. </p>
<p><b>575. </b> Baroness Symons reported her meeting to Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, </p>
<p>and commented: </p>
<p>“I said that we could not make any definitive undertakings [on securing contracts], </p>
<p>given our determination that any action in relation to Iraq is prompted by our </p>
<p>concerns over WMD, and not a desire for commercial gains.</p>
<p>“However, I undertook to draw this issue to your attention as a matter of urgency. </p>
<p>They were genuinely convinced that deals were being struck and that British </p>
<p>interests are being left to one side.”</p>
<p>330</p>
<p><b>576. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on 31 October that it had reassured BP </p>
<p>representatives that the Embassy had seen no evidence of any deals.</p>
<p>331</p>
<p> The Embassy </p>
<p>had agreed to “keep a watchful eye”. </p>
<p><b>577. </b> The Cabinet Office reported to Sir David Manning on 31 October that the </p>
<p>instruction to departments not to engage with external actors on contingency planning </p>
<p>for post-conflict Iraq (confirmed in the record of the first meeting of the AGHI on  </p>
<p>20 September) was, in practice, being overtaken.</p>
<p>332</p>
<p> There was particular pressure for </p>
<p>consultation from the UK oil industry; a delegation from BP would be visiting the FCO </p>
<p>on 6 November. </p>

<p>do about it?”</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>580. </b> On 8 November, the AHGI confirmed that departments were now “encouraged, </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>581. </b> Sir Christopher Meyer wrote to Sir David Manning on 15 November, reporting the </p>
<p>Embassy’s recent discussions with UK oil industry representatives:</p>
<p>“We have made clear that the US motivation as regards Iraq parallels our own: </p>
<p>this is a matter of national security, not oil. We emphasised the flat denials we </p>
<p>have received from State Department that any such discussions [between non-UK </p>
<p>companies and the US Administration] are under way. </p>
<p>“Nevertheless, the rumours persist. It is not clear … what went on behind the scenes </p>
<p>at the US/Russia energy ‘summit’ in Houston last month … We have seen a report </p>
<p>from our team at CENTCOM [US Central Command] which suggests that the </p>
<p>Pentagon has already awarded a contract to Kellogg, Brown and Root, a subsidiary </p>
<p>of Halliburton, to restore the Iraqi oil industry to production levels of 3m bpd … We </p>
<p>have so far been unable to obtain collateral for this from the Administration, and it </p>
<p>might well in any case amount to no more than prudent contingency planning to </p>
<p>stabilise Iraqi oil facilities if Saddam attempts to damage them in a conflict.</p>
<p>“Either way, there is clearly an issue here which we need to tackle … My view </p>
<p>remains that the only realistic way in to this is via a PM [Mr Blair] intervention with </p>
<p>Bush … The points to make would be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Once Saddam has been disarmed … Iraq’s oil industry will be central to … </p>
<p>economic recovery.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We, as you, have energy majors who have skills and resources to help …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To give the lie to suggestions that this campaign is all about oil, it is vitally </p>
<p>important that, once sanctions are lifted, there is seen to be a level playing field </p>
<p>for all companies to work in Iraq.”</p>
<p>337</p>
<p><b>582. </b> Sir Christopher stated that “by being too squeamish and slow off the mark, the UK </p>
<p>did badly out of the Kuwait reconstruction contracts in 1991”. The approach outlined </p>
<p>above was the least the UK should do, to avoid a similar outcome. </p>

<p>“It would be inappropriate for HMG [Her Majesty’s Government] to enter into </p>

<p>During “Stage 1”, a small number of UK companies would want UK Government </p>
<p>help to gain quick access to infrastructure that they had installed in Iraq, as part </p>
<p>of the humanitarian and reconstruction effort but also “to protect their competitive </p>
<p>advantage”. Planning would require close consultation with the MOD.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>During “Stage 2”, TPUK would provide UK companies with information </p>
<p>on opportunities arising from the initial stages of the humanitarian and </p>
<p>reconstruction effort. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>During “Stage 3”, TPUK would help UK companies position themselves to take </p>
<p>advantage of short- and medium-term reconstruction contracts. Close contact </p>
<p>with the US would be a key factor. </p>
<p><b>595. </b> Mr Henderson advised that UK companies were arguing strongly that the UK </p>
<p>Government should press the US Government to guarantee a “level playing field” for UK </p>
<p>companies on reconstruction contracts, including for oil and gas contracts. Six business </p>
<p>representatives had recently written to Baroness Symons, expressing their concern that </p>
<p>the UK was not extracting sufficient commercial advantage from its support for the US. </p>

<p><b>596. </b> Mr Henderson concluded by commenting that although TPUK participated in </p>
<p>the weekly meetings of the AHGI: </p>
<p>“… the overall Whitehall agenda appears to attach little importance to the </p>
<p>commercial aspect and the interests of UK companies.”</p>
<p><b>597. </b> Mr Geoff Hoon, the Defence Secretary, discussed post-conflict issues with </p>
<p>Mr Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, and Dr Rice in Washington on  </p>
<p>12 February. </p>

<p>version of the UK’s “key messages” on post-conflict Iraq on 11 February, for Mr Hoon </p>
<p>to use in his meetings.</p>
<p>347</p>
<p> The final key message was:</p>
<p>“Level playing field: Big contracts to rebuild Iraq. Putting UK lives on line.  </p>
<p>Expect level playing field for UK business in oil and other areas.” </p>
<p><b>599. </b> The British Embassy in Washington’s record of Mr Hoon’s meetings with Secretary </p>
<p>Rumsfeld and Dr Rice on 12 February did not include any reference to a discussion on </p>
<p>commercial issues.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>600. </b> Mr Henderson advised an FCO official on 25 February that the “general point” </p>
<p>that UK companies should be in a position to access opportunities arising from </p>
<p>reconstruction and rehabilitation in Iraq had been raised at an (unspecified) high level </p>
<p>with the US Government.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> The UK had been assured that a level playing field would </p>
<p>apply. Mr Henderson commented: “however, the reality is that US companies will be in </p>
<p>a privileged position”. </p>
<p><b>601. </b> Mr Henderson sought Baroness Symons’ agreement on 27 February that officials </p>
<p>should adopt a “more open, pro-active approach” in their dealings with UK companies.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Interest from UK companies was growing, and the UK Government needed to be seen </p>
<p>to respond. </p>

<p>Hewitt, Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Minister for Women and Equality.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In a covering letter, Baroness Symons reported that more and more companies were </p>

<p>352</p>
<p> The US needed more resources in ORHA </p>
<p>and Mr Chilcott believed that ORHA would welcome someone who could make a </p>

<p><b>609. </b> Mr Brenton also reported that it was not clear how that USAID contract related to a </p>
<p>separate contract “allegedly being let by the US Army Corps of Engineers” and reported </p>
<p>in the UK press on 9 March.</p>
<p><b>610. </b> On 11 March, “with the agreement of Ministers”, Mr David Warren, TPUK </p>
<p>Director International Group, hosted a meeting with representatives of a number of </p>
<p>UK companies to discuss possible post-conflict reconstruction opportunities in Iraq.</p>
<p>356</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He reported to Baroness Symons the following day that it had been a useful opportunity </p>
<p>to emphasise that UK policy was to secure Iraq’s disarmament. The group’s main </p>
<p>concern had been that the US was moving ahead quickly on reconstruction and UK </p>
<p>companies would be frozen out. </p>
<p><b>611. </b> At Prime Minister’s Questions on 12 March, Dr Vincent Cable asked whether </p>
<p>Mr Blair was aware that the US Government had “pointedly excluded British and foreign </p>
<p>firms” from bidding for US contracts.</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> Mr Blair rejected Dr Cable’s charge that Mr Bush </p>
<p>regarded international co-operation with contempt.</p>
<p><b>612. </b> Mr Mike O’Brien, FCO Minister of State, visited Washington on 13 March, to </p>
<p>discuss post-conflict issues with US interlocutors.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>613. </b> A senior official from the US National Security Council (NSC) briefed Mr O’Brien </p>
<p>on US plans for the oil sector.</p>
<p>359</p>
<p> In that context, Mr O’Brien emphasised the importance </p>
<p>that the UK Government attached to UK companies having “a fair crack of the whip” in </p>
<p>competing for contracts. He accepted that it was reasonable for US companies to be </p>
<p>the recipients of US money for emergency contracts, but the field should be opened up </p>
<p>“once Iraqi money came on stream”. The NSC official agreed, and said that it would not </p>
<p>be US policy to restrict oil sector contracts to US companies. </p>
<p><b>614. </b> Mr O’Brien also called on Mr Andrew Natsios, USAID Administrator.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p> Mr Natsios </p>
<p>advised that, for security reasons, USAID had invited only a few US companies </p>
<p>with the necessary clearances to bid for the 17 primary reconstruction contracts. </p>
<p>There were no such constraints on subcontracts, and he hoped that UK companies and </p>
<p>non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with the right expertise would be successful in </p>
<p>securing those contracts. </p>
<p><b>615. </b> In response to a question from Mr O’Brien, Mr Natsios said that it would be </p>
<p>possible for UK companies to acquire the necessary security clearances to bid for </p>

<p>companies. </p>

<p>365</p>
<p> Mr Natsios had told both Mr O’Brien and Ms Hewitt that UK </p>
<p>companies would have the opportunity to bid for subcontracts, that USAID would </p>
<p>sponsor UK companies to secure the necessary security clearances, and that UK bids </p>
<p>for subcontracts would be welcomed. UK companies could not bid for primary contracts. </p>
<p><b>622. </b> Mr Phillipson reported that he had followed up those discussions with a meeting </p>
<p>with a USAID official, who:</p>
<p>“… reiterated the assurances that … Natsios had given that the UK will get a bite </p>
<p>at the cherry when the subcontracts came up. The US prime [contractor] would be </p>
<p>instructed to this effect and [the USAID official] could not be more blunt than to say </p>
<p>that ‘the fix is in’.” </p>
<p><b>623. </b> ORHA would undertake the detailed assessments of the subcontracts; it had also </p>
<p>been told of the need to include the UK in the process. </p>
<p><b>624. </b> Mr Phillipson advised that the next step was to translate that “political assurance” </p>
<p>into practice. The “Buy America” provisions and the inclusion of a list of US standards </p>

<p>“Our main objective has been to create a favourable political atmosphere in which </p>
<p>UK companies can position themselves to bid for subcontract work from these initial </p>
<p>US-funded projects. </p>
<p>“However, we understand that as yet only 180 of the 3,500 companies which </p>
<p>have registered with Bechtel as potential subcontractors … are British. A share in </p>
<p>the commercial effort proportionate to our contributions to the military campaign </p>
<p>will require a higher level of commitment on the part of UK firms if they are not to </p>
<p>be squeezed out by international competition. We could also try to secure firmer </p>
<p>political guarantees from the US, and aim for a more co-ordinated HMG approach </p>
<p>(e.g. involving ECGD, DFID and MOD …). </p>
<p>“The feedback on the action we have taken so far from UK business and </p>
<p>organisations such as the BCCB and the CBI has been positive. We have created </p>
<p>the conditions in which UK companies can pursue business in a favourable climate, </p>

<p> TPUK would consider the possibility of seconding individuals from </p>
<p>UK companies to ORHA. </p>
<p><b>645. </b> The UK Deputy reported her first impressions of ORHA(South) to Mr Chilcott </p>
<p>on 1 June (see Section 10.1).</p>
<p>381</p>
<p> She advised that Denmark was keen to capitalise </p>
<p>commercially from its leading role in the South (although Ambassador Olsen was at </p>
<p>pains to distance himself from that effort). Many of the Danish staff in ORHA(South) </p>
<p>were sponsored by private companies. Although they had agreed not to pursue </p>
<p>commercial opportunities while working in ORHA, they were focusing their attention </p>
<p>and expertise in areas which might offer commercial opportunities. She concluded that </p>
<p>“the Danish model is an excellent one and something we should copy”. It provided </p>
<p>ORHA with the managers it needed, stimulated the local commercial sector, and could </p>
<p>help UK business.</p>
<p><b>646. </b> The UK Deputy reported that she had re-tasked a UK secondee to ORHA(South) </p>
<p>to “take on the trade portfolio including, more surreptitiously, a watching UK trade brief”. </p>
<p><b>647. </b> Mr Blair visited Basra and Umm Qasr on 29 May. The visit prompted Mr Blair to </p>
<p>direct Whitehall to go back to a “war footing” to avoid “losing the peace in Iraq”  </p>
<p>(see Section 10.1). </p>
<p><b>648. </b> On his return from Iraq, Mr Blair sent a personal Note to President Bush containing </p>
<p>specific suggestions on how to accelerate progress in delivering visible improvements </p>
<p>in Iraq, including: “Bechtel needs to move far more quickly in letting contracts for </p>
<p>infrastructure reconstruction – patching up won’t do.”</p>
<p>382</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>649. </b> Mr Blair chaired a meeting on Iraq on 3 June attended by Mr Hoon, Baroness </p>
<p>Amos (the International Development Secretary), Sir Michael Jay (FCO Permanent </p>
<p>Under Secretary) and No.10 officials.</p>
<p>383</p>
<p> Mr Blair said he had returned from Iraq </p>
<p>convinced that “an enormous amount needed to be done”, including that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) and US decision-making processes were </p>
<p>too slow: contracts needed to be processed faster; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK companies needed to be energised to take up opportunities in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>650. </b> Following the meeting, a No.10 official commissioned a number of papers </p>
<p>for a further meeting to be chaired by Mr Blair on 6 June. Those included a list of </p>
<p>10-15 outstanding practical issues for Mr Blair to raise with President Bush that would </p>
<p>“make a big difference to the people of Iraq if they are resolved”. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>472</p>
<p><b>651. </b> That list was produced by the IPU on 5 June and sent to Mr Blair the same day </p>
<p>under a covering minute from Mr Straw.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> The IPU list identified as a priority: </p>
<p><b>“Baghdad needs an extra 400 MW of power capacity now. Siemens UK can put </b></p>
<p><b>in 170 MW in a few weeks – all they need is a letter of intent. </b>This seems to be </p>
<p>stuck in Washington.”</p>
<p><b>652. </b> Mr Straw highlighted that issue in his covering minute to Mr Blair, stating that </p>
<p>Ms Hewitt was keen for Mr Blair to lobby President Bush on behalf of Siemens </p>
<p>UK, whose bid had been stalled in Washington “by counter-lobbying from </p>
<p>GE [General Electric]”.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>653. </b> On the same day, Mr Straw sent a separate and personal letter to Mr Blair, asking </p>
<p>him to raise a number of points “very forcefully” with President Bush.</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> Those included: </p>
<p>“Contracts: As you know, the US are completely ruthless on favouring US </p>
<p>companies, and will not help UK companies unless you play hardball with Bush.” </p>
<p>Mr Straw offered as an example of this behaviour a Bechtel subcontract for electricity </p>
<p>systems. Siemens UK had almost secured that contract, when it had “gone cold”. </p>
<p><b>654. </b> Mr Blair held a further meeting on Iraq on 6 June, to agree the points to put </p>
<p>to President Bush.</p>
<p>387</p>
<p> The meeting agreed a number of key messages and actions, </p>
<p>including that Ms Hewitt should try to visit Iraq to promote the involvement of UK </p>
<p>business.</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush later that day.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> Mr Blair raised delays </p>
<p>in Bechtel’s operations, including unnecessary delays in agreeing a contract for </p>
<p>Siemens UK. The US was chasing Bechtel. </p>
<p><b>656. </b> Ms Hewitt visited Iraq on 9 July, to ensure that British business expertise was </p>
<p>not overlooked in the reconstruction effort and to ensure that Iraqi women were being </p>
<p>properly involved in the political process.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>657. </b> Ms Hewitt reported to Mr Blair on 11 July that she had raised with Ambassador </p>
<p>Paul Bremer, the Head of the CPA, the UK’s concern about the way proposals for </p>
<p>subcontract work from Siemens UK and Balfour Beatty were being handled by Bechtel. </p>
<p>Ambassador Bremer had undertaken to look into the issue. </p>
<p><b>658. </b> During the visit, Ms Hewitt was joined by an IIWG “scoping mission” for discussions </p>
<p>with senior Iraqi officials and US members of the CPA’s economics team. Ms Hewitt </p>

<p>expert into the CPA quickly (not least to ensure not all contracts go to US firms)”.</p>
<p><b>659. </b> TPUK seconded a procurement officer to the CPA in August: </p>
<p>“… to ensure that DFI [Development Fund for Iraq] and Iraqi Ministry procurement </p>

<p><b>661. </b> Representatives of Siemens’ Washington office met officials from the British </p>

<p>392</p>
<p> The Embassy reported to the DTI:</p>
<p>“Siemens report a favourable change in CPA attitudes to their participation in the </p>
<p>power sector, which they attribute to HMG teamwork on their behalf in London, </p>
<p>Baghdad and Washington. The crisis in Basra over fuel and electricity may also have </p>
<p>tipped the balance in their favour.” </p>
<p><b>662. </b> Mr Gregor Lusty, Head of the DTI’s Iraq Unit, commented to DTI colleagues on </p>
<p>that report:</p>
<p>“Siemens has turned out to be quite a success story after all. A good indication of </p>
<p>the level of political support which may be needed to unblock the US system, and </p>
<p>the level of determination to get business success in Iraq.”</p>
<p>393</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>474</p>
<p><b>666. </b> President Bush announced on 7 September that he had asked Congress for </p>
<p>a further US$20.3bn to support Iraq’s reconstruction.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>667. </b> Mr Lusty advised TPUK colleagues on 12 September that, following </p>
<p>President Bush’s announcement that the US would provide further funding for Iraq’s </p>
<p>reconstruction, establishing a TPUK office in Baghdad was:</p>
<p>“… not so much timely as a critical necessity. Without a dedicated commercial </p>
<p>presence on the ground we will continue to miss out on ensuring that the UK private </p>
<p>sector plays the role it is capable of to reconstruct Iraq.”</p>
<p>397</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Mr Lusty reported that the British Office in Baghdad had recently secured </p>
<p>additional space in the Green Zone in Baghdad, which could accommodate a </p>
<p>commercial office. The “concept” was that the commercial office would initially be staffed </p>
<p>by two members of TPUK staff and two consultants from AMEC plc in a “public/private </p>
<p>partnership”.</p>
<p><b>669. </b> TPUK deployed three Commercial Officers to Baghdad during September.</p>
<p>398</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>A secondee from AMEC, to provide advice on infrastructure, followed in November. </p>
<p><b>670. </b> The AMEC secondee deployed under the Short-Term Business Attachment </p>
<p>programme, which included a conflict of interests clause in the contract.</p>
<p>399</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Those were the first Commercial Officers to deploy to Iraq after the invasion.  </p>
<p>A June 2004 briefing advised that the FCO had reneged on a pre-invasion agreement </p>
<p>that there would be a Commercial Officer among the initial deployment of UK officials </p>
<p>to Baghdad.</p>

<p><b>672. </b> TPUK deployed a Commercial Officer to Kuwait to cover Basra and southern Iraq </p>
<p>in January 2004. </p>
<p><b>673. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 18 September meeting of the AHMGIR advised </p>
<p>Ministers that the US had decided to establish a Program Management Office (PMO) </p>
<p>to oversee CPA reconstruction funds.</p>
<p>401</p>
<p> The decision was a response to the persistent </p>
<p>problems in transferring funds from CPA(Baghdad) and CPA regional offices. However: </p>
<p>“Our initial response is sceptical: the PMO will manage predominantly US funds, </p>
<p>which will require US contracting and procurement procedures to be followed. </p>

<p>companies (in the interests of effectiveness and value for money) remains negligible. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, without participating in some form in the PMO, we may lose a point </p>

<p><b>674. </b> Mr Lusty provided advice to Mr O’Brien on 25 September on how TPUK would </p>
<p>ensure that procurement for Iraq’s reconstruction was transparent and created a </p>
<p>level playing field for UK companies.</p>
<p>402</p>
<p> Mr Lusty advised that, although the CPA’s </p>
<p>procurement rules were “generally fair”, UK business remained concerned about the </p>
<p>lack of transparency and that the dominance of US personnel in the CPA resulted in </p>
<p>a bias towards US contractors. </p>
<p><b>675. </b> Mr Lusty continued: </p>
<p>“It has been clear from our contacts with the Americans at all levels that there will </p>
<p>be no special favours for British business in bidding for reconstruction work in Iraq. </p>
<p>We have made it clear to UK firms that there is no inside track …</p>
<p>“To maximise UK business involvement in Iraq reconstruction, we must ensure a </p>
<p>level playing field for international businesses bidding for reconstruction work from </p>
<p>the CPA and from the US Government; and give British business a competitive </p>
<p>advantage through our [TPUK’s] own bilateral trade promotion efforts.” </p>
<p><b>676. </b> To achieve that, TPUK was: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Sending a … procurement expert back to the CPA asap.” The BTI official </p>
<p>seconded to ORHA/CPA in March (who had left at the end of June) had </p>
<p>focused on improving procurement by the Iraqi Ministries; President Bush’s </p>
<p>announcement of further, substantial funding for Iraq’s reconstruction and the </p>
<p>creation of the PMO had shifted the priority back to the CPA. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Identifying public and private sector secondees for the PMO, in response to </p>
<p>a request from Rear Admiral (retired) David Nash, the Director of the PMO.</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Mr Lusty recommended that Mr O’Brien press the US for greater transparency </p>
<p>in procurement by the CPA and the US Government (especially the Department of </p>
<p>Defense). </p>
<p><b>678. </b> The UK Government seconded two consultants to the PMO; the first arrived in </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>476</p>
<p><b>679. </b> TPUK sent Mr Blair an update on commercial issues in Iraq on 10 October.</p>
<p>403</p>
<p> </p>
<p>TPUK’s strategy was:</p>
<p>“… to position UK firms … through the provision of information about contracts, </p>
<p>procurement issues, etc, and to press the US authorities (and the CPA) to ensure </p>
<p>a level playing field on which UK companies can compete.”</p>
<p><b>680. </b> TPUK advised that the US had made it clear that while they welcomed the </p>
<p>participation of UK companies, there was no “special deal”. </p>
<p><b>681. </b> TPUK’s major concern was the lack of openness in the CPA’s tendering and </p>
<p>procurement procedures, which might result in a bias towards US companies.  </p>
<p>TPUK was lobbying on this issue in Baghdad and Washington, and had funded a </p>
<p>procurement consultant in the CPA Ministry of Finance “to make procurement more </p>
<p>transparent and ensure that UK firms were on the CPA’s bidding lists”. It would also </p>
<p>fund secondments to the PMO. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> The TPUK paper considered oil and gas contracts separately from other </p>
<p>reconstruction contracts; oil and gas contracts are addressed earlier in this Section. </p>
<p><b>683. </b> TPUK reported that UK firms were doing “quite well”, given that most of the work </p>
<p>so far had been US-funded. An analysis of Bechtel’s subcontracts showed that Iraqi </p>
<p>firms had won 36 percent, US firms 28 percent and UK firms 16 percent. UK firms had </p>
<p>also won major contracts in other areas. </p>
<p><b>684. </b> British Trade International was subsequently renamed UK Trade and Investment </p>
<p>(UKTI) and the Trade Partners UK (TPUK) identity fell out of use. </p>
<p><b>685. </b> Congress approved the CPA’s request for additional funds on 6 November, </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>687. </b> In December, Mr David Warren, Director of the UKTI’s International Trade Division, </p>
<p>provided a review of UKTI’s experience of promoting UK business for Mr Stephen </p>
<p>Haddrill, Director-General of the UKTI’s Fair Markets Group: </p>
<p>“It took time, initially, to persuade Ministers that this [promoting UK commercial </p>

<p>“The inter-departmental structures to handle reconstruction issues … allowed UK </p>
<p>Trade and Investment to register this interest. But the departments responsible </p>
<p>for overseeing this co-ordination made clear at an early stage that UK commercial </p>
<p>interests were a lower priority than other aspects of reconstruction. The result … </p>
<p>was that the contribution that the private sector could make to post-conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction was less well registered. This contrasts with the US use of the private </p>
<p>sector at the planning stage.”</p>
<p>406</p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Warren also advised that DFID’s concentration on international competitive </p>
<p>tendering and the ECGD’s “understandable” reluctance to offer cover had further </p>
<p>inhibited a “proactive and joined-up approach”. Co-operation with DFID at a working </p>
<p>level had been “reasonable”. </p>
<p><b>689. </b> The result had been that promoting UK companies was seen solely as the </p>
<p>responsibility of UKTI. </p>
<p><b>690. </b> Mr Warren concluded that the interests of the private sector had not been </p>
<p>a high enough priority for the Government, and that the potential contribution to </p>
<p>reconstruction that could have been made by private sector had not been recognised </p>
<p>by the Government. UKTI activities had nevertheless resulted in “a reasonable amount” </p>
<p>of business for UK companies. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> UK Government lobbying on behalf of UK business intensified in early 2004, </p>

<p><b>699. </b> The draft paper stated that UK companies had good access to most US-funded </p>
<p>contracts, but had achieved only limited success so far. US procurement rules were </p>
<p>complex; several UK companies had formed joint ventures with US companies to </p>
<p>overcome that barrier. The recent award of the US-funded oil contracts to US companies </p>
<p>(bids with significant UK components had not been successful, despite lobbying by </p>
<p>Ministers) suggested that the UK needed to take a “stronger and more active political </p>
<p>line” in Washington to lobby for UK commercial interests. </p>
<p><b>700. </b> The draft paper stated that while the British Embassy Washington conceded that </p>
<p>UK lobbying had not been successful, the Embassy was not convinced that the UK had </p>
<p>yet reached the stage where “high level political pressure” was appropriate. </p>
<p><b>701. </b> The draft paper concluded that, as a first step, the Government should take  </p>
<p>the line that UK companies had expertise and capacity in areas needed for Iraq’s </p>
<p>reconstruction, and that the Government wanted to see a significant UK component </p>
<p>in the PMO’s prime contracts. DTI and FCO Ministers should lead the UK’s lobbying.  </p>
<p>The UK should consider targeted lobbying visits by Ministers to Washington closer to </p>
<p>the announcement of the PMO contracts.</p>

<p>from the US Government. UK companies assessed that US procurement procedures </p>
<p>were “essentially fair” and were not critical of the UK Government’s support, but were </p>
<p>convinced that there was a window of opportunity to press the US. It was now vital that </p>
<p>UK Ministers ensured that their US interlocutors were “in no doubt about the political </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>480</p>
<p><b>712. </b> Mr Wilson and Mr O’Brien made separate visits to Washington on 18 to </p>
<p>20 February and 20 February respectively, to lobby the US on behalf of UK companies </p>
<p>bidding for the US-funded PMO contracts.</p>
<p>419</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>713. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald reported to Mr Blair on 21 February that Mr Wilson and </p>
<p>Mr O’Brien had “conspicuously failed to de-conflict their programmes and insisted on </p>
<p>seeing the same people”.</p>
<p>420</p>
<p> Sir Nigel continued: “To make things worse, Brian Wilson’s </p>
<p>visit seems to have been organised, at least in part, by a private American lobbying </p>
<p>organisation.” </p>
<p><b>714. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that Mr Blair responded to that report. </p>
<p><b>715. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on 23 February that Mr O’Brien and </p>
<p>Mr Wilson had stressed with all their interlocutors that the UK was not alleging any unfair </p>
<p>treatment of UK companies, but had pointed out that there would be “intense scrutiny” </p>
<p>of the PMO contract awards and it would be “very difficult for us [the UK], politically, if we </p>
<p>had no successes”.</p>
<p>421</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>716. </b> The Embassy reported that, in response, US officials “on the technical side” </p>
<p>(described by the Embassy as comprising the PMO, US Department of Defense, </p>
<p>and USACE) had stressed that PMO contracts would be awarded on merit, with no </p>
<p>scope for political interference. The “political response” (from the NSC, the CPA and </p>
<p>the Department of State) had been “more nuanced”, with a recognition of the political </p>
<p>problem that the process could cause the UK. </p>
<p><b>717. </b> The Embassy commented:</p>
<p>“The message from those on the technical side was not surprising, although given </p>
<p>the way the process has gone so far it is hard to take at face value their insistence </p>
<p>that they are immune to political pressure … The response from the political </p>
<p>contacts was as encouraging as we could hope for. They genuinely understand the </p>
<p>problems that this could cause us.”</p>
<p><b>718. </b> Mr Henderson, who had accompanied Mr Wilson and Mr O’Brien to Washington, </p>
<p>reported on the visits on the same day.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> Copies of his report were sent to officials in </p>
<p>UKTI, DTI, the FCO and No.10. The UK’s “core message” had been to demonstrate </p>

<p>the visits would make a difference: </p>
<p>“… my impression is that despite the insistence of the technocrats that the process </p>
<p>was not subject to political influence or interference, it will be more difficult now for </p>
<p>the collective US machinery involved to produce a result that did not give the UK </p>
<p>companies a significant share of the action.”</p>
<p><b>719. </b> Mr Henderson wrote to Sir Stephen Brown on 23 February, reporting that </p>
<p>Mr O’Brien was “deeply unhappy” that Mr Wilson’s programme had included a number </p>
<p>of political calls, which breached the guidelines (as Mr O’Brien understood them) that </p>
<p>Mr O’Brien should concentrate on official contacts and Mr Wilson on the private sector.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Copies of the minute were sent to UKTI officials only. </p>
<p><b>720. </b> Mr Henderson concluded:</p>
<p>“… it is clear that the arrangement is not working … We run the risk of spending </p>
<p>more time on this than on the core task of helping UK companies to win business.”</p>
<p><b>721. </b> Mr Henderson also reported that the British Embassy had been “furious” at the </p>
<p>activities of a public relations company contracted by AMEC, which had sought to </p>
<p>organise Mr Wilson’s visit.</p>
<p><b>722. </b> Sir David Manning, the British Ambassador in Washington, wrote to Sir Michael </p>
<p>Jay on 3 March, detailing the Embassy’s concerns.</p>
<p>424</p>
<p> He highlighted two issues, both </p>
<p>of which had caused significant problems for the Embassy:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the lack of clarity regarding the roles of Mr O’Brien and Mr Wilson, and the lack </p>
<p>of communication between their offices; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the relationship between Mr Wilson and AMEC, which appeared uncomfortably </p>
<p>close, with a significant risk of serious embarrassment to the UK.</p>
<p><b>723. </b> Sir David concluded that the roles of Mr Wilson and Mr O’Brien needed to be </p>
<p>clearly defined, and the potential for a conflict of interest arising from Mr Wilson’s links </p>
<p>to AMEC resolved. </p>

<p><b>725. </b> Mr Blair wrote to President Bush on 5 March, identifying some of the UK </p>
<p>companies bidding for PMO contracts and highlighting in general terms the expertise </p>
<p>of UK companies.</p>
<p>426</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>726. </b> The US Department of Defense awarded the major remaining IRRF2 contracts </p>
<p>during March, comprising seven project management contracts and 10 design and build </p>
<p>construction contracts.</p>
<p>427</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>727. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 18 March meeting of the AHMGIR stated that, </p>
<p>following a campaign of high-level lobbying, UK companies had “achieved success” in </p>
<p>the latest round of US reconstruction contracting.</p>
<p>428</p>
<p> Three of the project management </p>
<p>contracts, with a total value of up to US$80m, had been awarded to consortia with a </p>
<p>significant UK content, and two of the design and build construction contracts with a total </p>
<p>value of up to US$1.1bn had been awarded to consortia with a significant UK content.  </p>
<p>It was not possible at this stage to calculate the exact value to the UK of those contracts.</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Ministers were advised on 2 April that consortia with significant UK content had </p>
<p>secured three further design and build construction contracts.</p>
<p>429</p>
<p> The total value of the </p>
<p>contracts was capped at US$1.6bn. </p>
<p><b>729. </b> Following Admiral Nash’s request for UK help in staffing the PMO, UKTI contracted </p>
<p>two consultants to work in the PMO, initially for three months. The first deployed in early </p>
<p>March 2004, the second in early April.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>730. </b> A UKTI official told ISOG that:</p>

<p>FCO travel advice.</p>
<p>433</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>734. </b> Under its contract, Foster Wheeler had committed to deploy 34 staff to Baghdad </p>
<p>by 21 April.</p>
<p>434</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>735. </b> In response, the PMO warned Foster Wheeler that postponement could lead to the </p>
<p>termination of its contract.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>736. </b> Mr David Richmond, the Prime Minister’s Deputy Special Representative on </p>
<p>Iraq, reported on 18 April on the challenges of “designing and executing post-conflict </p>
<p>reconstruction in what effectively remains a conflict zone”.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> He advised that there was:</p>
<p>“Probably less activity on the ground than CPA are prepared to admit, as aid </p>
<p>agencies and contractors withdraw personnel to safer areas pending decisions to  </p>
<p>re-engage. Main foreign contractors operating at 50 – 75 percent staffing levels. </p>
<p>Some NGOs well below that.”</p>
<p><b>737. </b> Mr Richmond concluded that the UK needed to consider the advice it gave to UK </p>
<p>development partners and contractors, and the divergence between UK and US advice. </p>
<p>US contractors appeared to operate “as if their even stricter advice against coming to </p>
<p>Iraq does not exist”. The UK’s travel advice gave the Embassy “no option but to counsel </p>
<p>caution … and to reinforce with [UK contractors] the importance of ensuring robust </p>
<p>security arrangements”. Foster Wheeler encapsulated the dilemma: “risk coming out </p>
<p>or losing out.” Mr Richmond advised that the UK should maintain its current line. </p>
<p><b>738. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 22 April meeting of the AHMGIR advised that </p>
<p>security had deteriorated “markedly” over Easter (9 to 12 April) and that the risks to UK </p>
<p>civilian staff in Iraq were high.</p>
<p>437</p>
<p> The deployment of civilians had been reviewed and, </p>
<p>as a temporary measure, new deployments to Baghdad had been suspended and staff </p>
<p>unable to operate in the current security environment had been withdrawn. </p>
<p><b>739. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad informed UKTI on 3 May that, largely because of </p>
<p>deteriorating security, there were “next to no” UK business visitors in Baghdad requiring </p>

<p>the PMO.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> Mr Straw was taking “a much more bullish line, and wants Foster Wheeler </p>
<p>to deploy immediately”, but that would go beyond current UK travel advice and “play </p>
<p>badly if leaked to the press”. The official concluded that the final decision must rest with </p>
<p>Foster Wheeler. </p>
<p><b>741. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 6 May meeting of the AHMGIR advised that:</p>
<p>“If … the [Foster Wheeler] contract is terminated the impact may go beyond the </p>
<p>immediate loss of business and negatively affect the chances of other British </p>
<p>companies winning US contracts in Iraq.”</p>
<p>440</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>742. </b> At the meeting, Sir Stephen Brown reported that Mr O’Brien had spoken to Foster </p>
<p>Wheeler to emphasise the serious implications of its delayed deployment, including for </p>
<p>other UK companies.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>743. </b> Mr Lusty advised Mr O’Brien on 10 May that if talks between Foster Wheeler </p>
<p>and the PMO broke down and Foster Wheeler sought UK Government support for </p>
<p>its position, the Government should take the line that this was a contractual issue and </p>
<p>not get drawn into a wider discussion on travel advice or the safety of foreign contractors </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>744. </b> Mr Lusty advised that the FCO’s travel advice was clear. The decision on whether </p>
<p>to travel remained “a matter of personal or commercial judgement”. There was “no </p>
<p>agreed position” within the Government on reconciling FCO travel advice with the need </p>
<p>to pursue reconstruction. UKTI staff in Washington, Baghdad and the UK continued </p>
<p>to work with Foster Wheeler to help it address its security concerns. </p>
<p><b>745. </b> A UKTI official informed Mr O’Brien on 14 May that Foster Wheeler and the PMO </p>
<p>had reached an agreement on deploying staff to Iraq.</p>

<p><b>747. </b> Mr O’Brien spoke to Mr Ian Bill, Chairman and CEO of Foster Wheeler, on  </p>

<p>445</p>
<p> Mr Bill said that although Foster Wheeler had deployed staff to Iraq, it </p>
<p>remained concerned that security provided by the PMO was not adequate. One of its </p>

<p><b>748. </b> In a 7 June briefing, the UKTI advised that it had stopped “all proactive commercial </p>
<p>work” in Iraq, although it remained heavily involved in providing information to UK </p>
<p>companies and in helping them manage existing commitments.</p>
<p>446</p>
<p> UKTI planned to </p>
<p>maintain one UK Commercial Officer post in Baghdad, which it considered the “minimal </p>
<p>level for operational needs” (reduced from the three Commercial Officers deployed in </p>
<p>September 2003). </p>
<p><b>749. </b> Mr Lusty advised Sir Stephen Brown on 9 June that the IIWG had “run its </p>
<p>course”.</p>
<p>447</p>
<p> Private sector participation was poor. The IIWG had originally been conceived </p>
<p>as the core of an early UK trade mission to Iraq, but the security situation had made that </p>
<p>impossible. It had served instead as a useful forum for briefing industry. That function </p>
<p>had now been taken over by the six sector working groups. </p>
<p><b>750. </b> In early June, UKTI began to consider whether to continue to fund the two </p>
<p>consultants in the PMO.</p>
<p>448</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>751. </b> A UKTI official set out the arguments for Mr O’Brien on 21 June:</p>
<p>“We can claim indirect benefit to UK plc from these consultants, but it is difficult to </p>
<p>quantify any direct commercial benefit. PMO procurement still (rightly) has to go </p>
<p>through a full competitive process … But these consultancies have earned us a </p>
<p>great deal of goodwill from PMO senior management, ensured a UK voice at the </p>
<p>highest levels of the organisation, and [have been] a useful but unacknowledged </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>486</p>
<p>THE SUCCESS OF UK COMPANIES IN SECURING CONTRACTS IN IRAQ</p>
<p><b>756. </b> On 30 July, Mr Fergus Harradence, Head of the UKTI’s Gulf Unit, provided an </p>
<p>update for Mr O’Brien on UK commercial success in Iraq.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>757. </b> Mr Harradence advised that there were over 60 UK companies working in Iraq, </p>
<p>involved in contracts which UKTI estimated were worth a total of US$2.6bn.  </p>
<p>That figure did not represent the total value of work undertaken and goods supplied </p>
<p>by UK companies, but rather the total value of the contracts on which UK companies </p>
<p>worked as contractors or subcontractors.</p>
<p><b>758. </b> UK companies had been successful in winning contracts from all the major </p>
<p>contracting organisations (the US, the CPA and Iraqi Ministries, the UN and DFID), </p>
<p>although UK companies had been particularly successful in winning work as contractors </p>
<p>or subcontractors to US Government agencies. </p>
<p><b>759. </b> UKTI believed that it had played a “leading role” in helping UK companies to </p>
<p>secure work on contracts worth approximately US$1.8bn (of which AMEC had secured </p>
<p>work on contracts worth US$1.6bn). </p>
<p><b>760. </b> At BP’s request, on 30 August, during his introductory call on Mr Thamir Ghadban, </p>
<p>the Iraqi Minister of Oil, Mr Chaplin raised BP’s bid for a contract relating to the Rumalia </p>
<p>oilfield.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> Mr Ghadban responded that the contract would be awarded on technical </p>
<p>and commercial criteria, and commented that BP appeared more cautious than other </p>
<p>companies in turning expressions of interest into “real engagement”. Mr Chaplin </p>
<p>commented: </p>
<p>“This is not the first time we have heard criticism of excessive caution from BP </p>
<p>(and to a lesser extent Shell). Rightly or wrongly, the perception amongst the Iraqi </p>
<p>oil establishment is that they are less committed than many of their international </p>
<p>competitors.”</p>
<p><b>761. </b> Sir Stephen Brown met senior UKTI officials on 5 November 2004 to discuss </p>
<p>UKTI’s future engagement on Iraq, on the basis of a paper produced by UKTI’s Iraq </p>
<p>Unit.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>762. </b> The paper stated that private sector interest in Iraq had started at a “feverish </p>
<p>level”, but had declined after April 2004 when contractors started to be targeted by </p>
<p>insurgents, and had now levelled off. Over 1,300 business people had attended UKTI </p>
<p>events in London since August 2003 and over 200 had attended UKTI-supported events </p>
<p>in the region. UKTI had organised trade missions from Iraq to the UK focusing on </p>
<p>financial services, health, education, oil and gas, and power and water. </p>

<p>10.3  |  Reconstruction: oil, commercial interests, debt relief, asylum and stabilisation policy </p>
<p>487</p>
<p><b>763. </b> The paper stated that staffing in London had been reduced as the number of </p>
<p>enquiries from companies had declined, and staffing overseas would be kept under </p>
<p>constant review; UKTI needed to retain the flexibility to move quickly to support UK </p>
<p>companies as security improved. </p>
<p><b>764. </b> The slowdown in reconstruction in Iraq had severely hampered UKTI’s ability </p>
<p>“to play a useful role in the Whitehall process, and reduced our need to be involved”. </p>
<p><b>765. </b> The paper concluded:</p>
<p>“UK business is now a strong player in post-conflict Iraq. We have met high </p>
<p>Ministerial and business expectations and avoided a US dominance …”</p>
<p><b>766. </b> Sir Stephen agreed the paper.</p>
<p>455</p>
<p><b>Responding to renewed commercial interest in Iraq, 2008</b></p>
<p><b>767. </b> The UK Commercial Officer post in Basra was cut in 2006 because of the security </p>
<p>situation and UKTI’s desire to free up resources for emerging markets.</p>
<p>456</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>768. </b> The remaining UK Commercial Officer post in Baghdad was cut in July 2007.</p>
<p>457</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>A UKTI official commented: </p>
<p>“UKTI has retained a UK-based presence in Baghdad (and previously Basra) until </p>
<p>now because of the political imperatives of doing so rather than on the basis of the </p>
<p>normal criteria relating to business demand … The on-going security situation raises </p>
<p>serious questions about whether retaining the UK-based … slot can be justified.  </p>
<p>The resource is also very expensive – some £560,000 in cash terms … which could </p>
<p>be deployed more productively in other markets.”</p>
<p><b>769. </b> From July 2007, the UK Commercial Section in the British Embassy Baghdad </p>
<p>comprised one junior Iraqi Commercial Officer supported by a UKTI officer based in </p>
<p>Amman, Jordan.</p>
<p>458</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>770. </b> Mr Gordon Brown succeeded Mr Tony Blair as Prime Minister in June 2007. </p>
<p>Section 10.2 describes the development and implementation from July 2007 of </p>
<p>Mr Brown’s economic initiatives for Iraq, which included measures to facilitate private </p>
<p>sector investment in Basra and across Iraq. </p>
<p><b>771. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported to UKTI in September 2007 that the new </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>488</p>
<p>opportunities were being missed. The Embassy recommended that UKTI recruit a senior </p>
<p>Iraqi Commercial Officer to head the commercial team in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>772. </b> Mr Douglas Alexander, the International Development Secretary, announced </p>
<p>the appointment of Mr Michael Wareing as joint Chair of the Basra Development </p>
<p>Commission (BDC) in December.</p>
<p>460</p>
<p> Mr Alexander described the BDC, which aimed </p>
<p>to bring national, regional and international business knowledge together to provide </p>
<p>strategic advice to the Iraqi authorities on investment and growth, as the “centrepiece” </p>
<p>of Mr Brown’s economic initiatives.</p>
<p>461</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>773. </b> Mr Wareing told the Inquiry that he had three roles:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to champion economic development, particularly in Basra and the South; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to champion international investment into Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to help set up and to chair the BDC.</p>
<p>462</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>774. </b> Mr Wareing said that his role was not specifically to promote investment from </p>
<p>the UK:</p>
<p>“… the line that I pursued was … to try to push investment, not just from a British or </p>
<p>indeed a European or even a Western … point of view, but basically any investment </p>
<p>– and there was a significant amount of investment from the Gulf region.”</p>
<p>463 </p>
<p><b>775. </b> Mr Des Browne, the Defence Secretary, visited Iraq with Mr Wareing in mid-</p>
<p>March.</p>
<p>464</p>
<p> Mr Browne reported to Mr Brown that: “The overall mood in Iraq is optimistic, </p>
<p>reflecting the improved security situation, political progress and the new focus on </p>
<p>economic regeneration to which Michael [Wareing] is contributing.” Mr Browne’s </p>
<p>discussions with Iraqi Government Ministers had suggested several areas where the </p>
<p>UK could do more, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reinforcing the UK team in Basra and Baghdad to support Mr Wareing’s work; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>redoubling the UK effort to unblock the investment and hydrocarbon legislation, </p>
<p>and to encourage international business to invest in Basra.</p>

<p><b>777. </b> The Cabinet Office subsequently advised Mr Brown that between 25 and </p>
<p>30 companies had expressed a serious interest in exploring investment opportunities </p>
<p>in Iraq.</p>
<p>466</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>778. </b> Mr Nick McInnes, Director of UKTI’s International Group, briefed UKTI colleagues </p>
<p>on 3 May 2008 on the growing pressure from the British Embassy Baghdad and the </p>
<p>MOD for a larger UKTI presence in Baghdad.</p>
<p>467</p>
<p> Their arguments for that were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the increased interest in Iraq from UK companies; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the likelihood that Mr Brown’s economic initiatives would stimulate further </p>
<p>interest; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of sales of UK military equipment to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>779. </b> DFID advised members of the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) on 8 May that several </p>
<p>companies that had attended the reception had expressed an interest in visiting Iraq.</p>
<p>468</p>
<p> </p>
<p>DFID was working with MOD to arrange this. DFID cautioned that there was still work </p>
<p>to be done to secure the correct conditions for inwards investment, and such investment </p>
<p>was unlikely to start flowing in the immediate future.</p>
<p><b>780. </b> UKTI and DFID officials met on 21 May, at DFID’s request, to discuss UKTI’s </p>
<p>interests in Iraq.</p>
<p>469</p>
<p> Mr Paul Taylor, Head of the UKTI’s Middle East Department, reported </p>
<p>to Mr Andrew Cahn, UKTI Chief Executive, that DFID had said it would be difficult for </p>
<p>DFID to handle the “investment visits” which had emerged from Mr Brown’s 28 April </p>
<p>reception. DFID did not have the appropriate expertise and, more importantly, under the </p>
<p>International Development Act, it could not favour UK companies by providing them with </p>
<p>such support. DFID officials had asked UKTI to reinstate a UK Commercial Officer post </p>
<p>in Baghdad. Mr Taylor had said that UKTI was highly unlikely to be able to find funding </p>
<p>for such a post. </p>
<p><b>781. </b> Mr Taylor reported to Mr Cahn on 2 July that a DFID proposal to fund a UK </p>
<p>Commercial Officer post in Baghdad from the Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF) had not </p>
<p>proved viable.</p>
<p>470</p>
<p> The pressure remained on UKTI to increase its presence in Baghdad. </p>
<p><b>782. </b> In response, Mr Cahn stated his strong opposition to reinstating a UK-based </p>
<p>Commercial Officer post in Baghdad.</p>
<p>471</p>

<p>At the meeting, it was agreed that Mr Cahn and Mr Wareing should discuss the </p>
<p>issue further. </p>
<p><b>784. </b> The following week, Mr Frank Baker, Head of the FCO’s Iraq Group, wrote to </p>
<p>Mr McInnes: </p>
<p>“The [11 September ISG] meeting concluded that we needed an official in Baghdad </p>
<p>to identify investment opportunities in Basra, as well as help UK businesses work </p>
<p>with the Government of Iraq, otherwise we risk falling behind our international </p>
<p>competitors.”</p>
<p>473</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>785. </b> Mr Baker stated that, given the “exceptional circumstances” and the high priority </p>
<p>that the UK Government attached to having a trade representative in Baghdad, that post </p>
<p>could be funded from the SAF until the end of the UK financial year (31 March 2009). </p>
<p><b>786. </b> Mr Cahn met Mr Wareing on 1 October.</p>
<p>474</p>
<p> Mr Wareing said that the UK needed to </p>
<p>exploit its excellent high-level relationships in Iraq. The UK had invested heavily in Iraq, </p>
<p>and it would be a major disappointment if other countries went on to enjoy the fruits of </p>
<p>stabilisation and economic development. UKTI needed to be “at the table”. Mr Cahn </p>
<p>proposed that UKTI should recruit an international business specialist for a period of </p>
<p>six months, to scope the market and produce recommendations for UKTI on the way </p>
<p>forward. </p>
<p><b>787. </b> Mr Alexander wrote to Mr Brown on 20 November to provide an update on </p>
<p>progress in Basra.</p>
<p>475</p>
<p> He reported that DFID had already facilitated 18 investor visits by </p>
<p>14 companies, with proposals worth over US$9bn submitted to the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>788. </b> Mr Brown met Prime Minister Maliki in Iraq on 17 December.</p>
<p>476</p>
<p> Prime Minister </p>
<p>Maliki called for a wider long-term relationship, including investment and economic  </p>
<p>co-operation and stronger cultural and educational links. </p>
<p><b>789. </b> Mr Brown’s Assistant Private Secretary wrote to the Principal Private Secretary </p>
<p>to Lord Mandelson, the Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Secretary, </p>
<p>the following day to advise that Mr Brown believed there were opportunities in Iraq </p>
<p>and interest from British companies that were not being exploited.</p>
<p>477</p>
<p> Mr Brown was </p>
<p>convinced that there was an urgent need for a significant UKTI presence in both </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra, both to consolidate security gains and to ensure that UK investors </p>
<p>had every chance to benefit from commercial opportunities in Iraq. Mr Brown asked </p>

<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting UK companies pursuing business in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>793. </b> The steering brief also advised: </p>
<p>“Interest [in the visit] in Iraq has been surprisingly high – perhaps underlining that </p>

<p>“Iraqis trust British companies and products. But Iraqi politicians feel that [the] UK </p>

<p>a paper on the global, regional and local (Iraqi) economic impact of “war” in Iraq on  </p>
<p>6 September 2002. The paper identified the urgency of dealing with Iraq’s “huge” </p>

<p>way to address it. The Russians might be a major stumbling block, given the size </p>

<p><b>800. </b> The FCO Directorate of Strategy and Innovation (DSI) one-page paper ‘Vision </p>
<p>for Iraq and the Iraqi People’, which was submitted to the Ad Hoc Group on Iraq on </p>
<p>11 October, listed actions that the UK/Coalition would take to help the Iraqi people, </p>
<p>including “encouraging generous debt rescheduling”.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>801. </b> In advance of the first round of US/UK/Australia talks on post-conflict issues </p>
<p>on 6 November 2002, the Cabinet Office produced a paper synthesising work being </p>
<p>undertaken by departments.</p>
<p>486</p>
<p> That paper identified the need for debt rescheduling </p>
<p>to reconcile Iraq’s “huge external debts with reconstruction and development needs”. </p>
<p><b>802. </b> During the talks, the US agreed that Iraq would require debt rescheduling.</p>
<p>487</p>
<p><b>803. </b> On 11 February 2003, a Treasury official invited Mr Brown’s comments on officials’ </p>
<p>“first thoughts” on Treasury policies in a post-Saddam Iraq.</p>
<p>488</p>
<p> The official identified the </p>
<p>Treasury’s “two main Finance Ministry interests” in Iraq as ensuring its prosperity and </p>
<p>stability, while fairly sharing the costs of achieving this. An “emerging policy position” </p>
<p>would include: </p>
<p>“… push for debt rescheduling, to ensure that Iraqi contributions [to its </p>
<p>reconstruction] are not knocked off course by having to resume crippling debt </p>
<p>service. The cost of this would conveniently fall to probable non-combatant </p>
<p>countries.”</p>
<p><b>804. </b> The official advised that although it was difficult to gauge the size of Iraq’s debt, the </p>
<p>US State Department estimated that, as at 2002, Iraq owed around US$82bn to external </p>
<p>creditors. The State Department estimated that the four largest creditors were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Russia (US$16.1bn, or some 20 percent of the total external debt); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>France (US$9.1bn, 11 percent);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Japan (US$9.1bn, 11 percent); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Germany (US$6.7bn, 8 percent). </p>
<p>The State Department estimated that the US was the sixth largest creditor (US$4.4bn,  </p>
<p>5 percent) and the UK the tenth largest creditor (US$2.4bn, 3 percent). </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>494</p>
<p><b>806. </b> The official expanded upon the rationale for debt rescheduling:</p>
<p>“In post-war Iraq, the UK would be entitled to pursue repayment of US$1 – </p>
<p>US$2 billion bilateral debts … However, if all creditors did the same and were </p>
<p>successful, Iraq’s ability to fund its own reconstruction would be severely </p>
<p>compromised. This would lead to a fiscal financing gap for Iraq, probably filled </p>
<p>largely by bilateral financing. In such a situation, the UK might be under pressure </p>
<p>to make a big contribution … The other advantage to rescheduling is that we </p>
<p>suspect that most of the debt is owed to probable non-combatant countries </p>
<p>(e.g. France, Russia), with debt relief thus providing a neat way of burden sharing. </p>
<p>The other strong argument for debt relief is that, without it, multilateral lending is </p>
<p>likely to prove very difficult.”</p>
<p><b>807. </b> The Treasury told the Inquiry that Mr Brown did not comment on the submission.</p>
<p>489</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>808. </b> Mr John Dodds, Head of the Treasury’s Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence </p>

<p><b>809. </b> On 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post-conflict issues with Mr Brown </p>
<p>and other Ministers (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p>491</p>
<p> At the meeting, Mr Brown said that the burden </p>
<p>of reconstructing Iraq should not be borne by just the US and the UK; other countries </p>
<p>(and the EU) should contribute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the long term, Iraq’s oil should fund the country’s </p>
<p>reconstruction. Mr Brown was particularly concerned that UK funds should not be used </p>
<p>to repay Iraq’s debts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>810. </b> Mr Blair concluded that Mr Brown should draw up “a funding plan, including </p>
<p>securing funding from wider international sources, in particular the IFIs [international </p>
<p>financial institutions]”. </p>
<p><b>811. </b> The FCO sent a number of background papers to No.10 in advance of the  </p>

<p> The revised version of the ‘Vision’ reflected a number of changes </p>

<p> There were also a number of encouraging </p>

<p><b>820. </b> The official advised that the UK estimated that Iraq had debts of at least </p>
<p>US$108bn, over 700 percent of GDP or 900 percent of exports.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That level of debt was </p>
<p>unsustainable, especially when it was combined with Iraq’s commitment to meet at least </p>
<p>US$85bn in compensation claims from the Kuwait war. Preliminary Treasury analysis </p>
<p>was that a reduction of almost 80 percent in the net present value of Iraq’s external debt </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>833. </b> The briefing described that public expenditure issue:</p>
<p>“Provided debt reduction can be justified on financial grounds, the cost of writing </p>
<p>off commercial debts does not score as departmental expenditure but is borne by </p>
<p>ECGD and the Treasury. In practice, the most effective way of demonstrating a good </p>
<p>financial case is to use the Paris Club process. In contrast, if the UK were to write </p>
<p>off debts on policy grounds … the cost would score as departmental expenditure </p>
<p>and would need to be financed by DFID or another spending department.”</p>
<p><b>834. </b> The Treasury briefing identified a fourth interest: to use UK support for debt relief </p>
<p>for Iraq to press the US to commit to more generous treatment of HIPCs. That treatment </p>
<p>should include extending the HIPC Initiative and providing additional relief if HIPCs </p>
<p>experienced external shocks. The briefing observed that the cost of debt relief for Iraq </p>
<p>was likely to exceed the cost of the debt relief for all 38 of the countries which had </p>
<p>benefited from the HIPC Initiative. </p>
<p><b>835. </b> The briefing stated that the US might be intending to cancel 100 percent of </p>
<p>Iraqi debt owed to it, and might press the UK to do the same. Assuming a Paris Club </p>
<p>agreement to write-off 80 percent of Iraq’s debt, such an additional write-off would cost </p>
<p>the UK £230m. As that additional write off would be on policy (rather than financial) </p>
<p>grounds, the cost would fall to DFID, which would almost certainly make a claim on </p>
<p>the Reserve. The Treasury advised that while a 100 percent write-off could have </p>
<p>presentational benefits, it might not represent the best use of the resources available </p>
<p>to Iraq and that other debtor countries, including some that had large debts to the UK, </p>
<p>might demand similar generosity. </p>
<p><b>836. </b> Just before Mr Blair and Mr Baker’s conversation, Mr Baker’s office sent No.10 an </p>
<p>outline proposal to extend the HIPC Initiative for up to three years and to accelerate the </p>
<p>provision of debt reduction under HIPC programmes.</p>
<p>508</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>837. </b> During the phone call on 18 May, Mr Baker said that the US agreed with the UK’s </p>
<p>proposal that debt reduction for Iraq should be accompanied by an extension of the </p>
<p>HIPC Initiative.</p>
<p>509</p>
<p> He told Mr Blair that President Bush was prepared to support the </p>
<p>HIPC Initiative only if there was a “parallel agreement” on Iraq. Referring to the outline </p>
<p>proposal that his office had sent to No.10, Mr Baker said that it would not fly if it was </p>
<p>seen as a US initiative, but might if it was seen as a UK and French initiative to secure </p>
<p>concessions from the US on the HIPC Initiative in return for deep debt reduction for Iraq.</p>

<p><b>840. </b> A Treasury official briefed Mr Brown on the DSA two days later.</p>

<p> He estimated </p>
<p>that, on the basis of the DSA assessment, Iraq required debt reduction of at least  </p>
<p>80 percent and preferably 90 to 95 percent; the higher figures would deliver a robust exit </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>500</p>
<p>The UK’s position remained that Iraq required debt reduction of at least 80 percent </p>
<p>to deliver debt sustainability. The US and the Iraqi Government sought 95 percent, </p>
<p>which the UK assessed would leave Iraq in a “very strong” financial position. The UK’s </p>
<p>negotiating line, including in a bilateral meeting with the French on 1 September 2004, </p>
<p>was to support the US position “while hinting flexibility”. </p>
<p><b>846. </b> The IMF Board approved a US$436m Emergency Post-Conflict Assistance </p>
<p>programme for Iraq on 29 September.</p>
<p>518</p>
<p> The UK Delegation to the IMF reported that </p>
<p>unanimous approval had followed “tetchy” discussions, with a number of Executive </p>
<p>Directors expressing unease at the speed of approval (the timetable had been driven by </p>
<p>US demands and the IMF had cut back substantially on formal review processes) and </p>
<p>whether the Iraqi Government would be able to implement the necessary policy reforms </p>
<p>if the security situation did not improve. The IMF had commented that agreement paved </p>
<p>the way for discussions on debt relief. </p>
<p><b>847. </b> In early November, at the request of the Paris Club and in anticipation of an </p>
<p>agreement on debt relief for Iraq later that month, the IMF revisited its DSA for Iraq.</p>
<p>519</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Treasury officials briefed Mr Brown that, on the basis of the new figures, debt reduction </p>
<p>of between 75 and 85 percent was required to restore sustainability; debt reduction </p>
<p>above 85 percent could not be justified financially. Officials also told Mr Brown that </p>
<p>the US had now circulated a draft proposal seeking debt reduction of 89.5 percent in </p>
<p>three phases, with a generous repayment profile. The UK supported that proposal as </p>
<p>a negotiating position, but doubted that it could be agreed with Paris Club members. </p>
<p><b>848. </b> A Treasury official warned Mr Brown on 12 November that the US had decided </p>
<p>to offer Iraq additional debt relief following a Paris Club deal, writing off 100 percent </p>
<p>of Iraq’s debt.</p>
<p>520</p>
<p> If the UK did the same it would cost between £172m and £344m, </p>
<p>depending on the deal agreed at the Paris Club. Echoing the arguments offered in </p>
<p>May 2004, the official advised that, while there were “political arguments” in favour of </p>
<p>offering additional debt relief, there were also arguments against it:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Significantly poorer countries had not received 100 percent debt relief.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Iraq had no track record of using savings generated by debt relief for poverty </p>
<p>reduction. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Providing 100 percent debt relief would set a precedent for the UK’s treatment </p>
<p>of other countries.</p>
<p><b>849. </b> The official recommended that the UK should not offer additional debt relief to Iraq.</p>

<p><b>852. </b> The UK’s share of that write-off was approximately US$1.39bn,</p>

<p><b>861. </b> Establishing a programme to enable the return of Iraqi asylum seekers currently in </p>
<p>the UK to Iraq was an early priority for the UK Government. </p>
<p><b>862. </b> On 8 April 2003, as major combat operations in Iraq continued, Mr David Blunkett, </p>
<p>the Home Secretary, wrote to Mr Blair:</p>
<p>“As the conflict in Iraq moves towards a successful conclusion, we need to look at </p>
<p>the consequences for the tens of thousands of Iraqi asylum seekers currently in the </p>
<p>United Kingdom.</p>
<p>“Once peace and stability have returned to Iraq I believe it is right to press ahead </p>
<p>with a substantial returns programme … The new Iraq needs the skills of its exiles </p>
<p>to help in reconstruction. And with the threat from Saddam’s regime removed </p>
<p>there is no justification for failed Iraqi asylum seekers and new arrivals to remain </p>
<p>in the UK.”</p>
<p>539</p>
<p><b>863. </b> No.10 replied on 10 April, confirming that Mr Blair had asked departments to work </p>
<p>towards “forced returns … in the course of the next three months”.</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>864. </b> The International Organization for Migration (IOM) facilitated a small number of </p>
<p>voluntary returns from the UK to Iraq, beginning in June 2003.</p>
<p>541 </p>
<p><b>865. </b> The Home Office reported in October 2003 that 50 Iraqis had so far returned </p>
<p>on that basis.</p>
<p>542</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>866. </b> In October 2003, the UK sought the CPA’s agreement to expand its voluntary </p>
<p>returns programme and to introduce an enforced returns programme, to the Kurdish </p>
<p>Autonomous Zone (KAZ) only, for those who had no legal right to remain in the UK.</p>

<p>Ambassador Paul Bremer, the Head of the CPA, had decided in July not to encourage </p>
<p>returnees until Iraq’s infrastructure could deal with them. The CPA argued that while the </p>
<p>KAZ was a more stable and better serviced area of Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>there were already more than 600,000 internally displaced people there;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>covered the lifetime of the CPA only. An IPU official commented that Ambassador </p>
<p>Bremer had not agreed to accept enforced returns from any other Western country, </p>
<p>including the US.</p>
<p><b>870. </b> Later that month, Mr Blunkett announced that the UK intended to begin a pilot </p>
<p>programme of voluntary and enforced returns to Iraq.</p>

<p>550</p>
<p> Mr Blunkett </p>
<p>advised that Iraq consistently figured in the list of the “top ten asylum producing </p>
<p>countries”. Unless the UK established the principle of forced return by sending out a </p>
<p>flight of returnees before 30 June 2004 (the expected date of the transfer of power in </p>
<p>Iraq from the CPA to an Iraqi Interim Administration), the new Iraqi authorities might </p>
<p>insist that negotiations on enforced returns “recommence from the beginning”. </p>
<p><b>875. </b> Mr Straw replied on 7 June, acknowledging Mr Blunkett’s concern but stating </p>
<p>that making enforced returns before 1 July without consultation with the incoming </p>
<p>Interim Iraqi Government (IIG), its ministries and the KRG could undermine broader </p>
<p>UK diplomatic efforts and predispose the IIG to be unhelpful on returns in the future.</p>

<p><b>877. </b> The Iraqi Minister of Displacement and Migration visited the UK from 23 to 27 July, </p>

<p><b>879. </b> On 3 November, an IPU official provided an update for Mr Straw on enforced </p>
<p>returns.</p>
<p>555</p>
<p> A Home Office delegation had visited Iraq from 3 to 11 September and had </p>
<p>“eventually persuaded” KRG Ministers and officials to accept forced returns.  </p>
<p>The Minister of Displacement and Migration had not yet signed the MOU. The Home </p>
<p>Office believed that forced returns could go ahead without it as, under the Chicago </p>
<p>Convention, Iraq had an obligation to take back its nationals who did not qualify to </p>
<p>remain in the UK. The Home Office was therefore making plans to send the first 15 failed </p>
<p>asylum seekers back to northern Iraq on around 23 November. </p>
<p><b>880. </b> The IPU official advised that the FCO’s view was that no forced returns should take </p>
<p>place until the MOU was signed, for three reasons:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to ignore IIG views could generate “ill will” from the IIG and KRG, at a time when </p>
<p>the UK needed their support on a number of political priorities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the planned destinations for returnees might not be safe; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the presentational issue of enforced returns coinciding with military operations </p>
<p>in Fallujah, and with Ramadan. </p>
<p><b>881. </b> Mr Blunkett’s Private Secretary wrote to No.10 on 15 November, reporting that </p>
<p>the IIG accepted the principle of enforced return, but was unlikely to accept returnees </p>
<p>until the following year.</p>
<p>556</p>
<p> The Minister of Displacement and Migration had asked for an </p>
<p>improved package of assistance for returnees. Mr Blunkett’s Private Secretary restated </p>
<p>the FCO’s view that no enforced returns should take place without an MOU, and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>506</p>
<p><b>884. </b> The MOU was signed in January 2005 by the Ministry of Displacement and </p>
<p>Migration, on behalf of the IIG, and the Home Office.</p>
<p>559</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>885. </b> Notwithstanding the signature of the MOU, discussions continued between the </p>
<p>UK Government and the IIG on the implementation of an enforced return programme.</p>
<p>560</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The IIG’s concerns included the impact of returnees within the KRZ and the package of </p>
<p>assistance provided to returnees. </p>
<p><b>886. </b> Mr Tim Torlot, Deputy Head of Mission at the British Embassy Baghdad, called </p>
<p>on Prime Minister Ibrahim Ja’afari on 4 August. Mr Torlot reported to the FCO that </p>
<p>Prime Minister Ja’afari had agreed that Iraq should abide by the terms of the MOU, </p>
<p>and to instruct the Minister of Displacement and Migration to accept enforced returns. </p>
<p>Prime Minister Ja’afari hoped that the UK would consider substantially increasing the </p>
<p>assistance provided to returnees. </p>
<p><b>887. </b> The UK planned to operate the first flight carrying enforced returnees on  </p>
<p>28 August.</p>
<p>561</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>888. </b> Mr Charles Clarke, who had succeeded Mr Blunkett as Home Secretary, wrote </p>
<p>to Mr Blair on 25 August to confirm that he had postponed that flight, due to opposition </p>
<p>from the KRG and a concern that the RAF aircraft carrying the returnees would be a </p>
<p>target for insurgent activity.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>889. </b> President Jalal Talabani and Mr Blair met at 10 Downing Street on 6 October.</p>
<p>563</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Blair said that he attached great importance to early progress on the issue of </p>
<p>enforced returns, and said that it would be helpful if President Talabani took a personal </p>
<p>interest. </p>
<p><b>890. </b> Mr Straw was advised on 17 November that the KRG had, following Ministerial </p>
<p>pressure, finally agreed to accept enforced returnees.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>891. </b> The first flight of enforced returnees, comprising 15 failed asylum seekers, took </p>
<p>place on 20 November, landing in Erbil.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>892. </b> Mr Clarke reported to Mr Blair on 25 November that the UK had not received </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>508</p>
<p><b>903. </b> Other points made in discussion included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of using Territorial Army (TA) training and pre-deployment centres </p>
<p>for civilians involved in post-conflict work;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the critical importance of policing and security;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility of establishing contingency arrangements to make it easier to start </p>
<p>preparing earlier for post-conflict operations; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the importance of building capacity elsewhere, including in the UN and EU.</p>
<p><b>904. </b> The three Ministers agreed that officials should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>review the UK’s approach to planning and preparing for post-conflict situations at </p>
<p>the national level and then look at influencing others, with the EU a high priority;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>consider setting up an inter-departmental “co-ordinating mechanism”, look at the </p>
<p>tools needed and consider how to spread best practice; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>take into account the resource implications. </p>
<p><b>905. </b> On 28 November, Mr John Sawers, FCO Political Director, informed Sir Nigel </p>
<p>Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, that FCO, DFID and MOD officials were </p>
<p>preparing a paper for discussion by Ministers in January 2004.</p>
<p>571</p>
<p> Mr Sawers identified </p>
<p>three main issues to address:</p>
<p>“a. </p>
<p>how we improve the UK performance in this area;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>how we help improve the international effort – especially in the UN;</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>what our training and personnel management needs are.” </p>
<p><b>906. </b> A trilateral FCO/MOD/DFID working group agreed on 7 January 2004 to focus </p>
<p>on “the gap that has been identified in terms of planning for the initial implementation </p>
<p>post-conflict phase”.</p>
<p>572</p>
<p><b>907. </b> Officials presented a paper setting out recommendations for the “better planning, </p>

<p>to DOP on 12 February.</p>
<p>573</p>

<p><b>909. </b> Four options were proposed:</p>

<p>a small permanent unit of 15-18 people to inform strategy and devise operational </p>

<p>a unit of 40-50, with a component able to deploy alongside armed forces (the </p>
<p>recommended option); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a large, permanent department of 150-200 of whom about half could be </p>
<p>deployed.</p>
<p><b>910. </b> DOP agreed the proposed remit and to a scale somewhere between options two </p>
<p>and three.</p>

<p> DOP did not envisage that the unit itself should have a deployable capacity.</p>
<p><b>911. </b> Officials sent a second paper, setting out detailed structures and already agreed </p>
<p>by Mr Straw, Mr Benn and Mr Hoon, to DOP on 23 July.</p>
<p>575</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>912. </b> The paper proposed that:</p>
<p>“The PCRU will bring together financial, analytical, planning and personnel </p>
<p>resources that in the past have been distributed across government. This will enable </p>
<p>HMG to: </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>

<p>510</p>
<p><b>914. </b> The paper explained that there had been “substantial discussion” between </p>
<p>departments over governance and accountability. The proposed arrangements took into </p>
<p>account the need for:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>policy and strategy decisions to be taken inter-departmentally (policy would </p>
<p>be set jointly by departments through a Cabinet Office-chaired steering group, </p>
<p>reporting to a DOP Sub-Committee chaired by the Foreign Secretary); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>financial accountability to be the preserve of the DFID Permanent Secretary </p>
<p>as Accounting Officer for DFID funds.</p>
<p><b>915. </b> The paper stated that PCRU staffing would grow over two to three years to </p>
<p>become fully operational with a core staff of about 40. It would have “an additional surge </p>
<p>capacity and deployable element drawn from volunteers from across Whitehall, NGOs </p>
<p>and the private sector”. The proposed size reflected: </p>
<p>“… the need to support the likely scales of effort and concurrency of UK military </p>
<p>deployments as reflected in the Defence White Paper: one enduring minimum </p>
<p>deployment (e.g. the Balkans or Iraq) plus either two enduring small-scale </p>
<p>deployments (e.g. Sierra Leone or Mozambique flood relief) or one short-term </p>
<p>medium deployment (e.g. Afghanistan).”</p>
<p><b>916. </b> On 6 September, Sir Nigel Sheinwald informed members of DOP and Sir Andrew </p>
<p>Turnbull, the Cabinet Secretary, that Mr Blair was content with the management </p>
<p>arrangements set out in the July DOP paper. Mr Blair believed the PCRU should be </p>
<p>“lean”, with an ability to surge when required, and wanted staffing to be kept under </p>

<p>that the PCRU might not achieve its initial operating capability by the target date of </p>
<p>spring 2005.</p>
<p>579</p>
<p> Issues still to be resolved included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identification of the best department to manage the deployment of civilian police </p>
<p>officers;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need for the PCRU to operate in “a genuinely cross-departmental manner” </p>
<p>and not as “the advocate of a particular department’s priorities”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>provision of the funding needed not only to establish itself but to pay for </p>
<p>deployments. </p>
<p><b>920. </b> On 4 May 2005, Mr Neil Crompton, the departing Head of the IPU, expressed </p>
<p>doubts to Mr Sawers about the PCRU’s ability to achieve everything expected of it: </p>
<p>“MOD frustration with the pace of reconstruction has been a cause of much tension </p>
<p>within Whitehall. The creation of the PCRU should help resolve some of the issues, </p>
<p>but I doubt that it will solve the problem completely, HMG as a whole has lost the old </p>
<p>ODA [Overseas Development Agency] ability to ‘fix things’. DFID no longer regard </p>
<p>this as core business. Civilians and contractors have to operate under tight security </p>
<p>rules which prevent them operating at the required pace in environments like Iraq.</p>
<p>“Part of the solution is for MOD to regard post-conflict reconstruction as their core </p>
<p>business … MOD need to follow US practice and develop civil affairs battalions …</p>
<p>“In parallel, we need to sell the notion that military assets (particularly transport) </p>
<p>belong to HMG as a whole and that decisions on how they are deployed should be </p>
<p>determined by HMG, rather than MOD/PJHQ on the basis of military priorities … </p>
<p>We [FCO] and DFID should be involved in the force level review process in a </p>
<p>more formal way than our participation in Chiefs of Staff allows, so that wider </p>
<p>considerations are taken into account. PJHQ will resist – but we should persist.”</p>
<p>580</p>
<p><b>921. </b> Mr Sawers shared Mr Crompton’s scepticism about the PCRU, but suggested </p>
<p>that it would need to be tested in a real crisis.</p>
<p>581</p>
<p> He added:</p>
<p>“The MOD’s resistance to doing civilian reconstruction has been a problem and I </p>
<p>am attracted by your proposal that they should develop civil affairs battalions who </p>
<p>can actually restore basic services in a post-conflict environment. With DFID’s near </p>
<p>exclusive focus on poverty, and as you say their inability these days to ‘fix things’, it </p>
<p>is always going to be difficult to get DFID to wholeheartedly commit to underpinning </p>
<p>the political objectives of HMG. MOD is more resource constrained than DFID but </p>
<p>this is an area worth exploring with the new Defence Secretary.”</p>

<p>be tackled in post-conflict situations, such as security sector reform and governance. </p>
<p>The PCRU is also developing links with international organisations and other </p>
<p>Governments to ensure that the UK’s efforts are part of a co-ordinated contribution </p>
<p>to the international response to conflict. I expect the PCRU to be able, if necessary, </p>
<p>to plan and organise a large-scale deployment of up to several hundred civilians, </p>
<p>including police, as part of a post-conflict stabilisation operation by mid-2006.”</p>
<p>586</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>928. </b> In his valedictory report on leaving the PCRU in December 2005, Mr Schulte </p>
<p>described it as “the most sophisticated and integrated arrangement we know of”, </p>
<p>presenting “a significant opportunity to influence international – and particularly </p>
<p>American and EU – thinking and practice”.</p>
<p>587</p>
<p> But there had been difficulties, including </p>
<p>finding people with the right experience and skills who were willing to join an unproven </p>
<p>organisation and could be released quickly from their current jobs. There had also been </p>
<p>“departmental sensitivities over responsibilities and boundaries”. </p>
<p><b>929. </b> Mr Schulte concluded:</p>
<p>“… senior support will remain crucial for some time to ensure successful PCRU </p>
<p>involvement in cross-Whitehall work. The Unit relies critically upon the development </p>
<p>of coherent and effective cross-departmental working relationships. But they all </p>
<p>impose costs and demands on the staff time of others. We have learned that it is </p>
<p>sometimes difficult to persuade colleagues to take this on without direction from </p>
<p>within their own organisations.”</p>
<p><b>930. </b> A second internal review of the PCRU was carried out at the request of PCRU </p>
<p>Directors in January and February 2006.</p>

<p>THE PCRU AND IRAQ</p>
<p><b>931. </b> From autumn 2005, the PCRU looked for ways to support existing UK stabilisation </p>
<p>operations while continuing to build capacity to undertake possible “but very unlikely” </p>
<p>future large-scale deployments.</p>
<p>590</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>932. </b> At the request of the FCO, the PCRU provided a temporary head for the Political </p>
<p>Section at the British Embassy Office Basra from 9 to 23 December 2005.</p>
<p><b>933. </b> During March 2006, a member of the PCRU undertook a scoping study for the </p>
<p>UK-led Basra Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), which became operational during </p>
<p>May (see Section 10.2).</p>
<p><b>934. </b> In April 2006, no UK department or international partner, including the US, had a </p>
<p>budget for PRT running costs. The PCRU filled the gap.</p>
<p>591</p>
<p> It agreed to recruit and fund </p>
<p>three staff for a six-week period, including Mr Mark Etherington, the PRT Team Leader, </p>
<p>while discussions continued on funding.</p>
<p>592</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>935. </b> In July 2006, the PCRU’s support to the Basra PRT was extended to July 2007, </p>
<p>at a total cost of £758,000. Most work was expected to be completed by December </p>
<p>2006.</p>
<p>593</p>
<p><b>936. </b> In late July 2006, Mr Richard Teuten, Mr Schulte’s successor as Head of the </p>

<p><b>943. </b> On 19 March 2008, during a statement to Parliament on the launch of the UK’s </p>
<p>National Security Strategy, Mr Brown announced that:</p>
<p>“… the National Security Strategy proposes a new departure – and again, </p>
<p>it is a lesson learned from recent conflicts ranging from Rwanda to Bosnia to </p>
<p>Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia. It proposes to create a stand-by international </p>
<p>civilian capability so that for fragile and failing states, we can act quickly and </p>
<p>comprehensively by combining the humanitarian, peacekeeping, stabilisation and </p>
<p>reconstruction support that those countries need. In the same way as we have </p>
<p>military forces ready to respond to conflict, we must have civilian experts and </p>
<p>professionals ready to deploy quickly to assist failing states and to help rebuild </p>
<p>countries emerging from conflict, putting them on the road to economic and </p>
<p>political recovery.</p>
<p>“I can tell the house that Britain will start by making available a 1,000-strong UK </p>
<p>civilian stand-by capacity that will include police, emergency service professionals, </p>
<p>judges and trainers. I am calling on EU and NATO partners to set high and ambitious </p>

<p>517</p>
<p><b>945. </b> Ms Margaret Aldred, Deputy Head of the Overseas and Defence Secretariat  </p>
<p>(OD Sec) in the Cabinet Office, sent an interim report to departments on 24 July. </p>
<p><b>946. </b> Ms Aldred explained the background to the Review:</p>
<p>“The UK’s current civil effect capability has developed without a clear long-term </p>
<p>strategy, and more specific guidance is required on what our capability goals should </p>
<p>be. Our assessment is that existing mechanisms do not provide confidence that </p>
<p>current activity is effective (in terms of the skills and experience of the personnel </p>
<p>deployed) or sustainable (in terms of our ability to maintain current commitments </p>
<p>indefinitely). Moreover, there is no robust basis on which we could calculate our </p>
<p>“standby” or “total” capacity – of civil servants, police or contractors/consultants.  </p>
<p>If we are to make real progress then we need to agree broad policy objectives </p>
<p>for the capability around which we can design effective structures (or improve </p>
<p>existing ones).”</p>
<p><b>947. </b> The interim report proposed definitions of “stabilisation” and “civil effect” to define </p>
<p>the scope of the review:</p>
<p>“‘Stabilisation’ is support to places emerging from violent conflict in:</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>preventing or reducing violence;</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>protecting people and key institutions; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>promoting political processes which lead to greater stability; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>preparing for longer-term development and non-violent politics.</p>
<p>‘Civil effect’ is activity to build public confidence and support for an enduring peace </p>
<p>and focuses on the ‘survival functions’ of a state: </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>public order and the rule of law; </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>basic public services; and </p>
<p>{</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>economic stability.</p>
<p>For success, an integrated effort – bringing together the efforts of civilian agencies </p>
<p>(including multilateral), military and local partners – is required.”</p>
<p><b>948. </b> The interim report proposed a capability that would:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>support joint civil-military stabilisation operations with at least 100 civilians and </p>
<p>50 police continuously deployed;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>make a further contribution of up to 100 civilians and 100 police to a wider range </p>
<p>of multilateral deployments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identify at least 1,000 personnel as a “UK Civilian Standby Capability”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>incorporate a “Stabilisation Volunteer Network” able to draw on a wider range </p>
<p>of volunteers than existing mechanisms. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>518</p>
<p><b>949. </b> The report emphasised that funding issues would need to be resolved. Such a </p>
<p>capability would cost between £8m and £10m a year to maintain, with additional and </p>
<p>more substantial deployment costs. </p>
<p><b>950. </b> On the multilateral response, the interim report recommended establishing a </p>
<p>shared international assessment of need, leading by example in seeking agreed national </p>
<p>targets for contributions, and seeking to improve international structures.</p>
<p><b>951. </b> The Cabinet Office produced a supplementary report on 5 September.</p>
<p>605</p>
<p>  </p>
<p>The report proposed four options:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the status quo: about 270 civilian personnel deployed at an estimated annual </p>
<p>cost of £70m to £90m;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a UK standby capacity able to deploy up to 350 better qualified personnel, </p>
<p>costing £98m to £140m per year;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an expanded standby capacity able to deploy 550 personnel, costing £122m </p>
<p>to £171m; or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a Civilian Reserve Corps of around 2,500 able to deploy 500 personnel at any </p>
<p>one time, at significant additional cost.</p>
<p><b>952. </b> The final paper, reflecting discussions between Sir Gus O’Donnell, Sir Andrew </p>
<p>Turnbull’s successor as Cabinet Secretary, and the FCO, MOD and DFID Permanent </p>
<p>Secretaries, was produced for NSID(OD) on 21 January 2009.</p>
<p>606</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>953. </b> The paper stated that, although the UK’s performance was improving as previous </p>
<p>reforms and learning from operational experience took effect, the review had identified </p>
<p>a number of problems:</p>
<p>“Whitehall structures to deliver civil effect are currently fragmented. MOD, DFID, </p>
<p>FCO and the Stabilisation Unit each deploy personnel to stabilisation and civil effect </p>
<p>missions. Problems include the lack of single-point accountability for stabilisation </p>
<p>policy, objectives, capability and delivery in Whitehall: multiple and poorly  </p>
<p>co-ordinated mechanisms for resourcing civil effect; no effective unified performance </p>
<p>management of individuals; little effective measurement of the overall impact of civil </p>
<p>effect; no cross-Whitehall register of available skills; limited UK civil effect planning </p>
<p>capability; and a SU role that lacks clarity, focus and authority.”</p>
<p><b>954. </b> The paper’s recommendations included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>creation of a Civilian Standby Capacity (CSC) from at least 1,000 civilians and </p>
<p>a further 500 police, to provide a capability to deploy continuously at least 350  </p>

<p>relevant skills to be available to deploy as part of the CSC.</p>
<p><b>955. </b> The review made no specific recommendations on enhancing multilateral </p>
<p>stabilisation capacity, but stated:</p>
<p>“A significant UK commitment to develop enhanced national civilian capabilities … </p>
<p>will put us in a stronger position to argue for ambitious new capability targets for </p>
<p>civilian deployable capacity, and to galvanise other contributions to improve the </p>
<p>effectiveness of multilateral stabilisation and early recovery capabilities.” </p>
<p><b>956. </b> The review explained that previous efforts to strengthen capabilities had “lacked </p>
<p>the strategic drive, authority and resources to overcome the obstacles encountered”. </p>
<p>Short-term operational requirements had diverted attention from medium-term capability </p>
<p>development. An implementation team would therefore be set up before the end of </p>

<p><b>957. </b> Sir Gus O’Donnell commented on 20 January that, while he agreed with the report, </p>

<p>She explained that DFID had already taken increased responsibility for the SU. The </p>
<p>DFID Director chairing the SU Board would act as Senior Responsible Officer for the </p>
<p>Unit and be responsible for developing capability and overall performance. More broadly, </p>
<p>departments had agreed that the SU Board needed to provide “more active governance </p>
<p>and direction” for the Unit than had been the case in the past.</p>
<p><b>960. </b> In October 2009, the SU took over responsibility from the FCO for managing the </p>
<p>deployment of civilians and police officers to international missions.</p>
<p>609</p>
<p><b>961. </b> The MOD, FCO and DFID produced a joint memorandum on progress against </p>
<p>the recommendations in the Cabinet Office review for the House of Commons Defence </p>
<p>Committee in December 2009.</p>
<p>610</p>
<p> The joint memorandum stated:</p>
<p>“A 1,000 strong civilian capability (of whom 200 can be deployed at any one time) </p>
<p>has been developed ahead of schedule; greater capacity for planning and rapid </p>
<p>reaction in [the] Stabilisation Unit will be in place by the December [2009] target </p>
<p>date; and progress has also been made on deployment of military Reservists in </p>
<p>a civilian capacity and police deployments. The additional capabilities have been </p>
<p>developed at a significantly lower cost than originally envisaged.”</p>
<p><b>962. </b> In a brief reference to Iraq, the joint memorandum stated:</p>
<p>“… SU managed consultants to support capacity building in Basra International </p>
<p>Airport, leading to the handover to Iraqi control in January 2009, improved the </p>
<p>effectiveness of donor support in rule of law nationally and undertook a series of </p>
<p>reviews to improve the effectiveness of the Basra PRT and identify future lessons.” </p>
<p><b>963. </b> In August 2010, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) published a review of </p>

<p>improved co-ordination in-country, but that the UK was “not yet delivering on its full </p>
<p>potential to engage in fragile states”. Five issues were highlighted:</p>
<p>“The first has been a mismatch between ambitions and resources … a gap existed </p>
<p>between what was expected by Cabinet Ministers and promised to the public, and </p>
<p>what was resourced by way of programmes and capabilities …</p>
<p>“The second concerns the mechanisms for the allocation of resources … and the </p>
<p>decisions on relative priorities … The current system pushes effort towards current </p>
<p>crises at the expense of forestalling future crises [and] perpetuates an imbalance </p>
<p>between the use of military and civilian tools …</p>
<p>“The third problem is the fact that loyalty remains to departments rather than to the </p>
<p>Government as a whole … Pooled funding arrangements account for only a small </p>
<p>proportion of resources devoted to fragile states.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Fourth, there are still areas where the UK’s ability to send the right people … to </p>
<p>work in hostile environments needs to be on a more sustained and reliable footing … </p>
<p>The gap between government ambition and UK capability on policing, for example, </p>
<p>has if anything grown rather than diminished.</p>
<p>“Fifth and finally … Lessons are recorded and stored by the MOD, DFID, the Foreign </p>
<p>Office and academia, but rarely dusted off when new decisions have to be made at </p>
<p>Ministerial or official level.”</p>
<p><b>965. </b> In November 2010, the SU produced a paper on lessons learned from the UK’s </p>
<p>growing experience of stabilisation activities.</p>
<p>612</p>
<p> Designed to “provide policymakers and </p>
<p>practitioners with accessible material, which conveys both the breadth and depth of </p>
<p>challenges facing the UK and other international partners”, the lessons included the </p>
<p>need to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>exercise caution when transferring lessons from one conflict to another;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that economic and development objectives complement and support </p>
<p>efforts to promote a peaceful political process (an effective response required </p>
<p>understanding of multiple political interests and how they are leveraged to </p>
<p>impede or facilitate stabilisation); </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>form a single multi-disciplinary and multi-departmental team;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>implement activities in a way that builds on local culture, context and the </p>
<p>operating environment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adopt a flexible and adaptive approach to monitoring and evaluation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>secure community engagement;</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>apply rigorous quality assurance in selecting the right people;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>recognise non-state forms of local governance, security, justice and dispute </p>
<p>resolution that are often more familiar and meaningful to most of the population </p>
<p>than state-wide government; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>adopt a two-speed approach to security (short-term stabilisation, principally </p>
<p>through local actors, at the same time as creating the conditions for longer-term </p>
<p>security sector reform).</p>
<p><b>966. </b> Sir Gus O’Donnell and Sir Peter Ricketts, the National Security Adviser, sent an </p>
<p>update on the SU to the Inquiry on 19 January 2011.</p>
<p>613</p>
<p> They reported that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>1,289 civilians had been approved for the Civilian Stabilisation Group (CSG), </p>
<p>including 1,012 Deployable Civilian Experts (DCE) and 277 members of the </p>
<p>CSSC;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the SVN now included the Local Government Association (LGA), the National </p>
<p>Health Service (NHS), private sector companies and a number of NGOs;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD and the SU continued to discuss the best ways of identifying </p>
<p>Reservists’ civilian skills and increasing interoperability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>now the SU was responsible for international secondments and police </p>
<p>deployments, it was the sole government delivery unit for civil effect;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the SU could provide planning support to UK operations with or without a UK </p>
<p>military presence, and to international partners;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the SU would take the lead in establishing Stabilisation Response Teams </p>
<p>(SRTs), the joint civilian-military capability announced in the 2010 SDSR; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a new International Police Assistance Group (IPAG) had been formed in </p>
<p>September 2009 to develop more robust arrangements for delivering police </p>
<p>capabilities for civil effect. A pool of 125 police officers was now on standby for </p>
<p>deployment for stabilisation efforts. </p>
<p><b>967. </b> The Building Stability Overseas Strategy (BSOS) was published in July 2011 by </p>
<p>DFID, the FCO and the MOD.</p>
<p>614</p>
<p> The three departments undertook to strengthen their </p>
<p>integrated approach to tackling instability and conflict by increasing the integration of </p>
<p>skills and capacities across government. Those included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strong intelligence and assessments;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>diplomacy;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>development work;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>defence engagement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promotion of trade and open markets; and</p>

<p>523</p>
<p><b>968. </b> The BSOS stated that the SU could:</p>
<p>“… respond rapidly to conflict or pre-conflict situations on behalf of the Government, </p>
<p>and in partnership with other key players. The Unit draws upon expertise from </p>
<p>across government, the police and the military to deliver these outcomes. It also </p>
<p>manages the Civilian Stabilisation Group of over 1,000 civilian experts from the </p>
<p>public and private sector with critical stabilisation skills and expertise.”</p>
<p><b>969. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry in 2013 that Reservists mobilised through the Military </p>
<p>Stabilisation Support Group (MSSG) were routinely employed by the SU in a civilian </p>
<p>capacity in the CSG.</p>
<p>615</p>
<p> The MOD explained that the MSSG provided a full-time </p>
<p>Regular Liaison Officer to the SU. The Commander of MSSG was a member of the </p>
<p>SU Management Board and attended the Building Stability Overseas Board as an </p>
<p>observer.</p>
<p>616</p>
<p><b>970. </b> ‘The UK Government’s Approach to Stabilisation (2014)’, published by the SU </p>
<p>in May 2014, listed four characteristics of the Government’s approach: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Any action “will be planned and implemented with an overtly political objective </p>
<p>in mind, ideally with a means of identifying success and a process of transition </p>
<p>to longer-term recovery”. In some environments the political need to act might </p>
<p>make things worse in the short term.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It will be integrated and civilian-led, unifying effort across government, including </p>
<p>when there are military-led tasks such as patrols to bolster security.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It will be “flexible and targeted” and can be applied in a state or part of a state </p>
<p>affected by violent political conflict. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Stabilisation “will be transitory but cannot afford to be short term in outlook or </p>
<p>objectives” and “must be planned or implemented with reference to other parallel </p>
<p>or longer-term engagement”.</p>
<p>617</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>971. </b> The SU paper listed three “mutually reinforcing components of stabilisation”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>protecting political actors, the political system and the population;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>promoting, consolidating and strengthening political processes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparing for longer-term recovery.</p>
<p><b>972. </b> The SU used the example of Iraq to illustrate the importance of security as one </p>
<p>of the three components:</p>
<p>“… the disbanding of the Iraqi security forces after the US-led invasion in 2003 </p>
<p>meant that large numbers of previously enfranchised Sunnis at senior and junior </p>
<p>levels now had no role in the new Iraqi state. This not only created a security </p>

<p>vacuum which Allied forces did not have the capacity to fill but also resulted </p>
<p>in alienation of the former army. This actively contributed to deterioration in </p>
<p>security, hampered political progress and was a factor leading to the subsequent </p>
<p>insurgency …”</p>
<p><b>973. </b> In 2014/15, the SU was based in the FCO and jointly owned by the FCO, MOD and </p>
<p>DFID.</p>
<p>618</p>
<p> It used DFID financial and risk management systems and had a DFID Senior </p>
<p>Responsible Officer.</p>
<p><b>974. </b> The SU’s 2014/15 Business Plan explained that the Unit had an operational role </p>
<p>across all three pillars of the BSOS:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>early warning;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>rapid crisis prevention and response; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>investing in upstream prevention.</p>
<p>619</p>
<p><b>975. </b> The SU’s contribution included:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>being the hub for Joint Analysis of Conflict and Stability (JACS);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the UK National Security Council (NSC) by facilitating development </p>
<p>of cross-government strategies for fragile and conflict-affected states;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing high-quality advice on the design and implementation of programmes </p>
<p>funded by the Conflict Pool/Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF);</p>
<p>620</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>supporting the development of monitoring and evaluation guidance;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>capturing and disseminating lessons learned;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maintaining the CSG database; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing a hub for the Government’s non-operational international policing </p>
<p>activity.</p>
<p><b>The impact of the PCRU and the SU</b></p>
<p><b>976. </b> Witnesses to the Inquiry gave conflicting evidence on the impact of the PCRU </p>
<p>and the SU. </p>
<p><b>977. </b> Mr Benn told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think the PCRU and now the Stabilisation Unit is a very practical response to </p>
<p>a need that has been identified.</p>

<p>620 </p>
<p>The Conflict Pool funded UK conflict prevention, stabilisation and peacekeeping activities in support of </p>
<p>the Building Stability Overseas Strategy. In April 2015 it was replaced by the Conflict, Stability and Security </p>
<p>Fund (CSSF). </p>

<p>“Of course, it doesn’t provide the whole of the answer, but it means that you </p>
<p>are in a better position to do that range of work that is required in these kinds of </p>
<p>circumstances. So it is about learning lessons, building capacity to be able to do </p>
<p>it better in the future.”</p>
<p>621</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>978. </b> Lord Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff from May 2003 to April 2006, was critical </p>
<p>of the early days of the PCRU. He told the Inquiry that the problem of pulling together </p>
<p>the strands of post-conflict activity had been an issue since the Balkans, but the PCRU </p>
<p>had gone into “university mode: lots of discussions sitting round the table”.</p>
<p>622</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>979. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti also commented on the PCRU’s difficult start in 2005, </p>
<p>but told the Inquiry that its performance had improved during 2006 and 2007, when it </p>
<p>became “more focused on operational work, rather than … policy and strategy, which </p>
<p>was left with the three departments”.</p>
<p>623</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>980. </b> Dr Shafik, who succeeded Sir Suma Chakrabarti as Permanent Secretary at about </p>
<p>the time the PCRU became the SU, told the Inquiry that the SU’s contribution in Iraq was </p>
<p>“relatively modest, because, by that stage, the numbers of people that we needed to </p>
<p>deploy were relatively small”, whereas in Afghanistan it had been “hugely important”.</p>
<p>624</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In the early days the Unit had been a “body shop”, but it had “evolved enormously”, </p>
<p>becoming “the repository for expertise on how to do stabilisation well” and, as it had built </p>
<p>its credibility in Whitehall, starting to lead programmes in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>625</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>981. </b> Dr Shafik also confirmed that agreement had been reached with the MOD on </p>
<p>incorporating military Reservists into the pool of deployable expertise available to </p>
<p>the SU. The key was: </p>
<p>“… when people deploy, they have to be clear what they are doing. Are they there </p>
<p>as a soldier or are they there as a civilian? I think that distinction of roles is quite </p>
<p>important, but tapping into the expertise is a huge potential gain … if a reservist, </p>
<p>for example, happens to have skills in accounting or in agriculture, they can be </p>
<p>employed by the Stabilisation Unit, but in their civilian capacity.”</p>
<p><b>982. </b> Ms Lindy Cameron, Head of DFID Baghdad from 2004 to 2005, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>it was only the SU’s work to put civilians on military courses that had eventually begun to </p>
<p>undermine some of the military’s preconceptions about DFID. It was not until then “that </p>
<p>people realised that actually there was a real intention on DFID’s part to actually make </p>
<p>this work collectively”.</p>
