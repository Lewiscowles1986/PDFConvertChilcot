<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the cost of the UK’s involvement in Iraq; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the main sources of funding for the UK’s involvement, the different arrangements </p>
<p>for funding military operations and civilian activities, and how those </p>
<p>arrangements changed; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the estimates of the cost of military operations and civilian activities that were </p>
<p>made before the invasion, and the extent to which those estimates influenced </p>
<p>key decisions; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the imposition of controls over the MOD’s management of its resources by the </p>
<p>Treasury in September 2003; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the allocations for civilian activities that were made before, during and after the </p>
<p>conflict; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>how expenditure was scrutinised. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address how departments used the resources available to </p>
<p>them. Specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The provision of military equipment is considered in Sections 6.3 and 14. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s support for reconstruction is considered in Section 10. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK’s support for Security Sector Reform is considered in Section 12.</p>
<p><b>The cost of the UK’s intervention in Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>3. </b> The direct cost to the UK Government of its intervention in Iraq between the UK </p>
<p>financial years 2002/03 and 2009/10 was at least £9.2bn in cash terms</p>
<p>1</p>

<p>The Government has confirmed that the expenditure figures for DFID and the FCO that were provided by </p>
<p>Sir Nicholas Macpherson, Director General in charge of Public Expenditure from 2001 to 2005 and then </p>
<p>Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, in his statement to the Inquiry of 15 January 2010, were inaccurate. </p>
<p>That statement was published by the Inquiry on 22 January 2010.</p>

<p><b>4. </b> In addition, the UK provided £0.95bn in debt relief to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> The figures above do not include expenditure by departments other than the MOD, </p>
<p>the FCO and DFID. Although other departments made important contributions to the UK </p>
<p>effort, in particular in the post&#8209;conflict period, their expenditure was relatively small. The </p>
<p>Inquiry has made no estimate of the opportunity cost of the UK’s involvement in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>6. </b> The chart below shows the direct cost of military operations and civilian activities by </p>
<p>financial year. A more detailed breakdown of direct costs is provided at the end of this </p>
<p>Section.</p>
<p>Figure 1: Direct cost of military operations and civilian activities by financial year (£m) </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Nicholas Macpherson, Director General in charge of Public </p>
<p>Expenditure from 2001 to 2005 and then Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, about </p>
<p>additional, or indirect, costs such as continuing disability and medical costs for veterans.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Nicholas confirmed that such costs were not captured in the information provided to </p>
<p>the Inquiry by the Government. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> In October 2002, the Treasury estimated that the indirect cost of a conflict could more </p>
<p>than double the direct cost.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p><b>9. </b> Several estimates have been made of the total (direct and indirect) cost of the Iraq </p>
<p>War. In their 2007 book, <i>The Three Trillion Dollar War,</i> Professor Joseph Stiglitz and </p>
<p>Ms Linda Bilmes estimated that the total cost of US involvement in Iraq could be double </p>
<p>the direct cost to the US Government.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> The total cost included: veterans’ future costs </p>

<p><b>10. </b> Indirect costs include the costs of the inquiries that have been established to </p>
<p>investigate aspects of the UK’s intervention in Iraq. Those include: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Al&#8209;Sweady Public Inquiry, which reported in December 2014, cost £25m.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Baha Mousa Public Inquiry, which reported in September 2011, cost £13m.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The cost of the Iraq Inquiry, which is published on the Inquiry’s website. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Iraq Historic Allegations Team (IHAT), which was established in 2010, has </p>
<p>a budget of £57.2m up to the end of 2019.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>11. </b> The US Congress appropriated US$686bn for operations in Iraq between the US </p>
<p>fiscal years 2002</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> and 2009.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> That comprised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US$646bn (94 percent) for the US Department of Defense;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US$36bn (five percent) for the US Department of State and the US Agency for </p>
<p>International Development (USAID); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US$4bn (one percent) for the Department of Veterans Administration (DVA). </p>
<p><b>12. </b> US Department of Defense figures included costs associated with the Commanders </p>
<p>Emergency Response Program (CERPs) and the Iraq Security Forces Fund (ISFF). </p>
<p>US Department of State and USAID figures included the cost of reconstruction, foreign </p>
<p>aid programmes, and embassy operation and construction. DVA costs included medical </p>
<p>programmes for Operation Iraqi Freedom veterans. </p>
<p><b>How the UK’s intervention in Iraq was funded</b></p>
<p><b>13. </b> There were three main sources of UK funding for the UK’s operations in Iraq: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>departments’ baseline spending settlements; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Reserve (including the Special Reserve); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inter&#8209;departmental funds (the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, the Conflict Pool </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>448</p>
<p><b>14. </b> A department’s budget comprises Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) and </p>
<p>Annually Managed Expenditure (AME). </p>
<p><b>15. </b> In general, DEL covers running costs and all programmed expenditure. It is split into </p>
<p>Resource DEL (RDEL) (operating costs) and Capital DEL (CDEL) (new investment). </p>
<p>From 2002/03, when full Resource Accounting and Budgeting was introduced, RDEL </p>
<p>included ‘non&#8209;cash’ costs. The introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting </p>
<p>is considered later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>16. </b> Non&#8209;cash costs are costs which are not reflected by cash transactions, for example </p>
<p>depreciation and provisions for bad debts.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> They are included in budgets to ensure that </p>
<p>the budgets reflect the full economic cost of activities. </p>
<p><b>17. </b> AME relates to expenditure that is demand&#8209;led (for example, for the MOD, the </p>
<p>payment of War Pensions) and therefore cannot be controlled by departments and </p>
<p>accommodated within a structured budget process. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> In the period covered by the Inquiry, the Treasury allowed departments to carry </p>
<p>forward unspent funds from one financial year to the next under the End&#8209;Year Flexibility </p>
<p>(EYF) system. Unspent funds would otherwise have to be returned to the Treasury. </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The EYF system was replaced in 2011/12 by the Budget Exchange system.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The roles of the Treasury and the Chancellor, and the </b></p>
<p><i><b>Ministerial Code</i> </b></p>
<p>The Chancellor of the Exchequer has overall responsibility for the work of the Treasury </p>
<p>and is the Government’s Finance Minister.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>The Treasury is the UK’s economic and finance ministry, setting the direction of the UK’s </p>
<p>economic and fiscal policy. The finance ministry side of the department is responsible for </p>
<p>overall fiscal policy, including control of public expenditure and strategic oversight of the </p>
<p>UK tax system. The Treasury’s economic ministry role includes responsibility for growth, </p>
<p>infrastructure, productivity and oversight of the financial services sector. The Treasury is </p>
<p>also responsible for the UK’s overall macroeconomic strategy, including the setting of the </p>
<p>monetary policy framework. </p>
<p>In his statement to the Inquiry, Sir Nicholas Macpherson, Permanent Secretary at the </p>
<p>Treasury from 2005, stated that the Treasury had two principal roles in relation to Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as an economics ministry, to help ensure the potential economic impacts of war </p>
<p>in Iraq were taken into account in economic forecasting and policy&#8209;making, help </p>
<p>plan the economic reconstruction of Iraq, and provide economic expertise to </p>
<p>support the UK’s post&#8209;conflict reconstruction efforts; and</p>
<p>14 </p>
<p>Email Treasury [junior official] to Iraq Inquiry [junior official], 17 April 2014, ‘Further Queries Relating </p>
<p>to Resources’. </p>
<p>15 </p>
<p>Treasury, <i>2011 Budget, </i>23 March 2011<i>.</i> </p>
<p>16 </p>
<p>The Inquiry has drawn on a number of official sources to develop a statement of the responsibilities of </p>
<p>the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>449</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>as a finance ministry, to ensure an appropriate level of funding was provided to </p>
<p>achieve the UK’s objectives in Iraq and that it was used cost&#8209;effectively.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This Section describes the Treasury’s involvement on Iraq in relation to both those roles. </p>
<p>The Treasury’s involvement in planning for and supporting Iraq’s post&#8209;conflict economic </p>
<p>reconstruction is described in Sections 6.4, 6.5 and 10. </p>
<p>The version of the <i>Ministerial Code</i> that was current in 2003 stated that the cost of a </p>
<p>proposal should be calculated and discussed with the Treasury before that proposal was </p>
<p>submitted for discussion at Cabinet level: </p>
<p>“It is the responsibility of the initiating department to ensure that proposals have </p>
<p>been discussed with other departments and the results of these discussions reflected </p>
<p>in the memorandum submitted to Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee. Proposals </p>
<p>involving expenditure or affecting general financial policy should be discussed with </p>
<p>the Treasury before being submitted to the Cabinet or a Ministerial Committee. </p>
<p>The result of the discussion together with an estimate of the cost to the Exchequer </p>
<p>(or estimates, including the Treasury’s estimate, if the department and the Treasury </p>
<p>disagree) should be included, along with an indication of how the cost would be met </p>
<p>(e.g. by offsetting savings). The estimate of the cost should identify any impact on </p>
<p>other departments.”</p>
<p>18</p>
<p><b>20. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that departmental settlements were the </p>
<p>main source of funding for FCO activity in Iraq, including the UK’s diplomatic presence in </p>
<p>Baghdad and Basra, and for DFID’s contribution to the humanitarian and reconstruction </p>
<p>effort.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p> Before the invasion, the Treasury worked with departments to produce estimates </p>
<p>of the potential cost of intervention and to ensure that, where appropriate, sufficient </p>
<p>funding had been set aside within their existing budgets.</p>
<p><b>21. </b> If departments were unable to fund activities from their departmental settlements, </p>
<p>they could bid to the Treasury for additional funding from the Reserve. </p>
<p><b>22. </b> The table below shows the departmental settlements for the MOD, the FCO and </p>
<p>DFID from 2002/03 to 2009/10 (under the 2002, 2004 and 2007 Comprehensive </p>
<p>Spending Reviews).</p>

<p><b>24. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that the MOD was funded through its </p>
<p>departmental settlement to be ready for war, but not to go to war.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> The costs of going to </p>
<p>war – the net additional costs of military operations, or NACMO – were reclaimed by the </p>
<p>MOD from the Reserve. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> Sir Nicholas also told the Inquiry that the main call on the Reserve in relation to Iraq </p>
<p>had been from the MOD, to pay for NACMO.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p> The Treasury had also accepted “small </p>
<p>claims” against the Reserve from DFID and the FCO in relation to expenditure on Iraq </p>
<p>that could not be met from their own resources or interdepartmental budgets. </p>
<p><b>26. </b> NACMO included expenditure on Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs). </p>
<p>UORs are urgent requirements for military equipment that arise due to the particular </p>

<p><b>28. </b> The Global Conflict Prevention Pool (GCPP) and the Africa Conflict Prevention </p>
<p>Pool (ACPP) were established in the 2001 Spending Review to fund peacekeeping and </p>
<p>peace enforcement operations and conflict prevention programmes.</p>
<p>26</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>29. </b> The two Pools were financed by transfers of existing budgets (and activities) from </p>
<p>the MOD, the FCO and DFID and the provision of additional funds by the Treasury.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The three departments took decisions collectively on allocations from the Pools.</p>
<p><b>30. </b> The GCPP and ACPP budgets had two elements: programme spending and </p>
<p>peacekeeping costs.</p>
<p>28</p>
<p> The peacekeeping budget was used to pay UK contributions </p>
<p>to peace support operations mandated by multi&#8209;national or inter&#8209;governmental </p>
<p>organisations. It also covered the costs of deploying UK personnel in both UN and </p>
<p>non&#8209;UN peace support operations and the UK contribution to international criminal </p>
<p>courts. The budget covered both assessed and non&#8209;assessed (or voluntary) </p>
<p>contributions. </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that the Government had intended that </p>
<p>the Pools should promote a more co&#8209;ordinated approach across departments.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><b>32. </b> The budget for the GCPP for 2003/04 was £483m, of which £378m was allocated </p>
<p>to fund the UK’s contributions to peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations and </p>
<p>£105m was allocated for conflict prevention programmes.</p>
<p>30</p>
<p><b>33. </b> The ACPP and the GCPP were merged in April 2008 to form the Conflict Prevention </p>
<p>Pool. A separate funding mechanism, the Stabilisation Aid Fund (SAF), was established </p>
<p>in the same year to support stabilisation activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. The SAF was </p>
<p>merged into the Conflict Prevention Pool in 2009. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> The UK military also had access to significant amounts of US funding from CERPs, </p>
<p>to spend on urgent relief and reconstruction needs. </p>
<p><b>35. </b> The US Congress appropriated US$3.6bn for CERPs between 2004 and 30 June </p>
<p>2009, to be used by military commanders to address urgent relief and reconstruction </p>
<p>needs in their areas of responsibility.</p>
<p>31</p>
<p> Of that, almost US$3.2bn was spent.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> The US Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) reported </p>
<p>in July 2009 that, by April 2009, the US had spent or allocated to ongoing projects </p>

<p>that force to the required standard of readiness, including essential work to meet </p>
<p>equipment shortfalls, would be between £500m and £800m.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With six months’ notice, the UK could deploy a large&#8209;scale force comprising air </p>
<p>and naval assets and a land force of 35,000 personnel. The cost of preparing </p>
<p>that force would be between £800m and £1.1bn.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>With nine months’ notice, the UK could deploy the large&#8209;scale force at less risk. </p>
<p>The cost of preparing that force would be between £900m and £1.2bn. </p>
<p><b>44. </b> The costs of deployment and campaigning were additional to the cost of preparing </p>
<p>those forces. </p>
<p><b>45. </b> Mr William Nye, Head of the Treasury Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, </p>
<p>provided Mr Brown with “some wider context” on 7 June.</p>
<p>41</p>
<p> Mr Nye advised that there </p>
<p>would be four elements in the cost of military operations against Iraq:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preparing for the operation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deployment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the campaign; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>any follow&#8209;up operation, “e.g. a sustained peacekeeping deployment if part </p>
<p>of Iraq was occupied”. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> Mr Nye advised that Mr Hoon’s minute covered only the first of those elements. </p>
<p>The MOD estimated the cost of deploying a large&#8209;scale force at £100m, plus a similar </p>
<p>amount for bringing it back. Estimating the cost of a campaign was “impossible” in the </p>
<p>absence of any concept of operations, but would be “several £100 millions”. The MOD </p>
<p>had “understandably” given no thought to costs “after the war”, but:</p>
<p>“… there must at least be the possibility of some medium&#8209;term deployment for </p>
<p>peacekeeping or occupation. If on the scale of the Balkans, it would cost several </p>
<p>£100 millions a year.” </p>
<p><b>47. </b> Mr Nye advised that, while a smaller military contribution would reduce costs, the </p>
<p>MOD was “strongly in favour of the more expensive large&#8209;scale land contribution … </p>
<p>Ostensibly this is for reasons of strategic influence.” Another way to reduce costs would </p>
<p>be to provide a more specialised contribution; for example, a land component, or an air </p>
<p>component, but not both. The MOD argued that it was premature to close off any option </p>
<p>until the US had a clear concept of operations. </p>
<p><b>48. </b> Mr Nye stated that he assumed Mr Brown would not want to comment on Mr Hoon’s </p>
<p>minute on paper, but that he might want to factor those points into his discussions with </p>
<p>Mr Blair.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>454</p>
<p><b>49. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think Mr Hoon wrote [to] me in June – I think the Treasury did a paper in June </p>
<p>about these very issues. I was then advised … to talk to Mr Blair. I told him [Mr Blair] </p>
<p>that I would not … try to rule out any military option on the grounds of cost. Quite the </p>
<p>opposite … we understood that some options were more expensive than others, but </p>
<p>we should accept the option that was right for our country.”</p>
<p>42</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Sir David Manning, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, replied to Mr Hoon’s minute of </p>
<p>31 May on 25 June, stating:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister has asked for further advice on precisely what steps would </p>
<p>have to be taken now, including financial commitments, in order to keep open the </p>
<p>possibility of deploying a large&#8209;scale force by the end of this year …”</p>
<p>43</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Mr Peter Watkins, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary, replied to Sir David on 26 June, </p>
<p>providing an update on the MOD’s understanding of US plans.</p>
<p>44</p>
<p> Mr Watkins stated that </p>
<p>Mr Hoon believed that, before committing UK forces, Ministers would want to be clear on </p>
<p>four issues including “whether the prospective outcome looks worth the risk, costs and </p>
<p>losses”. A key issue, which would determine the need to commit resources, would be </p>
<p>whether the UK could “secure adequate influence for a large&#8209;scale contribution”. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> On 5 July, prompted by updates on US planning circulated by the MOD, Mr Nye </p>
<p>advised Mr Mark Bowman, Mr Brown’s Private Secretary, that Mr Brown should write to </p>
<p>the MOD to propose that all options for UK participation in military operations (including </p>
<p>smaller and more specialised options) should be costed, so that the Government could </p>
<p>assess how much it wished to devote – in terms of risk to UK troops, the opportunity </p>
<p>cost of withdrawing from other operations, and the financial cost – to securing a degree </p>
<p>of influence over US policy and operations.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> Mr Nye concluded: </p>
<p>“No.10, MOD, and FCO officials are likely to take as read that the UK should </p>
<p>participate if the US decides to go ahead, and on a large scale. Actually, we have </p>
<p>some choices …” </p>
<p><b>53. </b> The Treasury informed the Inquiry that Mr Brown decided not to write to the MOD.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>54. </b> Mr Blair discussed Iraq with Mr Jack Straw (the Foreign Secretary), Mr Hoon, </p>

<p><b>55. </b> In a paper prepared for the meeting, the Cabinet Office invited Ministers to “note </p>
<p>the potentially long lead times involved in equipping UK Armed Forces to undertake </p>
<p>operations in the Iraqi theatre and agree that MOD should bring forward proposals for </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>56. </b> The record of the meeting produced by Mr Matthew Rycroft, Mr Blair’s Private </p>

<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>We should work on the assumption that the UK would take part in any military </p>
<p>action. But we needed a fuller picture of US planning before we could take any </p>
<p>firm decisions … </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>in preparation for this operation.”</p>
<p>49</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>57. </b> Mr Rycroft’s record of the meeting was sent to the participants only.</p>
<p><b>58. </b> Mr Campbell described the meeting in his diaries.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> He recalled that Mr Blair had </p>
<p>said that “he did not want any discussions with any other departments at this stage … </p>
<p>He meant the Treasury.” </p>
<p><b>59. </b> Mr Rycroft told the Inquiry that Mr Blair followed up the question of funding for </p>
<p>preparing for an operation through “separate contacts” with Mr Brown.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> Mr Rycroft </p>
<p>agreed with the Inquiry that, due to the nature of the relationship between Mr Blair and </p>
<p>Mr Brown, matters involving Mr Brown were usually handled personally by Mr Blair, </p>
<p>rather than through a letter or note to the Treasury. Mr Rycroft told the Inquiry that the </p>
<p>use of that personal channel did not imply that Mr Brown was not aligned with UK policy. </p>
<p><b>60. </b> The MOD provided No.10 with advice on options for a UK contribution to US&#8209;led </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>456</p>
<p><b>63. </b> An MOD official advised Mr Watkins on 30 July that in order to respond to a </p>
<p>Ministerial decision on operations in Iraq, the MOD would need to submit a “strategic </p>
<p>estimate” of additional costs to the Treasury “as soon as practicably possible”.</p>
<p>53</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>64. </b> Mr Watkins forwarded that advice to Mr Hoon with the comment:</p>
<p>“In principle, it would be sensible to do more staff work to refine costs … but, </p>
<p>pending the PM/Chancellor discussion, it cannot involve financial commitments.”</p>
<p>54</p>
<p><b>65. </b> Mr Watkins replied to the MOD official the following day, confirming that Mr Hoon </p>
<p>had seen the advice and reporting:</p>
<p>“The question of whether funds could be expended in preparation for an operation </p>
<p>in Iraq is being considered separately elsewhere. In the meantime, no costs should </p>
<p>be incurred … No estimates should be submitted to Treasury officials. I will minute </p>
<p>further once the funding position is clearer.”</p>
<p>55</p>
<p><b>66. </b> The MOD told the Inquiry that neither Mr Watkins nor any other official wrote to </p>
<p>provide further advice on the funding position.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>67. </b> On 4 September, in advance of a planned meeting between Mr Hoon and </p>
<p>Mr Brown, Mr Nye briefed Mr Brown that the MOD officials had done little work to </p>
<p>refine their cost estimates for preparing a medium and large&#8209;scale force, as they were </p>
<p>under no pressure from Ministers to do so.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> Neither had the MOD done any work to </p>
<p>assess the cost of campaign itself. Mr Nye said that it would be useful for Mr Brown </p>
<p>to emphasise that the Treasury needed to be involved in some of the discussions </p>
<p>on military planning, to enable it “to be kept informed of the context of financial and </p>
<p>strategic decisions”.</p>
<p><b>68. </b> The Treasury informed the Inquiry that the meeting between Mr Brown and Mr Hoon </p>
<p>was one&#8209;to&#8209;one and no record was taken.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p><b>69. </b> Mr Watkins recorded the following day that Mr Hoon had, again, explained to </p>

<p><b>70. </b> A further minute from Mr Watkins stated that, at their 5 September meeting, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon and Mr Brown had agreed to “meet periodically … so that Mr Hoon could keep </p>
<p>Mr Brown in touch with our emerging thinking on the options for UK involvement in any </p>
<p>military action and the implications for UORs”.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>71. </b> On 6 September, a Treasury official sent Mr Brown a paper on the global, regional </p>
<p>and local (Iraqi) economic impact of war in Iraq.</p>
<p>61</p>
<p> The paper advised that, globally, a </p>
<p>conflict could lead to a rise in the oil price of US$10 a barrel and a consequent reduction </p>
<p>in global growth by 0.5 percentage points and a rise in inflation of between 0.4 and </p>
<p>0.8 percentage points. The paper did not consider the impact of a war on the UK </p>
<p>economy. </p>
<p><b>72. </b> The paper also considered Iraq’s post&#8209;war needs. That analysis is described later in </p>
<p>this Section. </p>
<p><b>73. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indication that Mr Brown responded to the paper. </p>
<p><b>74. </b> On 16 September, a Treasury official produced an analysis for Mr Ed Balls (Special </p>
<p>Adviser to Mr Brown), at Mr Balls’ request, on the implications of military action in Iraq </p>
<p>for UK public spending.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> The official suggested that a “central estimate” of the cost of </p>
<p>“military action” might be £2.5bn, although that could rise considerably if the campaign </p>
<p>was protracted or a large&#8209;scale occupation was required. The official also suggested </p>
<p>that the cost of reconstruction was likely to be in the order of US$9bn, in addition to </p>
<p>International Monetary Fund (IMF) and peacekeeping costs. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>458</p>
<p><b>77. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I don’t think at a macro level this intervention [Iraq] has had a significant effect </p>
<p>on spending elsewhere … I think the peak year of spending was 2003/04, which </p>
<p>was about £1.6bn. When you [the Government] are spending £500bn, £1.6bn is </p>
<p>significant and it bears a lot of attention and focus, but it is not going to divert fiscal </p>
<p>policy in a massive sense.</p>
<p>”63</p>
<p><b>78. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I think we managed to meet the requirements of Iraq and Afghanistan without </p>
<p>having to cut other services … </p>
<p>“… it did make my life more difficult, because we had to find £17bn over a period of </p>
<p>time, but we thought and believed that these [costs] were manageable, given the </p>
<p>priority that we attached to doing the things that we did.”</p>
<p>64</p>
<p><b>79. </b> The £17bn referred to by Mr Brown represented the NACMO in Iraq and </p>
<p>Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>80. </b> Mr Boateng told the Inquiry that the Treasury’s analyses of the impact of war on </p>
<p>the UK’s public finances were not conducted with the intention of “second&#8209;guessing” </p>
<p>Ministers, but to enable the Treasury to contribute to planning and policy discussions.</p>
<p>65</p>

<p><b>83. </b> On 19 September, in the context of discussions within the MOD on how to secure </p>
<p>funding for a number of critical UORs relating to potential UK Special Forces operations </p>
<p>in Iraq, the Private Office of Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary, advised </p>

<p><b>84. </b> Mr Watkins wrote to Sir David Manning on 20 September, advising that two issues </p>
<p>needed to be addressed quickly:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>what potential UK force contribution should be presented to the forthcoming US </p>
<p>Central Command (CENTCOM) planning conference the following week; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether to replace army units already allocated to Operation FRESCO</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> so that </p>
<p>they would be available if a land force contribution was approved.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p><b>85. </b> Mr Watkins advised that Mr Hoon believed that Package 2 (the air and maritime </p>
<p>package, plus Special Forces) should be presented to the conference as a potential </p>
<p>UK contribution. </p>
<p><b>86. </b> Providing a land contribution in addition to Package 2 was “more complicated”. </p>
<p>The option required further development.</p>
<p><b>87. </b> Mr Watkins wrote that Mr Hoon felt it would be “premature” to offer a land </p>
<p>contribution on the same basis as Package 2: </p>
<p>“… we should indicate to CENTCOM that we are still considering this option and that </p>
<p>they should model two plans in parallel, one including the UK land force contribution </p>
<p>and one without it.”</p>
<p><b>88. </b> Mr Blair discussed the contribution that might be offered to the US with Mr Hoon on </p>
<p>23 September (see Section 6.1). Mr Blair agreed with Mr Hoon that Package 2 could be </p>
<p>offered as a potential UK contribution but there was a misunderstanding over whether </p>
<p>the US should be informed that the UK was still considering a land option (Package 3). </p>
<p><b>89. </b> Following the meeting, Mr Watkins informed officials in the MOD that: </p>
<p>“The Prime Minister is content for us to proceed broadly as set out in my letter </p>
<p>of 20 September. The Prime Minister remains very cautious about the viability </p>
<p>of Package 3, not least because of its implications for our ability to meet other </p>
<p>contingencies and the significant cost premium entailed.”</p>

<p><b>90. </b> In his diaries, Mr Campbell described a meeting between Mr Brown and Mr Blair </p>

<p> Mr Campbell wrote that Mr Blair had reported that Mr Brown “was </p>
<p>basically just saying we could not afford a military conflict and making clear he had to </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>460</p>
<p><b>91. </b> There is no official note of the meeting and none of the witnesses referred to it in </p>
<p>their evidence to the Inquiry.</p>
<p><b>92. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Hoon met separately on 23 September to agree the process for </p>
<p>funding UORs for Iraq.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>93. </b> Before the meeting, Mr Hoon was advised by Mr Guy Lester, MOD Director </p>
<p>Defence Resources and Plans, that it would make sense to use the arrangements in </p>
<p>place for Afghanistan: Ministers would agree a “ceiling” on UOR expenditure, within </p>
<p>which Treasury officials could authorise expenditure on individual requests without </p>
<p>seeking approval from Treasury Ministers.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> The MOD expected the first and most </p>
<p>urgent tranche of UORs to cost £150m. </p>
<p><b>94. </b> Mr Watkins commented on that advice:</p>
<p>“We are told that Treasury officials are happy [to use the Afghanistan model], but </p>
<p>Mr Brown may want to clear them [UOR requests] individually himself. This would </p>
<p>create a major bureaucratic bottleneck.”</p>
<p>73</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Mr Watkins’ record of the 23 September meeting stated that Mr Brown’s “initial line” </p>
<p>was that he should approve each UOR individually, but “Mr Hoon persuaded him that </p>
<p>this would not be practical or sensible”.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>96. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Brown on 25 September, to confirm their agreement that the </p>
<p>MOD would adopt a similar approach to managing Iraq UORs to that already in place for </p>
<p>Afghanistan UORs, with an initial ceiling of £150m.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> MOD and Treasury officials were </p>
<p>tasked to work out the detailed arrangements. </p>
<p><b>97. </b> In response to a request from Mr Brown on “how to handle future requests for Iraq </p>
<p>UOR funding”, a Treasury official wrote to Mr Bowman on 8 October 2002, describing </p>
<p>how a UOR arrangement might operate and how the Treasury might “reduce the UOR </p>
<p>bill” by arguing that UORs were in fact generic enhancements of military capability, </p>
<p>and by ensuring that the MOD had not already planned to procure items presented </p>
<p>as UORs.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>98. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence that Mr Brown had asked for advice on the </p>
<p>specific question of how to reduce the UOR bill. </p>

<p><b>99. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that all the MOD’s claims for UORs had been met.</p>
<p>77</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He also explained that the “ceiling” was not a limit on UOR expenditure, but an estimate </p>
<p>of likely expenditure:</p>
<p>“At all times we said, ‘Here is the money … Once you have spent that, then we are </p>
<p>prepared – and always were ready to and actually did – deliver more.’” </p>
<p><b>100. </b> Mr Tom McKane, MOD Director General Resources and Plans from September </p>
<p>2002 to January 2006, who was responsible for establishing the arrangements for </p>
<p>securing funding for UORs in the period leading up to the invasion, told the Inquiry that </p>
<p>he was satisfied with the Treasury’s response to the MOD’s requests for UORs:</p>
<p>“Inevitably … there is an anxiety and a concern on the part of the Ministry of </p>
<p>Defence to get on with things … and it did take a month or so after my first </p>
<p>engagement in this for the agreements [on UORs] to be reached … But thereafter, </p>
<p>the process operated smoothly. </p>
<p>“There were some, I think, who were probably frustrated at the fact … that we were </p>
<p>given tranches of money … we would get quite quickly to the point where we had </p>
<p>exhausted the first tranche and were then involved in the preparation of ministerial </p>
<p>correspondence to secure the release of the next tranche …</p>
<p>“… but I don’t remember it [the use of tranches] being a major obstacle to the </p>
<p>preparations.”</p>
<p>78</p>
<p><b>101. </b> The provision of military equipment, including UORs, is described in Sections 6.3 </p>
<p>and 14.</p>
<p><b>102. </b> Mr Nye advised Mr Brown on 11 October that Mr Hoon was expected to write to </p>
<p>Mr Blair shortly, setting out the military forces required for a campaign.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> The Treasury </p>
<p>had now established good communications with the MOD, and MOD officials had </p>
<p>assured the Treasury that Mr Blair would be presented with “cost information”. </p>
<p><b>103. </b> While there were still huge uncertainties involved in forecasting costs, the MOD </p>
<p>had provided the Treasury with “some indicative breakdowns” which the Treasury was </p>
<p>scrutinising. The MOD estimated that Package 2 (predominantly air and maritime forces) </p>
<p>was likely to cost up to £1bn, and Package 3 (Package 2 plus ground forces) between </p>
<p>£1.5bn and £2bn. </p>
<p><b>104. </b> Mr Nye invited Mr Brown to “consider whether the extra political impact for the UK </p>
<p>of Package 3 merits the additional £0.5bn to £1bn cost (and of course the additional risk </p>
<p>to British troops)”. </p>

<p><b>105. </b> Mr Nye also identified the need to consider long&#8209;term, post&#8209;conflict military </p>
<p>costs. The US appeared to envisage a “quite lengthy occupation/reconstruction effort”. </p>
<p>Mr Nye commented: </p>
<p>“Although some in the MOD hope that British participation in the original conflict </p>
<p>would exempt us from having to play a large role in the subsequent peacekeeping … </p>
<p>this is not realistic … the UK may well face a situation like Kosovo, having to be </p>
<p>involved in policing an occupied country post conflict: possibly £0.5 billion a year … </p>
<p>for several years.”</p>
<p><b>106. </b> Mr Nye concluded: “If you want to influence the Prime Minister [Mr Blair] in </p>
<p>considering the scale of the UK commitment, you should talk to him next week.”</p>
<p><b>107. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 15 October, seeking a decision that week on whether </p>
<p>the US should be offered Package 3 on the same basis as Package 2, as a possible </p>

<p>80</p>
<p> Mr Hoon stated that Package 2 was likely to cost up to </p>
<p>£1bn and Package 3 between £1.5bn and £2bn. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> An MOD paper attached to Mr Hoon’s minute stated that the larger the UK’s </p>
<p>contribution to military action in the war&#8209;fighting phase, the “more plausibly we will be </p>
<p>able to argue that we have done our bit”. It also stated that the MOD could not yet </p>
<p>estimate the cost of all the components of a campaign: the cost estimates provided </p>
<p>in the paper were therefore “ball&#8209;park figures”. </p>

<p>“… if we help with the war fighting, we shall be spared the post&#8209;conflict washing </p>
<p>up. It didn’t work like that in Afghanistan. Experience shows that once you’re in, </p>
<p>you’re in deep, without queues of grateful countries waiting to take over when the </p>

<p>82</p>
<p> Mr Rycroft recorded that Mr Blair acknowledged the arguments in favour of </p>
<p>Package 3, but:</p>
<p>“… remained concerned about costs. He concluded that he wanted to keep open the </p>
<p>option of Package 3. But we must not commit to it at this stage.” </p>
<p><b>113. </b> Mr Campbell wrote in his diaries that at that meeting, Mr Blair said “it was not no, </p>

<p><b>114. </b> On 22 October Mr Jon Cunliffe, Treasury Managing Director for Macroeconomic </p>
<p>Policy and International Finance, sent Mr Brown a paper on the risks to the Treasury’s </p>
<p>objectives arising from a war in Iraq.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p> Mr Cunliffe identified nine main risks and </p>
<p>assessed the likelihood and impact of each in four scenarios: no war; a short war; </p>
<p>a protracted war; and a war involving weapons of mass destruction (WMD). </p>
<p><b>115. </b> The nine main risks were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a substantial rise in public spending;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lower growth, higher inflation and unemployment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>negative productivity shock;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>public finances less sound;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>inflation deviates from target;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>loss of insurance capacity/risk of insurance failures;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>more IMF lending leading to higher UK gross debt;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>revival of popular pressure for lower fuel taxes; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>developing countries knocked by oil prices, leading to lower growth. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> On public spending, Mr Cunliffe assessed that indirect costs could more than </p>
<p>double the direct costs. In the protracted war and WMD scenarios, the impact of a </p>
<p>worsening economy on AME could match the military costs.</p>
<p><b>117. </b> In his covering minute, Mr Cunliffe advised that the Treasury’s main concern </p>
<p>related to its “ability to maintain sound public finances, especially in the more pessimistic </p>
<p>cases”. There would be some risk to the “Golden Rule” in all three war scenarios; the </p>
<p>risk would be much greater if a war involved WMD. Mr Cunliffe concluded by suggesting </p>
<p>that Mr Brown might want to warn colleagues about the risk to public finances.</p>

<p>464</p>
<p><b>119. </b> On 31 October, Mr Blair, Mr Straw, Mr Hoon and Adm Boyce discussed the MOD’s </p>
<p>wish to offer Package 3 to the US for planning purposes.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p> Mr Blair asked about the </p>
<p>additional costs associated with Package 3 and whether they had been discussed with </p>
<p>the Treasury. Adm Boyce said that he believed that:</p>
<p>“… if we [the UK] made a major financial contribution to the campaign through </p>
<p>Package 3, we would be under less pressure to finance a big share of the </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict reconstruction effort.” </p>
<p><b>120. </b> The record of the meeting does not indicate whether Mr Blair’s question about </p>
<p>the costs of Package 3, and whether they had been discussed with the Treasury, </p>
<p>was answered. </p>
<p><b>121. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the MOD should tell the US that the UK was prepared to </p>
<p>“put Package 3 on the same basis as Package 2 for planning purposes”.</p>
<p><b>122. </b> A copy of the record of the meeting was sent to Mr Bowman. </p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr John Dodds, who had replaced Mr Nye as Head of the Treasury Defence, </p>
<p>Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, advised Mr Brown on 8 November 2002 that the </p>
<p>Treasury’s “instinct” was that Package 3 would cost £2.5bn, rather than the £1.5bn </p>
<p>to £2bn estimated by the MOD.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> That did not include any “follow&#8209;on” cost, such as </p>
<p>peacekeeping or reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>124. </b> Mr Brown received advice from a Treasury official on 17 November on whether to </p>
<p>create an allocation in the Pre&#8209;Budget Report (PBR) to cover the cost of military action in </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p> The main advantage would be to enable the Treasury to set out, in a transparent </p>
<p>way, the exceptional additional costs of military action, above the underlying state of </p>
<p>public finances. </p>
<p><b>125. </b> The allocation would cover the cost of military action in Iraq and the further costs of </p>
<p>military occupation and/or a contribution to a stabilisation force. The official added that if </p>
<p>Mr Brown was attracted to the idea of making such an allocation, it might be expanded </p>
<p>to cover some of the existing costs relating to the war against terror. </p>
<p><b>126. </b> The official also advised that, based on informal discussions with MOD officials, the </p>
<p>military costs relating to “occupation and/or a stabilisation force” could be up to £1bn in </p>
<p>the first year and up to £500m a year thereafter. The official commented: </p>
<p>“From this it’s clear that any future decision on a UK role in post&#8209;conflict Iraq should </p>
<p>properly factor in the potential costs.” </p>

<p><b>127. </b> Mr Brown telephoned Mr Hoon on 27 November, to inform him that he would be </p>
<p>making an allocation of £1bn in his PBR for “Defence issues”.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> Mr Brown reassured </p>
<p>Mr Hoon that this was not an upper limit on expenditure, but rather a “purely nominal </p>
<p>figure: it was neither an upper or lower limit”. The usual process for securing funding </p>
<p>from the Reserve would stand. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> Mr Brown announced to Parliament later that day that the Government had “set </p>
<p>aside to meet our international defence responsibilities a provision of £1 billion to be </p>
<p>drawn on if necessary”.</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>129. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that the decision to create a Special </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>466</p>
<p>reconsider his position that non&#8209;UOR NACMO should be contained within the </p>
<p>UOR ceiling. </p>
<p><b>135. </b> Mr Hoon attached a spreadsheet showing the MOD’s actual and estimated costs </p>
<p>(to April 2003) for “Iraq contingency planning”, which totalled £1.65bn. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> Copies of Mr Hoon’s letter were sent to Mr Blair and Mr Straw.</p>
<p><b>137. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Brown on 17 December that he should agree both </p>
<p>of Mr Hoon’s requests.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> On UOR costs, the official advised:</p>
<p>“Some of this [UOR] spending is arguably for equipment that would have been </p>
<p>bought anyway later … We should stress that in such cases we will claim back </p>
<p>by either docking MOD’s EYF, or reducing their Estimates accordingly next year.”</p>
<p><b>138. </b> On non&#8209;UOR NACMO, the official advised that if preparations were to move </p>
<p>forward on the track agreed by Mr Hoon and Mr Blair, access to the Reserve was </p>
<p>necessary. Preparing a force would cost about £650m and maintaining it at a state of </p>
<p>readiness about £200m a month, whether the UK went to war or not. The official advised </p>
<p>Mr Brown that the Treasury should put in place arrangements “that keep the costs </p>
<p>clearly on the agenda”, and that Mr Brown should ask Mr Hoon for monthly reports on </p>
<p>current and planned activities. Those reports would provide the basis for “ongoing joint </p>
<p>consideration of the costs of the strategy”. </p>
<p><b>139. </b> The official also advised that the £1.65bn figure represented the cost if the military </p>
<p>operation was “cancelled end of March, clear up and go home in April”. The costs </p>
<p>of war&#8209;fighting, missiles and ammunition, and “post&#8209;conflict stabilisation” would be </p>
<p>additional. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Hoon telephoned Mr Boateng on 23 December to discuss access to the </p>
<p>Reserve.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary reported to MOD officials that Mr Boateng </p>
<p>had said that any system needed to meet the MOD’s needs, take account of “broader </p>
<p>financial implications”, and enable the Treasury to identify clearly that costs were </p>
<p>genuinely additional. </p>
<p><b>141. </b> Mr Boateng wrote to Mr Hoon later that day.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p> Mr Boateng agreed to increase the </p>
<p>ceiling for UORs by £200m, to £500m. With regard to non&#8209;UOR NACMO, Mr Boateng </p>
<p>stated that access to the Reserve was usually only granted once an operation had </p>
<p>been “declared”. In the current “preparatory phase”, he offered to create a “distinct </p>
<p>envelope for build&#8209;up costs”, with four specific Heads of Expenditure (operation&#8209;specific </p>
<p>training; air/sea charter; spares, maintenance and logistics; and other infrastructure </p>
<p>elements), with an initial allocation of £500m. The Treasury would authorise and monitor </p>
<p>expenditure within those Heads of Expenditure, rather than as a single block. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>468</p>
<p><b>153. </b> Mr McKane advised that the cost of military combat operations, including “repairs, </p>
<p>replenishment and reconfiguration”, could be between £2.5bn and £3bn. </p>
<p><b>154. </b> Mr McKane also provided the MOD’s “outline ‘first thoughts’ projection” of the cost </p>
<p>of maintaining a military presence in post&#8209;conflict Iraq. Mr McKane advised that the </p>
<p>MOD had not yet been assigned “firm tasks” for the post&#8209;conflict period and that the </p>
<p>size and type of forces required would depend on US plans. With that caveat, the MOD </p>
<p>estimated that UK forces might be required for 30 months at a cost of £2.3bn (including </p>
<p>a six&#8209;month deployment of HQ Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), but excluding </p>
<p>UORs related to military post&#8209;conflict tasks). </p>
<p><b>155. </b> On 19 February, in advance of meetings with Mr John Snow, the US Secretary of </p>
<p>the Treasury, and other G7 finance Ministers, Mr Brown received a number of papers </p>
<p>on Iraq.</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>156. </b> A paper by Mr Dodds and a junior Treasury official provided the first </p>
<p>comprehensive estimate of the cost of the UK’s intervention in Iraq (including military </p>
<p>and non&#8209;military, conflict and post&#8209;conflict costs).</p>
<p>106</p>
<p> The advice on non&#8209;military costs </p>
<p>is described later in this Section. </p>
<p><b>157. </b> The officials advised that the Treasury’s best estimate of the cost of UK military </p>
<p>combat operations was now £3bn over the three financial years from 2002/03, with an </p>
<p>associated £400m in RAB costs over the three financial years from 2003/04. The MOD’s </p>
<p>estimate remained lower: the Treasury doubted that the MOD had shared with it the full </p>
<p>cost of replacing and restocking armaments and equipment used in a conflict. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> The officials advised that the Treasury was “now starting to get some sense” from </p>
<p>the MOD on the cost of post&#8209;conflict peacekeeping/stabilisation. While no decision had </p>
<p>yet been taken on whether to contribute UK forces after a conflict:</p>
<p>“In practice once we are on the ground, unless contributions from other nations are </p>
<p>available the political pressure to stay will be intense.”</p>
<p><b>159. </b> There were a number of ways that an “occupation … force” might be organised. </p>
<p>The “biggest commitment, and hence the most expensive” would be if the UK became </p>
<p>responsible for a particular geographical sector. The Treasury’s estimate reflected that </p>
<p>commitment. </p>
<p><b>160. </b> The MOD had not yet provided firm estimates for how much such an occupation </p>
<p>force (including responsibility for a geographical sector) might cost. Internal Treasury </p>
<p>work suggested £500m in 2003/04 and £1bn in 2004/05 (in addition to the cost of </p>
<p>military combat operations). </p>

<p>469</p>
<p><b>161. </b> Mr Brown also received a minute from Mr Dodds which highlighted the potential </p>
<p>implications of the UK taking overall responsibility for a geographical sector in Iraq: </p>
<p>“This is a decision that will have substantial public expenditure implications. </p>
<p>If there were a UK sector we would find ourselves locked into the management of </p>
<p>the aftermath for a substantial period (perhaps as long as five years) rather than </p>
<p>allowing other countries – who will not have borne any costs of the conflict itself – </p>
<p>to make their contribution. The net additional cost to the UK is difficult to quantify but </p>
<p>would certainly be hundreds of millions of pounds a year.”</p>
<p>107</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>162. </b> Mr Dodds added that there were other reasons why a UK sector would be </p>
<p>unattractive. The need to bring in expertise from the widest possible range of sources </p>
<p>and to avoid the perception that the UK was occupying “part of the Arab world” argued </p>
<p>for a more internationalist approach. </p>
<p><b>163. </b> Mr Dodds advised that Treasury officials were taking every opportunity to stress to </p>
<p>FCO and MOD colleagues that Mr Brown would want to have an input to any decision </p>
<p>on sectorisation, and recommended that Mr Brown underline that point himself with </p>
<p>Mr Blair, Mr Straw and Mr Hoon.</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Boateng received a further update on military costs from a </p>
<p>Treasury official the following day.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p> The official reported that the Treasury now had the </p>
<p>MOD’s first estimates of the likely total cost of conflict in Iraq “if a decision is made to </p>
<p>stay … and provide a medium term stabilisation/peace keeping force”. The upper limit, </p>
<p>based on what was feasible in military terms, was a two&#8209;year commitment at a total cost </p>
<p>of £1.6bn. The official commented:</p>
<p>“The extent to which any of this is optional is unclear. We think that, because of our </p>
<p>Geneva convention obligations, it will be impossible to resist keeping a substantial </p>
<p>force in theatre for at least six months post the end of fighting … In practice </p>
<p>the emerging politics of a post&#8209;conflict Iraq point to a much more substantial </p>
<p>commitment both in terms of size and length of stay.” </p>
<p><b>165. </b> On 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post&#8209;conflict issues with Mr Brown, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon, Ms Clare Short (the International Development Secretary), Baroness Symons </p>
<p>(joint FCO/DTI Minister of State for International Trade and Investment, representing </p>

<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>167. </b> Mr Dominick Chilcott, the Head of the IPU from February 2003 to June 2004, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry that there was: </p>
<p>“… a great deal of hesitancy within Whitehall about the concept of a British sector </p>
<p>mainly because of the resources that would be involved in making a success of it </p>
<p>… the Treasury and DFID both expressing, for slightly different reasons, hesitancy </p>
<p>about the assumption that there would be a British sector.”</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>168. </b> Mr Brown received a number of papers from Treasury officials before the meeting.</p>
<p><b>169. </b> A paper produced by Mr Dodds highlighted the financial implications of the </p>
<p>assumption in “US/UK military planning” that UK forces would take responsibility for </p>
<p>an area of Iraq after the conflict.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>170. </b> Mr Dodds advised that the Chiefs of Staff had estimated that the UK could sustain </p>
<p>a brigade and headquarters (around 10,000 troops) in Iraq indefinitely, and that this force </p>
<p>would be sufficient to fulfil the UK responsibilities for Basra Province. </p>
<p><b>171. </b> Mr Dodds advised that the cost of such an ongoing operation was likely to be </p>
<p>about £1bn a year. It was a reasonable assumption that the UK’s commitment would last </p>
<p>“at least two years and possibly significantly longer”. He continued: </p>
<p>“We have pressed MOD on how these costs might be reduced. The options are:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>to tell the US that we feel we have played our part after Phase IVA [immediate </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict stabilisation] and that other coalition partners must be found to </p>
<p>take on our role …;</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>to give up the leadership role and to contribute a small component to the </p>
<p>leadership of others;</p>
<p>c. </p>
<p>to lead a sector … with a range of forces drawn from other countries.</p>
<p>To keep cost to a minimum, we should scale down our commitments as rapidly as </p>
<p>possible.”</p>
<p><b>172. </b> Mr Dodds summarised his arguments:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>On public finance grounds there is a strong case for stepping back from military </p>
<p>leadership in the aftermath and allowing other countries to take on this role.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If Ministers want Britain to continue to be in a leadership position there will be </p>
<p>significant costs …</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>There are risks that our taking on military leadership will result in our being </p>
<p>sucked into wider responsibilities for reconstruction with even higher costs.” </p>
<p><b>173. </b> Mr Dodds told the Inquiry why he had written that paper: </p>
<p>“… I think we had a specific request … from the Chancellor’s Office for a piece of </p>
<p>advice on the aftermath and I think what had happened was that it had become </p>
<p>clear, quite suddenly really, to the Chancellor … to the Treasury, that there was </p>
<p>a set of options being considered for the role that the UK [military] might play … </p>
<p>in Phase IV …”</p>
<p>113</p>
<p><b>174. </b> Mr Dodds told the Inquiry that the Treasury’s earlier work had focused on the major </p>
<p>conflict phase of operations, using a three&#8209;year planning framework. However:</p>
<p>“… it suddenly became clear to us … if we had been wiser, we might have kind of </p>
<p>anticipated this, but it was a bit of a surprise … that there were discussions going on </p>
<p>between parts of the UK Government and others around the role that the UK might </p>
<p>play, which had the potential to see us in Iraq for significantly longer than we had </p>
<p>been initially supposing. </p>
<p>“… the Treasury wasn’t in the loop before early … March, around this thinking, and </p>
<p>…. when this thinking emerged, there … appeared to have been an assumption </p>
<p>on behalf of some other parts of government that this was another thing where … </p>
<p>the Treasury would just sign the cheques … without being involved in the strategic </p>
<p>decision.”</p>
<p><b>175. </b> Mr Brown also received a paper from a Treasury official on the potential impact </p>
<p>of all military and non&#8209;military expenditure in Iraq on public expenditure.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> The best </p>
<p>estimate of the cost of UK military combat operations was £3.1bn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maintaining a </p>
<p>“medium&#8209;term stabilisation/peace&#8209;keeping force” might cost up to £1bn a year for </p>
<p>two years. The official advised that: </p>
<p>“… whilst the costs of the actual fighting are now pretty inescapable <i><b>we still </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>have a window of opportunity to exert some influence over the scale of this </b></i></p>

<p>116</p>
<p><b>Cash contributions to Operation GRANBY </b></p>
<p>There was precedent for approaching other governments to contribute to UK military </p>
<p>costs. Other governments pledged over £2bn to the UK to cover the costs incurred on </p>
<p>Operation GRANBY, the UK contribution to the international response to Iraq’s invasion </p>
<p>of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>117</p>
<p> The cost of Op GRANBY was some £2.5bn. </p>
<p><b>178. </b> Treasury officials advised Mr Boateng on 14 March that the MOD’s estimate for </p>
<p>infrastructure costs within the NACMO envelope included £10m for: </p>
<p>“CIMIC – Civilian&#8209;Military co&#8209;operation. This spend is for force protection with the </p>

<p>14 January 2011 statement to the Inquiry. He wrote that, on funding:</p>
<p>“… the Chancellor [Mr Brown] had throughout made it clear resources would not </p>
<p>be an obstacle. The Treasury had made certain calculations of the cost both of the </p>
<p>initial action and the aftermath. The Chancellor was present at Cabinet meetings in </p>
<p>the run&#8209;up to the conflict. Throughout he made it clear resource was not a constraint. </p>
<p>Subsequently he was part of the War Cabinet. Of course the Treasury queried and </p>
<p>questioned costings. They always did. But at no point did anyone say to me: the </p>
<p>Treasury are stopping us doing what need. So I see in evidence to the Inquiry that </p>
<p>resource issues were being raised with some frustration by officials. I can only say </p>
<p>that had such frustrations been raised with me, I would have acted on them and </p>
<p>I believe the Chancellor would have been fully supportive.”</p>

<p>economic impact of “war” in Iraq on 6 September 2002.</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> The official’s analysis of the </p>
<p>global economic impact of war is described earlier in this Section. </p>
<p><b>184. </b> As part of his analysis of the local (Iraqi) economic impact, the official assessed </p>
<p>the contribution that the IMF, the World Bank, bilateral donors, the UN and the Paris </p>
<p>Club (through debt relief) had made to meeting the “post&#8209;war challenge” in the Federal </p>
<p>Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), East Timor and Afghanistan, under five headings: </p>
<p>reconstruction; institution&#8209;building; economic stabilisation; economic transition; and </p>
<p>peacekeeping. </p>
<p><b>185. </b> The official concluded that the cost of “putting a country back on its feet” could </p>
<p>be high. The FRY had already received US$10bn in support (excluding IMF support). </p>
<p>Iraq could be “even more expensive”, given:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the possibility that a conflict could cause significant damage, and the existing </p>
<p>poor state of Iraq’s infrastructure;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the need to stabilise the economy, including by addressing Iraq’s huge external </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>the need for a large peace&#8209;keeping force “to keep a lid on the ethnic and </p>
<p>religious tensions that Saddam’s dictatorship has hidden for so long”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the pressure for a “generous [reconstruction] package, given the perception </p>
<p>in the region that invading Iraq is of dubious legality and worth”.</p>
<p><b>186. </b> On who would pay for that generous package, the official assessed that: </p>
<p>“… the US might expect Iraq to pick up the bill after a short ‘bridging’ period, </p>
<p>especially as – with investment – oil revenues could quickly exceed US$20 billion </p>
<p>per year.</p>
<p>“But it is more likely that strong pressure will come to bear on the US and its allies </p>
<p>to pay the lion’s share, given their role in the war …”</p>
<p><b>187. </b> The official did not consider what the UK’s contribution to meeting post&#8209;war costs </p>
<p>might be. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> The Inquiry has seen no evidence that Mr Brown responded to this analysis, or that </p>
<p>it was circulated outside the Treasury. </p>
<p><b>189. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that the Treasury was among the first to consider the </p>
<p>challenges involved in reconstruction.</p>

<p><b>190. </b> From 20 September 2002, the Ad Hoc Group on Iraq (AHGI) co&#8209;ordinated all </p>
<p>non&#8209;military cross&#8209;government work on post&#8209;conflict issues (see Section 6.4). The AHGI </p>
<p>was chaired by the Cabinet Office. </p>
<p><b>191. </b> Mr Alistair Fernie, Head of DFID’s Middle East and North Africa Department, </p>
<p>circulated a draft paper on the potential humanitarian implications of conflict in Iraq to </p>
<p>members of the AHGI on 11 October, with the caveat that the paper had not yet been </p>
<p>seen by Ms Short or other departments.</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>192. </b> The draft paper stated that:</p>
<p>“Any large&#8209;scale UK humanitarian response would require additional funding from </p>
<p>the Central Reserve. DFID’s existing small (£6m) humanitarian programme in Iraq </p>
<p>is fully committed; available humanitarian funds within CHAD [DFID’s Conflict and </p>

<p>resource and monetary capacity of many agencies and donors.” </p>
<p><b>194. </b> Mr Fernie’s minute was copied to the Private Office of Mr Suma Chakrabarti, </p>

<p>inclusion of an explicit reference to DFID’s lack of financial resources to cover the </p>
<p>humanitarian contingencies considered in the paper.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>196. </b> Ms Short held a meeting with DFID officials on 18 November to discuss Iraq.</p>
<p>128</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ms Anna Bewes, Ms Short’s Private Secretary, recorded that the meeting had agreed </p>
<p>that it would be important to cost each military option, including both military and </p>
<p>“realistic humanitarian” costs. Ms Short was concerned that not only was no money set </p>
<p>aside for humanitarian activity, but the issue was not even being considered. </p>
<p><b>197. </b> Mr Fernie set out his understanding of Ms Short’s concern in an email to DFID </p>
<p>colleagues the following week: </p>
<p>“… HMT [the Treasury] have been talking to MOD only about the military </p>
<p>costs without taking into account the costs to the international community of </p>
<p>any humanitarian response, post&#8209;Saddam transitional administration and/or </p>
<p>reconstruction … The SoS [Ms Short] is particularly keen to make clear that DFID </p>
<p>cannot find substantial funds for any such work from our existing budgets.” </p>
<p>“We [DFID] are trying to cobble together some figures of possible costs – all a </p>
<p>bit speculative … but the point at this stage is to get others in Whitehall thinking </p>
<p>about it.”</p>
<p>129</p>
<p><b>198. </b> On 3 December, Mr Fernie reported to Dr Nicola Brewer, DFID Director General </p>
<p>Regional Programmes, that there had been no progress in interesting the Cabinet Office </p>
<p>or the Treasury in costing “various scenarios”.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> Mr Jim Drummond, Assistant Head </p>
<p>(Foreign Affairs) of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat (OD Sec), and </p>
<p>the AHGI had both given a “clearly negative response”. The “Cabinet Office line” was </p>
<p>that if DFID thought it would incur unaffordable extra costs, it should bid to the Treasury. </p>
<p>Mr Dodds had expressed some concern over international burden&#8209;sharing, but had </p>
<p>shown “little interest” in Ms Short’s concerns and had thought that there would be “no </p>
<p>appetite” in the Treasury for producing “Whitehall&#8209;wide” costings. DFID’s Conflict and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>

<p>Humanitarian Affairs Department (CHAD) was working up preliminary costings, but had </p>
<p>“no consumer for this product”. </p>
<p><b>199. </b> Mr Fernie asked Dr Brewer for her advice on how to proceed:</p>
<p>“Do we need to take this up at a higher level in CO [the Cabinet Office] or HMT </p>
<p>[the Treasury]? Or do as CO says and start circulating some large&#8209;ish figures </p>
<p>around Whitehall?” </p>
<p><b>200. </b> Dr Brewer replied on 5 December.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> She advised that she had spoken to </p>
<p>Mr Peter Ricketts, the FCO Political Director, who had been:</p>
<p>“… slightly more willing to acknowledge that the likely costs … should be factored </p>
<p>into the decision&#8209;making process. But I got no sense at all that the FCO would either </p>
<p>push for this or support us in doing so. Their sense is that the Prime Minister’s mind </p>
<p>will be made up by other factors.”</p>
<p><b>201. </b> Dr Brewer suggested that the issue could be raised by Mr Chakrabarti with </p>
<p>Sir David Manning and Permanent Secretaries, or by Ms Short at Cabinet. </p>
<p><b>202. </b> DFID officials reported the lack of progress to Ms Short on 10 December.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ms Short agreed that officials should raise US and DFID cost estimates at the next </p>
<p>AHGI, and directed that DFID officials should intensify discussions with the Treasury </p>
<p>on costings. </p>
<p><b>203. </b> There is no reference to a discussion on this issue in the records of the </p>
<p>13 December 2002 and 10 January 2003 meetings of the AHGI.</p>
<p>133</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>204. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that DFID raised this issue again. </p>
<p><b>205. </b> In mid&#8209;December 2002, a DFID official advised Ms Short that the MOD did not </p>
<p>seem to have recognised that, for a period after any conflict, the UK military would “find </p>
<p>themselves in the frontline in caring for injured and vulnerable civilian populations”.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The military would need to be resourced to fulfil this responsibility. Dr Brewer said that </p>
<p>she would speak to the MOD. </p>
<p><b>206. </b> At the end of December 2002, the focus of the Chiefs of Staff and UK military </p>
<p>planners switched from northern to southern Iraq, creating a contingent liability that the </p>

<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>477</p>
<p><b>208. </b> Ms Short said that work on post&#8209;conflict issues needed to be taken forward </p>
<p>urgently and emphasised the need for extra resources, the potential effect of chemical </p>
<p>and biological weapons on civilians and the importance of involving the UN. </p>
<p><b>209. </b> Summarising the discussion, Mr Blair said that the “priorities for the immediate </p>
<p>future” included preparatory work on planning the aftermath of any military action. </p>
<p><b>210. </b> On 21 January, at Ms Short’s request, Mr Fernie provided advice on “how to </p>
<p>maximise the chances of securing additional funding from the Treasury to cover the </p>
<p>costs of [a] DFID humanitarian response”.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>211. </b> Mr Fernie recommended that Ms Short should speak, rather than write, to </p>
<p>Mr Brown. A letter would invite a formal response, and Treasury officials were likely </p>
<p>to caution Mr Brown against providing any broad assurance on funding and might </p>
<p>recommend that DFID “unpick” its 2003/04 spending plan, to be agreed shortly, in </p>
<p>order to provide more funding for Iraq. </p>
<p><b>212. </b> Mr Fernie continued:</p>
<p>“Mr [Mark] Lowcock’s [DFID Director Finance and Corporate Performance] advice </p>
<p>is that the best time to extract maximum funds from the central Reserve is when </p>
<p>the political pressure is at its height. We might guess that such a time will come in </p>
<p>a month or so – by which time budgets for our existing programmes would be more </p>
<p>secure, with our 2003/04 framework finalised and on its way to publication.”</p>
<p><b>213. </b> Ms Short commented: No – I don’t want to ring Ch X [the Chancellor of the </p>
<p>Exchequer] … I wanted to put humanitarian considerations into Gov[ernment] mind not </p>
<p>just to squeeze some money.”</p>
<p>137</p>
<p> Rather than write or speak to Mr Brown, she would </p>
<p>write to Mr Blair. That letter was sent on 5 February.</p>
<p><b>214. </b> Ms Short described DFID’s preparations to respond to a humanitarian crisis in Iraq </p>
<p>in the House of Commons on 30 January.</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Ms Short’s briefing for the debate included, at her request, a figure for the </p>
<p>UK’s “responsibility within the international system” for contributing to humanitarian </p>
<p>relief efforts.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> The briefing stated that the UK’s Gross National Income (GNI) was </p>
<p>5.5 percent of the total GNI of members of the Organisation for Economic Co&#8209;operation </p>
<p>and Development (OECD) in 2000. The UK would not expect to contribute much more </p>
<p>than that percentage to any international humanitarian relief effort.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>478</p>
<p><b>216. </b> During the debate, Ms Short reported that the US had committed to fund in full the </p>
<p>recent UN appeal for US$137m to enable UN agencies to prepare their responses to a </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis.</p>
<p>139</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>217. </b> In response to a question from Mr Crispin Blunt about the resources available to </p>
<p>DFID, Ms Short stated that:</p>
<p>“… the UK’s contribution to any humanitarian crisis throughout the world, as </p>
<p>determined by the Organisation for Economic Co&#8209;operation and Development, </p>
<p>is just over 5 percent – that is all.” </p>
<p>Ms Short continued: </p>
<p>“… my department’s budget has virtually doubled since 1997, but is under strain … </p>
<p>We have a Contingency Reserve and Iraq would be prioritised. However, I have just </p>
<p>been in Africa, where there is a real fear about resources being taken away from </p>
<p>southern Africa, the horn of Africa, the Afghan people, the West Bank and Gaza – </p>
<p>that would be wrong and we would not contemplate it. We will play our part in the </p>
<p>international system, but the department is not flush with resources – I must frankly </p>
<p>warn the House that they are short.”</p>
<p><b>218. </b> On 31 January, a DFID official provided advice to Ms Short, at her request, on how </p>
<p>much the UK might be expected to contribute to “humanitarian relief/reconstruction” in </p>
<p>Iraq in the event of military action.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>219. </b> The official provided a draft DFID paper which considered in detail Iraq’s possible </p>
<p>post&#8209;war needs under a number of scenarios. The paper used current Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food </p>
<p>(OFF) programme expenditure plans as a “benchmark” for a future humanitarian and </p>
<p>reconstruction programme, and then considered how those plans would be affected </p>
<p>by a number of factors including the nature of any conflict, the availability of Iraqi oil </p>
<p>revenues, and how Iraq’s external debt and reparation claims would be resolved. </p>
<p><b>220. </b> The official advised that FCO and Treasury officials had seen an earlier draft of </p>
<p>the paper, and that the Treasury was using roughly similar figures in assessing the total </p>
<p>cost to the UK of military engagement in Iraq (an issue in which there was increased </p>
<p>Ministerial interest).</p>
<p><b>221. </b> In her covering minute, the official summarised the main conclusions of the paper:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Total humanitarian costs could reach US$12bn in the first year after any conflict, </p>
<p>if the OFF programme collapsed.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>479</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction could cost between US$2bn and US$10bn a year over a two to </p>
<p>three&#8209;year period, depending on the impact of the military conflict, the level of </p>
<p>forgiveness secured on debt and other claims, and oil revenues. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>If the UK provided 5.6 percent</p>
<p>141</p>
<p> of the total humanitarian/reconstruction costs </p>
<p>(in line with the UK’s share of OECD GNI), the UK’s contribution to “total </p>
<p>humanitarian/reconstruction costs” could reach US$640m (£400m) a year for </p>
<p>the next three years, under a “high case military/low case oil revenue scenario”.</p>
<p><b>222. </b> The draft paper stated that DFID had, ‘‘traditionally’ (Balkans/Afghanistan)”, </p>
<p>contributed between eight and 10 percent of total relief/reconstruction costs. On that </p>
<p>basis, under a high case military/low oil revenue scenario, the UK contribution could </p>
<p>be in excess of US$1bn a year.<b> </b></p>
<p><b>223. </b> The official also provided advice on how to raise awareness across the UK </p>
<p>Government about the potential costs of a major humanitarian operation, “without </p>
<p>committing DFID’s budget at this stage or jeopardising other programmes”.</p>
<p><b>224. </b> The official recommended that DFID should continue to discuss funding with other </p>
<p>departments at official level, but seek to postpone discussions on the detailed financial </p>
<p>implications for DFID until its 2003/04 spending plans had been agreed. DFID’s Iraq </p>
<p>team and DFID’s Finance Department would continue to work closely together “on </p>
<p>tactics to avoid early discussion about the implications [of a UK contribution] for DFID’s </p>
<p>budget, bearing in mind Mr Lowcock’s earlier advice”. The Treasury would be keen to </p>
<p>share the burden across the international community, to minimise the UK contribution. </p>
<p><b>225. </b> Ms Short commented on that advice: </p>
<p>“Let us be clear … we have [a] Contingency Reserve of £100 mill[ion] and all our </p>
<p>systems strained [we] cannot take money from other poor countries. We are not </p>
<p>asking for or promising money. DFID prob[ably] has no more than £50 mill[ion]. </p>
<p>If HMG wants to provide more – so be it but DFID limited.”</p>
<p>142</p>
<p><b>226. </b> Ms Short wrote to Mr Blair on 5 February to provide an update on humanitarian </p>
<p>planning.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> In that context, she advised that a “fair share” for the UK of a major </p>
<p>humanitarian/reconstruction operation would be around 5.6 percent, equal to the </p>
<p>UK’s share of OECD GNI. Under one scenario, that could equate to £440m a year for </p>
<p>three years. </p>
<p><b>227. </b> The letter did not describe that scenario or provide a cost for any others. </p>
<p><b>228. </b> Ms Short also advised that DFID’s resources and those of the international system </p>
<p>were already under severe strain.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>480</p>
<p><b>229. </b> Ms Short concluded: </p>
<p>“The immediate question is how big a part the UK should play in humanitarian </p>
<p>preparations. It would be helpful to know whether you think the UK should remain </p>
<p>modest or aim higher in terms of our humanitarian contribution to resolving the Iraq </p>
<p>crisis. If you want the UK to take more of a lead … then I would be willing to do that. </p>
<p>But it would need to be an effort on behalf of the whole Government, not just my </p>
<p>department.</p>
<p>“I think the way in which you could best help is to make clear across the system that </p>
<p>you want humanitarian considerations to be given more weight. In addition it would </p>
<p>help if we could settle the financial questions.”</p>
<p><b>230. </b> Ms Short announced in Parliament on 10 February that she had provided £3.5m </p>
<p>to support UN humanitarian contingency planning.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p><b>231. </b> On 11 February, a Treasury official invited Mr Brown’s comments on officials’ “first </p>
<p>thoughts” on Treasury policies in a post&#8209;Saddam Hussein Iraq.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> The official identified </p>
<p>the Treasury’s “two main finance ministry interests” in Iraq as ensuring its prosperity </p>
<p>and stability while fairly sharing the costs of achieving this. The costs of ensuring Iraq’s </p>
<p>prosperity and stability were “potentially massive”, and comprised peacekeeping costs </p>
<p>(the UK contribution to peacekeeping in the FRY had peaked at £325m in 1999/2000), </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance, environmental costs, reconstruction and economic stabilisation </p>
<p>(including IMF lending). An “emerging policy position” would be to: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maximise the Iraqi contribution, initially by maintaining the OFF programme; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>push for debt rescheduling, to ensure that Iraqi contributions were not </p>
<p>knocked off course by having to resume crippling debt service. The cost would </p>
<p>“conveniently fall to probable non&#8209;combatant countries”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maximise contributions from development banks;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>push for bilateral contributions “to take into account military contributions”, </p>
<p>assuming that the UK military contribution was significant; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensure a finance ministry/international financial institution (IFI) lead on financing </p>
<p>issues, with a clear understanding that no money was committed until needs </p>
<p>were properly understood. </p>

<p>147</p>
<p> Sir Michael Jay, Sir Kevin Tebbit and Mr Chakrabarti were not </p>
<p>present.</p>
<p><b>234. </b> In advance of the meeting, Mr Desmond Bowen, Deputy Head of the Cabinet </p>
<p>Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat, advised Sir David Manning that:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister will … want to seek Clare [Short]’s engagement in the potential </p>
<p>humanitarian relief operation and reconstruction – which will need funding and the </p>
<p>commitment of human resources as a priority.”</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>235. </b> IPU briefing for Mr Straw set out three objectives for the meeting, including:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>encourage Ms Short to engage fully in planning;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuade Ms Short that she should allow DFID money to finance small scale </p>
<p>[reconstruction] projects in the area administered by a UK commander.”</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>236. </b> At the meeting, in response to a question from Mr Blair about whether the UK </p>
<p>should “take the lead on humanitarian action in the southern zone”, Ms Short said that </p>
<p>she was in favour.</p>
<p>150</p>
<p> The UK could do an “exemplary job” in the zone on both the military </p>
<p>and humanitarian fronts. </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Blair concluded that the UK should seek to take the lead on humanitarian </p>
<p>issues in the southern zone of Iraq.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Ms Short wrote to Mr Blair the following day, 14 February, to provide an update </p>
<p>on humanitarian preparations and the role of the UN.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p> Ms Short confirmed that, </p>
<p>within an agreed international framework set out in a second resolution, there was </p>
<p>a “great opportunity” for the UK to play an exemplary humanitarian role in the South:</p>
<p>“But as I made clear in my letter of 5 February, my department has tight budgetary </p>
<p>constraints … Without some understanding on finance, I cannot responsibly commit </p>
<p>DFID to the exemplary partnership with MOD which we discussed.”</p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Blair wrote on his copy of the letter: “We must get the US to accept the </p>
<p>UN role.”</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>240. </b> On 17 February, a DFID official sought Ms Short’s views on the implications of </p>
<p>the decision that “the UK should take the lead on humanitarian issues in the southern </p>
<p>zone of Iraq, and do an exemplary job on both the military and humanitarian front”, and </p>
<p>in particular how it should balance its limited human and financial resources between </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>482</p>
<p>playing an exemplary role in the South and supporting the UN and wider international </p>
<p>effort across the country and the region.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>241. </b> The official recommended that DFID prepare for four roles:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Support humanitarian needs nationally and in the region, primarily through </p>
<p>the UN and Red Cross/Red Crescent movement;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work alongside and influence humanitarian action by US DART [Disaster </p>
<p>Assistance Relief Teams]; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Work alongside the UK military; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undertake DFID bilateral humanitarian action.”</p>
<p><b>242. </b> The official identified a number of “further pre&#8209;deployment steps which we need </p>
<p>to initiate now to be adequately prepared to play these roles effectively”:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Establish a forward base in Kuwait to allow DFID to build its capacity for </p>
<p>deployment into Iraq as humanitarian needs arose and security allowed. </p>
<p>A forward base would give DFID an “immediate response capability”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deploy a Humanitarian Adviser to Jordan to liaise and work with humanitarian </p>
<p>partners.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Undertake regional assessment missions, including to Cyprus, Egypt, Turkey </p>
<p>and Iran.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Deploy a civil&#8209;military Humanitarian Adviser to 1 (UK) Div in Kuwait, and </p>
<p>undertake regular visits to CENTCOM in Qatar.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Second consultants and provide equipment to support humanitarian </p>
<p>co&#8209;ordination, initially to the UN Humanitarian Information Centre (HIC) in </p>
<p>Cyprus. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> The official warned: </p>
<p>“If we do not have people and assets in place and ready in time, we will not be </p>
<p>able to respond quickly and as may be needed. Once conflict has begun logistical </p>
<p>constraints will make it extremely difficult to respond unless we have put the </p>
<p>preparations in place.”</p>
<p><b>244. </b> The official concluded by considering resource constraints. Until DFID received </p>
<p>any indication from the Treasury or No.10 that further funds would be forthcoming in the </p>
<p>event of conflict, it was planning on the basis that it could access a substantial share </p>
<p>of DFID’s Contingency Reserve to supplement its CHAD emergency funds and its Iraq </p>
<p>programme funds.</p>

<p>Minute DFID [junior official] to PS/Secretary of State [DFID], 17 February 2003, ‘Iraq – Contingency </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>483</p>
<p><b>245. </b> If a total of £60m was available from those sources in 2003/04, DFID planned </p>
<p>initially to commit £35m to meet immediate relief needs. Exactly how that amount </p>
<p>should be allocated would depend on the nature of the conflict and other factors, but </p>
<p>an indicative allocation might be: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£20m to support the work of UN agencies, the Red Cross and NGOs across </p>
<p>Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£5m to fund QIPs delivered by the UK military, to help generate stability within </p>
<p>communities; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£10m for DFID’s own rapid response capacity. </p>
<p><b>246. </b> The official commented:</p>
<p>“Under many scenarios, £35 million is unlikely to be perceived as an adequate </p>
<p>UK contribution to any immediate relief effort, particularly if OFF collapses. </p>
<p>Leaving £25 million for further humanitarian need, medium&#8209;term rehabilitation and </p>
<p>reconstruction could also look very sparse. Action in response to the Secretary of </p>
<p>State’s previous two letters [Ms Short’s letters of 5 and 14 February] to the Prime </p>
<p>Minister on this rests with No.10.”</p>
<p><b>247. </b> The official also advised:</p>
<p>“If the military is involved in the direct delivery of humanitarian assistance, there will </p>
<p>be an issue about who pays. MOD claim to be financially stretched and are keen for </p>
<p>DFID to pay.”</p>
<p><b>248. </b> Ms Short held a meeting the following day to discuss that advice, attended by </p>
<p>Dr Brewer, Mr Fernie and other DFID officials.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p> Mr Chakrabarti did not attend, but </p>
<p>a copy of the record of the meeting was sent to his Private Office.</p>
<p><b>249. </b> Ms Short said that she was concerned that much of what was proposed in the </p>
<p>submission “pre&#8209;supposed the financial comfort we had so far failed to receive from </p>
<p>the Treasury”. She was “unwilling, without a clear financial package, to plan to do more </p>
<p>than support the UN, key international agencies, and perhaps provide some funding to </p>
<p>the UK military for QIPs”. She had repeatedly made it clear (to Mr Blair in person and </p>
<p>in writing, and in the House of Commons) that DFID did not have the financial resources </p>
<p>to play a major role. </p>
<p><b>250. </b> Within those constraints, Ms Short was content for officials:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to start discussions about possible support to non&#8209;governmental organisations </p>
<p>(NGOs) not yet involved in Iraq that had specific technical expertise in areas </p>
<p>such as water and sanitation;</p>

<p>484</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>to work closely with the US on a humanitarian response, but only if there was </p>
<p>an overarching UN mandate and financial cover; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“in principle”, to make money available to the UK military for QIPs, to be </p>
<p>re&#8209;examined if there was no UN mandate and the UK military was “working </p>
<p>under a US lead”.</p>
<p><b>251. </b> Ms Short did not agree to establish a forward base in Kuwait on the grounds that </p>
<p>it would imply that military action was a certainty. DFID could make scoping visits to the </p>
<p>region and arrange for vehicles to be ready for transportation, but the equipment should </p>
<p>not be pre&#8209;positioned in the region. Ms Short “accepted that this would mean that DFID </p>
<p>would not be prepared for an immediate response in the event of military action or a </p>
<p>humanitarian crisis on the ground”. She suggested that DFID consider providing more </p>
<p>funds to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which was undertaking </p>
<p>similar preparations to those recommended by DFID officials. </p>
<p><b>252. </b> Ms Short also rejected the deployment of DFID staff to Jordan and the HIC in </p>
<p>Cyprus, on the grounds that it pre&#8209;supposed a significant role for DFID, which it was </p>
<p>as yet unable to promise.</p>
<p><b>253. </b> The meeting agreed that DFID:</p>
<p>“… should work through the range of different scenarios within which we might have </p>
<p>to act and in each case consider how we would respond in terms of financial support </p>
<p>and the channels through which it could be provided.”</p>
<p><b>254. </b> In the context of discussion on those scenarios, Ms Short stated that without </p>
<p>additional resources, DFID “would not be able to take up the exemplary role, working </p>
<p>with the UK military, that the PM had asked us to”. </p>
<p><b>255. </b> Dr Brewer told the 19 February Chiefs of Staff meeting that Ms Short, while </p>
<p>working towards full commitment through the UN, would not be seeking additional </p>
<p>resources beyond DFID’s £100m Contingency Reserve.</p>

<p>THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ESTIMATE OF COSTS, 19 FEBRUARY 2003</p>
<p><b>256. </b> On 19 February, in advance of meetings with Mr Snow and other G7 finance </p>
<p>Ministers, Mr Brown received a number of papers on Iraq.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p><b>257. </b> In a covering minute to those papers, a Treasury official warned that on </p>
<p>reconstruction:</p>
<p>“Our sense is that momentum … is developing very fast, and there is a risk that the </p>
<p>financing agenda could be set by policy decisions taken in Foreign and Defence </p>
<p>Ministries. Sharing ideas with Mr Snow may be a useful way to begin to redress </p>

<p>485</p>
<p>this balance. An additional approach would be to write round Whitehall colleagues </p>
<p>sharing your concerns (for instance, about the economic and financing implications </p>
<p>of foreign and defence policy decisions).”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>258. </b> A paper by Treasury officials identified three “pitfalls” to putting Iraq “on a path to </p>
<p>stability and prosperity whilst fairly sharing the financing burden for this”.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> Those pitfalls </p>
<p>were: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN cover. Without this, the UK would have to contribute more to the </p>
<p>reconstruction effort, IFIs would find it hard to engage, and the international </p>
<p>community would be unable to resolve crucial financing issues such as debt </p>
<p>rescheduling.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Being realistic about the decisions a transitional Iraqi Government could take. </p>
<p>It could be illegitimate and destabilising for the transitional Government to take </p>
<p>decisions on Iraqi economic policy.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The implications of establishing administrative sectors in Iraq: “If the UK takes </p>
<p>on one, the cost – in terms of money and administrative burden – could rocket, </p>
<p>and our stay lengthen.”</p>
<p><b>259. </b> A paper by Mr Dodds and a junior Treasury official provided the first </p>
<p>comprehensive estimate of the cost of the UK’s intervention in Iraq (including military </p>
<p>and non&#8209;military, conflict and post&#8209;conflict costs).</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> The advice on military costs is </p>
<p>described earlier in this Section. </p>
<p><b>260. </b> The officials advised that the best estimate of the cost of military (combat and </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict) operations was now more than £5bn. In addition:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK might spend between £100m and £250m on humanitarian aid in the first </p>
<p>year after any conflict (based on a “typical” UK contribution of 10 percent of total </p>
<p>international aid).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The UK might spend between £100m and £500m on reconstruction in the first </p>
<p>year after any conflict (again, based on 10 percent of total international aid).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was impossible to estimate costs falling to the Export Credit Guarantee </p>
<p>Department (ECGD), including through claims or losses arising from political </p>
<p>and economic instability, and from any decisions to write off debt for political </p>
<p>reasons.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Boateng had already agreed to provide an additional £5m to the FCO from </p>
<p>the Reserve for a “flat&#8209;pack” Embassy. There might be other costs, though the </p>
<p>Treasury was pressing the FCO to absorb those within its budget.</p>

<p><b>262. </b> The officials advised that any DFID contribution to humanitarian and reconstruction </p>
<p>costs would be constrained by DFID’s commitment to spend 90 percent of its bilateral </p>
<p>resources in low&#8209;income countries. Ms Short had already written to Mr Blair (on </p>
<p>5 February) asking for advice on the approach that DFID should take and the potential </p>
<p>for extra resources. It was “quite credible to imagine DFID putting [in] a bid for several </p>
<p>hundred million pounds”. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Brown and Mr Boateng received a further update on military post&#8209;conflict costs </p>
<p>from a Treasury official the following day.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> In that context, the official commented that </p>
<p>the Treasury would also need to take account of the costs of humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>and reconstruction: </p>
<p>“Our line to date has been that departments (mainly DFID) should meet these [costs] </p>
<p>through budget reprioritisation. We would welcome your steer on this but, based on </p>
<p>past conflicts, we suspect it is unlikely to be a sustainable line in the long term.” </p>
<p><b>264. </b> The US inter&#8209;agency Rock Drill from 21 to 22 February confirmed the scale of the </p>
<p>shortcomings in US post&#8209;conflict planning, including the deficiencies of the US Office of </p>
<p>Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA) and the continuing gap between </p>
<p>UK and US positions on the role of the UN (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>265. </b> Ms Short held a meeting on Iraq with DFID officials, including Dr Brewer and </p>

<p>involvement and authority if this was to be effectively addressed”. </p>
<p><b>266. </b> The meeting also reviewed ORHA’s state of preparedness in the light of the </p>
<p>Rock Drill:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Humanitarian plans were the most advanced, but ORHA did not yet have </p>
<p>sufficient funds, staff or capacity to deliver them. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Reconstruction plans were “not nearly as well advanced as they should have </p>
<p>been at this point”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Civil administration plans were the least advanced, and “would not be ready </p>
<p>by the six week deadline they had been set”. </p>
<p><b>267. </b> The meeting concluded that ORHA’s state of preparedness was “extremely </p>
<p>worrying”.</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The meeting also considered financial issues. The MOD and FCO appeared to </p>
<p>be more aware of DFID’s financial constraints, but DFID had not yet received a “clear </p>
<p>response to the issue of the limitation of DFID’s engagement imposed on it by our </p>
<p>financial situation”. Ms Short told the meeting that Mr Brown “had indicated to her, in </p>
<p>a private conversation, that he ‘would do what he could to help’”. </p>
<p><b>269. </b> Dr Brewer wrote to Mr Bowen on the same day to summarise Ms Short’s position; </p>
<p>copies of the letter were sent to the MOD, FCO and Treasury.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> The letter reflected the </p>
<p>conclusions of Ms Short’s meeting with DFID officials on 18 February and Dr Brewer’s </p>
<p>presentation to the Chiefs of Staff on 19 February. Dr Brewer stated that:</p>
<p>“Although [Ms Short] would be keen for DFID to support an exemplary humanitarian </p>
<p>effort in any UK&#8209;controlled sector, our [DFID’s] role will be constrained by the extent </p>
<p>of the UN mandate and the financial resources available to us. We have a strong </p>
<p>commitment to the UN agencies, and would want to allocate significant funding </p>
<p>to them under most scenarios. Drawing heavily on our Contingency Reserve and </p>
<p>existing humanitarian aid and Iraq budget lines is unlikely to release more than </p>
<p>£60&#8209;70m for humanitarian assistance to Iraq in 2003/04. Given our predictions of </p>
<p>the humanitarian needs, with this level of funding we would not be able to play the </p>
<p>exemplary role [in the South] the Prime Minister has asked for, and it would be </p>

<p><b>271. </b> The No.10 paper stated that the cost of “reconstruction and nation building” in Iraq </p>
<p>would be between US$30bn and US$105bn, excluding the direct cost of conflict and </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict peacekeeping. Only an administration enjoying the legitimacy provided by </p>
<p>the UN would be free to engage with the financial markets to secure funding for Iraq’s </p>
<p>long&#8209;term future.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> Mr Bowman replied on 25 February, stating that the Treasury “fully supports the </p>
<p>main message of the paper, that, in the absence of a UN mandate, the financing costs of </p>
<p>reconstructing Iraq will be significantly higher”.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> Mr Bowman offered detailed comments </p>
<p>on the text and advised that the Treasury was already involved in complementary work </p>
<p>alongside the IPU and in liaison with the US and Australia. </p>

<p>military conflict.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> The MOD and DFID believed US plans for humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>were inadequate, in particular because they relied on delivery by NGOs, who would not </p>
<p>be on the ground in Iraq in numbers early on. The UK military would therefore need:</p>
<p>“… immediate access to sufficient expertise and resources to … make good the </p>
<p>deficiencies in the US plans. In particular … DFID experts deployed in theatre, who </p>
<p>can advise what is actually required … (as opposed to soldiers making it up as they </p>
<p>go along) … There are lead&#8209;times associated with this … Waiting till after a second </p>
<p>SCR [resolution] is leaving it too late. We know DFID haven’t got any money. That is </p>
<p>why they need to ask for some, now.”</p>

<p>Security Council resolution.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>276. </b> Ms Short said that a UN legal mandate was “essential” for the humanitarian and </p>
<p>reconstruction tasks that lay ahead; without that, “proper preparation was impossible”. </p>
<p>She also advised that it would be “difficult” to accommodate action in Iraq within DFID’s </p>

<p>“Clare [Short] asked for more resources in Cabinet (‘I can’t take resources away </p>
<p>from Ethiopia’) and the PM looked at me with one of his smiles – what does she </p>
<p>want/need – and what might we offer?” </p>
<p><b>278. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Office sent Sir David Manning an update on military planning </p>
<p>on 28 February.</p>
<p>168</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>279. </b> The section on “Day After” planning identified five UK concerns, including funding </p>
<p>for reconstruction. US planning assumed the rest of the world would pick up 75 percent </p>
<p>of the bill for reconstruction. That was “possibly hopelessly optimistic”. As an Occupying </p>
<p>Power, the UK would be at the front of the queue of countries the US would approach to </p>
<p>make up any deficit.</p>
<p><b>280. </b> Copies of the paper were sent to the FCO, Treasury and Cabinet Office, but not </p>
<p>to DFID. </p>
<p><b>281. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng on 5 March that, with little clarity on the </p>
<p>scale of the humanitarian response that would be required and on the UK’s contribution </p>
<p>to it and no actual bid for resources from DFID, it was difficult to respond substantively </p>
<p>to the concerns expressed by Ms Short in her 5 February and 14 February letters to </p>
<p>Mr Blair.</p>
<p>169</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>282. </b> The official recommended that Mr Boateng write to Ms Short, setting out the </p>
<p>Treasury’s two main concerns: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that funding for reconstruction should be an international effort; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>that Ministers should be aware that the Reserve was “not in a position to fund </p>
<p>large amounts of new expenditure”. </p>
<p><b>283. </b> The Treasury has informed the Inquiry that it has no record of Mr Boateng writing </p>
<p>to Ms Short as a result of that advice.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>284. </b> Ms Short held a meeting with DFID officials on 5 March to discuss Iraq and </p>
<p>in particular the legality of “reconstruction work” without a covering UN mandate.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ms Short concluded that without a clear mandate for reconstruction, DFID could only </p>
<p>legally fund or undertake humanitarian work. DFID would not undertake reconstruction </p>
<p>work, or fund others to do so. DFID “should move away” from any expectation that it </p>
<p>would undertake an exemplary role, or that it would focus on any one area. </p>

<p>possible, “should we [DFID] be asked by No.10 or others how much funding DFID would </p>

<p>MR BLAIR’S 6 MARCH 2003 MEETING ON POST&#8209;CONFLICT ISSUES</p>
<p><b>287. </b> On 6 March, Mr Blair chaired a meeting on post&#8209;conflict issues with Mr Brown, </p>
<p>Mr Hoon, Ms Short, Baroness Symons, Sir Michael Jay and “other officials”.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The meeting is described in detail in Section 6.5. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr Brown received a number of papers from Treasury officials before the meeting. </p>
<p>Mr Dodds’ advice on military operations in the post&#8209;conflict period is described earlier </p>
<p>in this Section. </p>
<p><b>289. </b> A Treasury official provided Mr Brown with a draft “DFID paper rewritten by the </p>
<p>Treasury” on humanitarian relief and reconstruction costs.</p>
<p>174</p>
<p> The draft paper stated </p>
<p>that it was a “first attempt at charting the likely costs of the first three years of the Iraqi </p>
<p>reconstruction”. It adopted a different methodology from the draft DFID paper submitted </p>
<p>to Ms Short on 31 January, but reached broadly similar conclusions. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> The draft paper stated that cost estimates would remain “very rough” until the </p>
<p>IFIs had completed a full needs assessment. However, an analysis of international </p>
<p>precedents indicated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the first year after a conflict, humanitarian costs could be between </p>
<p>US$2bn and US$12bn, depending on the scale of the humanitarian crisis and </p>
<p>the extent to which oil exports were disrupted (the estimates assumed that the </p>
<p>OFF programme would continue).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the second and third years after a conflict, total reconstruction costs (before </p>
<p>Iraq’s oil revenues were taken into account) could be between US$2bn and </p>
<p>US$15bn per year. The upper limit was not based on an analysis of international </p>
<p>precedents, but reflected the potential for “political pressure to spend as much </p>
<p>as the OFF [programme] does now (if not more)”. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>491</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Oil revenues could pay for most of Iraq’s reconstruction – but only if oil </p>
<p>production levels and prices were favourable, Iraq did not have to repay its </p>
<p>debts, and the rehabilitation of Iraq’s oil infrastructure was “cheap”.</p>
<p><b>291. </b> The draft paper stated that sources of financing for relief and reconstruction </p>
<p>remained uncertain. Significant assistance from the international community including </p>
<p>the IFIs would be extremely unlikely without a UN mandate. </p>
<p><b>292. </b> A slightly revised version of that paper was sent to Mr Boateng the following day.</p>
<p>175</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Mr Brown also received advice from a Treasury official on the potential impact of all </p>
<p>military and non&#8209;military expenditure in Iraq on public expenditure.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p> The official’s advice </p>
<p>on military expenditure is described earlier in this Section.</p>
<p><b>294. </b> The official advised that it remained difficult to assess the scale of the humanitarian </p>
<p>and reconstruction response that would be needed. However, based on a “typical” </p>
<p>UK contribution of 10 percent of total aid, the UK might spend up to £1.35bn on </p>
<p>humanitarian assistance and reconstruction in the two years after a conflict. </p>
<p><b>295. </b> The official concluded: </p>
<p>“DFID have yet to make any formal approach to us on these costs but,<b> <i>if you’re </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>minded to, the [6 March Ministerial] meeting might be a good opportunity to </b></i></p>
<p><i><b>dampen their expectations.</b></i></p>
<p>“… we have said that departments should meet new costs through re&#8209;prioritisation. </p>
<p>It is not clear though how long this position will hold.” </p>
<p><b>296. </b> The IPU prepared an annotated agenda for the meeting, in consultation with other </p>
<p>departments.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>297. </b> With the invasion possibly only weeks away, the IPU stated that US and UK </p>
<p>planning assumed that, in the “medium term after the conflict”, Coalition Forces would </p>
<p>be “re&#8209;deployed into six or seven geographical sectors in order to provide a secure </p>
<p>environment for the civil transitional administration to conduct humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>and reconstruction work”. The US expected the UK Division in Iraq to be responsible for </p>
<p>a geographical sector. That would be “very expensive and could have wider resource </p>
<p>implications”. The IPU concluded that: “Ministers need urgently to take a view on this </p>
<p>before the military planning assumptions become a fait accompli.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>492</p>
<p><b>298. </b> The IPU asked Ministers a number of specific questions, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether they agreed “that the UK does not have the resources to make an </p>
<p>‘exemplary’ effort in providing for basic humanitarian needs in the area controlled </p>
<p>by the UK Division”. The cost of making a “significant difference” in a UK Area </p>
<p>of Operation (AO) was estimated at between US$400m and US$2.4bn for the </p>
<p>first year.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p> That was well beyond the financial and implementing capacity of </p>
<p>DFID and the MOD, and could become a significant medium&#8209;term commitment </p>
<p>if the local population became dependent on UK assistance. The alternative </p>
<p>to an exemplary effort was to give UK assistance to UN agencies and NGOs, </p>
<p>supplemented by support for QIPs in the UK’s AO.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>To choose between options for a post&#8209;conflict military presence in the medium </p>
<p>term. The cost of maintaining a military force to provide security in a geographic </p>
<p>area (which might be based on Basra) would be in the order of £1bn a year. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Whether to follow the US plan to administer Iraq as a whole and not seek </p>
<p>general UK responsibility for the administration of any geographic area in </p>
<p>the medium term. In any area where the UK took responsibility for security, it </p>
<p>could, with a UN mandate, also take on wider responsibility for reconstruction </p>
<p>(including humanitarian assistance and aspects of civil administration), but </p>
<p>that would “very likely be beyond the resources of the UK alone and have </p>
<p>implications for domestic departments”.</p>
<p><b>299. </b> At the 6 March meeting: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ms Short said that the “DFID contingency fund” would prioritise Iraq. The funding </p>
<p>available to DFID would not, however, provide for a humanitarian response on </p>
<p>the scale of Kosovo. Ms Short also repeated her view that a UN mandate was </p>
<p>essential for post&#8209;conflict humanitarian and reconstruction operations, both to </p>
<p>provide legal cover for reconstruction and to encourage other countries and </p>
<p>international organisations to participate. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Brown said that the military operation would be “very costly”. Estimates for a </p>
<p>major humanitarian operation were running at US$1.9bn to US$4bn. The burden </p>
<p>of reconstruction should not be borne by the US and UK alone; other countries </p>
<p>and Iraqi oil revenues should be tapped. In the longer term, Iraqi oil should fund </p>
<p>the country’s reconstruction. Mr Brown said that he was particularly concerned </p>
<p>that UK funds should not be used to repay Iraq’s substantial debts to Germany, </p>
<p>France and Russia. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Hoon referred to the importance of humanitarian action in the immediate </p>
<p>wake of the arrival of UK forces. Ms Short said that DFID had £70m available </p>
<p>“for rapid disbursement” on humanitarian activities.</p>
<p>179</p>
<p> </p>
<p>178 </p>
<p>The paper assumed that the UK’s AO would comprise Basra province and that Basra province </p>
<p>contained around 20 percent of Iraq’s population. The figures represented 20 percent of estimated total </p>
<p>humanitarian costs in the first year after a conflict (US$2bn to US$12bn)</p>

<p><b>300. </b> Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“(a)  DFID and MOD should draw up a plan for immediate humanitarian action in the </p>
<p>area of operations of British forces.</p>
<p>(b)  Planning for medium&#8209;term post&#8209;conflict action should continue on the </p>
<p>assumption that a UN mandate (the ‘third/fourth resolutions’) would be </p>
<p>forthcoming … The FCO should prepare a Phase IV plan with other </p>
<p>departments, including the key decisions for Ministers to take.</p>
<p>(c)  The Chancellor should draw up a funding plan, including securing funding from </p>
<p>wider international sources, in particular the IFIs.</p>
<p>(d)  The Prime Minister was prepared to pursue with President Bush our need for </p>
<p>a UN mandate for a post&#8209;conflict administration.”</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>301. </b> Mr Blair stated that the issue of “sectorisation” (whether to seek general </p>
<p>responsibility for the administration of a geographic area of Iraq) would need to be </p>
<p>addressed and should be covered in the Phase IV plan.</p>
<p><b>302. </b> The record of the meeting did not report any discussion on whether the UK had the </p>
<p>resource to make an exemplary effort in providing for basic humanitarian needs in the </p>
<p>area controlled by the UK Division. </p>
<p><b>303. </b> The ‘UK overall plan for Phase IV’ was shown to Mr Blair on 7 March.</p>
<p>181</p>
<p> Much of </p>
<p>the plan, prepared by the IPU, was drawn from the annotated agenda prepared for the </p>
<p>meeting on 6 March. </p>
<p><b>304. </b> The plan stated that, “very soon” after the start of hostilities, the UK needed <b>“to </b></p>
<p><b>agree what our medium&#8209;term contribution to Iraq should be (say from the autumn </b></p>
<p><b>onwards). For this will shape our conduct in the short term.” </b></p>
<p><b>305. </b> The Inquiry has seen no response to the Phase IV plan.</p>
<p><b>306. </b> On 14 March, in response to Mr Blair’s request for a funding plan, Mr Bowman </p>
<p>sent No.10 a Treasury paper on financing reconstruction.</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> The paper was copied to the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the MOD, the FCO and DFID. </p>
<p><b>307. </b> The Treasury advised that the total cost of humanitarian relief and reconstruction </p>
<p>in Iraq could be up to US$45bn over the first three years. Iraqi oil might only pay </p>
<p>for a fraction of that. The UK’s approach should be to spread the burden as widely </p>
<p>as possible.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>494</p>
<p><b>308. </b> An effective burden&#8209;sharing arrangement required the “political legitimacy” that </p>
<p>would follow UN endorsement of the transitional arrangement for governing Iraq. If the </p>
<p>UN was involved, the burden&#8209;sharing arrangement should comprise: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>other bilateral donors, with non&#8209;combatant nations showing “disproportionate </p>
<p>generosity”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maximising contributions from the IMF, the World Bank, other IFIs and the EU; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>preventing Iraqi revenues being “side&#8209;tracked” into paying debt and </p>
<p>compensation claims; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>maximising Iraq’s own contribution from oil revenues.</p>
<p><b>309. </b> If the UN did not endorse the transitional arrangements, many of those approaches </p>
<p>would be more difficult, and there would be pressure on the UK to contribute more. </p>
<p><b>310. </b> The Treasury advised: </p>
<p>“A substantial UK financial contribution to the reconstruction efforts is unlikely to </p>
<p>be affordable within existing spending plans unless the [UK] Government chose </p>
<p>to divert spending from other domestic programmes. In the first instance DFID’s </p>
<p>unallocated departmental provision (£88m for 2003/04) should provide for immediate </p>
<p>requirements. The UK will, however, come under considerable pressure to contribute </p>
<p>much more as its share of immediate humanitarian and reconstruction costs, let </p>
<p>alone what would be required as part of an ‘exceptional response’. Substantial </p>
<p>further support from central funds though is unlikely to be affordable: the costs </p>
<p>of military activity in Iraq and elsewhere have already fully committed the 2003/04 </p>
<p>Reserve; and the overall deterioration in the fiscal position severely limits the </p>
<p>Government’s discretion to make additional spending allocations.” </p>
<p><b>311. </b> The 14 March meeting of the AHGI was informed that the IPU was considering </p>
<p>how best to approach other donors for support on reconstruction, and that the FCO was </p>
<p>considering whether there was scope to approach other countries to contribute to UK </p>
<p>military campaign costs (though the prospects were not good).</p>

<p>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE IN THE UK’S AREA OF OPERATIONS</p>
<p><b>312. </b> A junior official in the Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) wrote to the MOD </p>
<p>on 5 March to alert it to PJHQ’s concerns over the provision of humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>in the UK AO in the immediate aftermath of any conflict.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p> PJHQ had planned to </p>
<p>“piggy&#8209;back” on US arrangements for the provision of humanitarian relief. It was now </p>

<p>had implied that DFID would not provide funding to the UK military for humanitarian </p>
<p>operations without a second UN resolution. Even if there was a second resolution, </p>
<p>DFID’s commitment to supporting UN agencies at a national level would constrain what </p>
<p>DFID would do in the UK’s AO with the UK military and other partners. DFID’s view </p>
<p>was that the most effective way to distribute humanitarian assistance was through </p>
<p>international organisations and NGOs, and DFID intended to focus its resources on </p>
<p>areas of greatest need (rather than necessarily on the UK’s AO). </p>
<p><b>314. </b> PJHQ estimated that between £30m and £50m a month for two months would </p>
<p>be required to cover the provision of humanitarian assistance in the UK’s AO in the </p>
<p>immediate aftermath of any conflict.</p>
<p><b>315. </b> An MOD official submitted advice on the issue to Mr Hoon on 7 March.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The official rehearsed the background set out in PJHQ’s note of 5 March, but suggested </p>
<p>that only £10m a month would be required:</p>
<p>“… DFID have only just engaged on this issue in detail, [and] it has not been </p>
<p>possible to get their expert advice on what might be required … That said, the </p>
<p>current working assumption is that there will be a particular requirement for supplies </p>
<p>of drinkable water, medical supplies and fuel … It has been suggested that the total </p>
<p>requirement could amount to as much as £10m a month …”</p>
<p><b>316. </b> Two camps for internally displaced persons might also be required, at a “one&#8209;off” </p>
<p>cost of £10m each. </p>
<p><b>317. </b> The official provided a draft letter for Mr Hoon to send to Ms Short, seeking her </p>
<p>agreement “to channel aid – funds – through our forces”. That agreement was needed </p>
<p>urgently to ensure supplies could be procured and delivered on time. </p>
<p><b>318. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Ms Short on the same day, seeking her agreement that </p>
<p>“an approach is made to the Chief Secretary” for funding as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>319. </b> Ms Short replied on 12 March, agreeing that Mr Hoon should urgently discuss </p>
<p>funding with the Treasury.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> She added that DFID would not be able to inherit the </p>
<p>“indefinite obligation” to spend £10m a month from the military without adequate finance </p>
<p>to cover it. Copies of Mr Hoon’s and Ms Short’s letters were sent to Mr Brown. </p>

<p> DFID preparations were well in hand; those of the </p>

<p><b>321. </b> Ms Short identified the three “critical steps” which would help joint DFID/MOD </p>
<p>planning for humanitarian action. Those included “clarity over the scale of resources </p>
<p>my department will have to support the provision of humanitarian and reconstruction </p>
<p>assistance in Iraq”; DFID had earmarked £65m for humanitarian relief and </p>
<p>reconstruction. </p>

<p>any “early humanitarian” costs, given its responsibility for humanitarian issues and </p>
<p>to incentivise it to become more engaged in planning and delivery of immediate </p>
<p>post&#8209;conflict humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> The Treasury’s “option B” was that the MOD </p>
<p>claimed its expenditure on humanitarian relief from the Reserve, as part of NACMO. </p>

<p>shortcomings in humanitarian preparations and steps needed to address them.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>329. </b> Officials identified seven problems:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UN funding needs insufficiently met. Preparedness incomplete …</p>

<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>US preparedness for response lacks local experience and based on optimistic </p>
<p>assumptions …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How to maintain the Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food (OFF) programme …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How to support humanitarian agencies [to] gain early access to Iraq …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>How Coalition Forces can provide effective humanitarian response …”</p>
<p><b>330. </b> The proposed solution for the first three problems was provision of “immediate </p>
<p>additional funds to DFID”. </p>
<p><b>331. </b> Ms Short sent the paper to Mr Blair on 17 March with the comment: </p>
<p>“This summarises what needs to be done to improve humanitarian preparedness. </p>
<p>Perhaps we could really focus on this next week.”</p>
<p>195</p>
<p><b>332. </b> The military role in providing humanitarian assistance was summarised in a joint </p>
<p>minute from Mr Straw and Mr Hoon to Mr Blair on 19 March.</p>
<p>196</p>
<p> Mr Straw and Mr Hoon </p>
<p>advised:</p>
<p>“The military task will be to facilitate a secure environment … to enable immediate </p>
<p>humanitarian relief to be conducted. To help UK forces win hearts and minds, </p>
<p>HMT [the Treasury] have allocated them £30m for humanitarian purposes in the first </p>
<p>month as well as £10m for quick win projects. (Clare [Short] has allocated £20m for </p>
<p>UN agencies’ preparations and earmarked another £60m from DFID’s Contingency </p>
<p>Reserve for humanitarian operations. But this is a drop in the ocean; in the worse </p>
<p>case, if the Oil&#8209;for&#8209;Food programme ground to a halt, Iraq could need as much as </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>498</p>
<p><b>334. </b> The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and International Federation </p>
<p>of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched humanitarian appeals on </p>
<p>20 March, each for approximately US$80m.</p>
<p>197</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>335. </b> Ms Short wrote to Mr Boateng the following day to request an additional </p>
<p>£120m from the Reserve for humanitarian assistance for Iraq.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>336. </b> Ms Short advised that she could provide £80m for humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>from DFID’s core budget in 2003/04 (£75m from its Contingency Reserve of £90m </p>
<p>and £5m from the existing Iraq programme). That was in addition to the £10m </p>
<p>already provided from DFID’s 2002/03 budget to UN agencies and NGOs. From the </p>
<p>£80m available, she had: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>earmarked £65m for the UN’s forthcoming initial Flash Appeal, which was </p>
<p>expected to seek US$1.9bn to cover the first six months of the crisis; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agreed to provide £10m to support further preparations by the World Food </p>
<p>Programme, the Red Cross and NGOs. </p>
<p><b>337. </b> Ms Short stated that with only £5m left, and with demand for funding expected to </p>
<p>accelerate fast as humanitarian agencies moved from preparing to delivering, she now </p>
<p>needed an extra £120m from the Reserve: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£35m for the Red Cross appeals launched on 20 March;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£20m for NGO programmes;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£15m for DFID’s bilateral effort, to deliver direct emergency support to fill gaps </p>
<p>in the international response and to second UK relief professionals to UN </p>
<p>agencies; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a further £50m for the UN initial Flash Appeal: “Given the UK’s role in the Iraq </p>
<p>crisis, we cannot conceivably avoid meeting less than a 10 percent share of the </p>
<p>UN humanitarian appeal. My initial contribution of US$100million [£65 million] </p>
<p>will need quickly to be followed up to get us closer to a 10 percent share.”</p>
<p><b>338. </b> Ms Short added that her bid did not include any funds for reconstruction: that </p>
<p>would need to be considered “in the longer term”. </p>
<p><b>339. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng on 25 March that Ms Short’s letter “does </p>
<p>not really make a case in terms of actual humanitarian impact … DFID’s argument is in </p>
<p>essence about the need to be seen to commit funds”.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> There was little detail on how </p>
<p>the money would be spent. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>agree the claim subject to further detail on how and when the money would be </p>
<p>spent; or </p>

<p><b>341. </b> Mr Bowman advised the Treasury official on 26 March that Mr Brown’s view was </p>
<p>that the Treasury should agree to provide £100m to DFID. He asked the official for a </p>

<p>figure.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>342. </b> Later that day, Mr Bowman advised the Treasury official that Mr Brown had, after </p>
<p>further reflection, decided to provide the full amount requested by Ms Short (£120m).</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>343. </b> Mr Boateng replied to Ms Short on 27 March, agreeing her bid in full, subject to </p>
<p>further detail on how and when the money would be spent.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>344. </b> By 27 March, the UK Government had earmarked £240m for humanitarian relief:</p>

<p>£30m for the UK military to provide humanitarian relief in the UK’s AO, from the </p>
<p>Reserve;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£90m from DFID’s own resources; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£120m for DFID from the Reserve.</p>
<p><b>345. </b> The Inquiry asked Ms Short and Sir Suma Chakrabarti whether DFID had had </p>
<p>the resources to deliver, with the MOD, an exemplary humanitarian effort in the South. </p>
<p><b>346. </b> Ms Short told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… I had written a number of letters saying, ‘All we [DFID] have got is our </p>
<p>Contingency Reserve and I’m supposed to keep that for other emergencies in the </p>
<p>world … if we mean this [the exemplary approach in the South], there has got to </p>
<p>be some money on the table’, and what we were getting from the Treasury was no </p>
<p>answer, nothing and it was this period of stand&#8209;off. Gordon Brown was pushed out </p>
<p>and marginalised at the time … </p>
<p>“So after a lot of delay and a number of efforts, the Treasury … came with a letter </p>
<p>saying, ‘There is no money. Money is very tight, and, therefore, we have got to have </p>
<p>a UN Resolution so we can get the World Bank and the IMF and all the others in’.</p>

<p>it is that late …”</p>
<p>203</p>
<p><b>347. </b> The Inquiry concludes that the Treasury letter referred to by Ms Short was </p>
<p>Mr Bowman’s letter of 14 March to No.10. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> Sir Suma told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We [DFID] were very concerned about the resource position. This was one of the </p>
<p>biggest constraints on planning because we didn’t know what our financial envelope </p>
<p>would be in the end. We first raised the resource issues with the Treasury at official </p>
<p>level in December 2002 and then it was raised in various letters from Clare Short to </p>
<p>the Prime Minister.”</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>349. </b> Mr Brown rejected those criticisms. He told the Inquiry that the Treasury’s concern </p>

<p>My recollection of it was the British intervention was on a larger scale, but obviously </p>
<p>there had been quite a lot of inflation since then and I think we always assumed </p>

<p><b>361. </b> The estimates of military conflict and post&#8209;conflict and non&#8209;military costs which the </p>
<p>Treasury provided to Mr Brown on 19 February were reasonably accurate, given the </p>

<p><b>362. </b> Military costs relating to the conflict totalled some £2.2bn, against an estimate of </p>
<p>£3.0bn (not including RAB costs). </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Military post&#8209;conflict costs in 2004/05 were £0.9bn, against an estimate of £1.0bn. </p>
<p><b>364. </b> The UK allocated £210m and spent £110m on humanitarian assistance in 2003/04, </p>
<p>against the £100m to £250m range of likely expenditure identified by the Treasury. </p>
<p><b>365. </b> The UK spent £99m on reconstruction in 2003/04, less than the £100m to £500m </p>
<p>range identified by the Treasury. The £99m included a contribution of £70m to the UN </p>

<p><b>366. </b> Most of the issues raised at Mr Blair’s meeting on 6 March, including the role of the </p>
<p>UN, sectorisation and the nature of the UK’s post&#8209;conflict contribution in Iraq, remained </p>
<p>unresolved as the invasion began (see Section 6.5).</p>
<p><b>367. </b> Mr Hoon and Mr Straw sent Mr Blair a joint minute on the UK military contribution </p>
<p>to post&#8209;conflict Iraq on 19 March.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> The minute, copies of which were sent to Mr Brown, </p>
<p>Ms Short and Sir David Manning, invited agreement to five propositions including:</p>
<p>“In broad terms the MOD will need to draw down its scale of effort to nearer a third of </p>
<p>its commitment by the autumn.” </p>
<p><b>368. </b> That reduced commitment would equate to “a maximum of around one brigade, a </p>
<p>two star headquarters and possibly a contribution to higher level command and control, </p>
<p>air and maritime components, and support enablers”. </p>
<p><b>369. </b> The joint minute gave little detail of what UK forces would be required to do </p>
<p>immediately after the invasion: </p>
<p>“The expectation is that UK forces would be responsible for a task focused on Basra </p>
<p>and other key military objectives in the south east of Iraq … This task is broadly </p>
<p>proportionate to the size of the UK’s contribution to overall Coalition land forces …”</p>
<p><b>370. </b> The joint minute stated that US planning remained “sensibly flexible” once the </p>
<p>initial phase was over and “a major part of Iraq has been stabilised”. It would be </p>
<p>premature to take a view on the merits of sectorisation for that stage. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> Mr Rycroft informed the FCO and the MOD on 21 March that Mr Blair agreed to the </p>
<p>Straw/Hoon recommendations, subject to further urgent advice on the size of any UK </p>
<p>sector, the duration of the UK commitment and the exit strategy.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>372. </b> Mr Dodds provided advice to Mr Brown on the joint minute on 24 March.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Dodds reported that the picture looked “rather different to that presented in the </p>
<p>correspondence”:</p>
<p>“The Defence Chiefs say that a ‘medium size’ deployment (ie 10,000&#8209;15,000) is the </p>
<p>most we could sustain in the medium term without lasting damage to our forces. </p>
<p>MOD officials tell us they had intended the submission [the joint minute] to pose the </p>
<p>question ‘do you want us to do as much as we can (ie this medium size deployment) </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>504</p>
<p>or as little as we can get away with (ie less)?’ The question is not posed in that </p>
<p>form and hence is not answered. <b>The choice is essentially political, but it is </b></p>
<p><b>essential to note that the cost of a deployment on this medium scale is about </b></p>
<p><b>£1bn</b> <b>a year.”</b></p>
<p><b>373. </b> Mr Dodds also reported that the MOD understood that the US now intended to </p>
<p>create four, two&#8209;star (Divisional) commands in Iraq; the MOD’s “ambition” was to secure </p>
<p>one of those commands. However: </p>
<p>“… we should not be too ready to take on a ‘two&#8209;star command’ without the </p>
<p>necessary guarantees. The military will baulk at this – a ‘2&#8209;Star command’ would </p>
<p>provide a seat at the top table in the aftermath. But the risks that it brings of costs </p>
<p>that we cannot afford both militarily and financially mean that it comes at potentially </p>
<p>a high price.”</p>
<p><b>374. </b> Mr Dodds advised that, given that this was an issue on which the Treasury and the </p>
<p>MOD differed, Mr Brown’s input “could be invaluable”.</p>
<p><b>375. </b> Mr Dodds also advised that Mr Brown might have a view on “whether to press for </p>
<p>a smaller commitment than the £1bn ‘medium’ scale deployment that MOD/FCO have </p>
<p>offered”. </p>
<p><b>376. </b> Mr Dodds concluded by stating that it would be useful if Mr Brown could “urge </p>
<p>caution at Cabinet in taking on post&#8209;conflict commitments without assurances from the </p>
<p>US on a further UN resolution and about military support to any UK&#8209;led post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>command”.</p>
<p><b>377. </b> Section 8 describes how the UK took responsibility for a sector of Iraq, which </p>
<p>would become Multi&#8209;National Division (South&#8209;East) (MND(SE)).</p>
<p><b>378. </b> At the 27 March meeting of Cabinet, Mr Brown reported that he was making </p>
<p>available an additional £120m for humanitarian relief and raising the allocation of funds </p>
<p>for the conflict from £1.75bn to £3bn.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>379. </b> In his 9 April Budget statement to the House of Commons, Mr Brown announced </p>
<p>that he had set aside £3bn in a “Special Reserve” available to the MOD, so that UK </p>
<p>troops could be properly equipped and resourced.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that represented £1bn a year for three years.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>381. </b> £1bn was the cost of a medium&#8209;scale military commitment in the post&#8209;conflict </p>

<p>223</p>
<p><b>384. </b> The MOD advised that the figures for Phases III, IV and V were their “first forecast” </p>

<p><b>Impact on operations of the MOD’s financial position, 2002 to 2004</b></p>
<p><b>385. </b> In the light of the publicity surrounding the funding and management of the defence </p>
<p>programme in 2003 and 2004, the Inquiry examined two related questions:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the size of the MOD’s core budget and whether it imposed constraints on </p>
<p>operations in Iraq; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>whether the imposition of controls on the MOD’s management of its resources </p>
<p>by the Treasury in September 2003 had an impact on operations in Iraq. </p>

<p>224</p>
<p> The SDR recognised that while the collapse of </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>506</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Speaking to <i>The Independent on Sunday</i> in 2007, Lord Guthrie, Chief of the </p>
<p>Defence Staff from 1997 to 2001, said that he came close to resigning during the </p>
<p>negotiations over the 1998 SDR: </p>
<p>“We had taken the Treasury by the hand through it all and thought we were home </p>
<p>and dry … Then at the last moment [Mr] Brown tried to take a lot more money out </p>
<p>of it. If he had, the whole thing would have unravelled.”</p>
<p>225</p>
<p><b>389. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that when he arrived at the MOD, in October 1999, there </p>
<p>was “quite a strong feeling that it [the MOD programme implementing the 1998 SDR] </p>
<p>was not fully funded”.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>390. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary from July 1998 to November </p>
<p>2005, told the Inquiry that when he arrived at the MOD he estimated that the department </p>
<p>was “about half a billion short” of being able to implement the SDR, although his </p>
<p>colleagues did not agree the shortfall was that large.</p>
<p>227</p>
<p> The MOD had tried but failed to </p>
<p>“recover the position” in the 2000 Spending Review. </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Sir Kevin told the Inquiry that the MOD’s resource position in 2002 had not affected </p>
<p>the decision to mount a large&#8209;scale operation in Iraq:</p>
<p>“While I think the core budget was insufficiently funded to deliver the SDR force </p>
<p>structure, that doesn’t mean to say that I felt that the funding wasn’t there to conduct </p>
<p>the [Iraq] operation, or indeed to sustain our objectives in Iraq, on the basis that </p>
<p>we were planning to hand over, on the basis that we were not intending to stay … </p>
<p>beyond a certain period …”</p>
<p>228</p>
<p><b>392. </b> Mr Woolley told the Inquiry that the SDR set out a high&#8209;level strategy, and it was </p>
<p>a question of judgement whether a particular level of funding was sufficient to deliver </p>
<p>that strategy.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>393. </b> Mr Woolley identified three factors which, in his view, caused the “budgetary </p>
<p>pressure” that the MOD faced in 2002: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the year&#8209;on&#8209;year efficiency savings that the 2000 Spending Review had </p>
<p>required;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the cost of salaries, fuel and equipment rising faster than inflation; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>exchange rate fluctuations. </p>
<p><b>394. </b> The SDR New Chapter, published in July 2002, continued the shift towards </p>
<p>expeditionary capability.</p>

<p><b>395. </b> In early 2002, Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Brown to request an additional £500m for </p>
<p>2002/03 above the MOD’s 2000 Spending Review settlement.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> He argued that the </p>
<p>inadequate size of the MOD’s 2000 Spending Review settlement, and the cost of </p>
<p>expeditionary warfare, had produced a £770m hole in the MOD’s budget. The MOD </p>
<p>was prepared to absorb £270m of that. </p>
<p><b>396. </b> No.10 wrote to the Treasury on 19 March 2002 to record that the MOD and </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>508</p>
<p><b>Resource Accounting and Budgeting </b></p>
<p>Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) has two key elements. First, costs are </p>
<p>recorded when resources are consumed rather than when the cash is spent. Second, </p>
<p>to provide a more accurate and transparent measure of the full economic costs, </p>
<p>RAB incorporates non&#8209;cash costs including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>depreciation – the consumption of capital assets over their useful economic life; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>impairments, such as stock write&#8209;offs; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a cost of capital charge – the opportunity and financing costs of holding capital. </p>
<p>The introduction of RAB by the Government was intended to create an incentive for </p>
<p>departments to reduce non&#8209;cash costs, for example by reducing the amount and value </p>
<p>of assets and stocks held. </p>
<p>Under RAB, the total Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL) comprised three elements: </p>
<p>a resource budget (RDEL); a capital budget (CDEL); and adjustments to reflect non&#8209;cash </p>
<p>costs. </p>
<p><b>402. </b> While the 2002 settlement was presented in RAB terms, in order to allow </p>
<p>reconciliation back to previous settlements and to aid public presentation, the letter also </p>
<p>gave an estimate of the cash spending associated with the settlement. The table below </p>
<p>presents that estimate.</p>
<p><b>403. </b> The change from cash accounting to RAB presented an opportunity for the MOD </p>
<p>significantly to increase its available cash by reducing its non&#8209;cash costs (depreciation </p>
<p>and the cost of capital). </p>

<p><b>405. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson told the Inquiry that negotiations on the MOD’s 2002 </p>
<p>settlement had not appeared to be acrimonious:</p>
<p>“… I didn’t get the sense that the MOD was being starved of resource. Indeed, the </p>
<p>2002 settlement gave them small real increases … </p>
<p>“… it is open to the Secretary of State, it is indeed open to the Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Staff … to approach the Prime Minister and raise concerns. The Secretary of State </p>
<p>could have taken it to Cabinet and he could have held out. They didn’t …”</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>406. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that the MOD had welcomed the 2002 settlement </p>
<p>because it had been done on a resource accounting basis, rather than on a cash basis:</p>
<p>“The problem … for the Treasury was that, whereas in most departments the </p>
<p>transition from cash to accruals [RAB] didn’t make very much difference, in the </p>
<p>case of defence it made a huge difference, because our asset base was something </p>
<p>between 70 and 90 billion pounds, a massive amount of money.</p>
<p>“Now, the amount of … depreciation, capital charging, write&#8209;off allowance that was </p>
<p>in [the MOD’s] settlement, was a prudent figure … </p>
<p>“But it did mean, as it transpired, that we had the headroom to achieve what I felt </p>
<p>we had always failed to achieve before in my previous three years there, to actually </p>
<p>fund the defence programme properly …”</p>
<p>239</p>
<p><b>407. </b> Mr Woolley told the Inquiry that Mr Boateng’s letter of 10 July 2002 had: </p>
<p>“… made no reference to there being a separate limit on the non&#8209;cash element of </p>
<p>the overall resource budget … </p>
<p>“So we made the assumption that there was no separate limit within our budget for </p>
<p>non&#8209;cash, that we were to regard all resource budgets as available for whatever </p>

<p><b>408. </b> Mr Woolley agreed with the Inquiry that, in practice, the change to RAB meant </p>
<p>that by bearing down on non&#8209;cash costs the MOD would be able to increase cash </p>
<p>expenditure. </p>
<p><b>409. </b> Mr Woolley also drew attention to the “volatility” of MOD non&#8209;cash costs, resulting </p>
<p>from periodic revaluation of assets, the number of write&#8209;offs of assets and stocks in a </p>
<p>particular year, and delays in bringing new equipment into service (which would reduce </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>410. </b> Mr Bruce Mann, MOD Director General Financial Management from May 2001 to </p>
<p>February 2004, told the Inquiry that the MOD and the Treasury had worked together for </p>
<p>many years before 2002, better to understand that volatility.</p>
<p>241</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>411. </b> By early April 2003, the Treasury had become concerned about the MOD’s plans </p>
<p>to transfer £1bn a year in 2003/04, 2004/05 and 2005/06 from non&#8209;cash to cash.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That would increase UK Public Sector Current Expenditure (PSCE) by the same </p>
<p>amount, which the Treasury judged to be unaffordable. </p>
<p><b>412. </b> The Treasury acknowledged that the MOD should be able to redeploy non&#8209;cash </p>
<p>savings released through genuine efficiency gains to cash, but was concerned that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the size of the non&#8209;cash savings had come “as a bolt from the blue”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD had over&#8209;estimated its non&#8209;cash costs (making it easier subsequently </p>
<p>to identify and claim savings); and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>some elements of the savings were due to “windfall gains or creative </p>
<p>accounting”, for example as the MOD changed the depreciation profiles on </p>
<p>equipment and wrote down the value of equipment. </p>
<p><b>413. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit warned Mr Hoon on 14 April that Treasury officials had questioned </p>
<p>the planned transfer of some £3bn from non&#8209;cash to cash over the next three years, </p>
<p>which they regarded as undermining Mr Brown’s fiscal projections.</p>
<p>243</p>
<p> Treasury officials </p>
<p>had said that they could give no assurances that the MOD’s budget would not be </p>
<p>reduced, and had indicated that they would take account of the MOD’s increased cash </p>
<p>spending in deciding how to deal with “other issues in&#8209;year”. Sir Kevin described that as </p>
<p>“code for our claims on the Reserve” in respect of operations in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> Sir Kevin concluded that the MOD had acted in good faith within the terms of the </p>
<p>2002 settlement, which allowed “unlimited flexibility to move funds between separate </p>
<p>resource and capital sub&#8209;programmes”.</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Discussions between MOD and Treasury officials continued through the summer, </p>
<p>leading to a reduction in the MOD’s planned transfer from £3bn to £2bn (£490m in </p>
<p>2003/04, £631m in 2004/05 and £948m in 2005/06).</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>416. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng on 19 August that he should “rebut” the </p>
<p>MOD’s entire £2bn transfer as neither legitimate nor affordable and against the “whole </p>
<p>ethos of RAB”: </p>
<p>“The big picture is that the MOD have acted in bad faith. RAB sets out guidelines </p>
<p>and principles, but cannot cover every eventuality … Treasury is ultimately </p>

<p><b>417. </b> The official summarised the MOD’s position:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It was working within the RAB framework, which rewarded lower non&#8209;cash costs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It claimed that the Treasury had focused it on DEL totals, and had told it that </p>
<p>cash management was irrelevant. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD’s settlement letter in the 2002 Spending Review specified that it had </p>
<p>unlimited flexibility to move funds between sub&#8209;programmes.</p>
<p><b>418. </b> The official also set out the Treasury’s arguments against the MOD position:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>These switches [from non&#8209;cash to cash] are not affordable …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD have generated this improved cash flow from a mixture of accounting </p>
<p>charges, exploitation of the transitional phase between RAB Stage I and II, and </p>
<p>ineffective management of procurement contracts. Thus this cash windfall has </p>
<p>nothing to do with the RAB principles of efficiency or improved asset utilisation </p>
<p>…</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD has consistently reassured us … that non&#8209;cash forecasts in SR2002 were </p>
<p>understated, not overstated. It would appear that they have misled us.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>… it was always understood (although admittedly not put in writing) that </p>
<p>significant movements in cash/non&#8209;cash would have to be agreed with HMT </p>
<p>[the Treasury].</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The quality of MOD’s forecasting remains poor and does not instil confidence …</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is not credible that MOD can really have believed that cash was not </p>
<p>relevant …”</p>
<p><b>419. </b> The Treasury’s analysis of the MOD’s planned £2bn transfer indicated that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>35 percent was the result of changes in accounting treatment which had been </p>
<p>designed to produce non&#8209;cash savings.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>23 percent was the result of delays in procurement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>33 percent was the result of exceptional write&#8209;offs.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>10 percent could not be accounted for.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p><b>420. </b> The Treasury judged that only the second category (delays in procurement) </p>
<p>represented legitimate non&#8209;cash savings.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>512</p>
<p><b>421. </b> Mr Boateng wrote to Mr Hoon the following day, saying that he was unable to </p>
<p>agree any transfer from non&#8209;cash to cash within the MOD’s budget. Mr Boateng stated </p>
<p>that, given the very tight fiscal position, the Government could not afford an unplanned </p>
<p>increase to public sector net expenditure of the magnitude proposed by the MOD.</p>
<p>247</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Copies of the letter were sent to Mr Blair and Mr Brown. </p>
<p><b>422. </b> Mr Hoon replied to Mr Boateng on 3 September.</p>
<p>248</p>
<p> Mr Hoon argued that he </p>
<p>had agreed the MOD’s 2002 Spending Review settlement on a RAB basis, including </p>
<p>that the MOD had unlimited flexibility to move funds between separate resource </p>
<p>sub&#8209;programmes within its budget. The Treasury was now proposing “to move the </p>
<p>goalposts”. Mr Hoon challenged Mr Boateng’s description of the transfers as resulting </p>
<p>from “windfalls” and “transitional effects”. </p>
<p><b>423. </b> Mr Hoon stated that while it was not possible to say precisely where cuts would </p>
<p>fall, cuts in training:</p>
<p>“… would soon cut into long&#8209;term military capacity and our ability to continue to </p>
<p>sustain our operations in Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>424. </b> Mr Boateng and Mr Hoon met on 15 September to discuss the non&#8209;cash to cash </p>
<p>transfers.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> Mr Hoon told Mr Boateng that the MOD needed to transfer £870m from </p>
<p>non&#8209;cash to cash in 2003/04 (rather than the £490m the MOD had previously estimated). </p>
<p><b>425. </b> The following week, MOD officials told Treasury officials that their total additional </p>
<p>cash requirement for 2003/04 had grown from £870m to £1,152m. </p>
<p><b>426. </b> On 26 September, in advance of a meeting with Mr Brown, Mr Dodds produced </p>
<p>a note summarising the exchanges between the Treasury and the MOD and reflecting </p>
<p>on “how MOD had got into this position”. On that question, he concluded:</p>
<p>“MOD say they believed that under … RAB, cash was not a control. It is an open </p>
<p>question whether this is stupidity or cunning.” </p>
<p><b>427. </b> Mr Brown wrote to Mr Blair later that day, reporting the exchanges between </p>
<p>the MOD and the Treasury on the MOD’s “legitimate questions” and highlighting his </p>
<p>particular concern over the MOD’s most recent requests: </p>
<p>“Until a fortnight ago, Paul Boateng was discussing with Geoff Hoon whether it </p>
<p>was acceptable for up to £490 million of non&#8209;cash … to be redeployed as cash </p>

<p><b>£1,152 million of extra cash represents a very serious failure.</b> This is not a RAB </p>
<p>problem, it is a basic control problem. </p>
<p>“Given the gross loss of control by MOD, I must disallow immediately any flexibility </p>
<p>for MOD to move resources between non&#8209;cash and cash … I must … also impose </p>
<p>on MOD a fixed cash control total to ensure that it remains within the SR2002 </p>

<p>“… I require an urgent externally led review of MOD’s financial control arrangements, </p>
<p>and assurance that the MOD will immediately focus on cost control …”</p>
<p>250</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>428. </b> Mr Brown wrote that he was “anxious” that these changes would not affect the </p>
<p>special arrangements that the Treasury had agreed with the MOD to fund operations </p>
<p>in Iraq, and committed himself to ensuring that that funding continued. </p>
<p><b>429. </b> Mr Boateng wrote to Mr Hoon the same day, reiterating Mr Brown’s argument.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>430. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that he acted to impose additional controls on the MOD </p>
<p>because: </p>
<p>“The purpose of resource accounting was to make sure that the assets of different </p>
<p>departments were used more efficiently. So there had to be proof that the assets </p>
<p>were being used more efficiently for that to be able to release cash … </p>
<p>“If we had allowed every department to do what the Ministry of Defence were doing, </p>
<p>then we would have an extra cost of £12 billion …” </p>
<p>“I wrote to the Prime Minister about this because it was obviously an issue about the </p>
<p>cash expenditure of the Government.”</p>
<p>252</p>
<p><b>431. </b> Mr Hoon replied to Mr Boateng on 29 September.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> He rejected the charge that </p>
<p>the MOD had lost control of its budget and argued that the emergence earlier that month </p>
<p>of additional costs was due to a lack of defined Treasury controls rather than a lack of </p>
<p>control by the MOD. </p>
<p><b>432. </b> Mr Hoon reported that in order to comply with Mr Brown’s demand that the MOD </p>
<p>reduce its cash expenditure by £1.1bn in the current year, there would have to be a </p>
<p>moratorium on uncommitted expenditure. He had agreed measures that would reduce </p>
<p>cash expenditure by up to £500m in the current year (which would have “serious and </p>
<p>just manageable” consequences for defence), but would not agree any further measures </p>
<p>until Mr Blair had had a chance to consider the issue. </p>

<p><b>433. </b> Mr Hoon also challenged the assurances offered by Mr Brown and Mr Boateng that </p>
<p>operations in Iraq would not be affected:</p>
<p>“… to suggest that cuts to the core Defence Budget will have no impact on military </p>
<p>capability or morale reveals a lack of understanding about how defence works. </p>
<p>The net additional military costs are only one element, and a relatively small </p>
<p>element, of what goes into creating the military capability deployed in Iraq. Cuts in </p>
<p>core equipment, logistics and training programmes will inevitably affect operations </p>
<p>in Iraq. The only question is how quickly. The effect on morale will be more or less </p>
<p>immediate.”</p>
<p><b>434. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair in similar terms on the same day.</p>
<p>254</p>
<p><b>435. </b> On 6 October, Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary sent Mr Heywood a list of the main </p>
<p>measures the MOD was taking to meet Mr Hoon’s commitment to save up to £500m </p>
<p>in the current financial year.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p> Those were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>further reductions in activity, especially overseas exercises;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>paring back logistic support;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>deferring plans to buy a fifth C&#8209;17 strategic lift aircraft; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>delaying or reducing spend on other future equipment programmes, including </p>
<p>the Battlefield Light Utility Helicopter, the Nimrod MRA4 and the Watchkeeper </p>
<p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). </p>
<p><b>436. </b> Mr Hoon’s Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“These measures would not directly impact on operations in Iraq, but would begin </p>
<p>to cut into training and support needed for motivated Armed Forces capable of </p>

<p>“In brief, MOD are requesting an extra £650/1000/1275m over the next </p>
<p>three years …</p>
<p>“There is no plausible reason why MOD’s non&#8209;Iraq spending should need to increase </p>
<p>by 9 percent in the current year; and the Government’s Chief Accounting Adviser, </p>
<p>Sir Andrew Likierman, is absolutely clear that there has been an unacceptable </p>

<p>are doing). The MOD have been completely unable to explain what the additional </p>
<p>£650m this year is to be spent on.</p>
<p>“I know your instinct will be to back the MOD on this. But frankly I do not think they </p>
<p>have much of a case.”</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>439. </b> Mr Heywood provided an update on negotiations to Mr Blair on 10 October.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mr Brown had “grudgingly acquiesced” to provide an additional £250m in 2003/04 </p>
<p>(and nothing for 2004/05 and 2005/06), “despite the rapidly deteriorating fiscal position”. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> Mr Heywood concluded that providing an additional £350m to £375m for 2003/04 </p>
<p>would be a reasonable compromise, with additional funding for the following years to </p>
<p>be considered after a review of the MOD’s financial controls. </p>
<p><b>441. </b> Mr Blair met Mr Brown and Mr Hoon separately in mid&#8209;October to discuss the </p>
<p>issue.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>442. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Blair on 17 October, identifying the short&#8209; and medium&#8209;term </p>
<p>consequences of the imposition of cash controls.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> Those included a reduction in </p>
<p>the preparedness of the military to conduct operations, cuts and delays in equipment </p>
<p>programmes, delays to planned pay increases, cuts in force structure, and a freeze on </p>
<p>recruitment in some areas. Mr Hoon argued that to avoid those consequences, he would </p>
<p>need authority to transfer more than the £400m “which is being suggested” for 2003/04, </p>
<p>and agreement now for similar levels of transfers in subsequent years. </p>
<p><b>443. </b> Mr Heywood passed that letter to Mr Blair, advising that he had almost brokered </p>
<p>a deal between the MOD and the Treasury which involved:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an additional £385m to £400m for the MOD in 2003/04;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an external review of the MOD’s financial control systems; and </p>

<p>a decision on funding in future years in the light of the findings of that review.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>444. </b> Mr Heywood described that deal as “exceptionally generous”, given that the </p>
<p>Reserve was already fully spent and the UK was heading for a “massive fiscal </p>
<p>overshoot”. He concluded: </p>
<p>“I very much hope that you will endorse the compromise … This also means </p>

<p>“However, given the late stage of the financial year and so as to minimise the </p>

<p>261</p>
<p><b>446. </b> That uplift was conditional on MOD agreement to an externally led review of </p>
<p>its financial control arrangements, and an assurance it would make maximum use </p>
<p>of savings generated by its efficiency programme to ensure that cash and resource </p>
<p>spending were properly controlled. Once the review had made its recommendations and </p>
<p>any changes to the MOD financial controls had been implemented, the Treasury would </p>
<p>look again at Mr Hoon’s request for extra cash for 2004/05 and 2005/06. </p>
<p><b>447. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that it was the MOD’s normal practice to appeal </p>
<p>to Mr Blair on funding issues:</p>
<p>“… given the particular nature of the Blair Government, the MOD tended to look </p>
<p>to … the Prime Minister for understanding and support in the budgetary context. </p>
<p>Some other departments went direct to the Chancellor. We usually tried to operate </p>

<p>review team: that it had not controlled cash or near cash because it was not </p>
<p>required to do so under full RAB.</p>
<p><b>452. </b> Mr Dodds recommended that Treasury and MOD officials should develop </p>
<p>a framework to control the transfer of non&#8209;cash savings into cash spending. </p>
<p>The framework could allow transfers where they resulted from efficiency gains</p>
<p> </p>
<p>and </p>
<p>subject to a cap. Decisions on the MOD’s budget for 2004/05 and 2005/06 should await </p>
<p>the conclusion of those discussions.</p>
<p><b>453. </b> Mr Hoon wrote to Mr Brown on 17 December, proposing that the Treasury allow the </p>
<p>MOD to transfer £750m from non&#8209;cash to cash in both 2004/05 and 2005/06.</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> Mr Hoon </p>
<p>stated that the cash controls imposed by the Treasury had required the MOD to reduce </p>
<p>planned expenditure in the current financial year (2003/04) by £800m, and would require </p>
<p>the MOD to reduce planned expenditure by £1bn a year in future years. </p>
<p><b>454. </b> Mr Hoon cited the Likierman review in support of this request: </p>
<p>“I was pleased, but not surprised, that the CAP Gemini Ernst and Young Report </p>
<p>[the Likierman review] gave the MOD a clean bill of health. It confirmed that the </p>
<p>Resource Accounting and Budgeting framework does not require control of net </p>
<p>cash or near cash … the MOD was following the terms of the settlement letter and </p>
<p>your rules.” </p>
<p>“Given the outcome of the … review, I can expect restoration of the freedom to </p>
<p>flex more than £1bn per year from non&#8209;cash to cash – which is what is required to </p>
<p>maintain the direction envisaged at the time of SR2002 and the SDR New Chapter. </p>
<p>However, I do recognise … the fiscal position and our collective responsibilities in </p>
<p>this area. I accordingly propose that we agree to flex £750 million in 2004/05 and </p>
<p>£750 million in 2005/06.” </p>

<p>which had been produced towards the end of 2003.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> Mr Lester commented that the </p>
<p>chronology had been produced to clarify the MOD’s internal understanding, and was not </p>
<p>to be handed over to the Treasury.</p>
<p><b>463. </b> The chronology showed: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In December 2001, the MOD estimated that it would have an Annually Managed </p>
<p>Expenditure (AME) “surplus” of £500m a year (compared with its previous </p>
<p>estimate). </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD had “serious doubts” about that estimate (some of the figures were </p>
<p>“clearly wrong”), so used its previous (higher) estimate as the basis for its 2002 </p>
<p>Spending Review bid.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Further estimates in April and June 2002 increased the MOD’s confidence </p>
<p>that it would have a £500m a year AME surplus, though it was still not certain. </p>
<p>The MOD assumed that the Treasury would scrutinise its AME figures as part of </p>
<p>the 2002 Spending Review; if it had, the MOD would probably have reduced its </p>
<p>bid. But the Treasury did not scrutinise the figures.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>When the MOD agreed its 2002 Spending Review settlement in July 2002, while </p>
<p>it still did not trust its exact AME figures, it was confident that “there would be </p>
<p>scope to bear down on … costs … That was why we were able to recommend </p>
<p>acceptance of the settlement.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Prompted by continuing doubts about the accuracy of its AME figures, the MOD </p>
<p>conducted a “detailed scrutiny” in December 2002. That exercise confirmed the </p>
<p>AME surplus. The surplus was “reinvested” for cash expenditure the following </p>
<p>month.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>MOD Top Level Budget&#8209;holders (TLBs) continued to refine their AME figures, </p>
<p>revealing further significant reductions in their requirement. The forecast </p>
<p>surpluses were reinvested for cash expenditure in February 2003. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Analysis of the forecasts provided by MOD TLBs in late August revealed further </p>
<p>reductions in their AME requirement. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD warned the Treasury on 12 September that the MOD’s cash </p>
<p>requirement had increased from £490m to £870m. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD warned the Treasury on 24 September that the MOD’s cash </p>
<p>requirement had increased to £1,152m. </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Lester’s covering note advised: </p>
<p>“PUS [Sir Kevin Tebbit] asked why we ‘got it wrong’ as the headline numbers rose </p>
<p>from £490m to £870m to £1,152m during the course of September 2003. This is </p>
<p>not easy to explain … the Treasury’s key accusation – that we lost control of </p>
<p>TLBs expenditure – is wrong. What did happen was that we found it very difficult </p>

<p>to re&#8209;invent the non&#8209;cash and near&#8209;cash split in TLBs budgets, having made the </p>
<p>transition to full RAB.”</p>
<p>274</p>
<p><b>465. </b> Mr Lester identified the main reasons behind the increase in the MOD’s cash </p>
<p>requirement from £490m to £870m:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“late technical refinements” by MOD TLBs (£200m);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a reassessment by FLEET (the Royal Navy’s operational Command) of its </p>
<p>requirements (£122m); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>policy decisions (£40m). </p>
<p><b>466. </b> The main reason behind the increase in the MOD’s cash requirement from </p>
<p>£870m to £1,152m was the discovery that the MOD had issued its TLBs with over </p>
<p>£200m more near&#8209;cash than it had available. That error had been caused by the </p>
<p>absence of a near&#8209;cash control total in the 2002 Spending Review settlement. </p>
<p><b>467. </b> Lord Boateng told the Inquiry that he doubted that Mr Hoon and Sir Kevin Tebbit </p>
<p>had been aware of the particular opportunities created by full RAB for the MOD when </p>
<p>they had welcomed the MOD’s 2002 settlement: </p>
<p>“I think this was an opportunity that became available later, and they saw the </p>
<p>opportunity and they took it …</p>
<p>“A fair enough wheeze perhaps, if not one that could be tolerated.”</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>THE IMPACT OF THE TREASURY CONTROLS</p>
<p><b>468. </b> Mr Hoon told the Inquiry that the imposition of cash controls “caused quite a lot of </p>
<p>problems”, because the MOD had been spending at a rate which assumed an unlimited </p>
<p>flexibility to transfer non&#8209;cash to cash, and had made plans which assumed this </p>
<p>unlimited flexibility.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>469. </b> Mr Hoon also told the Inquiry that although the MOD’s forward equipment </p>
<p>programmes, including its helicopter programmes, had been affected, he doubted </p>
<p>whether this had “immediate consequences” for the UK’s operations in Iraq: </p>
<p>“I don’t believe that it was relevant to helicopters in Iraq … I suppose it is reasonable </p>
<p>to assume that by now [January 2010], had that budget have been spent in the </p>
<p>way that we thought we should spend it, then those helicopters would probably be </p>
<p>coming into service any time now.”</p>

<p>521</p>
<p><b>470. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit told the Inquiry that Mr Brown’s decision to impose cash controls </p>
<p>meant that the MOD:</p>
<p>“… had to go in for a very major savings exercise in order to cope with what was </p>
<p>effectively a billion pound reduction in our finances.”</p>
<p>“… the way we went through this exercise was to preserve resources for Iraq, for </p>
<p>the operational scenarios that we were currently engaged in, and to make cuts and </p>
<p>savings in the areas which were least likely to be called upon …”</p>
<p>278</p>
<p><b>471. </b> In response to a question from the Inquiry, Sir Kevin said that it was “very difficult </p>
<p>to say” that the reduction had had a long&#8209;term impact on UK operations in Iraq.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p><b>472. </b> Mr Brown told the Inquiry that the MOD had more funding available to it in 2002/03, </p>
<p>2003/04 and 2004/05 than it had secured in the 2002 Spending Review: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the additional £500m for 2002/03, which had been confirmed by Mr Boateng in </p>
<p>July 2002; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>authority to transfer £400m from non&#8209;cash to cash in 2003/04 and 2004/05.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>473. </b> Mr Brown also emphasised that the size of the MOD’s core budget had “really not </p>
<p>much to do with Iraq, because Iraq was being funded completely separately”.</p>
<p>281</p>
<p><b>474. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit agreed with that analysis:</p>
<p>“I really do not believe that our activities in Iraq were constrained by the overall </p>
<p>size of the MOD budget. My own view was that Afghanistan was – putting the two </p>
<p>together was where the strain came subsequently.”</p>

<p>relation to resources for Iraq were made under the influence of the demands of the UK </p>

<p><b>481. </b> The funding approved for Urgent Operational Requirements (UORs) increased </p>
<p>significantly in 2006/07, as security in Iraq deteriorated, expenditure on Afghanistan </p>

<p>and the Treasury in September 2002 continued to operate until autumn 2006. </p>
<p><b>485. </b> In autumn 2006, the UOR envelopes for Iraq and Afghanistan were combined, </p>
<p>with a view to providing additional flexibility in managing UOR funding and to reduce </p>
<p>bureaucracy in the MOD and the Treasury.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>24 November 2006 that he should write to Mr Stephen Timms, Chief Secretary to the </p>
<p>Treasury, to request an increase of £460m in the combined UOR envelope.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> Despite </p>
<p>tight controls, the requirements for UORs continued “at a rate higher than anticipated, </p>
<p>and considerably above historical norms”, because of:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the intensity of operations in Afghanistan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the slow drawdown of forces from Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the constantly evolving threat in both theatres; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“a decreased willingness, at all levels, to ‘make do’ with sub&#8209;optimal solutions </p>
<p>and uncomfortable living and working conditions now that both operations </p>
<p>[Afghanistan and Iraq] have become enduring”.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> The size of the request prompted Mr Browne’s Assistant Private Secretary to do </p>
<p>“a little digging” into the MOD’s UOR system.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> He reported to Mr Browne that:</p>
<p>“The UOR system – the people who make bids on it and those who sanction </p>
<p>bids within it – are changing their attitude. There is greater willingness to ask for </p>
<p>technical solutions to reduce risk and discomfort and less inclination to block such </p>
<p>bids. Partly this is because there is a perception (rightly or wrongly) that the political </p>
<p>environment has changed, and money is no longer the constraint it was … </p>

<p>“HMT [the Treasury] have never refused a request to fund a UOR. Once forces are </p>
<p>deployed and commanders are generating requirements it is difficult to deny the </p>
<p>resources … It follows that the mechanism for limiting the total cost of operations </p>
<p>is to resist any expansion of troops committed to operations, rather than UORs to </p>
<p>supply the troops already deployed in theatre.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>526</p>
<p><b>495. </b> Reporting the Treasury’s “emerging response” to Mr Browne, Mr Taylor said that </p>
<p>Mr Quinault had made clear:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The current, high level of UOR approvals was generating significant financial </p>
<p>pressure on the Reserve, such that Treasury officials viewed the current UOR </p>
<p>mechanism as “unsustainable”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A key Treasury concern was that there was no incentive within the current UOR </p>
<p>mechanism for the MOD to manage demand or reprioritise equipment plans. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the shorter term, Treasury officials were keen to modify the UOR mechanism </p>
<p>so that the Treasury agreed a smaller envelope to cover smaller UORs, while </p>
<p>larger UORs would be agreed individually with Treasury officials. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In the longer term, a new UOR mechanism should be considered as part of </p>
<p>the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. </p>
<p><b>496. </b> Mr Quinault had also told MOD officials that he would be recommending to </p>
<p>Mr Timms that he should ask the MOD to find the resources for two UORs which he </p>
<p>perceived as general capability enhancements.</p>
<p><b>497. </b> Mr Taylor concluded:</p>
<p>“All that said, Quinault accepted that Treasury Ministers may take a different view </p>
<p>given the evident sensitivities, so we should not assume anything about the formal </p>
<p>Treasury response until the Chief Secretary [Mr Timms] has written …”</p>
<p><b>498. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Timms on 20 April that the “step change” in the level </p>
<p>of UOR funding made the current UOR arrangement “unsustainable”.</p>
<p>300</p>
<p> The Treasury </p>
<p>had provided £2.1bn to fund UORs relating to Iraq and Afghanistan since 2001, of which </p>
<p>over half had been provided in the last two years:</p>
<p>“We [the Treasury] do not question the military judgment that there is a current </p>
<p>operational need – but we believe that many of these items seek to provide </p>
<p>a general capability that could have been provided through the Equipment </p>
<p>Programme. Many items appear to be kitting out the Army while the Equipment </p>
<p>Programme has invested in ships and aircraft … As such we think the UOR scheme </p>
<p>is becoming a straightforward supplement to the EP [Equipment Programme] in a </p>
<p>way that it was never intended to be, bailing out MOD of the need to prioritise in the </p>
<p>kit they purchase and compensating for bad decisions in the past.” </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>527</p>
<p><b>499. </b> The official advised that the UOR regime was not ideal for the UK military </p>
<p>either, as:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Despite accelerated procurement, UORs were frequently not available until </p>
<p>several months after a need had been identified. It would be better to plan </p>
<p>to have the capability in advance. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That would also enable soldiers to be trained on new equipment before their </p>
<p>deployment to theatre, and for new equipment to be properly incorporated into </p>
<p>military doctrine. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>After one year, the ongoing costs of UORs reverted to the core defence budget. </p>
<p>Those unplanned costs could be difficult to accommodate. </p>
<p><b>500. </b> The official recommended that Mr Timms agree a £200m increase in the combined </p>
<p>UOR envelope, and signal a need for a new UOR regime to be negotiated within the </p>
<p>forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. </p>
<p><b>501. </b> Mr Timms replied to Mr Browne on 9 May: </p>
<p>“We discussed that the UOR regime has drifted from its original intentions. </p>
<p>We agreed we need a different arrangement for the funding for UORs in the </p>
<p>future … I propose we seek to develop this as part of our discussions around the </p>
<p>CSR [Comprehensive Spending Review].”</p>
<p>301</p>
<p><b>502. </b> As an “interim solution”, Mr Timms agreed to increase the UOR ceiling by </p>
<p>£200m. For expenditure above that ceiling, and (in line with existing arrangements) </p>
<p>for all individual UORs above £10m, the MOD should seek Treasury approval on a </p>
<p>case&#8209;by&#8209;case basis. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> The MOD and Treasury have told the Inquiry that they have no record of that </p>
<p>discussion between Mr Timms and Mr Browne.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>504. </b> From June 2007, the Treasury cleared every UOR individually (rather than only </p>
<p>those above £10m).</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>505. </b> The outline of a new UOR regime was agreed in late July, as part of the MOD’s </p>
<p>settlement in the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Reserve would pay for the “first element” of total UOR costs each year.</p>

<p>528</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD and Treasury would share equally any costs in excess of this amount </p>
<p>(with the Treasury meeting those excess costs up front, and then reclaiming </p>
<p>them from the MOD on a rolling three&#8209;year basis).</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD would receive £200m to assist with its first payments under this </p>
<p>new arrangement.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The MOD would review its equipment programme with the intention of </p>
<p>“rebalancing spend towards … the current operating environment”.</p>
<p>304</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>506. </b> Discussions continued between MOD and Treasury officials over the detail of </p>
<p>the new arrangement, including the size of the “first element”. </p>
<p><b>507. </b> Mr Lester advised Mr Woolley on 30 October that: </p>
<p>“The agreed aim is that the new arrangements should be cost neutral to Defence, </p>
<p>albeit with changed incentives, and Quinault professes to mean this.”</p>
<p>305</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>508. </b> Mr Lester continued:</p>
<p>“The Treasury have indicated that their intention is to drive the lump sum [first </p>
<p>element] as far down as possible in an attempt to change our UOR spending </p>
<p>behaviour (they have indicated that they see this as a vehicle to shift our EP </p>
<p>[equipment programme] towards current operations). Their prejudice is that MOD </p>
<p>does not make real prioritisation decisions on UORs …”</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Mr Lester also reported that the arrangements which had been in place since </p>
<p>June, whereby the Treasury cleared each UOR individually, had not proved to be unduly </p>
<p>constraining, though the Treasury was “increasingly pushing back”.</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Agreement on the size of the first element was reached in mid&#8209;December 2007, </p>
<p>at £500m for 2008/09, based on the MOD’s “central estimate” of UOR expenditure of </p>
<p>£900m.</p>
<p>306</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>511. </b> Mr Woolley told the Inquiry that the change in the UOR regime:</p>
<p>“… was intended to give a little bit greater certainty to the Treasury of what the UOR </p>
<p>bill was likely to be and it was effectively an attempt to incentivise us [the MOD] to </p>
<p>forecast in advance what the UOR spend in … the forthcoming year – would be.”</p>
<p>307</p>
<p><b>512. </b> Mr Woolley said that the change had not affected operations in Iraq, which were </p>
<p>by that time generating fewer demands for UORs.</p>

<p>“In the longer term, we will need to consider reconstruction costs. We agree with you </p>
<p>that there should be broad international burden sharing of any financing gap unmet </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>530</p>
<p><b>519. </b> The Treasury told the Inquiry that it has no record of any department requesting </p>
<p>that allocation.</p>
<p>313</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>520. </b> On the same day, a Treasury official advised Mr Boateng that, as DFID still </p>
<p>had £95m available for humanitarian work, and given that the UN did not yet have a </p>
<p>presence on the ground in Iraq and the reconstruction effort had not yet started, he </p>
<p>should write to Ms Short “to impose some safeguards” on the additional US$100m.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>521. </b> Mr Boateng wrote to Ms Short on 15 April to clarify how DFID could access those </p>
<p>funds.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> He understood that DFID did not need the additional funds immediately, given </p>
<p>that humanitarian and reconstruction work was at a very early stage and that DFID had </p>
<p>£95m of uncommitted resources. He fully expected DFID to bid for additional funding for </p>
<p>Iraq “in the next few months”. Mr Boateng asked that, before DFID looked to access the </p>
<p>new funds, Ms Short should write to him setting out her proposals for how the additional </p>
<p>funding would be spent. </p>
<p><b>522. </b> Ms Short agreed on 23 April that other departments should be given access to the </p>
<p>US$100m allocation, to pay for their secondments to the US&#8209;led Office of Reconstruction </p>
<p>and Humanitarian Assistance (ORHA).</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> That would mean that they, rather than DFID, </p>
<p>would have to pass the Treasury’s tests on value for money and effectiveness.</p>
<p><b>523. </b> Mr Boateng wrote to Mr Straw on 2 May to endorse the “broad consensus” that </p>

<p><b>527. </b> Based on contemporaneous sources and figures provided to the Inquiry, the </p>
<p>Inquiry estimates that DFID had committed £117.8m to the humanitarian assistance </p>
<p>effort by May 2003, of which £89m had been disbursed. That comprised:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£78m to UN agencies (of which £64m had been disbursed);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£32m to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Iraqi Red </p>
<p>Crescent (of which £18m had been disbursed);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£6.2m to NGOs (of which £5.4m had been disbursed); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£1.6m for DFID’s bilateral effort (all of which had been disbursed).</p>
<p>319</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>528. </b> The Inquiry estimates that £90m was therefore available to DFID for “recovery and </p>
<p>reconstruction” or for further contributions to the humanitarian assistance effort.</p>
<p><b>529. </b> The balance of the US$100m announced by Mr Brown on 9 April that would not be </p>
<p>spent on secondments to ORHA was also available for reconstruction and development. </p>
<p><b>530. </b> The Annotated Agenda for the 15 May meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on </p>
<p>Iraq Rehabilitation (AHMGIR) stated that the scale of the reconstruction challenge was </p>
<p>“enormous”.</p>
<p>320</p>
<p> Large projects would fall to ORHA and subsequently the Iraqi authorities. </p>
<p>But there was a case now for “smaller refurbishment projects”. Of the £10m available </p>
<p>to the UK military for QIPs only £50,000 had been spent, and of the £30m available to </p>
<p>the UK military for humanitarian relief operations in the UK’s AO, only £3m had been </p>
<p>committed and £1m spent. The remainder could be used for other purposes. </p>
<p><b>531. </b> In discussion, Mr Boateng agreed that the MOD could spend the balance of </p>
<p>the £10m allocated for QIPs, but said that “other funds for reconstruction” had been </p>
<p>allocated to DFID.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> The MOD and DFID needed to discuss the issue.</p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The Human Rights Project Fund. A “very small sum” had been put aside for Iraq. </p>

<p><b>539. </b> FCO, DFID and MOD Ministers were invited to agree a GCPP Strategy for Iraq on </p>
<p>1 August.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> The strategy aimed to provide a coherent framework for UK activities aimed </p>
<p>at preventing conflict in Iraq. It comprised three elements:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Security Sector Reform (SSR). This would be the “initial focus of activity”. </p>
<p>Ministers were invited to agree that expenditure on SSR activities could start </p>
<p>immediately while work continued to define the other elements of the strategy. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Assistance to “Iraqi Governorates and local administrations within the British AO </p>
<p>[Area of Operations] as they develop to ensure that policy decisions are made </p>
<p>strategically and with an understanding of conflict prevention issues”. </p>
<p>• </p>

<p>prevention strategies. </p>
<p><b>540. </b> The estimated cost of the strategy was £7.5m in both 2003/04 and 2004/05. Of the </p>
<p>£15m total, £9.5m was allocated for SSR, £4m for local governance and £1.5m for </p>
<p>further studies and analyses. </p>

<p>Secretary), Sir Michael Jay (in Mr Straw’s absence) and No.10 officials.</p>
<p>329</p>
<p> Mr Blair said </p>
<p>he had returned from Iraq convinced that “an enormous amount needed to be done”. </p>
<p>The Government should go back to “a war footing” for the next two to three months to </p>
<p>avoid “losing the peace in Iraq”. </p>

<p> Mr Straw </p>
<p>stated that he had been reluctant to put in a Reserve claim, “not least because of </p>
<p>Gordon’s [Mr Brown’s] strictures about the pressure on it”. The FCO had, however, </p>
<p>reached the limit of its ability to manage the constant new demands on its resources: </p>
<p>“… the continuing need to fund Afghanistan operations in Kabul and London; </p>
<p>Iraq costs; and the costs of increased security around the world in the light of the </p>

<p><b>545. </b> Mr Straw also requested that £28m be added to the FCO’s budget for 2004/05 </p>

<p>for additional funding and challenged Mr Stephens on whether the MOD and DFID </p>
<p>were being asked to absorb costs arising from Iraq to the same extent as the FCO. </p>
<p>He reported that: </p>
<p>“He [Mr Stephens] was evasive and uncomfortable … He argued weakly that the </p>
<p>decision was taken on the basis of capacity and ability to absorb … I pointed out that </p>
<p>DFID and MOD both had much greater capacity to absorb not only because of the </p>
<p>size of their budgets but also because of the strain on FCO expenditure …</p>
<p>“They [the Treasury] are certainly stung by accusations that the FCO is being singled </p>
<p>out for harsher treatment than other Government departments and this should be </p>
<p>part of the Foreign Secretary’s line with the Chief Secretary.”</p>
<p>PRESSURE FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR RECONSTRUCTION</p>
<p><b>554. </b> Security in Iraq deteriorated in August 2003. Concerns about progress on </p>
<p>reconstruction in the South and the implications for the level of consent enjoyed by UK </p>

<p>to make more effective use of CPA resources …”</p>
<p><b>558. </b> Baroness Amos wrote to Mr Boateng on 10 September to request an additional </p>
<p>£6.5m from the Reserve to cover immediate further needs in Iraq, and that a further </p>
<p>£33.5m should be “ear&#8209;marked” within the Reserve for anticipated requirements later </p>
<p>in the financial year.</p>
<p>338</p>
<p> Those anticipated requirements included £20m for a future </p>
<p>contribution to the Essential Services Plan if CPA funding proved insufficient. </p>
<p><b>559. </b> Baroness Amos advised that the £40m she was requesting represented the </p>
<p>balance of the US$100m/£60m announced by Mr Brown in his 9 April statement to </p>
<p>Parliament, to “back up the UN and the work of reconstruction and development”.</p>
<p><b>560. </b> The following day, in a letter to Mr Blair, Baroness Amos advised that: </p>
<p>“… our overall approach has been predicated on CPA delivering more than it has, </p>
<p>and we have had negligible influence on them, or the Pentagon, to try and turn it </p>
<p>around. Immediate measures are now needed to maintain the Iraqi population’s </p>
<p>consent.”</p>
<p>339</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>561. </b> The Essential Services Plan would help, but solving the underlying problems in </p>
<p>infrastructure would require billions of dollars and an Iraqi government to set policy. </p>
<p>Systemic problems within the CPA continued to delay the transfer of promised CPA </p>
<p>resources to the South. Baroness Amos concluded:</p>
<p>“If CPA HQ and [the] US Government fail to get its act together quickly, then we </p>
<p>can only plug the gap if my earlier Reserve claim … is approved.” </p>

<p>340</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>563. </b> Departments had seen Mr Blair’s call for a step change in the UK effort in Iraq </p>
<p>(on 3 June) as “a legitimate invitation” to bid for more resources. They were developing </p>
<p>or considering seven bids. The largest of those was a bid being prepared by DFID for </p>
<p>around £250m, as the UK’s additional contribution to Iraq’s reconstruction. </p>
<p><b>564. </b> It was vitally important to maintain pressure on departments, both at Ministerial and </p>
<p>official level, not to submit claims in the first place. The Treasury would also continue to </p>
<p>push for greater co&#8209;ordination between departments in funding Iraq programmes. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>537</p>
<p><b>565. </b> Beyond that, the Treasury would continue to scrutinise claims on a case by case </p>
<p>basis, in terms of value for money, impact, and robustness of the costing, and the </p>
<p>robustness of the risk management. Departments would also have to provide “clear </p>
<p>evidence” on the extent to which they had reprioritised their existing resources to </p>
<p>accommodate Iraq:</p>
<p>“The emphasis will be on satisfying ourselves over the degree of re&#8209;prioritisation that </p>
<p>has taken place to accommodate Iraq&#8209;related pressure within existing baselines. </p>
<p>DFID received an eight percent real terms budget increase over the SR2002 period, </p>
<p>the FCO nearly three percent and the MOD received their most generous settlement </p>
<p>for nearly 20 years. We are therefore far from convinced that further re&#8209;prioritisation </p>
<p>within existing baselines is not possible.” </p>
<p><b>566. </b> The availability of CPA funding was key. Some officials in CPA(South) had stated </p>
<p>that it was easier to secure funding from London than from CPA(Baghdad). The Treasury </p>
<p>should therefore continue to push for CPA(Baghdad) to fund initiatives in the South, </p>
<p>rather than providing a significant increase in UK funding. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Treasury officials had considered but rejected another approach – the creation of </p>
<p>a “pooled arrangement” for future Iraq claims, with one pool for military activity and one </p>
<p>for “reconstruction and related” activity. The idea had been raised by some (unnamed) </p>
<p>departments. Such an arrangement might help ensure more effective prioritisation of </p>
<p>activities and prevent a “piecemeal stream” of bids to the Reserve. Treasury officials </p>
<p>had assessed, however, that creating a pooled arrangement now might encourage </p>
<p>departments to allocate money “prematurely”, before the outcome of the Madrid Donors </p>
<p>Conference was known and before the effect of the anticipated increase in the flow of </p>
<p>funding from CPA(Baghdad) to CPA(South) was clear. The potential demand for funds </p>
<p>was so great that a pool could quickly be emptied, prompting further claims to the </p>
<p>Reserve. The official commented that the Treasury might wish to revisit the idea of an </p>
<p>Iraq pool in the future, if the situation changed. </p>
<p><b>568. </b> Mr Boateng replied to Baroness Amos on 25 September, agreeing to provide an </p>
<p>additional £6.5m from the Reserve to cover immediate further needs in Iraq, but rejecting </p>
<p>the request to earmark £33.5m for DFID’s anticipated future needs, citing “recent reports </p>
<p>that … [US] sources of funding are now starting to be unblocked”.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>538</p>
<p>“We had discussions [with] the Treasury but it was quite obvious to us that they </p>
<p>weren’t going to give any more than they already had … They had put some money </p>
<p>in upfront [in March 2003, for humanitarian assistance], but, after that, they said it is </p>
<p>time to reprioritise.”</p>

<p>following month.</p>
<p><b>572. </b> Mr Straw wrote to Mr Boateng on 6 October, requesting £13.9m from the Reserve </p>
<p>to improve the content and professionalism of the Iraq Media Network, the CPA’s main </p>
<p>channel of communication with the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>573. </b> Mr Straw stated that the issue was a priority for Mr Blair. The FCO could not fund </p>
<p>a new priority that had emerged halfway through the financial year from its existing, </p>
<p>very small programme budgets: the FCO’s Public Diplomacy Challenge Fund had an </p>
<p>allocation of £2.5m in 2003/04, of which all but £50,000 had already been allocated. </p>
<p><b>574. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng that he should reject the bid: </p>
<p>“The FCO have not considered any other means to fund this strategy … They have </p>
<p>not even conserved a partial contribution from their own DEL … they have not </p>
<p>engaged the British Council, they have not looked to the Global Conflict Prevention </p>
<p>Pool (GCPP), and have not sought to reconcile their media work with DFID’s.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister views an effective CPA media strategy as vital, therefore the </p>
<p>FCO believe we cannot resist a Reserve Claim and have abdicated responsibility </p>
<p>for ensuring that this package represents VFM [value for money].”</p>
<p>345</p>
<p><b>575. </b> The official also advised Mr Boateng that the FCO was holding up agreement to </p>
<p>a UK pledge at the Madrid Donors Conference until the bid was agreed. </p>
<p><b>576. </b> Mr Boateng replied to Mr Straw on 16 October, rejecting the FCO’s bid on the </p>
<p>grounds that he was not convinced the proposal would deliver value for money, and that </p>
<p>the FCO had not fully explored the use of its existing resources.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>577. </b> Mr Straw responded on 20 October:</p>
<p>“You repeat the mantra that we must look for existing resources within the FCO, </p>
<p>the GCPP and other departments … But it is not clear to me whether the Treasury </p>
<p>has a view as to how much the FCO can reprioritise without damaging the delivery </p>
<p>of other Government priorities overseas in a way which is self&#8209;defeating. In the </p>

<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>539</p>
<p>last two years, the FCO has entered three claims on the Reserve in respect of </p>
<p>the events in Afghanistan and Iraq – none of which were predictable within the </p>
<p>Spending Review cycle. The total FCO claims for these reserves were £105 million. </p>
<p>The Treasury did not dispute the unforeseeable and emergency nature of these </p>
<p>costs and yet the Reserve met only £54.5 million …</p>
<p>“… I have consistently rejected knee&#8209;jerk claims from officials that they need more </p>
<p>resources when in fact they have done insufficient to reprioritise. But the FCO </p>
<p>budget is now substantially overstretched … The Government needs to decide what </p>
<p>priority it places on delivery of the Government’s overseas agenda – including the </p>
<p>direct costs to the Exchequer if we fail.”</p>
<p>347</p>
<p><b>578. </b> When Mr Boateng’s decision was discussed in the Iraq Senior Officials Group on </p>
<p>20 October, Sir Jeremy Greenstock commented that it would be difficult for him to return </p>
<p>to the CPA without any UK funding, and that more generally “the absence of financial </p>
<p>flexibility was making our work harder in Baghdad”.</p>
<p>348</p>
<p><b>579. </b> Mr Boateng and Mr Straw discussed the bid after Cabinet on 23 October.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>580. </b> The Treasury briefing for Mr Boateng rehearsed the reasons why the bid had been </p>
<p>rejected, dismissed any suggestion that bids from the FCO were treated differently from </p>
<p>those of other departments, and argued that the FCO had chosen not to reprioritise </p>
<p>adequately to match the increasing demands of Iraq: </p>
<p><b>“At the end of last financial year and earlier this year, decisions could have </b></p>
<p><b>been taken within the FCO to reallocate greater contingency funding to match </b></p>
<p><b>this government priority [Iraq]. This never happened.</b></p>
<p><b>“Other departments, such as DFID, have shown themselves to be more flexible </b></p>
<p><b>in re&#8209;prioritising to assist with the Iraq effort. FCO should be able to match </b></p>
<p><b>this.”</b></p>
<p>350</p>
<p><b>581. </b> After the meeting, Mr Boateng informed Treasury officials that he had received </p>
<p>an assurance from Mr Straw that he would not pursue the bid further, and that they had </p>
<p>agreed officials should continue to work to identify ways of funding media proposals from </p>
<p>within existing resources.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>582. </b> The FCO wrote to No.10 on 5 November, providing an update on its efforts to </p>
<p>secure funding for the Iraqi Media Network.</p>
<p>352</p>
<p> The FCO had undertaken a “quick audit” </p>
<p>of the UK Government’s support for the Iraqi media and had, with Treasury colleagues, </p>
<p>pressed other departments to do more. Funds available from FCO programme budgets, </p>
<p>the British Council and possibly the World Service totalled between £1.5m and £2m. </p>
<p><b>583. </b> In his statement to the Inquiry, Mr John Buck, FCO Director Iraq from September </p>
<p>2003 to July 2004, wrote: </p>
<p>“… I remember spending a significant amount of time … trying to find several </p>
<p>hundred thousand pounds to finance the purchase of a transmitter in southern Iraq </p>
<p>for the Iraq Media Network … I tried the FCO finance people and was told that </p>
<p>purchase of a transmitter wasn’t really a proper call on FCO funds and that this </p>
<p>should come from the Treasury’s Reserve. I went to the Treasury and was told that </p>
<p>this should really come out of the FCO’s existing allocation, but perhaps it was worth </p>
<p>trying DFID. I had a meeting with DFID, who took the view that they didn’t really do </p>
<p>media. I then went back to the FCO who did then find the money.”</p>
<p>353</p>
<p><b>584. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Buck why, for an initiative for which Mr Blair had expressed </p>
<p>his support, and in a situation where Mr Straw was chairing the AHMGIR, the FCO had </p>
<p>not been able to secure a relatively small amount of funding from the Treasury, and why </p>
<p>the FCO had not tried to go “back up the chain” to Mr Straw or Mr Blair when funding </p>
<p>was blocked.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>585. </b> In response, Mr Buck highlighted the (in his view) favourable treatment enjoyed </p>
<p>by the Treasury due to “broader politics within the Government”. </p>
<p><b>586. </b> Two further FCO bids to the Reserve during the CPA period, for £2m and £9.4m </p>
<p>to improve security for staff seconded to the CPA, were agreed in full on 8 December </p>

<p>“There was and is still no medium term [UK] roadmap … In this environment, it is not </p>
<p>surprising that … the GCPP was used according to the priorities of the day, despite </p>
<p>ministerial endorsement of its medium&#8209;term strategy. GCPP programming therefore </p>

<p>has been made available to address … counter&#8209;insurgency and post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>nation&#8209;building. London and Post have both tended to turn towards GCPP as a </p>

<p>The Treasury was the lead department within the UK Government on securing debt relief </p>

<p>80 percent.</p>

<p> The deal would be delivered in three stages: 30 percent immediately; </p>
<p>30 percent on approval of a standard IMF programme; and 20 percent on completion </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>542</p>
<p><b>589. </b> FCO, DFID and MOD Ministers agreed in September 2004 to fund the provision </p>
<p>of £2.5m of military equipment for the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) from the GCPP.</p>
<p>363</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In a letter to Mr Benn, Mr Straw stated that although the purchase of the equipment </p>
<p>“only just” met the published eligibility criteria for the supply of military equipment from </p>
<p>the GCPP, it was “of broader importance to HMG”. </p>
<p><b>590. </b> Section 12.1 describes Prime Minister Ayad Allawi’s requests to Mr Blair in </p>
<p>September and October 2004 for increased support for the ISF. </p>
<p><b>591. </b> In response, the MOD began to develop a proposal to provide US$107m (£70m) </p>
<p>in additional support to the ISF, including the provision of armoured vehicles, transport </p>
<p>vehicles, other equipment and weapons.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> The MOD’s proposal would become Project </p>
<p>OSIRIS. </p>
<p><b>592. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng’s Private Secretary on 12 October that </p>
<p>following Prime Minister Allawi’s requests, No.10 was pushing for resources to be </p>
<p>allocated “outside the traditional spending categories of the UK military operation (MOD) </p>
<p>and reconstruction (DFID)”.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> The official continued:</p>
<p>“Partly in light of tight spending controls within MOD centre, MOD theatre and </p>
<p>FCO/DFID have been using No.10 interest as an opportunity to try and circumvent </p>
<p>MOD Finance and HMT [Treasury] spending controls. They have managed to get </p>
<p>some political buy&#8209;in to ideas which have not been properly costed, scrutinised </p>
<p>or prioritised.”</p>
<p><b>593. </b> The resulting spending pressures were “significant, mounting and have </p>
<p>critical mass”. So far, the GCPP had filled the “growing gap”, providing £22m of </p>
<p>its £100m budget to fund such ad hoc priorities. However, with much of the GCPP </p>
<p>contractually committed, it could not absorb many more demands. </p>
<p><b>594. </b> As Mr Boateng would not be able to attend the forthcoming meeting of the Ad Hoc </p>
<p>Ministerial Group on Iraq, the official recommended that he should write to Ministers, </p>
<p>proposing the creation of a ring&#8209;fenced allocation for Iraq within the GCPP for 2004/05. </p>
<p>That would comprise £10m of new money from the Reserve, and up to £15m in new </p>
<p>money to match reprioritisation within the GCPP. </p>
<p><b>595. </b> The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on Iraq discussed the MOD proposal on </p>
<p>14 October.</p>
<p>366</p>
<p> Ministers agreed that the proposal should, in principle, be funded, and </p>
<p>that the MOD should put a costed proposal to the Treasury “with a view to achieving </p>
<p>swift agreement”. Mr Straw and Mr Benn both commented that the GCPP had neither </p>

<p>the budget nor the mandate to fund that type of assistance. Mr Hoon said that funding </p>
<p>should come from the “Op TELIC reserve”. Mr Stephens, representing the Treasury, </p>
<p>said that some money could come from the Reserve but that the Treasury would also </p>
<p>want to look at the GCPP. </p>
<p><b>596. </b> Mr Boateng’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Hoon’s Principal Private Secretary </p>
<p>on 18 October, proposing the creation of a ring&#8209;fenced allocation for “ad hoc security </p>
<p>proposals” within the GCPP.</p>
<p>367</p>
<p> Copies of the letter were sent to Mr Straw’s and </p>
<p>Mr Benn’s Private Offices. </p>
<p><b>597. </b> By 22 October, No.10, Mr Hoon’s Private Office and Mr Benn’s Private Office had </p>
<p>all responded to that letter, rejecting the Treasury’s proposal.</p>
<p>368</p>
<p> No.10 commented that </p>
<p>it was imperative that the MOD proposal be funded in full as soon as possible. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> Mr Boateng advised the 28 October meeting of the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group on </p>
<p>Iraq that, of the US$107m worth of equipment requested by the MOD, US$29m would </p>
<p>be funded by the US.</p>
<p>369</p>
<p> The remaining US$78m (some £40.6m) could be funded by the </p>
<p>Treasury from the Reserve on a “one&#8209;off” basis.</p>
<p><b>599. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng in mid&#8209;November that there had been three </p>
<p>separate occasions where “Ministers and officials from FCO and No.10” had made </p>
<p>promises of military equipment to various organisations “without proper analysis of </p>
<p>the requirement or clarifying the availability of UK funding”.</p>
<p>370</p>
<p> Normally effective MOD </p>
<p>internal scrutiny processes had been bypassed. Treasury officials were working with </p>
<p>the MOD to ensure that such proposals were scrutinised, but for this to be effective the </p>
<p>FCO and No.10 needed to “work with the process”. </p>
<p><b>600. </b> A Treasury official advised Mr Boateng on 1 December that the Treasury had </p>
<p>received the MOD’s first request for funding in relation to the MOD proposal, totalling </p>
<p>£15m.</p>
<p>371</p>
<p> The request was “basically a list of kit that £15m will buy”, but it was not the </p>
<p>right time to “dig our heels in”. The MOD had promised that future requests for funding </p>
<p>would meet UOR standards. </p>
<p><b>601. </b> In a Note to President Bush on 10 January 2005, Mr Blair described the Iraqiisation </p>
<p>of security forces as critical but said that he was not convinced that the plan to deliver </p>
<p>this was robust enough.</p>
<p>372</p>
<p> Mr Blair confirmed that he had authorised “an extra $78m </p>
<p>from our MOD for the Iraqi Forces in the South”. Although he could not be sure that </p>
<p>funding was essential, “I’ll take the risk rather than find six months later it was.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>544</p>
<p><b>602. </b> In June 2005, PJHQ advised Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, that </p>
<p>discussions were under way with the Treasury for an additional £38m to fund a </p>
<p>successor programme to Project OSIRIS.</p>
<p>373</p>
<p> The Treasury had taken “a close interest” </p>
<p>in the bid and was keen to ensure that there was “no duplication” with funding allocated </p>
<p>to the FCO and DFID.</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Mr Des Browne, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, wrote to Dr Reid on </p>
<p>23 August, approving £16m from the Reserve for the package of vehicles, infrastructure </p>
<p>and communications equipment that had been presented by MOD officials.</p>
<p>374</p>
<p> Mr Browne </p>
<p>continued: </p>
<p>“Looking ahead, I hope that it will be possible for you to find other means of funding </p>
<p>the remaining elements [of the £38m programme] – either by negotiating with </p>
<p>Baghdad, for a larger share of what is available … or by encouraging our allies – </p>
<p>most of whom are spending far less than we are in maintaining forces on the ground </p>
<p>– to play a bigger role.” </p>
<p><b>604. </b> Dr Reid wrote to Mr Browne on 30 November, seeking a further £19.6m </p>
<p>(for 734 Iraqi Police Service vehicles and 11 ISF infrastructure projects).</p>
<p>375</p>
<p> Dr Reid </p>
<p>advised that the MOD had secured funding from the US, Australia, Italy and Japan, </p>
<p>reducing the amount that the MOD needed to provide. </p>
<p><b>605. </b> Mr Browne replied on 20 December, approving an additional £19.6m from the </p>

<p><b>608. </b> Mr Browne sent Mr Blair an update on Basra, including details of the additional </p>

<p>379</p>
<p> A total of £7m would come </p>
<p>from the GCPP Reserve and £1.4m from FCO&#8209;managed programmes. The MOD, the </p>

<p><b>612. </b> The official concluded that the deal was a good one for the Treasury, because:</p>

<p>It had held the line that the cost of the Better Basra Plan should not be an </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>It had succeeded in getting departments to reprioritise their existing resources </p>

<p>at short notice … it wasn’t a particularly flexible or effective system. That came out </p>
<p>rather visibly in 2006, when it was clear that we needed to put greater effort into </p>
<p>building up the capabilities in Basra … The calculation … was somewhere in the </p>
<p>region of £30 million, which … was required to come out of our current resources … </p>
<p>which struck me at the time as being certainly a peculiar way of approaching what </p>
<p>we were directed was a high priority, but we weren’t being given the extra resources, </p>
<p>to deliver it.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>546</p>
<p><b>New funding mechanisms for civilian operations</b></p>
<p><b>616. </b> A cross&#8209;government review of the UK’s approach to post&#8209;conflict reconstruction </p>
<p>began in summer 2003 (see Section 10.3). Following that review, the inter&#8209;departmental </p>
<p>Post&#8209;Conflict Reconstruction Unit (PCRU) was established in September 2004. </p>
<p>It became operational during 2005. </p>
<p><b>617. </b> The remit of the PCRU was to facilitate integrated planning for the military and </p>
<p>civilian components of an intervention, including by identifying resources from existing </p>
<p>government budgets.</p>
<p>384</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>618. </b> From June 2006, departments and in particular the FCO sought to develop new </p>
<p>mechanisms to fund civilian stabilisation operations. </p>
<p><b>619. </b> Sir Michael Jay and senior FCO officials, the Chiefs of Staff, Dr Nemat Shafik, </p>
<p>DFID Director General Programmes, and Mr Jim Drummond, DFID Director UN Conflict </p>
<p>and Humanitarian Division, agreed on 6 June 2006 that officials should work up a joint </p>
<p>FCO/MOD/DFID proposal on how to ensure a comprehensive approach to funding for </p>
<p>“stabilisation/reconstruction campaigns”.</p>
<p>385</p>
<p> The FCO would lead that work. </p>
<p><b>620. </b> During the meeting, officials agreed that as the Treasury would strongly oppose </p>
<p>any bid to relax the rules on access to the Reserve, the focus of the proposal should </p>
<p>probably be on increasing the size of the GCPP, for example by creating a new funding </p>
<p>line for “quick impact development projects” in semi&#8209;permissive environments. </p>
<p><b>621. </b> Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup, Chief of the Defence Staff, suggested an </p>
<p>allocation for that new line of £50m. </p>
<p><b>622. </b> Sir Michael Jay commented that the Iraq and Afghanistan context might make </p>
<p>the Treasury (and No.10) more receptive to a proposal.</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Discussions continued between the FCO, the MOD, DFID and PCRU until </p>
<p>mid&#8209;September, but did not produce a consensus on how any “QIP Fund” should </p>
<p>be managed or delivered on the ground, or on the criteria that might be used to </p>
<p>determine funding from it.</p>
<p>386</p>
<p> There was consensus that the £50m allocation proposed </p>
<p>by ACM Stirrup at the 6 June meeting was too large, given the need and the difficulties </p>
<p>of disbursing funds effectively. </p>
<p><b>624. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that Treasury officials were aware of or </p>
<p>engaged in those discussions.</p>

<p><b>625. </b> Mr Stephen Pattison, FCO Director International Security, wrote to Rear Admiral </p>
<p>Tim Laurence, MOD Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Resources and Plans) </p>
<p>on 18 September to provide a formal response to the tasking given at the 6 June </p>
<p>meeting.</p>
<p>388</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>626. </b> Mr Pattison advised that for Afghanistan, departments had agreed to create </p>
<p>a ring&#8209;fenced budget for QIPs within the GCPP Afghanistan Strategy, using existing </p>
<p>funding from that strategy and an additional £3m from DFID. </p>
<p><b>627. </b> In Iraq, UK commanders had been able to secure an “unusually generous” </p>
<p>proportion of US CERPs funding since the 6 June meeting. The GCPP Iraq Strategy </p>
<p>had also been boosted by additional funds from the GCPP Reserve and departments to </p>
<p>support the Better Basra Plan. If additional funding for QIPs was required, departments </p>
<p>had agreed to “follow the Afghanistan model”. That would mean seeking additional </p>
<p>funding first through the GCPP Iraq Strategy and from the GCPP Reserve, before </p>
<p>approaching the Treasury for additional funds. </p>
<p><b>628. </b> Rear Admiral Laurence had earlier advised the FCO, in response to sight of a </p>
<p>draft of Mr Pattison’s letter, that the first reaction of the Chiefs of Staff might be that </p>
<p>departments had ducked a battle with the Treasury.</p>
<p>389</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>629. </b> Ministers agreed on 9 January 2007 that the UK needed a capability to intervene </p>
<p>to prevent conflict and build capacity after conflicts.</p>
<p>390</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>630. </b> In response, on 15 February, the Cabinet Office produced a paper which </p>
<p>considered how to improve the UK civilian contribution to conflict management and </p>
<p>prevention.</p>
<p>391</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>631. </b> The Cabinet Office advised that funding “high priority and Ministerial endorsed </p>
<p>policy objectives which cross the boundaries of existing responsibilities” had been a </p>
<p>particular challenge. Funding for civilian activity in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as the </p>
<p>Better Basra Plan: </p>
<p>“… had to be negotiated across a range of departments and budget holders, with </p>
<p>time consuming turf battles, diverting effort that would have been better deployed </p>
<p>on developing effective policies, and delaying delivering.” </p>
<p><b>632. </b> Conflict prevention activities were currently resourced in an “ad&#8209;hoc fashion in and </p>
<p>between departments”, with limited transparency. There was no mechanism to “generate </p>
<p>the analysis to support a process of setting strategic priorities or to inform balance of </p>

<p>investment decisions”. As a result, it was difficult to make decisions about the marginal </p>
<p>utility of extra expenditure on one activity compared to another. </p>
<p><b>633. </b> The Cabinet Office offered a number of recommendations to improve </p>
<p>decision&#8209;making within Government and to increase civilian capability. On resources, </p>
<p>the Cabinet Office recommended that the GCPP and the ACPP and possibly other funds </p>
<p>which supported conflict prevention activities should be brought together and “managed </p>
<p>as a single ‘budget’”. </p>
<p><b>634. </b> The Inquiry has seen no indications that the paper was formally considered by </p>
<p>Ministers or officials. </p>
<p><b>635. </b> Mr Quinault provided advice to Mr Timms on 13 February 2007 on FCO and DFID </p>
<p>bids to the Reserve in respect of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>392</p>
<p> In that context, Mr Quinault commented: </p>
<p>“… we [the Treasury] have managed to hold the line that in keeping with the </p>
<p>traditional approach to these things, while MOD do get access to the Reserve … </p>
<p>the other departments have to reprioritise within their own budgets. Arguably this can </p>
<p>lead to perverse outcomes on occasion if it incentivises decision&#8209;makers to prefer </p>
<p>military responses to civilian ones. But it is a useful safety net for us [the Treasury] </p>
<p>and not to be given up without careful thought.”</p>
<p><b>636. </b> The “lines to take” attached to the briefing set out the Treasury’s response to </p>
<p>the challenge that it was “perverse that MOD gets its operational costs paid … from </p>
<p>the Reserve whereas essential civilian measures have to be paid for from FCO and </p>
<p>DFID budgets”:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Arrangements on costs of military operations are of long standing and reflect the </p>
<p>difficulty of planning for the large unplanned costs of operations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>In any case [the] Reserve is spent, cannot consider more funding …;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>That is, unless MOD agree clearly that what you [FCO and DFID] are proposing </p>
<p>is sufficiently vital to rank above more troops in the pecking order?”</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Mrs Margaret Beckett, the Foreign Secretary, wrote to Mr Timms on 1 March to </p>
<p>present the FCO’s bid to the 2007 Spending Review.</p>
<p>393</p>
<p> She confirmed her interest in </p>
<p>working with the Treasury to identify a better mechanism for funding civilian deployments </p>
<p>in “hot” post&#8209;conflict situations such as Afghanistan and Iraq. She proposed that, ideally, </p>
<p>bids to the Reserve should include both military and civilian costs. If that was not </p>
<p>possible, she suggested establishing a “ring&#8209;fenced, multi&#8209;year contingency fund” from </p>
<p>which the FCO could draw. </p>

<p><b>638. </b> The Treasury told the Inquiry that it has no record of a response to Mrs Beckett on </p>
<p>that point.</p>
<p>394</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>639. </b> Mr Pattison commented to FCO colleagues on 11 July that Mrs Beckett’s proposal </p>
<p>“didn’t get past first base” with the Treasury.</p>
<p>395</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Mark Lyall&#8209;Grant, FCO Political Director, advised Mr David Miliband, the new </p>
<p>Foreign Secretary, on 9 July that he should try to secure the support of Mr Browne and </p>
<p>Mr Douglas Alexander, the new Development Secretary, for a new funding mechanism </p>
<p>to support the civilian elements of the UK’s comprehensive approach in Afghanistan </p>
<p>and Iraq.</p>
<p>396</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Mr Lyall&#8209;Grant described the problem: </p>
<p>“There is no satisfactory Whitehall method to resource high priority, non&#8209;military work </p>
<p>in conflict areas, in support of Ministerially&#8209;agreed policy objectives. Afghanistan and </p>
<p>Iraq are cases in point. Ministers have long agreed that a comprehensive approach </p>
<p>is required … But there is no mechanism to fund in&#8209;year priorities for this. The MOD </p>
<p>can call on the Reserve for additional military expenditure. HMT [the Treasury] tell </p>
<p>other departments that their expenditure … must be funded from re&#8209;prioritisation. </p>
<p>At best this significantly slows down our ability to respond. In real terms it often </p>
<p>means the non&#8209;military elements of the campaign are under&#8209;funded, with a direct </p>
<p>impact on the length of time the military need to remain.”</p>
<p><b>642. </b> Mr Lyall&#8209;Grant identified two main possible solutions: allowing bids to the Reserve </p>
<p>to include both military and civilian costs; or establishing a ring&#8209;fenced, multi&#8209;year </p>
<p>contingency fund from which DFID, the FCO and others could draw. </p>
<p><b>643. </b> On 23 July, a Treasury official invited Mr Andy Burnham, the new Chief Secretary </p>
<p>to the Treasury, to agree to establish:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A single Conflict Pool, combining the GCPP and the ACPP. The Conflict Pool </p>
<p>would be managed by DFID, with advice from the MOD and FCO. A single Pool </p>
<p>would “drive a more consistent and coherent approach to conflict prevention and </p>
<p>poverty reduction, and … improve the management of the Pools overall”.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A Stabilisation Fund, which would be “owned by the MOD but managed jointly </p>
<p>with DFID and FCO”. Experience in Iraq and Afghanistan had highlighted </p>
<p>the need for resources to be available for “immediate civilian support to </p>
<p>military operations (QIPs, shorter&#8209;term development issues etc)”. Mrs Beckett </p>
<p>(the previous Foreign Secretary) and military commanders had repeatedly </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>550</p>
<p>highlighted that need. Funding for such activities had typically been found </p>
<p>from the GCPP, crowding out other planned spending. The allocation for the </p>
<p>Stabilisation Fund would be £65m in 2008/09, £65m in 2009/10 and £115m </p>
<p>in 2010/11. In total, £50m/£50m/£100m of that allocation would be ring&#8209;fenced </p>
<p>within the MOD’s 2007 Spending Review settlement. The balance (£15m in each </p>
<p>year) would be transferred from the GCPP. Any unspent funds could be switched </p>
<p>to core defence spending.</p>

<p> Mr Burnham stated that the MOD’s </p>
<p>settlement included £50m in 2008/09, £50m in 2009/10 and £100m in 2010/11 for a </p>
<p>“Reconstruction Fund”. Mr Burnham described the Reconstruction Fund as “one step </p>
<p>in a planned re&#8209;ordering of the way the Government handles planning and expenditure </p>
<p>on the prevention and stabilisation of conflict”. </p>

<p><b>654. </b> Sir Nicholas Macpherson, Director General in charge of Public Expenditure from </p>
<p>2001 to 2005 and then Permanent Secretary at the Treasury, told the Inquiry that, in time </p>
<p>of conflict, it was not the role of the Treasury to try to limit military spending: </p>
<p>“… the Treasury may have a view on some areas of spending, but on the whole, </p>
<p>when a war is in prospect, the narrow Treasury view that public spending is a bad </p>
<p>thing tends to be put to one side … and you start signing the cheques.”</p>
<p>406</p>
<p><b>655. </b> Lord Boateng, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury from May 2002 to May 2005, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that there was a distinction between the way the Treasury responded to </p>
<p>military and non&#8209;military situations.</p>
<p>407</p>
<p> While the military did not have a “blank cheque”: </p>
<p>“… when you have established that you need it, you are going to get [it] … </p>
<p>Because, at the end of the day, the lives of Servicemen and women and the security </p>
<p>of the state would be at risk if you got other people in the Treasury second&#8209;guessing </p>
<p>and doing what we do normally, which is actually to ensure that, first and foremost, </p>
<p>the public purse is protected.”</p>
<p><b>656. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Boateng what the rationale had been for the allocation </p>
<p>of funding between departments (non&#8209;military expenditure had been approximately </p>
<p>one&#8209;eighth of military expenditure). Lord Boateng told the Inquiry that: </p>
<p>“… this balance arose partly as a result of the funding mechanism deployed, in the </p>
<p>sense that the Ministry of Defence had an access to the Reserve that was on a </p>
<p>different scale from the others [DFID and FCO]. </p>
<p>“… did anyone sit down and say, ‘Well, this is the sum of money that we have, </p>
<p>this ought to be the balance?’ No, I don’t think they did. Should they have done? </p>
<p>Maybe, but actually it is … very difficult to do. </p>
<p>“Is the way in which we fund post&#8209;conflict reconstruction work optimal? Then, no, </p>
<p>I don’t think it was. Did this mean that our effectiveness suffered? No, I don’t believe </p>
<p>it did, but I do believe that it led to considerable pressure on one of the two other </p>
<p>departments, namely, the FCO, who are in a different position … from DFID because </p>
<p>their resource base was so very different.”</p>

<p><b>657. </b> Lord Boateng highlighted the need for the UK Government to examine how it </p>
<p>funded the MOD, DFID and the FCO to work together in post&#8209;conflict situations:</p>
<p>“… at the moment, we have a very, very dangerous imbalance, an imbalance made </p>
<p>all the more difficult by the requirements of law in relation to DFID, that makes it </p>
<p>very, very difficult to pool resources …”</p>
<p>409</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>658. </b> Mr John Dodds, Head of the Treasury Defence, Diplomacy and Intelligence Team, </p>
<p>told the Inquiry that, in his personal view, there was a “tension” between the way that </p>
<p>military and non&#8209;military activities were funded, and that there was the potential for some </p>
<p>“sub&#8209;optimal” decisions: </p>
<p>“… the cost of a military solution to a conflict problem … was probably about ten </p>
<p>times the cost of a non&#8209;military solution … </p>
<p>“I think that … potentially the funding mechanisms that we had … tended to create </p>
<p>incentives for more military intervention and less non&#8209;military intervention, but </p>
<p>I don’t think that’s an issue … which is really relevant to Iraq. I think it is … a piece </p>
<p>of broader reflection …”</p>
<p>410</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>659. </b> In his evidence to the Inquiry, Sir Mark Lyall&#8209;Grant suggested that there could be </p>
<p>different approaches to allocating funding, such that: </p>
<p>“… you wouldn’t take decisions on the basis of how much you could afford, but </p>
<p>Ministers would sit round the table, take the decisions that they think are the right </p>
<p>decisions to take in a strategic environment, and then the funding would follow </p>
<p>from that. </p>
<p>“What happens at the moment is that the Ministers take the decisions, then the </p>
<p>departments get together [to consider] ‘How are we going to fund it?’, and end up </p>
<p>by saying ‘Well, actually, we can’t fund it’.”</p>

<p><b>660. </b> During his farewell call on Mr Straw in mid&#8209;February 2004, Sir Hilary Synnott, the </p>

<p> He argued that the FCO had learned several lessons, including on </p>
<p>funding civilian post&#8209;conflict operations. A “genuinely flexible” budget allocation similar </p>

<p>playing one Government department off against another”. The Ad Hoc Ministerial Group </p>
<p>could have been controlled the budget. </p>
<p><b>662. </b> Mr Neil Crompton, the Head of IPU, reflected on the availability of funding in his </p>
<p>May 2005 valedictory minute to Mr John Sawers: </p>
<p>“HMG (and the FCO) took a long time to wake up to the scale of the task we had </p>
<p>taken on. Demands from No.10 and Ministers for action have always exceeded </p>
<p>the resources available. The Treasury have played hard ball, exploiting different </p>
<p>departments’ own internal reasons for not wanting to make claims on the Reserve to </p>
<p>kill off initiatives. No.10’s unwillingness to intervene with HMT [the Treasury], except </p>
<p>once, has compounded the problem, and undermined the morale of officials tasked </p>
<p>with running an ‘exemplary operation’ without the resources to do so. </p>
<p>“It is naive to expect the Treasury to behave differently. But Ministers (and the </p>
<p>FCO) need to recognise that in a conflict we cannot afford the luxury of ensuring </p>
<p>expenditure is subject ‘to the same rigorous criteria as anywhere else’, as we have </p>
<p>occasionally been told.”</p>
<p>413</p>
<p><b>663. </b> Mr Crompton recommended that, in future, the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group or </p>
<p>equivalent should be allocated a budget to fund immediate priorities not covered by </p>
<p>departments’ core budgets or by funds such as the GCPP. That would avoid the need for </p>
<p>“extended negotiations” with the Treasury.</p>
<p><b>664. </b> In his response to Mr Crompton, Mr Sawers, FCO Political Director, agreed that the </p>
<p>FCO needed to give a much higher priority to an issue when it “prevails over all others”, </p>
<p>in terms of both money and people.</p>
<p>414</p>
<p> The FCO had done that in the pre&#8209;conflict phase, </p>
<p>but it had been less apparent in the post&#8209;conflict phase.</p>
<p><b>665. </b> A June 2005 FCO Conflict Issues Group paper drawing together post&#8209;conflict </p>
<p>lessons for the FCO concluded:</p>
<p>“We need to make it clear to other government departments the true cost of what </p>
<p>they are asking us to achieve. We can spend too much time trying to secure extra </p>
<p>resources and fail to secure them in a timely manner. Policy without resources is </p>
<p>usually futile. All OGDs [other government departments] need to be required to </p>
<p>allocate resources to tasks which the Cabinet rules to be important.”</p>
<p>415</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>666. </b> An FCO review of lessons to be learned from the UK’s experience in Basra, </p>
<p>produced in late 2008, concluded:</p>

<p>416</p>
<p><b>667. </b> FCO officials complained of a mismatch between the Government’s expectations </p>
<p>and the resources available to the FCO to meet them. While the MOD had funds </p>
<p>for QIPs and DFID for longer&#8209;term strategic programmes, the FCO was “somehow </p>
<p>expected” to take on elements of both “with neither the resources nor the means”. </p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Committee had commented on more than one occasion that it was </p>
<p>necessary and appropriate that costs incurred by the FCO in Iraq (and Afghanistan) that </p>
<p>were additional to its mainstream diplomatic and consular roles should be funded from </p>
<p>the Reserve. The review commented: “It is not clear whether the FCO itself formulated </p>
<p>and presented a sufficiently strong case for extra funding to support additional work in </p>
<p>the field.”</p>
<p><b>668. </b> On 25 March 2009, Mr Miliband chaired a meeting with “former and current key </p>
<p>decision&#8209;makers on Iraq” to consider that review and identify the lessons for the FCO </p>
<p>from Iraq.</p>
<p>417</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>669. </b> The meeting concluded that the civilian operation in Iraq had been slow to get </p>
<p>started, and had been: </p>
<p>“… hampered in the UK by a shortage of resources – particularly in comparison with </p>
<p>the military effort – and an inability to extract what meagre resources were available </p>
<p>from HMT [the Treasury] …” </p>
<p><b>670. </b> Lord Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary from 2002 to 2006, described his </p>
<p>experience of securing funds for operations in Iraq, and the lessons he had drawn from </p>
<p>it, in his evidence to the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I never felt I had sufficient resources to do anything I was doing in the Foreign </p>
<p>Office … You are constantly – it was a constant battle throughout the five years </p>
<p>I was there of allocating scarce resources to the priorities that mattered and, over </p>
<p>the years we were dealing with Iraq, we were constantly spending more money and </p>
<p>more resources on Iraq. Some of those we were getting – we got extra provision </p>
<p>from the Treasury, often it was a question of reprioritising the resources within the </p>
<p>Foreign Office.</p>
<p>“At the worst, that meant closing posts in parts of the world which were less </p>
<p>important in order that we could put people into Baghdad, Basra, Kabul and other </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>556</p>
<p><b>671. </b> Lord Jay also told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… when there is a crisis of the same magnitude as Iraq, which affects a number </p>
<p>of different departments, then the Treasury needs to look, not at the budgets of </p>
<p>individual departments, but at the overall need and to ensure that each department </p>
<p>concerned in the operation gets the funds that it needs to carry it out … But it </p>
<p>doesn’t seem to me at all sensible to be thinking of giving large sums of money for </p>
<p>a military operation, if you are not giving similar sums of money for the diplomatic </p>
<p>support that that military operation needs, and those need to be looked at together, </p>
<p>and I don’t think they were, and I think they should be in the future.”</p>
<p>419</p>
<p><b>672. </b> Mr Dodds told the Inquiry that bids from the FCO were assessed with the same </p>
<p>rigour as bids from other departments: </p>
<p>“… our starting position was that we would want the Foreign Office to … look for the </p>
<p>potential to reprioritise … I think our perspective would be that that wasn’t … their </p>
<p>first response to this sort of situation. I think there was an expectation on the part </p>
<p>of the Foreign Office that … the Reserve should provide them with new money … </p>
<p>“But … the Foreign Office had a … significant budget … and a significant global </p>
<p>footprint and I think it wasn’t unreasonable to be looking to the Foreign Office … at </p>
<p>least on a temporary basis, to move some resources … to support the activity on </p>
<p>this high priority [Iraq].</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“Generally speaking, they were able to successfully reprioritise, but … their first </p>
<p>reaction was to look for resources from the Reserve, but it was only after they </p>
<p>were … pushed back that they … then were successful in reprioritising.”</p>
<p>420</p>
<p><b>673. </b> Sir Suma Chakrabarti told the Inquiry that Iraq was DFID’s largest bilateral </p>
<p>programme in 2003/04 (when DFID spent £209m, of which £110m was spent on </p>
<p>humanitarian relief and £99m on development activities), and DFID’s 10th largest </p>
<p>bilateral programme in 2004/05 (when DFID spent £49m, of which £21m was spent </p>
<p>on humanitarian relief and £28m on development activities).</p>
<p>421</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>674. </b> The Inquiry asked Sir Suma whether DFID had considered seeking additional </p>
<p>funding from the Treasury for Iraq.</p>
<p>422</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We had discussions [with] the Treasury but it was quite obvious to us that they </p>
<p>weren’t going to give any more than they already had … They had put some money </p>
<p>in upfront [in March 2003, for humanitarian assistance], but, after that, they said it is </p>
<p>time to reprioritise.” </p>

<p><b>675. </b> Sir Suma also told the Inquiry that Ministers had considered reallocating funding </p>
<p>to Iraq from low&#8209;income countries, but had decided that that would not be consistent </p>
<p>with DFID’s mission to maximise its impact on poverty. Ministers had instead decided </p>
<p>to reallocate funding to Iraq from DFID programmes in other middle&#8209;income countries: </p>
<p>“… that meant closing some programmes … in Eastern Europe, Central Europe, and </p>
<p>also Latin America … in order to help finance the Iraq programme.”</p>
<p><b>676. </b> The Inquiry describes earlier in this Section the creation of the Global Conflict </p>
<p>Prevention Pool (GCPP) in order to promote a more joined&#8209;up approach to funding </p>
<p>peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations and conflict prevention programmes. </p>
<p><b>677. </b> Sir Mark Lyall&#8209;Grant told the Inquiry that while he agreed that the principle behind </p>
<p>the GCPP was a good one, decisions about how to spend relatively small sums of </p>
<p>money had led to “huge disputes between Government departments”, which had </p>
<p>consumed significant amounts of senior officials’ time.</p>
<p>423</p>
<p> He concluded that Pools </p>
<p>(the GCPP and the ACPP) had “essentially collapsed” under the pressure of rising costs, </p>
<p>and had been “a failed experiment”.</p>
<p><b>678. </b> Sir Peter Ricketts, FCO Permanent Under Secretary from 2006 to 2010, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have said that they are a failed experiment, but they are certainly under </p>
<p>real stress because of rising costs, particularly of assessed contributions to the UN </p>
<p>and other international organisations … That has required some difficult prioritisation </p>
<p>decisions … But I think the Pools have been useful in bringing the three departments </p>
<p>together and forcing us to make choices about what our top priorities are …”</p>

<p><b>Scrutiny of UK expenditure in relation to Iraq</b></p>
<p><b>679. </b> This section describes the Government’s mechanisms for scrutinising UK </p>
<p>expenditure, and how those mechanisms were engaged in relation to Iraq. The Inquiry </p>
<p>has not conducted its own audit of any element of UK expenditure in relation to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>680. </b> A number of bodies contribute to the scrutiny of government expenditure, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The Public Accounts Committee (PAC). The main work of the PAC is the </p>
<p>examination of the reports produced by the National Audit Office (NAO). </p>
<p>The Committee typically examines 50 value for money reports each year, </p>
<p>as well as reports on some departments’ resource accounts.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Departmental select committees. The core tasks of the select committees </p>
<p>include examining and reporting on estimates, annual expenditure plans and </p>
<p>accounts, and monitoring performance against targets in the Public Service </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>The NAO. The NAO audits the accounts of all government departments and </p>
<p>agencies, and many other public bodies. The NAO also produces around </p>
<p>60 value for money studies each year on the economy, efficiency and </p>
<p>effectiveness of public expenditure.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Departments’ own internal audit units.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>681. </b> The estimates cycle is the process by which Parliament approves departments’ </p>
<p>resources and cash provision for the year. Departments submit Supply Estimates which </p>
<p>set out how they plan to spend their funding and seek approval from Parliament for the </p>
<p>necessary funds.</p>
<p><b>682. </b> Because of the unpredictable nature of military operations, the MOD does not </p>
<p>provide an estimate of NACMO to Parliament at the beginning of each financial year, </p>
<p>as part of its Main Estimates.</p>
<p>426</p>
<p> Between 2002/03 and 2005/06, the MOD sought </p>
<p>Parliament’s approval for NACMO expenditure in February (towards the end of the </p>
<p>financial year) as part of the Spring Supplementary Estimates. </p>
<p><b>683. </b> The MOD Estimates are reported on by the House of Commons Defence </p>
<p>Committee (HCDC). </p>
<p><b>684. </b> In its report on the MOD’s 2005/06 Spring Supplementary Estimates, the HCDC </p>
<p>called for the MOD to provide estimated NACMO for “commenced operations” as part </p>
<p>of its Main Estimates, if necessary with a large element for contingency.</p>
<p>427</p>
<p> The HCDC </p>
<p>stated that, for the MOD:</p>
<p>“… Parliamentary approval seems to be regarded as a rubber stamp. For this, </p>
<p>Parliament must take some of the blame: for too long we have allowed </p>
<p>Parliamentary approval of the Estimates to be taken for granted. <b>MOD must </b></p>
<p><b>recognise that the agreement of the Treasury is not a substitute for </b></p>
<p><b>Parliamentary approval, and that providing information to the Treasury is </b></p>
<p><b>not enough</b>.” </p>
<p><b>685. </b> From 2006/07, in response to that criticism, the MOD presented initial estimated </p>
<p>NACMO to Parliament in November as part of its Winter Supplementary Estimates, </p>

<p> The FCU found no evidence of fraud, but did </p>
<p>identify write&#8209;offs totalling approximately £13,000 relating to mobile phone bills, where </p>
<p>either the phone had been lost and subsequently used or the individual user could </p>
<p>not now be identified. In addition, Iraqi staff had incurred charges totalling more than </p>
<p>£24,000 on personal calls from mobile phones. The FCU concluded that was unlikely to </p>
<p>be recoverable, and should be paid for by the Embassy. </p>
<p><b>689. </b> The FCO’s phone service provider alerted the FCO at the end of June 2005 that </p>
<p>they had concerns over the level of activity logged against one FCO satellite phone.</p>
<p>430</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a precaution, the service provider had barred the phone on 24 June. The FCO </p>
<p>switched off all its active satellite phones in Iraq on 15 July, and terminated the </p>
<p>associated line rental agreements. </p>
<p><b>690. </b> Sir Michael Jay reported to the PAC on 15 February 2006 that the FCU was </p>
<p>investigating a loss of £594,000 as a result of two satellite phones being stolen or </p>
<p>misappropriated.</p>
<p>431</p>
<p> Sir Michael outlined some of the weaknesses in FCO systems that </p>
<p>had already been identified, highlighting the failure of officials in London to challenge the </p>
<p>bills which they received, and some of the improvements which had already been made. </p>
<p><b>691. </b> At the request of the PAC, the NAO reported to it in July 2006 on the outcome </p>
<p>of the FCU’s investigation (in the context of the NAO’s report on the FCO’s 2005/06 </p>
<p>Resource Accounts).</p>
<p>432</p>
<p> The FCU had found that the IPU had ordered 10 satellite phones </p>
<p>in September 2003 for use in Iraq. The phones had been made ready for use before </p>
<p>being dispatched. Weaknesses in the controls over the physical location, storage, billing </p>
<p>and payment for the phones had led to the loss of two of the phones (together with </p>
<p>another that had been rented previously) remaining undetected until June 2005. Despite </p>
<p>extensive enquiries the FCU had not been able to establish who was responsible for the </p>
<p>theft and subsequent misuse of the phones. The FCU had calculated the full extent of </p>
<p>the loss at £594,370; the bill for one phone for June 2005 had been over £212,000.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>560</p>
<p><b>692. </b> The FCU’s investigation had highlighted numerous failures in the FCO’s internal </p>
<p>control system, which had allowed the theft of the phones and their subsequent misuse </p>
<p>to continue undetected for a period of some 18 months. The FCU had identified, and </p>
<p>agreed with the NAO, actions to reduce the risk of another similar incident. </p>
<p><b>693. </b> The NAO visited the DFID Iraq team in London in May 2007, to undertake a review </p>
<p>of internal financial control procedures as part of its audit of DFID’s 2006/07 Resource </p>
<p>Accounts.</p>
<p>433</p>
<p> The NAO team was unable to visit Iraq due to the security situation. </p>
<p><b>694. </b> The NAO concluded that, overall, DFID was operating good controls over </p>
<p>transactions through the local (Iraqi) imprest and bank account, and that budgetary </p>
<p>control, asset management and corporate governance controls were operating </p>
<p>effectively. Projects had been properly approved, and there was evidence that project </p>
<p>outputs and outcomes were being monitored. </p>
<p><b>695. </b> Mr Martin Dinham, DFID Director Europe, Middle East and Americas, told the </p>
<p>Inquiry:</p>
<p>“… a National Audit Office investigation … said that the systems that we had in place </p>
<p>were sensible, suitable, that all the various safeguards that they would have liked </p>
<p>to have seen were there. So we got – remarkable in the circumstances – we got </p>
<p>a very clean bill of health from the NAO, which … is completely independent of </p>
<p>the system.”</p>
<p>434</p>
<p><b>696. </b> The Inquiry is also aware of one major fraud perpetrated against a DFID </p>
<p>programme.</p>
<p><b>697. </b> DFID’s Southern Iraq Employment and Services Programme (SIESP) was </p>
<p>approved in July 2004, providing £10m for infrastructure services and £6m for </p>
<p>employment generation.</p>
<p>435</p>
<p> A total of £0.5m was allocated for programme administration. </p>
<p><b>698. </b> In May 2005, the DFID Office in Basra closed the employment generation </p>
<p>component of the SIESP after an assessment identified “worrying issues”. The Office </p>
<p>asked DFID’s Internal Audit Department (IAD) to visit Basra to review the SIESP and </p>
<p>identify lessons for other programmes. </p>
<p><b>699. </b> The IAD identified several flaws in the design of the component. It concluded that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A “key driver” of the SIESP had been “political (and consequent senior </p>
<p>management) pressure in Whitehall and beyond to achieve visible results </p>
<p>… In retrospect, these pressures appear unreasonable but at the time were </p>
<p>generally irresistible.” Warnings against proceeding with a programme of </p>
<p>“such high fiduciary risk and intangible benefit” had not been heeded. </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>Implementation had been undermined by the lack of physical monitoring due </p>
<p>to the security situation. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Weaknesses in the DFID Office in Basra had contributed to the problems within </p>
<p>the SIESP. The Office had been set up “hastily under pressure from UK and </p>
<p>locally to show a DFID presence”. It had proved very difficult to recruit staff for </p>
<p>Iraq, leading to the appointment of staff with “little or no experience in managing </p>
<p>programmes or staff”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The DFID Office in Basra had established “good controls” over SIESP </p>
<p>finances. The Office’s decision to close the employment generation component </p>
<p>immediately after its initial assessment had saved £3m (the amount remaining </p>
<p>in the employment generation budget). </p>
<p><b>700. </b> Of the £3m that had been spent, the IAD estimated that over £2m had been spent </p>
<p>in a way “that did not meet [the SIESP’s] objectives”. The lack of physical monitoring </p>
<p>made it difficult to be more precise. </p>
<p><b>701. </b> In May 2006, DFID conducted an internal review in order to determine the extent </p>
<p>of the loss from the SIESP employment component.</p>
<p>436</p>
<p> The review concluded that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£254,105 had been spent on projects where there was clear evidence of full </p>
<p>or partial misuse of money, based on monitoring by DFID staff. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£296,187 had been spent on projects where there was “<b>no clear evidence </b></p>
<p><b>of either good use or misuse of money </b>(because there was no monitoring </p>
<p>information on file) but where anecdotal evidence from interviews suggested that </p>
<p>some percentage of the projects were not successfully completed”. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>£1,021,223 had been spent on projects which DFID was “reasonably confident” </p>
<p>had been successfully completed, based on information on file (in the form of </p>
<p>photographs or visit reports) or anecdotal evidence. </p>
<p><b>702. </b> Dr Nemat Shafik, DFID Permanent Secretary from March 2008, told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We have a zero tolerance policy on corruption and we act on it immediately. </p>
<p>The then Provincial Council was very unhappy with us as a result… But on that, </p>
<p>we don’t compromise. </p>
<p>“[The SIESP] is … the only case that we are aware of, where we had a significant </p>
<p>fraud, which, given the scale of the funds that we were disbursing, and given the </p>
<p>context, is, I think, a pretty good track record.</p>
<p>“In the case of the Iraq portfolio … we actually had a higher level of scrutiny than our </p>
<p>normal portfolio because of the risks involved. So we would get monthly reporting </p>
<p>on risks, security risk, staff risk, risks to our money …”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>562</p>
<p><b>703. </b> The fraud is described in more detail in Section 10.2.</p>
<p><b>US oversight of expenditure on reconstruction </b></p>
<p>In contrast to the UK Government, the US Government established new bodies to oversee </p>
<p>US expenditure on reconstruction in Iraq. </p>
<p>When the US Congress appropriated £18.4bn for Iraq relief and reconstruction in </p>
<p>November 2003, it also passed legislation to create a specialised Inspector General </p>
<p>– the Inspector General of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA&#8209;IG) – to provide </p>
<p>accountability for the use of those funds.</p>
<p>438</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The CPA&#8209;IG was re&#8209;designated as the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction </p>
<p>(SIGIR), with a modified mandate, in October 2004.</p>
<p>439</p>
<p> SIGIR’s mandate was, with respect </p>
<p>to US relief and reconstruction plans, programmes, and operations in Iraq, to provide </p>
<p>independent and objective:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>oversight and review through comprehensive audits, inspections and </p>
<p>investigations;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>advice and recommendations on policies to promote economy, efficiency and </p>
<p>effectiveness;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prevention, detection and deterrence of fraud, waste and abuse; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>information and analysis to Congress, the US Secretary of State, the US </p>
<p>Secretary of Defense and the American people.</p>
<p>440</p>
<p>SIGIR’s jurisdiction extended to the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund (IRRF), the Iraq </p>
<p>Security Forces Fund, and the Commanders’ Emergency Response Program (CERPs), </p>
<p>and assistance for the reconstruction of Iraq under the Economic Support Fund, the </p>
<p>International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement account or any other provision </p>
<p>of law. </p>
<p>SIGIR published its final report in March 2013.</p>
<p>441</p>
<p> It recorded that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIGIR had undertaken 220 audits and 170 inspections, which had led to </p>
<p>82 convictions and over US$191m in financial penalties.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Those audits had questioned US$641m in costs and identified an additional </p>
<p>US$974m in funds which could be put to better use – a combined potential </p>
<p>financial benefit of US$1.61bn. As at September 2012, the savings to the US </p>
<p>Government from renegotiated contracts, refunds and operational savings </p>
<p>resulting from SIGIR’s work were US$645m.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>At its peak in 2008, SIGIR had 35 auditors permanently stationed in Baghdad. </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>SIGIR’s budget was on average US$25m a year over its lifetime. </p>

<p>13.1  |  Resources</p>
<p>563</p>
<p>The report also recorded that SIGIR had developed innovative oversight practices: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a focus on producing rapid “performance reviews” rather than slow&#8209;moving </p>
<p>financial audits; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a focus on converting findings from audits and investigations into lessons for </p>
<p>colleagues on the ground, consolidated in nine “lessons learned” reports.</p>
<p>The report offered a number of lessons for future stabilisation and reconstruction </p>
<p>operations, including the need to provide a “robust in&#8209;country team of auditors, inspectors, </p>
<p>and investigators from the operation’s outset”. Such a team would detect or deter fraud, </p>
<p>waste and abuse, improving mission efficiency and effectiveness. The absence of a strong </p>
<p>team early in the Iraq operation had allowed too much fraud, waste and abuse to occur. </p>
<p>SIGIR convened the Iraq Inspectors General Council in March 2004, to enhance </p>
<p>collaboration and co&#8209;operation among the inspectors general of the agencies that oversaw </p>
<p>Iraq reconstruction funds.</p>
<p>442</p>
<p> The Council met quarterly to exchange details about current </p>
<p>and planned audits, identify opportunities for collaboration and minimise redundancies. </p>
<p>Council members included: CENTCOM Inspector General; Department of Defense Office </p>
<p>of Inspector General; Department of State Office of Inspector General; Government </p>
<p>Accountability Office; USAID Office of Inspector General; and the US Army Audit Agency. </p>
<p><b>Analyses of expenditure</b></p>
<p><b>Total direct cost (by financial year)</b></p>
<p><b>704. </b> The direct cost of the UK’s intervention in Iraq was at least £9.2bn between the </p>

<p>by financial year. </p>
<p><b>705. </b> That figure does not include expenditure by departments other than the MOD, the </p>
<p>FCO, and DFID. Although other departments made important contributions to the UK </p>
<p>effort, in particular in the post&#8209;conflict period, their expenditure was relatively small. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>566</p>
<p><b>708. </b> The Inquiry asked Lord Jay, FCO Permanent Under Secretary from 2002 to 2006, </p>
<p>how he and the FCO Board reached a view of the balance between the value of the </p>
<p>activities and the cost of achieving them.</p>
<p>452</p>
<p> Lord Jay told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“… there are always judgments that you have to make as to whether people are </p>
<p>secure and how much you spend on that, but my judgment is that … if we had felt </p>
<p>on the [FCO] Board in London that we were not able to afford the security for people, </p>
<p>then we shouldn’t have people on the ground.” </p>
<p><b>709. </b> Mr Jim Drummond, DFID Director Iraq, was briefed in advance of his appearance </p>
<p>before the International Development Committee (IDC) on 16 November 2004 that </p>
<p>DFID had, to date, spent approximately £16.9m on staff security in Iraq, including armed </p>
<p>protection, armoured vehicles, hostile environment and emergency first aid training, and </p>
<p>posting Security Managers in Iraq and the UK.</p>
<p>453</p>
<p> That security spending had supported </p>
<p>project spending of £32.1m; security spending therefore comprised approximately </p>
<p>one&#8209;third of total project spending. </p>
<p><b>710. </b> The briefing stated: </p>
<p>“Quantifying the costs and benefits associated with a reform programme is heavily </p>
<p>subjective. So there is no specific point at which security costs make projects </p>
<p>become unviable. However, given the very high costs of operating at present the </p>
<p>programme is kept tightly focused on work that needs to be done now, and that has </p>
<p>very high rates of return. For example, our economic work has been focused on </p>
<p>assisting the Iraqi Government in agreeing an IMF programme, which is the first step </p>
<p>in moving towards debt relief. Clearly with debts of US$120bn the economic benefits </p>
<p>of this work outweigh the costs.”</p>
<p><b>711. </b> The NAO published its report ‘DFID: Operating in insecure environments’ in </p>
<p>October 2008.</p>
<p>454</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>712. </b> The NAO reported that “in extreme circumstances”, security and administrative </p>
<p>costs could outweigh “actual projects costs”. It offered as an example DFID’s Technical </p>
<p>Advisory Team Programme in Iraq. Of the total £7m allocation, £1.9m had been spent </p>
<p>on consultancy work and more than £5m on security and related expenses. </p>
<p><b>713. </b> The NAO reported that DFID did not systematically collate or analyse the extra </p>
<p>costs of running its business in insecure environments. Significant security costs in Iraq </p>
<p>and other countries were categorised by DFID as programme, rather than administrative, </p>
<p>expenditure, making them more difficult to identify. Security costs incurred by DFID’s </p>
<p>implementing partners would also be categorised as programme expenditure. </p>

<p><b>714. </b> The NAO recommended that “DFID needs better management information on its </p>
<p>costs to inform its decisions and achieve value for money [in insecure environments]”.</p>
<p><b>715. </b> The Inquiry asked Mr Hilary Benn, the International Development Secretary from </p>
<p>2003 to 2007, if the high security costs in Iraq had undermined DFID’s ability to deliver </p>
<p>value for money, and whether the funds spent on Iraq could have been better used </p>
<p>elsewhere.</p>
<p>455</p>
<p> He told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“No, because we had a particular responsibility … [and] our duty to fulfil that </p>
<p>responsibility. Because what we were trying to do … was to assist Iraq to build </p>
<p>something better for itself, and this was a very important objective. And it would </p>
<p>have been wrong to say, ‘Well, we will get up and walk away’ …”</p>
<p><b>716. </b> Mr Benn also told the Inquiry that DFID funding for Iraq had been reallocated from </p>
<p>other middle&#8209;income countries, rather than from low&#8209;income countries.</p>
<p><b>717. </b> Section 15 considers the steps taken by the UK Government to provide security </p>
<p>for civilian staff in Iraq.</p>
