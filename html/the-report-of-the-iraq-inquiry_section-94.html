<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>490</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p><b>1. </b> This Section addresses:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK role in preparing for a referendum on Iraq’s new Constitution and for </p>
<p>Parliamentary elections on 15 December, leading to the appointment of an Iraqi </p>
<p>Government led by Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>plans for the phased withdrawal of UK forces, and parallel decisions on the UK </p>
<p>response to the new US “ink-spot” strategy for Iraq and on the deployment of </p>
<p>troops to Helmand province in Afghanistan;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>rising sectarian violence in Iraq and a growing UK focus on outreach to the </p>
<p>Sunni community; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>concerns about the risks of strategic failure and civil war in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> This Section does not address the UK contribution to the reconstruction of Iraq and </p>
<p>reform of its security sector, covered in Sections 10 and 12 respectively.</p>
<p><b>3. </b> The Inquiry’s conclusions in relation to the events described in this Section can be </p>
<p>read in Section 9.8.</p>
<p><b>June 2005</b></p>
<p><b>4. </b> In June 2005, Mr Edward Chaplin, the first British Ambassador to Iraq since the </p>
<p>early 1990s, was succeeded in post by Mr William Patey. At around the same time, </p>
<p>Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad succeeded Ambassador John Negroponte as the </p>
<p>US Ambassador to Iraq. </p>
<p><b>5. </b> Giving evidence to the House of Commons Defence Committee in 2012, </p>
<p>Sir William Patey said:</p>
<p>“When I was sent to Iraq was the first time I have ever had my objectives delivered </p>
<p>directly to me by the Prime Minister. One of the objectives he set me was to get </p>
<p>some troop withdrawals by the following year – by June 2006. It was clear to me that </p>
<p>we were looking for extra troops, which we did not have, to send to Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>1</p>
<p><b>6. </b> Section 9.3 sets out UK views on the importance of participation by the Iraqi Sunni </p>
<p>community in the political process, and the beginning of direct engagement with some </p>
<p>individuals in pursuit of that aim. </p>
<p><b>7. </b> The FCO had been considering the scope for broadening its earlier contact with </p>
<p>Sunni insurgents with a further round of talks.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p> In early June, briefing on the options </p>
<p>for further Sunni engagement was provided in response to a request from Mr Blair’s </p>
<p>1 </p>
<p>House of Commons, <i>Corrected transcript of oral evidence</i>, 4 September 2012, ‘Securing the Future of </p>
<p>Afghanistan’, page 4.</p>

<p>Private Office. This time, the discussion would have the specific objective of agreeing a </p>
<p>temporary cease-fire in part of Anbar province in the hope that this would help separate </p>
<p>Sunni nationalists from foreign jihadists and act as a model for similar developments </p>
<p>elsewhere in Iraq. It would be for the Iraqi Transitional Government (ITG) and the </p>
<p>Multi-National Force (MNF) to decide whether any demands made in return for such a </p>
<p>cease-fire could be met. </p>
<p><b>8. </b> On 6 June, Sir Nigel Sheinwald, Mr Blair’s Foreign Policy Adviser, sent a Note from </p>
<p>Mr Blair to President Bush via Mr Stephen Hadley, the US National Security Advisor.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>9. </b> The Note, which covered a wide range of countries and issues, was a reflection on </p>
<p>“a huge opportunity … to leave a clear and morally powerful agenda in place when we go”. </p>
<p><b>10. </b> On Iraq, Mr Blair wrote that:</p>
<p>“Iraq has been tough and we all know now the reserves of political and military </p>
<p>strength required for any military action. The international community should be </p>
<p>united behind us, urging us on, but they’re not.” </p>
<p><b>11. </b> A brief for the visit by Mr Antony Phillipson, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign </p>
<p>Affairs, suggested that the key point on Iraq was the need for the US to remain active </p>
<p>and engaged in the detail, after a non-interventionist period between the election and the </p>
<p>formation of the ITG “during which we lost valuable momentum”.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>12. </b> In practice, that meant the US and UK should press the ITG to deliver Sunni </p>
<p>outreach (including sensitive handling of de-Ba’athification and a media strategy for the </p>
<p>Sunni community) and be active in reaching out to Sunnis themselves. </p>
<p><b>13. </b> On 7 June, Mr Blair and President Bush held talks on a range of foreign policy </p>
<p>issues in the White House.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>14. </b> In the discussion on Iraq, Mr Blair said that a stable, secure and democratic Iraq </p>
<p>would have a “transforming effect” on Iran and Syria. But the increasing tension between </p>
<p>Sunni and Shia needed to be watched. He judged that:</p>
<p>“Ultimately, without an improvement in security, little progress could be made.”</p>
<p><b>15. </b> Mr Blair commented that the Iraqiisation process was “going OK”. Mr Blair and </p>
<p>Sir Nigel Sheinwald indicated that the UK hoped to start reducing troops in the next </p>
<p>12 months, and to make a more significant reduction in Multi-National Division (South </p>
<p>East) (MND(SE)) in the first half of 2006. It was important to stick to the political </p>
<p>timetable, as providing security for the next round of elections was a constraint </p>
<p>on withdrawals. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>492</p>
<p><b>16. </b> On 13 June, Mr Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary, sent Mr Blair an update on </p>
<p>progress towards a new Iraqi Constitution, including the procedural challenges ahead.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>17. </b> Mr Straw reported that there had been progress. The National Assembly (TNA) had </p>
<p>formed a Constitutional Committee, to which the UN had offered its expertise. But the </p>
<p>detail had yet to be agreed. </p>
<p><b>18. </b> In Mr Straw’s view, the key challenges were to ensure that the draft text was seen to </p>
<p>reflect the views of Iraq’s three main communities (Shia Arabs, Sunni Arabs and Kurds) </p>
<p>and sticking to the timetable set out in the Transitional Administrative Law (TAL). </p>
<p><b>19. </b> The TAL said that a draft Constitution should be produced by 15 August, ahead of a </p>
<p>referendum on 15 October and elections by 15 December. </p>
<p><b>20. </b> Mr Straw described the UK urging key players to maintain momentum, while putting </p>
<p>in place a process which would deliver a credible text on time. The UK would also </p>
<p>provide practical assistance as necessary. </p>
<p><b>21. </b> Attached to Mr Straw’s minute was a paper written by the IPU at the request of the </p>
<p>Iraq Strategy Group which provided more detail on the drafting process and what could </p>
<p>be done to improve it.</p>
<p><b>22. </b> The paper said that the Constitutional Committee had formed sub-committees </p>
<p>tasked with particular themes (for example, federalism) and Prime Minister Ja’afari had </p>
<p>appointed a Ministerial Constitutional Committee. </p>
<p><b>23. </b> Mr Nicholas ‘Fink’ Haysom, Head of the UN Office of Constitutional Support </p>
<p>(UNOCS), had offered the Constitutional Committee UN support and guidance, and </p>
<p>initially received a “cautiously welcoming” response. </p>
<p><b>24. </b> The IPU paper set out the two main challenges to the process. The first was </p>
<p>ensuring credibility, by “correcting the Sunni Arab deficit” in the membership of the </p>
<p>Constitutional Committee and starting public outreach early. The second was keeping </p>
<p>to the schedule. If the timetable slipped, the UN’s plan was to extend the drafting period </p>
<p>and compress the time for consultation before the referendum on 15 October. </p>
<p><b>25. </b> Prime Minister Ja’afari told Mr Patey that the Ministerial Committee was intended </p>
<p>“to help drive the process forward” and so ensure completion on time.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>26. </b> On 14 June, Mr Patey reported to the FCO that there remained no agreement on </p>
<p>Sunni representation on the Constitutional Committee.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p> Only two of its 55 members </p>
<p>were Sunni Arabs.</p>

<p><b>27. </b> The Committee Chair, Sheikh Hummam Hammoudi, had indicated that a further </p>
<p>13 places might be allocated to Sunni members, but there remained pressure to </p>
<p>increase this number. </p>
<p><b>28. </b> Mr Patey wrote that he was “encouraging the Sunnis to be realistic in their </p>
<p>demands”, taking into account that they made up around 20 percent of the Iraqi </p>
<p>population. He suggested that “they cannot expect to achieve much more than parity </p>
<p>with the Kurds”, who also accounted for about 20 percent of Iraq’s population. </p>
<p><b>29. </b> Mr Patey also reported that the Committee had been “won over” to the idea of </p>
<p>practical help from the UN and international community. </p>
<p><b>30. </b> Mr Chaplin told the Inquiry that the UK lobbied Iraqi politicians on the need to </p>
<p>ensure an adequate number of credible Sunni figures in the Committee.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>31. </b> Mr Patey told the Inquiry that the UK also spent a lot of time trying to convince </p>
<p>the TNA and Shia politicians that de-Ba’athification had gone too far, and that the </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification provisions should be excluded from the Constitution.</p>
<p>10</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>32. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 15 June.</p>
<p>11</p>
<p> Mr Blair said </p>
<p>that the main issue was “making sure Sunni outreach went ahead in the right way”; </p>
<p>it would be important to draw them into what was still a “very fragile” political process. </p>
<p><b>33. </b> In discussion of plans for future speeches, Mr Blair suggested that it would become </p>
<p>increasingly important to “flesh out” plans for transition to Iraqi leadership on security, </p>
<p>and the drawdown of troops that would follow. By the elections in December, “the </p>
<p>moderates in Iraq would need to be able to show that things were changing”. </p>
<p><b>34. </b> Dr John Reid, the Defence Secretary, circulated a paper on the options for future </p>
<p>UK force posture in Iraq to the Defence and Overseas Policy Committee (Iraq) (DOP(I)) </p>
<p>on 16 June.</p>
<p>12</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>35. </b> Dr Reid explained that the existing policy position, which he did not see a reason to </p>
<p>change, was that the UK should not:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agree to any changes to the UK area of responsibility; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agree to any significant deployments outside MND(SE); or</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>agree to any significant increase in the roughly 8,500 UK service personnel </p>
<p>currently deployed in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>36. </b> Dr Reid noted that there was a “clear UK military aspiration” to transfer security </p>
<p>responsibilities to Iraqi forces in Muthanna and Maysan in October 2005, with the </p>
<p>9 </p>
<p>Public hearing, 7 December 2009, page 21.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>494</p>
<p>remaining MND(SE) provinces (Basra and Dhi Qar), following in April 2006. That was </p>
<p>expected to lead to a significant reduction in the overall level of UK troops in Iraq to </p>
<p>around 3,000 personnel. </p>
<p><b>37. </b> The paper asked Ministers to agree that the UK should keep open the options of </p>
<p>agreeing to a small scale, more flexible UK deployment from mid-2006 and that UK </p>
<p>representatives at the June Multi-National Force – Iraq review should turn down any </p>
<p>proposal to extend the UK Area of Responsibility. Dr Reid would provide more advice in </p>
<p>late summer. </p>
<p><b>38. </b> Members of DOP(I) considered Dr Reid’s paper on 16 June, alongside a briefing </p>
<p>from Mr William Ehrman, Chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee (JIC), on Sunni </p>
<p>engagement and a discussion on progress of police reform and reconstruction in the </p>
<p>justice sector.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>39. </b> No specific conclusions about the UK’s future force posture were recorded, but </p>
<p>Dr Reid was asked to report on US thinking on drawdown of the Multi-National Force –  </p>
<p>Iraq (MNF-I) at a future meeting. DOP(I) agreed that the UK should concentrate on </p>
<p>“seeing progress” on the justice and policing sectors and should push for resolution of </p>
<p>the question of Sunni involvement in the Constitutional Committee. </p>
<p><b>40. </b> On 16 June, the British Embassy Washington reported that the US Administration </p>
<p>was again coming under pressure on Iraq, with renewed calls from Democrat politicians </p>
<p>for an exit strategy and a timeline for withdrawal of US troops from Iraq.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>41. </b> Opinion polls showed dwindling public support for US involvement, with increasing </p>
<p>concern about military overstretch and US casualties. The Embassy reported that the </p>
<p>White House was planning to respond to these criticisms in a significant speech by the </p>
<p>President, on the anniversary of the transfer of sovereignty at the end of June.</p>
<p><b>42. </b> On 17 June, Mr Patey reported that the Constitutional Committee had agreed that </p>
<p>15 additional Sunni Arab representatives should be appointed as members, with a </p>
<p>further 10 as expert advisers.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p> He observed:</p>
<p>“This allows Sunni politicians to argue that they have secured agreement to their </p>
<p>demand for the participation of 25 Sunni Arab representatives in the Committee </p>
<p>whilst preserving the necessary balance between the different political and religious </p>
<p>groups …”</p>
<p><b>43. </b> On 22 June, Mr Patey told the FCO that a list of 15 additional Sunni representatives </p>
<p>had been submitted, and that he expected the main work of the Committee to begin </p>

<p> The UNOCS was pressing ahead with its programme of assistance </p>
<p>and:</p>
<p>“We have agreed to identify Civil Service experts who might contribute to UN </p>
<p>seminars. The UNOCS have asked if we can suggest an authority on military-civilian </p>
<p>relations, and have intimated that further support from us in facilitating the access of </p>
<p>experts would be most welcome.”</p>
<p><b>44. </b> Air Chief Marshal Glenn Torpy, Chief of Joint Operations, submitted a paper entitled </p>
<p>‘Operational Transition in Iraq’ to the Chiefs of Staff on 22 June setting out a possible </p>
<p>timeline for withdrawal of UK forces.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p> In the paper he proposed a four-phase transition:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Security Assistance”, meaning active involvement in SSR;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Transfer to Provincial Iraqi Control with Tactical Overwatch”, meaning the Iraqi </p>
<p>Security Forces (ISF) would take the lead on security with the UK in support;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Operational Overwatch” meaning operating from a reduced number of MNF </p>
<p>bases in order to reduce profile, while providing reinforcement to Iraqi forces; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“Strategic Overwatch”, described as “The Coalition posture that will underwrite </p>
<p>Iraqi self-reliance and the normalisation of bilateral relationships.”</p>
<p><b>45. </b> The second phase would be reached in Muthanna and Maysan in autumn 2005, and </p>
<p>in Dhi Qar and Basra the following spring. </p>
<p><b>46. </b> ACM Torpy stated: “The key condition that guides this time-based approach is the </p>
<p>relative capacity of Iraqi provinces to assume full responsibility for their security.” He </p>
<p>went on to explain that:</p>
<p>“Operational Transition depends on growing Iraqi capacity, which <i>must remain the </i></p>
<p><i>dynamic, coherent and properly-funded Main Effort</i>.”</p>
<p><b>47. </b> On 22 June, the British Embassy Baghdad reported that General George Casey, </p>
<p>Commander of the MNF-I, had returned to the US in order to present his MNF-I Force </p>
<p>Structure Review.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p> That review did not envisage any fundamental changes in the </p>
<p>Campaign Plan, and:</p>
<p>“The US, at the local military level, accept and understand UK plans in relation to </p>
<p>MND(SE) including the point that any future changes in the level of UK forces in the </p>
<p>south east would not (not) release troops for redeployment to other areas of Iraq.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>496</p>
<p><b>48. </b> The Embassy recorded that two points required consideration in relation to changes </p>
<p>in UK troop levels in MND(SE); the provision of protection for all UK activity in the region </p>
<p>and how to maintain the security of the oil infrastructure. </p>
<p><b>49. </b> Mr Blair wrote to President Bush on 27 June, to share concerns raised with him by </p>
<p>his human rights envoy, Ms Ann Clwyd, during her recent visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>19</p>
<p><b>50. </b> Ms Clwyd had observed that it would be important not to burden the Iraqi authorities </p>
<p>with a very large volume of security detainees when responsibility for security was </p>
<p>transferred and had therefore recommended that the UK and US seek to reduce the </p>
<p>number held, possibly by way of an amnesty. Mr Blair wrote that: “A carefully managed </p>
<p>process of releases could help our Sunni outreach efforts.” </p>
<p><b>51. </b> Ms Clwyd had also raised concerns about the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST), which </p>
<p>had been set up to try members of the previous regime. Mr Blair commented that a </p>
<p>credible IST process which delivered “justice for the appalling crimes of the previous </p>
<p>regime” would have a major political impact but that the coalition may need to ensure </p>
<p>that the IST did not “rush to try the most serious cases before they are ready”. </p>
<p><b>52. </b> Mr Blair noted that both these issues would require careful handling and his and </p>
<p>President Bush’s personal attention, not least because of their impact on Iraqi – and </p>
<p>especially Sunni – opinion. Sir Nigel Sheinwald would follow up on the detail with </p>
<p>Mr Hadley. </p>
<p><b>53. </b> On 28 June, President Bush spoke to the US public from Fort Bragg, North </p>
<p>Carolina.</p>
<p>20</p>
<p> He described Iraq as the “latest battlefield” in the Global War Against Terror </p>
<p>and told listeners that:</p>
<p>“Our mission in Iraq is clear. We’re hunting down the terrorists. We’re helping Iraqis </p>
<p>build a free nation that is an ally in the war on terror. We’re advancing freedom in the </p>
<p>broader Middle East. We are removing a source of violence and instability …”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>54. </b> President Bush emphasised the importance that the coalition was placing on </p>
<p>training the ISF and the new steps that US forces were taking to make this process more </p>
<p>effective. On the question of when US troops would be withdrawn, he said:</p>
<p>“I recognize that Americans want our troops to come home as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>So do I. Some contend that we should set a deadline for withdrawing US forces. Let </p>
<p>me explain why that would be a serious mistake. Setting an artificial timetable would </p>
<p>send the wrong message to the Iraqis, who need to know that America will not leave </p>
<p>before the job is done. It would send the wrong message to our troops, who need to </p>
<p>know that we are serious about completing the mission they are risking their lives to </p>
<p>achieve. And it would send the wrong message to the enemy, who would know that </p>

<p>all they have to do is wait us out. We will stay in Iraq as long as we are needed, and </p>
<p>not a day longer.”</p>
<p><b>55. </b> The Chiefs of Staff considered ACM Torpy’s paper ‘Operational Transition in Iraq’ on </p>
<p>29 June.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p> They were broadly content with the paper, though noted that consideration </p>
<p>would need to be given to sustaining Iraqi capacity building during the drawdown phase, </p>
<p>including the work that other government departments (primarily the FCO and DFID) </p>
<p>were doing in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>56. </b> The Chiefs considered that:</p>
<p>“The UK was in a good position to force the pace of drawdown in the comparatively </p>
<p>benign MND(SE), but it was essential that this did not create a perception of </p>
<p>break-up within the coalition, or undermine UK/US relations, particularly as early </p>
<p>transition would be possible in all areas except those in which the US were </p>
<p>operating, since they tended to be the more difficult … The UK plan needed to  </p>
<p>be presented as the lead element of the overall Transition plan from Iraq;  </p>
<p>the US position was likely to be that no exit strategy was planned for Iraq as a </p>
<p>whole, but rather that a gradual drawdown from parts of Iraq would occur on  </p>
<p>a conditional basis.”</p>
<p><b>57. </b> On 29 June, at the request of the Cabinet Office Overseas and Defence Secretariat, </p>
<p>the JIC looked specifically at the role of Islamist jihadists in Iraq.</p>
<p>22</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>58. </b> The JIC judged that jihad in Iraq was “getting worse” and that the MNF were not yet </p>
<p>degrading the jihadists’ campaign:</p>
<p>“Islamist jihadists represent a small but growing proportion of the insurgency. Their </p>
<p>suicide bombing campaign is intensifying and having disproportionate impact on the </p>
<p>security situation … This has affected international public opinion and damaged the </p>
<p>credibility and confidence of the Iraqi Transitional Government … </p>
<p>“Most suicide bombers are foreigners, but the Iraqi component of the jihad is </p>
<p>increasing. The jihadists’ extreme methods remain repellent to most Sunnis. </p>
<p>But a combination of their successful attacks, anti-coalition/American stance and </p>
<p>opposition to a perceived Shia and Iranian dominated government is attracting more </p>
<p>support and enabling greater co-operation with some Iraqi Sunni Arab insurgents …</p>
<p>“The viability of the jihadist campaign will only come under threat if the wider Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency diminishes and the Iraqi Sunni Arabs are prepared, and able, to reject </p>
<p>the foreign jihadists in their midst.”</p>

<p><b>63. </b> Mr Straw enclosed a paper produced by the FCO Research Analysts which set out </p>
<p>the substantive issues that the Constitutional Commission needed to address. They </p>
<p>were:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Fundamental rights, including freedom of religion, expression, movement and </p>
<p>assembly, and equality of all citizens before the law.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Using the TAL as the basis of the new Constitution. It was essential that the </p>

<p>‘cut and pasted’ from it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The inclusion of language on how the Constitution could be amended; this was </p>
<p>particularly important given concern among Sunni Arabs that they had not had </p>

<p>A “system in which the main communities can informally share the key senior </p>
<p>positions, without sectarianism being formally entrenched”; the Research </p>
<p>Analysts recognised that it might be difficult to reach agreement on this, </p>
<p>commenting that the answer might be to retain the tripartite structures at the </p>
<p>head of government – Presidency Council, Prime Minister and Speaker – which </p>
<p>implied the division of roles between the three main communities but without a </p>
<p>specific sectarian quota.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Federalism – this was expected to be a key red line for each of the main </p>
<p>communities and the source of most distrust; the UK had “a strong interest </p>
<p>in avoiding any arrangement which would entrench sectarian divisions, eg a </p>
<p>single large federation in the South”. The Kurds were expected to champion </p>
<p>the devolution of oil revenues and the ability to manage their own economic </p>
<p>development. Shia Arabs were increasingly calling for some sort of economic </p>
<p>federalism of the South and a greater share of Iraq’s oil revenues.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Religion and national identity – the UK wished to see language similar to the </p>
<p>TAL, in which Islam was recognised as one source of legislation rather than </p>
<p>the only source. It would also be essential for the drafters to find a way of </p>
<p>expressing both Iraq’s identity as an Arab nation and the Kurdish desire for </p>
<p>greater recognition.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Militias – the question of whether the militias should be disbanded or integrated </p>
<p>into the Iraqi Security Forces would need to be resolved at some point, though </p>
<p>it was possible that this should happen separately from the development of </p>
<p>the Constitution.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The electoral system – although it was recognised that the Sunni Arabs, in </p>
<p>particular, were likely to wish for changes in the electoral system (for example </p>
<p>to move to a constituency-based arrangement). Any provision on this within the </p>
<p>Constitution should not be framed in such a way as to require its implementation </p>
<p>before the December elections, since that would mean delay.</p>
<p><b>64. </b> Mr Blair met President Bush at the G8 Summit at Gleneagles on 7 July.</p>

<p> Mr Blair </p>
<p>said that the US and UK objective should be to divide the Sunni insurgents from the </p>
<p>foreign jihadists. </p>
<p><b>65. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, a strong effort was needed to pull Iraqis away from the </p>
<p>insurgency; he had no concern about talking to those on the fringes of the insurgency in </p>
<p>order to achieve that. </p>
<p><b>66. </b> Mr Blair suggested that it would be important to handle conversations about the </p>
<p>issue of withdrawing the MNF with great care. He remained convinced that a “visible </p>
<p>forward plan” was needed so that it was clear the MNF wanted to leave when they </p>
<p>could, but were staying because of the scale of the insurgency. The plan would show </p>
<p>a projection of the coalition’s drawdown as Iraqi forces built up. In MND(SE) Mr Blair </p>

<p>Rather, we have made that conditional upon progress on political development and </p>
<p>security and, to a lesser extent … economic development. This is not a prediction or </p>
<p>a pledge, because our movement of troops will be conditional on the conditions … </p>
<p>but I have said that I envisage that the trained complement of the Iraqi army …  </p>
<p>could begin the process of taking the lead … in some parts of Iraq in the next </p>
<p>12 months. We would provide multi-national support for that as long as the Iraqi </p>

<p><b>The London bombings</b></p>
<p>On Thursday 7 July, four suicide bombers struck in central London, killing 52 people and </p>
<p>injuring more than 770 others.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p> Three of the bombs exploded on Underground trains and </p>
<p>the fourth on a double-decker bus. </p>

<p>the bombers, Mr Mohammad Sidique Khan, which had been first aired by the Al Jazeera </p>
<p>network on 1 September 2005. The Report noted that the focus of the video was on </p>
<p>“perceived injustices by the West against Muslims”. </p>
<p>Mr Khan’s statement included the passage:</p>
<p>“Your democratically elected governments continuously perpetuate atrocities against </p>

<p><b>69. </b> At its meeting on 13 July, the JIC reviewed the state of the insurgency in Iraq </p>
<p>and, separately, the effectiveness of the ITG’s efforts to bring Sunni Arabs into the </p>
<p>political process.</p>
<p>33</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>70. </b> The JIC judged that the majority of Iraqi insurgents were Sunni Arabs, to whom a </p>
<p>significant proportion of the Sunni community were sympathetic. Jihadists</p>
<p>34</p>
<p> remained in </p>
<p>a minority but represented a growing proportion of the insurgency and the proportion of </p>
<p>Iraqi jihadists was increasing. </p>
<p><b>71. </b> Although Sunni insurgents and jihadists had some common aims – opposing </p>
<p>the MNF and ITG – the JIC judged that most insurgents were not motivated by </p>
<p>Islamist zeal and most ordinary Iraqi Sunnis wanted to be rid of the foreign jihadists. </p>
<p>The Assessment said:</p>
<p>“Political engagement with the Sunnis will be key to exploiting this. Currently Sunni </p>
<p>Arab insurgents have no strong reason to turn on the jihadists. </p>
<p>“Actions of the ITG will be critical. If political progress is slow and Sunni expectations </p>
<p>not met, a significant insurgency in Sunni areas will persist and probably get worse </p>
<p>through 2006 and beyond. To counter this, the Iraqi security forces (ISF) in hard core </p>
<p>Sunni areas will need extensive MNF support through 2006 and beyond.”</p>
<p><b>72. </b> The JIC also considered the wider security situation in Iraq, including the activities of </p>
<p>the Shia militia and the situation in MND(SE). It judged that:</p>
<p>“Sectarian attacks are increasing but the presence of the MNF means that the </p>
<p>danger of civil war is currently remote.</p>
<p>“Shia militias remain largely restrained. Muqtada al-Sadr is content for the movement </p>
<p>to concentrate on the political process; any appetite within his organisation for a </p>
<p>return to violence is being suppressed. We have no indications that this is about to </p>
<p>change. A small minority of other Shia extremist groups continues to attack the MNF. </p>
<p>Some have been trained by Iran.</p>

<p>Outreach to Sunni Arabs’. </p>
<p>34 </p>
<p>The JIC used the term “jihadists” to describe extremists who believed they had a religious obligation to </p>
<p>fight the West and apostate regimes and who described their attacks as “jihad”.</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>502</p>
<p>“Sporadic violence against the MNF in MND(SE) continues, but at a much lower </p>
<p>level than in the Sunni areas: some 1 percent of all attacks in Iraq. There has been </p>
<p>considerable development of the ISF in the South, but they remain largely untested.”</p>
<p><b>73. </b> On engagement with Sunni Arabs, the JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“Winning over Iraq’s Sunni Arab population is key to reducing the insurgency over </p>
<p>time. Outreach to them by the Shia-dominated Iraqi Transitional Government has </p>
<p>been slow and in some cases reluctant. International pressure has helped create </p>
<p>some momentum. But overall, outreach has been insufficient to reduce Sunni Arab </p>
<p>concerns.</p>
<p>“Sunni attitudes to the political process are mixed. Sunni Arab political groupings </p>
<p>remain fluid, and their politicians have not developed a common political platform. </p>
<p>But there is a general perception that the Shia and Kurds are reluctant to share </p>
<p>political power; that the national reconstruction effort is not benefitting Sunni areas; </p>
<p>that some of the Iraqi Security Forces are targeting Sunnis; and that ministries are </p>
<p>being purged of Sunnis under the guise of de-Ba’athification. While some of these </p>
<p>claims have a basis of fact, many are exaggerated. A timetable for MNF withdrawal </p>
<p>also features strongly among Sunni demands.</p>
<p>“The extent to which Sunni concerns are taken into account in next month’s </p>
<p>draft Constitution (particularly about federalism and the need for them to benefit </p>
<p>from natural resources); whether it is approved in October’s referendum; and </p>
<p>the outcome of December’s elections will all be critical for establishing a sense </p>
<p>of enfranchisement for the Sunnis. Even on the most optimistic scenario, their </p>
<p>expectations will not be fully met. They have not become reconciled to their  </p>
<p>loss of dominance.</p>
<p>“There are links between some Sunni political figures and insurgent leaders, but we </p>
<p>do not believe the Sunni political parties can yet exert enough influence to command </p>
<p>a reduction in violence.”</p>
<p>35</p>
<p><b>74. </b> The JIC assessed that many Sunnis believed that the Shia coalition that led the ITG </p>
<p>was an Iranian stooge with an anti-Sunni agenda. At a local level, there was anecdotal </p>
<p>evidence and allegations to suggest that Sunnis were being forced out of their homes </p>
<p>in predominantly Shia areas and that some of the ISF (particularly those controlled </p>
<p>by the Shia Minister of the Interior) were responsible for inflaming sectarian tensions </p>
<p>by detaining and even killing Sunnis without justification. Although those reports and </p>
<p>allegations could not be verified, and the JIC assessed that many of the claims that had </p>
<p>been made were exaggerated, it judged that in Basra there was some justification for the </p>
<p>feeling of discrimination and that the perception was reinforcing sectarian divisions.</p>

<p><b>75. </b> On 15 July, the Iraq Strategy Group (ISG) considered a draft version of a paper for </p>
<p>DOP(I) from Dr Reid on operational transition in Iraq.</p>
<p>36</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>76. </b> The paper described a process in which Iraqi Security Forces would take primacy </p>
<p>province by province. The MNF would take on a reserve role as they did so. So long </p>
<p>as Iraqi capacity continued to increase and the security situation did not deteriorate </p>
<p>seriously, the transfer would be implemented from October in Maysan and Muthanna. </p>
<p>Basra and Dhi Qar would follow in spring 2006. This would lead to a reduced profile for </p>
<p>UK forces, and reductions in numbers to around 3,000 by summer 2006. </p>
<p><b>77. </b> Dr Reid wrote that:</p>
<p>“The plans are entirely consistent with Multi-National Forces – Iraq (MNF-I) planning; </p>
<p>General Casey (the US force commander in Iraq) has been briefed on them and is </p>
<p>content.”</p>
<p><b>78. </b> In the paper, Dr Reid asked DOP(I) to agree that detailed plans should be drawn up </p>
<p>for explaining the process to the Iraqi people, the US, other allies, Parliament and the </p>
<p>UK public. </p>
<p><b>79. </b> After a discussion, the ISG concluded that the paper needed to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>make clear that the process of force reduction was reversible;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>explain the degree of US concern about the possibility of “MND(SE) getting out </p>
<p>in front”, which should not be over-emphasised;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>explain the context in terms of ISF development; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cover more clearly the implications for other government departments and </p>

<p><b>80. </b> Dr Reid spoke to Mr Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair’s Chief of Staff, on 18 July about the </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>83. </b> Dr Reid recognised that drawdown could have an impact on the broader UK and </p>
<p>international effort in the South:</p>
<p>“It is also possible that other (FCO and DFID) activity in Iraq aimed at developing </p>
<p>the Iraqi Police Service and reconstruction will need to be curtailed or reduced, with </p>
<p>consequent implications for HMG’s wider effort, because of the difficulties of running </p>
<p>projects without UK military support and protection. This will need to be looked at in </p>
<p>more detail with Other Government Departments.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The announcement of any drawdown of UK forces in the South will have to be </p>
<p>managed carefully to ensure that there is no loss of confidence by major NGOs (in </p>
<p>particular the UN Agencies and the World Bank), which might lead them to postpone </p>
<p>plans for greater engagement in Iraq.”</p>
<p><b>84. </b> Dr Reid also recognised that although the drawdown was likely to deliver a </p>
<p>significant cost saving to the military there would be a cost increase to other parts of </p>

<p>“Other Government Departments operating in Iraq may … face increased security </p>

<p> Mr Negroponte said that it was important to keep </p>
<p>the political process moving forward, and to ensure that the ISF were not torn apart </p>
<p>by sectarian tensions. </p>
<p><b>90. </b> Mr Blair agreed, and said that a “key part of our strategy had to be keeping people’s </p>
<p>attention properly focused”. Some commentators were beginning to suggest that, </p>
<p>although their tactics were unacceptable, the aims of terrorist groups were legitimate. </p>
<p><b>91. </b> In a separate conversation, Sir Nigel Sheinwald told Ambassador Negroponte that </p>
<p>the UK aimed to start handing over its provinces in Iraq by the end of the year. </p>
<p><b>92. </b> DOP(I) met on 21 July, chaired by Mr Blair, and considered Dr Reid’s paper on </p>
<p>operational transition.</p>
<p>45</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>93. </b> The Chairman’s Brief, written by Cabinet Office officials for Mr Blair, suggested </p>
<p>that he would “want to focus the meeting on <b>ensuring individual Departments drive </b></p>
<p><b>forward work over the summer</b>”.</p>
<p>46</p>
<p> As the Committee would not meet again until after </p>
<p>the Parliamentary recess, Mr Blair should “<b>emphasise that the UK effort must not </b></p>
<p><b>lose impetus over</b> <b>the summer</b> as the preparations for key events in Iraq (Constitution, </p>
<p>elections, and transition) will need to be well advanced.”</p>
<p><b>94. </b> DOP(I) agreed Dr Reid’s recommendation that, subject to the continuation of </p>
<p>current trends in the capacity of the Iraqi security forces and to there being no major </p>
<p>deterioration in the security situation, the UK should plan to implement transition to Iraqi </p>
<p>control in two provinces of southern Iraq around October 2005, and in the other two </p>
<p>around March 2006.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p><b>95. </b> Mr Blair emphasised the importance of avoiding giving the “erroneous impression </p>
<p>that we intended to leave whatever the circumstances” and gave the instruction that no </p>
<p>further written papers should be produced until there had been consultation with the US </p>
<p>and the Iraqi Government. </p>
<p><b>96. </b> The second paper considered by DOP(I) on 21 July was written by the FCO and </p>
<p>presented by Mr Patey. It was entitled ‘Iraq: Splitting the Jihadists from the National </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>506</p>
<p><b>97. </b> The paper described jihadists as “principally foreigners, but an increasing number of </p>
<p>Iraqis”. It recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continuing to demonstrate inclusivity in the drafting of the Constitution, </p>
<p>committing to the timetable set out in the TAL, and being prepared to intervene </p>
<p>if necessary;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring that the system used in the December elections was a province-based </p>
<p>rather than a national-based one in order to maximise Sunni Arab participation;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>progressive release of detainees and improved regimes in detention facilities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pressing the ITG to relax the de-Ba’athification rules to allow disaffected former </p>
<p>Army officers and officials back into the ISF and government institutions, and </p>
<p>ensuring that de-Ba’athification decisions were based in a legal framework </p>
<p>rather than a political one;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reforming the judicial system, including increasing the capability of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Special Tribunal and urging the appointment of a Human Rights Minister;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>redeploying members of the Multi-National Force away from sensitive areas and </p>
<p>making clear there were no aspirations for long-term bases; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identifying and brokering local cease-fires with those leaders in the Sunni </p>
<p>community who were capable of being brought into the political process; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>implementing reconstruction projects rapidly following large-scale </p>
<p>counter-insurgency operations or local cease-fires.</p>
<p><b>98. </b> These were to be accompanied by a strong media strategy, aimed at undermining </p>
<p>the jihadists’ “un-Islamic” message, and active engagement with neighbouring states. </p>
<p><b>99. </b> DOP(I) agreed the broad approach proposed by the FCO.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p><b>100. </b> A few hours after DOP(I) met on 21 July, the Defence and Overseas Policy </p>
<p>Committee (DOP) also met, chaired by Mr Blair.</p>
<p><b>101. </b> The MOD invited DOP to consider whether or not it wished to move the UK </p>
<p>Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) from the north of Afghanistan to Helmand </p>
<p>province and to decide what, if any, additional force package should be deployed </p>
<p>to support it.</p>
<p>50</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>102. </b> There was a brief mention towards the end of the paper for DOP on the possible </p>
<p>impact of Iraq on the UK’s military operations in Afghanistan. It said that plans for UK </p>
<p>military drawdown in Iraq were under consideration and remained both highly sensitive </p>
<p>in the context of maintaining coalition cohesion and highly dependent on ISF capability. </p>
<p>It was anticipated that it would be possible to manage a significant drawdown over the </p>
<p>next two years. </p>

<p>507</p>
<p><b>103. </b> The paper concluded with a caution that:</p>
<p>“… any substantial prolongation of the UK military commitment in Iraq at current </p>
<p>force levels would have significant impact on individual personnel, the logistic </p>
<p>feasibility of any commitment in Afghanistan, and overall resourcing. If drawdown in </p>
<p>Iraq were to slip significantly, the MOD would be able to resource Options 2 and 3 </p>
<p>in terms of manpower and equipment, but the effects … [on personnel, logistics and </p>
<p>overall resourcing] would be exacerbated significantly.”</p>
<p><b>104. </b> When the MOD paper was circulated to DOP members for consideration, it was </p>
<p>accompanied by an appendix, produced by Cabinet Office officials, setting out the </p>
<p>estimates of financial pressures associated with the Iraq campaign during the financial </p>
<p>years 2005/06, 2006/07 and 2007/08.</p>
<p><b>105. </b> The minutes of the DOP discussion on 21 July do not indicate that there was any </p>
<p>discussion of the specific impact on the Iraq campaign of the proposed deployment to </p>
<p>Helmand.</p>
<p>51</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>106. </b> Dr Reid argued that “sorting out Helmand” was central to resolving Afghanistan’s </p>
<p>wider problems and that a UK deployment was a necessary, though “not sufficient”, </p>
<p>element in this. Given the security situation, if the deployment went ahead, it would </p>
<p>have to be on the basis of the largest option: a PRT with an infantry battlegroup and full </p>
<p>helicopter support. </p>
<p><b>107. </b> General Sir Michael Walker, Chief of the Defence Staff, did make reference to </p>
<p>Iraq, and advised DOP that the risk of UK casualties in Helmand would be higher than in </p>
<p>northern Afghanistan, but lower than in Iraq. </p>
<p><b>108. </b> Mr Des Browne, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, questioned whether the </p>
<p>UK could afford to take on another substantial military operation, given the cost of </p>
<p>operations in Iraq.</p>
<p><b>109. </b> DOP agreed in principle to deploy the PRT to Helmand with an infantry battlegroup </p>
<p>and full helicopter support. </p>
<p><b>110. </b> The paper provided for DOP’s discussion said that this option comprised “around </p>
<p>2,500 personnel in total”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>508</p>
<p><b>112. </b> The minute began:</p>
<p>“You ask how alarmed you should be about Iraq. Of course we should be </p>
<p>concerned – about the continuing high level of violence; lack of grip of the </p>
<p>ITG; slow pace of reconstruction etc. It is difficult to see these things being </p>
<p>remedied quickly. </p>
<p>“At the same time we need to make a hard-headed calculation: are we headed for </p>
<p>strategic failure? I do <b>not</b> think we are, principally because the political process </p>
<p>remains on track and, so far, the insurgents have not succeeded in fomenting any </p>
<p>widespread sectarian conflict. Those are the bottom line strategic risks.” </p>
<p><b>113. </b> Sir Nigel suggested that the objective over the next six months should be:</p>
<p>“… to build the right political and security platform so that: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the elected Iraqi Government after the December elections can really take </p>
<p>charge and govern the country; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MNF can begin a substantial withdrawal next year, and leave the country </p>
<p>in the hands of the ISF, without precipitating a civil war. At present there is no </p>
<p>doubt that the presence of the MNF contains the sectarian violence.”</p>
<p><b>114. </b> Achieving the objective required “a <b>comprehensive political strategy</b>”. Sir Nigel </p>
<p>suggested that the FCO paper discussed at DOP(I) contained all the necessary </p>
<p>elements of such a strategy. One of the key requirements was:</p>
<p>“A <b>delivery mechanism</b>: close co-ordination between the UK and US Ambassadors </p>
<p>and military in Baghdad; Jack [Straw] and Condi [Rice] in charge of the political </p>
<p>process; John [Reid] and Rumsfeld engaged on the security strategy.”</p>
<p><b>115. </b> Attached to Sir Nigel’s advice was a draft note for Mr Blair to send to President </p>
<p>Bush, prepared by Mr Blair’s Private Secretary.</p>
<p>54</p>
<p> It emphasised “if we are going </p>
<p>to achieve decisive effect within the necessary timescale, we need clearer lines of </p>
<p>responsibility for managing delivery”. </p>
<p><b>116. </b> Mr Blair wrote in manuscript on Sir Nigel’s advice: “I agree strongly with your </p>
<p>analysis. My concern is delivering the strategy.”</p>

<p><b>117. </b> On 25 July, the TNA passed a referendum law which defined two conditions that </p>
<p>must be met for a “yes” vote on the new Iraqi Constitution to be valid.</p>
<p>56</p>
<p> They were: </p>
<p>“Firstly, there is the positive condition that ‘a majority of the voters in Iraq approve’. </p>
<p>Secondly, there is the negative condition that ‘two-thirds of the voters in three or </p>
<p>more governorates do not reject it.’”</p>
<p><b>118. </b> Mr Patey reported that debate had broken out over the meaning of the first </p>
<p>condition; did it refer to a majority of those who voted, or of those on the electoral </p>
<p>list? UN elections experts believed the former, as did the drafters. However, Mr Patey </p>
<p>warned:</p>
<p>“If this ‘electoral list’ interpretation prevails, the risk that the Constitution will </p>
<p>be rejected increases. On the basis that those sponsoring this reading will </p>
<p>shortly realise their ploy is fraught with risk, we will seek to support UN efforts </p>
<p>for a clarification in favour of the ‘votes cast’ interpretation by explaining to key </p>
<p>interlocutors the dangers of gambling on a high turnout.”</p>
<p><b>119. </b> On 25 July, Mr Patey informed the FCO that the first full draft of the Constitution </p>
<p>had been circulated.</p>
<p>57</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>120. </b> The text was “rough” and many issues of substance remained unresolved, </p>
<p>including how the status of Kirkuk would be determined. Mr Patey also recorded </p>
<p>concerns about the qualification of women’s rights by Shar’ia Law, “unnecessary and </p>
<p>unhelpful” references to de-Ba’athification, and about judicial independence.</p>
<p><b>121. </b> Passing Mr Patey’s telegram to Mr Straw, the IPU reported that a “gathering of </p>
<p>senior Iraqis” was expected to thrash out the issues of substance later in the week.</p>
<p>58</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were positive signs of continued commitment to the drafting timetable. </p>
<p><b>122. </b> The IPU also highlighted that control of natural resources was a key issue in the </p>
<p>debate on federalism in the Constitution. Three options were on the table:</p>
<p>“Two of these stipulate resources will be managed by the federal government, with </p>
<p>a portion allocated to the regions. The third allows the regions to exploit natural </p>
<p>resources under supervision of the federal government.”</p>
<p><b>123. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush by video conference on 26 July and said that </p>
<p>the US and UK needed to “knit our political and security strategies together”.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p> The ITG </p>
<p>needed active support in reaching out to the Sunni community, and the UK and US </p>
<p>should “press hard for a big push”, including with helpful partners in the region. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>510</p>
<p><b>124. </b> On 31 July, in a report to Gen Walker, Lieutenant General Robin Brims, the Senior </p>
<p>British Military Representative – Iraq (SBMR-I), reported that:</p>
<p>“At long last, and with much steering by the US and prompting by ourselves, the </p>
<p>first meeting of the Joint Commission on Conditions-Based Transition will be this </p>
<p>Tuesday and I will chair the coalition side after the first meeting (when General </p>
<p>Casey will take the lead) … The idea is to present agreed recommendations to </p>
<p>the PM by 26 September with announcements after the constitutional referendum. </p>
<p>Current thinking proposes not setting the conditions bar too high and is aiming </p>
<p>for some early transfers of suitable cities from coalition forces to appropriate civil </p>
<p>authorities – with all transfer decisions being joint ones.”</p>
<p>60</p>
<p><b>125. </b> Lt Gen Brims also reported the establishment of a US/UK “Red Team” (or “Red </p>
<p>Cell”). Its purpose was to examine counter-insurgency strategy critically and “determine </p>
<p>which enemy is the greatest challenge and what they think of our strategy”.</p>
<p><b>126. </b> Lt Gen Brims wrote that he saw the review as “a most important exercise to ensure </p>
<p>we test and adjust our strategy as necessary”. </p>

<p><b>127. </b> On 2 August, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Mr Hadley a Note by Mr Blair for President </p>

<p> It set out the things that Mr Blair considered “we need to work on urgently”, and </p>
<p>suggested a discussion. </p>
<p><b>128. </b> On Iraq, Mr Blair listed Sunni outreach, security transition and organisation as the </p>
<p>three areas requiring attention. </p>
<p><b>129. </b> Mr Blair identified Sunni participation as key to the success of December’s </p>
<p>elections and wrote that “we will have to take over the Sunni outreach or at least the </p>
<p>strategy behind it”. The component parts of that would be:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>some detainee releases;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>installing a provincial list system for the December elections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>vigorous outreach by the ITG;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a transparent and rules-based de-Ba’athification process;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US/UK contacts with insurgents, which could “allow local cease-fires”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reconstruction; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing in “friendly neighbouring states”.</p>

<p>9.4  |  June 2005 to May 2006</p>
<p>511</p>
<p><b>130. </b> Under the heading “security transition”, Mr Blair wrote that the problem was:</p>
<p>“… if we look as if we’re wanting to go, that undermines our resolve; if we look as if </p>
<p>we’re wanting to stay, that undermines our political strategy to help Iraq stand on its </p>
<p>own feet as a democracy.” </p>
<p><b>131. </b> The solution, he suggested, was an Iraqi-led transition plan before the elections, </p>
<p>setting out “how we intend to proceed”, with a media strategy for its communication. </p>
<p><b>132. </b> On organisation, Mr Blair stressed the need for effective political engagement and </p>
<p>suggested that he and President Bush should receive a regular report from Mr Patey </p>
<p>and Ambassador Khalilzad “specifically on the political outreach”. </p>
<p><b>133. </b> Mr Blair spoke to President Bush on 5 August and suggested that an informal </p>
<p>contact group was needed to take forward a conference to bring Sunni and Shia groups </p>
<p>together.</p>
<p>62</p>
<p> Mr Blair considered that the key was “to draw in the silent Sunni majority” and </p>
<p>suggested that the UK and US Ambassadors should report progress on a weekly basis. </p>
<p><b>134. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported a last-ditch attempt by key Iraqi politicians </p>
<p>to achieve consensus on the Constitution on the eve of 15 August.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p> Discussion of the </p>
<p>draft text continued into the night. The Embassy judged that a short extension to the </p>
<p>drafting deadline was the most likely outcome. </p>
<p><b>135. </b> Negotiations continued on 15 August, focused on the proposed process for </p>
<p>achieving federal autonomy, and on natural resources.</p>
<p>64</p>
<p> Half an hour before the expiry </p>
<p>of the deadline (at midnight) the Speaker of the TNA proposed an amendment to </p>
<p>the TAL extending the drafting deadline to 22 August, which was passed unanimously </p>
<p>by the TNA. </p>
<p><b>136. </b> Following a visit to Iraq from 13 to 18 August, Mr Asquith commented that the </p>
<p>constitutional negotiations had “exposed the crystalline brittleness of the political </p>
<p>process”.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p> In his view, the Shia Islamist and Kurdish leaders had:</p>
<p>“… always known that they could achieve a Constitution (text and sufficient votes in </p>
<p>a referendum) over the wishes of the Sunni, by trading with each other Islamist and </p>
<p>federal language that satisfied their respective key objectives.” </p>
<p><b>137. </b> Mr Asquith noted that both had, so far, pulled back from such a “bilateral stitch-up”. </p>
<p>That was in his view significant, and should help to encourage Sunni participation in the </p>
<p>referendum and elections, something which he considered of fundamental importance. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>512</p>
<p><b>138. </b> Mr Asquith also described increasing tension at the heart of the Shia community </p>
<p>over the question of federalism:</p>
<p>“The Sadrist trend is split, with Muqtada’s supporters siding with the Sunni </p>
<p>anti-federalist tendency; the Shia federalists in the South-East don’t know what they </p>
<p>want (decentralisation or federalism) …”</p>
<p><b>139. </b> On 22 August, the IPU alerted Mr Straw’s Private Secretary to the risk that the Shia </p>
<p>and Kurdish representatives might reach agreement on the linked issues of federalism </p>
<p>and control of natural resources which did not have Sunni buy-in.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p> The IPU proposed a </p>
<p>joint US/UK demarche</p>
<p>67</p>
<p> on Shia and Kurdish leaders, to be agreed between Mr Straw </p>
<p>and Dr Condoleezza Rice, US Secretary of State. </p>
<p><b>140. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported the conversation between Mr Straw and </p>
<p>Secretary Rice later that evening.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>141. </b> During the discussion, Mr Straw had expressed concern over reports that the </p>
<p>Shia and Kurds might “stitch up” a deal on federalism at the expense of the Sunnis. </p>
<p>That, Mr Straw feared, would be destabilising. In his view any solution which involved </p>
<p>merging provinces should be approved by the TNA. Secretary Rice said that she would </p>
<p>speak to the US Ambassador to Iraq and then call back. </p>
<p><b>142. </b> Mr Straw and Dr Rice again discussed progress on constitutional negotiations on </p>
<p>24 August.</p>
<p>69</p>
<p> Secretary Rice reported that agreement appeared close. </p>
<p><b>143. </b> On federalism, the Shia were prepared to commit to take no steps towards forming </p>
<p>newly federated regions for four years, on the basis of a firm assurance from the US that </p>
<p>it would not oppose any measures to form a federation after that period, and that  </p>
<p>it would give due consideration to the needs of the South in providing financial </p>
<p>assistance packages. </p>
<p><b>144. </b> Secretary Rice added that “there appeared to be a latent suspicion that the UK </p>
<p>would repeat the history of the 1920s and undercut agreements reached with the Iraqis”, </p>
<p>and therefore suggested that the UK might also offer these firm assurances. Mr Straw </p>
<p>discussed this point with Mr Blair, and agreed to sign up to these commitments. He </p>
<p>commented that “we could not in any case prevent the Iraqis from forming federated </p>
<p>regions and we actually channelled most of our aid to the South already”. </p>
<p><b>145. </b> The ISG reviewed progress on the Constitution on 26 August.</p>

<p>that “presented corresponding risks for an increase in the insurgency and sectarian </p>
<p>violence”.</p>
<p><b>146. </b> The ISG also discussed the anticipated report of the Red Team and recognised </p>
<p>that the UK would need to consider what its “legacy” in MND(SE) would be. The FCO </p>
<p>and MOD were commissioned to produce an assessment of the UK legacy in MND(SE) </p>
<p>one year on, for discussion at the next meeting. </p>
<p><b>147. </b> In response to that commission, the IPU produced a paper on the UK’s </p>
<p>objectives for MND(SE).</p>
<p>71</p>
<p> The paper suggested that objectives for the South-East </p>
<p>were that it should:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identify itself as part of Iraq, connected to Baghdad;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>engage in a constructive but not servile relationship with Iran;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>have credible local government delivering effective services;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>have security forces loyal to the state and capable of providing sufficient law and </p>
<p>order to “avert a descent into full-blown criminality and chaos”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>improve the supply of services such as electricity in the short term and have a </p>
<p>credible long-term development plan; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>achieve economic sustainability. </p>
<p><b>148. </b> The challenges to achieving those objectives included Saddam Hussein’s legacy </p>
<p>of neglect in the South, significant differences in political vision, militia activity, poor local </p>
<p>governance and tribal violence. </p>
<p><b>149. </b> According to the paper:</p>
<p>“We cannot stay in Southern Iraq indefinitely and our aim remains to reduce our </p>
<p>military presence over the next 12 months. Against our broader global strategy, our </p>
<p>plans are to draw down significant numbers of personnel next Autumn. We therefore </p>
<p>need to take decisions on what we should do in the interim to give the South-East </p>
<p>the best possible chance of going it alone.”</p>
<p><b>150. </b> A telegram from the British Embassy Office Basra was supplied to be read in </p>
<p>conjunction with the IPU paper.</p>
<p>72</p>
<p> On the UK legacy in MND(SE) it advised:</p>
<p>“The South cannot be seen in isolation from developments in Baghdad. Our ability to </p>
<p>achieve anything will be affected by the outcome of the constitutional debate and the </p>
<p>future balance of power following elections. The legacy we leave in the South will to </p>
<p>a large part be dependent on outside factors, such as the Sunni reaction in central </p>
<p>Iraq to the Constitution. </p>

<p>“The legacy will be imperfect, but we should not be too defensive. The challenge </p>
<p>was great, and the achievements are considerable. If we can contain the </p>
<p>politicisation of the IPS from getting out of control, get the multilateral agencies more </p>
<p>engaged, and plan now on some longer-term priorities, we can leave knowing that </p>
<p>southern Iraq has the capability of realising its massive economic potential for the </p>
<p>whole country. We should be able to leave with the goodwill of the majority of the </p>
<p>population in southern Iraq (there would come a point when that is less certain). </p>
<p>But we need to prepare the ground now to lower UK public and international </p>
<p>expectations of what we are leaving behind.”</p>
<p><b>151. </b> The Constitutional Commission presented the text of the draft Constitution to </p>
<p>the TNA on 28 August.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>152. </b> Mr Patey described the document that had been produced as “an admirable </p>
<p>document which contains much we should applaud”.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p> Its “key achievements” were </p>
<p>“protection of fundamental rights including minorities and women” and it came closer to </p>
<p>meeting Sunni concerns than the draft as it stood on 15 August. </p>
<p><b>153. </b> The immediate Sunni reaction to the text was reported by Mr Patey to be “muted </p>
<p>… with many still considering their position”.</p>
<p>75</p>
<p> But a “key positive” was that “almost all </p>
<p>are encouraging participation in the referendum thus acknowledging that influence is </p>
<p>won more effectively by voting than by violence”.</p>
<p><b>154. </b> In the period after the Constitutional Commission announced that it had reached </p>
<p>agreement on the draft text, the US encouraged further discussion between parties </p>
<p>aimed at increasing Sunni Arab support for the Constitution.</p>
<p>76</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>155. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that Mr Blair’s aspirations for the Iraqi </p>
<p>Constitution were:</p>
<p>“… that it should get agreed and the referendum should go ahead and it should have </p>
<p>a very broad base of support in the population; that we should keep to the timetable, </p>
<p>we should keep the show going, we shouldn’t get derailed by the violence which of </p>
<p>course continued, intensified …”</p>
<p>77</p>
<p><b>156. </b> Mr Asquith told the Inquiry that the UK’s objectives for the Constitution were:</p>
<p>“To lay the basis for a representative democracy which kept the country together; </p>
<p>which didn’t build in sectarian advantages or ethnic advantages; and which didn’t </p>
<p>create a form of federalism which was going to increase the risk of the country </p>

<p>78</p>
<p><b>157. </b> In a telephone conversation on 29 August, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr Hadley </p>
<p>agreed that the draft Constitution was a good document, but that the outcome was “at </p>
<p>best mixed in terms of bringing the Sunnis into the process”.</p>
<p>79</p>
<p> They agreed that the </p>
<p>possibility of further changes should be kept open. </p>
<p><b>158. </b> Commenting on the Constitution in conversation with Secretary Rice in late </p>
<p>August 2005, Mr Straw said that he was:</p>
<p>“… very struck by the progress which had been made … The fact that the decisions </p>
<p>on further federalism had been parked to the new National Assembly … had both </p>
<p>down and up sides to it. The down side was that there was no built in protection by </p>
<p>way of special majorities or special processes for the Sunni to make more difficult </p>
<p>greater devolution of power which they feared. On the other hand, the fact that this </p>
<p>question was going to be left to simple majorities of the National Assembly opened </p>
<p>up the possibility for … deals by simple majority to provide some of the protection </p>
<p>which the Sunnis were seeking.”</p>
<p>80</p>
<p><b>159. </b> Mr Patey reported to Mr Asquith on 31 August that he had delivered the </p>
<p>commitment Secretary Rice had outlined to Mr Straw, explaining:</p>
<p>“I … spoke to Adel Abdel Mehdi to tell him that we could align ourselves with US </p>
<p>assurances. As you know, the UIA [United Iraqi Alliance] finally agreed that [the] </p>
<p>issue of further federalism would be left to the next National Assembly. Adel has now </p>
<p>followed up and asked for this in writing as promised.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“The US assurances turned out to be in the form of a commitment to use their </p>
<p>good offices to hold the Kurds to a separate political agreement with the UIA on the </p>
<p>content of new legislation. I have provided a similar commitment …</p>
<p>“In passing our assurance on to Adel Abdel Mehdi, I have made it clear that this </p>

<p>Report US Red Team, 31 August 2005, ‘An integrated counterinsurgency strategy for Iraq’. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>516</p>
<p><b>161. </b> The Red Team assessed that the coalition’s current strategy, which focused on the </p>
<p>transition of responsibility for security to the Iraqi Government, would enable coalition </p>
<p>forces to disengage from Iraq but would leave Iraqi Security Forces that would not to </p>
<p>able to defeat the insurgency in the foreseeable future. </p>
<p><b>162. </b> The Red Team proposed a new strategy based on the “ink-spot” counter-</p>
<p>insurgency model, with tighter integration of military and civilian efforts and additional </p>
<p>resources for the political, economic and governance activities. It did not propose </p>
<p>additional military resources, but considered that redeployment of some of the existing </p>
<p>resources might help achieve greater effect. </p>
<p><b>163. </b> The Red Team defined the ink-spot model as:</p>
<p>“… the integration of security, economic, social and political actions to achieve </p>
<p>significant local control. The concept is to introduce sufficient security forces to </p>
<p>control a defined area, use traditional counter-insurgency practices to establish </p>
<p>persistent security, exploit intelligence provided by the local population, provide [the] </p>
<p>local population with the benefits of economic development and better governance, </p>
<p>and communicate effectively with local and national audiences.”</p>
<p><b>164. </b> Once an area was secured, it could be expanded or new areas secured, so that </p>
<p>the area under control was gradually extended. These local actions would be supported </p>
<p>by action at the national level to develop an inclusive political process, provide economic </p>
<p>opportunities, and improve governance. </p>
<p><b>165. </b> The Report proposed that a Joint Inter-Agency Counter-Insurgency Task Force </p>
<p>should be established to plan, co-ordinate and implement governance reform and </p>
<p>economic sector development work in support of the counter-insurgency campaign, and </p>
<p>that fully-staffed Provincial Support Teams should be established in each ink-spot. </p>
<p><b>166. </b> Sir John Sawers, FCO Director General Political at the time of the Report’s </p>
<p>publication, told the Inquiry that he would not have described the Red Team exercise as </p>
<p>a major review like the one carried out by the Baker-Hamilton Commission a year later </p>
<p>(see Section 9.5) which was “the real turning point in strategy”.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p> Rather, he saw the </p>
<p>2005 Red Team exercise as a good way of examining alternative approaches, which  </p>
<p>did not lead to significant changes.</p>
<p><b>167. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I think maybe what it did encapsulate was the greater readiness of the American </p>
<p>system to approach this on a counter-insurgency basis and to understand the nature </p>
<p>of what we were dealing with, to subjugate the military approach to political ends. </p>
<p>And it combined with Ambassador Khalilzad’s own outreach to the Sunni community </p>
<p>and so on, and that was in a critical moment in the run-up to the December 2005 </p>
<p>83 </p>

<p>517</p>
<p>elections. And we ourselves were engaging in various outreach events to the Sunni </p>
<p>community during that period, both at Ministerial and official level. So I think if there </p>
<p>was an encapsulation, it was that we were adopting a more politically sophisticated </p>
<p>approach both to security and to politics in that critical period, or were trying to.”</p>
<p>84</p>
<p><b>September 2005</b></p>
<p><b>168. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 1 September.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p><b>169. </b> Mr Blair proposed that the political strategy in Iraq should focus on the December </p>
<p>elections and should have two strands:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring greater Sunni participation, by “activity in Iraq led by Khalilzad and </p>
<p>William Patey” and by involving regional actors; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>“building a moderate, secular platform which could succeed in the elections”. </p>
<p><b>170. </b> Mr Blair said that it would become clear to voters in Iraq that they had a choice </p>
<p>between a “strong unified and democratic Iraq” and one which was “weak, divided </p>
<p>and sectarian”. </p>
<p><b>171. </b> The 26 August IPU paper was discussed by the Iraq Strategy Group on </p>
<p>2 September.</p>
<p>86</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>172. </b> The record of the meeting shows that Sir Nigel Sheinwald highlighted a number of </p>
<p>issues emerging from the paper, for which clarity was needed on how they were being </p>
<p>resolved, specifically:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>cancelled DFID programmes (see Section 10.2);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>lack of progress on the police (see Section 12.1); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a gap in funding for the Iraqi armed forces (see Section 12.1).</p>
<p><b>173. </b> The FCO was commissioned to produce a revised paper by 14 September which </p>
<p>would address in direct terms what the UK would be able to say it had achieved by early </p>
<p>in 2006. </p>
<p><b>174. </b> The ISG also considered Sunni reactions to the Constitution, and observed that </p>
<p>they were “not united”. </p>
<p><b>175. </b> The advice of Mr Patey was “to give the Sunnis a little more time to take stock, and </p>
<p>to support them seeking some further final changes to the draft”.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>518</p>
<p><b>176. </b> At a meeting of the Iraq Senior Officials Group (ISOG) on 9 September, attendees </p>
<p>were told that:</p>
<p>“… we continued to push for final changes to meet Sunni concerns. The areas </p>
<p>for possible movement were: Arab identity; and the electoral law. The UN was </p>
<p>increasingly concerned that they would miss their deadline for distributing copies </p>
<p>of the Constitution to the Iraqi population.”</p>
<p>87</p>
<p><b>177. </b> As work to finalise the Constitution continued, concerns were mounting about </p>
<p>security, including in MND(SE). </p>
<p><b>178. </b> On 9</p>
<p> </p>
<p>September, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary provided him with an update on </p>
<p>Iraq.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p> He reported “further cause for concern”, including about:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Lebanese and Iranian involvement in Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the “apparent involvement of members of Basra Police in attacks against </p>
<p>the MNF, and a claim from the Basra Chief of Police that only 500 out of </p>
<p>12,000 Basra Police are loyal to him”; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the key role being played by a breakaway group from the Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM).</p>
<p><b>179. </b> The Private Secretary wrote: </p>
<p>“We still do not have the comprehensive picture that we need of what is going on </p>
<p>in Basra. Kim Howells [FCO Minister of State] visits next week. I have spoken to </p>
<p>his office today and emphasised that you are personally very concerned about the </p>
<p>situation and that we need a serious report from him on this.”</p>
<p><b>180. </b> Mr Blair’s reply said:</p>
<p>“This is v. worrying. It all depends on the ISF being built up credibly. But we need </p>
<p>strong messages to Iran, Lebanon and what do we do to disrupt Hizballah?”</p>
<p>89</p>
<p><b>181. </b> At its meeting on 9 September the ISOG considered the Red Team Report.</p>
<p>90</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>182. </b> Officials commented that the Report was not an alternative campaign plan, but </p>
<p>a “set of ideas”. The MOD “did not see the report having great traction in Washington, </p>
<p>except at the margins” on the question of how the MNF could pursue the current strategy </p>
<p>more effectively. </p>
<p><b>183. </b> The ISOG also observed that the Red Team’s Report contained “risks … for the </p>
<p>UK” as it suggested that “forces (coalition and Iraqi) should be moved from benign to </p>

<p><b>184. </b> On 12 September, Dr Reid wrote to Mr Blair with the results of the most recent </p>
<p>review of UK forces in Iraq.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p> He explained that:</p>
<p>“… considerable progress has been made in training the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) </p>
<p>since the last roulement in May. Consequently, an overall reduction of about 500 </p>
<p>troops will be possible in … October/November.” </p>
<p><b>185. </b> That reduction would bring force levels down to around 8,000. Dr Reid noted that </p>
<p>“incident levels have remained much lower than in other parts of Iraq, but attacks on UK </p>
<p>forces have grown in sophistication”. He added: “It should be emphasised that agreeing </p>
<p>to the roulement <b>does not</b> trigger implementation of our transition plans in MND(SE).” </p>
<p><b>186. </b> On the same day, Dr Reid’s Assistant Private Secretary sought a specific </p>
<p>assurance from Gen Walker that the MOD’s planning assumptions for deployment in </p>
<p>Afghanistan – as presented to DOP in July 2005 – would be achievable in the event of a </p>
<p>slower than expected drawdown of UK forces in Iraq.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>187. </b> In a bilateral meeting with President Bush in the margins of a summit on </p>
<p>14 September, Mr Blair said that he had read the Red Team Report and that “some of </p>
<p>its conclusions were worrying, but at least it set out some clear ideas on the forward </p>
<p>strategy”.</p>
<p>93</p>
<p> He suggested that the conclusions should be evaluated in London and </p>
<p>Washington, and taken forward “where they made sense”. </p>
<p><b>188. </b> On 14 September, Mr Paul Fox, Head of the IPU, wrote to Mr Straw’s Private </p>

<p><b>189. </b> The deal stated that the issue of federalism would not be determined until after </p>

<p><b>190. </b> Mr Fox wrote: </p>

<p><b>Al Qaida declares war </b></p>
<p>On 14 September, the leader of Al Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, declared an </p>
<p>“all-out war” on Shia Muslims in Iraq in response to a US–Iraqi offensive on the town of </p>
<p>Tal Afar.</p>
<p>95</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On 18 September, Lt Gen Brims’ weekly report to Gen Walker recorded the impact of this </p>
<p>declaration.</p>
<p>96</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A series of 12 car bombs in Baghdad had increased the number of attacks there by </p>
<p>almost half. The weekly casualty numbers rose by 122 percent, and 479 of the 782 people </p>
<p>killed were civilians. Although al-Zarqawi claimed the attacks in Baghdad, Lt Gen Brims </p>
<p>observed “we should not under-estimate the extent of involvement of local Iraqi insurgents </p>
<p>in planning and executing many of the attacks”.</p>
<p><b>191. </b> On 15 September, the JIC produced an Assessment covering the draft Constitution </p>
<p>and Sunni violence, at the request of the ISOG.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. Many leading Sunni figures are unhappy with aspects of the draft Constitution … </p>
<p>At the grass-roots many Sunnis wish to vote: most who do are likely to reject the </p>
<p>draft.</p>
<p>“II. It is unlikely that the Sunnis can mobilise a two-thirds majority against the draft in </p>
<p>the requisite three provinces …</p>
<p>“III. Actions of the insurgents will be critical to the size of the Sunni vote. The hard </p>
<p>core of the insurgents … see the political process as a threat and will try to disrupt </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>522</p>
<p><b>202. </b> Gen Walker’s Private Office replied on 19 September to the request from Dr Reid’s </p>
<p>Private Office for an assurance that the MOD’s planning assumptions for deployment in </p>
<p>Afghanistan – as presented to DOP in July 2005 – would be achievable in the event of a </p>
<p>slower than expected drawdown of UK forces in Iraq.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p> The minute said: </p>
<p>“The short answer is yes … CJO [Chief of Joint Operations] … is clear that our plans </p>
<p>for Afghanistan are deliverable even if events slow down our Iraq disengagement; </p>
<p>furthermore, DCDS(C) [Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments)] has </p>
<p>factored the possibility of such a slippage into the MOD’s strategic planning for </p>
<p>Afghanistan and our strategic intent for future commitments.”</p>
<p><b>203. </b> Such a situation would lead to “some pain-and-grief”, in particular the pressure on </p>
<p>already stretched services such as helicopter support would continue:</p>
<p>“But, our ability to fulfil our plan in Afghanistan is not predicated on withdrawal </p>
<p>of such capabilities from Iraq and … in the event that our … plan for progressive </p>
<p>disengagement from southern Iraq is delayed, we will still be able to deliver our … </p>
<p>mandated force levels in Afghanistan.”</p>
<p><b>204. </b> Dr Reid told the Inquiry that he had asked for this assurance from General Walker </p>
<p>because he was:</p>
<p>“… slightly worried that although there was a chronological coincidence with the </p>
<p>downturn in Iraq, the downsizing of forces and the going into Helmand, I did not </p>
<p>want one to be reliant upon the other, in case we couldn’t get out of Iraq.”</p>
<p>105</p>
<p><b>205. </b> Gen Walker’s assurance had met his concern:</p>
<p>“… there wasn’t a concern in my mind that this [going into Helmand] would result in </p>
<p>a diminution of our resources in Iraq, personnel or otherwise. Why? Because I had </p>
<p>asked that specific question and been told, ‘No’.”</p>
<p>106</p>
<p><b>206. </b> Sir Kevin Tebbit, MOD Permanent Under Secretary from 1998 to 2005, told </p>
<p>the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I was apprehensive [about the deployment of UK forces to Helmand] and I made </p>
<p>my concerns known to my planning staff and to the Chiefs of Staff. I think their </p>
<p>view was that they could do it and it was manageable … since it was [the Chiefs </p>
<p>of Staff] who would actually have to ensure they could do this, I did not press </p>
<p>my objections fully.”</p>

<p>9.4  |  June 2005 to May 2006</p>
<p>523</p>
<p><b>208. </b> On 19 September, after a discussion with senior Whitehall officials and Mr Patey in </p>
<p>Baghdad, Sir Nigel Sheinwald produced detailed advice for Mr Blair on UK Iraq strategy </p>
<p>and priorities for the next three to six months.</p>
<p>109</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>209. </b> Sir Nigel identified an “underlying conflict” between the objective defined for the </p>
<p>Red Team and the coalition’s current objective to: </p>
<p>“… hold to the political timetable (Constitution, referendum, elections in 2005) and </p>
<p>build up Iraqi capabilities so that the coalition can begin a progressive withdrawal, </p>
<p>starting next year. </p>
<p>“This involves a concept of ‘sufficiency’, i.e. we accept that the insurgency will go on </p>
<p>for some time, but aim to contain it sufficiently for the political and security transition </p>
<p>to be credible and for us to be able to draw down without appearing to cut and </p>
<p>run dishonourably.”</p>
<p><b>210. </b> Sir Nigel commented that the coalition’s current strategy recognised that in order to </p>
<p>win over Sunni opinion, it would be necessary to show that the coalition would honour its </p>
<p>commitment to withdraw and not occupy Iraq indefinitely.</p>
<p><b>211. </b> In contrast, the Red Team’s approach implied additional US resources, which the </p>
<p>US Administration might not be willing to provide, and no withdrawal for at least three </p>
<p>years. It would also require “a massive Iraqi co-ordination effort, of which they are at </p>
<p>present incapable”. </p>
<p><b>212. </b> Sir Nigel observed that the “ink-spot” approach recommended by the Red Team </p>
<p>was similar to the coalition’s current concept of operations in Fallujah, Samarra and </p>
<p>other areas. To date there had been “<b>no</b> success stories in Sunni areas” and it was “not </p>
<p>obvious how this would change quickly”. He continued:</p>
<p>“Arguably, this strategy comes two and a half years late. It might have been possible </p>
<p>to try something like this immediately after the invasion, but to do so now, fifteen </p>
<p>months after the Occupation formally ended, and with the definitive government </p>
<p>about to be elected, is – to put it mildly – counter-intuitive.” </p>
<p><b>213. </b> Sir Nigel wrote that the Red Team Report was nevertheless to be welcomed </p>
<p>because:</p>
<p>“</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It is realistic in its assessment, and comprehensive in its scope; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It insists on an integrated campaign (security, political, economic);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>It specifies actions that need to be taken, and demands active follow-through.”</p>
<p><b>214. </b> On political priorities, Sir Nigel considered that the UK was facing two phases of </p>
<p>activity. Until the end of 2005, “the bottom line requirement is to keep the show on the </p>
<p>road, ie provide an environment in which the referendum and elections can take place”.</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>524</p>
<p><b>215. </b> Sir Nigel wrote that, after the elections:</p>
<p>“… we have to focus on <b>outcomes</b>, not just <b>process</b> … What we need is a <b>centrist</b> </p>
<p>government capable of (a) <b>executive effectiveness</b> and (b) <b>political inclusiveness</b> </p>
<p>or at least a government with a strong centrist/non-religious component. In present </p>
<p>circumstances, the only person capable of fitting this bill, for all his faults, is <b>Ayad </b></p>
<p><b>Allawi</b>. I see it as a legitimate aim of British policy to buttress him and others in the </p>
<p>centre of Iraqi politics …”</p>
<p><b>216. </b> Sir Nigel concluded:</p>
<p>“Above all, we (ie Khalilzad and ourselves) will need to ensure that a <b>new Iraqi </b></p>
<p><b>government</b> is formed <b>quickly</b> after the December elections and has the best </p>
<p>possible composition from the point of view of our objectives.”</p>
<p><b>217. </b> Sir Nigel recommended that the UK should continue its work on Sunni outreach, </p>
<p>upgrade its political effort in Basra and provide “a clear demonstration that we are </p>
<p>taking our legacy seriously”. The UK also needed to establish political channels to </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr and Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani. </p>
<p><b>218. </b> On security, Sir Nigel noted that it would be important for the MNF to get the right </p>
<p>balance both between ISF training and counter-insurgency work, and action against </p>
<p>foreign fighters and dealing with “home-grown” Iraqi insurgents. He observed that:</p>
<p>“The key new point over the past few months has been <b>increased and vicious </b></p>
<p><b>sectarianism</b>. Some of this is coming from the insurgents; some of it is coming from </p>
<p>Shia elements within the police and armed forces, and from the Shia militia. This </p>
<p>not only risks an escalation into a much bigger civil conflict, it is also changing the </p>
<p>political climate, and eroding even further Sunni trust in the new political institutions. </p>
<p>We have to come down very hard on the Iraqi government on this.”</p>
<p><b>219. </b> Sir Nigel recommended strengthened US/UK and UK Ministerial co-ordination </p>
<p>structures. There should be monthly meetings of DOP(I) chaired by Mr Blair, with </p>
<p>fortnightly meetings in between chaired alternately by Mr Straw and Dr Reid which </p>
<p>“should aggressively chase progress against our strategy”. </p>
<p><b>220. </b> At the end of his minute, Sir Nigel concluded:</p>
<p>“In short, we have to cut our strategic cloth according to the environment we are </p>
<p>now in and our resources. We cannot turn back the clock to May 2003. Overall, and </p>
<p>in a rough and ready way, our best chance is to ensure that we prop up the centre </p>
<p>in Iraqi politics, do all we can to get an effective government after December, focus </p>
<p>on key improvements meanwhile to the ISF, and ensure an integrated political and </p>
<p>security campaign in Iraq. On that basis we stand a reasonable chance of securing </p>
<p>the political and security transition we want, including starting the draw-down of our </p>
<p>forces next year.”</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>9.4  |  June 2005 to May 2006</p>
<p>525</p>
<p><b>221. </b> Sir Nigel asked Mr Blair whether he agreed with the approach he set out, or </p>
<p>preferred the Red Team approach of “delaying the transition until the insurgency is </p>
<p>significantly reduced”. </p>
<p><b>222. </b> On 19 September, two UK soldiers were arrested by the Iraqi Police Service (IPS) </p>
<p>in Basra.</p>
<p>110</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>223. </b> According to the account provided to No.10 by Dr Reid’s Private Office, the two </p>
<p>soldiers had been parked at the side of a road when an unmarked vehicle with four </p>
<p>men in plain clothes pulled up behind them. Two people got out of the car and walked </p>
<p>towards the soldiers’ vehicle, cocking their weapons. </p>
<p><b>224. </b> The two UK soldiers, believing they were “facing death or serious injury”, opened </p>
<p>fire, killing one of the men and wounding the other. Not realising the men they had shot </p>
<p>were police officers, the soldiers tried to escape but were blocked by police in several </p>
<p>marked vehicles who opened fire. At this point, the two soldiers put down their weapons </p>
<p>and produced their identification. </p>
<p><b>225. </b> Although the uniformed police initially appeared willing to talk constructively </p>
<p>with the soldiers, “the atmosphere changed significantly” when Iraqi plainclothes </p>
<p>police arrived. </p>
<p><b>226. </b> The two UK soldiers were reported to have been beaten and then taken to the </p>
<p>Jameat police station, which was known to house a “notorious detention facility” and </p>
<p>was the home of the serious crimes unit of the Basra police, “which had been infiltrated </p>
<p>by militant elements, especially the Jaysh al-Mahdi and (by his own admission) were </p>
<p>outside the control of the Chief of Police”.</p>
<p><b>227. </b> Negotiations for the return of the arrested soldiers, in line with agreed practice </p>
<p>when Iraqi Security Forces arrested members of the MNF, failed and the negotiators </p>
<p>themselves were unable to leave the Jameat station.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>228. </b> The Governor and Chief of Police in Basra had made it clear that they were not in </p>
<p>a position to offer any assistance and, despite explicit directions by the Chief of Police </p>
<p>to release the two soldiers, the IPS refused to comply. Orders from the Ministry of the </p>
<p>Interior in Baghdad were similarly disregarded. </p>
<p><b>229. </b> A rescue operation was successfully mounted by MND(SE) using armed force to </p>
<p>free the six negotiators and the two soldiers. This was achieved without casualties on </p>
<p>either side but caused significant damage to the wall of the police station and several </p>
<p>police vehicles. The two soldiers who had originally been arrested were found to have </p>
<p>been taken to a house away from the police station and held by what was suspected </p>

<p>become known as “the Jameat incident”. </p>
<p><b>230. </b> Dr Reid updated Cabinet on the incident on 20 September.</p>
<p>112</p>
<p> He emphasised </p>
<p>the need to put the incident in context against the substantial progress made in Iraq, </p>
<p>“which the media had not reported”, specifically the January elections and creation of </p>
<p>the Constitution. Those who opposed the creation of a democratic state in Iraq were </p>
<p>“engaged in frantic and frenetic activity” to stop the Constitution being agreed and the </p>
<p>December elections.</p>
<p><b>231. </b> Mr Blair invited the FCO, the MOD and No.10 to produce a note explaining the </p>
<p>continuing policy of keeping the political process on track and building up the ISF, that </p>
<p>the MNF were in Iraq in support of a UN resolution and that the insurgency “was not a </p>
<p>struggle against occupying forces”. </p>
<p><b>232. </b> On 21 September, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary for Foreign Affairs provided him with </p>
<p>a minute setting out points to make in a phone call with President Bush that afternoon.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In relation to the events at the Jameat police station it said:</p>
<p>“The incident confirms what we already knew: that Sadrists are a serious and malign </p>
<p>force in the Basra Police; the civil authorities in Basra are either ineffectual in dealing </p>
<p>with, or to some extent complicit in this, and that the central government’s influence </p>
<p>is limited. We need a very strong response, both on the Police/armed forces and </p>
<p>with the civil authorities, in both Baghdad and Basra.”</p>
<p><b>233. </b> In their telephone conversation, Mr Blair told President Bush that the events </p>
<p>in Basra showed that “an unrepresentative minority” in the city was prepared to use </p>
<p>violence; a JAM splinter group was involved.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>234. </b> Mr Blair judged that the basic strategy in Iraq remained the right one, with key </p>
<p>tactical questions in the coming months being whether enough was being done on Sunni </p>
<p>outreach and how to establish confidence in the development of the ISF. </p>
<p><b>235. </b> On 21 September, Mr Powell sent Mr Blair a personal note in response to </p>
<p>Sir Nigel’s advice of 19 September.</p>

<p>527</p>
<p><b>236. </b> Mr Powell commended Sir Nigel’s paper as “a serious piece of work” which made </p>
<p>“some good points”. He agreed with the proposed next steps but disagreed with what he </p>
<p>saw as Sir Nigel’s “dismissal of the red team approach”. Mr Powell wrote:</p>
<p>“The Red Team concludes – and no one seriously contests this – that we are in </p>
<p>danger of strategic failure in Iraq, with the situation degenerating into civil war </p>
<p>or even victory for the terrorists. If this is the case then we have to rethink our </p>
<p>strategy and – as important – how we deliver it. The fundamental choice is between </p>
<p>continuing as we are with the principal aim of getting our troops out and handing </p>
<p>over to the Iraqis next year even though we do not believe that the Iraqi government </p>
<p>and security forces will be able to survive alone in the face of the insurgent threat, </p>
<p>or alternatively aiming at success (defined below) and making getting our troops out </p>
<p>next year a subsidiary aim. Once you think about it, I do not think we can responsibly </p>
<p>do anything other than aim at the latter … Nor do I think muddling on is an option. </p>
<p>We are losing the support of even those who supported the war, because they can </p>
<p>see no light at the end of the tunnel. They think we are incompetent and have no </p>
<p>plan to succeed in Iraq. We need a new strategy that people can see and believe </p>
<p>is leading to success if we are to maintain public tolerance. That is why we should </p>
<p>build on the red team analysis and – to a certain extent – their recommendations.” </p>
<p><b>237. </b> Mr Powell recommended:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>More focused and intensified Sunni outreach, splitting the “reconcilable” from the </p>
<p>“irreconcilable” by tackling high unemployment in Sunni regions.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Continuing to pursue Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, but without viewing his death </p>
<p>or capture as a primary aim in itself because “even when we capture him the </p>
<p>insurgency will not be over”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Integrating the military, political and economic strategies and operations </p>
<p>because “at the moment they are running on separate tracks with separate </p>
<p>commands. We need a joint taskforce, as the paper recommends, with one </p>
<p>person in charge. That person should be Khalilzad and he should be reporting </p>
<p>back to you and Bush regularly. It is worth devoting a good deal of your and </p>
<p>Bush’s time to getting it right. We need to reduce the length of the command </p>
<p>and control system and make it more flexible, so that if you and Bush give an </p>
<p>instruction something actually happens on the ground.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ensuring that insurgents were not able to re-take cities after MNF operations – </p>
<p>which meant both an increase in MNF troops and increasing the effectiveness </p>
<p>of the ISF. Mr Powell commented: “Linked to this is the fundamental need, that </p>
<p>you have been banging on about for ages, to have properly trained Iraqi armed </p>
<p>forces and police. We still don’t have either. Why not? … There is no point in </p>
<p>carrying on doing what we are doing at the moment if it is not producing what we </p>
<p>need. In particular, we need to be able to announce a new initiative on the police </p>
<p>within the next month.” He added that it was important to “get something done … </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>528</p>
<p>rather than talking about it. If that requires getting into the detail of it yourself, </p>
<p>then do it”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Rebuilding Iraqi civil society – “we need to take capacity building seriously and </p>
<p>reinforce the judiciary, Ministries etc. You should demand to see a plan.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Ensuring that the new Iraqi Government was firmly “in charge, even if this is </p>
<p>difficult for us. We cannot count on Allawi winning, and indicating we support him </p>
<p>is probably the kiss of death. But we do need a strong national unity government </p>
<p>that puts an end to sectarianism. I am very uncomfortable about the secret </p>
<p>guarantee we appear to have given the Kurds and Shia on federalism … This </p>
<p>could come back to haunt us in a big way.”</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Developing a new strategy for Basra “to be set by the military on the ground with </p>
<p>stronger political support in the consulate [the British Embassy Office Basra]”.</p>
<p><b>238. </b> Mr Powell also emphasised to Mr Blair the importance of making sure that the UK’s </p>
<p>policy was properly understood:</p>
<p>“… you need to start making the argument again both internationally and </p>
<p>domestically instead of keeping silent. We have to explain why this battle matters, </p>
<p>and why it is not in the interest of the rest of the world to watch Iraq going down </p>
<p>the tubes. You need to convince both audiences that there is light at the end of the </p>

<p>does not mean an end to all terrorist attacks, any more than it does in NI [Northern </p>
<p>Ireland] or Palestine. But it does mean that we split the reconcilable from the </p>
<p>irreconcilable insurgents, that the Iraqi government and security forces can control </p>
<p>the situation, that jobs are being created and that something resembling civil society </p>
<p>is beginning to emerge under a democratically elected government.</p>
<p>“Announce a revised strategy … we have lost credibility and you have to </p>
<p>reassure people that there is a plan that will work … Make your speech on Iraq </p>
<p>– Lord Mayor’s Banquet – and then get a real debate going in the country and </p>
<p>internationally rather than trying to stay silent. People have to understand why it </p>
<p>matters to them. And challenge the UN and international community to play their </p>
<p>role.” </p>
<p><b>239. </b> Mr Powell’s note concluded:</p>
<p>“The people dealing with Iraq, particularly in the front line, are not surprisingly tired </p>
<p>and discouraged. Nothing seems to work, and they have given up trying to come up </p>
<p>with new ideas. A weary cynicism and feeling that it is all inevitable has sunk in. It </p>
<p>always does in wars. The job of leadership is to raise their sights, inspire them with a </p>
<p>vision of how the war can be won, set a new strategy, and then ensure it has public </p>
<p>support. If we can’t do that, we are sunk. But it is doable, and we should not give up. </p>

<p>Mr Hilary Benn, the International Development Secretary (by telephone), Gen Walker, </p>

<p>117</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>242. </b> Mr Straw told those present that Mr Blair required a paper which “examined” </p>
<p>current policy. Sir Nigel emphasised that advice was needed on how to deal with the </p>
<p>political and security strands of the existing policy; Mr Blair was not expecting “a sudden </p>
<p>lurch in any direction away from our current plan”. </p>
<p><b>243. </b> In his Iraq update on 23 September, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary told Mr Blair that </p>
<p>Sir Nigel had emphasised that the UK must not be complacent because “internationally </p>
<p>– including in the Arab media and Washington – there were serious questions being </p>
<p>asked about our strategy in the South-East”.</p>
<p>118</p>
<p> Sir Nigel was also reported to have said:</p>
<p>“… we were looking for a smarter and more effective strategy, which was likely </p>
<p>to mean us being more active in certain areas. But no one was suggesting eg a </p>
<p>significant increase in force levels.” </p>
<p><b>244. </b> A record of the meeting by Dr Reid’s Private Secretary said that: </p>
<p>“During discussion it was stressed that the [Jameat] incident … should be seen as a </p>
<p>relatively minor one which had resulted in a great deal of media attention. But on the </p>
<p>ground reporting had now confirmed that the atmospherics in Basra were returning </p>
<p>to normal, though the Governor and Provincial Council were still refusing to engage </p>
<p>with MNF-I. That said, the Consul [General] in Basra had reported that normal </p>
<p>engagement and outreach should be possible by early next week. It was also clear </p>
<p>that … the IPS showed no diminution of support.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>530</p>
<p><b>246. </b> Mr Straw commented that:</p>
<p>“… a change in strategy was not a practical or realistic option. However, we might </p>
<p>wish to adjust our activities on the ground and design ways of responding more </p>
<p>effectively to evolving situations.”</p>
<p><b>247. </b> It was agreed that a paper would be circulated by officials from the FCO, the MOD </p>
<p>and DFID, and sent to Mr Blair the following week. </p>
<p><b>248. </b> It was also agreed that the FCO should pursue the possibility of asking </p>
<p>Sir Ronnie Flanagan, Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England, </p>
<p>Wales and Northern Ireland, to provide an assessment of the IPS in MND(SE). That is </p>
<p>addressed in Section 12.1. </p>
<p><b>249. </b> The Jameat incident had repercussions within the MNF, as Lt Gen Brims’ weekly </p>
<p>report on 25 September explained:</p>
<p>“I believe we acted most skilfully in Basra in how we handled last week’s events and </p>
<p>conducted the operations correctly … My focus was … on the ‘Baghdad fall-out’ of </p>
<p>the events, trying to assuage the concerns of General Casey and, together with the </p>
<p>British Ambassador, dealing with the initial criticism of the British forces’ actions by </p>
<p>senior figures in the Iraqi Transitional Government.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>“General Casey initially received erroneous information on 19 September … that </p>
<p>the British had stormed Basra police station and he believed MND(SE) was acting </p>
<p>under the direction of London rather than the coalition. He told me he had arranged </p>
<p>for a plane to take me [Brims] to Basra to take command of the British battle space </p>
<p>… I gave him accurate information, which did calm him somewhat … Nevertheless, </p>
<p>there was a period when relations with Gen Casey were the most strained I have </p>
<p>experienced, and I believe that the events of 19th September and a number of </p>
<p>subsequent occurrences (including some media handling) has left him with a </p>
<p>residual doubt about whether the UK element of MND(SE) is more under the direct </p>
<p>operational command of London/PJHQ than of MNC-I and the coalition.”</p>
<p>120</p>
<p><b>250. </b> Lt Gen Brims told the Inquiry that this perception had put him in a “slightly awkward </p>
<p>position” and it had lingered for some time after the event.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p><b>251. </b> The ITG had also gained a negative impression of the UK’s actions in Basra on </p>
<p>19 September.</p>
<p>122</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>252. </b> Lt Gen Brims emphasised that it was “vital” to prevent it souring the relationship </p>
<p>and “making it much more difficult for us – and the Coalition generally – to operate”. At </p>
<p>the same time, the ITG needed to be “confronted with the reality of militia-led elements </p>

<p>of Police or Governor”. </p>
<p><b>253. </b> Although Lt Gen Brims reported that he and Mr Patey had “made some progress </p>
<p>along these lines” in their meetings with senior Iraqi leaders, there remained concern </p>
<p>about the way the UK had handled events, in particular the fact that the senior figures </p>
<p>in the ITG had not been aware of the UK’s plans for the operation in which two </p>
<p>leading members of a JAM splinter group had been arrested. A member of the ITG </p>
<p>proposed that ground rules should be agreed for covert operations by the MNF, which </p>
<p>Lt Gen Brims considered reasonable.</p>
<p><b>254. </b> An FCO paper produced some time later, in April 2006, suggested that the UK </p>
<p>recognised at the time of the Jameat incident that: </p>
<p>“… stability [in Basra] was threatened by intense rivalry among political parties and </p>
<p>their militias who had an interest in criminality … At that time, we recognised that our </p>
<p>only real option was to maintain the course we had set and to see the job through. </p>
<p>Asserting direct control over local government and institutions was, and remains, out </p>
<p>of the question. Pulling out of Basra, and leaving a political and security vacuum in a </p>
<p>key strategic area was equally unacceptable.”</p>
<p>123</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>255. </b> On 22 September, a senior government official specialising in the Middle East </p>
<p>wrote to Mr Asquith to explain that an approach had been received:</p>
<p>“… from Muqtada al-Sadr to establish a discreet dialogue with HMG following recent </p>
<p>events in southern Iraq … Subject to your views [a plan was being drawn up] to </p>
<p>meet representatives of al-Sadr in Amman in the near future …</p>
<p>“… the message he had received from al-Sadr was that he wanted to resolve the </p>
<p>current difficulties in southern Iraq. He was prepared to make calming statements </p>
<p>to his people, but could not do so with [JAM1]</p>
<p>124</p>
<p> in detention. [JAM1] was important </p>
<p>to him and he needed him to be released. The reaction to events in Basra was </p>
<p>upsetting his preparations for the elections in December. He was prepared to send </p>
<p>senior representatives to Amman to meet British representatives and to discuss what </p>
<p>could be done.”</p>
<p>125</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>256. </b> The response had been that the UK Government could not negotiate over the </p>
<p>detention of JAM1 because:</p>
<p>“We had evidence he was behind recent attacks on British troops in MND(SE) and </p>
<p>linked to Lebanese Hizballah and the Iranians. We also said we were surprised </p>

<p>reasons. </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>532</p>
<p>al-Sadr remained close to [JAM1], as we had understood [JAM1] was no longer </p>
<p>under the control of al-Sadr. The action against [JAM1] had not been directed at </p>
<p>al-Sadr, but at an organiser of lethal attacks against UK forces. HMG saw al-Sadr’s </p>
<p>increasing involvement in the political process as a positive development and one to </p>
<p>be encouraged. [The organisation to which the senior official belonged] believed it </p>
<p>would be in his [MAS1’s] interests to distance himself from people such as [JAM1].”</p>
<p><b>257. </b> The individual making the approach, to whom the Inquiry will refer as MAS1: </p>
<p>“… considered that when he passed back the message of no negotiation over the </p>
<p>detention of [JAM1], al-Sadr would still be interested in his representatives meeting </p>
<p>HMG officials … without preconditions, to discuss the broader way ahead. [MAS1] </p>
<p>felt that al-Sadr wanted to continue moving in to mainstream politics, but to do this </p>
<p>he needed to resolve the conflicts in the South. His attempt to have [JAM1] released </p>
<p>did not necessarily mean that they were still closely associated. It could be that </p>
<p>al-Sadr was not strong enough to be seen publicly to abandon [JAM1]. If [there was </p>
<p>confirmation] … that HMG wanted to go ahead with a meeting, he would find out </p>
<p>who would represent al-Sadr in advance. In return … [MAS1] would need to confirm </p>
<p>who was coming from HMG, ie officials from the FCO or …”</p>
<p><b>258. </b> Mr Asquith was advised that MAS1:</p>
<p>“… has sufficient track record to warrant taking this approach seriously. The value </p>
<p>of proceeding with a meeting … would depend on who was designated as al-Sadr’s </p>
<p>representative. But in current circumstances, I suggest it would be worthwhile </p>
<p>establishing a channel to al-Sadr, if only to explain why UK forces took the action </p>
<p>they did in Basra. If the channel develops, it could help to reduce tension in </p>
<p>MND(SE) and, more broadly, assist in the political process as we move towards the </p>
<p>referendum and elections. It would therefore act as a line of Shia outreach in parallel </p>
<p>to those … with the Sunnis.” </p>
<p><b>259. </b> The recommendation was for a meeting with Muqtada al-Sadr’s representatives.</p>
<p><b>260. </b> Mr Asquith wrote on the minute: “I agree the meeting should proceed.”</p>
<p>126</p>
<p> He added </p>
<p>that Mr Patey must be kept “fully in the picture” and that establishing a nominated </p>
<p>representative of Muqtada al-Sadr in Basra was an important objective for the meeting. </p>
<p><b>261. </b> On 27 September, Mr Patey sent a report to the FCO in London entitled ‘Sadrist </p>
<p>Outreach’.</p>
<p>127</p>
<p> In it he reported a meeting with MAS1, “a senior Sadrist understood to be </p>
<p>close to Muqtada al-Sadr” who “claims [JAM1] innocent of charges against him and of </p>
<p>attacks on British forces and asks for his immediate release” and suggested that “his </p>
<p>continued detention will ensure the hostility of Jaysh al-Mahdi to British forces in Basra”. </p>

<p>533</p>
<p><b>262. </b> Mr Patey said in response that the UK welcomed the participation of Sadrists in the </p>
<p>political process and hoped to see it continue. But the UK “would not hesitate to respond </p>
<p>firmly to those who attacked British troops”. JAM1 had been detained because the UK </p>
<p>had credible evidence that he had been involved in such attacks. He was believed to </p>
<p>have been operating outside the control of Muqtada al-Sadr and JAM. His detention </p>
<p>“should be understood as action taken against a specific individual; it was not part of any </p>
<p>broader policy to work against the Sadrist movement”. </p>
<p><b>263. </b> Mr Patey reported that MAS1 had responded:</p>
<p>“[JAM1] was very popular in the Jaysh al-Mahdi. By detaining him, we would destroy </p>
<p>any chance of winning over the Jaysh al-Mahdi in Basra and instead cause it to turn </p>
<p>wholly against the UK forces. Rather than helping strengthen the national forces we </p>
<p>said we wanted to support, UK action would be a reason for Iranian rejoicing.”</p>
<p><b>264. </b> Mr Patey had “emphasised our concern to protect our troops” and that JAM1 had </p>
<p>admitted, whilst in custody, participating in previous attacks against UK soldiers. </p>
<p>Mr Patey said that:</p>
<p>“We would look again at the information we held but [MAS1] should not be under </p>
<p>any illusion – there was no chance that [JAM1] would be released any time soon … </p>
<p>it was important not to make too much of [JAM1]’s case against the wider backdrop.”</p>
<p><b>265. </b> At the end of his report, Mr Patey commented:</p>
<p>“It was striking that [MAS1] did not once refer to Muqtada al-Sadr by name and it is </p>
<p>difficult to assess the state of [MAS1]’s current relationship with al-Sadr. Most of the </p>
<p>views he expressed reflect standard Sadrist lines but it may be that his defence of </p>
<p>[JAM1] was stronger than that which al-Sadr himself might have offered. I am still </p>
<p>waiting for the Minister of Transport (Sadrist) to return to Baghdad. When he does </p>
<p>I will continue my Sadrist outreach campaign.”</p>
<p><b>266. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary confirmed on 29 September that Mr Straw had seen </p>
<p>the minute from the senior official and “agrees with your proposal to open a channel </p>
<p>to al-Sadr”.</p>

<p><b>267. </b> At the end of September the JIC tasked itself to produce an Assessment of the </p>

<p> It judged that:</p>
<p>“Despite an increase in the number of lethal attacks on the Coalition by a few Shia </p>

<p>comparison to other parts of the country. But this position is fragile: popular support </p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>534</p>
<p>for the Coalition presence is diminishing. Recent incidents in Basra will increase </p>
<p>animosity to the Multi-National Forces (MNF) in some quarters …</p>
<p>“Shia political factions, including some violent extremists, are able to exert strong </p>
<p>influence on local Iraqi authorities and security forces. Most members of the security </p>
<p>forces, particularly the police, have multiple loyalties. Under pressure their reliability </p>
<p>will be doubtful. A significant number actively colludes with Shia extremist militias. </p>
<p>The current Iraqi government has neither the will nor capacity to tackle these </p>
<p>problems: this will probably not change after the elections.”</p>
<p><b>268. </b> The JIC concluded that:</p>
<p>“In the South the widespread expectation of MNF withdrawal, together with the </p>
<p>current focus on manoeuvring for December’s elections, is adding pressure to </p>
<p>a complex political and security landscape … The security situation is unlikely </p>
<p>to improve in the build up to the elections. Shia politics in the South are deeply </p>
<p>fractured … Criminal groups will … exploit the absence of effective civil authority. </p>
<p>Shia extremists from all groups will resort to violence: against the MNF, rival factions, </p>
<p>or the Sunni minority. Deepening sectarian tensions and further attacks by Sunni </p>
<p>Arab insurgents and jihadists are likely. Managing these pressures will depend </p>
<p>crucially on whether al Sadr encourages renewed violence or remains willing and </p>
<p>able to restrain his followers.”</p>
<p><b>269. </b> On 30 September, Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary sent Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary a paper containing the advice of FCO, MOD and DFID officials on the </p>
<p>implications of the Jameat incident.</p>
<p>130</p>
<p> Mr Straw had not yet seen and agreed their </p>
<p>advice. The paper said:</p>
<p>“The … incident … highlights what was previously more opaque, that we face acute </p>
<p>challenges in achieving our objectives in the South-East region. Stability in the </p>
<p>South-East is being threatened by intense rivalry among political parties and their </p>
<p>militias. Criminality, jockeying for patronage and leaders’ differing political visions </p>
<p>are being exacerbated by tribalism and increasing religiosity. Specifically, this has </p>
<p>a severe impact on the effectiveness of the police service. In better circumstances </p>
<p>police training should by now have gone beyond the basics to deal with the broader </p>
<p>problems posed by divergent loyalties to both militias and police.” </p>
<p><b>270. </b> The paper observed that “alternative options to our current policy are limited”. As </p>
<p>the UK was no longer an Occupying Power, “<b>asserting direct British control</b> over local </p>

<p>government and rule of [law] institutions is out of the question” and pulling troops out </p>
<p>more rapidly would leave a vacuum. The authors therefore concluded:</p>
<p>“<b>Our only realistic option is to maintain our course and see the job through. </b></p>
<p>But<b> we need to make adjustments to our policy</b>, while sticking to our strategic </p>
<p>approach of ensuring in due course successful transition of responsibility for rule of </p>
<p>law in the south-east to the Iraqis.” </p>
<p><b>271. </b> The paper identified a practical problem; the possibility of reprisal attacks against </p>
<p>UK personnel made it questionable when UK civilian trainers and mentors could return </p>
<p>to work alongside Iraqis after their current period of lockdown.</p>
<p><b>272. </b> The authors recommended a number of actions including:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>getting a “clear commitment from Baghdad politicians to grip the South-East”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>persuading the Interior Minister to visit Basra immediately;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>demonstrating “to the international community (in particular, the US) that we can </p>
<p>handle the situation”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>putting an “effective Chief of Police in place”; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>despatching “a senior UK police officer (eg Sir Ronnie Flanagan) with relevant </p>
<p>background in such sectarian issues to audit the police in MND(SE)”. </p>
<p><b>273. </b> The paper also cautioned that “we may not be able to deliver, by next year, the </p>
<p>minimum standards required in rule of law and governance” and that “we will need to </p>
<p>allocate more resources, which might include military resources, to security”.</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>274. </b> An Iraqi investigation into the Jameat incident concluded by early October that </p>
<p>“80 percent of the blame was down to the British”.</p>
<p>131</p>
<p> Mr Patey reported that the ITG was </p>
<p>unlikely to publish the investigation report as “we will have no choice but to take issue </p>
<p>with it”. Of most concern was the failure of the ITG to act on militia infiltration of the </p>
<p>Basra police. </p>
<p><b>275. </b> SIS3 told the Inquiry that the event was a “wake-up call” to what was happening in </p>
<p>Basra, where the police had become integrated with the militias, and commented that: </p>
<p>“What we were looking for … was Iraqiisation. What we ended up with at this point </p>
<p>was a different kind of Iraqiisation … In other words, we were pulling back and the </p>
<p>Iraqi Government was not occupying the space, I think because it was too early </p>
<p>for the Iraqi Government to be able to do that. So in that gap you ended up with a </p>
<p>different kind of Iraqiisation, which was militia-isation, criminalisation, intimidation, </p>

<p><b>278. </b> In Mr Blair’s view, the insurgency had to be presented “clearly and plainly” as an </p>
<p>obstacle to, not the pretext for, withdrawal. He added:</p>
<p>“The ‘ink-spot’ strategy is right. It isn’t what we’ve done so far … This needs to be </p>
<p>articulated, planned and followed through.” </p>
<p><b>279. </b> Mr Blair also supported “behind-the-scenes” help for Mr Allawi, reaching out to the </p>
<p>Sadrists to bring them “into some sort of understanding”, and emphasised that “we are </p>
<p>totally underestimating the degree to which the present problems are the product of bad </p>
<p>government”. </p>
<p><b>280. </b> On the police, Mr Blair commented: “We need someone put in charge of sorting </p>
<p>out this mess.” He supported the recommendation to strengthen the UK’s co-ordinating </p>
<p>machinery at Ministerial level, proposing that he would chair fortnightly meetings.</p>
<p><b>281. </b> Mr Blair wrote:</p>
<p>“I also favour giving JR [Reid] the lead as much as possible. We should split it up. </p>
<p>JR on security, Iraqiisation and to be out there defending the case. JS [Straw] on </p>

<p><b>283. </b> In discussion about Iraq, Mr Blair described the December election as “a one-off </p>
<p>opportunity to deliver a strong, moderate central government” and identified four </p>
<p>priorities for the period ahead:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ensuring the Sunni outreach strategy was delivered;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>refining the coalition’s public message to be clear that it wanted to begin draw </p>
<p>down the following year, depending on the state of the insurgency and the ISF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>getting the police training strategy right; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>drawing the right lessons from the Red Team Report about securing cities </p>
<p>from which terrorists had been removed, including by developing local civil </p>
<p>authorities. </p>
<p><b>284. </b> On 3 October, a senior government official specialising in the Middle East (1) wrote </p>
<p>to Mr Asquith with an account of the meeting that had been authorised in September.</p>
<p>136</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He wrote that during the meeting it had become evident that MAS1 “was not speaking on </p>
<p>behalf of al-Sadr and was pursuing a personal initiative to effect the release of [JAM1]”:</p>
<p>“[MAS1’s] stance was unequivocal: the detention of [JAM1] represented a major </p>
<p>obstacle to stability in Basra and HMG could instead be encouraging Iraqi Shia, like </p>
<p>[JAM1], who opposed Iranian interference in Iraq’s affairs. [JAM1]’s arrest sent a </p>
<p>clear signal that HMG supported the unrepresentative ‘pro-Tehran’ government in </p>
<p>Baghdad. Curiously, [MAS1] conceded that [JAM1] had British blood on his hands </p>
<p>from an earlier stage of the conflict but said that, since OMS [Office of the Martyr </p>
<p>Sadr]’s change of policy, these earlier crimes were no longer relevant.”</p>
<p><b>285. </b> In response, MAS1 had been told that “[JAM1]’s arrest was in response to criminal </p>
<p>activity and was not a political issue” and the senior official reported that no commitment </p>
<p>was made, “beyond agreeing to convey [MAS1]’s concerns to London”. </p>
<p><b>286. </b> It was unclear how good the relationship was between Muqtada al-Sadr and </p>
<p>MAS1. In an attached report a different official said that there were indications elsewhere </p>
<p>that senior OMS officials were lobbying current and former members of the Iraqi </p>
<p>Government in an effort to secure JAM1’s release. </p>
<p><b>287. </b> The senior official proposed to test the extent to which the exchange reflected </p>
<p>the views of Muqtada al-Sadr, by sending a message through other means seeking </p>
<p>confirmation of his support. </p>
<p><b>288. </b> Mr Asquith responded to say that before doing so the senior official should check </p>
<p>that Mr Patey was content.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>538</p>
<p><b>289. </b> On 4 October, Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote to Mr Straw’s Principal Private Secretary </p>
<p>in response to the FCO/MOD/DFID paper of 30 September on the implications of the </p>
<p>Jameat incident.</p>
<p>138</p>
<p> Copies of the letter were sent to Cabinet Office, MOD, DFID, FCO, </p>
<p>Home Office and Treasury officials as well as to C, to GCHQ and to diplomatic posts </p>
<p>in Iraq, the US, Brussels, and across the Middle East. </p>
<p><b>290. </b> Sir Nigel wrote:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister agrees that we do not need to change our overall strategy. </p>
<p>He is convinced, however, that we need a major and sustained push over the next </p>
<p>few months on the political and security lines of operation if we are to get what </p>
<p>we need – the political process moving ahead on time and producing an effective </p>
<p>and moderate Iraqi Government after the elections, with visible progress on the </p>
<p>Iraqiisation of security. </p>
<p>“This will require changes above all in the intensity of our work, in our (and the </p>
<p>Americans’) implementation of policy, and the structures for delivering them, and will </p>
<p>need to be underpinned by a more effective communications strategy.”</p>
<p><b>291. </b> Sir Nigel went on to set out Mr Blair’s views in relation to policy on the political </p>
<p>process, on security and on reconstruction.</p>
<p><b>292. </b> On the first, Sir Nigel reported that Mr Blair did not believe that the UK or US were </p>
<p>active enough. In his view:</p>
<p>“Higher Sunni turn out in December’s elections is the key to a successful political </p>
<p>process, leading to an increased willingness by Sunni politicians to take part in a </p>
<p>representative coalition government.”</p>
<p><b>293. </b> Mr Blair considered that the situation required:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a more vigorous and co-ordinated US and UK plan of activity focused on contact </p>
<p>with Sunni politicians;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued engagement with Iraqi leaders who could play a leading role in </p>
<p>effective government after the elections;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>pressure on Iraq’s neighbours to support the political process;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>effective lines of communication to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani and </p>
<p>Muqtada al-Sadr; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a revitalised UN effort on political dialogue; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a programme of high-level UK engagement in South-East Iraq, including </p>
<p>Ministerial visits. </p>

<p>539</p>
<p><b>294. </b> In order to repair the UK position following the Jameat incident, the MOD and the </p>
<p>FCO were asked to work up a form of words “to draw a line under this issue and enable </p>
<p>future co-operation”. </p>
<p><b>295. </b> Mr Straw was asked to lead on drawing together and monitoring the </p>
<p>implementation of the political strategy. </p>
<p><b>296. </b> On security, Mr Blair looked forward to regular reports from Dr Reid, including </p>
<p>analysis of the effectiveness of the new Iraqi forces. Mr Blair was concerned that the </p>
<p>poor state of the IPS would be a drag on further progress and Sir Nigel wrote:</p>
<p>“It is clear that we need to review whether our police training strategy in the </p>
<p>South-East is working, and whether the national policing strategy knits together.”</p>
<p><b>297. </b> Sir Nigel reported that Mr Blair agreed Sir Ronnie Flanagan should be asked to </p>
<p>visit Iraq and that he wanted a UK Minister to take ownership of the overall policing </p>
<p>strategy, including liaison with the US over national strategy, supported by a dedicated </p>
<p>team in London.</p>
<p><b>298. </b> On the Red Team Report, Sir Nigel wrote:</p>
<p>“The ‘ink-spot strategy’ … may not be exactly right. But it highlights the vulnerability </p>
<p>of our efforts so far to reclaim key cities from the terrorists. It also, rightly in the </p>
<p>Prime Minister’s view, stresses the importance of co-ordinated implementation, </p>
<p>involving both the Coalition and the Iraqis …</p>
<p>“There is still some uncertainty over the fate of the Red Team Report. We should </p>
<p>press Khalilzad and Casey to agree an authoritative plan for the next few months, </p>
<p>working with UK counterparts.” </p>
<p><b>299. </b> Dr Reid was asked to oversee the overall security strategy. A video conference </p>
<p>involving President Bush, Mr Blair, Gen Casey and Lt Gen Brims, Ambassador Khalilzad </p>
<p>and Mr Patey would be held in the week of 10 October to “help focus on some of </p>
<p>these issues”. </p>
<p><b>300. </b> The minute said that Mr Blair was planning a major speech on Iraq, and that No.10 </p>
<p>Press Office would co-ordinate other Ministerial media activity. A key challenge was to </p>
<p>communicate that substantial troop withdrawals were planned in 2006, provided that </p>
<p>Iraqi capabilities built up as planned. </p>
<p><b>301. </b> On structures, Sir Nigel reported that Mr Blair planned to chair a meeting of DOP(I) </p>
<p>every fortnight if possible. Sir Nigel would chair weekly meetings of senior officials. </p>
<p>Mr Straw and Dr Reid were also to chair regular Ministerial meetings in their areas. </p>
<p><b>302. </b> Sir Nigel would also be discussing more effective ways for the UK to join up with </p>
<p>the US system, including the creation of a joint working group on political strategy in the </p>
<p>run up to elections. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>540</p>
<p><b>303. </b> On 5 October, Lieutenant General Andrew Ridgway, the Chief of Defence </p>
<p>Intelligence, sent an account of his recent visit to Iraq to Gen Walker and senior </p>
<p>members of the MOD.</p>
<p>139 </p>
<p><b>304. </b> The report highlighted the “very apparent deterioration in the security situation in </p>
<p>Baghdad over successive visits” and that sectarian tensions were at “an unprecedented </p>
<p>level”. The “best figures” Lt Gen Ridgway could obtain were that some 150 bodies, </p>
<p>mainly Sunni Arabs, were being found per week. AQ-I and others had benefited from the </p>
<p>resulting backlash. </p>
<p><b>305. </b> Lt Gen Ridgway wrote:</p>
<p>“Whichever way you look at the metrics of the insurrection in terms of attacks, </p>
<p>bombings, killings, public opinion and so on, the clear conclusion is that the security </p>
<p>situation is getting progressively worse. This is occurring despite the progress </p>
<p>with the political process, the investment in infrastructure and the significant </p>
<p>improvement in the capability of the ISF … if the trend of the last two years </p>
<p>continues the conclusions must be that, unless we do something very different, we </p>
<p>will get progressively further away from the point where conditions are conducive to </p>
<p>drawdown. Indeed even a very significant improvement will not begin to get us close </p>
<p>to this sort of outcome.” </p>
<p><b>306. </b> On 5 October, Mr Asquith sent advice to Mr Straw on key Iraq issues for the </p>
<p>coming three months and how to tackle them.</p>
<p>140</p>
<p> He wrote:</p>
<p>“We need to keep the Sunni Arabs engaged in the political process by focusing them </p>
<p>on the sixty-two laws required by the Constitution to regulate basic principles. Only </p>
<p>by being represented in the Council of Representatives (the new National Assembly) </p>
<p>will they be able to influence the legislative content.”</p>
<p><b>307. </b> Mr Asquith judged that: “Domination of the political scene (and TNA) by a Shia </p>
<p>Islamist and assertive Kurdish bloc has resulted in an imperfect Constitution”, and </p>
<p>stressed the need to build the centre ground. </p>
<p><b>308. </b> Other actions identified by Mr Asquith included building the centre ground in Iraqi </p>
<p>politics, keeping the coalition together, securing a new Security Council resolution, </p>
<p>building relationships with key US players and improving Whitehall mechanisms. </p>
<p><b>309. </b> Mr Asquith advised that:</p>
<p>“The creation of a small group of Ministers (Foreign, Defence and International </p>
<p>Development Secretaries) and senior officials … meeting on a regular basis </p>
<p>(eg fortnightly) might provide the opportunity to talk through complex and key </p>

<p><b>311. </b> President Talabani and Mr Blair met at No.10 on 6 October.</p>
<p>142</p>
<p> A record of the </p>

<p>would increase because they “regretted their boycott in January”. He agreed with </p>
<p>Mr Blair that the UK must “do all we could to encourage greater Sunni participation, </p>
<p>through contact work in Iraq and with the regional players, especially Jordan and </p>
<p>Saudi Arabia”. </p>
<p><b>312. </b> In a brief one-to-one exchange, President Talabani emphasised that “the UK had </p>
<p>to be very active on the Sunni outreach agenda if [we] were to get the right outcome </p>
<p>in December”.</p>
<p><b>313. </b> Mr Blair asked President Talabani to take a personal interest in forced returns to </p>
<p>Iraq from the UK as he “attached great importance to early progress” on the issue. </p>
<p><b>314. </b> At the press conference after the meeting, Mr Blair told reporters that the continued </p>
<p>presence of the MNF in Iraq was “about making sure that we remain until the Iraqi forces </p>
<p>are capable of securing their own country and so that Iraq is then capable of becoming a </p>
<p>proper functioning and sovereign democracy, as it should be”.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>315. </b> When President Talabani spoke he addressed those calling for a drawdown of </p>
<p>UK troops:</p>
<p>“… we too want to see an end of the presence of the Multi-National Force, but </p>
<p>the actions of the terrorists are keeping them there. An early pull-out would be a </p>
<p>catastrophe for the people of Iraq and for the cause of democracy and it will be a win </p>
<p>for terrorism.”</p>
<p><b>316. </b> In the questions that followed, Mr Blair was asked about allegations of Iranian </p>
<p>involvement in Iraq. He told reporters:</p>
<p>“What is clear is that there have been new explosive devices used, not just against </p>
<p>British troops but elsewhere in Iraq. The particular nature of those devices lead us </p>
<p>either to Iranian elements or to Hizballah … that is funded and supported by Iran. </p>

<p>Transcript of Press Conference Given by the Prime Minister, Mr Tony Blair, and the Iraqi President, </p>
<p>Mr Jalal Talabani in London on Thursday, 6 October 2005. </p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>542</p>
<p><b>317. </b> Whilst British forces were in Iraq under a UN mandate, Mr Blair warned that “There </p>
<p>is no justification for Iran or any other country interfering in Iraq …”</p>
<p><b>318. </b> On 10 October, Dr Reid told Parliament that in November 2005 the UK would </p>
<p>be reducing the number of its troops in Iraq from approximately 8,500 to 8,000.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p> He </p>
<p>explained that: “The United Kingdom is in Iraq for as long as we are needed and as long </p>
<p>as we need to be there, and no longer.” </p>
<p><b>319. </b> Dr Reid described the situation in Basra as “largely calm” after the Jameat </p>
<p>incident, which he characterised as “an extremely complex operation in defence of </p>
<p>our own soldiers”. </p>
<p><b>320. </b> The change in the number of UK troops in Iraq reflected:</p>
<p>“… the closure of two small bases in Basra, the transfer of some training tasks to the </p>
<p>Iraqi security forces and structural differences between the two brigades. These are </p>
<p>relatively minor adjustments, however, and will not affect activities being carried out </p>
<p>by United Kingdom forces.” </p>
<p><b>321. </b> In October 2005, the Joint Committee to Transfer Security Responsibility (JCTSR) </p>
<p>produced ‘Conditions for Provincial Transfer’, which set the framework for the MNF-I to </p>
<p>transfer security responsibility to an Iraqi civilian authority.</p>
<p>145</p>
<p> The document set out a </p>
<p>series of standards in four areas: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the insurgency threat; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>ISF capability;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>governance capacity; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>residual support from coalition forces. </p>
<p><b>322. </b> For a province to be deemed ready for transfer to Iraqi control, the document said </p>
<p>that the MNF-I, the Iraqi Ministries of Interior and Defence and the National Intelligence </p>
<p>Co-ordination Council would all need to have assessed the terrorist/insurgent threat </p>
<p>level (including external border security) in that province as “low” and either forecast </p>
<p>it as “steady or on a downward trend”. The IPS’s crime assessment and the presence </p>
<p>of armed groups must not materially change these assessments. Threats to critical </p>
<p>infrastructure and communications should also be assessed as low, and a programme </p>
<p>for handing in unauthorised weapons should be in place.</p>
<p><b>323. </b> The standards set out for the IPS included that they should be assessed by </p>
<p>the MOI and the MNF-I to have the capacity to maintain domestic order, to prevent </p>
<p>a resurgence of terrorism, and to co-ordinate counter-insurgency (COIN) operations </p>

<p>with the Iraqi Army and Special Police. Border guards should be capable of interdicting </p>
<p>cross-border support to insurgents and terrorists.</p>
<p><b>324. </b> In relation to the Iraqi Army, standards included having the capability to lead COIN </p>
<p>operations, and contain the insurgency in co-ordination with the IPS. Logistics systems </p>
<p>capable of sustaining operations, with coalition assistance, should be in place, as should </p>
<p>mechanisms to co-ordinate the response to requests for assistance from the IPS and to </p>
<p>ensure the security of strategic infrastructure. </p>
<p><b>325. </b> In governance terms, the Provincial Governor should be assessed as capable of </p>
<p>overseeing security operations and the Provincial Joint Co-ordination Centre and Joint </p>
<p>Operations Room should be in operation, to co-ordinate and monitor. Ministry structures </p>
<p>and intelligence capabilities should be capable of supporting provincial operations, and </p>
<p>systems for detention, trial and incarceration should be in place. </p>
<p><b>326. </b> On coalition forces, the document specified that they should maintain the capability </p>
<p>and posture to reinforce if ISF capabilities were exceeded, and to conduct counter-</p>
<p>terrorism operations. They should co-ordinate civil construction activities and provide </p>
<p>support and force protection for Transition Teams operating in the area. </p>
<p><b>327. </b> During a visit to Washington from 10 to 11 October, Sir Nigel Sheinwald reported to </p>
<p>Mr Hadley that Mr Blair considered “a surge of UK-US effort” was needed over the next </p>
<p>few months, in capitals and in Iraq, starting with regular video conferences.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p> Mr Hadley </p>
<p>“stressed the need for these to draw up detailed implementation plans and then ensure </p>
<p>that there was the necessary follow-through”. </p>
<p><b>328. </b> The Assessments Staff issued an intelligence update on prospects for the </p>
<p>constitutional referendum on 11 October.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p> They judged:</p>
<p>“A majority of Iraqis from across all governorates intend to vote in the referendum, </p>
<p>according to polling carried out by the US State Department, although the poll </p>
<p>showed that public awareness of the content of the Constitution was limited.”</p>
<p><b>329. </b> The Assessments Staff reported that the referendum coincided with Ramadan, </p>
<p>which in previous years had been marked by increased violence. There were </p>
<p>suggestions that some insurgents were trying to disrupt referendum preparations and </p>
<p>intimidate voters. </p>
<p><b>330. </b> The number of attacks across the country had risen to more than 100 a day from a </p>
<p>daily average of about 75 four weeks earlier. The MNF predicted a surge of co-ordinated </p>
<p>attacks closer to polling day, but there was no intelligence about insurgent tactics on the </p>
<p>day itself. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>544</p>
<p><b>331. </b> The Assessments Staff reported that Sunni political groups did not consider they </p>
<p>had sufficient votes to veto the Constitution, and judged that “local Sunni tribal leaders </p>
<p>will have considerable sway over the voters in their area; some have recommended a </p>
<p>‘no’ vote, but we do not know the views of many others”. </p>
<p><b>332. </b> By 12 October, Iraqi parties agreed a series of amendments to the draft </p>
<p>Constitution, including: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthening the provisions guaranteeing the unity of Iraq;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>making clear that membership of the Ba’ath Party was not, in itself, a reason </p>
<p>for exclusion from public office and providing that de-Ba’athification was to be </p>
<p>subject to review by a separate body; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>clarification over the use of official languages (Arabic and Kurdish were </p>
<p>designated national official languages throughout Iraq, though with the </p>
<p>expectation that Kurdish would be used primarily within Kurdistan; Turcoman </p>
<p>and Syrian were official languages within the areas where they were spoken); </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>providing for a constitutional review body to review the Constitution and make </p>
<p>recommendations for change to the National Assembly within four months.</p>
<p>148</p>
<p><b>333. </b> The last point met a long-standing Sunni Arab demand for a major role for the next </p>
<p>National Assembly in approving the Constitution.</p>
<p><b>334. </b> Dr Reid sent Mr Powell a draft of a paper on security for consideration by DOP(I) </p>
<p>on 11 October, describing it as “inadequate, but a start”.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>335. </b> Dr Reid wrote that his paper was “meant as the first step in what is really required – </p>
<p>which is a detailed and co-ordinated Implementation plan”.</p>
<p><b>336. </b> DOP(I) met on 12 October and considered two papers: one from the IPU on the </p>

<p>Committee that the legal framework for MNF operations in Iraq expired at the end of </p>
<p>2005. As a result:</p>
<p>“We need the ITG to state publicly its requirement for a continued MNF-I presence. </p>
<p>This will be politically sensitive. We therefore need to distance the roll over from the </p>
<p>electoral campaign. We have agreed with the US to present a short resolution …  </p>
<p>to the UNSC [United Nations Security Council] soon after the referendum for </p>
<p>adoption by the end of October. From lobbying of partners and UNSC members  </p>
<p>this looks achievable.”</p>
<p><b>339. </b> Dr Reid reported in his paper that “the general level of activity among the </p>
<p>insurgency remains broadly unchanged across Iraq”.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p> Although there had been an </p>
<p>increase in the number of lethal attacks on the MNF within MND(SE), the situation </p>
<p>remained calm in comparison to other parts of Iraq:</p>
<p>“The position, however, is fragile with the militias able to promote unrest when they </p>
<p>choose.” </p>
<p><b>340. </b> Dr Reid judged that “successful Iraqiisation remains the key”. Progress with the </p>
<p>Iraqi Security Forces was satisfactory, progress with the Iraqi Police Service less so. </p>
<p>Dr Reid proposed that the UK should review its strategy on policing. If responsibility </p>
<p>should fall to the MOD, then “it is imperative that the resource issue is resolved </p>
<p>unequivocally”. </p>
<p><b>341. </b> Dr Reid’s paper also commented on the Red Team Report: </p>
<p>“Whilst the report is accurate in its analysis, it defines a strategic approach that could </p>
<p>only have been successful if it had been adopted at the outset of military operations; </p>
<p>it is not consistent with either existing MNF strategy, or the scale of economic and </p>
<p>military investment. </p>
<p>“It seems likely, however, that some elements of the plan (e.g. boosting Ministry </p>
<p>capacity and greater co-ordination of military and non-military activity) will be </p>
<p>followed up rather than the Red Team Report being adopted wholesale. <b>We will </b></p>
<p><b>need to work with the US on incorporating these elements into an authoritative </b></p>
<p><b>plan which can be agreed with the Iraqi government</b>.”</p>
<p><b>342. </b> Dr Reid promised a plan for enhanced engagement with the US by MOD Ministers, </p>
<p>the military and senior officials. He also committed to:</p>
<p>“Institute regular (weekly or fortnightly) ad hoc ministerial meetings in MOD to </p>
<p>oversee Iraq security issues to which other government departments will be invited.” </p>

<p><b>343. </b> Finally, Dr Reid’s paper considered the UK’s “overall Iraq strategy”: </p>
<p>“Our overall approach on Iraq across Government needs more coherence. </p>
<p>The following steps would help:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A highlighting of our objectives for the end of 2005 and for the end of 2006, </p>
<p>along with any milestones in between.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>A definition of what would constitute success (preferably in measurable </p>
<p>terms) in the political, military and social/reconstruction spheres.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>The establishment of an ad-hoc communications group chaired by a Minister </p>
<p>to oversee our approach.”</p>
<p><b>344. </b> DOP(I) agreed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the MOD should take the lead on police issues in Iraq as the situation called for </p>
<p>paramilitary rather than civilian policing;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Blair should reinforce UK concerns about the need for a consistent approach </p>
<p>to the insurgency during his next video conference with President Bush; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>UK concerns about conditions in Iraqi detention facilities should be followed up </p>
<p>with Iraqi authorities.</p>
<p>153</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>345. </b> Mr Blair also agreed with Dr Reid’s proposal that an increased focus on </p>
<p>communications on Iraq was needed. Ministers agreed that Dr Reid should convene </p>
<p>meetings on communications issues.</p>
<p><b>346. </b> Mr Straw told DOP(I) that the next few months would be a crucial period for Iraq. </p>
<p>Although the political process was on timetable, this was not the same as on track. </p>
<p><b>347. </b> Mr Blair said that there were two essential objectives: to ensure good Sunni </p>
<p>turn-out at the elections, and to ensure that any Shia or Iranian backlash against efforts </p>
<p>to achieve a more inclusive, centrist government could be dealt with. </p>
<p><b>348. </b> In discussion, Ministers noted that the Constitution was likely to be agreed by the </p>
<p>referendum, although this could not be taken for granted. The UK needed to have </p>
<p>fall-backs ready. </p>
<p><b>349. </b> DOP(I) agreed that the UK should work even more closely with the US to deliver </p>
<p>a significant Sunni turn-out at the elections and as centrist a government as possible, </p>
<p>and that Mr Straw should update colleagues on progress against the objectives at </p>
<p>subsequent DOP(I) meetings. </p>
<p><b>350. </b> Mr Straw wrote to DOP(I) members the following day, advising them that “despite </p>
<p>its inevitable deficiencies, the draft Constitution represents a major achievement”.</p>

<p>547</p>
<p><b>351. </b> The paper attached to Mr Straw’s letter explained that the Constitution deferred </p>
<p>critical decisions to a future elected Council of Representatives, which risked future </p>
<p>conflicts between a weakened central government and increasingly assertive regions. </p>
<p>The following areas were likely to be controversial:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Federalism: the latitude that the Constitution gave regional authorities to </p>
<p>maintain a significant armed force would increase the anxiety of Sunni Arabs </p>
<p>and others who claimed that federalism would lead to fragmentation.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Natural resources: the language of the Constitution was a “model of </p>
<p>imprecision”.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Role of Islam: the extent to which Islam would influence the legislative </p>
<p>programme remained to be determined.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Kirkuk: the Kurdish desire for a referendum was made explicit. Kirkuk would be </p>
<p>free to form a region or join another region, and the potential for a rise in ethnic </p>
<p>tension and violence was high.</p>
<p><b>352. </b> Mr Straw’s letter was not shown to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>353. </b> On 13 October, Mr Straw told Cabinet that “contrary to original expectations” the </p>
<p>timetable for transition to democratic government in Iraq set out in resolution 1546 had </p>
<p>“so far, kept to time”.</p>
<p>156</p>
<p> He commented that that was “impressive”. </p>
<p><b>354. </b> Mr Straw expected that turnout for the constitutional referendum would be high, </p>
<p>and there would be a two-thirds majority in most provinces. </p>
<p><b>355. </b> Mr Blair said that he was encouraged by the political progress being made, </p>
<p>although the security situation remained a cause for concern. He quoted a UN poll which </p>
<p>showed the population split roughly 50/50 on whether things were getting better or </p>
<p>worse. The main issue seemed to be lack of electricity. </p>
<p><b>356. </b> General Sir Mike Jackson, Chief of the General Staff, visited Iraq from 10 to </p>
<p>13 October and sent an account of his visit to Gen Walker.</p>
<p>157</p>
<p> He commented:</p>
<p>“This was a sobering visit in comparison to my last one in April, when the post </p>
<p>election-euphoria [sic] was still palpable and the campaign was being looked at </p>
<p>through somewhat rose-tinted spectacles. I detected little such optimism on this visit: </p>
<p>the atmosphere was rather more gritty …</p>
<p>“My analysis will appear gloomy; intentionally so. Though there is no sense of </p>

<p>have currently set ourselves.”</p>
<p><b>357. </b> Gen Jackson went on to comment on the problems with reconstruction, Security </p>
<p>Sector Reform and the military counter-insurgency strategy. He assessed that “the </p>
<p>prognosis for the SE is more optimistic than elsewhere” and that the Jameat incident </p>
<p>was “regarded now by the US as a little local difficulty, but indicative of the deep, </p>
<p>widespread corruption in the IPS across Iraq”.</p>
<p><b>358. </b> Gen Jackson wrote: “it is not to our credit that we have known about the </p>
<p>inadequacies of the IPS for so long and yet failed to address them”. </p>
<p><b>359. </b> He concluded with a reference to the pressure that the helicopter support fleet </p>
<p>and the air bridge were facing, commenting “we really need to take stock of our AT </p>
<p>[air transport] capability in the round, especially in light of our impending commitment </p>
<p>to Afghanistan”. Gen Jackson’s report was sent only to senior military officers, not to </p>
<p>Ministers nor to senior officials within the MOD.</p>
<p><b>360. </b> The referendum on Iraq’s draft Constitution took place on 15 October.</p>
<p>158</p>
<p> Mr Patey </p>
<p>reported that the day had “passed off largely peacefully across Iraq” with 89 attacks </p>
<p>reported, significantly below the levels of violence experienced during the January </p>
<p>elections. The early predictions were that the turnout had been over 60 percent. </p>
<p><b>361. </b> Mr Patey reported to the FCO:</p>
<p>“The referendum process has gone as well as we could have hoped. If a turnout of </p>
<p>over 60 percent is confirmed this will undermine the sceptics. It looks clear that there </p>
<p>will be a high turnout in Sunni areas, which enhances the legitimacy of the result and </p>
<p>bodes well for the elections in December.”</p>
<p><b>The Iraqi Constitution</b></p>
<p>The new Constitution comprised six sections, which covered:</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Fundamental principles.</b> This defined the Republic of Iraq as “a single, federal, </p>
<p>independent and full sovereign state” and Islam as its official religion such that “No </p>
<p>law may be enacted that contradicts the established provisions of Islam.” Arabic and </p>
<p>Kurdish were named as official languages, the “Saddamist Ba’ath” Party was banned </p>
<p>and provision made for to the ISF to be “composed of the components of the Iraqi </p>
<p>people, with due consideration given to their balance and representation without </p>
<p>discrimination or exclusion”. The formation of militia groups was prohibited. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Rights and liberties.</b> This section enshrined equality before the law for all Iraqis, </p>
<p>the right to “life, security and liberty”, rights to privacy, “so long as it does not </p>
<p>contradict the rights of others and public morals”, conditions for citizenship, and the </p>
<p>independence of the judiciary. This section contained protections for private property, </p>

<p>public assets and freedom of movement. It guaranteed healthcare, including for “the </p>
<p>handicapped and those with special needs”, education and environmental protection. </p>
<p>It defined rights regarding freedom of expression, including “freedom of thought, </p>
<p>conscience, and belief” and the free practice of religious rites “including the [Shia] </p>
<p>Husseini rituals”. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Federal powers.</b> This section defined the division of legislative and executive power </p>
<p>and described the roles of independent commissions. In relation to the Council </p>
<p>of Representatives (the federal legislature), it said that “the representation of all </p>
<p>components of the people shall be upheld in it”. It described the powers of the </p>
<p>President, Council of Ministers, Higher Judicial Council and Supreme Court. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Powers of the Federal Government.</b> This section defined the areas in which the </p>
<p>federal authorities had exclusive competence, including foreign policy, national </p>
<p>security policy, fiscal and customs policy and the budget. It said Iraq’s oil and </p>
<p>gas reserves would be managed by the federal government “with the producing </p>
<p>governorates and regional governments”.</p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Powers of the regions. </b>The federal system was defined in this section as </p>
<p>“made up of a decentralized capital, regions, and governorates, as well as local </p>
<p>administrations”. One or more governorates could form a region following a </p>
<p>referendum, and each region would adopt its own constitution, which should not </p>
<p>contradict the national Constitution on areas in which the federal government was </p>
<p>competent. An “equitable share” of revenues would be allocated to regions and </p>
<p>governorates. </p>
<p><b>• </b></p>
<p><b>Final and transitional provisions.</b> This section defined the process by which the </p>
<p>Constitution could be amended, including through the formation of a committee to </p>
<p>recommend amendments comprising members of the Council of Representatives </p>
<p>“representing the principal components of the Iraqi society”. It also stipulated that a </p>
<p>“Presidency Council” should be “elected by one list and with a two-thirds majority” in </p>
<p>the Council of Representatives, to undertake the role of the President in the first term </p>
<p>after the Constitution was adopted. </p>
<p><b>362. </b> The day after the referendum, President Talabani issued a decree, announcing </p>
<p>that Parliamentary elections would take place on 15 December in accordance with the </p>
<p>TAL.</p>
<p>159</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>363. </b> Political negotiations about the possibility of postponing the December election had </p>
<p>continued to the last moment. Mr Patey reported that the US and UK had lobbied hard </p>
<p>against postponement as “the extra time would almost certainly not have helped”. In his </p>
<p>view, “our pressure was crucial in keeping the various parties on track”.</p>
<p><b>364. </b> On 16 October, Mr Blair had lunch at Chequers with Secretary Rice.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>550</p>
<p><b>366. </b> Mr Blair and Secretary Rice agreed on the need to step up contacts with Sunni </p>
<p>groups and the importance of ensuring an effective, competent, centrist government </p>
<p>after the elections. Mr Blair raised the issue of the future of the coalition forces, </p>
<p>emphasising the importance of avoiding the impression both of cutting and running and </p>
<p>of wanting to stay for ever. He had originally believed that the coalition should agree with </p>
<p>the current Iraqi Government a clear plan for the build up of Iraqi forces and drawdown </p>
<p>of coalition forces, but had concluded that it would be better to wait until the new </p>
<p>government was formed. </p>
<p><b>367. </b> The Chiefs of Staff considered strategy on Iraq when they met on 18 October.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They concluded that the insurgency had continued to worsen and that: “Without a </p>
<p>change in the coalition strategy or its implementation, this trend could be expected </p>
<p>to continue.”</p>
<p><b>368. </b> Although most of the attacks had been in Baghdad and the three Sunni-dominated </p>
<p>northern provinces, “they might spread more widely if the insurgency continued to grow”. </p>
<p><b>369. </b> The Chiefs considered that the UK’s main effort in Iraq should remain Security </p>
<p>Sector Reform. The existing UK strategy was:</p>
<p>“… not fundamentally flawed, but its implementation was failing. Inadequate funding </p>
<p>was contributing significantly to this and reflected a lack of cross-Government buy-in </p>
<p>to the campaign and the incoherence of inter-Departmental activities. The military </p>
<p>effort was well-resourced compared to the commitments by other Government </p>
<p>departments to other Lines of Operation.” </p>
<p><b>370. </b> The Chiefs also concluded that “Ministers needed to be clear that the campaign </p>
<p>could potentially be heading for ‘strategic failure’, with grave national and international </p>
<p>consequences if the appropriate actions were not taken”. They believed that “the </p>
<p>establishment of well defined Ministerial ownership would be a key factor in addressing </p>
<p>it”. Although the UK/US relationship was strong at the military level, “political connections </p>
<p>needed to be strengthened”. </p>
<p><b>371. </b> Lieutenant General Robert Fry, Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Commitments), </p>
<p>was commissioned to produce two papers. The first was to set out the risk and nature </p>
<p>of strategic failure in Iraq and “the importance of ensuring that the PM was clear about </p>
<p>these issues and could therefore be expected to direct appropriate cross-Government </p>
<p>action”. The second paper would set out the links needed to improve UK engagement </p>
<p>with the US and “energise the cross-Whitehall approach to Iraq”. </p>

<p><b>The Iraqi Special Tribunal</b></p>
<p>On 19 October, the Iraqi Special Tribunal (IST) began the first trial of Saddam Hussein. </p>
<p>He and a number of his senior aides were charged with killing 148 Shia men from Dujail in </p>
<p>1982, following an attempt there on Saddam Hussein’s life.</p>
<p>162</p>
<p> All eight defendants pleaded </p>
<p>not guilty. The trial was adjourned until 28 November.</p>
<p>Although Human Rights Watch raised concerns about prospects for a fair trial, a </p>
<p>spokesman for the Iraqi Government said:</p>
<p>“Iraqis have not forgotten yet that the reason why the country is in such a mess, it’s </p>
<p>because one man stole the will of 27 million people for 35 years and pushed them </p>
<p>into wars and misery.”</p>
<p>Two defence counsel were killed, and a third wounded, in two separate incidents </p>
<p>on 20 October and 8 November.</p>
<p>163</p>
<p> As a result the trial was adjourned once again to </p>
<p>5 December to allow time for replacement counsel to be found.</p>
<p>164</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney General, told Cabinet on 27 October that there were huge </p>
<p>challenges in providing security for the court and protection for those participating.</p>
<p>165</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The trial was not, as some alleged, being orchestrated by the US and the UK – “we had </p>
<p>simply provided support for the Iraqis”. </p>
<p>A second set of proceedings against Saddam Hussein commenced on 21 August 2006. </p>
<p>These concerned the accusation of genocide against the Kurds in the Anfal campaign in </p>
<p>the late 1980s, for which Saddam Hussein and six other defendants stood accused.</p>
<p>While the proceedings in relation to the Anfal charges were continuing (and before what </p>
<p>was expected to be a series of other proceedings against Saddam Hussein had been </p>
<p>commenced), the IST reached its verdict on the first (Dujail) trial. On 5 November 2006, </p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was sentenced to death for the Dujail killings. He was executed on </p>
<p>30 December 2006.</p>
<p><b>372. </b> On 19 October, Secretary Rice told the US Senate Foreign Relations </p>
<p>Committee that she believed the US could “assure victory” in Iraq, by majoring on the </p>
<p>“clear-hold-build” concept.</p>
<p>166</p>
<p> She explained:</p>
<p>“We are moving from a stage of transition toward the strategy to prepare a </p>
<p>permanent Iraqi government for a decisive victory … With our Iraqi allies, we are </p>
<p>working to: </p>
<p>• </p>

<p><b>373. </b> Secretary Rice observed that compromise and politics were replacing violence and </p>
<p>repression within Iraq, but argued the Iraqi Government needed to build more effective </p>

<p>used in Afghanistan. </p>
<p><b>374. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported that, despite pressure from Senators, </p>
<p>Secretary Rice refused to give a timetable for troop withdrawal, and that the questions </p>
<p>underlined increasing scepticism that the policy was working:</p>

<p><b>379. </b> Iraqi leaders should be encouraged to say that Sunni views expressed in </p>
<p>the referendum would be taken into account to “soften the edges” of a positive, </p>
<p>but close, result. </p>
<p><b>380. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video link on 25 October.</p>
<p>170</p>
<p> Mr Straw, </p>
<p>Mr Powell, Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Lt Gen Fry also joined the discussion as did Vice </p>
<p>President Dick Cheney, Secretary Rumsfeld and Secretary Rice, Mr Hadley and </p>
<p>Ambassador Khalilzad. Mr Patey, Gen Casey and others joined from Baghdad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>381. </b> Two key priorities for the political track were identified: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>splitting off the rejectionists from the Saddamists and the jihadists; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>getting maximum turnout in the elections so that they led to a broad-based, </p>
<p>centrist government.</p>
<p><b>382. </b> Mr Patey cautioned that there were “formidable challenges” to come and that the </p>
<p>UK and US should not take increased Sunni participation in the December elections for </p>
<p>granted. Mr Straw and Secretary Rice advocated pressing Kurdish and Shia leaders to </p>
<p>signal future amendments to the Constitution, to show that the process for amending it </p>
<p>was a real one. </p>
<p><b>383. </b> In response to a question from President Bush about the situation in the South, </p>
<p>Mr Patey said that the political process had exposed deep divisions within the Shia </p>
<p>community which had impacted on local government. Local “turf wars” were not being </p>
<p>restrained by central government. Lieutenant General Nicholas Houghton, the SBMR-I, </p>
<p>said that the security situation remained calmer in the South, which might be able to lead </p>
<p>the process of security transition. </p>
<p><b>384. </b> Mr Blair agreed with the need to challenge increasing Iranian interference in </p>
<p>Central and South Iraq, which would sharpen if the elections went well. He concluded by </p>
<p>reiterating the point that Sunni outreach would be crucial in the coming weeks and that </p>
<p>this would mean “digging some way into the insurgency”. </p>
<p><b>385. </b> The referendum results were formally released on 25 October, confirming that the </p>
<p>Constitution had been passed.</p>
<p>171</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>386. </b> Nationally, the “Yes” vote was 78.59 percent, with a total turnout of more than </p>
<p>63 percent. There was a majority “Yes” vote in 15 of the 18 governorates (in 12 of these, </p>
<p>the ‘Yes’ vote was more than 90 percent). Although it was rejected by a majority in </p>
<p>the three remaining provinces (Anbar, Salah ad Din and Ninawa), in only two of these </p>
<p>(Anbar and Salah ad Din) was the two-thirds rejection threshold passed. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>554</p>
<p><b>387. </b> Reflecting on the results, Mr Patey commented:</p>
<p>“On the plus side, this result demonstrates overwhelming Iraqi popular support for </p>
<p>the draft Constitution and opens the way to the election of a permanent, four-year </p>
<p>government … The process was well-run and robust enough to strongly resist </p>
<p>any allegations that fraud or other kinds of irregularities materially affected the </p>
<p>overall result.</p>
<p>“On the negative side, the vote was highly polarised, with almost all Shia and Kurds </p>
<p>voting in favour and almost all Sunni Arabs voting against. We should not forget </p>
<p>that small numbers of all three major communities voted against the mainstream, </p>
<p>including in those areas where they would have been under fierce social pressure to </p>
<p>vote the other way (e.g. Anbar). The Shia turnout overall was significantly down on </p>
<p>the January elections and we must assume that, in addition to apathy, at least some </p>
<p>of those who stayed away did so because they did not support the Constitution.  </p>
<p>We continue to warn Shia and Kurds against the dangers of triumphalism,  </p>
<p>and are urging them to temper their response, [and] acknowledge publicly  </p>
<p>Sunni dissatisfaction …</p>
<p>“We will continue to work closely with the US to encourage maximum Sunni </p>
<p>participation in the elections, including through intensive political engagement with </p>
<p>the Sunnis themselves …”</p>
<p>172</p>
<p><b>388. </b> Mr Straw reported to Cabinet on the outcome of the referendum on 27 October.</p>
<p>173</p>
<p> </p>
<p>He commented that the decisions of key Sunni parties to support the constitutional </p>
<p>process was a step forward, but most Sunnis had voted against the Constitution. </p>
<p><b>389. </b> Security incidents on election day had been “only a third of the level on </p>
<p>30 January”. The next milestone was the election on 15 December, meanwhile the UK </p>
<p>was “working hard” with the US and others to “provide support to Iraqi politicians in </p>
<p>developing the democratic process, building alliances and considering coalitions for </p>
<p>government”.</p>
<p><b>Assessment of the Constitution</b></p>
<p>Mr Asquith told the Inquiry that the Constitution did not command the support of the Sunni </p>
<p>Arab community, principally because they had boycotted the January 2005 elections, and </p>
<p>to a large extent had therefore written themselves out of the political programme thereafter </p>
<p>until the next set of elections.</p>

<p>Mr Ali A Allawi judged that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi Constitution of 2005 was not the national compact that many had thought </p>
<p>necessary and desirable, but a document arising from a series of political deals. </p>
<p>It was seen as a necessary step in the political process and was not vested with the </p>
<p>quasi-sacred status that such documents had in other countries. Nevertheless, it </p>
<p>enshrined basic rights and opened up the possibility of a different type of Iraqi state </p>
<p>than the one that had gone so disastrously awry.”</p>
<p>Dr Rice judged in her memoir that the size of the Iraqi ‘yes’ vote sent “a firm signal about </p>
<p>those citizens’ yearning for democratic governance.”</p>
<p>175</p>
<p> </p>
<p>President Bush went further, describing it as “the most progressive constitution in the Arab </p>
<p>world – a document that guaranteed equal rights for all and protected the freedoms of </p>
<p>religion, assembly and expression.”</p>
<p>176</p>
<p><b>390. </b> After the discussion by video conference on 25 October, Mr Blair asked the FCO </p>
<p>to produce a paper on “how we can intensify our efforts on Sunni Arab outreach in the </p>
<p>run-up to and beyond the December elections and formation of the next Government”.</p>
<p>177</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>391. </b> Mr Straw’s Private Secretary sent a paper, cleared by Mr Straw, to Mr Blair’s Private </p>
<p>Secretary on 27 October. The paper set out actions for the UK and US in order to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>identify more of those who control or influence the insurgency;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>determine what they wanted and what could reasonably be offered;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prepare them for direct dialogue with the Shia and Kurds;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>bring the Shia and Kurds to the dialogue;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>hold all sides to the deals they struck; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>take supporting action. </p>
<p><b>392. </b> The paper acknowledged that “exploring the less savoury reaches of the opposition </p>
<p>risks alienating Shia and Kurdish politicians”, and that there would be difficulties “selling </p>
<p>this to the Americans who remain cautious of dealing with those who, when offered a </p>
<p>choice between violence and politics, will choose both”. </p>
<p><b>393. </b> If Mr Blair agreed with the paper’s approach, then the FCO aimed to instigate </p>
<p>direct and indirect contact between Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs and Kurds, both inside and </p>
<p>outside Iraq plus “supporting action in the media … focusing Sunni Arabs on the process </p>
<p>ahead and the incentives for participating in the next elections”. </p>
<p><b>394. </b> Mr Blair responded that the paper was “good. We need now to action it </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>556</p>
<p><b>395. </b> Following a meeting between Mr Blair and President Massoud Barzani on </p>
<p>31 October, Mr Quarrey reported to Mr Straw’s Private Secretary that:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister wants us to keep Sunni outreach as our number one priority on </p>
<p>the political track in the coming weeks … He wants us to get on and implement the </p>
<p>strategy … as quickly as possible.”</p>
<p>179</p>
<p><b>396. </b> In October 2005 a senior government official specialising in the Middle East (1) </p>
<p>proposed that an independent link to Muqtada al-Sadr and to one or two other leading </p>
<p>Sadrists should be established.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p><b>397. </b> Mr Asquith,</p>

<p>Intelligence),</p>
<p>182</p>
<p> and Mr Straw</p>
<p>183</p>
<p> all agreed the advice. </p>
<p><b>398. </b> In advance of a video conference with President Bush on 1 November, </p>
<p>Mr Phillipson advised Mr Blair that he should focus the discussion on confirming the </p>
<p>President’s support for “a vigorous programme of Sunni outreach” including agreement </p>
<p>to some specific activities, such as a regional contact group.</p>
<p>184</p>
<p><b>399. </b> Mr Phillipson advised that Mr Blair should reassure President Bush that the UK </p>
<p>was looking at what needed to be done in MND(SE) in response, including trying to </p>
<p>identify moderate political leaders and “the combination of a tough approach to militia </p>
<p>penetration of the Police with a more effective Police training programme”. </p>
<p><b>November 2005</b></p>
<p><b>400. </b> In conversation with President Bush, on 1 November Mr Blair made the case </p>
<p>that the US and UK should “push ahead in a big way” with Sunni outreach before </p>
<p>the elections.</p>
<p>185</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>401. </b> In response to a request from No.10, advice was provided in early November on </p>
<p>how the UK might best target its efforts to engage those close to the Sunni insurgency </p>
<p>to avoid duplicating other initiatives in Iraq to engage with the Sunni community and </p>
<p>its militias.</p>

<p><b>402. </b> It was envisaged that the Sunni insurgent leaders were likely to wish to discuss, </p>
<p>among other things, a timetable for MNF withdrawal from Iraq and the conditions under </p>
<p>which it might be possible. They might also wish to discuss prisoner releases, an end </p>
<p>to house raids, possible future amnesties, the conduct and integrity of the elections, </p>
<p>federalism, and employment in the Iraqi armed forces and security forces. </p>
<p><b>403. </b> On 4 November, the ISOG commissioned a number of papers for the meeting </p>
<p>of DOP(I) on 15 November.</p>
<p>187</p>
<p> These included papers on Sunni outreach, election </p>
<p>prospects, “the centrists” and the security strategy in the South (including Iraqiisation). </p>
<p><b>404. </b> The ISOG also discussed the variety of plans and matrices being maintained by </p>
<p>departments to track activity in Iraq. They acknowledged that it was not practical to join </p>
<p>them all together, but the point was made that “any work reflected in the matrices should </p>
<p>be ‘real’ and funded” and should reflect UK work only. </p>
<p><b>405. </b> The ISOG also commissioned a review of the 2005 Iraq Strategy, to be led by the </p>
<p>Cabinet Office. </p>
<p><b>406. </b> On 8 November, the UN Security Council adopted resolution 1637 (2005).</p>
<p>188</p>
<p><b>407. </b> Annexed to the resolution was a letter from Prime Minister Ja’afari to the President </p>
<p>of the Security Council requesting an extension of the mandate for international forces in </p>
<p>Iraq, and by a letter from Secretary Rice confirming that they would stay as requested. </p>
<p><b>408. </b> Prime Minister Ja’afari wrote that:</p>
<p>“The Iraqi security forces, which are growing in size, capacity and experience day </p>
<p>by day, need more time to fill out their ranks, fully equip themselves and complete </p>
<p>their training with a view to assuming responsibility for all security matters and </p>
<p>providing adequate security for the Iraqi people. Until such time as Iraqi security </p>
<p>forces assume full responsibility for Iraq’s security, we need the continued support of </p>
<p>the international community, including the participation of the Multi-National Force, in </p>
<p>order to establish lasting peace and security in Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>409. </b> The resolution extended the mandate for the MNF established by resolution 1546 </p>
<p>until 31 December 2006. The mandate would be reviewed either at the request of </p>
<p>the Government of Iraq or no later than 15 June 2006. As in resolution1546, the new </p>
<p>resolution also declared that the Security Council would terminate the mandate “earlier </p>
<p>if requested by the Government of Iraq”. </p>

<p><b>410. </b> On 8 November, the JIC issued an Assessment of Al Qaida’s strategy.</p>
<p>189</p>
<p> The JIC </p>
<p>judged that:</p>
<p>“Iraq is currently central to the core Al Qaida leadership’s focus of effort. The </p>
<p>situation there has significantly increased … [their] opportunities to confront </p>
<p>Western, particularly US, interests. It has also provided access to extremist </p>
<p>networks across Europe that may extend the core Al Qaida leadership’s ability to </p>
<p>conduct terrorist attacks, including in the UK. The core Al Qaida leadership sees an </p>
<p>opportunity to establish a base in an ungoverned and exploitable space in the Sunni </p>
<p>areas of Iraq.” </p>
<p><b>411. </b> On 10 November, Dr Reid wrote to Mr Blair about the transition to Iraqi </p>
<p>responsibility for security in Muthanna and Maysan.</p>
<p>190</p>
<p> His letter said:</p>
<p>“Military judgement remains that it would, in principle, be possible to hand over </p>
<p>responsibility for security for the Iraqis in Muthanna and Maysan provinces by </p>
<p>around February 2006.”</p>
<p><b>412. </b> The letter explained that two factors implied a need to extend that timetable: the </p>
<p>failure of the Iraqi Government to set out the context for transition and the US desire to </p>
<p>maintain a Japanese presence in Iraq combined with unwillingness by the Japanese to </p>
<p>move away from Muthanna.</p>
<p><b>413. </b> Dr Reid reported that Prime Minister Ja’afari had agreed the conditions for transfer </p>
<p>set out by the JCTSR and that a public handling strategy for their release was being </p>
<p>developed. The assessment of provinces and cities that were likely to move to Iraqi </p>
<p>security control was unlikely to take place until after the December election. </p>
<p><b>414. </b> On force levels, Dr Reid wrote:</p>
<p>“The extension to the timeline for the handover of security to the Iraqis in MND(SE) </p>
<p>has force level implications. Assuming security conditions allow, reductions in UK </p>
<p>force numbers which might have been possible from around February might now </p>
<p>be deferred to early summer (May), when we should be able to reduce our troop </p>
<p>numbers in MND(SE).”</p>
<p><b>415. </b> Mr Straw visited Baghdad from 10 to 11 November.</p>

<p>management. The default setting of the Sunnis is angry resentment at their </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Instruments of torture, including belts, rubber </p>
<p>hoses, electrical cable and truncheons were recovered and there was evidence of links </p>
<p>to the Badr Corps militia. </p>
<p><b>418. </b> The discovery, and the response of the Minister of the Interior, are described in </p>
<p>more detail in Section 12.1. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>He said:</p>
<p>“What is obvious now to all is that this [terrorism] is a global movement and requires </p>

<p>harder-line Sunni nationalist leaders and local insurgent leaders later in the month. </p>
<p><b>425. </b> Sunni Arab demands remained the same: less robust US military practices, </p>
<p>detainee releases and an amnesty; the appointment of Sunni Arabs to the Iraqi Security </p>
<p>Forces; a more level electoral playing field; and a timetable for transition. </p>
<p><b>426. </b> The IPU reported some progress, both on detainee releases and with the </p>
<p>announcement by Iraqi Defence Minister Mr Saadoun al-Dulaimi that all former army </p>
<p>personnel, up to and including the rank of Major, were invited to re-apply to join the ISF. </p>
<p>The IPU commented that the latter was “a start, but not what former Generals in the </p>
<p>insurgency will settle for”. The IPU judged that more work was needed to encourage </p>
<p>Iraqi politicians to repeal the de-Ba’athification law and abolish the de-Ba’athification </p>
<p>Commission. </p>
<p><b>427. </b> The IPU commented that it was clear that the US Administration was prepared to </p>
<p>countenance a broad swathe of US and UK outreach activity, but on the condition that </p>
<p>the US should be “careful not to ‘pick winners’”.</p>
<p><b>428. </b> A Cabinet Office official provided Mr Blair with a Chairman’s brief for the meeting </p>

<p> It said:</p>
<p>“We <b>have made progress since your last meeting</b> … We now have the basic tools </p>
<p>… to run an outreach strategy … But, your <b>conversation with Khalilzad showed </b></p>
<p><b>we don’t yet have an agreed US/UK operational plan</b> – we need to fix this.” </p>
<p><b>429. </b> At the meeting Mr Straw summarised his impressions from his recent discussions </p>
<p>with Sunni leaders in Iraq.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p> He felt that the Sunnis now understood that boycotting the </p>
<p>elections had been a mistake, and wanted to enter the political process. In discussion </p>
<p>it was observed that Sunnis were starting to realise that the coalition were “the best </p>
<p>available guarantors of their interests”. </p>

<p><b>430. </b> Members of DOP(I) also discussed an MOD paper on the UK’s contribution to </p>
<p>the “overall Iraq security strategy”.</p>
<p>199</p>
<p> The paper identified the different strategic end </p>
<p>states adopted by the UK Government and the MNF-I (see Section 9.3), and defined the </p>
<p>following as key outcomes:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>delivering security in the run up to the December 2005 elections (the immediate </p>
<p>focus);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>delivering a secure environment in MND(SE) which permitted training of the </p>
<p>ISF to the point that they can take on responsibility for security (the short-term </p>
<p>focus); and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>delivering Iraqi Security Force “self-reliance” (the medium-term focus).</p>
<p><b>431. </b> The MOD said that those outcomes would be achieved through a </p>
<p>cross-departmental effort, focused on: establishing a secure environment; transitioning </p>
<p>tactical, operational and strategic overwatch; developing an effective and self-sufficient </p>
<p>IPS; and building the capacity of key Ministries within the security sector. </p>
<p><b>432. </b> At the DOP(I) meeting, Sir Nigel Sheinwald handed Dr Reid’s letter of </p>
<p>10 November on transition in Muthanna and Maysan to Mr Blair.</p>
<p>200</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>433. </b> Dr Reid told members of DOP(I) that the UK’s exit from Muthanna and Maysan </p>
<p>had been delayed until May 2006, reflecting the UK’s commitment to the Japanese.</p>
<p>201</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dr Reid hoped it would be possible to complete the handover within this timescale in </p>
<p>order to start reducing the UK’s troop commitment in Iraq during 2006.</p>
<p><b>434. </b> Members of DOP(I) were also given a paper on the ‘Iraq Communications Strategy </p>
<p>for the UK Audience’, which was not discussed at the meeting.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>435. </b> The paper recorded the creation of the Iraq Communications Group (Ministerial),</p>
<p>203</p>
<p> </p>
<p>which brought together No.10, DFID, the FCO and the MOD to co-ordinate the Iraq </p>
<p>message for the domestic audience. </p>
<p><b>436. </b> The paper said:</p>
<p>“… there are relatively few resources dedicated specifically to Iraq communications. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>562</p>
<p><b>437. </b> Attached to the paper was a core script on Iraq, and one on the December </p>
<p>elections, which said:</p>
<p>“We have a strategy and it has remained constant. It is to participate alongside the </p>
<p>international community in supporting the development of democracy, peace and </p>
<p>security in Iraq …</p>
<p>“Any immediate withdrawal, or one determined by arbitrary timeliness or under the </p>
<p>threat of terror, would hand over Iraq to the terrorists and be a victory for terrorism – </p>
<p>not only in Iraq but in wider international terms.”</p>
<p><b>438. </b> On 16 November, at the request of the ISOG, the JIC considered the prospects for </p>
<p>the election.</p>
<p>204</p>
<p> It assessed that:</p>
<p>“Even with international pressure, the process of forming a new Iraqi cabinet </p>
<p>after December’s election is unlikely to be swift: we expect a period of protracted </p>
<p>wrangling, well into early 2006, during which time there will be no effective </p>
<p>government. Negotiations will centre on the number of Ministerial slots for each </p>
<p>political group; the relative importance of each slot; and the personalities of </p>
<p>individual candidates. We expect vigorous arguments from Sunni Arabs to keep out </p>
<p>‘Iranian-backed’ politicians, and from Shia to deny ‘Ba’athists’ senior office.”</p>
<p><b>439. </b> The JIC judged that the new Assembly was likely to be more politically complex </p>
<p>than the TNA, with greater influence wielded by both Sunni Arabs and Sadrists. </p>
<p><b>440. </b> The new Ministerial team would need to reflect that complexity. On the one hand, </p>
<p>this would demonstrate a more inclusive approach, which would undermine the causes </p>
<p>of the Sunni insurgency; on the other, the inclusion of credible Sunni figures would add </p>
<p>to the government’s fragility.</p>
<p><b>441. </b> In a telegram to London reflecting on the likely departure of Prime Minister Ja’afari </p>
<p>and who might succeed him, Mr Patey wrote:</p>
<p>“Like the TAL, the Constitution provides for a weak Prime Minister, dependent on </p>
<p>consensus. Any successor to Ja’afari will have a hard time managing what will still </p>
<p>be a large, unwieldy and ill-disciplined coalition and increasingly independent and </p>
<p>self-confident institutions.”</p>
<p>205</p>
<p><b>442. </b> In a video conference on 22 November, Mr Blair reported to President Bush that </p>
<p>Sunni outreach activity seemed to be bearing fruit.</p>

<p>563</p>
<p><b>443. </b> The minute given to Mr Blair by his Private Secretary in preparation for the </p>
<p>discussion said:</p>
<p>“Some of our Sunnis [sic] contacts have raised the possibility of co-ordinated </p>
<p>cease-fires in the run-up to the elections. We need to be careful not to signal any </p>
<p>equivalence between MNF/ISF activity on the one hand and the insurgency on the </p>
<p>other. But we should explore the scope for local deals which would help draw in </p>
<p>those who are close to the insurgency but politically biddable”.</p>
<p>207</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>444. </b> The Private Secretary also suggested that the possibility of detainee releases </p>
<p>should be considered as part of the approach to Sunni outreach. </p>
<p><b>445. </b> A senior government official specialising in the Middle East (1) wrote on </p>
<p>25 November with an update, and reported that:</p>
<p>“A senior Sadrist close to Muqtada al-Sadr, who is a member of the Iraqi nationalist </p>
<p>trend opposed to Iranian influence in Iraq, has confirmed through a UK-based </p>
<p>intermediary that he is prepared to meet [one of the senior official’s colleagues] in </p>
<p>either [another location] or London … He may be able to act as a channel from HMG </p>
<p>to al-Sadr but could also shed light on the fractures within the Sadrist movement. </p>
<p>I have previously suggested the need for us to test out this channel if we are to seek </p>
<p>to rely on it in case of security need in MND(SE).”</p>
<p>208</p>
<p><b>446. </b> On 25 November, Gen Walker wrote to Dr Reid with an outline of the main issues </p>
<p>he had identified during a visit to Iraq from 22 to 23 November.</p>
<p>209</p>
<p><b>447. </b> Gen Walker reported:</p>
<p>“Levels of consent from MNF presence were slowly declining throughout the </p>
<p>AOR [Area of Operations]. When considering military activity in the AOR, broadly </p>
<p>60 percent of our effort was devoted to force protection and sustainment of the </p>
<p>UK laydown, 30 percent to SSR [Security Sector Reform] and just five percent  </p>
<p>or so to UK COIN [counter-insurgency].” </p>
<p><b>448. </b> Under the heading “Where Are We?” Gen Walker reported that an Iraqi insurgency </p>
<p>remained active and was targeting the political process. The new Constitution was </p>
<p>not viewed as a national compact, although the majority of the Sunni population was </p>
<p>committed to the political process. The upcoming election and perceptions of sectarian </p>
<p>conduct by some Ministries were inhibiting progress. </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>564</p>
<p><b>449. </b> Looking ahead, Gen Walker told Dr Reid that a new campaign plan had been </p>
<p>drafted by Gen Casey and Ambassador Khalilzad, which sought to:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>develop processes and machinery to remove corrupt officials;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>seize the resources of terrorists and foreign fighters;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>address sectarian, corrupt or subversive activities by the ISF;</p>
<p>• </p>

<p>• </p>
<p>ensure that food reached the most needy and test the elimination of subsidies </p>
<p>for food and fuel; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>disrupt the flow of illegal resources into Iraq, particularly from Iran and Syria. </p>
<p><b>450. </b> Gen Walker advised Dr Reid that:</p>
<p>“The jury is out on the pilot PRTs – both amongst the military and the diplomats. </p>
<p>Whatever the outcome, I recommend an early bid to run them in the four MND(SE) </p>
<p>provinces to save us heartache later. If we don’t, they have the potential to fix us </p>
<p>through force protection requirements at places and for periods not of our choosing.”</p>
<p><b>451. </b> On transition, Gen Walker wrote:</p>
<p>“Nothing I heard indicated that our transition aspirations are flights of fancy. </p>
<p>Gen Babakir may have been optimistic in his assessment of the speed with which </p>
<p>the IA would be in a position to assume the security role (by late 06) but I suspect </p>
<p>much will hinge on the view of the new government.”</p>
<p><b>The kidnapping of Mr Norman Kember</b></p>
<p>On 26 November, at 1430 local time, Mr Norman Kember and three others – Mr Harmeet </p>

<p>were kidnapped in Baghdad.</p>

<p> The van in which they were travelling was hijacked  </p>

<p><b>452. </b> President Bush set out his strategy for Iraq in a speech to the US Naval Academy </p>
<p>in Annapolis on 30 November.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>453. </b> The British Embassy Washington commented that he had invoked the spirit of </p>
<p>Churchill and Roosevelt: the US objective in Iraq was “nothing less than complete </p>
<p>victory”. He had acknowledged the validity of debate but said that an “artificial timetable” </p>
<p>would be wrong. President Bush had anticipated US troop reductions as Iraqi forces </p>
<p>stood up, but had avoided timelines. </p>
<p><b>454. </b> In parallel with the President’s speech, the National Security Council published its </p>
<p>“National Strategy for Victory in Iraq”.</p>
<p>213</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>455. </b> The strategy set out three stages of victory in Iraq:</p>
<p>“– Short term, Iraq is making steady progress in fighting terrorists, meeting political </p>
<p>milestones, building democratic institutions, and standing up security forces.</p>
<p>– Medium term, Iraq is in the lead defeating terrorists and providing its own security, </p>
<p>with a fully constitutional government in place, and on its way to achieving its </p>
<p>economic potential.</p>
<p>– Longer term, Iraq is peaceful, united, stable, and secure, well integrated into the </p>
<p>international community, and a full partner in the global war on terrorism.”</p>
<p><b>456. </b> The strategy was “conditions based” and did not set a date by which it would be </p>
<p>achieved because: </p>
<p>“No war has ever been won on a timetable and neither will this one.”</p>
<p><b>457. </b> The strategy said that US force posture would change with conditions in Iraq. </p>
<p>It was expected that some changes in posture would take place over the following year </p>
<p>“as the political process advances and Iraqi security forces grow and gain experience”. </p>
<p><b>458. </b> At the FCO’s request, the JIC considered the relationship between Iran and Iraq </p>
<p>on 30 November.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>459. </b> The Assessment reiterated earlier JIC judgements that the Iranian leadership </p>
<p>aspired to:</p>
<p>“… help create a stable and unified Iraq which is Shia-led with a strong Islamic </p>
<p>identity; open to Iranian political and commercial influence; unable to pose a </p>
<p>military threat and inclined to defer to Iran over issues of mutual interest; and free of </p>

<p>566</p>
<p><b>460. </b> The JIC judged that Iran would continue to encourage some Shia extremists to </p>
<p>attack coalition forces with the aim of deterring further Western military involvement in </p>
<p>the region. But in pursuit of long-term stability, a Shia-led government was likely to have </p>
<p>Iranian support in tackling Sunni insurgency, including the jihadist campaign. Although </p>
<p>the next Iraqi government might be less sensitive to Iranian interests than the ITG, the </p>
<p>JIC judged that the Iranians would: </p>
<p>“… work hard to maintain and if possible improve their position, keeping up links … </p>
<p>with its existing Shia allies … [and] Kurdish parties, and seeking new ones, perhaps </p>
<p>even with some Sunni Arab groups. Of all Iraq’s neighbours, Iran will maintain the </p>
<p>greatest influence.”</p>
<p><b>December 2005</b></p>
<p><b>461. </b> On 1 December, members of DOP(I) considered a paper on introducing PRTs.</p>
<p>215</p>
<p><b>462. </b> A paper written by the IPU recommended that the UK should establish a PRT </p>
<p>structure in southern Iraq, adapting the US model to suit the circumstances in each </p>
<p>province.</p>
<p>216</p>
<p> The IPU recommended creating one (“mini”) PRT in each province, </p>
<p>then moving to a “single super-PRT” in Basra. The first could be up and running </p>
<p>by February 2006. </p>
<p><b>463. </b> The IPU anticipated only “benefits at the margins” from the new structure. </p>
<p><b>464. </b> Mr Straw explained that the paper “proposed that we went along with the United </p>
<p>States’ proposal for the creation of PRTs across Iraq but without disrupting our own </p>
<p>plans for military transition”.</p>
<p>217</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>465. </b> Dr Reid agreed that the UK response should be positive, but stressed the need </p>
<p>to keep control of and tailor developing PRT plans in the provinces where the UK was </p>
<p>directly involved. </p>
<p><b>466. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald held a series of meetings with senior Sunni representatives </p>
<p>outside Iraq from 7 to 8 December.</p>
<p>218</p>
<p> In each discussion, he set out that:</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister wanted a stable, united, democratic and prosperous Iraq. A </p>
<p>true democracy respected the views of the majority but also protected the rights </p>
<p>of minorities. If the Sunni community wanted a fair share of power we would work </p>
<p>to support that objective. But we would not support a return to domination. We </p>
<p>were under attack primarily from the Sunni community, even though we were </p>
<p>their best guarantors of a fair outcome, as the constitutional negotiations showed. </p>

<p>international community’s approach. But it did drive the Shia further toward Iranian </p>
<p>influence and prolong the presence of the MNF. </p>
<p>“The Sunnis had made a mistake in not taking part in January’s elections. We </p>
<p>welcomed the recent change of mood. We wanted full participation in December’s </p>
<p>elections, leading to an effective and representative government.</p>
<p>“We wanted the Sunni leadership to commit to: encouraging participation in the </p>
<p>political process; reducing violence before the elections and sustaining the calm </p>
<p>after the elections; removing foreign fighters; and using their influence to release </p>
<p>hostages and end the practice of kidnapping, which did grave damage to Iraq’s </p>
<p>reputation. In return we were prepared to discuss transition (though this would </p>
<p>remain conditions based – we would not leave a security vacuum), MNF tactics, </p>
<p>de-Ba’athification and detainee releases.</p>
<p>“The Prime Minister was committed to taking forward this dialogue, which he had </p>
<p>discussed with President Bush. Bush was aware of these meetings. In summary, </p>
<p>we wanted to develop a shared, balanced agenda with Sunni leaders.”</p>
<p><b>467. </b> Following Sir Nigel Sheinwald’s meetings, Mr Blair asked officials to keep in touch </p>
<p>with those he had spoken to and to consider whether Sir Nigel should have a further </p>
<p>series of meetings in early 2006.</p>
<p>219</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>468. </b> Mr Blair also asked Mr Patey and Lt Gen Houghton to relay specific messages </p>
<p>to their US interlocutors on the need for the MNF to give the Sunnis space before the </p>
<p>elections; to work for local cease-fires and avoid major offensive operations afterwards; </p>
<p>and to look at some detainee cases with a view to early release if the names given to </p>
<p>Sir Nigel presented no significant security threat. </p>
<p><b>469. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad, in concert with the US, called on Sunni Arab </p>
<p>interlocutors to halt attacks on the MNF and on Iraqi Security Forces over the period of </p>
<p>the December 2005 Iraqi elections.</p>

<p><b>474. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush spoke by video conference on 13 December, two days </p>
<p>before the Iraqi election.</p>
<p>222</p>
<p> Mr Blair said things were “looking good” for the election and </p>
<p>proposed pushing for a new government to be in place by the end of January. He felt </p>
<p>that “there was a sense of ordinary politics for the first time”. </p>
<p><b>475. </b> Mr Blair also felt that a “turning point” may have been reached on Sunni </p>
<p>engagement, with some Sunni leaders distancing themselves from the insurgency and </p>
<p>wanting to participate in the political process. </p>
<p><b>476. </b> On 14 December, the eve of the Iraqi election, the JIC updated its July 2005 </p>
<p>assessment of the Sunni insurgency in Iraq.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p> Its Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. In Sunni areas of central and northern Iraq the insurgency is firmly entrenched </p>
<p>and shows no sign of diminishing. The underlying long-term trend of attacks has </p>
<p>been upwards. Sectarian violence has also continued to escalate.</p>
<p>“II. The driving force of the insurgency are <b>Iraqi Arab Sunni nationalists</b>. They are </p>
<p>responsible for most attacks … dialogue between Sunni insurgents and politicians </p>
<p>is increasing and they share some political goals. Improved Sunni political cohesion </p>
<p>could strengthen the ability of Sunni politicians to influence the insurgents …</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“IV. Not all Sunni expectations will be met but if the next Iraqi government could </p>
<p>deliver on at least some, alienation of the Sunni community could be reduced … </p>
<p>The possibility of isolating the jihadists and other hard-core rejectionists could be </p>
<p>enhanced, although the risk of sectarian violence will remain.</p>
<p>“V. In such circumstances the Iraqi Sunni Arab nationalist insurgency might slowly </p>
<p>begin to reduce. But a hard-core is likely to remain irreconcilable and reject the </p>
<p>political process. We continue to judge that a significant insurgency in Sunni areas </p>
<p>will persist beyond 2006.</p>
<p>“VI. The <b>jihadists</b> also reject the political process and are determined to fight on. </p>
<p>They are a minority within the overall insurgency but have disproportionate impact: </p>

<p><b>477. </b> Iraq’s parliamentary election took place on 15 December. Mr Patey reported to the </p>
<p>FCO that the day had passed off peacefully with no major security events.</p>
<p>224</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>478. </b> Initial predictions of turnout were that it had been significantly higher than for the </p>
<p>January 2005 elections, particularly in Sunni Arab areas, including Anbar.</p>
<p><b>479. </b> The election was monitored by more than 300,000 observers and the initial </p>
<p>assessment of the International Mission for Iraqi Elections was that it had generally met </p>
<p>international standards. </p>
<p><b>480. </b> Mr Asquith told the Inquiry: </p>
<p>“I think we did enough to get them [Sunni Arabs] to vote in December 2005. Did we </p>
<p>do enough thereafter in continuing that relationship? Possibly not. In retrospect, </p>
<p>I think we thought we had done the job.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>481. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Rice discussed the election on 17 December.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>482. </b> Mr Straw said that DOP(I) was concerned that the Iraqi parties should have access </p>
<p>to expertise on forming a coalition, including developing a coalition agreement and </p>
<p>methods of dispute resolution. The UK was talking to the Italians and the Germans about </p>

<p>228</p>
<p><b>485. </b> The IPU hoped that it might be possible for an Iraqi government to be formed by </p>
<p>the end of January, six weeks after the election.</p>
<p><b>486. </b> At DOP(I) on 20 December, Mr Patey cautioned that there could be a tension </p>
<p>between the desire for a representative and effective government and the hope that it </p>
<p>could be achieved rapidly.</p>
<p>229</p>
<p> If that were the case, he judged that a representative and </p>
<p>effective government would be more important than speed.</p>
<p><b>487. </b> Mr Blair told DOP(I) that he had discussed US/UK engagement in forming the new </p>
<p>government with President Bush. They were agreed that full engagement was necessary </p>
<p>and legitimate. Ambassador Khalilzad and Mr Patey:</p>
<p>“… should be clear that they had a mandate to send a tough message to the Iraqis, </p>
<p>particularly to the Kurds, about our expectation that they should use their bargaining </p>
<p>power to push for a moderate, centrist government. Our support for them rested on </p>
<p>them doing so.” </p>
<p><b>488. </b> In a paper on the handover of security responsibility, the MOD reported that the </p>
<p>development of the ISF was “broadly on track”. The two key challenges remained </p>
<p>agreeing what the role of the Iraqi Government should be in defining the handover plan; </p>
<p>and the capacity of the Iraqi administration and Security Forces to assume responsibility, </p>
<p>given the risk of increasing sectarianism and militia infiltration.</p>
<p>230</p>
<p><b>489. </b> Lt Gen Houghton spoke to the MOD paper at the meeting.</p>
<p>231</p>
<p> He reported that the </p>
<p>development of the ISF in southern Iraq was “going well”. The Iraqi Army in particular </p>
<p>had progressed well although they would need support for another year and further work </p>
<p>was needed on counter-insurgency operations and logistics. Police capacity lagged </p>
<p>behind, as per the original US military plan for ISF development. </p>
<p><b>490. </b> The record of Mr Blair’s video conference with President Bush on 20 December </p>
<p>shows that Mr Blair argued that communication with the Sunni community needed </p>
<p>to continue: “We needed a sense that we were starting to split people away from </p>
<p>the insurgency.”</p>
<p>232</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>491. </b> Mr Blair suggested that a reduction in the level of violence would have a dramatic </p>
<p>political impact and that it was important to “set out the forward perspective” on security, </p>
<p>in order to “cement the changes brought by the election”. </p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>494. </b> ACM Torpy wrote that MOD funding might be needed if “as first indications </p>
<p>suggest, neither FCO nor DFID can find any further financial resources”. He observed </p>
<p>that “we will also need to push the other Departments to deploy the staff necessary to </p>
<p>get the PRTs off the ground quickly”.</p>
<p><b>495. </b> Mr Straw spoke by telephone to President Talabani on 21 December. </p>
<p>He emphasised:</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>572</p>
<p><b>499. </b> On 23 December, Mr Blair sent a Note to President Bush.</p>
<p>237</p>
<p> It began:</p>
<p>“We are agreed on the strategy: hands-on; to form a unity government; with a </p>
<p>competent team in charge, especially of MOI and MOD. How?” </p>
<p><b>500. </b> In answer to that question, Mr Blair proposed that:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>US and UK political teams should be highly active, which he commented was </p>
<p>“clearly happening”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Sunni outreach should be maintained so that the Sunni community knew </p>
<p>that “whatever happens in the election we are the guarantors that they </p>
<p>won’t be cut out”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Mr Allawi should be “bound in to a role”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>neighbouring Arab states should be encouraged to support Iraqi Sunnis;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the Kurds should be told to engage constructively;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US and UK should respond to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani’s legitimate </p>
<p>concern about too rapid a withdrawal of the MNF by making clear that “the price </p>
<p>of our staying is a ‘unity Government’”; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the US and UK should reach out to Muqtada al-Sadr; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UN should play a “real role”, including by endorsing the unity government </p>
<p>approach.</p>
<p><b>501. </b> Mr Blair suggested that these actions should be “tracked and reported on” by the </p>
<p>US and UK on a weekly basis. He wrote:</p>
<p>“I came back convinced, more than ever, that this is ‘make or break’, with Iraqis </p>
<p>basically wanting unity but lacking the guidance to get there. We should be </p>
<p>the guides.” </p>
<p><b>502. </b> In the final section of his Note, Mr Blair wrote: “Part of the whole business is </p>
<p>about communication.” He considered that in Iraq there was still a “massive level of </p>
<p>misunderstanding” of coalition motives and proposed that as soon as possible after a </p>
<p>new government had been formed “we publish a roadmap or forward vision” as the joint </p>
<p>work of the Iraqis and the coalition, endorsed by the UN. </p>
<p><b>503. </b> That should set out a programme for completing Iraqi security capability, a phased </p>
<p>drawdown of the MNF with conditional timelines, a programme of reconstruction and </p>
<p>a set of political goals. Mr Blair concluded: “Of course, it all depends on getting a </p>
<p>good government!”</p>
<p><b>504. </b> On the last day of 2005, Mr Patey reported:</p>
<p>“There are a number of contenders for the post of Prime Minister in the new </p>
<p>government … Realistically we expect the battle to come down to a showdown </p>

<p>between the two principal UIA contenders, Adel Abdul Mehdi (SCIRI) and Ibrahim </p>
<p>Ja’afari (Dawa). We see little sign of any willingness from any of the principal parties </p>
<p>in the UIA … to switch their support from their first choice candidate … and no </p>
<p>chance that they would allow even a Shia outsider … to take the job.”</p>
<p>238</p>
<p><b>505. </b> Mr Patey advised that the UK should not express a preference for a particular </p>
<p>candidate but should continue to encourage all the parties to agree a broad-based </p>
<p>representative coalition. </p>
<p><b>506. </b> Mr Patey reported that he had been:</p>
<p>“… pressed by some for an indication of the UK’s preferences, particularly on </p>
<p>candidates for Prime Minister. I have emphasised to all my interlocutors that, </p>
<p>while the UK has a clear interest in the outcome, our priority is for an acceptable </p>
<p>overall package ensuring a broadly effective and balanced government, containing </p>
<p>competent Ministers who should be non-sectarian, particularly where the key </p>
<p>security positions are concerned.” </p>
<p><b>January 2006</b></p>
<p><b>507. </b> Lt Gen Houghton reported to Gen Walker on 1 January that Gen Casey was </p>
<p>considering how best to prioritise and implement the various elements of the military </p>
<p>campaign (defeating terrorism, neutralising the Sunni insurgency and supporting </p>
<p>transition to effective ISF) in 2006 and how to respond to US political aspirations for </p>
<p>significant troop level reductions.</p>
<p>239</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>508. </b> In Lt Gen Houghton’s view, “the principal focus for 2006 should be the support to </p>
<p>Transition” with a campaign that focused on:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>building ISF capacity, with particular focus on the police and the security </p>
<p>ministries;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>reducing MNF presence and visibility and putting ISF increasingly in the lead;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>resourcing the stabilisation (principally by ISF) of the nine strategic cities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>increased use of the “soft elements of power rather than a kinetic approach”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>addressing the problem of militias; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>accelerating progress in establishing the Rule of Law.</p>
<p><b>509. </b> Lt Gen Houghton indicated that he thought that this type of focus on transition was </p>
<p>likely to be Gen Casey’s preferred approach, but “it may not play well to US aspirations </p>
<p>for the defeat of terrorism”. He also commented that he thought that Gen Casey was </p>

<p>unlikely to wish to reduce US force levels by more than five brigades by the autumn. </p>
<p>He concluded: </p>
<p>“Of course, the Iraqis also have a vote – and I continue to judge that accelerated </p>
<p>transition (aka an end to occupation) will be their determined intent.”</p>
<p><b>510. </b> Lt Gen Houghton also reported “widespread, largely Sunni, demonstrations against </p>
<p>electoral fraud”. </p>
<p><b>511. </b> In a meeting with former Prime Minister Allawi in early January, Mr Blair </p>
<p>emphasised that the UK intended to be much more “hands on” in helping to form a </p>
<p>government this time round:</p>
<p>“It was essential to promote the emergence of a unity government … The US/UK </p>
<p>could not of course force the formation of an NUG [National Unity Government] but </p>
<p>there was strong international support for this among regional governments and </p>
<p>from the UN … as well as the coalition. Within Iraq also, there was strong disposition </p>
<p>for an NUG …” </p>
<p>240</p>
<p><b>512. </b> In discussion with President Bush on 10 January, Mr Blair said that it would help </p>
<p>to unlock outstanding aid pledges if the new government set out a “forward programme” </p>
<p>covering security, coalition posture and reconstruction, which the UN and the coalition </p>
<p>could get behind:</p>
<p>“This would allow us to explain again that we were only in Iraq to help a democratic </p>
<p>government withstand anti-government forces, and that a reduction in violence </p>
<p>would make it easier for us to draw down.” </p>
<p>241</p>
<p><b>513. </b> Mr Straw visited Basra and Baghdad in early January.</p>
<p>242</p>
<p> He met representatives </p>

<p>government. In his view, achieving that mattered more than who became Prime Minister.</p>
<p><b>514. </b> Mr Straw reported to Mr Blair that some Sunni representatives told him that they </p>
<p>had been “cheated out of seats”. He responded that “they must accept the election </p>

<p>community”. </p>
<p><b>515. </b> In preparation for a discussion at DOP(I) on 12 January 2006, the British Embassy </p>

<p><b>516. </b> At DOP(I) on 12 January, Mr Straw said that “the key issue was how we </p>
<p>encouraged the creation of a credible, sustainable government of national unity </p>
<p>in Iraq”.</p>
<p>244</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>517. </b> During his recent visit, Shia contacts had told him that they were finding it </p>
<p>“increasingly difficult to restrain their community in the face of Sunni insurgent activity” </p>
<p>and felt the UK and the coalition were showing too much partiality to the Sunnis. </p>
<p><b>518. </b> In discussion, (unidentified) attendees made the points that:</p>
<p>“The longer the political vacuum continued, the greater the risk of losing momentum </p>
<p>and of seeing a further deterioration in security. However, it was essential to get the </p>
<p>new Iraqi government right and this might result in delay.</p>
<p>“We should continue to emphasise to the Shia that the Sunnis must participate in the </p>
<p>next government as of right, on the basis of the results of the elections.”</p>
<p><b>519. </b> On 15 January, Lt Gen Houghton reported that Gen Casey had returned from </p>
<p>Washington with “political cover” for two key issues: that transition would be the central </p>
<p>focus of the Campaign Plan during 2006 and that there would be no political demand for </p>
<p>troop reductions beyond what Gen Casey was content with.</p>
<p>245</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>520. </b> Lt Gen Houghton wrote that:</p>
<p>“The emphasis on transition has had the effect of bringing some of the practicalities </p>
<p>and difficulties into sharp focus. From the perspective of MND(SE) there are a </p>
<p>number of local challenges: the Japanese, PRTs, logistic practicalities and US </p>
<p>concerns regarding the Iranian border. I judge that all of these can be finessed … </p>
<p>The major threat to UK aspirations for transition is one of timing and derives from </p>
<p>the desire for the Iraqi government to be the authority for making the decisions on </p>
<p>provincial transfer. It is in this context that the early seating of the next government is </p>
<p>important … for every week beyond the end of February that the government fails to </p>
<p>form, a further week must be added to the anticipated timing of transfer … </p>
<p>“What we must avoid doing at all costs, I judge, is to do our own thing (unilaterally) </p>
<p>regardless of the niceties of the internal Iraqi process. I say this for two primary </p>
<p>reasons:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>First the UK is acknowledged to be the USA’s primary strategic partner in </p>
<p>Iraq, with a proportionate political and military investment. To break company </p>
<p>with the US on the process of transition would be to risk undermining that </p>

<p>suspicion in Baghdad, borne of events last September, that MND(SE) is an </p>

<p><b>525. </b> Visiting Washington on 20 January, Sir Nigel Sheinwald told all of his interlocutors </p>

<p>Mr Blair placed importance on “seizing the opportunity presented by the elections”.</p>
<p>249</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>526. </b> That meant moving quickly to form a genuine unity government, with capacity </p>
<p>to make and implement decisions. Sunni outreach should continue, and the new </p>
<p>government should make “an early, comprehensive statement of their programme”. </p>
<p>That would set the context for a “conditions-based drawdown of forces in MND(SE)”. </p>
<p><b>527. </b> Diplomatic reporting from Baghdad in early 2006 was heavily focused on the </p>
<p>formation of a new government. As the reports contained accounts of private discussions </p>
<p>with individual politicians, many of whom remain active in Iraqi politics, the Inquiry will </p>
<p>not give a detailed description of them.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>578</p>
<p><b>529. </b> Evidence seen by the Inquiry confirms that in January and February the UK </p>
<p>stepped up its efforts to encourage the Iraqis to form a broad and inclusive government </p>
<p>of national unity through high-level visits and rounds of phone calls.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>530. </b> On 17 January, Dr Roger Hutton, MOD Director Joint Commitments Policy, </p>
<p>provided Dr Reid with advice on the timing and detail of the deployment of UK forces to </p>
<p>Helmand province.</p>
<p>252</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>531. </b> Dr Hutton advised that the Chiefs of Staff recommended the immediate </p>
<p>deployment of the full Helmand Task Force (HTF), and that they believed the three </p>
<p>conditions for this set by Dr Reid had now been satisfied; there was a coherent UK </p>
<p>force posture in Helmand; there was a coherent NATO force posture for Afghanistan; </p>
<p>and other UK government departments were prepared to engage in a coherent cross-</p>
<p>departmental effort in Helmand.</p>
<p><b>532. </b> The Chiefs of Staff’s recommendation was “also crucially dependent” on fulfilling </p>
<p>three criteria, including:</p>
<p>“Achievability within current UK commitments. The HTF, taken together with the HQ </p>
<p>ARRC [Allied Rapid Reaction Corps] deployment, calls on a variety of capabilities, </p>
<p>and a lengthy and complex logistic tail. With the continued commitment to Iraq </p>
<p>through 2006, this presents significant but manageable challenges, particularly for </p>
<p>logistic enablers (including air transport). During this period we will still be able to </p>
<p>undertake immediate contingency operations, but on a limited basis.” </p>
<p><b>533. </b> The advice was considered by a group of Ministers and officials, known colloquially </p>
<p>as the “Reid Group”, on 18 January, and they agreed to recommend that the UK proceed </p>
<p>with the immediate deployment of the full HTF. </p>
<p><b>534. </b> Dr Reid wrote to Mr Blair the following day, to say that the Ad Hoc Ministerial Group </p>
<p>recommended to Cabinet that the UK should proceed with a full deployment of the HTF </p>
<p>to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>253</p>
<p> Dr Reid would be seeking a discussion and decision at Cabinet on </p>
<p>26 January. </p>
<p><b>535. </b> Dr Reid’s letter recalled the assurances he had been given, including that “UK </p>
<p>forces can meet the planned level of commitments in Iraq and Afghanistan, though </p>
<p>some capabilities will be tight”. He recognised that Mr Browne was “disappointed” at the </p>
<p>anticipated additional call on the Reserve, but explained:</p>
<p>“I have assured him that we will look at how the changing complexion of our </p>

<p><b>536. </b> Lord Walker told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“We were being asked can we do this, and we said, ‘Yes, we can do it and this is </p>
<p>the penalty we pay’ but none of those penalties were sufficient, I think, for us to say </p>
<p>‘Those are so grave that you should not do this.’ So we were giving them the advice, </p>
<p>which they were following. I don’t think we had any difficulty with that.”</p>
<p>254</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>537. </b> Lt Gen Fry told the Inquiry that, although some people argued that further </p>
<p>commitments should not be taken on until it was clear that the UK could draw down </p>
<p>significantly in Iraq, there were a lot of competing arguments, including “a view within </p>
<p>the British army that they could have more success in Afghanistan than they could </p>
<p>have in Iraq”.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p><b>538. </b> As planning for transition continued, Mr James Tansley, the British Consul General </p>
<p>in Basra, reported on 20 January that: </p>
<p>“There is some nervousness, particularly in US circles, that if the British military </p>
<p>leave Maysan then the border would become more porous to the smuggling of </p>
<p>weapons. But this argument pre-supposes that MND(SE) have control over the </p>
<p>border, which they do not (and nor realistically could they with current resources). </p>
<p>Their efforts have rather been on building capacity in the DBE [Department of Border </p>
<p>Enforcement], which is likely to continue post-election. There is also a less defined </p>
<p>concern about Iranian influence. But again it is difficult to see how military transition </p>
<p>would affect that.”</p>
<p>256</p>
<p><b>539. </b> Mr Tansley added:</p>
<p>“The situation … in Maysan and Muthanna underlines why PRTs in those provinces </p>
<p>are not required. Military transition will mean no international staff will be stationed </p>
<p>in Maysan and Muthanna, and travel there by them is likely to be only possible with </p>
<p>military escort (it would likely require a battle group).” </p>
<p><b>540. </b> On 24 January, Gen Walker wrote to Lieutenant General David Richards, </p>
<p>Commander of the ARRC, to summarise the UK’s position.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p> Gen Walker described:</p>
<p>“… the very tight capability and resource position that HMG and the British Armed </p>

<p>deployment in the Balkans.” </p>
<p><b>541. </b> Gen Walker returned to the issue of resources later in his letter: </p>
<p>“Militarily, the UK force structure is already stretched and, with two concurrent </p>
<p>medium scale operations in prospect, will soon become exceptionally so in </p>
<p>niche areas.” </p>
<p><b>542. </b> When he spoke to President Bush on 24 January, Mr Blair suggested that </p>
<p>they should maintain a very firm line that only a national unity government would </p>
<p>be acceptable.</p>
<p>258</p>
<p><b>543. </b> The decision to deploy to Helmand was approved in Cabinet on </p>
<p>26 January 2006.</p>
<p>259</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>544. </b> The minutes record that Dr Reid “was looking carefully at where the burden on </p>
<p>our troops could be reduced, including in Iraq and Bosnia and hoped to be able to report </p>
<p>troop and cost reductions in coming months”. </p>
<p><b>545. </b> Mr Blair concluded that:</p>
<p>“The Ministry of Defence and FCO should continue to discuss with Her Majesty’s </p>
<p>Treasury the opportunities to draw down force levels in other operational areas, </p>
<p>including the Balkans.” </p>
<p><b>546. </b> That afternoon, in a statement to Parliament, Dr Reid announced that the UK was </p>
<p>“preparing for a deployment to southern Afghanistan” which included a PRT as “part of a </p>
<p>larger, more than 3,300-strong British force providing the security framework”.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>547. </b> Dr Reid explained that the total number of UK troops in Afghanistan would fluctuate </p>
<p>over the next few months, peaking at 5,700 before reducing to fewer than 4,700 </p>
<p>and that:</p>
<p>“The size and structure of the task force has been guided by a careful assessment </p>
<p>of the likely tasks and threats that it will face. What matters is that we put the right </p>
<p>forces in to do the job and to do it safely and well, and I make no apology if that </p>
<p>requires more soldiers than some people originally envisaged.”</p>
<p><b>548. </b> Dr Reid stated that “careful account” had been taken of the UK’s other </p>
<p>commitments, when determining the size of the deployment: “This deployment is </p>
<p>manageable alongside those other, wider commitments, including Iraq. It does not </p>

<p>require draw down in Iraq. As we have said continually, that will be based on conditions </p>
<p>in Iraq itself.”</p>
<p><b>549. </b> In the debate that followed, Dr Reid commented that he did not consider that </p>
<p>“building a modern Afghanistan … will be an easy or a short process”.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p> Part of the </p>
<p>reason, in his view, was that “unlike Iraq”, Afghanistan lacked: </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a central corporate governance, in tradition and structure; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a developed middle class; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>mineral resources. </p>
<p><b>550. </b> Mr Blair told the Inquiry that the proposal to deploy significant numbers to </p>
<p>Afghanistan had come from the MOD:</p>
<p>“… they said it is going to be tough for us, but they said we can do it and we should </p>
<p>do it. So in a sense, right at the moment it was difficult in Iraq, we were prepared to </p>
<p>make the additional commitment to Afghanistan.”</p>
<p>262</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>551. </b> In his weekly report on 29 January, Lt Gen Houghton wrote:</p>
<p>“I am aware that there are many in London who would like a greater degree of </p>
<p>certainty about the viability of UK transition plans. I judge that, for the moment, I am </p>
<p>not able to give such reassurances … the process for the transfer of security control </p>
<p>in the provinces must rest on political and security decisions made in Baghdad … </p>
<p>and both decisions have attendant problems:</p>
<p>a. </p>
<p>Political – The (Iraqi) political problem regarding decision-making is primarily </p>
<p>one of timing. If the new government is not seated until April, then the </p>
<p>desired window for the transfer of Maysan will come under severe pressure. </p>
<p>But at least the decision itself will be an easy one since the new government </p>
<p>are likely to seize on the political benefits that derive from the early transition </p>
<p>of certain provinces.</p>
<p>b. </p>
<p>Security – The security decision is a more complex one. It is less an issue </p>
<p>of meeting the stipulated conditions and more an issue of whether or not </p>
<p>General Casey is content with our plan. The most disturbing element of the </p>
<p>plan – as viewed through US eyes – is the intent to physically vacate Maysan </p>
<p>Province, with the (potentially wrongly) inferred possibility of a less secure </p>
<p>border … My judgement is that our plan is sound and will result in a situation </p>
<p>in which the border could receive more focused attention and the likelihood </p>
<p>of violence will reduce, since so much of it is simply an emotive response </p>
<p>to our presence. But we should not underestimate the US concerns about </p>
<p>Iranian influence.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>582</p>
<p><b>552. </b> Mr Blair met Secretary Rice on 30 January and set out a proposal that the new </p>
<p>Iraqi Government should announce a forward programme, including security transition, </p>
<p>soon after it had been formed.</p>
<p>264</p>
<p> Secretary Rice was reported to have agreed. </p>
<p><b>553. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on the same day, Mr Blair said that he </p>
<p>was concerned about the length of time it was taking to form a new government.</p>
<p>265</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>February 2006</b></p>
<p><b>554. </b> Gen Walker advised DOP(I) on 2 February that, although Gen Casey remained </p>
<p>content that the UK should continue to aim for transition in Muthanna and Maysan </p>
<p>in May, Gen Casey had raised concerns about the approach during a recent  </p>
<p>visit to MND(SE).</p>
<p>266</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>555. </b> In particular, Gen Casey was worried about “opening up the coalition’s flank to </p>
<p>Iran”. He had also questioned whether the proposed “one-step” model for transition </p>
<p>would set an unhelpful precedent for the rest of Iraq. </p>
<p><b>556. </b> DOP(I) commissioned the MOD to produce a paper reflecting cross-departmental </p>
<p>concerns about the handover “based on a robust assessment of the conditions in the </p>
<p>two provinces”.</p>
<p><b>557. </b> The following day, a Private Secretary advised Mr Blair that what was needed was </p>
<p>for the MOD to “produce a thorough and rigorous analysis of the conditions in Muthanna </p>
<p>and Maysan, setting out why these allow for hand over”.</p>
<p>267</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>558. </b> Mr Blair commented that “there must be no sense of our cutting back unless it is </p>
<p>consistent with the state of security”.</p>
<p>268</p>
<p><b>559. </b> On 3 February, an update for Mr Blair on forming the new government said:</p>
<p>“Little progress this week, though the main party leaders are now meeting. There is </p>
<p>a danger that, in London at least, the system is too focused on security transition … </p>
<p>and not enough on government formation … We keep pressing for new thinking on </p>
<p>possible forcing mechanisms.” </p>
<p>269</p>
<p><b>560. </b> Mr Blair signalled with a tick that he agreed a proposal to write to members of </p>
<p>DOP(I) expressing concern about the pace of government formation and explaining it </p>
<p>should be the main effort in coming weeks. </p>

<p><b>561. </b> Lt Gen Houghton reported similar concerns expressed by Gen Casey in his weekly </p>
<p>report on 5 February, but:</p>
<p>“The good news is that, so long as the conditions are met, he [Casey] is absolutely </p>
<p>content with the timeframe for and principle of transition in Maysan and Muthanna. </p>
<p>We can brief that to our Ministers with confidence.”</p>
<p>270</p>
<p><b>562. </b> Dr Reid presented a paper on transition in Maysan and Muthanna to DOP(I) on </p>
<p>15 February.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p> He recommended that, as part of a longer-term plan to achieve a small </p>
<p>residual MNF presence in MND(SE) by the end of 2006, both provinces should make the </p>
<p>transition in May, which would require a firm decision in early March. Delay would risk a </p>
<p>further erosion of Iraqi consent. </p>
<p><b>563. </b> To assuage US concerns, the plan had been adapted to include a residual </p>
<p>UK military presence (of approximately 120 troops) to provide ongoing support and </p>
<p>mentoring to the Iraqi army. Dr Reid’s paper acknowledged, however, that the MNF had </p>
<p>only limited control of the 285km border with Iran. </p>
<p><b>564. </b> DOP(I) agreed the approach set out in the paper.</p>
<p>272</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>565. </b> Mr Blair made clear that his key concern was that the UK should be able to </p>
<p>demonstrate clearly that the conditions for transition had been met and that this was as </p>
<p>a result of the increasing capacity of the Iraqi Security Forces. The UK should not be </p>
<p>handing over for political reasons. </p>
<p><b>566. </b> In the same meeting Dr Reid, explained that he was concerned to maintain the </p>
<p>morale of UK troops in Iraq. While this was, at present, “adequate” and did not affect </p>
<p>effectiveness, he believed that the troops felt that they were fighting an asymmetric </p>
<p>battle in which the enemy was increasingly bold and their own actions were  </p>
<p>increasingly constrained. </p>
<p><b>567. </b> Mr Blair told DOP(I) that a delay in the formation of a government was not </p>
<p>necessarily disadvantageous, as it presented an opportunity to exploit underlying splits </p>
<p>in the UIA. </p>
<p><b>568. </b> DOP(I) agreed to pursue contact with Muqtada al-Sadr. </p>
<p><b>569. </b> Mr Straw visited Baghdad once again from 20 to 21 February, with objectives </p>
<p>“squarely on government formation”.</p>
<p>273</p>
<p> With all his interlocutors he pressed the case for </p>
<p>rapid formation of a government of national unity.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>584</p>
<p><b>570. </b> Mr Blair gave instructions on 20 February to push forward plans to reach out to </p>
<p>al-Sadr, focusing initially on his inner circle, but making clear that an invitation for direct </p>
<p>talks was on the table.</p>
<p>275</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>571. </b> As the period of time taken to form a new government extended, British military </p>
<p>commanders in Iraq observed an increase in violence.</p>
<p>276</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>572. </b> Lieutenant General John Cooper, GOC MND(SE) from December 2005 to July </p>
<p>2006, told the Inquiry that the lack of a new national government following the elections </p>
<p>in December 2005 created a vacuum “and on the security side, everything was </p>
<p>containable but there was this sense of increasing military activity, particularly from the </p>
<p>Jaysh al-Mahdi.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p> JAM was increasingly active and better equipped, and benefiting from </p>
<p>direct assistance from Iran.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>573. </b> On 22 February, the al-Askari mosque in Samarra, the fourth most revered </p>
<p>shrine in Shia Islam and the only major Shia shrine under sole Sunni protection, </p>
<p>was bombed.</p>
<p>278</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>574. </b> Early in the morning, a group of men dressed as Iraqi Police Commandos entered </p>
<p>the mosque and detonated explosives beneath its dome, bringing it down.</p>
<p>279</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>575. </b> In a video conference with President Bush later that day, Mr Blair commented that </p>
<p>an event such as the bombing could become either a moment of unity or a further step </p>
<p>into sectarianism.</p>
<p>280</p>
<p> It was important that Shia and Sunni leaders should come together. </p>
<p>The US and UK should expose and oppose the terrorists’ aim to promote sectarianism, </p>
<p>and should consider providing funds for the reconstruction of the shrine. </p>
<p><b>576. </b> A minute on the bombing written for Mr Blair by his Private Secretary on </p>
<p>23 February said:</p>
<p>“This could serve as a catalyst for overcoming sectarianism and securing national </p>
<p>unity. But there is a risk that (if mismanaged) violence could escalate. The Iraqi </p>
<p>Government’s response will be crucial. A curfew is in place in Baghdad and </p>
<p>Samarra. All police on leave have been recalled: aim is to ensure top security </p>
<p>around Friday’s prayers in Samarra.” </p>

<p>585</p>
<p><b>577. </b> The British Embassy Washington reported on 23 February that President Bush had </p>
<p>strongly condemned the al-Askari attack.</p>
<p>282</p>
<p> His statement also urged the Iraqi people to </p>
<p>exercise restraint, and “to pursue justice in accordance with the laws and Constitution </p>
<p>of Iraq”. </p>
<p><b>578. </b> An official from the National Security Council had told Embassy officials:</p>
<p>“Notwithstanding blanket US media coverage depicting imminent civil war, the </p>
<p>Administration were reserving judgement on whether counter-attacks on Sunni </p>
<p>mosques and demonstration represented a total breakdown along sectarian </p>
<p>lines. The conduct of Friday prayers could be a litmus test of which way </p>
<p>events would turn.”</p>
<p><b>579. </b> The JIC reviewed the state of the jihad in Iraq on 23 February.</p>
<p>283</p>
<p> It recorded that </p>
<p>the number of suicide bombings in Iraq had fallen by 25 percent since October, but did </p>
<p>not know why. </p>
<p><b>580. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“II. al-Zarqawi’s Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I) and other jihadist groups remain a potent, </p>
<p>confident force with proven resilience …</p>
<p>“III. Jihadist groups are now predominantly Iraqi and Iraqi-led. Increasing numbers of </p>
<p>Iraqis are becoming suicide bombers. Foreign fighters continue to travel to Iraq but </p>
<p>the jihad in Iraq is becoming self-sustaining in manpower, although external funding </p>
<p>is still important.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“V. Many Iraqi jihadists (and certainly Zarqawi and most foreign fighters) will never </p>
<p>be reconciled to the current political process. But some of their Iraqi followers might </p>
<p>be, if the new government includes credible Sunni representation and is able to </p>
<p>deliver on at least some Sunni expectations. Conversely, continuing Sunni alienation </p>
<p>will drive the jihadists and nationalists closer together.”</p>
<p><b>581. </b> The JIC judged that not all members of the Iraqi jihadist groups were driven by </p>
<p>Islamist extremism:</p>
<p>“… the jihadist message of uncompromising resistance to ‘occupation’ and a </p>
<p>government perceived as dominated by Shia and Iran resonates strongly with </p>
<p>many Sunnis. The activities of the Ministry of Interior (MOI) security forces, widely </p>
<p>believed by Sunnis to be behind a campaign of sectarian assassinations, and </p>
<p>the human rights abuses revealed at the MOI detention centres, have served to </p>
<p>increase support.”</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>586</p>
<p><b>582. </b> The JIC assessed that a minority of Sunnis regarded suicide attacks on Shia </p>
<p>targets as justified. AQ-I was capitalising on the increasing sectarian tensions, and was </p>
<p>claiming to have assassinated 26 Badr members since the start of the year under the </p>
<p>guise of protecting the Sunni community.</p>
<p><b>583. </b> On 25 February, the British Embassy Baghdad reported to the FCO on the </p>
<p>aftermath of the al-Askari bombing.</p>
<p>284</p>
<p> Mr Patey summarised the situation as:</p>
<p>“Iraqi politicians begin to pull together. Agreement to a first meeting of the </p>
<p>broadly-based National Advisory Committee this evening, 25 February. Khalilzad </p>
<p>and I will attend. Level of violence now significantly lower with imposition of curfew </p>
<p>helping to reduce number of incidents. 119 confirmed civilian deaths in total to date. </p>
<p>But situation remains fragile and vulnerable to a terrorist spectacular.”</p>
<p><b>584. </b> Mr Patey also reported a “well-received” press conference by Prime Minister </p>
<p>Ja’afari, “in which he highlighted that those behind the recent violence were using </p>
<p>sectarian tensions to provoke a civil war in the country”. He had announced the </p>
<p>deployment of armed forces to the most affected areas and special measures to protect </p>
<p>places of worship across Iraq. Unconfirmed figures suggested that 51 mosques had </p>
<p>been attacked in a wave of violence following the al-Askari bombing. </p>
<p><b>585. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald continued his efforts to reach out to those close to the Sunni </p>
<p>insurgency with another round of talks in mid-February.</p>
<p>285</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>586. </b> The following week he wrote to Mr Hadley explaining that the aim of the talks was </p>
<p>to maintain the dialogue and to expand the group, an aim he had achieved. </p>
<p><b>587. </b> In particular, Sir Nigel had wanted to persuade his interlocutors to stick with </p>
<p>the political process despite its frustrations and their concerns over Iran and rising </p>
<p>sectarianism. With the exception of the Ba’athists, all those with whom he spoke had </p>
<p>reiterated their commitment to the political process and promised to use their influence </p>
<p>with the insurgents.</p>
<p><b>March 2006</b></p>
<p><b>588. </b> Dr Howells told DOP(I) on 2 March that, although it had been hoped that the </p>
<p>al-Askari bombing would have “a positive catalytic effect on Iraqi politicians, and push </p>
<p>them toward the early formation of a unity government”, unfortunately that did not </p>
<p>appear to be happening and the security situation remained “tense”.</p>
<p>286</p>
<p> Further delay was </p>
<p>possible in the formation of a government. </p>

<p>9.4  |  June 2005 to May 2006</p>
<p>587</p>
<p><b>589. </b> In discussion, it was proposed that the UK should take a view on next steps </p>
<p>in the political process. Was it better to hold out for a strong government, or have a </p>
<p>government as quickly as possible? Ministers agreed that “we should establish a clear </p>
<p>British view on next steps in the political process”. </p>
<p><b>590. </b> In his weekly report on 5 March, Lt Gen Houghton reflected on whether Iraq was at </p>
<p>risk of civil war:</p>
<p>“The potential for civil war in Iraq does have to be thought through, if only to plan </p>
<p>more thoroughly to avert it. Assessments here indicate that the underlying conditions </p>
<p>conducive to civil war exist in Iraq now, but not yet at a level of severity which makes </p>
<p>civil war either imminent or inevitable. The main conditions … are: ethno-sectarian </p>
<p>divisions; high levels of violence; an erosion of central authority; and the rise of </p>
<p>competing centres of authority. Many of the underlying indicators which presage </p>
<p>a move towards civil war are becoming more evident. Specifically, there has been </p>
<p>a change in the character of the violence: it is now more sectarian and less anti-</p>
<p>coalition. There is some ethno-sectarian mobilisation of militias and some minor </p>
<p>movement of populations. The indicators are worrying. </p>
<p>“But the innate resistance to civil war in Iraq is strong, as evidenced most recently </p>
<p>by the reaction to the destruction of the Golden Mosque in Samarra. Whatever the </p>
<p>ultimate statistics are for the extent of the subsequent sectarian violence, it was </p>
<p>relatively restrained, indicating the power of Shia religious leadership to control </p>
<p>their people in the interests of Iraq as a whole. Coalition presence (military and </p>
<p>diplomatic) also acts as a block against the underlying conditions becoming more </p>
<p>acute. But, given the planned and anticipated reductions in coalition presence, </p>
<p>the importance of sustaining central authority becomes ever clearer. The current </p>
<p>government is not … perceived as even-handed in security issues. Its continuation </p>
<p>in power makes civil war more likely. I therefore see the early seating of a strong, </p>
<p>representative, national government as vital.” </p>
<p>287</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>591. </b> On 7 March, Mr Blair told President Bush that in forming the new government it </p>
<p>was important to get the balance right between speed and quality.</p>
<p>288</p>
<p> He suggested that it </p>
<p>was important to try and secure a new government that month, and then for the US and </p>
<p>UK to support it and explain that it really was a national unity government. </p>
<p><b>592. </b> On 9 March, Mr Straw’s Private Secretary reported to Sir Nigel Sheinwald that </p>
<p>the focus on Sunni outreach was on Anbar province, where work was in hand to bring </p>
<p>up levels of Sunni participation in the police and the army, and significant releases of </p>
<p>detainees were planned.</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>588</p>
<p><b>593. </b> Dr Reid wrote to Mr Blair on 9 March that, as a result of the latest Force Level </p>
<p>Review, troop levels would be reduced in May 2006, from approximately 8,000 to </p>
<p>around 7,200.</p>
<p>290</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>594. </b> The reduction had been made possible by the “completion of various security </p>
<p>sector reform tasks, a reduction in the support levels for those tasks, and recent </p>
<p>efficiency measures in theatre”. </p>
<p><b>595. </b> Dr Reid wrote that he intended to announce the new force package in the House </p>
<p>of Commons on 13 March, and would make clear that “this is not a formal handover </p>
<p>of security responsibility” but would also “trail that the Joint Iraqi/coalition assessment </p>
<p>phase to look at future handover will begin shortly”. </p>
<p><b>596. </b> That would leave the way clear for a statement by the Iraqi Prime Minister on </p>
<p>security, so enabling the UK to confirm its intention to hand over in Muthanna and </p>
<p>Maysan in May/June. </p>
<p><b>597. </b> Dr Reid told DOP(I) on 9 March that the assessment of conditions in Maysan </p>
<p>and Muthanna would take place formally in April on a timetable that allowed handover </p>
<p>to take place in May.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p> He observed that emerging security problems might have an </p>
<p>impact on this. </p>
<p><b>598. </b> On 10 March, the JIC assessed the Islamist terrorist threat in the UK.</p>
<p>292</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>599. </b> The JIC assessed that the conflict in Iraq fitted easily into the jihadists’ “single </p>
<p>narrative” that a Zionist-Christian alliance was waging a war against Islam and that </p>
<p>Muslims must therefore take up arms against this alliance and its supporters, confirming </p>
<p>the belief of extremists that Islam was under attack and needed to be defended using </p>
<p>force. That reinforced the determination of terrorists who were already committed to </p>
<p>attacking the West and motivated others who were not. </p>
<p><b>600. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“Iraq is likely to be an important factor for some time to come in the radicalisation of </p>
<p>British Muslims and in motivating those extremists who view attacks against the UK </p>
<p>as legitimate.”</p>
<p><b>601. </b> Other conflicts – such as Bosnia, Chechnya and Palestine – had served a similar </p>
<p>purpose, but the UK’s profile in Iraq and Afghanistan was much higher.</p>
<p><b>602. </b> On 13 March, Dr Reid made a statement in the House of Commons about </p>
<p>operations and force levels in Iraq.</p>
<p>293</p>
<p> He announced that from May 2006 UK force levels </p>
<p>would reduce to “just over 7,000”, a reduction of around 800 personnel.</p>

<p>589</p>
<p><b>603. </b> Dr Reid told the House:</p>
<p>“That reflects the completion of our security sector reform tasks to develop the </p>
<p>capability of the Iraqi forces, including training the trainers and those involved in </p>
<p>guarding their own institutions. The reduction also reflects improvements in the way </p>
<p>we configure our own forces.”</p>
<p><b>604. </b> In relation to the al-Askari bombing, Dr Reid said:</p>
<p>“Some commentators have suggested that that act of terror will lead to a slide into </p>
<p>civil war. Those acts of terrorism are cruel and barbaric but they are not mindless. </p>
<p>They have a purpose: to undermine the efforts of the vast majority of the Iraqi people </p>
<p>who seek peace, stability and democracy in their country, and to try to break the will </p>
<p>of the coalition forces supporting them in that quest.</p>
<p>“… Our analysis is that civil war is neither imminent nor inevitable. However, in some </p>
<p>areas of Iraq, including Baghdad, there has been an increase in sectarian violence.”</p>
<p><b>605. </b> On 13 March, Mr Asquith updated the Iraq Strategy Group on the latest </p>
<p>developments in forming an Iraqi government.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p> The meeting of the Council of </p>
<p>Representatives planned for 12 March had been delayed by a week and it remained </p>
<p>uncertain who would be Prime Minister. </p>
<p><b>606. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald observed that:</p>
<p>“In our messages to the Iraqis, we should be clear about the political difficulties the </p>
<p>continuing political vacuum was causing the US and UK. We should also press for </p>
<p>Condoleezza Rice to visit Iraq to inject momentum into the process.”</p>
<p><b>607. </b> Lt Gen Fry, who had taken up post as SBMR-I on 9 March, told the Iraq Strategy </p>
<p>Group that Iraq was not yet in a state of civil war and that although there were real risks, </p>
<p>“a significant event” would be required to tip the balance. US Central Command’s view </p>
<p>was that “Iraq was still some way off being in an irrecoverable position”. </p>
<p><b>608. </b> On 15 March, at the request of the FCO and the MOD, the JIC assessed the </p>
<p>security situation in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>609. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“I. Levels of violence in southern Iraq are much lower than in Baghdad and Sunni </p>
<p>areas in the centre and north …</p>
<p>“II. The greatest potential for widespread violence lies in tensions between SCIRI’s </p>

<p>“III. Across the South, there is no strong administrative machinery to promote </p>
<p>security and stability …</p>
<p>“IV. The Iraqi security forces can cope with the low level of threat posed by the Sunni </p>
<p>Arab nationalist insurgents and jihadists. Their readiness to deal with the activities </p>
<p>of Shia extremists or intra-Shia violence is more uncertain. Army command, control </p>
<p>and logistics capabilities are all still developing, making major operations without </p>
<p>MNF support difficult. The police are a greater concern: they have multiple loyalties </p>
<p>and have taken sides in intra-Shia clashes. A minority of police, particularly in Basra, </p>
<p>is involved in attacks on the MNF, the assassination of Sunnis and organised crime.”</p>
<p><b>610. </b> The JIC considered the background, motives and objectives of Muqtada al-Sadr </p>
<p>on 16 March.</p>
<p>296</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>611. </b> The JIC judged that al-Sadr had emerged from the December election with </p>
<p>“great political clout” because Prime Minister Ja’afari depended on him to secure </p>
<p>his nomination.</p>
<p><b>612. </b> In terms of motivation, the JIC assessed:</p>
<p>“Sadr’s overriding priority is to increase his own power. He probably wants to </p>
<p>be a leading Shia religious authority, above party politics but able to influence </p>
<p>key government policies. He has a genuine desire to see (and get credit for) </p>
<p>improvements in the quality of life for his core constituency; his declared goals also </p>
<p>include: maintaining the unity of Iraq and delaying federalism; ensuring the centrality </p>
<p>of religion in politics; and securing a timetable for the departure of ‘occupation forces’.” </p>
<p><b>613. </b> The majority of JAM members were, in the JIC’s judgement, loyal to al-Sadr’s </p>
<p>directives, but a minority were under no effective control and continued to attack </p>
<p>the MNF. </p>
<p><b>614. </b> The JIC assessed that al-Sadr had consistently refused direct contact with </p>
<p>representatives of the coalition and judged that this reluctance was “unlikely to change </p>
<p>in the foreseeable future”.</p>
<p><b>615. </b> In his weekly report on 19 March, Lt Gen Fry reported that the MNF-I command </p>
<p>group had “wargamed” the implications of a “genuine civil war” in Iraq.</p>
<p>297</p>
<p><b>616. </b> The command group had concluded that civil war was not inevitable; a properly </p>
<p>constituted government of national unity could still defuse sectarian tension. But the </p>
<p>longer Iraq continued without such a government, the more likely civil war became. </p>

<p>could be high, but neither side had the capacity to deliver a decisive level of combat </p>
<p>power. Violence was concentrated in Baghdad and areas around it; other parts of </p>
<p>country could be peaceful.</p>
<p><b>617. </b> Civil war would further complicate the coalition’s mission, which was already </p>
<p>balanced, “rather uneasily”, between counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism. </p>
<p><b>618. </b> Lt Gen Fry wrote:</p>
<p>“We can talk ourselves into civil war, but my assessment is that we are some </p>
<p>way short of it at the moment. More importantly, given the limitations in sectarian </p>
<p>interface and combat power, it is difficult to see the condition in which civil war </p>
<p>would be an appropriate description. I judge that we are currently in a condition </p>
<p>of sectarian conflict characterised by insidious but relatively limited violence, and </p>
<p>that an escalation into the larger scale operations prosecuted by more formally </p>
<p>defined military entities which would constitute civil war is unlikely. This is not just </p>
<p>military semantics: civil war is an emotive, inflammatory and technically inaccurate </p>
<p>description, and we need to say so. A clear message to our domestic audience, </p>
<p>coalition partners and the Iraqi political classes would put the record straight, counter </p>
<p>speculation and stiffen the resolve of those in need of reassurance.”</p>
<p><b>619. </b> Lieutenant General Sir Robert Fry told the Inquiry:</p>
<p>“I see this with greater clarity in retrospect, but I think at the time what was actually </p>
<p>happening is that incoherent insurgency was becoming much more coherent, and </p>
<p>also there were reciprocal acts of provocation and violence between the Sunni and </p>
<p>the Shia communities which were leading to this rapidly escalating process … it </p>
<p>looked very much like civil war at the time.”</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>621. </b> In discussion with Gen Casey, Dr Reid noted that there had been “a real retreat </p>
<p>into sectarianism” in Iraq. Gen Casey agreed, but was of the view that Iraq was not in </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>592</p>
<p><b>622. </b> In the South, Dr Reid met Maj Gen Cooper who:</p>
<p>“… noted that corruption and intimidation were on the rise as was the murder rate. </p>
<p>Basra City was becoming a ‘criminal kingdom’. Outside this however there were </p>
<p>hopeful signs, with Muthanna progressing very well towards handover.”</p>
<p><b>623. </b> Dr Reid then visited Muthanna, where his Assistant Private Secretary recorded </p>
<p>that:</p>
<p>“The clear impression from commanders and troops alike was that the job … was </p>
<p>largely done and that the Iraqi security forces there were ready and able to take on </p>
<p>the task.”</p>
<p><b>624. </b> In preparation for a video conference with President Bush, on 21 March </p>
<p>Mr Phillipson told Mr Blair that:</p>
<p>“The security situation remains difficult. Since the Samarra bombing, [the] number of </p>
<p>murders has more than doubled to around 28 per day, with a significant proportion </p>
<p>‘execution style’. It’s impossible to say how many of these are ‘sectarian’, but there </p>
<p>is wider evidence – internal refugees, obvious and active militias – which suggest </p>
<p>[sic] an upsurge in strictly sectarian violence. But it is not a civil war, and the sort </p>
<p>of escalation of combat activity that would be needed to justify that description is </p>
<p>unlikely to happen.”</p>
<p>300</p>
<p><b>625. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush did not discuss sectarian violence in their video </p>
<p>conference on the same day.</p>
<p>301</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>626. </b> Mr Blair said that it would be important to have a clear communications strategy </p>
<p>for the immediate aftermath of the formation of a new Iraqi Government. Iraqi politicians </p>
<p>would need to stress that they were part of a national unity government and that they </p>
<p>welcomed the presence of the MNF. A programme setting out what work the US/UK and </p>
<p>Iraqis would do to take forward security and reconstruction should then be developed </p>
<p>rapidly. </p>
<p><b>627. </b> At Cabinet on 23 March, Dr Reid reported that there was a growing sectarian </p>
<p>divide in Iraq, with increasing militia and sectarian killings.</p>
<p>302</p>
<p> Much of it was based </p>
<p>on deliberate provocation from Al Qaida-associated terrorists, many of whom were </p>
<p>foreigners, or supporters of the former regime who were massacring Iraqi Shia and </p>
<p>attacking their holy sites. In response, the Shia were beginning to kill Sunnis, many of </p>
<p>whom were not associated with the violence. Dr Reid did not believe, however, that </p>
<p>the violence constituted a civil war. That was also the view of every Iraqi politician he </p>
<p>had met.</p>

<p>593</p>
<p><b>628. </b> Mr Benn reported to Cabinet that Prime Minister Ja’afari had promised a new </p>
<p>government would be formed by the end of April. Dr Reid said that he was confident that </p>
<p>a government of national unity would be formed. </p>
<p><b>629. </b> By the end of March, Mr Blair regarded the problem of forming a government in </p>
<p>Iraq as the top foreign policy for the UK and US governments.</p>
<p>303</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>630. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald and Mr Straw were to visit Iraq to try and add momentum to </p>
<p>the process. Mr Blair did not rule out a personal visit, if it would help. </p>
<p><b>631. </b> Mr Straw spoke to Secretary Rice on 29 March and agreed that they would visit </p>
<p>Baghdad together. Mr Straw observed that they:</p>
<p>“… would have to threaten the Iraqi leaders that US and UK support was not </p>
<p>unconditional and that we might be put in a position where we had to reconsider our </p>
<p>presence in Iraq.”</p>
<p>304</p>
<p><b>632. </b> On 30 March, Dr Reid reported to DOP(I) that the operational conditions for </p>
<p>handover in Maysan and Muthanna existed and that the UK should continue to press for </p>
<p>an accelerated process in theatre while showing due concern for the views of the Iraqis </p>
<p>and other allies.</p>
<p>305</p>
<p><b>633. </b> Mr Blair did not attend DOP(I) on 30 March.</p>
<p><b>634. </b> On the following day, Mr Blair’s Private Secretary advised the MOD that Mr Blair </p>
<p>had been considering the issue of transition in the light of DOP(I)’s agreement that the </p>
<p>UK should continue to press for an accelerated transition process and:</p>
<p>“He feels strongly that we should avoid pushing too hard on transition timescales, </p>
<p>and avoid any appearance that UK planning is based on our own internal priorities </p>
<p>rather than those of the Iraqis.”</p>
<p>306</p>
<p><b>635. </b> The note asked for an assessment of the realistic timeframe for transition, in the </p>
<p>light of the emerging delays to the process, for Mr Blair’s weekend box.</p>
<p><b>April 2006</b></p>
<p><b>636. </b> Mr Blair postponed a visit to Washington, planned for early April, because </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>594</p>
<p><b>637. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald explained to Mr Hadley that Mr Blair believed the “main effort </p>
<p>had to be to get the government formed quickly and then put a major effort into the </p>
<p>public presentation”.</p>
<p><b>638. </b> On 1 April, Sir Nigel sent Mr Hadley a Note from Mr Blair to President Bush </p>
<p>and asked that it be passed to the President in advance of a planned telephone </p>
<p>conversation.</p>
<p>308</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>639. </b> Mr Blair wrote that the purpose of his note was to consider how the political context </p>
<p>in both the US and UK might be changed. It covered other foreign policy issues as well </p>
<p>as Iraq. Mr Blair explained that he would have welcomed a discussion in person, but had </p>
<p>concluded that the political context was not right for a visit to the US. </p>
<p><b>640. </b> Mr Blair observed to President Bush</p>
<p> </p>
<p>that “Iraq pulls us down” and that the weight </p>
<p>of “propaganda” obscured an “inherently strong” case. </p>
<p><b>641. </b> Mr Blair considered that people considered the coalition to be “right in theory” since </p>
<p>the Iraqi people wanted democracy, but that in practice sectarian violence and the lack </p>
<p>of a government meant that “the facts on the ground beat the argument”. </p>
<p><b>642. </b> Mr Blair continued:</p>
<p>“We can’t afford for this to continue. I think it is time we started to take risks. We </p>
<p>need to put Iraq in a different place and then build out from there. I want to suggest </p>
<p>a strategy.”</p>
<p><b>643. </b> That strategy was:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Go “all out” to get a unity government in Iraq, including a high quality and neutral </p>
<p>Minister of the Interior who would send the message that Shia violence would </p>
<p>not be tolerated.</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>Publish a programme for the new Iraqi Government and for security transition </p>
<p>from the MNF to full Iraqi control which would create “a huge collective sense of </p>
<p>moving forward” and needed to be “a complete turning point.”</p>
<p><b>644. </b> Mr Blair proposed that “we should asap then build out from there” and use the </p>
<p>“renewed credibility of Iraq” to act in other areas including the Middle East Peace </p>
<p>Process, world trade, energy and climate change and Sudan. This would only be as </p>
<p>persuasive as it could be if Iraq was in better shape. Mr Blair argued that “this is the </p>
<p>time to go for it; to take risks. To strive and fail is so much better than not striving. But </p>
<p>actually, I think it could just succeed.”</p>

<p>9.4  |  June 2005 to May 2006</p>
<p>595</p>
<p><b>645. </b> In his phone call with President Bush on 2 April, Mr Blair reiterated the message </p>
<p>that “we had to go all out for a unity Government”.</p>
<p>309</p>
<p> Once it was formed the key was to </p>
<p>set out a “coherent programme” in particular on security. It would also be necessary to </p>
<p>provide help “on the media side”. </p>
<p><b>646. </b> Mr Straw and Secretary Rice visited Baghdad on 2 April to try to add momentum to </p>
<p>the political process.</p>
<p>310</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>647. </b> The IPU briefing for the visit advised that the focus should be “squarely on </p>
<p>government formation”, with the objective of pushing the Iraqis to agree a permanent </p>
<p>government. </p>
<p><b>648. </b> The British Embassy Baghdad reported that Mr Straw and Secretary Rice called on </p>
<p>President Talabani on 2 April.</p>
<p>311</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>649. </b> After acknowledging that President Talabani and other Iraqi leaders were facing a </p>
<p>difficult moment, Secretary Rice said that: </p>
<p>“She and the Foreign Secretary were in Iraq to urge them to finish the job of forming </p>
<p>the government quickly. The Iraqi people were becoming impatient and increasingly </p>
<p>concerned about stability. The ability of the country to sustain another event similar </p>
<p>to the Samarra mosque bombing was questionable. Every day that passed without </p>
<p>the formation of a new government increased that risk. Talabani knew how much </p>
<p>the US wanted Iraq to succeed. But the patience of the American people was being </p>
<p>exhausted and a democratic leader could do little without the support of his people.</p>
<p>“Key to making progress was to break the deadlock over agreeing the Prime </p>
<p>Minister. The US and UK shared the assessment of others that it was not going </p>
<p>to be possible for Ja’afari to secure the position. He did not have the necessary </p>
<p>cross-party support nor the full support of his own Alliance. It was clear that the </p>
<p>choice of Prime Minister was one for Iraqis to make. But it was equally clear that a </p>
<p>decision needed to be made on this as soon as possible.”</p>
<p><b>650. </b> President Talabani was reported to have welcomed the visit and “asserted that </p>
<p>most of the main issues surrounding the structure of the new government had now been </p>
<p>resolved”. He agreed that Dr Ja’afari was not the right person to lead Iraq at that time:</p>
<p>“But matters needed to proceed step by step if they were to reach a successful </p>
<p>conclusion. Perhaps with the help of this visit progress on the Prime Ministerial </p>
<p>nomination could be made in a matter of days.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>596</p>
<p><b>651. </b> In her memoir, Secretary Rice described meeting Dr Ja’afari during this visit:</p>
<p>“Jack and I had agreed that we’d take turns making the argument that he had to end </p>
<p>his pursuit of the prime minister position: I would go through the basic facts of the </p>
<p>situation, and Jack would appeal to him politician to politician. Everything we tried </p>
<p>met with stubbornness and obtuseness … I held my tongue and let Jack try again. </p>
<p>After a while, though, I just said to Ja’afari, ‘You aren’t going to be prime minister. </p>
<p>You have to step down. This isn’t because the United States wants it this way. The </p>
<p>Iraqis don’t want you, and that’s what matters.’ Jack appeared a little taken aback, </p>
<p>but I’d learned to be direct with Ja’afari, who now looked hurt as the translation rolled </p>
<p>forward. But he held his ground. </p>
<p>“… Not convinced that we’d gotten through, we went back to Ja’afari, and this time, </p>
<p>with only our interpreter in the room, delivered the message again. Even though he </p>
<p>resisted, we knew we’d gotten through this time.”</p>
<p>312</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>652. </b> In his weekly report on 2 April, Lt Gen Fry wrote:</p>
<p>“Sectarian tension and the possibility of civil war has tended to attract our attention </p>
<p>recently, but I judge the insidious and increasingly pervasive influence of the militias </p>
<p>to be the greatest single security challenge facing Iraq. This is particularly the case </p>
<p>where they provide not only gunmen on the street, but also an integrated political/</p>
<p>military organisation with the capacity to provide rudimentary social services: </p>
<p>essentially a state within a state.”</p>
<p>313</p>
<p><b>653. </b> Mr Blair met Secretary Rice on the evening of 3 April before she returned to </p>
<p>Washington after her visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>314</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>654. </b> They agreed on the need for rapid formation of an acceptable government of </p>
<p>national unity. Mr Blair explained the centrality of Iraq to the rest of the US and UK </p>
<p>agenda; without an Iraqi Government he and President Bush would get no traction for </p>
<p>their arguments on Iraq or other major international issues. Once a government was </p>
<p>formed it would be “desirable to build outwards and make ambitious moves in other </p>
<p>parts of the agenda in order to regain the political initiative”. </p>
<p><b>655. </b> On 4 April, Mr Patey sent an update to the FCO on the formation of a new </p>
<p>Iraqi Government following the visit by Secretary Rice and Mr Straw.</p>
<p>315</p>
<p> Although the </p>
<p>visitors had “delivered a strong message to Ja’afari”, he had nonetheless “affirmed his </p>
<p>determination to continue the fight to stay in situ”. </p>

<p>597</p>
<p><b>656. </b> Mr Patey and Mr Sawers, who was visiting Baghdad, were therefore conducting an </p>
<p>“immediate and intensive” round of talks with those Iraqi politicians “committed to getting </p>
<p>a replacement to Ja’afari” to encourage them to say that they would not support him in a </p>
<p>Parliamentary vote. </p>
<p><b>657. </b> Mr Patey judged that:</p>
<p>“We will need to press the parties to reach clear agreement on who they will support </p>
<p>if Ja’afari is removed to avoid another uncomfortably close or split vote rather than </p>
<p>the broad cross-party consensus necessary to give a new government of national </p>
<p>unity the strongest possible start in the circumstances.” </p>
<p><b>658. </b> Mr Patey also commented:</p>
<p>“… in the long run we needed to get away from reliance on sectarian based parties </p>
<p>and to reach out to moderates from all communities”.</p>
<p><b>659. </b> On 5 April, the JIC reviewed sectarianism in Iraq.</p>
<p>316</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>660. </b> The JIC judged that ethnic and sectarian rivalries had been a feature of Iraqi </p>
<p>society since the foundation of the state and had been exacerbated by Saddam </p>
<p>Hussein’s predominantly Sunni regime. Since his removal in 2003, tensions had </p>
<p>resurfaced. </p>
<p><b>661. </b> The JIC judged that:</p>
<p>“I. Sectarian violence in Iraq has been increasing since mid-2005: it has intensified </p>
<p>in the aftermath of the Samarra mosque bombing. Much of the violence is </p>
<p>concentrated among the mixed populations of Baghdad and its satellite towns. </p>
<p>Thousands of people – both Sunni and Shia – have been displaced.</p>
<p>“II. Al-Zarqawi’s Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I) initiated the anti-Shia campaign, exploiting </p>
<p>existing deep-seated tensions. Although AQ-I remains dominant, some Sunni </p>
<p>Arab nationalist insurgents are also carrying out sectarian attacks, in response to </p>
<p>ordinary Sunnis’ resentment of what they see as a Shia-dominated government </p>
<p>backed by Iran. </p>
<p>“III. The public Shia response to the increasing sectarian violence has been </p>
<p>restrained. Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani remains an important moderating figure. </p>
<p>But Shia patience may be wearing thin. Further attacks on Shia shrines or leading </p>
<p>political and spiritual leaders, are likely, and will severely test Shia resolve. </p>
<p>“IV. The greatest potential for large-scale street disorder aimed at Sunnis comes </p>
<p>from Muqtada al-Sadr’s Jaysh al-Mahdi (JAM) militia, particularly in Baghdad where </p>
<p>they are in de facto control in parts of Sadr City. But the most disciplined anti-Sunni </p>
<p>campaign is being run by the SCIRI party’s paramilitary Badr organisation, which </p>

<p>598</p>
<p>they have systematically embedded into state security structures, particularly the </p>
<p>Ministry of Interior (MoI) …</p>
<p>“V. Sectarian tension will not diminish: in some areas the violence has gained its own </p>
<p>momentum. MoI forces, the police and, to a lesser extent the Army, have their own </p>
<p>ethnic and sectarian fault-lines: if conflict deepens, their cohesion would be in doubt, </p>
<p>particularly in areas of religious diversity such as Baghdad. They would be unable to </p>
<p>cope in such areas without significant and close Multi-National Force support.”</p>
<p><b>662. </b> The JIC concluded that the issues facing Iraq’s politicians in the coming months – </p>
<p>federalism, de-Ba’athification and the influence of the Shia militas in the security </p>
<p>forces – were ones that were likely to increase sectarian divisions still further, despite </p>
<p>the anti-sectarian rhetoric of the politicians and that: “Reversing the growing trend of </p>
<p>sectarianism will take many years.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>663. </b> Dr Reid’s Private Secretary wrote to Mr Blair’s Private Secretary on 6 April in </p>
<p>response to his letter of 31 March which set out Mr Blair’s views about accelerating </p>
<p>transition.</p>
<p>317</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>664. </b> Dr Reid’s Private Secretary wrote:</p>
<p>“The Secretary of State agrees that we need to avoid the perception that we are </p>
<p>pressing too hard on transition timescales for national reasons, but he is anxious </p>
<p>that we do as much as possible to avoid further delays …”</p>
<p><b>665. </b> The Private Secretary explained that MND(SE) had submitted its first assessment </p>
<p>results for the four southern provinces to the MNF command in Baghdad; the results </p>
<p>for Muthanna, in particular, were encouraging. It was unlikely that MNF command </p>
<p>would reach a decision before 22 April, when Gen Casey would meet his Divisional </p>
<p>Commanders. </p>
<p><b>666. </b> The timetable for military transition was discussed at the Iraq Strategy Group on </p>
<p>7 April, with Mr Martin Howard, MOD Director General Operational Policy, reporting that </p>
<p>while the Governor of Muthanna had signed off the assessment for transition there, the </p>
<p>Governor of Maysan had not yet done so.</p>
<p>318</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>667. </b> Mr Asquith reported that the rocket attacks on Basra Palace on 4 April and the </p>
<p>continuing non-co-operation by the local authorities there meant that some of the civilian </p>
<p>staff were unable to operate effectively and an audit had indicated that there was “no </p>
<p>added value” from keeping them there. The FCO and DFID planned to recommend to </p>
<p>their Ministers a drawdown of civilian staff from Basra Palace until conditions on the </p>
<p>ground had improved. </p>

<p>9.4  |  June 2005 to May 2006</p>
<p>599</p>
<p><b>668. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald observed that this was a significant development and asked </p>
<p>the FCO and DFID to “consult more widely than their respective Secretaries of State”. </p>
<p>The subsequent advice to Ministers should make clear that:</p>
<p>“Set against the issue of not keeping people somewhere they could not operate, </p>
<p>there was the problem of re-entry [getting civilian staff back once they had </p>
<p>withdrawn] and the political or practical fall-out of the UK being driven out of the </p>
<p>Basra Palace by terrorists. A decision to locate our civilian presence at the airport </p>
<p>would represent a major failure.”</p>
<p><b>669. </b> In relation to the formation of the new Iraqi Government, Mr Asquith briefed the Iraq </p>
<p>Strategy Group that “the action had shifted to Najaf”. UK input to the debate was difficult </p>
<p>to manage, given the lack of a direct channel to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani. The Group </p>
<p>considered plans to send a letter from Mr Blair directly to the Grand Ayatollah.</p>
<p><b>670. </b> A draft of that letter intended to be “a clear request to help move events forward” </p>
<p>was provided to Mr Blair a few days later; he signed it on 12 April.</p>
<p>319</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>671. </b> Mr Blair wrote: </p>
<p>“… as leader of a country which has made huge sacrifices for Iraq, I trust it </p>
<p>is understandable that we attach great importance to there being an effective </p>
<p>government of national unity.” </p>
<p>320</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>672. </b> Mr Blair asked Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani:</p>
<p>“… to encourage leaders of the Shia community to recognise the need for urgent </p>
<p>agreement, in the next few days, on who should lead the next government.”</p>
<p><b>673. </b> Mr Blair’s letter was sent via an intermediary, and the UK could not be sure that it </p>
<p>would reach him.</p>
<p>321</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>674. </b> On 13 April, Sir Nigel told Mr Hadley:</p>
<p>“… despite the momentum created by the Straw/Rice visit, there was a risk of things </p>
<p>getting bogged down again. We needed to keep up the pressure and try to use the </p>
<p>meeting of the Council of Representatives planned for Monday as a further stimulus </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>600</p>
<p><b>676. </b> In his weekly report on 16 April, Lt Gen Fry commented:</p>
<p>“The continued debate about the nature of sectarian violence and the possibility </p>
<p>of civil war habitually misses a central point: the failure of AQ-I strategy. The </p>
<p>organisation has conducted a series of devastating attacks against the Shia </p>
<p>community … Whether their motive has been to disrupt the political process or </p>
<p>provoke civil war is irrelevant; on either count they have failed. Indeed, the most </p>
<p>interesting question is not ‘are we in civil war’ but ‘why are we not in civil war, given </p>
<p>the provocations?’ The answer has something to do with the resilience of Iraqi </p>
<p>society, residual hope in a better future and the orchestration of popular response </p>
<p>by senior leadership … Despite a run of attacks which have killed hundreds and </p>
<p>destroyed several places of worship there has been no large scale response and it </p>
<p>may be that the larger prize of a Shia government has imposed its own discipline. </p>
<p>Equally intriguing is what happens when this constraint no longer applies.” </p>
<p>323</p>
<p><b>677. </b> Discussions between the UK and US on the need for a new government continued </p>
<p>on 16 April when Mr Straw and Secretary Rice spoke by telephone.</p>
<p>324</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>678. </b> Mr Straw was “very worried indeed about the endless delays” and said that </p>
<p>“we had to keep up the pressure on the Iraqis, though the levers we had were limited”. </p>
<p>He and Secretary Rice agreed to make more phone calls to Iraqi politicians. </p>
<p><b>679. </b> At DOP(I) on 20 April, Mr Straw summarised the latest developments on </p>
<p>government formation.</p>
<p>325</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>680. </b> Although there was agreement on the candidates for President and Vice President, </p>
<p>the nominee for Prime Minister was yet to be agreed. In discussion it was observed that </p>
<p>the reasserting “the writ of government over ‘the street’” was becoming critical. </p>
<p><b>681. </b> Dr Reid reported that the readiness assessment for handover in Muthanna and </p>
<p>Maysan had been downgraded to “amber” by a senior US military officer on the basis </p>
<p>of “political uncertainty at the centre” and the risk of “the Sadrists causing problems </p>
<p>in the South”. </p>
<p><b>682. </b> Dr Reid considered that there were “real political risks” to any delay; local Iraqi </p>
<p>politicians and the public would be frustrated when it became clear that an assessment </p>
<p>of readiness had been overturned. There was also a risk of Shia resentment if the </p>
<p>Kurdish provinces in the North were handed over first. </p>
<p><b>683. </b> Mr Blair agreed with Dr Reid’s assessment and thought that concerns would </p>
<p>be largely resolved by the anticipated appointment of capable Ministers of Interior </p>
<p>and Defence. </p>

<p><b>684. </b> A review of the UK’s Sunni outreach efforts dated 21 April concluded that “a wide </p>
<p>range of Sunni politicians are now involved in the politics around government formation, </p>
<p>and a swathe of Sunnis with links to the nationalist insurgency have direct contact with </p>
<p>the coalition”.</p>
<p>326</p>
<p> </p>

<p><b>687. </b> Mr Patey told the Inquiry that Mr Maliki was a “surprise candidate” for the UK.</p>
<p>328</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>688. </b> Mr Asquith said that the UK had missed him as a potential contender because he </p>
<p>was not a prominent political figure in the Dawa party, and had occupied no position </p>
<p>in which the UK had to deal with him.</p>

<p> Section 9.3 contains more information on the </p>
<p>Dawa party. </p>
<p><b>689. </b> In Mr Asquith’s view, Mr Maliki was selected because the supporters of the other </p>
<p>candidates would not switch their votes to alternatives, except for him.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>692. </b> Mr Blair “hoped that the rest of the Government could now be formed quickly – this </p>
<p>would bring a renewed sense of hope to Iraq”. President Talabani estimated that it would </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>602</p>
<p><b>695. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 25 April, Mr Blair reported a sense </p>
<p>of optimism from Iraqi politicians.</p>
<p>334</p>
<p> He thought that if strong Sunni Ministers could be </p>
<p>brought into the Government there could be a real change for the better. Once that had </p>
<p>happened the US and UK would need to persuade the new Government to set out a </p>
<p>forward programme that would “make it clear to the international community that we had </p>
<p>started a new chapter”. </p>
<p><b>696. </b> On 27 April, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Mr Blair an account of his visit to Iraq.</p>
<p>335</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sir Nigel wrote that:</p>
<p>“We are widely seen as having played a major part in getting Sunni outreach going. </p>
<p>Casey and Zal [Khalilzad] will continue with it. I pressed them to try to move quickly </p>
<p>into a structured dialogue aimed at agreeing a ‘cease-fire’. Casey agrees with the </p>
<p>aim, but is moving cautiously.”</p>
<p><b>697. </b> In relation to the new Iraqi Government, Sir Nigel assessed that: “This is – so far – </p>
<p>a <b>real government of national unity</b>.” </p>
<p><b>698. </b> Sir Nigel set out a package of proposed support for the new Government including </p>
<p>policy officials, press officers and advisers for the new Defence Minister (see Section </p>
<p>10.2 for further details). Sir Nigel also reported:</p>
<p>“I said bluntly that we needed a right of veto over the Defence and Interior Ministries. </p>
<p>This was not contested.”</p>
<p><b>699. </b> Sir Nigel’s report concluded:</p>
<p>“This is the last big moment in the political timetable we created in 2004 and have, </p>
<p>despite all the problems, stuck to. The next few months will decide whether it </p>
<p>is possible to form a durable and effective unity government; and whether they  </p>
<p>can construct a political and security strategy which bears down quickly on the </p>
<p>sectarian violence.</p>
<p>“If so, Iraq could look very different by the end of the year.”</p>
<p><b>700. </b> Mr Blair annotated Sir Nigel’s advice: “We need a lot more work on their </p>
<p>programme, the transition, and a plan of communications inside and outside of Iraq.” </p>
<p>He asked Sir Nigel to supervise that work personally.</p>
<p><b>701. </b> Sir Nigel Sheinwald told the Inquiry that Sunni outreach:</p>
<p>“… was one of the areas where the Americans consistently thought that the UK – </p>
<p>because of history, because it was one of our political and diplomatic talents … they </p>
<p>regarded it as something where we had a voice and needed to be allowed to get </p>

<p>337</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>703. </b> Mr Blair added that the UK needed Mr Maliki’s assistance in addressing the </p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>604</p>
<p><b>Loss of a Lynx and its crew in Basra</b></p>
<p>On 6 May, a Lynx helicopter exploded in mid-air over Basra, killing all five of its crew.</p>
<p>341</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There were difficulties recovering the wreckage and the bodies of those killed because of </p>
<p>public disorder, attributed to increasing hostility towards UK forces in Basra at the time. </p>
<p>Eye-witness accounts suggested that the explosion was caused by the aircraft being fired </p>
<p>on from the ground.</p>
<p>Maj Gen Cooper reported that the crowds had numbered only 200-300 individuals at </p>
<p>their height and the situation had been brought under control within two or three hours.</p>
<p>342</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It seemed likely that the attack had been “perpetrated by rogue elements of JAM”.</p>
<p>Maj Gen Cooper reminded colleagues in London that, despite the significance and tragedy </p>
<p>of the loss of the Lynx and its crew, “in tactical terms the threat remains higher on the </p>
<p>ground than in the air”.</p>
<p>343</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Board of Inquiry into the Lynx crash concluded in June 2006 that the helicopter had </p>
<p>been shot down in a hostile attack, using man-portable surface to air missile (MANPAD) </p>
<p>technology.</p>
<p>344</p>
<p><b>708. </b> There was concern that the Lynx incident was evidence of technology transfer. </p>
<p>Lt Gen Fry observed in his weekly report that:</p>
<p>“… if there is evidence of MANPAD technology transfer following the route </p>
<p>established by EFP [Explosively Formed Projectile] it will certainly … reinforce the </p>
<p>Zelikow</p>
<p>345</p>
<p> hypothesis that Basra is vital ground, to be held by coalition forces until </p>
<p>the latter stages of the campaign”.</p>
<p>346</p>
<p><b>709. </b> Lt Gen Fry reported that Gen Casey had recommended a security initiative in </p>
<p>Basra to match those in Baghdad and Ramadi. </p>
<p><b>710. </b> After visiting Iraq in early May, Air Chief Marshal Jock Stirrup, who had become </p>
<p>Chief of the Defence Staff in April 2006, reported to Dr Reid that:</p>
<p>“… there was no Basra insurgency, levels of violence in the city were well down on </p>
<p>the other ‘red provinces’, and with different provincial leadership the prospects could </p>
<p>improve significantly.”</p>

<p>605</p>
<p><b>711. </b> During the visit, ACM Stirrup was briefed by Gen Casey on his updated campaign </p>
<p>plan, which included a reduction from 14 US brigades to 10 by the end of 2005 and five </p>
<p>by the end of 2007, subject to successful build-up of the Iraqi Security Forces. </p>
<p><b>712. </b> Despite the growing problems in Basra, ACM Stirrup judged that there was:</p>
<p>“… no logic for precipitate change in our military plans. Indeed there are compelling </p>
<p>reasons why security handover remains the right strategy. Militarily, in Maysan and </p>
<p>Muthanna the Iraqi Security Forces are ready, and there is political appetite. And </p>
<p>progress in those provinces will set the conditions for Basra, which is the key. The </p>
<p>obstacles there are: 1) militias, and 2) governance. Neither is substantially in our </p>
<p>hands, and we need firm action by the government in Baghdad. But as consent </p>
<p>continues to reduce (as we have always foreseen it would), so too does our ability to </p>
<p>effect further (significant) improvement. The law of diminishing returns is now firmly </p>
<p>in play, and there is an increasing risk that we become part of the problem, rather </p>
<p>than of the solution. So, for these reasons and for reasons of momentum, I judge </p>
<p>that we should press on …”</p>
<p><b>713. </b> ACM Stirrup visited Afghanistan as part of the same trip, and concluded:</p>
<p>“… the main similarity between both theatres is that, whilst we will continue </p>
<p>militarily to hold the ring as best we can, ultimate success can only be delivered by </p>
<p>non-military instruments of government, be they UK, international or indigenous. </p>
<p>But it is the contrasts between the two campaigns that struck me most. In Iraq, our </p>
<p>forces sit within a well found and well organised US-led force, with immense combat </p>
<p>power, effective command and control, coherent political oversight (in the form of the </p>
<p>US and UK embassies), and a coalition comprised of countries that … are prepared </p>
<p>to accept the costs, in blood and treasure, of operations in Iraq. This is just as well </p>
<p>for the coalition is viewed popularly as a force of occupation, suffers inexorably </p>
<p>declining levels of popular consent, and faces a multi-faceted, but sophisticated and </p>
<p>dangerous enemy.”</p>
<p><b>714. </b> ACM Stirrup contrasted circumstances in Iraq with the situation in Afghanistan </p>
<p>where the UK position in Helmand was “sound – indeed exemplary” but it was positioned </p>
<p>within a NATO force with insufficient combat power and a difficult command and control </p>
<p>structure. He asked:</p>
<p>“So what? In Iraq, we are in clear ‘law of diminishing returns’ territory. Even if we </p>
<p>were invited to stay (which looks improbable) it is difficult to see what military </p>
<p>advantage might flow from our remaining in any significant numbers beyond 2007. </p>
<p>That said, the security picture, particularly in Basra but also in Maysan, may not </p>
<p>look at all appetising as we pull out, and astute conditioning of the UK public may be </p>
<p>necessary if we are to avoid the charge of strategic failure. In Afghanistan, we face </p>
<p>immediate opportunity, tempered by uncertainty …</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>606</p>
<p>“Should anything be done differently? At the operational level, I judge not. We need </p>
<p>to maintain the momentum of security handover in Iraq, and continue our build up </p>
<p>in Afghanistan, but stay alert and agile. At the strategic level, there are at least two </p>
<p>areas worth our early attention. In Iraq, and I recognise that this is essentially a </p>
<p>political issue, there will be the need to think through the presentational challenge of </p>
<p>a post-security handover Iraq – and particularly Basra – that retains some fairly ugly </p>
<p>aspects. In Afghanistan, the issue is NATO’s capability …”</p>
<p><b>715. </b> ACM Stirrup also reported the views of UK staff based in Baghdad that “the </p>
<p>remainder of 2006 would be both decisive and challenging, with the trajectory depending </p>
<p>principally on the new Iraqi Government’s effectiveness”.</p>
<p><b>716. </b> On 10 May, Maj Gen Cooper reported that the Basra Provincial Council announced </p>
<p>that it was ending an official boycott of engagement with the Multi-National Force (MNF), </p>
<p>which had complicated relations between the MNF and local authorities since the </p>
<p>Jameat incident in September 2005.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><b>717. </b> The British Consul General and local Brigade Commander had been invited to </p>
<p>attend the Governor’s Provincial Security Committee on 9 May. </p>
<p><b>718. </b> On 10 May, the JIC reviewed the recent trends in violence in Iraq and a possible </p>
<p>change of attitude among Sunni insurgents towards the MNF and jihadist groups.</p>
<p>349</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>719. </b> The JIC’s Key Judgements included:</p>
<p>“I. Violence in Iraq has been rising since the start of the year, mainly in the Sunni </p>
<p>heartlands and Baghdad. The sustained violence in April has been unprecedented, </p>
<p>maintaining levels only previously seen in spikes associated with the January </p>
<p>election and constitutional referendum in October 2005. Increased sectarian </p>
<p>violence shows no sign of reducing.” </p>
<p><b>720. </b> The JIC assessed that there had been some change in the nature of the violence, </p>
<p>with more Iraqis being killed. Attacks on the Iraqi Security Forces accounted for around </p>
<p>15 percent of all attacks and sectarian violence had risen sharply since the bombing of </p>
<p>the al-Askari mosque in Samarra in February. </p>
<p><b>721. </b> The JIC judged that the “commitment of Sunni Arab nationalists to a violent </p>
<p>campaign is largely undiminished” and that support among the general Sunni population </p>
<p>for attacks on the MNF “remains strong”. In addition:</p>
<p>“III. In many areas co-operation between Sunni Arab nationalist insurgents and </p>

<p>blurred. Al Qaida in Iraq (AQ-I) is the most prominent jihadist group, with the greatest </p>
<p>organisational capacity …</p>
<p>“IV. There are limited signs that a small number of Sunni insurgents are considering </p>
<p>drawing away from violence, at least against the MNF. An enduring theme from them </p>
<p>is the need to combat the activities of AQ-I and the Iranians. Coalition outreach has </p>
<p>identified some Sunni insurgent leaders willing to engage … The ability of these </p>
<p>tentative contacts to affect broader insurgent violence is unknown.</p>
<p>“V. The strength of the insurgency is in part affected by Sunni participation in </p>

<p>the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF), MNF withdrawal, security and detainees, and </p>
<p>improvement in the quality of life.</p>
<p>“VI. Many insurgents have probably already decided that the political process will </p>
<p>not give them influence or benefit, or at least see no contradiction in pursuing a </p>
<p>twin-track approach of political participation and violence. A hard core of Sunni Arabs </p>
<p>will remain irreconcilable and join the jihadists in rejecting the political process. A </p>
<p>strong Sunni Arab insurgency is likely to persist beyond 2006.”</p>
<p><b>722. </b> On 12 May, a view of the situation in Basra was provided to Mr Tim Dowse, Chief </p>
<p>of the Assessments Staff.</p>
<p>350</p>
<p> It said:</p>
<p>“… the general security situation in Basra is in steady, if generally unspectacular, </p>
<p>decline … There are now 8-10 assassination-style murders a day, usually of Sunnis. </p>
<p>Religious, criminal and politically motivated intimidation is prevalent … The situation </p>
<p>is aggravated by the growing heat resulting in armed demonstrations at night against </p>
<p>the local authorities complaining of lack of electricity and other services … Political </p>
<p>life in Basra revolves around money, patronage and intimidation … The capacity </p>
<p>of local militias to influence politics through a show or threat of force was apparent </p>
<p>during the December elections … The police and Iraqi army have shown no appetite </p>
<p>to confront JAM and their capability to do so is untested.”</p>
<p><b>723. </b> The brief provided to Mr Dowse considered that the attacks on UK forces in Basra </p>
<p>were being conducted in part by elements of JAM and in part by renegade elements </p>
<p>within the Iraqi Security Forces:</p>
<p>“The problem of renegade security forces requires an Iraqi solution that depends on </p>
<p>tackling corruption and militia penetration of the Iraqi Security Forces and increasing </p>
<p>the influence of the central government over the provincial government in Basra.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>608</p>
<p><b>724. </b> In a video conference with President Bush on 16 May, Mr Blair said that the UK felt </p>
<p>the Iraqi Government was beginning to “shape up well”.</p>
<p>351</p>
<p> The next step would be for </p>
<p>the US and UK to present, jointly with Prime Minister Maliki, a strong programme for the </p>
<p>government, including “a very clear forward perspective on security transition”. </p>
<p><b>725. </b> The following week insurgents in MND(SE) detonated a command wire Improvised </p>
<p>Explosive Device (IED).</p>
<p>352,353</p>
<p> This was the first successful such attack in Iraq since </p>
<p>December 2005 and the first instance of an IED of this type in MND(SE). Maj Gen </p>
<p>Cooper observed that this reversion to an older form of technology represented a </p>
<p>change in the insurgents’ tactics, possibly in response to MNF counter-IED advances.</p>
<p><b>726. </b> On 20 May, Prime Minister Maliki presented his Cabinet (minus the Ministers for </p>
<p>Interior, Security and Defence) to the Council of Representatives.</p>
<p>354</p>
<p> All were approved. </p>
<p><b>727. </b> Mr Patey described the Maliki government as a “genuine government of national </p>
<p>unity”.</p>
<p>355</p>
<p> Although it was, in his view, “not quite the technocratic powerhouse we hoped </p>
<p>for”, he was clear that it included “a fair number of highly competent individuals in </p>
<p>key positions”.</p>
<p><b>728. </b> Gen Jackson visited Iraq from 15 to 18 May and observed:</p>
<p>“The key challenge is governance … </p>
<p>“Yet even given a backdrop of good governance, the security challenges are still </p>
<p>daunting … With our understandable focus on the relatively peaceful MND(SE), it is </p>
<p>easy to forget the extreme levels of violence that are common place in Baghdad and </p>
<p>its environs … </p>
<p>“Whilst there is no doubt that the US Military will do ‘whatever it takes’ to contain the </p>
<p>security situation … Lieutenant General Chiarelli [Commander of the Multi-National </p>
<p>Corps – Iraq] remarked that another 50,000 troops would be needed to really </p>
<p>improve security in Baghdad alone … This is a precarious position to be in …”</p>
<p>356</p>
<p><b>729. </b> Gen Jackson went on to describe a growing US frustration with perceived UK </p>
<p>objectives:</p>
<p>“My final point from Baghdad is rather unpalatable but, given the strength with which </p>
<p>it was put across to me and the fact that it has never been far from the surface on </p>
<p>previous visits, I feel compelled to raise it here. The perception, right or wrong, </p>
<p>in some – if not all – US military circles is that the UK is motivated more by the </p>

<p>short-term political gain of early withdrawal than by the long-term importance of </p>
<p>mission accomplishment; and that, as a result, MND(SE)’s operational posture is too </p>
<p>laissez faire and lacks initiative …”</p>
<p><b>730. </b> Gen Jackson warned: </p>
<p>“… if US opinion is allowed to drift down its current course, we risk sacrificing the </p>
<p>grand strategic aim (the UK/US special relationship) of our whole engagement in </p>
<p>Iraq, for the sake of short term domestic … expediency.”</p>
<p><b>731. </b> Looking ahead to the future, Gen Jackson continued:</p>
<p>“As ever, the campaign prognosis from Basra’s perspective is somewhat rosier than </p>
<p>that from Baghdad; though the difference is less marked than on previous visits …</p>
<p>“The Governor of Basra aside, GOC MND(SE) was reasonably optimistic about </p>
<p>political progress in the South East though much hinges on continuing Shia political </p>
<p>coherence …</p>
<p>“If the Shia fault-lines are torn asunder, which is not inconceivable, all bets are off. </p>
<p>“From the military perspective, MND(SE)’s very clear focus remains rightly upon </p>
<p>transition in its four provinces. Muthanna is certainly ripe for Provincial Iraqi Control </p>
<p>(PIC) … In Basra, PIC is some way off, not only due to the malign influence of </p>
<p>Governor Wahili, but also because the local IPS is particularly weak … In Dhi Qar, </p>
<p>progress towards PIC is steady … </p>
<p>“Lastly, in Maysan, there continues to be a serious difference of US and UK opinion </p>
<p>over transition … it was clear that MNC-I do not yet believe that the appropriate </p>
<p>conditions have been set … On the other hand, GOC MND(SE)’s argument in favour </p>
<p>of early transition in Maysan is compelling … First, there is a level of expectation </p>
<p>in Maysan that they will be granted PIC as a reward for good behaviour … Should </p>
<p>this aspiration not be met, we can expect a violent backlash. Second, and probably </p>
<p>more persuasive, is GOC MND(SE)’s argument about diminishing returns … Indeed, </p>
<p>his view that ‘<i>standing still is going backwards</i>’ suggests that we are approaching </p>
<p>the stage in Maysan where our presence will be seen as part of the problem not the </p>
<p>solution.” </p>
<p><b>732. </b> Gen Jackson’s visit report concluded:</p>
<p>“My final reflection from this visit … is that even if we deliver the agenda of transition </p>
<p>laid out by the campaign plan, what we will leave behind will not look much like </p>
<p>strategic success. Ten years hence our strategy may fully bear fruit. But in the short </p>
<p>term Iraq will most probably be characterised by spikes of violence, continuing </p>
<p>sectarian strife, fragile governance and stuttering economic development … </p>
<p>I agree that we need to start shaping the views of domestic and political audiences </p>
<p>accordingly.”</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>610</p>
<p><b>733. </b> Reporting a discussion with Lt Gen Chiarelli on 17 May, Maj Gen Cooper </p>
<p>elaborated his argument, pointing out that “if conditions were not right now, what would </p>
<p>change in the timeframe envisaged for transition in the coming months?”</p>
<p>357</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>734. </b> On 22 May, the ISOG discussed how to draw together a strategic plan to deliver </p>
<p>the UK’s objectives in Basra.</p>
<p>358</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>735. </b> The objectives were to ensure that Basra:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was on track to being assessed as suitable for transition by the end of 2006 or </p>
<p>early 2007;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had mechanisms in place that were able to develop and deliver governance and </p>
<p>security policies through institutions that were broadly acceptable to the local </p>
<p>population and effectively linked to the Iraqi central authorities;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>enjoyed an improving level of basic services;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was attracting appropriate investment and other economic assistance; </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>had “levels of corruption, criminality and criminal and sectarian violence below </p>
<p>the point at which they would seriously undermine governance, security and </p>
<p>economic development and popular support for Iraqi governmental institutions”; </p>
<p>and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>was not subject to malign Iranian influence.</p>
<p><b>736. </b> The ISOG concluded that achieving these objectives required:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>continued engagement on SSR (see Section 12.1);</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a demonstration of grip by the Iraqi Government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>strengthened provincial government;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>an Iraqi Government development strategy that supported Basra’s role;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>external investment;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>containing corruption to a level that was not undermining; and</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>the UK to identify policies for security, governance and economic development </p>
<p>that “can reasonably be expected to lead to strategic success”. </p>

<p><b>738. </b> Mr Blair visited Iraq on 22 May.</p>
<p>360</p>
<p> He met President Talabani and, separately, </p>
<p>Prime Minister Maliki. </p>
<p><b>739. </b> Both men asked Mr Blair whether media reports that the UK was looking to </p>
<p>withdraw from Iraq were accurate. Mr Blair responded that the UK:</p>
<p>“… had the same objective as the Iraqi government: to go when the latter’s forces </p>
<p>were ready to take over.” </p>
<p><b>740. </b> A joint statement issued by the two Prime Ministers at a press conference after </p>
<p>their meeting said that the:</p>
<p>“… process of transition would start in some provinces in the coming months, and </p>

<p>been transferred to Iraqi control.”</p>
<p>361</p>
<p><b>741. </b> The statement recorded agreement to continue efforts to widen the countries </p>

<p>“The Iraqi Government for its part would provide a compelling vision of the way </p>
<p>ahead showing how international assistance would complement its actions in pursuit </p>
<p>of the common goal of a stable Iraq at peace with its neighbours.”</p>
<p><b>742. </b> Mr Blair and Prime Minister Maliki had “discussed the situation in Basra and </p>

<p><b>743. </b> After the press conference, it was reported that:</p>

<p>saying that the planned date was actually July.”</p>
<p>362</p>

<p>The Report of the Iraq Inquiry</p>
<p>612</p>
<p><b>745. </b> On the way back to the UK after the visit, Sir Nigel Sheinwald sent Mr Hadley a </p>
<p>note for President Bush from Mr Blair.</p>
<p>364</p>
<p> It said: </p>
<p>“I left Iraq, on balance, more optimistic not less … The Government obviously has </p>
<p>a real sense of mission. Not one [member of the government] … said we should </p>
<p>go now … All want us to stay to get the job done. <b>If</b> we have a clear plan, properly </p>
<p>executed and communicated to the Iraqi people, we will succeed.</p>
<p>“Now for the challenge: the nature of the insurgency is changing; we do not, on our </p>
<p>own, have the force capability to defeat it; as the Sunni become convinced we are </p>
<p>non-sectarian, they welcome it and conversely as the more extreme Shia come to </p>
<p>the same conclusion, they don’t. Hence Basra becoming a problem. In addition, </p>
<p>very simply put: the security is so bad in and around Baghdad for ordinary folk, that </p>
<p>it stops improvement in services, we get blamed (in part) and people start looking </p>
<p>to militias to protect them. Al Qaida kill Shia. Shia kill Sunni, and sectarian violence </p>
<p>increases.”</p>
<p><b>746. </b> Mr Blair set out five suggestions for a plan to draw together and focus effort in Iraq </p>
<p>to address the “vicious spiral” described above:</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>publishing a conditional timetable for withdrawal of the MNF;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>a “better, stronger ISF build-up”;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>prioritising Baghdad security and electricity production;</p>
<p>• </p>
<p>doing deals with the insurgents to enter the political process; and </p>
<p>• </p>
<p>shaming the international community into supporting the new Iraqi Government, </p>
<p>through a big UN-led donor conference. </p>
<p><b>747. </b> The day after leaving Iraq, Sir Nigel Sheinwald wrote to Mr Straw’s Principal </p>
<p>Private Secretary to set out Mr Blair’s view of priorities for Iraq, which mirrored the </p>
<p>suggestions he sent to President Bush.</p>
<p>365</p>
<p> The key elements included: </p>
<p>“– </p>
<p>Drawing up a <b>timetable with conditions</b> setting out the potential path to </p>
<p>MNF withdrawal. This should address the desire of Iraqis for clarity over two </p>
<p>issues: that the MNF will stay until Iraqi security forces are capable of acting </p>
<p>independently; and that the MNF will go once that has been achieved. Any </p>
<p>timetable should include dates, but each one should be conditional on ISF </p>
<p>build-up of capability and overall violence levels … <b>Action: The Prime Minister </b></p>
<p><b>will discuss with President Bush in Washington. Thereafter MOD/BE </b></p>

<p><b>750. </b> On withdrawing troops from Iraq, Mr Blair thought that the way forward was to “give </p>
<p>an indication of our intentions, but make sure they were conditions based”. Mr Blair said </p>
<p>it was important that there was no hint of “cutting and running”. Security and electricity </p>
<p>supply were key, but above all the momentum must be kept going. </p>
<p><b>751. </b> Mr Blair proposed a conference in the autumn to get support from the international </p>

<p>withdrawal of the MNF”. </p>
<p><b>752. </b> Mr Blair and President Bush held a joint press conference in which Mr Blair told </p>
